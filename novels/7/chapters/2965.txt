Chapter 2966 Chapter 40 – Who Is He?

When the Winter of Eternal Night descended, everyone immediately saw a snowy-white lotus flower blooming around Shi Feng, the sight beautiful and transcendental.

A Bronze Combat Technique?!

Galaxy Past’s expression turned unprecedentedly grave when he saw this snowy-white lotus.

Combat techniques in God’s Domain could be differentiated into various ranks. Meanwhile, ranked above advanced combat techniques were Bronze Combat Techniques, and combat techniques of this rank were so rare that even most Tier 5 experts didn’t possess one.

However, so long as a Tier 5 expert managed to acquire a Bronze Combat Technique, their combat power would instantly skyrocket to the peak of Tier 5. It wouldn’t even matter even if they only had average equipment standards.

The reason for this was because Bronze Combat Techniques provided players with the strength to transcend tiers. This remained true even for Tier 5 existences.

I have to block it!

When Galaxy Past saw the gigantic lotus flower moving toward him, he promptly let out a shout as he used the Tier 3 Legacy Berserk Skill Savage God’s Howl.

Suddenly, an illusory behemoth appeared around Galaxy Past as his Basic Attributes doubled. The space surrounding him also began to shatter, looking as if it couldn’t withstand the new source of power that dwelled within his body. Then, after activating his Berserk Skill, Galaxy Past promptly brandished his saber against the approaching lotus flower.

Advanced Combat Technique, Sky Breaker!

All of a sudden, several blades of light shot out from Galaxy Past’s saber before merging to form a gigantic saber that crashed into the lotus flower.

Boom!

A deafening boom shook the area within a thousand yards of the battlefield. The trembling ground and spreading shockwaves could even be felt by the spectating players standing over a hundred yards away. In addition, the grassland within a 100-yard radius of the collision had also transformed into barren land, and the ground had sunk by more than ten meters...

“I don’t think even top-tier Tier 4 players can deform the terrain to such an extent...”

“Are they really Tier 3 players?”

Mysterious Moon’s members subconsciously gasped when they looked at the state of the battlefield.

In God’s Domain, players were known to become superhumans after reaching Tier 3. However, when it came to destructive power, even a large-scale Destruction Spell used by a Tier 3 magical class player couldn’t deform the terrain to such a great extent. Typically, only after reaching Tier 4 would players have the strength to do so. Even then, the area of destruction would be limited. Few Tier 4 players could cause as much destruction as Shi Feng and Galaxy Past did.

It should be known that there was a huge gap in strength between Tier 3 and Tier 4. There was even a saying in God’s Domain which stated that all those beneath Tier 4 were ants. Through this saying, one could tell how much stronger Tier 4 players were than Tier 3 players.

Looking at the destroyed terrain before her, Zhuo Yalin dazedly muttered, “Is this a fight between first-generation experts?”

Lin Yaoyue also nodded in agreement when she overheard Zhuo Yalin’s mutterings, her eyes filled with shock and excitement.

Although she had seen countless experts clashing in God’s Domain’s Professional League before, she had never seen players causing such devastation at Tier 3. This was, without a doubt, her first time.

Rather than a fight between Tier 3 players, it’d be more apt to call this a fight between two behemoths.

While everyone was in a state of shock, the dust clouds covering the battlefield also gradually dissipated, revealing two people staring off at each other. Unlike Shi Feng, though, Galaxy Past’s HP was no longer in a pristine state. Instead, 10% of it was missing. Evidently, Galaxy Past had lost in his clash with Shi Feng.

“The Guild Leader lost?”

“How is this possible?! The Guild Leader even used his Berserk Skill already! How could he still lose?!”

The Star Alliance’s experts were flabbergasted when they saw the state of Galaxy Past’s HP, their minds unable to accept this reality.

With the combination of a Tier 3 Legacy Berserk Skill and an advanced combat technique, Galaxy Past should be able to exert as much power as a Level 100 Mythic monster with his attacks. Yet, even with such power, he still lost to a player geared in starter’s equipment. Who could possibly believe this?

At this time, let alone the Star Alliance’s members, even Mysterious Moon’s members were stunned by this situation.

“Yaoyue, does this mean we won?” Zhuo Yalin asked, her eyes blinking in disbelief.

“It should be.” Lin Yaoyue nodded stiffly as she looked at Shi Feng. She, too, found this outcome unbelievable.

This was Galaxy Past they were talking about!

Galaxy Past was a mighty expert standing at the top of God’s Domain. He was considered top-tier even among Tier 5 experts. Yet, even after wearing the eight-piece Blood Dragon Set and wielding the Famed Saber Ice Roar, Galaxy Past had still lost. If news of this matter spread, it would certainly cause an uproar in the entire God’s Domain.

“Black Flame, is it?” Looking at Shi Feng’s cloaked figure, Galaxy Past asked in an excited voice, “With your strength, there is no way you would appear in a small place like the Miniature Ancient World. Moreover, out of all the experts I know of in God’s Domain, I don’t recall an expert like you. May I know if you are a person from that side?”

An expert with a Bronze Combat Technique capable of defeating him while using only starter’s equipment couldn’t be a nameless person in God’s Domain. Yet, Galaxy Past had never heard of the name of Black Flame.

There was also no possibility of one of God’s Domain’s bigshots starting a sub-account. God’s Domain didn’t allow players to have two accounts, after all. There was also no way any of those bigshots would be willing to abandon their accounts and start all over again.

Thus, the only explanation left for Shi Feng’s existence was that he was someone from that side!

“Someone from that side? What side?”

“What does the Guild Leader mean?”

The surrounding spectators grew confused when they heard Galaxy Past’s words.

What did he mean by “someone from that side”?

When Zhuo Yalin and Lin Yaoyue heard Galaxy Past’s words though, their expressions instantly changed as they turned to look at Shi Feng in shock and surprise.

“No way!”

“He’s someone from that side?”

Ordinary experts in God’s Domain and even the middle management of the various major powers would probably be confused if they heard Galaxy Past’s words.

However, it was a different story for Zhuo Yalin and Lin Yaoyue, who were reserve executives of first-rate Guilds. Thanks to their status, they had the qualifications to touch upon information not privy to most ordinary powers in God’s Domain. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meanwhile, according to what they heard from their superiors, there wasn’t just one world of God’s Domain, but many instead. Moreover, these other versions of God’s Domain were played by people from other planes of reality.

Take the latest expansion pack, for example. When everyone heard that a war between two worlds of God’s Domain was going to be held, most people only assumed that the people from the other God’s Domain were merely other people from the same reality. After all, Earth wasn’t the sole living place for humans. Humans living on other planets might be playing God’s Domain as well. Meanwhile, communication between planets was incredibly difficult, so it wasn’t strange that they hadn’t heard about humans on other planets playing God’s Domain until now.

However, according to their understanding, the players from other versions of God’s Domain weren’t living in the same reality as them at all.

When Zhuo Yalin and Lin Yaoyue first learned of this information, both of them had found it to be unbelievable. They thought it was nothing more than fantasy. However, after their superiors showed them evidence, they came to understand that all of this was true. Moreover, they also came to understand that the virtual reality game known as God’s Domain definitely wasn’t as simple as everyone imagined it to be. Instead, it was a game that wagered the fate of humanity.
