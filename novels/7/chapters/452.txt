Chapter 453 - Favor

“Sister Fire Dance, you look so beautiful in that set!” Violet Cloud said enviously.

The rest of the party promptly nodded in agreement.

One had to admit that the Warfire Set Equipment was indeed exquisite.

The set Fire Dance wore a mix of red and black leather, coupled with the two dazzling Truefire Blades hanging from her waist. Without a doubt, the set had enhanced the Assassin’s allure. A hint of awe moved her teammates’ hearts.

After Fire Dance had equipped the Warfire Set, although her Attributes had fallen slightly, no one present viewed her as any weaker.

It had been some time since God’s Domain had launched. Even if one were only an ordinary player, their natural instincts had sharpened.

Previously, no one had felt any particular way when they saw Fire Dance. Now, however, she gave off the same sense as a thorned rose, beautiful and deadly, and any who approached her would very likely pay with their lives.

Previously, Fire Dance had a total of 4,960 HP. After equipping the Warfire Set Equipment, however, her maximum HP had fallen to 4,380. Her other Attributes had similarly decreased.

One of the main reasons was that the Warfire Set was still Mysterious-Iron rank right now. The set’s Basic Attributes could not compare to the Level 25 Fine-Gold and Secret-Silver Equipment she had worn before, though it did possess set effects that the individual pieces of equipment had not.

Among the set effects, the skill, Free Will, was extremely useful. When used against an enemy with powerful control skills, Free Will could instantly turn the tide of battle.

Moreover, unlike her other Attributes that had decreased, her Agility had increased. As a result, she was now far more nimble. The 35% Cooldown Reduction she received for all her skills also increased the variety of skill combinations she could implement.

Most importantly was the Warfire Berserk, a berserk skill.

Although Warfire Berserk was not as powerful as the berserk skills Shi Feng possessed, a player with a berserk skill was still superior to a player without one.

Because of this, envy blossomed in Fire Dance’s friends when they saw her in her new armor.

After Virtuous Cloud recovered from her daze, she pulled her gaze from Fire Dance and turned to Shi Feng. She was no longer as relaxed as she had been, growing far more cautious.

Originally, she had intended to sell the remaining Warfire set piece to Shi Feng as well. However, she now dismissed this idea.

Even a fool could tell that Shi Feng was a powerful character. Moreover, Fire Dance and the others had referred to Black Flame as their Guild Leader. Compared to minor existences like themselves, he was in an entirely different world.

Not only had Shi Feng saved their lives, but he had also purchased the Warfire Bracers they had for more than the market price. They already owed Shi Feng a huge favor. If she tried to sell the second Warfire set piece to Shi Feng at a high price, she would be ashamed herself.

Virtuous Cloud disliked owing other people favors. She was not comfortable until she repaid what she owed. Hence, she looked towards Shi Feng and asked softly, “Guild Leader Black Flame... I have something I wish to seek your help with.”

“Sure,” Shi Feng replied in a carefree manner.

It was thanks to Virtuous Cloud that he had been able to complete the Warfire Set Equipment. He had no issues with helping her with a small request.

“Our party consists of only independent players, so it isn’t easy for us to obtain equipment for ourselves. I still have another Warfire set piece with me. Would it be possible to trade it for six pieces of Level 20 Secret-Silver Equipment?” Virtuous Cloud asked, slightly embarrassed.

The market price for the Warfire set was eight Gold per piece. As for Level 20 Secret-Silver Equipment, a few days ago, each was worth roughly one or two Gold. However, as players’ levels increased and teams successfully raided more Level 20 Team Dungeons, the value of Secret-Silver Equipment fell sharply. Currently, one piece of Level 20 Secret-Silver Equipment was only worth around 90 Silver; six pieces would cost around five Gold at most.

Listening to Virtuous Cloud’s request, Shi Feng immediately understood her intentions.

She obviously did not wish to owe him a favor.

“No problem. However, I don’t have that many Level 20 Secret-Silver Equipment on me, though there are plenty back in our Warehouse. I’m just about to head back to the city anyway. Will one of you follow me to pick out the equipment?” Shi Feng tried not to be a hypocrite. Since Virtuous Cloud wanted to avoid owing him a favor, he would not try to force her to accept his goodwill.

“I’ll pass you the Warfire set piece first, then,” Virtuous Cloud said as she happily traded a pair of Warfire Boots to Shi Feng. When Shi Feng agreed to her request, she felt like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders.

When Shi Feng saw that it was a pair of boots, he was somewhat disappointed, but in the end, it was still another piece of the Warfire set. He’d rather have duplicates than none at all.

After they had concluded their trade, Shi Feng and the others wandered down the main road, heading towards the exit of White Fog Canyon.

Players could not use Return Scrolls inside White Fog Canyon. Hence, Shi Feng and the others needed to leave the canyon on foot before they could teleport back to the city.

Shi Feng had reaped a massive harvest from his trip to White Fog Canyon this time.

Not only had he obtained a large stock of Starfire Ore, but he had also gained many Warfire set pieces. Most importantly, he had managed to snatch the golden stone tablet.

Seeing as the golden stone tablet warranted even a Great Lord’s protection, it had to be incredibly precious. Shi Feng suspected it was just as valuable as an Epic item, if not more.

Initially, Shi Feng had planned to begin researching the golden stone tablet as soon as possible. However, when he thought about how he was still in White Fog Canyon and that Anubis’s Gatekeeper was still alive, he immediately suppressed his excitement. After all, there was no guarantee that the Great Lord would not follow him. Hence, Shi Feng intended to return to White River City before studying the stone tablet.

Even if the Gatekeeper showed up in White River City, it would not be a threat. Shi Feng might even take advantage of the opportunity to get rid of the Gatekeeper.

After all, White River City was under Weissman’s protection, a Tier 4 Great Wizard. With just the strength of a Tier 3 class, the Anubis’s Gatekeeper could not run rampant in the city.

Just as Shi Feng and the others were about to reach White Fog Canyon’s exit, a group suddenly blocked their way. Virtuous Cloud and her team turned grim at the sight.

“There sure are a lot of people.” Shi Feng could not help but laugh as he surveyed the surrounding forests.

Several thousand players had hidden in the forest on either side of the road. Even with dulled senses, Shi Feng could still detect them.

“Guild Leader Black Flame,” Youlan greeted as she slowly walked out of the forest, smiling faintly at Shi Feng. “Since you’ve discovered us, I guess we don’t need to hide anymore. Everyone, come out.”

Following which, swarms of players emerged from the surrounding cover, their numbers exceeding 2,000. Every player was an elite of Overwhelming Smile. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

These 2,000 elite players had blocked off the road leading out of White Fog Canyon, and they all emitted a cold killing intent as they glowered at Shi Feng’s group. Compared to the Red Names who had assaulted them previously, these elite players had far better equipment.

“I wonder what business Overwhelming Smile has with me today?” Shi Feng pondered aloud as he observed his surroundings, searching for a gap that he could take advantage of.

In his current Weakened state, it would be somewhat difficult to escape the encirclement of 2,000 elite players. Furthermore, he had his team to consider.

“Guild Leader Black Flame must be joking,” Youlan said as she watched her target carefully, finding the man truly interesting. Even against 2,000 Overwhelming Smile elites, his expression had not changed in the slightest. “Previously, you killed over a hundred of our Guild members. If word of that gets out, we’ll be a laughingstock. I’ve specifically sought out Guild Leader Black Flame today to seek reparations.”
