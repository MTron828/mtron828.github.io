Chapter 293 – Greater God’s Domain

Shi Feng fell into deep thought when Kalisha finished speaking, unable to make up his mind.

Ancient Dragons were the most ancient existences among Dragons. At the same time, they were Dragons that had existed since the birth of God’s Domain. So, their Legacies would not be inferior to the average Ancient God. Even if he couldn’t use Kalisha’s Ancient Dragon Legacy, he could use it to nurture an expert that could rival Ancient Gods in the future.

However, the Primal Ore Vein and one of the Seven Luminaries Codex’s fragments were equally tempting.

The Primal Ore Vein was an independent miniature world. Not only could it be carried around like an item, but the Primal Ore Vein’s owner could also harvest the ores within it without worrying about competition from other powers. Owning a Primal Ore Vein would be no different than owning a private ore vein.

Players who owned a Primal Ore Vein wouldn’t even need to mine the vein themselves. They could simply hire some NPCs to enter the miniature world and harvest the ores for them.

Meanwhile, a Primal Ore Vein typically had at least half of an Elementary God’s Domain’s Seven Luminaries Crystal daily production volume. After adding in the fact that a Primal Ore Vein was absolutely safe, the amount of Seven Luminaries Crystals one could harvest from it would not be any lower than the actual amount one could harvest from an Elementary God’s Domain.

As for the Seven Luminaries Codex’s fragment, it was an item essential for Shi Feng to acquire the complete Ancient Abyssal God Legacy.

After pondering for a minute, Shi Feng said, “I choose to head to the Greater God’s Domain!”

“Are you sure?” Kalisha couldn’t help but ask again when she heard Shi Feng’s answer.

The Greater God’s Domain was many times more dangerous than the Miniature Ancient World they were in. Even Tier 6 Gods could fall if they weren’t careful. As for Tier 4 existences, they were nothing in the Greater God’s Domain.

“I am very sure!” Shi Feng answered without hesitation.

The Miniature Ancient World might be filled with many opportunities and was incredibly well-suited for budding powers and players, but there was a huge precondition for these new powers and players to grow—the God’s Domain it was connected to must not be fully opened.

So long as a God’s Domain became fully opened, the Miniature Ancient World connected to it would also become open to outsiders. The only difference was that the Miniature Ancient World would impose more restrictions on outsiders than the God’s Domain it was connected to.[1]

Going by his experiences in his previous life, it should only be around one to three more months before his home God’s Domain’s World Passage became fully opened. So, he would only be entering the Greater God’s Domain a little earlier than others.

Moreover, it wasn’t as if he couldn’t return to the Miniature Ancient World after heading to the Greater God’s Domain. He had the Abyss Workshop Certification. So long as he spent 3,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals, he could instantly teleport back to the Miniature Ancient World via World-Breaking Teleportation.

Not to mention, he was in urgent need of Seven Luminaries Crystals.

Although he had the strength necessary to compete with the various powers over the Land of Ancient Dragons’ Seven Luminaries Crystal vein, how many crystals he could actually get his hands on was a big question. Rather than gamble on an unknown factor, he might as well take the safer option and acquire the entire primal ore vein.

Not to mention, the Seven Luminaries Codex’s fragments were scattered randomly across God’s Domain. Finding them would not be easy. Even if he had one whole year to conduct his search, he wasn’t confident he could find even one fragment.

Now that Kalisha was offering to send him directly to a place with one of the Seven Luminaries Codex’s fragments, he could save himself a lot of trouble if he took this offer.

The Seven Luminaries Codex was one of the Godly Relics that had existed since the birth of God’s Domain. It possessed heaven-defying abilities that one could never find on even Divine Artifacts.

Although he had encountered plenty of fortuitous opportunities during his previous life, never had he come across an actual Godly Relic.

If he could get his hands on a real Godly Relic, he would have a much easier path to traverse in God’s Domain. Even apex powers might have to take the long way around when they came across him.

So, now that there was an opportunity to complete the Seven Luminaries Codex, Shi Feng naturally couldn’t let it get away.

“Since you’ve already decided, I will take you away with me, then. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to offer you any help before I recover my strength, so you will have to depend on yourself to progress in the greater world. In addition, one Evil God and one Demon God have already set their sights on you. So long as their followers discover the Ancient Dragon’s Power on you, I’m afraid you’ll have a hard time surviving…” Kalisha said as she waved her hand and faked a worried expression.

“...”

Shi Feng couldn’t help but feel as if he had been tricked when he heard Kalisha’s words and saw the series of system notifications.

However, before Shi Feng could say anything, Kalisha suddenly smiled and snapped her fingers. Immediately afterward, Shi Feng saw the world around him spinning and transforming into a dark-gray spatial passage. Then, he was dragged into the spatial passage regardless of his will.

Unlike other spatial passages, Shi Feng could see translucent chains blocking the entire dark-gray passage.

However, this passage wasn’t the only one bound by these translucent chains. Shi Feng could also see himself bound by similar chains.

These translucent chains were connected to the depths of his soul. Meanwhile, the deeper he traveled into the dark-gray passage, the more numerous and stronger these translucent chains became.

After spending an unknown amount of time in the spatial passage, Shi Feng finally reached the passage’s end and found himself appearing on a barren prairie. At the same time, he found that the gravity he experienced, the mana around him, and even his physical fitness had undergone extreme changes.

The mana that covered the prairie was much denser and more violent than the mana found in the Miniature Ancient World. The suppression of physical fitness also increased drastically. Even though Shi Feng was currently at Tier 4, he felt as if he was no different from a Henglian master in the real world. He couldn’t even fly in this place, which resulted in him falling to the ground and losing over 10% of his HP...

…

System: You have discovered the Ancient River Kingdom’s Hundred Leaves Wilderness.

…

The Ancient River Kingdom?

Shi Feng felt a little nostalgic when he saw the system notification.

The Greater God’s Domain was boundless. Apart from being divided into the various Realms and the central Twelve Sanctuaries, every Realm housed thousands of kingdoms and empires.

For the sake of their respective civilization’s development, the various God’s Domains’ powers constantly fought over territories to secure the limited available resources. Either the various powers would be fighting in territorial disputes within cities, between cities, between kingdoms, or between kingdoms and empires. Sometimes, they would even participate in Realm Wars to upgrade their Realm to the next level.

The madness and desperation of players and powers in the Greater God’s Domain were on a completely different level compared to his homeworld.

Meanwhile, out of the various kingdoms in the Greater God’s Domain, the Ancient River Kingdom was the ancient kingdom his homeworld was connected to. The Ancient River Kingdom had existed for more than a thousand years, and six hegemonic powers jointly controlled it. It was also a place he was incredibly familiar with in the Greater God’s Domain.

While Shi Feng was taking a stroll down memory lane, his stomach suddenly started grumbling, and a sense of hunger spread across his body.

I have to head to a city to grab something to eat quickly,?Shi Feng thought as he rubbed his stomach. He wasn’t a stranger to this sensation.

The Greater God’s Domain differed from the various God’s Domains and other places. It could be regarded as a real world, and players needed to sate their hunger here to stay alive. Moreover, the food here was considered non-bag space items.

Unless players used tools such as Epic Spatial Bags, they would have no choice but to carry their food around on their persons. In addition, players would have to cook food as they would in the real world. They even had to rely on growing crops to source grain-type ingredients. This led to a dramatic increase in the importance of Lifestyle Players.

However, it was also because of this situation that earning Ancient Coins and Star Coins in the Greater God’s Domain was significantly easier.[1]

Subsequently, Shi Feng took a look at his surroundings. Despite this place being a barren prairie, the monsters here were above Level 120 on average. The majority of them were also Grand Lords, and they moved in groups led by Mythic monsters. These were not monsters the average player could go up against alone, especially not when there was such a powerful suppression to players’ Physique.

Even a Henglian grandmaster wielding a weapon would have great difficulty holding his ground against several beasts of a significantly larger size.

Just when Shi Feng was considering learning a Tier 4 Legacy Skill to enhance his combat power, a dark silhouette suddenly emerged from a distant horizon and rapidly closed in on his location. Shortly after this dark figure appeared, several five-meter-tall figures followed. These five-meter-tall figures were Level 124 Grand Lord ranked Three-tailed Blaze Wolves, and it was obvious that they were chasing after the dark figure.

As this dark figure moved closer and closer, Shi Feng could finally see the other party’s appearance.

“Wu Xiaoxiao?”

TL Notes:

[1]I removed a sentence after this part.

Removed sentence:

Translated:

If reselling was done right, it was entirely possible to earn enough wealth to make even hegemonic powers grow envious.

Google:

If the reselling of the two worlds is done, it is not impossible to earn wealth that will make the giants jealous.

Reason for removal:

The sentence is vague. It doesn’t mention who is doing the reselling. Is it the individual Lifestyle Player? Or a small group of Lifestyle Players? Or an organization?

Considering that players will have to cook food as they do in the real world, it should be a time-consuming process, so I doubt one Lifestyle Player can cook enough food to earn a massive fortune.

I don’t want to jump to conclusions and assume it is done by a group/organization, either, since I’m not sure if the author hasn’t clarified exactly how time-consuming the cooking process is. For all I know, Lifestyle Players who have become Master/Grandmaster Chefs might have the ability to cook up dishes in a buffet in minutes, even in the Greater God’s Domain.

So, I decided to only mention that earning Ancient Coins and Star Coins in the Greater God’s Domain is easier because of this food gimmick.
