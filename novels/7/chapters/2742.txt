Chapter 2743 – Astonishing Upper Zone

Shi Feng was curious about the Upper Zone. Hence, he did not hesitate to respond to Kerui’s urging. However, just as he was about to step off the platform, a voice came from behind him.

“Wait a minute!”

The owner of this voice was none other than the short-haired youth, Yan Wuming.

“What do you want?” Shi Feng asked, puzzled.

Shi Feng was relatively curious about Yan Wuming’s existence, as well. In the past, Yan Wuming had been a high and mighty existence in God’s Domain, like a god of war that overlooked all life. Yet, now, he was only a young boy-a boy whose eyes blazed with intense fighting spirit as he looked at Shi Feng.

“What’s your name?” Yan Wuming asked.

“Shi Feng,” Shi Feng responded curtly.

“Shi Feng? I’ll remember that!” Yan Wuming silently repeated Shi Feng’s name in his mind several times. He then looked at Shi Feng and said earnestly, “Although I lost to you in the mental strength competition today, I will quickly reach the Special Grade standard. I will challenge you again at that time!”

“Challenge me?” Shi Feng chuckled. He then shook his head and said, “I’m afraid I don’t have that kind of time. I’m a busy person.”

Shi Feng did not lie to the boy. He had to not only resolve Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose’s problem but also attend to plenty of Guild affairs as well as quests awaiting completion.

Previously, he had still lacked strength. However, now that he had reached Tier 4, there were many problems he could begin tackling.

Hence, he did not have time for Yan Wuming’s challenge.

“This isn’t up to you!” Yan Wuming ignored Shi Feng’s thoughts. In a sonorous and forceful tone, he said, “One of my goals is to be number one in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone, and you’re my first obstacle. Only after defeating you can I get closer to my goal!” “It seems you like challenges.” Shi Feng wasn’t particularly surprised at Yan Wuming’s declaration. After giving the matter some thought, he said, “How about this? I’ll give you one chance to challenge me. So long as you meet my condition, you can challenge me at any time. What do you think?”

“Say it,” Yan Wuming said confidently.

“Do you play God’s Domain?” Shi Feng asked.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’ve been playing it for some time now.” Looking at Shi Feng strangely, Yan Wuming asked, “Are you telling me to defeat you in God’s Domain?”

Kerui, who stood nearby, heard Yan Wuming’s words and couldn’t help snickering.

“You must be confident in yourself, huh? Do you even know who he is? You want to defeat him in God’s Domain?” Kerui scoffed at Yan Wuming.

“No matter who he is, I will win!”

Yan Wuming did not waver in the slightest. Although he started having some doubts about Shi Feng’s identity, these were all trivial matters. What was most important to him was defeating Shi Feng.

“No, you misunderstand.” Shi Feng chuckled. “I’m not requiring you to defeat me in God’s Domain. You just need to beat a friend of mine.”

“Sure.” Yan Wuming nodded. “Tell me their name. Once I reach Tier 3, I’ll beat that friend of yours in no time. Then, I’ll come to challenge you!” “Her name in God’s Domain is Violet Cloud.” Shi Feng inwardly breathed out a sigh of relief when he heard Yan Wuming agree to his suggestion. “You can head to Silverwing City to look for her. So long as you defeat her, I’ll accept your challenge.” Since a talent like Yan Wuming had come knocking on his door, Shi Feng naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity slip by. If he could rope Invincible Swallow into Zero Wing, it would be akin to adding wings to a tiger. The overall strength of the Guild’s top combatants would soar.

“No problem! I’ll seek her out afterward!” Yan Wuming responded without hesitation, his expression still as confident as before.

However, after hearing Shi Feng’s suggestion, Kerui looked at Yan Wuming with slightly different eyes.

Now, there was a hint of pity in her gaze. I hope you don’t despair too much when you meet with Violet Cloud, Kerui silently prayed for Yan Wuming.

Kerui had witnessed Violet Cloud in action. Even the old monsters of Super Guilds couldn’t outmatch her. In fact, even Mythology’s Divine Spear Demon only managed to fight her to a draw.

At this time, there were most likely only a handful of people capable of defeating Violet Cloud.

“Let’s go.”

Shi Feng couldn’t help shaking his head and chuckling when he noticed Kerui secretly praying for Yan Wuming. He then walked toward the distant street.

When Shi Feng said he would get himself registered now, Kerui’s face immediately shone with excitement. She then dragged Shi Feng toward the tallest building, situated at the foot of the mountain. Yan Wuming remained by the platform, waiting for someone to guide him.

As Shi Feng walked along the streets on the levitating mountain, he could feel his mind and body being enriched. He also started adapting to the tripled gravity here.

“So, this is the real Upper Zone?”

Shi Feng couldn’t help his shock.

Ordinary people would have difficulty even moving their bodies under tripled gravity. Shi Feng could shrug off the effects of the higher gravity due to his astonishing physical fitness. Even so, he still felt very uncomfortable in such an environment.

However, after stepping onto the mountain, the discomfort disappeared. It was as if there was a special energy source constantly enriching his weakened body. Meanwhile, this steady cycle of exhaustion and replenishment also served to strengthen his physique continually.

His arduous physical training regimen in the outside world was basically a joke in the Upper Zone.

If all Upper Zone residents experienced such strengthening effects, so long as they did not suffer any injuries, they shouldn’t have any problems living up to 120 years old.

“Do you now understand how different the Upper Zone is from the world you know?” Kerui asked, smiling. “Everyone living here is growing physically stronger by the moment. Even without intensive training, the physical fitness of people living here can quickly rival that of Henglian masters.

“According to the rumors floating about in the outside world, the lifespan of people living in the Upper Zone has reached 150 years. In reality, that is only the lifespan of those living in the Upper Zone’s base layer. You must’ve noticed the mountainside and summit, as well. Those are the middle and top layers. The people residing there possess truly astonishing physical fitness and lifespans. The average lifespan in the middle layer is 180 years, while in the top layer, it’s 200 years. This is already beyond human limits.

“In ancient times, 200 years was already enough for a change in dynasties. On the other hand, those living at the top would only be entering their prime after reaching 120 years old.”

Speaking up to this point, Kerui gazed at the mountaintop, full of yearning.

“The Upper Zone’s houses are stratified?” Shi Feng asked strangely.

“Of course. There is only so much space on this mountain. Even with the Boulder Corporation’s wealth and status, we can only live in the base layer. The middle layer isn’t a place one can live in just by having wealth and status,” Kerui grumbled in frustration. “If you want to live in the middle layer, your authority in the Upper Zone must reach a certain level. For example, you currently already have Grade 1 authority.

“Grade 1 authority is the highest authority available in the base layer. If you manage to elevate your authority level to Advanced Grade, you can live in the middle layer.”

“What do you mean by these authority levels?” Shi Feng asked in confusion.

He roughly understood the purpose of the Upper Zone’s authority levels. However, he still didn’t know the exact details.

“Right, I haven’t told you the details yet.” After a slight pause, Kerui continued, “Money and status are the least important things in the Upper Zone. What’s most important is your mental strength and authority level.

“Authority in the base layer is divided into three levels. The higher your authority, the better the items you can buy and exchange from the Green God Company. You can think of the Upper Zone as the Green God Company’s trading market. Grade 3 authority is the lowest, and the items you can purchase at this authority level are also of the most inferior quality. However, it is still many times better than what people without authority can get. At the very least, you have the right to purchase basic housing in the base layer. You won’t need to pay astronomical prices to rent a house.

“After reaching Grade 2 authority, you can purchase items that normally are not available in the outside world; for example, the Life Potion that only appears during the Green God Company’s auctions. At Grade 2 authority, you can also purchase villas in the base layer and have an independent private space. “At Grade 1 authority, things start to get amazing. Not only will there be more items available for purchase, but you can also participate in the Green God Company’s contribution competition, which takes place every three months. So long as you rank within the competition’s top three, you’ll receive permission to live in the middle layer for three months.

“You’ve already seen the benefits available in the base layer. Well, the middle layer’s benefits are even more exaggerated. Anyone who visits the middle layer once wouldn’t wish to leave. Just like your current self, after tasting the base layer’s benefits, you wouldn’t want to live in the outside world anymore. Moreover, you can purchase items beyond your imagination in the middle layer. According to rumors, the Green God Company’s Life Water can be bought there. “Life Water is much stronger than Life Potion. Supposedly, it can perfectly repair any damage to the body and even increase a person’s lifespan.”

At this point, Kerui shook her head and sighed helplessly.

For people living in the Upper Zone’s base layer, their yearning for the middle layer was akin to the yearning outsiders had for the Upper Zone. However, let alone ascending to the middle layer, just gaining Grade 1 authority was already a challenge for most people. Life Water? Shi Feng couldn’t help being shocked. He never thought that there would be something even more potent than Life Potion. Moreover, it was something that could perfectly heal all injuries. If that’s true, healing Gentle Snow’s and Aqua Rose’s mental injuries shouldn’t be a problem.

“How do I participate in this contribution competition?” Shi Feng asked Kerui.

Initially, he only guessed that the Upper Zone would have a way to heal Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose. He hadn’t been confident before. Now that he knew there was a way to do so, what he needed to do next was simple.

“You want to take part in it?” Kerui was stunned by Shi Feng’s question. “Do you know what kind of people participate in that competition?”

“What?” Shi Feng asked curiously.

“Almost every one of them is the heir of a major corporation. Moreover, they are the best among their generation,” Kerui said slowly. “You can’t even begin to imagine the resources they have at their command. Currently, you don’t even have the one million trade points required to purchase an ordinary house in the base layer, let alone obtaining the Green God Company’s contribution points. “At Grade 1 authority, you can exchange up to 1,000 trade points per day for 10,000 Credits per point. You can also find work in the Upper Zone or complete tasks to earn trade points and minimal contribution points.

“Do you know how difficult it is to earn the Green God Company’s contribution points? That’s not something that can be bought with money. You have to trade rare resources or help the Green God Company discover exceptional talents to obtain these points. It’s impossible for you.”

Shi Feng had a headache when he heard Kerui’s explanation. He never thought that the competition’s difficulty would be so high.

For the current Zero Wing, securing rare resources in the real world was simply a dream. As for helping the Green God Company discover talents, that was most likely even more difficult than securing rare resources. “Wait, no. It’s not absolutely impossible,” Kerui said after something occurred to her. “Recently, the Green God Company suddenly began purchasing God’s Domain’s Seven Luminaries Crystals in bulk. Moreover, they’re offering lucrative exchange rates. One unit of Seven Luminaries Crystal can be exchanged for 1,000 trade points and ten contribution points. However, for the current Zero Wing, ranking in the competition is still a pipe dream. “The current competition has been going on for nearly a month already; the last-place participant has accumulated 16,000 contribution points, while the first-place participant has accumulated 110,000 points. Even if you sold Zero Wing now, you still wouldn’t have enough Seven Luminaries Crystals to rank within the top three.”

No wonder so many corporations suddenly decided to enter God’s Domain. So, they did it for the Seven Luminaries Crystals? Shi Feng suddenly had an epiphany and inwardly celebrated this discovery.

For the various major corporations, money wasn’t a problem. However, money wasn’t enough to enter the Upper Zone’s middle layer. Various rare resources were necessary. Meanwhile, God’s Domain’s Seven Luminaries Crystals were undoubtedly easier to obtain than the various rare resources the Green God Company required.

Upon seeing that Shi Feng still hadn’t given up, Kerui shook her head and pointed at the 100-story building nearby, then said, “If you are intent on participating, you can register there. The staff at the registration area will tell you how exactly you can acquire contribution

points.”

Shi Feng nodded in response, a plan having formed in his mind already.

If it were any other item, he would indeed have difficulty fulfilling the Green God Company’s requirement. However, Seven Luminaries Crystal was a different story. While acquiring Seven Luminaries Crystals wouldn’t be easy for him, he wasn’t exactly without options.

Afterward, Shi Feng followed Kerui into the Green God Company’s office building in the base layer. The Green God Company’s building had very few people inside. Even after arriving in the second-floor registration area, Shi Feng had come across only two other people. One of them was a 26-year-old beauty, while the other was Hong Xinyuan. From the humble way Hong Xinyuan was conversing with the woman, it was evident she held a higher position than Hong Xinyuan. Hong Xinyuan’s eyes even carried a hint of respect as he looked at her. “Kerui, you’re finally here.” Hong Xinyuan breathed out a sigh of relief when he saw Kerui and Shi Feng enter the registration area. He then asked strangely, “Where’s Muxin? Didn’t she come with you?”
