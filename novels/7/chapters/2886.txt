Chapter 2887 – Powerful Mental Strength Master

When Elder Qi and the others collapsed, one after another, in the plaza, they quickly attracted the attention of the surrounding people. The small plaza grew noisy for a time as the passersby gathered around these collapsed experts and discussed among themselves.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Shi Feng exited the crowd in the meantime, his departure going entirely unnoticed. He had practically zero presence, as if he was no different from the roadside trees and bushes.

He’s a mental strength master?!

Shock filled Fang Shihan’s eyes as she switched her gaze between Shi Feng and Elder Qi’s group. She felt like her world had just come crashing down on her.

Apart from Shi Feng being a mental strength master, she could think of no other explanation for how he had defeated a force of eight grandmasters and six half-step grandmasters so easily.

Despite knowing this, Fang Shihan still couldn’t bring herself to believe Shi Feng was a mental strength master.

Mental strength masters were big shots even in the Upper Zone, and every one of them lived in the middle layer. Numerous organizations based in the Upper Zone tried to curry favor with these individuals.

All of these powerhouses had reached the level of a mental strength master only in their thirties or later. On the other hand, how old was Shi Feng now?

Not to mention, according to Fang Shihan’s investigations, when Shi Feng first entered the Upper Zone several weeks ago, the Green God Company had evaluated his mental strength as Special Grade only. He had still been a long distance from Master Grade. When Shi Feng arrived in front of Fang Shihan, she finally snapped out of her daze. She then scrutinized him as if she was meeting him for the first time. “Has your mental strength...reached the master level already?” Fang Shihan asked despite herself.

Although she was already certain Shi Feng was a mental strength master, she still couldn’t believe that someone could reach this level before 25.

If news of this matter spread, it would shake the entire Upper Zone. Even the Green God Company’s executives would take an interest in Shi Feng once they learned of his potential.

Meanwhile, the Green God Company’s executives were existences even mental strength masters wanted to befriend. These executives helmed the various Upper Zones, individuals standing at the top of the Upper Zone!

“I had the fortune of achieving a breakthrough recently.”

Shi Feng nodded, not bothering to conceal this fact. He then turned to look at the collapsed experts in the plaza, an indescribable feeling appearing in his heart.

Previously, when he had first become a mental strength master, he had noticed that his body’s physical fitness had improved significantly. The sharpness of his perception had also become far superior to before.

However, only after clashing with Elder Qi and the others did Shi Feng realize how powerful and frightening mental strength masters could be.

Mental strength masters might be only slightly superior to Henglian grandmasters in physical fitness, but their control over their bodies reached an incredible level. Not only could they control the fine movements of muscles and the physical body, but they could also exert much greater control over their brains.

While in combat, Shi Feng had managed to accelerate his thought processes by more than tenfold. In his eyes, Elder Qi and the others had looked like they were moving in slow motion. After including his enhanced perception of his surroundings, let alone dodging the eyesight and senses of several grandmasters, he could even replicate God’s Domain’s Void Steps momentarily.

It was no wonder the Upper Zone’s various organizations feared mental strength masters so much.

Shi Feng also felt fortunate that he had been cautious and stayed indoors for the past few weeks. Otherwise, he might’ve really ended up in trouble. After all, killing a lone grandmaster-level expert was child’s play for a mental strength master.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng’s admission, Fang Shihan was momentarily at a loss for words.

Originally, she had hoped to acquire a portion of Zero Wing City’s resources by offering Shi Feng protection. In doing so, she could increase her authority within Mythology and solidify her position as the First Vice Guild Leader.

Now, her plan was nothing but a joke.

There was no way a mental strength master would fear another mental strength master. More importantly, with how young Shi Feng was, once the Green God Company found out about his achievement, the company would undoubtedly place heavy importance on him. The status he would enjoy at that time would far exceed Fu Jiuzhong’s. After all, the Infinity Master was already an old man and showed precious little signs of improvement nowadays. So long as Fu Jiuzhong wasn’t a fool, he would give up on revenge against Shi Feng. On the contrary, he might even try to mend his relationship with Shi Feng. After all, the life of mental strength masters in the Upper Zone’s middle layer wasn’t as smooth sailing as others thought.

Looking at the vacant expression on Fang Shihan’s face, Shi Feng asked strangely, “The trouble has been dealt with already. Do you still see a problem in this, Miss Fang?”.

Fang Shihan recovered from her stupor at Shi Feng’s words. Putting away her previous nonchalant attitude, she said respectfully, “You jest, Master Shi. The powers behind those experts will be scared stiff once they hear about your current status and identity. How could they possibly cause you any more problems?” “Is that so?”

Shi Feng felt a little awkward when Fang Shihan suddenly spoke to him respectfully. Her passionate gaze, in particular, was as if she had just seen an absolute beauty; it gave him an uncomfortable feeling.

“Master Shi, my visit this time isn’t for anything significant.” After observing Shi Feng a little while longer, Fang Shihan revealed a rare smile and said, “I only wish to partner with Zero Wing on a personal level.” “A personal partnership?” Shi Feng wasn’t particularly surprised by these words. Calmly, he asked, “May I know what kind of partnership you have in mind?”

Taking a deep breath, Fang Shihan said solemnly, “I am willing to invest 100 billion into Zero Wing to help develop all of the Guild’s necessary facilities and territories. Simultaneously, I can also provide ten reserve slots for the Upper Zone and 1,000 bottles of potions of various kinds. I will also bring a large batch of peak experts and over 300 plots of Land located in the NPC cities of both the eastern and western continents into Zero Wing!”

Shi Feng couldn’t help being tempted when he heard Fang Shihan’s offer. He then asked, “What are your conditions?”

The funding aside, just the 1,000 bottles of various potions, the large batch of peak experts, and 300 plots of Land were more than enough to elevate Zero Wing’s overall strength by a large margin. Zero Wing would instantly surpass ordinary Super Guilds. It would be a lie to say this offer didn’t tempt him.

The Lands of the western continent’s NPC cities, in particular, were things Zero Wing needed urgently right now. With these Lands, Zero Wing could maximize the use of its intercontinental teleportation array. The Guild might even be able to establish a solid foothold on the western continent in one fell swoop.

Seeing the interest in Shi Feng’s eyes, Fang Shihan replied, “Simple. Become my backer!”

“???!!

Shi Feng was slightly stunned as he looked at Fang Shihan, his mind failing to comprehend her words momentarily. What’s going on?
