Chapter 614 – Instructor Black Flame?

Silver Frost City, City Lord’s Mansion:

Inside an isolated room the size of a football field, numerous youths clad in standardized sportswear were nimbly evading air bullets coming from their surroundings while rapidly ascending a majestic staircase made of singularite.

The metal staircase consisted of 300 steps. With each step these youths ascended, the grimmer their expressions would become. Some youths would also become incapable of moving their feet after reaching the 100th step and beyond, and so long as any youth stopped moving, they would quickly be sent flying off the staircase by multiple air bullets. Then, they would quickly get back on their feet and resume climbing the staircase again.

Although most of these youths were under the age of 25, each and every one of them was a two-star grandmaster. Several youths had even developed their mental strength to the two-star limit grandmaster standard already.

However, compared to the youths continuously struggling to climb the staircase, the man with graying hair standing on the 298th step was a stark contrast. Even when struck by air bullets repeatedly, the man stood firm in his position. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When the air bullets struck the gray-haired man, they were like rocks hitting the bottom of the ocean. Their impact created neither any sound nor any ripples. It was as if these air bullets didn’t actually exist.

“The City Lord is incredible! I have to use all my strength just to withstand a hit from those air bullets, yet the City Lord can neutralize the air bullets’ impact simply by manipulating his muscles! Is this the strength of three-star grandmasters?”

“The City Lord is probably at the cusp of becoming a great grandmaster already. If he can take the final step, Silver Frost City will welcome a new era of prosperity.”

When the youths resting below the staircase looked at the man standing on the 298th step, passion and reverence burned in their eyes.

The man was Xiao Yihu, Silver Frost City’s legendary City Lord and the role model of countless geniuses and paragons.

Not only was Xiao Yihu a pseudo-great grandmaster, but he was also a member of the Galaxy Conglomerate’s esteemed Council of Elders. Over the centuries, he had nurtured numerous outstanding disciples, some of whom had become the core executives of upper-ranking hegemonic powers. A few of his disciples were even part of the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Council of Elders currently.

While the resting youths were trying to figure out how they could receive Xiao Yihu’s guidance, Xiao Yihu’s resting eyes suddenly snapped open. Then, in only a dozen steps, he arrived at the bottom of the staircase and looked at the young man who had just entered the room.

The young man had a fit body and a cold expression. The instant he appeared, all the resting youths in the room kept quiet and looked at the young man respectfully.

“Did something happen on Little Quan’s side, Jiancheng?” Xiao Yihu asked in a low voice as he looked at the young man approaching him.

“Nothing happened to Xiao Quan during his outing, City Lord,” the young man named Jiangcheng reported. “But something did happen over at Star Lake City.”

“Did the fifteen cities lose?” Xiao Yihu asked. Then, in a slightly angry tone, he continued, “What a bunch of useless imbeciles. Can’t they even complete such a simple task?”

“Not only did the fifteen cities lose, but Star Lake City has also been promoted into a second-tier city,” Jiancheng said, nodding. Then, he handed Xiao Yihu a report and continued, “Here are the details of the city battle. Zero Wing is much stronger than anticipated, and even Skystar City’s ace battle group has suffered defeat at Zero Wing’s hands.”

“Zero Wing is indeed strong. Old Feng has also finally gotten his lifelong wish. It’s a pity that he is unaware of how deep the waters of second-tier cities are,” Xiao Yihu nonchalantly commented after reading the report. “Regardless, tell Little Quan to focus on developing his mental strength and stop wasting time on trivial matters. The upcoming ranking battle between second-tier cities is what you all should be prioritizing.”

“Understood!” Jiancheng responded before taking his leave. He was not surprised at all by Xiao Yihu’s indifference toward Star Lake City’s promotion.

It was indeed unexpected for Star Lake City to get promoted to a second-tier city and for Zero Wing to defeat Skystar City’s ace battle group. However, compared to the vast Starlight Continent, their achievements remained insignificant.

It was especially so in Xiao Yihu’s eyes. In his opinion, all of the city battles taking place within Silver Frost City’s sphere of activity were nothing more than a fight between children. Even second-tier city battles were not an exception.

The only thing that Xiao Yihu was truly concerned about was the Starlight Continent’s Second-Tier Ranking Battle held by the God’s Domain Association once every decade. Everything else was of little significance.

…

Greater God’s Domain, Miniature Ancient World’s World Passage’s entrance:

“This should be the place Guild Leader Shi Feng mentioned,” Fire Dance, a Level 171 Assassin wearing a crimson leather jacket and a ponytail, said as she looked at the seventeen youths beside her. “Azure, you all best not mess around during training. You are here to accept Zero Wing’s training so that you can pass the ace battle groups’ selection, not to cause trouble.”

Fire Dance was acquainted with Azure Shadow’s group. They had met a few years ago. She had even trained alongside these youths under Mu Huangwu in the past. Therefore, she knew that these seventeen youths were rebellious individuals. It was especially so for Azure Shadow. Due to his extraordinary talent, he refused to obey anyone but Mu Huangwu in the Green God Corporation.

The Green God Corporation had hired many reputable instructors to reign in Azure Shadow’s rebellious attitude in the past. However, none of those instructors managed to last very long before Azure Shadow finished mastering all they had to teach. Azure Shadow had even gone on to defeat each and every one of those instructors in a spar, causing those instructors to leave with injured pride. This situation had given the Green God Corporation a huge headache.

“We know, Big Sis Fire,” Azure Shadow, a Level 173 Ranger, said as he smiled at Fire Dance. “But if we are superior to the person responsible for training us, what qualifications does that person have to train us? Not to mention, we even paid such an exorbitant price for this training.”

“I agree with Azure, Big Sis Fire. You are now a member of Zero Wing, so you get to join this training for free. But the rest of us had to pay a total of 170 God Crystals. If Zero Wing’s training turns out to be too simple, wouldn’t we have wasted all those God Crystals?”

Following Azure Shadow’s words, the rest of the youths also started to chime in. At this point, they could already imagine Zero Wing’s instructor leaving in dejection after losing to them.

“You all…” Fire Dance experienced a headache when she saw what Azure Shadow and the others were planning to do.

She was fully aware of the talent the seventeen youths possessed. If not for her having a fortuitous encounter and being with the Green God Corporation for a much longer time, she would have probably lost to Azure Shadow and the others in combat standards long ago.

It was especially so for Azure Shadow. The young man was practically a monster. Even when faced with complicated Advanced Silver Combat Techniques, Azure Shadow needed no more than a few tries to master them completely. He could even take things a step further and combine them to create his own exclusive techniques. At this point, only fifth-floor experts capable of predicting future moves could beat Azure Shadow in a contest of combat techniques.

While Fire Dance was conversing with Azure Shadow’s group, a cloaked Swordsman approached them.

Following this Swordsman’s appearance, Fire Dance couldn’t help but be stunned.

“Guild Leader Black Flame?”
