Chapter 3259 Chapter 333 – Divine Twilight Set

Star Lake City, Star Lake Training Center:

As the only training grounds for the Star Lake Legion, the Star Lake Training Center occupied a radius of one kilometer and was hundreds of meters tall. It could easily be regarded as one of the most majestic buildings in Star Lake City.

On a normal day, there’d be well over 50,000 people present in the training center. Apart from the Star Lake Legion’s participants, many powers from Star Lake City and nearby towns would send their youths here to receive training. Although non-participants would have to pay a hefty price to train here, youths who came here would benefit from receiving the Star Lake Legion’s basic training from a young age. That way, they’d have a much greater chance of entering the Star Lake Legion once they reached a suitable age.

Currently, inside one of the simulation training rooms located on the training center’s top floor, the Star Lake Legion’s Vice Commander Markless Blade was sparring with a woman.

The woman in question wielded a spear, and her presence could be felt from every corner of the room as if she was the absolute ruler of this room. Shortly after the spar began, the woman executed a flurry of strikes against Markless Blade, every one of her movements carrying frightening power. Markless Blade was utterly powerless to resist this flurry of attacks, getting knocked out of the fighting ring in the blink of an eye.

“How is it? How do I compare with Black Flame?” the woman eagerly asked as she looked at Markless Blade.

Markless Blade did not offer a response right away. Instead, he struggled for a moment to stand up and catch his breath. Then, looking at the woman in the fighting ring with a hint of fear in his eyes, Markless Blade said, “Can you stop getting me to be your sparring partner, Commander? If Black Flame has your standards, there’s no way I could have lasted so long against him.”

“How unfortunate. I thought he could have entertained me a little, but I guess he is still a little ways off,” Red Frost said as she turned off the room’s simulation function. Immediately, her weapon and equipment disappeared, leaving only a pair of pajamas. “But according to the information you provided, Black Flame should be nearing the fifth-floor standard already. With such strength, Leroja and that First Paragon are the only ones among your Heavenly Boa’s Seven Great Paragons who can fight him.”

“Is he that strong?” Markless Blade asked in a dubious tone. Although he had lost to Black Flame, that was only because of Black Flame’s sudden burst of power catching him off guard. Had he been prepared for the three slashes Black Flame had used to kill him, he was confident he could survive those attacks. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You are underestimating that sudden burst of power too much,” Red Frost said, looking at Markless Blade as if she was looking at an idiot. “Without a sufficiently high Concentration standard and absolute control toward mana, there is no way he could have executed three Saint-ranked Mana Techniques simultaneously. You would have long since lost if the two of you had the same Basic Attributes.”

After thinking it over, Markless Blade had to agree with Red Frost. The bonuses provided by Tier 5 Magic Equipment were far superior to any bonuses a Dark-Gold Immortal Set could offer. Had Black Flame been equipped with a piece of Tier 5 Magic Equipment as well, the outcome of their fight would have certainly been much more decisive.

“It’s a pity that this is the end of the line for him,” Markless Blade suddenly said in a lamenting tone. “The Guild has already decided to get rid of him for good. Big Sis Blood Arrow will definitely be making a move. Black Flame stands no chance against Big Sis Blood Arrow and her Divine Twilight Set.”

“Divine Twilight?” Red Frost was a little surprised when she heard Markless Blade’s words. “How generous of Heavenly Boa. Are you not afraid some Tier 6 expert might fall for the temptation and try to snatch it?”

The Divine Twilight Set was a four-piece Fragmented Legendary Set that was a replica of the Legendary-ranked Divine Sun Set.

This replica was the Heavenly Boa Guild’s greatest achievement. However, even after expending numerous Legendary-ranked materials and Inferior Divine Artifact-ranked materials, Heavenly Boa had only produced three Divine Twilight Sets.

Of these three sets, two were currently equipped by two Tier 6 powerhouses known by all in the Starlight Realm, namely the Second Vice Guild Leader of Heavenly Boa and the commander of Heavenly Boa’s fifth trump card legion.

So, for Heavenly Boa to let a Tier 4 player use one of its three Divine Twilight Sets was a huge extravagance.

“It can’t be helped. This is Big Sis Blood Arrow’s condition for participating in the Rookie Competition. Otherwise, she was going to join the preliminaries held in the empire and fight for a slot through there,” Markless Blade said with a bitter smile. “To ensure enough members can enter the official competition, the Guild has no choice but to lend the Divine Twilight Set to her.”

There were countless Tier 4 experts in the Myriad Foret Empire. Not to mention, due to the value of the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition, many paragons from long ago would also be making a reappearance, and nobody knew how many of these paragons existed. Even the mighty Empress Blood Arrow might get disqualified from the invitational competition’s preliminaries.

Heavenly Boa naturally wouldn’t let Leroja take such a risk. After all, this was the best opportunity to join the Galaxy Conglomerate. Every additional slot the Guild secured in the invitational competition’s official phase would increase the Guild’s chances of success.

Moreover, if Leroja had the Divine Twilight Set assisting her, she was practically guaranteed to get into the Rookie Competition’s top 20. If luck was on Heavenly Boa’s side, Leroja could even lead an entire party into the top 20. Hence, Heavenly Boa eventually agreed to Leroja’s demands.

“It seems the Rookie Competition is going to be boring,” Red Frost said, sighing.

Before Red Frost and Markless Blade could continue with their conversation, a knock suddenly came from the door. Immediately afterward, a silver-haired young man whose mental strength had reached the two-star grandmaster standard entered the room and quickly approached Red Frost. However, instead of speaking right away, the young man glanced at Markless Blade and revealed a hesitant look.

“Just say it. That kid won’t dare to spread anything he hears here,” Red Frost said, chuckling as he looked at the silver-haired youth. “I’ll break his legs if he dares.”

Markless Blade shuddered when he heard Red Frost’s threat.

Meanwhile, after getting Red Frost’s approval, the silver-haired youth said, “Commander, this just came in, but it seems something big has happened in the God’s Domain Association Building.”

“Something big? What could possibly happen in the Association?” Red Frost responded nonchalantly.

The God’s Domain Association was a training ground for newcomers. No matter how big of a fuss these newcomers made, it’d be nothing more than a commotion caused by children. She’d only be wasting her time paying attention to matters involving children.

“A monster!” the silver-haired youth said with a look of awe. “A monster that has never been seen in Star Lake City’s history has appeared in the God’s Domain Association!”

“A monster? How monstrous are we talking about?” Red Frost asked, her curiosity slightly piqued. “Could they be comparable to Shi Feng?”

“No, she’s even more monstrous than him, coming in 10th place on her first test!” the silver-haired youth said, a chill spreading across his body when he spoke about this achievement. “Every power in Star Lake City has probably set their sights on her already. I think even the City Lord got startled by this matter…”

As soon as the silver-haired youth finished speaking, silence suddenly descended upon the training room.

After the silence lasted for a moment, Red Frost stared at the silver-haired youth with widened eyes and asked, “What did you say? Say it again!”

“That monster came in 10th place in the selection on her first test. By now, every power in Star Lake City has probably set their sights on her already,” the silver-haired youth repeated. “Commander, what should we do?”
