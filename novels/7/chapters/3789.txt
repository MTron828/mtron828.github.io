Chapter 864 – Empress’s Relic

No wonder Aurebeth had such a good relationship with Holy Dragon Spear.

When Shi Feng saw the World’s Scar on the exchange list, he suddenly realized why Aurebeth had steadfastly supported the Holy Dragon Spear adventurer team in his previous life. Even when Holy Dragon Spear was besieged by three of the Holy Race’s royal powers, she had not hesitated to help the adventurer team and sustain heavy damage to her soul.

Shi Feng had to admit that Holy Dragon Spear was incredibly skilled at making investments. It took a lot of courage and foresight to give Aurebeth the World’s Scar before she rose to prominence. Any other power would never have given her such a priceless treasure if they didn’t know her true potential. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Fortunately, Holy Dragon Spear’s bet had paid off in spades, as Aurebeth eventually became one of the Three Absolutes of the Eternal Realm. She was also someone who would always reciprocate kindness. Given the significance of a good sword to a Swordsman, it was only natural that she would go above and beyond to help the adventurer team.

Of course, there was a bigger reason Holy Dragon Spear was willing to give the World’s Scar to Aurebeth—the World’s Scar available for exchange was a damaged item; it wasn’t the complete World’s Scar.

Currently, the World’s Scar was only an ordinary Divine Artifact. Otherwise, there was no way the Greater God’s Domain’s number one Divine Sword would rank only fifth on the exchange list.

Shi Feng wondered if he could exchange the World’s Scar and use it to recruit Aurebeth. However, he couldn’t help but gasp when he saw how much it cost.

World’s Scar – 5,000,000 Undying Souls

It was an astronomical amount.

Subsequently, Shi Feng shifted his gaze upward to inspect the prices of the top four items and suddenly felt the 144 Undying Souls he obtained from killing the Dead Thousand-Eyed Demonic Hand were nothing but a joke.

Flame Dragon God’s Access Key – 10,000,000 Undying Souls

Primordial Dragon Tablet – 20,000,000 Undying Souls

Empress’s Scales – 30,000,000 Undying Souls

Flame God Set – 50,000,000 Undying Souls

While Shi Feng was lamenting his poverty, he suddenly received a system notification.

System: Kalisha has detected the aura of the Primordial Dragon Relic[1] Empress’s Scales. The second stage of the Inferior Mythical Quest Sanctuary’s Rise is activated.

Quest Content: Obtain the Empress’s Scales within 30 days and hand it to Kalisha. Rewards unknown. If you fail to complete the quest within 30 days, all your Attributes will be halved permanently.

The notification echoed three times in his head, its contents stunning him.

Crap! Shi Feng felt nauseous as he looked at the notification. Is Kalisha messing with me?!

Shi Feng hadn’t thought that his decision to come to the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury as soon as he collected enough Undying Souls would backfire.

Thirty days!

Thirty days weren’t enough time for him to collect even 10 million Undying Souls, let alone 30 million!

Even if Holy Dragon Spear, the Dragon God’s Palace, and the Divine Wing Dynasty joined forces, they still wouldn’t be able to collect 30 million Undying Souls in 30 days!

“Guild Leader Black Flame, would you like to enter the Underground City World with us?”

While Shi Feng was scratching his head in agony, a rugged voice suddenly entered his ears. Turning to the source, he saw Xiao Yilong, Red Frost, Twilight Leaf, Heiser, and Laura approaching him. Seeing as they were walking in a group, it was evident they had already formed a party.

“The Underground City World?” When Shi Feng heard Xiao Yilong’s words, some of his forgotten memories resurfaced.

The Underground City World was an area inside the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury. In addition to various precious resources, players could obtain many Undying Souls by grinding there.

However, the Underground City World’s resources were limited, and the dangers inside were several times greater than that of the outside world. Moreover, each player could enter the Underground City World only three times in their lifetime. Thus, very few players ever bothered to enter the treasury’s Underground City World in his previous life.

After all, the cost of dying in the Flame Dragon God’s Nest was incredibly high. Who would dare take such a risk?

Most importantly, by the time Holy Dragon Spear opened up the Flame Dragon God’s Nest to the public, it had long since explored the Underground City World and taken everything valuable. Even if other players entered the Underground City World, they wouldn’t get anything noteworthy. Rather than put themselves at risk for no reason, they would be better off grinding for levels outside.

“Mhm. We hear the Underground City World is a great place. Although it’s a little more dangerous, the harvest is amazing. It’s just that it costs one million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal per person to enter,” Twilight Leaf said, nodding. Then, slightly embarrassed, she continued, “The Great Commander and the others refused to take us outside with them because of our low levels, so we can only try our luck in the Underground City World. But Uncle Xiao and I only have tens of thousands of units, so we’re hoping to borrow some from you, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

When Twilight Leaf finished speaking, Xiao Yilong also couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.

The Flame Dragon God’s Treasury’s Underground City World might be a place of opportunity for them, but they couldn’t afford the exorbitant entry price.

It should be known that it only cost 100,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal for Tier 5 players to challenge their Tier 6 promotion. Even then, countless Tier 5 players already considered it a nightmare. One million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal simply wasn’t a sum the individual player could take out.

“No problem.” Shi Feng chuckled when he heard Twilight Leaf’s request. “I can give you the Seven Luminaries Crystals you need, but in exchange, I want 90% of the harvest we get from the Underground City World. What do you think?”

If he operated solo, he would not be able to collect 30 million Undying Souls in 30 days. However, if he had a party with experts like Xiao Yilong and Heiser, he might just be able to meet this unreasonable quota.

“I’m fine with that. I only care about leveling up,” Heiser stated.

“I’m fine with it, too.”

After pondering for a moment, Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf also agreed with Shi Feng’s condition.

Red Frost and Laura Crader could already be considered half-members of Zero Wing, so they naturally didn’t have any qualms about accepting Shi Feng’s offer. However, they couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng curiously, wondering how he managed to level up so quickly. After all, he was clearly at Level 200 not long ago. Yet, now, he was at Level 212 already. His leveling speed was simply astounding.

“Okay, let’s head to the Underground City World, then,” Shi Feng said as he sent a party invite to Xiao Yilong and the others.

…

Flame Dragon God’s Treasury, Underground City World’s Entrance:

As the monsters around the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury were generally around Level 240, players around Level 230 would only be a burden to teams eager to raid Bosses for Undying Souls.

Thus, many players around Level 230 were currently gathered at the Underground City World’s entrance, more than three times the number of players gathered in the central plaza. These players either sought to form parties with others or hire experts to escort them inside the Underground City World, their presence creating a lively atmosphere outside the Underground City World.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, although the Underground City World has five difficulty levels, even the easiest Simple Mode is extremely dangerous. Several parties that went for Simple Mode have already been teleported out of the secret land,” Xiao Yilong said solemnly as he pointed at the five teleportation gates that led into the Underground City World. “As a precaution, I suggest we test the waters first with Normal Mode.”

Five difficulty levels? Shi Feng was momentarily stunned as he looked at the five teleportation gates before him.

From what he could remember, the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury’s Underground City World should only have three difficulty levels: Simple, Normal, and Hard. Yet, there were now Nightmare[2] and Asura above them.

While Shi Feng was in a daze, a system notification suddenly rang in his ears.

System: You have received Dragon Princess Kalisha’s Blessing. You may activate the Underground City World’s God Mode difficulty. Do you wish to enter the God Mode Underground City World?
