Chapter 933 – Lunatic Black Flame

Everlasting City, Plot 095:

Countless particles of light rained from the sky following the barrier’s destruction. Although the barrier’s destruction produced no sound, the sight dumbfounded the players outside the barrier. This was especially so for the Holy Race’s various powers.

“It shattered? The World Idols’ barrier shattered?”

“I must be dreaming! How could a single Spell shatter the World Idols’ barrier?! It’s a prison that can trap even old monsters fully equipped with Divine Artifacts!”

“Could Evil Nature have used defective World Idols?”

The barriers created by World Idols were regarded as nigh impenetrable by the Holy Race’s players. In the long history of the Holy Race’s Greater God’s Domain, no player trapped by a World Idol barrier had ever escaped, let alone shattered it. Hence, when the Holy Race players saw the barrier shatter, their first instinct was to doubt it.

However, Shi Feng was unsurprised by this outcome.

Unbeknownst to the Holy Race’s players, there were plenty of ways to break a World Idol barrier in God’s Domain. Pseudo-Tier 7 Large-scale Destruction Spells were only one such method. Every one of the Three Absolutes in his previous life could single-handedly shatter a World Idol barrier. Evil Nature’s members would be delusional if they thought they could trap him with a World Idol barrier.

“Old Dragon, what is the meaning of this?! Why did the World Idols fail?!” Slumbering Vocalist demanded, glaring at the five players responsible for setting up the World Idols. “Did you all embezzle the Guild’s World Idols and replace them with defective ones?!”

The killing intent Slumbering Vocalist exuded was so intense that it was almost tangible; it made Old Dragon and Unseeing Demon’s other party members shudder.

“Commander Vocalist, we would never dare do that! The World Idols are only ever used for crucial actions! We would never joke around with our lives!” Old Dragon, the four-armed middle-aged man of Unseeing Demon’s party, explained hurriedly. “Not to mention, Commander Demon instructed us to prepare these World Idols for the Crystallians’ Ink Crystal! The commander would kill us had we brought defective ones!”

“Is it really not you?” Slumbering Vocalist asked for confirmation. Although he had already inwardly accepted the middle-aged man’s refutation, the implications of this situation were too grave for him to simply pardon them.

This was a sixth-floor expert they were talking about!

This was an existence regarded by the three races as a Mortal God!

Just a moment ago, Evil Nature had the perfect opportunity to do as it wished against one such existence. Yet, everything was now a mess. Evil Nature would become a joke among the three races if this situation was not handled properly. Even Slumbering Vocalist, the number one chosen one of Evil Nature, would not be able to shoulder the consequences of this situation.

As for recapturing Purgatory Jade, that would happen only in their dreams. After all, even an old monster like Unseeing Demon had lost to her. Without the World Idols restricting her, nobody could stop her so long as she focused on escaping.

“Commander Vocalist, look over there!” While Slumbering Vocalist was losing his mind, Bladeweaver, the Holy Scorpion Legion’s commander, suddenly pointed toward the shattered World Idol barrier. “Zero Wing’s members seem prepared to fight!”

“Prepared to fight?” When Slumbering Vocalist turned to where Bladeweaver pointed, confusion filled his mind as he saw Zero Wing’s team emerging from the raining particles of light and steadily advancing in their direction. “Is Black Flame out of his mind? Or does he think a Mortal God can solo two of Evil Nature’s trump card legions?”

Everyone had seen the strength Purgatory Jade had displayed against Unseeing Demon. After a thorough analysis of her strength, some powers had concluded that she could fight a top 50 Transcendent List expert fully equipped with Divine Artifacts, at best. If she had to fight two such experts simultaneously, she would face certain death if she stood her ground. This was also why Evil Nature had mobilized two trump card legions to Plot 095.

All of Evil Nature’s trump card legions were commanded by experts fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. Although the combat standard of these commanders might be inferior to Unseeing Demon’s, they were still experts who had mastered Peak Gold Holy Arts. Furthermore, the vice commanders of these legions were equipped with multiple Divine Artifacts and had mastered multiple Advanced Gold Holy Arts; they could slay fifth-floor experts as if slaughtering chickens.

Besides Purgatory Jade, the only noteworthy combatants Zero Wing had were Black Flame, Gentle Snow, and Phoenix Rain. Even if Black Flame could match one of Evil Nature’s commanders, two vice commanders should have no problem distracting him for some time. As for Gentle Snow and Phoenix Rain, the two remaining vice commanders should be enough to keep them busy.

Simply put, it was suicidal for Zero Wing to attack Evil Nature’s trump card legions.

However, before Slumbering Vocalist could wrap his mind around the situation, Shi Feng unsheathed the Shadow Incinerator hanging by his waist.

“Charge!”

At Shi Feng’s command, Zero Wing’s members charged Evil Nature’s legions, spearheaded by Dragon’s Crown’s chosen ones.

“Black Flame! Since you’re so eager to die, I’ll grant your wish!” Slumbering Vocalist promptly snapped out of his daze when he realized his opponent had a death wish. Turning to Bladeweaver, he said, “Commander Bladeweaver, I’ll have to trouble you with holding back Purgatory Jade! I’ll get rid of Black Flame first before joining you to deal with her!”

“Okay, leave it to me.” Bladeweaver nodded, not objecting to Slumbering Vocalist’s arrangement.

Slumbering Vocalist was Evil Nature’s number one chosen one. While his combat standard might be lacking compared to the Sun Dynasty’s Daystar, he was the undisputed number one among the Holy Race’s chosen ones when it came to offensive capabilities. He was among the few individuals among the younger generation who could match Unseeing Demon’s offensive capabilities.

With the offensive capabilities of Unseeing Demon, the 12th-ranked player on the Transcendent List, killing an expert ranked 281st on the human race’s Divine Glory List would be trivial.

As soon as Bladeweaver agreed to his suggestion, Slumbering Vocalist turned into a flash of light as he charged Shi Feng. He also spun his moon glaives, creating space-time storms that shredded everything in their path.

The move Slumbering Vocalist had just executed was his self-developed Fusion Holy Art. It was a fusion of Endless Blades and Spatial Imprisonment, the former being a Peak Gold Holy Art and the latter being a Profound Skill of his Divine Weapons. This Fusion Holy Art could match Unseeing Demon’s World’s Light in power.

If he were to use this move against a Swordsman, a non-Defense-oriented class, he could end the fight on the spot.

However, when Slumbering Vocalist’s space-time storms got within 500 yards of Shi Feng, a tall figure suddenly intercepted them. As soon as the tall figure appeared, he brandished his four sabers, creating over two dozen saber lights that merged into one and bisected the world before him. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Boom!

When the saber lights and space-time storms collided, both shattered and faded from existence. In the end, Slumbering Vocalist’s attack was neutralized, and the tall figure stumbled several steps backward before he regained his footing.

“You—! How—?!” Slumbering Vocalist stammered, at a loss for words, as he glared at Kowloon Demon, who had previously stood beside Purgatory Jade. “You’re also a Mortal God?!”
