Chapter 2873 - Present Zero Wing

Orc Empire, Silverwing City:

Droves of people came and went on the city’s main street. More than half of these people were NPCs from the neighboring kingdoms and empires.

Due to the World Passage’s opening and the invasion of the Outerworld’s player and NPC forces, both native players and NPCs had their range of activity restricted significantly. As the strongest city in the Orc Empire, one capable of fending off attacks from anything below Tier 5, Silverwing City had already become a mecca for the neighboring kingdoms’ and empires’ players and NPCs. Moreover, the news of Black Flame reaching Tier 5 sent the number of players visiting Silverwing City skyrocketing, resulting in overcrowding. All of these new arrivals sought to join Zero Wing and develop long-term in Silverwing City. At this time, Tier 4 experts radiating frightening auras appeared in Zero Wing’s Residence, one after another. The arrival of these experts instantly silenced the bustling Residence. Even the players lining up to take the test to join the Guild couldn’t help feeling frightened.

“What’s going on with Zero Wing? Why have so many Tier 4 experts gathered?”

“Are they here to maintain order since there are so many people applying to join the Guild?”

“Amazing! So, this is Zero Wing? I saw over 50 Tier 4 experts already! Some Super Guilds don’t have this many Tier 4 experts!”

“That’s not all of it! Look at their equipment! Every one of them has at least three pieces of Level 150 Epic Equipment! I wonder when I’ll be able to get one for myself?”

The eyes of the players lined up in the Residence’s courtyard widened in shock as they took in Zero Wing’s Tier 4 experts.

Previously, they had recognized that Zero Wing was a powerful Guild but felt that it had become a superpower in God’s Domain only because of Zero Wing City and Black Flame’s undefeated legend. Upon seeing the situation now, they realized that Zero Wing’s foundation was far more terrifying than they thought. Not only did Zero Wing possess far more Tier 4 experts than most superpowers, but these experts also had superior equipment standards compared to the various superpowers’ Tier 4 experts.

Currently, over 50 Tier 4 experts were gathered in the courtyard. This was a spectacular scene that those present would rarely get to see in their lifetimes. Not to mention, these Tier 4 experts were not repressing their auras at all. When these auras overlapped, they came together to generate an aura far more frightening than that of Superior Mythic monsters. Even Tier 3 experts shuddered involuntarily, forced to keep their distance from these Tier 4 experts.

“Why would Zero Wing gather so many Tier 4 experts here? Is it conducting a major operation or something?”

“This is indeed unusual. A Guild would gather so many of its Tier 4 experts in one place only for a special event.”

As the number of Tier 4 experts kept increasing, the non-members in the courtyard felt something amiss. Even Zero Wing’s members started growing antsy at this situation.

Ji Luorong looked at Violet Cloud, who had just arrived in the courtyard, and asked, “Big Sis Violet, do you know why the Guild Leader suddenly summoned us?”

“I don’t know, either. Big Sis Fire suddenly contacted me and told me to come here right away,” Violet Cloud replied, shaking her head. She then visually inspected Ji Luorong and exclaimed in surprise, “Luorong, your Mana Body is at the 110% Completion Rate already?! You’ve made so much progress!”

Ji Luorong had joined Zero Wing only recently. Although Zero Wing was much stronger than before, the fact that Ji Luorong managed to increase her Mana Body’s Completion Rate from under 105% to her current 110% proved that she was monstrously talented. “Hehe. It’s because of the Sword Saint Legacy Big Sis Fire gave me. If not for it, I would’ve taken much longer to reach 110%,” Ji Luorong said, smiling. Inwardly, she still felt a little delighted. After all, only a tiny number of experts in God’s Domain had managed to develop their Mana Bodies to a 110% Completion Rate at this stage of the game.

However, when Ji Luorong carefully sensed the Mana surrounding Violet Cloud’s body, her delight instantly vanished.

The Mana close to Violet Cloud had already liquefied. Although it was limited to a small portion of her Mana, it was still better than nothing.

The fact that Violet Cloud could accomplish this feat meant that her Mana Body’s Completion Rate had already reached 115% or above, according to what Shi Feng told them. She might’ve even reached the 120% Completion Rate already.

At this time, a masked, middle-aged man clad in black approached Ji Luorong. The aura this man radiated practically rivaled that of a Superior Mythic monster. This middle-aged man was none other than Crimson Mask, another Eternal Glory member who had joined Zero Wing. “Commander, why did Big Sis Fire suddenly call for us? Is something big going on?” Crimson Mask asked curiously as he looked at Ji Luorong 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I don’t know. Big Sis Fire only told me to come here as soon as possible and nothing else.” Ji Luorong shook her head. When she noticed the qualitative transformation of Crimson Mask’s demeanor, she couldn’t help sighing to herself ruefully.

Y.

Initially, Crimson Mask had opposed Eternal Glory’s joining Zero Wing. He felt that even without joining a Guild, he could still develop Eternal Glory to great heights. However, after a few bouts with Fire Dance and receiving a sound thrashing each time, Crimson Mask had changed completely. Now, he was even referring to Fire Dance as Big Sis.

However, Crimson Mask was much more fortunate than someone else, his fate considerably better.

Besides Crimson Mask, a lunatic named Invincible Swallow had come to Zero Wing to challenge Violet Cloud, and the fate this lunatic suffered was simply terrible. That fight could be described as an adult beating up a toddler. Afterward, when Invincible Swallow returned for a rematch at a later date, Violet Cloud just so happened to be out on an errand. Aqua Rose had been present at the time, so he challenged her instead.

After that match, Invincible Swallow began questioning his life. Even now, he was still training crazily in Stone Forest City’s Battle Arena every day.

While Zero Wing’s Tier 4 members wondered why Fire Dance had suddenly gathered them, a man and a woman approached the courtyard from a distance. These two people were none other than Shi Feng and Fire Dance.

Shi Feng was just walking casually, yet his steps distorted the space around him. It was as if the surrounding space couldn’t contain his presence and could crumble at any time.

In addition, as Shi Feng did not bother concealing his aura, everyone present gasped involuntarily when they sensed it. Although Shi Feng wasn’t directing any hostility at anyone, merely letting his aura radiate freely, the Tier 4 players present felt their bodies becoming incredibly heavy as if someone had tied metal weights to their bodies. As for the Tier 3 players present, they instinctively retreated from Shi Feng, not daring to move even an inch closer to him.

“He’s the Guild Leader?” Crimson Mask was shocked as he looked at Shi Feng.

Before today, Crimson Mask had only ever heard the name of Black Flame. From the gossip circulating inside Zero Wing, he knew that Shi Feng was Zero Wing’s number one expert and that his existence was the linchpin of the entire Guild.

Crimson Mask had thought that Shi Feng was only slightly stronger than Fire Dance. However, given this situation, Shi Feng wasn’t just somewhat stronger than Fire Dance. He was practically standing on a whole other level.

Aside from Crimson Mask, many of the Tier 4 experts who had joined Zero Wing recently were also stunned by Shi Feng’s terrifying aura.

After glancing at the crowd gathered, Fire Dance reported to Shi Feng, “Guild Leader, apart from the two Vice Guild Leaders and around a dozen others, who are currently occupied with important matters, all of the Guild’s Tier 4 members are here.”

“Not bad!” Shi Feng nodded in approval as he scanned the crowd before him.

A total of 59 Tier 4 players waited in the courtyard, their levels ranging from Level 148 to Level 156. More than half of these players had broken through the 100% threshold of their Mana Bodies already, with nearly 20 having reached the 105% threshold and seven at the 110% threshold. The seven to reach 110% Completion Rate or above were Violet Cloud, Fire Dance, Ji Luorong, Alluring Summer, Yan Tianxing, Yi Luofei, and Silent Blade.

One could consider this lineup a spectacular force at this stage of the game.

At this time, Cola, who had already reached Level 150, could no longer hold back his excitement, asking, “Guild Leader, are we going to raid the Orc Capital City?”

The Orc Capital City’s core area was a special secret land. The degree of danger in this secret land closely rivaled that of a God Mode Regional Dungeon. The loot inside was likewise incredible. However, one required a sufficiently large team of Tier 4 players to raid it. This was why nobody had succeeded in raiding it even now. Meanwhile, Zero Wing currently had 59 Tier 4 players and one Tier 5 player gathered. They were already more than qualified to raid the Orc Capital City’s secret land.

When everyone heard Cola’s words, they immediately grew restless.

After all, this was a Level 150-plus secret land they were talking about. They would definitely gain significant harvests if they raided it. “No, I didn’t gather you here for the Orc Capital City, but for something else instead,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

“Something else?” Cola and the others grew confused. “That’s right.” Smiling, Shi Feng explained, “To ensure our survival in the upcoming war and Zero Wing’s future development, I plan on annihilating Ancient Rock City and eliminating Beast Emperor from the Orc Empire!”
