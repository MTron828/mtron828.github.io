Chapter 379 – Laura’s Sword

A Legendary Mount? Thousand Scars fell into a daze when she heard Death Omen’s words. Is this the reason for his confidence?

Flying Mounts were incredibly rare. They were so rare that even Tier 6 experts would have difficulty getting their hands on an Extraordinary Flying Mount in the Greater God’s Domain, let alone Legendary Flying Mounts.

Throughout the entire Starlight Realm’s history, no more than 100 Legendary Flying Mounts have been recorded. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Legendary Flying Mounts were rarer than dragons. The value of a Legendary Flying Mount also wasn’t the least bit inferior to a contracted Tier 4 or Tier 5 Dragon.

Compared to a contracted Tier 4 or Tier 5 Dragon, a Legendary Flying Mount had a much greater chance of getting promoted to Tier 6. It should be that a single Tier 6 Flying Mount had enough HP and destructive power to rival several dozen Tier 6 players. Even a Tier 6 expert clad in a Legendary Equipment Set and wielding a Legendary Equipment could only hope to match a Tier 6 Flying Mount.

!!

Moreover, this was only under the assumption that the Tier 6 expert was fighting in the Greater God’s Domain or their native world.

If players tried to fight in a foreign world, they would be subjected to the world’s suppression. Under this suppression, a Tier 6 expert clad in a complete Legendary Equipment Set and wielding a Legendary Weapon could, at best, match a native Tier 6 expert wielding a Legendary Weapon. Needless to say, they’d be of no threat to a Tier 6 Flying Mount in such a weakened state.

Normally, so long as a power owned a Tier 6 Flying Mount, even conglomerates would have difficulty dealing with said power unless they had the strength to destroy an entire God’s Domain.

However, in the Greater God’s Domain, few powers possessed such strength. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

…

While Thousand Scars was in a daze, Zero Wing’s members couldn’t help but grow ecstatic as they rode on the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon.

“You’re amazing, Guild Leader!” Su Qianliu said excitedly as she admired the shocked expressions of the players stuck in the void sea. “The various powers are probably feeling dumbfounded right now.”

There were tens of millions of Mythic-ranked Void Sea Serpents on the void sea. This was a very frightening beast tide. With just the players and ships currently gathered here, there was no way to clear out these monsters in a short time. As a result, even the various hegemonic powers could only advance through the void sea at a snail’s pace. At this rate, even getting close to the Void Gods’ settlement would be a problem for the various hegemonic powers, let alone reaching it.

However, it was a different story for Zero Wing. Although there were also monsters blocking the sky, the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon could break through these monsters’ blockade easily. And once overtaken, none of these monsters could catch up to the Frostflame Dragon since their Movement Speeds were inferior to Flying Mounts. Because of this, the various hegemonic powers could only watch as Zero Wing’s team rapidly closed in on the floating island.

Meanwhile, after seeing the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon leaving behind the various powers’ fleets, Wu Xiaoxiao looked to Jun Luosha and smiled, asking, “Well? I didn’t lie to you, right, Big Sis Luosha? It’s not a loss for you to join Zero Wing. None of the various hegemonic powers can hope to compare with Zero Wing.”

“I truly did not think Guild Leader Black Flame would own a Legendary Flying Mount,” Jun Luosha exclaimed. “So long as this Mount reaches Tier 5, Zero Wing can indeed hold its ground against the Divine Seal Saint.”

Currently, the Miniature Ancient World only allowed foreign Tier 4 players to enter it. No matter how much power the Divine Seal Saint wielded, he could, at most, send Tier 4 players on the verge of reaching Tier 5 into the Miniature Ancient World and have these players quickly get promoted to Tier 5 once they entered the World Passage.

However, if the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon successfully got promoted to Tier 5, it’d be invincible among Tier 5 players. At that time, Zero Wing could put up a good fight even if it had to go up against an army of Tier 5 players.

And if the Flying Mount could get promoted to Tier 6, it’d be invincible in the Miniature Ancient World. At that time, even a force of 100 Tier 6 players would be nothing to it.

Of course, the Paimon Conglomerate would never mobilize 100 Tier 6 players into the Miniature Ancient World. After all, a force of 100 Tier 6 players was significant even to the Paimon Conglomerate. There was no way the conglomerate would commit so much combat power to a measly Miniature Ancient World.

…

As the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon shook off the various powers’ fleets, Dira’s party of five also took notice of it.

“Dammit! Damn these natives! How did a bunch of natives get their hands on a Legendary Flying Mount?!” Dira cursed, his eyes burning with jealousy as he looked at the rapidly approaching Frostflame Dragon.

As mighty as the Paimon Conglomerate was, even it only had four Legendary Flying Mounts in its possession. Moreover, they were acquired through many years of effort and accumulation. Meanwhile, apart from the conglomerate’s current helmsman getting to use one, the remaining three were in the hands of the conglomerate’s old monsters.

So, let alone Dira, not even his father, the Divine Seal Saint, got to use a Legendary Flying Mount. If his father wanted to obtain a Legendary Flying Mount, he’d either have to wait until the conglomerate found a new one or one of the conglomerate’s old monsters thoroughly retired from God’s Domain.

Yet, now, a measly native of the Miniature Ancient World actually owned a Legendary Flying Mount. This situation was utterly absurd.

“Rest assured, Young Master. Even if Black Flame has a Legendary Flying Mount, he still won’t beat us to the Void Gods’ settlement!” Platinum Behemoth, the leader of the Four Beast Warriors, said in a reassuring tone.

The other three Beast Warriors also nodded in agreement.

The closer they got to the Void Gods’ settlement, the more Void Creatures they had to face. When they got within 10,000 yards of the floating island, they already had to go up against over a hundred Void Sea Serpents and over a dozen Void Sea Dragons simultaneously. The only reason their party of five could still advance toward the floating island at a rapid pace was because they had four Tier 5 players in a battle array.

A Legendary Flying Mount might be powerful, but its massive body would also attract the attention of many Void Creatures. Take the current situation, for example. Even though the Frostflame Dragon had yet to move within 10,000 yards of the floating island, it already had to go up against over 400 Void Sea Serpents and over a dozen Void Sea Dragons at a time. With only a Tier 4 Legendary Flying Mount, Zero Wing’s team shouldn’t think of advancing any further once they reached the 10,000-yard mark.

“I know that,” Dira said before retracting his gaze and refocusing his attention on the floating island.

A Legendary Flying Mount might be tempting, but it was nothing compared to the Void Saint hidden class.

So long as he could become a Void Saint, he might very well have a chance of joining the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Senate. Even the Paimon Conglomerate’s helmsman would have to behave humbly in front of him if he succeeded. Obtaining a Legendary Flying Mount would also become a piece of cake.

…

A short moment later, the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon could be seen catching up to the Flying Mounts belonging to paragons such as Trecht and Saint Nine. At the same time, all these Flying Mounts entered within 10,000 yards of the floating island.

Meanwhile, as soon as these Flying Mounts crossed the 10,000-yard mark, each Flying Mount came face to face with over a thousand Void Sea Serpents and several dozen Void Sea Dragons. Trecht and the other paragons could feel their scalps tingling when they saw how many enemies they had to go up against. It was especially so when they saw how many Void Sea Dragons stood in their way.

The Void Sea Dragons were not only Superior Mythic monsters but also Void Sea Creatures. Even players with Tier 5 combat power could, at most, resist the attacks of two or three Void Sea Dragons simultaneously. They would instantly fall if they had to go up against several dozen simultaneously.

At this time, Trecht and the other paragons weren’t the only ones feeling the pressure. Midsummer and the others riding atop the Frostflame Dragon also felt their confidence wavering.

“Everyone, get ready to defend!” Su Qianliu anxiously commanded as she readied the staff in her hand.

The Frostflame Dragon might be faster than the Void Creatures, but it still needed considerable time to maneuver its way across the monsters’ blockade. This meant that those riding on the Frostflame Dragon would have to survive the onslaught of several dozen Void Sea Dragons for a considerable amount of time.

“That won’t be necessary.” While everyone was getting ready to defend themselves, Laura suddenly stepped to the front of the crowd. Then, she calmly said, “All you need to do is stand still.”

“Stand still?” Midsummer and the others couldn’t help but be confused as they looked at Laura, failing to comprehend what the other party was trying to convey.

However, before the crowd on the Frostflame Dragon’s back could process Laura’s words, Laura suddenly unsheathed the longsword by her waist. Subsequently, all everyone managed to see was a blinding light appearing in front of them, followed by Laura returning her longsword to its sheath.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

When Laura’s longsword clicked into its sheath, blood suddenly burst from the bodies of the several dozen Void Sea Dragons in the distance. Then, these Superior Mythic monsters fell to the void sea down below one after another…
