Chapter 3803 - 877 - Pseudo-Tier 7 Concentration vs. Sixth-Floor Standard

“Guild Leader Black Flame?”

Xiao Yilong was dumbfounded by Shi Feng’s initiative to challenge Kowloon Demon. He couldn’t understand what was going through the other party’s mind.

Kowloon Demon’s combat standard was the best Xiao Yilong had ever seen. Even Heiser, a Half-step Mortal God, had failed to survive one move against Kowloon Demon. Moreover, Kowloon Demon likely hadn’t relied on his Basic Attribute advantage in the two times he one-shotted Heiser. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have offered to fight one of their party’s members with similar Basic Attributes. After all, this would almost guarantee Heiser could survive three moves against him.

Thus, Red Frost, who could similarly one-shot Heiser, should be the best candidate to trade blows with Kowloon Demon. Although having Red Frost fight Kowloon Demon right now would mean wasting 10,000 Undying Souls, it was much better than jeopardizing the whole party’s safety.

So, why was Shi Feng stepping forward right now?

“Guild Leader Black Flame, we should let Big Sis Frost handle this,” Heiser said anxiously. “Kowloon Demon’s combat standard has likely reached the sixth-floor standard already. Aside from Big Sis Frost, the rest of us will have difficulty surviving three moves against him.”

Shi Feng clearly hadn’t reached the sixth-floor standard yet. If he tried to fight a sixth-floor expert with similar Basic Attributes, it was unlikely he could last three moves.

“You want to fight me?” Kowloon Demon looked at Shi Feng in surprise. “It seems that you are quite confident. But do you really think you can last three moves against me despite not being a sixth-floor expert?”

When Shi Feng appeared, Kowloon Demon could immediately tell that the other party was not a sixth-floor expert. This was why he had reacted in disappointment.

At this point, Kowloon Demon was refraining from eliminating Shi Feng’s party out of respect for Red Frost, a sixth-floor expert like himself. Otherwise, he would have permanently erased the party from God’s Domain, regardless of how they ended up in the Nightmare Holy City Region.

As for why Kowloon Demon had offered this three-move agreement, it was only to determine Red Frost’s exact combat standard. He had never expected Shi Feng, who wasn’t even at the sixth-floor standard, to challenge him. This made him wonder if he had misjudged Shi Feng.

“I have a few tricks up my sleeve,” Shi Feng said calmly as he looked at Kowloon Demon. “While you might be a sixth-floor expert, I am confident I can last three moves against you under the same Basic Attributes.”

Under normal circumstances, Shi Feng could only rely on the Feather of Oath if he had to fight a sixth-floor expert who matched South Lake in Basic Attributes. However, he would prefer to avoid such a scenario if possible.

The Feather of Oath’s War Goddesses might be able to defeat Kowloon Demon, but they were unlikely to kill him. After all, players were not monsters; they wouldn’t fight to the death unless the situation called for it. If an expert like Kowloon Demon managed to escape, he would become an endless stream of trouble for his enemies. This was why the various apex powers in Shi Feng’s previous life generally chose to avoid confrontation with the Three Absolutes.

An apex power might have the means to defeat the Three Absolutes, but it lacked the ability to kill them. If it made an enemy of the Three Absolutes, its members would suffer.

Likewise, unless Shi Feng’s party had the means to kill Kowloon Demon, they would have no choice but to play by his rules. Otherwise, they would only suffer a bigger headache.

“Good! Let’s see if you can survive three moves against me!” Kowloon Demon’s expression darkened at Shi Feng’s words.

Immediately, Kowloon Demon brandished his four sabers, weaving a web of attacks and casting it at Shi Feng. The speed of his execution was so quick that few experts present managed to react to it.

Is this the move he used against me?

Heiser looked at the saber web solemnly. She finally understood how Kowloon Demon had managed to kill her before she could process what had happened.

Fast!

His attacks were too fast!

Both times she challenged Kowloon Demon, she started the fight with less than ten yards between them. As a result, his saber web hit her before she could react. Now, not only was she spectating the fight from a distance, but there were also 30 yards between Kowloon Demon and Shi Feng. This gave her just enough time to react to Kowloon Demon’s saber web, or more specifically, track his sabers’ movements, and this outcome shocked her. After all, Kowloon Demon was currently fighting with his Basic Attributes suppressed. She doubted she could keep track of his attacks if he fought at full strength, even if they had been 300 yards apart.

What speed!

Meanwhile, Shi Feng was also astonished by the speed of Kowloon Demon’s attacks. If not for his Pseudo-Tier 7 Concentration, which enabled him to perceive time flow at a slower rate, he would have had difficulty keeping up with the other party’s speed.

Without hesitation, Shi Feng executed Sword’s Orbit with the Shadow Incinerator and the Winter of Eternal Night.

Clang… Clang… Clang…

A series of metal collisions sounded in the hall in quick succession. The frequency of the collisions was so high that it felt like hundreds of weapons were clashing simultaneously. The collision of the sabers and swords also produced numerous sparks that illuminated the entire hall and shockwaves that forced many Level 230, Tier 6 players back a step.

“Are they human?”

“Heavens! I’m Level 235, yet I can’t even stand steadily right now! How strong are their attacks?!”

The spectators in the hall were stunned by the repercussions of the clash. Shi Feng and Kowloon Demon had traded only one move, yet that was enough to turn the library’s first-floor hall into a void battlefield. The power of their attacks was so great that it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to consider them Humanoid Bosses.

“You are good. I hadn’t expected you to keep up with my speed,” Kowloon Demon said as he looked at Shi Feng in surprise. He hadn’t thought a non-sixth-floor expert like Shi Feng could keep up with his reaction speed. Moreover, Shi Feng had accurately blocked every one of his attacks. “But how will you fare against my next move?”

After saying so, Kowloon Demon swung his four sabers in unison, creating over two dozen saber lights that merged into one and split the hall in half.

When Shi Feng saw the oncoming saber light, he dared not hold back anymore. Immediately, he activated the Miniature Abyssal World and swung the Shadow Incinerator, creating a full moon.
