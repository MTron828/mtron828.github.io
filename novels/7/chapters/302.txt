Chapter 303 - Hold Nothing Back

Deep inside the Silverleaf Forest...

“Boss, I don’t know what’s going on with Zero Wing, but they’ve retreated from Silverleaf Forest’s entrance,” an Assassin who used Stealth to stalk Zero Wing’s troops reported in the team chat. “It seems that they’re giving up on trying to get in.”

“Hahaha! That Black Flame made such a bold statement, yet, now, he’s fleeing with his tail between his legs? If we upload this news to the forums, he will definitely become a laughing stock!” South Wolf laughed loudly when he received this report.

Lone Tyrant’s lips curled into a sneer as well, saying contemptuously, “Zero Wing is just a gathering of nobodies. Since the very beginning, they have never stood a chance at victory. They should consider themselves lucky. If they waited until we finished wiping out Zero Wing’s core team, we would have turned around and begun a pincer attack on them with World Dominators. At that time, even their remaining three to four thousand members would have no hope, and Zero Wing would utterly disappear from White River City.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Guild Leader Tyrant is as amazing as expected. It turns out that you had such a plan readied as well; no wonder you are an expert capable of competing with Gentle Snow over White River City. Not only do you possess extraordinary strength, but your intellect is also at the top of White River City!” South Wolf flattered as he came to a realization. “As long as you can remove Zero Wing’s name from White River City, the only obstacle in your way will be Ouroboros. However, with Dark Star and World Dominators working together, even the team led by Gentle Snow would no longer pose a threat. At that time, Guild Leader Tyrant would become the true overlord of White River City.”

“It’s still too early to make such claims.” Lone Tyrant chuckled as pleasure filled his heart. He then continued, saying, “Ultimately, Gentle Snow is a well-known expert and leader in the virtual gaming world. I’m afraid that I’ll need more strength before I can chase her out of White River City. When the time comes, it will also depend on whether or not Underworld plays its part.”

“Hahaha! Guild Leader Tyrant can rest assured! As long as Dark Star possesses a high chance of becoming the overlord of White River City, Underworld will invest greatly in it. When the time comes, Underworld will send even more experts to help Dark Star solidify its position as overlord.”

South Wolf laughed, answering with certainty.

“With your word, South Wolf, I can rest assured.” Lone Tyrant laughed with South Wolf.

Currently, confidence regarding Dark Star’s future filled Lone Tyrant.

“Now that Zero Wing has given up on saving Fire Dance and the core members, although I pity them slightly, we should still quickly end their lives.” When South Wolf thought of Fire Dance’s sexy body, a lecherous smile unconsciously appeared on his face.

Elsewhere, Fire Dance and her group were currently in a very precarious situation. Players from Dark Star had them surrounded, and although they had constantly carved out a path of bodies, they could not use Return Scrolls to escape. Dark Star had the Silverleaf Forest under siege, and all exits were blocked. If this situation continued, they would, sooner or later, lose their lives.

However, they could not afford to die. At this moment, there were only 30-plus players remaining in their team, and they were all were Red Names. As for herself and Blackie, their names were already close to turning black now. If they died, losing three or four levels would only be a small matter. The most crucial point was that they could not afford the loss of their equipment.

“Sister Fire Dance, what are we going to do now? The bastards from Dark Star have discovered our location again,” Lonely Snow asked. At this moment, he appeared to be in quite a sorry state. After being surrounded and attacked over a dozen times, his willpower had started to falter as well. Unfortunately, no matter what they did, they could not find a way to escape from Dark Star.

“Let’s retreat first, then talk. Aqua Rose and the others are currently breaking through the entrance now. Moreover, they also have a large stock of supportive tools, so they can definitely break past Dark Star’s blockade. We just need to hold on for a little while longer before we’re rescued.” Fire Dance had also racked her mind, trying to think of a way to escape. However, Dark Star simply had too many players. No matter how they tried to run, another group of players always waited for them. If not for the fact that their equipment and techniques were so impressive, they would have long since died.

Just as everyone was desperately running for their lives, Shi Feng contacted Fire Dance and suddenly joined the team.

“Guild Leader!”

“Guild Leader! You’re finally here!”

A glimmer of hope immediately flared in Blackie’s heart when he noticed Shi Feng join the team. Blackie’s opinion of Shi Feng had reached blind worship long ago, and he believed that there was nothing that Shi Feng could not accomplish.

In fact, Blackie wasn’t alone in having such an opinion. Everyone in the core team thought so as well. Meanwhile, the originally gloomy atmosphere instantly dispersed upon Shi Feng’s arrival.

“Guild Leader, you’re even more amazing than the Fountain of Life! By simply joining the team, you have caused everyone’s spirits to recover instantly; their fighting powers have doubled!” Fire Dance joked.

“Hahaha! I never knew I had such an effect!” Shi Feng laughed.

They all could not help but laugh with him.

Instantly, the atmosphere relaxed.

“How are things on your side?” Shi Feng asked.

“Dark Star has us forced into a corner, and it’s practically impossible for barge through any of the exits. At most, I think we have another half an hour before we’ll have to make a final stand against them...”

Fire Dance gave Shi Feng a brief explanation of their current position. Meanwhile, as a veteran of the battlefield, Shi Feng quickly grasped the general situation.

If Fire Dance and her group faced Dark Star’s 3,000 players in direct combat, the conclusion would be obvious. Even if they had Shi Feng with them, the result would be the same.

After a long moment of silence...

“I understand. Head to these coordinates. I’ll meet you guys there,” Shi Feng said.

Now that Fire Dance’s group had been forced to such a corner, even Shi Feng could not turn the tides. Dark Star had 3,000 players fighting for them, not just one or two hundred. At this stage of the game, most players should have already learned quite a few Skills, and of them, there would definitely be a few lifesaving skills. Furthermore, their fighting techniques would have improved greatly. It was no longer possible for Shi Feng to slaughter them by the hundreds as he had with Martial Union. Fortunately, Shi Feng was very familiar with the Silverleaf Forest. After giving it some thought, he concluded that there was only one location Fire Dance and the others could head to survive.

The chances for survival was less than 30%.

However, a 30% chance of survival was far better than none at all. After all, if they faced Dark Star’s 3,000-strong army, they would die ten out of ten times.

Hopefully, Aqua Rose can take action quickly. Otherwise, we really will suffer a total defeat.

Following which, Shi Feng disconnected his call with Fire Dance. He then activated the Seven Luminaries Ring’s Space Movement once more, teleporting to the meeting location that he gave Fire Dance’s group.

Although Guild War Orders could seal off the usage of teleportation scrolls, they were completely useless against the power of the Seven Luminaries Ring.

On the gravel road leading to the Silverleaf Forest, the players from World Dominators had already started battling the players from Ouroboros.

Throughout their battle, both sides had constantly sent for more reinforcements, involving more and more players in the fray.

Both sides were first-rate Guilds with extraordinary backgrounds. To hinder Gentle Snow’s advance, World Dominators had sent over 10,000 players to this fight. Meanwhile, Gentle Snow had even more players on her side. Currently, her army had increased to over 14,000 players. The intensity of the battle between these two Guilds far outstripped the battle between Dark Star and Zero Wing.

This massive encounter had shocked many players in White River City.

Just what was happening in White River City?

Why were four of the top six Guilds in White River City battling it out against each other? Moreover, it wasn’t just a minor skirmish between Guilds. These four Guilds had actually started a full-fledged war against each other, where only one side would rest when the other was obliterated.

Such a situation was simply unimaginable in other cities. Players were still in the initial stages of God’s Domain, and currently, every Guild in God’s Domain fully occupied themselves with raiding Dungeons and development. Yet, these four Guilds in White River City actually dared to start a full-fledged war. Regardless of which side won or lost, they would all be losers in God’s Domain.

“Snow, this war is getting out of hand. Both sides have already incurred over a thousand fatalities. If this situation continues, Emperor’s Light and the Assassin’s Alliance might be tempted to take advantage of the situation. I think we should retreat for now. After fighting for so long, we have fulfilled our duty to Zero Wing,” Zhao Yueru urged as she looked at Gentle Snow who currently issued commands.
