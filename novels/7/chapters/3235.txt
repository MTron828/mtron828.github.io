Chapter 310 – One Finger To Bring Down The Heavens

“This is indeed a tricky situation. I didn’t think she would meet Ocean Breeze of all people.”

Desolate Fury was greatly surprised when he saw the young knight displayed in the same magic mirror as Midsummer.

Ocean Breeze, the Knight of Thousand Winds, ranked 50th in combat power among the Myriad Forest Empire’s young experts. Although his rank wasn’t as high as Desolate Fury’s, he was an Anti-Magic Knight, the bane of all magical classes.

The Anti-Magic Knight was a Peak Class that could unleash an Anti-Magic Domain. Within his Anti-Magic Domain, all magic arrays would lose effect. It was a powerful counter against magical classes that relied mainly on Spells to attack.

!!

The Anti-Magic Domain would have been considered a perfect ability if not for its limited range. When used in the Greater God’s Domain, a Tier 4 Anti-Magic Knight could only extend their Anti-Magic Domain up to a 50-yard radius. So long as magical class players stayed outside the Anti-Magic Domain’s range, they could freely cast their Spells, and there’d be nothing the Anti-Magic Knight could do about it.

However, to make up for his Anti-Magic Domain’s lack of range, Ocean Breeze had learned an Advanced Silver Footwork. With the help of this footwork, it was practically impossible for any Tier 4 magical class player within his sight to keep their distance from him…

“Hahaha! I already said she won’t get into the top 20!”

Lightning Chaser couldn’t help but laugh when he looked at the magic mirror hovering in the air. Although he knew that Midsummer had incredible potential and could perhaps achieve a higher status than he could in the future, his mood brightened significantly when he saw that Midsummer was going to get disqualified in the first round of the preliminaries. Moreover, so long as Midsummer failed to get into the Rookie Competition’s top 20, her chances of getting into the Galaxy Conglomerate’s official competition would become very slim.

If Midsummer failed to become a silver member of the Galaxy Conglomerate, he would have plenty of opportunities to get his hands on her. After all, he knew Midsummer’s real identity. With the Extreme Eagle Corporation’s strength, there’d be nothing Midsummer and her family could do to resist him.

While Desolate Fury’s party members were talking among themselves, the other experts in the plaza also turned their attention to Midsummer’s fight.

“Isn’t that beauty the companion of that legend just now?”

“She has quite the rotten luck to meet the Knight of Thousand Winds right off the bat. It seems she’s going to get disqualified on the very first round.”

“You can’t really say she has bad luck. Many experts in the Ancient River Kingdom are currently targeting her because of Saint Three. Even if she didn’t come across Ocean Breeze this round, everyone she comes across would most likely make her a priority target.”

“You might be right, but getting disqualified in the first round is still a little miserable. I wonder if Ocean Breeze will show mercy? I heard that players he kills would typically have their souls put into a weakened state for half a month. If that beauty gets put out of commission for such a long period, she’ll most likely miss the Galaxy Conglomerate’s assembly.”

“You expect the Knight of Thousand Winds to show mercy? Are you dreaming? Ocean Breeze and Saint Three are good friends. He might show mercy to others, but he definitely won’t do so for that beauty.’

“He’s good friends with Saint Three? But Wu Xiaoxiao is a legend with an immeasurable future, while that beauty looks like she is close to Wu Xiaoxiao. Will Ocean Breeze really be dumb enough to offend a legend for Saint Three?”

The various hegemonic powers’ experts in the plaza engaged in an enthusiastic discussion as they looked at the magic mirror displaying Midsummer’s battle.

After Wu Xiaoxiao had revealed her 120% Epic Mana Body, the various hegemonic powers’ experts present conducted a thorough investigation of her background. So, they knew about the conflict Wu Xiaoxiao’s group had with Saint Three.

Originally, everyone had planned on doing Wu Xiaoxiao a favor during the preliminaries by ignoring Midsummer and Shi Feng should they come across these two people. However, it would seem that their hopes of doing the legend a favor might be dashed soon.

Out of all the people Midsummer could have encountered, she just had to meet Ocean Breeze, Saint Three’s close friend. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Now, whether Midsummer could pass the preliminaries’ first round depended entirely on Ocean Breeze’s attitude.

…

While the spectating participants in the plaza were engaged in their discussion over Midsummer, Ocean Breeze equipped the axe and square shield he carried on his back and slowly walked toward Midsummer, continuously closing the distance between them.

100 yards… 80 yards… 70 yards…

“You are terribly unlucky to meet me in the first round, little beauty,” Ocean Breeze said, chuckling as he looked at Midsummer, who quietly stood ahead of him. “Originally, I was planning on getting rid of that Wu Xiaoxiao permanently to get Saint Three to owe me a huge favor. I didn’t think I would meet you first. Moreover, it seems your Mana Body’s Completion Rate is also quite high. It should be above 115% already, right? In that case, I’ll give you two options.

“The first option is to tell me Wu Xiaoxiao’s real identity. Do that, and I will only heavily injure you. I won’t annihilate your soul, and you won’t have to waste all the effort you’ve put into developing your Mana Body.

“The second option is to restart a new account. Take your pick!”

“Soul Annihilation?” Midsummer was a little surprised when she heard Ocean Breeze’s words.

Soul Annihilation abilities were normally available to only Tier 5 existences or above. She didn’t think Ocean Breeze would possess such a frightening ability at Tier 4.

“You can only blame yourself for having poor luck. It was only a few days ago that I fully grasped my Soul Annihilation ability. Although this ability is useless against Tier 5 and Tier 6 players, it is enough against Tier 4 players,” Ocean Breeze said, nodding in delight.

Soul Annihilation abilities were powerful abilities that Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts used against lower-tiered players. However, because many kingdoms and empires prohibited high-tiered players from taking action against low-tiered players, The significance of Soul Annihilation abilities fell significantly in the Greater God’s Domain.

However, it was a different story for him. Thanks to his Anti-Magic Knight class, he had grasped a Soul Annihilation ability at Tier 4, and it was even effective against players of the same tier. This was why the paragons of many kingdoms and empires would try to befriend him.

Ocean Breeze admitted that an Epic Mana Body with a 120% Completion Rate might be frightening. However, he could also tell that Wu Xiaoxiao didn’t have very high combat standards. So, he guessed that Wu Xiaoxiao simply got lucky and developed her Mana Body to the legendary Completion Rate. As long as he could destroy Wu Xiaoxiao once, she would no longer be a threat to anyone.

“I have poor luck?” When Midsummer saw that Ocean Breeze was close to moving within 50 yards of her, she suddenly smiled. “Do you think you are very lucky?”

As soon as Midsummer finished speaking, the intensity of her aura and the density of the mana surrounding her suddenly skyrocketed. In the blink of an eye, a towering mana pillar rose from her.

A 100-meter mana pillar?! Ocean Breeze was stunned when he saw the mana pillar rising from Midsummer. Then, he looked at Midsummer in disbelief and asked, “You are also a legend?”

He had already found it shocking when he saw Wu Xiaoxiao revealing herself as a legend. He didn’t think that Midsummer, an ordinary member of the Purple Melody Alliance, would also be a legend. With this, he had seen two legends on the same day. Others would probably think he was crazy if he told them about this.

However, Ocean Breeze quickly recovered from his surprise and contemptuously, saying, “You have indeed surprised me, but death remains the only outcome awaiting you.”

He would definitely be experiencing a huge headache right now if Midsummer wasn’t a magical class player. Unfortunately for Midsummer, there was no changing reality.

Not only was Midsummer a Tier 4 Great Wizard, but there were also only 55 yards separating them right now. So long as he took one step forward, Midsummer would be within his Anti-Magic Domain, and he could do whatever he wanted with her.

After saying so, Ocean Breeze took a step forward, intending to put Midsummer within his Anti-Magic Domain.

“Is that so?”

As if to mock Ocean Breeze, Midsummer allowed the Knight of Thousand Winds to move within 50 yards of her while she pointed at the sky. Subsequently, a huge tear in space appeared in the sky and spewed gigantic fireballs out one after another, the fireballs covering a radius of over 500 yards.

Silent-cast twofold Tier 4 Curse, Starfire Shower!

Boom!

When the fireballs made contact with the ground, they instantly turned the battlefield into a sea of fire, the flames so bright their glow could be seen from across the entire island…
