Chapter 478 - Seven Ghosts

“Have they arrived as well?” Youlan’s beautiful eyes widened upon hearing Feng Xuanyang’s words, shock coloring her features.

Although the Underworld Guards were the core combatants of Underworld, they were not the peak combatants.

Even so, the Underworld Guards were only slightly inferior to the peak combatants of other first-rate Guilds; they were more than enough to deal with second-rate Guilds.

Since Feng Xuanyang had said as much, the new arrivals were not members of the Underworld Guards. Instead, they should be the peak combatants of Underworld, the Seven Ghosts.

“That’s right. To eliminate Zero Wing quickly and ensure that we obtain White River City, upper management has sent us two Ghosts. With the two of them, Black Flame’s good fortune will come to an end,” Feng Xuanyang laughed.

“Since two of the Seven Ghosts have arrived, Black Flame’s hunting spree will no longer be an issue. On the contrary, this is our chance.” Youlan nodded as she revealed a smile.

Underworld was a massive organization, and those who joined the Underworld Guards were already considered experts. Meanwhile, The Seven Ghosts stood out among the Underworld Guards and stood at the peak of the organization. The Seven Ghosts held very high positions in Underworld, and even Feng Xuanyang had to treat them with respect.

Every one of the Seven Ghosts was an extraordinarily talented expert carefully selected by Underworld. Moreover, they had received Underworld’s unreserved nurturing and hell-like training. Their strength had long since surpassed the realm of ordinary humans.

If several Ghosts worked together, even an expert like Summer Sunshine would be helpless.

Now that Black Flame was going all-out in his hunt of the Underworld Guards, this was very good news for Overwhelming Smile. If the two Ghosts found Black Flame while he was on his hunting spree, perhaps they could kill Black Flame and utterly destroy Zero Wing.

Just as Feng Xuanyang and Youlan discussed Shi Feng, the man currently faced off against two Underworld Guard parties in the Watch Cemetery.

“Good luck?”

“What an arrogant little brat!”

The two Underworld Guard parties glared at Shi Feng, before turning to each other, smiling.

The members of Zero Wing also watched Shi Feng, who currently hid his appearance under his black cloak, astonishment filling their eyes.

Shi Feng had accidentally appeared and claimed to have good luck. Did he not know that the two parties surrounding them were the famous killing gods? Every one of these players was a demon who could slaughter people without batting an eye. Those who encountered these killing gods had only one ending—death!

“We have to hold our ground. Our Guild’s Tier 1 experts are almost here. We’ll be saved as long as we hold on for a little longer,” the leader of Zero Wing’s team said, gritting his teeth.

A thread of hope appeared in the eyes of Zero Wing’s members. When they looked at the two Underworld Guard parties surrounding them, their gazes burned with fighting spirit.

“Oh? You guys must have a death wish. Old Six, you deal with these guys. I’ll deal with the new brat,” a youthful-looking Level 26 Swordsman named Fifth Ghost ordered with a deep voice. The youth was tall and robust, and he was currently garbed in golden battle armor.

“Brother Five, you’re too cunning! This is the first expert we’ve found after such a long hunt, yet you’re sending me to deal with the trash while you steal the expert for yourself!” the Level 26 Berserker named Sixth Ghost complained.

“That brat is a Swordsman. I’m also a Swordsman, while you’re just a Berserker. Naturally, I should deal with him. If we meet a Berserker, you’ll deal with them. Deal?” Fifth Ghost laughed.

The Berserker named Sixth Ghost could only nod in response. He then looked towards the Underworld Guards, saying, “Leave these people to me. You guys only need to prevent them from escaping.”

“Yes!” the Underworld Guards immediately took up their formation.

However, when Zero Wing’s members heard that the man named Sixth Ghost intended to deal with them alone, they rejoiced.

Each side had about the same number of players. If the enemy faced them as a team, they stood no chance. If only one person attacked, however, they could probably kill that player and escape.

“We’ll charge together. After we get rid of him, we can take the opportunity to break through the encirclement,” the Ranger team leader whispered.

At this moment, when Shi Feng saw Sixth Ghost approach the group, he suddenly said, “No, you guys aren’t his match. In a moment, run in the opposite direction. Elementalists, use Ice Walls and Frozen Circles while I hold them back.”

Zero Wing’s elite team was strong enough that they had a good chance of defeating any ordinary expert. However, the Berserker before them was not an ordinary player. The killing intent and pressure he radiated did not belong to an ordinary expert, so much so that even Shi Feng sensed danger from the Berserker. Moreover, when Shi Feng used Omniscient Eyes to inspect everyone’s data, Sixth Ghost’s data surprised him.

The Berserker named Sixth Ghost was actually a Tier 1 class. This was the first time Shi Feng had encountered a Tier 1 class belonging to another Guild.

The Swordsman named Fifth Ghost was also a Tier 1 class.

Judging from the respectful attitudes the Underworld Guard parties showed these two players, Shi Feng guessed that the two were not ordinary characters. They were definitely high up in Underworld.

Originally, Shi Feng intended to hunt down Underworld Guards. Now, however, rather of hunting a cat, he had found a tiger.

“Thank you for the warning. However, we are the elites of Zero Wing. Even if he is powerful, he can’t take us down easily if we work together,” the Ranger team leader said confidently.

However, before the Ranger could finish his words, Sixth Ghost had used Charge, leaving only an afterimage behind him. In the blink of an eye, Sixth Ghost arrived before Zero Wing’s battle-ready Shield Warrior. He then activated Cleave and slashed his saber down on the Shield Warrior.

Just as this Shield Warrior was about to block the attack with his shield, Sixth Ghost’s saber suddenly vanished. The saber instantly reappeared in the Shield Warrior’s blind spot and struck its target, sending the Shield Warrior flying backward. A damage of over -2,600 points appeared above the Shield Warrior’s head, reducing his HP by more than half.

The entire process was as smooth as flowing water. None of the surrounding Zero Wing members had reacted to Sixth Ghost’s attack. They could only watch as their MT was sent flying.

Six Ghost’s damage shocked Zero Wing’s elites. None of them could believe that a Berserker could actually deal over -2,600 damage to a Shield Warrior.

However, Sixth Ghost was not done with the Shield Warrior. Twisting his feet slightly, Sixth Ghost transformed into an afterimage as he weaved through the crowd of players. He arrived behind the still-airborne Shield Warrior and sent out another slash.

Nobody had ever expected a Berserker to be so agile. Although the entire process seemed slow, in reality, everything had happened in an instant.

Just as Sixth Ghost’s saber was about to strike the Shield Warrior’s back and end his life, Sixth Ghost suddenly spun and used Whirlwind Slash.

Peng!

Dazzling sparks scattered around him.

Sixth Ghost’s battle saber collided with a pitch-black sword. Meanwhile, the owner of this sword was none other than the mysterious newcomer–Shi Feng.

“Brat, you sure are in a hurry to die.” Six Ghost licked his lips, a hint of excitement appearing in his eyes as he smiled at Shi Feng. “Since you can attack soundlessly, you should have also reached that realm.”

If not for his many years of combat experience and his senses picking up on Shi Feng’s faint killing intent, he would not have detected Shi Feng’s attack. Fortunately, he sensed the attack at the very last moment and instinctively used Whirlwind Slash. Otherwise, Shi Feng’s attack would have been successful.

Other than his sparring sessions with the other Ghosts, this was the first time he had encountered such a situation.
