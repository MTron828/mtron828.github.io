Chapter 465 – Goddess’s Treasure

“Mr. Black Flame, you don’t seem very interested in the Goddess Treasure Chest,” Unrestrained Lionheart commented when he noticed Shi Feng paying more attention to the items dropped by the Holy Ancestor than the Goddess Treasure Chest in his hand. “It is only thanks to your leadership that we managed to secure the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s First Clear. How about I ask Vice Guild Leader Frey for permission to exchange one of the Boss’s dropped items for your Goddess Treasure Chest?”

“That won’t be necessary. Two items are enough for me,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

Treasure chests such as the Goddess Treasure Chest were also known as Divine Treasure Chests. Meanwhile, the value of a Divine Treasure Chest could range anywhere from an Inferior Legendary Treasure Chest to an Inferior Mythical Treasure Chest.

Although Shi Feng had no idea how powerful the Goddess of Space was exactly, after seeing how powerful the goddess’s doppelganger was, he was certain that the goddess was vastly stronger than the average Ancient God. Hence, it wouldn’t be surprising if the rewards inside the Goddess Treasure Chest rivaled that of Legendary Treasure Chests in value.

The only downside of Divine Treasure Chests was that each chest would only contain one item.

However, even if it was only one item, it was still a precious item from a Legendary Treasure Chest-equivalent. So, it wouldn’t be any worse than the items dropped by the Holy Ancestor. After all, the Holy Ancestor they killed here was heavily suppressed. Moreover, they had even relied on the Goddess’s Shadow to deal the finishing blow. In terms of value, the Holy Ancestor’s loot would, at best, rival the loot of an ordinary Tier 6 Holy God.

When Shi Feng finished speaking, many people in the hall had already opened the Goddess Treasure Chest they received.

Suddenly, silence enveloped the entire hall, which was followed by bursts of exclamations.

“Heavens! A Secret Treasure! I got a Secret Treasure from my treasure chest!”

“A Gold Combat Technique Legacy?! I must be hallucinating! I actually got a one-time opportunity to experience a Gold Combat Technique!”

Everyone who had opened their Goddess Treasure Chest couldn’t help but gasp when they saw the contents of their respective chests. Desolate Fury, Cross, and Leroja, in particular, revealed fanatical expressions.

A Legacy Pearl!

This was an item that could allow players to experience the combat technique recorded inside. Meanwhile, the combat technique recorded in their Legacy Pearls was none other than the Gold Body Technique Flowing Space.

Although the three of them were envious of those who had obtained Secret Treasures, the thought of exchanging their Legacy Pearls for a Secret Treasure never crossed their minds. As they had already made some progress in learning the Flowing Space technique, the Legacy Pearl was much more valuable to them than any Secret Treasure.

After all the effort they had put in previously, if they could experience the correct way of using Flowing Space even once, they would have at least a 50% chance of successfully learning the Gold Body Technique and reaching the technique’s first level, Stepping Space. At that time, their combat power would skyrocket, and they’d be able to hold their ground against fifth-floor experts. While they might not become the strongest, they would still be regarded as powerhouses in the Eternal Realm.

“We really lucked out this time, Big Sis Omen. Both of us actually got Combat-ranked Secret Treasures,” Thousand Scars said as she looked at the Secret Treasure in Death Omen’s hands. Then, she looked at her own Secret Treasure and continued, “If I attach this thing to my boots, I’m confident I can hold my ground against Holy Race experts of the same tier.”

Death Omen nodded and smiled in response. Originally, she thought that they would merely be working as free labor in this raid. Apart from receiving some Town Reputation Points, they never really thought of obtaining anything else. So, it was a pleasant surprise for them to be able to leave the Courtyard of Space with a Secret Treasure.

Different from Thousand Scars, Death Omen had obtained a Secret Treasure for weapons. Although it didn’t increase any Movement Speed like Thousand Scars’s Secret Treasure, it allowed her Attack Power to undergo a qualitative improvement.

A Legacy Pearl for Flowing Space??When Shi Feng opened his Goddess Treasure Chest and saw the Legacy Pearl in it, he couldn’t help but feel a little joyful. While it was true that Secret Treasures offered players a more direct improvement to combat power, the value of Flowing Space’s Legacy Pearl was easily ten times greater than any Combat-ranked Secret Treasure.

Currently, Shi Feng had already achieved the Stepping Space level, so the Flowing Space technique he executed was already strong enough to rival ordinary Gold Body Techniques. However, if he could reach the Phantom Body level…

He would fear nobody in the Eternal Realm once he became a Tier 5 Sword Saint.

Even if many Tier 6 experts arrived in the future, he was confident he could secure himself a spot in the Eternal Realm.

It’s a pity that I still haven’t perfected my mastery of the Stepping Space level. Otherwise, I could have used this Legacy Pearl right away and tried to reach the Phantom Body level.

After staring at the Legacy Pearl in his hand for a moment, he ultimately chose to set it aside in his bag, deciding that he would only use the Legacy Pearl once he had perfected his mastery of the Stepping Space level.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, all of the loot has settled,” Frey said, smiling in a happy mood as she pointed at the items scattered on the nearby ground. “As per our agreement, you get to choose two items first.”

“Okay.” After sweeping his gaze across the Holy Ancestor’s loot, Shi Feng walked over to the items and picked up two without hesitation, saying, “I’ll be taking these two items, then.”

The Holy Ancestor dropped nine items. Every one of these nine items radiated a faint trace of Eternal Energy, so anyone could tell they were extraordinary. Among them, there were weapons, equipment, potions, and designs. There were also two Secret Treasures that radiated an extraordinary aura.

Unlike the Secret Treasures everyone had seen thus far, the two Secret Treasures dropped by the Holy Ancestor were enveloped by a dark purple glow. Based on presence alone, they were clearly a cut above the Orichalcum Secret Treasure, which was a Combat-ranked Secret Treasure. So, when everyone saw these two Secret Treasures, they couldn’t help but salivate over them.

If they could attach both of these Secret Treasures to their equipment, they could probably elevate their Mana Protection from the Tier 5 standard to the Tier 6 standard. And even if it didn’t reach the Tier 6 standard, it would be very close to reaching it. Their combat power would also see a massive improvement.

However, Shi Feng did not pick even one of the two Secret Treasures for his two allotted items. Instead, he had chosen a potion and a feather.

The potion was held in a bottle made entirely out of Seven Luminaries Crystal, and the potion itself was a blood-red liquid with purple-gold sparkles.

As for the feather, it looked rather inconspicuous. The feather was the size of his palm, and it was pure white, like an angel’s feather. If not for the faint Eternal Energy it radiated, it could have easily been mistaken for an ordinary item.

He’s not choosing any of the Secret Treasures?

Frey couldn’t help but be surprised by Shi Feng’s choice. In her opinion, although all nine items dropped by the Holy Ancestor were undoubtedly precious, the value of the two Secret Treasures easily surpassed the combined value of the seven other items.

Yet, Shi Feng didn’t even glance at the two Secret Treasures that were clearly above the Combat rank when he chose the blood-red potion and feather. This was truly a surprising situation.

“Are you sure you want those two items, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Frey couldn’t help but ask.

“Mhm.” Shi Feng definitively nodded and smiled.

The two items he chose might seem ordinary compared to the two Secret Treasures, but they were actually the two most valuable items dropped by the Holy Ancestor. Any one of them was easily more valuable than the two Extraordinary-ranked Secret Treasures combined.

The potion he chose was naturally the Divine Spatial Potion, an item that could permanently increase the user’s perception of their respective power system by one level. As for the feather, it was the famous treasure the Goddess of Space had relied on to spread her name across the Twelve Sanctuaries in the past. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
