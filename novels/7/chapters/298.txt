Chapter 299 - One Word

When Shi Feng received the ring, he could not help but grow excited.

In the past, a Legendary item had been sold for tens of millions of Credits at the World Auction. At that time, the news had thoroughly shocked the entire world. Many people felt that the person who purchased the Legendary item was a complete fool. After all, it was simply an item inside a virtual world; it was nothing more than a data-generated item. Only a person whose head was caught in the door would spend so much money to purchase it.

Now, if Shi Feng converted the War God‚Äôs Temple Merit Points and Gold Coins he had spent into Credits, the total amount would be even higher than the price of the auctioned Legendary item. More importantly, he had spent such a large sum just to obtain an Epic item, which was two ranks lower than a Legendary item.

However, even if Shi Feng were called a fool several hundred times over, he would still be willing to do what he had done without hesitation. He was only afraid that he would not get such a chance.

Back then, countless people had ridiculed the person who purchased the Legendary item as a big fool. Later on, however, that person became the Guild Leader of King‚Äôs Return, Odin. King‚Äôs Return was a Super Guild, and the territories it occupied surpassed even an empire. Meanwhile, as the Guild Leader of such an amazing Guild, Odin was an existence that made everyone feel fear and respect. The wealth and status he possessed was simply unimaginable.

Did anyone laugh at him after that?

The answer was‚Äîno. Instead, the target of people‚Äôs ridicule shifted to the fool who had sold the Legendary item in the first place. At that time, not to mention several tens of million, even if traded using a city with a population of several millions, it would still have been a losing transaction.

Meanwhile, the Seven Luminaries Ring was a Godly Relic mentioned in legends.

Although the one Shi Feng had was only a replica, replicas could still be divided into different categories.

If one took a replica of a Fine-Gold item and a replica of an Epic item and placed them side by side, without even making an in-depth comparison, one could already tell which one was the better item. After all, there was already a huge gap between the calibers of the two items.

Moreover, the higher the quality of the target of replication, the greater the difficulty in replicating it. One could not produce a replica simply by wishing for it.

The difficulty of producing an Epic item that was the replica of a Godly Relic was much higher than simply producing a normal Epic item. The difficulty of doing so might even rival the difficulty of producing a Legendary item.

‚ÄúThe person who produced this ring must be a truly amazing Forging Sage. If the materials and energy used were of higher quality, the final product might even have become a Legendary item.‚Äù Shi Feng was a forger himself, so he naturally could tell just how amazing the forger that managed to produce this Seven Luminaries Ring was.

The replica of a Godly Relic would definitely not have been easy to produce. Even a Grandmaster Forger would not be able to produce one. It would only be possible for a Forging Sage.

‚ÄúAs expected of a Godly Relic‚Äôs replica. Even if it is only at Epic rank, apart from the Basic Attributes it provides being inferior to a Legendary item, its other aspects are much stronger.‚Äù Shi Feng‚Äôs surprise reached its limits after he read the Attributes of the Seven Luminaries Ring.

This was the first time Shi Feng was seeing the exact abilities of the Seven Luminaries Ring.

At this moment, Shi Feng finally understood why the legends had said that even an ordinary mortal would have the ability to decimate heaven and earth when in possession of the genuine Seven Luminaries Ring. One could even kill Gods with this ring. Meanwhile, the Seven Luminaries Ring in Shi Feng‚Äôs hand was only a replica. It was also only at Epic rank, and it was tens of thousands of miles away from being comparable to the genuine article.

However, even if it was only an Epic ranked replica, in Shi Feng‚Äôs eyes, it was already a miniature Godly Relic. It could easily outshine any other Epic item.

‚ÄúIt would be great if I could upgrade this Epic ranked Seven Luminaries Ring to Legendary rank.‚Äù Shi Feng could not help but start fantasizing. If he could raise the Seven Luminaries Ring‚Äôs rank to Legendary, then its value would become immeasurable. At that time, only Divine Artifacts would be able to suppress it.

After Shi Feng equipped the Seven Luminaries Ring, his Attributes greatly increased. His Intelligence reached 91 points‚Äîonly a small distance short of 120 points.

‚ÄúI can use the Aura of Earth when acting as an MT; Aura of Water when acting as a healer; Aura of Wind when hunting or escaping; Aura of Fire when battling; Aura of Time and Aura of Illusion when fighting in a team battle; and Aura of Space when I‚Äôm in a hurry. This ring covers almost every possible situation. It truly is the most powerful Epic item.‚Äù Shi Feng had mostly grasped the uses of the seven Auras in the Seven Luminaries Ring.

It really made one wonder just how powerful the genuine Godly Relic was...

Just as Shi Feng was fantasizing about the genuine Godly Relic, he suddenly thought of another matter.

If he used the Aura of Space, he could still make it if he hurried to the Silverleaf Forest right now. After all, a distance of 300,000 yards could generally cover two regions.

Shi Feng could first teleport to Stream Fort from White River City. Afterwards, he only needed to pass through four regions in order to arrive at the Silverleaf Forest. Under normal circumstances, even if Shi Feng ran with all his might, he would still need around five hours to travel across these four regions. However, now that Shi Feng could instantly travel across two regions, he might even arrive at the Silverleaf Forest before Gentle Snow‚Äôs reinforcements did.

Thinking so, Shi Feng immediately departed from the War God‚Äôs Temple and headed towards the Teleportation Hall of Star-Moon City.
