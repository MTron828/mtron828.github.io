Chapter 651 ‚Äì Tier 6 Sword Law Saint

Zero Wing Training Center, internal members‚Äô lounge:

The lounge was half the size of a sports stadium, and its walls were fully covered by holographic screens that vividly depicted tall mountains, flowing waterfalls, and lingering mist. There was also a restaurant, various training equipment, and many of the latest virtual gaming cabins prepared in the lounge.

After leaving Shi Feng‚Äôs office, the members of Star Soul were led to this lounge by Pace Angel, many of them wearing shocked faces. Of course, the reason for their shock wasn‚Äôt the lounge‚Äôs environment but something else entirely.

‚ÄúWhat kind of origin does Zero Wing have exactly, Big Brother Samsara? Those items are simply‚Ä¶terrifying,‚Äù Bygone Magic asked Fervent Samsara immediately after seeing Pace Angel leave.

Following Bygone Magic‚Äôs question, everyone else from Star Soul also looked at Fervent Samsara. At this time, all of the contempt they previously held toward Zero Wing had vanished without a trace.

After all, the items made available to Zero Wing‚Äôs core members were simply too frightening.

Even now, Secret Treasures remained incredibly precious in the Eternal Realm. According to their intelligence, the various powers‚Äô elites would be fortunate to have a full set of Common Secret Treasures at this stage of the Eternal Realm, and it was only the main force members of upper-ranking hegemonic powers who could get their hands on a couple of Combat Secret Treasures.

As for the Mana Purification Technique, it was something completely outside the reach of most upper-ranking hegemonic powers. Only conglomerates and pseudo-apex powers could get their hands on some.

The fact that Zero Wing could let their internal members exchange for Combat Secret Treasure Sets and Common Mana Purification Techniques was already highly unbelievable. Originally, when they heard about this from Fervent Samsara, their immediate reaction was to doubt him. After all, such an act of generosity was outside the capabilities of even pseudo-apex powers. It didn‚Äôt make sense an upstart Guild could afford such a feat.

However, when they saw the item exchange list exclusive to Zero Wing‚Äôs core members, they couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if they were hallucinating because of jetlag.

The Dragon‚Äôs Fury Set, an Extraordinary Secret Treasure Set!

Bronze Mana Purification Techniques!

These were items that they doubted even apex powers could afford to share with their executives, let alone core members.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Fervent Samsara said, shaking his head. Then, in a definitive tone, he continued, ‚ÄúBut I can tell you one thing, and that is if you become an executive of Zero Wing, your future achievements should be no less than that of the various pseudo-apex powers‚Äô chosen ones.‚Äù

Fervent Samsara knew very clearly that be it the Dragon‚Äôs Fury Set or the Bronze Mana Purification Techniques, neither of these things was Zero Wing‚Äôs biggest trump card. Instead, the Primordial Chaos Body was the true killer.

The Primordial Chaos Body was directly related to the strength of Primordial Gods. It was a Godly Relic that could change a player‚Äôs Divine Body. It might even have something to do with the rumored Superior Divine Body, which, according to rumors, could only be constructed with the help of a complete Primordial God Legacy.

Meanwhile, once a player constructed their Divine Body, it wasn‚Äôt as if they couldn‚Äôt change it. So long as they were willing to pay the price, they could reconstruct their Divine Body. Only, under normal circumstances, nobody would be willing to do so. After all, if a player‚Äôs Divine Body didn‚Äôt undergo a qualitative transformation, it wouldn‚Äôt affect their strength much. However, it would be a different story if a player could upgrade their ordinary Divine Body to a Superior Divine Body.

If Bygone Magic and the others could become Zero Wing‚Äôs executives, it was entirely possible that Shi Feng would allow them to experience the Primordial Chaos Body. At that time, if they could successfully construct a Superior Divine Body, it wouldn‚Äôt be out of the question for them to match Ancient Gods of the same level in strength.

‚ÄúAchievements no less than the pseudo-apex powers‚Äô chosen ones?‚Äù

The eyes of Bygone Magic and the others lit up when they heard Fervent Samsara‚Äôs words.

In the first-tier mobile city they came from, the various pseudo-apex powers‚Äô chosen ones were existences that ordinary citizens like themselves could never hope to reach.

After all, every pseudo-apex power‚Äôs chosen one was slated to take over the management of their respective Guild‚Äôs Divine Artifacts and become a Taboo-level existence in the future. At that time, they would be tasked with safeguarding the resources of an entire Realm. They were also the reason the special-tier mobile cities‚Äô powerful families got to enjoy the status they currently enjoyed.

‚ÄúAlright, enough talking. Quickly log back into God‚Äôs Domain and head to Gazing Moon City,‚Äù Fervent Samsara said, smiling when he saw the yearning looks on Bygone Magic and the others. ‚ÄúThe sooner you complete the Guild Leader‚Äôs assignments, the sooner you‚Äôll become an executive of Zero Wing.‚Äù

Hearing this, Bygone Magic and the others promptly borrowed one of the virtual gaming cabins in the lounge and logged into God‚Äôs Domain. They also secretly vouched to perform well in the Ancient River Kingdom and earn as many GCPs as they could.

As for Fervent Samsara, he also logged back into God‚Äôs Domain to prepare for his eventual experience of the Primordial Chaos Body. He did not wish to waste this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng rested for six hours, he returned to his room and logged into God‚Äôs Domain once more.

‚Ä¶

Crystal City of Secrets, Zero Wing‚Äôs Residence, underground secret room:

When Shi Feng came back online, he could feel a tremendous change in his surroundings. However, he quickly realized that it wasn‚Äôt his surroundings that had changed. Instead, it was the sensitivity of his five senses being amplified dozens of times. Meanwhile, following this change, he no longer felt like an insignificant ant when he perceived the world around him. Instead, he felt as if he had become equal with the world.

Is this the effect of a Superior Divine Body with two Advanced Laws merged? Shi Feng was greatly shocked when he sensed the rich mana radiating from his body. Its density and purity were already on par with the mana of Seven Luminaries Crystals.

Although he had previously gotten to experience a complete Superior Divine Body with the Primordial Dragon‚Äôs help, those experiences only lasted for a brief moment. Not to mention, the density of his current mana was not only superior to any of the ten simulated Superior Divine Bodies, but the strength of his mana was also slightly superior to that of Ancient Gods.

However, after Shi Feng looked at the bonuses he received from his Tier 6 promotion, the improvement to his mana suddenly felt inconsequential. Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

System: Congratulations! You have completed the third phase of the Legendary Quest Hundred Refinement Mana Body. You have obtained the qualifications to be the Hundred Refinement Building‚Äôs owner, and all of the Hundred Refinement Building‚Äôs functions will now become available to you. Rewarding 100 Free Legacy Skill Points.

With my current strength, even soloing a Level 170 God shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, Shi Feng thought when he finished reading the system notifications. Even though he wasn‚Äôt fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment right now, he was confident he could suppress a Tier 6 God of the same level. Moreover, it would be without the use of Law Projection.

Meanwhile, after looking at his Attributes, Shi Feng turned his sights to the Tier 6 Legacy Skills he could learn.

Tier 6 Skills and Spells were of utmost importance to Tier 6 players. Every additional Tier 6 Skill or Spell players learned would increase their overall strength by a large margin. Meanwhile, the stronger a player‚Äôs class in God‚Äôs Domain, the stronger the Legacy Skills and Spells they could learn at each tier.

Previously, Shi Feng already found it astonishing that he was allowed to learn a Tier 5 Super Spell when he got promoted to a Tier 5 Sword Law Saint. However, when he saw what he could learn at Tier 6, he couldn‚Äôt help but take a deep breath.
