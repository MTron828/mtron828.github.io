Chapter 2855 - Global Transformation

Inside the Summoning Altar, as the divine runes enveloping Shi Feng disappeared, Auerbeck snapped his eyes open and stared at him in surprise.

“You…succeeded?”

Actually, Auerbeck could tell that Shi Feng had completed the trial the moment he laid eyes on the human. This was because Shi Feng looked completely different in his eyes right now. Although there was no change to Shi Feng’s level, the Mana he radiated was completely different from before he challenged the trial. Not only did Shi Feng’s Mana blend much better with the ambient Mana, but the quality of his Mana had also undergone a qualitative transformation. The fact that Shi Feng had such exquisite control over his own Mana proved that he had conquered the trial.

However, Auerbeck still found this situation unbelievable. Shi Feng would already be plenty amazing if he managed to complete the trial on his third attempt. Yet, now, Shi Feng had actually completed the trial on his first attempt.

“Mhm, I got lucky.” Shi Feng nodded.

If his Concentration hadn’t broken through to the Tier 5 standard at the very last minute, which allowed him to receive the World Blessing to reconstruct his Sea of Consciousness, completing the trial would’ve been a pipe dream.

“No. It is impossible for someone to pass the trial by relying on luck. It is all because of your own strength,” Auerbeck said, shaking his head. “Since you’ve passed the trial, according to our contract, I, Auerbeck, acknowledge you as my contractor from now on.”

As soon as Auerbeck finished speaking, Shi Feng felt a scorching sensation on his left arm.

Before Shi Feng realized it, the symbol of a silver dragon had been branded on his left arm. Simultaneously, the system’s emotionless voice rang out in his mind.

System: Congratulations! You have completed the second phase of the Epic Quest “Void Cage” and received the Silver Divine Dragon Auerbeck’s acknowledgment. You have become a true Dragon’s Contractor. You now have the ability to call upon the Silver Divine Dragon to fight for you at any time. Rewarding 30 Legacy Skill Points and one level.

Shi Feng’s level immediately rose from Level 150 to Level 151. His Legacy Skill Points also increased by 30.

“If you encounter any troubles in the future, call upon me,” Auerbeck said. “With the Contractor’s Mark, I can teleport to your location at any time. However, you should still be cautious. The Contractor’s Mark has limited power. I cannot sense its location in certain areas. Moreover, the current God’s Domain is no longer the same. Although you have made significant growth, if you behave too aggressively outside, you might still fall into a desperate situation. You might even have your soul annihilated.”

“Different? Has the World Passage opened already?” Auerbeck’s words startled Shi Feng.

Auerbeck could defeat even ordinary Tier 5 individuals. Since he was issuing such a dire warning, the current God’s Domain must’ve undergone drastic changes.

“That’s right. The World Passage is completely open now. Existences of another world have invaded this world. In fact, some of God’s Domain’s rules have already changed. You will understand what I mean if you go out and take a look,” Auerbeck said, nodding. He then pointed at the door that was sealed by a magic array and continued, “If you encounter trouble, it is best if you summon me immediately.”

“Thank you for your warning, Your Excellency. I will be careful.”

Shi Feng nodded and mentally noted to himself to be more careful. Afterward, he departed from the Summoning Altar. As for Auerbeck, the Silver Divine Dragon resumed its slumber in the Summoning Altar.

The moment Shi Feng exited the Summoning Tower, he was stunned.

What dense Mana!

The density of the Starlight Fortress’s ambient Mana had more than doubled compared to before he went to the Dragon Temple.

Apart from Zero Wing City, probably no other Guild City in God’s Domain possessed such dense Mana. Even Stone Forest City couldn’t compare.

Moreover, Shi Feng could feel his affinity with Mana increasing while bathed in this dense Mana. He could also perceive the operating principles of Mana with much greater clarity. This place was practically a weakened version of the ancient God’s Domain.

However, compared to the Mana environment, the changes to the Starlight Fortress’s player population were even more shocking.

Before Shi Feng left to challenge the Divine Dragon’s trial, the Starlight Fortress’s player traffic had already reached a very frightening level. However, the present fortress’s player population had more than tripled since then. Shi Feng even spotted quite a few Tier 4 experts just on the street he was walking on.

Moreover, he sensed the presence of at least 70 Tier 4 experts inside the Starlight Fortress. This number was simply mind-blowing.

However, this still wasn’t the most shocking part about the fortress!

Compared to the Starlight Fortress’s interior, the fortress’s surroundings were much more crowded. From what Shi Feng could tell, well over a million players were lining up to enter the fortress.

These players weren’t ordinary players. Even the weakest one among them was a Tier 3 player, and every one of them was at least at Level 135. There were also Tier 4 experts standing in the queue.

If not for these players standing in line obediently, Shi Feng would’ve suspected that these people were aiming to capture the Starlight Fortress. However, before Shi Feng could recover from his surprise, he saw a group of people charging through the main street toward the fortress’s entrance. This group’s leader was none other than Magic-eye Goddess Fithalia, the commander of Divine Tribe’s Divine Hymn Legion.

At this time, Fithalia had reached not only Tier 4 but also Level 145. Given the intensity of the Mana she radiated, she had broken through her Mana Body’s 100% threshold as well. From what Shi Feng could tell, Fithalia should also have at least two Fragmented Legendary items on her. In her current state, she could probably hold her ground against a Superior Mythic monster of the same level.

Moreover, aside from Fithalia, there were three other Tier 4s in the team she led. These three players were at the Void Realm standard and boasted eight or more pieces of Epic Equipment. The only unfortunate part was that none of them had transcended the limits of their Mana Bodies.

Even so, the strength of Fithalia’s team was more than enough to raid Superior Mythic monsters of the same level.

However, Fithalia and the others looked anxious as they rushed toward the entrance.

Did something happen?

Curious, Shi Feng stealthily followed Fithalia’s team.

Divine Tribe could be considered Zero Wing’s strategic ally on the western continent. Moreover, it was tasked with maintaining the Starlight Fortress’s security on Zero Wing’s behalf. Unless something major occurred, someone of Fithalia’s status wouldn’t take action. If need be, Shi Feng naturally had to lend her a helping hand.

Shortly afterward, Fithalia’s team arrived at the Starlight Fortress’s entrance.

At this time, the players outside the entrance were staring curiously at a group of people standing before the fortress’s checkpoint.

To be precise, it was a mixed group of NPCs and players. Among these players were five Tier 4s. As for the NPCs, there were actually over a dozen Tier 4s among them.

“Why are people of the Blood Alliance here? Don’t the superpowers in the alliance mainly operate out at sea?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It is indeed strange. From what I remember, they’ve never been active on land. Instead, they’ve been dominating the seas since the start of the game; even the Five Great Super Guilds don’t dare offend them out at sea.”

“I heard that many naval forces have clashed with the Outerworld’s forces at sea. Although neither side managed to secure an advantage, the Blood Alliance suffered heavy losses in these clashes. Rumor has it that the alliance has over five million Tier 3 casualties thus far. Three of the alliance’s islands were razed to the ground…”

The players in the queue couldn’t help starting heated discussions among themselves as they looked at the Tier 4 players and NPCs. While the Blood Alliance’s sphere of operations was mostly limited to the sea, the Starlight Fortress was nowhere near the sea. Just teleporting from a coastal city to the Starlight Fortress cost nearly six Gold Coins.

“Are they greedy for the Starlight Fortress’s benefits?”

“That’s probably the case. After all, the current Starlight Fortress is simply amazing. Its Mana density and the benefits the Mana provides are much greater than what you can find elsewhere on the continent. Not to mention, it is also near a God Mode Regional Dungeon.”

“That can’t be, right? Don’t they know that a Tier 4 Divine Dragon is guarding this place? That’s not something Tier 4 existences can go up against.”

While everyone wondered why members of the Blood Alliance had come to the Starlight Fortress, Fithalia’s team arrived before the Blood Alliance group.

“Guild Leader Brut, to what do we owe this sudden visit?” Fithalia asked a thin man wearing a gray robe and carrying a dark wooden staff.

The Blood Alliance had arrived with more than a dozen Tier 4 NPCs and three of the Blood Alliance’s top ten Tier 4 experts. It definitely wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Blood Alliance came with bad intentions.

“Commander Fithalia, you don’t need to be so nervous. We are not here to ask for trouble. Moreover, we aren’t here to meet you,” Brut said, smiling faintly. “In fact, this matter doesn’t have anything to do with Divine Tribe. We are simply here to find Zero Wing and negotiate a partnership.” “Negotiate a partnership with Zero Wing?” Fithalia laughed at Brut’s statement. “I naturally don’t have a say in such a matter. However, seeing as you’ve brought so many Tier 4 NPCs with you, no matter how I look at it, it doesn’t seem like you’ve come for a friendly negotiation.”

“I didn’t call them here,” Brut countered, shaking his head. “These people are the representatives of various NPC naval forces.”

“Representatives of NPC naval forces?” Fithalia was surprised by Brut’s answer.

If only one NPC force had sent these Tier 4 NPCs, she wouldn’t have found the situation strange. However, it was a different story if these NPCs represented multiple NPC forces. This was something she had to take seriously.

In God’s Domain, the reason many kingdoms and empires had chosen not to spread their influence to the sea wasn’t just the presence of powerful sea monsters. Another reason was the extraordinary strength of many NPC naval forces, with some even having Tier 5 NPCs leading them.

Nodding, Brut said in an indisputable tone, “That’s right. It’s fine if you do not let us enter, Commander Fithalia. However, I don’t mind letting you know that the Blood Alliance plans to requisition a portion of the Starlight Fortress’s temporary Residences to resist the Outerworld invaders.”
