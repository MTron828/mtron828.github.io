Chapter 242 – Myriad Worlds’ Players

Boundary Mountain Range, second underground level, divine statue plaza:

Players appeared one after another in the plaza. Apart from Shi Feng and his team members, the members of the Desolate Star God’s Domain’s various powers similarly did not leave the plaza when the system update started. Instead, they had chosen to log out of the game to rest.

“Strange. Why does my body feel a lot heavier than before?” Su Qianliu immediately noticed the change in her body as soon as she logged into the game, and she couldn’t help but be confused by this situation.

“Me too. My body’s reaction speed has also slowed down significantly,” Zhuo Yalin said with a stunned look on her face. “Could there be a bug with the update?”

God’s Domain’s environment had been fixed from the very beginning. Although the Boundary Mountain Range’s second underground level had a special environment, it still didn’t make sense for the environment to change because of the system update.

Not to mention, Zhuo Yalin could feel that her reaction speed had slowed down significantly, and her physical fitness was reduced to that of an ordinary person. In this situation, she’d be fortunate if she could exhibit even half of the combat power she could previously exhibit in the second underground level...

“No, this isn’t a bug. This is the true God’s Domain,” Maria, who stood nearby, said.

“The true God’s Domain?” Liu Wusheng looked toward Maria in confusion.

Aside from Liu Wusheng, the others present, such as Crimson Heart, Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and the others, also turned to look at Maria, curious to learn what the other party meant by “true God’s Domain.”

In response, Maria looked to Liu Wusheng and explained, “The environment we are in now, or, more specifically, the level of control we have over our bodies currently, is the true standard of control players should have in God’s Domain. This is the standard that the Greater God’s Domain and all God’s Domain that has come out of isolation share. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“When a God’s Domain remains in an isolated state, players of that God’s Domain can move their character bodies with only a single thought. Unlike in the real world, the nervous system is not involved in the entire process of controlling one’s body in God’s Domain. As a result, it is significantly easier to control one’s character body than one’s real body. However, once a God’s Domain comes out of isolation, everyone belonging to that God’s Domain will see this manipulation method changed to match that of the real world. So, you will feel as if your bodies cannot keep up with your brains.”

Liu Wusheng and the others instantly understood Maria’s explanation and realized what had gone wrong with their bodies. At the same time, unprecedented pressure fell on them.

The way they had to control their bodies had changed!

After playing in their isolated God’s Domain for so many years, they had long since gotten used to having their character bodies execute movements with a single thought. In that state, one could say that their bodies could move as quickly as their brains could think.

However, in their current state, their bodies’ reaction speed could no longer keep up with their brains’ reaction speed. This situation would make fighting monsters incredibly difficult for them in the future.

More specifically, whenever they fought against monsters in God’s Domain in the future, it’d be no different than if they were to fight these monsters in the real world. The only difference would be that their character bodies would be much stronger than their real bodies. However, there was no doubt that their combat standards in God’s Domain would plummet.

From today onward, Refinement Realm experts would probably have difficulty beating even High Lords of the same level…

Players would most definitely have to change their combat methods to adapt to this new control method.

For peak experts and above, though, they wouldn’t be affected by this change as much as other players. With their ability to perceive their surroundings clearly, they could compensate for their bodies’ reduced reaction speed by predicting their opponents’ moves in advance and taking the appropriate countermeasures. Though, when it came to using combat techniques, Skills, and Spells, peak experts would also be severely affected like ordinary players.

Aside from Liu Wusheng and the others, the various superpowers’ members standing in the distance similarly felt great pressure after experiencing the true God’s Domain. Even the Flower of Seven Sins’ Death Omen and Gluttony wore ugly looks on their faces.

…

“With this change, the gap in strength between our God’s Domain and other God’s Domains has just grown even bigger…” The corners of Thousand Swords’ eyes twitched when he finished listening to Menghao’s explanation.

Originally, Thousand Swords thought that even if the various foreign God’s Domains’ powers came to the Miniature Ancient World, the native powers of their God’s Domain could rely on their numerical and geographical advantages to maintain a considerable advantage.

However, after learning about the changes that had taken place, it wouldn’t matter even if they had a numerical advantage. The gap in combat standards between both sides was simply too massive.

After the update, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Refinement Realm and Flowing Water Realm experts were not much different than ordinary experts. They were merely better at making use of their five senses. However, due to the limitation of their bodies’ reaction speed, Refinement Realm and Flowing Water Realm experts wouldn’t gain much advantage even if they could use their five senses better than ordinary experts.

It would no longer be possible for Flowing Water Realm experts to single-handedly wipe the floor with a 100-man team of ordinary experts. This would be the case even if Stamina restrictions were removed.

In the current state of God’s Domain, if ordinary players were said to be able to exhibit 60% of their bodies’ potential, then Flowing Water Realms could only exhibit 80% of their bodies’ potential. The difference between the two was considerably small.

As for Domain Realm experts, they were probably only at the 90% to 95% standard. Their overall strength advantage over ordinary experts was also considerably limited. A Domain Realm expert might even have difficulty going up against a few Refinement Realm experts with the same Basic Attributes…

…

While everyone was feeling stressed by the unexpected changes, Shi Feng was calmly inspecting the loot he got from the Nether King. He wasn’t at all surprised that the various superpowers were having a hard time processing this situation.

This was the process that all players of isolated God’s Domains had to experience sooner or later. This was also why, in the Greater God’s Domain, players were divided based on their accomplishments in the World Tower rather than their accomplishments in the Realms of Refinement.

From now onwards, one’s accomplishments in the Realms of Truth would be just as important as one’s accomplishments in the Realms of Refinement. Even if players reached the Domain Realm and could exert their five senses to their very limits, they wouldn’t be considered third-floor experts if they had no accomplishments in the Realms of Truth.

In fact, even if a Domain Realm expert managed to reach the Truth Realm, which was the Realms of Truth’s entry-level, and achieve combat power at the third-floor standard, they wouldn’t be recognized as third-floor experts by the Greater God’s Domain’s hegemonic powers. They would still be deemed as second-floor experts.

Only after a player had reached the Realms of Truth’s Ascension Realm on top of reaching the Realms of Refinement’s Domain Realm would they be considered a true third-floor expert, which was also the so-called God-ranked expert. After reaching the level of a God-ranked expert, players would have the ability to defeat multiple second-floor experts in the Greater God’s Domain, assuming that there were no Stamina restrictions in place.

“We got quite the good harvest this time, so it’s about time we leave,” Shi Feng said after sorting out the Nether King’s loot.

Shi Feng had gained quite the harvest from the Nether King this time. Aside from gaining enough EXP to reach Level 117, he had also obtained two Fragmented Legendary Weapons—a staff and a greatsword. In addition, the Nether King had also dropped a Tier 5 Magic Scroll, a Teleportation Magic Array Design, and a bunch of Legendary materials.

Most importantly, the Nether King had dropped a Cross-Border Guild Promotion Order, an item that could instantly promote a Basic Cross-Border Guild into a Bronze Cross-Border Guild.

Liu Wusheng and the others nodded when they heard Shi Feng’s words. Now that numerous foreign God’s Domains were about to enter the Miniature Ancient World, the last thing they should do would be to waste time grinding in the second underground level. According to the system’s introduction, the Miniature Ancient World’s City System would also undergo a significant change once the myriad worlds descended. If they didn’t adapt to this change as soon as possible, the various foreign powers would quickly eliminate them from the Miniature Ancient World.

After Shi Feng bid goodbye to Flanders’ team, he promptly led his team out of the Boundary Mountain Range. Then, after traveling on Mount for around ten hours and exiting the Boundary Mountain Range’s underground area, Shi Feng and the others took out a Return Scroll and teleported back to Hundred Flow City.

…

Hundred Flow City, Teleportation Hall:

Followed by the appearance of numerous flashes in the Teleportation Hall’s teleportation array, Shi Feng and the others finally returned to Hundred Flow City.

“So many people actually came?!” Galaxy Past gasped when he saw the crowded Teleportation Hall.

Currently, players standing shoulder to shoulder could be seen crowding the lobby the size of a football field. Moreover, these players were incredibly high-leveled, nearly all of them being at Level 120. These Level 120 players were also equipped with Epic Equipment Sets, their equipment standards not the slightest bit inferior to the various superpowers’ main force members.

However, compared to these players’ equipment standards, their combat standards were even more shocking.

At a glance, Galaxy Past could see Refinement Realm experts everywhere, with many Void Realm experts and above among them. He even felt a sense of danger from quite a few of these experts...
