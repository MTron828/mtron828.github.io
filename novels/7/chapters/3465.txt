Chapter 540 – Slaying a God With One Hand

“What a crazy bastard!”

“What gave him the courage to provoke the seven pseudo-apex powers’ people?”

“That guy’s suicidal! Does he not see all the death drops scattered around the entrance?!”

Everyone was shocked by Shi Feng’s blatant provocation.

!!

Shi Feng wasn’t the first person to have tried to get past the seven pseudo-apex powers’ blockade and enter the Golden Spire, but everyone who previously tried had done so with a negotiating attitude. None dared to even speak loudly to the seven pseudo-apex powers’ members.

Even so, the seven pseudo-apex powers’ members still killed those people to set an example.

But now that Shi Feng had taken the initiative to provoke the seven pseudo-apex powers, nobody could imagine what the seven powers would do to Shi Feng and his companion.

“Kid, you have guts, I’ll give you that! But do you really think you can talk big in front of us just because you two are wearing Azure Fang’s emblem?” The middle-aged Berserker laughed. “Or do you think we will back away because of Azure Fang?”

The other seven pseudo-apex powers’ members laughed along with the middle-aged Berserker.

It was true that Azure Fang was a pseudo-apex power, but which of their seven Guilds wasn’t one?

Not to mention, leading their group was Star Dynasty, one of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers. With their line-up, not even Azure Fang’s Guild Leader would dare to behave so arrogantly in front of them.

At this time, because of the commotion Shi Feng caused, even Demon Axe, who had been resting his eyes, had turned to look at Shi Feng.

“Azure Fang?” Turning to the middle-aged Berserker, Shi Feng calmly said, “Since when have I said I was a member of Azure Fang?”

“You’re not from Azure Fang?” The middle-aged Berserker looked at Shi Feng in confusion. Then, upon taking a closer look, he found that Shi Feng, indeed, wasn’t wearing Azure Fang’s Guild Emblem. Only the Blood Elf standing next to him was. And at this discovery, he couldn’t help but ask, “Which Guild are you from, then?”

It was true that Azure Fang didn’t have the qualifications to behave arrogantly before them, but it would be a different story if Shi Feng were a member of one of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers or an apex power.

At this time, the other seven pseudo-apex powers’ members also grew serious, none daring to laugh at Shi Feng anymore.

It might still be fine if Shi Feng was only a member of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers, but they would be in deep trouble if he were from an apex power. Not even the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers would dare to offend an apex power.

The Golden Spire was crucial for the various powers’ development, and everyone had to pay a great price to come here. If they were to kill an apex power’s member here, even if said apex power wasn’t strong enough to retaliate against them in the Eternal Realm, that didn’t mean said apex power couldn’t conduct its retaliation outside the Eternal Realm.

Meanwhile, under everyone’s anxious gaze, Shi Feng proudly said, “Zero Wing.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“…”

“Zero Wing?”

Everyone was momentarily stunned as they looked at Shi Feng’s proud expression, their brains rapidly trying to recall which apex power went by the name of Zero Wing.

Unlike everyone else, though, Aqua Rose couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in exasperation. She couldn’t believe Shi Feng would be so bold to speak the truth. And to say it in such a prideful manner…

“Are you messing with me, you little punk?!” the middle-aged Berserker bellowed after he finished recollecting his memories. “I’ve never heard of any apex power called Zero Wing! You must be tired of living!”

Meanwhile, shortly after the middle-aged Berserker finished speaking, some of the people present quickly recognized Shi Feng.

“Zero Wing? I know who he is! He’s Zero Wing’s Black Flame!”

“Now that you mention it, he does look like Black Flame. So, he’s the guy who caused a couple of upper-ranking hegemonic powers to eat a huge loss? No wonder he’s so arrogant.”

“For someone with no background, coming in eleventh on the Sacred Glory List is indeed a great achievement. In any other Realm in the Greater God’s Domain, such an achievement certainly gives him bragging rights. It’s a pity he’s in the Eternal Realm. He has no idea what terrifying existences he is going up against!”

After the publication of the latest Sacred Glory List, many players throughout the Greater God’s Domain came to learn of the name Black Flame. Unfortunately, in the eyes of the various pseudo-apex powers, experts on the Sacred Glory List were still nothing but jokes.

“It looks like it’s about to end,” Aqua Rose muttered, sighing when Aqua Rose saw the seven pseudo-apex powers’ experts getting ready for a fight.

When she first arrived in the Greater God’s Domain, she had similarly thought that none of the Greater God’s Domain’s powers dared to provoke her because she was a Tier 6 player. It wasn’t until she offended the apex power Demon’s Gate that she came to understand how terrifying apex powers were.

In fact, not to mention apex powers, even pseudo-apex powers could easily put a Tier 6 player into despair if they revealed so much as a small portion of their capabilities.

While Aqua Rose was distracted with her thoughts, Demon Axe suddenly moved.

In the blink of an eye, Berserker, who had been guarding the Golden Spire’s entrance all this time, arrived before Shi Feng.

“What? Demon Axe is taking action himself?”

Demon Axe taking action was outside of everyone’s expectations. Even the middle-aged Berserker who was about to teach Shi Feng a lesson was shocked by this development.

After all, Demon Axe had only ever taken action against groups of experts thus far. He had never bothered to move against individual players.

He’s using his trademark move?!

When Aqua Rose saw the Demon Axe War God’s movements, she instantly knew that the other party was using his trademark move, and she couldn’t help but be shocked by this development.

The Demon Axe War God was titled as such because of his mastery over the Gold Combat Technique Demon Axe. It was with this technique that the Demon Axe War God spread his fame across the Greater God’s Domain.

Although Demon Axe wasn’t at Tier 6 right now, the combination of his Gold Combat Technique and Legendary Axe allowed him to exhibit power on par with a Tier 6 player’s full-powered attack. If Aqua Rose were to face this attack herself, even if she had a Fragmented Divine Artifact in hand, she would have to use an Invulnerability Skill to keep herself alive. None of her other means would let her survive Demon Axe’s attack.

But just when Demon Axe’s pitch-black axe was about to connect with its target, Shi Feng suddenly appeared above Demon Axe, the blue longsword in his hand already descending toward the Tier 5 Berserker.

Radiant Night!

Holy Annihilation!

Ptch-black flames emerged from the Winter of Eternal Night as it closed in on Demon Axe. Though, it did not land on Demon Axe directly, as the latter had redirected his weapon’s trajectory and used his attack to defend himself.

Boom!

When axe and longsword collided, pitch-black flames rose into the air. When the flames dissipated, Demon Axe could be seen kneeling on the ground and looking up at Shi Feng in disbelief, a long gash running from his shoulder to his chest. Then, whilst confusion filled his mind, Demon Axe collapsed to the ground, becoming deader than dead…
