Chapter 3858 - 932 - Earth-Shattering

“Are you trying to start a fight, Vocalist?!”

Holy Blood, the Sun Dynasty’s First Holy Child, glared at Slumbering Vocalist. If not for Daystar being the commander of the Sun Dynasty’s forces in Plot 066, he would have attacked Slumbering Vocalist on the spot.

Slumbering Vocalist was Evil Nature’s number one chosen one. In terms of combat standard, he wasn’t much better than Daystar, the Sun Dynasty’s number one chosen one. However, ever since Daystar lost to Shi Feng, Slumbering Vocalist behaved like she had lost to him and made fun of her at every opportunity. This, in turn, made it seem like the Sun Dynasty was inferior to Evil Nature.

“Sure! Fight me if you dare!” Slumbering Vocalist said calmly as he glanced at Holy Blood, who was equipped with only Fragmented Divine Artifact-ranked equipment and a Divine Artifact-ranked weapon. “Let’s see how many rounds you can last against me!”

“You’re stronger than me now only because you have your Guild’s Divine Artifacts to rely on. Do you think you’d be a match for me if we competed in combat standards?” Holy Blood said sarcastically, resisting the impulse to take action.

“So what? You’re free to use your Guild’s Divine Artifacts as well,” Slumbering Vocalist said, chuckling. “But would the Sun Dynasty dare to bestow its Divine Artifacts on a person like you?”

“Vocalist, that’s enough out of you,” Daystar stated coldly when she noticed Holy Blood about to give in to his anger. “If you want to prove you are stronger than me, feel free to go after Black Flame. You can rest assured that the Sun Dynasty will never intervene.”

“Never intervene?” Slumbering Vocalist smiled at Daystar’s statement. “In that case, I’ll deal with Black Flame on your behalf. I’ll teach him that the Holy Race’s chosen ones are superior to the human race’s chosen ones in every aspect!”

“Suit yourself,” Daystar said indifferently. “But let me warn you: do not underestimate Black Flame. Even during the Continental Championship, he never fought us with his full strength.”

“Never fought with his full strength? So what? With an absolute difference in Basic Attributes, even a Mortal God will fall before me!” Slumbering Vocalist said nonchalantly before he turned around and left with his legion.

After the Holy Hymn Legion left Plot 066, Holy Blood turned to Daystar.

“Daystar, what were you thinking?” Holy Blood asked in confusion. “You are fully equipped with Divine Artifacts now. Your combat standard is also superior to that bastard’s. Why would you concede such a good opportunity to him? If that bastard kills Black Flame, our reputation will be ruined.”

“He isn’t that easy to kill,” Daystar stated firmly as she looked toward Plot 095. “If he could be defeated so easily, Garuda never would have lost to him.”

“But Slumbering Vocalist is fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. Paired with the World Idols’ effect, even Zero Wing’s Mortal God might not be a match for him, let alone Black Flame,” Holy Blood rebutted, exasperated by Daystar’s confidence in Shi Feng’s strength.

Holy Blood admitted that Shi Feng’s combat standard surpassed theirs. Even so, he still wasn’t anywhere near reaching the sixth-floor standard.

“All we need to do is wait for the outcome,” Daystar said, unperturbed. “If he does get defeated, it would only prove that he is nothing special and no longer qualifies to be my opponent.”

After saying so, Daystar led her legion to another plot of land to continue collecting Everlasting City Tokens.

Everlasting City, Plot 095:DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

About two hours after the activation of the World Idols, many of the various powers’ members had gathered in Plot 095 in addition to Evil Nature’s two trump card legions. These players had come to spectate and record the inevitable battle between Evil Nature and Zero Wing.

“I wonder how Zero Wing’s Mortal God will fare against an expert fully equipped with Divine Artifacts while affected by the World Idols?”

“She’ll probably be defeated in no time. After all, we are talking about the World Idols here. Even a sixth-floor expert should need to commit much of their attention to resisting the World Idols’ effects. Although Zero Wing’s sixth-floor expert defeated Unseeing Demon in three moves, that was because Unseeing Demon chose to trade blows with her. Had he engaged her in close-quarters combat, he would never have lost so miserably.”

“How strange. Such a major event has occurred, yet the Sun Dynasty, the Thunder Empire, and Sovereign Mark haven’t sent anyone here?”

“They probably feel that the outcome is obvious, so they couldn’t be bothered to send anyone. After all, how strong could a shackled sixth-floor expert be?”

The various powers’ scouts engaged in an enthusiastic discussion as they observed the trapped Zero Wing members. They were curious to learn how strong a sixth-floor expert could be and what kind of price a royal power would have to pay to kill a Mortal God. If they could have their questions answered, it would give them a better chance at resisting Mortal Gods in the future.

…

“Elder Martial, are we just going to watch?” Verdant Rainbow asked, clenching her fists in frustration as she stared at Evil Nature’s legions in the Magic Mirror.

“With the World Idols deployed, we can do nothing about this situation. Even if we mobilized all of the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s forces, we would simply be contributing our tokens to Evil Nature,” Elder Martial said, shaking his head. He was similarly bitter about the situation. “All we can do now is collect as much information as we can on Evil Nature to better deal with the Holy Race in the future.”

“If only the Golden Kingdom were here. We’d be able to render the World Idols useless with the Golden Kingdom’s power.” Verdant Rainbow also understood that the Seven Luminaries Alliance stood no chance against Evil Nature in the World Idols’ barrier. It might be a different story if they had the Golden Kingdom here, but the Divine Artifact was protecting the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s town on the Western Continent.

…

As the various powers discussed Zero Wing’s fate, inside the World Idols’ barrier…

“Guild Leader, a lot of people have already gathered. My Cooldown is also done. Can we start now?” Phoenix Rain asked Shi Feng, looking at the 2,000 Evil Nature members gathered in the distance.

“I guess this is all the members Evil Nature can muster,” Shi Feng muttered, surveying the Evil Nature members chatting in midair. “Go ahead, then!”

“Okay!” At Shi Feng’s response, Phoenix Rain excitedly began to chant.

The Spell Phoenix Rain cast was none other than the Pseudo-Tier 7 Spell All-Consuming Fire. However, unlike before, she now cast it after activating her Divine Staff’s Profound Skill, Mana Sacrifice.

When activated, Mana Sacrifice would ignite her mana, increasing its effectiveness by 200% for one minute. It had a long Cooldown of one natural day and was Phoenix Rain’s greatest trump card.

When Phoenix Rain completed the chant for All-Consuming Fire, dark-purple flames poured out of the void. The flames appeared much more quickly than before. A flaming sword exceeding 10,000 yards emerged from the void in just three seconds and pierced the World Idols’ barrier.

Boom!

Before anyone outside the barrier could react, a deafening sound echoed across Everlasting City. Then, the barrier shattered and turned into particles of light.
