Chapter 344 - Unstoppable

Although Shi Feng’s survivability was impressive, when faced with a Level 50 Mutant High Lord, not even he could last long. After all, the gap between them was simply too wide.

“I have no choice; I have to use it.” Shi Feng reluctantly took a Frost Grenade from his bag.

Immediately, the Mechanical Slayer slid to a halt, its glowing red eyes glaring at the Frost Grenade in Shi Feng’s hand.

The Mechanical Slayer was very familiar with the Frost Grenades.

Shi Feng had once used these Frost Grenades to freeze it for a long period of time, rendering it helpless.

“Hah, it seems that it remembers,” Shi Feng laughed when he saw the Mechanical Slayer’s reaction.

However, Shi Feng had no hope that the Frost Grenades would scare the Mechanical Slayer for too long. Taking advantage of the Mechanical Slayer’s hesitation, Shi Feng took a step forward and dashed towards Dark Star’s mages.

“Damn! All mages, fire everything you have at him! Don’t let him get close!” Lone Tyrant shouted.

One after another, spells flew towards Shi Feng in quick succession.

Frost Arrows, Ice Spheres, Ice Walls, Spiritual Bondage, and other control skills aimed for Shi Feng.

Meanwhile, the Mechanical Slayer behind Shi Feng had finally responded. Immediately, it threw the serrated greatsword in its hand at Shi Feng.

The greatsword generated a sonic boom as it flew, punching a hole through the air. The sword was so fast that it was impossible for anyone to dodge it.

On one side, there were the numerous spells players had cast, and on the other, there was the Mechanical Slayer’s greatsword.

Shi Feng could not afford to be careless. Immediately, he used Phantom Kill, creating a doppelganger of himself 10 yards away from his main body. Just as the serrated greatsword was about to skewer him, by the skin of his teeth, he swapped positions with his doppelganger.

Shi Feng’s doppelganger was utterly powerless against the serrated greatsword, dying instantly.

However, even after killing Shi Feng’s doppelganger, the greatsword did not slow and soared towards the Dark Star mages.

Before the members of Dark Star could react, the greatsword plunged itself into the crowd. An explosion blossomed as the weapon crashed into the ground, creating a massive hole in the Teleportation Hall’s floor. Following which, with the greatsword as the epicenter, shockwaves radiated throughout the surroundings. A single shockwave had decimated all players within a 30-yard radius. From this, Shi Feng once more witnessed just how terrifying a Mutant was.

Meanwhile, Shadow Sword and Turtledove who now hid in a corner were dumbfounded by what they saw.

“Big Brother Shadow Sword, are all High Lords so powerful?” Turtledove asked in shock.

“According to my knowledge, there is not a single High Lord as powerful as this Mechanical Slayer. It seems that Guild Leader Black Flame’s command to withdraw was not without reason,” Shadow Sword watched Shi Feng in the distance, a hint of admiration appearing on his face.

Although the Mechanical Slayer’s combat power was horrific, it did not possess the techniques to utilize it fully. Shi Feng, on the other hand, was different. Not only did he possess a firm grasp of his surroundings, but he also possessed meticulous dodging techniques. It was precisely what he, Shadow Sword, aimed to learn.

“If I join Zero Wing, in the future, won’t I be able to learn many more techniques from him?” An idea suddenly occurred to Shadow Sword, and his determination to attend Zero Wing’s next recruitment increased. He must join Zero Wing.

While Shadow Sword and Turtledove admired Shi Feng, Lone Tyrant’s anger grew rampant.

With a single attack, the Mechanical Slayer had slaughtered over a hundred Dark Star elites.

“Damn that Black Flame! Have the others not arrived yet?!” Lone Tyrant bellowed.

“Guild Leader, the closest members number around 4,000, and they are rushing to join us. With some time, there should be no problems boosting that number to 10,000,” one of Lone Tyrant’s subordinate reported.

Lone Tyrant nodded, wearing a satisfied smile as he said, “Good. Tell the team to buy us some time. Also, send someone to Zero Wing’s side to check for any movements. With so much commotion, they won’t stand silently by.”

By the time everyone had gathered, whether it was Black Flame or the Mechanical Slayer, all would be his for the taking.

At this moment, the members of Dark Star and the other Guilds began to dart around. Wherever Shi Feng appeared, these players would run in the opposite direction, playing the mouse to Shi Feng’s cat.

Just as Shi Feng used the Frost Grenades to pin the Mechanical Slayer down and manipulate the monster’s strength to kill the members of Dark Star and the various Guilds, the Level 150 guards of White River City had finally arrived at the Teleportation Hall.

Over a hundred guards stormed the Teleportation Hall. Among them, there was a Level 150 Tier 2 Guard General, as well as plenty of Tier 1 Guard Captains. These NPCs stood neatly in order, surrounding the Teleportation Hall. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The guards are here! We’re saved!”

The players present released a sigh of relief at the guards’ arrival. Borrowing the Mechanical Slayer’s strength, Shi Feng had killed countless of their allies. If they had not continuously avoided him, they would have long since died under Shi Feng’s demonic claws.

“Good. Now that the guards are here, when they pin down this monster, they will attract its aggro. We’ll see how arrogant you are then. When my men arrive, we’ll introduce you to Death,” Lone Tyrant laughed coldly as he watched Shi Feng dodge the Mechanical Slayer’s attacks.

At this moment, however, Shi Feng also revealed a smile. Immediately, he dashed out of the Teleportation Hall, holding nothing back while doing so.

Meanwhile, under the Tier 2 Guard General’s command, the guards started their assault on the Mechanical Slayer.

The NPCs were uniformly Level 150. The ordinary guards possessed 800,000 HP, the Tier 1 Guard Captains possessed 1,600,000 HP, and the Tier 2 Guard General possessed 2,400,000 HP. To players, these guards were invincible. These guards only needed a single strike to kill a Level 50 player instantly. Hence, in everyone’s eyes, a Level 50 monster stood no chance against these NPCs. The same went for the Mutant High Lord with 40,000,000 HP.

Unfortunately, Mutants were different.

When the Level 150 ordinary guards attacked the Mechanical Slayer, the highest damage they had dealt was only around -1,000 points. Even the Level 150 Tier 1 Guard Captains only managed to deal around -3,000 damage to the Mechanical Slayer. As for the most powerful Level 150 Tier 2 Guard General, he could only deal around -10,000 damage.

Such damages were barely a scratch to the Mechanical Slayer’s 40,000,000 HP.

Indeed, just like Lone Tyrant had predicted, the Mechanical Slayer’s attention immediately switched towards the Tier 2 Guard General. Following which, the Mechanical Slayer swung its serrated greatsword at the Guard General, while the Guard General responded quickly by raising his spear to defend against the attack.

Boom!

The attack threw the Level 150 Guard General into a wall.

The Mechanical Slayer then brandished its greatsword repeatedly, creating a storm that engulfed the entire Teleportation Hall. In retaliation, the other guards began a frenzied assault on the Mechanical Slayer.

After a short moment, the entire Teleportation Hall had changed beyond recognition.

Under the barrage of the countless sword auras, none of the Level 150 guards survived. Even the ten Tier 1 Guard Captains and the Tier 2 Guard General died under the Mechanical Slayer’s sword.

Meanwhile, the Mechanical Slayer still had 91% of its HP remaining.

“Just what kind of monster is this?” Lone Tyrant could not believe his own eyes. Before today, players had believed that these NPC guards were invulnerable, yet, they had all been annihilated, while the Mechanical Slayer remained healthy.

There had been over a hundred Level 150 guards. A Tier 2 NPC had even led the attack, but, in the end, they all died. At this point, Lone Tyrant began to wonder if anyone could defeat the Mechanical Slayer.

Seated on top of a roof, Shi Feng enjoyed a few refreshments while resting. Previously, to dodge the Mechanical Slayer’s attacks, Shi Feng had exhausted himself, both mentally and physically. Meanwhile, the arrival of the guards had been the perfect chance to break away from the battle and rest. Only, he had not imagined that his break would be so short-lived.

“A Mutant mutated from a High Lord is scary indeed. With this, I can safely proceed with the next part of the plan,” Shi Feng smiled, shifting his gaze towards the tens of thousands of players in a distance who currently rushed towards the battle.
