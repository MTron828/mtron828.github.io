Chapter 2916 – Solomon’s Sword

When Shi Feng chose to recast Solomon’s Sword, the five fragments of Solomon’s Sword appeared in front of him one after another.

Killing Ray, Disaster Blade, Netherworld Brilliance, Night Slayer, and Broken Steel.

The five longswords resonated with one another and released a dazzling brilliance.

A few seconds later, the five longswords fused, transforming into a crimson longsword with black markings. Black electric arcs flickered around the blade of the weapon, their presence repeatedly shattering the surrounding space.

The instant the crimson longsword took shape, Fang Shihan was stunned.

A Legendary Weapon? At this point, Fang Shihan was already familiar with the aura of Legendary Weapons. After all, Zero Wing had five. Besides Shi Feng’s Light of Two Worlds, Gentle Snow, Aqua Rose, and Yan Tianxing each had a Legendary Weapon. Recently, Violet Cloud had also finally upgraded her Death’s Sigh to the Legendary rank.

Every Legendary Weapon could grant its user the power to transcend tiers. With a Legendary Weapon, a Tier 5 player would instantly become an existence close to rivaling Tier 6 Gods. Legendary Weapons far exceeded Fragmented Legendary Weapons in performance.

After Solomon’s Sword took shape, Shi Feng excitedly grabbed it and checked its statistics.

Cooldown: 10 minutes.

Created by the Ancient God of Thunder. Solomon’s Sword possesses the power source of an Ancient God, and it is capable of destroying all things.

As expected of one of the Ten Great Legendary Weapons. Its Attributes are not the slightest bit inferior to the Light of Two Worlds’s. Shi Feng was astonished when he read Solomon’s Sword’s statistics.

The Light of Two Worlds was a weapon focused on improving its wielder’s Life Rating, while Solomon’s Sword focused on improving its wielder’s soul. The effects of the two weapons were of equal importance. When used together, they easily surpassed other Legendary Weapon pairings.

Although Shi Feng still hadn’t reached Tier 6, both his Life Rating and Soul were now close to reaching the Tier 6 standard. If he were to fight Los Ferid, the commander of the Outerworld’s 19th Army Corps, he could probably gain the upper hand even without using Golden Soul.

“By the way, there’s one more important matter I need to tell you, Guild Leader,” Fang Shihan said. She then took out an invitation card made entirely of Seven Luminaries Crystal and handed it to Shi Feng. “This is the invitation the Five Great Super Guilds sent to all first-rate Guilds and above in God’s Domain. They are hosting a conference in Blackwing City tomorrow to discuss countermeasures for the Outerworld forces and that mysterious youth.”

“Seven Luminaries Crystal? What a generous move.” Shi Feng was a little surprised when he looked at the invitation card in his hand.

Seven Luminaries Crystal was a resource the various superpowers were desperately trying to acquire. Even though Zero Wing had done the same, the Guild only had a stockpile of 160,000 units and dared not spend them recklessly. Yet, the Five Great Super Guilds had used Seven Luminaries Crystals to create the invitation cards they sent to the various Guilds. Moreover, this invitation card wasn’t just a plain card; it had a special teleportation array engraved on it that allowed the card’s owner to teleport to Blackwing City.

Shi Feng estimated that one invitation card would cost at least five Seven Luminaries Crystals to make. Meanwhile, there were easily over a thousand first-rate Guilds, super-first-rate Guilds, and Super Guilds in God’s Domain. In other words, the Five Great Super Guilds would’ve had to spend at least 5,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals.

“The Seven Luminaries Crystal invitation card is the highest-ranking invitation. Below it are Mana Stone and Magic Crystal invitation cards,” Fang Shihan explained. “According to the different invitation cards, the number of companions one can bring along will differ as well. The Magic Crystal invitation only allows you to bring one companion, while the Mana Stone invitation allows for two companions, and the Seven Luminaries Crystal invitation allows for four companions.”

“Even so, this is still plenty amazing. Creating these special teleportation items alone would cost a pretty penny, after all,” Shi Feng said. If it were up to him, he definitely wouldn’t be willing to spend so much just to host a conference.

Of course, the fact that the Five Great Super Guilds were willing to go so far also showed how much of a threat the mysterious youth was. Even in his previous life, he had never once seen such a grand conference in God’s Domain.

“Are we going?” Fang Shihan couldn’t help asking. In terms of overall combat power, Zero Wing was currently the undisputed number one Guild in God’s Domain. The Guild also wouldn’t have any problems defending the Twin Towers Kingdom and its several Guild Cities. Hence, it didn’t really matter whether Zero Wing participated in this conference or not. Moreover, Zero Wing was enemies with two of the Five Great Super Guilds.

“Of course we’re going!” Shi Feng said, smiling. “Have Fire, Violet, and Tianxing get ready. The four of you are coming with me.”

At this point, he no longer cared about the Outerworld’s NPC army. However, it was a different story for the Scholar.

According to Zero Wing’s investigations, the Scholar had deep ties with the Outerworld’s NPCs. It was quite likely that Shi Feng would have to face the Outerworld’s NPC army when he met with the Scholar again. Hence, he had to get the help of God’s Domain’s player forces. After all, the various kingdoms and empires had opened up their treasuries because of the War of Worlds. With the various promotion resources these treasuries offered, the players of God’s Domain would improve rapidly.

At the current rate, Tier 5 players would probably start popping up in larger numbers in another one or two months. At that time, the various superpowers’ advantages would start to reveal themselves, and they would become significantly more useful than they were now.

Most importantly, Zero Wing could take advantage of this Guild conference to solidify its position in God’s Domain. After all, Zero Wing currently had very little influence in the western continent. Moreover, because the western continent wasn’t involved in the War of Worlds, the western continent’s exploration of Dungeons and ruins was significantly faster than the eastern continent’s.

“I’ll notify them right away.”

Fang Shihan nodded to Shi Feng’s command. Truthfully, she was very interested in this gathering. After all, once the conference ended, the experts of the various Guilds would interact with each other.

These interactions might not seem like much on the surface, but they would allow experts to learn about different combat techniques and expand their knowledge of Mana. If she was lucky and received inspiration, she might be able to create her Tier 5 Mana Body.

Currently, her Mana Body’s Completion Rate had reached 120%, and she couldn’t improve it, no matter how much she tried. Rather than persisting in her current training, it would be much better to spar with other experts.

Early the next morning, Shi Feng teleported to Blackwing City together with Fang Shihan and the others. As for Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose, they were tasked with keeping guard over Zero Wing’s Guild Cities and the Twin Towers Kingdom as a precaution.

Blackwing City, Teleportation Hall:

Along with a flash of light, Shi Feng’s group of five arrived in the Teleportation Hall’s central teleportation array.

Blackwing City was much more crowded than normal. Apart from the experts of the invited Guilds, experts from uninvited Guilds and independent players were also in the city.

The Five Great Super Guilds had invited all of God’s Domain’s first-rate Guilds and above to attend the conference this time. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that most of God’s Domain’s top experts were gathered in Blackwing City today. This was a situation that normally couldn’t be found in any city.

Even if the uninvited Guilds and independent players couldn’t participate in the conference, they could still get a look at God’s Domain’s strongest players. If they were fortunate, they might even get to see these top experts sparring with each other.

Hence, when news of the Five Great Super Guilds holding a grand conference got out, countless Guilds and players sought to enter Blackwing City.

If not for Blackwing City requiring an entry pass, players would’ve long since flooded the city to the point of overflowing. Nonetheless, the number of players currently gathered in Blackwing City still exceeded 30 million.

Moreover, most of the players roaming Blackwing City’s streets were Tier 3. Tier 4 players were also present in large numbers. In the current Blackwing City, even Refinement Realm experts would have to act carefully and humbly. Otherwise, there was a high chance they would end up offending a Flowing Water Realm expert or even a Void Realm expert.

When Shi Feng arrived at the Blackwing Auction House, the designated conference venue, he found that over a thousand Tier 4 experts belonging to the Five Great Super Guilds had established a perimeter.

Even the weakest among these Tier 4 experts was at Level 170 and geared in Level 180 Dark-Gold Set Equipment. Quite a number of these experts also had four to five pieces of Level 180 Epic Equipment and Weapons. As for the five players standing in the lead, not only were they over Level 180, but even the weakest piece of equipment on them was Level 180 Epic Equipment. All five of these players also boasted a Fragmented Legendary Weapon paired with two or three pieces of Fragmented Legendary Equipment. These players thoroughly displayed the Five Great Super Guilds’ might.

With all these Tier 4 players gathered in front of the Blackwing Auction House, the terrifying aura they exuded deterred even ordinary Tier 4 players from approaching the building.

“This is crazy! So, this is the Five Great Super Guilds’ strength?”

“Crap! Our Guild barely has any Level 180 Epic Equipment, yet every one of the Five Great Super Guilds’ Tier 4 experts has at least

one!”

“I think that any one of those five people standing in the lead can easily beat up our entire Guild!”

“Who do you think you are? Your Guild is only a third-rate Guild! Those five people wouldn’t have trouble wiping out even second-rate Guilds! Do you know who those people are? They’re the strongest talents belonging to the Five Great Super Guilds’ younger generation! I heard that not only have all five of them reached the Domain Realm, but their Mana Bodies are even above the 110% Completion Rate! They are all bona fide monsters!”

“It’s a pity our Guild isn’t a first-rate Guild. Otherwise, we would get to participate in the conference too.”

The players crowding the street outside the Blackwing Auction House spoke with awe as they looked at the Five Great Super Guilds’ members. At the same time, they also felt envious of the players participating in the conference this time. After all, if they could learn a thing or two from one of the Five Great Super Guilds’ Tier 4 experts, it would easily save them several months of training.

Amid the crowd’s hushed discussions, Tier 4 experts approached the Blackwing Auction House and presented their invitation cards one after another. Then the Five Great Super Guilds’ experts ushered them into the Auction House.

At one point, when the leader of a three-man group presented a Seven Luminaries Crystal invitation, a commotion immediately erupted among the bystanders.

This was because the middle-aged man, who was the leader of this three-man group, was actually a Tier 5 expert-one nobody had ever heard of before.

“What a bunch of ignorant fools. Do they think only superpowers can produce Tier 5 experts?” one of the three-man group’s members, a female Great Wizard holding a crimson staff, scoffed as she looked at the surrounding crowd scornfully. “Sooner or later, our name of Shadow Vengeance will echo throughout God’s Domain!”

She felt only contempt for the various superpowers’ experts. This was because the various superpowers’ experts had relied on an astronomical amount of resources to develop themselves. In comparison, she and the experts of her Guild had achieved their current strength through one battle after another.

“I heard that the eastern continent’s Zero Wing would be attending as well. Between Guild Leader and Black Flame, I wonder, who is stronger?” the third member of the group, a brown-haired youth, said excitedly.

“Of course, our Guild Leader is stronger! That Black Flame is only famous because he’s the first person to reach Tier 5,” the female Great Wizard sneered.

She had great confidence in Iron Soul, their Guild Leader. This was because Iron Soul could receive a Tier 5 Legendary monster’s attack and survive while at Tier 4. Now that Iron Soul had reached Tier 5, his strength was immeasurable.

Iron Soul, the middle-aged man, did not refute his companion’s words, either. One of his goals in participating in the conference this time was to spar with God’s Domain’s other Tier 5 players and use this opportunity to bring Shadow Vengeance’s name to fame.

However, shortly after the Great Wizard finished speaking, crisp and sweet laughter entered the ears of their group of three.

“What a bold claim! I wonder if your Guild Leader really is as strong as you say he is?”

As soon as these words fell, the trio from Shadow Vengeance turned toward the source of the voice and found themselves looking at a group of five. The one who spoke was a tall woman with an alluring body clad in dark-red leather-Zero Wing’s Fire Dance.

“Four Tier 5s?”

Currently, Shi Feng’s group of five did not bother concealing their identities or statistics. Hence, the surrounding crowd gasped when they saw their tiers.

Tier 5 players were basically mythical existences in the current God’s Domain. Most superpowers didn’t even have one Tier 5 player under their command, yet Zero Wing had gained three more Tier 5 players aside from Black Flame, Gentle Snow, and Aqua Rose.

At this time, the trio from Shadow Vengeance felt pressured. They never thought that Zero Wing was this strong.

If it were a one-on-one, Iron Soul was confident he could still put up a fight. However, he would only be seeking his own death if he tried to fight four Tier 5 experts. After all, anyone capable of reaching Tier 5 definitely wasn’t a weakling. If Tier 5 experts worked together, it wouldn’t merely be a simple addition of combat power. Instead, their combat power would rise exponentially.

Just when the female Great Wizard from Shadow Vengeance was about to say something, Fire Dance suddenly disappeared from everyone’s sight. Before Iron Soul and his companions could react, Fire Dance was already standing in front of the three of them. Her movements were even more astonishing than someone using Instantaneous Movement.

Someone using Instantaneous Movement would at least generate spatial fluctuations that others could detect. However, Fire Dance’s movements generated neither sound nor fluctuation. Her presence had even disappeared completely when she moved. By the time Iron Soul’s group detected her presence again, she had already crossed the 100-yard distance between them, as if she had been standing in front of them all along.

“If you want to fight our Guild Leader, you’ll have to go through me first,” Fire Dance said, smiling as she looked at Iron Soul’s group. She then disappeared and reappeared by Shi Feng’s side. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Only after Shi Feng’s group of five had entered the Blackwing Auction House did the Tier 4 players outside the Auction House snap out of their daze.

What amazing footwork! Iron Soul had a grim expression as he looked at Fire Dance’s departing figure.

“Guild Leader, did you manage to see what she did?” the female Great Wizard couldn’t help asking.

Tier 5 players possessed far superior Life Ratings than Tier 4 players. There was even a massive gap in Basic Attributes. Hence, it was incredibly difficult for a Tier 4 player like herself to perceive the movements of a Tier 5 player. However, it should be a different story for Iron Soul. He could speed up his thoughts twofold with his Tier 5 Concentration, so he should be able to perceive Fire Dance’s movements.

“I didn’t,” Iron Soul said, shaking his head. In a quiet tone, he added, “Rather than saying that she’s fast, it’d be more appropriate to say that she exists everywhere within her Mana Domain. The mastery she has over her Mana Domain far exceeds mine.”

“Is she that strong?” The female Great Wizard was astonished.

Since someone as strong as Iron Soul had said so, even if she didn’t want to, she had no choice but to acknowledge that Fire Dance was probably stronger than Iron Soul. After recollecting himself, Iron Soul looked at his two companions and said, “There are countless experts in God’s Domain, and anyone capable of reaching Tier 5 is extraordinary. You should be more careful with your words. The fact that Black Flame has garnered such a reputation for himself proves that he isn’t weak.”

At this point, Iron Soul no longer had any plans to ask Shi Feng for a spar. After all, his chances of defeating even Fire Dance were slim already. What qualifications did he have to challenge God’s Domain’s strongest player?

Besides Shadow Vengeance, the other player forces originating from the western continent promptly stopped underestimating Zero Wing. This was especially true for the superpowers that had managed to produce Tier 5 players.

Time passed quickly, the number of Guilds gathered in the Blackwing Auction House continuously increasing.

Several hours later, all of the invited Guilds had finally arrived. Over a thousand Guilds were attending the conference, bringing more than 2,000 Tier 4 players and 23 Tier 5 players in all. The number of Tier 5 players attending the conference far exceeded everyone’s expectations.

Of the 23 Tier 5 players in attendance, ten belonged to the Five Great Super Guilds. Apart from the original five Tier 5 players, the Five Great Super Guilds had each produced one more Tier 5 player during this period. The Secret Pavilion, Battle Wolves, Flower of Seven Sins, Violet Sword, Sacred Temple, and Divine Tribe had each produced one Tier 5 player as well. And in addition to Shadow Vengeance, two other first-rate Guilds had also produced one Tier 5 player each.

Even Shi Feng did not expect such a development.

With this revelation, the hierarchy of God’s Domain’s player forces was bound to change drastically.

However, compared to the change in God’s Domain’s power hierarchy, the information the Five Great Super Guilds and Secret Pavilion shared was even more astonishing. According to their investigations, the mysterious youth had actually unified the Outerworld’s NPC army. Currently, all of the Outerworld’s NPCs scattered across the eastern continent were quietly making their way to the Fire Dragon Empire.

This revelation put a grim expression on everyone’s face.

Needless to say, the mysterious youth intended to strike at the Fire Dragon Empire, one of God’s Domain’s Four Great Empires, by gathering such a large force. Although they didn’t know the mysterious youth’s aim, if the Fire Dragon Empire disappeared, the eastern continent would probably be doomed as well.

“That basically sums up the situation.” After the Secret Pavilion’s Yuan Tiexin shared all of the investigation results with everyone in the hall, he said, “Currently, the eastern continent’s various kingdoms and empires have started sending troops to the Fire Dragon Empire already. They are also doing their best to hinder the Outerworld NPC army’s movements. However, we estimate that the Outerworld NPC army will finish gathering in, at most, another month. Once the Outerworld NPCs have gathered, they will launch an all-out attack on the Fire Dragon Empire.

“To weaken the Outerworld NPCs, we need to conduct guerilla warfare together with the various kingdoms and empires and try to reduce the Outerworld NPC army’s strength as much as possible!”

However, just as Yuan Tiexin was about to go into detail about the Secret Pavilion and the Five Great Super Guilds’ plan to weaken the Outerworld’s NPC army, a commotion suddenly erupted outside the Blackwing Auction House.

The next moment, the space within the stadium-sized conference venue shattered, and two eight-winged women walked out of the shattered space. The aura that the two alluring women radiated immobilized all of the Tier 4 players present; only the Tier 5 players could barely move. “Fallen Archangels?!”

“Why would they appear here?”

Everyone doubted their eyes when they saw the two alluring women.

Fallen Angels were existences close to rivaling Dragons, while Fallen Archangels rivaled Divine Dragons. Meanwhile, the two women before them were both bona fide Level 200, Tier 5 Fallen Archangels. In an era where Tier 6 Gods had disappeared from the mortal world, Tier 5 Fallen Archangels were no different from Gods.

“Heaven-blessed individuals, hand over the Seven Treasures!”

After declaring the reason for their presence, one of the Fallen Archangels turned to Shi Feng, while the other faced a Tier 5 middle-aged man, Iron Soul.

They’re going straight for the Seven Treasures? Shi Feng’s expression turned solemn as he looked at the two Fallen Archangels.

Shi Feng already had a huge headache dealing with the Scholar. However, he never thought that the Scholar could get two Fallen Archangels to do his bidding. This situation was simply inconceivable.

Others might not know the true extent of a Tier 5 Fallen Archangel’s strength, but he did.

In the past, he had watched a Tier 6 God-ranked expert clash with a Tier 5 Fallen Archangel. That person was none other than Endless Scars, the number one expert on God’s Domain’s Experts List at the time.

Back then, despite wielding a Legendary Weapon, Endless Scars had struggled to kill a Level 220, Tier 5 Fallen Archangel. If an ordinary Tier 6 God-ranked expert encountered a Tier 5 Fallen Archangel, their only option was to run away. After all, a Tier 5 Fallen Archangel could slay a Tier 6 God-ranked expert by relying on their immensely high HP.

Now, two Fallen Archangels had appeared in the Blackwing Auction House!
