Chapter 206 – Golden Law

When Shi Feng walked into the simple yet elegant office, he quickly noticed the room’s uniqueness.

Even though the Mana outside was already plenty dense, the density of the Mana inside this office was actually more than double that of the outside world. The Mana here was infinitely close to reaching the liquid state, and Shi Feng felt like he was standing inside the Elven Holy Spring.

A Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array??Shi Feng was rendered speechless when he saw the room’s magic array arrangement.

As its name suggested, a Mana Gathering Magic Array could gather Mana to elevate the Mana density within a specified area. Meanwhile, the higher a Mana Gathering Array’s quality, the greater its rarity. One would be hard-pressed to buy Master Mana Gathering Arrays even if one had the money. As for Grandmaster Mana Gathering Arrays, they were incredibly rare even in the Greater God’s Domain, and one could even trade it for a Fragmented Legendary item for it.

Yet, Laura Crader had set up such a valuable magic array in her office. This was simply an extravagance.

It should be known that Grandmaster Mana Gathering Arrays were typically set up together with a Guild Hall’s core magic array. While doing so would reduce the magic array’s potency since it would need to cover a much larger area, it could still elevate the Guild Hall’s Mana to a mist-like standard.

When Shi Feng shifted his attention away from the Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array and focused on Laura Crader, he couldn’t help but be stunned momentarily.

Currently, Laura Crader was standing in the room, quietly looking at a stone tablet on the wall. The combination of her long, light-blue hair, silver crown, and radiant light-blue longsword gave her the image of a Valkyrie of legends. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, rather than Laura’s appearance, what stunned Shi Feng was the broken tablet covered in divine inscriptions and patterns.

Shi Feng had seen a broken tablet of a similar type in the Greater God’s Domain during his previous life. Meanwhile, the broken tablet’s name was capable of shaking the entire Greater God’s Domain.

Golden Law!

According to legends, there were 88 Broken Laws in the Greater God’s Domain, and every one of them recorded a complete Gold Combat Technique.

It should be known that Silver Combat Techniques were incredibly rare even in the Greater God’s Domain. The appearance of one could cause even hegemonic powers to go into a frenzy. This was because any player that mastered a Silver Combat Technique would gain the ability to transcend tiers.

As for Gold Combat Techniques, any player who managed to master one would become an existence feared by even the various apex powers.

“You’re here. Please, take a seat!” Laura Crader said, smiling when she noticed Shi Feng entering the room. “Let me introduce myself. I am Laura Crader, the commander of the Glimmer adventurer team. I have taken the liberty of inviting you here today because I wish to make a deal with you, Mr. Black Flame.”

“A deal? May I know what you have in mind, Miss Laura?” Shi Feng asked curiously.

Laura was without a doubt the person with the greatest authority and wealth in Slumber City, while he was only an outsider. He found it hard to imagine that he possessed anything that could attract Laura’s attention.

“I’ve also offered this deal to Shadow City’s three Vice City Lords,” Laura said. Then, she pointed at the broken tablet on the wall and said, “Bring my companions and me out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm and into the Greater God’s Domain. I will give you this stone tablet and the Gold Combat Technique recorded on it if you can do that. As someone from outside the Stratified Abyssal Realm, I am sure I don’t need to explain to you the value of a Gold Combat Technique, right?”

“How are you so certain I am from outside the Stratified Abyssal Realm, Miss Laura? Moreover, how are you certain I can take you out of here and to the Greater God’s Domain?” Shi Feng asked, feeling a little surprised by Laura’s offer.

The value of a Golden Law surpassed even Divine Artifacts. Yet, Laura had boldly revealed her possession of one and even offered to give it away. Unless she was sufficiently confident, there was no way she would take such a risk. After all, many powers originating from the Greater God’s Domain operated in the Stratified Abyssal Realm. If they learned about Laura’s possession of a Golden Law, they would use every means they had to snatch it.

“It’s because I, too, come from outside the Stratified Abyssal Realm. Meanwhile, players from outside the Stratified Abyssal Realm have a completely different approach toward Mana manipulation than players native to the Stratified Abyssal Realm. So, it isn’t difficult to tell the two groups apart,” Laura answered. “As for why I have sought you out to make this deal, it is because you have the necessary qualifications, Mr. Black Flame.”

“Qualifications? What qualifications?” Shi Feng grew even more confused.

“Strength. Any outsider who has reached the fourth-floor standard is qualified to do business with me,” Laura said. “Or, more specifically, only powers capable of sending fourth-floor experts like you into a Stratified Abyssal Realm can help us leave this place.”

“I see.” Realization dawned on Shi Feng.

The task of getting a Stratified Abyssal Realm’s native players out to the Greater God’s Domain before complete integration occurred was incredibly challenging and costly. Moreover, the stronger the native player was, and the sooner one was trying to get this native player out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm, the greater the cost one would have to pay.

Typically, any power willing to let a fourth-floor expert enter a Stratified Abyssal Realm should have extraordinary strength. After all, a player capable of reaching the World Tower’s third floor would typically be a Tier 6 God-ranked expert already. At worst, a third-floor expert would be a Tier 5 player. It went without saying that a fourth-floor expert would be a Tier 6 God-ranked expert.

Meanwhile, sending a fourth-floor expert into a Stratified Abyssal Realm would mean having this fourth-floor expert abandon his original level and tier. This was not a risk an ordinary power could afford to take.

“If you don’t have any problems, we can establish a contract now. So long as you bring us out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm and into the Greater God’s Domain, I will hand this Golden Law to you immediately,” Laura said with a serious expression. “In addition, we will also help you once to the best of our abilities. It doesn’t matter whether you want us to clash against the Greater God’s Domain’s hegemonic powers or apex powers!”

Laura spoke in a definitive tone, making it sound like fighting against the Greater God’s Domain’s apex powers wasn’t an impossible task for her.

If players from the Greater God’s Domain were to hear Laura’s statement, they would most likely laugh at her for her ignorance.

However, Shi Feng did not rush to answer Laura, and neither did he ridicule Laura for her suggestion. Instead, he asked, “May I know how many people you are trying to bring out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm, Miss Laura?”

“Four,” Laura answered, a flash of confusion appearing in her eyes as she looked at Shi Feng.

When she offered this deal to other people, their first reaction would be to accept it without hesitation. None of them had bothered asking how many people she was trying to bring out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm.

When one talked about taking native players out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm, it was only a question of whether one could or could not do so. The question of whether one was bringing a player or a group of players out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm did not exist.

Yet, Shi Feng’s first question was to ask how many players she was trying to bring.

“That’s not too many.” Shi Feng sighed in relief when he heard Laura’s answer.

If Laura planned to bring the entire Glimmer adventurer team out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm, he would most likely have to disappoint her. After all, he neither had the manpower nor resources to search for a way to bring such a large group of players out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm.

However, if it was only four players, he could simply spend 3,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal to open a World-Breaking Gate. Now that he had access to a large supply of Hypersensitivity Potions, obtaining a large number of Seven Luminaries Crystals would be no trouble.

“Do you have a way to take us out, Mr. Black Flame?” Laura asked, her gaze turning fiery when she heard Shi Feng’s words.

“I do!” Shi Feng said definitively. “Only, we might have to change the content of our deal.”
