Chapter 440 – Saint’s Sword

TL Notes:

Made a change to Chapter 439:

Original:

“This woman’s too strong, Northlight,” the middle-aged man, who had transformed into a giant beast, said to the young man, who had strengthened his fists, through the team chat.

Changed to:

“This woman’s too strong, Northlight,” the young man who had transformed into a giant beast said to the young man with strengthened fists through the team chat.

The author switched to referring to the “beastified middle-aged man” as a “young man” in Chapter 440. I’m not sure what he wants, but I’ll go with “young man” since it’s in the latest chapter.

…

“Sir Lionheart!”

When White Owl turned to look at the Tier 5 Grand Wizard, who had just killed two of the Holy Race’s experts, a hint of reverence appeared in her eyes.

Unrestrained Lionheart!

This was a name known by all in the Greater God’s Domain. It was the name of an expert who had entered the Luminous Glory List’s top 100 ten years ago and was now serving as a vice commander of the Red Dragon Nation’s main force.

As for the Red Dragon Nation, it was a pseudo-apex power whose existence eclipsed even the Paimon Conglomerate. Although the Paimon Conglomerate was one of the Starlight Realm’s overlords, its strength paled when compared to the Guild known as the Red Dragon Nation.

White Owl might seem like the leader of the caravan escort this time, but in reality, Unrestrained Lionheart was the escort’s leader.

However, truth be told, White Owl never thought Unrestrained Lionheart would reveal his strength so soon. She originally thought he would rather collect more information on the Holy Race than save the escort team from annihilation. After all, information on the Holy Race was much more valuable than a mere 100-man team.

Death Omen and Thousand Scars were also greatly excited when they saw the numerous icicles dancing in mid-air.

Fifth-floor experts were crucial in campaigning and safeguarding fortresses in the Void Sea. Rarely would such experts operate in the Greater God’s Domain’s various Realms. So, it was normally nigh impossible for the two of them to see a fifth-floor expert in action. It was especially so for a fifth-floor expert like Unrestrained Lionheart. After all, most fifth-floor experts would be at Tier 6. Very few would remain at lower tiers, such as Tier 4 or Tier 5.

Meanwhile, being able to witness a fifth-floor expert in action was a valuable learning opportunity for non-fifth-floor experts. It was especially so when the fifth-floor expert in question had yet to reach Tier 6. This was because one could get a clear look and feel of the fifth-floor expert’s godlike techniques.

“Everyone, retreat!”

When Northlight saw two of his team’s top combatants getting killed, he froze for a moment before hurriedly calling for a retreat through the team chat.

Meanwhile, as soon as Northlight finished giving the command to retreat, he promptly turned around and fled. As for his two companions, they similarly fled without hesitation.

In the blink of an eye, Northlight and his two companions had already moved over a hundred yards away from the caravan. Although White Owl tried to chase after the three Holy Race experts, she simply couldn’t keep up with their speed, and the distance between them continuously widened.

Is there such a huge gap in our Physiques and Basic Attributes? White Owl was astonished as she looked at the Holy Race trio, who were already more than 200 yards away from her. Even though she was one tier above the trio, her Movement Speed was inferior to the Holy Race trio when they gathered their Holy Aura around their legs.

…

“How are we so unlucky? Of all the aliens we could have encountered, we just had to come across one who has reached the Realm of God already,” the beastified young man complained when he saw that they had already shaken off White Owl.

“Don’t complain. We might not have annihilated them, but we’ve gained a significant harvest this time,” Northlight said, chuckling. “If we bring back the information we collected, His Highness will reward us handsomely for it!”

Hearing Northlight’s words, the young man of the trio who was the fastest of the trio nodded excitedly and said, “With this information, His Highness will be able to conquer this new land and make it into the Holy Race’s territory in no time!”

While the trio was conversing and advancing through the Flameheart Canyon, they suddenly spotted someone standing in the path ahead of them.

At this time, Shi Feng stood in the middle of the canyon with his eyes narrowed and the Winter of Eternal Night unsheathed. He had long expected the Holy Race’s players to flee into the Flameheart Canyon, so he had chosen to wait for them here ahead of time.

“A mere Level 137 trash dares stand in our way?” When the beastified youth saw Shi Feng intending to stand in their way, he bellowed, “You must be tired of living!”

“Why waste words with him? Let’s just get rid of him and be on our way. If we let that Realm of God expert catch up to us, none of us will be leaving here alive,” the young man who had focused all of his Holy Aura into his legs said with disregard.

Nodding in agreement, Northlight said, “Indeed. There’s no point wasting time on trash. We’ll leave him to you, Forest Ape.”

“Leave it to me,” Forest Ape, the youth who had focused all of his Holy Aura into his legs, said with a nonchalant smile. Then, he further accelerated his advance.

In the blink of an eye, Forest Ape had moved several dozen yards away from Northlight and the beastified youth. Then, in only two seconds, he had shortened the distance between himself and Shi Feng from 500 yards to 100 yards.

When White Owl and the others saw this scene from a distance, they couldn’t help but be astonished.

His speed just now still wasn’t his all?

When White Owl saw the many afterimages Forest Ape left behind in his trail, it quickly became obvious to her that Forest Ape hadn’t been going all out when fighting against her. At this time, Forest Ape’s Movement Speed was at least 30% faster than when he fought her.

Different from White Owl, Thousand Scars’ attention wasn’t on Forest Ape but on the male Swordsman standing in the middle of the canyon. In a confused tone, she muttered, “Why does that Swordsman look somewhat familiar?”

“Black…Flame!”

Death Omen’s eyes widened in shock as she looked at the Swordsman standing in the Holy Race trio’s way. Although Shi Feng wore a cloak that covered parts of his face, Death Omen had a Master Identification Skill. So, she could see some of Shi Feng’s personal information.

“Black Flame?”

When White Owl heard the name Death Omen called out, her initial reaction was to feel surprised, which was followed by joy.

Black Flame was an expert ranked among the Luminous Glory List. During the battle in the World Passage, even though he was only a Tier 4 player, he could already fight against Storm and Saint Arm, who were both Tier 5 players at the time. Although White Owl didn’t know how Black Flame managed to appear in the Eternal Realm after disappearing from the World Passage, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to hold back the Holy Race trio.

Meanwhile, so long as Black Flame could keep the Holy Race trio pinned until Unrestrained Lionheart arrived, the Holy Race trio, who were the quickest to escape out of all the Holy Race players, would not be leaving with their lives.

According to the information they gathered, if Holy Race players were to kill human players, the latter would be prohibited from logging into God’s Domain for two days on top of suffering the standard death penalty. And although there was no way to verify it, the reverse should also be true.

So, if they could eliminate all of the Holy Race players here, they could delay detailed information on the human race from falling into the Holy Race’s hands for two more days. If they could accomplish this, it would significantly help their subsequent operations.

While White Owl was feeling delighted, Forest Ape arrived within 20 yards of Shi Feng.

“Die!”

Forest Ape did not hold back in the slightest this time. After condensing the Holy Aura in his legs to the extreme, he began circling Shi Feng at extreme speeds, leaving behind over a dozen afterimages in his wake, all the while thrusting his hand at Shi Feng as if it were a spear. Forest Ape moved so quickly that even the average Tier 5 Assassin would have difficulty pinpointing his location.

Holy Devour!

However, Shi Feng did not even look at Forest Ape and simply executed a horizontal slash in a particular direction. After reaching the Extrasensory Realm, this was also the best slash he could execute at Tier 4.

Immediately afterward, Forest Ape and his afterimages simultaneously revealed an expression of agony as an indescribable pain spread across his entire body. Then, his HP fell to zero.

I died?

Forest Ape fell into a daze when he saw the world around him losing its color. It was also at this time he finally got to see what had caused his brief but excruciating experience.

Flames!

A sea of flames!

With only one slash, Shi Feng had transformed a radius of 100 yards into a sea of crimson flames. These flames also carried destructive power so great that they managed to distort the space within the canyon. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Meanwhile, Forest Ape wasn’t the only one incinerated by these destructive flames. Before Northlight and the beastified young man could react, they, too, were devoured by the flames…
