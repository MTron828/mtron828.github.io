Chapter 243 – Guild Promoted

Hundred Flow City, main street:

When Shi Feng and the others walked out of the Teleportation Hall, they found that the main street outside was similarly crowded with players. Players couldn’t even run in the spacious main street right now. At best, they could only walk at a quick pace.

After Shi Feng and the others took a few steps away from the Teleportation Hall, the players on the street suddenly stepped aside and created an empty path. Then, a 100-man team of players dressed in uniform equipment and clothing walked down this path. Meanwhile, the mere presence of these 100 players caused Liu Wusheng, Crimson Heart, Hidden Soul, and the others to step back subconsciously.

“Is this the strength of other God’s Domains?” A grave expression appeared on Liu Wusheng’s face when he saw the 100-man team.

Although this team only had one hundred members, Liu Wusheng could feel an oppressive feeling coming from every one of them. He felt he wouldn’t even be a match for these one hundred players in a one-on-one fight. Moreover, he could also sense a suffocating presence from several of these experts. The auras of these people had clearly reached the Tier 4 standard already.

Echoing Judgment, Wordless Ember, and Flowing Quicksand also wore serious expressions on their faces. Unlike Liu Wusheng, they knew exactly how terrifying this 100-man team was.

Every member of this 100-man team could rank within the top thirty of Slumber City’s Temple Knights. Among them, the several players walking at the front of the team were even more terrifying than Solitary Soul. Those several players were experts at the Vice City Lord level.

“Who are these people? Who would send such a powerful team here? Even hegemonic powers of Intermediate God’s Domains can’t afford to part with such a team!” a Level 120 Tigerkin with tanned skin exclaimed after seeing the 100-man team disappearing into the distance.

Upon hearing the Tigerkin Berserker’s words, a Level 120 elven man standing next to the Tigerkin rolled his eyes and said, “Are you a native of this Miniature Ancient World? How can you not know about the Divine Hunters Guild?”

“Divine Hunters? The Divine Hunters from the Four Saints Higher God’s Domain?” The Tigerkin Berserker was stunned.

“That’s right. That Divine Hunters. Otherwise, why do you think everyone made way for those people?” The elven man nodded. Then, he sighed and continued, “It seems Hundred Flow City is going to be the Divine Hunters Guild’s territory from now on. Guilds from Intermediate God’s Domains like ours won’t stand a chance here.”

“That’s not for certain, right? The Divine Hunters Guild might be powerful, but if hegemonic powers from Intermediate God’s Domains are willing to shoulder the cost, it’s not impossible for them to compete with the Divine Hunters. After all, there are only a few hundred cities in this Miniature Ancient World. There aren’t even enough to go around for the Intermediate God’s Domain, let alone the other Higher God’s Domains,” the Tigerkin Berserker said.

“What do you know!” With a bitter smile, the elven man said, “Now that the City System has been activated, the top ten players of each city’s Colosseum will receive a portion of their respective city’s management rights. However, Divine Hunters has sent six of its titled commanders here! It’s almost certain that Divine Hunters will have absolute control over Hundred Flow City!”

“What?! Is the Divine Hunters Guild crazy?! Is Hundred Flow City so important that it needed to send six titled commanders?!” the Tigerkin Berserker shouted in astonishment. “Those are Titled experts we are talking about!”

Upon hearing the Tigerkin Berserker’s words, the experts from the various God’s Domains were similarly astonished. Only Liu Wusheng and the players native to the Miniature Ancient World remained puzzled by this situation.

How extravagant of Divine Hunters. Shi Feng was also inwardly surprised by this situation.

The term “titled expert” referred to experts who had received a title from the Greater God’s Domain’s Seven Luminaries Alliance. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Players native to the Miniature Ancient World might not know the significance of a titled expert. However, players who had lived in the Greater God’s Domain would know that any expert who had received a title from the Seven Luminaries Alliance was like a war god in God’s Domain.

This was because every titled expert was an existence capable of going up against one hundred opponents of a similar level and tier simultaneously. They were top-tier existences even among fourth-floor experts!

“If we have to go up against so many experts, even maintaining our foothold in Hundred Flow City will be a challenge…” Su Qianliu experienced a headache when she saw the various God’s Domains’ experts that crowded the street.

Originally, Su Qianliu had been rather confident in Zero Wing’s future. However, after seeing so many experts appearing in Hundred Flow City, she doubted that Zero Wing could even retain its position in Hundred Flow City. This would be terrible for Zero Wing.

Only the various NPC Cities had teleportation arrays in the Miniature Ancient World. This meant that most trades between players would be conducted in NPC Cities. If Zero Wing couldn’t maintain its foothold in Hundred Flow City, it couldn’t even trade with other powers. Even if powers were willing to go through the hassle of trading with Zero Wing, they’d exploit Zero Wing to an unimaginable level.

At this time, Su Qianliu wasn’t the only one feeling pressured. Liu Wusheng, Galaxy Past, and Crimson Heart were in a similar situation.

The Miniature Ancient World might be rich in resources, but these resources were mainly concentrated in the trade network formed by the various NPC Cities. If they couldn’t join this trade network, they’d be isolated by the powers that were a part of it.

“You don’t need to worry about this. God’s Domain isn’t a place where you can achieve greatness with only a few experts,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “Sometimes, status is much more important than strength in God’s Domain!”

“Status?” Su Qianliu suddenly thought of the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s nobility system. Some of the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s Upper-class Nobles might not be as strong as Temple Knights, but they still enjoyed much better treatment in the various NPC Cities than Temple Knights.

However, another question quickly popped into Su Qianliu’s head.

How were they supposed to acquire status in the Miniature Ancient World’s NPC Cities?

Something like the Abyssal Tower did not exist in the Miniature Ancient World. Although the various cities had a peerage system, obtaining a noble title required a vastly greater sum of Contribution Points than obtaining an ordinary noble status, and it wasn’t something that could be accomplished within a short time.

However, Shi Feng did not offer any additional explanations. He simply had Su Qianliu and the others return to the Asura Mercenary Alliance to gather a large number of Magicians and collect the materials necessary to construct a teleportation array. Then, he made his way to Hundred Flow City’s Adventurer’s Association.

When Shi Feng arrived at the Adventurer’s Association, the building was crowded with players from other God’s Domains going through the procedures for Guild creation in the Miniature Ancient World.

“How may I help you, Sir?” a Half-elf female administrator working the front desk on the second floor asked when she saw Shi Feng approaching.

In response, Shi Feng took out the Bronze Cross-Border Guild Promotion Order and said, “Hello. I want to promote Zero Wing into a Bronze Guild.”
