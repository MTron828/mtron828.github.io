Currently, about a dozen or so people were sitting in the room…

Changed to:

Currently, several dozen people were sitting in the room…

…

Thunder Restaurant, top-floor VIP room:

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, silence enveloped the entire room. At the same time, the several dozen guests dining in the room couldn’t help but shudder.

How dare he?

Thousand Scars, clad in silver-gray leather armor, was also greatly surprised by Shi Feng’s response. For a moment, she even suspected that Shi Feng might not know Dira’s identity. Otherwise, there was no way he’d dare to turn down Dira’s offer without hesitation and in such a blatant manner.

The Paimon Conglomerate might not be as powerful as the Galaxy Conglomerate, but it was still a bona fide conglomerate in the Greater World. Meanwhile, Dira was the youngest and most favored son of the Divine Seal Saint, one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s Three Overlords.

Because of Dira’s identity, many of the Paimon Conglomerate’s successors sought to befriend Dira to gain the Divine Seal Saint’s support. After all, not only was the Divine Seal Saint one of Paimon’s Three Overlords, but he was also in control of many of the conglomerate’s cities and a strong contender for the position of the conglomerate’s number one expert.

In addition, the Divine Seal Saint also had the Divine Seal Legion under his command.

The Divine Seal Legion was made up solely of Tier 6 experts, and there were a whopping 500 of them. Just the number of Tier 6 experts the legion had already surpassed what hegemonic powers had by a large margin. Moreover, every one of these Tier 6 experts was in possession of two or three pieces of Legendary Equipment, with some even having Legendary Weapons.

Outside of the Paimon Conglomerate, though, Dira was an existence feared by everyone. This was because the Divine Seal Saint had proven that he was willing to destroy an upper-ranking hegemonic power simply because his youngest son received poor treatment from the power.

The war the Divine Seal Saint waged back then had shaken the entire Starlight Realm and struck fear into the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers. After the incident, everyone came to understand just how much the Divine Seal Saint favored his youngest son. It was so much that even the Paimon Conglomerate’s successors couldn’t help but grow envious of Dira.

It was also for this reason that the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ Guild Leaders would have a huge headache whenever they encountered Dira.

Although the power the Divine Seal Saint destroyed was only a budding upper-ranking hegemonic power that didn’t have the backing of a conglomerate, it should still be a very difficult task to destroy it completely. Yet, the Divine Seal Saint and his Divine Seal Legion had accomplished this feat, which was enough to showcase the legion’s tremendous strength.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng had essentially humiliated Dira in public by unceremoniously refusing Dira’s invitation in front of everyone. Not even the Green God Corporation’s helmsman wouldn’t dare to do such a thing…

“It seems he might not even be leaving this room alive,” a young male Assassin with pure elven blood said, a look of interest appearing on his face as he looked at Shi Feng. “I wonder how long he’ll last against the Four Beast Warriors?”

Meteor was seated next to the elven Assassin. When the Crimson Sword Emperor heard the elven Assassin’s words, he turned to look at the four middle-aged men and women standing behind Dira. Then, he said, “What nonsense are you talking about, Trecht? The Four Beast Warriors are guards sent by the Divine Seal Saint to protect Dira. Even though they don’t currently have the Fragmented Legendary Equipment Sets they normally use, I doubt you and I can take them on even if we get promoted to Tier 5. Not to mention, Black Flame is still at Tier 4.”

“Black Flame is still too young,” Trecht, the pure-blooded elf, said as he shook his head. “He might have surpassed Leroja and Cross, but a genius is nothing more than a genius at the end of the day. In front of individuals like Dira, even the Hundred Nations Paragon Battle’s First Paragon won’t amount to anything, let alone a measly kingdom’s First Paragon.”

The Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon?

Invincible among Tier 4?

These statuses might be enough to deter the various hegemonic powers, but they were nothing to Dira. Dira stood at the apex of the Greater God’s Domain. For him, geniuses and paragons like Shi Feng were but a common sight.

Thus, if Shi Feng refused to comply, Dira could simply crush him.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that a genius like Shi Feng had no qualifications to be arrogant in front of Dira. It was only because of Dira’s fondness for collecting geniuses that he had gone out of his way to recruit Shi Feng.

Since Shi Feng had outright refused Dira’s invitation, he had essentially made an enemy out of Dira. Now, not even the Green God Corporation could save him from this situation.

As soon as Trecht finished speaking, Platinum Behemoth, the leader of the Four Beast Warriors, lunged at Shi Feng with his battle axe. In response, Shi Feng executed a backhanded slash to meet the Berserker’s axe.

Boom!

Smoke instantly spread across the room as the two weapons collided. Fortunately, the power of the room’s defensive magic arrays was already raised to its limit. So, even though the power of the shockwaves generated by the collision reached the Tier 5 standard already, they failed to affect the room in the slightest.

Nobody present was surprised by the room’s robustness. Every structure within the Thunder Fortress was extraordinary. Not even Tier 5 players should think of causing any damage to the Thunder Fortress, let alone Tier 4 players.

However, when the dust settled, the spectating crowd couldn’t help but be surprised by what they saw.

Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Shi Feng did not get killed or injured by Platinum Behemoth’s axe. Instead, he had come out of the Berserker’s attack completely unscathed. Moreover, he had even stopped Platinum Behemoth’s axe, the massive weapon stopped half a meter away from him and could not advance even an inch further. At a glance, it was obvious that Shi Feng’s Strength Attribute was above Platinum Behemoth’s. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It seems his Strength has increased yet again…”

When Meteor, who was also a Swordsman like Shi Feng, saw Shi Feng holding his ground against Platinum Behemoth, he couldn’t help but be astonished. Compared to when he met Shi Feng at the Land of Ancient Dragons, the current Shi Feng’s Strength was clearly much higher. In fact, Shi Feng’s Strength had already reached the standard of Tier 5 Berserkers. Otherwise, there was no way Platinum Behemoth could have lost to Shi Feng in a contest of Strength.

“So he does have some strength. No wonder he dares to be so arrogant,” Trecht said, a hint of fighting spirit appearing in his eyes.

The Swordsman class wasn’t known for its Strength. Instead, it was a class with a good balance between Agility and Strength. If a Swordsman could match a Berserker of the same tier in Strength, the combat power the Swordsman could exhibit would be far more frightening than the Berserker.

While everyone was feeling surprised, Dira suddenly started clapping his hands.

“Not bad! Not bad!” Dira said as he resumed eating. “I don’t often see Swordsmen of the same tier matching Platinum’s Strength. I can give you another chance. Join my Shadow Guard Legion, and I will give you a vice team leader position. I will even forgive you for your previous rude behavior!”

However, Shi Feng remained indifferent even after hearing Dira’s words. Just when Platinum Behemoth was about to rebuke Shi Feng again, Shi Feng suddenly thrust the Winter of Eternal Night at the Berserker.

After Shi Feng obtained the Ancient Oath and gained 10% of the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon’s Basic Attributes, his Strength and Agility had already gone beyond the standard of ordinary Tier 5 Berserkers and Assassins.

Platinum Behemoth felt like a truck had just hit him when he blocked Shi Feng’s thrust with his axe, his body getting pushed back against his will. Then, before Platinum Behemoth could take proper defensive measures, the Winter of Eternal Night suddenly separated from his axe and cut across him horizontally.

Radiant Night!

Platinum Behemoth’s HP instantly fell to zero, his HP disappearing so quickly that not even the female Cleric standing behind him could heal him before his vision darkened and his body collapsed to the floor…

Immediately, shock and silence filled the room.

“I, Black Flame, do not need your forgiveness for my actions!”
