Chapter 3795 - 869 - Invaders?

Nightmare Holy City, White Dragon Nation’s Guild Residence:

Inside a grand meeting room, dozens of Level 237 experts and above were currently seated, surrounded by an oppressive atmosphere. The cause of this situation was the middle-aged man seated at the head of the conference table.

The middle-aged man was a ten-meter-tall giant with crimson hair, clad in dark-gray scale armor. Although the man did not say a word, his oppressive aura caused everyone in the room to break out in a cold sweat. Those who met the man’s gaze felt like a giant beast was staring at them.

The middle-aged man was Tyrant Wyvern, the Guild Leader of the White Dragon Nation.

“Who can tell me where these people came from?” Tyrant Wyvern asked indifferently as he watched the battle video of Shi Feng’s party. “So much time has passed, yet nobody can give me an answer?”

“Guild Leader, we have already put all our resources into the investigation. We’ve even employed many adventurer teams to look into the matter. But these people seem to have just appeared out of nowhere. We can’t find any information on them,” an executive hurriedly explained while wiping the sweat on his forehead.

After Fira was killed, she had promptly contacted them offline and told them to investigate Shi Feng’s party.

But regardless of the avenue they tried, the result was the same. Apart from these people’s IDs, they had failed to find any other information.

“These people killed over 200 of our experts, yet we don’t even know who they are?! Useless! All of you are useless!” Tyrant Wyvern exploded in anger. “Continue investigating! Also, have everyone in the Guild search for these people! Since these people dare to oppose us at this critical time, none of them should think about remaining in God’s Domain!”

“Understood!”

Everyone in the room nodded and quickly left to carry out Tyrant Wyvern’s orders. Nobody dared to drag their feet.

No information at all? Appeared out of nowhere? After watching the guild executives leave, Tyrant Wyvern suddenly frowned as he recalled a distant memory. Could they also be invaders, like Kowloon Demon?

…

While the White Dragon Nation was initiating a manhunt for Shi Feng’s party, an executive meeting also occurred in the Holy Knights’ Guild Residence.

“How interesting! A single party wiped out Fira’s entire team! Not even Kowloon Demon had such courage back then!” Dawn Forest, the Guild Leader of the Holy Knights, laughed after he watched the battle video of Shi Feng’s party.

This was definitely the first time the dreaded White Dragon Nation had been humiliated to such a degree. Despite going after the Pale Horn adventurer team with a team of over 200 experts, the White Dragon Nation concluded its operation without managing to kill any of the adventurer team’s members. On top of that, its forces were even annihilated.

Of course, any expert who had watched the battle video would also understand that the defeat of Fira’s team was not unwarranted. Shi Feng’s party was indeed strong. The only problem was that only a small fraction of players in Nightmare Holy City had access to the battle video. The majority only knew that over 200 experts from the White Dragon Nation had lost to a party of unknown individuals. This dealt a huge blow to the White Dragon Nation’s prestige.

“Guild Leader, how should we proceed?” Nocturne, a Level 238 female Ranger fully equipped with Fragmented Legendary Equipment, asked.

“The enemy of our enemy is our friend,” Dawn Forest said, grinning. Then, he turned to Nocturne and added, “Try to find these people and invite them to join us.”

“What if they refuse?” Nocturne asked.

“Refuse?” Dawn Forest scoffed. “Even if those people are strong, they’re still nothing in front of the White Dragon Nation. Their only choice if they want to survive is to join us. They will know what to do if they’re not stupid.”

“I understand.” Nocturne bowed and left the meeting room.

…

While Nightmare Holy City’s top two Guilds were searching for Shi Feng’s party, the players in the city excitedly discussed the party.

“What’s the situation?”

“Are these people crazy? How dare they kill the White Dragon Nation’s members?”

“I know, right? The White Dragon Nation and the Holy Knights are now offering astronomical prices for these people’s whereabouts. Several of the city’s top-ranking adventurer teams have already been tempted to join the search. Not even Kowloon Demon was as crazy as these people back then.”

“Indeed. Kowloon Demon only killed a couple of White Dragon Nation experts at the time. On the other hand, these people killed Fira, a Vice Guild Leader of the White Dragon Nation. She’s one of the top figures in the Guild.”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The White Dragon Nation is offering one Level 230 Fragmented Legendary item for the life of each member of this party. It would be great if I could kill one. I had to save up for two years to afford my current Level 230 Epic Leg Guards.”

When the resting players talked about Shi Feng’s party, their voices were filled with awe. They hadn’t expected such brave individuals to exist.

Besides the Holy Knights, nobody in Nightmare Holy City dared provoke the White Dragon Nation. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the two Guilds ruled over the city with an iron fist. Although many experts had tried to oppose the two Guilds in the past, only Kowloon Demon, the Holy City’s number one expert, managed to survive. Everyone else was forced to retire from God’s Domain permanently.

Now that Shi Feng’s party had killed over 200 experts and a Vice Guild Leader from the White Dragon Nation, it went without saying the Guild would not spare the party.

…

Amidst the discussions in Nightmare Holy City, Whirlwind Bulwark and his team led Shi Feng’s party into the city, their appearance instantly garnering exclamations from the players near the city’s entrance.

“Crap… Aren’t those the people who killed the White Dragon Nation’s experts?”

“It can’t be, right? Don’t they know the two Guilds are currently searching for them?”

“These people must be out of their minds! How dare they show up in the city?! Do they think the White Dragon Nation won’t dare touch them in the city? Or do they think the city’s low-level NPCs can protect them?”

“Are these people delusional? Have they not heard about the upstart Guild that provoked the White Dragon Nation a few years ago? When the White Dragon Nation obliterated that Guild in the city, none of the NPC guards could do anything about it.”

“Quick! Notify the White Dragon Nation!”

When the players at the entrance saw Shi Feng’s party leisurely strolling down the street and browsing shops, they were amazed and flabbergasted.

Even though Shi Feng and his party members had just thoroughly offended the White Dragon Nation, they dared to appear in the city. Their behavior could only be described as suicidal.

…

Shortly after Shi Feng’s party appeared in Nightmare Holy City, the news reached the White Dragon Nation and the Holy Knights.

“What? They’re strolling in the city now? Are you sure you didn’t mishear?” Dawn Forest was stunned.

“I’ve already had people verify it. It is them without a doubt,” Nocturne said very seriously.

“Good! I’ll head over immediately! Notify the others in the Guild and have them gather as quickly as possible!” Dawn Forest commanded.

…

Meanwhile, inside the White Dragon Nation’s Residence, Tyrant Wyvern’s expression darkened when he received the news.

“Good! Very good! You still dare to swagger in the city after killing my people?” Tyrant Wyvern fumed after hearing his subordinate’s report. “Have everyone in the Guild drop what they are doing and go after these people with me!”
