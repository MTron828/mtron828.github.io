Chapter 285 – This Is Zero Wing?

“The God List’s Asura Sword Emperor?” A Level 125 girl with short hair and golden pupils wearing silver holy armor muttered with a look of interest. “That’s quite a grand name. I wonder if we can achieve any improvements if we fight against him?”

“It should be possible,” the crimson-haired young man said in an uncertain tone. “I gained a lot of inspiration from the last time I fought the third-ranked Holy Nine. Seeing as Black Flame is ranked fourth, he shouldn’t be much worse than Holy Nine.”

“Should we take action now?” the short-haired girl with golden pupils asked excitedly as she grabbed the round shield and sharp axe she carried on her back.

“No, not today. The mission comes first,” the crimson-haired young man said as he moved his gaze away from Shi Feng and back to the temple before him. “Moreover, he’ll have to cross this hurdle first before he is qualified to fight me!”

“I guess you’re right.” The short-haired girl nodded and returned her shield and weapon to their original position.

“This goes the same for you, Omen. Before the mission is completed, I will not permit any member of the team to do anything else!” the crimson-haired young man said to Death Omen. Then, he smiled and continued, “But don’t worry. Once the mission is over, I’ll have Zero Wing cease its actions against the Flower of Seven Sins.”

Death Omen did not say anything and simply watched in silence as the temple’s stone doors slowly opened. However, she did not doubt the crimson-haired young man’s words in the slightest.

Whether it was the crimson-haired young man or the short-haired girl with golden pupils, both were bona fide monsters. Like Thousand Scars, the two were geniuses nurtured internally by the Paimon Conglomerate. Only, they had joined the Paimon Conglomerate a few years earlier than Thousand Scars. Because of this, they were strong enough to hold their ground against even Holy Nine, the third-ranked player on the God’s Domain Expert List.

So long as the two youths wished for it, Zero Wing would have no choice but to comply with their demands.

Moreover, it was just like the crimson-haired young man said. It was still uncertain whether Black Flame and his team could survive the upcoming battle.

…

“Let’s quickly withdraw while they’re not paying attention to us, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Colorful Lunarite said, cold sweat rolling down her forehead as she looked at the crimson-haired young man and short-haired girl with golden pupils. “The Paimon Conglomerate will always nurture some geniuses internally every year, and even the weakest of these experts would be a titled expert. Three years ago, two little monsters even appeared among these geniuses. They are the Crimson Sword Emperor Meteor and Divine Shield Star Snail.

“Both of them had fought the God List’s third-ranked Holy Nine previously. Although Holy Nine did not lose, he didn’t win, either. If not for the Paimon Conglomerate, the two of them would have most likely entered the God List’s top five already. Moreover, both of them are battle maniacs. If we end up fighting them, we will most likely be the ones to suffer…”

......

Colorful Lunarite didn’t think Shi Feng would lose to Meteor and Star Snail since Shi Feng was similarly one of the top five experts on the God-ranked Expert List. However, Shi Feng could, at most, stop one of those two if it came down to a fight.

“I’m afraid that’s not up to us to decide,” Shi Feng said as he looked at the threefold magic barrier that had suddenly formed around them. The magic barrier covered a radius of several hundred yards with the temple at the center, and it simply wasn’t something Tier 4 players could break.

Along with the threefold barrier’s formation, the temple’s doors also opened completely. Immediately afterward, an aura that caused everyone to tremble gushed out of the temple.

A moment later, a one-horned humanoid with a pair of pitch-black wings slowly walked out of the temple. This winged humanoid was five meters tall and wielded a scepter in his right hand. When subjected to the humanoid’s gaze, everyone present felt a chill crawling down their backs.

“A Demon King?!”

Colorful Lunarite gasped when he saw the winged humanoid.

A Demon King!

Demon King was the Tier 5 class for Demons. A Demon King was a bona fide Tier 5 lifeform, and it simply wasn’t an existence current players in the Miniature Ancient World could provoke. It was especially so when this Demon King was in a God Mode Regional Dungeon.

In God Mode Regional Dungeons, monsters would not be subjected to the system’s restrictions. Hence, they could exhibit 100% of their strength.

Moreover, the Demon King that had just walked out of the temple wasn’t an ordinary Demon King but a Demon Monarch who stood at the top of the Demon race instead. He was an existence capable of rivaling six-winged Valkyries of the same level.

The next moment, a system notification entered everyone’s ears.

…

System: Congratulations! You have triggered the Legendary Event Dragon Princess. Rewards unknown. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

…

Dragon Princess? Shi Feng was stunned when he saw the system notification.

At this point in time, the name of Dragon Princess was most likely foreign to most players in God’s Domain. However, during his previous life, the Dragon Princess was an existence known by all in the Greater God’s Domain.

In a time when Ancient Gods had disappeared from the Greater God’s Domain, the Dragon Princess was known to be comparable to Ancient Gods. At the same time, she was also the ruler of the Ancient Dragon Sanctuary, one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twelve Sanctuaries.

It should be known that the Greater God’s Domain was a vast place that connected countless God’s Domains. However, there were only twelve regions at the heart of the Greater God’s Domain, known as the Twelve Sanctuaries. The Twelve Sanctuaries were also the origin of the Greater God’s Domain.

If a power wished to develop into an apex power in God’s Domain, the easiest, yet also the most difficult, way to do so would be to seize one of the Twelve Sanctuaries. In the Greater God’s Domain’s long history, although three powers had only ever reached the apex by monopolizing one of the Twelve Sanctuaries, these three were also the strongest apex powers in the Greater God’s Domain.

Yet, now, Shi Feng was being told that the ruler of the Ancient Dragon Sanctuary during his previous life was being sealed in the Miniature Ancient World. This was simply unbelievable.

Before Shi Feng could recover from his surprise, Meteor suddenly shouted:

“Everyone, prepare for battle!”

As soon as Meteor finished speaking, the Demon Monarch Firenze could be seen lifting the scepter in his hand and creating several hundred summoning arrays in the sky. Then, Level 130, Tier 4 Great Demons began emerging from these summoning arrays one after another, their numbers quickly reaching the four digits.

After completing his summoning, Firenze sneered at Shi Feng and the others as he commanded, “Go forth, my servants! Devour the souls of these heaven’s blessed!”

Immediately, the army of Great Demons swooped down from the sky, leaving Shi Feng and the others no time to prepare at all.

“Tier 4s open a path! Everyone else, focus on support and defense!”

Meteor did not panic even when facing the army of Great Demons. Instead, he calmly gave out commands to his team.

An army of over a thousand Level 130 Great Demons might be terrifying opponents to face for a Tier 3 team, but their team had ten Tier 4 players. They were more than strong enough to cope against the Great Demons. The only problem they needed to worry about was their Stamina consumption.

“It seems there’s no hope for Zero Wing this time…” Star Snail said, sighing in disappointment when she saw the army of Great Demons swooping down from the sky.

As for Death Omen, she simply let out a cold laugh in her heart.

Even several Tier 4 experts working together would have a hard time going up against so many Tier 4 Great Demons simultaneously, let alone Zero Wing’s team, which only had one Tier 4 player.

“Hexagram Protection!”

Accompanied by a calm voice, four powerful mana fluctuations suddenly spread across the battlefield, covering a 500-yard radius. These powerful mana fluctuations drastically improved the mana of the 22 Tier 3 players in Shi Feng’s team. Now, when it came to mana, Su Qianliu and the others were no different from Tier 4 players. Including Shi Feng, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Shi Feng’s team was now composed of 23 Tier 4 players!

…

TL Notes:

I guess the author hasn’t completely forgotten about Hexagram Protection’s parameters?

Again, for reference:

Hexagram Protection: Erects a magic array that greatly strengthens the Mana of up to six people within a 1,000-yard radius. Enhancement works up to the Tier 4 standard. Magic array costs 1,000 Magic Crystals per minute to maintain.
