Chapter 284 – Land of Ancient Dragons

The sun was shining brightly on an island enveloped by a magic array.

Shi Feng stood up next to a creek, a sigh of relief coming out of his mouth when he saw his surroundings. Although the mana around him was incredibly chaotic and the gravity he experienced was several times greater than the outside world, he wasn’t completely out of luck as he wasn’t transported to the core area of the newly appeared God Mode Regional Dungeon.

Different from Shi Feng, Colorful Lunarite’s complexion paled when she recovered from her daze and looked at her surroundings.

How is this possible?

Colorful Lunarite’s expression quickly turned solemn as she looked at the 30-meter-tall Death Dragons that roamed the area around her.

…

[Death Dragon] (Spirit Devourer, Mythic)

Level 132

HP 60,000,000,000

…

Spirit Devourers might not be an apex race like Dragons, but they were regarded as a Class 1 dangerous race in God’s Domain. Spirit Devourers did not have a fixed form. Their strength depended entirely on the creatures they’ve devoured.

Spirit Devourers were also the enemy of all races in God’s Domain. So long as Spirit Devourers were discovered, every other race in God’s Domain would try to eradicate them at all costs. Even players were no exception.

This situation was because of the Spirit Devourers’ nature. Spirit Devourers could not only devour all life, but they could even devour the souls of players to grow and evolve. Meanwhile, the more souls they devoured, the greater their numbers would become.

In the history of the Greater World, many ancient kingdoms, ancient empires, and even apex races had suffered annihilation at the hands of Spirit Devourers. At one point, Spirit Devourers as a race had become so powerful that they had devoured all life and civilizations on numerous God’s Domains...

Back then, if it weren’t for the Greater God’s Domain’s apex powers joining hands and sacrificing over half of their forces to combat the fully-grown Spirit Devourers, the situation in the Greater God’s Domain of today would definitely be different.

As for the Spirit Devourers here, it went without saying that they had devoured Dragons. Hence, they had transformed into Death Dragons.

Although the Spirit Devourers here hadn’t grown to maturity yet, their population had already reached a frightening number. If all of these Spirit Devourers managed to evolve into their matured state, the Miniature Ancient World and the surrounding God’s Domains would most likely transform into lands of death.

Aside from Colorful Lunarite, Su Qianliu and the others, who were also teleported to this place, were similarly shocked by the scene in front of them. Although they didn’t know what a Spirit Devourer was, the Death Dragons’ 60 billion HP was more than enough to instill despair into them. Not to mention, there were well over a hundred such Death Dragons roaming the area. There was no way current players of the Miniature Ancient World could survive in such a place.

“Is this what a God Mode Regional Dungeon is like?” When Su Qianliu looked at the Death Dragons around her, she finally understood why even Tier 6 God-ranked experts could potentially die inside the God Mode Regional Dungeons on the main continent.

The Land of Ancient Dragons? After looking at the name of the land displayed on the system map, Shi Feng said in the team chat, “We are moving locations. This isn’t a place to rest.”

Normally, players should only consider entering a God Mode Regional Dungeon after reaching Tier 5. It was especially so when said dungeon housed a dangerous species such as Spirit Devourers. Although the Death Dragons here weren’t actual Tier 4 Dragons, they were still invincible among Tier 4 opponents. A minimum of several tens of thousands of Tier 4 players would be required to fight against so many Death Dragons…

Everyone nodded without hesitation. Then, they quietly followed Shi Feng to the outer zone of the island. Fortunately, the Death Dragons weren’t positioned close to each other. So long as they timed their advances right, they could pass these Death Dragons unnoticed.

However, such a measured approach cost them a lot of time. Just getting to the Land of Ancient Dragons’ outer zone took them a day.

Meanwhile, during this past day, Shi Feng and the others learned how wealthy the Land of Dragons was.

.

The incomparably precious Seven Luminaries Crystals could be seen covering the island’s surface. The island’s wealth exceeded the wealth of a Grade 1 ore vein by leaps and bounds.

Although Seven Luminaries Crystals could be found in Grade 1 ore veins, they were only present underground in very small quantities. Even for Shi Feng, this was the first time he had seen Seven Luminaries Crystals growing on the surface. After making a rough estimate, he concluded that the Land of Ancient Dragons’ ore vein could yield at least 3,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal per day.

It should be known that all of the ore veins combined in an average Elementary God’s Domain only produced around 6,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal per day. Yet, the Land of Ancient Dragons’ vein could produce half of that amount daily. This was simply unheard of.

If the Miniature Ancient World’s various foreign powers were to learn about this, they would definitely send even more experts into the Miniature Ancient World.

Even those upper-ranking hegemonic powers will lose their calm if they learn about such wealth… Colorful Lunarite inwardly sighed as she recalled all the Seven Luminaries Crystals she had come across thus far.

Currently, the various hegemonic powers in the Miniature Ancient World were only playing around. None of them had seriously committed their strength to the Miniature Ancient World. However, it would be an entirely different story if half of an Elementary God’s Domain’s Seven Luminaries Crystal production capacity was involved. Even upper-ranking hegemonic powers would be tempted into action.

Seven Luminaries Crystals were the capital for God’s Domain’s powers to develop in the Greater World.

Unfortunately, it was incredibly difficult to monopolize an entire God’s Domain’s resources. Even an Elementary God’s Domain wasn’t something an upper-ranking hegemonic power could occupy and monopolize.

However, in the case of the Miniature Ancient World, a world that anyone could enter, occupying it would be a piece of cake.

While Colorful Lunarite was worrying about upper-ranking hegemonic powers entering the Miniature Ancient World in full force, the sound of an explosion suddenly came from a distance. Subsequently, the area 1,000 yards around the epicenter of the explosion sank by several dozen meters. Then, a majestic temple rose from the middle of this sunken ground.

When Shi Feng and the others turned to look at this temple, they saw several dozen figures charging toward this 1,000-meter-tall temple. The speed of these figures was beyond the speed of the average Tier 3 expert, so it was obvious that they weren’t ordinary players. These figures also looked relatively young. Among them, ten were even Tier 4 players. Even Crying Sea City’s Divine Hunters Guild and Morning Light Guild combined couldn’t come up with such a force.

Are they the ones who triggered the event? Shi Feng wondered.

No God Mode Regional Dungeon would appear without a cause. Typically, these causes were major events triggered by players.

Moreover, to Shi Feng’s surprise, he found a familiar face when he looked at the figures approaching the temple’s entrance—the Flower of Seven Sins’ Death Omen. At this time, Death Omen had not only reached Tier 4, but her combat standard had also improved significantly.

“Why are the Paimon Conglomerate’s people here?” Colorful Lunarite exclaimed when she looked at the several dozen people standing before the temple’s entrance.

“They’re from the Paimon Conglomerate?”

Upon hearing Colorful Lunarite’s words, Su Qianliu immediately began scrutinizing the youths in the distance.

The Paimon Conglomerate!

So long as one bothered to learn from the various foreign God’s Domains’ players, one would know just how high of a position the Greater World’s corporations held in both the Greater World and the Greater God’s Domain. It was even more so for corporations that managed to get recognized as conglomerates.

The influence and strength a conglomerate wielded was not something ordinary hegemonic powers could even begin to fathom. Conglomerates were so powerful that the Miniature Ancient World’s various hegemonic powers had deemed it necessary to treat the Flower of Seven Sins respectfully simply because Thousand Scars had joined the Paimon Conglomerate.

At the same time as Shi Feng’s group had noticed the Paimon Conglomerate’s youths, the Paimon Conglomerate’s youths also noticed Shi Feng’s group.

“How is he here?” When Death Omen saw the cloaked and inconspicuous Swordsman standing in the distance, an intense fighting spirit appeared in her eyes.

“He? Who’s he?” The crimson-haired young man carrying a broken sword and standing in the lead of the Paimon Conglomerate’s team asked as he looked at Death Omen in confusion.

Death Omen was nothing special among their team in terms of individual strength. If not for her connection with Thousand Scars, she wouldn’t have even qualified for the mission this time. However, from his interactions with Death Omen, he knew that Death Omen was an incredibly prideful. So, he found it surprising that Death Omen would show such a reaction to someone.

“He is Zero Wing’s Black Flame!” Death Omen answered.

Upon hearing this, the crimson-haired youth couldn’t help but turn to look at Shi Feng. “Black Flame? The God List’s Asura Sword Emperor?”
