Chapter 29 – Primordial Object

“What’s going on?”

“Why did we suddenly get teleported out of the Dungeon?”

“Quick, look! The Dungeon’s entrance is sealed!”

The players who had been inexplicably teleported out of the Withered Ruins were agitated by the situation before them, their hearts filled with questions.

“A Regional Dungeon’s entrance suddenly got sealed? Did someone trigger a major event inside?”

“That’s most likely the case. This is a Hell Mode Regional Dungeon we are talking about, after all. Unless a major event occurs, there’s no way it would get sealed all of a sudden. Moreover, this seal is actually composed of a fourfold magic array. Anyone capable of constructing such a seal should be a Tier 5 NPC at the very least.”

“An opportunity! This is definitely a big opportunity! Quick! Notify the higher-ups and have them send over some experts proficient in magic arrays! There must be a big secret inside the Dungeon! Our Guild must be the first to decode this fourfold magic array!”

After a brief moment of agitation and confusion, the leaders of the various teams present promptly reported this abrupt development back to their respective powers’ executives, their eyes filled with joy and madness.

Even on the main continent, there had never been a case where an entire Hell Mode Regional Dungeon had been sealed, and the players within it teleported out. The only explanation for this unprecedented situation was that an unknown event had taken place inside the Dungeon.

Meanwhile, an event that involved a Tier 5 NPC was something even Super Guilds would take seriously. After all, such events would typically benefit players in getting promoted to Tier 5. Depending on the Tier 5 NPC involved, the event might even be helpful in reaching Tier 6.

It should be known that even the addition of one Tier 5 expert could influence the power structure of a huge region, let alone a Tier 6 God-ranked expert. Should a new Tier 6 God-ranked expert appear, it would change God’s Domain’s power structure in its entirety.

However, unlike the other teams going crazy over this unexpected development, Soulfire’s team, which was similarly teleported out of the Dungeon, remained strangely calm. The several party leaders of Soulfire’s team weren’t even paying attention to the seal on the Dungeon like everyone else. Instead, they looked toward their captain, Southern Tiger. Then, they looked toward Shi Feng, who stood a short distance away, their eyes filled with greed and excitement.

“Should we take them down, Captain?” a robust youth carrying a greatsword on his back asked Southern Tiger in a whisper.

Upon hearing this youth’s words, the other party leaders also looked toward Southern Tiger, their eyes tinted with bloodlust and madness.

The outsiders present might not be aware of the situation, but they knew what had exactly happened inside the Withered Ruins. Meanwhile, a Tier 6 God’s advent was a massive event that had only happened a handful of times in God’s Domain. The previous instances of these events happening had even sparked wars between several dozen Guilds. Moreover, even the weakest among these participating Guilds was a top-ranking first-rate Guild. An adventurer team like Soulfire didn’t even have the qualifications to participate in those wars.

Yet, now, such an opportunity had presented itself before them. Moreover, they were the only ones who knew about the event. Most importantly, the treasure chest they had acquired through this event was currently in the hands of the team leader, that is, Shi Feng.

A treasure chest bestowed by a Tier 6 God!

Although the treasure chest was currently in Shi Feng’s possession, so long as they killed Shi Feng within two hours, the treasure chest would drop with 100% certainty. They could take the treasure chest for their own.

However, when Southern Tiger heard his subordinate’s suggestion, he only hesitated for a moment before determinedly saying, “No! We cannot do such a thing!”

“Why?”

“That’s right, Captain! Why not? That’s a treasure chest bestowed by a Tier 6 God! We might be able to get an extra Tier 5 powerhouse if we have it! Even producing a Tier 6 God-ranked expert isn’t out of the question! We might not get another opportunity like this if we miss out on it now!”

When the many party leaders present saw Southern Tiger’s determined attitude, they couldn’t help but start questioning him.

While they recognized that Shi Feng was a powerful expert worthy of Soulfire to befriend, the current situation involved Soulfire’s future. If Soulfire could produce an extra Tier 5 expert through this opportunity, it wouldn’t matter even if they lost Shi Feng’s friendship!

However, when Southern Tiger saw his party leaders’ manic expressions, he took a deep breath and solemnly said, “You don’t need to know the reason. All you need to know is that he is worth it!”

“He’s worth it?”

Southern Tiger’s words stumped everyone. They failed to understand why Southern Tiger placed such high hopes on Shi Feng, so much so that he was willing to sacrifice Soulfire’s opportunity to further develop itself.

Seeing everyone’s confusion, Southern Tiger merely responded with a bitter smile.

A Tier 6 God-ranked expert was not an existence Soulfire could afford to offend. Moreover, this was even a Tier 6 God-ranked expert that nobody had ever heard about. There must be a lot of issues involved in this matter. Meanwhile, Soulfire definitely couldn’t afford to get involved in these issues. Thus, it was best that only a few people learned about Shi Feng’s identity.

This was also why he had tasked Moon Rain with logging off and contacting the head captain. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If this matter wasn’t handled properly, it wouldn’t even be strange for Soulfire to disappear from God’s Domain. This wouldn’t be the first time such a thing had happened in God’s Domain, either.

Meanwhile, what he needed to do now was to wait for the head captain’s feedback. After all, matters concerning an unknown Tier 6 God-ranked expert were already outside his authority as a captain to decide upon.

At the same time as Southern Tiger made his decision to maintain friendly relations with Shi Feng, Shi Feng’s students couldn’t help but grow anxious and fearful. It was especially true when they saw the bloodlust in the eyes of Soulfire’s members.

“Instructor Shi, we should hurry up and leave. I keep getting the feeling that these people are looking at us strangely,” Xiao Yuheng, who had a straightforward personality, suggested to Shi Feng when she saw Soulfire’s party leaders discussing something with Southern Tiger.

Qin Wuchen and the others also nodded their heads in agreement. Anyone who said that they weren’t tempted by a Tier 6 God’s treasure chest would definitely be lying.

Just when Qin Wuchen and the others thought to further persuade Shi Feng into fleeing, Southern Tiger also started making his way over. Seeing this, Qin Wuchen and the other students immediately grew nervous.

However, contrary to everyone’s expectations, Southern Tiger did not come to demand the treasure chest from Shi Feng. Instead, he approached Shi Feng with a friendly smile and retrieved a golden token from his bag. Then, he sincerely said, “Now that we have fulfilled our agreement, we will be taking our leave, Brother Black Flame. This is Soulfire’s Gold Order. If you meet with any troubles in the future, feel free to seek our help using this Gold Order. Soulfire will accept any request you make.”

“Soulfire’s Gold Order?! How can this be?!”

When Wu Lingling, who similarly remained on high alert against Southern Tiger, saw the golden token Southern Tiger took out, astonishment immediately colored her face.

Meanwhile, when Qin Wuchen and the others overheard Wu Lingling’s quiet exclamation, they asked Wu Lingling in a whisper, “What are you so surprised about, Class Rep? What’s this Gold Order? Is it something incredible?”

“Incredible?” Wu Lingling couldn’t help but roll her eyes when she heard her classmates’ questions. “There are three kinds of orders in Soulfire: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. If you have these orders, you can ask Soulfire to help you out with one matter for free. Depending on the order’s rank, the things you can ask for help on will be limited. Meanwhile, the Gold Order is the highest-ranked order, and it is also known as the Order of No Regrets. With a Gold Order, you can ask Soulfire to help you with anything, and Soulfire will get it done or die trying. However, each captain in Soulfire will only ever receive one Gold Order, which means they can only ever give it to one person. So, how incredible do you think the Gold Order is?”

Wu Lingling had only managed to hear about Soulfire’s Gold Order because her elder sister had mentioned it to her in passing. At the time, Soulfire had ended up offending a superpower because of a Gold Order, nearly facing destruction as a result. The matter had only settled after an expert from Midnight Tea Party had stepped forward to resolve the issue.

It was also after this Gold Order incident that Soulfire had gradually become famous in God’s Domain.

Originally, Wu Lingling had only thought it was a story and nothing more. Never did she think that the Gold Order existed.

Meanwhile, after Qin Wuchen and the others learned about Soulfire’s Gold Order, shock immediately filled their eyes when they looked at the gold token in Southern Tiger’s hand.

This was a token capable of influencing Soulfire’s continued existence. Yet, Southern Tiger was now giving it to their instructor. This was simply unbelievable.

However, contrary to everyone’s expectations, Shi Feng did not accept the golden token. Instead, he shook his head and calmly said, “It’s fine. I don’t need this thing.”

“This…” Southern Tiger couldn’t help but feel a little awkward when he heard Shi Feng’s answer.

As for Qin Wuchen and the others, they immediately gaped in shock. The Gold Order was capable of ordering Soulfire, an adventurer team that rivaled first-rate Guilds, to do anything. Yet, Shi Feng had refused it without hesitation…

“If you want to give it away, give it to my student here.” Noticing the awkwardness on Southern Tiger’s face, Shi Feng pointed at Wu Lingling and said, “She should be needing this token more than I do right now.”

“Me?” Wu Lingling was momentarily dumbfounded.

When Southern Tiger heard Shi Feng’s words, he did not hesitate for even a moment as he handed the Gold Order to Wu Lingling. He even very kindly said, “This token is yours now, young lady. If you need help with anything, feel free to find us at any time. So long as it is something Soulfire can help with, we will definitely get it done for you!”

After saying so, Southern Tiger promptly walked away and left the Withered Ruins with his team. He gave no time for Wu Lingling to react at all.

Having a hard time processing this situation, Wu Lingling looked toward Shi Feng and asked, “Instructor Shi? What should I do with this token?”

While the Gold Order’s benefits were immense, it was also a significant favor. It definitely wouldn’t be easy for her to return such a favor.

“Just take it. This is your reward for winning the championship in the freshman competition,” Shi Feng nonchalantly said. “If you need any Legacies or opportunities to enter Secret Lands to improve your combat standard, you can ask for their help using this token. With Soulfire’s strength, they should be able to accomplish these things.”

When Shi Feng finished speaking, Qin Wuchen and the others couldn’t help but look at Wu Lingling in shock and envy. None of them had thought that Shi Feng would use something as valuable as the Gold Order as a prize for winning the freshman competition.

It should be known that the Gold Order was akin to a free pass to obtaining Legacies for rare combat techniques and hidden classes. Even the various superpowers wouldn’t casually bestow such a benefit to their young talents. After all, acquiring these Legacies required significant manpower and resources. Moreover, such rare Legacies were typically limited in number. Thus, only talents deemed worthy could receive these Legacies for free.

Meanwhile, after Soulfire’s team left, Shi Feng also had his students log out and rest for the day. The long raid had taken a toll on everyone’s mind. Under such a state, they couldn’t fight as efficiently as they normally did. Rather than waste time grinding inefficiently, it’d be better if they got some rest.

After seeing all of his students logging off, Shi Feng took out a Return Scroll and teleported back to Hundred Flow City.

However, Shi Feng did not hurry in opening Tyrian’s treasure chest after returning to the city. Instead, he visited the biggest hotel available in the city and rented the most expensive VIP room, which cost 20 Gold per day. That was equivalent to two or three days’ worth of income for a frontline Tier 3 expert. Meanwhile, only after entering the room and activating the room’s defensive magic array did Shi Feng retrieve the treasure chest out of his bag.

The treasure chest was colored purple and gold. Previously, the seal placed on the treasure chest had prevented Shi Feng from seeing it clearly, but now that the seal was gone, he noticed black electric arcs appearing around the treasure chest from time to time. It looked as if even the surrounding space rejected the treasure chest’s existence.

Interesting! A flash of excitement appeared in Shi Feng’s eyes when he saw this phenomenon. I thought it was merely an ordinary Purple Magic Crystal Treasure Chest at first, but to think that it holds an outerworld object in it…

In God’s Domain, there were also special treasure chests apart from the standard treasure chests, such as the Purple Magic Crystal Treasure Chest. These special treasure chests weren’t part of the standard ranking system for treasure chests since they originated from a distant era. Their value could also vary significantly, with some being comparable to merely Bronze Treasure Chests and some surpassing even Inferior Legendary Treasure Chests.

However, any item that the world actively suppressed was undoubtedly priceless.

When Shi Feng opened the treasure chest, a black glow immediately escaped from the treasure chest. Not only did this black glow give off a chilling sensation, but it even caused the space in the room to crack and tremble.

This intense reaction naturally triggered the room’s defensive magic array. In the blink of an eye, a threefold defensive magic array appeared and stabilized the space inside the room. The cracks in space had also quickly mended and vanished. However, the chilling aura coming out of the treasure chest did not weaken at the slightest, making it difficult for anyone to approach it.

This situation continued for three seconds before an ink-black longsword and a gray key surrounded by a spatial tear slowly hovered out of the treasure chest. Meanwhile, upon sensing the ancient aura these two items exuded, even Shi Feng couldn’t help but gasp.

Primordial Objects?!
