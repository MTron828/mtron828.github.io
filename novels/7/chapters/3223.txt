Chapter 298 – One Construction to Beat a Country

“Black Flame? The God List’s fourth-ranked Asura Sword Emperor?” Saint Three’s lips curled into a sinister smile when he heard the Tier 5 Ranger’s report. “How interesting. I thought that useless Uncaring Arrogance was joking with me when he told me this name. I didn’t think it would be true.”

“He is merely a titled expert from a small world, Lord Saint Three. Setting aside the fact that he is inferior to the third-ranked Lord Saint Nine, so long as you give me the word, I will bring him to immediately,” the Tier 5 Ranger said confidently. In addition to being a titled expert, he also had an overwhelming advantage of twenty levels and one tier over the expert named Black Flame.

“Inferior to Saint Nine?” Saint Three laughed when he heard the Ranger’s words. “Do you know that Saint Nine lost to someone in that small world you speak of?”

“Someone defeated Lord Saint Nine? Could it be the God List’s first-ranked player?” the Tier 5 Ranger exclaimed.

The experts on the Miniature Ancient World’s God-ranked Expert List would rarely clash with each other. They were only given their ranks because of the strength they displayed.

Even so, if he were to name someone who could defeat Saint Nine, the only person he could think of would be the God List’s first-ranked player.

“No, it’s not that person,” Saint Three said, shaking his head. Then, he snickered and continued, “He got defeated by a peerless genius nurtured by the Paimon Conglomerate. From the reports, the other party is called Meteor. There is also a person named Star Snail who should be roughly as strong as Saint Nine.”

The Tier 5 Ranger was surprised by this news, and he couldn’t help but be awed by the Paimon Conglomerate’s strength.

It should be known that Saint Nine was a rare genius that the Twin Saints Alliance would only see once every several decades. If not for Saint Three, a genius that would appear only once every century, appearing out of the blue, Saint Nine would most likely be preparing to take over the Twin Saints Alliance already.

Yet, out of the internal geniuses the Paimon Conglomerate had dispatched to the Miniature Ancient World, there was actually one who could beat Saint Nine and another who could match Saint Nine.

“However, from a piece of insider news I got from the Paimon Conglomerate, Meteor has lost to Black Flame and a female Swordsman. Although the Seven Luminaries Alliance has yet to update its ranking list, the God List’s top three should see Black Flame and that mysterious female Swordsman in it,” Saint Three said with a fervent look. “So, do you understand what I want to do?”

“A public execution!” the Tier 5 Ranger answered almost instinctively.

“That’s right!” Saint Three said in delight. “I will publicly execute that Black Flame in the Ancient River Secret Land and let the various conglomerates’ internal geniuses know who is the real genius! As for those two women, so long as they leave Gazing Moon City, find an opportunity to kill them and retrieve my Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal.”

“Understood!” The Tier 5 Ranger bowed before leaving the room.

Nighttime, Gazing Moon Hotel:

The Gazing Moon Hotel was the most luxurious hotel in the heart of Gazing Moon City. Meanwhile, the hotel’s top-floor VIP room was also the most expensive hotel room in the city. It cost ten Gold Mana Coins just to stay in the room for one night, yet the average Tier 5 expert didn’t even earn five Gold Mana Coins per day.

“I had to bankrupt myself to rent this room for three days, Brother Black Flame…” Midsummer said as she placed her hand on her money pouch with an agonized look on her face.

She had never dared to dream about staying in one of the Gazing Moon Hotel’s top-floor VIP rooms before. Out of the many years she had spent in the Greater God’s Domain, never had she spent more than five Silver Mana Coins a night renting a hotel room. Yet, Shi Feng had not only helped her break this record, but he had even gotten her to rent this extravagant room for three whole days.

If they couldn’t earn any money during these three days, they would be so broke that they wouldn’t be able to afford any food or accommodation.

When Shi Feng, who had changed into a gray boilersuit, saw the anxious expressions on Midsummer’s and Wu Xiaoxiao’s faces, he chuckled and said, “Don’t look at me like that. I called you two here for something good.”

“Something good?” Midsummer looked at Shi Feng skeptically. “What is it?”

Chuckling, Shi Feng answered, “I’m taking you two to go mining!”

Upon hearing this, both Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao immediately rolled their eyes at Shi Feng.

They were staying in the most expensive hotel room in Gazing Moon City, yet Shi Feng was now telling them to do the least profitable job in the Greater God’s Domain. This was already beyond extravagance.

Gazing Moon City might be situated on top of a mountain range, but the ore veins surrounding it weren’t particularly valuable. They were mostly Copper and Iron veins. There wasn’t even a single Grade 3 ore vein nearby. Players would be fortunate if they could earn even a single Silver Mana Coin after toiling for an entire day. Because of this, only NPCs would be willing to work as a Miner in Gazing Moon City.

“You’ll understand once you see it for yourself,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head and chuckling when Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao glared at him.

After saying so, Shi Feng took out an ancient bronze key from his bag. The key radiated a nine-colored glow, and Shi Feng turned it in mid-air after taking it out. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Immediately, a space-time passage the size of a person appeared in the middle of the room. This was none other than the entrance to the miniature world formed by the Primal Ore Vein.

“A Primal Ore Vein!?”

Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao were dumbfounded when they saw the space-time passage.

They weren’t ignorant little girls.

So long as one spent some time researching in God’s Domain’s various libraries, one would find information on all sorts of ore veins.

Meanwhile, out of the various ore veins in God’s Domain, the best and safest one would have to be the Primal Ore Vein.

According to rumors, a Primal Ore Vein was a world of its own. Meanwhile, the amount of Seven Luminaries Crystals a Primal Ore Vein produced each day could rival half the daily production volume of an Elementary God’s Domain. So, gaining control over a Primal Ore Vein would be akin to gaining control over half an Elementary God’s Domain’s wealth.

So, it was only natural they would be surprised to learn that Shi Feng possessed a Primal Ore Vein.

“Don’t be so surprised. This Primal Ore Vein is damaged, so I’m not sure exactly how many Seven Luminaries Crystals it can produce,” Shi Feng said with a bitter smile when he saw the two girls’ sparkling eyes.

Currently, whether Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao could reach the Ancient River Secret Land’s depths depended entirely on the Primal Ore Vein before them.

There were 99 Hidden Constructions in the Starlight Realm, and the value of each of these Hidden Constructions surpassed even the total value of an entire country in the Greater God’s Domain. Because of this, the existence of Hidden Constructions was widely known in the Greater God’s Domain.

Only 40 out of the Starlight Realm’s 99 Hidden Constructions were found during Shi Feng’s previous life. Out of these 40 Hidden Constructions found, one of them was situated in Gazing Moon City. Meanwhile, its name was the Hundred Refinement Building!

However, even though Zero Wing’s base of development was in Gazing Moon City during Shi Feng’s previous life, Zero Wing wasn’t the one that obtained the Hundred Refinement Building. Instead, it was found by the Midnight Tea Party, an adventure team that eventually became known throughout the entire Greater God’s Domain!

Meanwhile, as its name suggested, the Hundred Refinement Building allowed players to conduct 100 assisted training simulations. Of the 99 Hidden Constructions in the Starlight Realm, the Hundred Refinement Building ranked 39th.

As for the simulations the Hundred Refinement Building offered to players, they weren’t ordinary combat simulations. Instead, the establishment helped players simulate the perfect state of their Mana Bodies 100 times. It was akin to players receiving heavenly assistance in the development of their Mana Bodies.

However, players could only enter the Hundred Refinement Building once in their lifetime. Even if they deleted their accounts and created new ones, they couldn’t enter the establishment for a second time.

Meanwhile, the cost of purchasing the Hundred Refinement Building was 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. Moreover, the player seeking to purchase the Hidden Construction needed to have an Epic Mana Body at a 90% Completion Rate or above.

Currently, Shi Feng had already met the Mana Body criteria. All he was missing were 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.

If he were to mine for Seven Luminaries Crystals by himself, he definitely couldn’t harvest enough to purchase the Hundred Refinement Building before the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition started in six days. However, as he didn’t dare to casually reveal the Primal Ore Vein’s existence to just anyone, he had no choice but to get Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao to help him. As for whether the Primal Ore Vein could generate 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal in six days, that was entirely dependent on luck.

“Let’s head inside if you’re ready.”

When Shi Feng saw that Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao had already changed into boilersuits, he stepped into the space-time passage.
