Chapter 95 – Abyssal Star Ancient City

…

TL Notes:

Town Rune Crystal -> Settlement Rune Crystal

…

“Half?” Hidden Soul was a little surprised.

“I indeed plan to set up a settlement here, but other than a settlement, I also plan on establishing an outer mercenary organization for Zero Wing,” Shi Feng said. “Meanwhile, I plan on putting you in charge of this mercenary organization.”

There were all sorts of player forces in God’s Domain. Other than the mainstream forces like Guilds, adventurer teams, trading firms, and assassin organizations, there were also other forces such as mercenary organizations. In the case of mercenary organizations, they catered to independent experts that disliked being bound by restrictions, offering them tasks in exchange for Credits or resources in God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, there were many uses for a Guild to establish a mercenary organization. Among them, the biggest use was to recruit a large number of independent experts for the Guild’s use.

Currently, although Zero Wing already possessed a good foundation, it was still too weak compared to the various long-standing powers in God’s Domain. It simply lacked the strength to protect its interests in God’s Domain.

The best example would be the Ancient Demon Court. Had it not been for Shi Feng’s strength acting as a deterrence and the Ancient Demon Court’s unique characteristics, Zero Wing couldn’t have retained ownership over it at all.

Meanwhile, with Zero Wing’s current members, there was no way it would have enough strength to defend a Guild City. It was especially true if the various superpowers set their sights on it. Shi Feng still didn’t possess the strength to go up against multiple superpowers simultaneously.

Hence, the best solution was for Zero Wing to establish a mercenary organization based in Zero Wing’s settlement and quickly recruit the help of a large number of independent experts to assist the Guild. By doing so, Zero Wing could ensure its settlement’s security while acquiring a large amount of Coins and resources.

Meanwhile, who better to lead such an organization than Hidden Soul? As a former commander in the Flower of Seven Sins, she was undoubtedly acquainted with many peak and apex independent experts. She would have no trouble attracting these independent experts to work for Zero Wing.

“I refuse.” Hidden Soul shook her head, flatly refusing Shi Feng’s offer. “My goal is only that Holy Annihilation Mana Technique. I am not interested in anything else.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Hidden Soul naturally understood Shi Feng’s intentions. He was most likely trying to use her as a cover against the various superpowers while he manipulated the situation in the dark. She’d be a fool if she agreed to his request.

“Don’t be so quick to refuse,” Shi Feng said, smiling. “I know this job comes with a lot of risks, but with high risks comes high rewards. If you can take on this job and safeguard Zero Wing’s settlement, I can give you a copy of the Mana Technique for free. Moreover, don’t you want to see what kind of settlement I’ll be establishing?”

Hidden Soul was a little tempted when she heard Shi Feng’s offer. However, she quickly shook her head after thinking it over. She’d be insane to go against the various superpowers for nothing more than a settlement.

However, before Hidden Soul could open her mouth to voice her refusal, Shi Feng took out the Settlement Rune Crystal from his bag and recited the incantation engraved on it.

Meanwhile, as soon as Shi Feng started reciting the incantation, an intense pillar of light suddenly emerged from the ground around Shi Feng and shot straight up into the sky.

“This Mana… How is this possible?!”

Hidden Soul was dumbfounded when she saw the light pillar that enveloped Shi Feng. This was because she could sense that the thing before her wasn’t a light pillar at all. Instead, it was a pillar of Mana so pure and intense that it was already comparable to the Mana of Tier 6 Gods.

Meanwhile, after this pillar of Mana extended a thousand meters into the air, it began spreading apart to form a magic array that covered nearly half of the entire Misty Canyon. Then, once this gigantic magic array had finished forming, an ancient and majestic settlement gradually emerged from it and descended on the forest Shi Feng designated.

When the settlement had flattened the forest and settled on the ground, Shi Feng promptly received a series of system notifications.

…

System: Congratulations! You have successfully summoned the Abyssal Star Ancient City, one of the Nine Ancient Legacy Cities of the Second Sequence, and became the ancient city’s governor.

System: The Abyssal Star Ancient City will receive full protection for ten natural days. Please construct the city’s defenses during the protection period.

System: The Abyssal Star Ancient City will be fully opened after ten natural days. All cities in the surrounding region will be notified at that time.

…

Is this the true foundation of an Ancient Demon Court found in the Miniature Ancient World? Shi Feng couldn’t help but feel complicated when he read the system notifications. He didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry about this situation.

One of the Nine Ancient Legacy Cities of the Second Sequence… I won’t be able to maintain a low profile even if I want to now…

The Ancient Demon Courts were the Civilization Legacies left behind by the Ancient Demon Gods. Among the Legacies found in Ancient Demon Courts, the best Legacies would undoubtedly be the settlements the Ancient Demon Gods constructed.

Meanwhile, these ancient settlements could be categorized into three groups: the Three Holy Cities of the First Sequence, the Nine Ancient Legacy Cities of the Second Sequence, and the One Hundred Towns of the Third Sequence.

Although there was a significant disparity between the three groups, even the towns in the Third Sequence were incredibly powerful. Given enough time, a small Guild could easily grow into a superpower with the help of a Third Sequence Town. This was also why Shi Feng was confident he could persuade Hidden Soul to help him.

These Legacy Settlements functioned specifically to nurture players. Meanwhile, even Tier 6 God-ranked experts could receive some harvest from a Third Sequence Town, let alone players who hadn’t reached Tier 6.

However, Shi Feng never imagined that the Settlement Rune Crystal he acquired would yield such an amazing result. He couldn’t believe he had summoned the Abyssal Star Ancient City, one of the Nine Ancient Legacy Cities, just by spending 200,000 Magic Crystals…

It should be known that during his previous life, even with the almighty Zero Wing supporting him, he had relied heavily on luck to summon an ancient city. Meanwhile, thanks to this ancient city, Zero Wing was able to solidify its foundation and establish a foothold in the Greater God’s Domain.

In contrast, the current Zero Wing had already gained an ancient city despite being a newly-established Guild. If the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers were to learn of this, they would probably mobilize the entirety of their respective worlds’ power to steal this city…

Compared to Shi Feng, Hidden Soul had a much greater reaction when she saw the majestic city that had replaced the forest before her. With her eyes filled with shock and confusion, she yelled, “An ancient city?!”

Originally, she thought that Shi Feng was merely building a new town. She never expected Shi Feng to summon a city, much less an ancient city.

As a former commander of the Flower of Seven Sins, Hidden Soul was no stranger to ancient cities. This was because the Flower of Seven Sins also owned several ancient cities. Meanwhile, every ancient city was a treasure trove left behind by an ancient civilization, and it could provide immense help to both individuals and organizations.

“It’d be more appropriate to call this a primordial city than an ancient city,” Shi Feng said as he looked at Hidden Soul’s dazed expression. Then, he smiled and said, “Let’s go in and take a look.”

After saying so, Shi Feng began walking toward the Abyssal Star Ancient City. Meanwhile, Hidden Soul didn’t hesitate for long before she followed after him.

TL Notes:

I mentioned it in a previous chapter, but I will be using “settlement” as a general term for towns and cities. When I use “settlement,” I could be referring to towns, cities, or both.
