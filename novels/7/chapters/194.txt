Chapter 195 - One Against One Hundred

“You, lure some more monsters over. With such a good leveling spot, I want to charge to number one on the Ranking List and teach the other Guilds in the Alliance the strength of Martial Union,” Unstable Devastation spoke in the team chat.

“Yes,” the several Assassins replied.

Right now, Fire Dance still occupied the first place on the Ranking List. However, the second place had already changed.

However, it wasn’t because Fire Dance and the other’s leveling speed was slower than the other players. They were simply busy doing quests. These quests were all Rare Reputation Quests, and they could obtain relatively large amounts of White River City Reputation by completing them.

In God’s Domain, if players wished to have an official class when they reached Level 20, they could only apply at the Class Association in the various large cities. However, players required a certain amount of reputation before doing so. Hence, the first task Shi Feng wanted Blackie and the others to accomplish after they entered White River City was to do these Rare Quests and quickly raise their reputation. By the time they reached Level 20, they would be able to change into their basic classes immediately.

If they discovered this fact only after they reached Level 20, they would have to waste a lot of time earning sufficient reputation, which, in turn, would delay their progress.

Just as Unstable Devastation excitedly hunted Three-tailed Scorpions, Shi Feng had also arrived at Martial Union’s healers’ position using the Ring of Nothingness.

Nobody would ever think that a single independent player would take the initiative to seek vengeance upon a Guild’s elite team. After all, this was simply an overestimation of one’s own abilities.

However, Shi Feng dared to do just that because of his sufficient strength.

Unstable Devastation was Level 10, and the others present were all Level 9. There was a 5 level gap between them and Shi Feng. Moreover, equipment that could ignore an opponent’s levels were extremely rare at this stage of the game. These conditions allowed Shi Feng to easily sweep the floor with this group of Level 9 players.

Just as the healers of Martial Union were about to replenish the HP of the frontline players, Shi Feng suddenly appeared before them. Shi Feng cast Thundering Flash, the skill instantly devouring the group of panicked healers. Frightening damages of over -500 appeared on every healer’s head, and some even received critical hits of over -1,000 damage. In the blink of an eye, a majority of the healers died.

However, due to the healers standing relatively spread apart, there were three who managed to remain unscathed after Shi Feng’s attack.

Shi Feng immediately used Wind Blade and charged over. He used Chop on one of the shocked healers, killing them instantly. Shi Feng then continued to brandish his sword at the two remaining healers, reaping their lives with a few sword strokes.

“Ye Feng!” Unstable Devastation bellowed, countless veins surfacing on his forehead.

“Unstable Devastation, haven’t you been trying to find me all this time?” Shi Feng faintly smiled as he looked at Unstable Devastation. Regarding the hundred-plus players standing around Unstable Devastation, glaring at him, Shi Feng paid no attention to them at all. “Now that I’ve arrived, I wonder if you’ve prepared to die yet?”

“Kill me? I’m afraid that you’re the one who won’t leave this place alive! I lost to you the previous time because you had a higher level. This time, however, I am Level 10 as well! Do you think that I’m still afraid of you? Everyone, get him! Kill him!” Unstable Devastation smiled disdainfully, immediately commanding all of his subordinates to get rid of Shi Feng. Unstable Devastation did not believe that Shi Feng could leave alive when faced with his team of over a hundred elite players, not to mention, manage to kill him.

The players from Martial Union revealed sneers as they looked at Shi Feng; they all thought that there was a problem with Shi Feng’s head. However, they didn’t mind teaching Shi Feng a lesson.

One against one hundred?

Did he really think he was Superman?

In the past, the players from Martial Union that surrounded Shi Feng were mostly normal members. There were only a few elite members of the Guild present at the time; hence, Shi Feng caused such a massacre. This time, however, they were all Martial Union’s elites, and they were all Level 9 players. Ye Feng would only meet one end today – Death!

Suddenly, tens of spells launched at Shi Feng.

The other remaining tens of Shield Warriors, Guardian Knights, Berserkers, and Swordsmen charged towards Shi Feng. Meanwhile, the Assassins entered Stealth, waiting for their chance to strike.

Faced with the attacks of dozens of mages, Shi Feng dared not be careless. He immediately activated Windwalk and the Tier 2 Life Shield before proceeding to charge at the incoming wave of players.

As Shi Feng’s speed was extremely fast; very few of the tens of spells hit Shi Feng. In the end, only three or four spells actually managed to deal damage to Shi Feng. Unfortunately, these spells were all fire-type and ice-type spells such as Fireball and Frost Arrows. With Shi Feng’s resistances, these spells managed to cause less than -10 damage each. In addition to the Life Shield absorbing a portion of the damage, the actual damage these spells caused was less than -6 points.

All of the mages were shocked.

“Even if it is a tiny amount of damage, beat him with all you’ve got! There has to be a limit to his HP! Without any healers, he won’t last long! Melee classes, spread out and be careful of his AOE skills!” Unstable Devastation was similarly shocked. However, after giving it some thought, even if Shi Feng had an insanely high Defense, he still wasn’t a Boss. There was bound to be a limit to his HP. Even if they only dealt damage in the single digits, with tens of them continuously attacking, how long could Shi Feng last?

Watching his HP fall continuously, Shi Feng clearly understood that he could not hold on for much longer. The difference in Attributes was simply not enough to overcome the strength of over a hundred elite players.

“Almost...” When the distance between Shi Feng and the crowd from Martial Union shrunk to less than 20 yards, Shi Feng took out an Intermediate Frost Grenade, tossing it at them.

Martial Union noticed Shi Feng throwing an item. However, since it was not a skill, they did not pay it any heed.

Instantly, the Intermediate Frost Grenade exploded, releasing a shroud of cold air, covering a 12-yard radius. The cold air froze the players for 3 seconds and dealt -400 damage to every one of them.

The shroud of cold air swallowed more than half of the melee players.

“MTs, activate your lifesaving skills! Mages, increase your firepower and controlling skills! We must not let him get near the frozen players!” Unstable Devastation hurriedly shouted.

The Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights immediately activated their Shield Walls and Protection Blessings respectively after receiving the command. However, deep in their hearts, they were extremely clear that these skills were absolutely useless in front of Shi Feng. They merely used these skills in the hopes that, with their increased durability, Shi Feng would instead choose to go for the other players first.

Meanwhile, the mages standing at the rear line started casting controlling spells, one after another. They used spells such as Ice Walls and Ice Spheres to prevent Shi Feng from closing in on the frozen players.

Shi Feng simply smiled. Using Silent Steps, he instantly arrived behind these mages. With the Ice-Blue Devil Flame covering his entire body, he sent Thunder Flame Explosion blasting down on these mages. The Elementalists and Cursemancers who were within the range of Thunder Flame Explosion were instantly wiped out of existence. Moreover, those who received critical hits of over -2,000 damage also had their equipment destroyed.

A few Elementalists with quick reactions had immediately activated Frozen Circle, coupled with a Blink. They intended to slow Shi Feng down as they fled for their lives.

Unfortunately, Shi Feng reacted even faster than they did. He activated Defensive Blade and Dark Violent Dance. Gaining immunity to the Frozen Circles, Shi Feng waved the flaming Abyssal Blade in his hand. A streak of deep-blue flaming sword aura landed on one of the escaping Elementalists 10 yards away, dealing over -1,000 damage and instantly killing him. Simultaneously, the two Summoners in front of him also received damage from the attack, instantly losing over 400 HP.

Shi Feng then continued with a barrage of attacks. As a result, deep-blue flames annihilated the mages within a 15-yard radius.

“Kill him! Don’t be afraid; we have more men on our side! He only has half of his HP remaining!” Although Shi Feng only had half of his HP remaining right now, Unstable Devastation had lost much of his confidence. Even so, he did not stop sending out streak after streak of Frost Arrows and Fatal Shots. However, Shi Feng had dodged every one of them. In addition to the sudden appearance of Shi Feng’s flame transformation and terrifying AOE damage, Unstable Devastation already had the notion of escaping for his life. However, he needed to observe the situation further before he made his decision.

“Half HP, is it?” Shi Feng calmly smiled. He then proceeded to take out his next trump card from his bag.

[Intermediate Recovery Potion] Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Instantly recovers 800 HP after use.

Cooldown: 1 minute

In White River City, players were only allowed to purchase five Intermediate Recovery Potions each day, and each bottle cost 3 Silver Coins. It was an item meant for a crucial time.

Shi Feng downed the bottle, his HP instantly recovering to full. At this sight, Martial Union’s players were instantly afraid.

They had sacrificed dozens of players to take away close to half of Shi Feng’s HP. Yet, Shi Feng’s HP was full once again. Moreover, the scorching flame that surrounded his body greatly increased his battle prowess. Just by closing in on him, the durability of their equipment constantly fell. Faced with such a situation, their confidence instantly sunk into a bottomless pit.
