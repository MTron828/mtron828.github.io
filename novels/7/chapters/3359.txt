Chapter 434 – New Realm Emerges

Darkness, depression, and powerlessness…

A wave of discomfort rampantly eroded Shi Feng’s mind as soon as he logged into God’s Domain.

This feeling…

The sudden discomfort felt familiar to Shi Feng. However, this sense of familiarity came from deep within his mind, and he couldn’t remember where he had experienced this discomfort before.

When Shi Feng opened his eyes, he was immediately stunned by the scene before him.

Shi Feng remembered logging out of the game inside a hotel room in the Saint Camp. Yet, now, not only did he appear outside the hotel, but all of the buildings around him looked far more dilapidated than before. The hotel behind him, in particular, was riddled with holes and covered with green plants.

If Shi Feng didn’t know any better, he would have thought he had left the Saint Camp for centuries or more rather than just one short day. The entire Saint Camp had already been devoured by a towering forest. The sky also no longer looked dull gray but a refreshing blue instead.

Apart from Shi Feng, the other players in the Saint Camp were also greatly shocked by the scene before them.

“What happened here?”

“I was still walking on the street normally a moment ago. Yet, everything instantly changed after the system announced someone triggered an event.”

“Mana! I can release my mana from my body!”

“Impossible! Weren’t Saints the only players who could release mana in the Holy World?”

“It’s true! I just tried it! I can really release my mana from my body!”

…

Apart from the change in scenery, everyone also noticed a change to the Holy World’s mana, and many people couldn’t help but be delighted and excited by this change.

Due to the Holy World having incredibly rich mana, players were greatly restricted when it came to using their own mana. Most players couldn’t even release their mana from their bodies to manipulate the ambient mana around them. As a result, this prevented them from exhibiting their full strength.

However, now that they could release their mana from their bodies, it would undoubtedly make it easier for them to kill monsters and raid Dungeons. This, in turn, would speed up the rate at which they could obtain God Crystal Fragments.

While immersed in surprise and delight, everyone suddenly received a system notification.

…

System Announcement: A player has successfully triggered a Global Event. The Holy World has successfully evolved into the Eternal Realm. All players within the Eternal Realm will no longer be subject to any restrictions. All players can now log off normally and communicate with players outside the Eternal Realm.

System Announcement: All players in the Eternal Realm will no longer be subject to any level and tier restrictions.

…

Everyone in the Saint Camp fell silent momentarily when the system announcements appeared. Immediately afterward, almost everyone revealed an ecstatic look.

“Are you kidding me?! A Realm?! The Holy World has evolved into a new Realm?!”

“Who caused this?! Aren’t they a little too lucky?!”

“Crap! I’m not dreaming, am I? A new Realm! I never thought I could experience such a historical event in my lifetime! Could we have traveled back to God’s Domain’s ancient times?”

…

All the players in the Saint Camp reacted with great excitement and enthusiasm toward the system announcement. Some even revealed intoxicated looks.

There were three thousand Realms in the Greater God’s Domain, and countless God’s Domains were connected to these Realms. This might seem like a lot, but after so many years of development, these three thousand Realms had long become overcrowded. The various upper-ranking hegemonic powers, conglomerates, and apex powers had also deeply ingrained themselves within these Realms, their positions in these Realms becoming unshakable.

Unfortunately, the number of Realms in the Greater God’s Domain had seemingly been fixed since ancient times. According to the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s record of existing history, no new Realms had emerged in the Greater God’s Domain since the ancient era.

Now that a new Realm had suddenly appeared, it went without saying that this was a shocking and fortuitous event.

Realms were not only vast and rich in resources, but they also served as a connection point for countless new God’s Domains. Meanwhile, these new God’s Domains were the main source for the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers to recruit geniuses.

In modern times, though, the various conglomerates and apex powers would quickly lay claim over any newly appeared God’s Domain. Because of this, it became very difficult for newer powers to grow, and the birth of a new conglomerate or apex power would only occur once every few hundred years.

However, a new opportunity had appeared now!

The birth of a new Realm was a massive opportunity for hegemonic powers and corporations to develop into upper-ranking hegemonic powers and conglomerates. Existing conglomerates could even use this opportunity to develop into a cross-realm conglomerates.

But compared to the opportunity provided to the various powers, the emergence of a new Realm created an even bigger opportunity for the individual player.

It was true that the existing Realms in the Greater God’s Domain were rich in resources. However, compared to ancient times, the Realms in modern times were vastly inferior regarding resources. This was because many of the rarer and more valuable resources had long been harvested and exhausted by people of the past.

It should be known that the Greater God’s Domain used to be crowded with Gods during the ancient era. And although humans were one of the weaker races at the time, the human race back then still had far more Tier 6 powerhouses and Saints than the human race of modern times.

Ultimately, the reason for this difference was the vastly superior resources available during the ancient era.

However, it was a different story for the Eternal Realm. The abundance of the Eternal Realm’s resources was even greater than the various Realms during the ancient era. This was because the Eternal Realm had just been born, so it had never been developed by players.

Meanwhile, as the first batch of players to arrive in the Eternal Realm, they had a much bigger advantage than players outside the Eternal Realm.

Although there were many Realms in the Greater God’s Domain, the various Realms were scattered across the Void Sea and far apart. Meanwhile, as a newly born Realm, the Eternal Realm’s location in the Void Sea remained unknown to everyone. If players from other Realms wished to enter the Eternal Realm, they would first have to search for it in the Void Sea, which was by no means an easy task.

By the time the various Realms’ players and powers located the Eternal Realm, they, the pioneers of the Eternal Realm, would have long explored a significant portion of the Eternal Realm. It wouldn’t even be surprising for a bunch of Tier 6 players and Tier 6 Saints to appear and occupy a corner of the Eternal Realm for themselves.

The Eternal Realm? Shouldn’t it only appear five years later?

Shi Feng was somewhat familiar with the name of the new Realm mentioned in the system announcement. After all, it had caused a huge commotion across the entire Greater God’s Domain when it initially appeared during his previous life. Back then, even the various apex powers had gotten involved in the competition for this new Realm’s resources.

However, according to his memories, the Eternal Realm should have only appeared five years from now…

…

While everyone in the Eternal Realm was excited, many of the various powers’ experts quickly logged out of the game to report this situation to their superiors.
