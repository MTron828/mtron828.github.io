Chapter 355 - Biggest Winner

“We’ve been had! This Black Flame is too cunning! He wasn’t trying to run away at all! Instead, he was luring us over here! Everyone, be careful!”

“What’s there to be afraid of? They only have over a hundred people. We have over ten thousand on our side. Do they think they can really turn the tide?”

Although the crowd had discovered the that something was wrong, they couldn’t care less.

An arrow fitted on the bow-string couldn’t avoid being fired.

Shi Feng had simply obtained too many dropped items. They might not get another opportunity to find such a fat sheep in the future. Right now, the total number of drops all of their Guilds obtained was nowhere near what Shi Feng carried. Hence, they would not hesitate, even if they had to start a war with these hundreds of players from Zero Wing.

“Hahaha! Excellent! We could only play the role of side characters back in Creek Town. Now, I can finally exercise my hands!” Blackie said joyfully as he watched the incoming crowd.

“Blackie, don’t kill too many. Let the others get some practice as well. It isn’t very often we get to participate in such a large-scale battle,” Fire Dance smiled faintly as she unsheathed her daggers and entered stealth.

Black and Fire Dance’s excitement left their teammates speechless.

In Zero Wing, it was common knowledge that Blackie and Fire Dance were the two gods of slaughter in the Guild. In the previous war involving four of the top six Guilds of White River City, if Blackie had not wielded large-scale magic such as the Stars of Light, Fire Dance’s total number of kills would have definitely surpassed his.

“Everyone, be careful. Since these people have survived until now, they should have some strength.” Aqua Rose simply ignored Blackie’s and Fire Dance’s actions. The Attack Power the two of them possessed was simply not something others could replicate.

“Big Sis Aqua, don’t worry! Now that we have upgraded our equipment, this is a perfect chance to see how much we have improved.”

The others started laughing.

After the death of the Mechanical Slayer, the magic barrier protecting the treasures of the Blood Hand Association also disappeared. The Blood Hand Association’s treasures were a great eye-opener for everyone. In total, they claimed several hundred Mysterious-Iron items. There were also plenty of Secret-Silver and Fine-Gold ranked weapons and equipment. After distributing and equipping these items, everyone’s equipment standard had significantly improved.

Now, although their opponents numbered over ten thousand, they possessed the advantage of levels and equipment. They also occupied a strategic location. After all, the Teleportation Hall could only hold so many people at a single time. It was not possible for all of the incoming players to squeeze into the hall simultaneously. In other words, despite the overwhelming odds, they were not without a chance for victory.

At this moment, Shi Feng stopped right before the entrance of the Teleportation Hall. He then turned to face the various Guilds charging at him.

On one side, there were over ten thousand players, while on the other, there were a hundred or so players. The difference in numbers was over 100 times. However, the various Guilds abruptly stopped when the distance between them and Shi Feng shortened to 50 yards.

“Black Flame, don’t think that you are invincible just because you now have back up! If you hand over the loot, we will consider sparing your life! Otherwise, today will be the day that your legend comes to an end!”

“Hand over the drops, and we’ll spare you your life! Otherwise, you and your team will be finished!”

The Guild Leaders of the various Guilds glared at Shi Feng with crazed eyes. They wanted nothing more than to murder Shi Feng right now. Previously, the massacre the Mechanical Slayer carried out under Shi Feng’s lead severely wounded their Guilds. Afterward, due to Shi Feng faking his own death, they even began to slaughter each other indiscriminately, decreasing their numbers once more. Now, so many reinforcements suddenly appeared. Who knew if Shi Feng had anything else prepared?

Now that Shi Feng had suddenly turned to smile at them, how could they not feel worried? Hence, they all decided to halt their steps rather than continuing to charge forward.

What if they recklessly rushed again, only to find themselves caught by another one of Shi Feng’s traps?

Thus, nobody dared to be the first to charge over.

“What’s the point of talking so much trash? You’ve chased me for so long, so shouldn’t it be my turn now?” Shi Feng smirked at the army of players before him. Revealing a faint smile, he slowly unsheathed the Abyssal Blade.

Shi Feng’s calm reaction began to unnerve some of the Guilds present.

Facing an army of over ten thousand, even a first-rate expert would react anxiously. However, even after observing Shi Feng for so long, they could not detect the slightest hint of panic on his face.

Did Shi Feng truly possess another card that could allow his small team to defeat them?

“Big Brother Red, there is definitely something suspicious going on. Now that Black Flame has reached the Teleportation Hall, he can escape at any time. Yet, instead of doing so, he actually plans to take a stand,” Flourishing Willow said, her brows tightening.

Red Feather nodded in agreement, feeling that something was indeed wrong with this situation.

Before, Shi Feng could have simply escaped into White River City’s safe zone. At that time, with the protection of the city guards, it would not be so easy to steal the Mechanical Slayer’s loot from him anymore.

Yet, instead of doing so, Shi Feng had gradually lured everyone to the Teleportation Hall. Why would Shi Feng do such a thing?

“Crap! We’ve been tricked! Black Flame is trying to buy time!” Red Feather suddenly panicked. Hurriedly, he opened the team member display to check whether or not his team members inside the White River City safe zone were safe.

“Big Brother Red, what’s going on?” Flourishing Willow looked at Red Feather, confused.

“Black Flame is trying to lure the tiger away from the mountain. Zero Wing has over 5,000 members, yet, only a hundred or so are here. Since he could call over these hundred or so members, why didn’t he send for even more reinforcements?” Red Feather explained. “The only reason he did not send for more reinforcements was that he had sent the rest to hunt the transport teams who are safeguarding the loot. Moreover, by blocking the Teleportation Hall, he can choose to attack or retreat any time he wants. As soon as the other members of Zero Wing obtain the drops, they can leave immediately.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Red Feather had not used the team chat when he spoke. Moreover, he had not kept his voice down, so the other Guilds had heard his words very clearly. Suddenly, the Guild Leaders of the various Guilds turned pale.

Immediately, they started contacting the players that were transporting the dropped items.

However, none of their calls connected. The results were the same when they tried contacting the other team members of the transport team.

“You’ve only realized it now? Unfortunately, it’s too late,” Shi Feng laughed, shaking his head as he watched the various Guilds’ actions.

Indeed, just as Red Feather had guessed, even before he had slaughtered the members of Dark Star, he had arranged for Zero Wing’s army to keep an eye on the transport teams of the other Guilds. When Shi Feng started his battle with Dark Star, Zero Wing’s army took action.

As the various Guilds had lusted after the items on Shi Feng, they had not allocated many members to escort the transport team. Some Guilds only allocated a few dozen members, while some had only allocated a dozen or so. Meanwhile, each of Zero Wing’s groups consisted of at least more than a hundred. Some even possessed up to 400 members. There was no way they would fail.

Moreover, in order to prevent these transport teams from reporting back to their respective Guilds about the ambush, Shi Feng had purchased a large number of Information Sealing Scrolls from the Magic Shop. The Information Sealing Scroll was extremely expensive, with each one costing 50 Silver Coins. This scroll could neither attack nor defend. It was also not a support item. In addition, the scroll could only target players. This scroll’s only function was to prevent players from using the game’s communication system for a certain amount of time. During this period, players could not receive or send any messages. The only form of communication they could use was ordinary speech. Hence, all this time, the Information Sealing Scroll was an item that the player populace of God’s Domain had ignored.

During the ambush, although these transport teams were just a short distance away from the battlefield, they could not contact their respective Guilds to request reinforcements. Faced with troops several times their number, these transport teams had no chance of protecting the loot they carried.

Also, even though these transport teams were inside the city’s safe zone, the city guards needed time to come to their rescue. During this time, unless the transport team of a Guild possessed only top-tier experts, their deaths were all but certain. Even if the city guards arrived later, the dropped items of the Mechanical Slayer could simply be passed on and claimed by the Zero Wing members who had not participated in the battle.

At this moment, Red Feather was livid. Although he did not know how Shi Feng had sealed off their communication, when he saw the HP bars of his team members decreasing, he could guess what had happened.

Without a doubt, his team members were definitely caught in an intense battle.

At this moment, Red Feather finally realized that he had massively underestimated Shi Feng. He had been thoroughly fooled by Shi Feng’s facade of a first-rate expert. Compared to Shi Feng’s combat techniques, his cunning was far more terrifying.

Despite the price so many players and Guilds had paid, in the end, Zero Wing became the biggest, no, the only winner of this war.

Rather than calling Shi Feng a fledgling fox, it would be more appropriate to consider him an old demon fox that has lived for countless years.
