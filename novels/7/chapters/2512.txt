Chapter 2513 – Power of One Strike

When the Level 108, Tier 3 Shield Warrior’s body collapsed to the ground and disintegrated into particles of light, the entire world seemingly froze momentarily as silence enveloped the battlefield. Only after some time had passed did everyone react to the situation.

“He died?”

“Impossible!”

Everyone was dumbstruck as they looked at the lithe figure standing behind the Shield Warrior’s corpse. This was especially true for the players from the Sentinel Shelter. Their mouths were hanging wide open in shock because nobody knew better than they did just how much HP and Defense the fallen Shield Warrior possessed.

It was no exaggeration to say that even if a Tier 3 Berserker were allowed to freely attack the Shield Warrior using Skills, the Berserker would need at least ten attacks to kill the Shield Warrior. Now, however, let alone ten attacks, the Shield Warrior had failed to sundve even one. The Sentinel Shelter丨s healers didn’t even have a chance to heal the Shield Warrior.

“That’s a Tier 3 Demonized Shield Warrior we’re talking about! Is she even human?!” Purple Rakshasa could not help her astonishment as she stared at Fire Dance, who was slowly walking up to Shi Feng.

Purple Rakshasa had clashed with a Tier 3 Demonized expert before, so she knew exactly how powerful Tier 3 Demonized experts were. Their high Defense and HP aside, just their physique granted them reaction speeds far superior to Tier 3 human players’.

However, Fire Dance had attacked and instantly killed the Demonized Shield Warrior without the Shield Warrior even reacting.

Fire Dance’s reaction speed and Attack Power were simply unheard-of.

“She’s actually so strong?” When Graceful Monarch looked at Fire Dance’s distant figure, shock and excitement flashed across her eyes.

Power!

Violence!

The suffocating strength Fire Dance displayed was something Graceful Monarch was constantly seeking to attain. Graceful Monarch never thought that she would get to witness this domineering display in person. Moreover, the monster that had carried out this display of power had actually been standing beside Shi Feng all this time.

At this moment, let alone Graceful Monarch and the other distant spectators, even Blue Frost and his teammates, who stood behind Shi Feng, were stunned by this situation. They never imagined that the people from Zero Wing’s main branch would be this powerful.

Meanwhile, Troubled Times, who had been silently observing Fire Dance all along, similarly wore an astonished expression on his face.

“I truly did not expect Zero Wing to have such an expert hidden. No wonder you dare to hinder us,” Troubled Times said as he shifted his gaze back to Shi Feng. “However, if you think you can stop the Sentinel Shelter with just this much strength, I’m afraid you’re sorely mistaken!”

As soon as Troubled Times finished speaking, the 17 Tier 3 experts behind him promptly took on a Demon form. The frightening aura they released enveloped the entire battlefield and evoked dread even in experts like Blue Frost.

Although these Tier 3 Demonized experts numbered only 17, the combined pressure they gave off easily surpassed that of the Sentinel Shelter’s several hundred Tier 2 Demonized experts.

“It seems Troubled Times is getting serious.” A somber expression appeared on Purple Rakshasa’s face when the Sentinel Shelter’s Tier 3 experts Demonized.

The Shield Warrior that previously took action was only at the Refinement Realm. His combat standard was also the weakest among the Sentinel Shelter’s Tier 3 experts present. Meanwhile, if every one of the Sentinel Shelter’s Tier 3 experts attacked together, even Fire Dance would not be a match for them. After all, this was a team battle, not a one- on-one duel. Not only could players reduce their defensive blindspots by working with teammates, but they would also have a much easier time striking at the enemy’s weak points.

Not to mention, the Assassin class was at its strongest when it was in Stealth. So long as an Assassin was discovered, their combat power would be halved. Meanwhile, at this point, Troubled Times and the others had already noticed Fire Dance’s existence. She wouldn’t have another opportunity to launch a sneak attack.

In the next moment, the 17 Tier 3 Demonized experts rapidly closed in on Shi Feng’s group, their positioning leaving Fire Dance no chance to fight them one-on-one. At the same time, every one of them used their trademark moves.

Tier 3 Spell, Shadow Puncture!

Tier 3 Skill, Chaotic Slash!

Tier 3 Skill, Shadow Raid!

Tier 3 Spell, Flame Dragon Bind!

Over a dozen Skills and Spells flew at Shi Feng’s group. Seeing all these powerful attacks approaching them, Blue Frost and the Zero Wing members with him could not help but despair.

Not only did every one of these Skills and Spells possess power close to the Tier 4 standard, but these Skills and Spells also overlapped into a perfect assault that had no holes to exploit. It simply wasn’t an attack that players could block or dodge.

However, contrary to everyone’s expectations, Fire Dance did not use Vanish or Wind Steps to defend herself even after seeing these perfectly coordinated attacks. Instead, she simply stood beside Shi Feng, showing no intention of taking action whatsoever. It was as if the coordinated attacks of the Tier 3 Demonized experts did not exist in her eyes at all.

Just when the Demonized experts’ Skills and Spells were about to reach Shi Feng and Fire Dance, Shi Feng suddenly took action.

Sword’s Orbit!

A galaxy of stars immediately appeared, with Shi Feng as the center, the stars striking down the approaching Skills and Spells, one after another. From afar, the attacks seemed to disappear automatically upon reaching within 10 yards of Shi Feng. Let alone damaging Shi Feng, none of them managed to cause him to stumble by even one step.

“Impossible! He blocked them all?!”

Upon seeing Shi Feng shattering their assault, the Tier 3 Demonized experts were dumbfounded. After all, not only did their attacks carry great power, but there were also more than 20 of them timed to hit Shi Feng and Fire Dance simultaneously. Every one of these attacks was also aimed at the pair’s defensive blind spots. Unless Shi Feng and Fire Dance used an Invulnerability Skill, they should have taken damage.

“It’s my turn now!”

Since the Sentinel Shelter’s players had stopped attacking, Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and brandished the Magic Weapon at the 17 Tier 3 Demonized experts.

Lightning Flash!

In the next moment, pitch-black sword lights wrapped in dense Mana struck the Demonized experts like pitch-black lightning arcs.

Peng... Peng... Peng...

A series of explosions reverberated throughout the battlefield. At the same time, the 17 Tier 3 Demonized experts went flying backward, each of them losing over -100,000 HP. When they landed, their hands and weapons they wielded trembled uncontrollably.

“Is he a monster?”

The spectating players gasped upon seeing this scene.

Those were 17 Tier 3 Demonized experts! If they moved together as a team, no existence in the Dark Den could hinder their advance. Even the mighty Tier 4 Mythic monsters were no exception.

Now, however, Shi Feng had actually repelled all these experts with a single move. Moreover, he had even injured them quite heavily.

Before everyone could snap out of their daze, Shi Feng brandished Killing Ray once more. This time, though, he directed his attack toward Troubled Times over 30 yards away.

First Sword, Lightshadow! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Immediately, the phantom of a gigantic greatsword appeared in midair. When it descended on Troubled Times, it looked as if a mountain was falling toward the Berserker. The AOE of the attack was so large that evasion was impossible. Moreover, space shattered wherever the gigantic sword passed.

Troubled Times’s complexion turned grim when he saw this attack. He hurriedly raised his war axe and met the oncoming attack head-on.

“Shatter!”

Tier 3 Taboo Skill, Heaven Breaker!

In the next moment, Troubled Times’s axe also cut space and landed directly on the phantom greatsword.

Boom!

Along with the sound of an explosion, the ground shook violently. And as if a violent storm had just passed, dust filled the air, preventing those standing on the battlefield from opening their eyes.

When the dust settled and the situation on the battlefield became clear again, everyone was dumbfounded.

At this moment, the almighty Troubled Times came into view, partly embedded into the ground, his kneecaps no longer visible. At the same time, the ground within a 10-yard radius of the Berserker had also sunk by over a meter. As for Troubled Times himself, he had also lost more than one-fifth of his HP.
