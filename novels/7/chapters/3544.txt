Chapter 619 – Tier Difference!

“Despicable humans! Don’t you dare look down on the Holy Race!”

When the Beast Berserker commander saw a second Stars From Heaven being used, he unleashed his Holy Aura and transformed into a giant measuring several hundred meters in height.

The giant was clad in armor and wielded four axes with its two sets of arms. The giant looked like a titan from primordial times, and every one of his movements caused space to tear.

Immediately after appearing on the battlefield, the primordial titan spun his body and created a whirlwind with his axes, causing the countless descending arrows to scatter and devastate the surrounding street and buildings.

A Beast Berserker?

When Shi Feng saw the primordial titan neutralizing Dawn Arrow’s Stars From Heaven, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.

The Beast Berserker class was a Peak Class among the Holy Race. It was an incredibly rare class with stringent requirements. Even among the Holy Race, few Beast Berserkers existed. Meanwhile, unlike the human race’s Peak Classes, the Holy Race’s Peak Classes not only offered players a larger variety of Class Skills, but they also offered players Talents that could grant them unimaginable combat power.

In the case of the Beast Berserker class, its Talent was called Ancestral Manifestation. Depending on the level of mastery players had over their Holy Aura, the size and strength of their Ancestral Manifestation would differ.

For example, an Ancestral Manifestation that was several hundred meters tall would be slightly stronger than the average Divine monster. If an Ancestral Manifestation reached a thousand meters tall, its strength would rival the Tier 6 Gods.

At the same time as the Beast Berserker commander neutralized Dawn Arrow’s Stars From Heaven, Dawn Arrow and Azure Shadow promptly followed up with more Tier 6 Skills.

Tier 6 Skill, Scattered Explosions!

Tier 6 Skill, Strike From Heaven!

Scattered Explosions could transform the user’s arrows into AOE attacks and be impossible to block. Moreover, the higher the Skill Completion Rate, the greater the power and AOE of the attacks would be. As for Strike From Heaven, it would transform the user into an arrow and launch it at a speed that triumphed over all Ranger Skills. Meanwhile, the higher the Skill Completion Rate, the faster and stronger the arrow would be.

When Dawn Arrow and Azure Shadow saw the Beast Berserker neutralize Dawn Arrow’s Stars From Heaven, they instantly knew they wouldn’t be a match for the other party in a one-on-one situation. The gap in combat standards simply wasn’t something they could hope to bridge with their enhanced mana and advantage in tier. If they wanted to beat the Beast Berserker, their only option would be to work together and rely on their advantage in Skills.

Thanks to the Bronze Mana Purification Technique they learned, not only did the raw power of their Skills increase significantly, but even their Skill Completion Rates had reached an unprecedented high. Previously, the best they could achieve was an 85% Skill Completion Rate with their Tier 6 Skills. Now, they could use their Tier 6 Skills at a Completion Rate of 90% or above, which, in turn, allowed their Skills to exhibit power comparable to the standard of Tier 6 Gods.

Hence, even though the Beast Berserker had tried his best to avoid the attacks from Dawn Arrow’s Scattered Explosions with his superior combat standards, his gigantic Ancestral Manifestation still ended up getting caught within the large AOE of multiple explosions, causing him to lose a significant amount of HP.

At the same time, Azure Shadow, while in his Strike From Heaven form, executed the Advanced Silver Combat Technique Thousand Mirages and repeatedly struck the defensive Ancestral Manifestation, causing the other party to stumble time and again.

After this cycle was repeated only three times, the Beast Berserker with superior combat standards succumbed to Dawn Arrow’s and Azure Shadow’s overwhelming Tier 6 Skills and fell.

He died, just like that? Billowing Water couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw the Beast Berserker’s body scattering into particles of light. Although she had long guessed this outcome, she still couldn’t help but be a little shocked when she saw how effortlessly the Beast Berserker got killed.

Meanwhile, a moment after the Beast Berserker got killed, the Night Watch battle group’s other members also finished eliminating the Holy Race legion’s surviving party and team leaders and started to collect the loot the Holy Race players dropped.

“Why are you here, Miss Billow? Didn’t you teleport away with Party Leader Pivot and the others before?” Shi Feng asked as he approached Billowing Water.

Level 170-plus Legendary Regional Bosses roamed the Nameless City’s core region. Many Holy Race legions also operated in this region. It simply wasn’t a place Billowing Water could operate in by herself, so he found it strange to find her here by herself.

Hearing Shi Feng’s question, Billowing Water wryly smiled and answered, “Our random teleportation brought us to the core region. Seeing it was a rare opportunity, we decided to explore the area cautiously. Not long ago, we coincidentally came across several tens of thousands of Holy Race experts raiding a Level 175 Divine-ranked Guardian Dragon.

“When the Guardian Dragon died, it dropped about a dozen incredible items. At the same time, its death undid the seal of a six-eyed God from the Holy Race. After being freed, the six-eyed God signed a contract with the Holy Race’s various powers. Based on what we heard, so long as the various powers can sacrifice a certain number of human players to the six-eyed God, they could obtain great strength.

“Originally, we wanted to bring this information back to Seven Luminaries Town, but the Holy Race’s God discovered us. Although we were fortunate enough to snatch two of the dropped items, we later got chased by the Holy Race legion, and only I managed to survive until this point.”

“The Holy Race’s various powers signed a contract with a six-eyed God?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but frown when he heard Billowing Water’s recollection.

The Holy Race’s Gods came in all shapes and sizes. But out of all the Holy Race Gods he knew of, only one had six eyes.

The Soul-Eating Ancestor!

The Soul-Eating Ancestor was a God who grew stronger by devouring the Immortal Souls of human players. At the same time, it could grant Holy Race players bloodlines of higher purity, allowing them to improve much more quickly than human players. In addition, the Soul-Eating Ancestor was one of the strongest Holy Race Gods who had led the attack on the Greater God’s Domain’s Twelve Sanctuaries.

However, according to Shi Feng’s knowledge, it should still be several years before the Holy Race players unseal the Soul-Eating Ancestor. The fact that the Soul-Eating Ancestor was unsealed so soon in this timeline definitely wasn’t good news for the human race. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Now that the Holy Race’s various powers had the Soul-Eating Ancestor’s assistance, they could rapidly grow stronger so long as they kept sacrificing human players. In contrast, human players could only rely on gradual exploration of the Eternal Realm to uncover stronger Legacies.

It should be known that the first Holy Mana War would begin in the not-so-distant future. If this situation continued, Shi Feng couldn’t even begin to imagine what would happen to the human race at that time.

“I really have to thank you for saving me this time, Guild Leader Black Flame. Otherwise, I would have had to suffer the same fate as Party Leader Pivot and the others,” Billowing Water said gratefully. Then, she couldn’t help but turn to look at Azure Shadow and the other Tier 6 players of Shi Feng’s team and asked, “Also, would you be willing to negotiate a deal with the Blaze Conglomerate, Guild Leader Black Flame?”

Although she didn’t know what kind of relationship these seventeen Tier 6 experts shared with Shi Feng, the fact that Shi Feng could gather seventeen Tier 6 experts in the Eternal Realm was more than enough for the Blaze Conglomerate to take Shi Feng very seriously.
