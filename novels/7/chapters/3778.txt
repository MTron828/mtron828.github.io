Chapter 3779 - 853 - Super-Ancient Ruin

The system announcement echoed across Flame Vein Holy City three times, sending hundreds of millions of players into turmoil.

“Have the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty lost their minds? Why are they initiating an all-out war right off the bat?! Do they not know that Holy Dragon Spear is allied with Red-Tailed Dragon?”

“They’re probably trying to catch Holy Dragon Spear by surprise. After all, the Divine Wing Dynasty isn’t among the powers who discovered the Eternal Realm’s entrance, so its main forces are still in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. On the other hand, both Holy Dragon Spear and Red-Tailed Dragon have their main forces at the entrance.”

“A national war? How many years has it been since such a war occurred in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary? I didn’t expect to receive such a surprise the moment I came online! Who’s joining the war? Contact me! We must let the Imperial Ice Empire’s and the Five Saints Empire’s people know that the people of Flame Vein Holy City aren’t pushovers!”

…

As more Tier 6 NPCs and players appeared above Flame Vein Holy City, the city’s original inhabitants started to form teams to target either the two empires’ NPCs or the two pseudo-apex powers’ experts. This situation stunned the players who had come to watch the Battle of the Chosen Ones.

More than eight pseudo-apex powers operated in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, the most famous of which were the first-ranked Dragon God Palace Guild and the second-ranked Red-Tailed Dragon Guild. As for the Divine Wing Dynasty, it was a Guild slightly weaker than the Holy Dragon Spear adventurer team, but it still ranked sixth.

Nobody in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary had ever anticipated an all-out war among these four powers. After all, it had been ages since an all-out war between pseudo-apex powers occurred in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. The last time it happened was over a century ago.

Meanwhile, such a war often affected not just the pseudo-apex powers involved but also the countries and cities affiliated with them. Thus, a war involving pseudo-apex powers would embroil a huge portion of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary.

For players not directly involved in the war, the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary was now a land of opportunity and hardship. They could now kill Tier 6 NPCs without consequences, including high-status NPCs, who were considered walking treasure troves.

…

Flame Vein Battle Arena:

Over a thousand Tier 6 experts from Holy Dragon Spear surrounded the VIP room Ember Dragon occupied, creating an oppressive atmosphere.

“Ember Dragon! Has the Dragon God Palace gone crazy?! Even if you win, you will accomplish nothing but benefit outsiders!” South Lake bellowed as he glared at the calm-looking Ember Dragon.

The raid by the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty happened so suddenly that he didn’t receive any prior news about it. Even more shockingly, these two powers were willing to involve the Imperial Ice Empire’s and the Five Saints Empire’s strongest combatants.

Hawke Barron, Grand Duke of the Imperial Ice Empire, a Level 244, Tier 6 NPC!

Highgate the Heavenly Dragon, Grand Marshal of the Five Saints Empire, a Level 242, Tier 6 NPC!

The strongest combatants of their empires, these two NPCs stood just below the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos in strength.

In the Greater God’s Domain, few NPCs ever reached Level 240 or above. Those who did manage to do so could rival Ancient Gods of the same level, and defeating them required a full party of equally leveled players fully equipped with Divine Artifacts.

However, even apex powers considered Divine Artifacts the highest form of luxury. This made it extremely difficult for pseudo-apex powers to assemble a six-man party fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. Not to mention, all six players needed to be at Level 240 at the very least.

Upon reaching Level 200, players could only receive EXP from killing monsters of the same level or higher. Additionally, players were limited to receiving EXP from quests ranked Epic or above. To make matters worse, the availability of monsters plummeted starting from Level 220, while the difficulty of killing them skyrocketed. This caused most players to stagnate in their levels after reaching Level 220.

“I never truly wanted things to come to this point, Great Commander South Lake,” Ember Dragon said, his smile thin. Glancing at Red Frost standing outside the ring, he continued, “But you only have your Mortal God to blame for this. We originally intended to partner with Holy Dragon Spear and jointly explore the super-ancient ruins you’ve been hiding. Now, though? We plan to take the ruins for ourselves!”

“Super-ancient ruins? You know about the hidden site?!” South Lake’s expression twisted in shock.

“Although Holy Dragon Spear has done well to keep it under wraps, nothing stays hidden forever,” Ember Dragon said, a low chuckle escaping him. “Super-ancient ruins—one of the few Level 230-plus Taboo Dungeons in the Greater God’s Domain. If Holy Dragon Spear gets to exploit it freely, you will eventually crush every other power in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. In that case, we might as well strike first!”

After saying so, Ember Dragon retrieved a turbid, dark golden dragon eye from his bag and chanted. Immediately, Flame Vein Holy City shuddered as a massive fissure tore it in two. Then, a colossal gate over 100,000 meters tall rose from the city’s depths, unleashing an oppressive Divine Might that made even Level 220, Tier 6 experts buckle.

The Flame Dragon God’s Nest?

Shi Feng gaped as he stared at the colossal crimson gate.
