Chapter 474 - Abyssal Upgrade

The black dragon’s roar shook the sky, loud enough that anyone nearby would notice it.

“What a powerful roar; a high-level monster must’ve spawned somewhere nearby.”

“We’ll be rich if it’s a Chieftain!”

“Let’s go and take a look! We can’t let others snatch it from us!”

When a team of over 20 players a short distance from the tomb noticed the black dragon’s roar, they finished off the monsters they currently faced and rushed over to the tomb.

The Watch Cemetery was a land of treasures, and one could even discover a treasure chest by accidentally falling into a hole. However, powerful monsters were rare in the Watch Cemetery, and normally, these monsters lingered near treasures. This had already become a publicly acknowledged trend.

This monster’s roar alone was already so powerful. No one who heard it would risk missing this opportunity.

At the same time, many other teams who had heard this frightening roar also ran towards the tomb and Shi Feng.

At the epicenter of the roar, however, one man and one dragon stared each other down. The dragon released a frightening aura, and the surrounding air had started begun to stagnate.

“Is this the Backlash?”

At this moment, Shi Feng had heightened his five senses to their very limits, wearing a grim expression. All of his concentration was on the black dragon phantom before him. Although the black dragon was not the real thing, only a phantom, Shi Feng proceeded with caution.

Moreover, Shi Feng had not reacted in such a way intentionally. His response had been an unconscious decision.

The chilling killing intent in the phantom’s gaze was so intense that Shi Feng was breathless. He had never felt anything like this before, even against a Great Lord.

Shi Feng had never encountered the Backlash of a Magic Weapon before. He had also never heard about what exactly occurred during a Backlash.

However, seeing that so many top-tier experts had fallen to it in the past, a Magic Weapon’s Backlash was no trivial matter. A single mistake and Shi Feng might end up with a crippled character. This was also why every player had to consider their options carefully when they obtained a Magic Weapon.

While Shi Feng prepared to face a powerful enemy, the black dragon’s phantom only pinned Shi Feng with its crimson eyes. It had not attacked.

“You’re not going to strike?” Shi Feng was slightly surprised.

Although Shi Feng had not taken any measures to deal with the Abyssal Blade’s Backlash, his brain activity’s improvement had allowed him to reach the Refinement Realm. With the techniques he had learned, he was already more powerful than he had been in the past, so he was confident that he could deal with the Backlash.

The black dragon’s phantom suddenly revealed a human-like sneer, deep disdain filling its eyes as it glared at Shi Feng. Following which, the phantom vanished, leaving behind only a pile of ruins and the Abyssal Blade, which buried its blade in the ground.

At this moment, the Abyssal Blade had recovered its original black color and was now thoroughly pitch-black. There was a faint layer of black smoke surrounding it, and no one could see the weapon during the dead of night.

“Is this not the Backlash?” Shi Feng examined the Abyssal Blade, disbelief coloring his expression. “Sure enough, the more I level up the Abyssal Blade, the more powerful the black dragon becomes, and the weaker the suppression becomes.”

Shi Feng walked over and pulled the Abyssal Blade from the ground. He then checked the Attributes of the Magic Weapon.

The Abyssal Blade was personally created by master smith Olysses using the Black Dragon King’s fangs as material. It is one of thirty-six famed swords, and it is ranked 31st. However, this sword has been cursed by the Black Dragon King. Aside from providing the wielder with immense strength, there will be a Backlash every period of time. However, after being remodeled by Jack using a Star Crystal, the strength of the Backlash has been greatly reduced. If the wielder is unable to suppress the Backlash, the wielder will receive the curse of the Black Dragon King, permanently reducing all Attributes by 50%.

Unable to be dropped.

Unable to be traded.

The Basic Attributes and the skills of the Abyssal Blade had not undergone any significant changes. However, the Magic Weapon’s Attack Power had massively improved. Previously, its Attack Power was only slightly over 300. After this evolution, its Attack Power had soared past 400. It was nearly 50 points higher than Fire Dance’s Level 25 Dark-Gold ranked Truefire Blade.

After retrieving the Abyssal Blade, Shi Feng swung it a few times. He swung the weapon at a damaged stone pillar nearby.

Ceng!

Shi Feng had not encountered any resistance as he cut into the stone. The sturdy pillar felt like air as the Abyssal Blade sliced through it, splitting it in two as it fell to the ground.

“So sharp!”

Shi Feng stared at the remains of the stone pillar with shock. He then glanced back at the Magic Weapon in his hand. The Abyssal Blade was practically a weapon of gods. With such sharpness, not even Secret-Silver Equipment could defend against it.

Just as Shi Feng was about to leave the tomb, over a hundred players suddenly emerged from the dark forest. With a quick glance, it was obvious that these players were not all members of the same team. These new arrivals were also independent players.

“This... What happened here?”

These players were stupefied upon arriving at the thoroughly ruined underground tomb. Currently, the underground tomb looked more like a crater.

“Someone’s there!” A Ranger with sharp eyesight pointed at Shi Feng who was preparing to leave the area.

Suddenly, everyone shifted their gaze towards Shi Feng.

At this moment, Shi Feng wore a black cloak that obscured his appearance. He had also hidden the glow effects of his equipment. However, judging by the fine workmanship of his equipment, it should be of high quality. At the very least, his equipment should be Mysterious-Iron rank or above. Shi Feng was also Level 26, so one could easily tell that he was not someone to provoke.

Just as these independent teams hesitated over whether to take action against Shi Feng or not, another party emerged from the forest. Every member of this party was Level 25 and above, and all of them were as robust as a bear. The other payers avoided eye contact with these newcomers, intimidated by their cold gazes. Most importantly, all of their names were crimson.

“Brother Deep, we seem to have good luck today. With such a large commotion, a treasure must have spawned here. That brat definitely has the treasure.”

“Yeah. His level is quite high as well. If we kill him, we will not have wasted a trip even if there is no treasure.”

This six-man party paid no attention to the hundred-plus independent players standing in the distance. Instead, their eyes were glued onto Shi Feng, looking at him as if he belonged only to them.

“Just who are these people? They actually dare act so arrogantly!” a male player from one of the independent teams grumbled.

The leader of said party glanced the party of six Red Names. Immediately, cold sweat beaded on his forehead as he hurriedly said, “Enough, we’re leaving.”

“But what about the treasure? Why should we let a single party have it? We outnumber them,” the male player asked, confused.

“Enough! You stop talking! If you want to die, go ahead, but don’t drag everyone else down with you! You’ve just arrived at Watch Cemetery, so you don’t know about the unspoken rules here; there are two types of people you can never provoke! The first are the Tier 1 experts of Zero Wing; they are the second—Overwhelming Smile’s parties! If we anger them, not a single one of us will get out of here alive!” the team leader scolded as he glared at the male player. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Upon hearing his team leader’s words, the male player immediately shut his mouth. Before he had arrived at Watch Cemetery, he had heard of the two types of people his leader referred to. Nothing much would happen if one encountered the experts of Zero Wing. However, if one encountered the killing gods from Overwhelming Smile, they better pray that the other side was in a good mood. Otherwise...

Following which, the other independent teams promptly departed from the area; not a single one of them dared to stay for the show.
