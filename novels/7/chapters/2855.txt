Chapter 2856 - Half-step Tier 5

“Requisition?” Fithalia was momentarily stunned by Brut’s words. “Have you lost your mind, Brut?”

Fithalia wasn’t the only person to have such thoughts. The spectating crowd thought so as well.

The Blood Alliance, with its many superpowers and NPC forces, was indeed powerful. However, the alliance’s strength was only in the sea.

On the western continent, the Blood Alliance held no advantages. Since the Starlight Fortress was far from the sea, the Blood Alliance had no way to dispatch a large army to the Starlight Fortress. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, the Starlight Fortress’s defenses were something that even the Five Great Super Guilds were helpless against. After all, the fortress had a Tier 4 Divine Dragon guarding it. Even Tier 5 NPCs wouldn’t dare go against such an existence.

This was why Zero Wing could retain control over the Starlight Fortress despite having barely any of its own forces stationed on the western continent. Otherwise, the surrounding NPC forces with Tier 5 NPCs leading them would’ve long since targeted the fortress.

The only measure one could employ to suppress the Starlight Fortress was to place a thorough lockdown on the Star Valley. However, the Blood Alliance clearly didn’t have the capability to pull off such a feat.

“Lost my mind?” Laughing, Brut retorted, “I don’t think so at all. The Starlight Fortress indeed possesses powerful defensive capabilities, and there are very few forces in God’s Domain capable of threatening it. However, if over a hundred Tier 4 NPCs lock down the Star Valley, I wonder how long the Starlight Fortress will last?” “Over a hundred Tier 4 NPCs?”

When Brut finished speaking, the spectating crowd gasped.

Currently, not only were NPCs much higher leveled than players on average, but NPCs were also stronger than players of the same level and tier on average. This was because NPCs’ weapons, equipment, Skills, and Spells were superior to those of the average player.

Meanwhile, a force of more than a hundred Tier 4 NPCs was something not even a kingdom possessed.

In other words, the Blood Alliance could actually dispatch an entire kingdom’s top combatants to seal a map! “Moreover, I heard that the situation over on the eastern continent is quite adverse, and many superpowers have already gotten annihilated. Even Zero Wing can barely keep itself afloat and can’t roam about freely. In such a situation, obtaining resources will naturally be impossible,” Brut said. “Without the Starlight Fortress’s resources, I believe Zero Wing will have even more difficulty surviving, right?

“Hence, we are inviting Zero Wing to become a member of the Blood Alliance right now. Not only will we help the Starlight Fortress develop, but we will also help Zero Wing defend against the Outerworld invaders. Wouldn’t this situation be the best of both worlds?”

Upon hearing Brut’s proposal, nobody present could offer any rebuttals, not even Fithalia.

The chaos on the eastern continent was no longer a secret.

The entire God’s Domain had been greatly shaken on the day the World Passage had opened, the sudden event catching countless powers off guard.

After all, a group of unknown player forces had suddenly appeared and taken over many Guild Cities of first-rate Guilds. In fact, these unknown player forces had even laid their hands on the Guild Cities of superpowers.

Originally, these superpowers had planned to retaliate against these unknown invaders. However, when they marched their armies to reclaim their cities, they found a large number of experts already gathered in their captured cities. Moreover, there were even many Tier 45 among these players.

Needless to say, none of the superpowers managed to recapture their cities.

Initially, the various powers of God’s Domain thought that this was merely a hidden superpower making its public debut. After all, this wasn’t the first time such a situation had taken place. Many player forces would continuously accumulate their strength in secret and make a powerful debut all of a sudden. Hence, the various powers of God’s Domain had not placed too much attention on this matter.

However, the next day, over a dozen superpowers had suddenly made their presence known to the world, and the number of Tier 4 players these superpowers commanded far exceeded that of the local superpowers. On that very day, these new superpowers annihilated a local superpower and split up its territory among themselves.

This war had thoroughly stupefied the various powers of God’s Domain!

It was one thing to see a new superpower emerge, but it was another thing altogether to see so many superpowers appear out of the blue. Moreover, all of these superpowers boasted an incredible number of Tier 4 players. No matter how one looked at this situation, it was simply unbelievable. After a series of frantic investigations, the various powers of God’s Domain eventually discovered that these new superpowers didn’t originate from their version of God’s Domain but from another God’s Domain. Moreover, the players belonging to these superpowers didn’t live on Earth but on an Interstellar Continent. The human population of this Interstellar Continent rivaled that of Earth. Most importantly, the average combat standard of these Interstellar Continent residents was much higher than that of Earthlings. This was because the world of God’s Domain was everything for these people! In addition, these Outerworld superpowers were much stronger than the native superpowers. In fact, the two couldn’t even be compared on the same level.

In less than five days, these Outerworld superpowers had not only destroyed several native superpowers but even taken over seven kingdoms. These kingdoms were now paradises for Outerworld NPCs, who rapidly harvested the various resources available in these kingdoms to keep growing stronger.

Meanwhile, in response to these invaders, the various native kingdoms and empires had gathered players to fight off these Outerworld players and NPCs. The subsequent war was most likely one of the biggest in God’s Domain’s history, as several dozen kingdoms and empires had joined hands to counter the invasion. And after fighting dozens of battles, both large and small, the eastern continent’s native forces eventually managed to isolate the Outerworld’s NPC forces to one corner of the continent.

However, in exchange for this outcome, the eastern continent’s native forces had lost nearly one-third of their land.

Moreover, this isolation affected only the Outerworld’s NPC forces. The Outerworld’s individual NPCs and player forces could still roam freely.

In a situation where native players were inferior in terms of both levels and combat standards, the eastern continent’s players were at an absolute disadvantage. Only by cooperating with native NPCs could they resist the Outerworld players.

It was obvious that the eastern continent’s native forces would crumble in the near future as more and more Outerworld players and NPCs invaded the eastern continent. In fact, it wouldn’t be long before the western continent would get dragged into the war since the various sea zones were already engulfed in the flames of war.

If the Starlight Fortress were to get isolated now, Zero Wing would definitely suffer immeasurable consequences. After all, due to the Outerworld forces occupying many of the eastern continent’s resource spots, prices of various resources had more than doubled.

If Zero Wing were to lose the resources from the Starlight Fortress, the Guild would most likely struggle to defend its Guild Cities. In this situation, Fithalia herself was powerless to do anything. Even if Divine Tribe were willing to help Zero Wing with all of its strength, there was no way Divine Tribe could win against a force of over a hundred Tier 4 NPCs.

Eventually, Fithalia sighed and said, “I understand. I’ll convey your words to Zero Wing.”

“Good, then.” Nodding, Brut said indifferently, “However, our patience is limited. Tell Zero Wing that they only have one day to reply. If they don’t give us an answer by then, we will begin sealing the map immediately!” “One day?” Fithalia frowned.

This was too short. It was barely enough time for her to convey the message and for Zero Wing to hold a short discussion among its executives. Zero Wing wouldn’t have any time to make the necessary preparations at all. “That’s right. Only one day. Zero Wing had best not waste any time! That wouldn’t be beneficial to the Blood Alliance or Zero Wing!” Brut said in a determined tone. “I can even tell Zero Wing now that if they refuse our offer, while it might give the Blood Alliance some trouble, I can guarantee that they will suffer 100 times more than us!”

After Brut finished speaking, the Tier 4 NPCs standing behind him promptly unleashed their

auras.

The combined aura of over a dozen Tier 4 NPCs pressured even Fithalia. If not for the buff from standing inside the Starlight Fortress, she might’ve even succumbed to this mighty aura and stumbled back.

As for the other Divine Tribe members, their complexions had paled. It was evident that they felt very uncomfortable beneath this frightening aura.

However, just as Fithalia was about to speak up, a calm and deep voice suddenly entered everyone’s ears.

“A partnership won’t be necessary. Zero Wing doesn’t need allies like you bunch.”

At this voice of rejection, everyone present turned reflexively toward its origin, curious to see who would be so bold as to decide for Zero Wing.

“Who said that? Come out!”

Brute, in particular, reacted with anger and displeasure. He never thought that someone would dare openly challenge the Blood Alliance.

“Black Flame?”

“Zero Wing’s Guild Leader has arrived already?”

When everyone present saw the cloaked man approaching Fithalia and Brut, they quickly recognized him, based on the two longswords hanging by his waist, as well as his dark and determined eyes.

“Guild Leader Black Flame?”

Fithalia was stunned when she saw Shi Feng.

This was because Shi Feng’s present self was completely different from when she last met him. Not only did his body radiate frighteningly dense Mana right now, but she could also sense a difference in Life Rating between them!

“Half-step Tier 5?!” When the elderly Level 167, Tier 4 NPC at the head of the Blood Alliance’s group saw Shi Feng, he gasped in shock.

“Half-step Tier 5? How is this possible?”

When the surrounding players overheard the elderly NPC’s words, they similarly gaped at Shi Feng with astonished gazes.

Nowadays, Tier 4 players were no longer as rare as before. Hence, most Tier 3 players in God’s Domain no longer found Tier 4 players foreign. At the same time, they also knew just how difficult it was to get promoted from Tier 4 to Tier 5, as well as how wide the gulf between Tier 4 and Tier 5 existences was.

Meanwhile, a Half-step Tier 5 existence referred to Tier 4 individuals who had achieved an incredibly high standard in their control over Mana and their Mana Body. After reaching this stage, so long as a Tier 4 individual successfully constructed a sufficiently strong Mana Body for themself, they would become a Tier 5 existence—an existence even NPC empires feared greatly.

Yet, in an era where mainstream players had just reached Tier 3 and only an extremely small number of experts had reached Tier 4, they were now being told that Shi Feng had already reached the Half-step Tier 5 standard. No matter how they thought about it, this didn’t seem plausible.

However, as a Tier 4 NPC had said these words, they were unlikely to be false.

“I said that. What kind of guidance do you have for me, I wonder, Guild Leader Brut?” Shi Feng asked calmly as he stared at Brut.
