Chapter 2765 – God Slayer’s Legacy

After a brief silence inside the cave, a deep, emotional voice entered Shi Feng’s ears.

“You had best not ask or think about what happened in the past and what caused the deaths of so many of the world’s powerful people and even Gods. You also must not look into these matters.

“The consequences of doing so are not something even heaven-blessed individuals like yourselves can bear. You might even lose your minds as a result,” the old man warned when he saw the curiosity on the faces of Shi Feng and the others.

Although the old man’s voice did not carry any mental influence or coercion, the certainty in his tone made Shi Feng shudder involuntarily.

As for Lifeless Thorn, Solitary Nine, Yan Ya, and Cleansing Whistle, although they reacted fearfully to the old man’s warning, the curiosity on their faces was clear for all to see. It was evident that they did not take the old man’s words seriously.

After all, this was a matter related to Gods.

Players who were new to God’s Domain treated the word “God” as merely a noun. At best, Gods were a type of powerful monster to them. However, those who truly ventured around God’s Domain and studied the historical materials in the libraries of the various kingdoms and empires would realize that Gods weren’t just powerful existences. Simultaneously, they represented a kind of extreme, a road leading to the top of God’s Domain.

Hence, anything related to Gods represented a massive opportunity for players.

This was especially true for Tier 3 players like themselves. They were quite aware that they could no longer advance on their own. If they wished to get to the next level, they would have to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors. Meanwhile, the footsteps of Gods were undoubtedly the best to follow. “None of you should look deeper into this matter, at least not now,” Shi Feng suddenly said to Lifeless Thorn and the others.

He knew very well how attractive Gods were to Tier 3 experts. They wouldn’t hesitate to look into matters related to Gods, even if the risks were big. After all, the road to promotion was simply too difficult.

Normally, players could already improve significantly with the ruins left behind by Tier 5 existences, let alone those of Tier 6 Gods.

However, the disappearance of some peak experts and apex experts from both the game world and the real world most likely had something to do with Tier 6 Gods. Anyone who tried to get involved with Tier 6 Gods as Tier 3 and Tier 4 players would die before achieving anything. If they were lucky, they would have their accounts destroyed and need to start all over again. If they were unlucky, they might disappear like those experts in the past.

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Lifeless Thorn and the others eyed him curiously. They never thought that Shi Feng would actively stop them from looking into this matter.

“It seems you know your limits, kid,” the old man said, gazing at Shi Feng with warm approval. “That’s right. Only people who know the limits of their strength and abilities can live long lives. Even you heaven-blessed individuals are no exception.”

At the old man’s words, Lifeless Thorn and the others promptly awakened from their greed.

“Thanks, Commander. I never thought I would get seduced by the benefits in front of me,” Lifeless Thorn said in gratitude, a hint of fear in his voice.

God’s Domain had always emphasized balance. All gains came with losses. If one tried to secure an opportunity despite lacking the necessary strength, they would only wind up dead. Currently, they hadn’t even reached Tier 4, yet they were actually thinking of looking into the secrets of Tier 6. That was simply suicide.

“That is normal. After all, not many people in God’s Domain can remain calm when faced with matters related to Gods,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. If not for him having a wealth of experience adventuring in God’s Domain, he wouldn’t have fared any better than Lifeless Thorn. In fact, he might’ve reacted even more crazily.

In the current era where the Gods had withdrawn from the world, even the various superpowers would go nuts over a clue related to Tier 6 Gods. In fact, even Tier 5 NPCs would fight desperately to secure this clue. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Alright, that’s enough talking.” After seeing that Shi Feng and the others had calmed down, the old man beckoned to them and said, “Come here. Next up is the moment you have all been waiting for. It is also the final wealth and treasure that person left behind for you heaven-blessed individuals.”

A treasure left behind by the God Slayer? Shi Feng grew a little excited at the old man’s words.

The God Slayer was a mythical figure in God’s Domain. Although it wasn’t certain whether the God Slayer had become a God or not, it was certain that he was born a human. Meanwhile, the God Slayer was an existence that even Gods feared. In fact, the number of Gods the God Slayer had slain exceeded ten. However, for reasons unknown, the God Slayer had suddenly vanished into God’s Domain’s history, leaving behind only a few clues pertaining to his existence.

Normally, these clues were acquired from ancient ruins. It was almost impossible to find any records of the God Slayer in the various kingdoms’ and empires’ libraries, as if the God Slayer’s existence had been wiped out by history. Future generations couldn’t look into the God Slayer’s existence, even if they wanted to.

However, there were a lot of negative comments about the God Slayer. Some people said that the God Slayer was a great sinner of God’s Domain, and others said that the God Slayer was the culprit behind the Twilight of the Gods.

Shortly afterward, the old man led Shi Feng’s group of five to the cavern’s center, where the dozen or so frozen Gods stood.

Upon arriving there, Shi Feng and the others noticed a space-time crack there, as small as a fingernail, undetectable from a distance. Only after moving within 30 yards of the crack did they barely notice it.

Directly underneath this space-time crack was an incomparably complicated magic array. It was so complicated that even Shi Feng, who was an Advanced Magician, felt dizzy after just one glance at it. Needless to say, he couldn’t even begin to decipher it.

“This is the treasure?” Solitary Nine was stunned when he saw this tiny space-time crack. For a moment, he even felt that the old man had duped them.

What possible use could they have for a fingernail-sized space-time crack?

Even if this space-time crack led to somewhere, with how small it was, players couldn’t enter it.

“That’s right. This is the treasure,” the old man said, chuckling. “You might think that such a small space-time crack is no big deal, but what if I say that it connects to the past?” “Connects to the past?” Solitary Nine was again stunned.

Crossing timelines was simply impossible. It should still be impossible even in a virtual reality game like God’s Domain.

“Esteemed Elder, are you perhaps saying that this space-time crack can allow us to travel to an Otherworld?” Lifeless Thorn asked, thinking that the old man did not understand what the words “connects to the past” meant.

In fact, even Shi Feng suspected that what the old man truly meant was that the space-time crack allowed people to travel to a different space. After all, there were plenty of foreign spaces and Otherworlds in God’s Domain.

“No, it is really linked to the past. It isn’t linked to an Otherworld or a different space,” the old man insisted, shaking his head. He could tell what Shi Feng and the others were thinking, and he said in a determined tone, “I know you don’t believe me. There is no way you can believe me, either. After all, time travel is something even Ancient Gods are incapable of accomplishing. However, it is true.

“Moreover, this space-time crack is connected to the ancient era of God’s Domain!”

The old man’s words dumbfounded everyone present.

Connected to the ancient era of God’s Domain? Shi Feng felt his worldview crumbling, shocked beyond words. Could this be the Earthfall Secret Land’s true secret?

The ancient era of God’s Domain was an era of wonders. Various super-civilizations were intertwined during this era when Gods still roamed the world. And because the Twilight of the Gods had yet to occur, the world of God’s Domain was incredibly rich in resources. The present era of God’s Domain couldn’t hold a candle to the ancient era in this regard.

“I won’t say anything more. Since this is your first time, you can enter it without any cost. However, you can only spend a limited amount of time inside. Moreover, the stronger you become and the greater your impact during the ancient era, the easier it will be for the world to notice your presence. If that happens, the world will reject your existence and expel you. What you can obtain during the ancient era will all depend on your own abilities,” the old man said slowly. “However, I have to warn you that the ancient era is not the paradise you imagine it to be! You will die a permanent death if you aren’t careful!”

Before Shi Feng and his companions could ask any questions, the old man waved his hand. Immediately, Shi Feng and the other four transformed into streaks of light that plunged into the space-time crack, disappearing from the cavern.
