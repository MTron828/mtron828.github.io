Chapter 360 – Miniature Ancient World’s Number One!

Along with Platinum Behemoth’s death, the room became deathly silent yet again.

Platinum Behemoth got killed?

I must be dreaming. That’s Platinum Behemoth, for crying out loud. How can he get killed in one hit?

How did he kill Platinum Behemoth in one hit? Does he have Legendary Equipment?

!!

The people in the room couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw Platinum Behemoth getting killed. Platinum Behemoth might not have any fame in the Miniature Ancient World and wasn’t even listed on the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s God List, but he was incredibly well-known in the Starlight Realm.

It all started when Platinum Behemoth participated in the Paimon Conglomerate’s invitational competition 40 years ago. During the competition, Platinum Behemoth defeated many geniuses and paragons to win an invitation from the Paimon Conglomerate. Afterward, he got recruited by the Paimon Conglomerate and joined the Divine Seal Legion after getting promoted to Tier 6.

Currently, although Platinum Behemoth was no longer part of the Divine Seal Legion due to his growing age, the fact that the Divine Seal Saint had entrusted Dira’s safety to him showed just how much faith the Divine Seal Saint had put in his strength.

It was true that players could get resurrected from death in God’s Domain. However, if a player’s Immortal Soul got extinguished completely, it would be the end of their career in God’s Domain. It would be extraordinarily difficult for them to set foot into God’s Domain again in their lifetime.

God’s Domain was a place with countless opportunities. Whether a person was looking to improve their mental strength, extend their lifespan, or seek status and wealth, the best way to do so would be to enter and grow in God’s Domain.

While players might not have the ability to completely extinguish Immortal Souls at Tier 3 and Tier 4, they would gain the ability to do so at Tier 5 and Tier 6. Although the various kingdoms and countries had created rules forbidding higher-tier players from attacking lower-tier players, the Divine Seal Saint naturally wouldn’t trust such rules to ensure his son’s safety. Hence, he had tasked Tier 6 experts to become Dira’s bodyguards.

Only, due to Dira entering the Miniature Ancient World’s restrictions, Tier 6 experts such as Platinum Beast had no choice but to lower their tiers to follow him.

Legendary Equipment?

When Trecht looked at Shi Feng again, he suddenly felt immense pressure coming from the other party.

It should be known that Platinum Behemoth was currently equipped with two or three pieces of Fragmented Legendary Equipment and one Fragmented Legendary Weapon. Logically, it should be impossible for another Tier 4 player to kill him in one hit. The only explanation for this unbelievable situation was that Shi Feng was in possession of a piece of Legendary Equipment, which gave him a massive advantage in Basic Attributes over Platinum Behemoth.

How does he have Legendary Equipment?

In Meteor’s case, he couldn’t help but grow envious and confused as he looked at Shi Feng. After all, this was the Miniature Ancient World they were talking about. Thus far, even the Paimon Conglomerate had only managed to secure a few clues pertaining to Legendary Equipment right now, and it would take at least another two or three months before the conglomerate could actually get its hands on any Legendary Equipment. So, how did Shi Feng get his hands on one so soon?

It should be known that for experts of their caliber, obtaining a piece of Legendary Equipment at this point in time would instantly make them the strongest expert in the Miniature Ancient World. Once they entered the Greater God’s Domain, the Legendary Equipment would also be of great help to their growth.

While everyone was feeling envious over Shi Feng’s ownership of a piece of Legendary Equipment, Flanders looked at the situation with a grim expression.

It’s truly over now… Flanders thought, his heart growing cold when he saw Shi Feng killing Platinum Behemoth.

Flanders was more or less acquainted with Shi Feng, so he was very optimistic about the other party’s future. However, as the Vice Guild Leader of the Tower Alliance, Flanders knew just how frightening the Greater World’s conglomerates could be when provoked.

Even if they were currently in the Miniature Ancient World, having a piece of Legendary Equipment wouldn’t be enough for Shi Feng to go up against Dira’s guards. Shi Feng’s act of killing Platinum Behemoth wouldn’t deter Dira, either. On the contrary, all Shi Feng had done was further anger Dira.

“Legendary Equipment?” When Dira saw Platinum Behemoth getting killed, not only did he not react in panic, but he even revealed a smile. “So this is why you have refused my offer so confidently. It just so happens that I’m in need of Legendary Equipment, so I’ll be borrowing yours for the time being!”

After saying so, Dira turned to the three remaining Beast Warriors behind him and said, “I want him alive. I will take my time playing with him once we return to the Greater God’s Domain.”

“Understood!”

Upon receiving Dira’s command, the three remaining Beast Warriors each took out a purple-gold potion and drank it. Immediately afterward, their auras exploded, and their Life Ratings underwent a qualitative transformation. If someone were to use an Advanced Identification Skill on the three right now, they would find that the three Beast Warriors were no longer Tier 4 players but bona fide Tier 5 players instead.

A Level 137, Tier 5 Grand Wizard!

A Level 136, Tier 5 Sacred Sky Knight!

A Level 136, Tier 5 Brilliant Cleric Saint!

“This is…! Life Transition! A Lost Potion! Moreover, three of them?!”

“The legendary potion that’s rumored to be able to promote its user by one tier!”

The peanut gallery gasped when they saw the display of wealth before them. None of them had expected to see the rumored Life Transition Potion in the Miniature Ancient World. They also didn’t expect the Paimon Conglomerate to give each of the Four Beast Warriors a bottle.

Thousand Scars, in particular, gaped in shock at this scene.

The Life Transition Potion!

Thousand Scars had only ever seen the Life Transition Potion in ancient texts. Meanwhile, from what she read, the potion could forcibly increase a player’s tier by one, up to a maximum of Tier 5. However, unlike other potions, the Life Transition Potion’s effects were permanent.

The Life Transition Potion was basically a free pass for players to get promoted. They wouldn’t need to try to improve their Mana Body or create their own Mana Body. If players consumed the potion to reach Tier 3, they would automatically receive a Gold Mana Body based on the available templates. If consumed to reach Tier 5, players would be given a tailor-made Tier 5 Mana Body that reached the Gold standard. For players incapable of securing a high-ranking Mana Body, the Life Transition Potion was something they dreamed of obtaining.

Because of the Life Transition Potions benefits, the value of one bottle was equivalent to one piece of Legendary Equipment.

Yet, now, three Life Transition Potions were used in the blink of an eye…

Meanwhile, when Midsummer, Wu Xiaoxiao, and Jun Luosha saw this unexpected development, they couldn’t help but grow a little flustered. They never thought the Paimon Conglomerate would have such a trump card prepared.

Compared to Tier 4 players with Tier 5 strength, real Tier 5 players not only possessed Tier 5 Basic Attributes and Physique but also Tier 5 Skills and Spells. At the same time, Tier 5 players would also gain greater effects from their weapons and equipment than Tier 4 players due to them having higher base values for their Basic Attributes.

Usually, the base values of a Tier 5 player would be twice as high as a Tier 4 player. In other words, if the base values of a Tier 4 player’s Basic Attributes were uniformly at 1,000, the base values of a Tier 5 player’s Basic Attributes would be at 2,000.

In this situation, if these two players were to put on a piece of equipment that offered a 100% bonus to Basic Attributes, the Tier 4 player’s Basic Attributes would go from 1,000 to 2,000, while the Tier 5 player’s Basic Attributes would go from 2,000 to 4,000. In the blink of an eye, the initial difference of 1,000 points had turned into a difference of 2,000 points. Needless to say, the difference in Basic Attributes between Tier 4 and Tier 5 players would only increase even further as more percentage-based bonuses were added into the calculation. This was why it was incredibly difficult for players to transcend tiers.

It might be commonly known that Tier 4 players could transcend tiers if they had a piece of Legendary Equipment equipped, but that was only enough for them to hold their ground against a Tier 5 player. It wasn’t enough for them to defeat a Tier 5 player. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Shi Feng might possess powerful Basic Attributes, but even he would be powerless against three Tier 5 players on the Four Beast Warriors’ standard.

“You’ve been quite arrogant just now, kid,” the Tier 5 Sacred Sky Knight said, sneering as he walked up to Shi Feng. “How about showing that arrogance to us again?”
