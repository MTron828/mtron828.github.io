Chapter 282 - Dark Wind

The War God’s Temple, an organization that was founded shortly after the Great Destruction, had been in existence for thousands of years now, protecting the human race from invasions by foreign races.

Now that the Endless Abyss had been opened, the humans of God’s Domain would have to rely on the War God’s Temple to deal with the invasion of Demonic Beasts. It was no longer a situation that could be handled by any single country.

Aside from being the protector of the human race, the War God’s Temple was also a location for players to learn advanced skills. Meanwhile, players only needed to complete the quests they received at the War God’s Temple in order to do so.

Shortly after Shi Feng arrived at the War God’s Temple, he reported the Endless Abyss to the Knight Captain on duty.

The War God’s Temple was considered one of the most powerful forces in God’s Domain. Just a normal Knight here was already a Level 180 Tier 2 NPC. As for the Knight Captain, he was a Level 200 Tier 3 NPC.

The Knight Captain revealed an anxious expression after hearing Shi Feng’s report. “Your Excellency Black Flame, this matter is of utmost importance. However, as I’ll need to immediately send out warnings to all cities throughout the kingdom and also muster troops to the frontlines, I’ll have to trouble you to head to the War God’s Temple in the capital city and report this matter to Lord Ucarus and seek his aid.” The Knight Captain passed a gold token to Shi Feng, then promptly headed out of the temple, not giving Shi Feng any chance to even refuse.

Shi Feng was left speechless by the Knight Captain’s words.

Fortunately, he only needed to head to the capital city and look for the person named Ucarus, an easy task to accomplish.

Following which, Shi Feng left the War God’s Temple and hurried over to White River City’s Teleportation Hall.

Just as Shi Feng was about to enter the Teleportation Hall, however, six robust-looking players stood in front of the stone staircase, completely blocking the entryway.

These six players were all Level 18; such a level could definitely be ranked at the very top of White River City. Moreover, the equipment these players wore were of excellent quality, majority of which were of Secret-Silver rank. Meanwhile, the solemn-looking middle-aged man who looked like the leader of this party of players had the best equipment out of these six players. He was actually fully equipped with Secret-Silver Equipment. His gaze was like a sharp blade, and his entire body exuded such an icy-cold aura that other players unconsciously detoured as they walked past him.

Although Shi Feng had never fought against these six players before, he could clearly tell that they were very strong. There were very few parties of their caliber in White River City.

Meanwhile, pinned to the chests of these players were black six-pointed stars. This black star was none other than Dark Star’s Guild Emblem. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What can I do for you?” Shi Feng asked.

“You’re Black Flame, right? I am Ming Sha of Underworld. I am here to give you a piece of good news,” the middle-aged man said in a condescending tone.

Although Black Flame had been titled as the Chief Forger of Star-Moon Kingdom, in Ming Sha’s eyes, he was merely a clown prancing on the stage.

Whether it was in reality or in God’s Domain, only strength truly mattered.

A forger that only knew how to stay hidden inside a room was nothing more than a tool for strong players like them.

If not for the matter of the Guild Residence astonishing the upper echelons of Underworld, Ming Sha would not even be here trying to make contact with Black Flame.

Instead of Black Flame, the person Ming Sha was interested in was Ye Feng, the player widely acclaimed a God-ranked Swordsman. Ming Sha really wished to meet him. Moreover, Young Master Feng had also given orders to get rid of that Ye Feng and obtain the Epic ranked item in Shi Feng’s hands.

Unfortunately, Ye Feng proved simply too elusive. No matter how many men Ming Sha had sent out, they still could not find a trace of that Ye Feng. Ming Sha was very disappointed by such a result, as he never imagined that Ye Feng would be such a coward, not having the courage to even come out and fight.

“Good news? Then why do I feel that you guys are coming with bad intentions in hand?” Shi Feng revealed an indifferent smile as he sent a glance at the other five menacing players.

“Master Black Flame, it is our fault for behaving too rashly. However, we truly do have great news for you. Only, I hope that you can take a trip with us. After all, this place isn’t exactly suitable for discussions of such an important matter.”

At this moment, another person walked up from behind the six players. This person was similarly a middle-aged man. Currently, this man had a wide smile on his honest-looking face. When Shi Feng used Observing Eyes on this man, he discovered that this man was actually called South Wolf. Immediately, Shi Feng came to a realization.

The road for enemies truly is narrow. Shi Feng inwardly chuckled.

South Wolf was none other than the person that tried to threaten Shi Feng into surrendering his Ice-Blue Devil Flame. After being rejected, South Wolf had even declared that he would take action against Shi Feng. Originally, Shi Feng had intended to take a look at just how powerful the organization known as Underworld was. Unfortunately, this matter had been quelled by Gentle Snow. Shi Feng never thought he would meet this fellow once again today.

“What if I don’t want to go?” Shi Feng asked.

“We have long since thought of this point; hence I asked Brother Ming Sha and his friends to come and personally invite Master Black Flame over,” South Wolf said with a hypocritical smile, sending a glance at the six Underworld Guards beside him.

“Alright, then, since you guys are being so sincere.” Shi Feng nodded.

South Wolf had obviously already familiarized himself with the rules of White River City. Although the rules stated that battles were not allowed within the city limits, that was on the premise that actual damage was caused. There would be no problems if they simply dragged him away.

Of course, Shi Feng’s Strength Attribute was extremely high. South Wolf’s group had absolutely no chance of abducting him.

Just recently, he had obtained 40 Free Attribute Points as a reward for releasing the Forgotten Lands. Although Shi Feng had added 30 of those points into Intelligence, in order to equip the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath even a little earlier, he had placed the remaining 10 into Strength. Aside from that, due to the Abyssal Blade’s Attributes, Shi Feng obtained two additional Free Attribute Points every time he leveled up. When coupling those with the Strength provided by his other equipment, Shi Feng’s Strength Attribute had long since broken through the 170-point threshold. In terms of the Strength Attribute, very few players throughout God’s Domain could be a match for him.

However, it seemed that someone from the mysterious upper echelon of Underworld wanted to meet him, and Shi Feng was curious enough to agree.

“Let us go, then,” South Wolf said as he led the way.

A short while later, Shi Feng and the others arrived inside a high-class bar. Very few average players could be seen inside this bar, as most could not afford this luxurious place.

“Master Black Flame, please, come in. Young Master Feng has been waiting for you for a long time now.” South Wolf pushed apart the doors to a private room, hinting that Shi Feng should enter.

Upon entering the private room, Shi Feng immediately discovered an imposing yet charming youth sitting inside. This youth was also accompanied by two beautiful female companions at his sides. These two beauties were not players but NPCs. Just like how Anna was working as Shi Feng’s assistant at the Starstreak Trading Firm, these beauties were clearly servants of this young man. This sight was far more shocking than if he had two attractive female players accompanying him.

At this stage of the game, having the ability to possess two NPC servants showed that this youth before him was definitely out of the ordinary.

“You are in the upper echelon of Underworld?” Shi Feng asked.

“That’s right. This one here is known as Feng Xuanyang, the Vice-Leader of Underworld’s Star-Moon Kingdom Eastern Branch. Of course, you can also call me by my character name, Dark Wind.” Feng Xuanyang introduced himself.

“I wonder, what business does Vice-Leader Feng have with me?” Shi Feng asked.

Judging from Feng Xuanyang’s tone, Shi Feng had already made a rough guess as to Underworld’s strength. Although he had long since deduced that Underworld had a great deal of power and that their influence covered more than just a single kingdom, Shi Feng still could not help but feel shocked after having his conclusions confirmed. It was no wonder even that Gentle Snow was wary of them.

Star-Moon Kingdom could be categorized into five separate regions: north, south, east, west, and center. White River City was located in the east side. Meanwhile, Feng Xuanyang was in charge of managing the affairs of Underworld’s Star-Moon Kingdom Eastern Branch. The authority he wielded was definitely great.

“I heard that Master Black Flame is the founder of Zero Wing. You have even managed to elevate Zero Wing to its current position. We at Underworld feel very optimistic about Zero Wing’s future; hence we wish to invest in some shares.” Feng Xuanyang then pointed towards Ming Sha, who was currently standing by the door, saying, “You’ve already seen for yourself the strength of Underworld. Because of us, even the previously insignificant third-rate Guild Dark Star has instantly become a powerhouse in White River City. If Master Black Flame is willing, Underworld can similarly make Zero Wing grow rapidly. Not only could you become the overlord of White River City, you could even become the number one Guild in the entire eastern region of Star-Moon Kingdom.

“I wonder if Master Black Flame might be interested?”
