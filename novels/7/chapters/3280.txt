Chapter 355 – Asura Returns

Jun Luosha wasn’t the only one wondering about Shi Feng’s identity after seeing Saint Nine’s respectful attitude toward Shi Feng. Everyone present was in the same situation.

After all, they were talking about the tenth-ranked player on the Miniature Ancient World’s God List here!

Saint Nine was a powerhouse whom the Miniature Ancient World’s various hegemonic powers had to think twice about offending. This was true even for the various corporations’ successors. One could see this point clearly through Calgaron’s attitude.

Calgaron was the First Successor of the Divine Will Corporation. In addition, he was a titled expert and the commander of the hegemonic power Drifters’ third trump card legion. Before coming to the Miniature Ancient World, he was even an expert who had already gotten promoted to Tier 6. He only restarted his progress because of the World Passage’s opening rewards.

!!

Yet, even a high-status person like Calgaron had chosen to humble himself in front of Saint Nine.

Although Saint Nine had never gone beyond Tier 4 in either the Miniature Ancient World or the Greater God’s Domain, should he join a hegemonic power, he would be given the treatment of a Vice Guild Leader, no questions asked. He would even be given a seat among the hegemonic power’s Board of Directors and made a potential candidate for the Guild Leader or Grand Elder position.

With Saint Nine’s current strength, the only people who could possibly get Saint Nine to behave respectfully to them would be the Guild Leader of a hegemonic power or the helmsman of a corporation. Everyone else was unworthy of his respect. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, even the various hegemonic powers’ Vice Guild Leaders would rarely be willing to enter the Miniature Ancient World, let alone Guild Leaders. As for the various corporations’ helmsmen, there was no way such big shots would sacrifice their progress and enter the Miniature Ancient World.

So, everyone found it hard to imagine how anyone could get a paragon like Saint Nine to behave so respectfully.

Does this person have an incredible origin?

Franz’s jaw dropped when he saw Saint Nine suddenly taking such a respectful attitude toward Shi Feng.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Saint Nine was strong enough to defy the successor of any corporation in the Miniature Ancient World. Most of the hegemonic powers in the Miniature Ancient World wouldn’t even dare to make an enemy out of him.

Franz had taken a moment to observe Shi Feng previously, and the other party could be said to be very normal. He couldn’t feel the presence of a powerhouse from Shi Feng at all. Not to mention, Shi Feng was mingling with Jun Luosha’s junior sister.

Wu Xiaoxiao might be Jun Luosha’s junior sister, but she was nothing more than an internal genius nurtured by the Green God Corporation. She was vastly inferior to Jun Luosha, who had already entered Green God Corporation’s core circle. The two couldn’t even be compared on the same level.

In Franz’s opinion, someone considered “very strong” in Wu Xiaoxiao’s mind would, at most, be at the standard of the average fourth-floor expert. This was also usually the limit of experts originating from isolated God’s Domains.

However, after seeing Saint Nine’s respectful attitude, Franz felt that Shi Feng might be the son of an upper-ranking hegemonic power’s Guild Leader. Either that or the son of a conglomerate’s executive.

There might only be a one-rank difference between ordinary hegemonic powers and upper-ranking hegemonic powers in the Greater God’s Domain, but the two were worlds apart from each other in reality. If Shi Feng was the son of an upper-ranking hegemonic power’s Guild Leader, even the Guild Leaders of ordinary hegemonic powers would try to fawn over him, let alone Saint Nine.

A World Passage’s opening was a huge opportunity for most players. So, it wasn’t out of the question for the children of an upper-ranking hegemonic power’s Guild Leader or the children of a conglomerate’s executive to enter the miniature Ancient World.

While everyone was secretly speculating on Shi Feng’s identity, Wu Xiaoxiao smiled at Jun Luosha and said, “Black Flame! He is Zero Wing’s Guild Leader Black Flame!”

The few simple words that came out of Wu Xiaoxiao’s mouth instantly shocked and confused Jun Luosha.

“Black Flame? The God List’s seventh-ranked Asura Sword Emperor? How is this possible?”

Jun Luosha wasn’t foreign to the name of Black Flame. After all, Black Flame’s name was already known by all in the Miniature Ancient World at this point.

But even if they were talking about Black Flame, Jun Luosha found it hard to believe Saint Nine would take on such a respectful attitude toward the Asura Sword Emperor.

It should be known that the God-ranked Expert Ranking List was the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s subjective ranking. It wasn’t an actual ranking of combat power. Moreover, even if Black Flame was stronger than Saint Nine, the difference in strength should be very limited.

Jun Lusoha wasn’t the only one confused at this time. Many of the people who had overheard Wu Xiaoxiao’s words similarly found this revelation to be puzzling.

“What a surprise this is! I didn’t think that cloaked Swordsman would be that rumored Asura Sword Emperor!”

“But this is strange. Even if Saint Nine knows that guy is the Asura Sword Emperor, does Saint Nine need to behave so respectfully? After all, they are paragons of the same caliber.”

“Saint Nine is probably thinking of befriending the Asura Sword Emperor. After all, the World Passage will be opening soon. There’s no harm in having an extra ally.”

…

At this point, the only explanation everyone could think of for Saint Nine to behave so respectfully to Black Flame was because Saint Nine was thinking of joining forces with the Asura Sword Emperor to tackle the World Passage’s opening. After all, countless experts and powers would gather for the World Passage’s opening. At that time, even a paragon of Saint Nine’s caliber would be limited in what he could accomplish if he were by himself.

However, it was a different story if Saint Nine could join forces with Black Flame. Not only was the Asura Sword Emperor one of the God List’s top 10 experts, but he was also closely affiliated with the Glimmering Sword, another of the top 10 experts on the God List. If three of the God List’s top 10 experts worked together, they would become a formidable force even in the World Passage.

…

While everyone was busy speculating Saint Nine’s motives, Shi Feng looked at Saint Nine and nonchalantly said, “I’ll pass on the drink, but it seems you have learned quite the incredible Identification Skill if you can see through my Black Cloak’s effects.”

Basic Identification Skills were useless against the Black Cloak’s concealment effect. In fact, some Advanced Identification Skills couldn’t see through the Black Cloak’s effects. It was no exaggeration to say that Identification Skills capable of seeing through the Black Cloak’s effects were incredibly rare. It was for this reason the Black Cloak had become the first choice for experts and Dark Players wanting to hide their information.

“You overpraise me, Mr. Black Flame,” Saint Nine said respectfully. “It is only an insignificant Skill.”

“I wouldn’t call it an insignificant Skill,” Shi Feng said, smiling as he looked at the divine runes marking Saint Nine’s eyes. “The Magic Eyes of Time have the effect of Master Identification Skills. Very few people have them, even among the various hegemonic powers.”

Saint Nine wasn’t surprised that Shi Feng had seen through his Magic Eyes of Time. Instead, he started to respect Shi Feng even more.

Done with the pleasantries, Shi Feng got straight to the point and calmly said, “The Tower Alliance is partnered with Zero Wing, so let’s end this matter here.”

“If that is what you want, I naturally don’t have any problems with it, Mr. Black Flame,” Saint Nine said, nodding. He showed no intention of going against Shi Feng’s decision at all.

Meanwhile, Saint Nine’s respectful and accommodating behavior caused everyone’s jaws to drop. No matter how they looked at it, this wasn’t a conversation between equals. The tone Shi Feng took didn’t sound like he was making a suggestion at all. Instead, it sounded like he was giving a command.

Yet, Saint Nine had chosen to follow Shi Feng’s command without question for some inexplicable reason.

For a time, everyone wondered if the Saint Nine they were looking at was even the same person who had just heavily injured the Silver-eyed Witch Favra in one hit.

“Lord Saint Nine? This is different from what we disc—”

When Calgaron heard Saint Nine’s words, he couldn’t help but want to say something about Saint Nine’s decision. However, he promptly shut up when he received a glare from Saint Nine. This was because Saint Nine’s glare gave him the feeling that should he speak another word, Saint Nine would kill him on the spot. It wasn’t until Shi Feng left into the distance that Calgaron finally found the courage to speak again. Even so, he still chose to speak in a whisper:

“Are we really going to let the Desolate Star Corporation go so easily, Lord Saint Nine?”

Calgaron was very confused by Saint Nine’s behavior. This was the perfect opportunity to deal a heavy blow to the Desolate Star Corporation. If they let this opportunity get away, it’d be difficult to find another opportunity like this in the future.

“Since Mr. Black Flame has already said so, then this matter will end here,” Saint Nine sternly said as he glanced at Calgaron. “If you don’t plan on giving up, don’t say I didn’t warn you if you and your men get annihilated.”

“I don’t understand, Lord Saint Nine. Black Flame might be ranked seventh on the God List, but with your current strength, is there a need for you to humble yourself so much in front of him?” Calgaron asked in confusion.

Calgaron had a good understanding of Saint Nine’s personality. If given the opportunity, he’d fight the God List’s top 3 experts on the spot without hesitation.

Respect?

That was nothing but a joke!

“I wouldn’t even spare him a second glance if he truly was only seventh on the God List,” Saint Nine said as he looked at Calgaron. Then, he turned to look at Shi Feng’s departing figure and continued respectfully, “But he isn’t just the God List’s seventh-ranked player! He is also the Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon, someone who has won against both Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac!”

“What? He won against the Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac?”

Calgaron gasped when he heard Saint Nine’s words, his mind subconsciously thinking that Saint Nine was playing a joke on him.
