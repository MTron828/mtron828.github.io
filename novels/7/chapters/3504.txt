Chapter 579 – Soul Blood

“What dense Eternal Energy!”

“Incredible! The Eternal Energy gathered here is already denser than when we defeated the Final Boss of that Hell Mode Team Dungeon!”

Sky Pivot and the other original members of the Dawnlight Party promptly lost their calm when they sensed the change in their surrounding environment.

“Is that really the case, Leader? Has the loot of this Regional Boss gathered denser Eternal Energy than a Hell Mode Team Dungeon’s Final Boss?” Billowing Water asked out of curiosity. She wasn’t aware of the Western Continent’s loot situation, so she didn’t share the same reaction as Sky Pivot and the others.

!!

In God’s Domain, the higher the quality of an item, the more mana it could attract from the surroundings. But judging by the reactions of Sky Pivot and the others, although the Half-Snakekin General’s loot had also attracted a lot of mana, the standard of judging an item’s quality was evidently based on the Eternal Energy the item attracted.

“It is much denser,” Sky Pivot said, nodding.

“Our party previously collaborated with a couple of other parties to raid a Hell Mode Team Dungeon, but the Final Boss’s loot only doubled the density of the surrounding Eternal Energy. The affected area was also only limited to a 10-yard radius,” Moon Bamboo explained. “But as you can see, these items have increased the surrounding Eternal Energy’s density by several times. If not for the magic barrier we’ve set up, the area they can influence might even increase to a radius of several hundred yards. Essentially, we’ve struck gold this time!”

“Indeed!” Looking at the eleven items on the ground, Budding Leaf sighed ruefully and said, “When we participated in the joint dungeon raid, a total of eight noteworthy items dropped, and our party only received two. Our party even lost two members during the raid. Even so, we still ended up profiting significantly. But what we got from that raid is nothing compared to our current harvest.”

The Dawnlight Party had obtained two valuable items from the Hell Mode Team Dungeon they raided. Of them, one was a Bronze Mana Purification Technique, while the other was a Combat-ranked Secret Treasure.

The Bronze Purification Technique was given to Moon Bamboo, the vice party leader of the team, while the Combat-ranked Secret Treasure was given to Sky Pivot. After receiving their respective treasures, both Moon Bamboo and Sky Pivot saw a significant increase in strength. Even after accounting for the loss of their two party members, the Dawnlight Party’s overall strength still increased significantly, allowing the party to retain its status in Seven Luminaries Town.

“Enough talking. The barrier might be able to prevent the Holy Race players outside from detecting us, but some of them might have Scouting Skills that can see through the barrier’s concealment. Let’s quickly appraise these items before trouble finds us,” Sky Pivot urged.

Moon Bamboo nodded and promptly began to use her Identification Skill to appraise the eleven items.

Many of the Holy Race’s combat methods and Skills were incomprehensible to human players. As a result, many parties failed to survive their encounters with Holy Race players. So, it was best to avoid contact with Holy Race players as much as possible.

Thirty seconds later, Moon Bamboo finished appraising the eleven items, the speed of her appraisal astonishing even Shi Feng.

“We really lucked out this time!” Moon Bamboo exclaimed. “Other than four Common Secret Treasures and two Legendary materials, we also got one Bronze Purification Technique and four Combat Secret Treasures!”

“There’s a Bronze Purification Technique and four Combat Secret Treasures?”

Sky Pivot and the others couldn’t help but be astonished. Billowing Water found this outcome especially shocking.

Whether it was the Bronze Purification Technique or Combat Secret Treasures, both were extremely rare on the Western Continent. According to her understanding, even Seven Luminaries Town’s veteran parties wouldn’t necessarily own a Bronze Purification Technique or a Combat Secret Treasure. Most were still stuck with Common Purification Technique and Common Secret Treasures.

Yet, their party had obtained one Bronze Purification Technique and four Combat Secret Treasures from killing just one Regional Boss. This was an unbelievable harvest.

“Brother Black Flame, as per our agreement and your contribution to the party, this Bronze Purification Technique belongs to you,” Sky Pivot calmly said. “Besides that, you and Billow can have priority in choosing one item from the remaining items.”

Moon Bamboo, Budding Leaf, and Splashing Fire did not object to Sky Pivot’s arrangement. They simply looked at the party’s two newcomers.

Although they had reaped a huge harvest this time, Sky Pivot had already informed them of the promises he previously made to Shi Feng and Billowing Water. They had also agreed to Sky Pivot’s decision before they set out, so they weren’t about to kick up a fuss now. Not to mention, even if they conceded three items, the rest of the loot was still plenty astonishing. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Meanwhile, Billowing Water couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng enviously when she heard he would be receiving a Bronze Purification Technique.

For newcomers like themselves to survive on the Western Continent, it was imperative that they strengthened their mana as soon as possible. Not to mention, a Bronze Purification Technique could undoubtedly provide a huge increase in strength. If she could get her hands on one and learn it successfully, she was confident she could enter Seven Luminaries Town’s upper ranks.

“Would you like to make a trade with me, Miss Billow?” Shi Feng quietly asked when he noticed Billowing Water’s yearning for the Bronze Purification Technique. “We previously agreed that half of my earnings in the Forbidden Zone would belong to you. If I give this Bronze Purification Technique to you, can we settle the matter?”

“Are you really willing to trade this Bronze Purification Technique for half of your harvests later?” Billowing Water asked, confused by Shi Feng’s offer.

Even though she hadn’t spent much time in Seven Luminaries Town, she knew how valuable a Bronze Purification Technique was. It was highly unlikely they would get another Bronze Purification Technique in their subsequent exploration. So, Shi Feng would be losing out big time if he were to trade away his Bronze Purification Technique to offset the earnings he needed to split with her afterward.

“Of course,” Shi Feng said, smiling. “While the Bronze Purification Technique is valuable, it isn’t something I must have right now. Moreover, if you can strengthen your mana, it will make subsequent explorations in this party easier. We will also have a greater chance of obtaining a second Bronze Purification Technique and more precious items.”

“Okay! I agree to your offer!” Billowing Water said, finding Shi Feng’s reasoning to be valid.

If she could learn a Bronze Purification Technique, the Dawnlight Party’s overall strength would further increase. Afterward, they would have an easier time exploring the Plain of Fallen Gods, and their chances of obtaining better loot would also increase. If another Bronze Purification Technique truly did drop, Shi Feng would have bet correctly and earned much more than he originally would have.

Immediately, Shi Feng handed the Bronze Purification Technique he obtained to Billowing Water and strode toward the ten remaining items.

“I’ll choose this one,” Shi Feng said as he picked up a crystal vial containing a drop of scarlet liquid. The scarlet liquid was called Soul Blood, and it was one of the two Legendary materials dropped by the Regional Boss.

Seeing this, Billowing Water couldn’t help but be surprised once again. This time, though, she completely failed to understand why Shi Feng would choose a Legendary material instead of the more precious Combat Secret Treasures.

However, what Billowing Water did not know was that the reason Shi Feng had decided to trade away the precious Bronze Purification Technique in the first place was precisely so that he could keep this unassuming Soul Blood.

“Are you sure you want to choose the Soul Blood, Brother Black Flame?” When Sky Pivot saw Shi Feng choosing the crystal vial, he couldn’t help but seek further confirmation from Shi Feng.
