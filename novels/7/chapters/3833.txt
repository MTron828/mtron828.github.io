Chapter 3834 - 908 - Fourth Tablet

Starlight Continent, Desolate Star City:

After a one-hour drive, Xia Qingying’s group arrived at a massive building in the heart of Desolate Star City.

The building was over 500 meters tall with a radius of three kilometers. Its entrance, measuring 100 meters in height, made arriving guests feel tiny.

“Dear guests, welcome to Desolate Star City’s trade fair. You are free to browse around in the next two days. There will also be a special auction open only to Silver Guests in the evening,” the head attendant introduced dutifully. “I will be your full-time guide during this period. If there is anything you would like to know about Desolate Star City, please don’t hesitate to ask me.”

“You are going to be our full-time guide?” Xia Qingying exclaimed in astonishment.

Had the head attendant before them been ordinary, Xia Qingying wouldn’t have said anything. However, the other party was a bona fide three-star grandmaster. The head attendant didn’t look particularly old, either. If she were to join a conglomerate, she would receive a role in senior management at the minimum. Yet, a three-star grandmaster like her had been tasked with working as a guide. Xia Qingying couldn’t fathom how powerful Desolate Star City was.

“That is correct,” the head attendant answered nonchalantly. “Feel free to let me handle any requests you have in the next two days.”

“Okay, I understand.” After suppressing the shock in her heart, Xia Qingying asked, “In which area are rare materials sold?”

“Rare materials are primarily sold in the east district. The various powers have representatives operating stalls there, so you can negotiate prices with them directly,” the head attendant answered. “If you want to rent a stall, an ordinary stall costs 200 million Star Coins for two days, while stalls in prime locations cost 500 million Star Coins for two days.”

Isn’t this daylight robbery? Xia Qingying was flabbergasted.

Even at its current size, the Green God Corporation could, at best, come up with two or three hundred million Star Coins on short notice. Yet, the corporation’s total liquid assets were only enough to rent an ordinary stall for two days. In other words, the average corporation wasn’t even qualified to set up a stall here.

At this time, only Endless Scars and Shi Feng looked calm. They behaved like they were used to having three-star grandmasters serve as their guides and seeing stalls with a daily rent of hundreds of millions of Star Coins.

When Endless Scars saw Shi Feng’s calm reaction, she was a little surprised.

Qingying has been to many grand events with me, but even she is still shocked by this situation, so how can he remain unfazed? After seeing Shi Feng’s response, Endless Scars couldn’t help but wonder what kind of Guild Zero Wing was that it could give him the confidence to think nothing of such a grand event. Could he be naturally arrogant?

“Will there be anything good sold at the evening auction?” Drifting Bean asked.

“I cannot say,” the head attendant answered. “But according to the information I received, Fragmented Divine Artifacts will be sold at the auction. The highly popular Intermediate Divine Engraving Scrolls will also be available.”

“Commander, this auction seems pretty good. It actually has Fragmented Divine Artifacts and Intermediate Divine Engraving Scrolls. Should we go and take a look?” Drifting Bean asked Endless Scars with an inquisitive look.

“Sure, but we are here for Qingying’s sake, so we will finish buying materials first and then go,” Endless Scars said.

Afterward, the head attendant led the group to the trade fair’s east district. Many powers had already sent representatives to set up stalls in the east district and sell their specialties. Every stall had holographic projections displaying the goods it sold and a detailed introduction to them. The quantity and variety of goods sold in the east district could rarely be found, even in the Greater God’s Domain’s various Holy Cities.

Among the various stalls, the largest one belonged to the Galaxy Conglomerate. Even Endless Scars, who showed little interest in the other stalls, couldn’t help but browse the Galaxy Conglomerate’s stall.

Incredible! Xia Qingying was in awe when she saw that the Galaxy Shop displayed over a dozen Fragmented Divine Artifacts. When her gaze fell on a particular glowing staff for Clerics, her eyes locked on to it immediately as she asked the salesperson, “How much for this Sage’s Will?”

“Dear customer, you have an excellent eye!” At Xia Qingying’s question, the salesperson introduced enthusiastically, “The Sage’s Will is a Fragmented Divine Artifact that the Galaxy Conglomerate had sacrificed thousands of elite experts to recover from a primordial ruin. It has a hidden ability known as Will Amplification that can enhance the wielder’s neural reaction speed and resistance to mental impacts. Since you are the first customer to have expressed interest in this staff, the Galaxy Conglomerate will offer it to you at a bargain price of just 30,000 Eternal Gold!”

“Thirty thousand? That much?” Despite knowing that Fragmented Divine Artifacts for Clerics were rarely sold in the Greater God’s Domain, Xia Qingying was still taken aback by the price.

Thirty thousand Eternal Gold was not a small sum in the current Eternal Realm—at least, it was not for her. Although she had been generating income by reselling items using her connections with the Eternal Chamber of Commerce, she still didn’t have enough Eternal Coins to buy the Sage’s Will. To afford it, she would have to sell her Legendary Weapon and all her Legendary Equipment.

“What about this tablet?” Shi Feng suddenly asked, pointing at a badly damaged stone tablet on display.

“That tablet was recovered from the same primordial ruin. Although we couldn’t identify it, we believe it should be very valuable, so it is priced at 20,000 Eternal Gold,” the salesperson explained awkwardly.

The Galaxy Conglomerate failed to identify the badly damaged tablet despite having used various means. It was as if the tablet was a piece of scrap. If the Galaxy Conglomerate tried to sell the tablet for 20,000 Eternal Gold without offering any explanations, it would be daylight robbery.

“Twenty thousand?” Shi Feng expressed hesitancy as he scrutinized the tablet.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Actually, Shi Feng was somewhat familiar with the damaged tablet. This was because he had seen more than one of such tablets already. Furthermore, the mana interpretation method engraved on the damaged tablet was the same as the ones engraved on Aqua Rose’s and Elise’s Goddess Tablets. However, due to the damage to the tablet, he could only glean limited information from it using the mana interpretation method. Even so, this information was enough to assure him of the tablet’s identity.

This was because the information he obtained labeled the damaged tablet as the Fourth Goddess Tablet!

According to the Sixth Goddess Tablet in Elise’s possession, there was a series of eighteen Goddess Tablets. The earlier a Goddess Tablet’s position in the series, the greater its significance.

Although Elise’s Goddess Tablet placed sixth in the series, Shi Feng still benefited from it greatly. He dared not even imagine what benefits he could reap from the Fourth Goddess Tablet.
