Chapter 356 – The Zero Wing of Today

Empress Blood Arrow!

Undefeated Battle Maniac! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Both were titles known by many in the Greater God’s Domain’s Starlight Realm, as the owners of these titles had shaken dozens of kingdoms and multiple empires in the past. Meanwhile, as someone much older than Leroja and Cross, Calgaron had the opportunity to bear witness to the history these two people created.

When Leroja and Cross were still actively competing among the Starlight Realm’s younger generation, they were known to be invincible among Tier 4 players. They had challenged many paragons across several dozen kingdoms to an official duel, yet not once did they suffer defeat. If they hadn’t offended a conglomerate, they would have become even more famous in the Starlight Realm.

!!

According to rumors, a conglomerate had extended an olive branch to Leroja and Cross. However, because the conglomerate required them to withdraw from the corporations they were affiliated with, the two eventually chose to give up on joining the conglomerate. Their decision ended up displeasing the conglomerate. As a result, the corporations they belonged to had no choice but to drastically restrict their appearances in public. Otherwise, they would have long since become top celebrities in the Starlight Realm.

Although Saint Nine was powerful, he was far from standing on the same level as Leroja and Cross. It was also why Saint Nine dared to challenge the God List’s current top 3 players but did not have confidence in securing first place.

It was because the player currently occupying the number one position on the Miniature Ancient World’s God List was Trecht, an existence known as one of the Three Invincibles alongside Leroja and Cross.

So, when Calgaron heard that Black Flame had triumphed over Leroja and Cross, he couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

…

While Calgaron was in shock, Franz similarly revealed a dazed expression on his face.

“Is what you just said true, Auntie?” Franz couldn’t help but doubt his ears when he heard what his Aunt Favra had just said. “That’s Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac we are talking about! How can Black Flame possibly win against those two legendary individuals?”

“It’s not strange for you to be unaware of this matter since you’ve been focused on the Miniature Ancient World. The Desolate Star Corporation doesn’t have any dealings in the Ancient River Kingdom, either,” Favra said, nodding in response to her nephew’s doubts. Then, she revealed a wry smile as she explained:

“According to my sources, Black Flame won the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition yesterday and became the kingdom’s First Paragon. Although Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac had participated in the Rookie Competition, they concluded the competition in second and third place. At this point, everyone in and around the Ancient River Kingdom already knows about this matter. But what really surprises me is that Black Flame can actually return to the Miniature Ancient World.”

Honestly, Favra would have never paid attention to the man named Black Flame if it weren’t for her niece Maria. She also wouldn’t have bothered to keep an eye on the Ancient River Kingdom’s situation. After all, the Starlight Realm was a massive place with over a thousand kingdoms and thousands of freely accessible God’s Domains. Even if she was a three-star mental strength grandmaster, she couldn’t possibly pay attention to all these different worlds 24/7.

Meanwhile, Black Flame’s return to the Miniature Ancient World truly surprised her.

Even if she ignored Black Flame’s achievement of winning against Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac, his ability to freely travel between the Greater God’s Domain and Miniature Ancient World was more than enough for her to label him as incredible.

Dammit!

Franz couldn’t help but have the urge to slap himself when he finished listening to his aunt’s explanation. He might not know what had happened in the Ancient River Kingdom, but he did know about the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition. To avoid taking up their respective countries’ slots, it wouldn’t be strange for Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac to participate in the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition.

Meanwhile, paragons such as Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac were highly sought after by even the various corporations’ helmsmen. Yet, he had expressed disdain to Black Flame just now. This situation couldn’t be any worse for him.

Different from Franz, Favra felt relieved by Black Flame’s achievements. At the same time, she had to admit that her niece had a good eye for people, betting a Trade Center on Zero Wing early on, instantly allowing her to draw close the distance between her and Black Flame. So long as Maria could receive Black Flame’s support, she would have a much greater chance of becoming the Desolate Star Corporation’s helmsman.

However, the commotion on the flying ship was only a small interlude for everyone’s discussions. Shortly after the commotion ended, everyone went back to discussing the Thunder Fortress.

Now that the World Passage was about to open, the Sea of Dark Thunder’s Thunder Fortress had become the gathering place for many geniuses and powers. Once all of these geniuses and powers arrived, the fortress would definitely become the most spectacular location in the Miniature Ancient World. At the same time, it would become the place where the various powers decided how they would divide the Miniature Ancient World’s interests in the future.

…

Sea of Dark Thunder, Thunder Fortress:

The Thunder Fortress was a steel behemoth situated in the middle of a pitch-black sea. At this time, ships of incredible value could be seen docking inside the spacious fortress one after another, their numbers easily exceeding 5,000. This number normally couldn’t be seen in any naval city. However, despite how many ships were docking inside the fortress, the fortress’s inner port did not seem crowded.

While watching these ships dock inside the Thunder Fortress, the many native geniuses resting at the port engaged in discussion with each other.

“Why have the Seven Great Powers gathered us native geniuses and experts here?” a young man who was a Level 132, Tier 4 Ranger asked, the youth sipping on a glass of cheap fruit wine as he curiously looked at the Seven Great Native Powers’ ships docked nearby.

“Isn’t it obvious that they’re trying to recruit us? I heard that players would need to be at Tier 4 at the very least to enter the World Passage. Meanwhile, the seven powers will not only need ships to trade with the Greater God’s Domain, but also a large number of experts to escort their ships,” a Level 132, Tier 4 Elementalist said. “The trading of resources between the Miniature Ancient World and the Greater God’s Domain is a big business. The seven powers can earn a ton of the Greater World’s Star Coins if handled properly. However, compared to foreign players who are familiar with the Greater God’s Domain, it’ll be much easier for the seven powers to control us native players.”

“The saddest part is that we don’t have a choice,” a Level 133, Tier 4 Berserker said, sighing. “Unless you’re one of those so-called paragons, none of the various foreign powers will bat a second eye at you. The only thing native experts like us can do is join a relatively strong native power if we want to have an easier time surviving in the Greater God’s Domain.”

“Indeed.” The Level 132 Elementalist nodded in agreement. “But out of the seven powers, which one should we join? Maybe Zero Wing? Aside from the Five Great Super Guilds, the remaining two options are the Flower of Seven Sins and Zero Wing. Among them, Zero Wing’s rise is the quickest. Zero Wing’s Guild Leader Black Flame is even seventh on the God List.”

“Zero Wing?” The Level 133 Berserker shook his head when he heard the Elementalist’s suggestion. “Zero Wing’s rise might be the quickest, but its foundation is far too lacking compared to the other six powers. You can see this just by looking at each power’s fleet. The fleets of the Five Great Super Guilds and the Flower of Seven Sins are led by two or more Warships. Each fleet also has more than ten Bronze Speedboats. In comparison, Zero Wing’s fleet only has three Bronze Speedboats and a bunch of Advanced Speedboats. It doesn’t even have one Warship.

“In addition, that person from the Thunder Fortress has already informed the various powers to pay 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal to stay in the fortress. Out of the seven powers, Zero Wing is the only one that has yet to hand over the Seven Luminaries Crystals. The due date is even tomorrow. If Zero Wing still doesn’t pay up, it can’t even stay in the Thunder Fortress past tomorrow.”

As soon as the Berserker finished speaking, a passing Swordsman suddenly stopped walking. Then, looking at the Berserker, the cloaked Swordsman curiously asked, “Excuse me, friend, what is this about paying 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal? Does the Thunder Fortress have such a rule?”
