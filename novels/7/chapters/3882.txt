Chapter 3883 - 957 - Absolute Thunder

As the giant figure exited the tower, everyone’s casual expression turned ugly. This was especially so for Shi Feng.

[Adegas] (First-Generation Hero of the Human Race, Tier 6)
Level 230
HP 90,000,000,000,000,000 (90 quadrillion)

Why is it a First-Generation Hero? Shi Feng stared at the giant figure in bewilderment.

The video the Seven Luminaries Alliance had captured in his previous life was very detailed. The video showed not only the entire process of the Sun Dynasty capturing the primordial civilization city but also the sole treasure, the Inferior Legendary Siege Weapon Firmament, stored inside the city.

As far as he could remember, the Guardian Boss that emerged from the central tower should have been a Primordial Half-Orc King, which was a Level 230 World Boss and a bona fide Primordial Godkin. It was an incredibly tough opponent, and the Sun Dynasty had sacrificed over half of its 1,000 Level 240 elite experts to defeat it.

But now, not only was the city’s Guardian Boss different, but it had even become a First-Generation Hero. This was an existence with a Life Rating comparable to Ancient Gods and a combat standard rivaling that of War Goddesses. Most importantly, the First-Generation Hero before them was equipped with a Divine Set!

Indeed! Adegas wasn’t just equipped with Divine Artifacts but a Divine Set!

It should be known that one of the Twenty-Two Taboo Bosses was a First-Generation Hero. Moreover, this First-Generation Hero ranked third among them and had slain multiple Ancient Gods in the past. The Grand Library also held records of multiple apex powers attempting to raid this First-Generation Hero, only to have their raid members granted a true death. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that nothing short of a Primordial God could defeat this First-Generation Hero.

Although Adegas was undoubtedly weaker than the Taboo-ranked First-Generation Hero, considering he was just Level 230, the last First-Generation Hero to have been slain by players, according to the Grand Library’s records, was a Level 224 one. At the time, over 3,000 Level 240 players had participated in the raid, many of whom were experts equipped with one or two Divine Artifacts and multiple Fragmented Divine Artifacts. There had also been more than ten Level 240 experts fully equipped with Divine Artifacts.

Nonetheless, over 2,000 members of the raid team had died in battle. If not for the low level of the First-Generation Hero in question, at least half of those 2,000-plus players would have suffered a true death.

A Level 230 First-Generation Hero!

This was an insurmountable hurdle for their 1,000-man team. Even if they had two sixth-floor experts and Snow Wolf was fully equipped with Divine Artifacts, they still had zero chance of defeating Adegas.

Accepting this mission was the worst decision ever! Snow Wolf’s expression turned indescribably gloomy as he watched Adegas walking out of the tower.

Although Snow Wolf did not know how powerful the human race’s First-Generation Heroes were, he could tell how terrifying an existence Adegas was by simply looking at the other party’s 21 HP bars.

“Run away!” Shi Feng commanded when he saw Adegas was out of the tower.

However, as soon as Shi Feng voiced his command, Adegas suddenly pointed his greatsword at the sky. Immediately, everyone felt the world around them tremble. Then, before anyone could react, multiple magic arrays appeared in the sky.

Fivefold Tier 6 Curse, Worldshaper!

Even when cast normally, the magic barrier created by Worldshaper could be broken only by Tier 6 Gods or existences of a similar standard. When five Worldshapers were cast on top of one another, they compressed space to the extreme, and even Tier 6 Ancient Gods would struggle to break out of the compound barrier.

“Intruders, do not attempt to escape,” Adegas suddenly said in a deep and booming voice. “Unless you defeat me, you can only remain here. But it is evident none of you have the strength to kill me.”

“Esteemed Hero, may I know what we can do for you?” Shi Feng asked, not bothering to put up any resistance. After all, trying to resist a Level 230 First-Generation Hero with their current team would be a joke. Unless he could get Kalisha to show up in person, any attempt they made to fight Adegas would end in their demise.

“Simple! Defeat me!” Adegas stated. “Of course, it is impossible with your strength alone. There is only one way you can defeat me: by mastering the Skills I have developed. So long as you can exceed the limits of these Skills, it will be possible for you to defeat me.”

After saying so, Adegas waved his hand and imprinted divine runes on the mind of everyone present, which directly conveyed information into their mind.

System: Adegas, son of a Primordial God, has temporarily granted you the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill Absolute Thunder. If you fail to defeat Adegas in three natural days, you will be deprived of the Skill and face the wrath of Adegas.

System: It is detected that you have a Great Lord Token. The sooner you defeat Adegas, the greater the rewards you will receive from the Primordial Civilization City. You are advised to master Absolute Thunder.

“Three days. I will give you only three days,” Adegas said, sweeping his gaze over everyone as if passing a sentence. “If none of you can defeat me in three days, all of you will die!”

When Adegas finished speaking, some players were surprised, while some despaired.

“Heavens! Am I hallucinating? This is a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill!”

“This NPC must be out of his mind! Three days?! How is that enough time to practice a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill to the Overlimit standard?!”

“We’re doomed! So far, Lunar River is the only Overlimit expert in our Greater God’s Domain, and even she would need more than three days to practice a Tier 6 Skill to the Overlimit standard, let alone a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill! The system must be toying with us!”

Everyone had mixed feelings over the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill or Spell they just received.

It was naturally great news that they could learn a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill or Spell. After all, even Tier 6 Skills and Spells were incredibly precious in the Greater God’s Domain. Core executives of apex powers would be fortunate to have a dozen Tier 6 Skills and Spells in their arsenal, while the average Tier 6 player wouldn’t have more than a few. The average Tier 6 player likely wouldn’t have learned any Tier 6 Taboo Skills or Curses, either. As for Pseudo-Tier 7 Skills and Spells, this was the first time they had heard about such things.

However, nobody could feel happy about their sudden windfall. After all, they’d be delusional if they thought they could master a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill or Spell to the Overlimit standard. They might not even achieve a 100% Completion Rate in three days.

After Shi Feng withdrew from the immersive demonstration of Absolute Thunder he was just given, he executed Twofold Mana Body and attempted the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill.

TL Notes:
The Pseudo-Tier 7 Skills and Spells received from Adegas are probably determined based on their classes, so the system notification about Absolute Thunder should be limited to Shi Feng and other Swordsmen.
