Chapter 2485 – Inhuman Battle

“Over 400,000 damage?! Is she even human?!”

Every member of the Hell Legion wondered if they were hallucinating when they saw the bright-red numbers above the Earthen Chieftain’s head. For a moment, they even wondered if Fire Dance was an NPC disguised as a player.

Even they, experts who stood at the pinnacle of God’s Domain, could barely cause over -70,000 damage to the Earthen Giants with Tier 3 Skills and Spells. Hell Rush, one of the legion’s strongest players, could only deal around -150,000. These monsters’ ridiculously high Defense and Magic Resistance could practically rival Archaic Species’ of the same rank.

And yet, they had just watched a Tier 3 Assassin deal over -400,000 damage to the Grand Lord ranked Earthen Chieftain, and she had only used a Tier 2 Skill.

Even at Tier 3, Assassins didn’t have many options for raising their attacks’ power. Most of their Skills focused on speed, increasing their total DPS. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

But Fire Dance had obliterated what they had known about the class. How could she even be considered an Assassin with that kind of raw power? She was even more of a Berserker than actual Berserkers...

Before the Hell Legion members could recover from their shock, Yan Tianxing and the other three Zero Wing experts started their battles with their own Earthen Chieftains.

Yan Tianxing effortlessly evaded his Grand Lord’s straightforward attack, circling to the Grand Lord’s back. He then brandished his daggers and sent several beautiful, silver arcs slicing into the Earthen Chieftain’s back.

-134,324!

-274,543!

-133,645!

A series of damages appeared above the Earthen Chieftain’s head, and although each of his hits didn’t deal as much damage as Fire Dance’s, the total amount was frightening.

Meanwhile, Aqua Rose, Violet Cloud, and Yi Luofei, all magical class players, caused an even greater commotion.

As soon as Aqua Rose finished her Spell’s incantation, a towering tidal wave manifested before her, devouring the Earthen Chieftain and several dozen Earthen Giants nearby.

In one move, Aqua Rose heavily injured the Earthen Giants and Earthen Chieftain, which boasted high Magic Resistance. She also dealt over a million damage to each of them.

Meanwhile, Yi Luofei summoned five flaming meteors, casting them down on her Earthen Chieftain.

One... Two... Three meteors...

As each meteor struck the ground, the Dungeon’s first floor trembled violently. By the time all five had landed, they had created a crater that was over 100 meters wide and 10 meters deep around the Grand Lord.

Of the three Earthen Chieftains that faced these magical class players, however, Violet Cloud’s target was in the worst state.

Three hundred shadow blades danced around the Grand Lord, each with enough force to make the monster stumble. When all 300 attacked as one, the outcome could only be described as a tragedy...

“How does Zero Wing have so many monstrous players?”

At this point, every member of the Hell Legion believed that Yan Tianxing’s party could slay the five Earthen Chieftains, let alone keep them distracted. They only might need some time to defeat the monsters.

Even so, their combat power was astonishing.

The five Zero Wing experts single-handedly suppressed the Star Tomb’s grand lords, and not one of them was an MT.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, have they...fully unlocked their Mana Bodies?” Hell Rush could not help but ask as he watched Fire Dance and the others fight.

He couldn’t think of any other reason that would allow those five players to display such incredible speed and power.

Not even the various Super Guilds’ experts had unlocked their Mana Bodies’ full potential. All of them were still exploring. It hadn’t been long since these experts had reached Tier 3, after all.

“They have. All five have reached 100% of their Mana Bodies’ potential,” Shi Feng confirmed with a nod. He had no intention of hiding the fact, nor could he.

He couldn’t explain away the strength Yan Tianxing and the other four displayed as higher Basic Attributes. Even if they had double or triple their Basic Attributes, they wouldn’t exhibit such impressive combat power. Players could only accomplish this feat by unlocking their Mana Body’s full potential.

It was a pity that Shadow Sword, Cola, Turtledove, and Alluring Summer hadn’t progressed this far yet. Even Alluring Summer had only unlocked 98% of her potential. If she had been able to bridge that final gap, their team would’ve had a much easier time exploring the Star Tomb.

“All five of them have fully unlocked their Mana Bodies?”

Hell Rush and the vice commanders around him gasped when they heard Shi Feng’s answer. They had suspected this might be the case, but they couldn’t help their astonishment when Shi Feng had confirmed it.

Even the strongest player in Netherworld Empire had only unlocked 20% of their Mana Body’s potential; they’d still need another month or two to reach 100%. They would still need at least one or two months to reach 100% potential.

Yet, Zero Wing, a Guild that had started from nothing in God’s Domain and wasn’t supported by any major corporation, had nurtured five experts with fully unlocked Mana Bodies. It was unbelievable!

“Would you be willing to offer some guidance regarding Mana Bodies, Guild Leader Black Flame? If you are, I can represent my Guild in offering to garrison 50,000 experts in the Starlight Fortress long-term. Netherworld Empire will also supply Zero Wing with various rare materials from the western continent,” Hell Rush proposed, trying to contain his excitement.

Everyone’s Mana Body was different, and players would gain very little from others’ experiences, but the fact that Zero Wing had nurtured five experts with fully unlocked Mana Bodies proved that it could help players accomplish the feat. Anyone that said otherwise was either lying or a fool.

Players would see huge differences in their accomplishments, depending on how soon they unlocked their Mana Bodies’ potential. The difference between the combat power Zero Wing’s members displayed and that of the Hell Legion made that much obvious.

After Hell Rush presented his offer and request, the rest of his comrades grew restless, watching Shi Feng. They all wanted to hear his answer.

Before this, they hadn’t realized how effective a fully unlocked Mana Body would be on one’s combat power, but after seeing Yan Tianxing and his companions’ performance, they were sure of one thing.

Tier 3 players that hadn’t unlocked their Mana Bodies were pests in comparison!

Many of the Hell Legion’s members had just as high combat standards as Fire Dance and the others, but if they had to fight any of those five players, they’d refuse. The difference between their overall combat power was like the difference between heaven and earth.

They even suspected that Fire Dance and her party could take on 30 Hell Legion members simultaneously.

The more Hell Legion’s experts thought about it, the more restless they became. Rather than their earlier prideful attitude, they all watched Shi Feng with anticipation and hunger.

Weapons and equipment were secondary concerns for experts like them. Their individual strength was far more important. In fact, they had joined their Guild in the pursuit of greater strength.

“Don’t worry about the 50,000 experts,” Shi Feng dismissed the offer. He could not help but shake his head and chuckle when he saw everyone’s eager looks. “Offering guidance for unlocking your Mana Bodies isn’t necessarily impossible, but in exchange, I’d like Netherworld Empire to help me with another matter. In exchange, I will offer some advice. Although I cannot help all of you unlock your Mana Bodies’ full potential in a short time, I can help you complete the task with a little more speed.”

Hell Rush had to calm his heart again when Shi Feng had agreed. He responded immediately, “Guild Leader Black Flame, please, state your demands! If I have the authority to agree to them, I can do so on my Guild’s behalf!”

“It’s very simple. I need one month. I want Hell Legion under my command for one full month!” Shi Feng raised a finger and swept his gaze across the Hell Legion members.
