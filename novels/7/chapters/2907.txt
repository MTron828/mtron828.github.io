Chapter 2908 – Middle Layer

“We’re going to the middle layer now?”

Shi Feng was a little surprised by Xia Wuyuan’s words. According to his understanding, while one could indeed live in the middle layer once one became a mental strength master, one would first need to clear the Green God Company’s internal test and review. One couldn’t enter the middle layer simply on the assumption that one was a mental strength master already. After all, the middle layer was an incredibly important location for the Green God Company. Even the middle layer’s official residents needed to undergo strict inspections every time they entered and left.

When Qin Baiyi overheard Xia Wuyuan’s words, he was dumbfounded.

Qin Baiyi still remembered that after he became a mental strength master, he had to go through an incredibly troublesome process to gain access to the middle layer. Yet, Shi Feng could enter the middle layer before even receiving the Green God Company’s recognition.

However, Xia Wuyuan indeed had the authority to make such a decision as the middle layer’s general manager. Even if Shi Feng weren’t a mental strength master, Xia Wuyuan could still bring him into the middle layer, just without official residential status.

“Of course. Although you haven’t passed our internal test and review yet, the fact that you held your ground against Fu Jiuzhong proves that you are indeed a mental strength master,” Xia Wuyuan said, nodding. He then smiled and continued, “Since you are now one of Yuantian City’s Upper Zone’s mental strength masters, you naturally have to get registered at the middle layer immediately. Or are you telling me you don’t want the middle layer’s residential status?”

“Of course not,” Shi Feng said hurriedly. “It will naturally be wonderful if I can get my residential status for the middle zone right now.”

The resources available to the middle layer’s residents were beyond the reach of the base layer’s residents. Specifically, he could purchase Life Water once he gained middle-layer residential status.

“Good. Let’s go, then!” After Xia Wuyuan finished speaking, he waved his hand, and a maglev limousine marked with the Green God Company’s logo descended from the sky. He then entered the limousine together with Xia Qingying and Shi Feng, and the three of them flew straight toward the mountain’s halfway point. At this sight, Han Yifeng and the other corporation heirs aiming to enter the middle layer inevitably grew envious. “Brother Shi’s status is going to skyrocket now.” Han Yifeng was filled with complex emotions as he watched Shi Feng depart.

Han Yifeng had constantly been seeking to gain the privilege to live in the middle layer. Yet, Shi Feng now had this privilege at his fingertips. Shi Feng had even gained the attention of Xia Wuyuan, the middle layer’s general manager. Even after entering the middle layer, Shi Feng would not have to fear being targeted.

What a pity... Qin Baiyi also sighed inwardly at this situation.

If the middle layer’s big shots found out about Shi Feng’s talent, they would desperately try to get him as their student; Qin Baiyi’s teacher wouldn’t be an exception. Now, though, Xia Wuyuan had gotten ahead of everyone.

A mental strength master, is it? I’ll soon catch up to you!

Unlike Qin Baiyi and the others, when Weiyang Qianhen saw Shi Feng departing for the middle layer, the urge to compete with Shi Feng bloomed in her heart.

On the other side, Shi Feng’s group arrived in the middle layer after going through multiple electronic scans and inspections.

Upon entering the mist-shrouded area, Shi Feng felt a significant portion of his accumulated mental fatigue clear up. The middle layer’s recovery effects were drastically better than those of the large mansion’s environment.

When Xia Wuyuan brought Shi Feng to a mansion flanked by a lush mountainside and a small waterfall, Shi Feng was completely stunned by the environment.

“Isn’t the environment here a little too amazing? It’s at least twice as good as the environment I felt when I entered the middle layer. Even without doing anything, I can probably live up to 160 or 170 years old in such an environment,” Shi Feng exclaimed as he experienced the changes the mansion’s environment brought to his body.

“This is one of only 20 top-tier mansions in the middle layer. Let alone 160 or 170, a Henglian grandmaster can live up to 200 here without any problems,” Xia Wuyuan said, chuckling. “As the Green God Company’s life technology continues improving, the lifespan of the middle layer’s residents will also increase. Eventually, this place will let even ordinary people live up to 200 years old. As for mental strength masters like yourself, you might live to celebrate your 300th birthday.”

“Three hundred?” Shi Feng was a little dazed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Three hundred years was already enough for a change in dynasties during ancient times.

“That’s right. Although it is still somewhat difficult to reach such an age in the middle layer right now, the improvement is only a matter of time,” Xia Wuyuan said, nodding. “However, if you become a mental strength grandmaster, reaching 300 won’t be difficult at all.”

“Are mental strength grandmasters that strong?” Shi Feng asked in surprise.

With his current physical fitness, even with the support of Life Potions and the middle layer’s environment, he could, at most, live to around 200 years old. He dared not think about living up to 300. Yet, Xia Wuyuan stated that a mental strength grandmaster could currently live up to three centuries. This was incredible.

“Of course! Mental strength grandmasters are much stronger than you think. They can exert 100% control over their brains. To ordinary people, they are no different from gods. The Green God Company’s creator was also a mental strength grandmaster,” Xia Wuyuan said, awe and envy appearing on his face.

Shi Feng was stunned once more.

The Green God Company was the most influential corporation in the world. The combined influence of every other corporation worldwide couldn’t match the Green God Company’s influence. Shi Feng never imagined that the founder of this corporation was a mental strength grandmaster. This was simply unbelievable.

Seeing Shi Feng’s dazed expression, Xia Wuyuan added, “You, too, have a small possibility of becoming a mental strength grandmaster. It is for this possibility that I brought you to the middle layer. Only by living here can you better develop your mental strength. Letting you remain in the base layer is simply a huge waste.”

Shi Feng immediately came to a realization when he heard Xia Wuyuan’s words. It was no wonder Xia Wuyuan brought him straight to the middle layer without undergoing the Green God Company’s test.

When Xia Wuyuan saw Shi Feng’s contemplative expression, he smiled faintly and asked, “You’re thinking that with your potential, I’m underestimating you by saying that you only have a small possibility of becoming a mental strength grandmaster, right?”

Shi Feng didn’t deny Xia Wuyuan’s guess. In his opinion, if the Tier 5 Concentration standard of God’s Domain represented the master standard for mental strength in the real world, then the Tier 6 Concentration standard should correspond to the mental strength grandmaster standard.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng was relatively confident that he could get promoted to Tier 6 in his current state. After all, he had an Ancient God’s Legacy. He even had items that improved Concentration, such as the Soul Water and Crystal of Souls. Raising his Concentration to the Tier 6 standard with the help of these items shouldn’t be difficult.

As if having seen through Shi Feng’s thoughts, Xia Wuyuan said, “Even if your Concentration reaches the Tier 6 standard in God’s Domain, you will still be a long way from becoming a mental strength grandmaster. According to God’s Domain’s Concentration categorization, the Tier 6 Concentration standard is only equivalent to the half-step mental strength grandmaster standard. Currently, you are still far from becoming a half-step grandmaster, let alone becoming an actual grandmaster. You are, at best, close to the two-star master standard.”

“The Tier 6 Concentration standard is equivalent to only the half-step mental strength grandmaster standard?” Shi Feng was startled.

Shi Feng had experienced what it was like to have Tier 6 Concentration thanks to the Light of Two Worlds, and the experience was amazing beyond imagination. With Tier 6 Concentration, he could suppress even ordinary Tier 5 existences with his mental oppression. Tier 4 players that weren’t at the peak of Tier 4 would even lose consciousness on the spot. In his opinion, this should already be equivalent to the rumored mental strength grandmaster standard.

Yet, according to Xia Wuyuan, that wasn’t the case at all. If Xia Wuyuan was telling the truth, then Shi Feng couldn’t even begin to imagine how powerful a mental strength grandmaster’s mind was.

“Can you not make it sound as if half-step mental strength grandmasters are very weak? I’ll have you know that even Yuantian City’s Upper Zone has only three half-step grandmasters, while some of the other Upper Zones have only two. Our Upper Zone is considered above average already,” Xia Wuyuan said, rolling his eyes at Shi Feng. “Also, I managed to assign you this top-tier mansion only because of one other person’s recommendation. Otherwise, even with your excellent talent, you’d only get to live in a basic mansion in the middle layer. You’d need first to become a three-star master to live here!”

“Another person’s recommendation?” Shi Feng grew curious.

Most of his acquaintances in the Upper Zone lived in the base layer, and he knew none of the big shots living in the middle layer.

“You know this person. She’s the person you’ve been secretly investigating. Her ID in God’s Domain is Phoenix Rain,” Xia Wuyuan said. “If not for this girl’s recommendation, you would’ve received a similar treatment to the other mental strength masters.”

“Phoenix Rain?” Shi Feng was surprised. “She’s also living in the middle layer? What is her current condition?”

Shi Feng had conducted plenty of investigations into Phoenix Rain. After all, Ji Luorong was very concerned about her elder sister. However, he never managed to find any information. He never thought that he would receive news of Phoenix Rain from Xia Wuyuan. Moreover, it was even Phoenix Rain who had recommended him to the middle layer.

“I can only say that it isn’t good. Apart from that, there is nothing else you should know right now,” Xia Wuyuan replied, shaking his head. “To be precise, you still don’t have the qualifications to know.” “Her condition isn’t good?” Shi Feng fell into deep thought. After a moment, he asked, “Elder Xia, how do I get the qualifications you speak of?”

Originally, Shi Feng didn’t hold much hope of acquiring information about Phoenix Rain. This was because Phoenix Rain’s situation definitely involved a huge secret. He was fortunate to obtain even this slight bit of information. But now that he was a mental strength master, if he could help Phoenix Rain, he would naturally do so. After all, Phoenix Rain had helped him a lot previously. Phoenix Rain’s little sister, Ji Luorong, was now an important member of Zero Wing as well. There was no reason not to help.

“If you make a significant contribution to the Green God Company and elevate your authority to the Three-star High Grade status, you can know a little more,” Xia Wuyuan said after giving the matter some thought.

“Significant contribution?” Upon hearing that he had a chance, Shi Feng asked hurriedly, “May I know how many contribution points I will need for that?”

“Significant contributions cannot be weighed using contribution points,” Xia Wuyuan replied, shaking his head. “If you want to make a significant contribution, the only available avenue for you right now is driving off the Outerworld’s NPC army in God’s Domain. If you can do that, you might even be able to meet with her.”

“Repel the Outerworld NPC army?” Shi Feng frowned slightly at Xia Wuyuan’s answer.

The Outerworld’s NPC army was different from the Outerworld’s player army. After all, the player army didn’t even have a single Tier 5 player in its ranks. In contrast, the NPC army had Tier 5 NPCs and might even have Demigod-level NPCs. Just stopping the NPC army’s advance was already a difficult feat. Repelling it was simply impossible for the eastern continent’s native forces.

“You should stop thinking about this matter and focus on developing your mental strength,” Xia Wuyuan said. “Although you’ve become a mental strength master and entered the middle layer, Fu Jiuzhong has already become a three-star master. If he’s really intent on targeting you, you’ll probably have to spend the rest of your life cooped up in here. Outside of the middle layer, he’ll have plenty of ways to deal with you.”

Shi Feng nodded in agreement. Currently, the Infinity Master indeed posed a significant threat to him. If Xia Wuyuan hadn’t appeared today, Shi Feng definitely would’ve suffered severe injuries. Moreover, he couldn’t stay in the middle layer or Upper Zone forever, as he needed to manage Zero Wing’s affairs in the outside world.

“Elder Xia, may I know how I can purchase Life Water?” Shi Feng asked.

Shi Feng might not be able to leave the Upper Zone right now, but with Fu Jiuzhong’s status and pride, the latter definitely wouldn’t stoop so low as to target Zero Wing’s other members. After all, none of Zero Wing’s other members could pose a threat to him. And if Fu Jiuzhong targeted Zero Wing’s other members, the Upper Zone’s other residents would look down upon him. However, Shi Feng couldn’t discount the possibility of Fu Jiuzhong having the Upper Zone’s various corporations secretly target Zero Wing, either.

Hence, the first thing Shi Feng needed to do now was let Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose recover. With their strength, protecting Zero Wing from Fu Jiuzhong’s henchmen wouldn’t be difficult.
