Chapter 412 – Saint Camp

“Eternal Stones?”

After listening to what the three said, Shi Feng recalled the Eternity Set he had heard about during his previous life.

Divine Sets might not be overflowing in God’s Domain, but quite a few still existed throughout God’s Domain’s history.

All Divine Sets possessed incomparable power, and even most of the naturally occurring Godly Relics could not hold a candle to them. Upon donning a Divine Set, players could instantly become one of the overlords of God’s Domain.

!!

Out of all the Divine Sets in existence, six of them stood out from the rest, and these six sets were labeled as the Six Great Divine Sets. Meanwhile, the Eternity Set was one of these six special sets.

Few records were available on Eternity, even in the Greater God’s Domain’s Great Titan Library.

According to legends, the last owner of Eternity had relied on the Divine Set to fight against the myriad Ancient Gods as a mortal and create an immortal empire during the era of Ancient Gods. Eventually, the Ancient Gods acknowledged Eternity’s wearer and labeled him the Slayer of Ancient Gods. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Later on, though, Eternity’s wearer died for some inexplicable reason, and the Eternity Set disappeared along with his death. It was also rumored that the Eternity Set was destroyed, and its fragments scattered across the various Realms.

During his previous life, Shi Feng heard that the Galaxy Conglomerate had gotten its hands on clues pertaining to the Eternity Set. When he combined the fact that the Galaxy Conglomerate was currently making an astronomical offer for the Starlight Realm’s players to collect Eternal Stones for it, he couldn’t help but suspect that the Eternal Stones had something to do with the Eternity Set.

Or, more specifically, the Eternal Stones were the Eternity Set’s fragments.

“I’ve already given up on getting Eternal Stones,” Cross said with a wry smile. “Setting aside the fact that they are only dropped in 20-man God Mode Team Dungeons, just surviving in the Holy Realm is tough enough.”

“Is it difficult to survive here?” Shi Feng curiously asked. While he had yet to explore the Holy Realm, the monsters he had come across thus far weren’t insurmountably powerful. The only problem he could see making it difficult for players like Cross to survive here would be the experts of other Realms.

However, for experts like Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury, so long as they didn’t come across fifth-floor experts like Ghost Hand, it shouldn’t be difficult to escape with their lives.

“You should know that we can’t log out of the game if we are in the Holy Realm, Brother Black Flame. If we forcibly log out, we will be at risk of falling into a coma,” Desolate Fury explained. “The Galaxy Conglomerate told us that if we wish to leave the Holy Realm, the only way to do so is to get our hands on an Eternal Stone.”

“We can only leave after obtaining an Eternal Stone?” Shi Feng started to have a mild headache when he heard Desolate Fury’s explanation.

It was a huge problem for him if he couldn’t log out of the game while inside the Holy Realm. After all, he still had many things to take care of in the real world. However, acquiring Holy Stones evidently wasn’t a simple task since a powerful team was needed to raid God Mode Team Dungeons.

“We’ve given up hope on leaving the Holy Realm,” Desolate Fury dejectedly said. “Thankfully, there is a way for us to safely log out of the game, and that is to purchase a Return Talisman. Each Return Talisman will give players one chance to go offline. The only problem is the exorbitant pricing of these Return Talismans. Each talisman costs 100 God Crystal Fragments.

“God Crystal Fragments are only dropped in Dungeons, and the drop rate in Party Dungeons is terrible. Even after raiding Party Dungeons for two whole days, our party only managed to collect about two dozen fragments. After dividing them, each of us received less than a handful. At this rate, who knows how long it’ll take us to get 100 fragments…”

The Holy Realm was indeed a land of opportunities. However, for experts of their caliber, even logging out of the game had become a luxury, let alone getting their hands on any fortuitous opportunities.

They also couldn’t just give up on obtaining God Crystal Fragments, either. After all, they had responsibilities and families in the real world.

To their dismay, they had even come across some people who had been trapped in the Holy Realm for decades. All of these people had thought of starting new accounts. Unfortunately, the Main God System did not even give them this opportunity. Instead, the Main God System only gave them two options:

They could continue logging back into their accounts and strive to get their hands on an Eternal Stone, or they could stop playing God’s Domain entirely.

God’s Domain was the only way for people to develop their mental strength effectively in the real world, so quitting God’s Domain was not an option. After all, who wouldn’t want to live a longer life?

When Shi Feng finished listening to Desolate Fury’s explanation, he couldn’t help but be a little astonished.

The importance of God Crystals need not be said. Many Fragmented Legendary items could be repaired and upgraded into Legendary items using God Crystals. Meanwhile, in the Greater God’s Domain, 100 God Crystal Fragments could be used to synthesize one God Crystal, so one could easily imagine the value of God Crystal Fragments.

Yet, the Holy Realm required players to spend 100 God Crystal Fragments just to gain one opportunity to go offline. Even a wealthy princeling like Dira would find this price costly.

“Save the talking for later. We should hurry back to camp first. If the Dragon Mountain Realm’s players return, none of us should think of escaping,” Leroja said.

Cross and Desolate Fury nodded in agreement.

Ghost Hand was indeed one of the few fifth-floor experts among the Dragon Mountain Realm’s younger generation. However, the Dragon Mountain Realm didn’t just have younger generation experts in the Holy Realm. Older generation experts from the Dragon Mountain Realm were also here.

Every one of those older generation experts had already spent many years in the Holy Realm. The strength and foundation they’ve built for themselves were far superior to what Ghost Hand possessed. If those older generation experts took action, not even the top 300 experts on the Luminous Glory List could match them, let alone someone ranked at the bottom of the list.

Hence, their priority now should be to return to a town. Only after they were inside a town would they be safe.

Shi Feng naturally didn’t have any opinions. He was new to the Holy Realm, so the best course of action to take now would be to find a safe haven and gather information.

Afterward, Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury led Shi Feng on a five-hour dash before arriving outside a town enveloped by a magic barrier.

The town was small, smaller than even a Guild Town. The buildings in the town also looked simple and crude, with the tallest building not exceeding six stories tall.

However, despite the town’s shabby look, it was one of the safest locations in the entire Holy Realm.

According to the trio, the towns found in the Holy Realm were known as Saint Camps. As for why they were called as such, it was because every town was managed by one Saint.

Indeed!

A bona fide Saint!

Although the Saints overseeing these towns were only at Tier 4, because they were existences who had reached the pinnacle in a particular World Law, their strength far exceeded the paragons on the Luminous Glory List.

It wasn’t far-fetched to say that so long as these Saints left the Holy Realm, they would instantly become the center of attention of the Greater God’s Domain. The only reason these Saints chose to remain in the Holy Realm was so that they could get their hands on the Holy Realm’s fortuitous opportunities.

Moreover, standing behind every one of these Saints was a cross-realm conglomerate. So, whether in terms of individual or group strength, these Saints were not opponents that the individual player or conglomerate could hope to contend against.

The moment Shi Feng set foot into the sparsely populated Saint Camp, he immediately understood what made the Holy Realm extraordinary.

Even the weakest player walking on the Saint Camp’s streets was a titled expert, and many experts were on Cross’s and Leroja’s standards. In addition, quite a few of these experts were equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment. While walking among these players, Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury were far from being conspicuous.

The primary currency used in the camp was God Crystal Fragments. Meanwhile, not only could one find Fragmented Legendary items sold in every shop in the camp, but one could also find the incredibly 99 Absolute Techniques being sold. Only, the price of these Absolute Techniques could range anywhere from 1,000 God Crystal Fragments to 10,000 God Crystal Fragments.

Of all the techniques Shi Feng saw being sold, the most expensive one would have to be Dark Star, the fifth-ranking Absolute Technique.

Outside the Holy Realm, players couldn’t learn this Absolute Technique unless they belonged to an apex power. However, in the Holy Realm, players could get one complete learning opportunity so long as they paid 10,000 God Crystal Fragments.

Aside from items in God’s Domain, the camp’s shops also sold precious potions in the Greater World, such as the precious Stardew highly coveted by the various cities. One drop of Stardew only cost 5,000 God Crystal Fragments. Once players paid up, the seller would immediately have the Stardew delivered to their doorsteps via the God’s Domain Association.

The entire Saint Camp had essentially become a trading hub for the various Realms. The opportunities available here were far beyond what was available outside the Holy Realm.

So long as one had God Crystal Fragments, the Holy Realm would be no different than paradise. With all the opportunities available here, even if players could leave the Holy Realm, they wouldn’t necessarily choose to leave.

In fact, that was indeed the case for some experts. Despite having the ability to leave the Holy Realm at any time, some experts would voluntarily choose to remain. Some of these experts had even developed their own forces in the Holy Realm to make a fortune in the real world.

…

In the evening…

After touring the entire Saint Camp, Shi Feng made an appointment to explore the depths of the dilapidated city with the trio tomorrow. Then, with the trio’s help, he rented a room in an inconspicuous hotel for the exorbitant price of one God Crystal Fragment per night. With the prices the Saint Camp’s hotels charged, operating a hotel was even more lucrative than robbing players.

After entering his room, Shi Feng didn’t have anything better to do, so he decided to take a closer look at the tattered leather pouch Ghost Hand dropped.

TL Notes:

Just to recap-

The Luminous Glory List only records players under 35 years old.
