Chapter 399 – Soul-Stirring Slash

TL Notes:

Changing “newcomer” -> “rookie” for Chapters 397 and 398

!!

…

The reserve participants in the arena were startled when they saw Chen Qilin jumping down from the second floor.

“What?! We’re starting with Vice Commander Qilin?!”

“If Vice Commander Qilin is going to be the first examiner, who would dare to take the test? I heard that the City Lord had granted Vice Commander Qilin the Legendary-ranked Demon God’s Armor for the upcoming city battle. If he has this Demon God’s Armor equipped, surviving even one move from him would be impossible, let alone ten…”

“The rookies’ top-ranker sure is unlucky. With this, he will be a benchwarmer for an entire year.”

When everyone saw Chen Qilin stepping onto the simulation ring and putting on the simulation device, they couldn’t help but sympathize with Shi Feng.

Chen Qilin was a well-known genius in Star Lake City. In terms of combat standards, he was a strong contender for the number one spot among the Star Lake Legion’s many vice commanders. After combining the piece of Legendary Equipment Chen Qilin had received from the City Lord, even the legion’s former commander might not be a match for him in simulation warfare.

In reality, if not for Red Frost’s sudden appearance, Chen Qilin would have been the most likely candidate to succeed the Star Lake Legion’s former commander.

So, to have someone like Chen Qilin play the examiner role was absurd. Compared to challenging the other vice commanders, anyone who took their basic test from Chen Qilin would have to face significantly greater difficulty. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

…

Hahaha! The heavens are on my side! Let’s see how my big brother will take care of you!

Chen Qitian’s mood brightened significantly when he saw Shi Feng walking into the same simulation ring as his elder brother. Although his elder brother had previously promised him that he would take care of Shi Feng, he had more or less given up on this idea after Shi Feng secured first place in the selection. While his elder brother might be a vice commander of the Star Lake Legion, he still could not afford to create too much trouble for such a talented rookie, especially not when Commander Red Frost and the City Lord were paying attention to Shi Feng. At most, his elder brother could create some trouble for Shi Feng during city battles or put Shi Feng in the position of a replacement member in an ace battle group.

However, all that changed with Red Frost’s arrangement. Now, Shi Feng shouldn’t even consider joining an ordinary battle group, let alone an ace battle group.

…

“What a pity.” Thousand Scars sighed as she looked into the simulation ring. “My plan to surpass him during city battles won’t be feasible anymore.”

Thousand Scars was aware of the conflict surrounding Chen Qilin and Shi Feng. There was no way Chen Qilin would let go of this opportunity to take revenge for his younger brother. So, he was most definitely going to use 100% of his strength to deal with Shi Feng.

Players might be limited to the same tier and level in simulation warfare, but they had to use their mental strength to materialize their own weapons and equipment. In other words, the stronger a player’s mental strength, the more advantageous of a position they would be in.

Not to mention, Chen Qilin was already at the Beyond Domain Realm in terms of combat standards. He was very close to matching pseudo-fifth-floor experts. In a situation where he had an advantage in equipment standards, there were zero chances of a titled expert surviving against him.

“There’s nothing to feel pity about,” Death Omen disdainfully said. “He wouldn’t be in this situation if he hadn’t provoked Chen Qitian that day. He is foolish to think he can go against a long-standing corporation simply because he has Black Flame backing him. The various corporations have countless geniuses under them. Even if Chen Qilin doesn’t deal with him today, there will be other geniuses from other corporations who will make him suffer.”

Thousand Scars nodded in agreement. At the same time, she celebrated the fact that she had joined the Paimon Conglomerate. Otherwise, she would’ve never been able to turn down the advances of young masters like Chen Qitian lest she wished to offend them.

…

At this time, Chen Qitian and Thousand Scars weren’t the only ones paying close attention to Shi Feng. The several experts who had entered the Greater World with Shi Feng similarly scrutinized Chen Qilin and Shi Feng.

On one side of the simulation ring was Chen Qilin wearing heavy armor and carrying a silver-gray greatsword on his back. Chen Qilin even had a five-meter-tall body, a clear indicator that he possessed an extraordinary race in God’s Domain.

On the other side was Shi Feng wearing jet-black light armor and wielding a charcoal-like longsword. At first glance, Shi Feng looked like an impoverished traveler. Although he had a body that was nearly two meters tall, he looked no different than an infant compared to Chen Qilin’s five-meter-tall frame.

“Purple Jade, I heard that you’ve talked to Vice Commander Fused Blood about inviting Guild Leader Shi to do city missions together, but I don’t think he’s going to qualify for those missions now,” Alice, the Witch of the West, said as she looked at the woman in sportswear standing next to her.

Tier 6 players were rare, even in the Greater God’s Domain. Thus, different from Tier 4 and Tier 5 participants, Tier 6 participants were much more valued by the various city legions. As evidence, shortly after they arrived in Star Lake City, the Star Lake Legion’s Tier 6 vice commanders had already tried to recruit them into their respective ace battle groups. It was why they never cared about Shi Feng securing first place in the selection.

Looking at the blonde, doll-like girl standing next to her, Purple Jade anxiously said, “Vice Commander Qilin might have extraordinary strength, but Shi Feng is no pushover, either. He should have no trouble surviving ten moves.”

“Ten moves?” After looking at Chen Qilin’s five-meter-tall body, Alice shook her head and said, “Look at Chen Qilin. He’s not even bothering to hide his Legendary Equipment. A Tier 3 instructor like Shi Feng would be fortunate if he could survive even one move.”

While Chen Qilin might have had his tier suppressed to Tier 4 to match Shi Feng, his equipment standard was vastly superior to Shi Feng’s. Not only was Chen Qilin fully clad in Fragmented Legendary Equipment, but he even had the Legendary-ranked Demon God’s Armor. With such equipment standards, he could even fight against Tier 5 experts, let alone a Tier 4 rookie.

…

In the simulation ring…

“Shi Feng, you might have won first place in the selection, but I’m going to show everyone here today that a genius is nothing more than a genius. Don’t get too conceited before you become a true powerhouse!” Chen Qilin said as he looked at the inconspicuous Swordsman before him. “Don’t worry. I won’t make things difficult for you. I’ll knock you out in one move!”

After saying so, Chen Qilin grabbed the greatsword on his back and charged at Shi Feng. Then, once he was within striking distance, he executed the Hurricane Slash combat technique, sending over 50 sword lights flying at Shi Feng. Chen Qilin’s Attack Speed was so overwhelming that it was impossible for the average Tier 4 player to even react to his attacks.

“One move?”

After looking at the incoming sword lights, Shi Feng casually swung the carbonized longsword in his hand.

The next moment, a black light flickered in the ring, which was followed by the sound of metal ringing. Then, a figure could be seen stumbling to the edge of the ring and stopping just in time to avoid instant disqualification.

Meanwhile, this figure belonged to none other than the five-meter-tall Chen Qilin. At this time, though, Chen Qilin’s confident expression was nowhere to be seen. Instead, replacing it was a look of confusion.

“My dear vice commander, don’t you think you are thinking too highly of yourself?”
