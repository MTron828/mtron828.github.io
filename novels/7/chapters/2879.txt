Chapter 2880 – God Mode Secret Land

“What bold words! I want to see just how far you can go!”

Beast Emperor watched with ridicule and complacency as Shi Feng entered the secret room. He was fully confident that the Evil God’s Secret Land would repel Shi Feng.

However, after Shi Feng entered the room...

One step... Two steps... Three steps...

Apparently unhindered by the oppression the pitch-black door exerted, Shi Feng advanced 20 steps without stopping. He showed no signs of discomfort whatsoever. It was as if the pressure that rendered even experts at the peak of Tier 4 helpless was nothing to him.

“???”

Confusion flooded Beast Emperor’s heart as he looked at Shi Feng.

What’s going on?

When Shi Feng arrived before the pitch-black door, let alone Beast Emperor, even Fire Dance and the others were stunned.

“How did you do it, Guild Leader?” Fire Dance asked, unable to contain her curiosity.

The intensity of the pressure she felt from the secret room was unprecedented. Even the Divine Might she experienced in Lightforged City could not compare. After taking three steps into the room, she could no longer advance by even another inch. She couldn’t even lift her feet.

While Tier 5 players were indeed stronger than Tier 4 players, the disparity shouldn’t be so significant. Logically, there was no way Shi Feng would remain unaffected by the room’s oppression.

At Fire Dance’s question, the other Zero Wing members also looked at Shi Feng curiously.

“How did I do it?” Seeing everyone’s curious expressions, Shi Feng smiled faintly and said, “I just walked here, of course. However, I did use a little technique.”

“Technique?” The Zero Wing members were momentarily stunned. They hadn’t seen anything peculiar about Shi Feng’s gait. He had merely walked to the door in a normal fashion. Moreover, how could a technique completely mitigate such terrifying pressure? However, when Beast Emperor heard Shi Feng’s words, he stared at the latter as if he had just seen a ghost. “No! Impossible! Who are you?! How can you know such a technique?!”

There was indeed a trick to approaching the pitch-black door. However, Beast Emperor had never told anyone this trick. He was the only player in God’s Domain who knew it.

Moreover, even if one knew the trick, one still couldn’t approach the door without the Evil God’s blessing.

Shi Feng couldn’t help rolling his eyes at Beast Emperor.

“The technique required to approach this door is indeed complicated, but do you think the fundamental technique to manipulate the various elements of Mana is unique to the Evil God’s Temple?”

When Shi Feng saw the pitch-black door and the hurdle Fire Dance and the others faced after entering the secret room, he quickly noticed a similarity between the secret room and the Dragon Temple’s trial area.

In the Dragon Temple’s trial, players had to construct a bridge using Mana’s various elements.

The secret room, on the other hand, was filled with chaotic Mana. The closer to the pitch-black door, the more chaotic the ambient Mana was. What players needed to do was return this chaotic Mana to its original state. Only by doing so could players approach the door.

Simply put, both places tested players’ usage of the various elements of Mana.

For Shi Feng, who had already mastered the basic usage of the various elements of Mana, approaching the pitch-black door was a walk in the park. It was much easier than the trial in the Dragon Temple, which had required him to expend a lot of Concentration and manipulate a significant amount of Mana. The secret room, on the other hand, did not put a burden on his Concentration or require him to manipulate a lot of Mana.

“The secret land aside, this room is quite a good training spot for those seeking to learn the basic usage of the various elements of Mana.” Scrutinizing the secret room, Shi Feng said happily, “I was worrying about how to help everyone accomplish this, so this saves me a lot of time.”

It wasn’t easy to learn to manipulate the various elements of Mana independently. Even if he provided Zero Wing’s members with an explanation, the learning process would be highly inefficient without a reference. They could be taking a dead end for all they knew. The secret room just so happened to provide players with an environment for testing their application of the various elements of Mana. It was undoubtedly a precious training ground.

One would also have an easier time getting promoted to Tier 5 if they trained here, as having the ability to manipulate the individual elements of Mana was crucial in constructing a Tier 5 Mana Body.

When Beast Emperor heard Shi Feng’s words, he promptly fainted.

Ignoring the unconscious Beast Emperor, Shi Feng set his sights on the pitch-black door.

The door was five meters tall and two meters wide, made of a material Shi Feng didn’t recognize. When he opened the door, a pitch-black whirlpool greeted him. The vortex exuded Divine Might, and players at Tier 4 or below shouldn’t even think of setting foot into this whirlpool.

After Shi Feng inspected the whirlpool with Omniscient Eyes, a few lines of information appeared before him.

(Evil God’s Secret Land]

God Mode Secret Land

Raid Level 150-200

What a powerful secret land! The displayed information astonished Shi Feng. Now, he understood why Beast Emperor was confident he couldn’t obtain the Evil God’s Secret Land.

Secret Lands were like Dungeons in God’s Domain. The higher their ranking, the higher their raid difficulty. God Mode was the highest difficulty for secret lands. Unlike Dungeons, though, secret lands would not reset.

According to Shi Feng’s memories, there were less than ten Level 150-plus God Mode Secret Lands in the entire God’s Domain. Meanwhile, even Tier 6 God-ranked experts could fall in a Level 150-plus God Mode Secret Land!

However, countless player forces would seek to enter a Level 150-plus God Mode Secret Land. It was also a place all Tier 5 players had to enter.

This was because these secret lands held clues to the Tier 6 promotion! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Which player who had climbed to Tier 5 wouldn’t wish to advance further and reach Tier 6?

Hence, God’s Domain’s various forces would fight over any Level 150-plus, God Mode Secret Land that appeared.

It seems I’ll now have to defend Ancient Rock City, no matter what. Shi Feng sighed as he looked at the Evil God’s Secret Land.

Due to the Outerworld forces’ invasion, he had intended to defend Ancient Rock City only temporarily. After all, Zero Wing had limited combat power. In its current state, just defending the Guild Cities it already had from the Outerworld’s player and NPC forces would be difficult. Adding Ancient Rock City to the list would only make things even more difficult for the Guild.

However, the Evil God’s Secret Land was extraordinary. Shi Feng might’ve ignored it if it were only an Asura Mode Secret Land, but a Level 150-plus God Mode Secret Land was something he had to protect at all costs. After all, finding another secret land of such caliber wouldn’t be easy, even for him.

The entrances of Level 150-plus God Mode Secret Lands typically appeared at random locations and existed for only a set period. Thus, none of the superpowers in his previous life had ever managed to occupy a Level 150-plus God Mode Secret Land.

On the other hand, the entrance to the Evil God’s Secret Land in Ancient Rock City was fixed. This increased the entrance’s value drastically. Moreover, this Evil God’s Secret Land might very well hold the key to Shi Feng’s promotion to Tier 6.

Following this, Zero Wing’s logistics members began ransacking Saint’s Hand’s Warehouse, while Shi Feng taught Fire Dance and the others the fundamental technique to manipulate Mana’s various elements.

Like so, four hours went by in the blink of an eye, and Shi Feng received a notification.

System: Congratulations! You have become Ancient Rock City’s ruler. Do you wish to reconstruct Ancient Rock City?

“Reconstruct!” Shi Feng said in a determined tone.

System: A God Mode Secret Land has been discovered. Do you wish to integrate the secret land with Ancient Rock City?
