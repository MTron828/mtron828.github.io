Chapter 2878 – Ancient Rock City’s Secret

Fire Dragon Empire, Flame Dragon City, Mythology’s Residence:

A Tier 3 Ranger barged into the meeting room occupied by Mythology’s executives, earning the dissatisfaction of Situ Qingtian and the others in the room.

Looking at the Ranger, Situ Qingtian asked in a displeased tone, “Did something happen?”

“It’s news of Zero Wing!” the Ranger said hurriedly. “According to your orders, we’ve kept tabs on Zero Wing. However, just a moment ago, Zero Wing...destroyed Ancient Rock City!”

Upon hearing the Ranger’s words, Cold Shadow responded dubiously, “Impossible! It’s only been around ten minutes since Zero Wing arrived at Ancient Rock City! Even if Black Flame is Tier 5, they can’t possibly capture the city so quickly!”

Ancient Rock City was Beast Emperor’s base, and the man had long since armed the city to the teeth. Beast Emperor also had the Evil God’s Temple’s backing, a powerful existence capable of going against the War God’s Temple. Although Shi Feng was a Tier 5 player, capturing Ancient Rock City should be tough. “No! Vice Guild Leader, Zero Wing didn’t capture Ancient Rock City! It razed the entire city in one blow! Ancient Rock City is now a ruin!” the Ranger countered, shaking his head. He then took out a Magic Crystal Recorder and placed it on the meeting table. “This is the battle video we received.”

Immediately, the Magic Crystal Recorder projected the image of a Dragon. With just one breath attack, this Dragon leveled the entire Ancient Rock City, leaving nothing unscathed. “A Tier 4 Divine Dragon!”

“It managed to destroy the entire Ancient Rock City in one hit?”

Deathly silence enveloped the meeting room momentarily as Mythology’s executives stared at the video projection with gloomy expressions. Shock and fear also surfaced in their eyes. Their astonishment was so obvious that even the reporting Tier 3 Ranger could sense it.

No wonder... No wonder he dared refuse our two Guilds’ partnership... So this is the reason for his confidence... Cold Shadow looked at the Tier 4 Divine Dragon and the ruined Ancient Rock City in the video with complicated feelings.

Shi Feng had been a minor character unworthy of her attention in the past when Zero Wing was a Guild reliant on external items to defend its territories. Yet, both Shi Feng and Zero Wing were now bona fide titans that even Mythology could not and would not dare to offend.

What was even more laughable was that just a moment ago, Mythology’s executives had been discussing how to take revenge on Zero Wing in secret. Now, however... Black Flame! I indeed underestimated you before! Situ Qingtian’s gaze grew cold as he looked at the video projection. Repressing the reluctance in his heart, he uttered slowly, “Temporarily halt all retaliation against Zero Wing we discussed before!”

Practically every superpower in God’s Domain had heard about Shi Feng killing Situ Qingtian in Zero Wing City. As a result, Situ Qingtian’s reputation had taken a nosedive. Although Situ Qingtian yearned to take revenge on Zero Wing, he knew full well that doing so right now would be no different from suicide. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

With the combined strength of a Tier 5 player and such a frightening Divine Dragon, Zero Wing could destroy every Guild City in God’s Domain.

“Dammit! Are we going to let Zero Wing go, just like that?” a Mythology executive complained in a hate-filled voice.

Situ Qingtian shook his head. Looking at Shi Feng’s projected image, he sneered, “Of course not! There is only one thing we need to do now, and that is wait! We wait until the start of the second war! Even if Zero Wing has Black Flame and that Divine Dragon, it still can’t stop the Outerworld’s advance!

“Also, start searching ancient ruins for clues to the Tier 5 promotion! Spare no cost at all! We must have our own Tier 5!” Although Situ Qingtian did not wish to admit it, the era of Tier 4 was already over. Tier 5 players would rule the future. If Mythology did not have its own Tier 5 player, its position as one of the Five Great Super Guilds would be in danger.

Shortly after Situ Qingtian issued his command, the other superpowers of God’s Domain also issued similar commands. They frantically searched ancient ruins for clues to help their Tier 4 experts get promoted to Tier 5 as quickly as possible while quietly awaiting the arrival of the second War of Worlds.

Meanwhile, inside the Orc Empire’s Ancient Rock City, Fire Dance and the other Tier 4 experts of Zero Wing finally killed the two surviving Faux Saint Slayers. The deaths of the two Superior Mythic monsters granted everyone a generous amount of EXP, and they all managed to gain at least one level.

However, compared to the EXP the Faux Saint Slayers contributed, Shi Feng was more interested in the pitch-black stones the two monsters dropped after death.

Previously, whenever players killed Mythic ranked Faux Saint monsters, the player who landed the finishing blow would have a dark-gray mist invade their body. This gray mist would increase the player’s affinity with Mana for a lengthy period.

This was also why Shi Feng had not taken action against the Faux Saint Slayers and had instead allowed Fire Dance and the others to kill the two monsters.

Yet, the two Slayers did not release any mist from their bodies. Instead, they each dropped a fist-sized stone.

What dense Soul Energy!

Shi Feng was surprised when he spread his senses across the two black stones.

When his Concentration had reached Tier 5, his soul had also undergone a qualitative improvement. It was akin to his soul liquefying. However, compared to the Soul Energy in the pitch-black stone, his Soul Energy was nothing. After all, these two stones were solidified Soul Energy.

“Guild Leader, are those things useful?” Cola asked curiously as he looked at the black stones in Shi Feng’s hands.

“More than that!” Smiling, Shi Feng said to Zero Wing’s members, “They’re even better than Fragmented Legendary items! Is there anyone here with Concentration at the Tier 4 Peak standard?”

After Zero Wing’s members exchanged glances, only Violet Cloud stepped forward.

“Guild Leader, my Concentration reached the Tier 4 Peak standard recently. However, the two Vice Guild Leaders should’ve reached this standard too.”

“Good! Take this soul stone. Afterward, find a quiet place and eat it. It should increase your Concentration standard. If you’re lucky, you might even raise it to Tier 5,” Shi Feng said as he handed one of the black stones to Violet Cloud. He then said to the others, “If anyone else manages to reach the Tier 4 Peak standard, you can get this soul stone from

me.”

The other Zero Wing members nodded their heads, none of them objecting to Shi Feng’s method of distribution.

However, when Beast Emperor, who was restrained in a corner, saw Shi Feng’s actions, he dearly wanted to strangle Shi Feng to death. Shi Feng was actually treating the two Faux Saint Slayers’ cores as a snack and letting others eat them. This was simply outrageous!

He had fed the two Faux Saint Slayers the souls of tens of thousands of Tier 3 players to transform their cores into a Soul Core.

So long as he had a Soul Core, he could create another Faux Saint Slayer. Yet, Violet Cloud received one of these Soul Cores as a snack.

“Black Flame! You’ll pay for this!” Beast Emperor bellowed as he glared at Shi Feng. “It doesn’t matter even if you caught me! The Evil God’s Temple’s rise is already a foregone conclusion! At that time, the Faux Saint army will devour everyone from Zero Wing!”

“Foregone conclusion?” Shi Feng laughed. Looking at the restrained Beast Emperor, he pointed at the ruined Saint’s Hand Residence in the distance and asked, “Are you talking about that secret land beneath your Guild Residence?”

“I-I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Beast Emperor stammered in a panic.

“No need to pretend. Do you think Tier 5 is a joke?” Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Beast Emperor.

While Ancient Rock City’s defensive magic array was still active, Shi Feng hadn’t been able to sense the secret land’s existence. However, with the defensive magic array gone, nothing in Ancient Rock City could hide from his Tier 5 World Creation Mana Domain.

Moreover, Shi Feng had already been suspicious about how Beast Emperor had managed to develop Ancient Rock City to its current level. Zero Wing had poured an astronomical amount of resources into developing Stone Forest City and Zero Wing City. Yet, the two cities were still stuck as Intermediate Cities, far from becoming Advanced Cities. So, how did Ancient Rock City develop into an Advanced City that was close to becoming a Main City?

Only a fool wouldn’t suspect there was a secret behind this achievement!

“Black Flame!” Beast Emperor was momentarily enraged at Shi Feng’s ridicule. However, he soon calmed down and said, “So what if you’ve discovered the Evil God’s Secret Land? Do you think you can defend it? Even if you’ve captured me, I will still spread this information to the entire God’s Domain! At that time, even the Outerworld forces will be drawn here! Do you think you can stop all of them?”

The Evil God’s Secret Land was originally his biggest secret and something he had invested heavily in. This secret land was also why he had gained his current power.

Although the Evil God’s Secret Land would be of significantly less help to those not belonging to the Evil God’s Temple, the benefits were still enough to drive everyone in God’s Domain wild.

“How would I know if I don’t try?”

Suddenly, Shi Feng executed a slash at Furious Fist, instantly killing him. As Furious Fist collapsed reluctantly to the ground and transformed into countless particles of light, two items appeared in his place.

Of the two items Furious Fist dropped, one was a piece of Epic Equipment, while the other was a token.

“You!” Beast Emperor’s complexion paled when he saw the token.

This token was none other than Ancient Rock City’s City Lord’s Token. With this token, one could take control of Ancient Rock City. Only, Beast Emperor couldn’t figure out how Shi Feng knew Furious Fist had held the City Lord’s Token.

“It seems my luck is good.” Shi Feng was a little surprised when he saw the City Lord’s Token. “It dropped on the first kill.”

Beast Emperor nearly fainted when he heard Shi Feng’s words.

What Beast Emperor didn’t know was that aside from Beast Emperor, everyone else held no value as prisoners in Shi Feng’s opinion. Meanwhile, the City Lord’s Token couldn’t be taken out of the city. Otherwise, it would be automatically teleported back to the City Lord’s Mansion after some time. And with how precious the City Lord’s Token was, Beast Emperor naturally wouldn’t leave it to just anyone. The person holding the token would have to be a Tier 4 Guild executive of Saint’s Hand at the very least.

Hence, if Furious Fist hadn’t dropped the City Lord’s Token, Shi Feng would have killed Saint’s Hand’s Tier 4 experts one by one until it dropped.

The instant Shi Feng picked up the City Lord’s Token, a system notification rang in his ears.
