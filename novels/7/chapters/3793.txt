Chapter 868 – Holy City Shaken

“Another one?”

“Since when did Nightmare Holy City have so many experts?”

The Pale Horn members, who were preparing to flee, were stopped by Shi Feng’s might. They felt that the world must have gone crazy.

Since when could a Level 212 player one-shot dozens of Level 230-plus experts?

They had never thought there could be such a large gap between players. Even the infallible zerg tactic had been thoroughly shattered.

A second ago, the White Dragon Nation still had over 200 experts encircling Shi Feng’s party. A second later, only a few dozen of these experts remained standing. Moreover, these few dozen players managed to stay alive only because their instincts prompted them to activate their lifesaving measures in the nick of time. Otherwise, they would have been charred or reduced to ashes like their allies.

“M-Monsters!”

“Run! These people are monsters!”

It was unknown which White Dragon Nation member called for retreat, but when the other White Dragon Nation members heard it, they turned around and fled without hesitation. They also didn’t forget to escape in different directions, knowing that if they tried to escape as one, nobody would make it out alive.

However, Shi Feng did not bother to chase the fleeing White Dragon Nation members. Instead, he sheathed the Shadow Incinerator and activated the Miniature Abyssal World.

Suddenly, everyone within a thousand yards of Shi Feng felt the world around them darken. The fleeing White Dragon Nation members, in particular, felt like they were caught in a quagmire. No matter how they struggled, they could only move sluggishly, and their HP kept decreasing.

One second… Two seconds… Three seconds…

In just a few seconds, the surviving White Dragon Nation members silently collapsed like puppets that had their strings cut, becoming deader than dead.

Isn’t he…a Swordsman? When Whirlwind Bulwark saw Shi Feng eliminate the remaining White Dragon Nation members without lifting a finger, he couldn’t help but doubt his understanding of God’s Domain.

Setting aside the huge level gap, it should be known that the White Dragon Nation member closest to Shi Feng was over 200 yards away, while the farthest was over 600 yards away. They even escaped in different directions. Yet, Shi Feng killed them nonetheless. With such capabilities, how was anyone supposed to escape Shi Feng?

Even zerg tactics would lose their purpose before him…

Meanwhile, the other Pale Horn members looked at Shi Feng in awe and fear. Although they had met many experts in the past, none were as terrifying as Shi Feng. Moreover, he had other experts who were equally terrifying…

Initially, they didn’t think much of Shi Feng’s party. After all, the party’s highest-level member was only Level 230. This starkly contrasted with their team, which consisted of only Level 230-plus players. Whirlwind Bulwark, their commander, was even Level 235. Now, though, when they saw Shi Feng’s party looting the charred corpses and gradually moving closer to them, they got goosebumps. It felt like a bunch of almighty gods were inching toward them.

At this time, though, Shi Feng was similarly thunderstruck. This was because of the Taboo Weapons and Equipment he looted from the White Dragon Nation’s members. Excluding a few outliers, over 95% of them were made by players…

Moreover, among these Taboo Weapons and Equipment, even the worst reached the Level 230 Epic rank, while the best reached the Level 235 Fragmented Legendary rank. Players could only dream of obtaining these items in the Greater God’s Domain. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

In the current Greater God’s Domain, even the Seven Luminaries Alliance, known for being the best weapon and equipment manufacturer, could only produce up to Level 230 Epic Equipment. For most Level 230 experts, Level 230 Epic Equipment was the best equipment they could get their hands on, as it was comparable to ordinary Legendary Equipment.

Unfortunately, even the Seven Luminaries Alliance could only produce Level 230 Epic Equipment in very small quantities. This was for two reasons.

Firstly, the materials needed were rare, and many could only be obtained from Taboo Dungeons. Thus, mass production was out of the question.

Secondly, the production success rate was abysmal, which increased the production cost to a point where it would be cheaper to simply buy Legendary Equipment.

As for Level 235 Fragmented Legendary Weapons and Equipment, nobody in the Greater God’s Domain could produce them. It was also nearly impossible for them to find alternatives.

In terms of Basic Attributes, Level 235 Fragmented Legendary Equipment was comparable to Level 230 Taboo Legendary Equipment. Every piece of Level 230 Taboo Legendary Equipment was the fruit of many Taboo Dungeon runs. Due to its rarity, the various apex powers’ executives wouldn’t have more than a few pieces each, while ordinary core members were not qualified to own any.

Yet, most of the Taboo Weapons and Equipment the White Dragon Nation members dropped were made by players. When it came to weapon and equipment manufacturing, the remnant primordial world was leagues above the Greater God’s Domain.

While Shi Feng was busy looting, Whirlwind Bulwark took the initiative to approach him.

“I am Whirlwind Bulwark, the commander of the Pale Horn adventurer team. Thank you for saving us from the White Dragon Nation,” Whirlwind Bulwark said gratefully. “If you need any assistance in Nightmare Holy City in the future, please feel free to ask. I will do my best to help.”

Pale Horn might not be a first-tier adventurer team, but it was still one of the more well-known adventurer teams in Nightmare Holy City. And although Pale Horn might only have 20 members, they were all top-tier experts. Thus, they could still help with resolving small issues in the Holy City.

The other Pale Horn members nodded in agreement. While they might be afraid of Shi Feng’s party, they were also keen on establishing a connection with the party.

The White Dragon Nation was a behemoth of an existence in Nightmare Holy City. Yet, Shi Feng’s party had handily eliminated over 200 of the White Dragon Nation’s experts while being heavily disadvantaged in levels. It was the dream of many players to be acquainted with monstrous experts like Shi Feng and his party members.

Nightmare Holy City? After pondering for a moment, Shi Feng asked, “Brother Bulwark, could you give us a detailed introduction to Nightmare Holy City?”

Shi Feng didn’t have the slightest knowledge about this remnant primordial world. He only came here because of Kalisha’s Blessing, which activated the Underground City’s God Mode.

Although he didn’t know how challenging the God Mode Underground City was, he knew he needed to collect 30 million Undying Souls in 30 days. Otherwise, his account would be crippled.

Thus, the first thing he needed to do was figure out the situation. Only then could he collect Undying Souls more efficiently.

“An introduction?” Shi Feng’s question stunned Whirlwind Bulwark. Then, he suddenly realized something as he looked at Shi Feng’s level and asked with a dazed expression, “Could it be… Are you not from Nightmare Holy City?”

Besides Whirlwind Bulwark, the other Pale Horn members were also filled with disbelief as they looked at Shi Feng and his party.

It was a well-known fact that Nightmare Holy City was the only hospitable location in this region. Nobody could leave this region unless the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss was defeated.

“That’s right. We aren’t players from this region,” Shi Feng said, nodding. He didn’t feel a need to hide this fact. After all, players couldn’t simply remain in their starting worlds forever. As their levels and strength increased, they would eventually find a way out.

Additionally, even if Pale Horn’s members found out about his party’s origins, they could not harm his party. They even stood to benefit from working with his party.

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s answer, realization dawned on Whirlwind Bulwark and the others. They finally understood why they had never heard of Shi Feng’s party despite being so strong. However, after realizing this, they also couldn’t help but feel dejected. It was especially so for Whirlwind Bulwark.

Whirlwind Bulwark considered himself a powerful expert. After all, he was regarded as one of Nightmare Holy City’s top ten Guardian Knights. Even if he were to move to another region, he believed he would still be at the top. But after meeting Shi Feng’s party, he realized that he was sorely mistaken. The other regions definitely had experts who were far more extraordinary than he had imagined.

However, what Whirlwind Bulwark and the others did not know was that Shi Feng’s party didn’t come from another region of this remnant primordial world. Instead, they came from the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Moreover, even among the Greater God’s Domain’s apex experts, Shi Feng and his party members could be considered powerful.

Subsequently, Whirlwind Bulwark began introducing Nightmare Holy City in detail.

…

While Whirlwind Bulwark shared his knowledge with Shi Feng’s party, the White Dragon Nation’s move against the Pale Horn adventurer team was exposed and sparked an uproar in Nightmare Holy City. After all, the outcome was simply unbelievable.

Despite going after Pale Horn with over 200-plus experts, Fira’s team failed to kill any of the adventurer team’s members and was even annihilated by a mysterious six-man party…
