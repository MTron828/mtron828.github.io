Chapter 28 – God’s First Appearance

As Tyrian’s unreconciled scream faded from the plaza, silence suddenly enveloped the entire battlefield.

“Is she dead?”

“Did we do it?”

Whether it was Shi Feng’s students or Soulfire’s members, everyone looked at Tyrian’s motionless body on the ground, anticipation and apprehension filling their hearts.

After hours of continuous combat, everyone had long since grown exhausted. They were merely holding on by virtue of their willpower. Meanwhile, as the Boss of a Hell Mode Regional Dungeon, a Realm Lord, and a Mythic ranked Primordial Archaic Species, there was no way Tyrian would fall so easily no matter how they looked at it.

Not to mention, it wasn’t unprecedented for powerful Bosses to resurrect with full health after death. Many teams had suffered huge losses because they did not expect the Bosses they raided to have such an ability.

Thus, even if a Boss in God’s Domain died, one couldn’t simply write it off as dead.

At this time, one of Soulfire’s team leaders asked Southern Captain, “Captain, this Boss should be fully dead, right?”

As soon as this party leader posed his question, many of the other Soulfire members around him turned to look at Southern Tiger with curious gazes as well.

Although they were all main force members of Soulfire, they were merely the adventurer team’s eleventh main force that Southern Tiger managed. When it came to raiding powerful Bosses, they weren’t as experienced as Southern Tiger. This was because Southern Tiger would often follow Soulfire’s head captain on hunts for Tier 5 Bosses. He had even fought against a Tier 5 Dragon before.

Met with everyone’s expectant gazes, Southern Tiger was momentarily at a loss for words. Just as he was opening his mouth to say something, he suddenly closed his mouth again, a heavy expression appearing on his face as he noticed cracks appearing on Tyrian’s body. Immediately afterward, streaks of dazzling purple light escaped from these cracks.

Additionally, as the cracks on Tyrian’s body increased in size and number, an indescribably powerful aura also spread out from Tyrian’s body. This new aura was magnitudes stronger than Tyrian’s original aura, and everyone felt as if they had just been put into a solid block of steel, their bodies becoming immobilized…

“No way! She really resurrected?!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This is cheating! How are we even supposed to beat her?!”

Qin Wuchen and the others couldn’t help but be dumbfounded by this situation. Even Wu Lingling, who had the toughest spirit out of Shi Feng’s students, couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile in this situation.

With everyone’s present conditions, they couldn’t even beat Tyrian in her original state, let alone her strengthened state.

Is this a Primordial Archaic Species’ ability?

At this time, even Shi Feng couldn’t help but frown as he looked at Tyrian hovering in the air. Although he could still use his Mana Domain to suppress Tyrian, over half of the team already had their Concentration pushed to their limits.

Apart from Stamina, the other Hidden Attribute that restricted players’ bodies was Concentration. If players had their Concentration reduced to a certain level, even if they still had plenty of Stamina to spare, they would still lose control over their bodies, becoming unable to lift even a finger.

However, just when Shi Feng was pondering whether they should retreat, Tyrian suddenly exploded into a dazzling brilliance that enveloped the entire plaza, nay, the entire city. Despite the sky being dimly lit just a moment ago, it had now become as bright as day.

A moment later, a dazzling figure had walked out of the epicenter of the light explosion. Then, a staircase made of light formed under this person’s feet, and this person slowly walked down to the plaza. Meanwhile, this person was none other than Tyrian. Only, at this time, her wings had already disappeared. Moreover, her expression was no longer the same as before. Rather than anger, her face now depicted indifference, her eyes containing neither joy nor sorrow.

With each step Tyrian took down the staircase, everyone on the plaza could feel the pressure on their bodies increasing. By the time Tyrian had stepped onto the plaza, the intensity of her aura had also reached its peak, causing everyone but Shi Feng and Southern Tiger to involuntarily collapse onto the ground…

Divine Might?! How is this possible?!

Southern Tigers’ eyes were filled with incredulity as he looked at Tyrian, his body doing its best to resist the mental pressure exerted by her frightening aura.

Divine Might!

It was a name given to the auras radiated by Gods in God’s Domain. It was an aura capable of making all creatures beneath Tier 6 submit and grow fearful.

At this time, let alone Southern Tiger, even Shi Feng couldn’t help but be shocked. He never thought that the Mythic ranked Tyrian would be a Tier 6 God!

Tier 6 Gods were existences standing at the absolute apex of God’s Domain. Even a Tier 6 God-ranked expert would have no choice but to flee if they faced a Tier 6 God in a one-on-one situation. At least a group of Tier 6 God-ranked experts would be needed to contend against such an existence.

Meanwhile, such an existence had actually appeared in the Miniature Ancient World. Moreover, the location of her advent was merely a Level 100 Regional Dungeon…

As for the people on the ground, they, too, wore dumbfounded expressions on their faces. Although they couldn’t move their bodies right now, they possessed a certain degree of understanding toward Divine Might. Moreover, seeing as Tyrian had managed to suppress them to such an extent using her aura alone proved that she could only be a Tier 6 God and nothing else.

A God!

An actual Tier 6 God!

Am I dreaming?

Shock was the only thing present in everyone’s minds right now as they looked at Tyrian. They were so shocked that even their previous despair and helplessness had disappeared.

Tier 6 Gods were practically myths in God’s Domain. Most players could only see a Tier 6 God through the videos recorded by some Tier 6 God-ranked experts. Meanwhile, every time a Tier 6 God appeared would also result in a great upheaval in God’s Domain.

This was because apart from representing the apex of strength in God’s Domain, Gods also represented the biggest opportunity players could find!

However, among the fallen crowd, one person paid less attention to Tyrian and paid more attention to Shi Feng. Meanwhile, this person was none other than Wu Lingling.

Who exactly is Instructor Shi?

Confusion and curiosity filled Wu Lingling as she looked at Shi Feng, who remained unperturbed in front of Tyrian.

Logically, a Tier 6 God’s Divine Might shouldn’t be something Tier 3 players could withstand. Although resisting a God’s Divine Might mainly depended on one’s willpower, Basic Attributes still played an important role. Meanwhile, even a famous expert like Southern Tiger was barely keeping himself on his feet. Yet, Shi Feng, whose Basic Attributes were vastly inferior to Southern Tiger, remained in his normal state.

While Wu Lingling tried to make sense of Shi Feng’s composure, Tyrian also looked toward Shi Feng, a hint of surprise appearing on her face.

“Interesting,” Tyrian whispered under her breath, the corners of her mouth lifting slightly. Then she softly said to everyone present, “I didn’t think you mortals would dare trespass here and even defeat my doppelganger. Normally, I would’ve bequeathed you with eternal death, but I will spare you as an acknowledgment of your glory as the victors. You can also take this treasure chest as a reward for your efforts. However, should you step into this place again, you will be turned into dust forever!”

After saying so, Tyrian gently waved her hand, summoning a gigantic spatial rift above the plaza. Immediately afterward, a powerful suction force pulled everyone into the spatial rift, removing them from the plaza.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng and the others had disappeared, Tyrian looked up into the sky. Specifically, she was looking at the place beyond the sky.

“Has the time finally come?”

Tyrian silently whispered a sentence before disappearing from the plaza as well.

At the same time as Tyrian vanished from the plaza, the outside of the Withered Ruins had also exploded with commotion!
