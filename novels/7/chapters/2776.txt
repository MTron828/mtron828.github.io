Chapter 2777 – Shocking Skyflare

A dark void enveloped the battlefield. Let alone Tier 3 players, even Tier 4 players couldn’t survive in this space.

Meanwhile, when Skyflare’s executives, seated in the spectator stands, saw this scene, they were dumbfounded.

“How can one slash carry such destructive power?”

“Even those Tier 4 NPCs aren’t capable of exhibiting such power! Is he really just a Tier 4 player?!”

“He has such terrifying strength, yet we actually failed to find any information on him. Just who is he?”

After a moment of silence, Skyflare’s executives began a heated discussion among themselves as they goggled at the battlefield’s shattered space. At this time, they no longer underestimated Shi Feng in the slightest. Now, only shock and fear filled their hearts.

With such terrifying combat power, Shi Feng was no longer an opponent vulnerable to zerg tactics. Only powerful Tier 4 NPCs could match him.

He was actually so strong?!

Yu Luo’s eyes were also wide with disbelief as she looked at the shattered space. Even Angelica Teresa’s strongest attack would fall short of Shi Feng’s from what she could tell.

Angelica Teresa was a Peak-rank Tier 4 existence and one of the top five powerhouses of Meteorite City. In addition, as an NPC, the items and Basic Attributes she possessed were also far superior to players’.

Yet, Shi Feng had actually executed an attack way stronger than even Angelica Teresa’s strongest attack.

“Commander!”

“The commander couldn’t have fallen, right?” After a while, Wind Chaser and the others snapped out of their daze and searched hurriedly for Lionheart’s figure in the dark void. Out of the player attacks they had seen thus far, Shi Feng’s was undoubtedly the strongest. Even Tier 4 NPCs were unlikely to be capable of executing such an attack. Hence, although they knew that Lionheart possessed a heaven-defying Defense, they couldn’t help doubting his ability to survive Shi Feng’s attack.

After everyone had searched for some time, the shattered space gradually recovered. Two vague figures appeared, standing in the recovering space, with one of them looking incredibly miserable.

“This is great! The commander is still alive!”

“I knew the commander could withstand it! He is Meteorite’s Wall, after all! There’s no way he can be one-shotted by a player!”

When Skyflare’s members saw Lionheart’s figure, they immediately grew excited.

However, unlike his colleagues, Lionheart did not feel happy or excited at all. Instead, his heart pounded with fear and relief.

That was too close. If not for the Windwall Ring, I would’ve definitely been one-shotted. Lionheart smiled bitterly when he looked at his remaining HP.

Currently, he had less than six million HP remaining. While this might seem like a lot, he had only managed to retain this amount of HP thanks to the Windwall Ring’s Passive Skill.

The Windwall Ring’s Passive Skill, Wind’s Protection, was capable of reducing all the damage he received by 35%. Even if he received a Tier 5 attack, its damage would still be reduced by a full 35%. Wind’s Protection was also the Windwall Ring’s only Skill.

The Windwall Ring was different from other equipment with Passive Damage Reduction Skills. Although the alternatives might even have Skills offering much greater reductions than Wind’s Protection on paper, there were hidden limits to these Skills. Generally, their upper limit was Tier 4; once an attack reached the Tier 4 standard, their effect would be significantly weaker. And against Tier 5 attacks, their effect was practically negligible.

However, that was not the case for the Windwall Ring’s Wind’s Protection. The Skill’s description clearly stated that it could reduce the damage of even Tier 5 attacks by 35% and not 1% less.

On the other side, after Shi Feng executed Holy Devour, his complexion had paled significantly.

Is it still too much to execute this move?

When Shi Feng sensed that more than half of his Concentration had disappeared, he was shocked.

He had already developed his Epic Mana Body to 110% Completion Rate, yet he still had trouble gathering and condensing the Mana required to execute Holy Devour. For a moment, he couldn’t help imagining what kind of power he could exhibit if he successfully executed the Third Sword, Holy Annihilation.

Tier 5?

Tier 6?

Regardless, this is a good result. At the very least, I can now use the complete Holy Devour. Now, I should be able to cope, even against a Half-step Demon King. As Shi Feng sheathed the Abyssal Blade, he was satisfied with his previous attack.

Although his Mana had undergone a qualitative transformation, thanks to the improvement of his Mana Body, the improvement this change brought to his Skills and Spells was limited. It wasn’t enough for them to undergo a qualitative transformation. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, it was a different story for Mana Techniques, whose power was highly dependent on the quality of the Mana used. Now, if he went all-out, he could execute an attack at the Tier 5 standard. The only drawback of Holy Devour was the huge burden it placed on his Concentration. Even at peak condition, he could execute the complete Holy Devour only once. Nevertheless, it was already more than enough as a trump card.

As Shi Feng was savoring the experience of executing Holy Devour, Lionheart approached him.

“Brother Black Flame, that move of yours really is ruthless. If I hadn’t gained some improvements recently, I would’ve really died,” Lionheart said jocularly.

At this moment, Lionheart no longer underestimated or looked at Shi Feng with contempt; only respect was present in his eyes. The fact that Shi Feng had managed to execute such a move as a player meant that he already stood at the apex of the entire God’s Domain. Just this point alone was already more than enough to earn him everyone’s respect. In God’s Domain, strength was everything. It was also something that could not be faked. For Shi Feng to have developed himself to this extent, he must’ve experienced countless trials and hardships.

“You’re too humble, Commander Lionheart. The fact that you managed to block my attack is all due to your own ability, not luck.” Looking at Lionheart, Shi Feng added, “Now that our one-hit agreement is complete, according to our previous arrangement, I will supply the Crystals of Souls and Soul Water to only the Skyflare adventurer team for Meteorite City’s side.”

“Thank you. As for the matter of Magic Crystals, please rest assured. The Skyflare adventurer team definitely won’t let you down, Brother Black Flame.” Lionheart couldn’t help feeling a little happy at Shi Feng’s words.

With Shi Feng willing to partner with Skyflare, Skyflare would be able to take full control of Meteorite City easily.

“Next, let’s talk about the specifics of our transaction.” Going straight to the point, Shi Feng said, “Like I said before, so long as you manage to withstand one hit from me, I will agree to partner with you, Commander Lionheart. However, after we start our cooperation, I’ll need your help with something.

“Of course, I won’t have you help me for nothing. In exchange, I’ll sell the Crystals of Souls at 150,000 Magic Crystals each to Skyflare. How about it?” “One hundred and fifty thousand each?” Lionheart was slightly tempted. “May I know what you need help with?”.

Previously, when he offered to purchase the Crystals of Souls at 200,000 Magic Crystals each, the price was actually a little too high for Skyflare to bear. However, the Crystals of Souls were far too important. They would also play a crucial role when Skyflare attempted to conquer other Main Cities. Hence, he had gone through with the price.

Lowering the price to 150,000 Magic Crystals each would definitely alleviate a lot of Skyflare’s burden.

“Help me kill a Boss,” Shi Feng said, smiling.

The reason Shi Feng wanted to test Lionheart wasn’t just to experiment with the power of his upgraded Mana Body. He had also wished to see whether Lionheart could withstand the attack of a Tier 4 Infant Dragon. After all, if he didn’t have anyone capable of tanking a hit from a Tier 4 Infant Dragon, slaying it would be utterly impossible.

Since Lionheart clearly met this requirement, combined with the effects of the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath, challenging an unrestrained Tier 4 Infant Dragon was entirely feasible.

“Kill a Boss?” Lionheart was a little puzzled. He never thought Shi Feng’s request would be so simple. “Is this Boss very strong?”

“Very strong.” Not bothering to hide the truth, Shi Feng said, “It’s a Tier 4 Infant Dragon!” “A Tier 4 Infant Dragon?” Lionheart gasped at Shi Feng’s words. Immediately, he thought of something and asked, “Are you referring to the one Lady Angelica is trying to challenge?” “That’s right. It’s that one.” Shi Feng nodded. “Actually, this matter is also beneficial to you as well, Commander Lionheart. After all, Meteorite City’s promotion will attract more players and resources to the city. At that time, Skyflare can grow stronger together with the city.”

Lionheart nodded in agreement.

In reality, he, too, wished for Meteorite City to grow stronger and become an Advanced Main City. However, the incredibly high difficulty of challenging a Tier 4 Infant Dragon made him decide to have Skyflare opt out of Angelica Teresa’s expedition.

After all, Skyflare already had two Tier 4 players under its command, and it had yet to stabilize its advantages. If Skyflare eagerly participated in the risky expedition and failed, the adventurer team would definitely lose a lot of its advantages.

“What do you think, Commander Lionheart?” Shi Feng asked. Previously, he didn’t hold much hope for slaying the Tier 4 Infant Dragon. After all, a Tier 4 Infant Dragon was comparable to Tier 5 existences; it was much stronger than even a Demon Prince. Even though he could use the complete Holy Devour now, it wouldn’t make any difference since he couldn’t use the technique indefinitely.

However, the story would change if Lionheart was present.

The fact that Lionheart could survive a Tier 5 attack meant that he could defend against a Tier 4 Infant Dragon’s attack.

“Okay.” After thinking for a while, Lionheart gritted his teeth and agreed to Shi Feng’s condition. “However, Brother Black Flame, as Skyflare has just gained some advantages, we cannot afford to invest everything into helping you. We can send only a 100-man team, at

most.”

In response to Lionheart’s worries, Shi Feng simply chuckled and said, “That’s already more than enough. In fact, it’s fine so long as Skyflare can dispatch its two Tier 4 players, let alone a 100-man team.”

“May I know when we will begin the operation?” Lionheart asked.

Raiding a Tier 4 Infant Dragon was an important matter. Preparing the necessary manpower and supplies would take a lot of time.

“We’re not in a rush right now. I’m afraid it will still take several days before we can set out,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “I’ll notify you when the time comes, Commander Lionheart.”

Challenging a Tier 4 Infant Dragon with just three Tier 4 players would be outright suicide. It wouldn’t matter even if they had a large number of Tier 3 players supporting them. Fortunately, the ancient God’s Domain did not require players to search for their Legacy Lands to challenge their Tier 4 Promotion Quests. So long as he had Lifeless Thorn and the others challenge their Promotion Quests and some of them succeeded, he would have a much greater chance of success.

“Alright. If that’s the case, I can make more preparations on my side.” Lionheart breathed out a sigh of relief at Shi Feng’s words.

Afterward, Shi Feng signed a partnership contract with Lionheart to the effect that Skyflare would purchase Crystals of Souls from Shi Feng at 150,000 Magic Crystals per crystal and Soul Water at 30,000 Magic Crystals per drop. For the first transaction, Skyflare purchased a total of 20 Crystals of Souls and 50 drops of Soul Water, the total expenditure amounting to 4.5 million Magic Crystals. When it came to Magic Crystals, Skyflare was wealthier than most superpowers operating in the modern God’s Domain.

When the transaction was completed, Shi Feng couldn’t help his elation.

After all, he now had the eight million Magic Crystals required to construct the Small Mobile Fortress. Afterward, all he needed to do was collect two million pieces of Mana Ore and 30,000 Mana Stones. In addition, he also had a chance to raid the Tier 4 Infant Dragon.

Leaving the Skyflare Hotel, Shi Feng looked at the additional 4.5 million Magic Crystals in his bag and smiled.

Now that I have the money, it’s about time to have Lifeless Thorn and the others undergo their promotion.
