Chapter 866 – Difference Between Then and Now

At Fira’s question, Shi Feng couldn’t help but turn to look at the other party.

Being at Level 237, Fira was a very high-level Elementalist. Yet, despite her impressive level, she was only equipped with Fragmented Legendary Equipment. Her equipment standard could only be considered terrible compared to the Greater God’s Domain’s players.

The other players were even worse, with some being equipped with Epic Equipment. If they were in the Greater God’s Domain, it would be unbelievable for players of such high levels to be so poorly equipped.

Under normal circumstances, any player capable of reaching Level 230 and above in the Greater God’s Domain would have at least several pieces of Legendary Equipment.

Could it be that materials needed to repair Legendary Equipment don’t drop here? Shi Feng speculated.

There were countless worlds in God’s Domain, each with its own circumstances and development directions. Some worlds made it easier for players to level up, some worlds made it easier to procure high-quality weapons and equipment, and so on.

Evidently, the primordial world they were currently in made it much easier for players to level up. But in exchange, the difficulty of obtaining high-quality equipment here was much greater than in the Greater God’s Domain. None of the 200-plus players here were equipped with Legendary Weapons or Equipment.

After taking another look at his surroundings, Shi Feng quickly understood the situation. After all, PvP and kill-stealing were common in the Greater God’s Domain.

Of course, it was still rare for so many players to get involved because of a Level 235 Divine monster.

However, Shi Feng was more interested in the Shadow Ape’s loot than the stand-off before him.

The Shadow Ape dropped 15 items, none of which were weapons or equipment. Instead, it dropped 13 Legendary Materials, one Taboo Equipment Design, and one Gold Combat Technique Legacy Crystal.

If such loot were to drop from a Level 235 Divine monster in the Greater God’s Domain, it would shock the various powers.

Although many monsters in the Greater God’s Domain could drop Legendary Materials, the Taboo Equipment Design and the Gold Combat Technique Legacy Crystal were not items that any random Divine monster could drop. It was especially so for the Taboo Equipment Design.

Normally, Taboo Equipment Designs had a very low probability of dropping in Taboo Dungeons. The drop rate was so terrible that players wouldn’t necessarily get one even after clearing hundreds of Taboo Dungeons. More often than not, they would only get some Level 200-plus Taboo Equipment.

Because of the rarity of Taboo Equipment Designs, any that appeared on the market could typically go for as much as a Divine Artifact. After all, if players relied only on raiding Taboo Dungeons to obtain Taboo Weapons and Equipment, it would take ages to fully equip an entire team. In comparison, if players had Taboo Weapon Designs and Taboo Equipment Designs, they could easily equip an entire Guild with Taboo Weapons and Taboo Equipment so long as they had enough materials.

“Hey, did you not hear what I said?” Fira’s gaze grew cold as she looked at Shi Feng.

Initially, Fira was somewhat apprehensive of Shi Feng and his party. After all, their entrance was incredibly abrupt and unusual. Thus, she declared her origins to provoke a reaction from them.

As one of Nightmare Holy City’s top two Guilds, the White Dragon Nation was known by all in the Holy City. The Holy Knights was the only power that could oppose it.

However, she had not expected Shi Feng to behave so indifferently after hearing the White Dragon Nation’s name. He didn’t even bother to pay her, a Vice Guild Leader of the White Dragon Nation, any heed. This was the first time it had ever happened to her since she started playing God’s Domain.

Not even the Guild Leader of the Holy Knights dared to treat her like that.

“Have these people been scared silly? How dare they ignore the Vice Guild Leader?”

“These people are dead. They’ll probably be erased from God’s Domain now that they’ve angered the Vice Guild Leader.”

…

The White Dragon Nation’s members looked at Shi Feng and his party with sympathy and amusement in their eyes.

Fira was not known for having a good temper. The last time an adventurer team failed to comply with her warning to leave the White Dragon Nation’s leveling spot within a given time, she ordered their annihilation without hesitation, even though the adventurer team was only a few seconds from leaving the area… Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Now that Shi Feng and his party had dared to ignore Fira, it wasn’t hard to imagine what awaited them.

“Friend, you’d best respond to Fira and leave here quickly. She’s a Vice Guild Leader of the White Dragon Nation, one of Nightmare Holy City’s top two Guilds. Besides the Holy Knights’ members, she only needs a few words to decide the fate of anyone in the city,” Whirlwind Bulwark suddenly said to Shi Feng on a private channel.

Nightmare Holy City? Vice Guild Leader of one of the city’s top two Guilds? Shi Feng grew even more surprised as he looked at Fira.

According to Whirlwind Bulwark’s introduction, the White Dragon Nation should be a powerful Guild. After all, any Guild capable of ranking at the top in a Holy City should be a first-tier Guild in God’s Domain.

Yet, despite being a Vice Guild Leader in such a Guild, Fira’s equipment standard was so terrible.

Even in the Starlight Realm, the executives of ordinary hegemonic powers would be fully equipped with Legendary Equipment at the very least. Yet, Fira, a Vice Guild Leader of one of Nightmare Holy City’s top two Guilds, didn’t have any Legendary Equipment on her. Shi Feng couldn’t even begin to imagine how far behind this remnant of a primordial world was in terms of equipment standards.

“Finally getting scared? Unfortunately for you, it’s too late for regrets!” When Fira saw Shi Feng’s surprise, she sneered and said, “Die with Whirlwind Bulwark’s team!”

After saying so, Fira activated the Divine Soul Curse she held.

Immediately, a magic array composed of divine runes appeared above Shi Feng, Whirlwind Bulwark, and the others. Subsequently, Shi Feng and the others felt a nefarious presence enveloping their souls.

A Divine Soul Curse? Shi Feng was shocked when he saw that he had received a Cursed Soul status.

The Divine Soul Curse was a near-extinct Divine Rune Scroll in the Greater God’s Domain. It was one of the best tools for eliminating enemies. Not only did it come with no side effects, but it was also an AOE Skill that could not be dodged or resisted. Should players be killed within 24 hours, they would die a true death. Even if players only sustained heavy injuries, their souls would be permanently weakened.

Many people hated the Divine Soul Curse because of its potent effects, which resulted in its persecution and near extinction. In the current Greater God’s Domain, each Divine Soul Curse was valued as much as a Divine Artifact, and only the various apex powers owned them. However, they would never use this special scroll unless they were going up against their mortal enemies.

“I’m sorry, friends. I hadn’t expected to get you involved in our conflict. I will distract them as much as possible, so try to escape with my team,” Whirlwind Bulwark hurriedly said to Shi Feng’s party.

As a Guardian Knight, Whirlwind Bulwark was only good at defense. Without special tools, he had no chance of escaping. The only thing he could do in this situation was help others escape.

“Don’t joke around, Commander!”

“Commander! If we’re going to die, we will die together! At worst, we’ll leave God’s Domain and become private instructors! I refuse to believe we’ll starve to death!”

When Pale Horn’s members saw Whirlwind Bulwark getting ready to take a stand, they couldn’t help but disapprove of his actions. They knew how strong Whirlwind Bulwark was. If he focused on escaping, he still had a chance of escaping the White Dragon Nation’s encirclement. Yet, he had chosen to abandon this chance to create an opportunity for them to escape.

“Escape?” Heiser, who stood beside Shi Feng, suddenly laughed. Then, she walked toward Fira.

“What is she doing?” Star Butterfly stared at Heiser in confusion.

“Don’t tell me she’s going to fight Fira?”

“She must be crazy! That’s Fira, the Elemental God, we are talking about! There are no more than a handful of Elementalists in Nightmare Holy City who can fight her head-on!”

Pale Horn’s members couldn’t help but think that Heiser was out of her mind when they saw her approaching Fira.

Many experts in Nightmare Holy City acknowledged Fira as the Elemental God. She had mastered over a dozen Gold Combat Techniques and Saint-ranked Mana Techniques.

“What? Do you want to fight me?” Fira chuckled when she saw Heiser walking up to her. She hadn’t expected there to be any more Elementalists from Nightmare Holy City who would dare to challenge her, especially not one who was only Level 227.

However, before Fira could say anything else, Heiser suddenly raised her hand and created magic arrays for Tier 6 Spells one after another. When the ninth magic array appeared, the White Dragon Nation’s and Pale Horn’s members were thoroughly dumbfounded.

Ninefold Tier 6 Spell, Thunder God’s Roar!

This was the product of Heiser’s self-developed Advanced Gold Combat Technique, Nine Heavenly Wheels!
