Chapter 919 – Primordial Dragon’s Blessing

As Shi Feng held up the Primordial Dragon Legacy Crystal and chanted, a spatial crack spanning dozens of kilometers appeared above the vast forest. It looked like the sky was being torn apart, striking fear in the monsters and players in the map.

A moment later, a pair of gigantic hands emerged from the spatial crack and pried it wide open. Then, a titanic figure over 10,000 meters tall walked out of the spatial crack, radiating a terrifying Divine Might that made the souls of all creatures in the forest shudder.

Subsequently, the titanic figure pointed at a figure on the ground, emitting invisible ripples that instantly spread hundreds of thousands of yards. All creatures that came into contact with these ripples—whether Level 200-plus Regional Bosses or Level 220-plus, Tier 6 players—fainted without resistance.

Thank goodness I didn’t summon her in the city. Shi Feng sighed in relief when he saw the commotion Kalisha had caused.

A mere mental ripple from Kalisha had caused all life within a several-hundred-mile radius to lose consciousness. The consequences would have been unimaginable if he had summoned her inside Flame Vein Holy City.

Although traces of Gods could be found in the Greater God’s Domain’s Twelve Sanctuaries, it was a different story for Ancient Gods. Should an Ancient God appear, the various powers would immediately mobilize all their forces in pursuit. In the case of Kalisha, an existence capable of rivaling Primordial Gods, even apex powers would try to track her down at all costs.

Normally, players who completed quests assigned by Ancient Gods could obtain lost Legacies from the Greater God’s Domain’s Primordial Era. If they were lucky, they might even obtain clues pertaining to the Tier 7 promotion. These factors were more than enough to make the various powers go crazy. With Kalisha being an existence that rivaled Primordial Gods, it would only be natural to assume that her quests would offer even greater rewards.

“Heaven’s blessed, it seems you are very lucky. I didn’t think you would recover my lost possession so quickly,” Kalisha said with a satisfied smile when she saw the Empress’s Scales in Shi Feng’s hands. “With this item, I will soon be able to regain all my strength and no longer have to hide from those Evil Gods and Demon Gods. As per our agreement, you are now my true contractor. For your valiant efforts, I will give you three options for your reward.

“The first option is a Phantom Crystal I made. Sealed inside it is a trace of my consciousness. You can use it to conjure an illusion doppelganger of me to assist you in battle for three hours.

“The second option is a request for me to take action once in person.

“The third option is a Growth-type Tier 7 Spell Book passed down by a Primordial God. It is something that I found in the depths of the Void Sea.

“I have yet to fully recover my strength, so I cannot stay for long. You have thirty seconds to consider.”

System: Congratulations! You have completed the second stage of the Inferior Mythical Quest Sanctuary’s Rise. Rewarding five levels. Kalisha’s Favorability of you has increased by 100 points. You have become Kalisha’s true Soul Contractor and obtained the complete Primordial Dragon’s Power.

Following the system notification, Shi Feng’s level increased from 218 to 223, catching up to the Greater God’s Domain’s mainstream Tier 6 players’ levels. However, the increase in his level did not attract Shi Feng’s attention. Instead, he focused on the three options Kalisha had given him.

Any of the rewards Kalisha offered could cause an uproar across the Greater God’s Domain.

Regarding the first option’s Phantom Crystal, while the conjured phantom wouldn’t be as strong as Kalisha herself, it could stay in battle for three hours. Whether it was used to fight a Guild War or raid a Taboo Boss, it would be very useful.

The second option’s request was also amazing. Although he could request Kalisha to make only one move for him, she would do so in her peak condition. In other words, he could get an existence that rivaled Primordial Gods to make a move for him. He wouldn’t trade away this valuable opportunity, even for multiple Divine Artifacts.

As for the third option’s Growth-type Tier 7 Spell Book, countless Tier 6 players would go crazy over such an item. Normally, even if a Tier 6 player obtained a Tier 7 Spell Book by some miracle, they wouldn’t be able to learn it due to tier restrictions. However, Growth-type Spell Books were an exception. Players of any tier could learn them. Moreover, players could upgrade a Growth-type Spell all the way to its maximum tier as long as the growth conditions were met.

In other words, a Growth-type Tier 7 Spell Book could let players who were Tier 6 or below obtain a bona fide Tier 7 Spell. The value of such a Spell Book easily exceeded that of several dozen Divine Artifacts. It was truly a priceless treasure.

As the 30-second time limit approached, Kalisha asked, “Have you decided yet?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I pick the Phantom Crystal!” Shi Feng answered firmly.

Although the second and third reward options were extremely tempting, they couldn’t solve his immediate concern, which was the fight against the Undying Mother.

After nearly getting wiped at the end of the Tosas raid, Shi Feng knew better than to rely on a devastating strike to kill a Taboo Boss. If he wanted good odds for conquering the Undying Mother, his best bet would be the Phantom Crystal. Although Kalisha’s phantom wouldn’t be as strong as the real deal, it should still be able to hold its ground against one of the Twenty-Two Taboos. After all, while the Twenty-Two Taboos were powerful, they ultimately hadn’t reached the standard of Primordial Gods. On the other hand, Kalisha was an existence that rivaled Primordial Gods.

As for the third option’s Growth-type Tier 7 Spell Book, while it might be priceless to others, Shi Feng didn’t strictly need it, as he had the Abyssal Eye.

“As you wish.” At Shi Feng’s answer, Kalisha conjured a silver crystal and handed it to him. “Now that you have obtained my complete power, this also means that you have become a thorn in the eyes of those Evil Gods and Demon Gods. Those things will remain a significant threat to you before I fully recover and eliminate them, so try to master my strength as quickly as possible.”

After that reminder, Kalisha turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the spatial crack, leaving Shi Feng stupefied as he stared at the latest system notification.

System: Warning! Warning! Evil Gods and Demon Gods now view you as a true enemy. You have triggered a Life Curse, causing you to lose 10% of your Basic Attributes permanently every time you die. An Evil Demon’s Shadow will also attack you once every 30 natural days. The Evil Demon’s Shadow will grow stronger with time. To lift the curse, you must kill the Evil Gods and Demon Gods responsible for cursing you.

“Fuck!” Shi Feng swore subconsciously when he saw the system notification.

Previously, the curse of the Evil Gods and Demon Gods only caused him to be periodically attacked by Evil Demon Shadows, which was not a big problem for him. But now, the curse would also cause him to lose 10% of his Basic Attributes every time he died. This was a massive penalty, especially when he was aiming to get promoted to Tier 7.

However, despite his frustration, Shi Feng didn’t dwell on the matter for long. He quickly shifted his thoughts to the power Kalisha mentioned.

Although he had already enjoyed Kalisha’s blessing before, its effects were limited, as she had lost much of her strength. Now that Kalisha had obtained a Primordial Dragon Relic and recovered her lost strength, he could finally use the complete Primordial Dragon’s Power.
