Chapter 3853 - 927 - Zero Wing and Evil Nature

“Are my eyes playing tricks on me? Did someone else just seize Plot 095’s first place?”

“Zero Wing?! Didn’t Zero Wing just enter Plot 095?!”

“Zero Wing already has 8,426 tokens?! What did it do in Plot 095?!”

Besides those participating in Everlasting City’s competition, the various powers also had observers stationed outside the island. When these players noticed the sudden change in Plot 095’s ranking list, they couldn’t help but doubt their eyes.

As Plot 095 was considered one of Everlasting City’s forbidden zones, most powers didn’t bother to pay much attention to it. After all, everyone knew that the ultimate occupant of Plot 095 would be Evil Nature, one of the Holy Race’s Ten Great Royal Powers. If there hadn’t been so many players gathered in Plot 095, which afforded more opportunities to collect tokens, the powers involved in Plot 095 would have long since fled to greener pastures.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yet, Evil Nature, originally placed first in Plot 095, was replaced by Zero Wing. This was a major event that could upset the entire competition.

“First place? How interesting!” The black-robed old man from the Seven Luminaries Alliance burst out laughing when he saw the change in Plot 095’s ranking list. “Rainbow, you did a great job recommending Zero Wing! The old fellows from Demon’s Gate promised they would seize the Sun Dynasty’s Plot 113, yet they’re still behind by over 1,000 tokens. In contrast, Evil Nature is no weaker than the Sun Dynasty, yet Zero Wing already leads it by over 4,000 tokens. Those old fellows will have a stroke if they learn about this!”

“Zero Wing has 8,426 tokens?” Verdant Rainbow was surprised when she inspected Plot 095’s ranking list. She couldn’t fathom how Zero Wing had obtained so many tokens so quickly.

After including the experts mobilized by the various apex and royal powers, the number of players participating in Everlasting City’s competition was only about two million. If these players were evenly distributed among the city’s 144 plots of land, each plot would only have a little more than 10,000 players. Depending on how the various powers arranged their players, 8,426 tokens could already comprise all the tokens on a plot of land.

Not to mention, it hadn’t been more than 20 minutes since Zero Wing arrived in Plot 095. Even if the experts fighting in Plot 095 were a bunch of harmless livestock, it shouldn’t be possible for Zero Wing to collect over 8,000 tokens in such a short time.

…

Everlasting City, Plot 059:

“Vice Guild Leader, something big happened on Zero Wing’s side!” Shuoyun exclaimed as she approached Lunar River, who was busy organizing a siege. “Zero Wing has risen to Plot 095’s first place with over 8,000 tokens! It is now leading Evil Nature by more than 4,000 tokens!”

“First place? Leading by more than 4,000 tokens?” Lunar River chuckled when she heard Shuoyun’s report. Then, while recalling Shi Feng’s face, she said, “So this is why you refused to partner with us?”

“Vice Guild Leader, now that Zero Wing has secured such a huge lead, unless the various powers involved in Plot 095 let Evil Nature freely slaughter their experts, there is very little Evil Nature can do to topple Zero Wing,” Shuoyun said anxiously. She couldn’t understand why Lunar River was still in the mood to laugh.

It should be known that King’s Paradise was hoping for Zero Wing’s failure. After all, Zero Wing would be willing to seek King’s Paradise’s help only if it crashed and burned. Yet, what had happened was the opposite of what King’s Paradise hoped for. Not only did Zero Wing not fail, but it had even secured first place in Plot 095. At this rate, King’s Paradise’s plans would be completely disrupted.

“Based on your analysis, there is indeed a high possibility that Plot 095 will go to Zero Wing,” Lunar River said leisurely. “But do you think a monarch would let an ant occupy their throne?”

“Vice Guild Leader, are you saying that Evil Nature will take action?” Shuoyun gasped.

“Evil Nature is targeting many plots of land, so its top experts are very scattered. Although it is unlikely to mobilize all its forces, the limited forces it mobilizes should still be enough to make Zero Wing suffer,” Lunar River stated calmly. “This should let Zero Wing know the gap between powers beneath the apex standard and powers at the apex standard and above. Zero Wing will also understand how difficult it is to occupy four plots of land in Everlasting City’s competition.

“Alright, enough about Zero Wing! All of you, get ready! We will be seizing Plot 047 next! We will likely have to clash with the Holy Race’s number one chosen one! This will be a good chance to see how powerful the Holy Race’s Half-step Mortal Gods are!”

“Understood!” Lunar River’s words stimulated Shuoyun. She hadn’t expected Lunar River to take action so soon.

The gap between powers below the apex standard and powers at the apex standard and above wasn’t limited to equipment. It also included Legacies. This situation led to a significant difference in the quantity and quality of experts nurtured. It was also why King’s Paradise had been operating behind the scenes all these years.

As an upstart Guild, Zero Wing had no idea how big of a difference this gap was.

…

Everlasting City, Plot 095:

As the experts who survived Gentle Snow’s attack were heavily injured, Zero Wing’s forces had an easy time hunting them down. Although most of Zero Wing’s members were behind the various pseudo-apex powers’ experts in levels, many still managed to achieve victory one-on-one. They could even finish their opponents under a dozen moves when they fought two-on-one.

Zero Wing’s forces eliminated the remaining several hundred experts in less than ten minutes, increasing Zero Wing’s token count to 9,265 and putting Zero Wing ahead of Evil Nature by 5,000 tokens. As the number of players on the battlefield decreased, the number of players engaging in guerilla warfare would increase, making it harder for the various powers to rack up kills and tokens. Thus, Zero Wing was already guaranteed to become Plot 095’s occupant.

“Guild Leader, a group of concealed players are rapidly approaching us!” Azure Shadow, who carried a longbow on his back, reported in the team chat. “They are very fast! They’ll reach us in ten seconds at most!”

“There are players coming for us? How many?” Hidden Soul, who was resting, asked curiously.

Zero Wing became very famous in Plot 095 because of Gentle Snow. After all, unlike Phoenix Rain’s All-Consuming Fire, Gentle Snow’s attack that annihilated over 3,000 experts in one fell swoop wasn’t a Spell with a long Cooldown but a combat technique. Unless Zero Wing’s opponent had an expert of a similar caliber, its only option would be to wear out Gentle Snow’s Stamina and Concentration with numbers.

Because of this, the powers operating in Plot 095 avoided Zero Wing like the plague. Any player that encountered Zero Wing’s team would promptly turn around and flee. Since the initial battle, this was the first time anyone had taken the initiative to approach them.

“It’s a party of six…” Although Azure Shadow had doubts when he saw the results of his Scouting Skill, he still answered truthfully.

“Only six? Do they not have any Rangers or Assassins among them?” Ji Luorong was stunned by this answer.

Reconnaissance should be the top priority for groups wandering Everlasting City’s chaotic battlefield. Otherwise, they wouldn’t even know what killed them. Yet, a six-man party was approaching Zero Wing’s team of 600-plus players.

However, before Azure Shadow could conduct further verification, six players appeared in the sky above the street that Zero Wing’s team occupied. Each of these six players was equipped with at least five Divine Artifacts, with the rest of their equipment comprising Fragmented Divine Artifacts. The leader of the party, a one-eyed old man with white hair, was fully equipped with Divine Artifacts, and the aura he radiated was so powerful that many of the Zero Wing members present went weak in the knees.

After scanning Zero Wing’s forces, the one-eyed old man looked at Shi Feng and asked, “Are you Zero Wing’s Black Flame?”

“That’s right. And you are?” Shi Feng asked, standing up from the ground.

“Evil Nature’s Unseeing Demon!”

The old man’s words gave birth to a powerful attack that assaulted everyone on Zero Wing’s team. Apart from those with at least Tier 6 Peak Concentration, everyone else experienced a wave of dizziness.
