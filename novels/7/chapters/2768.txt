Chapter 2769 – Inferior Mythic Quest

System: Warning! Warning!

System: You have triggered an optional Inferior Mythic World Quest.

Quest content: Assist Angelica Teresa to become Meteorite City’s Lord. Rewards one unknown item and God’s Domain World Authority +2. Penalties unknown.

System: You have 30 seconds to consider. Quest will be accepted by default if no response is made.

An Inferior Mythic Quest? Shi Feng couldn’t help doubting his ears when he heard the system.

As far as he knew, Legendary Main Storyline Quests were already the most challenging quests players could pick up. However, there were quests of a higher grade than Legendary Main Storyline Quests—Mythic Quests, which had always been a mystery of God’s Domain. Despite the rumors of Mythic Quests, nobody had ever personally verified their existence.

Yet, he had now triggered an Inferior Mythic Quest.

Do I accept it? Shi Feng hesitated.

This was most likely the only opportunity he would ever get to challenge such a quest. After all, he had never even heard of anybody receiving a quest of this rank. He had most likely triggered such a quest only because he happened to visit God’s Domain’s ancient era and came across a key historical figure.

Moreover, by the looks of it, the other players around him had not received this quest. This meant he had satisfied some unknown conditions to trigger this quest.

Only, the penalty for failing a Legendary Quest was already more than enough to end a player’s career in God’s Domain. The penalty for failing an Inferior Mythic Quest would most likely be several times greater. If he failed to complete the quest after accepting it... However, when he saw the reward of “God’s Domain’s World Authority +2,” greed momentarily overwhelmed him.

In the present God’s Domain, everyone else was probably unaware of God’s Domain’s World Authority, as it was simply far too difficult to obtain. Normally, players had to have achievements that affected the entirety of God’s Domain to acquire this World Authority.

Players who successfully obtained World Authority, even if only one point of it, would receive unimaginable assistance in their progression in God’s Domain. Just like the name suggested, gaining World Authority meant one would become an existence with special rights in God’s Domain.

The various superpowers were willing to go all-out and risk incurring massive losses just to obtain the special rights the War God’s Temple offered. After all, obtaining these rights meant one’s Guild could surpass other Guilds by a large margin and solidify its position in God’s Domain.

Individual players could also obtain special rights in God’s Domain—this was World Authority. Obtaining even one point of World Authority was equivalent to attaining God’s Domain’s recognition. Players with World Authority would then gain an unimaginable affinity with the world.

On the surface, gaining an increased affinity with the world might not seem very useful. However, it would provide players with a clearer perception of the various magic elements and their operating principles. This was crucial for players aiming to reach Tier 6.

In the past, for the sake of producing Tier 6 God-ranked players, the various Super Guilds were willing to do everything they could just to help a select few of their members gain World Authority. However, even the Five Great Super Guilds had managed to gather only a handful of World Authority points after struggling for four or five years.

Nevertheless, it was also a fact that every player that obtained World Authority points had reached Tier 6.

Now that Shi Feng had the opportunity to obtain two World Authority points just by completing one quest, how could he not feel greedy? If he succeeded, let alone Tier 5, even getting promoted to Tier 6 would become a lot easier.

“Commander, are you alright?” Yan Ya asked worriedly when she noticed Shi Feng’s strange expression. “Did you consume too much Concentration after using that combat technique just now?”

Previously, Shi Feng had exhausted himself during the fight with Todelya. Although they had taken a small break afterward, the amount of Concentration he managed to recover was most likely limited.

“I’m fine,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. He then looked toward Angelica Teresa, who currently lay weakly on the ground, and gritted his teeth. It seems I have no choice but to help her.

Truthfully, he didn’t wish to take part in this matter. After all, the old man from before had emphasized that if he overdid things here, the world would quickly discover his existence and forcibly return him to the modern world. If that happened, it would be a huge loss for him.

After all, the environment here was truly wonderful. Moreover, God’s Domain’s ancient era was far superior to the modern era in many aspects. The available Legacies aside, just the materials, weapons, and equipment available here were already leaps and bounds superior to the modern God’s Domain.

At this point, he had yet to find out how he could earn a large amount of resources from this ancient era, so he naturally couldn’t recklessly take action. This was also why he had chosen to chase away Nemen Carlo instead of killing the Great Demon.

Needless to say, he also wished to avoid saving the NPCs of this era if possible. This was especially true for a bigshot like Angelica Teresa.

Steady progression was the way to go in God’s Domain.

However, the quest rewards were far too generous. Even if it meant taking a huge risk, Shi Feng still planned to give it a try.

After all, in his current state, he really wasn’t confident of getting promoted to Tier 5. If he merely relied on Legacy Guidances, constructing even a completely new Mana Body would be tough, let alone constructing a Mana Body that matched the physique of Tier 5 monsters.

Ultimately, Shi Feng walked up to Angelica Teresa, his actions causing the other people present to grow alert.

Although Shi Feng had repelled the Demon army for them, he was still a foreign powerhouse. Their wariness of him was only natural.

After all, there were many insidious people in God’s Domain who were capable of stabbing others in the back with a smiling face. No one wouldn’t be completely safe from such people, regardless of one’s identity. The best example would be their Commander. Their Commander possessed a great reputation in their city. Most of the city’s bigshots respected and favored her, yet she still ended up getting stabbed in the back.

Upon seeing Shi Feng walk over, Yu Luo gritted her teeth and asked in a quiet tone, “Guild Leader Black Flame, do you have a way to save our Commander? So long as you can save the Commander, I will help you with whatever you want! Even if it means sacrificing myself!”

In reality, Yu Luo did not think Shi Feng would have a way to save Commander Angelica Teresa. After all, even Cooling Cloud, who was both a skillful healer and Advanced Master Alchemist, was helpless.

“I indeed have a way to save her. However, I don’t need you to sacrifice yourself or anything of the sort.” Shi Feng smiled involuntarily when he saw the resolution on Yu Luo’s face. “I just need you to tell me about the situation here once afterward.” Even if Yu Luo didn’t ask for his help, he would still save Angelica Teresa. After all, a dead person couldn’t become the overlord of Meteorite City.

“You have a way to save the Commander, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Yu Luo was momentarily stunned by Shi Feng’s reply. However, she quickly recollected herself and said excitedly, “No problem. So long as it is something I know, I will definitely tell you.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

On the other hand, Cooling Cloud, who stood at a side, was confused when she heard Shi Feng’s confident reply. She was an Advanced Master Alchemist, yet even she was helpless about Angelica’s situation. She found it truly hard to believe a fellow countryman of Yu Luo’s had a way to save the Commander.

This wasn’t because Cooling Cloud was belittling Shi Feng and Yu Luo but because the knowledge Yu Luo had shown regarding God’s Domain was simply too inadequate. Even her usage of Skills and Spells was crude. In addition, while it wasn’t necessary for all healers to become a specialized Master Alchemist, it was still common sense for healers to know how to craft some potions. Yet, Yu Luo did not.

Hence, Cooling Cloud concluded that Yu Luo and Shi Feng came from some backwoods. Otherwise, they shouldn’t lack such common sense.

However, Shi Feng did not respond to Yu Luo’s question. He merely took out a translucent crystal from his bag and passed it to her. “Have her eat this. She’ll gradually recover once she does,” Shi Feng said without further explanation.

Yu Luo was confused when she received the translucent crystal from Shi Feng, not understanding how such a crystal could save Commander Angelica.

However, when Cooling Cloud saw the crystal in Yu Luo’s hand, she was shocked.

“A Crystal of Souls?! How is this possible?!”

At Cooling Cloud’s exclamation, the other healers present stared at Shi Feng as if they were looking at a monster.

“Big Sis Cloud, is this Crystal of Souls something amazing?” Yu Luo asked, bewildered.

Realizing that she had lost her composure, Cooling Cloud quickly calmed herself, then explained, “The Crystal of Souls isn’t just valuable. It is incomparably rare even on the scale of the entire God’s Domain. The Holy City’s side can secure only a few of such crystals, as they are simply too rare. Normally, such crystals appear in places where souls gather, such as the Netherworld. These crystals can not only heal one’s mental state but also strengthen the soul to a certain degree. It is impossible to purchase a Crystal of Souls on the market, and it is many times more valuable than even the Water of Life.”

“It’s such a rare item?” Yu Luo was startled. She never thought Shi Feng would actually use such a precious item to save someone. With this, she would owe him a massive favor.

“Alright, you’d best save her first,” Shi Feng said. When he saw the astonished looks everyone was giving him, he only shook his head and smiled.

The Crystal of Souls was indeed precious. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t be willing to use it. After all, he had to rely on himself to harvest the necessary monster souls to create Crystals of Souls.

However, the crystals weren’t so precious that he couldn’t afford to waste them on others. After all, the Soul Orb was one of the Seven Treasures that could easily produce Crystals of Souls. He merely needed to kill Great Lord ranked monsters five levels higher than himself to obtain the necessary monster souls.

At Shi Feng’s reminder, Yu Luo quickly snapped out of her daze and helped Angelica consume the Crystal of Souls.

Shortly afterward, Angelica’s complexion recovered significantly. Although she had fallen unconscious after consuming the Crystal of Souls, one could tell that her condition was no longer critical. Now, all they needed to do was wait. By the time Angelica woke up on her own, she would be thoroughly recovered.

Meanwhile, after seeing that Angelica was saved, Cooling Cloud, as a captain in the knight legion, took the initiative to invite Shi Feng’s party to rest in Meteorite City, the Main City they resided in.

Shi Feng did not refuse the invitation, as he was curious to learn more about God’s Domain’s ancient era.

The human army walked for over a dozen hours before eventually arriving before a stalwart mountain range. A city that was more spectacular than even the royal capitals found in the modern God’s Domain appeared inside the valley of this mountain range.
