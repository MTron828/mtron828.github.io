Chapter 2859 - Returning to the Eastern Continent

Eastern continent, Demon Mist Valley:

“What rotten luck. We actually got teleported to a forbidden land.”

Crimson Witch frowned as she observed the faint red mist surrounding her.

Divine Tribe had conducted a thorough investigation into the forbidden lands on both continents. This was because these locations were incredibly dangerous; current players couldn’t visit them. Moreover, players would first have to exit the forbidden land before they could teleport out of the map.

After players entered Level 100-plus maps, it was found that these maps possessed plenty of spatial tears and random teleportation points. Any one of these traps had a high chance of teleporting players to dangerous locations like forbidden lands. Hence, to reduce the chances of their important combatants dying after getting teleported forcibly to a forbidden land, the superpowers investigated the various forbidden lands and provided this information to their members.

The Demon Mist Valley was one of the better-known forbidden lands on the eastern continent.

The reason for its fame was the red mist shrouding the map all year round. Anyone who entered this place, even Tier 48, would have their physique and senses heavily suppressed, unable to exert even half of their normal combat power.

In addition, the monsters in the Demon Mist Valley possessed incredibly powerful Defense and Magic Resistance. The weakest monster here was a Level 130 Great Lord; there were also plenty of Mythic monsters and even Superior Mythic monsters. Even Tier 4 experts would have a very low chance of survival if they got sent to this forbidden land unprepared. Hence, the various superpowers had placed particularly great importance on the Demon Mist Valley.

“Our luck isn’t all that bad. At least we didn’t get sent to the central region. We’re only at the boundary between the inner and outer regions,” MacAffrey, the Silver Lion Legion’s vice commander, said after checking his map. Pointing at the valley in the forest in front, he continued, “We should reach the outer region in three hours if we head in that direction.”

The Demon Mist Valley did not just prevent teleportation, but its red mist also prevented Tier 4 players from flying. In fact, even Flying Mounts could only walk here. “Guild Leader Black Flame, let us hurry out of here. We’ll get surrounded by monsters if we stay for too long. At that time, leaving the Demon Mist Valley will become even more troublesome,” Fithalia suggested as she looked at Shi Feng. Although the red mist heavily suppressed players’ perception, the monsters inside the Demon Mist Valley were unaffected. Hence, monsters would almost always notice players before players detected them. In addition, now that monsters in God’s Domain had gained self-awareness and greater intelligence, they would almost always ambush players in packs. Not to mention, their group was currently in the Demon Mist Valley’s inner region. According to Divine Tribe’s research, the chances of a Superior Mythic monster appearing here was quite high. Quite a number of Mythic monsters also roamed the area.

If their group caused a huge commotion, it could easily attract a pack of Mythic monsters. Even for Tier 4 players like themselves, fighting multiple Mythic monsters was very dangerous.

“Sure.” Shi Feng nodded.

After arriving in the Demon Mist Valley, he had already spread his senses. Despite his perception getting suppressed to just a 2,000-yard radius, he still managed to discover two Mythic monsters and more than 30 Level 140-plus Grand Lords. It would indeed be very troublesome if their small group had to fight against all these monsters.

Following this, the group of four made their way into the valley under Shi Feng’s lead.

Now that Shi Feng’s Concentration had reached the Tier 5 standard and his control over Mana had achieved World Creation, even after walking through the valley for over an hour, the four did not come across a single battle. This situation confused Fithalia and the others, and they could only assume that an army of players had cleared this valley recently.

However, as the group approached the outer region, the density of the monsters in the area also increased. Although Shi Feng had a perception range of 2,000 yards, he still had greater difficulty finding a safe route to travel.

“Huh? Players?”

Suddenly, Shi Feng detected strong Mana fluctuations coming from a forest some distance ahead, indicating a battle taking place there.

After advancing a little more, the group even began hearing sounds of battle.

Shortly after hearing the noise, the group saw a Level 145 Superior Mythic ranked Four-winged Feathered Dragon rising from the forest a thousand yards away. The Feathered Dragon then used a breath attack, turning the forest within a 500-yard radius into ash.

Along with the destruction of a portion of the forest, three figures-one female and two males-entered the sight of Shi Feng’s group. These three players were all Tier 4 players. Shi Feng even recognized two of them. One was Sixteenth Cloud, the Second Vice Guild Leader of Shining Tiger; the other was the Assassin Sorrowful Silence. The only reason the trio managed to survive the Feathered Dragon’s breath attack was the Tier 4 Guardian Knight of the group.

However, after taking on that breath attack, the Guardian Knight did not have much HP remaining. None of the three was a healer, either, so the Guardian Knight could only rely on potions to heal himself. Evidently, it wouldn’t be long before they fell to the Superior Mythic monster.

“Dammit! To think we’ll actually die here!”

Sixteenth Cloud, who wielded a crimson staff, glared at the Four-winged Feathered Dragon’s 60-meter-long frame with inevitable frustration.

“That’s right! We should’ve fought those people outside instead. It would be much better than getting killed by this monster,” Sorrowful Silence said, nodding in agreement.

“There’s no helping it. Who would’ve thought we would encounter such a monster as soon as we ducked into the inner region?” Sixteenth Cloud said with a bitter smile. “I guess fate really wants us dead.”

They had gone to great lengths to escape the Outerworld experts’ pursuit, running all the way from the Demon Mist Valley’s outer region to the inner region. Originally, they thought they could lose those Outerworld experts after hiding in the inner region. They never imagined that a Superior Mythic monster might be guarding the border. The Four-winged Feather Dragon wasn’t just a Superior Mythic monster. It was also the Realm Lord of this area. Even a 20-man Tier 4 team would have difficulty fighting it under normal circumstances, what more under the Demon Mist Valley’s suppression?

And worse, the Feathered Dragon could fly. There was no way to escape it. Players that encountered the Feathered Dragon had only two options: kill it or be killed by it. There was no third option. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, before Sixteenth Cloud and Sorrowful Silence could continue their conversation, the Feathered Dragon flapped its two sets of wings, sending countless wind blades at the three players. The Boss did not give the trio a chance to catch a breather.

Upon seeing the approaching wind blades, Sixteenth Cloud swung her crimson staff, instantly raising a wall of flames in front of the three.

The wall of flames rose over a hundred meters, blocking all the oncoming wind blades. And once the flames stopped the attacks, they transformed into a phoenix that flew toward the Feathered Dragon.

Tier 4 Curse, Phoenix Flame!

Phoenix Flame was actually a Tier 4 Offensive Curse. However, Sixteenth Cloud not only utilized it as if it were a Defensive Curse but even switched it to offense afterward. Her mastery of this Tier 4 Curse was simply superb.

However, just as the phoenix was about to devour the Feathered Dragon, the latter suddenly let loose a deafening roar. Immediately afterward, the flames making up the phoenix got extinguished one after another. The phoenix eventually disappeared before it could reach the Feathered Dragon’s body.

“Mana Annihilation!?”

Sixteenth Cloud was thunderstruck when she saw the flames disappearing, her mind unable to accept this situation. If the flames had merely failed to damage the Feathered Dragon because they lacked power, she would still be able to understand it. However, as she held full control over the flames, she could tell that the flames hadn’t died naturally. Instead, they got extinguished because the Mana used to create and fuel them had been annihilated. “How can a Boss hold such a Skill?! This is cheating!”

Sorrowful Silence fell into despair as he looked at the Feathered Dragon. Although he didn’t know the exact details of the situation because he wasn’t the creator of those flames, he could tell that those flames had died due to Mana Annihilation.

In other words, all Spells would be a joke in front of the Feathered Dragon.

Moreover, as an Inferior Dragon, the Four-winged Feathered Dragon possessed incredible Defense. If magical attacks were ineffective against it, it would be a nigh-invincible existence.

After destroying Sixteenth Cloud’s Curse, the Feathered Dragon flapped its wings and sent wind blades at the three players once more.

“It seems this is the end for us.”

Looking at the innumerable oncoming wind blades, Sixteenth Cloud could only shrug helplessly and wait for death to claim her.

Originally, she had hoped her Tier 4 Curse would heavily injure the Feathered Dragon, creating an opportunity for their party to escape. However, let alone heavily injuring the Feathered Dragon, she couldn’t even damage it. In front of an Inferior Dragon capable of using Mana Annihilation, an Elementalist like herself was nothing but a joke. She was of no threat to it at all.

Yet, just as the countless wind blades were about to strike Sixteenth Cloud and the others, a magic barrier suddenly emerged from the ground before them. The barrier stopped the wind blades, releasing the trio from death’s grip.

“Crystalline Barrier?”

When Sixteenth Cloud saw the shattered magic barrier in front of her, she immediately recognized the Tier 4 Spell used to create it. With his keen eyes, Sorrowful Silence quickly noticed some figures emerging from the distant forest. “Vice Guild Leader, there are people coming from over there.” At Sorrowful Silence’s words, Sixteenth Cloud promptly turned toward the direction he indicated.

What entered her vision were four people, two male and two females, emerging from the forest roughly 500 yards away. It was evident that these four people were responsible for the Tier 4 Defensive Spell that had saved their party.

“Black Flame?”

When Sixteenth Cloud saw one of the cloaked men of the group, she couldn’t help her surprise.

She had met with the man known as Black Flame once before, when negotiating with Zero Wing for partnership on behalf of Shining Tiger. However, after that event, she had paid very little attention to Zero Wing, focusing it all on developing Shining Tiger’s forces in the Glory Empire.

If not for Shi Feng having accomplished astonishing feats that shook the entirety of God’s Domain, she would’ve long since forgotten his appearance.
