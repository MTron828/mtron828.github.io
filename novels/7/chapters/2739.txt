Chapter 2740 – Mental Path

Shi Feng also deeply agreed with Muxin’s reminder. In fact, he had a much better understanding than Muxin and Kerui did of how special and different the Upper Zone was, compared to the outside world.

In his previous life, aside from the various powers of God’s Domain, any expert that successfully reached Tier 5 would, for some reason, yearn to enter the Upper Zone. Their yearning could even be described as fanaticism. That kind of fanaticism wasn’t something Muxin and Kerui could understand.

Back then, those people were truly willing to risk their lives to enter the Upper Zone. Extending one’s lifespan by living in the Upper Zone was indeed a very tempting matter. In fact, it was something even the various major corporations would fight desperately to obtain. However, back then, Shi Feng could tell that those Tier 5 experts weren’t risking their lives just to extend their lifespans. Instead, it was as if something in the Upper Zone was attracting experts of such caliber.

Thus, many Tier 5 experts and even Tier 6 God-ranked experts in God’s Domain had abruptly gone missing, their fate unknown.

One of the most well-known people among those who disappeared was Violet Cloud.

As a Tier 6 Cleric God, Violet Cloud had been an existence even the various Super Guilds had a headache dealing with. In the past, in order to enter the Upper Zone, Violet Cloud had agreed to the harsh conditions of a Super Guild. After completing these conditions, she had entered the Upper Zone.

However, she had also disappeared from God’s Domain from then on.

Hence, whether it was Kerui’s warning or Muxin’s reminder, Shi Feng still wished to take a look at what exactly the Upper Zone was.

When Shi Feng arrived before the entrance of the dark passageway, there were already several dozen people lined up there. These people were equally split between genders, and none of them looked to be over 20 years old, with the youngest one looking to be only 16 years old. Meanwhile, despite the arrival of beauties like Muxin and Kerui, these people practically ignored the two. Instead, they all focused on Shi Feng, who was wearing casual sportswear.

“Another newcomer arrived.”

“Judging by his appearance, he didn’t come prepared at all. He’s definitely another one of those despicable bastards that got in through connections!”

“Shh, don’t let him hear you. We can’t afford to offend such people.”

When Shi Feng overheard the conversation of the teenage boys and girls with his sharp senses, he was rather baffled. Meanwhile, Kerui, who stood beside Shi Feng, nearly laughed at his situation but managed to restrain herself in the end. However, her lips still formed a shallow arc.

“You don’t need to mind them,” Muxin said to Shi Feng as she glanced at the teenagers. “They’re here to participate in the assessment for entering the Upper Zone.” “Assessment for entering the Upper Zone?” Shi Feng was slightly surprised.

This was his first time to hear of this. As far as he knew, the only reliable way for an outsider without connections to enter the Upper Zone was through recruitment by the Green God Company as a talent.

“Mhm. Unlike what you would expect, the Upper Zone isn’t limited to just people with authority,” Muxin explained. “The Upper Zone is also where the Green God Company nurtures its internal talents. These youngsters are all talents who have passed the Green God Company’s preliminary tests. So long as they pass this assessment, they will also gain entry into the Upper Zone.

“However, this assessment is only available to talents under the age of 20. Talents past this age can only work outside. As for the assessment’s content, it is simply to get through this passageway and enter the Upper Zone.”

“Pass through this passageway?” Shi Feng asked in confusion as he pointed at the dark tunnel ahead. “That’s right. This passage is nicknamed the Mental Path, and it tests and tempers a person’s mental strength. The Mental Path is normally closed, so it doesn’t have any significant effect on people. However, when the Mental Path is activated, only three to five people get through it every year; very few among those who participate in the Green God Company’s test actually pass it,” Muxin said, nodding. “However, so long as one passes the test, not only will they receive priority training from the Green God Company, but they will also receive a significant reward.”

Kerui nodded in agreement with Muxin’s words. She then said pridefully to Shi Feng, “I passed this Mental Path last year. Big Sis is even more of a genius, and she passed it at the age of 15. She caused quite a sensation in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone back then.” While Muxin was giving Shi Feng an explanation, a young man walked out of the passageway. This man wore a tight-fitting T-shirt that thoroughly revealed his skeletal structure and muscles. His physique was elegant and full of power, like a cheetah’s. However, despite his apparent youth, his aura suggested that he had experienced the vicissitudes of life. It was evident he wasn’t as young as he looked.

Upon noticing this man’s arrival, the teenagers, Muxin, and Kerui promptly tensed up.

“Huh? Another newcomer?” The young man was slightly surprised when his gaze fell on Shi Feng.

“Supervisor Luo, you misunderstand. He is here to register. He’s not an examinee,” Muxin explained.

“Oh, so Hong Xinyuan gave his reserve slot to him?” Suddenly, a trace of disgust flashed in the young man’s eyes as he took a second glance at Shi Feng. “What a lucky kid. However, the Green God Company is conducting an assessment today. If you want to enter, you’ll have to go with these youngsters. I don’t have the time to shut down the passageway again.” Muxin frowned when she heard the young man’s words.

It was no secret that Luo Hanbing and Hong Xinyuan were rivals in the Upper Zone. However, she never thought that Luo Hanbing would use this opportunity to publicly retaliate against Hong Xinyuan.

One needed to make an appointment to register with the Upper Zone. Normally, waiting several months for an appointment wouldn’t be strange. This time, it was only thanks to Hong Xinyuan’s connections that Shi Feng could get registered so soon.

However, if he didn’t register today, he would have to wait for several months for another opportunity to do so.

Meanwhile, those unregistered with the Upper Zone wouldn’t be able to live there.

“Supervisor Luo, he is someone with a reserve slot. He has the right to freely enter the Upper Zone!” Muxin said in a low tone to express her dissatisfaction.

“I never said I was stopping him from entering,” Luo Hanbing sneered. “He can enter whenever he wants. If he can’t enter now, he can just enter tomorrow.”

As soon as Luo Hanbing finished speaking, the teenage examinees nearby nodded in agreement.

“That’s right. The passageway is always open. Since he already has identification in the Upper Zone, can’t he enter whenever he wants?”

“Supervisor Luo is right. If he can’t enter now, he can just enter tomorrow. Why must he compete with newcomers like us?”

The teenage newcomers instinctively despised people who entered the Upper Zone through connections. After all, they had gone through great difficulties to reach this point. They even had to walk through the activated Mental Path to secure identification in the Upper Zone. In comparison, Shi Feng could obtain identification without having to do anything. He made their efforts look like a joke. Kerui also couldn’t help glaring at the supervisor surnamed Luo. She then whispered to Muxin, saying, “Big Sis, why don’t we come back at another date? That bastard clearly won’t let us in today.”

As one of the Upper Zone’s supervisors, Luo Hanbing wielded greater authority in the Upper Zone than Hong Xinyuan. Even if they reported this matter to their uncle, they wouldn’t be able to do anything about this situation. After all, Luo Hanbing’s actions were not completely unreasonable.

“Alright, if you don’t want to enter, don’t get in the way,” Luo Hanbing said impatiently. “The newcomer assessment this time is very important. If it gets delayed, even Hong Xinyuan won’t be able to bear the consequences!”

“You…”

However, just as Muxin wanted to say something, a voice suddenly entered everyone’s ears. “Supervisor Luo, so we can enter right away?”

The owner of this voice was none other than Shi Feng, who had remained silent all this time.

“Shi Feng?”

Muxin stared at Shi Feng in stupefaction. She never thought Shi Feng would actually consider challenging the Mental Path.

Let alone Muxin, even Luo Hanbing and the others were surprised.

“Kid, it seems you’re quite bold,” Luo Hanbing said as he looked at Shi Feng. Chuckling, he continued, “Go on in, then. However, let me give you a warning. You’re not an examinee, so even if you lose consciousness inside, nobody will come to rescue you. If you stay inside for too long, it wouldn’t be strange if you end up hospitalized for a few months.”

“Don’t mess around, Shi Feng. The Mental Path has a limit. It’s several times more difficult for those over the age of 20. This is why the Green God Company has set the assessment’s age limit at below 20 years old,” Muxin said hurriedly. Not many people knew this, but the Green God Company had previously allowed people over 20 years old but under 25 years old to participate in the assessment as well. However, not a single person from this age group had managed to pass the assessment. As a result, the company limited the assessment to only people under the age of 20.

Meanwhile, Luo Hanbing also knew this point, which was why he was certain they wouldn’t be able to enter the Upper Zone today.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Relax. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll give up and come back immediately,” Shi Feng assured, chuckling.

Tests of mental strength were considered fortuitous opportunities in God’s Domain. After all, the Promotion Quests for Tier 4 and above set an incredibly high requirement for players’ mental strength.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng’s Concentration had reached the Tier 4 standard, he had hit a bottleneck and failed to make further progress.

With such an opportunity before him, he naturally had to give it a try.

After saying so, Shi Feng walked straight into the dark tunnel, leaving behind Muxin, who remained in a daze.

“Alright, you newcomers head in, as well. Remember, you have only one hour!”

At Luo Hanbing’s words, the newcomers promptly took deep breaths. Only after adjusting their mental state to its peak condition did they enter the passageway one after another.

“Big Sis, what should we do?” Kerui was also at a loss in this situation.

She never thought Shi Feng would be so courageous. Previously, when she told Shi Feng to be careful when he entered the Upper Zone, she meant for him to be careful of the Mental Path. After all, even when inactive, the Mental Path significantly affected people older than 20. If he wasn’t careful, he might end up fainting. Yet, now, Shi Feng was walking straight into the fully activated Mental Path.

“The Mental Path is too dangerous for me,” Muxin said anxiously. After giving the matter some thought, she said, “You should go after him. If it looks like he can’t hold on any longer, bring him back immediately.”

“Hah… What a troublesome guy. Does he think he is still in God’s Domain?” Kerui grumbled somewhat unhappily.

However, in consideration of the overall situation, Kerui still entered the passageway.
