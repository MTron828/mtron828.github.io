Chapter 428 – Star Lake Shocked Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When the dust settled and revealed the two people it shrouded, the spectators from both cities involuntarily shuddered and got goosebumps.

It was already plenty shocking for a pseudo-great grandmaster to appear in a third-tier city battle, let alone two. Nobody would believe them if they were to tell others about this situation.

“What kind of origins does Zero Wing have? How did it manage to recruit the help of such a young pseudo-great grandmaster?”

“Damn! Things are getting interesting! It’s not every day you get to watch two pseudo-great grandmasters clashing, even in second-tier city battles! I truly didn’t think I would be fortunate enough to witness such a fight in person!”

“But who is this woman? If she can become a pseudo-great grandmaster at such a young age, there’s no way she is someone unknown. But why haven’t I heard of her in the Starlight Realm before?”

At this time, the two cities’ spectators who were initially concerned about the city battle’s outcome switched to focusing all their attention on the fight between Reckless Knight and Cheng Xin. For a time, they even forgot about the fate of their respective cities as they watched the fight with joy and excitement.

A confrontation between pseudo-great grandmasters was a rare event. It was especially so in simulation warfare. Normally, it wasn’t something inhabitants of third- and second-tier cities would get to see.

Meanwhile, pseudo-great grandmasters were individuals who had already developed their control over their bodies to the extremes. For those seeking to develop their mental strength, they stood to learn a ton from a battle between pseudo-great grandmasters.

…

Where did such a monster come from?!

When Chen Qilin saw Cheng Xin evenly trading blows with Reckless Knight, confusion and envy filled his heart.

Chen Qilin’s ultimate goal was to become a three-star mental strength grandmaster. Although he had dreamed of climbing to greater heights, he never thought he could do so, as the realm of pseudo-great grandmasters was simply not within his reach. He also didn’t think he could get acquainted with a pseudo-great grandmaster, at least not with his current strength and status. So, on what basis could a person with no background like Shi Feng recruit the help of a pseudo-great grandmaster?

…

While the spectators outside the battlefield were shocked by the fight between Reckless Knight and Cheng Xin, Death Omen and Thousand Scars were also watching the battle in amazement.

“Since when did Zero Wing get acquainted with such an expert?”

Whether it was Death Omen or Thousand Scars, the two had dealt with Zero Wing quite a lot in the Miniature Ancient World. However, never had they seen Cheng Xin among the members of Zero Wing and its allies.

“Should we still go and help, Big Sis Omen?” Thousand Scars quietly asked, her eyes remaining fixated on the fight between Reckless Knight and Cheng Xin.

“Of course,” Death Omen answered definitively. “By the looks of things, that woman can only keep Reckless Knight at bay for a limited time. If we help her, we can keep him perfectly pinned. Although this is different from our original plan, we can still sell a favor to Zero Wing by doing so.”

Thousand Scars nodded before promptly resuming her advance toward Zero Wing’s capture point and slaughter of Riverlight City’s participants.

…

While Death Omen and Thousand Scars were revising their plans, Gentle Snow, Hidden Soul, Pace Angel, and Clay Blade were quietly watching the fight between Reckless Knight and Cheng Xin, greatly shocked by the two’s performance.

Eventually, Hidden Soul’s curiosity got the better of her as she turned to Shi Feng and asked, “Where did you find such an expert, Guild Leader? Isn’t she a little too strong?”

Although Hidden Soul had long known that Zero Wing was not as simple as it appeared, the current situation greatly exceeded her expectations.

It should be known that Cheng Xin, Desolate Fury, and the others were external reinforcements in this city battle. Because of this, they would experience a delay when manipulating their bodies, and not even fifth-floor experts could mitigate this delay completely.

Yet, even while subjected to this delay, Cheng Xin could still keep Reckless Knight pinned. If this delay did not exist, Hidden Soul couldn’t help but suspect that Cheng Xin could kill Reckless Knight in no time.

Meanwhile, when Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury heard Hidden Soul’s words, they couldn’t help but reveal a helpless smile.

After all, they were talking about the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s Little Princess here. She was the strongest player among the Platinum Realm’s younger generation. Even if she had a delay imposed on her movements, she still wasn’t an opponent that could be defeated by the likes of Reckless Knight, someone ranked at the bottom of the Sacred Glory List.

…

Before Hidden Soul could get an answer from Shi Feng, Reckless Knight suddenly executed a strange footwork to throw Cheng Xin off his tail and arrive in front of Shi Feng.

“She alone isn’t enough to stop me! Now, what other tricks do you have up your sleeves?” Reckless Knight contemptuously said as he looked at Shi Feng. If he couldn’t even get past someone subjected to a movement delay and news of it got out, he could kiss his future in the Paimon Conglomerate goodbye.

After saying so, Reckless Knight swung the one-handed axe in his right hand down at Shi Feng.

53rd Absolute Technique, Shadow Break!

Reckless Knight’s axe transformed into a dark vortex in the blink of an eye, the vortex actively drawing all objects within its vicinity toward itself.

However, just as the dark vortex was about to hit Shi Feng, a sword suddenly came striking at Reckless Knight from an odd angle. Sensing the power behind the unexpected attack, Reckless Knight promptly halted his technique and turned around to defend against the attack.

Boom!

Metal collided, and sparks flew.

Although it sounded like a simple collision between weapons, the resulting shockwave was so intense that Death Omen and Thousand Scars could feel it from over a thousand yards away.

Immediately afterward, a scene that dumbfounded nearly everyone present occurred.

Reckless Knight, who had shown himself to be nigh unstoppable thus far, was sent flying over a dozen yards away…

“Who are you?!”

As soon as Reckless Knight stabilized his footing, he immediately began scrutinizing the shy-looking young man before him.

“Just a nameless Swordsman,” the young man indifferently responded. Then, without giving Reckless Knight any chance to catch his breath, the young man promptly launched a series of follow-up attacks.

The young man used three Absolute Techniques in a row; one technique exhibiting extraordinary strength, one exhibiting astoundingly high attack frequency, and one exhibiting unpredictable attack trajectories.

The three Absolute Techniques working in conjunction shaved off Reckless Knight’s HP rapidly. Yet, the only thing Reckless Knight could do was passively defend himself and nothing else.

On the twelfth time the Swordsman executed his three-technique combination, Reckless Knight finally succumbed to the other party’s attacks and collapsed to the ground.

Subsequently, both the spectators in Star Lake City and Riverlight City fell deathly silent. Even the Riverlight City participants who were in the middle of forming an encirclement around Zero Wing’s battle group had frozen in place…
