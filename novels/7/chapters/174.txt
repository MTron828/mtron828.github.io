Chapter 175 - Demon’s Heart

“Contract?” Shi Feng silently murmured, confused.

From the information he collected in his previous life, there was no mention of a contract. That fortunate player had not revealed this information, so naturally, Shi Feng had no idea. However, since that fortunate player managed to complete the quest, Shi Feng did not believe that he could not complete it himself. After all, he was much stronger than that fortunate player in his previous life, so there was no reason why he couldn’t do it as well.

As long as he completed this quest, he would have the capital to establish himself in White River City.

As for what that capital was...?

Was there even a need to mention it?

To any players new to White River City, there was nothing better than to own their own real estate. Moreover, this real estate wasn’t ordinary; it was one of the noble’s mansions, located in the heart of the Trade Area. Only with a mansion could one establish a Guild Residence.

A Guild Residence was extremely important to a Guild. It was a Guild’s most important benefit, second to none.

Every Guild Residence acted as private territory. The greatest benefits it provided were an increase in leveling speed and unique Resident Quests. As long as a Guild possessed a Residence, all members that rested within could gain a Double EXP buff. With this buff, whether grinding or questing, players could obtain double the original EXP.

However, players needed to rest in the Guild Residence for a certain amount of time to gain the Double EXP buff. Normally, resting for 48 hours would grant a player 20% Double EXP, and players could gain up to an entire level’s worth of Double EXP. To Guild members tired from battle, this feature was fatally tempting.

There were also the special Resident Quests only available in the Guild Residence. The local NPCs commissioned these quests, and there would be some available every day. Moreover, the rewards for these quests were quite bountiful. There were even times that a quest would reward a Dark-Gold ranked item. When these Resident Quests were completed, the Guild would also receive Guild Reputation and Guild funds, as 20% of the remuneration for these Resident Quests would belong to the Guild. However, even though the Guild members only received 80% of the reward money, it was still a great deal more than the reward money of the majority of high-level quests.

Aside from all that, a Guild Residence had many more functions. Thus, a Guild Residence was the core of a Guild.

Unfortunately, it was extremely hard for Guilds to obtain their own Residence. First-rate Guilds could usually not obtain a Residence until more than a month had passed since God’s Domain’s release, not to mention the second-rate and third-rate Guilds. Even after four months, there would still be plenty of third-rate Guilds without Guild Residences.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, Shadow only managed to obtain its first Guild Residence after seven months in God’s Domain. By that time, a majority of the players were already around Level 50 or so. After much difficulty, Shadow only secured a Guild Residence in a relatively isolated city with only a population base of 200,000 to 300,000. From that moment onwards, Shadow had finally begun walking the path of a rated Guild.

In God’s Domain, a Guild would only be officially recognized when they possessed a Guild Residence. Also, the speed at which they procured a Residence displayed the Guild’s strength.

Shi Feng’s goal was to attain his own Guild Residence fifteen days after he entered White River City, and Blackbeard’s recommendation letter was the fastest way to achieve that goal.

“Right, however...” Weissman measured up Shi Feng in detail, shaking his head, saying, “Young man, you are still too weak right now. I’m afraid that you cannot fulfill this contract. Although I don’t understand why Blackbeard places such trust in you, it is still too early for you right now.”

“Lord Weissman, I believe that I am competent enough to complete this quest,” Shi Feng spoke with determination.

Weissman couldn’t help but smile. Young people are so confident. However, they will realize their ignorance when they meet true trouble. He immediately replied, “Young man, how about we make an accord?”

“If you can pass the test I give you, I’ll agree to your request. I will even aid you in completing Blackbeard’s contract. If you fail, however, then please, only return after you have officially become a Swordsman. How about it?”

Shi Feng lowered his head in silent contemplation. Based on what he could recall from his past life, that fortunate player also received his private territory when he was only around Level 10. Meanwhile, Weissman insisted that Shi Feng only return after officially becoming a Swordsman.

At the beginning of the game, players did not actually start out with official classes; they were merely class apprentices. If they wished to receive an official class, a Tier 1 class, they needed to reach Level 20. Players would then need to apply for a class examination at the Class Association. Only when players passed the test would they officially be a Tier 1 class. In Shi Feng’s case, after he passed the class examination, he would officially become a Swordsman. At that time, not only would his Attributes greatly increase, but he could also learn skills that catered to Tier 1 Swordsmen. He would also receive an official Swordsman’s emblem.

If even that Level 10 fortunate player could clear the quest, Shi Feng did not believe that he couldn’t. After all, he was already Level 13; he hadn’t just reached Level 10. Moreover, the equipment he wore was extremely good quality, so there was no reason for him to fail the quest.

“Lord Weissman, I accept your test,” Shi Feng nodded his head in affirmation.

“My requirement is very simple. Bring me a Demon’s Heart. In the Cursed Land, there is a demon’s castle. Originally, it was the residence of a lord. However, after being tempted by a demon, that lord became a demon himself, reborn as the Dark Knight Gaia. He then cursed the land he ruled over, turning all of its people into demonkin. I need you to retrieve Gaia’s heart to dispel this curse. I wonder if you would be willing to go to that cursed castle and kill Dark Knight Gaia, fetching his heart for me?” Weissman asked, his tone stern.

“The Demon’s Castle in the Cursed Land?” Shi Feng could not help his shock.

That was where the apex 20-man Team Dungeon for levels 10 to 15 was. In the past, there had been countless Guilds who experienced team-wipe after team-wipe raiding the Demon’s Castle. They had all died at the hands of Dark Knight Gaia.

“That’s right. If you can’t accomplish even this task, I can only advise you to give up on the contract,” Weissman persuaded.

“Is there a time limit?” Shi Feng asked.

“None. It will be fine even if you complete the task after you’ve been promoted to an official Swordsman,” Weissman smiled.

“Alright, then. I accept this agreement,” Shi Feng released a breath. Most of the players in God’s Domain had yet to reach Level 10. If there were a short time limit, he could not complete this quest at all. If there were no time limit, however, then there would not be any huge problems.

Shi Feng finally understood how that fortunate player completed this quest.

At that time, a large majority of the players had already reached Level 20 or so. The elite team of a third-rate Guild could easily raid and conquer the Demon’s Castle, obtaining the Demon’s Heart. However, to the current Guilds in God’s Domain, it was an impossible task. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At the very least, a team of twenty players was necessary to raid the Demon’s Castle. Moreover, their levels needed to be around Level 12 or Level 13, and they needed to possess adequate equipment. Otherwise, raiding the Demon’s Castle was only a pipe dream.

It seems that I need to hurry up and establish a team. Shi Feng now had an approximate goal in his heart. The Fellowship Party being held in a few days time was an especially a good place for Shi Feng to recruit new members. If he had sufficient capital, he might be able to establish a powerful team. At that time, conquering the Demon’s Castle would be much easier.

Watching Shi Feng leave, Weissman suddenly thought of something. He called at Shi Feng, saying, “Young man, wait a moment! I still have something very important to tell you.”
