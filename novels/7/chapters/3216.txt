Chapter 291 – Eternal Night Upgraded

System: Congratulations! You have awakened Dragon Princess Kalisha and triggered the Legendary World Quest Sanctuary’s Rise.

Quest Content: Collect 100 God Crystals within 100 days to restore Dragon Princess Kalisha’s strength. Rewards unknown.

…

The system notification repeated three times, putting Shi Feng into a daze.

One hundred God Crystals in one hundred days?

Shi Feng couldn’t help but doubt his eyes when he read the system notification before him.

A God Crystal was the crystallization of a God’s power. While it might not be as rare as a Legendary item, its preciousness was not the least beast lower than Fragmented Legendary items.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that 100 God Crystals could be used to exchange 100 Fragmented Legendary items. Moreover, this was only true when one was offering to use God Crystals to trade for Fragmented Legendary items. If one was trying to trade Fragmented Legendary items for God Crystals, the ratio wouldn’t necessarily be 1:1.

Even if all of the hegemonic powers in the Miniature Ancient World worked together, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to come up with 50 God Crystals in 100 days, let alone 100 God Crystals.

This was essentially an impossible quest!

While Shi Feng was in a daze, Firenze suddenly regained his calm, his previous frightened expression nowhere to be seen. There was even a hint of joy in his eyes now.

“It seems the passage of time has weakened you quite a bit, Kalisha. You’re not even at Tier 5 right now,” Firenze said as he looked at Kalisha with a cordial smile. “In that case, you might as well let me see you off one last time. It won’t be a disgrace for you to die by my hands.”

......

After saying so, Firenze promptly began chanting a Spell.

Subsequently, with each syllable Firenze spat out, the lighting in the temple gradually darkened. At the same time, dark mana began flooding the temple and expelling all other elements of mana from the temple.

Shi Feng’s expression turned grave when he saw this scene.

Shi Feng was well aware that Firenze had not gotten serious in the slightest when fighting him previously. The Demon King was only messing around and using a bunch of ordinary Tier 5 Spells against him. Now, though, Firenze was serious.

Dark Tide.

This was a Tier 5 Curse capable of rivaling Tier 6 Spells. This one Spell could eradicate all life within a royal capital with a population of tens of millions. It was a Spell that could neither be blocked nor dodged.

If Firenze was allowed to complete this Spell, Shi Feng would no longer have to worry about completing his Legendary World Quest. After all, nothing would be left of his character’s Tier 4 Immortal Soul if he got hit by this move. His character would cease to exist in God’s Domain, and he would have no choice but to start over from scratch…

As the density of the dark mana in the temple continuously increased, Kalisha suddenly appeared in front of Shi Feng.

Is she really only at Tier 4?

Shi Feng was startled when he saw Kalisha appearing before him all of a sudden. Even though Kalisha’s statistics showed that she was only at Level 130, Tier 4 currently, she was so fast that he didn’t even react to her movements.

Normally, not even a Tier 5 existence’s Movement Speed was fast enough to escape Shi Feng’s perception. The only explanation he could think of was that Kalisha had executed Spatial Leap. This was a movement method that was superior to even Spatial Movement. Normally, only Tier 6 Gods could use this movement method.

“Do you wish to live, heaven’s blessed?” Kalisha asked as she looked at Shi Feng.

“Naturally.” Shi Feng nodded.

“Good. Sigh a Soul Contract with me, then,” Kalisha said. “I will lend you my power. Afterward, you will have to figure out a way to distract Firenze for one minute.”

“A Soul Contract?” Shi Feng frowned.

A Soul Contract was not a normal contract. It was the main method Evil Gods and Demon Gods used to recruit followers. Players who signed a Soul Contract would have to permanently contribute a portion of their soul to the contractor to gain a portion of the contractor’s power.

In the Greater God’s Domain, many players lacking strength would often go down this path to achieve further growth. However, this external power could only provide players with a considerably limited boost in strength. Normally, it would be no different than receiving a God’s blessing. At most, the recipient would see an increase in their Physique and Basic Attributes. Moreover, these bonuses would become negligible once players reached Tier 6.

While receiving a small boost in strength was better than nothing, the price of obtaining this strength was massive.

Firstly, players would permanently lose a portion of their souls. Not only would this increase the death penalty they suffered by several times, but it would also increase the amount of EXP they needed to level up by two or more times.

Secondly and most importantly, when the contractor of a Soul Contract died, the contractee would also follow them to the grave.

Of course, a Soul Contract wasn’t completely without its benefits.

The stronger a contractor was, the greater the power players would gain when they were at a low tier. This was also why many players would willingly strive for the various Evil Gods and Demon Gods.

“Of course, you can also choose not to enter a contract with me,” Kalisha added as she looked at Shi Feng, her bright lips curving into a playful smile. “But in that case, you’ll be dying here with me. I can see that you carry a not-so-small secret on you. Are you really willing to start over?”

“Fine. You win,” Shi Feng said begrudgingly. He couldn’t help but feel that the Main God System was messing with him.

However, the Ancient Abyssal God’s Legacy was not some bargain-bin Legacy. If he were to lose it, no amount of regret could make up for it.

“That’s more like it. Let’s begin immediately, then.” Kalisha smiled and nodded. Then, seeing as Firenze was about to complete his Spell, she quickly drew an ancient divine pattern on the back of Shi Feng’s right hand. “My power is a little special. It cannot enhance your body directly, only your weapon. Fortunately, it seems that you are carrying a good weapon with you.”

As soon as Kalisha finished speaking, a new notification appeared before Shi Feng.

…

System: You have signed a Soul Contract with Dragon Princess Kalisha. You have obtained the Ancient Dragon’s Power. When Ancient Dragon’s Power is activated, you may choose to upgrade the rank of one weapon temporarily. As Dragon Princess Kalisha is currently at Tier 4, the chosen weapon can only be upgraded up to the Legendary rank for 10 minutes. (The first use of Ancient Dragon’s Power will not cost anything. Each subsequent use will cost one God Crystal.)

…

What an unbelievable power! Shi Feng was stunned by the information the system notification conveyed. Although he had long since expected Dragon Princess Kalisha’s power to be extraordinary, he didn’t think it would be this amazing.

However, after seeing what the Dragon Princess’s power could offer, Shi Feng understood why Kalisha could become the Ancient Dragon Sanctuary’s sole ruler and elevate an upper-ranking hegemonic power into an apex power during his previous life.

Even though Kalisha was only at Tier 4 right now, the power she granted him could already upgrade a weapon up to the Legendary rank. If Kalisha were to ascend to Tier 5 or Tier 6, the Ancient Dragon’s Power she granted him would naturally receive an improvement as well. At that time, he might even be able to elevate a weapon into a Divine Artifact.

A Divine Artifact!

This was a weapon countless experts dreamed of obtaining. Just one piece of Divine Equipment was enough to let a Tier 6 God-ranked expert rival Ancient Gods. If a Tier 6 God-ranked expert were to wield a Divine Weapon, they would see an even greater increase in their strength. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, the cost of using Ancient Dragon’s Power was also astonishingly high. Even in its current state, Ancient Dragon’s Power already cost one God Crystal per use. That was equivalent to expending one Fragmented Legendary item for ten minutes of glory. Even hegemonic powers would wince at this price.

However, before Shi Feng could recover from his surprise, Firenze finally finished chanting the last syllable of his incantation.

“Die!”

Firenze bellowed as he released his Dark Tide at Shi Feng and Kalisha.

Immediately, light within the temple seemingly vanished as a tidal wave of darkness appeared and threatened to devour everything within the temple.

Ancient Dragon’s Power!

Shi Feng dared not hold back in this critical moment. Immediately, he used Ancient Dragon’s Power on the Winter of Eternal Night and swung the longsword at the oncoming tidal wave.

Radiant Night!

TL Notes:

I will be using “Divine Weapons” and “Divine Equipment” to refer to Divine Artifact-ranked weapons and equipment. (I will still use Divine Artifact-ranked weapons and equipment when the context isn’t clear enough.)
