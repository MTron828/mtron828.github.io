Chapter 418 – Still Not the Strongest?

When Shi Feng saw that the Dragon Mountain Realm’s players were indeed escorting the approaching caravan, a smile appeared on his face.

There were 50 players in the caravan, and every one was equipped with a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set. Some of these players were even equipped with Legendary Equipment, and one such player was Ghost Hand.

At this time, Ghost Hand was still at Level 140. It hadn’t been more than a day since Shi Feng killed him, so it was obvious that Ghost Hand had indeed negated the death penalty with a substitution tool.

“Can you four take care of Ghost Hand and the three people next to him?” Cheng Xin quietly asked Shi Feng after looking at the approaching caravan.

If not for Amber Soul, Cheng Xin would have never agreed to let Shi Feng’s group of four participate in the commission this time. It wouldn’t have mattered that Shi Feng ranked 963rd on the Luminous Glory List.

Experts on the Luminous Glory List could indeed be considered apex existences of their respective Realms.

However, it was a different story in the Holy Realm. While fifth-floor experts weren’t everywhere, there was still a significant number in the various Saint Camps. It was especially so for older-generation fifth-floor experts. If not for their age, these veteran fifth-floor experts would have long occupied the entire Luminous Glory List, and most, if not all, of the rookie fifth-floor experts would be pushed out of the list.

“No problem,” Shi Feng nonchalantly responded.

“Just keep them busy for ten minutes. Me and Big Brother Amber will take care of the older generation experts, so make sure Ghost Hand doesn’t interrupt us,” Cheng Xin said, displeased by Shi Feng’s behavior. “If they interrupt us, none of you should think of getting paid.”

“Don’t worry. Ghost Hand’s group won’t get anywhere near you,” Shi Feng affirmed.

Keep on boasting! Let’s see how you’ll beg for my help later! Cheng Xin smirked when she heard Shi Feng’s confident reply.

The three players walking next to Ghost Hand were at the pseudo-fifth-floor standard. While Leroja, Cross, and Desolate Fury might be powerful experts, they were still a ways off from matching pseudo-fifth-floor experts. So, Shi Feng would essentially have to go against one fifth-floor expert and three pseudo-fifth-floor experts by himself.

Shortly after Cheng Xin finished speaking, the caravan moved within 300 yards of the team.

“Attack!” Flint shouted through the team chat.

Although the Tier 5 Isolation Scroll could put up to 50 people under Stealth, the effects of Stealth would only work against fifth-floor experts up to a certain distance. Within 300 yards, Stealth would become useless against a fifth-floor expert. So, if they wanted to launch a sneak attack, the best time would be immediately after the caravan entered within 300 yards of them.

Immediately, everyone on Flint’s team left their hiding spots and charged at the caravan, their speed catching the caravan’s titled experts off guard. Only the caravan’s fifth-floor experts and pseudo-fifth-floor experts managed to react to the ambush right away.

“These suicidal bastards! Kill them!”

Of the 50 players on the Heavenly God Corporation’s team, over 30 reacted to the ambush, promptly charging at the ambushing team’s fifth-floor experts and pseudo-fifth-floor experts and ignoring the titled experts.

As both sides were even on numbers, the fifth-floor experts and pseudo-fifth-floor experts of both teams chose to fight on their own, and those who were extras targeted the titled experts. In the blink of an eye, numerous independent battles took place all over the street.

There were two reasons these experts had chosen to fight independently.

Firstly, experts of their caliber would rarely fight coordinated battles.

Secondly, even if they fought in coordination, they would still have difficulty achieving a swift victory against opponents of the same combat standards. All they’d be doing was wasting time. So, rather than working together, it’d be more efficient if they targeted the opponent’s weaker links before tackling the fifth-floor experts together afterward.

The Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s ambush team clearly outnumbered the Heavenly God Corporation’s team when it came to fifth-floor experts and pseudo-fifth-floor experts, with the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s team having as many as 15 fifth-floor experts and 22 pseudo-fifth-floor experts. In comparison, although the Heavenly God Corporation’s team had 24 pseudo-fifth-floor experts, it only had 12 fifth-floor experts.

At the end of the day, fifth-floor experts were stronger than pseudo-fifth-floor experts. One fifth-floor expert could easily keep three pseudo-fifth-floor experts busy. Moreover, the pseudo-fifth-floor experts would be at high risk of getting killed if they weren’t careful.

Because of this difference, it didn’t take long before the Heavenly God Corporation’s team fell into a rough spot.

“It’s not too late to retreat now, Old Kong!” Flint excitedly said while waving his staff and bombarding a white-haired old man with countless fire blades. “Otherwise, once we have more hands on our side, none of you should think of escaping with your lives!”

The Heavenly God Corporation’s team was far less prepared than they expected. The two extra fifth-floor experts on their side were more than enough to give them an insurmountable advantage. In fact, the two extra fifth-floor experts were already in the process of slaughtering the titled experts on the Heavenly God Corporation’s team.

“Do you think I’ve lived all these years in vain, Flint? Did you think I didn’t expect you to ambush us?” the white-haired old man said, his expression remaining unfazed even when he saw the mercenaries he hired falling one after another. “You’re the ones who are going to die here today!”

“You and what army?”

Flint looked at the white-haired old man with disdain in his eyes. He and the white-haired old man were evenly matched in combat standards, and neither had ever won a fight against the other. They were also the highest authority of their respective organizations in the Holy Realm, so they were fully aware of the cards each other possessed.

Now that the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s had two fifth-floor experts in excess, taking down the Heavenly God Corporation’s team would be a piece of cake.

In response to Flint’s taunt, the white-haired old man suddenly smiled and said, “The Illusory Sea Realm’s Hidden Wind.”

Flint’s expression instantly changed when he heard the white-haired old man’s words. Then, with a look of horror, he shouted:

“Retreat! Everyone retreat!”

The Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s team members were confused by Flint’s sudden call for retreat. It was especially so for Cheng Xin, who was busy fighting against a veteran fifth-floor expert. After all, their team had an absolute advantage over the Heavenly God Corporation’s team. It simply didn’t make sense to retreat in this situation.

However, before Cheng Xin and everyone else could make sense of Flint’s command, a white-clad young man suddenly appeared above the street and quietly looked down on the battle beneath him.

“Hidden…Wind…”

Cheng Xin’s complexion instantly paled when she saw the young man in the sky.

Hidden Wind!

The strongest player out of the Illusory Sea Realm’s younger generation!

From a broad perspective, the Illusory Sea Realm was evenly matched with the Dragon Mountain Realm and the Platinum Realm. However, Hidden Wind stood at a height that none of the younger paragons of the three Realms could ever hope to reach.

This was because Hidden Wind ranked 42nd on the Luminous Glory List!

At the same time, he ranked among the top 10 of the Greater God’s Domain’s younger generation Swordsmen!

Before Cheng Xin could react any further, Hidden Wind unsheathed a bladeless sword and swung it. Then, an extraordinary amount of mana fell on Cheng Xin, making her feel as if the sky was falling on her.

At the same time, every fifth-floor expert on the battlefield felt a chill crawling down their back, their mind shouting that death was approaching.

Crashing Moon!

This was an Exclusive Absolute Technique created by Hidden Wind via fusing two Absolute Techniques, and it was a Gold Combat Technique that wasn’t a Gold Combat Technique!
