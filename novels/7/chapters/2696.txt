Chapter 2697 – Inspecting Zero Wing

Zero Wing Tower’s lobby:

With a ceiling soaring nine meters high, the lobby looked very much like a small stadium. Aside from the reception for visitors, it also had a cafe and a lounge area, as well as a virtual combat platform for the Guild’s internal members to entertain themselves and visitors.

Due to these reasons, quite a lot of people had gathered in the lobby.

When Muxin and her companions entered the lobby, they quickly noticed several hundred people thronged the virtual combat platform. These people were spectating a duel between Zero Wing’s internal members, and the scene was very lively.

After seeing Muxin’s group entering the lobby, one of the front desk receptionists approached them and asked, “Hello, are you here to look around Zero Wing’s headquarters? Or do you have other business to attend to here?”

“My two nieces are interested in Zero Wing, so I brought them here for a visit today,” Uncle Hong explained with a smile.

“Certainly.” The receptionist smiled and took out four visitor cards. “You may visit up to the ninth floor with this visitor card. The floors beyond are only for internal members. If you have any questions after your tour, feel free to consult with the front desk.”

“Thank you.” Uncle Hong nodded and accepted the visitor cards.

Afterward, the receptionist returned to her position at the front desk and allowed Muxin’s group to roam about the building freely.

“Zero Wing sure is generous. They’re actually allowing outsiders to tour their headquarters. This will save us a lot of trouble,” Kerui commented in surprise as she received a visitor card from Uncle Hong.

Usually, the various large Guilds would place tight restrictions on their headquarters. Aside from the lobby, they generally wouldn’t allow outsiders to visit other locations.

“They might be trying to lure more people to join Zero Wing,” Muxin said. She more or less understood Zero Wing’s circumstances.

Although Zero Wing was prospering in God’s Domain, it remained an unknown entity in the real world. Despite having gone to great lengths to secure a Guild headquarters, Zero Wing still lacked talents.

Letting visitors tour its headquarters would undoubtedly give players unaware of Zero Wing’s existence a better understanding of the Guild.

“There are quite a few people here, but it’s a pity that there are hardly any experts. Even the two people dueling are only at the Half-step Refinement Realm,” Kerui commented as she looked at the battle taking place at the virtual combat platform. She could tell the two duelists’ combat standards at a glance. “I think we should be more cautious when partnering with such a Guild. Our plan involves a lot of things. If outsiders see that we can’t even find capable helpers, they’ll start looking down on Frost Heaven.”

However, even after Kerui finished speaking, Uncle Hong, Muxin, and Tian Cheng surprisingly remained silent as they stared at a group of young men and women standing among the crowd.

“How unexpected! Zero Wing really cannot be underestimated. They’ve actually kept such talents hidden,” Uncle Hong praised as he looked at the several youths. “Talents?” Kerui stared at those ordinary-looking youths in confusion. “Young Miss, you shouldn’t underestimate those people. Although their auras aren’t apparent, they are bona fide experts. That blue-haired guy, in particular, has completely restrained his aura. If I hadn’t scrutinized him, I’m afraid I wouldn’t even be aware of his existence,” Tian Cheng, the seemingly vulnerable and honest youth standing beside Kerui, explained quietly. “Honestly, I’m not confident I can win against him.”

“How is that possible?” Tian Cheng’s words stunned Kerui. She suspected that the latter was joking with her.

Tian Cheng was one of the peerless geniuses Frost Heaven cultivated. Not only had he reached the Domain Realm at a young age, but he also had a naturally gifted brain. His processing speed was much faster than ordinary people’s. Even the older-generation Domain Realm experts wouldn’t necessarily be his match.

How could Zero Wing possibly cultivate an expert rivaling Tian Cheng?

“They shouldn’t be Zero Wing members,” Muxin suddenly said.

“They’re not?” Uncle Hong was slightly surprised.

For such youthful experts to appear in Zero Wing’s headquarters, how could they not be Zero Wing members?

“I’ve seen their information before. Although they look somewhat different in God’s Domain, their appearances are roughly the same. That blue-haired youth should be Solitary Frost, the strongest of Azure’s younger generation. I heard even Violet Sword values him greatly,” Muxin explained.

Unlike Uncle Hong, who managed the Guild from behind the scenes, Muxin was responsible for the Guild’s intelligence network. Hence, she had a much better understanding of God’s Domain’s various powers than Uncle Hong-especially when it came to the various superpowers’ younger generation. She placed great importance on collecting such information.

“Why would Azure’s peerless genius run all the way here?” Kerui grew even more puzzled at this revelation.

The various superpowers treasured their peerless geniuses. They would shower these geniuses with all sorts of precious resources and require them to undergo strict training regimens every day. They wouldn’t let these people leave their headquarters at will. Tian Cheng was a similar case. If not to inspect Zero Wing’s strength this time, he wouldn’t have received permission to leave Frost Heaven’s headquarters.

“Zero Wing really is interesting. Not only did Azure’s peerless genius come running over, but so did an old fellow from Azure,” Uncle Hong said as he gazed at a cool-headed, middle-aged man resting and drinking tea in a corner of the lobby.

“Old fellow?” When Kerui checked the focus of Uncle Hong’s attention, her mouth dropped wide open subconsciously.

The man Uncle Hong was looking at was none other than Duan Hanshan, the strongest person of the Duan family’s second generation. Duan Hanshan’s reputation in the virtual gaming industry was in no way inferior to Uncle Hong’s.

Or, to put it in another way, she had grown up listening to the stories of these men.

For such a bigshot to visit Zero Wing’s headquarters personally was definitely big news.

At the same time Hong Xinyuan noticed Duan Hanshan, Duan Hanshan also noticed Hong Xinyuan’s presence. The two of them then smiled at each other.

“Come. Let’s head over,” Hong Xinyuan said, smiling.

After saying so, Hong Xinyuan made his way to Duan Hanshan. As for Muxin and the others, they obediently followed him while bating their breaths.

“Old Hong, what brings you here?” Duan Hanshan greeted Hong Xinyuan with a smile.

“My two nieces are interested in Zero Wing, so I came to look around,” Hong Xinyuan replied perfunctorily. “However, I’m curious as to why the western continent’s Ice Demon is here. There still shouldn’t be much interaction between the eastern and western continents.” The Azure Chamber of Commerce mainly operated on the western continent, and the businesses it had on the eastern continent were very few. No matter how he thought about it, there shouldn’t be much contact between Azure and Zero Wing.

Narrowing his eyes, Duan Hanshan refused to believe a single word from Hong Xinyuan’s mouth. He then stroked his beard and said flatly, “It’s nothing. I just brought some of Azure’s newcomers for a training meeting with Zero Wing.” “You guys are here for training?’

Hong Xinyuan reflexively arched a brow at Duan Hanshan, doubt coloring his face.

Let alone Hong Xinyuan, even Kerui thought Duan Hanshan was messing with them. Although she was a newcomer who had just entered the virtual gaming industry recently, she knew that the Azure Chamber of Commerce possessed an extraordinary foundation. It stood high above ordinary superpowers.

In comparison, Zero Wing was a new Guild that had just emerged along with God’s Domain. Who would believe that Azure would send its top talents to receive training from Zero Wing?

“What? Don’t believe me?” Duan Hanshan chuckled.

“If we were in a Super Guild’s headquarters, I would definitely believe you, but Zero Wing?” Hong Xinyuan chuckled and shook his head.

Some Guild operations indeed had to be kept confidential and could not be disclosed to outsiders. However, in Hong Xinyuan’s opinion, Duan Hanshan’s excuse was simply too poor. Saying that Azure’s top talents had come to teach Zero Wing’s newcomers would be more believable.

“I knew you wouldn’t believe me.” Duan Hanshan’s smile grew even brighter when he heard Hong Xinyuan’s reply. He then pointed at the nearby virtual combat platform and said, “We’re going to have a coaching battle with Zero Wing in a moment. Since you don’t believe me, how about we make a bet?”

“Bet? How are we betting?” Hong Xinyuan asked out of curiosity.

“Didn’t you bring a newcomer too?” Duan Hanshan glanced at Tian Cheng. Calmly, he said, “I can see he’s quite good. How about you have him replace one of my newcomers? However, this is a precious spot, so I can’t just let your newcomer join for free. I’ll have to collect five bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid as a deposit.”

Hong Xinyuan nearly choked at Duan Hanshan’s proposal. Not only was Duan Hanshan asking his side to contribute manpower, but he was even asking for five bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid. Duan Hanshan was too shameless!

“Don’t be in a hurry to reject me.” Upon seeing Hong Xinyuan’s dark face, Duan Hanshan added, “If you win this bet, I’ll pay you back double.”

“It seems you’re quite optimistic of Zero Wing’s members.” Hong Xinyuan was somewhat surprised.

Ten bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid were enough to supply a top talent for half a year-a significant amount to any superpower. “Sort of.” Duan Hanshan nodded. “However, if you lose, you’ll have to compensate me with an additional ten bottles.”

“...” Hong Xinyuan was momentarily at a loss for words.

Why did Duan Hanshan make it sound as if they would lose no matter what?

When had Frost Heaven’s reputation fallen to such a degree?

“How about it? Wanna bet?” Duan Hanshan asked hastily when Hong Xinyuan remained silent for some time.

However, Hong Xinyuan wasn’t a young and arrogant rookie. He didn’t pay any attention to Duan Hanshan’s goading at all. Instead, he turned to look at the honest-looking Tian

Cheng.

“Tian Cheng, what do you think?” Hong Xinyuan asked.
