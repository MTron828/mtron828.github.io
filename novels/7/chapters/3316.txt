Chapter 391 – Great Sinner Black Flame

All Ancient Gods will become hostile to me?

Shi Feng gasped when he saw the system notification.

Ancient Gods were the pinnacle of power in the Greater God’s Domain. They were also the current rulers of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twelve Sanctuaries. After reaching Tier 6, if players wished to develop themselves further, they were bound to have dealings with these Ancient Gods sooner or later.

Normally, Tier 6 experts would have to go to great lengths just to gain a few Favorability points from an Ancient God. Yet, wielding the Shadow Incinerator would instantly cause the Ancient Gods’ Favorability of him to plummet to negative 3,000 points, which was also the requirement for the Hostile status threshold.

!!

At this abysmal Favorability, any Ancient God he encountered would almost certainly attack him without question. In other words, wielding the Shadow Incinerator would mean severing his path as a Tier 6 player.

Do I become its wielder?

Shi Feng hesitated as he looked at the carbonized sword before him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Honestly, it no longer mattered whether the Shadow Incinerator before him was the real deal or an imitation. From the powerful Divine Might it previously radiated, there was no doubt it was a Divine Artifact-ranked weapon.

There weren’t many chances to obtain a Divine Weapon in the Greater God’s Domain. If he missed this chance, he might never come across another for the rest of his life.

Yet, becoming the Shadow Incinerator’s wielder would also mean becoming enemies with the entire Greater God’s Domain.

Although the myriad Ancient Gods would almost never show themselves in the Greater God’s Domain, players who have reached the apex of the Greater God’s Domain would know that the myriad Ancient Gods had never disappeared. On the contrary, they were the de facto owners of many historical ruins and NPC forces. They even controlled the resources necessary for players to become three-star mental strength grandmasters.

Without the Ancient Gods’ resources, the difficulty for players to become three-star mental strength grandmasters in the real world would increase tenfold.

…

System: You have three seconds left to decide.

System: You have two seconds left to decide.

System: You have one second left to decide.

…

To hell with it!

When the timer was about to reach zero, Shi Feng reached out and held onto the Shadow Incinerator’s hilt.

Despite having many dealings with the Ancient Gods during his previous life, he had still failed to get his hands on a Divine Weapon. All he got in return was a bunch of apex powers coming after his head.

If he had a Divine Weapon in hand back then, those apex powers wouldn’t have dared to hunt him so openly.

Now that he had a chance to get his hands on a Divine Weapon, so what if he had to become enemies with the myriad Ancient Gods?

It should be known that Ife, the Crimson Wing, had slain eight Ancient Gods with the Shadow Incinerator. If not for Ife suddenly going missing, her name would have definitely been among the Greater God’s Domain’s Sixteen Great Tier 6 NPCs.

After Shi Feng became the Shadow Incinerator’s wielder, the weapon’s full Attribute Panel appeared before him.

…

A Godly Relic? Shi Feng was dumbfounded when he saw the Shadow Incinerator’s stats.

Godly Relics were different from other items. They were items that had existed since the birth of God’s Domain and were not specifically categorized. As a result, Godly Relics could vary drastically in strength, with stronger ones being superior to even Divine Artifacts and weaker ones being inferior to even Legendary items.

However, the Shadow Incinerator was clearly among the top end of Godly Relics in terms of strength. Despite having four seals placed on it, the Shadow Incinerator was still stronger than Fragmented Legendary Weapons. In terms of Basic Attributes, it was already close to matching Legendary Equipment.

If all of the Shadow Incinerator’s seals were removed, he couldn’t even begin to imagine how powerful it could become.

If Shi Feng had to point out a flaw with the Shadow Incinerator, it would have to be the weapon being overly extreme. The Active Skills that came with the weapon were double-edged weapons that should never be used unless absolutely necessary.

Honestly, even using it normally was a huge problem. Currently, Shi Feng was experiencing searing pain in his mind just by holding onto the Shadow Incinerator. If he had to fight while suffering through this pain, there was no way he could give the fight his all.

However, Shi Feng also had to admit that the Shadow Incinerator was truly powerful. In his current state, he could exhibit strength near the Tier 6 standard even through his normal attacks. If he executed a combat technique, he could most certainly exhibit Tier 6 power.

While Shi Feng was inspecting the carbonized sword in his hand, he suddenly received a series of system notifications.

…

System: You have accepted the Greater God’s Domain’s Mythical Main Storyline Quest Incinerator’s Shadow.

Quest Content: Undo all of the Shadow Incinerator’s seals. Rewards unknown. Penalties unknown.

System: All Ancient Gods have become hostile to you.

System: You have received the Great Sinner title.

…

As soon as the system notifications ended, the color of Shi Feng’s ID instantly went from white to black. On top of that, his ID was now surrounded by dark fog, an indicator of his identity as a Great Sinner.

“Crap! Isn’t this too much?!” Shi Feng couldn’t help but curse as he looked at his ID.

Dark Players who murdered other players all day long could, at most, become a Sinner. Even the sin of murdering an ancient empire’s emperor would only turn one into a Sinner and cause one to be hunted by the NPCs of said empire.

In comparison, players who became Great Sinners would not only be hunted by all NPCs, but even players would be tempted to join in on the hunt. This was because anyone who managed to capture a Great Sinner could turn the latter in to the Adventurer’s Association for a piece of Legendary Equipment that had high compatibility with them.

To make matters worse, once players became a Great Sinner, they could never get rid of the title. It was a soul-bound title, and it would follow them even if they started a new account.

Before Shi Feng could swear a few more times, the space above the altar suddenly shattered, revealing a space-time passage. Then, a 20-meter-tall giant emerged from the passage, the giant wearing a white robe that fully hid their appearance.

When this giant appeared, Shi Feng felt as if a bomb had gone off in his head.

Immediately afterward, a tsunami-like Divine Might, far stronger than even the Shadow Incinerator’s, spread from the giant.

…

[? ? ?] (Ancient God)

Level ? ? ?

HP ? ? ? ? ? ?

…

“Great Sinner Black Flame! Receive the judgment of the Gods!”

Before the giant’s furious shout could reverberate across the cavern, the giant summoned an axe of light in their hand and swung it at Shi Feng.

…

TL Notes:

For the Shadow Incinerator’s description, note that I have changed “Additional Profound Inheritance 1/2” -> “Additional Active Skill 1/2”.

The raws translate to “Additional Profound Skill,” which leads me to believe that the author made a typo.
