Chapter 3668 - 742 - Legendary Guard VS Void Leviathan

“Am I dreaming?”

“Level 212, Tier 6? How can such a Personal Guard exist?”

The Holy Guard’s members and the spectating human powers were greatly confused when they saw Los Merin.

Personal Guards were a feature available to both human and Holy Race players. Hence, both races were familiar with the existence of Personal Guards. For this reason, they knew how difficult it was to develop Personal Guards to Tier 6 and how powerful Tier 6 Personal Guards could be.

However, rather than Los Merin’s tier, what truly confused everyone was his level.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Level 212!

Outside the Eternal Realm, Personal Guards of this level were relatively common, and nobody would fuss about seeing one. However, in the current Eternal Realm, a Level 212 Personal Guard was virtually invincible. It also wasn’t a level that was supposed to exist in the current Eternal Realm.

Be it in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain or the Holy Race’s Greater God’s Domain, Level 200 was a massive turning point. Upon reaching Level 200, the Basic Attributes of players, monsters, and NPCs would experience a qualitative transformation. Even the most ordinary Level 200, Tier 6 NPC could easily dominate a city populated by only Tier 6 players under Level 200, ensuring nobody would dare to make trouble in the city.

This was also why, despite having such powerful forces already, none of the Holy Race powers dared to attack the Eternal Realm’s various NPC Cities.

Any random NPC City in the Eternal Realm would have more than one Level 200-plus, Tier 6 NPC guarding it. If Tier 6 players under Level 200 tried to attack these cities, even if they attacked in a massive army, their actions would be no different than suicide.

So, how could they not be shocked and frightened now that there was a Level 212 Personal Guard before them?

Although many players had already started to recruit Personal Guards in the various NPC Cities, the NPCs they recruited were only around Level 190. While Level 200-plus NPCs existed in the Eternal Realm, they were typically big shots of their respective cities, and recruiting them was nigh impossible.

“A Level 212, Tier 6 Personal Guard?” Daystar, standing atop the Void Leviathan, also looked surprised when she saw the Dragon Knight Los Merin. However, the surprise in her eyes quickly faded as she indifferently said, “Had you used this trump card against any other legion, you would have indeed been undefeatable. Unfortunately, your opponent is the Void Leviathan. Even a Level 212 Personal Guard will have to disappear along with the resurrection camp here!”

At the same time as Daystar finished speaking, the Void Leviathan unleashed the energy it had been charging with its eighteen heads.

In an instant, eighteen radiant beams shot out from the Void Leviathan’s mouths and converged to form a miniature world that covered a 5,000-yard radius. Then, this miniature world descended upon the Soul Lake Resurrection Camp. In the meantime, Frey and the others found themselves immobilized due to the pressure exerted by the miniature world. They felt as if they were stuck between two converging worlds, and all they could do was wait for death to claim them.

…

What a pity…

Verdant Rainbow couldn’t help but sigh when she saw the Void Leviathan’s attack.

As Daystar mentioned, had Los Merin’s opponent not been the Void Leviathan, he could have absolutely defended the Soul Lake Resurrection Camp. It wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to say that he could render the Sun Dynasty powerless against the resurrection camp.

Unfortunately, the Void Leviathan was no ordinary Ferocious Beast. It was an existence capable of devouring all existences, and even Ancient Gods of the same level were fearful of them. In terms of combat power, a Level 193 Void Leviathan was superior to even Level 200, Tier 6 Gods, let alone a Level 212, Tier 6 Personal Guard.

While Verdant Rainbow was lamenting Zero Wing’s fate, Los Merin suddenly appeared in the miniature world’s path of descent with his shield raised. Evidently, he planned to receive the Void Leviathan’s attack head-on to protect the resurrection camp.

Boom!

A loud explosion occurred, followed by a powerful shock wave that shook the entire Soul Lake. The shock wave was so intense that even the sky had turned into a dark void.

It seems Zero Wing will still lose in the end. Verdant Rainbow sighed deeply as she looked at the Magic Mirror.

It was indeed surprising that Zero Wing had a Level 212, Tier 6 Personal Guard hidden under its sleeve, but the Soul Lake Resurrection Camp’s defenders were still weaker than the Holy Guard. Meanwhile, now that everyone in the resurrection camp had been annihilated, even if Zero Wing’s main force members were still alive, the resurrection camp’s defenders no longer had the ability to defend the camp over a long period.

However, just as Verdant Rainbow was about to command her flying ship’s pilot to leave the Soul Lake, the Magic Mirror before her suddenly revealed a figure standing amidst the void.

How is this possible?! Verdant Rainbow gaped in shock as she stared into the Magic Mirror. That’s an attack that can repel an Ancient God of the same level! How can he survive that?!

At this time, under the shattered sky, the Soul Lake Resurrection Camp could be seen perfectly intact. In fact, it wasn’t just the resurrection camp that was in perfect shape. Even the Dragon Knight Los Merin looked no different from before.

“Attack!”

Before anyone could react to this unexpected turn of events, Blue Phoenix commanded Los Merin to retaliate against the Void Leviathan.

In response, Los Merin summoned a spear into his hand and thrust it in the Void Leviathan’s direction. At the same time, three magic arrays abruptly appeared above the Void Leviathan.

Threefold Tier 6 Super Spell, Spirit Impact Spear!

When the Void Leviathan saw the magic arrays above its head, it instinctively launched another breath attack with its eighteen heads. However, it was too late to disrupt the magic arrays’ formation as a molten spear clad in flames had already emerged from them. Then, the molten spear could be seen colliding with the dazzling miniature world created by the Void Leviathan.

Boom!

The molten spear passed through the Void Leviathan’s miniature world unhindered. Then, it proceeded to strike the Void Leviathan out of the air and pinned it to the ground, the impact creating a crater that had a radius of tens of thousands of yards. Not only that, but the Void Leviathan also lost a huge chunk of its HP and three of its heads, becoming heavily injured. As for the remaining fifteen heads, fear colored their eyes as they looked up at Los Merin.

“So strong!”

“He heavily injured a Level 193 Void Leviathan in one hit!”

“Crap! What rank is that Personal Guard?”

The various spectating powers were shocked when they saw the heavily injured Void Leviathan.

It should be known that a Level 193 Void Leviathan was stronger than even Level 200, Tier 6 Gods. Yet, it fared no differently than a lizard before Los Merin…
