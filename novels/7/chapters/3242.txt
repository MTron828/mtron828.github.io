Chapter 3243 - Chapter 317 - Tier 5 Magic Equipment

Chapter 317 – Tier 5 Magic Equipment

Over a dozen streaks of light descended upon Temple No. 8’s plaza as Leroja and the other Heavenly Boa members arrived.

Many players had come to participate in the Rookie Competition this time, so there was a huge crowd outside every temple in the Ancient River Secret Land’s outer perimeter, and Temple No. 8 was no exception. When Leroja’s group arrived via teleportation, the many players in the plaza couldn’t help but turn to look at them out of curiosity.

“Crap! Why is Empress Blood Arrow here?! Didn’t the rumors say that she has stopped competing among the younger generation?!”

“Why would she? She looks no more than 25 to me. You talk as if she’s very old.”

!!

“Do you not know? It is true that Empress Blood Arrow is still young, but Heavenly Boa has arranged for her to withdraw from the younger generation’s competition so that it can better highlight its new once-in-a-century paragon. If not for this arrangement, her name would most likely be among the Battle of Geniuses’ top three.”

“Could Empress Blood Arrow be here to kill the guy who killed Unforgettable Leaf?”

“I don’t think so. We’re not even in the same plaza as Black Flame. If Empress Blood Arrow really intends on going after Black Flame, she would have gone to Black Flame’s plaza instead. That way, she would at least have a chance of getting paired into the same batch as Black Flame during the preliminaries. If she stays in our plaza, she can only meet Black Flame once the top 100 participants have been decided.”

Many of the various hegemonic powers’ experts present were surprised to see Leroja appearing in their plaza. At the same time, they couldn’t help but wonder why she had come here.

It should be known that Leroja was a legendary individual among the Myriad Forest Empire’s younger generation. There was no way she would appear in this place without any reason.

Subsequently, Leroja and her entourage could be seen approaching a sloppy man lying under the shade of a tree in the plaza. When the dozen or so Heavenly Boa members following Leroja saw this sloppy man, feelings of reverence and joy appeared on their faces.

“Who’s that sloppy Berserker? Why are Heavenly Boa’s members treating him with such reverence?”

“Maybe they got the wrong person? I saw that guy’s performance just now, and he only got through the preliminaries’ first round because he got lucky and didn’t come across anyone throughout the entire round. Otherwise, with the tattered equipment he is wearing, any player he came across could have easily eliminated him.”

The surrounding crowd grew puzzled when they saw Heavenly Boa’s young experts behaving respectfully to the sloppy man.

The sloppy man was not only old, looking like he was already nearing his mid-thirties, but he also didn’t exude the slightest bit of aura. He didn’t have any decent weapons and equipment on him, either. It wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to say that he was inferior to ordinary Tier 4 players, let alone Heavenly Boa’s members. Logically, it should be impossible for the sloppy man to have any connection with Heavenly Boa’s young geniuses.

“Wait, I’ve seen him before! I think he’s Markless Blade, one of Heavenly Boa’s Seven Great Paragons!”

“Markless Blade? You mean the expert who caused a huge uproar in the Myriad Forest Empire over a decade ago?”

“No way! No matter how I look at him, he’s just an ordinary person. How could he be the same person as the madman who defeated several of the empire’s top paragons back then?”

When the surrounding crowd looked at the sloppy and lazy-looking man sitting before Heavenly Boa’s members, they found it hard to believe that this was the same person as the man who had defeated several of the Myriad Forest Empire’s top paragons over a decade ago.

Moreover, in addition to that achievement, the man known as Markless Blade used to offer guidance to the current Twin Saints Alliance’s Saint Three. After Saint Three rose to fame in the Ancient River Kingdom, the two of them had even fought each other in a duel in the Myriad Forest Empire. Unfortunately, the duel wasn’t broadcasted to the public, so outsiders only knew the duel had ended in a draw and nothing more.

Originally, everyone thought Markless Blade would be a strong contender for the Myriad Forest Empire’s top three geniuses back then. However, to many players’ disappointment, Markless Blade never participated in the Myriad Forest Empire’s Battle of Geniuses.

Meanwhile, the current Markless Blade was like a completely different person compared to his past self. Not only did he have no vigor whatsoever, but even his Life Rating felt incredibly low. It was as if his soul had been severely damaged, and he was nowhere near as strong as before. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Lord Markless Blade?”

When the young Guardian Knight from Heavenly Boa looked at the dull and sloppy man before him, he couldn’t help but grow puzzled and worried. The current Markless Blade had no aura whatsoever, and even a youngster like him could see that Markless Blade’s posture was full of holes. He found it very hard to believe that such a person had managed to fight the Twin Saints Alliance’s Saint Three to a standstill.

“Even you are here, Leroja?” Markless Blade said as he glanced at Leroja and the young Guardian Knight who had walked up to him. “It seems those Grand Elders have a job for me, huh?”

“Lord Markless, someone has eliminated Unforgettable Leaf in the first round of the preliminaries, and this has severely affected the Guild’s plans. Moreover, many of the Ancient River Kingdom’s powers have started to doubt Heavenly Boa’s strength because of this incident. This is going to negatively affect the Guild’s development plans in the kingdom,” the young Guardian Knight said, nodding. “So, the Grand Elders hope you can teach the offender a lesson.”

“Someone eliminated Unforgettable Leaf in the first round?” Markless Blade’s eyes widened a little, a hint of surprise appearing in his turbid eyes. “Is it the Ancient River Kingdom’s paragons? …No, it shouldn’t be them. They would have more or less spared him out of respect for Heavenly Boa.”

“Indeed, it isn’t them. Instead, the offender is a newcomer to the Ancient River Kingdom going by the name of Black Flame,” the Guardian Knight explained. “According to the Seven luminaries Alliance’s evaluation, Black Flame’s strength is superior to Saint Nine and can possibly rival the current Saint Three.”

“That’s interesting. If that guy can rival Saint Three, he can indeed kill Unforgettable Leaf,” Markless Blade said, laughing as he got up from the ground. “When I taught Void Talk to that kid, I told him he couldn’t rely on it too much since the technique isn’t meant to be used defensively but to diversify his attacks instead. It seems he didn’t listen to my warning.”

Markless Blade’s words greatly shocked the young Guardian Knight.

The young Guardian Knight never thought that Markless Blade was responsible for teaching Unforgettable Leaf the Void Walk he now knew.

It should be known that Unforgettable Leaf had relied on Void Walk to rise to prominence in the Myriad Forest Empire. Even the Sixth Paragon Impact Giant had to expend much effort to kill Unforgettable Leaf because of this technique.

However, the young Guardian Knight couldn’t help but inwardly sigh in lamentation a moment later.

After all, Markless Blade’s former glory was all but gone now. The man even gave off a spiritless and weak feeling. How could he possibly fight against Black Flame in such a state?

Meanwhile, Markless Blade smiled when he saw the change in the young Guardian Knight’s expression. He could naturally tell what was going through the other party’s mind.

Suddenly, an overbearing aura erupted from Markless Blade’s body, and a mana pillar rose around him, reaching one hundred meters into the sky. Then, a powerful mental oppression spread from Markless Blade, causing the young Guardian Knight to stumble two steps back, his face pale.

At the same time, Markless Blade’s tattered chest plate began repairing itself rapidly. In less than five seconds, the tattered armor had transformed into a piece of divine armor that exuded endless power. The recovery of this armor also caused Markless Blade’s Life Rating to increase substantially.

“This is… Tier 5 Magic Equipment?!”

The young Guardian Knight was astonished as he looked at the divine armor Markless Blade wore.
