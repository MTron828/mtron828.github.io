Chapter 2579 – Crimson-eyed Sword Saint

Upon hearing Fire Dance’s report, Shi Feng fell silent for a very long time. What was going on?

NPCs?

One Tier 5 NPC and two Tier 4 NPCs at that?

According to his information, Poison City had no such NPCs. It was a city of the dead. No living creatures could survive in this secret land.

“Should we retreat, Guild Leader?” Fire Dance asked.

They might not have a problem with Tier 4 NPCs. With their numerical advantage and the Ring of Gospel’s effects, they might stand a chance against two Tier 4 NPCs, but trying to take on a Tier 5 Sword Saint was a joke. A Tier 5 Sword Saint was an apex being in the current God’s Domain. Not even kingdoms would dare to offend such an individual. And a Tier 5 Sword Saint could slay Tier 3 players as easily as chopping vegetables.

A Tier 5 NPCs combat standards were no trivial matter. They could even contend with Void Realm experts.

To deal with a Tier 5 NPC, they’d need several dozen fully armed Tier 4 experts to stand a chance.

“No, wait there for now. We’ll come find you,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

He was most confident of obtaining the fragment of Solomon’s Sword within Poison City. He had almost no information on the rest. Thus, there was no way he’d leave without getting a good look at this fragment.

At this stage of the game, only he had a Solomon’s Sword fragment. If he didn’t take advantage of his chance to claim the rest before others, obtaining the fragments would be as challenging as finding a needle in a haystack. These fragments didn’t have a mechanism to detect other fragments. Unless the players that obtained a fragment advertised the weapon, he wouldn’t know where to find them.

This was why he was in such a hurry.

Getting his hands on the sword fragments was relatively easy right now, but as players reached higher levels, doing so would become increasingly difficult. This was why Legendary items had been so extraordinarily rare in his past, particularly Legendary Weapons. Collecting the necessary fragments to reproduce the true item was too much of a challenge. A lot of manpower wasn’t enough. One would have to be particularly lucky.

Of course, there was an exception to this rule; players could rely on Ancient Tomes. With these tomes in hand, players could search through God’s Domain’s database for any information they desired. However, Ancient Tomes were almost as rare as Legendary Weapons, and again, one would have to get lucky to find one...

After roughly two hours, the team of Dark Players, the Hell Legion, and Zero Wing’s members reached the plaza. Within its center stood a dried fountain. If one examined the fountain closely, they’d discover a faintly glowing magic array, which suppressed the dull-gray longsword half-buried in the fountain. Even with the magic array’s suppression, the dull sword sapped away any life around it, turning the city into a land of death. It was clear that the sword’s influence would be even more astonishing without the magic array to bind it.

Three NPCs stood around the dull-gray sword in silence, and at the lead was a one-eyed, redheaded man wearing a snowy-white cap.

[Elvoze (Crimson-eyed Sword Saint)] (Human, Sword Saint) Level ? ? ?

HP??????/??????

Crap! A Titled Sword Saint?! Shi Feng felt lightheaded when he saw the one-eyed man.

Tier 5 Titled NPCs were like kings among Tier 5 NPCs. They were responsible for miraculous feats in God’s Domain. In the past, not even a Tier 5 Domain Realm expert would dare offend a Tier 5 Titled NPC. Only Tier 5 Heroes could contend with these individuals, but unlike Heroes, Titled NPCs weren’t powerful due to their extraordinary Basic Attributes, but their superior combat standards and explosive combat power. Because of this, players were more willing to face a Tier 5 Hero than a Tier 5 Titled NPC.

And now, Shi Feng stared at such an individual in Poison City, a Level 120 secret land...

Shi Feng’s teammates gasped when they noticed Elvoze. Even within imperial capitals, they had never seen such an NPC. If they became that man’s enemy, their fates would be sealed, and they might even have to delete their accounts, starting all over.

As Shi Feng hesitated on whether or not he should continue his personal mission for Solomon’s Sword’s fragment, Elvoze turned and looked at the wall his team hid behind.

“You’ve been watching for long enough! Show yourselves!” Elvoze calmly demanded.

The moment the Crimson-eyed Sword Saint spoke, everyone felt an unprecedented pressure bear down on them. Blue Rainbow and Elder Gold struggled against their instincts, which screamed at them to flee.

They could feel just how powerful this NPC was. If they made him unhappy, Elvoze could render all of the progress they’ve made in God’s Domain useless. Such incidents had happened more than once in the Dark World before, and that was precisely why the Otherworld’s Dark Players didn’t dare to offend or casually approach Tier 5 NPCs. In fact, most players actively avoided Tier 4 NPCs.

“Don’t move!” Shi Feng suddenly shouted in the team chat.

“But, Guild Leader Black Flame, that’s a Tier 5 NPC...” Elder Gold said.

They weren’t in an NPC city, and NPCs in the fields were especially unpredictable. The slightest mistake could lead to an unspeakable disaster.

“I know, but he’s already discovered us. He won’t let us get away if we try to run,” Shi Feng said, offering Elder Gold a bitter smile. “Our best option is to do as he says. Never try to provoke a Tier 5 Titled NPC.”

Not a single player in God’s Domain had a better idea of the power a Tier 5 Titled NPC wielded. Once such an NPC discovered them, there was no chance for escape. Not even Tier 5 Domain Realm experts were guaranteed to outrun a Tier 5 Titled NPC.

Moreover, Elvoze’s movement wasn’t restricted as the Demon God’s phantom had been. If this man willed it, Shi Feng would die before he could even activate Space Movement or Spatial Gate. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I understand.”

With the warning ringing in his ears, Elder Gold abandoned any thought of fleeing. As Shi Feng had said, a Tier 5 NPCs Movement Speed wasn’t to be underestimated. Moreover, NPCs gained the ability to fly after reaching Tier 4. How could Tier 3 players like themselves possibly hope to outrun such a being?

Moreover, the Tier 5 Sword Saint would view any attempt to flee as a challenge to his authority. The outcome of committing such an offense would be far graver than approaching the NPC directly.

Under Shi Feng’s lead, the team emerged from the small alley that had provided cover and approached the Crimsoneyed Sword Saint.

“Greetings, Esteemed Sword Saint. We are here to explore this secret land and accidentally discovered this place. Please forgive us for our trespass,” Shi Feng respectfully apologized to Elvoze, who currently sat before the fountain.

“Exploring this secret land?” Elvoze smiled. The NPCs tone then turned chilly as he continued, “You’ve come for this sword, right? Well? Who commands your force?!”

Killing intent!

This was the killing intent of a bona fide Tier 5 Titled NPC!

When Elvoze’s tone had chilled, Shi Feng and all of his team felt the pressure on them increase. They all felt as if lead weights had been tied to their limbs, and everyone struggled to breathe. It felt as if they had plunged into an icy hell.

At the same time, they heard a series of system notifications.

System: Warning! Warning!

System: You have triggered the Epic Event, “Crimson Wrath”!

System: You have 30 seconds to make a decision; kill Elvoze, the Crimson-eyed Sword Saint, or accept the punishment of death.
