Chapter 620 – Zero Wing’s Value

“A deal? With the Blaze Conglomerate?”

Shi Feng couldn’t help but grow curious when he heard Billowing Water’s somewhat urgent tone.

Previously, Billowing Water had only dealt with him in a personal capacity. Yet, she was now proposing a business transaction to him on behalf of the Blaze Conglomerate. So, the significance of the deal was undoubtedly much greater.

“Yes. A deal with the Blaze Conglomerate,” Billowing Water said, smiling slightly when she saw a hint of interest appearing on Shi Feng’s face. “Do you remember the floating island we visited before coming to the Forbidden Zone, Guild Leader Black Flame?”

“I do. We teleported to the Western Continent from that floating island,” Shi Feng said, nodding and feeling a little confused as he looked at Billowing Water.

The Eternal Temple, situated on the floating island, was vital for human players to travel from the Eternal Continent to the Western Continent. However, he failed to see what business they could discuss regarding that floating island.

After all, the island was currently under the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s control, and all of the island’s profits belonged to the Alliance.

“As you can see, there are many benefits to be had on the Western Island.” Taking her time, Billowing Water smiled and explained, “Meanwhile, the number of powers that know about the secrets here is increasing by the day. I believe it won’t be long before many players will know about the Western Continent. And as luck would have it, the Blaze Conglomerate has discovered an island roughly two hours away from the floating island by flight. We have also gone ahead and established a Guild City on the island.”

When Shi Feng heard Billowing Water’s revelation, although he remained calm on the surface, he was inwardly shocked by the news.

In the current Eternal Realm, the various powers had trouble even establishing themselves in the various NPC Cities. As for constructing their own Guild City out in the fields, nobody had managed to do so thus far due to the stringent requirements.

Firstly, to construct a Guild City in the Eternal Realm, a Guild would have to obtain a City Building Order. However, City Building Orders could only be acquired by killing Level 160-plus World Bosses in the Eternal Realm, and such Bosses were extremely rare in the Eternal Realm. And even if players did manage to find and kill a Level 160-plus World Boss, the City Building Order wasn’t guaranteed to drop. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Secondly, a Guild would need to have sufficient funds to construct. This wasn’t just an expense of several thousand Eternal Gold Coins they were talking about. Without at least 100,000 Eternal Gold, a Guild shouldn’t even consider constructing a Guild City in the Eternal Realm. Even for the various pseudo-apex powers, they would need a considerable amount of time to amass such a fortune.

Hence, in the current Eternal Realm, owning a Guild City was a luxury that even the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers could not afford, let alone the Blaze Conglomerate.

“For now, we have already completed the groundwork for the Guild City’s construction. However, with how valuable the city is, even if we expend all of our defensive measures, I’m afraid we won’t be able to defend our ownership,” Billowing Water added with a wry smile.

To this, Shi Feng nodded in agreement.

Currently, the only known way for human players to travel to the Western Continent was through the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Eternal Temple. However, if players wished to enter the floating island, they would have to pay the Seven Luminaries Alliance a fee of 150 Eternal Gold, regardless if they wished to utilize the Eternal Temple’s teleportation services. Because of this, it simply wasn’t possible for players to stay there long-term.

If a Guild City existed near the floating island, it would make it much more convenient for the various powers and players. Such a Guild City could even become a trade hub for the Eternal and Western Continents, and its value would be unimaginable. If any pseudo-apex power were to learn of the Guild City’s existence, they definitely wouldn’t mind snatching it from the Blaze Conglomerate. And with the Blaze Conglomerate’s current strength, there was no way it could defend the city from the various pseudo-apex powers.

“Which is why we have decided to find strong partners,” Billowing Water said as she took on a more serious expression. “We have already come into an agreement with two pseudo-apex powers not long ago. If we include Zero Wing, I believe we should have no problems defending the Guild City.”

Previously, Billowing Water did not have an optimistic view of the Guild named Zero Wing. In her opinion, Black Flame was the only noteworthy individual in the Guild.

But after seeing the seventeen Tier 6 experts on Shi Feng’s team, even if they were only hired hands, the fact that Zero Wing could hire helpers of such caliber was already enough for the Blaze Conglomerate to take Zero Wing seriously. Not to mention, seeing how respectfully Azure Shadow and the others behaved toward Shi Feng, it was obvious the two parties shared a close connection.

“The city in question indeed has unlimited potential. But what kind of price is the Blaze Conglomerate willing to pay?” Shi Feng asked after pondering over the offer.

“If Zero Wing agrees to the partnership…” Billowing Water paused, taking a moment to think. “I can promise you 20% of the city’s profits.”

“Twenty percent?” Shi Feng shook his head. “That is a lot, but it still isn’t enough for Zero Wing. If you want Zero Wing’s help, in addition to the 20%, Zero Wing will require a Guild Residence slot and ten shops located in the city center.”

“This… Isn’t that a little too much?” Billowing Water couldn’t help but hesitate.

The two pseudo-apex powers that had agreed to partner with the Blaze Conglomerate had only asked for 20% of the city’s profits and a few shops in the city center. The Blaze Conglomerate had promised neither of them a Guild Residence slot. After all, a Basic Guild City only had three Guild Residence slots. In such a situation, these precious slots should only be given to integral allies.

“Not at all. Zero Wing’s value far exceeds this price,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. Then, he took out several dozen copies of the Bronze Mana Purification Technique and continued, “I believe you should know the difference between an expert who has learned a Bronze Purification Technique and an expert who hasn’t, right?”

When Billowing Water saw the stack of books Shi Feng took out, her mind froze momentarily.

She naturally knew of the Bronze Mana Purification Technique’s preciousness. Even in the Nameless City, it wasn’t an easy task to acquire a copy. Not to mention, any Tier 5 player who had learned the Bronze Mana Purification Technique would immediately gain Tier 6 combat power.

In other words, what Shi Feng had in his hands was the ability to instantly create several dozen Tier 6 combatants…

“Your conditions have exceeded my jurisdiction.” After hesitating for a moment, Billowing Water said, “I cannot give you an answer right away. I will have to discuss with the conglomerate’s executives first.”

“Sure.” Shi Feng nodded, unsurprised by Billowing Water’s reply.

Billowing Water might be the Blaze Conglomerate’s First Successor, but she still wasn’t the conglomerate’s helmsman. Meanwhile, only the helmsman could approve such an important decision. Successors like Billowing Water could, at most, cast votes on the matter.

Following this, Billowing Water left the core region by herself and hurried over to the teleportation passage located in the city center. She intended to inform Seven Luminaries Town regarding the Holy Race’s plans before logging off to discuss Zero Wing’s partnership conditions with the conglomerate’s executives.

Meanwhile, shortly after Billowing Water left, Zero Wing’s members also finished collecting the items the Holy Race players dropped.

“We’re done collecting the loot, Guild Leader,” Gentle Snow said excitedly as she approached Shi Feng, who had been resting his eyes while in deep thought. “These Holy Race players are incredibly wealthy. It’s especially so for their commander. He’s practically a walking treasure trove!”

After saying so, Gentle Snow took out a bunch of items, the appearance of the items immediately causing the Eternal Energy in a several hundred-yard radius to double in density.
