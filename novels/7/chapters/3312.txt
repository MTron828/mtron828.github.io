Chapter 387 – Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor

“Is Paimon crazy? It’s letting a mere core paragon use a suit of Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor?” Apart from Shi Feng, Laura similarly revealed a surprised look when she saw the light-purple metal piece. “Even apex powers would only be willing to let core paragons with great contributions use their Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor. Could Paimon be overflowing with Sacred Armor of this caliber?”

Sacred Armor was different from the average equipment. They usually came in complete sets and did not have any Attribute or Tier requirements. Players could equip Sacred Armor so long as their control over mana was sufficiently high.

Meanwhile, so long as players could don a suit of Sacred Armor, they would see a significant improvement in their control over mana.

In the Greater God’s Domain, a suit of Epic-ranked Sacred Armor could sell for a whopping 100,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, whereas a suit of Fragmented Legendary-ranked Sacred Armor couldn’t even be found on the market. Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor was so rare and precious that players and powers who owned a suit wouldn’t even be willing to trade it for several pieces of Legendary Equipment.

!!

After all, Sacred Armor were items passed down from the Greater God’s Domain’s ancient era, and there was no way to reproduce them in the modern era. Hence, every suit used was one less suit available in the Greater God’s Domain.

It was also highly unlikely a used suit of Sacred Armor would be handed over to another player, especially not a Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor. This was because Sacred Armor could grow with their wearers.

Apart from providing more Basic Attributes, a suit of Sacred Armor would also provide an increasingly greater improvement to mana control as their wearer leveled up. On top of that, not only would the suit of Sacred Armor eventually become fully compatible with its wearer, but it could also grow in rank. In the case of Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor, it could ultimately grow into a Legendary Equipment Set, which was why nobody would be willing to exchange a suit of Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor for even several pieces of Legendary Equipment.

However, before a suit of Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor became a player’s personalized equipment set, it would have an extremely high chance of dropping on death. Hence, any power that owned such Sacred Armor would be incredibly careful when handing them out to their paragons. After all, this was a potential Legendary Equipment Set they were talking about. Not even apex powers would dare to fool around with such a precious treasure.

Yet, now, the Paimon Conglomerate had given a suit of Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor to Storm, someone who wasn’t even among the conglomerate’s Ten Great Paragons. If the Paimon Conglomerate could afford to be so generous with its Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor, it wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to call it the Starlight Realm’s number one conglomerate.

“No, this thing looks like it’s broken,” Shi Feng said, wryly smiling after he finished inspecting the worn-out divine runes engraved on the light-purple metal piece. “This thing might be a suit of Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor, but with its runes damaged, not only will it have a significantly higher equipment requirement, but its strength will also only be slightly stronger than Epic Sacred Armor when equipped. Moreover, it can’t grow along with its wearer. At best, this thing is worth 60 to 70 thousand units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.”

Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor might be priceless, but it was a different story for a damaged suit. In the case of a damaged suit, it wouldn’t even be worth as much as Epic Sacred Armor. After all, an intact suit of Epic Sacred Armor could still grow into a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set. At that time, it would be vastly stronger than a half-baked Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor.

“What a pity,” Laura said as she looked at the metal piece in Shi Feng’s hand. “There are no known methods of repairing Sacred Armor in the current Greater God’s Domain. Otherwise, even while damaged, this thing would be worth more than a six-piece Legendary Equipment Set.”

An intact suit of Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor could ultimately transform into a six-piece Legendary Equipment Set that was perfectly compatible with its wearer. Unlike other six-piece Legendary Equipment Sets, it could let players unleash their potential to the greatest extent.

“Indeed…” Shi Feng nodded but chose not to say anything more. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There might not be any known methods to repair Sacred Armor in the current Greater God’s Domain, but Shi Feng knew of a place that might have a way to do so—the Greater God’s Domain’s Three Great Workshops.

The Three Great Workshops predated even the Greater God’s Domain’s recorded history. So, it wasn’t out of the question for them to hold a means to repair Sacred Armor. After all, if these Workshops could manufacture even Epic Combat Puppets, it shouldn’t be too difficult for them to repair Sacred Armor.

Subsequently, Shi Feng put away the damaged Fragmented Legendary Sacred Armor and began searching for the Void Gods’ sealing grounds.

After following the flow of mana in the floating island’s magic barrier for half a day, Shi Feng finally discovered a cave that was sealed by a separate magic barrier. Moreover, apart from the barrier, the cave was also guarded by several Level 150, Tier 5 Legendary monsters.

“Is it here?”

Shi Feng couldn’t help but be flabbergasted when he looked at the five Soul Devourers resting in front of the cave entrance.

…

[Soul Devourer] (Ancient Magic Creature, Legendary)

Level 150

HP 600,000,000,000

…

Soul Devourers were incredibly troublesome monsters that could devour the Immortal Souls of players. If a Tier 4 player had their souls devoured by a Soul Devourer, they could basically say goodbye to God’s Domain forever.

As for Tier 5 players, if they got killed by a Soul Devourer, they’d have to be separated from God’s Domain for at least 10 to 15 days.

Hence, the existence of Soul Devourers was considered taboo in God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, if players wished to raid a Tier 5 Soul Devourer, they would need a team of 100 Tier 5 players of the same level at the very least. Moreover, that was if they were going up against only one Tier 5 Soul Devourer.

Currently, however, there were five Tier 5 Soul Devourers resting outside the cave. Moreover, the magic barrier protecting the cave was bound to these five Soul Devourers. In other words, unless these five Soul Devourers were eliminated, the magic barrier would remain standing…

Fortunately, the situation wasn’t completely hopeless, not for Shi Feng, at least.

After analyzing the structure of the cave’s magic barrier with his expertise as a Great Grandmaster Magician, Shi Feng easily snuck through the magic barrier without giving the five Soul Devourers any chance to attack him. Then, he quickly made his way into the cave.

Once inside the cave, Shi Feng found that the deeper he traveled into the cave, the denser the Eternal Energy around him became.

After walking for some time, Shi Feng eventually arrived at an altar the size of several football fields. Meanwhile, the Eternal Energy around this altar was as dense as the Eternal Energy found on the Hundred Refinement Building’s second floor.

Before Shi Feng could get close to the altar, he was frozen in place by a Divine Might originating from the altar. More specifically, the Divine Might came from a carbonized black sword suspended above the altar.

With great struggle, Shi Feng raised his head to look at the carbonized sword suspended in the air. Then, when he got a clear look at the sword, goosebumps rose all over his body.

Why is the Shadow Incinerator here?
