Chapter 66 – One Reason

“You formed a Guild, Brother Feng?” Blackie was momentarily stunned when he heard Shi Feng’s words. Then, immediately afterward, he revealed an excited look as he said, “That’s great! We’ll join! We’ll definitely join you! Our initial plan was to contact you about joining the Guild Qianliu is forming, anyway! With this, we can start something big in the Miniature Ancient World!”

“Su Qianliu is also forming a Guild?”

Old memories started surfacing in Shi Feng’s mind when he heard this name.

Ice Queen Su Qianliu. She was one of Shadow’s Five Demon Generals, and she was also one of the Guild’s few rare beauties. Lan Hailong’s cousin brother had fervently tried to pursue Su Qianliu initially, and Lan Hailong had also put a lot of pressure onto her to coerce her into entering a relationship with his cousin. Eventually, Su Qianliu got fed up with the harassment, choosing to delete her account and leave Shadow. At the time, many of Shadow’s outer members were Su Qianliu’s fans. So, upon learning of her departure, these players also left Shadow and formed an adventurer team with Su Qianliu.

When Su Qianliu left, Shi Feng would often have Blackie secretly siphon some of Shadow’s resources to help Su Qianliu’s adventurer team. As a result, Su Qianliu’s adventurer team quickly made a name for themselves in the Black Dragon Empire and received many recruitment offers from large Guilds. However, as far as Shi Feng recalled, Su Qianliu never agreed to merge her adventurer team with any Guild.

“Qianliu does have such intentions,” Blackie answered. “Now that the Miniature Ancient World has just opened, she thinks it’s a good opportunity to set up a new Guild. She has long since started preparing for this, and she has even found several investors. I heard the total investment capital she got is quite significant. Now, all that’s left is to form a Guild in the Miniature Ancient World and decide which NPC City to develop in. When Qianliu learned that we had left Shadow, she contacted us and asked us about joining her. She even said that it’d be best if I could get you to join her as well. Now that everyone’s in agreement, we can start a conquest in the Miniature Ancient World together.”

“She’s already found investors?”

A slight frown formed on Shi Feng’s face.

“Mhm. These investors are betting a lot on the Miniature Ancient World. Each of them has promised at least several hundred million to Qianliu. We can even set up our headquarters in Jin Hai City’s city center with that kind of money. Moreover, with this capital, not only can we start Guild operations immediately, but we can also recruit a bunch of independent experts. I believe it won’t take more than two months before we can establish a foothold in the Miniature Ancient World,” Blackie said in a passionate tone.

Seeing that Blackie was about to continue speaking, Shi Feng quickly interrupted him and said, “I don’t intend on taking any investments for the Guild formed, Blackie.”

“No investments?” Blackie couldn’t help but take a second look at Shi Feng when he heard Shi Feng’s words. “Brother Feng, things are no longer the same as when God’s Domain first launched. Back then, everyone only treated God’s Domain as another game, but God’s Domain has already become an integral part of real life. Even if the Miniature Ancient World’s launch is a good opportunity to establish a Guild, you should know that establishing a Guild costs a lot of money. If we don’t offer enough benefits, there’s no way we can attract any players to join. Not to mention, before the Guild starts making a profit, the Guild still needs to feed a bunch of people…”

“I understand.” Shi Feng nodded. Then, he smiled and said, “But I will think of a solution for these problems. So, are you still willing to join my Guild after learning about my decision?”

Shi Feng naturally knew about the various problems one would meet when establishing a Guild in God’s Domain, which was why he chose to establish the Candlelight Hotel first. After all, maintaining a Guild wasn’t an easy task. It was especially true when the Guild still lacked their own territory and Guild Town. He couldn’t possibly ask the Guild’s members to work for free. People still needed to live.

“What is the Guild’s name?” Blackie curiously asked instead of answering.

“Zero Wing! It is currently a small Guild with only a few members,” Shi Feng said.

“Zero Wing?” Nodding, Blackie said, “Good name! I’ll contact the others right away and meet up with you in the game.”

“Sure. Come over to Hundred Flow City, and I’ll take you guys out to level,” Shi Feng said, smiling.

“It’s a deal,” Blackie said with a helpless smile. “But I’ll also have to go talk to Qianliu about this. She came to us with sincerity, after all.”

“Do you have a way to get her to join us?” Shi Feng asked. “If she joins us, it’ll boost our Guild’s management and overall strength significantly.”

Su Qianliu used to be one of Shadow’s Five Demon Generals, so her combat standards and talent naturally went without saying. She only failed to realize her true potential because she failed to get sufficient resources during her time with Shadow.

During Shi Feng’s previous life, Su Qianliu had been a bona fide Tier 5 apex expert in Zero Wing. If he could get Su Qianliu to join Zero Wing again, it would undoubtedly help him a lot.

“This… I’m afraid it’ll be difficult,” Blackie said, shaking his head. “You should know that she has her own team now, Brother Feng. She needs to be responsible for those people. Moreover, it had taken her great pains to persuade those investors. Getting her to abandon those investors to join us will be very tough. Unless we can provide her with a convincing enough reason, there is absolutely no way she will take the risk.”

“A convincing reason?” After thinking for a moment, Shi Feng smiled and said, “Sure. Give her a call, and I’ll give her a convincing reason!”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
