Chapter 104 - An Unknown Way of Battle

Everyone stood silently within the bright mausoleum hall, turning the place eerily quiet.

After some time had passed...

“Brother Feng, what do we do now? This Boss is just too terrifying. It is impossible for us to kill it,” Blackie looked towards Shi Feng, asking.

On the other side, Zhao Yueru said helplessly, “Snow, it seems we won’t be able to clear the Dungeon after all.”

The other team members also indicated their agreement. There could be no greater folly than to attempt something they already knew to be impossible.

“Are we just going to give up like this?” Gentle Snow’s slender eyelashes trembled slightly, her crystal-clear eyes shifting towards the Kobold King’s figure once more. They had reached this point after much difficulty. Were they just going to give up like this?

[Kobold King Patch Leo] (Lord Rank)

Level 6

HP 120,000/120,000

Not mentioning its frightening amount of HP, just the mere words, “Lord Rank” were enough to cause players to tremble. That meant that there was a single aspect to this monster that was extremely terrifying; either in terms of speed, strength, or magic. Based solely on the terrifying aura radiating off of the Kobold King’s body, its bulging, iron-like muscles, the pitch-black greatsword as tall as a man, which pierced deeply into the ground... Even without having any exchanges with this Kobold King everyone knew there was no way to overpower it. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Why don’t we give it a try first? Ghost Chop, try out the Boss’ capabilities. The others will leave the hall first,” Gentle Snow said after giving it some thought.

Gentle Snow still intended to give the Boss a try. She was hoping to look for a strategy to kill it.

“Let’s leave first then,” Shi Feng said as well.

Gentle Snow’s thoughts were exactly the same as his. He would let the MT try out the Boss, then let the team watch. That way, he would have an appropriate excuse when he revealed his strategy.

Following this the Shield Warrior, Ghost Chop, activated his video recording, charging towards the Kobold King alone.

Meanwhile, the thick and heavy stone doors leading into the hall started closing.

Just as Ghost Chop was midway through his Charge, the Kobold King abruptly opened its eyes. Kachak. The Kobold King casually pulled out the pitch-black sword from the ground; its robust legs abruptly exploded with power as it similarly charged at Ghost Chop.

Like a fierce gale, the Kobold King swept towards Ghost Chop.

Ghost Chop’s body was frightened stiff. He rapidly reacted by raising his shield, blocking it in front of his chest.

In the blink of an eye, a black ray, which carried with it an explosive sound, struck on the shield.

Hong!

Ghost Chop’s entire person was sent flying, and a damage of 633 points appeared above his head. His entire arm felt numb from the attack. If he had not used his shield to block, he might have been killed instantly.

Ghost Chop felt that his own techniques were quite good, and he was an elite member of Ouroboros. Moreover, his task right now wasn’t even to kill off the Boss. If he could not even force the Boss to reveal its hidden cards, then he would be an absolute disgrace.

Ghost Chop abruptly stood up. He poured a bottle of Basic Regeneration Potion down his throat, his HP recovering to more than half of its total. Just as he was considering attempting another bout with the Boss, he suddenly discovered that the Boss was already standing behind him, its greatsword raised up high. Abruptly, the Kobold King slashed the greatsword at Ghost Chop.

Shield Wall!

Ghost Chop no longer had the option to dodge the attack. He could only use his lifesaving skill to take the attack at full force.

When used, Shield Wall would reduce the damage the user received by half for a duration of 12 seconds.

The black runic greatsword struck down once more. Although Ghost Chop had used his shield to block the attack again, he was instantly forced into a kneeling position by the resulting pressure. The stone bricks beneath his feet cracked apart like a spider’s web, and his HP instantly fell by 426 points, leaving him with only a thread of life remaining.

The Kobold King then kicked towards the side of Ghost Chop’s abdomen. Ghost Chop helplessly imprinted himself onto a wall, and his HP instantly dropped down to zero.

Only three seconds had passed since the start of the battle. Just like that, an MT that was equipped with top-tier equipment was dead.

So much so that, even before the stone doors had closed shut, they had opened once more.

Everyone looked at Ghost Chop, who was planted into a wall, shocked.

What was this situation?

The door had just closed before opening again, and their MT was already dead...

“Yue’er, revive Ghost Chop,” Gentle Snow said with a gloomy expression.

Ghost Chop being killed so quickly was a clear indicator of how strong this Boss was.

After Ghost Chop was revived, a somber expression hung on his face. He unwillingly shared with everyone the recording he made, allowing them all to analyze the Boss’ strength.

“Strong!” Zhao Yueru could not help but say in shock, “This general speed and reaction speed, this strength, and also the constantly varying attack patterns... Is this really an NPC? Are we sure this isn’t a martial arts expert in disguise?”

Before even witnessing the Boss in battle, everyone could already feel how powerful it was. Now that they witnessed this for themselves, aside from feeling shocked, they were also astounded. With Ghost Chop’s skills, he was actually unable to even damage the Boss. This was just too horrifying.

Even if it was the strongest Chieftain Rank monster Gentle Snow met before, in comparison to this Kobold King, it would only be a little rabbit.

As for Shi Feng’s party, whom had battled with a Lord Rank Boss before, after looking at the recording, even they were feeling apprehensive.

As expected of a Lord Rank Boss in a Team Dungeon, compared to the Lord Rank Boss of a Party Dungeon, it was at least several times stronger. Not only was its speed and strength a problem, but its attack patterns were even more so. There were just too many variations. It was as if they were fighting in a close-quartered combat against an expert. Moreover, the physical attributes of this expert were better than theirs by several fold. Just how were they supposed to continue battling against this Boss?

Even if their Brother Feng was very powerful, he might not be able to last long against this Boss. After all, this Boss had a HP of 120,000 and their HP did not even reach 1,000.

“Let’s withdraw.” After considering for a good while and thinking up of all sorts of simulations, Gentle Snow still came to the conclusion that they would be team-wiped. She was not prepared to waste time here, and rather prepared to raid the Normal Mode of the Dark Moon Graveyard. The Boss in the Normal Mode should be a Chieftain Rank Boss, which should be much weaker. According to their current equipment, they would at least have a twenty to thirty percent chance of killing the Boss.

Everyone else could only give up after hearing Gentle Snow say this, so all of them took out Return Scrolls.

At this moment, Shi Feng suddenly said in the team chat, “After looking at the Kobold King’s attack patterns, if Miss Snow, the two MTs, and myself were to implement a rotation battle, we should have somewhat of a chance at succeeding. I wonder if Miss Snow still wishes to raid this Boss?”

Although Shi Feng’s voice was soft, it was as if a light in the darkness appeared, brightening everyone’s spirits.

“Brother Feng, are we really going to fight it?” Blackie looked at the Kobold King, swallowing down a mouthful of saliva. Even at such a distance away from it, Blackie could still feel his legs trembling. If he were to close in on it a little more, he might already be on the ground, kneeling.

In fact, it wasn’t just Blackie who was impacted by the Kobold King’s imposing aura. The other team members did not fare any better than Blackie. They instinctively acknowledged that they could not beat it, wanting to run away from it.

“You have a plan?” Shock flashed past Zhao Yueru’s eyes as she looked at Shi Feng, asking.

This was a Lord inside a Team Dungeon. Its HP was several times higher than the Lords in the wild. Its Attack Power and attack patterns, as well, were despairingly powerful. Zhao Yueru did not think that Shi Feng would have a method to raid it.

Shi Feng shrugged his shoulders, looking at the Kobold King as he said, “My confidence at succeeding isn’t high. However, we can still give it a try. Isn’t it just a 10% experience loss? Killing all the way here, the experience we obtained has far exceeded just 10%. Even if we died, we have already obtained a lot of equipment. Don’t tell me that you guys are so willing to just give up?”

Gentle Snow was slightly shocked. She did not think that Shi Feng could bring her so many surprises. Even if they could not raid the Boss this time, she would definitely pull Shi Feng into Ouroboros.

“What are the chances for success?” Gentle Snow asked, her iceberg-like expression finally revealing a warm smile.

“Twenty percent.” Shi Feng had already made the most conservative estimation. In reality, he had estimated their success rate to be at fifty percent. However, he was worried that if he were to say it out loud it would be bad; he might attract suspicion.

“What? You said twenty percent?!” Zhao Yueru rolled her eyes at Shi Feng. With such a low success rate, who would dare take the challenge?

“Alright, let’s hear your plan then. We will be supporting you fully,” Gentle Snow interrupted Zhao Yueru, saying softly.

Gentle Snow herself had estimated their chances at getting rid of the Lord Rank Boss at zero percent. As for a Chieftain Rank Boss, she had estimated the success rate to be at twenty to thirty percent chance. Judging from Shi Feng’s previous behavior, he did not seem like a person that exaggerated things. Since Shi Feng had a similar certainty for success, wouldn’t killing the Lord Rank Boss be much better?

Moreover, she was extremely interested in the four-man rotation battle Shi Feng had mentioned. She did not know what kind of method of battle this was to actually let them have such a high chance of success against the Lord Rank Kobold King.
