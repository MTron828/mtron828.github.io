Chapter 231 - Legendary Genius

Blackie and the others had been trapped in the Trial of God for several days now. If they remained inside, Shi Feng didn’t know when he could go to the Demon’s castle to obtain the Demon’s Heart.

Hence, Shi Feng needed to know their current progress. If they were truly unable to leave the trial anytime soon, his only option was to seek Gentle Snow’s help.

However, he did not want Gentle Snow to know too much about him. Unless it was a desperate situation, he would not turn to Gentle Snow for help.

“Right! I totally forgot to tell you since I was so excited about the Workshop!” Blackie lightly tapped his own head. The matter of the Workshop was simply too shocking. He continued, “Brother Feng, just where did you find such an expert little sister? She is just too awesome! Originally, we nearly despaired from the difficulty of the trial. However, thanks to her, we all made it through the trial with great ease! Right now, we’re about to head to the highest floor to receive our reward.”

“An expert? Little sister? Are you talking about Fire Dance? Haven’t you already seen how amazing she is?” Shi Feng curiously asked.

“No, it’s not Fire Dance, but Violet! We managed to clear the trial only thanks to her! But really, she is simply too strong!” Blackie lamented, “At the beginning of the trial, Little Sister Violet had only healed us from behind. As we progressed, her healing grew better and better, and she was able to grasp the timing of her heals perfectly! However, the monsters in the trial also grew stronger. After some time, we were barely surviving, even with Little Sister Violet’s excellent healing. It was then that she took action. Although her combat standards, in the beginning, were very crude, as the battles continued, one after another, her combat standards increased endlessly. Within just a day, she had already surpassed Fire Dance!

“I even felt that the Trial of God was created specifically for Little Sister Violet. Inside the Trial of God, for every trial we cleared, we would be given an evaluation and an appropriate reward. Meanwhile, ever since Little Sister Violet took action, she always obtained an evaluation of Rank A or above. Her Equipment and Skills continuously upgraded, and regarding damage output, even though I had the Mavis’s Guard, I only won against her by a small margin. If Little Sister Violet also had an Epic ranked staff, she would have long since left me in the dust!

“Little Sister Violet is the most talented person I have ever met in God’s Domain. Brother Feng, if you saw her frightening growth rate, you, too, would be shocked!”

After having mentioned Violet Cloud, Blackie could not stop his mouth as he talked on and on about her. Blackie spoke as if Violet Cloud were the strongest expert in God’s Domain, and nobody was above her.

Of course, Blackie was speaking about Violet Cloud’s innate talent, and not her current strength. After all, Violet Cloud’s rate of improvement was simply horrifying. With such an improvement rate, she would sooner or later become the strongest player in God’s Domain.

“It’s good that you guys passed the trial. However, you shouldn’t just pay attention to Violet. Don’t forget that you are a Cursemancer, while she is a Cleric. You also hold an Epic ranked staff in your hands. If your damage really does lose to hers, then you’re going to have to hand over the Mavis’s Guard to Violet!” Shi Feng joked. However, he was truly relieved.

It was no wonder Violet Cloud had managed to become a Cleric God in the past. Her innate talent was not a sham.

However, maybe because Violet Cloud had played a Cleric in the past, she had never revealed her true potential during the early stages of the game. However, after leaving Ouroboros, Violet Cloud could no longer depend on her healing to play God’s Domain as she only had herself to rely on in battles. Hence, she started to display her frightening talent.

Similar to the current situation in the Trial of God, healing alone was not enough. Hence, Violet Cloud had no choice but to engage in battle as well, inadvertently revealing her explosive talent.

“Maybe she is one of the legendary geniuses,” Shi Feng sighed. In the past, although his techniques were good, when compared to Violet Cloud, the difference between them was like heaven and earth. It was no wonder Violet Cloud had become a Cleric God. However, Shi Feng would no longer waste his time in this life. He would not ignore training his body.

Currently, the Workshop could accommodate up to several hundred people. Moreover, there were also private rooms meant for upper management. Furniture of superior quality decorated these private rooms, and just the cost of a single set would have left Shi Feng’s past self in awe. Aside from the private rooms, Shi Feng had also set up a workout room that allowed one to carry out some simple exercises.

God’s Domain was not just any random game where players could become a tyrant by pulling a few all-nighters. If one wanted to campaign in God’s Domain, they needed to prepare for a long and arduous war. Hence, players in God’s Domain needed to balance both work and rest, and most importantly, train their bodies if they wanted to succeed.

“Brother Feng, the university’s Fellowship Party is the day after tomorrow. Should we buy a luxury car and drive there? At that time, I want to see just who would dare look down on our Zero Wing Workshop!” Blackie said excitedly.

“I’ll pass on the luxury car. I cannot afford such a thing right now.” Shi Feng shook his head as he laughed.

Although Shi Feng had similarly thought of buying a luxury car to keep up appearances, he was currently tight on money. He still owed a large sum of Credits. It would be better to take a more pragmatic approach.

Following which, Shi Feng and Blackie spent the entire day putting up the finishing touches to the Workshop. The remaining problem they faced was the lack of members. They needed to recruit a large number of new members with potential.

When night arrived in the real world, Shi Feng entered God’s Domain once more.

Shortly after leaving the Forging Room, a low ring sounded by Shi Feng’s ears. It was the alert tone that signified the arrival of a system message.

However, the alert did not end at just that once. The ringing persisted for a long time and only stopped after over ten minutes had passed.

With a headache, Shi Feng called up the message interface. Immediately, several thousand messages appeared on his display, and all of these messages had been sent to his alternate ID, Black Flame. Shi Feng then took a look at these messages. All of them were from people attempting to purchase the Basic Mana Armor Kits. Moreover, aside from the players in White River City, even the Guilds from other cities were trying to contact him. However, Shi Feng simply revealed a smile at these messages, as he had already achieved his goal.

Fame. Not Starstreak’s fame, but Black Flame’s. Moreover, as long as he had the Basic Mana Armor Kit, Starstreak Trading Firm’s business would not sour. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

According to Anna’s latest report, the Starstreak Trading Firm had earned over 900 Gold per day. However, this was only the beginning. As they increased the number of Forgers and Potionmakers under their command, their daily production rate would also increase. As a result, the money they earned would similarly increase. It was only a matter of time before they managed to earn 30,000 Gold.

However, there was still a far more important matter that Shi Feng needed to deal with right now.

Hence, Shi Feng immediately contacted Gentle Snow.

“Miss Snow, can I ask you for some help? I wish to buy a few Advanced Whetstone Recipes from you,” Shi Feng asked.

“The drop rate for the Advanced Whetstone Recipe is extremely low, and even Ouroboros has only managed to procure several copies. Since we are old acquaintances, I can sell a few to you. However, I want to conduct the trade using Basic Mana Armor Kits.” Gentle Snow revealed a smile. She rejoiced at the fact that Black Flame came to her for help. If so, she could just directly request to exchange for the Basic Mana Armor Kits.

Ever since the Basic Mana Armor Kits were revealed to the public, she immediately had her subordinates conduct an investigation on the item. However, they promptly discovered something unusual; it did not drop from anywhere at all. It seemed to be a Special Forging Design obtained through a quest, so there was no way for others to obtain it at all. Hence, if they wanted to obtain any Mana Armor Kits, they could only obtain them from Black Flame himself.

“Alright, but I wonder how Miss Snow plans to exchange?”

“One Advanced Whetstone Recipe for 20 Mana Armor Kits. I can trade three copies with you.”

“Deal. You can send one of your subordinates to conduct the trade at the Starstreak Trading Firm.”

Shi Feng did not hesitate to accept Gentle Snow’s high price. After they agreed upon the transaction, Shi Feng disconnected the call. He then took the Mana Armor Kits he had just finished producing to the Starstreak Trading Firm.

Shi Feng intended for Cream Cocoa and Melancholic Smile to learn these Advanced Whetstone Recipes. After all, he still had many matters of his own that he needed to deal with; he couldn’t just forge items all day. In the future, the Horizon Alliance’s main strength would still have to depend on them. Thus, he purchased those recipes.

“Brother Feng, we’re out of the trials. When do we head to the Demon’s Castle?”

Shortly after Shi Feng had finished dealing with his own matters, Blackie’s message arrived.
