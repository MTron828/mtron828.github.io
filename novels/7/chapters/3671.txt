Crystal City of Secrets, Airport:

Many flying ships from the various NPC Cities and Fortresses could be seen waiting to dock at the Crystal City’s airport. The airport’s five-story waiting hall was also crowded with players waiting to travel to the Eternal Realm’s high-level maps.

“Isn’t this airport a little too crowded?” a petite Level 173 female Berserker clad in silver armor bearing Scarecrow Fox’s mark remarked as she looked at the long line snaking through the waiting hall. “I wonder when our adventurer team will be able to have our own flying ship like the other powers. If we had our own flying ship, we wouldn’t have to waste so much time waiting in line.”

“That’s not going to happen anytime soon, Little Garment,” River Light, a Level 180, Tier 6 Cleric, remarked with a wry smile as he gazed at the petite female Berserker. “While flying ships might be commonplace in the Greater God’s Domain, only pseudo-apex powers and above possess them in the Eternal Realm. Even conglomerates and upper-ranking hegemonic powers don’t stand a chance of owning one. Fortunately, our adventurer team secured a Medium Private House in the Crystal City long ago. Otherwise, with the current influx of players, we might struggle to even enter the city, let alone board a flying ship.”

The petite female Berserker was named Mirror Garment, and she was currently receiving training from Scarecrow Fox. She was the successor of one of the conglomerates backing Scarecrow Fox, and the adventurer team would usually go all-out to help her grow.

However, the problem was that the current Eternal Realm was a gathering place of the mighty, and Scarecrow Fox’s status here could only be considered average. Because of this, the influence it could exert and the resources it could access were limited. It could not easily access an entire Realm’s resources like it could outside the Eternal Realm.

“I understand.” Mirror Garment nodded. When she looked at the various conglomerates and upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ peerless geniuses who were in the waiting hall, a hint of fighting spirit appeared in her eyes.

It hadn’t been easy for her to enter the Eternal Realm. Despite her status, she had to undergo fierce competition to earn a spot. Although Scarecrow Fox was a behemoth in the Realm she hailed from, she recognized that the Eternal Realm was a haven for the exceptionally powerful. This notion was readily apparent from the state of the Crystal City’s airport.

Throughout the waiting area, peerless geniuses could be spotted. In their respective Realms, these individuals would be regarded as renowned figures. However, within the Crystal City of Secrets, these peerless geniuses were merely insignificant figures.

“If we can acquire more Combat Secret Treasures or a couple of Extraordinary Secret Treasures from the World Ark this time, having a flying ship sent over from the Greater God’s Domain wouldn’t be out of the question,” Ink Qilin said, smiling when she saw the fighting spirit on Mirror Garment’s face. “Also, if you’re lucky, you might even get to register at one of the inner area’s resurrection camps on this trip.”

“The inner area? Are you for real, Big Sis Qilin?” Mirror Garment asked as she looked at Ink Qilin with fiery eyes.

Although she had only recently arrived at the Eternal Realm, she had overheard many players discussing the World Ark while exploring the Underground Crystal Palace and Crystal City of Secrets. The World Ark was currently a place of contention for many powers, and its inner area was so dangerous that even members of pseudo-apex powers were at high risk of death.

Because of this, it became mandatory for players to register themselves at an inner area resurrection camp if they wanted to explore the World Ark’s inner area effectively. The only problem was that this privilege was not easily obtained. Even the members of the various pseudo-apex powers had difficulty securing a spot.

If she could register at a resurrection camp in the inner area, she could explore the inner area more efficiently and find more opportunities for growth.

“Naturally,” Ink Qilin said, chuckling. “Scarecrow Fox might be insignificant in the Crystal City, but we have a good relationship with Zero Wing. Acquiring a registration slot shouldn’t be too difficult.”

“Zero Wing?”

Mirror Garment was unfamiliar with the name Ink Qilin mentioned. Even after searching through all the information she had of pseudo-apex powers in her mind, she could not remember ever hearing this name before.

However, Mirror Garment was no fool. Based on Ink Qilin’s prideful tone when she spoke of Scarecrow Fox’s relationship with Zero Wing, she could tell that Zero Wing was no ordinary power.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As Ink Qilin was about to provide Mirror Garment a detailed explanation, a nearby team overheard their conversation, and a Level 181, Tier 6 Swordsman from the team suddenly approached them. The Swordsman in question was a middle-aged man clad in armor adorned with a sword emblem, and trailing behind him was a young man who was also a Tier 6 Swordsman.

The Blademaster Society! Mirror Garment gasped when she saw the approaching middle-aged Swordsman.

The Blademaster Society was an adventurer team renowned in the Greater God’s Domain, its reputation surpassing even Scarecrow Fox. The Society’s two commanders, both bearing the title of Blademaster, were particularly celebrated for their strength, being only marginally weaker than Scarecrow Fox’s legendary Great Commander.

“Greetings, Vice Commander Qilin. I am Ocean Watcher, a vice commander of the Blademaster Society,” the middle-aged Swordsman introduced himself respectfully. “I couldn’t help but overhear you mentioning your relationship with Zero Wing, Vice Commander Qilin. If it is not too much to ask, can I trouble you for an introduction? Just a chance to meet with Zero Wing will do. You don’t have to say anything on the Blademaster Society’s behalf. Regardless of success or failure, we will offer this Extraordinary Secret Treasure for your troubles.”

Ocean Watcher? The Ocean Slicing Sword God? Mirror Garment gaped in shock when she heard the middle-aged Swordsman’s introduction.

The Ocean Slicing Sword God was well-known across the Greater God’s Domain. He was an expert ranked among the Divine Glory List’s top 100, and even pseudo-apex powers had to treat him with a certain degree of respect. Yet, after hearing that Scarecrow Fox shared a good relationship with Zero Wing, Ocean Watcher was willing to humble himself before Ink Qilin, even going as far as to offer an incomparably precious Extraordinary Secret Treasure just to get a recommendation from Ink Qilin.

This situation piqued Mirror Garment’s curiosity toward the Guild known as Zero Wing. Just what kind of power could compel a top 100 Divine Glory expert to exhibit such caution and deference?

“I cannot promise you a meeting,” Ink Qilin answered after pondering the matter. “It all depends on Guild Leader Black Flame’s willingness.”

“That is only natural.” When Ocean Watcher didn’t hear an outright refusal from Ink Qilin, a hint of excitement appeared on his face. His reaction also caused the young Tier 6 Swordsman beside him to scrutinize Mirror Garment seriously, treating her like a powerful rival.

Seeing this, Mirror Garment couldn’t help but be filled with disbelief.

…

While the interaction between Scarecrow Fox and the Blademaster Society was taking place, over at the Soul Lake Resurrection Camp…

“We’ve finished cleaning up the battlefield, Guild Leader,” Gentle Snow said as she entered the Advanced Tent occupied by Zero Wing’s executives, who were in the middle of sorting through the loot acquired from the Sun Dynasty’s three subordinate Guilds. Then, she handed Shi Feng a list and excitedly reported, “Not only did we not incur any losses in this battle, but we even made a fortune. In addition, as soon as the battle concluded, many powers contacted us asking to buy long-term registration slots.”
