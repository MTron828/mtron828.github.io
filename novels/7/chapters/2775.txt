Chapter 2776 – Duel Between Sword and Shield

“Survive a hit from you?”

Lionheart was momentarily stunned by Shi Feng’s words.

Even Wind Chaser and Crimson Billow fell into a daze for a long time. They felt that Shi Feng was simply toying with the Skyflare adventurer team.

Looking at Shi Feng, Wind Chaser asked to verify, “Are you sure this is your condition? Do you know what title our commander holds in Meteorite City?”

Initially, Wind Chaser thought that Shi Feng would make things difficult for them to invalidate this transaction. Yet, Shi Feng’s condition for partnership was simply for Lionheart to survive a hit from him.

This test was beyond simple.

Let alone Tier 4 players, even Superior Mythic monsters were incapable of one-shotting Lionheart. The Skyflare adventurer team had relied precisely on Lionheart’s overwhelming Defense to develop to its current extent.

It would be a complete and utter joke to say that a Tier 4 player could one-shot Lionheart.

For a moment, Wind Chaser even suspected that Shi Feng had never bothered looking into Lionheart’s information. Either that or the man thought that Lionheart’s fame was exaggerated.

“Of course. I’m very certain.” Shi Feng nodded earnestly. Yu Luo also couldn’t help looking at Shi Feng strangely. She simply couldn’t understand why Shi Feng would set such a meaningless condition.

She knew that Shi Feng was indeed very strong. This was evident from how he repelled over a dozen Tier 3 Demon Leaders with one move. However, Lionheart wasn’t a pushover, either. The achievements he had today were piled up through innumerable battles.

Wind Chaser and Crimson Billow turned to Lionheart. Although they didn’t know what Lionheart thought of this matter, Shi Feng’s test presented no problem to them. It wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to call it a free pass.

Meanwhile, so long as their two sides entered into a partnership, the Skyflare adventurer team would be able to gain full control over Meteorite City easily. In fact, it wouldn’t be long before they could start establishing branches in other NPC Main Cities.

And even if the player forces of the other cities opposed Skyflare’s intrusion, they would have difficulty doing so. After all, what truly mattered in a fight between powers were Tier 4 combatants. Although the saying one Tier 4 player could easily go up against a countless number of Tier 3 players was indeed exaggerated, it was still a fact that Tier 4 players could do many things that Tier 3 players couldn’t.

This was the difference between tiers and Life Ratings.

“No problem. I agree to your condition,” Lionheart said. After giving the matter some thought, he couldn’t find any problems with Shi Feng’s condition. “However, are we going to hold the test here?”.

In Lionheart’s opinion, Shi Feng probably wasn’t aware of the strength of his Blood Knight class. As one of the incredibly rare Ancient Legacies in God’s Domain, the Skills it offered were far superior to ordinary Peak Legacies. Not to mention, he currently had three Fragmented Legendary items on him: the Bulwark of Holy Blood, the Void Magic Armor, and the Windwall Ring.

Even when he had only the Fragmented Legendary Shield and Armor, he could already fend off Superior Mythic monsters. In fact, if not for the high HP and Defense of Superior Mythic monsters, he could even solo these monsters, given enough time. Now that he had the Windwall Ring, his defensive capabilities had soared even further. “I’m afraid this place isn’t sufficient. We’ll need to rent an advanced combat room,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “In that case, let’s go to our adventurer team’s Skyflare Hotel. There’s a special combat room there. It should be enough for us to display our strengths,” Lionheart suggested.

A special combat room? Shi Feng was surprised at Lionheart’s words. He never thought that special combat rooms already existed in the ancient God’s Domain. Special combat rooms were far superior to advanced combat rooms. They were perfect for practicing Skill and Spell usage. However, special combat rooms simply weren’t something that could be acquired at this stage of the game. “Let’s go to the Skyflare Hotel, then.”

Shi Feng and Yu Luo followed Lionheart’s group to the Skyflare Hotel, which was only one block away from the Auction House.

The instant the group walked into the Skyflare Hotel, Yu Luo grew a little excited. The Skyflare Hotel wasn’t a place just anyone could enter and rest at. Aside from Skyflare’s members and the members of partnered powers, who received a 50% discount, visitors would be charged the full price when staying at the hotel. Meanwhile, even the most basic room here cost 400 Magic Crystals per day.

Even a Tier 3 Void Realm expert like herself wouldn’t dare stay here for no good reason. Only when she needed to verify some theories and techniques she thought of would she make an exception and stay here.

As for Shi Feng, he felt as if he had just walked into a sacred training ground. The density of the Mana here was truly amazing, much more than even in Stone Forest City’s Freedom Hotel. In fact, the boost he got for his perception of magic elements was roughly 20% higher than what he got from the hotel he was currently staying at.

No wonder he’s so confident of being able to take out three million Magic Crystals per week. At this time, Shi Feng finally understood why Lionheart was so confident in the Skyflare adventurer team’s abilities.

Meanwhile, along with Shi Feng and Yu Luo’s arrival, an uproar occurred among Skyflare’s executives.

“I heard that guy named Black Flame wants to test the commander.”

“What? That guy must be crazy. He thinks the commander is someone he can test? Even if the commander just stands there and does nothing, he won’t be able to injure the commander in the slightest.”

“It’s not a standard PvP, though. He only wants the commander to take a hit from him.”

“It seems this person is trying to show his strength to our adventurer team. He must be worried that he can’t beat the commander, so he came up with that kind of condition. At that time, even if he fails to injure the commander, he could still salvage his reputation somewhat.”

When Skyflare’s several dozen executives looked at Shi Feng, who had already entered the special combat room, they promptly conducted hushed discussions among themselves. They all felt that Shi Feng was pulling such a stunt because he wished to gain respect yet was also worried about making a fool of himself.

However, in their opinion, Shi Feng’s actions were pointless. After all, when Lionheart dueled against other players, he almost never used his full strength to achieve victory.

Even Wind Chaser, who had reached Tier 4 as well, had been almost helpless against Meteorite’s Wall. And although Wind Chaser had eventually emerged victorious in his duel against Lionheart, he had done so by dragging out the fight and chipping away at Lionheart’s Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

HP.

Not to mention, this was in a situation where Lionheart had not gone all-out. Otherwise, even Wind Chaser shouldn’t think of harming Lionheart in the slightest.

Shortly afterward, all of Skyflare’s executives packed the special combat room’s spectator stands. Some executives had even abandoned their quests to spectate this duel. Lionheart had never fought in a duel since Wind Chaser had gotten promoted to Tier 4. During this period, Lionheart had improved significantly. Not only did he gain a new Tier 4 Legacy Skill, but he had also obtained the Fragmented Legendary ranked Windwall Ring, a defense-oriented ring.

At this point, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that their commander’s strength had already surpassed their imagination.

While Skyflare’s executives were eagerly waiting for the duel to begin, Shi Feng and Lionheart were standing in the middle of the room’s spacious battlefield. At this point, both fighters had already adjusted their conditions and were ready to take action at any time.

“I’m ready. You can make your move whenever you want,” Lionheart said as he raised his shield and longsword. From the crimson runes decorating the shield and longsword, it was evident the two were a set. Only, the Mana gathered around the weapon was slightly inferior in quality compared to what was around the Bulwark of the Holy Blood.

At this time, Lionheart stopped concealing his statistics. Immediately, his HP of 16.6 million appeared for everyone to see, flaunting the high HP of a Tier 4 defensive class.

It was evident that Lionheart planned to let Shi Feng see his own strength.

He has 16.6 million HP?! How is this possible?! Yu Luo gasped reflexively when she saw Lionheart’s HP.

As a defensive-class player, Lionheart already possessed incredibly high Defense, to begin with. Combined with his various defensive Skills and HP, he was practically a Boss monster.

Yu Luo even doubted that Shi Feng could one-shot Lionheart even if the latter did not defend himself. In fact, it would already be a miracle if Shi Feng could remove one-third of Lionheart’s HP in one hit.

“Amazing. Level 130 Tier 3 defensive classes usually have only nine million HP on average, yet you have almost twice that,” Shi Feng said in admiration.

“It’s nothing. It’s only because of my unique Legacy.”

Lionheart didn’t pay particular attention to Shi Feng’s words of appreciation. On the contrary, he wanted to use this opportunity to let Shi Feng realize the Skyflare adventurer team’s might. After all, Skyflare had already lost once to Shi Feng before. He needed to reclaim this loss and level the playing field.

“Since you’re ready, I’ll begin.” Shi Feng naturally understood what was going through Lionheart’s mind. Unfortunately, Lionheart simply wasn’t aware of Shi Feng’s aim. “Come!” Lionheart readied his shield, a serious expression appearing on his face.

Immediately afterward, not only did Lionheart’s aura skyrocket in intensity, but a faint, blood-red barrier had also appeared around his body.

“Crap! The commander is getting serious! He’s actually going all-out and fully exerting his Mana Body right off the bat!” one of Skyflare’s vice commanders, a robust, Level 132 Shield Warrior, said in astonishment.

Blood Armor!

This was the Tier 4 Legacy Skill Lionheart obtained after achieving a 100% Completion Rate with his Mana Body.

Although the magic barrier appeared flimsy, it could absorb up to five million damage. Moreover, the barrier would replenish itself once every 40 seconds. In other words, if one failed to cause over five million damage to Lionheart within 40 seconds, one had no chance of slaying him. Had Lionheart used this move during his duel with Wind Chaser back then, Wind Chaser wouldn’t have been able to harm him at all.

However, before Skyflare’s members were done admiring their commander’s Tier 4 Passive Skill, they saw Shi Feng unsheathe the Abyssal Blade. Immediately afterward, everyone clearly sensed the Mana in the room trembling and freezing momentarily!

Before anyone could react to the unexpected development, Shi Feng raised the Abyssal Blade with both hands and looked at Lionheart. The Mana inside the special combat room then began to boil, the phenomenon causing everyone present to shudder involuntarily. Afterward, everyone felt a wave of scorching heat wash over their body.

“This... How is this possible?!” When Wind Chaser sensed the Mana around him boiling, he was stunned.

After all, the space inside the special combat room was massive, with a 1,000-yard radius. That was more than enough for two Tier 4 players to fight to their hearts’ content.

Nevertheless, Shi Feng caused all of the Mana inside the combat room to boil just by entering a stance.

This kind of thing was simply unheard-of.

At this time, Lionheart’s gaze also changed. If entering a stance was enough to trigger such a phenomenon, Shi Feng’s strength was definitely far more extraordinary than he initially thought.

However, before Lionheart could take any further action, the flow of time inside the combat room seemed to slow down. The only thing capable of moving was apparently the sword in Shi Feng’s hands.

Second Sword, Holy Devour!

As the longsword descended, an overwhelming pressure fell upon the room.

Afterward, space within the room ignited, as if it couldn’t withstand the terrifying and violent pressure. The resulting flames threatened to burn everything in the room into nothing.

Not good! Holy Blood Wall! Four Saints’ Descent!

Upon seeing the boundless flames approaching him, Lionheart hurriedly activated the Defensive Skill Holy Blood Wall, then stabbed his shield into the ground and activated his strongest Tier 4 Defensive Legacy Skill.

The next moment, a twofold magic array appeared before the Bulwark of Holy Blood, which was followed by an illusory crimson shield that was over a dozen meters tall. Crimson runes flared all over Lionheart’s body, solidifying the surrounding space until it was as sturdy as a steel wall.

Meanwhile, the instant Lionheart used Four Saints’ Descent, the endless sea of flames devoured him like a giant beast.

Boom!

Accompanied by a thunderous explosion, the space within the special combat room transformed into a dark, empty void.
