Chapter 2709 – Difference in Strength

“Impossible!”

“What happened?” “I must be dreaming!”

Red Rain’s sudden death paralyzed the foreign aid teams’ members who were thinking of attacking Zero Wing’s other members. Some of them fell into shock, and others were petrified. However, one thing was for certain. The sight of Red Rain collapsing had already been thoroughly imprinted in their minds. They would never forget this scene for the rest of their lives.

“Is he even human?”

Sorrowful Heaven, who was spectating from a distance, was stunned. As he stared at the dead Guardian Knight, the shock in his eyes compounded. For a moment, he wondered if he was hallucinating. However, Sorrowful Heaven knew that what he saw was no illusion. At this time, the frightening aura Red Rain exuded had vanished. Even the life aura and Mana fluctuations the Guardian Knight radiated were no more. Only, he was having a hard time accepting this scene, so his brain had dreamed up an acceptable alternative to deny the reality.

At this time, Sorrowful Heaven wasn’t the only Domain Realm expert plagued with such a feeling. Every spectating Domain Realm expert was the same; Yan Tianxing was no exception.

A peerless expert!

This was an existence that represented the peak combat power of God’s Domain, yet one such expert currently lay dead on the ground. Meanwhile, the whole battle...

No!

This shouldn’t even be considered a battle. In fact, most of the people present didn’t even understand how Red Rain had suffered an attack.

“Monster! He definitely isn’t human! He must be one of God’s Domain’s monsters in human shape!”

“Yes! That must be it! There’s no way such a huge gap can exist between players!”

The players spectating from a distance couldn’t help but exclaim one after another as they gazed at Shi Feng.

“Yes! Everyone, be careful! He must be a transformed monster! He’s not a player at all!” “To think that such a monster would actually appear in the selection! We must notify the War God’s Temple about this immediately!”

The foreign aid players planning to target Zero Wing’s members overheard the spectating players’ exclamations and lost their cool. Simultaneously, they frantically considered ways to contact the War God’s Temple to slay Shi Feng. Only by embracing this logic could they return to the world they recognized.

After all, even the NPCs in God’s Domain were behaving like actual humans nowadays. It wouldn’t be strange for monsters to transform into players, either. “A monster?” Shi Feng chuckled involuntarily when he saw his demented opponents. “Indeed, I would look like a monster in your eyes. However, aren’t you monsters in the eyes of ordinary players?”

Ultimately, God’s Domain was still a game. So long as players continuously leveled up and obtained better weapons, equipment, Basic Attributes, physiques, reaction speed, Mana control, etc., their combat power would also keep rising. In fact, even an ordinary player could gain strength that was unfathomable to the current great experts.

God’s Domain was precisely such an unreasonable world!

If this battle had occurred before Shi Feng had reached Tier 4, even he would have had to rely on tricks to defeat a peerless expert like Red Rain. However, after he got promoted to Tier 4, Red Rain was no different from an ant to him.

Yes. The gap between Tier 3 and Tier 4 classes was that massive!

In the eyes of others, peerless experts were invincible existences. However, to the current Shi Feng, they were like ants that he could squish with a wave of his hand.

In fact, to kill Red Rain, Shi Feng had only used the Tier 2 Wind Blade.

Meanwhile, everyone present was momentarily rendered speechless by Shi Feng’s rhetorical question. Just as Shi Feng had said, ordinary players were nothing in their eyes. If they got serious, they could even kill ordinary players before the latter knew they were under attack.

At this time, Three Autumns, the eldest and most experienced player of the four teams, suddenly stepped forward.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, we admit defeat. Can I ask you to let us go?”

Although Three Autumns didn’t understand how Shi Feng had become so strong, they had no choice but to abandon the assault on Zero Wing, given the circumstances. Now, retaining their lives had greater priority. After all, they weren’t the four superpowers’ subordinates but partners.

“You admit defeat?” Shi Feng was slightly surprised by Three Autumns’s words. However, he quickly understood the elderly man’s reason for doing so.

The death penalty for this selection battle was exceptionally heavy. Let alone apex experts, even peerless experts like Three Autumns would suffer a major setback.

“Yes.” Three Autumns nodded.

None of the four allied foreign aid teams’ members objected to Three Autumns’s decision, either. After all, they truly couldn’t imagine what would happen if they fought against a monster like Shi Feng.

After scanning the silent crowd around him, Shi Feng said calmly, “Sure, but you need to sign a contract with me. Once you leave this place, each of you must kill five experts belonging to the superpowers backing you, and these experts must be of the same standard as yourselves.”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, the four teams’ experts immediately clamored in protest. “Guild Leader Black Flame, aren’t you going too far?” Elven Enchantress frowned, a glint of anger appearing in her eyes. “If we really do as you say, do you think those superpowers will let us off the hook?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They would, at most, lose five levels if they died on this battlefield. However, if they offended the superpowers backing them, they wouldn’t just lose five levels but would most likely get hounded out of God’s Domain. After all, if these superpowers did nothing after getting stabbed in the back by their so-called partners, who would take them seriously in the future?

“Going too far?” Shi Feng chuckled. “I don’t think so at all. From how I see it, you take Zero Wing for a pushover. If Zero Wing were one of the Five Great Super Guilds, would you still find this condition to be too much?”

“Guild Leader Black Flame, is there a need to make such assumptions?” Breathing out a deep sigh, Three Autumns added, “If Zero Wing really were one of the Five Great Super Guilds, we wouldn’t have accepted this partnership, to begin with. So, your assumption simply isn’t valid.

“Also, while we are indeed no match for you, if it really comes down to a fight, you won’t come out unscathed, either, Guild Leader Black Flame. After all, our Stamina and Concentration consumption is drastically increased here. How many people can you possibly kill by yourself? And how many people would your team have left at the end of the battle?

“Rather than suffer mutual destruction, isn’t it better if we settle things in another manner?”

Three Autumns clearly stated the various possible scenarios and listed their respective pros and cons. At this moment, let alone Youlan, Gentle Snow, and Aqua Rose, even Sorrowful Heaven, who was also in a leadership position, felt that this was the best option.After all, both sides weren’t mortal enemies. To ensure Zero Wing’s continued development, it was in Shi Feng’s best interests to avoid unnecessary losses.

However, defying everyone’s expectations, Shi Feng shook his head.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, are you intent on mutual destruction?” Three Autumns’s expression twisted slightly. As a peerless expert of God’s Domain and a Vice Alliance Master of the Fire Dragon Adventurer Alliance, it was already unbelievable that he was taking the initiative to admit defeat. He never thought that Shi Feng was actually a lunatic.

Meanwhile, upon seeing that Shi Feng refused to back off, Elven Enchantress snarled, “Black Flame, you’d better not go too far. You should know that we also represent the superpowers backing us this time. If you annihilate our teams, those superpowers definitely won’t let you off the hook. Zero Wing won’t be able to bear the consequences!’

“What you say is correct.” Shi Feng nodded. He then shifted his gaze to Elven Enchantress. “However, you’ve made one mistake.”

“Mistake?” Shi Feng’s words puzzled Three Autumns. He couldn’t figure out how he had misspoken.

The next moment, Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade. Immediately, the intensity of the aura he exuded increased severalfold. With him as the center, all Mana within a 1,000-yard radius started to roil, and even the air trembled.

“And that is...the difference in strength!”
