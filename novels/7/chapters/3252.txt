Chapter 3253 – Chapter 327 – Kingdom Shocked

The Red Star Kingdom’s Glorious Mantra!

The Iron Lion Kingdom’s Martial Quadbeast!

The Myriad Forest Empire’s Silent Saintess!

Glorious Mantra, Martial Quadbeast, and Silent Saintess were all paragons of the older generation. However, before they withdrew from the younger generation, they ranked among the top 10 of their respective country’s young paragons.

!!

Even back then, the three of them possessed strength rivaling the Ten Great Paragons of the current Ancient River Kingdom. It also went without saying that they were currently a lot stronger than they were before. While they might not be a match for Markless Blade, they were all potential contenders for the current Rookie Competition’s top 20.

Yet, now, Shi Feng had essentially put all three of these veteran paragons on death’s door using only three attacks. Moreover, he had even eradicated the three paragons’ party members using the same three attacks…

This development raised everyone’s shock to a whole new level. In fact, this outcome was multiple times more shocking than when Shi Feng killed Markless Blade in three attacks.

“Madness! This is madness! Black Flame is suppressing three veteran paragons all by himself!”

“Could those three have regressed in strength?”

“Impossible! The Titan Behemoth Martial Quadbeast summoned has Defensive rivaling Tier 5 Legendary monsters! A Legendary monster’s full-powered attack isn’t even enough to kill the Titan Behemoth in one hit, let alone reach Martial Quadbeast and take half of his HP away!”

“It’s not just Martial Quadbeast. Some time ago, Silent Saintess’s 24-layer defensive barrier kept her safe from a Tier 5 expert trying to assassinate her for over a dozen seconds.”

“There’s no way any of them has regressed in strength. The Darkness Transformation Glorious Mantra used just now is a Tier 4 Super Spell. When that Spell is active, even Legendary monsters will have difficulty damaging him.”

“If that really is the case, isn’t Black Flame a little too strong? We are talking about three paragons capable of ranking among the kingdom’s Ten Great Paragons. Even Markless Blade will probably fall if he has to go up against all three of them simultaneously.”

The players spectating the broadcast engaged in a heated discussion when they saw the three veteran paragons getting heavily damaged. Some people have even analyzed exactly how powerful the Skills and Spells the three veteran paragons had used, and everyone realized just how frightening Shi Feng’s strength was.

…

Back on the battlefield, Glorious Mantra, Martial Quadbeast, and Silent Saintess looked at Shi Feng with shock and fear in their eyes.

“A Saint-ranked Mana Technique!”

“He’s actually able to perfectly execute a Saint-level Mana Technique?”

After experiencing Shi Feng’s attack, the trio instinctively thought of Saint-ranked Mana Techniques.

Previously, the three of them had been standing quite far away when Shi Feng had killed Markless Blade with his three slashes, so they didn’t realize exactly what kind of attack Shi Feng had used to kill Markless Blade. However, after experiencing the same attack, they understood why Markless Blade was killed by those three slashes.

Saint-ranked Mana Techniques were incredibly rare, even in the Greater God’s Domain. Many ordinary hegemonic powers didn’t even have one in their possession. The difficulty of learning Saint-ranked Mana Techniques was also incredibly high. However, so long as a player could achieve perfect mastery over a Saint-ranked Mana Technique, they could exhibit strength rivaling Gold Combat Techniques when used at Tier 6.

Currently, although Shi Feng wasn’t a Tier 6 player, he already had the standards of a Tier 5 player. The power he could exhibit with a perfected Saint-ranked Mana Technique would be very close to a Gold Combat Technique.

So, even if Markless Blade was equipped with a piece of Tier 5 Magic Equipment, it wasn’t a shame for him to lose to Shi Feng. In fact, his defeat was inevitable.

This was because any player who had mastered a Gold Combat Technique could transcend tiers even without the help of a Legendary Weapon. They were existences who could stand at the Greater God’s Domain’s apex. Without a Legendary Weapon or Equipment of his own, how was Markless Blade supposed to stand up against Shi Feng?

“Retreat! It’s impossible for the three of us to beat him!” Martial Quadbeast said as he looked at Glorious Mantra and Silent Saintess. Immediately afterward, he took out a Tier 4 Instantaneous Movement Scroll, used it, and reappeared at a location several thousand yards away. He dared not stay near Shi Feng for even a moment longer.

As for Glorious Mantra and Silent Saintess, they had similarly used their precious tools and vanished from Shi Feng’s sight.

“They’re gone, just like that?”

Midsummer was momentarily stunned when she saw the three veteran paragons disappearing. She couldn’t believe that these usually lofty individuals would run away without even trying to put up a fight.

As for the players spectating the broadcast, they gaped in shock at this scene.

These were three Ten Great Paragon-level individuals they were talking about. Yet, these three veteran paragons had fled without trying to resist even in the slightest. This situation had never happened in the Ancient River Kingdom or the neighboring kingdoms.

It should be known that Martial Quadbeast and the others had only passively defended themselves before. They had never truly worked together to attack Shi Feng. If they joined forces, they could absolutely exhibit incredible combat power.

Yet, the three veteran paragons had fled in a panic after receiving only one slash each from Shi Feng…

Shi Feng, though, wasn’t surprised by this outcome. On the contrary, he felt that the three veteran paragons’ reaction was only a matter of course.

One would have difficulty perceiving Holy Annihilation’s power without experiencing it directly. Meanwhile, Glorious Mantra, Martial Quadbeast, and Silent Saintess were all paragons with a fountain of combat experience. So, after experiencing Holy Annihilation, it wouldn’t be difficult for them to recognize it as a Saint-ranked Mana Technique. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was true that, unlike Gold Combat Techniques, Saint-ranked Mana Techniques couldn’t show their full potential at lower tiers. Even so, any Tier 4 or Tier 5 player who had managed to fully master a Saint-ranked Mana Technique would still be invincible among players of the same tier.

Combining this with the fact that the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition provided a significantly easier way to participate in the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition, it was only natural that Martial Quadbeast and the others refused to die so early into the Rookie Competition’s official phase.

Subsequently, news of Glorious Mantra, Martial Quadbeast, and Silent Saintess getting scared away quickly spread like wildfire.

When the Ancient River Kingdom’s various powers learned about this outcome, they promptly recorded him in the list of paragons who were based in the kingdom. At the same time, they began frantically looking into Shi Feng’s identity and all other information related to him.

Not only did Shi Feng defeat Markless Blade, but he also frightened three top-tier paragons into running away. It had already been several decades since any paragon in the Ancient River Kingdom had accomplished such a feat. Even Saint Three, a paragon the Twin Saints Alliance touted to be a once-in-a-century genius, did not have such a dazzling achievement.

If they could win over such a paragon, it would be of great help to their development in the future.

…

At the same time, in the Ancient River Secret Land’s central zone, a two-man party finally defeated a wandering Tier 4 Heroic Spirit after fighting continuously for nearly half an hour. Then, this two-man party began to move as covertly as possible around the central zone, afraid of getting ambushed by other parties.

“Dammit! Why are there so many veteran paragons in the Rookie Competition this time?” Lightning Chaser cursed under his breath, his face colored with anger as he looked at a three-man party walking away from his hiding spot. “Every party we’ve met thus far has at least two or three paragons! How are we supposed to even kill any Heroic Spirits with those people wandering around?!”

“It can’t be helped. The Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition is a rare event that only occurs once every several decades. Nobody will want to miss such a big opportunity,” Desolate Fury said, sighing. “Among the remaining parties, I’m afraid we are the weakest. Now, all we can do is move around covertly and figure out a way to kill as many Heroic Spirits as possible. We’ll only be asking to get eliminated if we make any bold moves.”

“The weakest?” When Lightning Chaser recalled how Shi Feng had become famous throughout the Ancient River Kingdom, he couldn’t help but envy Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao.

Now that Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao had Shi Feng protecting them, the central zone was no different from their backyard. Even parties with three or four paragons would have to make way when they come across Shi Feng’s party.

“It’s pointless to start regretting now,” Desolate Fury said. When he saw the flash of envy appearing in Lightning Chaser’s eyes, he could more or less guess what was going through the other party’s mind. “If you hadn’t deliberately antagonized Black Flame, we might have been able to partner with him in the central zone. But now…don’t even think about it.”

“So what if he’s strong? With Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao holding him back, he won’t necessarily make it into the top 20,” Lightning Chaser said, curling his lips. “Moreover, now that he’s offended Heavenly Boa, there’s no way Heavenly Boa will let him off easily.”

“Perhaps.” Desolate Fury did not refute Lightning Chaser’s words. Instead, he bitterly smiled and said, “But according to the latest information the Alliance sent me, the names of the Ancient River Kingdom’s Ten Great Paragons have already been changed, and coming in first is Black Flame…”
