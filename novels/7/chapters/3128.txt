Chapter 203 – First Vice City Lord’s Privilege

“You’re here, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

Echoing Judgment walked over to greet Shi Feng when he saw Shi Feng entering the lobby.

Upon noticing Echoing Judgment’s actions, the executives of the various powers in the lobby also turned to Shi Feng, their eyes filled with wariness and envy.

Demand for Slumber City’s Hypersensitivity Potion had always been far above its supply. After Slumber City got promoted and news of it spread across the entire Stratified Abyssal Realm, powers situated in the dozen or so neighboring NPC Cities had promptly dispatched teams to Slumber City. It was obvious that these powers were trying to get a share of the benefits available in the upgraded Slumber City.

Once the representatives of these powers arrived in a few days, competition in Slumber City would definitely become even more intense. At that time, Slumber City might even see the birth of more hegemons.

However, no matter how many new hegemons appeared in Slumber City, Shi Feng would undoubtedly remain the biggest competitor for Slumber City’s local powers. Shi Feng’s forces might not have a large organization supporting him right now. However, he could still obtain a considerable amount of Hypersensitivity Potions with his status as Vice City Lord. If Shi Feng were to establish his own power in Slumber City like the three other Vice City Lords, he’d be able to lay claim to even more Hypersensitivity Potions.

Out of the various powers present in the lobby, Death Curse’s members bore the most hostility when they looked at Shi Feng.

“Savor your time while it lasts! We’ll see how you’ll fare once the neighboring cities’ powers gather!” one of Death Curse’s members said as he looked at Shi Feng with a sneer.

Destruction pursued the great.

Shi Feng might have proven his strength to everyone in Slumber City and even stolen Solitary Soul’s Vice City Lord position. Still, Slumber City had already become a pie targeted by the dozen or so neighboring NPC Cities.

There was no question that Shi Feng was occupying the most resources while having the weakest power in Slumber City currently. Once the neighboring cities’ peak powers arrived, they would most certainly set their sights on Shi Feng first. This would also be the quickest way for these foreign powers to establish a foothold in Slumber City.

“It seems you’ve acquired significant gains from the city’s promotion,” Shi Feng said, chuckling when he saw that Echoing Judgment was in a noticeably good mood.

“It’s not bad. Purple Light managed to just barely squeeze into the top five. It just so happens that the city’s top five powers are one of the biggest beneficiaries of the city’s promotion,” Echoing Judgment said in delight. “But compared to you, Guild Leader Black Flame, Purple Light’s gains are probably insignificant.”

“Did Vice City Lords get a bigger share?” Shi Feng asked out of curiosity.

“Much, much bigger than before, so much so that I’m starting to pity Solitary Soul a little. Had he stayed obedient, his adventurer team would have definitely undergone a qualitative transformation.”

“A qualitative transformation? Has the monthly production volume increased by a lot?” Shi Feng asked, feeling a little hopeful.

If Vice City Lords could exchange up to 1,000 bottles of Hypersensitivity Potions a month, he’d have enough to provide for both Zero Wing’s and Twilight Echo’s newcomers. After all, Zero Wing’s members numbered in the tens of thousands only, so there weren’t many talented newcomers to nurture.

“It’d be more accurate to say that it has increased to an entirely different dimension,” Echoing Judgment said, his voice suddenly taking on a serious tone. “Currently, the Matrix Tower can produce 40,000 bottles of Hypersensitivity Potion a month. However, while this might seem like a huge increase, considering the players who might be gathering in Slumber City, I’m afraid this increase isn’t as significant as it seems. Anyway, the exchange rate is similar to before, being at ten Dark Crystals per bottle. According to my sources, each Vice City Lord can exchange up to 3,000 bottles a month.”

“Three thousand bottles?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but gasp.

Before Slumber City’s promotion, the Matrix Tower only produced 6,000 bottles of Hypersensitivity Potion each month. Now, each Vice City Lord could exchange for half that number. This was a massive increase.

With this many Hypersensitivity Potions, he could even afford to supply the Hypersensitivity Potion to every core member in Zero Wing. At that time, Zero Wing’s core members would definitely see a qualitative improvement in their strength within a short period.

“I have a suggestion, Guild Leader Black Flame. The peak powers in the dozen or so neighboring NPC Cities will be gathering in Slumber City in a few days. Once they establish a foothold in the city, they’ll most definitely band together in secret, and their first target will most likely be you and the three other Vice City Lords. I’m afraid the three other Vice City Lords will most likely have difficulty coping against all of these peak powers even if they work together,” Echoing Judgment said earnestly.

“At that time, they’ll most likely have to split some of their allotted share with the foreign peak powers. Purple Light will most likely suffer the same fate as well. However, how much we give them will also depend on the gap in overall strength between us. My suggestion is for us to work together. What do you think, Guild Leader Black Flame? Would you be willing to join hands with Purple Light?”

“Since you’re offering, I naturally wouldn’t refuse, Commander Judgment,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.

Shi Feng wasn’t against Echoing Judgment’s suggestion. He also understood that Echoing Judgment was actually trying to help him. After all, the Purple Light Chamber of Commerce was one of Slumber City’s peak powers, while he only had a team of twenty. It should be known that their opponents this time were the peak powers of over a dozen NPC Cities. Even if all of Slumber City’s powers banded together, they still wouldn’t be a match for all of these peak powers. It went without saying that his team of twenty stood no chance at all.

Most importantly, he didn’t have the Dark Crystals needed to exchange all 3,000 bottles of his allotted Hypersensitivity Potions. If he could join hands with Purple Light, he could use Purple Light’s connections to sell his excess potions for a good price.

Afterward, Echoing Judgment parted ways with Shi Feng to prepare for the negotiations that would take place in a few days. As for Shi Feng, he made his way to one of the Matrix Tower’s third-floor VIP reception rooms. This was also the place where Vice City Lords could come to conduct their exchanges.

“Greetings, Lord Legatee. I am Senior Administrator Terrad. I am very happy to serve you today,” a Level 130, Tier 4 young man greeted Shi Feng respectfully after entering the room. “This is the list of items available for you to exchange. I believe you will be satisfied with the things listed here.”

Shi Feng nodded in response as he accepted the exchange list Terrad offered him. Unfortunately, he wouldn’t be exchanging for any items this time since he didn’t have a single Dark Crystal on him right now. He was only here to inspect the exchange privileges a Vice City Lord enjoyed.

What?! Shi Feng was dumbfounded when he saw the exchange list. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

According to Echoing Judgment, Vice City Lords should only be able to exchange up to 3,000 bottles of Hypersensitivity Potion per month. Yet, the exchange list in his hands showed that he could exchange up to 6,000 bottles. This was as much as the Matrix Tower’s entire monthly production volume before Slumber City got promoted!

What surprised Shi Feng even more, was that the exchange list actually had an item he had seen only once in the Greater God’s Domain during his previous life.
