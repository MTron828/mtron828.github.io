Chapter 422 - Warfire Set Equipment

“...”

Shi Feng was rendered speechless by the red-haired beauty.

If possible, he really wanted to say that he had not transmigrated, but had reincarnated instead.

“Are there players from other countries as well?” Shi Feng looked at the surrounding players. Confused, he asked, “The teleportation fees between countries are not cheap. With an elite player’s income, it is simply impossible to accumulate enough unless they sold a majority of their equipment. However, if they did so, why would they come to White Fog Canyon?”

Previously, Shi Feng had spent close to 300 Gold to teleport Aqua Rose and her hundred-plus subordinates to White River City. On average, each person had spent over 2 Gold.

Of course, this was a little higher than average because the Storm Empire where Aqua Rose and the others had originally resided was very far away. However, even if a player came from the Black Dragon Empire, they would need to pay around 1 Gold 40 Silver to reach White River City. Only those powerful players might be able to afford such a fee. As for the party of independent players before him, even if they emptied their pockets, at most, they would have 20 to 30 Silvers.

Accommodations, food, potions, repairs, and such things required a lot of money, so it was not possible for players to save too much.

Yet, among the crowd of players in White Fog Canyon, many had traveled across countries to visit. This was simply madness.

“You came to White Fog Canyon without even knowing this?” The red-haired beauty’s eyes widened, looking at Shi Feng as if he were a fool.

Suddenly, Shi Feng was momentarily stunned as he thought of a possibility.

Don’t tell me they’ve already discovered the secret of the Starfire Ore? Shi Feng’s chest tightened. He then shook his head, denying his thoughts. No. Even if the secret of the Starfire Ore had been discovered, there had not been this many players traveling to White Fog Canyon from other countries in the past.

Although Starfire Ore was quite valuable, it was not that easy to obtain in White Fog Canyon. The risks outweighed the benefits by far. Even in the past, not many players had risked themselves for the ore. On top of that, the levels of the current player population were much lower than in the past. With far greater risks, the canyon should not have attracted so many people.

Moreover, in the hands of others, Starfire Ore was not particularly valuable.

Each ore was only worth 1 Silver. Only by collecting 100 ore could one earn 1 Gold. However, with the level and tier of the current players, the difficulty of collecting 100 Starfire Ore was more difficult than clearing a 20-man Hard Mode Team Dungeon.

Shi Feng had considered Starfire Ore profitable because he had the Horizon Alliance, a Lifestyle Guild, working under him. There were even a large number of amazing forgers working for him. With the Starfire Ore, he could produce various high-level equipment and make a huge profit.

“Cloud, let’s stop wasting time with this brat. If this continues, the others will steal all the remaining Crimson-eyed Battle Monkeys. How are we supposed to make a profit then?” the Elementalist grumbled indignantly. “Don’t forget; we borrowed a lot of money to come here. If we waste any more time, our equipment will belong to someone else.”

“You really do not know?” the red-haired beauty asked again. However, seeing Shi Feng’s confused gaze, she didn’t think he was lying.

Previously, she thought Shi Feng belonged to another party when she saw him. However, after observing him for a while, she discovered that Shi Feng was alone. A Level 22 Assassin would find it very difficult to venture so far into the White Fog Canyon, much less a Swordsman. For this reason, she was optimistic about Shi Feng’s strength.

If their party had another strong player, they could explore further into the canyon. At that time, they would have fewer competitors, and their opportunity to make a fortune would grow.

“I really do not know. I haven’t logged into the game for over a day now. What exactly happened while I was gone?” Shi Feng spoke truthfully, a bitter smile on his face.

“So that’s why. However, you really are amazing. Despite not logging into the game for over a day, you are still Level 22,” the red-haired beauty laughed. “I’ll tell you, then. One day ago, one of the monsters in White Fog Canyon dropped an amazing item, so we hurried over. We’ll make a fortune if we obtain that item.”

“An amazing item? Making a fortune?” Shi Feng searched his memories. Soon, he laughed and said, “Might you be talking about the Warfire Set Equipment?”

“That’s right! It’s the Warfire Set Equipment!” The red-haired beauty nodded. Immediately, she rolled her eyes at Shi Feng, saying, “So, you do know about it!”

“I was just wondering if you had some other method to earn money,” Shi Feng apologized. “However, the drop-rate of the Warfire Set Equipment is extremely low. Also, even if one did drop, it would not be sufficient to cover your travel expenses.”

The Warfire Set Equipment was unique to White Fog Canyon, and any player could equip it. If a magical class wore it, the set would generate Attributes suitable to magical classes; if a physical damage-dealing class wore it, the set would generate Attributes suitable to physical damage-dealers. If a tank class wore it, the set would similarly generate Attributes suitable to tanks. Overall, the Warfire Set Equipment was very special.

In addition, the Warfire Set Equipment was evolvable. It started out as Bronze rank, and if one was willing to sacrifice a sufficient amount of EXP, they could evolve the set to Fine-Gold rank.

Meanwhile, the Warfire Set Equipment’s Level ranged from 20 to 30. Similar to Epic items, it would level up according to the player’s level. The Attributes of the equipment would similarly improve. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

A Level 30 Fine-Gold Set Equipment... To the core team of any Guild, equipment of such quality was extremely precious. It was incredibly hard to obtain even from a Dungeon. Not to mention, Dungeons had a Cooldown time, making it far more difficult to obtain a complete set. Hence, in the past, the Warfire Set Equipment had been highly sought after by the various Guilds.

As long as they sacrificed sufficient manpower, time, and EXP, they could obtain a Fine-Gold Set Equipment. The Warfire Set Equipment was the easiest Fine-Gold Set Equipment to obtain.

“What do you know?” the Elementalist said disdainfully. “Someone has already offered to purchase each set piece for 5 Gold Coins. If we collect all seven set pieces, that person is willing to pay 80 Gold. Moreover, this price was offered up ten hours ago. Now, it’s definitely higher than 80 Gold.”

“Eighty Gold?” Shi Feng could not help but laugh.

If they could really farm the full Warfire Set Equipment, Shi Feng was willing to spend even 180 Gold.

Not to mention a Level 30 Fine-Gold Set Equipment, even the Fine-Gold ranked Arclight Shields Shi Feng previously made had sold for over 30 Gold Coins.

In the past, there were many players who had sought to make a fortune through grinding for the Warfire Set Equipment. However, the set’s drop-rate was abysmally low. Only when Guild Teams had spent a long time grinding did they barely manage to obtain a few sets.

“Look at how excited you are. We need to get the full set in order to get 80 Gold,” the red-haired beauty laughed.

“How about this; if you guys obtain any of the set pieces, I’ll buy them for 10 Gold each.” Shi Feng decided that the red-haired beauty’s party was relatively powerful. If given a few days, they might obtain one or two set pieces. It was not a bad idea to purchase the Warfire Set Equipment directly. Items such as a Fine-Gold Set Equipment were mainly used for raiding Dungeons. To an independent player, its usage was limited. “If you gather all seven pieces, I’ll buy the set for 180 Gold.”

Hearing Shi Feng’s offer, the red-haired beauty’s party was stunned.

Shi Feng had so casually offered 180 Gold. It was not easy to obtain so many Gold Coins, even if one had the Credits to afford them. Not even the tycoon players could come up with so many Gold Coins at a moment’s notice. However, they had actually met such a player.

At this moment, all six had the same thought.

They’ve met a godlike tycoon!
