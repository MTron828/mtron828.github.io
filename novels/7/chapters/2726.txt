Chapter 2727 – Sword Emperor

When the eight copies of Shi Feng appeared above the battlefield, the audience momentarily fell silent.

“Doppelgangers?”

“Crap! Something like this is possible?!”

The spectators’ hearts were filled with an indescribable sense of shock as they looked at the nine Shi Fengs in the air.

If anyone else had summoned doppelgangers, they wouldn’t have thought much of it. However, Shi Feng was someone capable of single-handedly going up against seven bona fide Mythic combatants with Void Realm combat standards.

Now that Shi Feng had summoned eight doppelgangers of himself...

Meanwhile, Lina and the other Demidragons turned pale when they saw the nine Shi Fengs before them, their hearts plunging to the very bottom of the abyss.

They had to give it their all just to deal with one Shi Feng. Now that eight more had appeared, even if these doppelgangers had significantly weaker Basic Attributes, the Demidragons would still suffer tremendously.

“Let’s start the second round, then!” Shi Feng said, a faint smile appearing on his face as he looked at Lina’s group. The next moment, Shi Feng’s eight doppelgangers split up and charged at the seven Demidragons, their speed hardly any slower than Shi Feng’s.

“It’s just a doppelganger! Do you think you can scare me with it?”

Sandstorm stabbed his dagger at the doppelganger approaching him, the weapon instantly transforming into a dozen shadow snakes.

Advanced Combat Technique, Rampant Bites!

Seeing the approaching shadow snakes, the doppelganger brandished its sword.

Six Extreme Slashes!

The next moment, six sword lights tore through space, shattering the shadow snakes. One of the sword lights even bypassed the shadow snakes and landed on Sandstorm’s shoulder.

After the sword light passed through, a bone-deep cut appeared on Sandstorm’s shoulder. The Assassin’s body shot backward like a meteor and smashed into the ground. As for his HP, it had fallen by over one-eighth of its total.

Aside from Sandstorm, the other Demidragons were also sent smashing into the ground by Shi Feng’s doppelgangers and suffered heavy injuries. They were utterly incapable of resisting the doppelgangers at all, and they could only watch as their HPs continuously decreased.

Out of the seven Demidragons, only Lina, who had activated a Tier 3 Lifesaving Skill and reduced the damage she sustained by half, was in a better condition. However, as she had to cope with two of Shi Feng’s doppelgangers, her HP still decreased steadily. It was only a matter of time before she got killed.

“Those doppelgangers are so strong!” “Aren’t those doppelgangers a little too much? I get the feeling that just one of Black Flame’s doppelgangers is more than enough to kill a Mythic monster already!”

The audience in the spectator stands couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw Shi Feng’s doppelgangers suppressing Lina’s group.

Everyone present had seen doppelgangers before. However, this was the first time they had seen a player’s doppelganger capable of suppressing Tier 4 combatants. “No wonder! So, this is why Black Flame is confident in provoking Mythology!” Unyielding Heart felt endless admiration for Shi Feng when he saw Lina’s group getting beaten up.

It had been a long time since anyone had dared challenge the Five Great Super Guilds in the virtual gaming industry.

Now, not only did Shi Feng possess the combat power to overwhelm seven Tier 4 combatants, but it was also almost certain he would be able to capture Mythology’s Advanced Resource Node.

On the battlefield, Lina and the other Demidragons saw their HPs fall below the critical level. With only three or four more exchanges, they would fall to Shi Feng’s doppelgangers. However, before the battle could continue, several dazzling sword lights struck at the doppelgangers.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Shi Feng’s doppelgangers hurriedly defended against the attacks, the collisions resulting in explosions that created massive spatial rifts. “Vice Commander?”

Lina and the others were ecstatic when they saw the origin of the sword lights.

The person that just took action was none other than Prosciutto, the vice commander of Mythology’s trump card legion.

However, Prosciutto’s appearance had already undergone a drastic change at this time. Runes had appeared all over his pitch-black armor, and complex magic arrays covered his forehead and eyes. He also exuded a majestic aura reminiscent of a Demon God; even Shi Feng’s Mana Domain couldn’t suppress him.

A Bronze Combat Array? Shi Feng’s eyes were blank with surprise as he looked at Prosciutto’s transformation. However, he soon shook his head in denial. No. A Bronze Combat Array shouldn’t be something Tier 3 players can activate. Moreover, it’s impossible for Bronze Combat Arrays to make an appearance at this stage of the game.

Before Shi Feng could analyze the situation in detail, Prosciutto raised the purple greatsword he wielded and instantly appeared before him. The aura he exuded could make even Mythic monsters fearful.

“No! Impossible! Is he really a Tier 3 player?”

“His aura is stronger than even that of Superior Mythics.” Everyone spectating the fight gasped spontaneously at Prosciutto’s astonishing transformation. Muxin, who stood on the battlefield, couldn’t help staring at Prosciutto in horror and surprise. She couldn’t bring herself to believe this was true.

Previously, Lina and the others had already displayed monstrous strength. Muxin never imagined that Prosciutto would be even more monstrous.

At this time, Prosciutto could no longer be considered a Tier 3 player. He looked more like a Dragon wearing human skin. The terrifying aura he exuded caused the Tier 3 experts present to stumble backward, none of them daring to meet his gaze.

The only time Muxin had felt such a terrifying aura was when she faced a Tier 4 Dragon.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, you have truly surprised me,” Prosciutto said as he observed Shi Feng, his voice full of fighting spirit. “You are the first person to have forced me to use this form. As a token of my gratitude, I will be your next opponent!”

As soon as Prosciutto said so, the audience in the spectator stands cheered inwardly.

“Crap! Are you kidding me? Even Prosciutto intends to take action?!”

“A fight between the formidable Prosciutto and unfathomable Black Flame... This will definitely be the apex fight of God’s Domain.” “It’s more than just an apex fight! Look how the initial clash between the two already shattered the sky! If the two really fight each other, the entire island might get destroyed!”

“Monsters! These two are real monsters! Just getting the chance to spectate a fight between them is well worth the ticket price!”

At this time, besides the players on the spectator stands, the various major powers in the VIP viewing rooms were also greatly shocked by Prosciutto’s declaration. They immediately had all their members focus their attention on Prosciutto and Shi Feng, as well as record the two’s battle. After all, it was normally impossible to collect such information in the outside world. Only in this competition venue would they have the chance to do so.

However, after hearing Prosciutto’s declaration, Shi Feng abruptly turned away. “Are you two not going to come together?” Shi Feng asked loudly as he looked at the empty sky.

Shi Feng’s words confused everyone present. “Is he talking to himself?”

“Is there something in the sky?”

“Impossible! My screen isn’t showing anything there. Black Flame must’ve seen wrong.”

However, before anyone could dismiss their doubts, a deep voice suddenly came from the void and echoed throughout the sky.

“Amazing! As expected of the person Prosciutto and Cold Shadow are interested in!”

The next moment, a black shadow gradually appeared in the air.

When this black shadow revealed itself, everyone saw that it was a white-cloaked man of indiscernible age. Moreover, despite the man clearly standing in midair, it was as if no one could perceive his existence in their mind. Everyone looking at him ignored his existence automatically.

“Crap! Isn’t he that existence from Mythology?!” “Insane! This is insane! Mythology actually let this person join the competition?! Is Mythology trying to secure the championship?!”The players in the spectator stands were unfamiliar with this white-cloaked man. On the other hand, a wave of exclamations swept through the VIP viewing rooms when they saw him.

After all, this white-cloaked man was one of the terrifying existences in Mythology who had reached the Higher Domain Realm. Nobody knew his true age. The only thing others knew was that this man, called Odin, was one of Mythology’s three Grand Elders. Even Mythology’s Guild Leader had to obey his words.

“Sir! Why are you here?” Prosciutto put on an indescribably respectful expression the moment he saw the white-cloaked man. It was as if he had just seen a real god. “I only came here to deal with some matters, but it seems that won’t be possible now,” Odin said before glancing at Shi Feng. He then continued calmly, “Pack up. We’re abandoning this Advanced Resource Node.”

“We’re abandoning it?” Prosciutto was stunned. “But...why?”

This was the perfect chance for him to eliminate Shi Feng. How could he possibly be willing to give up at a time like this?

At this moment, let alone Prosciutto, everyone spectating the battle was dumbfounded.

Since when was Mythology so generous?

“Because”-taking another glance at Shi Feng, Odin chuckled — “he is already a Tier 4 Sword Emperor!”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
