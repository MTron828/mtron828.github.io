Chapter 427 – More Than One!

Star Lake City:

Along with the start of the city battle’s first round, the actions of the two cities’ battle groups were put on display for the inhabitants of both cities.

“Did Riverlight’s participants go crazy? They’re sending five ace battle groups to occupy one capture point? Aren’t they thinking too highly of Zero Wing?”

“I knew it! I knew that five-man battle group wouldn’t be reliable! Now, all that group has done is become easy pickings for Riverlight City!”

“I know, right? Even though the group called in five more people as reinforcements, they’ll only add up to ten people. They won’t even last a minute against Riverlight’s five ace battle groups. Just what the heck was Commander Red Frost thinking to make such an irresponsible person a vice commander? She’s doomed us all now.”

When Star Lake City’s inhabitants saw Riverlight City’s five ace battle groups encroaching on the capture point occupied by Zero Wing’s battle group, their hearts burned with anxiety.

…

“What should we do now, Vice Commander? None of the other battle groups are sending people over. With our battle group alone, there’s no way we can save Zero Wing’s members,” an Assassin anxiously asked Markless Blade as he watched 100 experts from Riverlight City close in on the capture point occupied by Zero Wing’s battle group. “My suggestion is that we run away while we still can.”

Hearing his subordinate’s suggestion, Markless Blade hesitated as he looked at Riverlight City’s five ace battle groups.

In reality, there wasn’t much of a difference in strength between Riverlight City’s and Star Lake City’s ace battle groups. So, even if a supposedly stronger ace battle group fought against a weaker ace battle group, the fight would usually drag out until reinforcements arrived.

However, it was a different story if two ace battle groups ganged up on one ace battle group. In that situation, the side with the numerical disadvantage would be fortunate if a few of its members could get away safely. And if five ace battle groups ganged up on one ace battle group, it would truly be a situation where even escaping would be impossible.

Yet, if Markless Blade chose not to help Zero Wing’s battle group, it would mean that Star Lake City would lose one battle group right off the bat. This would make things much more difficult for Star Lake City to go up against Riverlight City afterward. After all, even if Shi Feng’s battle group only had ten members, it was still better than nothing. Not to mention, Shi Feng performed outstandingly during the enrollment test.

“Quickly make a decision, Vice Commander!” the Assassin urged when he saw Riverlight City’s battle groups moving closer and closer to Zero Wing’s capture point.

…

While Markless Blade was in a dilemma, two women were quietly observing the actions of Riverlight City’s five ace battle groups from a nearby building.

“Should we act now, Big Sis Omen?” Thousand Scars asked, eager to flex her muscles when she saw Riverlight City’s battle groups.

“Okay, get ready to move,” Death Omen said, nodding. If they kept on dragging their feet, Zero Wing’s battle group would get annihilated before they could do anything.

Subsequently, Death Omen and Thousand Scars entered Stealth and made their way to Zero Wing’s capture point. On their way there, they would work together to kill any Riverlight City experts they came across.

…

As Riverlight City’s experts fell one after another, Chen Qilin’s complexion also turned gloomier and gloomier.

“Have those two lost their minds? Don’t they belong to Paimon? Why are they helping Zero Wing?” Slowfire said, puzzled by Death Omen’s and Thousand Scars’ actions.

Logically, Death Omen and Thousand Scars, as members of the Paimon Conglomerate, should know about the enmity between their organization and Zero Wing. Yet, the two Assassins were helping Zero Wing for some inexplicable reason.

Moreover, Death Omen and Thousand Scars were both unbelievably well-equipped. Both wielded a Legendary Weapon and wore a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set. If those two worked together, Slowfire suspected that even she would get killed if she weren’t careful.

“They are nothing more than outer members of Paimon,” Chen Qilin contemptuously said. “They probably don’t even know that Lord Reckless Knight is personally taking action this time. We’ll see how they fare once they meet him.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Reckless Knight was the Paimon Conglomerate’s Second Paragon and one of the likely successors to the Three Overlords. His name was known by all in the Starlight Realm. Although few people knew Reckless Knight’s appearance, they would immediately realize that they were going up against Reckless Knight once they started fighting him.

…

While Chen Qilin and Slowfire were talking, a person suddenly appeared within Zero Wing’s capture point.

Along with this person’s arrival, the spectators of both cities became incredibly silent. Some even started to have difficulty breathing.

“Mental deterrence! This is mental deterrence!”

“What a powerful mental deterrence! He’s…a pseudo-great grandmaster!”

“Why would a pseudo-great grandmaster appear in a third-tier city battle?”

The spectators of both cities were shaken as they looked at the holographic projection in the sky.

Pseudo-great grandmasters were existences above three-star mental strength grandmasters, and the chances of a three-star grandmaster becoming a pseudo-great grandmaster were less than 1 in 100. Pseudo-great grandmasters were already qualified to compete for a second-tier city’s City Lord position, and they would usually only participate in first-tier city battles. Almost never would such existences participate in a second-tier city battle, so for one to appear in a third-tier city battle between Star Lake City and Riverlight City was simply unbelievable.

…

“A pseudo-great grandmaster? How are we supposed to fight against that?”

At this time, the Assassin standing next to Markless Blade was horrified as he looked at Reckless Knight, the person who had appeared at Zero Wing’s capture point.

A pseudo-great grandmaster could not only manifest a complete set of Legendary Weapons and Equipment, but they could also unleash a mental deterrence on their opponents. While this mental deterrence might not be as powerful as a Tier 6 player’s mental deterrence in God’s Domain, it could achieve extraordinary effects in simulation warfare since players in simulation warfare lacked powerful Physiques.

On top of that, a pseudo-great grandmaster could also execute Absolute Techniques that the average grandmaster couldn’t in simulation warfare.

With these three points, a pseudo-great grandmaster was nigh invincible when going up against mental strength grandmasters or below in simulation warfare.

…

Before everyone could recover from their astonishment, Reckless Knight cast his gaze on Shi Feng and asked, “Are you Shi Feng?”

“I am.” Shi Feng nodded.

“Good!” Reckless Knight smiled. “Your life is mine!”

After saying so, Reckless Knight vanished into thin air, stunning all spectators. After all, Reckless Knight was supposed to be a Guardian Knight that didn’t have any stealth-related Skills. Yet, he had disappeared from everyone’s sight like an Assassin entering Stealth.

Less than half a second later, an explosion occurred twenty yards in front of Shi Feng.

When the dust clouds created by the explosion dissipated, two people–a man and a woman–could be seen standing at the explosion’s epicenter. Of the two, the man was Reckless Knight, while the woman was the innocent and lovely woman from Zero Wing’s battle group. After looking at the woman again, everyone couldn’t help but gasp.

“A pse-pseudo great grandmaster!”

“She’s a pseudo-great grandmaster as well?!”
