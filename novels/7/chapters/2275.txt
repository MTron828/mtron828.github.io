Chapter 2276 – Difference between Tier 3

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, everyone present could not help but gape at him in astonishment. Even Blue Phoenix was surprised.

“Guild Leader Black Flame?” After Blue Phoenix confirmed that the person who had emerged from the forest was Shi Feng, her eyes filled with even greater shock.

After the Storm Serpent King raid, Shi Feng had disappeared from the public eye. Despite launching a frantic manhunt, the various major powers of Dragonheart Island failed to find any traces of him even after searching relentlessly for 20 days. It was as if he had disappeared completely from God’s Domain. This situation had caused quite the commotion in the game.

Due to this situation, many had rumored that Shi Feng had hidden himself out of fear of retaliation by the various superpowers. Gossip was that he had stopped logging into the game completely. It was even bruited about that a superpower had secretly taken action against Shi Feng in the real world already.

She never thought that Shi Feng would actually appear in this place.

“So, it is Guild Leader Black Flame.” When Autumn Plant saw Shi Feng approaching the battlefield, he revealed an excited expression. “Guild Leader Black Flame, the Sea of Death’s various major powers have constantly been searching for you these days. I never thought you would be here in the Buried Bones Ruin. I really am fortunate today.”

Before Autumn Plant had even finished speaking, four Level 87 players standing behind him suddenly moved to surround Shi Feng.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, be careful! They’re War Blood’s Four Naval Generals! They all possess a Naval Legacy and can form a natural battle array!” Blue Phoenix warned hurriedly.

Every one of the Four Naval Generals was a team leader-level individual in War Blood. Unlike other adventurer teams, those capable of becoming team leaders in War Blood were either peak experts or players strong enough to rival peak experts. Among them, the Four Naval Generals were veteran team leaders of War Blood—all bona fide peak experts.

Moreover, all four of them possessed Naval Legacies. Out at sea, they could contend against even Domain Realm experts. Meanwhile, under circumstances where they were further strengthened by a battle array, even Domain Realm experts would fall to them quickly.

“Too late!” Autumn Plant said, smirking. He had deliberately spoken so much and so slowly before in order to buy the Four Naval Generals time to activate the Legacy Battle Array they possessed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In the next moment, the Four Naval Generals appeared at Shi Feng’s four corners, a dark-blue magic array forming beneath each of them. Suddenly, a dark-blue pillar rose into the air, creating a battle array with a 300-yard radius. Immediately after, the intensity of the Four Naval Generals’ auras burgeoned. Their physical appearances started transforming as well.

After just three short seconds, all four of them had become six-meter-tall giants lavished with mysterious, dark-blue runes.

“The Sea Giant Legacy?” Shi Feng concluded as he looked at the Four Naval Generals.

Although the Sea Giant Legacy was not a Peak Legacy, it was still a very rare Advanced Legacy, which had been very famous in Shi Feng’s previous life. Upon activating the Sea Giant hidden class’s Legacy Battle Array, players would transform into a Sea Giant and have their Life Rating increased until it was only slightly inferior to that of Archaic Species. If the battlefield was out at sea, a Tier 2 Sea Giant would even be capable of fighting an ordinary Tier 3 player.

At this moment, Shi Feng more or less understood why War Blood ranked third among the numerous adventurer teams on Dragonheart Island and that its naval strength could rival even that of superpowers.

War Blood daring to send a team to target Blue Phoenix was also natural. With such strength, Phoenix Rain’s faction alone was no match for War Blood; Phoenix Rain would have to become the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion’s Great Pavilion Master and unite the entire Pavilion to be able to contend with the adventurer team.

“I never thought that you would know about this Sea Giant Legacy, Guild Leader Black Flame. You really are a knowledgeable person.” Autumn Plant was slightly surprised when he heard Shi Feng’s words. At this point, most people only knew that the Four Naval Generals had obtained a Naval Legacy but not what it was exactly. “Since you know about the Sea Giant Legacy, then you should know of its capabilities. I won’t trouble you too much, Guild Leader Black Flame. If you hand over the Fragmented Legendary item you got from the Storm Serpent King, then I can let you all leave this place safely!”

“You think you can stop me with just four Sea Giants?” Shi Feng asked, smiling.

“How would I dare underestimate you, Guild Leader Black Flame? The Four Naval Generals would indeed have a very difficult time stopping you, but I’m afraid that you aren’t aware that the current era has already changed,” Autumn Plant said, looking at Shi Feng with a playful expression.

“What do you mean?” Shi Feng asked, unsure what Autumn Plant was talking about.

“What I mean is that you are already outdated!” Autumn Plant said as he suddenly fished a dark-blue crystal from his bag, the crystal looking somewhat similar to the one Blue Phoenix took out earlier. He then squeezed and shattered the crystal. “While you were hiding here in the Buried Bones Ruin, Starlink led the various major powers to capture the Gravity Mountain Range’s Gravity Temple and secured the ancient civilization’s strength!”

In the next moment, a threefold magic array formed on Autumn Plant, then rapidly absorbed the surrounding Mana and condensed it on him. As a result, the intensity of Autumn Plant’s aura skyrocketed. His aura became so strong that it even surpassed the Four Naval Generals’ and now stifled those who were bathed in it.

“Not good! That’s a Deification Crystal!” Blue Phoenix revealed a look of despair when she saw Autumn Plant’s transformation.

“That’s right! This Deification Crystal is the ancient civilization’s power!” Autumn Plant stated proudly as he looked at Shi Feng. “Thanks to the Deification Crystal’s power, I am now a bona fide Tier 3 player. Do you think you can still escape me?”

After saying so, Autumn Plant raised his staff and cast a Spell. Suddenly, a twofold magic array appeared in the sky, enveloping a 50-yard radius. Immediately, Shi Feng, Blue Phoenix, and the other members of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion felt intense pressure assaulting their bodies. At the same time, their Basic Attributes also decreased by 20% and Movement Speed by 30%.

Tier 3 Legacy Spell, Oceanic Sky Domain!

Domain Skills and Spells were incredibly powerful. A Domain Spell might not seem very powerful at Tier 2, but after reaching the Tier 3 standard, it would allow a magical class’s combat power to undergo a qualitative transformation. Moreover, players would no longer have to stand still while channeling the Domain and could move around freely. In addition, all Mana within the Domain’s AOE would be under the caster’s control, allowing chantless spellcasting.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, run away quickly! The Deification Crystal not only transforms him into a Tier 3 player but also allows him to enter the Nothingness Realm, which greatly increases his Spells’ Completion Rate!” Blue Phoenix hurriedly warned when she saw Autumn Plant getting ready to take action.

An increase in Spell Completion Rate would provide instantaneous improvements to a magical class player’s combat power. In addition, Autumn Plant owned a Naval Legacy, so his current combat power was far superior to that of an ordinary Tier 3 player.

“Run away? Do you think that’s possible?” Autumn Plant sneered.

In the next moment, the Level 96 Hell’s Guardian appeared behind Shi Feng, cutting off his path of retreat completely. With the Oceanic Sky Domain in effect, there was no way he could surpass the Hell’s Guardian in terms of Movement Speed. Now, just the Hell’s Guardian alone would be more than enough to finish him off. Not to mention, Autumn Plant could also control the Elemental Mana inside his Domain to attack Shi Feng.

After speaking, Autumn Plant directed the drifting Mana to create six water torrents and sent them shooting at Shi Feng.

Each of the six water torrents carried Strength rivaling that of a Level 87 Grand Lord. Under Autumn Plant’s control, the water torrents were like nimble snakes, their attack trajectories simply unpredictable. If these six water torrents coordinated with the Hell’s Guardian, killing a Domain Realm expert would be a piece of cake.

Moreover, the Four Naval Generals were still patiently waiting for an opportunity to strike at Shi Feng from the sidelines. So long as Shi Feng suffered an attack and revealed an opening in his defense, they would immediately move in to deal him a fatal blow.

However, even when the Hell’s Guardian’s battle axe and the six water torrents were about to devour Shi Feng, he did not activate a Lifesaving Skill, contrary to everyone’s expectations. Instead, he simply unsheathed the Twilight Blade and started brandishing it together with Killing Ray.

Sword’s Transmigration!

After the arduous training in the Tower of Four Gods, Shi Feng had further perfected and simplified Sword’s Transmigration. When he executed the technique now, the descending battle axe and the approaching water torrents all seemingly avoided him, as they merely brushed past his body without harming him in the slightest.

Impossible! Autumn Plant gasped involuntarily.

Autumn Plant had thought that Shi Feng might defend against his attacks with a Lifesaving Skill. He had also considered the possibility of him using a Berserk Skill. However, he never imagined that Shi Feng could actually defend against such a powerful assault with just his two swords. Shi Feng didn’t even use a Skill throughout this process!

Before Autumn Plant could snap out of his daze, Shi Feng executed Wind Blade with a 103% Completion Rate, disappearing from his original location and arriving before Autumn Plant in the blink of an eye. Shi Feng’s Movement Speed far surpassed even that of the Hell’s Guardian.

Secret Technique, Lightning Flash!

In the next moment, an all-encompassing net of sword lights flew toward Autumn Plant. In response, Autumn Plant activated Blink and instantly appeared 20 yards away from Shi Feng. However, before Autumn Plant could do anything else, his body suddenly crumpled forward powerlessly because, at this moment, his HP had already reached zero.
