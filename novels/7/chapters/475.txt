Chapter 476 - Haunted

Only after finishing off Overwhelming Smile’s expert party did Shi Feng begin to loot the items they had dropped.

Since Overwhelming Smile and Zero Wing had labeled each other Hostile Guilds, none of the members of either Guild would receive any Crime Value when killing each other. However, aside from slaughtering the members of Zero Wing, the expert parties of Overwhelming Smile also frequently killed players who possessed high quality equipment, resulting in them becoming Red Names.

As Red Names, the penalty they received for dying multiplied, resulting in them dropping an abundance of items when they died.

The six Overwhelming Smile experts had dropped a total of 54 items. Of them, 45 pieces were equipment, with a majority of the equipment being Secret-Silver rank, and only eight being Fine-Gold rank. However, this was a significant harvest. In addition, there were nine items had dropped from the experts’ bags. Of the nine items, seven had dropped from the first Berserker Shi Feng had killed.

In God’s Domain, the chance of players dropping items from their bags upon death was minuscule. However, as the Overwhelming Smile experts were Red Names, this chance had been multiplied by several times. Even so, it was still a very small chance.

The fact that Shi Feng had obtained seven items from a single player’s bag, in addition to the 45 pieces of equipment from killing a six-man party, was mainly due to this Berserker dropping all of his equipment. He had nothing left. It was unbelievable...

“Just how abysmal is this fellow’s luck? Did he do something to anger the heavens? Not even someone who had killed thousands would have such a fate!” Shi Feng could not help but pity the Berserker lying at his feet.

Regardless of how Shi Feng felt, he still pocketed the Berserker’s items. However, when he looked through the items, he discovered a dozen bottles of a black potion.

“Isn’t this the potion that Berserker drank before the battle?” Shi Feng examined the black potion and suddenly recalled the Berserker’s comment. He had not given the man’s words much thought at the time, but as he looked at the potion now, he realized that it was something special.

The black potion would actually increase the drop-rate when killing players. However, the potion’s effects similarly affected its user, and if the user died, their drop-rate would multiply as well. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This was the first time Shi Feng had seen or heard of such a potion.

There were over ten thousand types of potions in God’s Domain. Although he had played the game for over a decade, he was still ignorant of many of the items in the game. It was especially true for original creations of Master Alchemists, Master Forgers, and other lifestyle Masters.

Shi Feng then read the black potion’s data.

“Sure enough, this potion was crafted by a player.” Shi Feng could not help his shock upon reading the information of the black potion.

This potion is called Haunted. Once consumed, the PVP drop-rate increases from 100% to 300%. Meanwhile, if the user is killed by another player, their drop-rate increases from 200% to 600%. Haunted has a duration of five minutes and a Cooldown of half an hour.

“Whoever made this potion is amazing.” Shi Feng wanted to meet Haunted’s creator. Unfortunately, the creator was displayed as “Unknown.” It was clear that Haunted’s creator wanted their identity to remain hidden.

Shi Feng had a significant understanding of God’s Domain. There were indeed tools that could increase a player’s drop-rate when killing other players, and every one of these tools were precious. However, Shi Feng had never heard of a potion with such a function. It was inconceivable that such a potion had appeared.

The current players of God’s Domain were still very low-level, and the materials they could obtain were limited. To create such a powerful potion with such limited materials, this Alchemist must be a genius.

“No wonder Overwhelming Smile is so zealously slaughtering other players. With Haunted, they can easily obtain plenty of valuable equipment.” Shi Feng suddenly understood the reason behind Overwhelming Smile’s abnormal actions.

Currently, as both Zero Wing and Overwhelming Smile fought in an all-out war against each other, both sides had suffered significant losses in terms of equipment. With Haunted, however, Overwhelming Smile could fund their battles with battles. The more well-equipped the player they killed was, the higher the quantity and quality equipment they could obtained. Normally, players would only drop one piece of equipment upon death. A single player had over a ten pieces equipped. If only one out of those many pieces dropped, the chances of obtaining a good equipment was relatively low. After consuming Haunted, however, the members of Overwhelming Smile could obtain up to three pieces of equipment from the players they killed, significantly increasing their chances of obtaining good equipment.

“Since this is the case, I won’t have to be polite with them,” Shi Feng revealed a faint smile as he stored the 12 bottles of Haunted in his bag.

In reality, the PVP drop-rate relied heavily on the Luck Attribute.

Shi Feng’s current Luck was relatively high. If he activated Divine Providence, he could raise his Luck to 25 points. If Shi Feng killed an ordinary player, even without consuming Haunted, it was almost certain that player would drop two or three pieces of equipment. Moreover, there was a relatively high chance for those two or three pieces to be the best pieces said player wore.

If he included the effects of Haunted...

Considering the situation, Shi Feng began to search through the Guild channel, looking for any Guild members in Watch Cemetery who had encountered an ambush.

“Perfect. You’ll do.”

After a moment, sure enough, some members had reported through the Guild channel that Overwhelming Smile’s experts had ambushed them. They were in the Watch Cemetery. Immediately, Shi Feng input the coordinates into the Seven Luminaries Ring and activated Space Movement. He then jumped into the spatial crack that appeared before him.

---

In one of the gravel-filled prairies of the Watch Cemetery, a team of over a dozen players ran desperately for their lives. As they ran, the ranged classes on this team attacked the six robust-looking players pursuing them.

If this happened anywhere else, it would confuse any onlookers. The side with more players actually fled from the side with less players.

In the Watch Cemetery, however, nobody would find this scene surprising because the side with less players consisted of bloodthirsty lunatics with astonishing strength. Moreover, this party of lunatics consisted of only melee classes; there was not a single ranged class in their party.

“Damn, why aren’t any of my attacks hitting them?” one of the escaping male Elementalists grumbled, dismayed as he watched the distance between his team and their six pursuers decrease.

“Hold on for a little longer. The Tier 1 experts of our Guild are heading towards us right now.” A Level 24 Ranger, the leader of the team, tried to encourage his team members as he attacked with a Frostbolt.

Everyone on the team nodded to their team leader’s words, newfound hope blooming in their hearts.

The group of Overwhelming Smile experts behind them was simply too powerful. Before they had realized they were being ambushed, four of their team members had died. Although they tried to retaliate, the experts dodged or blocked most of their attacks; only a small number of control skills had any effect. Unfortunately, none of those skills were fatal.

As soon as the battle had begun, they had sent out distress messages through the Guild channel, reporting their current location. Fortunately for them, one of their Guilds Tier 1 expert parties was only a short distance away from them. They would be safe as long as they could reach that Tier 1 expert party.

“Everyone, stop!” the Ranger shouted when he saw a cloud of cold air rising from the ground in front of them. Before any of them had noticed, another party had appeared. Moreover, the Shield Warrior standing in the lead was currently using a Magic Scroll.

Unfortunately, the Ranger’s command was too late as a gigantic icicle suddenly emerged from the ground. The icicle struck the players at the forefront of their team, a damage of over -1,000 points appearing above their heads. Simultaneously, frost shrouded their bodies, massively reducing their Movement Speed.

“We’re finished...” Despair filled the Ranger’s eyes as he stared at the massive icicle in front of them.

They had barely survived the pursuit of a single party of experts. Now that another party had appeared, blocking their path, they no longer had any hope of escape...

“Hahaha! Come on! Keep running! I want to see how far you can get!” one of Overwhelming Smile’s experts sneered upon seeing the Zero Wing team’s predicament.

At this moment, however, a spatial crack appeared in the air, and a human figure suddenly emerged.

“Oh? It seems that I am quite lucky today.” After Shi Feng landed, he swept a glance over the two expert parties from Overwhelming Smile, a faint smile appearing on his face.
