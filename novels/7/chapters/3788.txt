Chapter 863 – Flame Dragon God’s Treasury

Jun Tiankuo’s teammates fell silent momentarily when they heard his words.

“Tiankuo, are you saying that he killed this Boss alone?” Looking at the Dead Thousand-Eyed Demonic Hand, the female Cleric blurted out, “But how is that possible? He’s only level 212. He might have War Goddesses fighting for him, but they’re only Level 220. Even if the Boss stood still and did nothing, they wouldn’t be able to kill it. Not to mention, we rushed over as soon as we heard the commotion. Without at least a team of several hundred, there’s no way this Boss can be killed so quickly.”

One of the main headaches the various powers’ frontline teams faced when raiding Regional Bosses stemmed from their immense HP and rapid battle recovery. As strong as their team of 20 was, even they lacked the firepower to take down a Level 236 Regional Boss in a short time.

This was why they chose to inspect their surroundings the moment they arrived in the area rather than pay attention to Shi Feng. After all, they simply couldn’t fathom the possibility of a Level 212 player soloing a Level 236 Boss in only an hour or so.

“It may be impossible for others, but Black Flame is different,” Jun Tiankuo said before sharing a battle video with his teammates. It was none other than the recording of the fight between Shi Feng and Abyss Water. “One of my friends recorded this in the Shadow Mountains. Do any of you think you can survive his attack?”

Despite being only three seconds long, the battle video captured the entire fight. It opened with Abyss Water initiating the fight, followed by Shi Feng neutralizing all of the crimson energy blades. Then, the video concluded with Shi Feng appearing behind Abyss Water and decapitating him.

When the video ended, Jun Tiankuo’s teammates were left stunned.

“I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t have the slightest confidence in surviving that attack. Now, do you still think he can’t kill this Regional Boss?” Without waiting for a response, Jun Tiankuo added with a longing gaze, “Ever since the Eternal Realm appeared, I’ve wanted to meet the experts there. I also want to meet the rumored Holy Race experts. It’s a pity I never got the chance. But now that several powers have already discovered the entrance, I believe it won’t be long before its coordinates become public. When that time comes, I plan to test myself in the Eternal Realm and see where I stand in God’s Domain!”

When Jun Tiankuo’s teammates heard his words, their interest was piqued, and their eyes lit up in excitement.

They, like Jun Tiankuo, constantly sought to push their limits with extreme challenges. Previously, they thought the Twelve Sanctuaries were the center of the Greater God’s Domain. They thought that so long as they could reach the Twelve Sanctuaries’ apex, it would be the same as reaching the Greater God’s Domain apex. Thus, they never saw the need to leave the Twelve Sanctuaries.

But now, they realized they had been terribly mistaken.

If even the 281st-ranked expert on the Divine Glory List was such a terrifying existence, how strong were the top 100 experts?

Of course, they knew the Divine Glory List’s rankings weren’t necessarily reliable. Even so, it could still give a general impression of a player’s standard.

Besides the Divine Glory List’s experts, there were also the foreign players in the Eternal Realm, such as the Holy Race players, who were considered much stronger than the human players. This was the first time since God’s Domain’s launch that players of other races had appeared.

Suddenly, the doors to a whole new world had opened to them.

…

Meanwhile, after a ten-minute teleportation, Shi Feng arrived before an ancient temple surrounded by mountains. The temple spanned an area greater than a large city, and countless divine patterns covered the surrounding mountains to form a barrier that enveloped the entire temple.

The moment Shi Feng crossed the barrier, a powerful suppressive force acted on him, drastically weakening him. If, outside the barrier, he was considered a divine being capable of shattering worlds, within the barrier, he was just a mortal with above-average strength.

Once inside the barrier, Shi Feng quickly landed in a plaza in the middle of the temple, where he discovered that many other players had already arrived before him. These were all players who had rushed to the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury upon collecting 100 Undying Souls. Most of them were Level 235 or above, but there were also a few players who were below Level 235.

So many people have arrived already? When Shi Feng scanned the plaza, he spotted over a hundred figures, far more than he had anticipated.

As the Flame Dragon God’s Nest was a secret land, players would need to obtain its Access Key if they wanted to control it. Although the Access Key would not let players prohibit others from entering the secret land, it could be used to control the size of the entrance and move the entrance’s location up to 10,000 yards from its original location.

For example, if the Flame Dragon God’s Nest’s controlling power shrunk the entrance to accommodate only two or three players and moved it to a location fortified with magic arrays, it would become very difficult for other players and powers to enter the secret land. They would have to obtain permission from the controlling power beforehand.

Additionally, the Access Key could grant Key Imprints to other players, allowing these players to leave the secret land whenever they wanted. In the Flame Dragon God’s Nest, Key Imprints could let players exit the secret land without dying and losing a portion of their Immortal Souls.

For these reasons, if a power wanted adequate control over the Flame Dragon God’s Nest, it must have the secret land’s Access Key, which could only be exchanged for in the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury.

The Flame Dragon God’s Treasury was situated in the secret land’s core area. Besides being a place for players to exchange Undying Souls for rewards, it was also populated with many monsters. This made it the best place to farm Undying Souls. Thus, anyone seeking the secret land’s Access Key would come to the treasury as soon as possible. Of course, that was assuming they had enough strength to kill the monsters here. Otherwise, they would have come here for nothing.

System: You have discovered the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury. You may exchange for the Flame Dragon God’s reward directly from the Flame Dragon God Plaza.

So that’s why they’re all standing here.

Originally, Shi Feng thought the players in the plaza were waiting for their companions to arrive. But now, he realized that they were instead browsing the items available for exchange in the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury.

Out of curiosity, Shi Feng also started to browse the treasury’s exchange list.

Many rumors surrounded the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury in his previous life. One of the rumors was that the treasury contained clues to how to go beyond Tier 6. However, because the Holy Dragon Spear had occupied the Flame Dragon God’s Nest early, by the time secret land was opened to the public, almost all of the items in the treasury had already been exchanged. Furthermore, nobody from Holy Dragon Spear had managed to go beyond Tier 6. So, everyone merely used it as a conversation topic during their free time, and nobody actually believed it.

In this life, though, the Flame Dragon God’s Nest had activated abruptly, and even Holy Dragon Spear was only entering the secret land for the first time. So, this was a good opportunity to see what the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury had to offer.

However, shortly after calling up the exchange list and seeing what it offered, Shi Feng couldn’t help but rub his eyes in doubt.

World’s Scar?

Shi Feng was shocked when he saw the fifth item on the exchange list.

World’s Scar. It was publicly acknowledged as one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Ten Great Divine Swords. It was also the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s number one Godly Relic. In his previous life, it was used by one of the Eternal Realm’s Three Absolutes, Aurebeth.
