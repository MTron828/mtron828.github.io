Chapter 2711 – Lucky Zero Wing?

War God’s Temple’s central hall:

In response to the bell signaling the preliminary selection’s end, the various superpowers’ upper echelons quickly gathered in the normally deserted central hall.

In just a few moments, players filled one-third of the hall, which was the size of half a football field.

“The selection battle began less than ten minutes ago, yet the ending bell already rang. Did the selection’s rules change?”

“That shouldn’t be the case. The rules were verified before the competition.”

“But it ended in less than ten minutes. I doubt anyone can do anything in such a short time, right?”

...

The various superpowers’ upper echelons curiously discussed the selection battle’s abrupt end. All of them wanted to know why the selection ended so soon.

Amid the various discussions, a huge teleportation array appeared in the middle of the hall. A moment later, a stone stele emerged from the magic array. The appearance of the stele instantly attracted the various superpowers’ attention. This was especially true for the nine superpowers that had recruited foreign aid.

This was because the nine superpowers’ names were gradually appearing on the stele. The announcement of the number of players that passed the selection for each Guild was evidently forthcoming.

“What?! The results are actually out so soon?!”

“I wonder which Guild will have the most helpers? If anyone can get over 20 official foreign aid slots, it would be of significant help in the official competition.”

“According to the information we received, Miracle should have the best odds. After all, they recruited Elven Enchantress. She’s top-notch when it comes to long-range sniping and sneak attacks. She can easily snipe the War God Order holders. Also, compared to the five other Absolutes, her attacks are the trickiest to block.”

The various superpowers’ upper echelons excitedly made conjectures as they watched the words slowly appear on the stele.

On the other hand, Frost Heaven’s members grew nervous. According to the intelligence they secretly acquired, Frost Heaven’s overall strength could only be considered average. If they lacked sufficient foreign aid, they would most likely lose all hope of gaining one of the six reserve seats.

The official competition for the reserve seats would be a struggle for land and resources. The greater the number of powerful experts one had, the more advantageous one’s position.

After a Guild occupied a Resource Node, it would acquire a Resource Emblem. And when a player wore the Resource Emblem, so long as they did not leave the Node’s range, the Guild they belonged to would continually earn Guild Points. Hence, the player wearing the Resource Emblem had to be incredibly strong.

Otherwise, it would be very easy for other Guilds’ experts to ambush and kill the emblem holder.

“Ten! Just ten people is fine!” Muxin prayed quietly as she looked at the monument. She didn’t place much hope in having many of their helpers pass the preliminaries. She only hoped that Frost Heaven’s foreign aid count did not lag behind the other superpowers’.

“Ten? She sure knows how to dream.” Thousand Miles, a Vice Guild Leader of Miracle, sneered when he overheard Muxin’s mutterings from nearby. “It’s a pity she invited Zero Wing. This dream of hers will never come true.”

“Miles, you’ve gone too far this time. I only told you to instruct Elven Enchantress and the other three Guilds to suppress Zero Wing. Yet, you actually told them to annihilate Frost Heaven’s other helpers after eliminating Zero Wing!” Shredded Soul, Miracle’s First Vice Guild Leader, berated while shaking his head. “If Frost Heaven’s people find out about this, they’ll definitely create a lot of trouble for us in the future.”

“We’re going to have to reduce the other Guilds’ foreign aid count anyway. It doesn’t matter even if we have Frost Heaven suffer slightly greater losses. It’s Frost Heaven’s fault for seeking Zero Wing’s help, to begin with,” Thousand Miles countered contemptuously.

He bore a massive grudge against Zero Wing.

It was all because of Zero Wing that his status in the Guild had repeatedly fallen. He naturally wouldn’t let go of an opportunity to take revenge. In fact, to deal with Zero Wing, he had taken the initiative to persuade the Guild to partner with Saint’s Hand and collaborate with the three other Guilds to take action together.

At this time, Cold Shadow couldn’t help looking at the distant Muxin with sympathy from a corner of the hall.

“If not for Zero Wing, Frost Heaven wouldn’t have fallen into such a passive state,” Cold Shadow sighed ruefully.

Under normal circumstances, Muxin’s decision to recruit Shi Feng as foreign aid would’ve been a good one. Unfortunately, aside from being strong, Shi Feng also didn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. He had simply made far too many enemies. Otherwise, Miracle wouldn’t have decided to take action against Zero Wing so decisively, going as far as to ignore Frost Heaven’s influence.

While the various superpowers’ members were discussing excitedly, several flashes of light appeared above the central teleportation array. In the blink of an eye, 17 figures appeared before everyone’s eyes.

As the teleportation array’s brilliance dissipated, the appearance of these 17 figures became clear for all to see. They were none other than Zero Wing’s members, whom the various superpowers felt would fail the preliminary selection.

“How is this possible?”

“Aren’t they way too lucky? Did they not encounter any other foreign aid teams inside?”

For a time, the hall was in an uproar. None of the various superpowers’ members could believe their eyes. This was especially true for the Sky Dragon Family’s, Pride Empire’s, Demon Palace’s, and Miracle’s upper echelons. Every one of them gaped at this situation.

“Why are Zero Wing’s members still alive?” Thousand Miles was bewildered when he saw Shi Feng’s group walking out of the teleportation array.

At this moment, let alone Thousand Miles, even Shredded Soul and the distant Cold Shadow were puzzled by this situation. After all, nobody knew better than they did the situation inside the special space.

Those were 400 great experts they were talking about!

Of them, four were even peerless experts, and over a dozen were apex experts. With such a force, one could roam unhindered even in the Fire Dragon Empire. Taking care of Zero Wing should have been child’s play. Yet, Zero Wing actually exited the battlefield with zero casualties. How could they possibly bring themselves to believe this situation?

“Did those four Absolutes not go after them?”

No matter how Cold Shadow racked her brain, this was the only possibility she could think of for Zero Wing emerging unscathed.

Frost Heaven’s members were also surprised at this situation.

“They sure are lucky. They actually managed to come out unscathed even in such a situation.” When Brilliant Blue saw Shi Feng and the others, he shot a glance at Hong Xinyuan, then continued, “However, just returning alive is useless. In the end, it will still depend on whether they acquired any War God Orders!”

In Brilliant Blue’s opinion, Shi Feng’s group must’ve deliberately avoided the other foreign aid teams and did not fight any battles at all. Hence, they were able to return safely. Otherwise, with Zero Wing’s exposed data, there was no way the other foreign aid teams wouldn’t target Zero Wing’s members. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the end, the various participating superpowers present only treated the return of Zero Wing’s members as a small interlude. What they were really concerned about was the issue of how many foreign aid slots each of them would receive.

Everyone returned their attention to the teleportation array in the middle of the hall, waiting for someone else to return, so that they could inquire about the War God Orders’ distribution.

However, after Shi Feng’s group left the teleportation array, the various superpowers’ members were dumbfounded.The teleportation array that should’ve continued teleporting other people back to the War God’s Temple actually started disappearing

“What’s going on?”

“Why did the teleportation array stop teleporting people?”

“Could it be broken?”

Questions emerged in everyone’s mind one after another. None of them could figure out what was going on. The hall devolved into pandemonium because of this situation.

However, after a short while, the entire central hall fell into a deathly silence.

The line of text that appeared at the top of the stele rendered everyone in the hall speechless with shock.
