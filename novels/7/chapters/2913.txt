Chapter 2914 – Law Technique?

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Fire Dance, Cola, Violet Cloud, Yan Tianxing, and the other long-time members of Zero Wing felt an indescribable sense of relief and excitement.

“Guild Leader, our situation is terrible. The enemy’s airpower is too strong,” Fang Shihan said in a helpless tone as she pointed at the enemy’s Tier 5 commander and the 30-plus Flying Ships. “The fortress’s defensive magic array still needs more than ten minutes to recover. I’m afraid we won’t last that long.”

Although Shi Feng’s arrival meant that they had someone to hold back the enemy commander, they still had to contend with hundreds of Tier 4 NPCs and Flying Mountswhen their side had less than a hundred Tier 4 combatants. Although they had the fortress’s magic arrays’ support, which mitigated the effects of the Tier 5 NPCs’ Mana Domains and suppressed the enemy Tier 4 NPCs, they were still at an absolute disadvantage. Not to mention, the Steel Lion Fortress’s commander, the Level 200, Tier 4 Sky Knight Sepel, currently had less than 50% of his HP remaining. If not for the many Tier 3 and Tier 4 healers supporting him, he would’ve long since fallen to the 20-plus Level 180, Tier 4 NPCs ganging up on him.

“Relax.” After looking at Fang Shihan, Shi Feng turned to the Blue Thunder Flying Ship and smiled, saying, “If it’s airpower, we don’t lack any, either.”

“We don’t lack any?”

Fang Shihan glanced at the Blue Thunder Flying Ship and then turned to survey the enemy’s fleet of Flying Ships, her worries not easing in the slightest.

Naturally, she knew that a Mysterious-Iron Flying Ship was powerful and that it could go up against Tier 5 combatants. However, the enemy’s Tier 5 combatants were by no means weak.

Moreover, several dozen Tier 4 NPCs had constructed a summoning array some distance behind the enemy’s commander. A monster summoned by several dozen Tier 4 NPCs definitely wouldn’t be weak. There was even a high possibility it would be a Tier 5 Legendary monster.

No sooner had Fang Shihan finished speaking than those several dozen Tier 4 NPCs completed their incantations. A gigantic Bone Dragon then emerged from the summoning array, its 500-meter-long body matching the Blue Thunder Flying Ship in size. The Bone Dragon also had a wingspan of 1,000 meters.

When this Bone Dragon appeared and let loose a roar, the intense shockwave it generated made all the Tier 3 combatants on the battlefield feel lightheaded.

[Ancient Bone Dragon) (Undead, Legendary)

Level 180

HP 200,000,000,000

Upon seeing the Ancient Bone Dragon’s statistics, the players inside the Steel Lion Fortress gasped reflexively. Even the players spectating the battle through the Twin Towers Kingdom’s forums were dumbfounded, many people spitting out the drink in their mouth.

This was the first time any of the Twin Towers Kingdom’s players saw a Legendary monster’s statistics, and they all couldn’t help despairing. Even the Tier 4 players in the fortress revealed a bitter smile.

Setting aside the wide-range attacks the Bone Dragon could execute with its massive body, just its 200 billion HP was more than enough to make any Tier 4 player lose hope. After all, the Ancient Bone Dragon could recover 2% of its HP every five seconds due to its battle recovery. In other words, it could regenerate four billion HP every five seconds. Combined with its Tier 5 Defense, even a hundred Tier 4 players attacking with everything they had wouldn’t be enough to kill it.

“It’s...over...”

“We’re dead for sure this time...”

Many of the Tier 3 players in the Steel Lion Fortress lost their fighting spirit as they looked at the Ancient Bone Dragon in the sky.

Shi Feng’s arrival was indeed a huge help to them. However, along with his arrival, the enemy forces had become even stronger. Although Shi Feng was a Tier 5 Sword Saint, he couldn’t go up against one Tier 5 NPC and one Tier 5 Legendary monster simultaneously. Not to mention, the enemy’s Tier 5 commander was far from ordinary, clad in a complete set of Fragmented Legendary Set Equipment and even wielding a Legendary Greatsword. He was a top-ranking existence even among Tier 5 existences—and definitely not someone current Tier 5 players could contend with.

When Fang Shihan saw the Ancient Bone Dragon, her complexion also turned very ugly.

She had never imagined that the Outerworld NPCs could summon an actual Tier 5 Legendary monster. This Ancient Bone Dragon was much stronger than the Nine-headed World Snake the Outerworld players summoned previously.

The summoning array the Outerworld players had used was something similar to the Divine Beast’s Descent Magic Array. The monster summoned wasn’t an actual monster but a magical illusion. So long as one heavily damaged the summoning array, one would dispel the illusion.

It was a different story for actual summoned monsters. The only way to get rid of a summoned monster was by killing either the monster or the monster’s summoner. However, there was no specific summoner in a group summoning. Unless one killed all of the summoners involved, the summoned creature would remain, obedient to the summoners’ commands.

Before the Steel Lion Fortress’s players could overcome their despair, the Outerworld’s Tier 5 commander, Los Ferid, pointed at the Steel Lion Fortress and ordered, “Attack! Kill all of the natives!”

At Los Ferid’s command, the Ancient Bone Dragon, along with the 30-plus Advanced Flying Ships and six Bronze Flying Ships, began bombarding the Steel Lion Fortress.

The Ancient Bone Dragon used the Tier 5 Spell Hell Lotus and showered the Steel Lion Fortress with crimson flames so hot that they incinerated space itself. Meanwhile, the Flying Ships fired all their cannons, raining hundreds of destructive beams on the fortress.

Boom!

The resulting explosion was so devastating that it was audible even tens of thousands of yards away. The consequent shockwave ravaged the area within 3,000 yards of the fortress.

Upon seeing this attack, the Outerworld NPCs charging at the Steel Lion Fortress revealed joyous expressions. If the Steel Lion Fortress received such an attack without its defensive magic array, all of the fortress’s inhabitants would disappear without a trace.

However, when the smoke enveloping the fortress dissipated, the Outerworld NPCs suddenly fell silent.

How is this possible?!

The Outerworld’s Tier 3 NPCs stared at the sight before them with dumbfounded expressions. In fact, even the people inside the Steel Lion Fortress were stunned by this situation, their minds boggled.

Before anyone realized it, a gigantic magic barrier had formed around the Steel Lion Fortress and blocked all the attacks from the Flying Ships and the Ancient Bone Dragon. Let alone annihilating the fortress’s inhabitants, the Flying Ships and the Ancient Bone Dragon had even failed to scratch the fortress walls.

However, before anyone could snap out of their daze, the barrier enveloping the fortress suddenly disappeared. Six crystalline spheres the size of a small house then flew toward the Blue Thunder Flying Ship and hovered around

it.

“That Flying Ship created that barrier just now?”

“Are you kidding me?! Is that really a Flying Ship?! How can it stop a Legendary monster’s Tier 5 Spell?!” Be it the players or NPCs inside the Steel Lion Fortress, all of them currently had their mouths hanging wide open as they stared at the Blue Thunder Flying Ship. After all, the Flying Ship’s performance had shattered their notions of Flying Ships. The Blue Thunder Flying Ship’s defensive capabilities practically rivaled a Mobile Fortress’s!

At this time, even Fang Shihan, who knew the specifics of the situation, was rendered speechless. She had no idea that a Mysterious-Iron Flying Ship could be that strong.

Of those present, only Shi Feng found this situation normal.

The Gray Thunder Flying Ship might only be a Mysterious-Iron Flying Ship, but its technological content exceeded that of the average Mysterious-Iron Flying Ship. Its usage of Mana was particularly exceptional. If not for its inadequate materials and power source, it could easily become a Secret-Silver Flying Ship. “Now that you’re done attacking, it’s our turn now!” Pointing at the Outerworld’s NPC army, Shi Feng commanded, “Beat them up!”

Along with Shi Feng’s command, the Zero Wing members seated on the Blue Thunder Flying Ship eagerly revved up the engine’s output to maximum. Subsequently, the Flying Ship’s 40 Advanced Magic Elven Cannons, 12 Floating Crystal Cannons, and Thunder of Destruction main cannon fired at the enemy Flying Ships and Flying Mounts and the Ancient Bone Dragon simultaneously.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

For a moment, countless lightning arcs and beams of light filled the battlefield, making it seem as if the heavens were doling out divine retribution.

The Ancient Bone Dragon and Outerworld NPCs reacted quickly and activated Defensive Spells to protect themselves.

However, apart from the Ancient Bone Dragon’s defensive barrier, the defensive barriers conjured for the Flying Ships and Flying Mounts all shattered without exception. When the barrage ended, several dozen Flying Mounts crashed to the ground. The Advanced Flying Ships also suffered severe damage, their mobility plummeting significantly. With how much damage they took from just one bombardment, they would probably fall after another three or four.

As for the Bronze Flying Ships, although they didn’t take any serious damage, their armor’s durability still plummeted by a significant margin.

After the Blue Thunder Flying Ship ended its barrage, everyone on the battlefield turned to stare at it, petrified.

“This... This... Isn’t this thing a little too strong?!”

“So, this is Zero Wing’s trump card?”

The Steel Lion Fortress’s players found their minds stagnating as they took in the tattered state of the Outerworld army’s air units.

Just a moment ago, they were clearly at an overwhelming disadvantage in airpower. However, the Blue Thunder Flying Ship had instantly turned the tables with its arrival. This situation was simply unbelievable.

When Cola looked at the distant Blue Thunder Flying Ship, his eyes glowed and his mouth watered. He then turned to Shi Feng and asked, “Guild Leader, when can I buy one?”

Compared to Flying Mounts, traveling across the continent in the Blue Thunder Flying Ship would be a much more wonderful experience!

“You’ll get your chance eventually,” Shi Feng said, chuckling when he saw Cola’s excitement. “However, this thing needs ten people to pilot. It’s not something you can pilot alone.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Shi Feng finished speaking, the Zero Wing members present were all thrilled.

After all, based on Shi Feng’s words, the Guild would eventually sell the Blue Thunder Flying Ship to its members once the Flying Ship was available in larger numbers. This meant that all of them had an opportunity to own this steel behemoth. And even if they couldn’t ride it alone, they could simply form a team to do so.

However, shortly after Shi Feng finished speaking, the enemy commander, who had not taken any action thus far, suddenly turned to Shi Feng. At this time, though, the contempt in Los Ferid’s eyes had disappeared. There was even a faint smile on his face.

“You are an exceptional heaven-blessed individual,” Los Ferid said as he lifted his greatsword and rested it on his shoulder. Smiling, he asked, “May I know your name?”

“Black Flame,” Shi Feng replied calmly.

Although Black Flame wasn’t his real ID, he had long since gotten accustomed to using it. Moreover, the Outerworld knew of only Black Flame and not Ye Feng.

“Black Flame?” Los Ferid, who appeared to be in his 50s, nodded. He then earnestly introduced himself, “I am Los Ferid, the commander-in-chief of the God’s Domain Crusade Army’s 19th Corps and one of the Seventeen Stars of the Holy Grail. You are qualified to be my enemy!”

After Los Ferid finished speaking, the strength of his Mana Domain suddenly increased. Now, even the fortress’s magic arrays couldn’t nullify it.

The instant Los Ferid’s Mana Domain enveloped the Steel Lion Fortress, everyone inside the fortress felt their bodies become significantly heavier. Now, the fortress’s Tier 3 combatants even had difficulty lifting their heads. A scorching heat also blanketed their bodies as if they were standing in a burning hell.

Even Fire Dance, who had an eight-piece Epic Set Equipment equipped and wielded a Legendary Weapon, felt immense pressure on her body. She would be fortunate to exhibit even 60% of her usual combat power. And as a result of this suppression, she became even less of an opponent for the enemy’s Level 180, Tier 5 vanguard leader in front of her.

One of the Seventeen Stars of the Holy Grail? Shi Feng grew more cautious after hearing Los Ferid’s introduction.

Although he had never heard of the Seventeen Stars of the Holy Grail, God’s Domain had an official ranking list known as the Ten Saints, which represented the ten strongest combatants recognized by the War God’s Temple. Every one of these Ten Saints was rumored to have Demigod-level combat power.

Shi Feng guessed that Los Ferid was probably on par with the Ten Saints. Based on his observation of Los Ferid’s Mana Domain, he could tell that the other party had already mastered a World Law. The only thing holding the NPC back from reaching Tier 6 was his Concentration. Nevertheless, with a Legendary Weapon in hand, Los Ferid should be a powerhouse even among Demigods.

However, although Los Ferid possessed a powerful Mana Domain, it had no effect on Shi Feng whatsoever.

Immediately, Shi Feng unleashed his own Mana Domain, canceling out Los Ferid’s and even suppressing the NPC slightly.

“Let’s fight! Let me see how powerful you heaven-blessed individuals are!” Los Ferid said, his body suddenly splitting into more than a hundred doppelgangers that charged at Shi Feng from different directions.

Tier 5 Skill, Shadowlight Kill!

After activating Shadow Kill, Los Ferid spun and swung his greatsword. Tier 5 Skill, Great Holy Cross!

Tier 5 Skill, Draconic Stars!

Immediately, Los Ferid’s doppelgangers transformed into gigantic crosses that pierced through space. Each of these crosses then split and transformed into several dozen serpentine dragons.

Several thousand serpentine dragons flew toward Shi Feng, their large numbers making it impossible to dodge or block them all.

He combined three Tier 5 Skills?!

Fire Dance and the others were startled when they saw Los Ferid’s attack.

For true expert players, combining the effects of Skills was a must-learn technique. However, the higher the tier of the Skills, the more difficult combining them would be.

Currently, even Domain Realm experts like Fire Dance and Yan Tianxing could just barely combine two Tier 4 Skills. Yet, Los Ferid had combined three Tier 5 Skills. Los Ferid’s combat standard was simply unprecedented.

Every addition to a Skill combination would double the power of the combined attack. Los Ferid’s combined Tier 5 Skills could exhibit quadruple the power of a standard Tier 5 Skill. Moreover, Los Ferid was also wielding a Legendary Weapon. These two factors would probably deter even a Tier 5 Dragon from receiving Los Ferid’s attack.

Amazing!

When Shi Feng perceived the several thousand serpentine dragons flying toward him, he was awed. If this were before his fight with the Scholar, he would definitely rank Los Ferid number one when it came to the usage of Skills out of all the NPCs he knew.

However, while Los Ferid’s attack might seem unstoppable in the eyes of other players, that wasn’t the case for Shi Feng.

After Shi Feng’s Concentration reached the Tier 5 Peak standard, his brain’s processing speed had undergone another qualitative transformation. Previously, he could only increase his brain’s processing speed twofold. Now, he could increase it fourfold. This was also the part that made mental strength masters powerful.

Nonetheless, he still didn’t dare take the approaching serpentine dragons lightly. Immediately, he unsheathed the Light of Two Worlds and executed a horizontal slash.

Spatial Slash!

Sword’s Transmigration!

Shi Feng had gotten promoted to Tier 5 only recently, so he had hardly any Tier 5 Skills that could counter Los Ferid’s attack. His only option to offset this shortcoming was to rely on his weapons, equipment, and techniques.

The Light of Two Worlds was one of the Ten Great Legendary Weapons. It was among the strongest Legendary Weapons in existence, not something ordinary Legendary Weapons could hope to match.

The next moment, with Shi Feng as the center, a golden lotus bloomed on the battlefield, the petals of the lotus nullifying the energy making up the serpentine dragons. In the blink of an eye, the several thousand serpentine dragons vanished from the battlefield.

Upon seeing that his first attack had failed, Los Ferid immediately took a different approach and transformed into a streak of light shooting toward Shi Feng.

Tier 5 Skill, Shadowlight Steps!

Shadowlight Steps not only provided Los Ferid with a brief moment of invulnerability but also increased his attack speed and destructive power.

After appearing in front of Shi Feng and swinging his greatsword down at him, Los Ferid also let out a roar.

Tier 5 Skill, Voice of the Soul!

When activated, Voice of the Soul would stun all enemies within a radius of several hundred yards, causing their reaction speed to plummet. The Skill also dealt a heavy blow to their souls.

However, Los Ferid still wasn’t done, even after activating Voice of the Soul. He also activated World Strike, an Additional Skill that came with his greatsword. It allowed him to launch an attack at the Tier 6 Peak standard and had a one-hour Cooldown.

Even a Tier 6 existence would have to be wary of the combination of these three Skills, what more a Tier 5 player like Shi Feng.

However, as Los Ferid took action, Shi Feng activated Divine Steps and instantly swapped positions with a doppelganger located over a thousand yards away from him, dodging the NPC’s Voice of the Soul.

Unfortunately, as all 36 of his doppelgangers were still within range of Los Ferid’s World Strike, Shi Feng had no choice but to counter with World Breaker.

Boom!

An explosion took place in midair, and everyone on the battlefield gaped in shock when they saw the aftermath of the clash between Shi Feng and Los Ferid.

The sky above the Steel Lion Fortress had turned into a dark, empty void. Some of the Advanced and Bronze Flying Ships, unfortunate enough to be caught within this void, even turned to dust.

“That is a powerful sword you have there. Not only did it break my World Strike, but it even injured me,” Los Ferid exclaimed as he looked at the Light of Two Worlds in Shi Feng’s hand. The greatsword he wielded was top-tier even among Legendary Weapons. Yet, even after he activated his greatsword’s strongest Skill, his attack still lost to Shi Feng’s. This was simply unbelievable.

Although he lost less than 10% of his HP from the exchange, this was still an astonishing outcome. After all, ever since he equipped the Holy Star Set, he had never received so much damage from a single attack-until now.

Meanwhile, the players inside the fortress were dumbfounded by the outcome of the clash between Shi Feng and Los Ferid. In their opinion, this was no longer a battle between humans but a battle between Gods.

When Los Ferid executed his earlier attack, most of them already thought they would die. Fortunately, Shi Feng had shattered the attack. Otherwise, the Steel Lion Fortress would probably have disappeared from the Twin Towers Kingdom.

“You overpraise me.”

When Shi Feng saw that Los Ferid had received some damage, he immediately followed up on his small victory with Golden Soul, elevating his soul to the Tier 6 standard. He then swapped positions with the doppelganger closest to Los Ferid and swung the Light of Two Worlds at the NPC.

Holy Annihilation!

Now that Shi Feng’s Concentration was elevated to Tier 6 and he understood the true way to utilize the Law of Destruction, he executed Holy Annihilation with much greater proficiency than before. However, when executing this attack, Shi Feng didn’t use the Heavenly Blue Saint’s Destruction Magic Array. Instead, he tried using his own Mana to break the operations of the ambient Mana.

Originally, when Shi Feng’s Concentration was only at the Tier 5 Peak standard, accomplishing this feat would’ve been incredibly difficult. However, after activating Golden Soul, his control over and perception of Mana had undergone a qualitative transformation. This, in turn, reduced the difficulty of the challenge significantly, turning the impossible possible.

The next moment, the space Shi Feng’s sword passed through transformed into an empty void, the power of his attack having reached the Tier 6 Intermediate standard already.

“A Law Technique?”

Los Ferid was startled when he saw the destroyed space.

As someone who had already mastered a World Law, integrating the World Law into his swordsmanship was something he had always dreamed of. However, accomplishing this feat was simply too difficult, which was why even Demigods could normally only rely on Mana Techniques as a guide to make use of World Laws.

However, Shi Feng currently wasn’t relying on any magic arrays as a guide. He was making use of a World Law purely with his own strength.

The power one could exhibit this way was much greater than what one could exhibit by relying on a Mana Technique. This was because a Mana Technique was a fixed sword technique. If one had to rely on Mana Techniques to make use of World Laws, one could use only these specific Mana Techniques. However, if one could freely make use of a World Law, then regardless of what technique one used, all of one’s techniques would carry the power of the World Law. The difference in flexibility between the two was like heaven and earth.

Of course, the Law Technique Shi Feng currently displayed was extremely crude, and he could use only a small portion of the Law of Destruction’s power.

Nonetheless, Los Ferid dared not act recklessly against Shi Feng’s attack. He immediately swung his greatsword. Mana Technique, Burning Sea!

Boom!

When the two swords collided, a vast void and a sea of flames appeared in the sky once more. The terrifying shockwave the collision generated even obliterated the Tier 3 combatants nearby, while those standing farther away got sent flying. Subsequently, the clangor of swords clashing rang out in the sky time after time. Apart from some Tier 4 individuals with incredibly high Basic Attributes, everyone else dared not stay anywhere near Shi Feng and Los Ferid’s battle.

The clash between Shi Feng and Los Ferid continued for more than a minute, the deafening explosions numbing everyone’s mind. However, the more Shi Feng fought, the fiercer his attacks became. Despite Los Ferid doing his best to avoid a head-on clash, Shi Feng took the initiative to do the exact opposite. Shi Feng was relying on this intense life-and-death battle to familiarize himself with the process of breaking the operations of Mana.

As more time passed, Los Ferid gradually fell into a disadvantage, his HP decreasing continuously. Only after two minutes had gone by and the effect of Shi Feng’s Golden Soul disappeared did Los Ferid regain the upper hand. Nevertheless, Los Ferid still couldn’t put an end to the battle.

This was because even after losing the ability to use his Law Technique, Shi Feng could still rely on Holy Annihilation to use the Law of Destruction. Hence, he had no problem clashing with Los Ferid. Moreover, both of them had healers supporting them. Unless one of them made a fatal mistake, neither was unlikely to die.

In the meantime, the Blue Thunder Flying Ship was deeply entangled with the Ancient Bone Dragon. However, as the Blue Thunder Flying Ship had a lot of cannons, it managed to pin down the Ancient Bone Dragon while shooting down the enemy’s Flying Ships and Flying Mounts one after another.

When Los Ferid saw another Bronze Flying Ship crash to the ground, his eyes twitched involuntarily.

At this point, his army had already lost four Bronze Flying Ships and over 20 Advanced Flying Ships. The loss of Flying Mounts was even worse. These things were practically mobile targets in front of the Blue Thunder Flying Ship. And worse, the Steel Lion Fortress’s defensive barrier was gradually taking shape once more. Evidently, the fortress’s defensive magic array had already been fully reactivated.

After the Tier 5 vanguard leader repelled Fire Dance and saw that the fortress’s defensive barrier was re-forming, he looked toward Los Ferid and said, “Lord Ferid, we cannot continue like this. Once the defensive barrier is up again, we’ll be very passive.”

At the vanguard leader’s words, Los Ferid gritted his teeth and commanded, “Everyone, retreat!”

Obedient to Los Ferid’s command, the Outerworld’s NPC army, which only had around two million NPCs remaining, began an orderly retreat from the Steel Lion Fortress. Los Ferid, the vanguard leader, and the Ancient Bone Dragon served as the rearguard, preventing Shi Feng and the Blue Thunder Flying Ship from giving chase.

After the Outerworld NPCs opened a teleportation portal and left the battlefield, Los Ferid and the vanguard leader promptly retreated into the portal as well, leaving the Ancient Bone Dragon behind. The summoning array used to summon the Ancient Bone Dragon could keep it under control for only a certain period. After this period was over, the Ancient Bone Dragon would regain its freedom. Hence, they might as well leave it behind and have it pin down Shi Feng and the others.

Once the Outerworld’s NPC army retreated, Shi Feng and the others spent around 20 minutes killing the Ancient Bone Dragon. When the Level 180 Legendary monster died, Fire Dance and the others leveled up once. The monster’s death also awarded Zero Wing with one Fragmented Legendary Weapon, over a dozen Level 180 Epic Weapons and Equipment, and several dozen Legendary materials. Upon seeing the loot, the Tier 3 and Tier 4 players belonging to other Guilds couldn’t help growing envious.

Afterward, Shi Feng immediately rode the Blue Thunder Flying Ship to the Twin Towers Kingdom’s two other battlefronts.

The Redthorn Fortress’s and Thunder Gorge City’s situations were much better than the Steel Lion Fortress’s. This was especially true for Thunder Gorge City. Because Aqua Rose was now a Tier 5 Grand Wizard, the Outerworld NPC army that attacked Thunder Gorge City received a resounding defeat, similar to the army that attacked the Steel Lion Fortress. As for the Redthorn Fortress, although the defenders here suffered somewhat terrible losses, they still managed to repulse the enemy.

With the successful defense of these three strongholds, the Twin Towers Kingdom’s players exploded with joy.

Meanwhile, news of this astonishing outcome immediately spread across the entire continent, causing a sensation in God’s Domain.
