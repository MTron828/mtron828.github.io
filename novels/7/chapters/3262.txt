Chapter 3263 - Chapter 337 - Twin Goddesses' Debut!

Chapter 337 – Twin Goddesses’ Debut!

At the reminder of one of the players on the cliff, the other 30-plus experts raised their attentiveness.

“The Mutant’s HP has already fallen below 10%, Commander! Should we get ready to use our trump card now?” Lightning Chaser, who was attacking an ordinary Heroic Spirit on the side, anxiously whispered to Desolate Fury, who was blocking the attacks of the same Heroic Spirit with his shield.

“Let’s wait a little longer,” Desolate Fury said. When he saw that over 20 people were attacking the Mutated Heroic Spirit, a hint of anxiety also appeared in his eyes. “We’ll use it when the Mutant’s HP falls under 2%. We only have one chance. If we fail, we’ll really be leaving this Rookie Competition with nothing to show for our efforts.”

“But…the other parties…” Lightning Chaser said worriedly as he looked at the other parties nearby.

!!

The Mutated Heroic Spirit was incredibly powerful, and no individual party could defeat it. As a result, the various parties here had formed a tacit agreement to work together and not attack each other before the Mutated Heroic Spirit was taken down. Should any party violate this implicit agreement, the other parties would work together to eliminate the offending party.

However, this also meant that the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s death would signal the various parties to start attacking each other.

Currently, their party of two no longer had any hopes of competing for the top 20 spots. In fact, this was the case for 80% of the parties here. This meant that these parties would most likely leave the Rookie Competition empty-handed. Now that a Tier 4 Mutated Heroic Spirit had appeared before these parties, they would definitely use everything they could to secure its loot, just like how their party of two was prepared to use their strongest trump card.

However, if another party used its trump card first and secured the loot, there’d be nothing anyone could do about it. When players died in the Ancient River Secret Land’s central zone, only half of the Heroic Spirit Remnants they collected were guaranteed to drop. As for the other items they looted, there was only a chance that these items would drop on their death; it wasn’t a guaranteed drop.

Hence, the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s death became the key moment to snatch its loot.

The more precise they could time the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s death, the greater their chances of snatching its loot. If they took action too soon or too late, there was a high chance the other parties would hinder them.

Their party of two’s trump card was a Tier 5 Magic Scroll. It was even a magic scroll for Meltdown, the strongest single-target fire-attributed Tier 5 Spell.

One hit from this Spell could heavily injure even a Legendary monster.

However, nobody knew how much damage the Spell could do to a Tier 4 Mutated Heroic Spirit. After all, Mutants were extremely rare, and there was no data they could reference.

While Lightning Chaser and Desolate Fury were whispering, the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s HP fell steadily.

9%… 8%… 7%…

As the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s HP decreased, the tension among the various parties grew. Some parties holding back the ordinary Heroic Spirits had also started to move closer to the Mutated Heroic Spirit.

“Commander Mantra, Commander Silent, more than 50 people have gathered nearby already. Should we take action in advance?” Martial Quadbeast of the Iron Lion Kingdom whispered to Glorious Mantra and Silent Saintess after taking a look at the situation on the cliff.

“The Mutant’s HP is still too high. We can afford to wait until its HP is at 4%,” Glorious Mantra said. He had similarly noticed the increased number of experts on the cliff. However, he simply smiled and continued, “The other parties won’t expect us to work together. If the three of us act simultaneously, we can take away 4% of the Mutant’s HP instantly. Even if the other parties use their trump cards, they can, at most, take two or three percent of the Mutant’s HP.”

“That might be the case, but with so many people gathered here, can we really get away safely afterward?” Martial Quadbeast said as he glanced at some of the experts hiding in the surroundings. “If those people lose their minds and dump all their trump cards on us, there’s no way the three of us can survive.”

It was true that the three of them had combat power at the Tier 5 standard. Even the Titan Behemoth responsible for tanking the Mutated Heroic Spirit was his summoned beast. However, they would still be reduced to ashes in an instant if they were subjected to the various parties’ rampant bombardment.

It should be known that their goal wasn’t just to acquire the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s loot. They were also aiming to get into the Rookie Competition’s top 20. Hence, unlike the other parties, they couldn’t afford to die.

“Do not worry. My Silent Death will ensure nobody can stop us from escaping,” Silent Saintess said confidently.

“Silent Death?” Martial Quadbeast relaxed significantly when he heard Silent Saintess’s words.

Silent Death was a Tier 4 Super Spell that could put all enemies within a 500-yard radius into a Silenced state. In this state, not only would players be prohibited from using Skills and Spells, but they would also be prohibited from using any tools. In addition, targets affected by Silent Death would also have their reaction speed sharply reduced.

Moreover, unlike other Silencing Skills and Spells, Silent Death would not put the same restriction on the user or the user’s teammates. It would only restrict the user’s opponents. So, it was an incredibly rare and powerful Super Spell, and the Spell Book for it was far more valuable than even Fragmented Legendary items.

Although Silent Death came with a severe flaw in that it only had a short duration of six seconds, it was still a Super Spell that countless magical class players sought to learn. This was because six seconds was enough for an expert to do many things. It was even enough for an expert to kill a player multiple times. In addition, Silent Death did not require any chanting; it could be extended just like a Mana Domain.

When the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s HP fell to 5%, three figures suddenly broke out of the rank of players attacking the Mutant from range and approached the Mutant at flying speeds. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Who are those people?”

“How dare they take action at this time? Are they tired of living?”

When everyone saw the three figures approaching the Mutated Heroic Spirit, nobody bothered to stop them. Instead, everyone simply laughed as they looked at the three figures.

There were nearly 20 parties gathered here currently, but none of them were confident in instant-killing the Mutated Heroic Spirit when it had 5% of its HP remaining. So, if someone could step forward to shave off some of the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s HP for them, they’d be able to use their trump card to instantly kill the Mutant and get the best timing to snatch the Mutant’s loot.

As to what would happen to the three impatient players, they would definitely be bombarded into smithereens by the various parties’ trump cards.

“Attack!” shouted the male Swordsman standing in the lead suddenly shouted as the three figures arrived before the Mutated Heroic Spirit.

“He’s…Black Flame!”

“Why did they decide to act at this time?”

Many people recognized Black Flame’s appearance and couldn’t help but be confused as to why Black Flame would make a move so soon.

“Not good! Kill them!” Martial Quadbeast instinctively shouted when he saw Black Flame.

Other people might not know exactly how powerful the Asura Sword Emperor was, but Martial Quadbeast did. If it was Black Flame, the man might very well have a method to instantly shave off 5% of the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s HP.

“Too late!”

When Shi Feng saw the Mythic-ranked Titan Behemoth turning away from the Mutated Heroic Spirit to attack him, he simply ignored it and let its claw descend upon him.

When the Titan Behemoth’s claw was five yards from reaching Shi Feng, the two girls, who had been chanting and drawing divine runes beside Shi Feng all this time, suddenly raised the staves they wielded.

Immediately, 200 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal in Midsummer’s and Wu Xiaoxiao’s bags transformed into a stream of mana that flowed into the divine runes they drew.
