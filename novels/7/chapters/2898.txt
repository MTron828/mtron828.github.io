Chapter 2899 – Ancient God’s Legacy

When Shi Feng brought out the Ancient God’s Eye, he wasn’t the only one surprised by the item’s identity. Cold Shadow, who stood nearby, also widened her eyes in shock. She couldn’t help looking at Shi Feng, who had acquired this item, as if he was some kind of alien.

An Ancient God!

Ancient Gods were the oldest Gods in God’s Domain. They were existences that had come into being along with God’s Domain. The many Gods of later generations only managed to gain their strength because of the Legacies from these Ancient Gods.

However, after God’s Domain transitioned from the primordial era to the ancient era, Ancient Gods had suddenly disappeared from the world. In the modern era, barely any records mentioned Ancient Gods. However, according to those found in the modern era’s libraries, a large part of the reason humans managed to rise up during ancient times was the Ancient Gods’ Legacies, which allowed the human race to give birth to many Gods.

Although the rainbow crystal ball Shi Feng held was named an Ancient God’s Eye, it wasn’t actually an eyeball. Instead, it was an Ancient God’s Legacy.

It was a Legacy that could help players reach Tier 6!

It was much stronger than the Legacies of ordinary Gods!

No wonder that mysterious youth wanted to deal with the Fallen Archangel! Let alone a Tier 5 existence, even Tier 6 Gods would covet an Ancient God’s Eye. Realization dawned upon Shi Feng as he looked at the crystal ball he held.

(Ancient God’s Eye) (Divine Artifact Rank, Consumable)

This is a Legacy item left behind by an Ancient God. It records the Ancient God’s many Legacies. Each activation of the Ancient God’s Eye requires 1,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals. It can be activated up to nine times. Once the activation limit is reached, all information recorded within the Ancient God’s Eye will disappear. (Current usage count: 0)

Out of all the Legacies available in God’s Domain, an Ancient God’s Legacy belonged to the strongest category. If a player managed to grasp even a portion of the Legacy, becoming a Tier 6 God wouldn’t be difficult. If a player managed to grasp a significant portion, becoming a God was practically inevitable.

It was no exaggeration to say that this single Ancient God’s Eye was worth more than ten Legendary Weapons and the loss of the Dragon Summoning Flute.

However, Shi Feng quickly suppressed his excitement and turned his attention to the three other items he looted.

Although these three items were not as powerful as the Ancient God’s Eye, they still radiated incredibly potent Divine Might. Even Fire Dance felt pressured by them, what more the other Tier 4 players present.

That mysterious youth definitely won’t let me off the hook after this. Shi Feng chuckled when he saw the three other items’ identities.

All three items were extraordinary. Two were Inferior Divine Artifact ranked materials, and one was an Inferior Divine Artifact ranked Consumable. One of the two materials was even a Divine Power Source.

As for the Consumable, it was the Ancient God’s Blood, an item that could elevate a non-player creature’s Growth Potential and Life Rating. It was undoubtedly the most powerful enhancement item Shi Feng had ever seen in God’s Domain.

The total value of the four items Shi Feng got from killing the Fallen Archangel was something he couldn’t get even if he killed three or four Tier 6 Gods.

Shi Feng was also certain that these were all items that mysterious youth wanted. Now that he had acquired them instead, the mysterious youth would definitely take action against him at all costs.

After a brief silence fell in the hall, Fire Dance reported to Shi Feng, “Guild Leader, according to Liang Jing, the Outerworld’s NPC army has arrived on the eastern continent. Currently, it has split into six groups of over 30,000 Tier 4 NPCs and four million Tier 3 NPCs each. All of these NPCs are above Level 150. As we expected, one of these groups is marching toward the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom. At their current speed, it’ll only take them another three or four days to reach the Twin Towers Kingdom’s vicinity.

“In the case of the Outerworld superpowers, their forces have already gathered outside the Twin Towers Kingdom. They have even dispatched many scouting teams to invade the kingdom, and the kingdom’s forces have already clashed with these scouting teams. Although the two sides are at a stalemate now, it is only a matter of time before the kingdom’s side loses. “According to Melancholic’s investigations, Starlink and many other superpowers are offering excellent incentives to independent experts to have them head to the Dark Night Empire and the Black Dragon Empire. They plan to resist the Outerworld forces together with the two empires. Because of this, many independent experts have decided to abandon Twin Towers and Star-Moon.”

When Fire Dance finished speaking, Cold Shadow frowned and said, “How foolish these people are! Sticking with an empire’s defensive line might be a good choice, but abandoning all resistance in the various kingdoms will inflict a severe loss to the various kingdoms’ armies! All they’re doing is giving the Outerworld forces an advantage!”

Unlike for players, resurrection was a very troublesome process for NPCs. The Outerworld’s NPC army wasn’t endless, either. Hence, if players worked together to defend the various kingdoms, repelling the Outerworld forces was entirely possible. In the worst-case scenario, they could, at least, weaken the Outerworld forces. Abandoning the various kingdoms outright and choosing to fight a decisive battle at the defensive lines of empires was an absolutely foolish decision.

–

However, Shi Feng wasn’t too surprised by this situation. Calmly, he said, “This is normal. Although players can recover the levels they lose with a little effort, finding replacements for the weapons and equipment they lose is very difficult. Given a choice, they will naturally prefer a more stable battle. Not to mention, with Starlink and the other superpowers’ interference, it’s only natural for independent players to abandon resisting in kingdoms and choose to fight in empires instead.”

In his previous life, the most astonishing aspect of a war between countries wasn’t the number of player deaths. Instead, it was the weapons and equipment lost.

Many kingdoms and empires had suffered annihilation because the player forces in those countries had depleted their stockpile of weapons and equipment. As a result, the players of those countries became weaker and weaker as they fought. In the end, they could only watch their enemies annex their nations bit by bit until the country disappeared completely.

The current War of Worlds was a similar situation.

After realizing this fact, all Starlink and the various superpowers needed to do was put out appropriate bait, and the various independent players would automatically swarm to the bait.

“Guild Leader, how about I bring the main force to the Twin Towers Kingdom and participate in the battle there?” Cola suggested. “I refuse to believe that we can’t kill a bunch of scouting teams! So long as we secure a few victories, I believe many players will be willing to stay and fight with us!”

Although Cola didn’t understand much about battles on the scale of countries, he knew that without the support of a large number of independent players, the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom would fall to the Outerworld forces.

The reason many independent experts were abandoning the two kingdoms was simply their belief that defending against the Outerworld forces in an empire would be easier.

Meanwhile, all Zero Wing needed to do was suppress and repel the Outerworld players plaguing the Twin Towers Kingdom. Then, the independent players who had left would see hope for successfully defending the kingdom. Once that happened, they would definitely return to help in the kingdom’s defense. After all, abandoning one’s roots and restarting development in a foreign country wasn’t easy.

“That won’t be necessary.” Shi Feng shook his head. Smiling calmly, he said, “Dealing with those scouting teams will only be a waste of time. If we’re going to do something, we should go for something bigger!” “Bigger?” Cola parroted in confusion.

“Fire, bring a team and look into the Twin Towers Kingdom’s current situation. Make sure to find the base camp of the Outerworld players invading the Twin Towers Kingdom. Once you do, notify me immediately!” Shi Feng instructed.

When Cold Shadow heard Shi Feng’s words, she turned to Shi Feng with a stunned look. “Guild Leader, are you thinking of...wiping them out?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Nodding, Shi Feng said earnestly, “Of course. If Starlink and the other superpowers want to waste their time, let them. However, Zero Wing doesn’t have that much time to waste.”

The real role of high-end combatants wasn’t in defending strongholds but attacking the enemy’s core combatants.

In his previous life, any player force that dared to gather their troops into one big army was simply asking for death!

However, be it the eastern continent’s players or the Outerworld’s players, neither had a clear understanding of truly large-scale battles in God’s Domain yet. They were still acting as if they were playing traditional virtual reality games, entirely ignorant of just how much power a single individual could wield!

“I’ll head out right away.” Fire Dance grew excited at Shi Feng’s affirmation.

After saying so, Fire Dance activated a Guild Transfer Scroll and teleported to the Guild Residence at Sky Spring City. As for everyone else present, Shi Feng had them take a break and dismissed them. After all, their continuous battles in the Evil God’s Secret Land had taken a huge toll on their minds and bodies.

After settling his affairs here, Shi Feng made his way to the City Lord’s Mansion’s secret room to rest and recuperate.

Shi Feng had exhausted his Concentration during his fight with the mysterious youth. Now, even his soul was in a weakened state. To recover quickly, he had to rest in the City Lord’s Mansion’s underground secret room, which held the densest Mana in Ancient Rock City.

This environment should be enough. Now, all I need to do is recover my Concentration.

After setting up a simple Mana Gathering Magic Array, Shi Feng took out a Crystal of Souls from his bag and ate it. Immediately, a wave of comfort spread across his soul.

Once his soul had fully recovered, Shi Feng fished the Ancient God’s Eye from his bag. He then took out 1,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals from his dwindling stockpile and injected them into the Ancient God’s Eye.

During his fight with the mysterious youth, Shi Feng had come to understand just how feeble he was.

Now that Shi Feng had the threat of the mysterious youth and the Outerworld forces looming over him, it was best if he increased his strength as quickly as possible. Hence, he did not intend to strengthen himself before receiving the Legacy Guidance in the Ancient God’s Eye. Instead, he would inherit it now to maximize his current strengths.

After Shi Feng injected the 1,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals, the Ancient God’s Eye suddenly released purple fumes, which gradually seeped into his body and merged with his soul.

The moment his soul came into contact with the purple fumes, Shi Feng suffered a splitting headache, and an unprecedented heat spread throughout his body. He felt as if someone was trying to cram an endless amount of knowledge into his brain, and his brain was working overtime and heating up as it tried to process all this information.

This sensation lasted for several minutes before it gradually dissipated.

When all of the purple fumes from the Ancient God’s Eye had merged with Shi Feng’s soul, the Legacy Guidance finally ended.
