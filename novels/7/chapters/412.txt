Chapter 413 - White Fog Canyon

As Shi Feng marked locations on the system map, more players continued to arrive at White Fog Canyon.

When Shi Feng had arrived, he had changed his appearance to Black Flame. As a result, he received an extraordinary amount of attention.

“Wow! Isn’t that Guild Leader Black Flame?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“He’s so powerful! Just looking at him makes my heart pound! It would be great if I could become friends with him!”

“Why don’t you look in the mirror first? Guild Leader Black Flame is the number one expert in Star-Moon Kingdom. Meeting him alone is a rare chance, much less becoming friends with him.”

“Sure enough, One-hit Asura is here as well. Things in the White Fog Canyon will be more interesting now.”

“No duh. Overwhelming Smile’s influence in White River City continues to grow. If Zero Wing fails to achieve anything in the competition over White Fog Canyon, it will become the laughingstock of White River City.”

“However, Overwhelming Smile has dispatched an impressive army of players. Look; even Overwhelming Smile’s Branch Leader, Lone Tyrant, has shown up. A huge war is going to break out over the canyon. I hurried here specifically to watch this war unfold.”

Upon seeing Shi Feng, many players began to discuss Zero Wing and Overwhelming Smile.

Currently, the atmosphere surrounding White River City grew increasingly tense with each passing day. Despite Overwhelming Smile’s clear attempts to suppress Zero Wing, it had not acted directly. Thus far, it had only employed various plots to poach the members of Zero Wing. It was as if Overwhelming Smile was dead set on stealing every single member from Zero Wing. Meanwhile, Shi Feng’s Guild showed no signs of taking action. The Guild had only declared that all members who withdrew from Zero Wing were permanently barred from joining the Guild again in the future. At the same time, Zero Wing also lowered their recruitment criteria.

Both sides appeared strangely calm as they maintained a delicate balance. No one knew what these Guilds were thinking.

There was a faint feeling of a storm brewing behind the scenes.

Now that these Guilds had gathered in the White Fog Canyon, they were both on high-alert for each other.

When Lone Tyrant saw Shi Feng, his eyes turned bloodshot as killing intent radiated from his body. He glared at Shi Feng as if the man was his greatest enemy.

Any expert could feel Lone Tyrant’s killing intent. Naturally, Shi Feng was no exception.

“Guild Leader, it seems that Lone Tyrant’s hatred for you is quite intense. Despite the fact that you’ve killed him several times, he refuses to learn his lesson,” Aqua Rose giggled.

“He can only act this rampant because he has Overwhelming Smile backing him. Why don’t we head over and kill him again? We can use this chance to massacre Overwhelming Smile and relieve some stress,” Blackie snarled.

Fire Dance stepped forward and said, “I alone will be enough to kill him.”

Shi Feng, who had busied himself with the system map all this time, simply smiled and said, “Ignore him. We have more important matters to tend to. Fire Dance, you, especially, have much to do.”

Shi Feng thought little of Lone Tyrant. The one Shi Feng was truly worried about was the Overwhelming Smile branch based in Maple City and the several surrounding cities controlled by Underworld.

At this moment, a graceful and quiet woman standing beside Lone Tyrant softly reminded him, “Brother Tyrant, we have not come here to wage war with Zero Wing. Don’t forget our goal.”

Listening to this woman’s words, Lone Tyrant shot Shi Feng a glare before turning to enter the White Fog Canyon.

The graceful woman then looked at Shi Feng and the others, sending them a faint smile before she followed after Lone Tyrant and led the army of over 6,000 players into the White Fog Canyon.

I remember seeing that woman the last time I killed South Wolf. I think she was called Youlan? For Lone Tyrant act so subserviently, it seems that her status is quite high. Naturally, Shi Feng noticed the woman who had smiled at them, uncertainty filling his gaze.

Shi Feng had only paid attention to Youlan because of his intuition. He could feel an indescribable sense of danger from the woman.

Yet, after using Omniscient Eyes to inspect Youlan, Shi Feng discovered that the woman was merely a Level 24 Tier 0 Summoner. There was nothing special about her at all. Shi Feng began to doubt his intuition.

After Overwhelming Smile entered the canyon, the other Guilds promptly followed. Only Shi Feng and the others lingered at the entrance.

“Guild Leader, Overwhelming Smile, Emperor’s Light, and Assassin’s Alliance have already entered. Are we not going in yet?” Aqua Rose asked as she watched Guild after Guild enter the White Fog Canyon.

“In a moment. I’ll be done soon,” Shi Feng leisurely responded.

White Fog Canyon was a Level 20 to Level 30 grinding area. Or rather, it had been originally. However, after the meteorite shower, the monsters inside had gone Berserk and had become far more difficult to deal with. At the very least, the White Fog Canyon was no longer suitable for ordinary players around Level 20.

When in a Berserk state, monsters’ damage and Attack Speed would increase by a minimum of 30%. With this increase, a Common monster would possess the combat power of an Elite monster and so on.

However, this was only the beginning.

As time passed, the monsters within White Fog Canyon would also grow stronger and more numerous. Soon, even the weakest monsters inside the canyon would become Elites, while a majority of the monsters would be Special Elites. There would also be quite a number of Chieftains and Lords.

Moreover, all these monsters would have also entered a Berserk state...

Just thinking about this gave one goosebumps.

Based on how long it had been since the meteorite shower, Shi Feng could say with certainty that there were no longer any Common monsters inside White Fog Canyon. At the very minimum, the monsters inside the canyon would be Elites. Moreover, the monsters would move in groups and respawn very quickly. There would also be many danger spots inside the canyon.

Meanwhile, the core area of the White Fog Canyon spoke for itself. The results of rushing in unprepared were obvious.

Currently, the baseline for entering White Fog Canyon was Level 20 Tier 1 or around Level 30 Tier 0.

Although players could improve their chances by going in with larger numbers, this canyon was still significantly dangerous.

Therefore, Shi Feng had sketched out a new map of the White Fog Canyon based on his memories of the past. On the new map, he had made sure to indicate locations that they needed to avoid. He had also marked a few mining spots and danger spots.

Although it was a time-consuming task, this new map would undeniably reduce the losses his Guild members suffered.

The minutes crawled by.

While Shi Feng was busy trying to recall the White Fog Canyon, over a dozen minutes had passed since the crowd of independent players and Guilds had entered White Fog Canyon.

Suddenly, the members of Zero Wing, who had waited silently at the canyon’s entrance, noticed many players exiting the canyon. These players looked pitiful. They left in parties of twos and threes; not a single complete party passed the watching Zero Wing players.

Unable to contain his curiosity, Blackie walked over and asked, “What happened to you guys? It’s only been around 10 minutes since you went in. How did you guys end up in such sorry states so quickly?”

These players had relatively powerful equipment. They were fully geared in Bronze Equipment at the very minimum. Logically, a party of such caliber should not have any issues dealing with a Level 22 or 23 Special Elite. Yet, all of these parties had lost at least half of their members...

“What do you know? The monsters inside White Fog Canyon are all Berserk Elites. Even our Level 21 Shield Warrior could only take a dozen hits at most. Facing one was hard enough. Yet, for some reason, the monsters in there move in groups of three at least. They also have a massive aggro range, so they are easy to pull. Many had party-wiped, and we only managed to escape after much difficulty. We’ve decided to level elsewhere until we hit Level 25 at least.,” a Level 21 veteran player replied, sighing. At this moment, his heart still trembled when he thought back to those groups of Elite monsters.
