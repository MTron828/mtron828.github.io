Chapter 3807 - 881 - Difference Between the Two Worlds?

Nightmare Holy City:

Three days after signing the agreement with Kowloon Demon, Shi Feng arrived at Nightmare Holy City’s airport with his party. Joining them were the Pale Horn adventurer team’s commander, Whirlwind Bulwark, and vice commander, Star Butterfly.

At this time, Kowloon Demon was already waiting outside the crowded airport with a 100-man team.

The presence of Kowloon Demon’s team caused a commotion among the players in the airport. This was because every member of the team was Level 240 or above. Additionally, they all had incredible equipment standards. Nobody in the current Nightmare Holy City owned a Level 240 Taboo Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set, yet every member of this 100-man team was equipped with a Level 240 Taboo Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set at minimum.

The woman standing at the head of this team was especially eye-catching. She had a divine pattern between her eyebrows, and her graceful body stood over two meters. Most importantly, she was a Level 243 Guardian Knight equipped with a Level 240 Taboo Legendary Equipment Set.

“Crap! Who are these people? Even the Holy Knights and the White Dragon Nation combined can’t come up with such a line-up!”

“Shush! Keep it down! Don’t you see they’re with Kowloon Demon? It seems the rumors of Kowloon Demon having extraordinary origins are true after all.”

“Don’t you guys recognize that Guardian Knight? She’s been hosting the city’s cross-region trial for the past few years. When the Guild Leaders of the Holy Knights and the White Dragon Nation first met her, they nearly fell to their knees.”

“Could these people be the successful challengers of other regions?”

The players in the airport quietly discussed Kowloon Demon’s team. The players who had challenged the cross-region trial, in particular, couldn’t help their awe and envy of the youths led by the female Guardian Knight.

It was the dream of all players in Nightmare Holy City to pass the cross-region trial. However, only a handful of players had ever succeeded, and they were all legends in Nightmare Holy City. Furthermore, according to rumors, only a small fraction of the players who passed the cross-region trial had been eligible to join the power the female Guardian Knight belonged to. Thus, it was only natural that the youths on the same team as the female Guardian Knight were objects of envy.

When Dragon’s Crown’s chosen ones overheard the discussions around them, they couldn’t help feeling proud and delighted.

Dragon’s Crown was a Guild that all players in this world sought to join. Meanwhile, not only were they members of Dragon’s Crown, but they were also the Guild’s carefully selected chosen ones. After constant training, their strength had skyrocketed, and each of them was now strong enough to overshadow an entire city region’s powers.

Meanwhile, Kowloon Demon noticed the arrival of Shi Feng’s team and said to the female Guardian Knight beside him, “Big Sis Jade, they’re here.”

Following Kowloon Demon’s words, the Dragon’s Crown members immediately turned their attention to Shi Feng’s team, their gazes filled with displeasure and mild hostility.

As chosen ones training under Purgatory Jade, Dragon’s Crown’s Second Vice Guild Leader, not even the Guild’s Elders were qualified to demand their help with raiding Bosses, let alone a bunch of outsiders. Yet, Purgatory Jade had agreed to let them help these outsiders. Kowloon Demon, Dragon’s Crown’s strongest chosen one, even expressed worship toward Shi Feng.

Moreover, even though they were contributing most of the manpower for the upcoming raid, they would receive only half of the Taboo Boss’s loot. This situation displeased them greatly. They couldn’t understand why Shi Feng’s party warranted such treatment.

Meanwhile, under the resentful gazes of Dragon’s Crown’s chosen ones, Shi Feng calmly approached Kowloon Demon. As for Whirlwind Bulwark and Star Butterfly, they had become so anxious that they didn’t even dare to raise their heads in front of Dragon’s Crown’s team. Initially, they were already very surprised when Shi Feng invited them to raid the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss together. They hadn’t expected to be on the same team with individuals whom even Nightmare Holy City’s top two Guilds had to kowtow to.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, let me introduce you. This person here is Purgatory Jade, the commander of the trump card team behind me. She has trained every member of this team,” Kowloon Demon said. “Additionally, Commander Jade is very experienced in raiding Taboo Bosses. Her team nearly killed a Level 240 Taboo Boss in the past. It’s a pity that the Taboo Boss escaped at the last moment.”

“She nearly killed a Level 240 Taboo?” Shi Feng looked at the Guardian Knight named Purgatory Jade in surprise.

Simply surviving against a Taboo Boss was a challenge. In the current Greater God’s Domain, no team could push a Level 240 Taboo Boss to the brink of death.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Rest assured, I won’t steal command over the raid from you. I am only here to see if you are as strong as Kowloon Demon says,” Purgatory Jade said as she scrutinized Shi Feng. Although she didn’t show it on her face, she felt slightly disappointed when she saw that Shi Feng was only Level 216. “But let me be upfront. If I feel your instructions might cause my team to suffer a true death, I will have them retreat without hesitation. Don’t blame us when that happens.”

According to Kowloon Demon, Shi Feng and his party came from a foreign world with exceptional weapons and equipment. Even the legendary Fragmented Divine Artifacts and Divine Artifacts existed in this world. Moreover, despite not being a sixth-floor expert, Shi Feng had managed to overpower Kowloon Demon by a slight margin. Furthermore, Shi Feng intended to form a team to raid a Taboo Boss. Even if said Taboo Boss was under Level 240, killing it would still be a significant challenge.

This was also why Purgatory Jade had gone out of her way to come here. However, the low levels of Shi Feng’s team disappointed her. Even Whirlwind Bulwark, the highest-level member of the team, was only Level 239. As for Red Frost, Laura, Twilight Leaf, and Heiser, they were only Level 230. Purgatory Jade felt there was nothing special about the foreign world Kowloon Demon spoke of, aside from its extraordinary weapons and equipment.

“Okay. Let’s set out immediately, then,” Shi Feng said, nodding. Then, he took out the Ancient Oath and summoned the Frostflame Sacred Dragon.

Suddenly, a giant magic array appeared in the sky, covering the entire airport. Immediately afterward, a 1,000-meter-long, Level 226 Dragon slowly descended from the sky like a sovereign, radiating a powerful Dragon Might that struck fear into the hearts of the Tier 6 players in the airport. Even an expert as strong as Kowloon Demon felt greatly pressured.

“A Sacred Dragon?”
