Chapter 420 – You Call This a Bottom-Ranked Swordsman?

…

TL Notes:

Correcting “Holy Realm” to “Holy World.”

…

When Shi Feng swung the Winter of Eternal Night, all mana within a 1,000-yard radius began swarming toward Shi Feng. The shift in the ambient mana was so significant that it could even be felt from several blocks away.

“What a powerful mana surge. What is going on over there?”

“A mana surge of such scale… Could a World Boss have respawned?”

…

When the exploration parties operating in the several neighboring streets sensed the restless mana around them, fear and curiosity filled their hearts.

The Holy World’s mana was extraordinarily dense. It was so dense that even Tier 4 Great Wizards were incapable of influencing the Holy World’s ambient mana in the slightest. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Typically, only Tier 5 World Bosses could influence the Holy World’s ambient mana. But even then, their influence could only extend up to several hundred yards away from themselves.

Right now, though, they could clearly tell that the mana surge they were sensing originated from several blocks away. Whatever was causing this mana surge must be significantly stronger than any of the Tier 5 World Bosses they knew.

It should be known that the Holy World’s Tier 5 World Bosses were natural disasters. Even when the various conglomerates banded together, they would still have great difficulty taking down a Tier 5 World Boss. Typically, it would take an entire Saint Camp’s strength to raid a Tier 5 World Boss.

…

Unlike the exploration teams in the neighboring streets, the Heavenly God Corporation’s and the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s team members were currently standing in the middle of the mana surge, and they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded by what they saw.

“What’s happening?”

“This… Who is that person?”

When Flint and the white-haired old man looked to the center of the mana surge, they were shocked to find a person standing there.

At this time, even though the person in question was doing nothing but holding up the longsword he wielded, all mana within a 1,000-yard radius gathered around the weapon to form a gigantic sword of mana.

The gigantic sword was roughly one hundred meters in length. Not only did it look like it had substance, but it also radiated an aura that caused the Holy World’s stable space to shake wildly.

Meanwhile, whether it was Flint or the white-haired old man, both had seen a similar phenomenon before.

“A Saint!”

…

He’s a Saint?!

Ghost Hand and his subordinates were utterly dumbfounded as they looked at Shi Feng.

A Saint!

If there was anyone who could influence the Holy World’s mana on such a large scale, they would have to be Saints.

Saints were individuals who had reached the extreme in one aspect of the World Laws. As a result, they possessed extraordinary control over mana, and even the Holy World’s unbelievably dense mana could not resist their control.

Previously, the reason everyone was shocked by Hidden Wind’s ability to influence the Holy World’s ambient mana wasn’t just because it was a rare sight to see someone accomplishing such a feat in the Holy World. A bigger part of the reason was that they felt Hidden Wind was already close to reaching the realm of Saints.

Before Ghost Hand and his subordinates could recover from their shock, the gigantic sword started to cut apart space as it descended toward them.

Although the gigantic sword looked clumsy, the speed of its descent was as if Shi Feng was swinging a normal-sized longsword. As a result, it was nigh impossible for Ghost Hand and his subordinates to move out of the gigantic sword’s range in time, and all they could do was try to block the attack.

Boom!

Following an explosion, a fissure several dozen meters deep and over a thousand meters long formed on the street. Meanwhile, Ghost Hand and his subordinates were nowhere to be seen. Not even their ashes remained after the attack, let alone their corpses.

They’re gone, just like that?

Cheng Xin couldn’t believe her eyes as she looked at the gigantic fissure that had just formed.

Although Ghost Hand had never entered the Luminous Glory List, he was still one of the few fifth-floor experts in God’s Domain. In addition, he was already on par with Tier 5 experts regarding Basic Attributes. As a result, even Cheng Xin, someone ranked 326th on the Luminous Glory List, would need time to kill Ghost Hand.

Previously, when Cheng Xin heard rumors mentioning that Shi Feng had slain Ghost Hand in one move, she felt that those rumors were overly exaggerated. Now, though, she no longer thought as such. On the contrary, she felt that Shi Feng’s strength was much more ridiculous than how the rumors described him.

Not only did Shi Feng just kill Ghost Hand in one move, but he also killed three pseudo-fifth-floor experts using the same attack. The might of Shi Feng’s attack was stronger than even Hidden Wind’s Crashing Moon, and it vaguely touched on the Tier 6 standard already.

How was this supposed to be someone ranked 963rd on the Luminous Glory List?

…

“Incredible!” A moment after Shi Feng killed Ghost Hand and his subordinates, Hidden Wind suddenly appeared before him with an excited look on his face. “I didn’t think the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate could recruit the help of a Saint! Now, let me see just how powerful you Saints actually are!”

As soon as Hidden Wind finished speaking, he promptly thrust his bladeless sword at Shi Feng, executing one of his Exclusive Absolute Techniques.

Different from Crashing Moon, the technique Hidden Wind used this time was like the wind; swift and erratic. It was a stark contrast to Crashing Moon, which relied on brute force to overwhelm his opponent.

In the blink of an eye, Hidden Wind had executed over a hundred thrusts, giving Shi Feng no opportunities to execute the attack he used against Ghost Hand.

…

“It looks like Hidden Wind is being very cautious.”

“Can you blame him? He’s going up against a Saint. Any Saint can easily rank within the Luminous Glory List’s top 30, while Hidden Wind only came in 42nd a few months ago. Although he has made some significant improvements after entering the Holy World, whether he can defeat a Saint remains to be seen.”

When everyone saw Hidden Wind using a different Exclusive Absolute Technique, some felt that Hidden Wind was being overly cautious, while some eagerly looked forward to the outcome of the two’s battle.

The attack Shi Feng previously used against Ghost Hand had a relatively long preparation time but mind-blowing power. It also had a large range, making it impossible to dodge.

However, the technique Hidden Wind was currently executing was a perfect counter to Shi Feng’s attack. So long as Shi Feng dared to use the same attack, Hidden Wind would instantly turn him into a beehive with his rapid and unpredictable attacks.

…

When Shi Feng saw the numerous rapid attacks with constantly changing trajectories, he did not choose to use Lightshadow as he did against Ghost Hand. Instead, he leaped into the air and executed a horizontal sweep in Hidden Wind’s direction with the Winter of Eternal Night.

Third Sword, Holy Annihilation!

When Shi Feng first arrived in the Holy World, he was incapable of manipulating the Holy World’s ambient mana in the slightest.

However, after becoming a Divine Engraver and reaching the Extrasensory Realm, he understood how he could manipulate the Holy World’s rich mana, which let him evolve the way he manipulated mana from two to three dimensions. This, in turn, allowed him to improve his Mana Technique qualitatively. Originally, the effects of his Mana Techniques were only at the Tier 4 standard. Now, he could exhibit effects at the Tier 5 standard.

Hence, although he had yet to reach the realm of Saints in general, the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique he executed had already reached it.
