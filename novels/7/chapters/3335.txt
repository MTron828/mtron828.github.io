The scene that took place following Ghost Hand’s disappearance left everyone shocked.

In the blink of an eye, the buildings lining the dilapidated street had become riddled with holes. Then, a moment later, these buildings were reduced to dust and scattered in the wind.

However, rather than the level of destruction Ghost Hand caused, what terrified everyone, even more, was the fact that they couldn’t perceive any of his attacks. It was to a point where their minds failed to sense any danger despite witnessing the destruction that had just taken place.

Is this the true strength of a fifth-floor expert?

Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury were stupefied when they saw the weathering phenomenon before them.

All three of them were experts who had experienced many great battles in the Greater God’s Domain. However, whether they were going up against ferocious monsters or experts with long-standing fame, they could always more or less perceive danger when clashing with their opponents. Some of these opponents could even instill fear into them.

Meanwhile, any experienced expert would know that the sense of danger and fear one felt was the mind’s self-protection mechanism doing its job to make one aware that someone or something was a threat to their life.

However, even though the weathering phenomenon before them was clearly a grave threat to them, their minds failed to show any reactions to it. It was as if they were currently witnessing a normal event, such as the sun rising from the east, and their minds didn’t think it was necessary to give them any warnings.

Realizing this, Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury felt their scalps going numb.

In the Greater God’s Domain, battles between Tier 4 experts and above usually occur at speeds that the naked eye could not keep up with. As a result, experts at Tier 4 and above would need to rely on their body’s other senses to form an instinctive coping mechanism against them. Only by doing so could they keep up with high-speed battles that were too fast for the naked eye to follow.

However, if none of their senses could perceive anything…

Just thinking about the consequences terrified them.

This would be no different from an opponent having already run a sword through their hearts while they were still under the assumption that the opponent had yet to make a move.

How were they supposed to fight against such an opponent?

Subsequently, the weathering phenomenon could be seen converging on Shi Feng’s location. However, even though they could see the dilapidated street disintegrating, they still couldn’t perceive what was causing it.

What a powerful Exclusive Absolute Technique! He is indeed brilliant to be able to modify Star Rain to such an extent.

Shi Feng couldn’t help but admire Ghost Hand as he looked at the disintegrating street and buildings around him.

The Ninth Absolute Technique, Star Rain, was a combat technique that utilized an extraordinarily high attack frequency to overwhelm the opponent’s nervous response system. Meanwhile, Ghost Hand improved this technique by making all of his attacks invisible. Or, more accurately, impossible for others to perceive. Ghost Hand’s attacks were not only visually undetectable, they also could not be detected by any of the body’s other senses.

Without having mastered Star Rain to an incredible degree, it would be impossible to manipulate Star Rain to such an extent.

Meanwhile, when going against such an Exclusive Absolute Technique, even experts ranked at the bottom of the Luminous Glory List would be killed instantly without adequate countermeasures.

It’s a pity this move is useless against me.

Shi Feng grinned as he raised the Winter of Eternal Night.

World of Frost!

Nine frost swords could be seen flying to a distant building that was over ten stories tall.

Immediately afterward, the sound of metal clashing came from the building. Then, Ghost Hand could be seen flying out of the building with the Thorn of Sins returning to its original longsword appearance in his hand.

The spectators present fell into silence upon seeing this. This development especially dumbfounded Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury.

“You saw through my technique?!”

Ghost Hand was in disbelief as he looked at Shi Feng’s distant figure.

Ghost Hand was confident nobody could perceive him while he was under Stealth, much less see through his Exclusive Absolute Technique. After all, he had previously relied on the combination of these two things to kill a fifth-floor expert and qualify for the Luminous Glory List. Yet, even though Shi Feng clearly wasn’t a fifth-floor expert, Shi Feng had not only seen through his technique but also pinpointed his location.

“It’s nothing to be surprised about,” Shi Feng said as he looked at Ghost Hand. “Your technique might be powerful, but it also has obvious flaws. Star Rain prides itself in having a high attack frequency. If you want to erase the presence of all those attacks, you will have to invest a lot of time and energy into the endeavor. That means you will likely be stationary and susceptible to attacks while executing your technique. In that case, so long as I can find your location and attack you, you’ll have no choice but to stop your technique.”

Ghost Hand did not refute Shi Feng’s words. This was because he had a very clear understanding of his Exclusive Absolute Technique, Omnirain, and that included its weaknesses.

However, while Shi Feng’s explanation of how he disrupted his technique might sound simple, finding him while he was under Stealth was not a simple task. In fact, it should be impossible for a fourth-floor expert like Shi Feng. For fourth-floor experts, the only reliable way to disrupt him while he was executing Omni Rain was by bombarding the area with large-scale destruction Spells.

Yet, Shi Feng spoke as if he knew his whereabouts. Actually, that had to be the case since Shi Feng had accurately launched attacks at him. This was simply unbelievable.

“Although I don’t know how you managed to locate my presence, it doesn’t change the fact that you still aren’t a fifth-floor expert.” After taking a deep breath, Ghost Hand looked at Shi Feng with a sneer. “If Omni Rain doesn’t work against you, what about the actual Star Rain? How many times will you be able to block it?”

After saying so, Ghost Hand began brandishing the Thorn of Sins and sending numerous sword lights raining down on Shi Feng from all directions.

One second… Ten seconds… Thirty seconds…

Unlike when Ghost Hand executed Star Rain against Cross, he did not stop executing the technique against Shi Feng after only a brief moment. Instead, he executed it continuously and bombarded Shi Feng’s location with a constant stream of sword lights.

If players had yet to reach the fifth-floor standard, they would be incapable of maximizing the potential of their sixth sense to predict danger. Without this ability, players would be incapable of coping against an overwhelming number of attacks. Even if players relied on Skills and Spells to defend themselves, these would only be temporary measures that would run out sooner or later.

After Ghost Hand continued his assault for two whole minutes, the area Shi Feng stood in had transformed into a huge crater littered with countless small holes. From the devastation Ghost Hand caused, one could see just how frighteningly high his attack frequency was.

However, executing Star Rain continuously for two whole minutes did not come without a price. At this time, Ghost Hand’s complexion had become extremely pale, and his hand that wielded the Thorn of Sins was trembling. Evidently, Ghost Hand had pushed himself to the limits in his attack on Shi Feng.

“It’s over,” Ghost Hand said indifferently as he looked into the empty crater, unsurprised that it was empty. Then, he turned his gaze to Desolate Fury’s group of three and continued, “It’s your turn next!”

However, as soon as Ghost Hand finished speaking, he immediately sensed something was amiss. This was because he could not see the fearful expressions he had expected to find on Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury. Instead, all he saw were expressions of confusion.

“Boss! Be careful!”

“He’s behind you!”

Ghost Hand’s subordinates shouted in a panic.

Behind?

Before he realized it, a longsword had pierced through his heart. His HP had even instantly plummeted to zero.

Ghost Hand instinctively tried to activate a Lifesaving Skill when he heard his subordinates’ warnings. However, before he could do so, he felt a pain in his chest. Then, when he looked down, he found that a longsword had pierced his heart and deprived him of all of his HP. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“You…”

When Ghost Hand turned around to look behind him, he couldn’t help but reveal a bewildered expression. This was because he found Shi Feng standing behind him completely unscathed. Not even a single point was missing from Shi Feng’s HP bar.

However, what Ghost Hand found even more astonishing was that Shi Feng had gotten behind him without alerting his danger senses. Then, just as he was wondering why his danger senses had failed him, he suddenly noticed that the feeling of insecurity he had experienced and was still experiencing after stepping into this region had suddenly disappeared.

This is…Divine Might?

Ghost Hand immediately understood why he had failed to perceive any danger from Shi Feng’s attack.

Divine Might!

The moment he had stepped into this region, he was already under the influence of Shi Feng’s Divine Might. Everywhere within a person’s Divine Might was a danger zone for hostile targets. So, how was his mind supposed to convey that danger was approaching if it had already been continuously doing so since long ago?

Unfortunately, Ghost Hand realized this point too late, as his HP had already fallen to zero, and his vision had started to go dark.
