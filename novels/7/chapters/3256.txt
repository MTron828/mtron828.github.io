Chapter 3257 Chapter 331 – Even if You Think You Are the Best, There Is Always Someone Better

God’s Domain Association, first-floor lobby:

Hidden Soul was the first to enter the test hall. As soon as she disappeared into the mental space, everyone in the lobby turned to look at the scoreboard, curious to learn what the two beauties, who supposedly shared a close relationship with Black Flame, were capable of.

“Don’t you think it’s a little rash to give up our spots, Pace Angel? What if those two big sisters fail to even get into the top 1,000? If that’s the case, we’d have given up our spots for nothing,” the indifferent young man from the Blue Flash World said, a hint of worry appearing in his eyes as he watched Hidden Soul disappearing into the test hall.

Several hundred inhabitants from Blue Flash had entered Star Lake City this time. Although he and the lively girl going by the name of Pace Angel ranked among the top five and were confident they could get into the top 1,000 of the Star Lake Legion’s selection, they were not at all confident they could get into the top 100.

!!

Unlike the children of powerful individuals and families from Blue Flash, the two of them didn’t have any powers to rely on in the Greater World. They also didn’t have a treasure trove of resources waiting for them in the Greater World.

The only opportunity they had right now was the God’s Domain Association’s newcomer benefits. If they made proper use of these newcomer benefits, they could achieve rapid growth within a short time.

Meanwhile, the first step for them to achieve rapid growth was to secure a good room in the God’s Domain Association Building. The lodgings available on the Association Building’s 400th floor and above could be deemed mainstream lodgings for mental strength masters, so their priority was undoubtedly to secure a room on the 400th floor or higher. Otherwise, they’d have to settle for the vastly inferior lodgings found below the 400th floor.

However, lodgings on the God’s Domain Association Building’s 400th floor and above were very limited and distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This meant that the sooner they took their selection test, the better. Yet, now, they had given up their places to Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow to curry favor with them.

It should be known that Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow were only two-star mental strength masters. Many youths participating in the selection were two-star mental strength masters, so Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow were nothing special.

Not to mention, neither of the two women looked like they were teenagers. At their age, even a three-star mental strength master wouldn’t necessarily be able to rank within the top 1,000. After all, the selection was already nearing its end, so competition was incredibly intense. Anyone who could remain within the top 1,000 at this time was an extraordinary individual.

“You should know that you and I have nobody to rely on in Star Lake City, Clay Blade. We might have talent, but unless we can get our hands on the same resources as the Greater World’s geniuses enjoy, I highly doubt we can accomplish anything even if we do get into the Star Lake Legion…” the lively girl named Pace Angel said, sighing.

“Getting acquainted with those two big sisters is the only solution I can think of for now. So long as those two big sisters join the Star Lake Legion, they’ll definitely receive priority from the legion. I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you how small the chances are for an official participant to get selected for a City Competition, right? There are only a few City Competitions each year, and we’d be fortunate if we could get selected for one once every few years. Rather than settle for such a mediocre fate, we might as well take a risk.”

“Let’s hope you’re right…” the indifferent youth named Clay Blade said, inwardly praying as he looked at the test hall’s door.

…

While Pace Angel and Clay Blade were talking quietly, an elegant young man with long hair quietly observed the ongoings in the lobby from a VIP dining area on the second floor. Meanwhile, this elegant young man was none other than Chen Qitian, one of the Dawn Light Corporation’s heirs. He was also currently ranked 19th in the selection.

“Old Tan has refused our offer now that Shi Feng has Black Flame as his backing, Young Master,” a middle-aged man wearing a butler’s uniform said respectfully after approaching Chen Qitian. In addition to being a butler, the middle-aged man was also a one-star mental strength grandmaster.

“He’s afraid of Black Flame?” Chen Qitian smirked as he swirled the glass of red wine in his hand. “Old Tan has really grown old. If he’s so shortsighted, no wonder he can’t ever break into the three-star grandmaster standard. So what if Shi Feng has Black Flame backing him? Now that my elder brother has already obtained that item, he is almost certain to pass the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition and become one of the conglomerate’s silver members. At that time, Black Flame will be nothing more than a joke!”

Upon hearing Chen Qitian’s words, the four one-star mental strength grandmasters working as Chen Qitian’s bodyguards immediately started taking their jobs more seriously.

The position of the Star Lake Legion’s vice commander might hold significant importance in Star Lake City, but it was insignificant compared to the Galaxy Conglomerate’s silver membership. If Chen Qilin became a silver member of the Galaxy Conglomerate, even the Star Lake Legion’s commander would have to treat him courteously.

…

While Chen Qitian was talking to his butler, the scoreboard in the lobby suddenly showed a new result. Immediately, the lobby fell silent as everyone looked at this result in shock and confusion.

Death Omen, in particular, gaped in shock when she saw this result, her mind falling into disarray.

How is this possible?!

Death Omen dared not believe her eyes.

…

Mental Grade: Three-Star Mental Strength Master; Potential Rating: 96; Mental Strength Rating: S; Mental Control Rating: A

Overall Ranking: 35

…

In addition to Death Omen, Thousand Scars was similarly stunned by this outcome.

Thousand Scars knew about the relationship and feud between Death Omen and Hidden Soul. She also knew that when it came to combat talent, Death Omen was above Hidden Soul.

However, in Thousand Scars’ opinion, even though Death Omen possessed extraordinary talent, it should still be difficult for her to get into the selection’s top 100. It was especially so when there was so little time left until the selection ended.

So, what was up with Hidden Soul’s results?

Setting aside how Hidden Soul’s mental strength standard had suddenly gone from that of a two-star master to a three-star master, how in the world did she receive a Potential Rating of 96 and a Mental Strength Rating of S?

Could there be an error in the system? Thousand Scars instinctively thought.

It should be known that apart from Shi Feng, no other newcomer had managed to get into the selection’s top 100 on their first test. Moreover, the rank Hidden Soul received on her first test was significantly higher than Shi Feng’s. No matter how Thousand Scars looked at this, something must have gone wrong with the test hall’s system.

After all, Hidden Soul was someone who couldn’t even get promoted to Tier 6. How could she possibly get into the selection’s top 100 on her first test, much less the top 50?

However, contrary to Thousand Scars’ expectations, the examiner did not deny the validity of Hidden Soul’s test results. The only thing the examiner did was to announce that Hidden Soul had gained the privilege of staying in a room on the 498th floor.

Out of everyone in the lobby, the only person unfazed by Hidden Soul’s results was Shi Feng.

Shi Feng knew that it was only natural for Hidden Soul to achieve such results.

The current Hidden Soul was no longer the same person she was before. Not only had she learned the Saint-rank Mana Technique Holy Annihilation, but she had also spent considerable time training on the Primordial Tower’s second floor throughout this period. One’s ability to manipulate mana was directly related to one’s Concentration standard, also known as mental strength. So, thanks to all the mana manipulation training she did, her mental strength also received significant improvements.

Not to mention, Shi Feng had also secretly given Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow hints regarding the God’s Domain Association’s mental space. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Combining all these factors with the fact that Hidden Soul had taken her first test with a much stronger mental strength standard than Shi Feng did for his first test, it was completely understandable for Hidden Soul to achieve such test results.

Time quickly passed while everyone was busy discussing Hidden Soul’s astonishing performance. By the time everyone had recovered from their shock, Gentle Snow, who had gone into the test hall after Hidden Soul left it, slowly walked out of the test hall.

Mental Grade: Two-Star Mental Strength Master; Potential Rating: 98; Mental Strength Rating: A; Mental Control Rating: S

Overall Ranking: 10!

TL Notes:

[1]Pace Angel(步琪) and Clay Blade(陶刃): I’m not sure if these are their real names or character names, so I decided to translate them under the assumption that they are character names. They’re also easier to memorize. Personally, I’ve never heard of anyone using 步琪 and 陶刃 for real Chinese names.
