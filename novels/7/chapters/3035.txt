Chapter 110 – Start of a New Era

The strongest Tier 6 God-ranked expert! So, this is the strength Instructor Shi has been hiding all along?

Chen Ziyou dared not believe the crazy thought she just had.

Asura!

The current number one God-ranked expert in the God’s Domain Association’s instructor certification test!

Just reaching Tier 6 was already an unachievable goal for most players in God’s Domain, let alone becoming the strongest player among Tier 6 God-ranked experts.

With her meager talent and strength, Chen Ziyou had never once harbored any thoughts of having any interactions with such a player. Not to mention, Shi Feng was merely the former Guild Leader of Shadow, a second-rate Guild, in the past.

Although Chen Ziyou had long since known that Shi Feng couldn’t possibly be just a Tier 3 expert with his combat standards, she had never thought that he would have anything to do with Tier 6 God-ranked experts.

However, Chen Ziyou had no choice but to have such thoughts in the current situation. Unlike everyone else, she possessed much more information about the participant named Asura. After all, Shi Feng was her registered instructor. So, the instant Shi Feng became a Gold Instructor, she would be entered into the Gold List as well.

Currently, there were already several dozen people registered on the third-floor trial’s scoreboard. Among them, some were Tier 6 God-ranked experts, and some were apex existences among Tier 5 experts. After all, the trials only tested the participants’ combat standards. The trials didn’t consider the participants’ tiers, equipment, Skills, Spells, Legacies, etc. So, it wasn’t strange for Tier 5 experts to conquer the third-floor trial as well.

However, the instant Asura’s name got registered on the third-floor trial’s scoreboard, Chen Ziyou had also received a notification that she had qualified for the God’s Domain Association’s Gold List.

In Chen Ziyou’s opinion, this definitely wasn’t a coincidence.

After all, nobody else had gotten registered on the third floor’s scoreboard around this time. So, this meant that Asura was Shi Feng, and Shi Feng was Asura.

While Chen Ziyou was feeling shocked over this situation, Shi Feng had also walked up to her and quietly said, “Don’t tell my secret to anyone else for the moment. I still don’t want too many people finding out about this. Such a situation wouldn’t be beneficial to you or me.”

Shi Feng wasn’t surprised that Chen Ziyou had figured out that he was Asura. After all, he had registered her as his apprentice. So long as Chen Ziyou was paying attention, she could easily connect the dots.

“Mhm.” Chen Ziyou nodded like a timid rabbit, her eyes filled with excitement and reverence as she looked at Shi Feng. After all, the strongest Tier 6 God-ranked expert in God’s Domain was her instructor. There was no way she wouldn’t be excited over this situation.

She also understood why Shi Feng had given her such a reminder.

Situations where destruction pursued the great happened frequently in God’s Domain.

Now that Asura had already become known as the strongest God-ranked expert, the various superpowers were probably frantically looking into Asura’s identity.

It might be fine if Asura belonged to the various superpowers. However, if Asura turned out to be an independent expert with no background, there would only be two possible actions the various superpowers would take: recruiting or disposing of the player known as Asura.

With the combat standards Shi Feng had currently displayed, it went without saying that the various superpowers would first try to recruit him at all costs. However, if they failed to get Shi Feng to join them, the subsequent actions they would take went without saying.

At that time, the various superpowers probably wouldn’t stop at just targeting Shi Feng. Even the people around Shi Feng might not be spared.

Meanwhile, as Shi Feng’s registered apprentice, Chen Ziyou would definitely be the first to suffer the various superpowers’ wrath.

“You’ll have to start working harder to improve yourself once we return,” Shi Feng said as he looked at the names on the third-floor trial’s scoreboard. “The resources the Association provides are quite tempting, so it won’t be long before war breaks out among the various powers. If you don’t have enough strength, you might even have difficulty leveling up.”

“The various powers are going to go to war?” Chen Ziyou was confused by Shi Feng’s words.

The current situation in God’s Domain could be described as a pool of dead water. At most, the various powers would engage in insignificant conflicts. Never would they start a full-blown war against one another. So, she found it hard to believe that a war would break out among the various powers.

“You’ll know what I mean soon enough,” Shi Feng said, not bothering to explain himself. Then, he turned around and left the 175th floor.

The reason the various powers could maintain a stable relationship with one another thus far was due to the vague gap in strength between experts, particularly Tier 5 experts. After all, nobody could tell how strong a Tier 5 expert was compared to other Tier 5 experts until they fought. Meanwhile, although fights between Tier 5 experts happened from time to time, they were still relatively rare. Because of this, most Tier 5 experts were unaware of how strong they were compared to their peers, and the only way to determine a power’s overall strength was through the number of Tier 5 experts it had.

However, the advent of the God’s Domain Association’s instructor certification test had just removed this unknown variable and shattered the balance between the various powers.

Now, everyone was aware that not all Tier 5 experts were equal and that it was possible for one Tier 5 expert to defeat multiple Tier 5 experts.

In that case, how could the Guilds with fewer but stronger Tier 5 experts be willing to settle for fewer resources than Guilds with more but weaker Tier 5 experts?

God’s Domain had already officially become a second world for humans. Every additional territory a power occupied could mean profits that could make even major corporations grow envious. Not to mention, now that God’s Domain faced the threat of invasion by Outerworld forces, the various powers would need more resources to nurture more experts so that they could better defend their territories.

Hence, now that the unknown variable known as the strength of experts was out of the way, God’s Domain’s various powers might very well launch an all-out war against each other after today. Meanwhile, if these powers were willing to go to war with each other, it went without saying that they wouldn’t hesitate to target independent players, either.

At this time, Shi Feng wasn’t the only one who noticed this point. The many powers and experts paying attention to the instructor certification test also realized it.

…

Is this going to be the reshuffling for Tier 5 experts? Lin Yaoyue frowned as she looked at her quantum watch’s holographic display.

It was a common opinion that Tier 5 experts were largely equal in strength to each other in the past. Even if there was a difference, it wouldn’t be significant.

However, the scoreboards of the second- and third-floor trials proved otherwise.

Contrary to everyone’s expectations, a massive gap in strength existed even among Tier 5 experts. It was especially true for the gap between the older generation and the newer generation Tier 5 experts. Unexpectedly, everyone had overestimated the older generation experts and underestimated the newer generation experts. This was because most of the Tier 5 experts who had conquered the third-floor trial were newer generation experts.

Seeing this situation, there was no way the various powers would remain quiet and settle for the current status quo in God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, what caught Lin Yaoyue off guard the most was that neither her Guild’s Guild Leader nor Great Elder Confused Heart had made it onto the third floor’s scoreboard. This outcome would undoubtedly create a huge impact on Mysterious Moon’s prestige.

In the past, other first-rate Guilds had believed that Mysterious Moon’s Guild Leader and Confused Heart were nigh-invincible existences among Tier 5 experts. Adding on the fact that Mysterious Moon had many Tier 5 experts, the Guild became regarded as top-tier among first-rate Guilds.

Meanwhile, thanks to this status, Mysterious Moon was able to occupy crucial territories most other first-rate Guilds could never occupy. Other first-rate Guilds had even taken the initiative to surrender some of the Miniature Ancient World’s resources to Mysterious Moon out of fear and respect.

However, now that both of these supposedly invincible individuals had failed to clear the third-floor trial, it meant that they were no different than the other Tier 5 experts that were stuck on the second-floor trial. This situation would put Mysterious Moon in an incredibly precarious situation…

On the other side, after the God’s Domain Association’s instructor certification test ended, Chen Ziyou got into the Association’s Talent Camp without fail, and Shi Feng also received the bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid Qi Lanshan had promised him.
