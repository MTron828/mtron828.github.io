Chapter 325 – You Too?

TL Notes:

Changing “ninefold Sword’s Orbit” to “Ninefold Sword’s Orbit.”

…

When Shi Feng activated Godslayer, the mana around him underwent a dramatic transformation and formed a mana pillar exceeding 500 meters.

!!

At the same time as the mana pillar appeared, the projection of the illusory world centered around Shi Feng became clearer. Originally, the illusory world was at 95% transparency. Now, its transparency had gone down to 80%. The area covered also increased from a 100-yard radius to a 300-yard radius, and the influence it had on the Greater God’s Domain strengthened significantly.

These abrupt changes shocked the players watching the broadcast.

“A mana pillar that’s 500 meters tall?”

“Even if he has a 120% Epic Mana Body, shouldn’t the maximum height only be 100 meters?”

“Don’t tell me he has also reached Tier 5?”

“That’s not right. There are no changes to his aura, meaning his Basic Attributes and Physique have not improved. If he reached the Tier 5 standard, there’s no way his aura will remain the same.”

“But if he’s not at Tier 5, how is his mana pillar so tall?”

Shi Feng’s mana pillar was like the midday sun, its appearance instantly increasing the brightness of the entire mountaintop. Everyone couldn’t help but be shocked when they saw this phenomenon.

It was common knowledge that when a Tier 4 player developed their Epic Mana Body to the legendary 120% Completion Rate, the mana pillar they could produce would reach up to 100 meters. A Tier 4 player’s mana pillar reaching 500 meters was simply unheard of in God’s Domain.

While the spectating crowd had fallen into shock and confusion, Shi Feng’s nine frost swords suddenly appeared next to him and moved to meet the several hundred oncoming spatial blades. Then, the nine frost swords created a galaxy of stars.

Ninefold Sword’s Orbit! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The galaxy of stars stopped the several hundred blades dead in their tracks, preventing them from getting within thirty yards of Shi Feng. Compared to before, the defensive network Shi Feng formed with his Ninefold Sword’s Orbit had become significantly stronger.

“He blocked everything? What did he do?”

Glorious Mantra, Martial Quadbeast, and Silent Saintess gaped in shock when they saw Shi Feng standing in mid-air intact.

Markless Blade had already gained complete control over his Tier 5 Magic Equipment. Whether it was Basic Attributes, Physique, or Skills, he already had everything a Tier 5 player would have.

Logically, Shi Feng should be utterly incapable of defending against Markless Blade’s Rampaging Blade. After all, whether it was in terms of attack count or Strength, Markless Blade’s Rampaging Blade had already surpassed Shi Feng’s Ninefold Sword’s Orbit.

Yet, now, Markless Blade had failed to even damage Shi Feng, let alone heavily injure or kill him.

As for Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao, they were similarly shocked when they saw this outcome.

“Brother Black Flame is amazing! He can even hold his ground against one of Heavenly Boa’s Seven Great Paragons! With this, even Saint Three won’t have any leverage over Brother Black Flame!” Midsummer exclaimed.

Markless Bade was Heavenly Boa’s Seven Great Paragons. Although he ranked near the bottom of the seven, he was still a paragon rivaling Saint Three. Not to mention, now that Markless Blade could exhibit 100% of his Tier 5 Magic Equipment’s strength, he could even compete for the Rookie Competition’s number one position.

As for Markless Blade, who had just gained full control over his Tier 5 Magic Equipment, he, too, was shocked by this outcome.

“Have you…also reached Tier 5?” Markless Blade asked, his mind full of doubts and confusion about the Strength and reaction speed Shi Feng had just displayed. Setting aside Shi Feng’s Strength, just the fact that Shi Feng could keep up with his Tier 5 attack frequency was already plenty unbelievable.

The biggest factor that separated Tier 4 and Tier 5 players in God’s Domain was reaction speed. This difference led to a situation where even if a Tier 4 player had similar Basic Attributes as a Tier 5 player, the former still wouldn’t be a match for the latter.

Meanwhile, after Markless Blade gained full control of his Tier 5 Magic Equipment, his reaction speed had already entered the Tier 5 threshold. So, a Tier 4 expert should be helpless against his maximum attack frequency. Yet, Shi Feng had blocked all of his attacks.

Aside from Shi Feng having a Legendary Weapon, the only other explanation Markless Blade could think of for this situation was that Shi Feng had similarly crossed into the Tier 5 threshold as he did.

Legendary Weapons were incredibly precious even to the various hegemonic powers. Not even the Tier 6 powerhouses of hegemonic powers would necessarily be assigned one, let alone someone with no background like Shi Feng.

“Do you think I have to be Tier 5 to block your attacks?” Shi Feng responded nonchalantly.

The superiority of Tier 5 players over Tier 4 players lies in reaction speed.

Although Godslayer did not provide any bonuses to his Basic Attributes and Physique, it drastically improved the strength of his Mana and Concentration standard.

Before becoming a Special Lifeform, Shi Feng could already gain Tier 5 Mana and Tier 5 Concentration, qualifying to fight a Tier 5 Demon King.

Now that Shi Feng had become a Special Lifeform, under the effects of Godslayer, his Mana and Concentration had reached a completely new level. He was far superior to Markless Blade, who had only reached the entry-level of Tier 5 in these two aspects.

Not to mention, Shi Feng’s strengthened mana also improved his World Creation, which further weakened all enemy attacks within its range and boosted the power of his attacks. As for his Concentration, which now reached the Intermediate-rank Tier 4 standard, it allowed him to manipulate his nine frost swords with greater ease. This meant he could increase his performance with the frost swords.

Moreover, Sword’s Orbit was inherently a defensive combat technique. Offense was never its strong suit, so it would naturally show better performance when he switched from using it offensively to defensively.

Meanwhile, all these factors added together made it so that Markless Blade’s spatial blades were not a threat to Shi Feng.

However, Godslayer only had a 30-second duration. Shi Feng couldn’t afford to let the battle drag on for too long. So, as soon as he finished speaking, he raised the Winter of Eternal Night in his hand and willed for two frost swords to follow suit.

Immediately afterward, the three weapons devoured all mana within a 300-yard radius, causing the space of the affected area to freeze. Even though Markless Blade was equipped with a piece of Tier 5 Magic Equipment, the lack of mana in the area still caused him to feel a little uncomfortable and his movements to become sluggish.

Before Markless Blade could adapt to this sudden change, the Winter of Eternal Night in Shi Feng’s hands and the two frost swords hovering next to him executed a downward slash that carried a hair-raising amount of power.

Third Sword, Holy Annihilation!

Three slashes fell toward Markless Blade simultaneously. From Markless Blade’s perspective, it looked as if darkness was descending toward him, the descent of the darkness so quick that he couldn’t evade it in time with his heavy body.

All three of Shi Feng’s slashes carried power far greater than any of Shi Feng’s previous attacks. When Markless Blade saw the three slashes, he immediately understood that not even Tier 5 players should try to block them. He wouldn’t even be surprised if just one of these slashes was enough to heavily injure a Tier 5 Legendary monster.

Tier 5 Additional Active Skill, Mana Overflow!

Tier 5 Additional Active Skill, Eradicating Light!

Markless Blade decided to use everything he had to defend against the three slashes. Immediately, he used his Tier 5 Magic Equipment’s Additional Skills Mana Overflow and Eradicating Light. Mana Overflow doubled his mana volume and increased the effects of his Skills and Spells by 100%, whereas Eradicating Light enhanced one of his attacks with the Mana Destruction effect and increased the attack’s Strength by 200% and Agility by 100%.

Subsequently, Markless Blade’s God Annihilator received the oncoming slashes one after another, each collision creating explosions that shook a radius of 1,000 yards. The land within the affected radius cracked and exploded, sending dust and dirt flying everywhere.

After the first collision, Markless Blade’s hands trembled.

After the second collision, Markless Blade’s posture broke, and he was forced to take two steps backward. His HP also fell by over one-third of its maximum.

After the third collision, Markless Blade was sent flying one hundred yards away, his body heavily injured and blood flowing out of the corner of his eyes. His HP also plummeted and hit zero in the blink of an eye. Then, his large body fell powerlessly to the ground…
