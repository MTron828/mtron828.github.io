Chapter 2866 - Astonishing Transformation

“It’s done!”

Shi Feng grew ecstatic as he took in the pillar of light rising from the teleportation array in front of him.

Previously, he had indeed been certain that he could strengthen the teleportation array until it could handle enough Mana to support a teleportation channel connecting the two continents. However, when he began working, he started to have doubts.

After all, the teleportation channel had to span not only the distance between the two continents but also the distance between the western continent’s edge and the Starlight Fortress, which was nowhere near the ocean. If the teleportation array didn’t have enough Mana for this additional distance, it still wouldn’t connect with the spatial node in the Starlight Fortress.

Fortunately, he succeeded in the end.

At this time, Liang Jing called him and asked in a panic, “Guild Leader, did something happen on your side? A pillar of light suddenly came from the Teleportation Hall. Right now, everyone in the city is talking about it, thinking that something big happened there.”

The Teleportation Hall was an important economic resource for Zero Wing City. At the same time, it was the foundation of the city’s prosperity.

In the absence of a Guild Residence and the teleportation array, players could only run to the distant Arctic Canyon. If this were to happen, Zero Wing’s partner forces and their members would definitely be less enthusiastic about visiting Zero Wing City.

“Relax. Everything’s fine,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “I just completed the teleportation array connecting the two continents. From now on, we can freely teleport to the western continent from the Teleportation Hall, and there won’t be any restrictions on time or headcount.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“We can freely teleport to the western continent?”

Liang Jing was momentarily stunned, her mind failing to process Shi Feng’s words. Her eyes were wide with disbelief as she looked at Shi Feng’s face on the screen. Before the World Passage’s activation, connecting the two main continents held great importance only in terms of trade.

However, after the World Passage opened, battlefields appeared all over the eastern continent, and massacres became common out in the wild. Due to the chaos and constant threats, many of the eastern continent’s powers and players sought to develop on the western continent.

Unfortunately, there was a limited number of ancient teleportation arrays on the eastern continent. Even among the superpowers, very few could travel between the two continents. Moreover, even these few superpowers could transport only a small number of elites at a time.

Now, Shi Feng was telling her that Zero Wing City’s Teleportation Hall could facilitate travel to the western continent without any restrictions. How could she possibly believe this?

If news of this matter were to get out, a tsunami of players would flood Zero Wing City within a day.

This function would overturn the situation on the eastern continent; it was game-changing.

“Yes. Didn’t you propose to open Zero Wing further?” Smiling, Shi Feng said, “Now that the intercontinental teleportation array is completed, you can announce to the public that Zero Wing City will be fully opened to the public starting today. Our partner and subordinate forces will enjoy a 70% discount on all teleportations!”

Originally, he had not intended to fully open Zero Wing City so soon. However, the city’s development was astonishing, hitting a bottleneck already. To further spread Zero Wing’s influence, he could only fully open Zero Wing City to the public.

In this way, Zero Wing could attract an ocean of wealth and resources to Zero Wing City, as well as more expert players to the Guild.

“Fully open the city? Guild Leader, isn’t this a little…too soon?” Liang Jing panicked at Shi Feng’s words. “Zero Wing City’s present environment and security standards are already enough to drive many players and superpowers wild. Once news that our Teleportation Hall is connected to the western continent spreads, we will definitely become a thorn in the eyes of all forces on the eastern continent. Even the Outerworld’s forces will probably go nuts over Zero Wing City.”

Liang Jing didn’t even need to think about what would await Zero Wing City if the city were fully open to the public.

It would definitely spark massive changes in the entire eastern continent-no, the entire God’s Domain!

The intensity of the changes would not be the slightest bit inferior to the World Passage’s activation. At that time, Zero Wing would become the focal point of the entire God’s Domain even if it tried to maintain a low profile.

With access to such frightening resources and influence, Zero Wing would soon grow into an existence that could surpass even the Five Great Super Guilds combined. This definitely wasn’t an outcome any superpower-native or Outerworld-would be willing to see.

Hence, as long as news of Zero Wing City’s full opening spread, Zero Wing would become the common enemy of all native and Outerworld superpowers.

While Zero Wing had recently grown significantly, it definitely couldn’t go up against so many superpowers simultaneously. Not to mention, the Outerworld superpowers were existences that had successfully destroyed more than a dozen kingdoms.

Moreover, the number of Tier 4 NPCs a kingdom commanded far exceeded Zero Wing’s number of Tier 4 experts. The royal capitals of NPC kingdoms had stronger defenses than Zero Wing City, yet these cities had still fallen in the end.

Of course, a large part of why these kingdoms had fallen was the Outerworld’s NPC forces. However, nobody could say for certain that the Outerworld’s players couldn’t guide or cooperate with the Outerworld’s NPC forces to target Zero Wing.

Naturally, Shi Feng understood Liang Jing’s concerns. In an earnest tone, he explained, “I understand, but this is a problem we will have to face sooner or later. Thus, we should strike while the iron is hot and strengthen Zero Wing in one fell swoop. If we succeed, we’ll have a much better chance at contending with the native and Outerworld superpowers.”

Previously, Sixteenth Cloud had provided him with plenty of information regarding the Outerworld’s various forces. Hence, he understood that the main reason the eastern continent had yet to fall completely was that only a small portion of the Outerworld’s superpowers and NPC forces had crossed the World Passage. However, as more time passed, more Outerworld NPC and player forces were bound to arrive on the eastern continent. Eventually, Zero Wing would have to go up against these Outerworld forces.

To put it simply, Zero Wing wasn’t in a race against the various forces but against time.

Under these circumstances, the Guild would naturally be better off developing as quickly as possible.

Rather than acquiring small amounts of resources and developing slowly in secret, Zero Wing would be better off going big and developing rapidly while the Outerworld’s forces were still settling down in the eastern continent.

Not to mention, Zero Wing currently had a lot of partner forces already. With these partners, it wouldn’t necessarily be impossible for Zero Wing to go up against the native and Outerworld superpowers that had yet to develop themselves adequately. “This…”

Liang Jing was momentarily at a loss for words.

In her opinion, Shi Feng’s decision was simply absurd. However, she didn’t have a better suggestion.

“Relax. I know what I’m doing,” Shi Feng consoled when he saw Liang Jing’s hesitancy. “Just get everything prepared on your side. Also, notify Melancholic and Youlan about this. I’m afraid you three will be very busy in the future.”

Liang Jing had no choice but to nod helplessly.

Shi Feng had always acted more like a figurehead than an actual Guild Leader. Although he had laid a massive foundation for the Guild, he would leave the Guild’s daily maintenance and operation to others. Naturally, Liang Jing felt incredibly frustrated by this situation, and she frequently wished she could curse him to his face. Deep down, however, she still felt happy and excited for some inexplicable reason. After disconnecting the call, Liang Jing promptly began making the necessary preparations, while Shi Feng headed to Zero Wing City’s City Lord’s Mansion.

City Lord’s Mansion, second underground floor, statue room:

At this time, apart from Shi Feng, everybody else had been told to leave the room. Shi Feng had also temporarily removed the entry rights for core members and ordered the two Tier 4 Fine-Gold Guards outside to prevent anyone from approaching the room.

Now that my Concentration is at Tier 5, and my understanding of and control over Mana have reached their limits, it’s about time I tried breaking through to Tier 5.

Looking at the Ancient Beast Sculpture in front of him, Shi Feng began constructing an entirely new Mana Body.
