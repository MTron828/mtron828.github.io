Chapter 2099 – Horrifying

Predicament “They’re dead?”

“Didn’t they say that Zero Wing’s members were only using items that increased their auras?”

When the various experts on the battlefield saw the corpses of Sword Demon and two Blackwater peak experts disintegrate into particles of light, their eyes nearly fell from their sockets in shock.

Both sides had been evenly matched and fought each other to a standstill earlier, yet something like this had happened within seconds...

No one had expected this outcome. Even Mu Cheng was speechless for a long moment

Even among Super Guilds, experts like Sword Demon were exceedingly rare. Trying to kill an expert with such high combat standards was nearly impossible without launching a large-scale operation and multiple Domain Realm experts.

This was also why the various superpowers had such huge headaches when dealing with the Four Shadow Demons.

Yet, Shi Feng had relied on his own strength to kill Shadow Demon. His combat power was truly horrific. Logically, no player should be capable of the feat

Moreover, Zero Wing had Alluring Summer and Shadow Sword, who had suddenly revealed their monster-level abilities. The fact that a Guild like Zero Wing had two monster-level experts surprising enough, yet two more had appeared from the Guild. With this strength, Zero Wing could rival ordinary superpowers.

To think Zero Wing has hidden so much power all this time! It’s no wonder why it dared to ignore Starlink and Blackwater’s threats. As Blindman looked at Shi Feng now, he felt as if he were meeting this Swordsman for the first time.

One monster-level expert in Zero Wing was enough to warrant the various superpowers’ attention, but with four, not even King’s Return could afford to underestimate the Guild.

Blindman finally realized why Deep Thunder had shown such strong support for Zero Wing, even willing to provoke Starlink and Blackwater.

Zero Wing was only as powerful as a first-rate Guild, lacking the resources and territory to nurture experts, yet despite that, it had successfully produced four monster-level experts. It was easy to imagine what strength the Guild would wield if it became a true super-first-rate Guild. Zero Wing would likely rise to the upper ranks the moment it became a superpower. It would become as powerful as Guilds like Miracle, and even the various Super Guilds would fear its wrath.

Miracle currently occupied two empires, and both were on different continents, the east and west continents. In other words, Miracle fought on two frontlines. Not even King’s Return had such power.

In contrast, Deep Thunder watched Zero Wing’s outstanding performance with elation.

We really made the right bet this time! Deep Thunder’s eyes glowed as he watched Alluring Summer and Shadow Sword fight in the distance. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He had thought Zero Wing only had two monster-level experts. Neither he nor Nature Hall as a whole had expected to find four of them in the Guild.

As far as ordinary major powers were concerned, monster-level experts simply had inhuman combat power. Even if these powers got lucky and produced one of their own, they’d only treat that expert like a weapon against their enemies. However, that would be an ignorant use of such a powerful player.

In reality, not only did monster-level experts pose a great threat to the various superpowers, but they also played a crucial role in obtaining powerful items. Based on the various superpowers’ research, one needed strength, as well as luck, to secure certain powerful tools.

As Guilds procured more powerful items, they’d grow stronger overall.

One could say that monster-level experts were responsible for finding 70% of the powerful items the various superpowers had collected.

Since Nature Hall had only recently become a superpower, it had far fewer monster-level experts in its midst than other super-first-rate Guilds. The fact had troubled the Guild for some time now.

Yet, as luck would have it, many of God’s Domain’s super-high-ranked quests required more than one person to complete; they needed the strength of a team. But how rare were monster- level experts?

Even in veteran superpowers, one could count the number of monster-level experts present on one hand. If Nature Hall wanted to complete super-high-ranked quests, it would need to work with other superpowers, but if it chose that option, it would gain far less.

However, it would be a different story if Nature Hall worked with Zero Wing. Zero Wing was still only a first-rate Guild. To develop further, it would need an astronomical amount of resources, not powerful items. As it so happened, Nature Hall had plenty of resources.

Nature Hall would benefit more by partnering with Zero Wing than it would if it worked with other superpowers. Both Guilds would be able to complement each other’s deficiencies.

This was why Nature Manifestation had sent Deep Thunder to befriend Zero Wing.

While everyone was shocked over the strength Zero Wing’s members had displayed, Shi Feng, Alluring Summer, and Shadow Sword busied themselves by slaughtering Starlink and Blackwater’s o什ler experts.

Although Deep Sea Meditation was only a Basic Secret Law, maintaining it placed an immense burden on players. Players couldn’t even keep it active as long as a Berserk Skill.

Fortunately, the difference between both sides’ strength was massive. Shi Feng and his companions only neede a few moves to dispatch each of their opponents.

In less than ten seconds, Blackwater’s members had been annihilated. Even South Time, Blackwater’s Domain Realm expert, hadn’t survived the combined assault from Alluring Summer and Shadow Sword. As for Starlink, only Wind Demon remained alive. The battle was utterly one-sided.

As he faced Shi Feng’s relentless pursuit, Wind Demon continued to lose HP.

80%... 50%... 20%...

However, despite his rapidly depleting HP, Wind Demon didn’t panic. Instead, he turned his mocking gaze on Shi Feng and said, “I have really underestimated you people from Zero Wing. But so what if you defeat us? At the end of the day, this is only one of five battlefields. Starlink and Blackwater still have plenty of experts on the other four. On the other hand, all of Zero Wing’s top fighters are stuck on this battlefield.”

Zero Wing had certainly proven stronger than they had expected, but the results of one battlefield wouldn’t decide this competition’s victor. Although Zero Wing had indeed defeated their two Guilds here, with its peak combatants isolated to Battlefield No. 1, it would suffer on the other four battlefields. In the end, Zero Wing would still lose White River City.

Wind Demon had spoken loudly enough to ensure that the major powers’ experts, who stood several hundred yards away, had heard him. Those experts couldn’t help but watch Shi Feng with pitying looks.

“In the end, Zero Wing will lose,” one of the spectating experts mumbled.

Although Zero Wing had won the battle, it had lost the competition.

...

“Black Flame! You asked for this! Since you rejected my offer, you’ll pay for your foolishness for the rest of your life!” Jing Yang, who had resurrected in the arena, bellowed as he glared at Shi Feng through the Magic Mirror. He then commanded his people through the team chat, “Everyone, heed my command! Work with Starlink’s members to eliminate Zero Wing!”

He had planned to give Zero Wing one more chance to hand over the Guardian Puppets. If Zero Wing agreed and behaved itself, Blackwater would give up its aggression against the Guild. However, he abandoned the thought His desire to see Shi Feng despair was far stronger than his desire to complete the task Xuanwu Chisa had given him.
