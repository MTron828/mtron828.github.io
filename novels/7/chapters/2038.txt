Chapter 2039 – Zero Wing

Three Kills’ words echoed throughout the valley. Starlink’s members, who were in the midst of battle, promptly reacted to his words, their gazes shifting to Seven Light and Shi Feng in fear.

As Three Kills had said, the Hundred Flowers Palace was only an ordinary first-rate Guild.

There was no way the Guild could break past their blockade with only fourteen players, killing so many of Three Kills’ peak experts.

No matter how they thought about it, the Palace wasn’t capable of the feat.

There was only one explanation for this; these fourteen players were from a different power.

“Are you from Unyielding Soul or Crimson Emperor? Do you really have to be so secretive?” Three Kills asked, staring at Shi Feng.

It was only a matter of time before Shi Feng’s group shattered the blockade. Stoping them was impossible, regardless of how much Three Kills wanted to.

He couldn’t figure out which power would be capable of dispatching such a small, yet powerful, assault team aside from Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor.

If either of these superpowers had intervened in this battle, Starlink would definitely have to be careful, especially if Crimson Emperor were responsible for this team.

Starlink was already engaged in a war of annihilation with Unyielding Soul. If Crimson Emperor got involved, Starlink would likely have to face two superpowers at the same time.

Three Kills needed to know if Shi Feng’s party originated from the superpower or not.

“You don’t need to guess. We aren’t from either of those Guilds,” Shi Feng answered with a faint smile. He understood what Three Kills must be thinking.

“After all you’ve done here, don’t tell me you’re afraid of giving us your name? There are only a handful of powers in the Dark Night Empire that are capable of accomplishing what you have. Do you really need to hide?” Three Kills growled, attempting to provoke the Swordsman.

Starlink’s members raised their voices in agreement the moment Three Kills finished his question.

“Our Vice Guild Leader is right! You’ve already won this battle, yet you refuse to own up?! You dare call yourselves a superpower with such cowardice?!”

“I bet they’re afraid of our Guild’s retaliation, so they don’t want to reveal themselves.”

“That’s right! Only cowardly Guilds act like this! If they had faced us head-on and honestly, we would’ve flattened them!”

Starlink’s members started to lambast Shi Feng and his party. They said anything they could think of to get a rise from the group. They no longer cared about their crumbling blockade, considering the feat as a matter of course. Now, they were only irked by the fact that Shi Feng’s group refused to reveal their Guild after launching such a surprise attack.

“Vice Guild Leader Three, are you certain that you want to know?” Shi Feng could not help but sigh at Three Kills.

“What’s there preventing you from telling us?” Three Kills asked, rolling his eyes.

“Since Vice Guild Leader Three has requested the name of our Guild, Seven, tell them where we’re from. Make sure you say it loudly,” Shi Feng said, turning to Seven Light

“Understood!” Seven Light, who had transformed into a Demonkin, nodded. After taking a deep breath, he shouted, “Listen up! We are from Zero Wing, and we have come under the Hundred Flowers Palace’s invitation! If you wish to keep your lives, you should run!”

After transforming into a gigantic Demonkin, Seven Light’s voice had become much louder than normal players. His words easily reached players that stood several hundred yards away. Even the independent players standing outside of the first defensive line could hear him clearly.

“What did he say?”

“They’re Zero Wing’s members?”

“How can that be possible?”

Starlink’s members couldn’t believe the claim.

Zero Wing might be a foreign name to the Dark Night Empire’s general populace, but it was familiar to players from the various Guilds. The Guild was, after all, the overlord of an entire kingdom. As Starlink members, they would have, more or less, investigated such a powerhouse.

However, Zero Wing was merely an up-and-coming Guild, only capable of rivaling first-rate Guilds’ strength. Claiming that the Guild had players who could break past their blockade so effortlessly was a joke.

“They must be lying!”

“Right! They must be afraid of revealing which superpower they belong to, so they’re using Zero Wing to mislead us! They are shameless!”

“And here I thought you had the courage to take responsibility for your actions. What’s the point of claiming to be from another Guild?”

Starlink’s reaction to Seven Light’s declaration was frenzied as if their rage could only be appeased if Shi Feng and his comrades admitted that they were truly from a superpower.

Seven Light and the other Zero Wing members were at a loss. They did not know whether they should laugh or cry.

They had told Starlink’s members the truth, but the latter refused to believe them, trying to find incomprehensible reasons to force them into admitting their identities.

They finally.

“Forget it. Let’s just destroy their fantasy and let them die in their foolishness,” Shi Feng said after glancing over Starlink’s members, who had practically fallen into madness.

Seven Light and his companions nodded, removing their Black Cloaks and revealing their true appearances before Starlink’s forces.

Even if Starlink’s members refused to believe their claim, they couldn’t ignore the six-winged emblem the party members wore.

“That’s a fake! It must be!”

“A disguise! Right! They must be using a disguise!”

While Starhlink’s members still refused to believe that Seven Light and his party were from Zero Wing even after seeing the six-winged emblem pinned to their armor, the independent players on the sidelines didn’t doubt the fact. Rather, they were shocked by the revelation.

“Zero Wing is actually this strong?”

“Zero Wing broke past Starlink’s blockade with just fourteen players? This is big news!”

After watching Shi Feng and the others smash through Starlink’s third line of defense so easily, the nearby independent players began to record the remaining battle and post the videos on the official forums. They planned to use this opportunity to make a little extra money on the side.

At this time, one of the Hundred Flowers Palace’s Assassin scouts, who watched from several hundred yards away from the blockade, contacted Cleansed Rue.

“How are things going on Zero Wing’s side?” Cleansed Rue asked anxiously.

She had already notified the Assassin scouts to contact her the moment Zero Wing’s members began to falter, but she hadn’t received word even after so long. She had even begun to wonder if the Assassin scouts had forgotten to do their jobs.

If they didn’t send someone to pin down Three Kills the moment Zero Wing’s members fell, Crimson Heart’s army would fall into a precarious position.

“They just broke through...” the reporting Assassin said.

“What did you say?” Cleansed Rue asked again, wondering if she had heard wrong.

“Vice Guild Leader, Zero Wing’s fourteen members have broken through Starlink’s blockade. Starlink’s forces have descended into chaos! This is the best chance for us to break through!” the Assassin reported excitedly.

叮hey broke through? But how?!” Cleansed Rue couldn’t help her astonishment. “Was our information about Three KHIs’ presence incorrect?”

She couldn’t understand how Shi Feng’s group could’ve succeeded if Three Kills had been present, but if even if he weren’t, there were still plenty of experts guarding the mountain pass. It still shouldn’t be possible for just fourteen players to break past the blockade.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
