Chapter 2794 – God’s Domain’s State of Affairs

This place was a vast, blue ocean with nary a cloud in the sky.

At this time, a tear in space spanning over a thousand yards suddenly appeared above the ocean, its appearance kicking up strong winds that disrupted the peace of this place.

A moment after the spatial tear formed, four figures flew out of it and plopped into the ocean. Their impact on the water generated waves dozens of meters tall, the commotion attracting the attention of the dozen or so ships sailing nearby.

“The Mana here is so thin!”

“The sense of rejection is gone! I think we’re back!”

While standing on the ocean’s surface, Lifeless Thorn, Solitary Nine, and Yu Luo grew excited when they sensed the familiar low-Mana environment and the lack of rejection from the world.

Although the ancient God’s Domain had plenty of benefits that the modern God’s Domain did not possess, they had played in the modern God’s Domain for most of their career in God’s Domain. Most of the people and matters they knew of were found here. Naturally, they were glad to return to the modern God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, the appearance of Shi Feng’s group also gave the players on the nearby ships a huge shock.

“Crap! Who are they? How can they stand on water?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“They should be using some kind of Levitating Skill.”

“No. If they were using a Skill or Spell, there should be strong Mana fluctuations. But I don’t sense any coming from the four of them.”

At this moment, Shi Feng’s group of four had all their information concealed with their Black Cloaks, so the surrounding players couldn’t uncover any information about them. The only thing the surrounding players were certain of was that the four were all players.

Knowing this, the surrounding players couldn’t help wanting to find out the identity of Shi Feng’s group.

“Let’s hurry up and leave,” a Level 123, Tier 3 Ranger driving an Advanced Speedboat said. “The situation in this sea zone has been chaotic recently. We’ll be doomed if we get dragged into the war between adventurer teams on Dragonheart Island!” “Indeed. Let’s leave this place quickly. Now that such a huge commotion has occurred here, War Blood’s members will definitely come over. If they find us here, they might take us for members of other adventurer teams and kill us,” the Level 122 Shield Warrior standing beside the Ranger youth said, nodding in agreement. While the players on this Advanced Speedboat were conversing with each other, Shi Feng and his companions, around 100 yards away, heard every word of their conversation.

“So, this place is near Dragonheart Island.” Shi Feng revealed a faint smile. “It seems we were lucky. We didn’t get teleported to some dangerous and remote location.”

Space-time teleportation was incredibly random. If they got teleported into a dangerous location, such as a forbidden land or a special location that prevented teleportation, making their way home would be very troublesome.

Nodding, Lifeless Thorn said, “But based on these people’s words, there seems to be quite a struggle occurring on Dragonheart Island.” “That’s normal. With the NPC population growing continuously, the number of NPCs operating at sea would naturally increase. While they might not be as numerous as the landlocked NPCs, they will still outnumber players by a large margin. And with the participation of NPCs, the various powers will definitely struggle even more desperately among themselves for resources,” Shi Feng said, unsurprised by Dragonheart Island’s current state of affairs.

This was because he had received some news from Liang Jing a few days ago. According to her, God’s Domain was truly messed up right now, and NPC forces had even begun taking action against the Guild Towns of players. Although the NPC forces did not directly assault Guild Towns, they still created a lot of trouble inside the Guild Towns. They forced the Guilds running these towns to submit to them and pay a ton of resources and Coins in tribute. Otherwise, they would continue their harassment until the Guild Town imploded.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, many unrated Guilds and third-rate Guilds had no choice but to submit to these NPC forces’ extortion. After all, if these Guilds lacked the income from their Guild Towns, they would truly be doomed.

Now that God’s Domain’s first major update had arrived ahead of schedule, once the NPCs began taking action with full force, even first-rate Guilds and superpowers would have no choice but to pay tribute to the NPC forces to buy time to develop themselves. After all, in God’s Domain, players were merely a minority. One could also say that players were outsiders. Apart from immortality, players did not have any advantages over the original inhabitants of God’s Domain. God’s Domain’s inhabitants far outnumbered players when it came to the top combatants both sides possessed. This would remain true even ten years after God’s Domain’s launch.

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, a hint of anxiety appeared on Yu Luo’s face. Immediately, she took to the skies and flew toward the nearby Advanced Speedboat, her approach giving the six players on the boat a fright. These six players stared at Yu Luo with horrified expressions.

Their reaction was because the ability to fly freely in the sky was unique to players at Tier 4 or above.

Tier 4 players were existences that even NPCs feared. Although there were only a small number of Tier 4 experts in God’s Domain, every one of them was a bigshot capable of shaking heaven and earth with their every move. These Tier 4 experts were not existences ordinary Tier 3 experts like themselves could meet.

“How may I help you, miss?” the Tier 3 Ranger serving as the leader of the party asked respectfully as he looked up at Yu Luo.

The strong were respected in God’s Domain. This fact might not have been evident in the past. However, after experiencing the changes brought by the system’s major update and the various NPCs’ arrogant behavior, these players thoroughly understood that the world of God’s Domain was a much more straightforward and crueler place than the real world. When it came to dealing with Tier 4 powerhouses, if they offended the other party, it wouldn’t be strange for them to get annihilated the next second. They also wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.

“Do you know Heaven’s Blade’s situation?” Yu Luo asked.

Heaven’s Blade was her home. Its well-being had also been a concern for her all this time.

Before she entered the ancient God’s Domain, the competition on Dragonheart Island had already been incredibly intense. Heaven’s Blade had even clashed with several of the island’s top adventurer teams and suffered casualties numbering in the thousands. This was why she had risked grinding and exploring a dangerous location by herself.

Since her disappearance from the modern God’s Domain until now, a month had gone by. Meanwhile, one month was more than enough for the entirety of God’s Domain to undergo significant changes, let alone a small place like Dragonheart Island.

“Heaven’s Blade?” The Ranger youth was surprised and confused by Yu Luo’s question.

“What? Have you never heard of Heaven’s Blade before?” Yu Luo frowned. “Or do you not want to say it?”

As Yu Luo’s voice chilled, the Tier 3 Shield Warrior and the others shuddered involuntarily and looked toward the Ranger youth. They didn’t know whether they should speak up. Although Yu Luo hadn’t revealed any killing intent thus far, her aura alone was already more than enough to instill fear in them.

After all, they had personally witnessed just how powerful a Tier 4 player could be. A Tier 4 player could kill hundreds of Tier 3 players with just the flip of a hand.

The silence had stretched out for a second when the Ranger youth wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead and said hurriedly, “Miss, you misunderstand me. It’s not that I refuse to tell you. It’s just that this matter is already common knowledge in God’s Domain. I was just wondering why you would ask such a question, miss.”

“Common knowledge in God’s Domain?” Yu Luo couldn’t help feeling a little confused.

According to Shi Feng, before his group entered the ancient God’s Domain, nothing big had happened to Heaven’s Blade. It had simply been competing with Dragonheart Island’s several top adventurer teams for resources as usual.

Shi Feng had left the modern God’s Domain only a few days ago. Logically, nothing significant should have happened to Heaven’s Blade.

“That’s right. This incident caused quite the commotion back then. It affected over a dozen superpowers,” the Ranger said, nodding. “Three days ago, through some unknown means, not only did War Blood enter into an alliance with one of Dragonheart Island’s local NPC forces, but someone from War Blood also got promoted to Tier 4. As a result, War Blood’s influence on the island skyrocketed, and even Thirteen Thrones suffered losses at the hands of War Blood.”

“What about Heaven’s Blade?” Yu Luo asked.

“Heaven’s Blade...” The Ranger hesitated to answer because he knew that the Tier 4 powerhouse before him was definitely related to Heaven’s Blade. After taking a deep breath, he continued, “Heaven’s Blade disbanded two days ago.”

“Disbanded?” Yu Luo was stunned. “How is this possible?!”

She had developed from the ground up together with Heaven’s Blade, and the adventurer team was basically her home. Yet, now, she was being told that Heaven’s Blade had disbanded?

At this moment, let alone Yu Luo, even Shi Feng was stunned when he overheard the Ranger’s words from a distance.

Heaven’s Blade was one of Dragonheart Island’s top five adventurer teams. Not only did the adventurer team boast close to ten peak experts under its command, but its commander, Zwei, was even one of Dragonheart Island’s top three MTs.

In the past, Zwei had also been a legendary figure, and she had developed Heaven’s Blade into an overlord-like existence in God’s Domain.

Hence, hearing that Heaven’s Blade had actually disbanded now came as a shock to him.

“If Heaven’s Blade disbanded, where did Heaven’s Blade’s executives go?” Suppressing the emotions in her heart and doing her best to stay calm, Yu Luo asked in a quivering voice, “Where did Commander Zwei and the others

go?”

Shaking his head, the Ranger replied, “This, I do not know. I only know that Heaven’s Blade seems to have enraged War Blood. War Blood is still hunting down Heaven’s Blade’s members even now, going as far as sealing off Dragonheart Island. People on Dragonheart Island can’t contact the outside world. Even those seeking to leave Dragonheart Island need to go through War Blood’s inspection. If I were to guess, Heaven’s Blade’s executives have probably left Dragonheart Island and already gone somewhere else to develop.”

“I understand. You may go now!”

Yu Luo could no longer remain calm after listening to the Ranger’s words. After waving her hand at the party of six, indicating that they were free to continue with their business, she turned around and flew back to Shi Feng’s group. After hearing Yu Luo’s words, the party of six felt like death-row prisoners who had just been granted amnesty. Hurriedly, they sailed away from the area on their Advanced Speedboat, not daring to remain for even a moment longer lest Yu Luo change her mind and vent her anger on them. “Yu Luo, what do you plan to do now?” Shi Feng asked as he took in Yu Luo’s downcast expression. According to their original plan, they would go their separate ways after returning to the modern era. However, it turned out that Heaven’s Blade had disbanded. And Yu Luo probably couldn’t save Heaven’s Blade by herself.

“Me?” Shi Feng’s question left Yu Luo at a loss. “I don’t know.”

The modern God’s Domain she was familiar with no longer existed, so she didn’t know what she should do.

“Since that’s the case, why don’t we go take a look at Dragonheart Island for now?” Shi Feng suggested. “I still have some matters to deal with on Dragonheart Island. Meanwhile, although Heaven’s Blade has disbanded, I believe Commander Zwei and Heaven’s Blade’s other executives wouldn’t leave the island so easily. After all, their foundation and all their resources are on Dragonheart Island. It would be difficult for them to decide to change their base of operations within a short period. So, once we reach Dragonheart Island, you might be able to contact them.”

Yu Luo’s eyes immediately glowed at Shi Feng’s words. She felt that what he said was indeed true. Heaven’s Blade’s members had been residing on Dragonheart Island for such a long time now. How could they possibly just pack up and leave?

Not to mention, even if Heaven’s Blade was no more, she could still contact Commander Zwei and the others. After all, unlike the ancient God’s Domain, long-range communication between players was possible in the modern God’s Domain.

“Okay. I’ll follow you, Guild Leader Black Flame.” Yu Luo nodded.

Afterward, Shi Feng opened a Spatial Gate and teleported toward Dragonheart Island.
