Chapter 2168 – Not Like a Superpower, But Superior

Once the seal on Stone Forest City had lifted, Shi Feng began to draft a construction plan for the city.

Although Stone Forest Town had already contained a lot of buildings, it had grown several times after its promotion. As a result, Stone Forest City looked empty and could, at most, only accommodate 1,000,000 players.

This was the downside to a promoted city. A built city, on the other hand, didn’t have this problem.

Although Stone Forest Town had more than enough buildings to accommodate visiting players, its visitors wouldn’t be limited to experts as mainstream players reached higher levels and improved their equipment. Eventually, even ordinary players would be able to grind in the Bottomless Abyss’s first floor with ease.

It was necessary to plan the city’s constructions ahead of time to ensure that players had what they needed to live and rest in Stone Forest City. Not only would careful planning increase the value of the city’s Shops and private housing, but it was also of the utmost importance for the city’s development.

While Shi Feng planned the city’s layout in the City Lord’s Mansion, the powers from the kingdoms and empires near the Ancient Undead Forest received news of Stone Forest City’s grand opening.

For a time, these powers were in an uproar.

“Zero Wing is actually opening such a precious city to the public?! Has the Guild gone mad?!”

“How generous!”

“That’s a God Mode Regional Dungeon we’re talking about! I can’t believe Zero Wing is letting just anyone into the city! Just what is Zero Wing thinking?”

The many powers that had watched the battle for Stone Forest City knew how significant the city was. Whoever owned Stone Forest City would have a massive advantage when exploring the Bottomless Abyss.

However, Zero Wing so willingly gave up this advantage, granting the public access to such a valuable city...

Even the various superpowers were stunned by Zero Wing’s decision.

They had known that the Guild would open Stone Forest City to the public sooner or later. Reaching the Bottomless Abyss’s first floor wasn’t particularly difficult, and even experts from first-rate Guilds and peak adventurer teams would be strong enough to grind in the area after another ten days or so.

Once they were, Stone Forest City wouldn’t be nearly as much of an advantage. Even if Zero Wing wanted to avoid doing so, it would have to open the city to the public to earn a little money. The city’s potential income would be far more important to the Guild than limiting access to its members and allies.

However, the various superpowers hadn’t dreamed that Zero Wing would open Stone Forest City’s gates so soon. Essentially, doing so now was throwing away any advantage the city could provide.

“A God Mode Regional Dungeon? This is a perfect opportunity to strengthen our adventurer team!”

“Zero Wing is truly amazing. It’s giving up such a massive advantage. Not even superpowers would dare to make such a sacrifice. Since no one’s explored the Bottomless Abyss yet, we can advance our Guild’s development if we can claim some of its treasures for ourselves.”

The various kingdoms and empires’ powers sprung into action the moment they heard of Stone Forest City’s opening. They all dispatched expert teams to the city.

The various superpowers occupied most of God’s Domain’s high-resource maps, and that should’ve been the case for the Bottomless Abyss as well. Superpowers had far better weapons and equipment for their members than ordinary powers, and by the time the ordinary powers were able to explore the Regional Dungeon, the various superpowers would’ve likely combed through the Dungeon.

Now that Stone Forest City was open to the public, however, ordinary powers could share the starting line with the various superpowers in the competition for the Bottomless Abyss’s resources. Although the superpowers still had a massive advantage in terms of combat power and equipment standards, it was the fairest condition that ordinary players could hope for.

If these ordinary powers got lucky in the Bottomless Abyss, they might be able to elevate their development to a new level. The Regional Dungeon was the current frontline in God’s Domain, and needless to say, the loot within would be among the best available at this stage of the game.

Because of this news, Zero Wing’s Residence in White River City had become more crowded than ever before. Players joined the growing crowd outside of the Residence’s entrance almost as fast as the seconds ticked by. They filled the several streets around the Residence, stupefying players who visited the city for the first time.

Meanwhile, Unyielding Heart and Mu Lingsha, who had finally made it into the Residence, couldn’t stifle their rueful sighs as they observed the current atmosphere within.

Although powers seeking refuge or alliances visited the various superpowers’ Residences as well, their traffic was nothing compared to the number of representatives currently in Zero Wing’s Residence.

They had already counted more than 100 representatives thus far, including upper echelons from first- and second- rate Guilds.

First- and second-rate Guilds might be insignificant to the various superpowers, but that was only true when two or three of these Guilds gathered. If dozens of first- and second-rate Guilds banded together, not even a Super Guild could afford to underestimate them.

Unyielding Heart and Mu Lingsha even felt as if their positions had been reversed. It felt as if Zero Wing were the superpower here, and Unyielding Soul was simply an ordinary power seeking refuge...

Almost every first- and second-rate Guild upper echelon in the Residence felt the same.

They had all assumed that they stood on equal footing with Zero Wing and that the Guild wasn’t yet a superpower, even if it were stronger than a first-rate Guild.

But looking at it now, they realized how naive the thought was.

Although Zero Wing might not have the strength of a superpower, it possessed a foundation that no superpower could match. Despite its lower status, it was, in fact, more powerful.

Bottomless Abyss, Stone Forest City:

After working in the City Lord’s Mansion for nearly two hours, Shi Feng received a call from Aqua Rose and Gentle Snow.

“Guild Leader, over 100 powers have visited our Residence in the Black Dragon Empire to discuss potential cooperation. Five of them are first-rate Guilds, and 17 are second-rate Guilds. Should we agree to their offers?” Gentle Snow asked.

“We’re seeing roughly the same situation in White River City, Guild Leader, although two superpowers have also visited. One of them is Unyielding Soul. Both superpowers are requesting garrison rights in Stone Forest City, and they’ve offered considerable benefits in exchange,” Aqua Rose said, unable to contain her excitement.

If Zero Wing accepted the benefits these Guilds offered, the Guild would undergo a qualitative transformation. Although it couldn’t match a superpower’s reach, it wasn’t far off.

“So many powers have visited?” Even Shi Feng was a little surprised to hear the two Vice Guild Leaders’ reports.

Although he had recognized how tempting Stone Forest City would be to the various powers, he hadn’t expected it to attack so many.

“What should we do, Guild Leader?” Aqua Rose and Gentle Snow asked, staring at Shi Feng as they desperately waited for his answer.

Too many powers had approached the Guild for partnerships for them to handle. Even if Stone Forest City was a Basic City, it couldn’t accommodate so many Guilds. It would be fortunate if the city house a total of five Guilds right now.

“Since so many powers have approached us, it would be a waste to turn them away.” After giving the matter some thought, Shi Feng grinned and said, “The various superpowers have their own Chamber of Commerce. In that case, Zero Wing will establish its own. We’ll call it the Candlelight Chamber of Commerce. If these powers want a partnership, they’ll have to join our Chamber first. Then, we’ll cooperate as members of a Chamber of Commerce typically do.”

Zero Wing had certainly benefited from its membership with the Secret Chamber of Commerce, but after getting kicked out once already, Shi Feng knew that Zero Wing needed a Chamber of its own.

Zero Wing hadn’t had been able to fulfill the conditions of creating a Chamber of Commerce previously, but now that the ability to do so presented itself, he couldn’t miss this opportunity.

“What if they demand to garrison in the city?” Aqua Rose had already spoken with quite a few major powers’ representatives, so she knew that they aimed to secure a Residence in the city for their Guilds. Unfortunately, simply joining the Candlelight Chamber of Commerce wouldn’t fulfill that wish, in which case, these powers might refuse to join.

“We’ll follow the Secret Chamber of Commerce’s example then. They will only gain the right to garrison in Stone Forest City if they join the Candlelight Chamber of Commerce as advanced members. Normal members, on the other hand, will enjoy a 20% discount on the city’s entry fees,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “The more they contribute, the more they will gain. I’m sure they won’t have any complaints.”

Aqua Rose and Gentle Snow’s eyes glowed with elation and realization upon hearing Shi Feng’s decision.

This was undoubtedly a solid solution. If this plan succeeded, Zero Wing’s sales channels would reach unprecedented heights. Not even ordinary superpowers would be a match for it. Even without Stone Forest City’s profits, the Guild would be able to develop smoothly by relying on the income from the Candlelight Chamber of Commerce.
