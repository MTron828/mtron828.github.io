Chapter 211 – Zero Wing’s Retaliation

At Shi Feng’s command, everyone hesitated for a moment before drinking the Hypersensitivity Potion in their hands.

Immediately, the Mana in the lobby thinned out significantly. At the same time, everyone who drank the Hypersensitivity Potion revealed ecstatic expressions on their faces.

“So this is the hypersensitive state?”

“Amazing! Amazing! I can perceive everything around me clearly, even with my eyes closed! It’s like I’ve reached the Void Realm!”

“I’m finding it much easier to use the combat techniques I used to have trouble using!”

Under the hypersensitive state, Zero Wing’s and Twilight Echo’s young talents quickly realized their shortcomings. Some even gave in to their urges and started practicing combat techniques on the spot.

Seeing the excited youngsters, Blackie, who stood behind Shi Feng, quietly nodded to express his understanding.

Blackie had already experienced the Hypersensitivity Potion’s wondrous effect while in the Stratified Abyssal Realm. Not only did the potion enhance the user’s five senses by a significant margin, but it also improved the user’s perception of Mana. While under the hypersensitive state, he had managed to hold his ground against even the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s second-floor experts.

Combined with the training he did at the Elven Holy Spring, his combat standard was already close to reaching the second-floor standard. Thanks to the Hypersensitivity Potion, he was improving so rapidly that even he found it unbelievable.

Unfortunately, Blackie’s talent was only subpar, after all was said and done. Compared to Fire Cloud, Happy Snow, Rampant Blade, and Su Qianliu, the improvements Blackie achieved in the Stratified Abyssal Realm could be considered the smallest. This was because the other four had already reached the second-floor standard.

Su Qianliu, in particular, had already become a bona fide Void Realm expert after sparring with the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s many second- and third-floor experts. She had also stepped into the Truth Realm, now capable of exhibiting the power of a basic combat technique with her every action. She had even passed the trial for Novice Temple Knights, becoming an official Novice Temple Knight of Slumber City.

As for Happy Snow, Fire Cloud, and Rampant Blade, although they still had a little trouble completing the Novice Temple Knight’s trial, they were already bona fide second-floor experts.

“Quiet!” Shi Feng yelled, causing everyone in the lobby to quiet down. “I want all of you to head out and prepare recovery items immediately. We will be entering the primordial ruins for a big fight in ten minutes. This is a chance for all of you to grow, so I hope you can cherish it. I will also be giving the top 20 best performing players an additional Hypersensitivity Potion!”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, the many youngsters present cheered in excitement. After using the Hypersensitivity Potion, every one of them was eager to engage in battle so that they could maximize their use of the potion’s effects and refine their combat techniques. So, now that Shi Feng had announced that not only would they be participating in a big fight, but the top 20 best performing players would also receive an additional Hypersensitivity Potion, how could they not get excited?

“I just hit the jackpot! If I can make good use of these twelve hours, I might even achieve a breakthrough and reach the Flowing Water Realm! I’ll instantly become one of Twilight Echo’s top 10 newcomers!”

“If those who laughed at us for having to take part in Zero Wing’s special training learn about this, they’ll probably regret that they didn’t volunteer themselves when Elder Aqua was choosing people.”

Twilight Echo’s peak geniuses whispered among themselves in joy and excitement while preparing the recovery items needed for the upcoming battle. They also felt delighted when they recalled how their peers in Twilight Echo, who were not chosen to attend Zero Wing’s special training, had made fun of them.

“I’m going to make it into the top 20 no matter what!” Soaring Cloud, the callous youth from Twilight Echo, muttered to himself as he looked toward Shi Feng, a hint of ambition in his eyes. “So long as I can get another Hypersensitivity Potion, I will definitely become the number one genius in Twilight Echo!”

After getting a feel of the Hypersensitivity Potion’s effects, Soaring Cloud was certain that he could reach even the Void Realm within a short period of time, let alone the Flowing Water Realm. Right now, he even had the urge to fight against true Void Realm experts to capitalize on the potion’s effects.

Ten minutes later, Shi Feng led everyone to the teleportation point for the primordial ruins. Then, he spent nearly half of the teleportation tokens Zero Wing had accumulated previously to send everyone into the primordial ruins.

...

At the same time as Shi Feng and the others entered the primordial ruins, news of their actions quickly reached the ears of the Miniature Ancient World’s various powers, shocking them.

“Is Zero Wing insane? They’re entering the primordial ruins at this time? Don’t they know that the Flower of Seven Sins’ members are lying in wait there?”

“Interesting! Zero Wing’s members have mainly been operating around Abyssal Star City previously. Now that so many of them have entered the primordial ruins, we can use this opportunity to capitalize on the Flower of Seven Sins’ bounty!”

Shortly after Shi Feng’s team entered the primordial ruins, the various powers and independent experts operating around Hundred Flow City also began to move.

The Flower of Seven Sins had put a public bounty on all of Zero Wing’s members. It was even offering S-rank Nutrient Fluids in exchange for the heads of Zero Wing’s core members, with twenty heads being worth one bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid.

S-rank Nutrient Fluids were a resource highly sought after by the various powers and countless expert players. Now that a team of more than 500 Zero Wing members had entered the primordial ruins, it was the perfect opportunity to take advantage of the Flower of Seven Sins’ bounty. Moreover, according to the information collected, every Zero Wing member in this team possessed extraordinary strength, so they should be the Guild’s core members.

For a time, over a dozen first-rate powers, several superpowers, and over ten thousand Refinement Realm experts flooded into the primordial ruins.

...

Abyssal Star City, Asura’s headquarters, top-floor conference room:

“You’re finally back, Chief Administrator Soul. Something big has come up on Zero Wing’s side. For some reason, Zero Wing has suddenly dispatched a large number of experts into the primordial ruins. Currently, over a dozen first-rate powers and several superpowers have already sent their experts after them. We need to hurry over and reinforce Zero Wing’s experts. Otherwise, if Zero Wing loses all those experts, Asura will have an even harder time resisting the Flower of Seven Sins,” Liu Wusheng, who was dressed in a white robe, said anxiously when he saw Hidden Soul entering the conference room.

As the levels of the various powers’ experts increased, the number of superpowers setting their sights on Abyssal Star City also increased. If not for Asura offering Lineage Crystals up for exchange and attracting quite a number of superpowers to stand on the mercenary alliance’s side, the mercenary alliance would have long since collapsed under the Flower of Seven Sins’ pressure.

Now that players were getting closer and closer to the minimum level required to explore the Boundary Mountain Range’s labyrinth, it’d be terrible for Asura if Zero Wing suddenly had a large number of its experts killed. After all, exploring the Boundary Mountain Range was Asura’s only chance at stabilizing its situation. If the Flower of Seven Sins were to get ahead and produce Tier 4 experts sooner than Asura, the mercenary alliance would be at great risk of losing Abyssal Star City.

“We don’t have to go. Zero Wing should be able to deal with it on its own,” Hidden Soul said, smiling as she shook her head. “Rather than Zero Wing, the powers that have gone after Zero Wing are the ones that need to be careful. Provoking Zero Wing at this juncture is a very risky action.”
