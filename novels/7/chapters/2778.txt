Chapter 2779 – Astonishing Improvements

According to Shi Feng’s understanding, few players and NPCs from Meteorite City and other nearby cities were willing to come to the Antimagic Volcano to grind and explore. Several factors contributed to this situation.

Firstly, the thin Mana environment here prevented players and NPCs from exhibiting the power of their Skills and Spells to their fullest extent. This, in turn, would put players and NPCs at a severe disadvantage against monsters.

Secondly, what little Mana there was in the Antimagic Volcano was incredibly chaotic, which made it nigh-impossible to control. Hence, doing combat here would not allow one to improve their control over Mana.

Thirdly and most importantly, the monsters inhabiting the Antimagic Volcano consisted solely of fire-type elemental creatures and beasts. These monsters had a combat power a lot higher than the average monster’s. In addition, they existed in large numbers in the Antimagic Volcano. Even a 1,000-man team of Tier 3 players would have difficulty staying alive in this map, let alone grinding for EXP.

However, unlike other players, Shi Feng considered this neutral map the perfect leveling spot for him.

This place really is amazing. There are actually so many Great Lords and Grand Lords here. As Shi Feng looked down at the wandering monsters while hovering in midair, he couldn’t help a little excitement. With this, I won’t have to worry about not having enough Crystals of Souls.

(Volcanic Behemoth) (Demonic Beast, Grand Lord)

Level 139

HP 3,600,000,000

[Infernal Warlord) (Elemental Creature, Great Lord)

Level 137

HP 1,320,000,000 [Infernal Chieftain] (Elemental Creature, Grand Lord)

HP 3,100,000,000

Shi Feng had to admit that the Antimagic Volcano was a sight to behold. This neutral map teemed with Great Lord ranked monsters. Moreover, they moved in large groups of 100 or more closely positioned to each other. If one made too much of a commotion when fighting a group of monsters here, one would easily attract monsters from other areas.

However, despite the high difficulty of this map, it was the perfect grinding spot for Tier 4 existences, specifically Tier 4 experts with a Mana Domain.

Shi Feng charged at the Volcanic Behemoth, the strongest monster in sight, without hesitation.

The next moment, when Shi Feng got within 300 yards of the Volcanic Behemoth, the Grand Lord in question noticed his presence. Immediately, the 30-meter-tall beast covered in flaming scales let loose a deafening roar. The roar instantly attracted the wandering and resting Volcanic Beasts, and over 3,000 Volcanic Beasts converged on the Volcanic Behemoth’s location in the blink of an eye. The majority of these Volcanic Beasts were Level 135-plus Lords, with some of them Great Lords.

Even a 1,000-man team composed of Tier 3 experts of the same level would falter when faced with so many Volcanic Beasts. After all, not only were these monsters moving in an organized manner, but the Mana their bodies radiated also showed faint signs of synchronizing, which would double the power of the fire-type Spells they cast.

Suddenly, thousands of fiery attacks shot into the air, heading toward Shi Feng.

Although the attacks were not fully synchronized with each other, the sheer number still allowed them to exhibit power at the Tier 4 standard. That was more than enough to deter any ordinary Tier 4 combatant from tanking the attacks.

“Come!”

However, when Shi Feng saw the several thousand attacks coming at him, not only did he not show the slightest sign of fear, but he even displayed excitement.

The next moment, Shi Feng swung his hand and began manipulating his Mana Body’s power. Suddenly, with Shi Feng as the center, a ripple spread into the surroundings. At the same time, a storm brewed in the surrounding space, causing even space to shudder. Boom! Boom! Boom!

For a time, explosions echoed throughout the sky in rapid succession. The sky itself transformed into a sea of flames as the storm annihilated the thousands of fiery attacks.

Afterward, the Volcanic Beasts enveloped by the storm knelt on the ground one after another. Only the Great Lord ranked Volcanic Beasts remained standing. However, standing was pretty much all they could do, as even moving their bodies took grueling effort. As for the Volcanic Behemoth, the leader of the Volcanic Beasts, it didn’t fare that much better than the Great Lord ranked Volcanic Beasts, either.

My Mana Domain has improved to such an extent? Shi Feng was astonished when he saw the thousands of kneeling Volcanic Beasts and the Volcanic Behemoth, which had great difficulty moving His current Mana Domain was actually capable of suppressing even a Grand Lord to such an extent. Despite being a Strength-based Demonic Beast, the Volcanic Behemoth had barely half of its mobility left. If he used his Mana Domain against Agility-based Demonic Creatures, the suppression effect would most likely be even more prominent.

After a moment reveling in the improvement of his Mana Domain, Shi Feng stopped being polite with the Volcanic Beasts. Immediately, he activated Blade Domain and began slaughtering the Volcanic Beasts with the seven summoned magic swords.

All his attacks dealt damage in the tens of millions, with critical hits causing over a hundred million damage. In the case of the Lord ranked Volcanic Beasts, which had only several hundred million HP, they fell after just two or three hits.

In the end, it took Shi Feng less than half an hour to annihilate the 3,000-plus Volcanic Beasts. Even the Volcanic Behemoth failed to escape his grasp.

Since Shi Feng fought monsters of a higher level, his experience bar skyrocketed after the battle ended. Of course, as he had already reached Tier 4, monsters at the Lord rank and below granted him diminished EXP; only those at the Great Lord rank and above granted him normal amounts of EXP.

This could be considered one of the disadvantages of getting promoted to Tier 4.

Even so, Shi Feng still reached 34% of Level 127 after the battle. His leveling speed was simply phenomenal. At this rate, he could easily level up twice by the end of the day.

However, he wasn’t the slightest bit surprised by this situation.

In God’s Domain, after one reached Tier 4, leveling up became a very simple task. All one needed to do was search for places with a lot of monsters.

Hence, in the past, Tier 4 players would complain about the lack of grinding spots in God’s Domain. Often, the task of searching for monsters was much more troublesome for Tier 4 players than the task of killing monsters. What was even more troublesome was collecting the monsters’ loot. The time it took to collect the loot of the monsters they killed was several times longer than the time it took to kill the monsters.

Sure enough, the loot collection process is much more tiresome than the grinding process. Shi Feng got a headache when he saw all the loot scattered within a 1,000-yard radius of himself.

At this moment, he finally understood the suffering of those Tier 4 experts in the past.

However, ignoring the loot wasn’t an option, either. After all, these monsters dropped considerably excellent loot. Among the items dropped were standard Magic Crystals, fire-attributed Magic Crystals, and various rare ores. The fire-attributed Magic Crystals were especially valuable, worth far more than the standard Magic Crystal.

Attributed Magic Crystals were essential in the production of certain Epic Weapons and Equipment. Some Peak Constructions also required attributed Magic Crystals to build. However, attributed Magic Crystals were incredibly rare in the modern God’s Domain. Hence, it would be a massive waste to simply ignore the loot.

Shi Feng ended up spending two whole hours gathering all of the items scattered across the battlefield. However, he had to admit that he had earned a huge harvest. Even if he ignored the numerous Level 130 Bronze, Mysterious-Iron, Secret-Silver, and Fine-Gold Weapons and Equipment he got, just the Magic Crystals numbered over 4,000 already. He had also picked up over 300 fire-attributed Magic Crystals.

Afterward, he killed several more groups of monsters in the Antimagic Volcano, pushing his level from 127 to 128, the total number of Magic Crystals collected to beyond 30,000, and the number of fire-attributed Magic Crystals collected to 1,500. Be it his leveling speed or money-making speed, both exceeded the standard of ordinary Tier 4 players.

Since the sky was darkening, Shi Feng found a safe cave and called up his system interface.

That’s enough for today. With several more days’ grinding here, I should be able to exceed the average level of the peak experts here. By then, I shouldn’t be at a disadvantage in levels when the Infant Dragon raid takes place. When Shi Feng saw that he had already reached 19% of Level 128, he found his leveling speed very satisfactory.

Not to mention, he had managed to produce seven Crystals of Souls through today’s grind Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

– far more than what he could produce in the modern God’s Domain.

Afterward, Shi Feng logged out of the game to rest. After all, he had already spent more than 24 hours online. Even if he was using the Fearless Cabin now, staying online for long periods still wasn’t wise.

Once he went offline, before he could even climb out of his cabin, a message notification sounded in his cabin.

The message’s sender was none other than Liang Jing, the person managing Zero Wing’s headquarters on his behalf right now.

“Guild Leader, you finally decided to pick up!” Liang Jing said in exasperation. “I’ve already brought the two Vice Guild Leaders to Yuantian City as per your request. What should we do now?”

“You’re here already?” Surprised by Liang Jing’s swift action, Shi Feng chuckled and said, “Okay, bring them to the Upper Zone’s entrance now. I’ll wait for you there.”

“The Upper Zone’s entrance?” Liang Jing couldn’t help growing a little excited at Shi Feng’s words. “Okay! We’ll be there in three hours!”

Shi Feng burst into laughter at Liang Jing’s excited expression. However, he understood her mood. After all, the Upper Zone was a place countless people yearned to enter. But this is a problem. I only managed to get 100 points yesterday, even after exchanging all of the Credits I had. If the two of them join me, I can’t even afford food for the three of us. It seems I’ll have to convert those 5,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal now. The thought of the food prices here gave Shi Feng a headache.

Fortunately, he had earned a killing from Mythology. Otherwise, he would have to start begging for food.

Shi Feng tidied himself up and hurried to the Green God Tower.
