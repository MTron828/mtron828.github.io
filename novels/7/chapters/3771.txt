Added a sentence to the Abyssal Eye’s description:

It is a naturally occurring Abyssal Relic composed of the power of the Abyss.

TL’s interpretation: An Abyssal Relic (深渊神物) can be considered the Abyss’s version of a Godly Relic (神物 / 神器).

Zero Wing’s Residence, Guild Leader’s Office:

When Shi Feng agreed to repair the Abyssal Eye, one of his rings suddenly shattered into black tendrils and wrapped around the dark silver eyeball in Shi Feng’s hand. Meanwhile, the previously dull-looking eyeball suddenly moved, its pupil contracting and dilating like a pulsating heart. Following this rhythm, spatial ripples spread from the Primordial Abyssal Eye and the black tendrils, turning the office space into a dark void.

A few seconds later, the dark silver eyeball morphed into a swarm of dark silver divine runes, which flowed into the black tendrils and repaired their fractured divine patterns. When the last divine rune disappeared, the spatial ripples subsided, and a gold ring etched with layers of silver divine patterns appeared in Shi Feng’s palm.

Thank goodness Shadowring Town isn’t an ordinary Guild Town. Shi Feng sighed in relief as he looked at the void around him and his office’s magic barrier.

The magic barrier that protected his office could withstand a bombardment from Tier 6 attacks. Yet, it had cracked when the spatial ripples struck it. The power of the spatial ripples could already rival that of Tier 6 Curses. If these spatial ripples had appeared in the average Guild Town, they would have demolished the entire town. Even the average Guild City might not survive.

Recovering from his surprise, Shi Feng directed his gaze to the Abyssal Eye in his palm.

Possession of the Abyssal Lord. It is a naturally occurring Abyssal Relic composed of the power of the Abyss. It has the power to control the Abyss.

Tier 7?

The Abyssal Eye’s updated stats dumbfounded Shi Feng.

The highest known tier that could appear in the current human race’s Greater God’s Domain was Tier 6. Even the mighty Ancient Gods could only use up to Tier 6 Taboo Skills and Curses. No person or object could exceed this limit. Not even Divine Artifacts could do so.

Thus, the existence of Tier 7 Skills and Spells was as illusory as Primordial Gods. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call them myths.

No wonder I have to kill the Undying Mother! As Shi Feng looked at the repaired Abyssal Eye, he suddenly understood why Enos had given him such an unreasonable quest.

Considering how Skills and Spells were categorized, Tier 6 Taboo Skills and Curses should theoretically be comparable to Tier 7 Skills and Spells. However, Shi Feng felt otherwise when he weighed the difference in strength between Ancient Gods and Primordial Gods.

Thus, while the Undying Mother might be an existence that Ancient Gods feared, it would most likely end up dead or heavily injured if struck by a Tier 7 Skill or Spell. If the Undying Mother became heavily injured, killing it would become much easier.

It’s a pity Dark Cluster has a twenty-day Cooldown.

Shi Feng was slightly disappointed as he looked at the Abyssal Ring’s first Skill. If Dark Cluster had a shorter cooldown, like ten days or so, he could have tested it out before the fight against the Undying Mother. Now, he could only fly blind.

After inspecting the Abyssal Eye’s stats, Shi Feng equipped it with great expectation. Immediately, he felt an unprecedented sense of relief spread across his body, and the surrounding void started to warp in his presence.

As expected of an Abyssal Relic! Shi Feng was astonished when he checked his stats. Now, my Basic Attributes are already at the standard of a Level 220, Tier 6 expert equipped with two Divine Artifacts!

In God’s Domain, as long as players had Level 200-plus equipment, they could expect the Basic Attributes their equipment granted to increase by at least 10% for every five levels they climbed beyond Level 200. Thus, a massive difference existed between a Level 200 player’s Basic Attributes and a Level 220 player’s Basic Attributes.

Currently, his level just so happened to be at Level 200. With his Superior Divine Body, the Shadow Incinerator, the upgraded God Chaser Set, which granted him the Basic Attributes of a full set of Level 220 Legendary Equipment, the Dragon’s Fury Secret Treasure Set, etc., he could easily match the Basic Attributes of a Level 200, Tier 6 player equipped with three Divine Artifacts.

Nevertheless, his Basic Attributes still weren’t up to the Level 220 standard. More specifically, he remained slightly inferior to a Level 220, Tier 6 player fully equipped with Legendary Equipment and armed with a Divine Weapon.

However, after he equipped the Abyssal Eye, his Basic Attributes skyrocketed, pushing him to heights he had never achieved, even in his previous life. Based on his estimates, he should now match Level 220, Tier 6 experts equipped with two Divine Artifacts in Basic Attributes.

…

Shortly after Shi Feng finished redecorating his office, Red Frost arrived.

“Guild Leader, let’s go. If we wait any longer, we might be late for our meeting with Yilong,” Red Frost urged when she saw Shi Feng counting Seven Luminaries Crystals.

“Okay.” Shi Feng nodded and put away the nearly 200 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal he had received from Hidden Soul. Then, he activated a World-Breaking Gate to the Starlight Realm.

After crossing the World-Breaking Gate and entering the Void Sea, Red Frost promptly took out a purple-red scroll made from dragon hide.

The dragon skin scroll was like a living Tier 6 Dragon. When Red Frost unfurled it, it unleashed a roar that scared most of the Tier 5 and Tier 6 players within a hundred thousand yards into fleeing. Only a few Tier 6 teams dared to resist the flow, carefully approaching the source of the roar.

However, when these Tier 6 teams reached the source, Shi Feng and Red Frost had long since disappeared from the Void Sea. All that remained was a collapsing and shrinking teleportation passage that radiated powerful Mana and Dragon Might.
