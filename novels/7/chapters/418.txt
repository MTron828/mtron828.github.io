Chapter 419 - Mysterious Guests

“Guild Leader?”

Fire Dance activated Wind Steps and rushed over to the fallen Shi Feng.

Flying Shadow, on the other hand, was completely stunned by what he had seen.

He was still in a complete daze.

“Guild Leader, what’s wrong?” Fire Dance asked, panicking as she looked at Shi Feng’s pale complexion.

Ultimately, God’s Domain was only a game. Even if a player entered a weakened state, only their Attributes would decrease. The debuff definitely would not weaken a player’s mental state.

“It’s nothing. I’m just tired; that’s all,” Shi Feng muttered a reply. “I’m going to enter System Sleep Mode to rest for now. You two take care of the loot and meet back up with Aqua. Remember, continue to grind in the gorge and do not go anywhere else.”

The Battle Monkey Commander was not an ordinary Chieftain. It was a Chieftain found inside the White Fog Canyon, far different than other Chieftains. Without Void Steps, even if Fire Dance and the others joined hands to fight it, they would inevitably have to flee.

If Shi Feng had not used Void Steps during his battle, defeat would have been his only outcome.

Shi Feng’s mental capacity had long since reached its limit. Now that he had used Void Steps again, he had exceeded that limit.

Nothing good would come from a player exceeding their own mental limit. Hence, the Main God System would automatically send an official warning, suggesting the player to enter Sleep Mode.

Players could recover their mental capacity while in Sleep Mode. In reality, it was exactly the same as sleeping. Only, while resting in Sleep Mode, players could recover more thoroughly.

After instructing Fire Dance, Shi Feng entered Sleep Mode and logged out of the game to rest.

“Sister Fire Dance, what happened?” Flying Dance asked curiously when he saw Shi Feng log off as soon as he arrived.

“Guild Leader is exhausted and has logged off to rest. Let’s tidy up the drops here and return to the gorge,” Fire Dance said, sighing relief.

“Logged off to rest?” Flying Dance was surprised, his mind riddled with questions.

This was the first time he had heard of a player needing to log off to rest due to a battle.

Flying Shadow had once tried to grind continuously for over ten hours. Although he was tired after his endeavor, he was fine after he ate some food and went to the hotel to rest. Now, Shi Feng actually needed to log off and rest.

However, after giving it some thought, Flying Shadow found nothing strange about this situation.

After all, despite the Battle Monkey Warchief being such a powerful monster, Shi Feng had soloed it with that mystifying move. It was unbelievable. Hence, it was not at all strange that it would take such a toll on his Guild Leader. On the contrary, it was perfectly reasonable.

It would be awesome if I could learn that move! Flying Dance was still fascinated when he thought back to Shi Feng’s battle. But I think it will be very difficult to convince Guild Leader to teach me such a powerful move...”

No! I cannot give up! As long as I contribute more to Zero Wing, Guild Leader might agree to teach me if I ask!

Flying Shadow’s loyalty towards Zero Wing soared once more. He inwardly vowed to contribute his all to Zero Wing.

After swiftly collecting the loot of the Battle Monkey Warchief, Fire Dance noticed Flying Shadow’s dazed expression. At this sight, she could not help but chuckle, saying, “Flying Shadow, stop daydreaming. We’re going back to the gorge.”

Fire Dance could, more or less, understand Flying Shadow’s thoughts.

A player soloing a berserk Level 25 Chieftain in God’s Domain was undeniably a miracle. Furthermore, the mysterious technique Shi Feng had used shattered the common ideas everyone had of battles in God’s Domain. Hence, how could she blame him for being mystified?

Compared to Flying Shadow, Fire Dance had a far more profound experience of the battle.

She was connecting to the game using a virtual gaming cabin, so she could see and feel the formidableness of Void Steps clearly.

The benefits she obtained from watching this battle had exceeded what she had gained from watching over a hundred battles of other experts.

“Oh.” Flying Shadow followed hurriedly after he recovered his wits.

After Shi Feng logged off, the members of Zero Wing took up residence in the gorge. They did not go anywhere else, luring and killing monsters in the gorge. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The monsters in White Fog Canyon were numerous. Moreover, their loot was similarly bountiful. With a strategic location like the gorge, Zero Wing’s players had nothing to worry about, even if they faced an army of Battle Monkeys.

Their leveling speed here was several times faster than grinding elsewhere. Moreover, they also obtained plenty of equipment and various materials.

However, while Zero Wing peacefully leveled, White River City had exploded with commotion.

After the discovery of a Great Lord in the White Fog Canyon, everyone eagerly awaited news of the various Guilds raiding it successfully.

However, the results were completely unexpected.

Despite having sent so many Level 20 and above elite players, before the various Guilds found the Great Lord, they had lost over half of their players. Suddenly, everyone’s view of the White Fog Canyon had changed.

Many players who had originally intended to rush towards the canyon to grind and level up dismissed their plans at this revelation.

However, although many had given up on the White Fog Canyon, it did not prevent them from discussing it.

Although most of the Guilds in White River City had given up on the White Fog Canyon, Overwhelming Smile, Emperor’s Light, Assassin’s Alliance, Ouroboros, and Zero Wing, the top five Guilds of White River City, still pushed forward in the White Fog Canyon even now.

Everyone had their guesses on which of these five Guilds would be the first to kill the Great Lord.

At this moment, the teleportation array inside White River City’s Teleportation Hall started to flash, and six figures suddenly appeared. The instant these six appeared, they immediately attracted the attention of the players in White River City.

These six people possessed stunning levels. Each one of them was at least Level 25. Among them, one had even reached Level 26; this player had actually surpassed White River City’s highest leveled player, Blackie.

However, this was not the most shocking aspect. The equipment they wore was what truly left others in a daze.

The equipment these players wore gave off the glow effect that only a Fine-Gold Equipment possessed. They also had a few pieces of Dark-Gold Equipment in the mix. The Level 26 Guardian Knight leading this party wore five pieces of Dark-Gold Equipment. Meanwhile, the quality of the Bone Shield on his back was indiscernible. Shockingly, this Guardian Knight possessed over 5,600 HP, an amount that not even the Chief MTs of first-rate Guilds had reached.

Yet, none of these players wore a Guild Emblem on their chests. Clearly, they were independent players.

It was astonishing that independent players had acquired such equipment.

“Boss, the people here are weird. Why are they all staring at us? It’s giving me goosebumps.”

“The country bumpkins here are just envious after seeing our equipment.”

“This place isn’t that bad after all. The average players here are around Level 18 or 19. It’s just slightly lower than ours.”

“Alright, enough. We’re here on official business. First, ask around for information on that One-hit Asura.”

Having their objective, the party of six exited the Teleportation Hall.

On the street, any players who encountered this party of six would unconsciously move aside and look away in fear.

Unexpectedly, Shi Feng had slept for more than a day inside the virtual gaming cabin.

“What’s going on?

“Why did I sleep for so long?”

Shi Feng was stunned when he exited the gaming cabin and saw the time.

Shi Feng had several years of experience using the virtual gaming cabin, and this was not his first time exceeding his limit. In the past, he had only slept around half a dozen hours or so. Now, he had actually slept over 30 hours...

This was the first time Shi Feng had encountered such a situation.

“What? Even the Nutrient Solution that’s supposed to last me half a month has bottomed out already?” Before Shi Feng could make sense of the situation, he suddenly heard the virtual gaming cabin launch a warning, notifying him that the cabin’s supply of Nutrient Solution was quickly running out.
