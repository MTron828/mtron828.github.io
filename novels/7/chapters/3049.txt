Chapter 124 – End of an Era

“What is this?”

“Isn’t he just Tier 3?! How can he have such power?!”

“He can already shatter space at Tier 3. Could he be a God-ranked expert?”

When the experts caught outside of Shi Feng’s Mana Domain saw the fragmented void in front of them, they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

They had seen experts shattering space with their attacks before. On the main continent, any Tier 4 expert could easily accomplish such a feat. Some of them even used to be Tier 4 experts on the main continent.

However, the Miniature Ancient World had only opened recently. It was impossible for players to even reach Level 120 at this stage of the game, let alone Tier 4.

Yet, the cloaked man before them had accomplished a feat that could typically only be accomplished by Tier 4 players. With just one singular attack, he had exhibited power on par with Tier 4 Taboo Skills at Tier 3!

At this moment, there was only one plausible explanation everyone could come up with for this unbelievable situation.

A Tier 6 God-ranked expert!

An existence capable of turning the impossible possible!

Shadow is really finished this time… When Rampant Blade saw Shadow’s experts disappearing without a trace, he couldn’t help but turn to look at the proud figures of Su Qianliu and the others, his eyes full of bitterness and lamentation.

In the past, he used to hold the same position as Su Qianliu as one of Shadow’s Five Demon Generals. Yet, in the time it took him to reach the Refinement Realm, Su Qianliu and Blackie had already become existences that even World Dominators found tricky to deal with. The two of them were even capable of killing Refinement Realm experts like ants…

In reality, Rampant Blade had felt that Shi Feng was joking when he heard about the other party’s declaration to erase Shadow from God’s Domain. After all, there was simply too significant of a gap between Shadow and Zero Wing.

Now, however… FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Over 80% of the experts Shadow had dispatched to the Miniature Ancient World had just been killed. On the surface, it might seem as if these experts had just lost a level and a piece of equipment. However, in the current state of the Miniature Ancient World, this was an irrecoverable loss.

After all, these experts were all geared with top-tier weapons and equipment that Shadow had paid a huge price to procure. It wouldn’t be an easy task to replace all of these items. Meanwhile, before they could recover these lost items, Shadow would be much more restricted in what it could do in the Miniature Ancient World. Needless to say, it’d also be impossible for Shadow’s experts to catch up to the experts of other Guilds in terms of levels.

Simply put, Shadow had already lost its initiative in the Miniature Ancient World. It had already been kicked off the frontlines and lost the opportunity to contest crucial resources. Naturally, all of the investments it had made thus far were also for naught.

However, these losses still weren’t the biggest problem. The biggest problem Shadow now faced was Zero Wing’s Tier 6 God-ranked expert!

If it were before the Secret Pavilion’s recent move, it wouldn’t have been a significant problem for Shadow to be targeted by a Tier 6 God-ranked expert. After all, the God-ranked expert in question wasn’t on the main continent. Meanwhile, Shadow’s main source of income remained on the main continent.

However, the various powers of God’s Domain were currently frantically competing for the Miniature Ancient World’s resources. Among these powers, there were bound to be some who wouldn’t mind destroying Shadow, both on the main continent and in the Miniature Ancient World, if they could gain a Tier 6 God-ranked expert’s favor. Not to mention, they could also reduce the number of competition they needed to face in God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, in the distant forest, Blue Sheath couldn’t help but sigh in relief when she saw that Shi Feng had stopped attacking.

“What rotten luck. I nearly got killed just now,” Blue Sheath muttered under her breath. The attack just now had triggered all of her danger senses, and she felt as if her life was hanging by a thread. It had already been many years since she had experienced such a feeling. “What the hell is Shadow thinking? Even World Dominators wouldn’t dare to recklessly provoke a God-ranked expert. But after this mess, World Dominators will have no choice but to pick a fight with this God-ranked expert.”

The experts of one of World Dominators’s affiliated Guilds had just been annihilated. Even if World Dominators was reluctant to, it would have no choice but to go after Zero Wing. Otherwise, it’d become a laughingstock among the various powers, and no power would be willing to attach themselves to it.

Meanwhile, during the time Blue Sheath was resting, sounds of battle suddenly came from a different location. Moreover, these sounds were rather loud, and Blue Sheath could hear them clearly even though the battle took place several hundred yards away.

“What’s causing such a loud commotion? Has Zuo Tiankuang’s legion finally started clashing with Mysterious Moon’s experts?”

A hint of anticipation appeared in Blue Sheath’s eyes as she looked at the intermittent flashes coming from a distant part of the forest. Immediately, she went into Stealth and dashed toward the other battlefield.

Anyone capable of causing such a huge commotion in the current Miniature Ancient World must possess strength at the Tier 4 standard. Out of World Dominators’s forces scattered across the New Moon Forest, only the trump card legion led by Zuo Tiankuang possessed Tier 4 combatants. Meanwhile, if Zuo Tiankuang’s legion was making a move, it went without saying that they had discovered Mysterious Moon’s members.

Thus, Blue Sheath needed to head over to the other battlefield immediately. Otherwise, she might miss out on her chance to challenge Nightingale.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

As the sounds of battle continued echoing throughout the forest, Blue Sheath arrived within 100 yards of the battlefield.

There were several hundred players fighting on the battlefield right now. Of the two clashing sides, the side with greater numbers consisted of players wearing World Dominators’s Guild Emblem, while the side with fewer numbers consisted of players wearing Mysterious Moon’s Guild Emblem.

Meanwhile, after observing the battle for a moment, Blue Sheath couldn’t help but be stunned.

How is this possible!?

Logically, World Dominators should’ve been at an absolute advantage thanks to their overwhelming numbers. Yet, now, World Dominators’s members were fighting a retreating battle, their team of several hundred members getting pummeled by Mysterious Moon’s several dozen members.

At this moment, even World Dominators’s Zuo Tiankuang was getting pinned down by Mysterious Moon’s Vice Guild Leader, Crimson Seal.

However, this still wasn’t the most shocking part. What astonished Blue Sheath the most would still have to be the sight of the silver-haired female Assassin dashing around the battlefield, killing one player after another.

Meanwhile, this silver-haired Assassin was also the opponent Blue Sheath was seeking to challenge—Nightingale!

Currently, Nightingale wore leather armor engraved with magic patterns, and her body radiated Mana from top to bottom. The Mana she radiated had even taken on a faint, misty form. As for the two crescent blades she wielded, they were like demonic claws that tore through everything in their path.

Even Lonely Dragon, a Hammer Knight and Zuo Tiankuang’s vice commander, couldn’t face Nightingale’s attacks directly. When confronted with Nightingale’s attacks, his only option was to rely on his footwork to evade Nightingale’s attacks. Even then, he didn’t last more than 30 seconds before he lost all of his HP to Nightingale’s crescent blades…

The current Nightingale was so strong that even Blue Sheath dared not move forward to challenge her.

Moreover, Nightingale wasn’t the only anomaly on this battlefield. The other Mysterious Moon experts were also exhibiting extraordinary combat power.

Forty?! Since when did Mysterious Moon have so many experts with near Tier 4 strength?!

After observing the battle for some time, Blue Sheath finally understood why World Dominators’s members were at such a severe disadvantage.

Although Mysterious Moon only had 40 members on this battlefield, every one of them was an expert with combat power nearing the Tier 4 standard. This number was double of what World Dominators’s side possessed. Even though World Dominators’s side had more players, most of these players were of no help whatsoever.

In front of an expert with near Tier 4 strength, ordinary Refinement Realm and Flowing Water Realm experts were nothing more than cannon fodder.

After the battle continued for a few more minutes, Zuo Tiankuang had finally died after getting besieged by several Mysterious Moon experts. Along with Zuo Tiankuang’s death, the final member of World Dominators’s trump card legion had also disappeared from the New Moon Forest…
