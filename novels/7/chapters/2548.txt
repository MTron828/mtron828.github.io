Chapter 2549 – Promotion to Intermediate City

“What a huge building!”

“What’s going on? Can a Basic City have such a tall construction?”

Players on the main street were stunned when the Freedom Hotel was suddenly revealed.

Previously, the tallest building in Stone Forest City had only been 100 meters tall, but not only did the Freedom Hotel reach another 50 meters above that, but it also occupied a shockingly large area. It easily covered the area of a large- scale sports stadium. Such incredible buildings were even rare in NPC cities, let alone Guild Cities.

The Freedom Hotel’s sheer size stunned everyone who saw it.

While nearby players discussed this new construction, the Zero Wing members responsible for building the Freedom Hotel were astonished by their own creation. They had known that they had been building an extraordinary superstructure, but they hadn’t understood how amazing it truly was until after the Freedom Hotel’s completion.

Outsiders had no idea how impressive the hotel really was, but they, who had built it, were perfectly aware.

The Freedom Hotel was like another world. It was bigger on the inside than it appeared, and the Mana density within was frighteningly high. The Freedom Hotel’s Mana was around two or three times denser than in the outside world. Not even Candlelight’s Basic Meditation Rooms could compare.

Moreover, that had been before the Freedom Hotel had been complete...

There was a major difference between complete and incomplete structures in God’s Domain. A construction in the game functioned like one massive magic array. It wouldn’t be complete until the final magic array had been engraved, unable to function. The building would only exhibit its full potential once that task had been accomplished.

In other words, the Mana density Zero Wing’s members had felt inside the Freedom Hotel had been a result of the rare materials they had used. It hadn’t been amplified by any magic arrays...

That wasn’t the only thing that amazed Zero Wing’s architects. None of them had realized the complete building would stand 150 meters tall.

Stone Forest City was surrounded by the Cold Spring Forest, and during their meeting on the 27th floor, they had been mesmerized by the view. If they had an opportunity to stay a night on the Freedom Hotel’s top floor, they’d jump at the chance, regardless of the price.

Players would also rapidly earn the Double EXP buff while in the hotel due to the high Mana density. Staying in the hotel would substantially boost their leveling speed. After all, every player grinding in Level 100 neutral maps had to return to a city to rest sooner or later, and if players could earn the Double EXP buff while resting, their leveling speed would be greatly affected.

While Zero Wing’s architects were in awe of the Freedom Hotel’s future prospects, Shi Feng looked at the Peak Construction and sighed ruefully.

He had only witnessed superpowers’ Freedom Hotels during his previous life, yet now, Zero Wing had one of its own.

Peak Constructions weren’t just rare in God’s Domain; their powerful abilities were the true reason that drove countless powers crazy.

Before Shi Feng could call up the hotel’s system interface and inspect it properly, however, he heard the sounds of a series of system notifications.

System: The Large Freedom Hotel is complete. All players involved in the construction receive Level +1 and 8,000 Free Lifestyle Proficiency Points.

System: The Large Freedom Hotel is complete. Stone Forest City’s Popularity increased by 100,000 points, City Prosperity Level +1, and Stone Forest City’s Popularity Accumulation Speed increased by 10%.

System: Congratulations! Stone Forest City is the first Guild City to own a Peak Construction! Rewarding “Freedom City” title. This title will encourage more NPCs to visit Stone Forest City.

System: Stone Forest City has met the qualifications for its promotion into an Intermediate City. Do you wish to promote it to an Intermediate City?

By the time the system notifications ended, Shi Feng had risen from Level 111 to Level 112, saving several days of grinding. The abundant rewards even surprised him.

I got the Freedom City title, just like that? Shi Feng stared at the system notifications, at a loss for words. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Obtaining titles in God’s Domain was relatively easy, but the same couldn’t be said for towns and cities. Every power with a Guild City dreamed of obtaining the Freedom City title, in particular.

Not only would more human NPCs visit a city with the title, but other races’ NPCs would also make their way to the city, especially NPC merchants and soldiers. The title would allow Stone Forest City to recruit more human NPC soldiers and those of other races.

Of all the races in God’s Domain, humans weren’t particularly talented. They neither had impressive physiques and an affinity for the earth as Giants did, nor did they have the magical gifts or keen senses of the Elves and Ores, respectively. To put it simply, humans didn’t have any outstanding advantages. Their Legacies and relentless research were the only reasons that humans were able to occupy a significant portion of the main continent. There was also the fact that there were more humans than other races.

In terms of combat power, human NPCs were far inferior to Giants, Elves, and Ores.

Shi Feng didn’t give the matter much thought, however. The Freedom City title might be a major boon, but it wouldn’t be immediately effective. More importantly, Stone Forest City was ready for its promotion.

An Intermediate City!

Current powers might not yet realize how important an Intermediate City was. They only saw it as a larger city, able to accommodate more players. At best, it could rival NPC cities.

However, the various powers weren’t aware that Guild Cities were not like their NPC counterparts. The two didn’t even fall into the same category.

Basic Guild Cities only had the shape of a city, but they’d become true cities once they reached Intermediate rank.

This was why Shi Feng had wanted to upgrade his city before transferring it to a Level 100 neutral map. The city’s defensive system would only truly activate once it became an Intermediate City, and only then would a Guild City have the foundation to survive in such a high-level area.

Naturally, Shi Feng didn’t hesitate to promote Stone Forest City.

System: Stone Forest City is located in Cold Spring Forest, a Level 100 Neutral Map. Promoting it into an Intermediate City will cost 500,000 Gold and 100,000 Magic Crystals. Do you wish to proceed?

“Promote!” Shi Feng confirmed.

The Gold and Magic Crystals instantly vanished from Shi Feng’s bag, and a gigantic magic barrier enveloped Stone Forest City before all players were teleported outside of its walls.

“What’s going on? Why was I suddenly teleported outside?”

“What’s happening to Stone Forest City?”

The players looked up at the magic barrier around the city in stunned confusion. They had no idea what was happening.

After a moment, however, some Guild players’ expressions shifted to shock.

“Is Zero Wing relocating Stone Forest City again?”

“No, I’ve seen some Guild Towns’ promotions before. This magic barrier looks similar. I think Zero Wing is promoting the city.”

“What?! Are you serious?! Stone Forest City is being promoted!?”
