Chapter 2724 – A Gap Beyond Imagination

“It’s starting!” “I wonder if Black Flame can snatch that Advanced Resource Node?”

“As I see it, with his Mana Domain, Black Flame should fear group battles the least. However, Mythology’s side isn’t filled with pushovers, either. The one leading the defense of that Advanced Resource Node is the Silver Ghost, Prosciutto. The legion under him is amazing. I heard they killed a Level 110 Superior Mythic ranked World Boss some time ago. The feat sent waves across the entire western continent.”

“Crap! They’re that strong? In that case, Black Flame is really in danger. I heard that Superior Mythics all possess Mana Domains. Combined with their frightening Basic Attributes, it shouldn’t be possible for players to defeat them.”

Everyone in the arena paid close attention to Shi Feng’s 100-man team. It was no exaggeration to say that nobody present wished to miss out on this earth-shattering battle. Many of the major powers in the VIP viewing rooms had even stopped paying attention to the other battlefields and focused solely on Shi Feng’s 100-man team.

At this time, as if long prepared for this, Mythology’s members summoned a magic barrier as soon as Shi Feng’s team arrived. The barrier covered a 500-yard radius, thoroughly enveloping the Advanced Resource Node and Shi Feng’s team. Under the magic barrier’s oppressive power, not only did everyone on Shi Feng’s team feel their bodies growing heavier, but even their Basic Attributes started falling rapidly.

“This is...an Advanced Magic Barrier?!” Muxin was shocked when she saw how much her Basic Attributes had fallen. “How is this possible?!”

Advanced Magic Barriers were incredibly rare in God’s Domain. Just one set of magic array scrolls for an Advanced Magic Barrier was worth a fortune.

However, as the current competition prohibited the use of magic tools, players could only rely on themselves to erect magic barriers. Only, there were strict requirements for players to use magic barriers without any external aid.

Just casting an Intermediate Magic Array required 100 players. Moreover, of these 100 players, 20 of them needed to be at the Intermediate Magician standard and five at the Advanced Magician standard. Otherwise, the magic array wouldn’t operate.

If Intermediate Magic Arrays had such stringent requirements, one could easily imagine the requirements needed to summon an Advanced Magic Array.

Nevertheless, Mythology’s team had actually summoned one. This was simply unbelievable.

Meanwhile, an Advanced Magic Barrier was capable of suppressing even Mythic monsters. Needless to say, it would have a tremendous effect on Tier 3 players.

At this time, Frost Heaven’s members all wore pale expressions on their faces. They weren’t even peak experts in the Guild, to begin with. Compared to the various superpowers’ teams, their Basic Attributes could only be considered average. Now that the magic barrier had reduced their Basic Attributes by 30%, how were they supposed to fight?

“So, this is Mythology’s foundation?”

“Amazing! With this, even if Black Flame summons his Mana Domain, he will still have difficulty resisting the magic array’s suppression!”

The audience gasped when they saw Mythology’s Advanced Magic Barrier.

On a battlefield that prohibited the use of magic tools, having the ability to summon Advanced Magic Barriers would basically make one invincible.

Of course, a magic barrier summoned entirely through the effort of players wasn’t unbeatable. The greatest flaw of such a magic barrier was the immense burden on the casters’ Mana. If the players supporting the barrier did not replenish their Mana, they wouldn’t last more than ten minutes.

However, on this battlefield, ten minutes were more than enough to decide the outcome!

While everyone was marveling at Mythology’s capabilities, a hundred players walked out of the Advanced Resource Node.

The person in the lead was a silver-haired young man with an amiable expression on his face. However, everyone present was aware that this friendly youth was also known as the Silver Ghost, one of the leaders of Mythology’s younger generation.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, we meet again,” Prosciutto greeted Shi Feng in an indescribably calm voice. He showed no eagerness for a showdown at all. Instead, he behaved as if he was chatting about family affairs.

At Prosciutto’s words, Muxin looked at Shi Feng in surprise.

Prosciutto was a big celebrity in God’s Domain. He had risen to the position of vice commander in Mythology’s trump card legion at a young age and was the designated successor of the legion’s monstrous commander.

“You know him?”

“Mhm. We’ve met once on the western continent.” Shi Feng nodded in response to Muxin’s curiosity and surprise. There was no point in hiding the matter. After all, he had caused quite a huge scene in the Starlight Fortress, and most of the western continent’s superpowers probably knew about his clash with Mythology already. “You really are heartless with your words, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Prosciutto sighed. “The fight in the Starlight Fortress is the only humiliation I’ve suffered ever since entering Mythology. My memory of that fight is still fresh, yet you don’t take it seriously at all.” “Humiliation?” Smiling, Shi Feng said, “That’s hyperbole, right? Your Eminence only failed to have your way.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No! It is already a humiliation for me,” Prosciutto disagreed, shaking his head. Earnestly, he continued, “Previously, I stated that we would meet again. Only, our reunion happened much sooner than I expected. Although I still don’t think the time is right, allow me to repay some of the humiliation I suffered before!”

As soon as Prosciutto finished speaking, the 100 Tier 3 experts behind him promptly released their auras. It immediately felt as if a Demon God had descended onto the battlefield.

Of the group of 100, over 30 peak experts exuded auras rivaling that of Mythic monsters. The Frost Heaven members nearly collapsed to the ground under this pressure.

“This is...an Advanced Combat Array!”

“Over 30 peak experts with strength rivaling Mythic monsters?”

“No! This must be an illusion! How can there be such a large gap between our Guilds?!”

At this time, the Frost Heaven members on Shi Feng’s team weren’t the only ones suffering a mental breakdown. Even the various major powers in the VIP viewing rooms were dumbfounded, despair flooding their hearts.

“Sure enough, the gap is much bigger than we thought.”

Unyielding Heart smiled bitterly as he looked at Mythology’s 100-man team.

Yes!

This was the Five Great Super Guilds’ strength!

The world had always regarded the various superpowers’ existence as second only to the Five Great Super Guilds. However, these superpowers all knew full well that aside from a select few Super Guilds, every other superpower was far behind the Five Great Super Guilds. It wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to say that they were living in two different worlds.

This was also why no single superpower dared to declare that they would replace the Five Great Super Guilds.

It’s over! It’s really over now! How can the gap be this massive?!

Fear bloomed in Muxin’s heart as she looked at the approaching 30-plus peak experts. Even her breaths became stifled.

She had long since known that Mythology wasn’t a pushover and that the Five Great Super Guilds’ strength the various superpowers had seen thus far was only the tip of the iceberg. However, she never thought that the reality of the situation would actually be so hopeless and suffocating.

“Black Flame!” Sandstorm grinned smugly as he glared at Shi Feng. “You only beat me last time thanks to your Mana Body! I’ll let you know what true strength is this time!” “If you couldn’t do it last time, then I’m afraid you still can’t do it this time,” Shi Feng retorted, shaking his head as he watched Sandstorm approach.

“Still acting stubborn even in the face of death? I want to see what other tricks you have up your sleeves this time!”

After saying so, Sandstorm immediately charged at Shi Feng, his speed as fast as a shooting star. The distance of a hundred yards seemed almost nonexistent to him.

Before Frost Heaven’s members could react, Sandstorm was already standing in front of Shi Feng. The dagger he wielded also turned into a phantom snake that bit at Shi Feng’s heart.

“Tricks?”Shi Feng shook his head when he saw this scene. He then stretched out his hand.

Boom!

A violent storm enveloped the entire battlefield, kicking up dust and dirt into the air.

“How is this possible?!”

The next moment, everyone stared at the two figures standing amid the dust cloud in stupefaction.

At this time, Sandstorm’s dagger hovered half an inch away from Shi Feng’s heart. Meanwhile, before anyone realized it, Shi Feng had actually caught Sandstorm by the wrist, intercepting the hand holding the dagger.

How is this possible?!

Sandstorm was stunned when he saw his captured wrist.
