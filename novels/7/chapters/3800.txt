Chapter 3801 - 875 - Dragonslayer

As the ancient tome released one dragon roar after another, the VIP reading room’s magic barrier ramped up to maximum defense. In this state, the magic barrier could easily withstand Tier 6 attacks. Yet, the dragon roars still pushed it to the brink of failure before they subsided.

How close! Shi Feng’s heart pounded as he looked at the cracked barrier. Had the ancient tome released a few more dragon roars, the barrier would have shattered, and the dragon roars would have spread across the entire Nightmare Holy City, alerting everyone of the birth of a priceless treasure.

Although Red Frost had just repelled the White Dragon Nation and intimidated the city’s many powers and players, that didn’t mean she could take on the entire city. Whether it was Red Frost or their party, they would quickly be drowned to death if the whole city decided to attack them.

Nonetheless, following the removal of the Sealing Engraving, the identity of the ancient tome also came to light: a Mythical Era Creation.

Specifically, it was the Dragon-Hunting Artillery Construction Design!

The Dragon-Hunting Artillery, also known as the Dragonslayer, was a terrifying weapon that could hunt even Dragon Gods. While the average player might not have much use for it, it was a priceless treasure for teams and powers.

If a town had a few Dragon-Hunting Artilleries constructed, nobody would dare to attack it recklessly. Even Ancient Gods would avoid the town like the plague. This was because the Dragon-Hunting Artillery’s attacks could injure even Primordial Gods.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, when the Holy Race started to besiege and occupy the Eternal Realm’s various Neutral Cities, they suffered a devastating blow when they stretched their hands to the southern region’s Luminous Sky City. This was because the city secretly possessed three Dragon-Hunting Artilleries.

Back then, a single shot from a Dragon-Hunting Artillery turned over a dozen Level 240-plus experts fully equipped with Divine Artifacts into ash and permanently erased several hundred thousand Tier 6 experts. Had the old monsters leading the Holy Race’s army not promptly reacted and destroyed the three Dragon-Hunting Artilleries with their trump cards, the Holy Race might have even lost that siege.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

What is this construction cost? On top of ten Lightning Nuclei, it also needs five hundred million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal? Shi Feng’s scalp went numb when he saw the main materials needed to construct the Dragon-Hunting Artillery.

Even advancing from Tier 6 to Tier 7 only cost 100 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. Yet, the Dragon-Hunting Artillery required 500 million units to construct.

The Lightning Nucleus was also an extraordinarily precious material that could only be obtained from Grade 1 Lightning Crystal Veins. Normally, only one out of ten Lightning Crystal Veins would have a Lightning Nucleus. Moreover, each Realm only had a few Lightning Crystal Veins, with some not having any.

To make matters worse, Lightning Nuclei could be used to power Void Fortresses and increase the chances of lightning-type Flying Mounts advancing to Tier 6. This made them incredibly valuable and virtually impossible to find on the market.

Not even pseudo-apex powers would have enough Lightning Nuclei to construct the Dragon-Hunting Artillery.

It seems I have no choice but to ask Verdant Rainbow about the Lightning Nuclei. Looking at the design, Shi Feng felt he would have to rely on the Seven Luminaries Alliance to construct the Dragon-Hunting Artillery. If he depended on Zero Wing, he would never be able to finish gathering the needed Lightning Nuclei.

Just as Shi Feng was about to study the Dragon-Hunting Artillery’s design, he suddenly received a call from Whirlwind Bulwark.

“Brother Bulwark, did something happen?” Shi Feng asked when he saw Whirlwind Bulwark’s terrified face.

Of Nightmare Holy City’s top two Guilds, one had already been devastated by Red Frost, while the other had expressed goodwill to them. Hence, Shi Feng found it puzzling why Whirlwind Bulwark would have such an expression.

Although Whirlwind Bulwark’s equipment standard wasn’t anything special, his combat standard was excellent. He could even compete with the Divine Glory List’s top 100 experts in combat standards.

“It’s Kowloon Demon!” Hurriedly, Whirlwind Bulwark explained, “A few minutes ago, Kowloon Demon came to the library demanding a match with Miss Frost. Miss Heiser was very dissatisfied with his challenge, so she decided to teach him a lesson, only to get killed. Currently, Brother Xiao is trying to buy time while Miss Leaf goes to find Miss Frost and Miss Laura at the library’s Legacy Room.”

“Heiser was killed?” Shi Feng was surprised. “Is Kowloon Demon that 

strong?”

Heiser was already a Half-step Mortal God. Shi Feng found it hard to believe that anyone from Nightmare Holy City could kill her in a one-on-one fight. Even if her opponent was of the same combat standard, her superior equipment standard should give her an overwhelming advantage.

“He’s terrifyingly strong!” Whirlwind Bulwark exclaimed fearfully. “When Kowloon Demon first appeared, he challenged and defeated every expert in Nightmare Holy City. He even killed several hundred of the White Dragon Nation’s experts just to be able to fight Tyrant Wyvern. Originally, Tyrant Wyvern swore to erase Kowloon Demon with the White Dragon Nation’s strength, but he later abandoned the idea. Since then, neither the White Dragon Nation nor the Holy Knights has dared to provoke Kowloon Demon.

“Kowloon Demon must have heard about Miss Frost’s achievements and has come to challenge her.”

“I understand.” After hearing Whirlwind Bulwark’s explanation, Shi Feng understood that Kowloon Demon was a battle maniac. However, he wasn’t particularly surprised by this information, as many such people were in the Greater God’s Domain. “I’ll be there soon.”

Battle maniacs usually never backed down until they achieved their goal. It hadn’t been long since Red Frost initiated a Gold Combat Technique learning session in the library’s Legacy Room. Should Kowloon Demon interrupt her now, the 10,000 Undying Souls she spent would be in vain.

After saying so, Shi Feng disconnected the call and left the reading room.

…

Library, first-floor hall:

Presently, the normally tranquil hall was boiling with excitement as the players in the hall discussed Kowloon Demon and Heiser, whom Star Butterfly had just resurrected.

Dammit! Is that guy a monster?! Heiser, who had fallen to Level 226, was filled with disbelief as she glared at the tall young man in front of her.

Again!

She got one-shotted again!

This time, the battle even ended without her realizing what had happened…

Meanwhile, Kowloon Demon suddenly turned to the staircase leading to the library’s second floor. More specifically, he looked at the cloaked man walking down the staircase.

“Are you their party leader?” After Kowloon Demon gave Shi Feng the once-over, disappointment flashed in his eyes. “It seems I was wrong to have any expectations for you. I’ll give you one minute. Have that woman called Red Frost come fight me. Otherwise, you’ll suffer worse than that girl!”
