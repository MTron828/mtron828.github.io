Chapter 2860 - Eastern Continent’s Situation

Sixteenth Cloud and the others noticed the three people moving behind Shi Feng and were stunned when they saw the faces of these three people.

“No way! Commander Fithalia of Divine Tribe’s Divine Hymn Legion is here! Isn’t Divine Tribe active only on the western continent?”

“She’s not here alone. Even the Silver Lion Legion’s Vice Commander MacAffrey and Divine Tribe’s Crimson Witch are here. Both of them are Divine Tribe’s top combatants. Crimson Witch is probably the one who helped us just now.”

“Why did they come here all of a sudden?”

Although Divine Tribe wasn’t famous on the eastern continent, it was very well-known on the western continent. The Guild’s development had even skyrocketed recently, and it was now an existence close to rivaling the Five Great Super Guilds. Naturally, Divine Tribe was many times stronger than a recently established superpower like Shining Tiger.

Yet, three of Divine Tribe’s top combatants were now here. With the ability of these three people, they could normally preside over the Guild affairs on their own. Having the three of them together was akin to Divine Tribe having its trump card legion stroll down the street of a city. Unless Divine Tribe was planning an important operation, such an action would be a complete waste of manpower.

However, before Sixteenth Cloud and the others could recover from their surprise, Fithalia and MacAffrey suddenly appeared beside the Four-winged Feathered Dragon. Fithalia promptly brandished her longsword and bombarded the Realm Lord with a rain of sword lights.

As for MacAffrey, he raised his greatsword and stabbed it into the ground. Subsequently, massive greatswords emerged from the ground and stabbed at the airborne Feathered Dragon.

Compared to the Shining Tiger trio, Fithalia and MacAffrey evidently had far superior control over Mana. Their ordinary Tier 4 Skills nearly rivaled Tier 5 Skills in power. They also perfectly coordinated their attacks, such that the Feathered Dragon could only defend against the attack of one and had no choice but to take the attack of the other.

-31,654,215!

Damage exceeding 30 million appeared above the Feathered Dragon’s head, the attack provoking a pained cry from the Superior Mythic. Although this amount of damage was nothing compared to the Feathered Dragon’s nearly 20 billion HP, Sixteenth Cloud and the others couldn’t even damage the Realm Lord.

“So, these are Divine Tribe’s top combatants?”

Sixteenth Cloud was astonished when she saw the combat prowess Fithalia and MacAffrey displayed.

Although Sixteenth Cloud recognized that she still couldn’t rank at the very top of God’s Domain in terms of combat power, she was still a Domain Realm Tier 4 expert. She was also fully equipped with Epic Equipment. Yet, compared to Fithalia and MacAffrey, she still had a long way to go before reaching the top of God’s Domain.

However, before Shining Tiger’s trio could overcome their shock from Fithalia and MacAffrey’s display of power, an overbearing sword light suddenly cut through space and sliced off one of the Feathered Dragon’s claws. The attack wrenched an agonized shriek from the Feathered Dragon, and its HP instantly plunged by more than 100 million. The horrified Feathered Dragon immediately flapped its wings and fled the scene like a powerful storm, not daring to remain for even a moment longer. The Feathered Dragon was much faster than the average Tier 4 Flying Mount.

Upon seeing this scene, Sixteenth Cloud and the others reflexively turned toward the origin of the sword light with stunned looks on their faces.

This was because the origin of this sword light was none other than Shi Feng. Currently, he radiated a Mana so dense that it was liquid.

“How is this possible?” Sixteenth Cloud gaped in shock at Shi Feng.

Not only did Shi Feng scare a Superior Mythic ranked Realm Lord away with one attack, but the strength of his Mana was simply unbelievable. The density of his Mana was something she had seen radiating from only Tier 5 NPCs.

However, while the information Shining Tiger obtained said that Shi Feng was indeed powerful to the point where he could slay Tier 4 NPCs-it did not say that he was this powerful.

The attack Shi Feng had used to scare the Feathered Dragon away wasn’t a Skill because the attack did not create any Mana fluctuations whatsoever. It was an ordinary attack executed with a combat technique.

Meanwhile, seeing the Feathered Dragon fly away left Shi Feng feeling a little frustrated.

How unfortunate. The Demon Mist Valley’s restraint prevented even him from flying. Hence, if a flying monster fled from him, he had no way of catching up. Not to mention, the Four-winged Feathered Dragon was even a Realm Lord.

This was why players had an incredibly difficult time killing Mythic monsters or above in forbidden lands that prevented flight. After all, the majority of the Mythic monsters in forbidden lands could fly. Unless players prepared an ambush beforehand, they could, at most, repel Mythic monsters but not kill them.

“Are you three alright?” After seeing the Feathered Dragon flying into the distance, Shi Feng approached Sixteenth Cloud’s group and asked curiously, “This isn’t a place ordinary Tier 4s can visit. Why did you come here?”

Unlike the Ruined Mountain Range, which was a forbidden land only for humans, the Demon Mist Valley was a forbidden land for all lifemuch more dangerous than the Ruined Mountain Range. Tier 4 players traveling alone or in a small group could only explore the Valley’s outer region, at most.

Normally, if players wished to enter the Demon Mist Valley’s inner region, they needed a team of 20 Tier 4 players at the very least. Meanwhile, Sixteenth Cloud’s group only had three people. Entering the Valley’s inner region was a death sentence for them.

“You misunderstand us, Guild Leader Black Flame. If possible, we wouldn’t have chosen to enter this place, either,” Sixteenth Cloud replied with a bitter smile. “The three of us entered this place because we had no other choice. Otherwise, the Outerworld Tier 4 experts chasing us would’ve long since killed

us.”

She was both Shining Tiger’s Second Vice Guild Leader and a Tier 4 Domain Realm expert. If it were a month ago, nobody would believe her if she told them that other players were hunting her and had even driven her into a desperate situation.

In fact, if Sixteenth Cloud had come across such a situation, she definitely wouldn’t tell anyone about it. Now, however, Sixteenth Cloud did not mind revealing this matter to an outsider at all. She also didn’t find it damaging to her self-esteem. On the contrary, she even felt proud about the situation.

“The three of you were actually cornered? Is the eastern continent’s situation that bad?” Shi Feng was surprised by Sixteenth Cloud’s words.

In his previous life, Tier 4 experts remained existences that could not be underestimated, even ten years after God’s Domain’s launch. Even superpowers with Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts wouldn’t have an easy time targeting and hunting down Tier 4 experts keen on escaping

After all, there were simply far too few experts in God’s Domain capable of getting promoted to Tier 4, and the bare minimum requirement for players to participate in a hunt for Tier 4 players was to be Tier 4 themselves. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to catch up with and surround the targeted Tier 4 player at all. And while Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts were indeed capable of overpowering Tier 4 experts in a head-on fight, they had to track down their target first before they could do anything. Hence, even for the various superpowers, hunting down Tier 4 experts was a headache.

Yet, Sixteenth Cloud’s group of three Tier 4 experts was actually getting hunted. This told Shi Feng that the eastern continent was in far direr straits than what Divine Tribe’s report described.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, you must’ve been away from the eastern continent during this period, right?” Sixteenth Cloud wasn’t particularly surprised by Shi Feng’s question. Without withholding any information, she replied, “A few days ago, another ten or so Outerworld superpowers arrived on the eastern continent. One of these superpowers is incredibly strong-probably on the level of the Five Great Super Guilds. This superpower has many Tier 4s, as well as Tier 3 experts that exhibit combat power at the Tier 4 standard.

“Because of this superpower’s appearance, the originally stable situation on the eastern continent changed instantly. Previously, the Tier 4 experts of the eastern continent’s superpowers could still roam the Demon Mist Valley’s outer region. Now, however, let alone grinding peacefully in the outer region, we’d be fortunate not to get hunted by those Outerworld experts.”

Previously, there had indeed been a huge difference between the eastern continent’s superpowers and the Outerworld’s superpowers. However, it wasn’t as if the eastern continent’s superpowers were utterly helpless to fight back. After all, even in the Outerworld, reaching Tier 4 wasn’t easy. As a result, the Outerworld’s superpowers did not have many Tier 4 players under their command, either.

However, after that superpower showed up, the Outerworld’s forces suddenly gained a slew of Tier 4 combatants. This instantly shattered the balance between the two sides and placed native Tier 4 experts like herself at an absolute disadvantage.

Almost all of the eastern continent’s resource-rich maps had already become the backyard of those Outerworld players, and trying to level up in these maps was now a monumental challenge for native players. “I see. No wonder you ran all the way here.” Shi Feng finally understood the situation.

There were many ways in God’s Domain to allow Tier 3 experts to possess Tier 4 combat power. Besides Tier 3 Mana Set Equipment, combat arrays were more than capable of doing the job. However, combat arrays were incredibly rare, and producing them was also extremely troublesome. This was especially true when it came to the materials required. Nevertheless, so long as one managed to manufacture combat arrays capable of granting

Tier 3 players Tier 4 combat power, one would be more than capable of dealing with Tier 4 players.

After all, the precondition for Tier 4 players’ invulnerability to zerg tactics was that their opponents were Tier 3 combatants or weaker. If a Tier 4 player had to go up against a group of Tier 4 players, even a Tier 4 apex expert would be pushed to the brink of death very quickly.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, if you plan on leaving the Demon Mist Valley, I’d advise you to wait here for the time being. We entered this place just recently, so those Outerworld experts are probably still hanging around the outer region,” Sixteenth Cloud said. “Although those Tier 3 experts with Tier 4 combat power are strong, their resistance to the foreign energy in the environment is still at the Tier 3 standard, so they can’t stay in a forbidden land for too long.” Judging by Shi Feng’s reactions, Sixteenth Cloud guessed that the man had not been updated about the eastern continent’s situation for quite some time now.

Although Shi Feng was indeed extraordinarily strong and even had three powerful experts following him, his group would most likely still face a bitter battle if it had to go up against a large number of Tier 4 combatants. If the four weren’t careful, they might even end up losing their lives.

At present, the wisest option would be to wait until those Tier 4 combatants had left the forbidden land.

“Thank you for the warning, but that won’t be necessary.” Shi Feng shook his head in response to Sixteenth Cloud’s advice. After voicing his gratitude, he promptly led Fithalia and the others out of the inner region.

When Shi Feng’s party of four had gotten several hundred yards away, Sorrowful Silence and the Tier 4 Guardian Knight turned to Sixteenth Cloud.

“What should we do now?” Sorrowful Silence asked. “Do we wait here?”

Now that the Four-winged Feathered Dragon had fled this place, they should be safe for some time.

“We don’t have a choice. Let’s follow Guild Leader Black Flame,” Sixteenth Cloud replied, gritting her teeth. “It might be impossible to break out of the encirclement with just the three of us, but with the strength of Guild Leader Black Flame’s group, we should have a chance.”

Sixteenth Cloud and the others ran after Shi Feng’s group.
