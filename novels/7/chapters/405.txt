Chapter 406 - Rapid Showdown

Zhao Yueru was speechless upon hearing Gentle Snow’s explanation; she was dazed as she stared at Soaring Snake.

Soaring Snake had never been so powerful in the past.

They never knew he possessed such talent. He had actually hidden his true strength so well. With this, who else could be his match in close combat?

While ordinary people could launch three to four attacks, Soaring Snake could launch fourteen or fifteen attacks. He was invincible.

Chances were that the only way to defeat Soaring Snake was to pull away and attack from a distance. Melee classes had no chance of winning.

“Hahaha! Ye Feng is indeed commendable for discerning Soaring Snake’s ability. However, there is no way Soaring Snake will lose this match!” A huge smile appeared on Cao Chenghua’s dignified face.

As long as Soaring Snake won this match, this competition would come to an end. Meanwhile, he would officially take hold of the position of Guild Leader.

Everything was going exactly as he had expected.

...

“I was just warming up. If I take this fight seriously, I will only become faster. You are pretty amazing for blocking my last two attacks. Let’s see how many attacks you can block.”

Although Soaring Snake was slightly surprised by how quickly Shi Feng had discerned his talent, his opponent could never overcome it. There was not a single Swordsman who could beat him.

Swordsmen mainly relied on their normal attacks in battle. It was a class that wore down their enemies by attrition. If faced with a ranged class, Soaring Snake might have had some difficulties. However, against another Swordsman, he was practically invincible with his reaction speed.

Moreover, he had also grasped Omnivision. He could easily perceive his enemy’s every movement and strike their weak points. Combining this martial arts technique with his inhuman reaction speed, in a melee battle, he was invulnerable.

As he said so, Soaring Snake abruptly stomped on the ground, and like a fierce gale, his body shot towards Shi Feng.

Straight-line attacks could usually be easily seen and dealt with. Despite knowing this, however, Soaring Snake still chose to face Shi Feng head-on, as if saying, “Come at me if you can.”

“You want to compete with speed?” Shi Feng’s frown deepened.

Facing Soaring Snake, someone with such a unique talent, would be disadvantageous for Shi Feng. Although Soaring Snake’s assault had many flaws, the Swordsman was not afraid of exploitation. Even if Shi Feng attacked Soaring Snake, the latter could easily perceive the attack with his Omnivision. With Soaring Snake’s reaction speed, before Shi Feng’s sword could reach him, he would have already evaded it.

Following which, Shi Feng activated the Aura of Wind of the Seven Luminaries Ring, increasing his Movement Speed by 40%, Attack Speed by 40%, and Agility by 30%. He then dashed forward to meet Soaring Snake in battle.

With breakneck speed, Soaring Snake had sent out sixteen sword images, forcing Shi Feng to deal with sixteen attacks simultaneously.

However, after activating the Aura of Wind, Shi Feng’s speed allowed him to deflect all sixteen attacks easily.

For the time being, both sides were equally matched.

Despite Shi Feng having a huge advantage in terms of speed, Soaring Snake’s reaction speed was unmatched. Even if Shi Feng’s attacks were faster, Soaring Snake could respond instantaneously.

The clash of metal resounded relentlessly throughout the arena, the noise reaching deafening levels. Every time Shi Feng’s and Soaring Snake’s swords met, dazzling sparks would scatter around them.

The spectating crowd’s hearts pounded as they watched the two Swordsmen confront each other. Each attack was simply too fast. The threat of death dominated each second. The slightest mistake would determine victory or defeat. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Ye Feng is this strong? No wonder he was so confident,” Zhao Yueru said with shock, her eyes focused on Shi Feng inside the arena, who had yet to lose any HP.

Fierce Snake, who had been resurrected not long ago, nodded in agreement. In such a furious showdown, he might not last even two seconds before suffering defeat.

“Of course! Big Brother Ye Feng is very strong!” Violet Cloud giggled.

What a joke. How could the publicly acknowledged number one expert of Star-Moon Kingdom, One-hit Asura, lose just because the opponent possesses a special physique?

“Fine, fine, fine! Your Big Brother Ye Feng is the most amazing!” Zhao Yueru was also relieved upon seeing Shi Feng’s performance. If Shi Feng lost this match, today’s competition would end.

Meanwhile, Cao Chenghua’s team was also greatly shocked by the battle happening before them.

Soaring Snake was Ouroboros’s undisputed number one expert, yet, an unknown player like Ye Feng could match him evenly.

“That Ye Feng is amazing. He is actually able to cope with Soaring Snake’s violent offensive. Even I can’t last as long.” Nimble Snake felt slightly surprised as he looked at the relaxed expression on Ye Feng’s face.

“However, the result of this match will soon be determined,” War Wolf suddenly said, smiling faintly.

“Big Brother War Wolf, what do you mean?” Nimble Snake asked curiously.

“Soaring Snake still hasn’t used everything he has. He is simply probing Ye Feng at the moment. Didn’t you see that Soaring Snake hasn’t used Second Acceleration yet?” War Wolf had the keenest eyesight among everyone present, and with just a glance, he could tell that Soaring Snake conserved a considerable amount of his strength.

“No wonder Ye Feng is still standing!” Nimble Snake laughed.

As War Wolf and the others discussed the fight, inside the arena, Soaring Snake suddenly retreated a few steps, pulling a small distance away from Shi Feng. Meanwhile, Shi Feng did not give chase. Instead, he silently observed the Swordsman facing him.

“You have really surprised me. Ever since I learned Omnivision, you have been the first person who has lasted this long against me. How about it? If you join us, Big Brother War Wolf can help you become even stronger than you are now. As for the remuneration Gentle Snow has offered, I believe that Brother Cao will not hesitate to double that amount now that he has seen what you are capable of,” Soaring Snake said, smiling at Shi Feng confidently.

Even with his inhuman reaction speed, Soaring Snake found it extremely difficult to counter Shi Feng’s attacks. Shi Feng’s strikes were simply too fast, so much so that, if he had not perceived the attacks’ trajectory beforehand, it would be impossible to dodge or block them.

If the Assassin Nimble Snake stood in his place, the battle would have ended long ago. Only a talented person like himself could possibly avoid Shi Feng’s attacks.

“Cao Chenghua cannot afford to give me what I want. So, just forget about it,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

“What a pity. Die, then!” Soaring Snake’s smile instantly twisted into something sinister. In the blink of an eye, he launched eighteen sword images, blocking all of Shi Feng’s paths of retreat.

Although the eighteen sword images did not appear to be fast, Shi Feng knew that Soaring Snake was no longer holding back. Of these eighteen sword strikes, Soaring Snake had applied Second Acceleration to every one.

When the eighteen sword images were about to reach their mark...

Shi Feng simultaneously activated Purgatory Power, Windwalk, Wind Blade, and Wind Rider, and rather than retreating, he dashed forward to meet the incoming attacks.

Shi Feng was like a phantom. In the blink of an eye, he had weaved through the gaps between Soaring Snake’s sword images.

When Shi Feng and Soaring Snake collided, a silvery-gray flash appeared on the latter’s body.

The time it took the two to cross swords was only an instant.

For some reason, however, an impressive gout of blood sprayed from Soaring Snake’s body, splashing across the floor. Following which, Soaring Snake released an agonized scream as he tumbled to the ground.

“What?!”

“What happened?!”

The crowd fell silent at this sudden development; only the sound of Soaring Snake’s scream echoed throughout the arena.
