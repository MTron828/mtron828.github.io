Chapter 239 – Myriad Worlds’ Era

Boundary Mountain Range, second underground level, divine statue plaza:

“Am I hallucinating, Teacher? Every God’s Domain in our Realm will have access to our Miniature Ancient World? Doesn’t that mean we can get in touch with the various God’s Domains’ players?” Tao Yuwei asked excitedly as she turned to look at Thousand Swords.

As one of World Dominators’ peak geniuses, she was privy to much more information than most players. So, she naturally knew that their God’s Domain and the Desolate Star God’s Domain weren’t the only God’s Domains in existence. Instead, there were many, many more God’s Domains out there.

Previously, the various superpowers had invested a considerable amount of manpower and resources into the Miniature Ancient World so that they could have a better time interacting with the Desolate Star God’s Domain’s various powers. Meanwhile, the reason they were trying to interact with the Desolate Star God’s Domain’s powers was so that they could learn more about the Greater God’s Domain, which would, in turn, give them an easier time once their God’s Domain got integrated into the Greater God’s Domain.

However, according to the system notification, the new expansion pack would allow the players from many other God’s Domains to enter the Miniature Ancient World directly. Not only would this give them a much easier time learning about the Greater God’s Domain, but they would also have access to many more fortuitous opportunities than before.

At this moment, even Gu Yiren couldn’t help but look forward to the expansion pack.

There were two reasons why so many Tier 4 and Tier 5 experts were attracted to the Miniature Ancient World. Firstly, it was because the Miniature Ancient World contained many God Legacies. Secondly, it was because they could spar and interact with the Desolate Star God’s Domain’s experts. They could climb to higher tiers if they could further improve their technical standards.

Now that many more experts from other God’s Domains would be coming to the Miniature Ancient World, they might even have hope to reach Tier 6, let alone Tier 5. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“We can indeed interact with many more experts.” Unlike Tao Yuwei and Gu Yiren, Thousand Swords did not reveal any feelings of joy or excitement. On the contrary, his face looked somewhat gloomy as he said, “But this is both good news and bad news for us…”

The new expansion pack had indeed granted them more opportunities to interact with powerful experts and broaden their horizons.

However, the arrival of more experts would also mean that competition in the Miniature Ancient World would become more intense.

It wasn’t hard to imagine that once the expansion pack took effect, the status quo in the Miniature Ancient World would undergo a significant change. Even Super Guilds like World Dominators would not be spared from this change.

However, Gu Yiren and Tao Yuwei did not feel worried despite what Thousand Swords said. On the contrary, they even hoped the expansion pack would come sooner. That way, they could spar with the experts of other God’s Domains and rapidly improve their strength. At that time, they’d be able to stand out more in the Miniature Ancient World and become legendary individuals among the younger generation.

…

When the rest of the players in the Miniature Ancient World and the players on the main continent learned about the Epic Expansion Pack, the official forums quickly exploded with activity.

“What’s going on? Wasn’t the Miniature Ancient World supposed to only be for players of our God’s Domain and another planet’s God’s Domain?”

“I thought there were only two God’s Domains in existence. But looking at the system’s introduction, there seem to be many more God’s Domains in existence.”

“That is indeed the case. You guys might not know this, but there actually exist many, many God’s Domains. Moreover, the players of these God’s Domains aren’t from other planets. Instead, they are people from parallel worlds. It’s just that God’s Domain can connect all of these parallel worlds. This information has always been known to only the executives of the various superpowers and first-rate powers. These powers have also prohibited the spread of this information.”

“What a bunch of nonsense. Parallel worlds? How can such things exist? Also, if this information is prohibited from being spread, how did you come to know it?”

“Hehe, that’s because I’m a first-rate Guild’s reserve executive. I can share this information now since it won’t be a secret once the new expansion pack takes effect.”

“So that’s why the various corporations have invested so much into God’s Domain. These sneaky bastards…”

“If that really is the case, God’s Domain’s value is much higher than we imagine. The Miniature Ancient World’s value might also be far higher than the main continent. Trading currencies and resources in the real world with other parallel worlds might not be possible, but we can buy technologies that are unavailable in our world. If a corporation can get its hands on new and unavailable technology, it can definitely make a fortune.”

“I just checked the exchange rate for Coins. The value of Coins increased tenfold not long after the new expansion pack was announced. The people who have stocked up on Coins previously are probably making a killing right about now.”

“This won’t do! I’m going to transfer to the Miniature Ancient World as soon as the update finishes!”

“I’ve decided as well! Although I went through great pains to reach Tier 4, the opportunities available in the Miniature Ancient World are far superior to the main continent!”

“Going to the Miniature Ancient World now isn’t a bad idea. Although players choosing to enter the Miniature Ancient World now cannot bring any Coins or Magic Crystals, can only bring up to 50 slots’ worth of items, and cannot reconstruct their Mana Bodies, we will only regress to Level 120, Tier 3. Overall, it is still a good tradeoff.”

Shortly after the new expansion pack launched, many players came to know about the secrets of God’s Domain. Meanwhile, after learning these secrets, these players were filled with expectations towards the Miniature Ancient World. It was especially true for the main continent’s Tier 4 and Tier 5 experts.

Tier 4 and Tier 5 experts might be able to earn a sizable salary by working for the various powers, their earnings in a single year enough for them to buy a house in a first-rate city. However, this salary was nothing compared to the possibility of getting their hands on unknown technology and selling it for a fortune.

…

While the whole world was discussing the Miniature Ancient World’s new expansion pack, Jin Hai City’s God’s Domain Association Building welcomed a group of people. Along with the arrival of this group, the originally lively lobby instantly turned quiet.

“Their uniform… Are they from the Green God Corporation?”

“Quick, look! Elder Li has come out to greet them!”

“What’s going on? Elder Li is personally greeting them? Isn’t Elder Li a director in the Green God Corporation?”

“Look at the woman at the front. She might be young, but she’s wearing a Three-Leaf Emblem, proof that she is an executive in the Green God Corporation. Elder Li might be a director in the corporation, but he is only one of the corporation’s many outer directors. He isn’t part of the corporation’s middle management. Just one word from that woman can probably get Elder Li kicked out of the Green God Corporation.

“What? Why would an executive from the Green God Corporation come to this place?”

“It isn’t just the Green God Corporation’s executive. See that man wearing sunglasses next to the woman? If I’m not mistaken, he should be Breeze Wine, the Midnight Tea Party’s former commander.”

“That’s right! That is definitely Breeze Wine! I met him in the early years of God’s Domain. He was one of God’s Domain’s Three Great Guardian Knights at the time, but he suddenly disappeared a few years ago. Rumor has it that he died, so I really didn’t expect him to appear here!”

“Even the Midnight Tea Party’s former commander has appeared... Did some great personage appear in this place? I recall that under Breeze Wine’s lead, the Midnight Tea Party dared to challenge even the Five Great Super Guilds. If not for Breeze Wine and the Midnight Tea Party’s commander disappearing, the Midnight Tea Party might surpass the Five Great Super Guilds in terms of apex combat power...”

“But why would bigshots like them suddenly come to this place?”

Curiosity and confusion filled the people in the lobby when they saw the Green God Corporation’s group of ten or so people. For a moment, their attention had even shifted away from the Myriad Worlds’ Descent expansion pack.

“What brings you here, Miss Xia?” Elder Li, an Elder of the God’s Domain Association conducting a routine inspection on Jin Hai City’s association branch, asked respectfully as he looked at the young woman before him.

“It’s nothing worrying. I’m just here to find Zero Wing. Can you lead the way for me?” the young woman asked with a faint smile.

Although Elder Li was greatly confused by this request, he still led the young woman and her entourage to Zero Wing’s temporary office.

Meanwhile, when the players in the lobby overheard the woman’s words, they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

Zero Wing was nothing more than a small Guild that didn’t even have its own headquarters. Zero Wing had even offended the Flower of Seven Sins and was at risk of disbanding at any time. Yet, this small Guild had actually managed to get an executive from the Green God Corporation to visit it in person. This was simply unbelievable.

At the same time, a piece of shocking news appeared on the official forums of God’s Domain.

One of the parties involved in activating the Myriad Worlds’ Descent expansion pack was Zero Wing!
