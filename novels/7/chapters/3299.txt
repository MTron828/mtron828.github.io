A realm-wide announcement?

The system notification stunned Shi Feng. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

A Great Grandmaster Magician!

Out of the many subclasses in the game, the Magician subclass was the most favored by combat players.

On top of being able to create magic scrolls, the Magician subclass also allowed players to gain a better grasp over mana. The subclass was especially useful for magical class players. In fact, the subclass was a must-have for magical class players since it let them have a better understanding of magic arrays and gave them an easier time casting Spells.

Only, unlike other subclasses, most players would hit an unbreachable wall once they reached the Grandmaster rank for the Magician subclass.

If players wished to become a Great Grandmaster Magician, they would need to create a Great Grandmaster Magician. Meanwhile, to accomplish this feat, players would first have to do a lot of research on Great Grandmaster Magic Arrays.

However, Great Grandmaster Magic Arrays had already become a lost technology ever since the Great Ancient War. Outside of the Twelve Sanctuaries, finding Great Grandmaster Magic Arrays was nigh impossible. Their rarity rivaled Fragmented Divine Artifacts.

Hence, it was almost impossible for players to get their hands on a large number of Great Grandmaster Magic Arrays to research. It was also why there were so few Great Grandmaster Magicians in the Greater God’s Domain.

Originally, Shi Feng had only thought of attempting to create a Great Grandmaster Magic Array. After all, this was the only solution he could think of to create a Tier 5 Legendary Mana Body.

However, he never thought he would actually succeed!

He couldn’t believe he had just become a Great Grandmaster Magician, an existence that wouldn’t number more than 100 in any era in the Greater God’s Domain!

While Shi Feng was in a daze, he received another system notification.

…

System: Do you wish to make a realm-wide announcement?

…

Smiling, Shi Feng said, “Make the announcement!”

Realm-wide announcements were extremely rare in the Greater God’s Domain. Normally, players could only trigger a realm-wide announcement after completing a Main Storyline Quest in the Greater God’s Domain or making great achievements such as slaying one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Calamities.

Meanwhile, realm-wide announcements were a great way to increase one’s fame. Now that Shi Feng was given the opportunity to spread his fame across the Starlight Realm, he naturally wouldn’t refuse it. After all, this would make it a lot more convenient for him to do various things.

…

System: Do you wish to make the announcement using your current false identity of Ye Feng?

…

“Yes.” Shi Feng agreed to the prompt without hesitation.

Although he could use his true identity to announce his Great Grandmaster status, doing so would expose his ability to travel freely between worlds. Rather than invite unnecessary trouble for himself, he would be better off announcing his achievement under a false identity. Very few people could see through the Sacred Phantom Ring’s disguise effect, anyway.

Immediately, a system announcement echoed throughout the entire Starlight Realm.

…

System Announcement: Congratulations to Ye Feng on becoming the first person to reach the rank of Great Grandmaster Magician in a hundred years! Rewarding 20 Starlight Realm Reputation Points.

…

The announcement repeated three times, stupefying many players across the Starlight Realm.

“Someone got promoted into a Great Grandmaster Magician?”

“Amazing! Incredible! I always thought players couldn’t become Great Grandmaster Magicians! I didn’t think someone would actually succeed!”

“This is beyond incredible! This is a Great Grandmaster Magician we are talking about! There aren’t even 100 of such existences in our current era, and every one of these existences is a big shot that even apex powers will try to recruit as Honorary Elders!”

“Isn’t that just nonsense? We are only talking about a Magician here. Even if the various apex powers place great importance on Great Grandmaster Magicians, there’s no way these powers would use an Honorary Elder position as an enticement. That position holds as much authority as the Vice Guild Leader position. Even the helmsmen of conglomerates will have to show respect to the Honorary Elders of apex powers.”

“How ignorant of you! Don’t you know that Great Grandmaster Magicians can already draw Great Grandmaster Magic Arrays? Those are magic arrays used to safeguard outer-realm fortresses and cities! Do you have any idea how big of a difference there is between a stronghold that’s protected by a Great Grandmaster Magic Array and a stronghold that isn’t protected by one? Ten times! There will be a tenfold difference at the very minimum!”

“Ten? Isn’t that too much of an exaggeration?”

“Not at all. Grandmaster Magic Arrays can, at best, reach the Tier 5 standard, but Great Grandmaster Magic Arrays can reach the Tier 6 standard. Any city protected by a Great Grandmaster Defensive Magic Array can easily withstand a bombardment of Tier 6 Spells. With the support of such a defensive magic array, the various powers can drastically reduce the number of Tier 6 experts they dispatch to protect these foreign installations. They can then use the additional manpower to do other things or establish new outer-realm fortresses and cities. So, do you still think Great Grandmaster Magicians aren’t incredible?”

…

Many players expressed their confusion toward the latest system announcement, failing to comprehend the significance of a Great Grandmaster Magician. However, when the Starlight Realm’s various powers saw the system announcement, they instantly went into an uproar.

Ordinary players might not know the value of Great Grandmaster Magicians, but the Starlight Realm’s various powers knew that the appearance of a Great Grandmaster Magician was a major event that could rewrite the status quo in the Starlight Realm.

…

Starlight Realm, Starlight Empire, Starlight Holy City:

The Starlight Holy City was the most prosperous city in the Starlight Realm, with a player population of one billion. Practically all powers in the Starlight Realm wished to secure themselves a place in this city. However, due to the Holy City’s limited space, even upper-ranking hegemonic powers had difficulty securing themselves a spot in the city.

Currently, on the top floor of a humongous Battle Arena in the Holy City, two Level 220, Tier 6 players clad in Legendary Equipment Sets and wielding Legendary Weapons were duking it out with one another. The strength both parties exhibited closely rivaled Tier 6 Gods of the same level.

While these two players were dueling each other, many players cheered and applauded as they spectated the match. Among these spectators, many were titled experts who had already reached Tier 6.

“As expected of the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Seven Luminaries League. Even the matches in the A-League are already such a spectacle to behold. I really cannot imagine what kind of monsters would be in the S-League.”

“It’s a pity the Starlight Realm isn’t a Higher Realm. At best, we can only receive the broadcast of A-Leagues here.”

“It can’t be helped. Our Realm has never managed to get into the top 100 in the Realm Wars. After losing to the Sky River Realm last time, it became even more difficult for us to get into the top 100.”

…

While the people on the spectator stands were discussing the ongoing match, a woman with ethereal beauty quietly observed the match from a VIP room on the second floor. However, the woman shifted her attention away from the stage when a Level 220, Tier 6 Guardian Knight entered the room.

“Did you find anything about Ye Feng?” the woman asked.

“Young Miss, I have already mobilized all available manpower to investigate this person, but we have yet to acquire any reliable information thus far,” the Guardian Knight answered.

If other people could see how respectfully this Tier 6 Guardian Knight behaved to the woman, they would definitely be given a fright. After all, the Guardian Knight was fully clad in Legendary Equipment and radiated strength rivaling Tier 6 Gods.

However, the two female bodyguards standing next to the woman were unfazed by this situation.

Frey, the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Fourth Princess. This name could make any upper-ranking hegemonic power in the Starlight Realm tremble with fear. Even Tier 6 Saints would have to behave deferentially to her, let alone experts that only rivaled Tier 6 Gods.

“Still nothing?” Frey frowned, her tone growing a little cold.

“It’s not that we didn’t find any information at all. It’s just that the information we found is a little too unreliable,” the Guardian Knight hurriedly corrected himself. “According to the insider information we collected from the Seven Luminaries Alliance, the name Ye Feng has appeared in the Miniature Ancient World that you have previously visited, Young Miss. Only, I don’t think that person is likely to be…”

“The same name has appeared in that Miniature Ancient World before?” Growing curious, Frey asked, “Who is he?”

Anxiously, the Guardian Knight answered, “He is the former Guild Leader of a second-rate Guild named Shadow. At the same time, he is also Zero Wing’s current Acting Guild Leader!”
