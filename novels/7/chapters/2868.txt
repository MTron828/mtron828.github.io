Chapter 2869 - Apex Gathering

Zero Wing Residence, top-floor reception room:

As the primary Guild Residence of a Main City, Zero Wing’s Guild Hall was a 30-story-tall building almost 200 meters high. One had an unobstructed view of the entire Zero Wing City if one looked out the top-floor reception room’s windows.

Since Zero Wing City was located in a snowland and backed by the endless sea, the view here was unique for players who often operated around NPC cities surrounded by greenery.

Unfortunately, none of the dozen or so people currently seated in the reception room showed any interest in admiring this beautiful scenery. Instead, they focused on sizing up each other.

“Zero Wing City has attracted a lot of bigwigs.” Yuan Tiexin was a little shocked as he observed the room’s occupants. “Mythology’s Grand Elder Situ Qingtian, Netherworld Empire’s Grand Elder Nether King Relos, and even the Solar Temple’s Honorary Elder Chiyang Tianhe. It seems these Guilds are serious this time.”

Three of the Five Great Super Guilds had sent representatives to Zero Wing City. Moreover, these representatives were all key figures in their respective Guilds’ management, individuals fully capable of making decisions on behalf of their respective Guilds. Usually, meeting even one of these individuals would be challenging. Yet, three of them had gathered in Zero Wing City.

However, Yuan Tiexin’s surprise didn’t last too long.

After all, Zero Wing had created too huge a scene this time; the Five Great Super Guilds could no longer ignore it.

At this stage of the game, there was probably no Guild uninterested in a teleportation array that could facilitate unrestricted travel between the two main continents. The ongoing War of Worlds only served to make this intercontinental teleportation array even more precious. If not for another important matter occupying the Secret Pavilion’s Guild Leader, Yuan Tiexin wouldn’t be the one sitting in this room, representing the Secret Pavilion.

“Netherworld Empire sure moved fast. It has been active only on the western continent all this time, yet it sent an old guy like the Nether King here,” Matt of Mythology said, surprise appearing in his eyes as he looked at a bald old man in a white robe. “It hasn’t been long since I last met him, yet this old guy’s strength has already improved so much. The Mana he’s radiating has nearly doubled in density. I also see two new pieces of equipment on him.”

“That’s normal. He wouldn’t have given Odin so much trouble if he hasn’t made any significant improvements after all this time,” Situ Qingtian, the white-haired old man seated beside Matt, said calmly. He then glanced at the masked young man standing behind Relos and continued, “That masked kid behind Nether King, though, is quite something. Although I can’t say for certain, he shouldn’t be any weaker than Prosciutto.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Surprised by Situ Qingtian’s assessment, Matt looked toward the masked youth and asked, “Is he that strong?”

The Silver Ghost Prosciutto was already the strongest among Mythology’s younger generation. Not only did he possess excellent equipment, but his Mana Body had even exceeded the 110% Completion Rate already. Now, only a handful of people within the Guild could defeat him.

After hearing Situ Qingtian’s assessment, Cold Shadow, who sat on the elderly man’s other side, also looked at the masked youth in surprise.

Situ Qingtian had instructed countless students, and his insight was many times superior to that of youngsters like Matt and herself. Since Situ Qingtian had given the masked youth such an evaluation, the youth definitely couldn’t be underestimated.

“It’s not just that masked kid. The long-haired kid sitting beside Chiyang Tianhe isn’t any weaker, either,” Situ Qingtian said, smiling as he looked at the long-haired, male youth seated some distance away from him. “I have to say that times have changed. He looks to be around twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, yet he has already reached the peak of the Domain Realm’s second step. It’s been three decades since I last saw such talent.”

When Situ Qingtian finished speaking, Cold Shadow was surprised again. Even now, she was barely touching the fringes of the Domain Realm’s second step, and it would still take a lot of time and effort for her to reach it, let alone climb to the peak of the second step.

Experts capable of reaching this step were as rare as a phoenix’s feather in the virtual gaming industry. If such an expert could take one more step forward, they would become an existence standing at the very apex of God’s Domain.

Situ Qingtian did not lower his voice when speaking. He also didn’t talk through a private channel. Hence, every Tier 4 expert in the reception room heard his words loud and clear.

All of the youths present, including Purple Jade and Netherworld Empire’s masked youth, turned reflexively to look at the long-haired youth carrying the blood-red greatsword, their eyes full of fighting spirit.

“Situ Qingtian, you’re still the same gossipy bastard as before!” Chiyang Tianhe said, glaring at Situ Qingtian. “While our kid has indeed made a breakthrough recently, do you think I can’t see through that young lass beside you? “If I’m not mistaken, she has at least four Fragmented Legendary items on her, right?”

As soon as Chiyang Tianhe finished speaking, everyone’s head snapped toward Cold Shadow. The masked youth and the long-haired youth, in particular, looked at her with fiery gazes.

Nowadays, Epic Weapons and Equipment were a lot more common in God’s Domain. Fragmented Legendary items, on the other hand, were still incredibly rare even for the various superpowers. Even in Netherworld Empire and Solar Temple, less than 30% of their Tier 4 experts had even one Fragmented Legendary item, while their Grand Elders would be fortunate to have one or two Fragmented Legendary items.

Yet, Chiyang Tianhe had revealed that Cold Shadow owned at least four Fragmented Legendary items. How could they not envy her?

After reaching their level, every Fragmented Legendary item could provide them with significant improvements. The total improvement four Fragmented Legendary items could provide would be massive.

“This old bastard!” Cold Shadow glared at Chiyang Tianhe.

A display of talent would, at most, make others envious. However, weapons and equipment were a different story. Unlike talent, others could snatch these items. With her current strength, she wouldn’t stand a chance if two or more of the people present attacked her. After all, every person in the room was a bona fide monster.

Looking at Cold Shadow, Chiyang Tianhe smiled and asked, “What is it? Do you wish to take action, young lass?” “Chiyang Tianhe!” Glaring at Chiyang Tianhe coldly, Situ Qingtian threatened, “Do you think we won’t dare make a move?”

Immediately, the atmosphere in the room solidified, an indescribable sense of coldness spreading throughout the room. At this development, the members of Mythology and Solar Temple instinctively gripped their weapons.

If an ordinary Tier 4 expert were to stand in this heavy atmosphere, they would most likely break out in a cold sweat and flee the scene immediately.

“What rotten luck. Just what are these people trying to do?”

Yuan Tiexin grew a little nervous as he looked at the members of the two Super Guilds.

Mythology’s and Solar Temple’s Tier 4 experts were far from ordinary. This was especially true for Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe. A fight between them would be a calamity. The others in the room might even become collateral damage if things got too out of hand.

To make matters worse, Netherworld Empire’s members also showed signs of restlessness. Evidently, if Mythology and Solar Temple fought, Netherworld Empire wouldn’t mind joining in the fray.

Just as a fight was about to ensue, the woman standing by the room’s door all this time suddenly stepped forward. She was none other than Fire Dance. At this time, not only was Fire Dance at Level 155 already, but the quality of the Mana she radiated was also much more powerful than when she first entered the statue room.

Looking at the members of Mythology and Solar Temple, Fire Dance warned, “Everyone! This is Zero Wing’s territory. Fighting is forbidden here. I ask you to show Zero Wing some respect.”

“Show Zero Wing respect?” Glancing at Fire Dance, Chiyang Tianhe said nonchalantly, “Sure. As long as you can get Situ to shut up, I won’t have any problems!”

Not one to fall behind, Situ Qingtian looked at Fire Dance and said, “Young lady, this old man isn’t trying to disrespect Zero Wing, but Chiyang Tianhe has gone too far. So long as you can get that old ghost to apologize to us, we won’t take any direct action.”

The two old men’s rejoinders rendered Yuan Tiexin and Purple Jade speechless. Fire Dance was indeed powerful, but she was still slightly weaker than the two old men. At most, she could contend against the younger generation of Mythology and Solar Temple. Hence, it was impossible for her to silence the two Guilds all by herself.

Moreover, based on the words spoken by Chiyang Tianhe and Situ Qingtian, the two of them were clearly trying to make a show of power to Zero Wing. If Fire Dance failed to deal with this situation appropriately, she would make a fool of herself and Zero Wing.

However, without any hesitation, Fire Dance calmly told the two old men, “If you two refuse to give up, then please leave Zero Wing City. Zero Wing does not welcome such guests!”
