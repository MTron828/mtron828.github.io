Chapter 617 – Seventeen Tier 6 Players

“The Blaze Conglomerate’s Heart Sword?” When Azure Shadow heard the name that came out of Shi Feng’s mouth, he couldn’t help but be surprised. “Do you know Miss Billowing Water, Instructor Black Flame?”

Azure Shadow was fortunate enough to participate in a training camp hosted by the Galaxy Conglomerate in the past. While there, he had heard many tales of a monstrous talent capable of rivaling Frey, the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Fourth Princess.

Meanwhile, the monstrously talented person was the Blaze Conglomerate’s Eldest Young Miss Weilan, a.k.a. Billowing Water.

Although Billowing Water currently only ranked within the Sacred Glory List’s top 100, she was one of the few experts capable of fighting Golden Masters despite having mastered no Gold Combat Techniques herself.

Because of her capabilities, many God’s Domain critics have commented that Billowing Water could absolutely rank among the Divine Glory List in the future.

“I guess you can say that we are partners of sorts,” Shi Feng answered after giving the question some thought. “We were part of the same team previously, and we conducted a couple of transactions.”

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s answer, Azure Shadow and the others couldn’t help but cast looks of admiration at Shi Feng.

Billowing Water was the Blaze Conglomerate’s First Successor. She was a big shot who even Night Watch City’s City Lord would have little chance to come into contact with. And even if they were to meet, it was unlikely they could find a common topic to talk about, let alone become partners and conduct transactions.

While big shots like Billowing Water might require a lot of resources in both the Greater God’s Domain and the Greater World, these resources were not things that the average person could access. Anyone who could provide these resources were bound to be extraordinary individuals.

“Should we help her, Guild Leader?” Gentle Snow asked when she saw Billowing Water getting surrounded once again. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

It might not seem like Billowing Water was in any life-threatening danger, but that would only be true for now. Once all of the 1,000 Holy Race experts managed to encircle her completely, Billowing Water would no longer have any opportunities to break through. Not to mention, as the fight dragged on, the noise made would most certainly attract the attention of nearby Holy Race players. At that time, many more Holy Race experts would join the chase.

The only way Billowing Water could truly escape her current predicament was if she could quickly kill all 1,000 of the Holy Race experts chasing after her. But, evidently, she couldn’t accomplish that by herself.

“Since we’ve met, we naturally have to help out. Let’s go,” Shi Feng said, nodding.

If Shi Feng wasn’t acquainted with Billowing Water, he would have most likely chosen to turn a blind eye to her predicament. After all, the Western Continent was the Holy Race’s territory. It was especially so for the Nameless City. Engaging one of the Holy Race’s player legions here wouldn’t be wise. So long as a fight broke out, they would have to face endless harassment from nearby Holy Race experts, and they would be unable to explore the Nameless City properly.

However, since Billowing Water was one of his partners, Shi Feng naturally couldn’t just stand by and watch the Holy Race experts kill her.

Subsequently, under Shi Feng’s command, everyone swiftly advanced toward Billowing Water’s location.

Although Shi Feng and the others did not make any noise in their approach, because their team had over 30 members, their approach quickly attracted the attention of Billowing Water and the Holy Race experts attacking her.

“Run away! Quickly run away!” When Billowing Water saw Shi Feng among the group of human players approaching her, she didn’t relax. On the contrary, her expression turned even grimmer as she shouted for Shi Feng’s group to run away. “These aren’t your average Holy Race players! Quickly head back to Seven Luminaries Town and inform everyone that the Holy Race has already found a way to break the town’s defenses! Seven Luminaries Town is their next target!”

“How dare you humans trespass on our territory?! None of you should think of leaving with your lives!” the commander of the Holy Race legion, a Level 167 Beast Berserker, bellowed when he saw Shi Feng’s approaching group. “Everyone, split up and surround the new trespassers! I’ll keep this woman pinned! We must not let them spread the news!”

Following the Beast Berserker’s command, the entire legion of Holy Race experts quickly cast aside Billowing Water and switched their attention toward Shi Feng’s team. Close to a hundred party and team leader-ranked Holy Race experts charged straight toward Shi Feng’s team, while the rest of the legion split up to form an encirclement.

When Billowing Water saw this, her expression quickly turned ugly.

The legion pursuing her was unlike any other. Even the legion’s party leaders possessed strength rivaling Moon Bamboo, the Dawnlight Party’s vice party leader, while the legion’s team leaders rivaled Sky Pivot, the Dawnlight Party’s party leader.

If not for her encountering a fortuitous opportunity in the Nameless City’s core region, which allowed her to repair a significant portion of her Fragmented Divine Weapon, she would have long been killed by this extraordinary legion.

Unfortunately, Billowing Water couldn’t afford to get distracted any longer as she needed to focus on surviving against the Holy Race legion’s commander.

A Beast Berserker!

The Beast Berserker class was a Peak Class among the Holy Race. But despite its lower rank, it was superior to even the human race’s Saint Classes. Previously, in order to cover for Billowing Water’s escape, Sky Pivot and Moon Bamboo had chosen to face the Beast Berserker in a frontal confrontation. However, after only three exchanges, Sky Pivot and Moon Bamboo fell; they didn’t even manage to distract the Beast Berserker for five seconds. The other party’s strength was beyond terrifying.

Immediately, Billowing Water gathered her scattered Formless Twilight and transformed it into a greatsword, the weapon’s mere presence destabilizing the surrounding space. With the greatsword in hand, Billowing Water’s Strength had also increased substantially. Now, her Strength was slightly superior to even Level 170 Divine monsters.

“Escape is no longer an option for you all,” the Beast Berserker said. However, instead of hurrying to eliminate Billowing Water, he turned to look at Shi Feng’s team and sneered. “Since you dared to steal that item from us, I will show you the consequences of meddling with our affairs.”

When the Beast Berserker commander finished speaking, the Holy Race legion’s party and team leaders had already arrived within 100 yards of Shi Feng’s team. For Tier 5 players, this was a distance that could be crossed in a single breath.

“This should be close enough. Everyone, take action,” Shi Feng commanded when he saw the remaining distance between his team and the Holy Race legion’s party and team leaders.

Upon receiving Shi Feng’s command, Azure Shadow and the others promptly stopped concealing their information and auras with their Black Cloaks. Immediately, seventeen illusory worlds descended upon the street and overlapped each other. At the same time, frightening Divine Might swept across the entire street, briefly causing all Holy Race players within a 3,000-yard radius to lose focus.
