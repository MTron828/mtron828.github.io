Chapter 3835 - 909 - Desolate Star Auction

“You call that a bargain? A broken tablet for 20,000 and a Fragmented Divine Artifact for 30,000? What do you take Eternal Gold Coins for? Loose change?” Drifting Bean protested.

Although Drifting Bean had never been to the Eternal Realm, she knew that Eternal Coins weren’t easy to come by. Most players earned the Eternal Realm’s currency by completing quests and trading with NPCs, and the output was pitifully low. To make matters worse, it cost a fortune to use the teleportation services of NPC Cities. Players seeking to teleport to NPC Fortresses situated in Level 200-plus maps had to pay at least two Eternal Gold per teleportation. Players also had to pay a hefty price to rest in NPC Fortresses.

Because of all these expenses, most upper-ranking hegemonic powers currently operating in the Eternal Realm had only accumulated around 40,000 Eternal Gold thus far.

To establish itself quickly in the Eternal Realm, the Blood Wing adventurer team also worked hard to acquire Eternal Coins. Even so, Blood Wing had only acquired a little over 100,000 Eternal Gold thus far.

Thirty thousand Eternal Gold!

This was already enough money to hire Blood Wing’s main force to help raid multiple Taboo Dungeons. Moreover, Blood Wing wouldn’t necessarily be able to find such offers.

While Drifting Bean was voicing her displeasure, Endless Scars fiddled with her quantum watch and sent a list to Xia Qingying, whose eyes were glued on the Sage’s Will. Then, she said, “Qingying, if you want a good weapon, Blood Wing has some that are comparable to that Sage’s Will. I can sell one to you for 20,000 Eternal Gold.”

“Will that be alright?” When Xia Qingying saw the statistics of the several Fragmented Divine Staffs Endless Scars had sent to her, she was immediately tempted.

Fragmented Divine Artifacts were of great significance to any power. They weren’t items that could be obtained easily. Oftentimes, much manpower and resources had to be invested to obtain just one Fragmented Divine Artifact.

Under normal circumstances, no power would sell its Fragmented Divine Artifacts. The only reason some powers were willing to do so now was for the sake of the barely explored Eternal Realm. Otherwise, they wouldn’t sell their Fragmented Divine Artifacts for even 300,000 Eternal Gold, let alone 30,000.

In the current God’s Domain, it was definitely a bargain to acquire a Fragmented Divine Artifact for 20,000 Eternal Gold. As Blood Wing was an adventurer team, obtaining Fragmented Divine Artifacts wasn’t easy. If Endless Scars arbitrarily sold one to an outsider for such a low price, it would cause dissatisfaction among the adventurer team’s members.

“Big Sis Xia, don’t worry. The commander has the authority to do this much,” Drifting Bean said, chuckling when she saw Xia Qingying’s worry. Then, she turned to Shi Feng and stated proudly, “Guild Leader Black Flame, seeing as you come from the same world as the commander, if you want a Fragmented Divine Artifact, the commander should be able to sell one to you cheaply as well. It’ll be much cheaper than anything you can get from the market.”

At Drifting Bean’s words, the Galaxy Shop’s salesperson couldn’t help envying Shi Feng and Xia Qingying.

Thirty thousand Eternal Gold was by no means an exorbitant price for a Fragmented Divine Artifact in today’s market. If one could buy a Fragmented Divine Artifact for 20,000 Eternal Gold, one could resell it immediately for a profit of 10,000 Eternal Gold. Not even the executives of conglomerates could receive such a privilege.

“Why you little…!” Endless Scars was at a loss for words on Drifting Bean’s initiative. However, when she considered how Xia Qingying was trying to help Shi Feng establish a partnership with Blood Wing, she ultimately decided against refuting the offer Drifting Bean made to Shi Feng.

“I’ll pass. Commander Scars already has enough on her plate running her adventurer team,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. He might have considered it if it was an offer to purchase Fragmented Divine Artifacts in bulk, but just one piece didn’t interest him. He turned back to the Galaxy Shop’s salesperson and continued, “I want this tablet. Can we sign the contract now?”

“Dear customer, do you really want this tablet?” The salesperson looked at Shi Feng in surprise. After overhearing Drifting Bean’s offer, he originally thought he wouldn’t be making any sales to Xia Qingying’s group. He hadn’t expected Shi Feng to buy the expensive stone tablet.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Of course. Since this tablet comes from the same primordial ruin as that staff, it should have its secrets. If I can uncover these secrets, I should make a good profit,” Shi Feng said, feigning excitement. “Are you not going to sell it?”

“Sell! Of course, we’re selling it!” The salesperson promptly took out the sales contract for the stone tablet, fearing that Shi Feng might regret his decision.

While Shi Feng was completing his purchase, Drifting Bean and Endless Scars looked at him in confusion. They hadn’t expected Shi Feng to be indifferent to a Fragmented Divine Artifact.

Is he the type of person who dislikes owing favors? Endless Scars wondered. She couldn’t figure out what kind of person Shi Feng was.

Many interests were linked between the Greater God’s Domain and the Greater World. Soon after her adventurer team saw success, many friends and family sought her help. Although this development gave her many problems, it also allowed her to view the world around her with much greater clarity.

If there was an opportunity to obtain a Fragmented Divine Artifact cheaply, few people could resist taking advantage of it. Even the helmsmen of upper-ranking hegemonic powers couldn’t necessarily resist it, let alone the Guild Leader of an upstart Guild.

“Big Sis Xia, there’s nothing more I can do to help you. How can he refuse such a good opportunity?” Drifting Bean whispered to Xia Qingying in exasperation. She sincerely felt that Shi Feng was an idiot. After all, by refusing her offer, he missed out on a good deal and an opportunity to establish closer ties with Endless Scars.

Xia Qingying was also at a loss. Although she knew that Shi Feng was wealthy enough not to care about making a quick profit, she couldn’t understand why he would dismiss the opportunity to get closer to Endless Scars.

Subsequently, after Shi Feng was done shopping at the Galaxy Shop, he visited several dozen other stalls and purchased a large amount of Mana Sealing Wood. He also had these sellers deliver the Mana Sealing Wood to various NPC Cities situated in various Realms for Xia Qingying to collect.

About two hours later, the female head attendant led Shi Feng and the others to Desolate Star City’s high-end auction venue. Far fewer guests were in the auction venue’s lobby than in the trade fair outside. Moreover, even the weakest guest was a one-star grandmaster. The leaders of some attending groups were even great grandmasters, existences rarely seen on the Starlight Continent.

“Greetings, distinguished guests. Welcome to the Desolate Star Auction. May I know if you would like to sit in the general area or in a private room?” the female receptionist at the front desk asked when Xia Qingying’s group approached her. “Seating in the general area is free, while the private rooms cost one hundred Eternal Gold each.”

“Give us a private room. We don’t want others to know what we buy,” Drifting Bean said.

“Understood. It just so happens we have one room left,” the receptionist said after checking the electronic tablet in front of her. “I’ll reserve it for you now.”

However, before the receptionist could confirm the reservation, someone suddenly shouted for her to stop.

“Hold it! That last room belongs to us! Have them go to the general area!”

As soon as these words fell, a group escorted by one of Desolate Star City’s male head attendants entered the lobby. Two young men, one chubby and one handsome, walked at the head of the group. Following them were six three-star grandmasters and one great grandmaster dressed like bodyguards. The one who spoke just now was the chubby young man. When Shi Feng and Xia Qingying saw these people, they were momentarily stunned.

Although they did not recognize the chubby young man, they were very familiar with the handsome young man. This was because the other party was Xiao Quan, the son of Silver Frost City’s City Lord.
