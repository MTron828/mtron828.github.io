Chapter 2500 – Frightening Improvement

In God’s Domain, Tier 3 NPCs were considered powerhouses that could protect NPC cities. However, players only became powerhouses once they had unlocked their Mana Bodies’ full potential.

Only with a fully unlocked Mana Body could players enter and leave certain locations freely. If they tried to do so without unlocking their Mana Body, only death would await them.

The Star Tomb Regional Dungeon’s entry requirements were actually quite low. Even Tier 3 players that hadn’t fully unlocked their Mana Bodies could explore the area, albeit barely.

In comparison, certain unique areas were full of incredibly corrosive energy, and Tier 3 players wouldn’t last more than five minutes in these areas without unlocking their Mana Bodies’ full potential. Unlocking their Mana Bodies was the only way players could protect themselves against the corrosive energy.

This was why players were only considered powerhouses once they had fully unlocked their Mana Bodies. Most importantly, the Skills and Spells players used would be far stronger once they had unlocked their Mana Bodies than those who hadn’t.

So, this is an Epic Mana Body? Astonishment colored Shi Feng’s features as he sensed the dense Mana radiating from his body.

He had never dreamed that an Epic Mana body would be this powerful.

Normally, a Mana Body relied on its own Mana to function, but his Mana Body could attract ambient mana and use it to strengthen and nourish itself.

His Epic Mana Body had also coated his body with a thin barrier of Mana. The barrier was easy to miss if one weren’t paying close attention. It almost felt like a skin-tight suit. It trapped a significant portion of the Mana radiating from him, drastically reducing the amount of Mana wasted. Not only did this Mana Barrier improve his recovery, but it also ensured that the Mana around him was far denser than normal.

The addition of this Mana Barrier alone doubled or tripled his survivability in the fields, especially in low-Mana environments. When he fought in such harsh environments, he wouldn’t have to worry about losing a significant portion of his combat power.

Shi Feng tried to manipulate his Mana Body, guiding the Mana around him into his hands. He instantly felt like a black hole as the ambient Mana gathered around him. In the blink of an eye, a faint layer of Mana mist formed on the surface of his palms.

Shi Feng’s fist then shot out as he punched the empty air.

Peng!

Space exploded around his fist as if the punch had created a vacuum. Space around him trembled at the power of the strike, and the core room’s magic barrier shuddered.

With this power, I can now likely solo a Mythic monster of the same level, even without my Berserk Skills. Shi Feng gasped when he saw the results of his punch.

He had merely executed a normal punch, and he didn’t even have his weapons equipped.

The difference between a player’s Attack Power with a weapon and without one in God’s Domain was massive.

With Killing Ray equipped, his prior punches had only been able to break the sound barrier. He had only been able to make space tremble and create spatial tears when he used the Secret Technique, Lightning Flash.

Yet now, without any techniques or weapons, he could exhibit power on par with when he wielded Killing Ray...

An Epic Mana Body provided horrific power!

In his opinion, although Mana Bodies massively boosted players’ strength, they didn’t provide this much power. The benefits of unlocking his Mana Body thus far could already rival that of a Fragmented Legendary Weapon.

Moreover, he had only unlocked 100% of his Mana Body’s potential. If he could push beyond that, his strength would rise to a whole new level.

After 100%, every additional percent would provide tremendous power. As far as Shi Feng knew, players had only reached 120% of their Mana Bodies’ potential in the past. It was easy to imagine how frighteningly powerful 120% of an Epic Mana Body’s potential would be.

Even transcending tiers would be possible.

Elated, Shi Feng started to practice Eliadi’s Mana Technique.

He had now unlocked 100% of his Mana Body’s potential. Going beyond that would take some time, and it would be as difficult as creating a Master Magic Array for an Apprentice Magician.

Fortunately, unlocking more than 100% of his Epic Mana Body wasn’t the only way to transcend tiers. He could also rely on the help of a Mana Technique. He had experienced Eliadi’s Holy Annihilation personally, and despite suppressing herself to Tier 3, the Heavenly Blue Saint’s attack could instant-kill or heavily injure Tier 4 beings. If Shi Feng could master Eliadi’s Holy Annihilation, the Mana Technique would prove significantly helpful.

He hadn’t been able to learn the technique earlier since he hadn’t unlocked his Mana Body fully yet, but now that he had, he could truly practice the Holy Annihilation.

Mana Techniques weren’t like combat techniques. Combat techniques consumed the user’s Stamina and Concentration, but Mana Techniques, on the other hand, only consumed Concentration. Players generally avoided using combat techniques in harsh environments, trying to conserve their Stamina due to the heavy burden the environment placed on them. However, with a few exceptions, these harsh environments did not affect players’ Concentration consumption.

Hence, God’s Domain’s experts that had grasped Mana Techniques, whether self-taught or learned from the system, had an easier time exploring the world, especially the maps with harsh environments.

Now that Shi Feng had achieved his goals in visiting the western continent, he needed to search for Solomon’s Sword’s remaining fragments to maintain his advantages and pave a smoother path for Aqua Rose and his other comrades as they aimed for Tier 4. If he put the task off, it would only be a matter of time before the various superpowers, with how fast they were developing, would overpower Zero Wing.

If he could learn Eliadi’s Mana Technique now, not only would he have a much better chance of securing the fragments of Solomon’s Sword, but he could also teach the technique to Aqua Rose and the others.

As Shi Feng tried to mimic the way Eliadi had executed the First Sword, Lightshadow, the more the Heavenly Blue Saint amazed him. Eliadi’s Mana Technique even seemed slightly stronger than the Mana Techniques the Demon God, Atlock, had used.

The First Sword, Lightshadow, used all seven elements, and executing the strike proved even more difficult than Lightning Flash, a Bronze Combat Technique. Shi Feng needed to channel and gather his Mana for several seconds before he could attempt to execute Lightshadow.

Atlock had also needed some preparation time before executing his Mana Technique. The Demon God had spent several seconds preparing the black hole, the last attack he had used against Shi Feng. Even though Atlock had executed the Mana Technique through his phantom, that phantom had still been at the Tier 5 standard.

The goddess, on the other hand, had executed Lightshadow, Holy Devour, and Holy Annihilation without any preparation time whatsoever. On the contrary, it has seemed as if she had been able to pause her technique, releasing her attack when she needed to in a systematic manner. When Shi Feng thought about that fight, he realized the intervals between each of her attacks had been exactly the same. Even at the Tier 3 standard, Eliadi had accomplished the feat.

As Shi Feng continued to practice Lightshadow, however, he was able to reduce the time he needed before executing the technique. Initially, he spent nearly eight minutes preparing his strike, but now, he could do so after around five minutes. The more Shi Feng practiced, the more he understood about Mana control.

Two hours... Six hours... Twelve hours...

While Shi Feng was immersed in his training, he received a call request from Fithalia.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, Mythology’s people are back. They are all gathered in the Starlight Bar, and I think they’ve found a way to deal with your Divine Dragon. More of them have arrived, as well. Now, there are more than 30 players in their group,” Fithalia reported with a somber expression.

Dealing with the dozen-plus experts had already been a struggle, but now, more than double had shown up in the Starlight Fortress. Even if Zero Wing, Divine Tribe, and Hell Legion gathered all of their peak experts in the fortress, suppressing these Mythology players would still prove difficult.

They’ve returned so soon?” Shi Feng muttered in surprise. However, when he glanced at the time, he realized that he had been training for over half a day. It had felt like time had passed even more quickly than when he had worked to unlock his Mana Body. He then sheathed his swords and grinned. “Alright, I’ll be right there.”

With that, Shi Feng disconnected the call and left the core room.
