Chapter 421 – Half-Step Divine Artifact F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When Shi Feng swung the Winter of Eternal Night, it was as if time had become frozen. All mana fluctuations occurring in the area ceased to exist, and even the wind had stopped blowing.

Originally, well over a hundred attacks could be seen targeting Shi Feng. Now, though, only one bladeless sword could be seen clashing with the Winter of Eternal Night.

The collision of weapons did not result in an intense reaction as everyone expected. There was no loud explosion or powerful shockwave following the collision. Instead, all that followed was a crisp sound of metal colliding.

Immediately afterward, everyone saw Hidden Wind getting sent flying backward like a cannonball. Even when his feet made contact with the ground, he stumbled dozens of steps before he could steady his figure. In addition, the hand that wielded the bladeless sword trembled uncontrollably, and over one-third of his previously full HP bar was missing.

“How is this possible?”

The white-haired old man from the Heavenly God Corporation was greatly shocked when he saw Hidden Wind losing over one-third of his HP.

The old man was well aware of Hidden Wind’s strength and acknowledged it from the bottom of his heart. He also knew Hidden Wind’s ultimate goal was to get into the Luminous Glory List’s top 20. It was why Hidden Wind had constantly been training and seeking to challenge a bona fide Saint. After all, anyone who managed to enter the Luminous Glory List’s top 30 would already have the strength of a Saint of the same level and tier. So, if Hidden Wind didn’t have the strength to fight against a Saint, he couldn’t even get into the Luminous Glory List’s top 30, let alone the top 20.

However, the old man never thought there would still be such a huge gap between Hidden Wind and an actual Saint.

Not only did Shi Feng repulse Hidden Wind, but he had even taken more than one-third of Hidden Wind’s HP with just one attack. In other words, Shi Feng would only need three attacks to kill Hidden Wind. Moreover, they didn’t even need to be direct hits.

It should be known that Hidden Wind already ranked 42nd on the Luminous Glory List several months ago. After entering the Holy World, Hidden Wind fought numerous battles, large and small. He also clashed with many older generation monsters, and not once had he suffered defeat. Because of his constant fighting, Hidden Wind had been continuously growing stronger. At this point, many people even speculated that Hidden Wind was already strong enough to rank within the top 30. Yet, now…

Before the white-haired old man could recover from his shock, Shi Feng executed two more Holy Annihilations in quick succession, each one faster than the one before.

However, although Shi Feng’s attacks had sped up, Hidden Wind’s defense also grew stronger and stronger. Even after blocking Shi Feng’s third Holy Annihilation, Hidden Wind remained alive, contrary to everyone’s expectations. Meanwhile, seeing that he only had one-fifth of his HP left, Hidden Wind took out a Grandmaster Regeneration Potion and consumed it, instantly recovering all of his lost HP. Then…

Without hesitation, Hidden Wind activated a Tier 5 Instantaneous Movement Scroll and vanished from everyone’s sight…

This turn of events dumbfounded everyone.

This was the 42nd Luminous Glory expert they were talking about!

Yet, Hidden Wind had fled after receiving three blows from Shi Feng…

“What should we do, Elder Kong?” a Level 140 Shield Warrior from the Heavenly God Corporation asked the white-haired old man.

The Heavenly God Corporation’s team was originally at a numerical disadvantage already when it came to fifth-floor experts. Now that Shi Feng had scared Hidden Wind, their trump card, away, how were they supposed to win this battle?

“Everyone, retreat!” Elder Kong shouted as he reluctantly glanced at the treasure chest on the caravan’s carriage.

However, after saying so, Elder Kong did not hesitate as he took out a Tier 5 Instantaneous Movement Scroll and activated it, instantly reappearing several thousand yards away.

“They’re gone, just like that?” The bow-wielding old man from the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate couldn’t help but doubt his eyes when he saw the Heavenly God Corporation’s team members fleeing.

“What else can they do but retreat?” the muscular man standing next to the bow-wielding old man said jokingly. “We have a Saint on our side. They’d have to be delusional if they think they beat us.”

“You’re right.” The bow-wielding old man chuckled. “But the young miss has really given us a big surprise this time. I didn’t think she could get a Saint of all people to help us. With such an expert on our side, Old Kong’s defeat was inevitable.”

“It seems I’m going to have to interrogate that little girl,” Flint said, nodding in agreement with the bow-wielding old man’s words. He was truly frightened by Cheng Xin’s capability.

It might not be difficult to hire the help of a Saint-ranked expert in the outside world, but it was a different story in the Holy World. Even getting to know a Saint here was incredibly difficult, let alone hiring the services of one.

…

Unfortunately, Cheng Xin was equally stunned by this situation. Particularly, when she heard Flint asking her about Shi Feng’s origins and how she became acquainted with him, she couldn’t help but want to dig a hole to hide in. As for Amber Soul, he wore a look of reverence as he sought guidance from Shi Feng.

Meanwhile, when Flint and the others learned about the whole situation from Cheng Xin, they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

They had hired a Saint with only a meager sum of 100 God Crystal Fragments…

If the Heavenly God Corporation’s people were to learn of this, they’d probably get a heart attack.

After learning about the situation from Cheng Xin, Flint hurriedly approached Shi Feng and respectfully said, “Thank you for your help, Guild Leader Black Flame. If not for you, the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate would have suffered a huge loss this time.”

At this time, Flint’s previous domineering and arrogant attitude was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he behaved as if he was conversing with a senior when talking to Shi Feng.

However, none of the surrounding experts found Flint’s sudden change in behavior surprising.

Saints were big shots no matter the place, and it was even more so inside the Holy World.

“You exaggerate, Commander Flint,” Shi Feng said, remaining calm even in the face of Flint’s respectful attitude. “It was a fair trade. Not to mention, even if I didn’t repel Hidden Wind, you could have still retreated with zero casualties easily.”

“No, no, no.” Flint shook his head and explained, “You might not know this, but the cargo the Heavenly God Corporation is transporting this time actually belongs to the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate. It is just that they stole it from us some time ago. So, it would have still been a loss for us, even if we did safely retreat.”

“It’s your cargo?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but turn to look at the large treasure chest on the carriage when he heard Flint’s words.

Items that required carriages to transport were typically non-bag space items. However, Shi Feng found it hard to imagine that any non-bag space item could get two powerful organizations to go all-out. The Heavenly God Corporation had even recruited the assistance of an expert like Hidden Wind.

“Yes.” Flint nodded. “This isn’t much of a secret, but a Replica Divine Artifact is inside that treasure chest. Or, more specifically, it is an item that is half a step from becoming a Divine Artifact.”

“A Half-step Divine Artifact?” Shi Feng was surprised. “Are you sure it’s fine to share this information?”

Divine Artifacts were priceless treasures in the Greater God’s Domain. Any Tier 6 player wielding a Divine Artifact would be strong enough to fight Ancient Gods. Meanwhile, many conglomerates and apex powers had ceased to exist on their journey to obtain a Divine Artifact.

A Half-step Divine Artifact might not be comparable to an actual Divine Artifact, but it was still the closest thing to a real one. It was enough to get the various apex powers to bet their continued existence over it. Yet, Flint had shared this information without hesitation.

“This isn’t a secret among the Holy World’s conglomerates. You’ll understand once you see it,” Flint said, chuckling as he led Shi Feng over to the treasure chest.

“Uncle Flint?” Cheng Xin couldn’t help but be surprised when she saw what Flint was trying to do. “Isn’t this inappropriate…”

The item inside the treasure chest might not be a secret to the Holy World’s conglomerates, but it was a massive secret to the average player. Normally, Flint wouldn’t even let her touch that item. Yet, now, he was eagerly inviting Shi Feng to research it…

“What are you getting anxious for? I’m just letting Brother Black Flame take a look. We’re not going to lose anything from it,” Flint said as he rolled his eyes at Cheng Xin.
