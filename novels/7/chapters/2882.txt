Chapter 2883 – Overnight Fortune

“One-to-one?” Han Yifeng frowned. “Brother Shi, isn’t your asking price a little too high?” At this time, Han Yifeng wasn’t the only one dissatisfied. Standing by the door, Zhuo Linqiu looked at Shi Feng with a hint of anger and ridicule in his eyes.

A one-to-one exchange ratio was something no organization operating in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone would accept.

Life Potions and Phantom Potions served as an organization’s foundation. Their stockpile was also something accumulated over many years. These potions weren’t items that one could obtain on a whim.

Yet, Shi Feng wanted to purchase these precious potions at a one-to-one exchange rate. Did he take the Five States Corporation for a fool?

The Five States Corporation had many sources for contribution points. Meanwhile, these sources only sought a two-to-one ratio. On what basis was Shi Feng asking for a one-to-one ratio?

“Young Master Han, don’t be in a hurry to refuse,” Shi Feng said, smiling as he looked at Han Yifeng’s cold expression. “A one-to-one ratio is a fair price.”

“A fair price?” Han Yifeng laughed. “May I know how you think it is fair, Brother Shi?”

“Because I can guarantee you a slot to enter the middle layer, Young Master Han!” Shi Feng said confidently. “Do you think this is a fair deal now?”

At Shi Feng’s words, Han Yifeng’s cold expression changed slightly. However, he quickly recollected himself and asked, “Those are some confident words, Brother Shi. If what you say is true, I can consider a one-to-one ratio. May I know what exactly you are counting on to help me?”

“Six hundred thousand contribution points! That, combined with the points you already have...while I don’t know if you can secure first place, getting within the top three shouldn’t be a problem, right?”

According to Muxin’s information, the top three rankers’ limit should be around one million contribution points. It would be difficult for them to acquire more than this because one could earn only so many contribution points through real-world resources. The only other way these top rankers could acquire more points would be to obtain many Seven Luminaries Crystals in God’s Domain. However, Seven Luminaries Crystals were incredibly precious in God’s Domain, and even the various superpowers barely had any.

Shi Feng estimated that acquiring 800,000 contribution points shouldn’t be a problem for the Five States Corporation. If the corporation included his 600,000 points, it could secure one of the top three spots with a 100% certainty. When Shi Feng finished speaking, Zhuo Linqiu couldn’t help staring at Shi Feng in disbelief, his eyes very nearly falling out of their sockets. Each of the Five States Corporation’s point sources could contribute only several tens of thousands of contribution points. After totaling the points from all sources, the corporation should gain around 600,000 contribution points. Not to mention, these sources would not necessarily sell all their points to the Five States Corporation. After all, the Upper Zone’s various organizations were purchasing contribution points at a high price. The Five States Corporation would be fortunate if it could acquire 400,000 contribution points in the end. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, if the corporation could gain an additional 600,000 contribution points now, it could secure one of the top three spots in the competition.

At this time, even Han Yifeng was visibly moved.

Six hundred thousand?! He has this much strength? In Han Yifeng’s opinion, taking out 200,000 contribution points would be plenty impressive already. After all, Seven Luminaries Crystals were not easy to acquire in God’s Domain. Shi Feng had even traded some with him already.

With 600,000 contribution points as his base, Shi Feng could even try to fight for one of the top three positions himself.

Shi Feng smiled when he saw Han Yifeng’s reaction. He then asked, “What do you think, Young Master Han?”

If Han Yifeng had one million contribution points as his base, all he needed to do next was acquire another 300,000 points or so to solidify his victory.

After pondering for a moment, Han Yifeng gritted his teeth and said, “That is indeed sufficient qualification. However, a one-to-one ratio is still too much. The Five States Corporation can’t take out so many potions in a short time.”

If converted to trade points, 600,000 contribution points would be worth 60 million trade points. And when converted to Life Potions, that would be equivalent to 12,000 Life Potions. This was by no means a trifling amount.

Shi Feng didn’t find Han Yifeng’s words surprising, either. Instead, he chuckled and said, “If that’s the case, how about this? I’ll only ask for 2,000 potions. I’ll exchange the remainder for a large mansion in the Upper Zone. What do you think? I recall that the Five States Corporation still has the authority to purchase another one.”

The base layer had only ten large mansions, and only eight had owners.

After some research, Shi Feng found that these large mansions were excellent accommodations. Not only could they house 40 people easily, but the strange energy in the air was also much denser in these large mansions. This denser energy would be of greater help in stabilizing Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose’s condition.

“Shi Feng, don’t go too far!” Zhuo Linqiu blurted angrily. “A one-to-one ratio is already an astronomical price! Yet, you’re asking for a large mansion that’s worth 140 million trade points? Do you take the Five States Corporation for a fool?”

The value of 10,000 Life Potions was equivalent to only 50 million trade points-a little more than one-third of a large mansion’s value. Shi Feng’s terms were no different from daylight robbery.

“My asking price is indeed a little excessive, but purchasing a large mansion doesn’t require you to spend contribution points. You only need to have accumulated 100 million contribution points. Meanwhile, not only will my Seven Luminaries Crystals provide you with contribution points, but they will also provide you with an ample amount of trade points. Exchanging a large mansion for these crystals wouldn’t be a loss for your corporation,” Shi Feng said. “Of course, if your corporation isn’t willing to do this transaction, I can find someone else to partner with. I believe the other people competing for the top three spots will be interested in my proposal.”

“You...”

Zhuo Linqiu was momentarily rendered speechless by Shi Feng. What Shi Feng said was indeed true. Contribution points were far more important than trade points, especially in the middle layer. Moreover, compared to contribution points, trade points were much easier to acquire.

“That’s enough, Old Zhuo!” Han Yifeng shot a glance at his butler, silencing him. He then returned his gaze to Shi Feng and said, “I agree to your offer. However, I will need time to acquire the large mansion. As for the potions, I can give you 1,000 bottles now. I will pay you the remaining 1,000 bottles and the large mansion within the next five days. What do you think?”

“Sure, I don’t have any problem with that.” Shi Feng nodded.

In Shi Feng’s opinion, the five days Han Yifeng stated were only a ploy. Han Yifeng wanted to purchase as many contribution points as possible from his other sources during these five days because once news of his acquisition of 600,000 contribution points spread, purchasing points would become much more difficult.

Afterward, Han Yifeng signed a contract with Shi Feng. According to the agreement, Shi Feng would transfer 60,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals to Han Yifeng through God’s Domain within half a day. At the same time, Han Yifeng would pay Shi Feng 1,500 bottles of Life Potion, 500 bottles of Phantom Potion, and one large mansion in return.

With the contract signed, Han Yifeng had Zhuo Lingiu pass 100 bottles of Life Potion to Shi Feng, with the rest to be delivered secretly to Shi Feng’s house.

After concluding the deal, Shi Feng left the Five States Corporation’s mansion with a crate of Life Potions. Meanwhile, after Shi Feng left, Zhuo Linqiu turned to Han Yifeng and warned quietly, “Young Master, your elders will criticize you if they find out you made such an unfavorable deal.”

“Criticize?” Sending Zhuo Linqiu a glance, Han Yifeng sneered, “So long as I get into the middle layer, do you think I’ll care about what they have to say?”

Everyone living in the base layer wished to enter the middle layer. The environment there far surpassed the base layer’s. The middle layer was also home to many mental strength masters. If he could befriend even one of these masters, his position within the Five States Corporation would become unshakable. At that time, would he have to care about the criticisms of his elders?

Gazing through the window at the distant middle layer with eyes burning with zeal, Han Yifeng said, “Head out and purchase contribution points from those organizations immediately! It doesn’t matter even if you have to offer them a 1.5-to-1 ratio!”

While Han Yifeng was secretly going around purchasing contribution points from various organizations, Shi Feng left the Upper Zone together with his crate of Life Potions.

Previously, despite receiving the Secret Pavilion’s and Netherworld Empire’s Guild Legacies, Zero Wing could afford to nurture only a small number of experts due to its limited resources.

However, now that Zero Wing had sufficient Life Potions, let alone Void Realm experts, the Guild could nurture even Domain Realm experts within a short time. This was something even the various superpowers couldn’t accomplish. After all, when nurturing new talents, the superpowers would provide only S-rank Nutrient Fluids at most, not something as precious as the Life Potion.

Meanwhile, when Shi Feng left the Upper Zone, Elder Qi and the others stalking him were stunned.

“Is this kid crazy?” a Henglian grandmaster asked when he saw Shi Feng entering the Mental Path. “He dares to leave the Upper Zone at this time?”

“Could it be that he didn’t notice us in the first place?” a lanky neutralizing grandmaster wondered

“There’s no way he hasn’t noticed us! I am certain on this point!” Elder Qi declared. Looking at Shi Feng’s distant figure coldly, he continued, “He’s looking down on us! Since he’s so arrogant, I’ll fulfill his wish! Everyone, get ready to take action outside! I want to see what ability this kid has!”

After saying so, Elder Qi promptly set off after Shi Feng. The other experts followed Elder Qi after briefly exchanging looks with one another.
