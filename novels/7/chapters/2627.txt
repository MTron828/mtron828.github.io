Chapter 2628 – Suppressing the Region Chiefs

Floating Light and the other members of Violet Light gaped in shock at the man standing atop the gigantic tree that was over a hundred meters tall.

“Just how high is his Strength?”

Those were two Level 120-plus Region Chiefs!

Either of those Region Chiefs could wipe out a 200-man, Tier 3 team of peak experts. Facing both Region Chiefs, even a team of such caliber was sure to get annihilated.

At this moment, however, Shi Feng had single-handedly suppressed and even repelled the two Region Chiefs. This was simply unbelievable.

“Is this why they didn’t retreat before?”

When Floating Light looked at the two Region Chiefs warily eyeing Shi Feng and thought back to the fact that Solitary Frost and Yan Xiaoqian had not moved even after Crimson Star gave the command to retreat, realization immediately dawned upon him. With such a monstrous team leader, there was indeed no need to retreat.

At this moment, Floating Light and the other retreating members of Violet Sword weren’t the only ones shocked by this situation. Crimson Star and Wildfighter, who were planning to hold the rear, as well as the frantically retreating members of Mythology, nearly had their eyes fall out of their sockets when this incredible scene played out before them.

“What did he do during this period?! How did he raise his Strength Attribute to such an extent?!” Sandstorm’s heart roiled with shock as he stared at Shi Feng.

During the fight at the Starlight Fortress, the Strength Shi Feng displayed was just close to reaching the Tier 4 standard. Moreover, he had relied on his fully unlocked Mana Body to do so.

However, just how long had passed since that fight?

In Sandstorm’s opinion, even if Shi Feng were incredibly lucky and obtained one or two pieces of Epic Equipment or gained some special encounters, he would be fortunate to match the Strength of Tier 4 Mythic monsters of the same level.

At this moment, however, Shi Feng’s Strength had actually grown to a level where he could overwhelm even the Region Chiefs of the ancient secret land.

However, before anyone could snap out of their stupor, the two Region Chiefs took action once more.

Firstly, the one-horned bear let loose an angry roar before slamming its front paws into the ground and shattering it. A twofold magic array then formed beneath Shi Feng’s feet, covering a 300-yard radius. Immediately afterward, thick, stone walls emerged, bordering the magic array and enveloping Shi Feng completely.

Tier 4 Spell, Earth’s Embrace!

As the one-horned bear was taking action, the six-eyed gorilla leaped into the sky above Shi Feng. The gorilla then summoned a crimson magic array with a 400-yard radius above the Swordsman.

Tier 4 Spell, Fire Dragon’s Descent!

In the next moment, a Fire Dragon larger than the six-eyed gorilla and made entirely out of flames emerged from the magic array. It spread its wings as it descended toward Shi Feng.

“Those two Region Chiefs actually know how to coordinate their Spells?!”

“Crap! That’s cheating! Shouldn’t Mythic Bosses be upright and use Spells in turns?!”

Everyone was stunned when they saw the two Region Chiefs’ coordinated assault.

Coordinating Skills and Spells was an extremely common thing for players. However, this was the first time they had seen monsters, particularly Tier 4 Bosses, do so.

Hence, everyone could not help despairing at the sight.

For Tier 3 players like themselves, just one Tier 4 Spell was already plenty difficult to deal with. If not handled appropriately, the result would very likely be an instant team-wipe. If they had to go up against two coordinated Tier 4 Spells, even Tier 3 MTs with their Lifesaving Skills activated would be killed instantly, unless they had Invulnerability Skills or Spells.

“It’s really over this time...” Crimson Star shook her head and sighed when she saw the two coordinated Tier 4 Spells.

If it were her, she could defend against one Tier 4 Spell using a Tier 3 Curse. However, even she would be powerless against two Tier 4 AOE Spells.

This didn’t mean that she had just one Tier 3 Curse in her arsenal of Spells; in fact, she had several. Currently, however, it was simply impossible for her—and most likely all magical-class players in God’s Domain—to double-cast two Tier 3 Curses.

“Hahaha! So what if you have amazing Strength?! Let’s see how you deal with this!”

Sandstorm burst out in laughter when he saw the two Region Chiefs’ coordinated assault on Shi Feng. The Swordsman’s Strength had indeed exceeded his expectations. In fact, he felt powerless when he witnessed Shi Feng’s fearsome display, and it was definitely impossible for them to exact revenge on him this time. However, being able to see the two Region Chiefs killing Shi Feng now wasn’t a bad outcome, either. After all, he knew that, because of the Demon God’s curse, the Swordsman would suffer triple the death penalty every time he died.

Although they were currently inside the ancient secret land where the death penalty was not as stringent as that in the outside world, a triple death penalty would still deal Shi Feng a heavy blow.

However, while everyone was looking at the gigantic Fire Dragon descending toward Shi Feng, the Swordsman surprisingly maintained his composure. Moreover, aside from Shi Feng, the spectating members of Zero Wing and Azure also remained indescribably calm in this situation.

“Finally, a chance!” Solitary Frost muttered as he watched Shi Feng closely, his eyes glittering with joy and excitement.

At this moment, aside from Solitary Frost, everyone else from the Azure Chamber of Commerce also had excited expressions.

“What’s wrong with them?” Floating Light was perplexed as he looked at Solitary Frost and the others.

Shi Feng was about to die here, yet Solitary Frost and the others were actually feeling excited about it?

“Come!”

While Floating Light was fraught with confusion, Shi Feng made his move.

In the next moment, Shi Feng sheathed Killing Ray and held the Abyssal Blade with both hands. He then jumped up from the treetop, propelling himself straight toward the descending Fire Dragon.

“He’s going to resist the attack head-on?” Floating Light could not help but disapprove of Shi Feng’s decision when he saw the Swordsman heading for the Fire Dragon. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A Tier 4 Spell could exhibit much greater power than a Mythic monster could with its physical body. This was especially true in the ancient secret land’s environment. Due to the abundant Mana here, Skills and Spells would exhibit much greater power than they normally could in the outside world. A Tier 4 Spell cast by a Mythic monster could instantly kill a Tier 3 MT who had a Lifesaving Skill activated.

Just as Shi Feng was about to collide with the Fire Dragon, he suddenly raised the Abyssal Blade overhead and swung it at the Fire Dragon.

“Shatter!”

The phantom of a gigantic greatsword suddenly appeared in the sky, creating a pitch-black wall there as it slashed toward the descending Fire Dragon.

First Sword, Lightshadow!

In the next moment, the pitch-black wall not only bisected the Fire Dragon but also continued extending toward the six-eyed gorilla hovering over a hundred yards above the Fire Dragon.

Upon seeing the approach of the pitch-black wall, the six-eyed gorilla panicked and instinctively tried to flee the area.

However, the pitch-black wall extended far too rapidly. Even though the six-eyed gorilla flew as fast as it could, it still failed to outmaneuver the pitch-black wall and ended up getting one of its arms cut off.

The six-eyed gorilla let loose an agonized shriek that echoed throughout the forest at the grievous injury.

Shortly afterward, an arm the size of a mountain fell into the forest below; a massive crater formed around the arm from the force of the impact. As for the six-eyed gorilla, it plummeted to the ground and tumbled helplessly for some distance. Due to the loss of its arm, the gorilla’s combat power also decreased significantly.
