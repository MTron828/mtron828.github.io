Chapter 2738 – Tripartite Partnership

“Complete Legacies for the various Tier 3 classes?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Illusory Words, Blue Gown, Unyielding Heart, and Mu Lingsha couldn’t help staring at Shi Feng in shock and disbelief.

This was especially true for Crimson Emperor’s talented rookie, Blue Gown. She found Shi Feng’s words fantastic.

In the current era of God’s Domain, the various kingdoms and empires already had a lockdown on Tier 3 Legacies. They treated Tier 3 Legacies as priceless treasures, and outsiders like players shouldn’t even think of referring to these Legacies. The only option players had for reaching Tier 3 was to search for the lost and fragmented Tier 3 Legacies hidden in Level 100-plus neutral maps. Yet, Shi Feng was telling them that they could get their hands on complete Tier 3 Legacies. How could she possibly believe this?

“Is what you say true, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Illusory Words had to ask. If the Secret Covenant Tower were only good for providing players with a faster leveling speed, it wouldn’t have too significant an impact on a superpower like Crimson Emperor. This was because tiers were everything in God’s Domain. Levels were only secondary.

However, the various superpowers were currently already having trouble with the Tier 3 Promotion Quest, let alone the elusive Tier 4 Promotion Quest. In fact, the difficulty of the Tier 3 Promotion was so high that the various superpowers were using the number of Tier 3 players they had as a comparison of strength.

If what Shi Feng said was true, and the Secret Covenant Tower contained complete Tier 3 Legacies, then this was an incredibly astonishing matter! If news of this matter leaked out, it would most likely send the entire God’s Domain into an uproar. After all, despite many players having reached Level 100 already, the players that had completed their Tier 3 promotions were still incredibly rare.

If one could get a complete Tier 3 Class Legacy, then completing the promotion quest for the specified class would become significantly easier. This was why NPCs had a much easier time reaching Tier 3 than players. If the difficulty of players’ Tier 3 Promotion Quests were reduced, the number of players successfully reaching Tier 3 would definitely skyrocket.

“You can personally verify this matter afterward,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “However, we must first decide whether we will cooperate or not.”

“Unyielding Soul will do it!” Unyielding Heart said without hesitation.

“Crimson Emperor naturally won’t miss this opportunity, either,” Illusory Words said, nodding. However, she then continued worriedly, “But with only our three Guilds, I’m afraid it will still be very difficult to seal off Sky Spring City, let alone concealing the Secret Covenant Tower’s true secret.” Cordoning off an NPC city was a challenging endeavor, as players could freely teleport into NPC cities. Players like themselves were powerless to prevent this. At most, they could keep players inside the city from leaving through the main gate and kill anyone that insisted on doing so. However, aside from the main gate, players had other means to exit an NPC city. One example would be a Teleportation Scroll like what Shi Feng used. The second problem was the matter of the Secret Covenant Tower containing complete Tier 3 Legacies. If Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor dispatched a lot of manpower to hunt for Legacies, the superpowers’ spies planted in their two Guilds would very quickly find out about the secret. At that time, cordoning off Sky Spring City would become even more of a challenge. In fact, it might even become impossible.

TIP

“You can rest assured on this point. Since you agree to cooperate, what follows next is simple,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. He then took out a pale gold token and explained, “This is Sky Spring City’s Guild Token. Zero Wing has already garrisoned Sky Spring City and gained a portion of the city’s management rights.”

“A portion of the city’s management rights?” Illusory Words’s eyes widened in shock as she looked at the Guild Token.

NPCs managed the NPC cities of the various kingdoms and empires. Hence, any Guild that successfully acquired even a small portion of an NPC city’s management rights would have a solid hold over the city. Other Guilds would have no way of wresting control over the city away from the ruling Guild.

In other words, Sky Spring City was already Zero Wing’s possession. “So, this is the privilege an Official Guild receives from garrisoning a city?” Unyielding Heart looked at the token in Shi Feng’s hand with envy. He had to admit that this privilege was truly amazing.

With this privilege, it was only a matter of time before Zero Wing surpassed its rival Guilds.

While a Guild City indeed possessed excellent development potential, NPC cities still dominated the current God’s Domain. Travel between NPC cities was incredibly convenient. Moreover, NPC cities all had Shops and Auction Houses that sold the essentials that the various powers and independent players couldn’t do without.

Thoroughly occupying an NPC city meant acquiring a goldmine with a steady incomeand no need to manage the city to obtain such significant income. This was something the various superpowers dreamed of having.

“That’s right. This is a privilege for Guilds officially recognized by the War God’s Temple,” Shi Feng said, not bothering to hide the truth. “With this token, I can enact a magic ban over Sky Spring City, preventing the use of any teleportation tools within it. This way, players can only walk if they wish to exit the city.

“In addition, for the sake of keeping the Secret Covenant Tower’s Tier 3 Legacies a secret, our three Guilds should rely on only our main force members to hunt for the Legacies. To begin with, it’s pointless to have a large number of players hunt for them. Ordinary Tier 3 teams can’t even survive on the lower floors, let alone search for the complete Legacies.

“Of course, it’s impossible to keep this secret forever. However, at this stage of the game, I wish to keep it hidden as long as possible.”

Illusory Words and Unyielding Heart nodded in agreement. They, too, felt that this was the only way they could go about doing things. So long as their Guilds acquired complete Tier 3 Legacies, they would already have a significant lead over the other superpowers. And the longer they could keep this secret hidden, the greater the benefits they could reap from it. “Let’s sign a contract, then,” Shi Feng said as he pulled out two Guild Contracts.

Initially, Shi Feng had wanted to invite the Secret Pavilion as well. However, the Secret Pavilion was a business-oriented Guild and always held itself detached from the struggles between Guilds. If the Secret Pavilion suddenly cordoned off an entire NPC city, it would create a huge commotion. In other words, it would seem quite abnormal.

Hence, Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor were much more suitable for this partnership. After all, the two Guilds were currently in a weakened position. Cordoning off an entire NPC city for the sake of acquiring more resources would be very normal for them. Even if the other superpowers found out that the two Guilds’ objective was the Secret Covenant Tower, the superpowers would, at most, think that the tower provided players with faster leveling.

As for permanently cordoning off Sky Spring City, Shi Feng had never intended to do that.

Zero Wing was in dire need of funds. Cordoning off Sky Spring City to allow the Guild to gain some advantages might be fine in the short term, but sealing off the city forever would be unprofitable. Fortunately, although it would be impossible to earn money off other players and powers while Sky Spring City was cordoned off, the income from Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor would still be considerable.

After all, both Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor had Guild Residences in Silverwing City. Compared to teleporting to Sky Spring City from the NPC cities of other kingdoms and empires, which would cost a minimum of four Gold, it only cost a little over one Gold per person to teleport from Silverwing City. Meanwhile, Zero Wing would get half of the profits generated by Silverwing City’s Teleportation Hall.

At that time, Zero Wing would earn a bunch in teleportation fees and entrance fees from Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor. After all, the two Guilds would be sending a lot of players to the Secret Covenant Tower to level up. This income would easily offset the loss Zero Wing suffered from barring NPCs from its Guild Cities.

Nevertheless, raking in money from the two Guilds wasn’t a long-term plan, as both Guilds had limited players and Coins. Afterward, Illusory Words and Unyielding Heart signed a Guild Contract with Shi Feng on behalf of their respective Guilds.

The terms of the contract were simple. Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor would help with cordoning off Sky Spring City from the outside. And aside from their main force members, the two Guilds’ other members were prohibited from visiting the Secret Covenant Tower’s 30th underground floor and beyond until the tower’s secret had been discovered.

Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor would also share the Magic Crystal cost of maintaining Sky Spring City’s magic ban.

This condition was incredibly disadvantageous for the two Guilds. They were basically contributing both manpower and resources. However, Unyielding Heart and Illusory Words did not voice any opinions about this condition. After all, Shi Feng had given their two Guilds an opportunity to surpass the other superpowers. Moreover, Zero Wing could still partner with other superpowers. On the other hand, their two Guilds had only Zero Wing.

After the three signed a contract with each other, Illusory Words and the others promptly returned to their respective Guilds to brief their Guild executives. At the same time, they also began making the necessary preparations to cordon off Sky Spring City and send personnel into the Secret Covenant Tower.

This matter was of utmost importance to their two Guilds, so they had no choice but to be incredibly careful in their actions. It would also take some time to fully cordon off Sky Spring City.

Likewise, Shi Feng had Fire Dance, Youlan, and the others prepare for the Secret Covenant Tower.

After seeing that there was nothing left for him to do, he chose to go offline to rest. Although staying logged into the game for more than 24 hours wouldn’t cause him any harm, he still had to do his daily exercises.

Zero Wing’s headquarters, top-floor lounge:

By the time Shi Feng returned to the real world, the sun outside was already illuminating the entire room. It was close to noon.

“Guild Leader, you’re finally out.” Liang Jing suddenly contacted Shi Feng. In a slightly joyful tone, she said, “Miss Muxin has been waiting in the reception room for quite some time now. She says she’s here to deliver all the things agreed upon previously. Moreover, she is also going to give Zero Wing a 300 million capital injection at no cost.”

Three hundred million Credits!

With this much money, Zero Wing could survive for quite some time even without selling Coins for Credits.

“She sure came quickly.” Shi Feng was startled by the speed.

He had anticipated having to wait for a few days. After all, the remuneration Frost Heaven promised Zero Wing was significant. The three Upper Zone reserve slots aside, just the 50 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid should take Frost Heaven quite some time to gather.

“Do you want to meet her now?” Liang Jing asked.

“Of course.” Shi Feng nodded. “Let me clean up first. I’ll head over as soon as I’m done.”
