Chapter 2838 Astonishing News

Chapter 2838 – Astonishing NewsWhen Fire Dance announced Zero Wing’s plan to sell one million entry slots for Zero Wing City, a commotion broke out throughout the eastern continent. Almost every power operating on the eastern continent promptly held a meeting among their executives to discuss the entry slots.

...

Orc Empire, Crimson Flame Fortress:

“How arrogant of Zero Wing. Aren’t they afraid of suffering a backlash for pulling such a stunt?” Snow Scar, who was now a Level 130, Tier 4 Berserker, sneered as he looked at the information displayed on the conference table. “They probably aren’t aware that Saint’s Hand has already established a city in the Black Hills, together with over a dozen superpowers.”

The Black Hills!

This was a Level 130 neutral map connected to the Valley of Death, a forbidden land. Meanwhile, the Valley of Death was also the map that current players had the best chances of exploring successfully. Although the forbidden land was dangerous, according to the reports of the Tier 4 experts who had explored it already, the number of Tier 4 Legacy Lands appearing inside far exceeded that of other places. There were also plenty of ancient ruins hidden in the map, which were of significant help with getting promoted to Tier 4. In fact, even Tier 4 players could reap a lot of benefits from these ancient ruins.

In response to Snow Scar’s words, Jing Yang, who was now a Level 131, Tier 4 Great Wizard, turned to the woman exuding a heroic and charming aura, seated at the table’s seat of honor. In a respectful tone, he said, “Vice Guild Leader, Saint’s Hand has sent us an invitation as well. They say they will offer us 10% of their new city’s shares once it is constructed. However, we will need to garrison the city with one Tier 4 player and 20,000 Tier 3 players in return.”

“How calculative of Saint’s Hand. They must be aiming to have us help them deal with Zero Wing in the Orc Empire,” a Level 128, Tier 4 female Assassin said, smirking. “However, if they want to use us as pawns, don’t you think that the price they’re offering is too low?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Snow Scar also nodded in agreement with the female Assassin.

The Blackwater Guild was no longer the same as it was before. Under Xuanwu Chisa’s lead, the Guild had grown to a point where it could rival even Super Guilds. Moreover, unknown to the public, the Guild even had six Tier 4 experts already.

“Jing Yang, tell Saint’s Hand that they need to show more sincerity if they want to partner with us. We want at least 30% of the city’s shares,” Xuanwu Chisa said, opening her eyes. “Also, notify Zero Wing of Saint’s Hand’s actions. Tell them that Blackwater is willing to partner with Zero Wing to go up against Saint’s Hand’s alliance. However, in return, they must allow all of Blackwater’s elite members into Zero Wing City.”

“Vice Guild Leader, you know how Zero Wing operates. There’s no way they will agree to such a condition,” Jing Yang argued, feeling a headache incoming.

He had negotiated with Zero Wing for partnership many times in the past, yet he had faced rejection every time. Now that Zero Wing had the potential to rival the Five Great Super Guilds, it had even less need to heed Blackwater’s demands.

“It doesn’t matter if they don’t accept it now,” Xuanwu Chisa said nonchalantly. “Once Saint’s Hand opens their city and that side arrives, Zero Wing will have no choice but to agree to our demands.”

“I understand.” Jing Yang nodded.

The current Zero Wing indeed had the qualifications to be arrogant. However, once Saint’s Hand opened its city in the Black Hills, the situation would quickly reverse. After all, mainstream players were currently only at Level 120. Although the Arctic Canyon was also an excellent location, it simply wasn’t a place mainstream players could visit. At most, they could only make use of Zero Wing City’s incredible Mana environment.

Not to mention, Saint’s Hand’s alliance consisted of more than a dozen superpowers. With the manpower and resources available to them, the alliance would soon become an existence that even the Five Great Super Guilds had to be wary of.

At that time, Zero Wing’s advantage in Tier 4 players would also disappear.

However, Saint’s Hand’s alliance still wasn’t the biggest problem Zero Wing would have to face but the world-shattering war looming over the main continent. A Guild like Zero Wing, which had established a base in a Level 140 neutral map, would definitely head the list of cannon fodder for this war.

Currently, though, very few people in God’s Domain actually knew of this upcoming war. The only reason Blackwater knew about it was Xuanwu Chisa’s special identity.

Just when Blackwater was about to notify Zero Wing of Saint’s Hand’s actions, Saint’s Hand actually announced its astonishing plan to the entire eastern continent.

Moreover, Saint’s Hand even declared that it would open its city to everyone and charge a cheap entrance fee of only one Magic Crystal or 50 Silver Coins.

As soon as this news came out, many of the first-rate powers considering partnering with Zero Wing promptly changed their minds.

After all, although Zero Wing City possessed an excellent environment, the entrance fee it charged was simply beyond the various first-rate powers’ means. Not to mention, the city’s entry slots would be auctioned. In other words, the entry slots wouldn’t cost just ten Magic Crystals. By the end of the auction, each slot might actually go for 15 or even 20 Magic Crystals.

Moreover, this was only the price to enter the city. Once inside the city, they were bound to incur all sorts of other expenditures as well. Rather than spending all those Magic Crystals, it would be much better to head to Saint’s Hand’s city and explore the Valley of Death for ancient ruins and Tier 4 Legacy Lands. Not only could they save up on a lot of Magic Crystals by doing so, but their potential income was also higher.

...

Sky Spring City, Zero Wing’s Residence:

“Guild Leader, 90% of the first-rate powers seeking to partner with us and 80% of the adventurer teams seeking to join us changed their minds after Saint’s Hand’s announcement,” Fire Dance said, a hint of disbelief in her eyes as she read the report she just received. “There won’t be any competition for the entry slots. In fact, the one million slots we’re offering exceed the remaining Guilds’ demand.”

“It doesn’t matter. Let Saint’s Hand do whatever it wants. Our plan will remain the same. We will still sell one million entry slots during the auction,” Shi Feng said, chuckling as he looked at the statistical report. “When the time comes, just sell as many slots as possible. To begin with, we’re not doing this to earn Magic Crystals. We’re just trying to keep Zero Wing City operational.”

“You might be right, but if we have enough Magic Crystals, we could construct another Mobile Fortress, right?” Fire Dance said regretfully.

The Magic Crystals Zero Wing earned from its members visiting Zero Wing City were already more than enough to keep the city functioning normally. The only problems remaining were the recruitment and maintenance of the city’s NPC soldiers.

However, resolving these issues wasn’t a big deal for the present Zero Wing. This was because many Guild members were willing to develop themselves in Zero Wing City. There were also more than 20,000 Tier 3 experts from Heaven’s Blade and Asura. In total, Zero Wing City already had an astonishing 50,000 Tier 3 players operating in it.

At this point, all they needed to do was wait until the Guild accumulated enough Tier 3 members to ensure Zero Wing City’s security. Once the city’s security was no longer a concern, they could open up the city to NPCs and begin recruiting NPC soldiers in large numbers.

However, the Mobile Fortress’s power had made a deep impression on Fire Dance. She believed it would be wonderful if Zero Wing could gain another Mobile Fortress.

“Let’s not talk about getting another Mobile Fortress,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “What we can do is further increase the number of Tier 4 players we have to improve the Guild’s strength.”

“Further increase?” Fire Dance parroted, confused by Shi Feng’s words. “Is that even doable?”

Producing Tier 4 players was easier said than done. Finding Tier 4 Legacy Lands was one thing; mastering a Tier 4 Skill or Spell within the allotted time was another thing altogether. The help Zero Wing City’s environment provided for this aspect could already be regarded as the best available in God’s Domain. She found it hard to imagine other ways to help Zero Wing produce even more Tier 4 players.

“Of course.” Smiling, Shi Feng said, “Contact Summer and the others and have them gather in Zero Wing City’s City Lord’s Mansion.”

If it were before he had visited the ancient God’s Domain, he would indeed have no way of accomplishing such a feat. However, after his trip to the ancient era, he did.

And that was by using the Ancient Beast Sculpture!
