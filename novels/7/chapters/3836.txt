Chapter 911 – Starlight’s Hegemon

“Guild Leader Shi?”

“Since when were we Gold Guests?”

Shi Feng’s words confused Xia Qingying and Endless Scars. They wondered if he had indeed lost his mind. After all, even if he claimed to be a Gold Guest, his lie would quickly be exposed with a simple check unless he could back his words with evidence.

Besides Xia Qingying and Endless Scars, the female head attendant named Shuoyun was also stunned by this situation.

Since when did Shi Feng’s group become Gold Guests?

“Gold Guests?” Xiao Quan laughed at Shi Feng’s words. “Did you get promoted without my knowing, Guild Leader Black Flame? Or are you claiming that Zero Wing can already rival pseudo-apex powers? How about you show me your invitation to let me broaden my horizons?”

Xia Qingying gnashed her teeth at Xiao Quan’s words.

Originally, they still had a slim chance of escaping this mess if Crocodile Fang chose not to pry into Shi Feng’s claim. After all, of those present, only she and Xiao Quan knew about Zero Wing’s actual circumstances. But now…

“Broaden your horizons? Sure, I’ll grant you your wish!” Shi Feng said calmly as he pulled out the gold invitation Frey had sent him.

Upon seeing the invitation made of pure gold, Xia Qingying and Xiao Quan were dumbfounded.

“Impossible! It must be a fake!” Xiao Quan instinctively shouted when he saw Shi Feng’s gold invitation.

To receive a gold invitation from Desolate Star City, one had to be at least the representative of a pseudo-apex power or an individual of equivalent status. How could Zero Wing’s Guild Leader possibly receive a gold invitation?

“This is an authentic gold invitation,” Shuoyun said after inspecting Shi Feng’s invitation. “But this isn’t an invitation handed out by Desolate Star City.”

“It’s real but not distributed by Desolate Star City?” Xia Qingying smiled wryly when she heard Shuoyun’s analysis, the glimmer of hope in her heart vanishing.

However, despite her despair, Xia Qingying wasn’t particularly surprised by this outcome. Although Zero Wing had recruited plenty of fourth-floor experts in the Eternal Realm recently and even absorbed some of the Green God Corporation’s geniuses, it still wasn’t anywhere near strong enough to be considered a pseudo-apex power. Naturally, it wouldn’t receive a direct invitation from Desolate Star City.

Endless Scars also looked at Shi Feng, a little speechless. She hadn’t expected Shi Feng to pull such a stunt. Now, their entire group had become a complete joke.

“Big Sis Xia, could Guild Leader Shi have stolen this golden invitation from somewhere?” Drifting Bean whispered to Xia Qingying worriedly.

Desolate Star City’s golden invitations held great significance. It might be fine if Shi Feng had received the golden invitation from someone affiliated with Desolate Star City, but it would be a big problem if he had stolen someone else’s.

“I…don’t know…” Xia Qingying shook her head. She was similarly doubtful about Shi Feng’s gold invitation, but she didn’t find it appropriate to ask him about it in this situation.

“Pretty lady, you have a very interesting friend! It’s not even a gold invitation from Desolate Star City, yet he dares to flaunt it before me!” Crocodile Fang laughed as he took in Xia Qingying’s ugly complexion. “But don’t you worry. While I might not know who gave your friend a gold invitation, he did give me a good laugh. So long as you and that little beauty beside you accompany us for a few drinks, I’ll forget about today’s offense.”

As soon as Crocodile Fang finished speaking, the six three-star grandmasters and one elderly great grandmaster behind him walked toward Xia Qingying and Drifting Bean.

Crocodile Fang was painfully aware that he had no hope of succeeding his father as Angel’s Retribution’s Guild Leader if he relied on his own strength. However, he knew a secret that others did not know—Xiao Quan was in contact with Demon’s Gate’s core executives. If he could gain the favor of one of Demon’s Gate’s core executives through Xiao Quan, he might have a chance at competing for the position of Angel’s Retribution’s Guild Leader.

Now that there was such an excellent opportunity to get on Xiao Quan’s good side, Crocodile Fang naturally couldn’t miss it. Although Xia Qingying’s group possessed an authentic gold invitation, he couldn’t care less about offending the group since it wasn’t a direct invitation from Desolate Star City. After everything he said before, if he failed to get revenge for Xiao Quan now, he could forget about getting the other party to introduce him to Demon’s Gate’s core executives.

“Mr. Fang! You are in Desolate Star City! Please abide by the city’s rules!” Shuoyun said, interposing herself between Xia Qingying’s group and Crocodile Fang’s bodyguards. “These people are similarly Desolate Star City’s distinguished guests. Although their gold invitation doesn’t come directly from Desolate Star City, it is still a gold invitation to Desolate Star City. Anyone who can send a gold invitation on Desolate Star City’s behalf must be one of the city’s management powers. If that great personage learns of your actions, you will have difficulty explaining yourself.”

“Why would I have a hard time explaining myself? Since you’re going to such lengths to protect them, I’ll let you in on a secret. Angel’s Retribution was invited by the Great Miss Lunar River this time to discuss an alliance with King’s Paradise. So, even if that gold invitation comes from one of Desolate Star City’s management powers, I don’t care. You can have them come to me. I’d like to see what they’d dare to say,” Crocodile Fang stated confidently.

King’s Paradise? Isn’t that one of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers that was second only to apex powers over half a century ago? When Xia Qingying heard Crocodile Fang’s words, her complexion turned even gloomier. She had never expected Desolate Star City to be backed by King’s Paradise, the power that nearly unified the Angel Sanctuary long ago. Moreover, it would seem that Angel’s Retribution and King’s Paradise intended to enter an alliance. This news could not be any worse for her group.

Although Shi Feng’s gold invitation was authentic, it only came from a power under Desolate Star City’s management. Like Star Lake City, Desolate Star City also had many powers assisting its City Lord with the city’s management. However, while these powers might wield significant authority in the city, it was far from that of the City Lord’s. Having a management power challenge Angel’s Retribution was nothing but a joke.

“This…” Crocodile Fang’s words gave Shuoyun pause. A guest was only a guest. She would be doomed if she ruined the alliance between King’s Paradise and Angel’s Retribution. “I will have to report this to Miss River. Only she can decide on this matter.”

“Sure. Feel free to call her if you don’t mind the trouble,” Crocodile Fang said nonchalantly. He only feared one power and one person across the Starlight Continent.

The power in question was King’s Paradise. Although King’s Paradise had to go into seclusion after challenging an apex power and failing, many years had passed since the event. By now, even if it hadn’t recovered to its peak, it should at least be comparable to the current Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers.

As for the person he feared, it was Frey, the Fourth Princess of the Galaxy Conglomerate. In addition to being the Third Vice Guild Leader of the Red Dragon Nation, Frey was also a popular figure in the Eternal Realm, and many pseudo-apex powers sought to partner with her.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, who gave you this invitation?” While Shuoyun was making a call with her quantum watch, Xia Qingying asked about the origins of Shi Feng’s invitation. It might still be fine if the invitation came from one of Desolate Star City’s management powers, but it would be terrible otherwise.

“Frey,” Shi Feng answered honestly.
