Chapter 629 – Fragmented Divine Artifact Chaos Windblade

?

When the Gorgon Queen died, Eternal Energy began to condense in the desolate battlefield, and the density of Eternal Energy within a several thousand-yard radius began to rise rapidly.

“We won! We won!!!”

“A Level 180, Tier 6 Primordial Godkin! I can’t believe we defeated such a legendary World Boss!”

“Instructor Black Flame’s last three strikes were amazing! They could already compete with the Boss’s Chaos Spear!”

Azure Shadow and the other surviving Night Watch battle group members collapsed in exhaustion when the raid ended, their HP bars nearly depleted. Even so, they wore ecstatic expressions on their faces.

Normally, it would take at least a 100-man team of Tier 6 experts to even have a chance at successfully raiding a Tier 6 Primordial Godkin. Not to mention, the Primordial Godkin in question was even a Gorgon Queen, a creature who shared the same race as one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboo Bosses[1].

Yet, now, with just a team of thirty or so players and more than half of those players being at Tier 5 only, they had successfully raided a Tier 6 Primordial Godkin. Their success could absolutely be considered a miracle.

If they were to publicize this battle record, it would shake the entire Greater God’s Domain.

Of course, Azure Shadow and the others also understood that their success was mainly attributed to the Ancient God summoned by Shi Feng. If not for the Ancient God heavily injuring the Gorgon Queen, they stood no chance against the Primordial Godkin. This point could be seen from how they fared against the Gorgon Queen the instant she recovered from her injuries.

With just one move, the Gorgon Queen had obliterated half of their team. Even the surviving Tier 6 players had suffered a heavy mental blow, their mental states becoming incredibly lethargic. If they weren’t actively keeping themselves awake right now, they would have promptly lost consciousness and been forcibly logged out of the game.

Meanwhile, following the Gorgon Queen’s death, a purple-gold glow enveloped every surviving member of the team. The EXP the Tier 6 Primordial Godkin awarded was so abundant that everyone leveled up at least four times. As for Shi Feng, the person who dealt the killing blow, his level shot to 177, instantly catching up to Azure Shadow and the others.

Thank goodness I gambled correctly.

Shi Feng sighed deeply in relief as he looked at the Gorgon Queen’s corpse. If not for the Eternal God Crystal increasing his Concentration to the Tier 6 Peak standard, he could have never executed Dark Moon three times consecutively.

Even so, after using Dark Moon three times in quick succession, his mental state had become incredibly frail, and his body’s movements felt incredibly heavy. He would probably fall asleep on the spot if he dropped his guard for even a moment.

At the same time as Shi Feng sighed in relief, several items overflowing with Eternal Energy formed in the underground plaza. The items numbered only six, which was a very low number for a Tier 6 World Boss. However, shock instantly filled everyone’s eyes when they saw the six items. Even Shi Feng was not an exception.

“Are you kidding me?!”

“What dense Eternal Energy! Not even the Fragmented Divine Artifacts I’ve seen can hold a candle to these items! Could there be an intact Divine Artifact among these items?”

“The Eternal Energy they’re radiating is nearly at a liquid state. Even if there isn’t an intact Divine Artifact, there should still be multiple Fragmented Divine Artifacts.”

“Multiple Fragmented Divine Artifacts!! The last I recall, even when the various pseudo-apex powers manage to kill Tier 6 Gods, the most they’ll get is one Fragmented Divine Artifact! If those pseudo-apex powers learn of this, they’ll probably die from envy!”

Astonishment and admiration filled Azure Shadow and the others as they looked at the six glowing items floating before them.

Although they didn’t know what exactly the six items were, it was easy to tell these items were extraordinary going by the Eternal Energy gathered around them. It wouldn’t be strange if half of these items were Fragmented Divine Artifacts.

Be it weapons or equipment, the various powers would regard every Fragmented Divine Artifact as one of their most prized possessions. They were incredibly rare, and many upper-ranking hegemonic powers and conglomerates wouldn’t even necessarily own one. However, so long as an upper-ranking hegemonic power possessed a Fragmented Divine Artifact, they would immediately be ranked among the top of upper-ranking hegemonic powers. Or more specifically, owning a Fragmented Divine Artifact was a criterion for being ranked as such, which was a testament to the rarity and might of Fragmented Divine Artifacts.

Is this because of the exploration bonus? Shi Feng couldn’t help but doubt his eyes when he finished collecting the six items.

He had killed many Tier 6 Gods in his previous life, some of which were even above Level 200. Meanwhile, it should be known that there was a qualitative difference between monsters that had reached Level 200 and monsters below Level 200.

Firstly, once monsters reached Level 200, regardless of their tier, they could form a miniature world within them. Meanwhile, the formation of this miniature world would provide monsters with a qualitative improvement in Physique, Mana, and physical toughness. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Secondly, once monsters reached Level 200, their Magic Resistance would no longer be zero. Instead, all monsters at Level 200 and above would have a certain degree of Magic Resistance, which would increase their resistance toward players’ Skills and Spells.

Because of these two factors, Level 200 was a huge turning point for monsters in the Greater God’s Domain.

Of course, Level 200 was also a huge turning point for players. Upon reaching Level 200, players would no longer gain EXP from monsters below Level 200. They must kill Level 200 monsters or above if they wished to continue leveling up. Meanwhile, the minimum tier for monsters at Level 200 or beyond was Tier 5.

Moreover, after reaching Level 200, the amount of EXP players needed to level up would skyrocket. Players fighting in teams would also no longer evenly share the EXP they earned from monsters. Instead, EXP would be distributed based on individual contributions.

These factors made it much more difficult for ordinary players to level up after reaching Level 200. As a result, many players lacking strength would find themselves hovering at Level 200 for the rest of their careers in God’s Domain.

Anyway, due to the significant changes monsters would undergo at Level 200, the loot they dropped would also become significantly better. Yet, despite being a Level 180 monster, the Gorgon Queen’s loot was superior to even the loot of Level 200-plus, Tier 6 Gods.

Contrary to what Azure Shadow and the others surmised, only one of the six items was a Fragmented Divine Artifact. Even so, in terms of overall value, the Gorgon Queen’s loot vastly exceeded the estimates of Azure Shadow and the others.

Forged by the Primordial Chaos. The Chaos Windblade’s core is currently damaged, and it needs to absorb nine World Hearts and one Chaos Core to fully recover.

Shi Feng was rendered speechless as he looked at the Chaos Windblade. In reality, this wasn’t the first time he had heard of the Chaos Windblade’s name. This was because it was one of the more famous Fragmented Divine Weapons in the Holy Race players’ possession in his previous life. It was even ranked 23rd on the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Cross-World Fragmented Divine Artifact Ranking List. He never thought the weapon would end up in his hands in this life.

However, compared to the Chaos Windblade, what caught Shi Feng’s attention even more was the fist-sized void fragment in his hand. When he looked at this fragment, his heart palpitated uncontrollably.

A Medium World Fragment!

TL Notes:

[1]Taboo Bosses:

This is a new term introduced by the author. I guess the author finally realized how many things “Taboo” is referencing and decided to add further specifications.

[2]Level 200 was also a huge turning point for players:

I translated this section as is, and I don’t know if the “turning point” for players includes the “internal” miniature world that monsters get when reaching Level 200. The author also never specifically mentioned it and simply wrote that Level 200 was similarly a turning point for players.

However, personally, seeing as weaker players could have their progression permanently halted at Level 200, I’m of the opinion that players don’t get such a benefit, and the Level 200 turning point is mostly negative for players.
