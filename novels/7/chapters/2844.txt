Chapter 2845 – Soon-to-Break Seal

Haitian City Upper Zone, Northern Mountain Villa Community:

Shi Feng couldn’t help doubting his eyes as he stared at the three-story mansion before him.

“You’ve been living in this place all this time?” Shi Feng asked as he looked at Ji Luorong strangely.

The mansion before him not only looked luxurious but also occupied an area as large as two basketball courts; it was even larger than the Boulder Corporation’s mansion in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone, which had cost 30 million trade points to exchange.

Meanwhile, Ji Luorong lacked both influence and authority in the Upper Zone. In fact, she was even living in the Upper Zone by herself. Apart from her family’s corporation operating in the outside world, she did not possess any backers or background whatsoever. Hence, Shi Feng found it truly hard to believe that she had managed to purchase such a large mansion.

Even Muxin was a little surprised by this situation. After all, the base layer’s mansions couldn’t be bought by just anyone with sufficient points. Normally, one also needed to have Grade 1 authority or above. However, from the information she obtained on Ji Luorong’s background, the latter had only Grade 2 authority.

“This is the mansion my maternal grandfather left behind,” Ji Luorong said, nodding. “Because of my family’s decline, we had no choice but to live in the outside world. However, because my mental strength showed promise, my family decided to make use of the reserve slot my maternal grandfather left behind and let me live in the Upper Zone.”

Realization immediately dawned upon Shi Feng at Ji Luorong’s explanation.

This also explained why Phoenix Rain had been living in the outside world despite her family having such a large mansion in the Upper Zone.

The Upper Zone had existed for a long time already. During this period, there had indeed been many families that had fallen into obscurity and were forced to leave the Upper Zone. After all, the strong preyed upon the weak in the Upper Zone. Without a reserve slot or sufficient talent in the mental strength department, one would not qualify for residency in the Upper Zone at all.

Through this revelation, Shi Feng also realized that the Ji family was indeed extraordinary. Although it was in decline now, the fact that it had managed to acquire such an extravagant mansion in the Upper Zone proved that it had once been a powerful force there.

This also explained how Phoenix Rain managed to rely on her own strength to become one of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion’s Pavilion Masters.

As Ji Luorong talked about her family circumstances, the group arrived inside the mansion.

Upon entering the mansion, Shi Feng had to admit that it was indeed much better than his housing unit. Not only was the place much more spacious, but it also provided much greater help toward the improvement of one’s mental strength.

After entering the mansion, Shi Feng turned the conversation to Ji Luorong’s current circumstances and Phoenix Rain’s brief reappearance in God’s Domain after her disappearance.

Upon hearing news of her older sister, Ji Luorong breathed out a small sigh of relief.

She had been incredibly worried when she found out that her older sister had disappeared. When she heard that her older sister had been brought to Haitian City’s Upper Zone, she had repeatedly searched the base layer for clues of her older sister. Despite her efforts, she had come up empty.

The only possibility she could think of was that her older sister had been transferred to the middle layer. Hence, she had been anxiously trying to enter the middle layer to verify her older sister’s condition.

Hearing that her older sister had once appeared in God’s Domain after her disappearance and even expressed that she was safe had lifted the stone weighing on her heart. Now, she could finally relax a little bit.

“By the way, why did Lu Tiandi come to find you? Do you have any grudges with him?” Shi Feng asked curiously as he looked at Ji Luorong.

His main goal in coming to Haitian City’s Upper Zone was to check Ji Luorong’s situation. After all, he had promised Phoenix Rain to take care of her little sister.

Meanwhile, Lu Tiandi wasn’t a kind person. Catching his attention was akin to catching the attention of a fox. One was bound to meet with misfortune.

“I don’t have any grudges with him. In fact, today is only our second meeting,” Ji Luorong sighed. “As for why he is approaching me, it is because he wants Eternal Glory, the adventurer team I established, to join his adventurer team, Tremorous Clown.”

“He wants to annex your adventurer team?” Shi Feng was surprised by this answer.

Tremorous Clown was an extraordinary dark adventurer team. According to his past knowledge, the team had been active on the western continent and possessed powerful members. At its peak, the team had even had three Tier 6s and nine Tier 5s. Even the various superpowers dared not casually offend the adventurer team.

Back then, many experts operating on the dark side of God’s Domain had sought to join Tremorous Clown. However, only a small minority had succeeded because Tremorous Clown’s entry requirement was Tier 4. Normally, only peak experts who had reached Tier 4 could join the team.

Shi Feng also knew a little about Ji Luorong’s adventurer team since Ji Luorong had also been relatively famous in the past. Although not on the level of the Demon Queen Phoenix Rain, Ji Luorong had still been a bona fide Tier 5 apex expert, only half a step from reaching Tier 6. Eternal Glory had also been a famous top adventurer team. At its peak, the team had had not only a Tier 6 God-ranked expert but also three Tier 5 experts.

However, Eternal Glory was currently merely a well-known adventurer team. Its overall strength was still incredibly weak. This included Ji Luorong, the adventurer team’s commander. Shi Feng doubted that the team even had a single Tier 4 player in its ranks right now. Hence, he found it inconceivable that Lu Tiandi wished to annex Eternal Glory.

Of course, Shi Feng wasn’t looking down on Ji Luorong and her companions. The present Tremorous Clown was far stronger than Eternal Glory. Tremorous Clown probably rivaled the average superpower in the number of its peak combatants. Now that Lu Tiandi had acquired Starlink as well, the overall strength of the forces under his command should be at an astonishing level.

“My team is indeed incapable of catching Lu Tiandi’s attention. The only reason I can think of for his efforts to annex us is the special Legacy we obtained,” Ji Luorong said after giving the matter some thought. “Some time ago, we visited a very special secret land and found a massive World Passage sealed there. We even came across a person who might be a Tier 6 God.

“According to that person, the seal on the World Passage would soon break, and the War of Worlds would soon begin. Our team received a special Legacy from that person. Recorded inside the Legacy was a sealing magic array. If we sacrifice EXP to the magic array, we can isolate a specific area from the rest of the world for a long period. It can be considered a means to resist the War of Worlds.

“However, at that time, other players aside from our team entered that place as well. In hindsight, those people might have been Tremorous Clown’s members.”

Ji Luorong’s words shocked Shi Feng.

This was because he had never heard of a War of Worlds happening at this stage of the game in his previous life. However, he also doubted that Ji Luorong was lying. After all, he had visited the ancient God’s Domain. He wouldn’t find it strange if there were other timelines of God’s Domain.

This was especially true after seeing Hundred Ghosts’s members. Those people clearly didn’t come from the ancient God’s Domain but most likely were from another Interstellar Continent. This so-called War of Worlds was probably a great war between Earth’s players and the said Interstellar Continent’s players.

If this was true, it would be a disaster for Earth’s God’s Domain. After all, in terms of resources and experts, the Interstellar Continent’s God’s Domain was far superior to Earth’s God’s Domain.

If the two sides were to wage war against each other, it wouldn’t take a genius to imagine that Earth’s side would suffer a catastrophic defeat, with many superpowers getting annihilated.

Even the present Zero Wing would have a difficult time facing the Interstellar Continent’s offensive.

This explained why Lu Tiandi wanted Ji Luorong’s adventurer team to join Tremorous Clown. After all, the ability to isolate an area from the outside world would be of significant help to a Guild in the upcoming war.

When Muxin heard Ji Luorong’s words, her complexion darkened.

Muxin did not doubt that the War of Worlds would happen. This was because of information Frost Heaven obtained from investigating Hundred Ghosts. Previously, she had still been questioning the validity of this information. However, after listening to Ji Luorong’s tale, everything made sense. Yet, she couldn’t bring herself to be happy about this discovery.

Frost Heaven had gone to great lengths to secure one of the reserve seats for God’s Domain’s Twelve Great Guilds. Yet, just when the Guild was about to usher in an era of rapid development, the War of Worlds was about to begin. This was an absolute nightmare for Frost Heaven.

However, Muxin felt a little fortunate. If she hadn’t chosen to accompany Shi Feng to Haitian City’s Upper Zone, she would’ve most likely remained ignorant about this upcoming, world-shaking change.

If Frost Heaven did not prepare for the War of Worlds, it wouldn’t be strange if the Guild got annihilated. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

While Muxin was pondering Frost Heaven’s future, Shi Feng looked at Ji Luorong and said earnestly, “Luorong, now that Lu Tiandi has set his sights on you and you have even rejected his offer, with his personality, I’m afraid it won’t be long before he takes action against your team. It is no longer suitable for you to remain in Haitian City’s Upper Zone. It will be safer if you move to another Upper Zone. I have a housing unit in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone. Although it isn’t comparable to this mansion, you can still conduct daily exercises there. Would you like to move there?”

Shi Feng knew Lu Tiandi’s personality better than anyone. Lu Tiandi would eliminate anyone he deemed his enemy. With the Starline Corporation’s present influence over Haitian City’s Upper Zone, Ji Luorong definitely couldn’t live there in peace. Only by leaving Haitian City’s Upper Zone would Ji Luorong escape Lu Tiandi’s clutches.

“Go to Yuantian City’s Upper Zone?”

Inevitably, Ji Luorong hesitated. However, she also knew that Shi Feng was right; living in Haitian City’s Upper Zone would no longer be safe.

“Miss Ji, if you find it inconvenient to live with Guild Leader Shi Feng, you are welcome to live with me. Although the Boulder Corporation isn’t as powerful as the Starline Corporation, we have established a solid foundation in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone,” Muxin invited.

“Miss Muxin, you misunderstand. I don’t find it inconvenient. I am already very satisfied to be able to live in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone,” Ji Luorong said, shaking her head. “I am just worried about my friends. They don’t live in the Upper Zone. If Lu Tiandi targets them, I’m afraid they won’t be able to hide from him for very long.”

If it were before, when God’s Domain still didn’t hold such great importance to the various corporations, she wouldn’t have to worry about the Starline Corporation secretly taking action against her companions. However, the situation was different now. Because of the extreme importance the Green God Company placed on God’s Domain, the various major corporations now prioritized the game. It wouldn’t be strange if they took action against individuals in the real world.

In response to Ji Luorong’s worries, Shi Feng chuckled and said, “That is simple. Just have your friends head to Zero Wing’s headquarters. I’ll have everything arranged for their stay.”

He very much welcomed alliances with experts. Meanwhile, Eternal Glory had plenty of experts in its ranks. Once these players grew up, they would become formidable allies. Sheltering Eternal Glory’s members now would only benefit Zero Wing.

Moreover, Lei Bao was currently at the half-step Henglian grandmaster standard already. There was also Fire Dance, who was not much inferior to Lei Bao. Combined with the various top-level security measures set up in Zero Wing’s headquarters, even a Henglian grandmaster would have difficulty making trouble there.

After hearing Shi Feng’s words, Ji Luorong couldn’t help rejoicing. Excitedly, she said, “Thank you, Guild Leader Shi Feng. I assure you that they will listen to all of Zero Wing’s arrangements during their stay.”

The fact that her adventurer team’s members could stay in Zero Wing’s headquarters was definitely good news. After all, the present Zero Wing was already very strong. Moreover, the various major corporations hadn’t been able to do anything against the Guild thus far. Hence, her companions should be relatively safe once they moved to its headquarters.

After ending her conversation with Shi Feng, Ji Luorong promptly contacted her companions and had them hurry to Zero Wing’s headquarters immediately.
