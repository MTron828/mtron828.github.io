Chapter 3277 - Dual Absolute

Chapter 351 – Dual Absolute

Miniature Ancient World, Dark Thunder Sea:

In the sky above a dark and endless ocean, a luxurious flying ship measuring over a hundred meters in length traveled steadily beneath the thundering sea of clouds.

Lightning capable of tearing apart space continuously struck the surroundings of the flying ship. However, none of these lightning arcs could get within 20 yards of the flying ship. Any that tried would get stopped by an invisible barrier that protected the ship.

“This flying ship is incredible. Is this the might of lost technology?” a girl with a pristine face and delicate body exclaimed as she looked at the dim sky outside the flying ship.

!!

“This is indeed an incredible flying ship. But the fare of 100,000 Magic Crystals per person is equally incredible. Operating this flying ship is even more lucrative than just outright robbing people,” a silver-haired girl sipping on black tea at the open-air bar said, sighing.

These two girls were incredible beauties, and every one of their actions attracted the attention of many players on the ship.

“Aren’t those two a little too beautiful? Even my Guild’s number-one beauty pales in comparison. Moreover, both of them have reached Level 140 already. That’s five levels higher than the average level of current mainstream players. Yet, I’ve never heard of either of their names before.”

“I’ve never heard about that beauty named Midsummer, but I know that silver-haired beauty. She’s the Silver Witch Wu Xiaoxiao. She used to be regarded as a peak genius among our world’s younger generation, but she disappeared from the public eye some time ago. I didn’t think she would make a reappearance here and in such a shocking manner, no less.”

“She’s probably one of the geniuses invited by the Seven Great Powers this time. The seven powers have invited all native geniuses to the Thunder Fortress to wait for the World Passage’s opening, promising to protect all qualified geniuses and ensuring these geniuses can safely enter the Greater God’s Domain to receive the best development opportunities.”

“That’s most likely the case. I heard that Jun Luosha, the Green God Corporation’s number one genius, is also aboard this flying ship.”

“Jun Luosha? The Dual Absolute is also here? It’d be great if I could meet her in person!”

Many Level 135-plus, Tier 4 players rode on the flying ship. These players excitedly started a discussion when they saw Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao, their discussion hitting a peak when they mentioned the player named Jun Luosha.

Jun Luosha? Shi Feng grew confused when he overheard the conversation of the players around him.

Based on the crowd’s discussion, Jun Luosha was apparently the number one genius of the Green God Corporation. Although the Green God Corporation wasn’t comparable to the Greater World’s conglomerates, it was still first-rate among the Greater World’s various corporations.

So, it went without saying that the number one genius nurtured by the Green God Corporation would be someone with extraordinary strength. Yet, whether it was during his previous life or present life, Shi Feng had never heard of Jun Luosha’s name or title until he boarded this flying ship.

While Shi Feng was wondering what kind of person Jun Luosha was, a burst of exclamations came from one part of the ship. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Subsequently, a group of a dozen or so players walked out onto the deck from the ship’s inner section. Out of this group of players, the person who stood out the most was a woman with light cyan hair and clad in pure white holy armor. The woman exuded an intellectual and mature charm, and every one of her movements drew the heartstrings of those looking at her. Even Midsummer’s and Wu Xiaoxiao’s charm paled in comparison to this woman’s. Only women like Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul could possibly match this woman.

“Jun Luosha! It’s the real Jun Luosha!”

“She’s simply too beautiful.”

“Who’s that person walking next to Jun Luosha? Is he some corporation’s young master?”

“Good guess. The young knight next to Jun Luosha is Dark Dragon Knight Franz, the Desolate Star Corporation’s Second Successor. He is also the commander of the Tower Alliance’s sixth trump card legion.”

When the many young geniuses present saw Jun Luosha and Franz appearing together, they couldn’t help but look at the two in envy and admiration.

Jun Luosha had many admirers, some of them being the young masters of corporations. However, out of all these admirers, the one most worthy of Jun Luosha would have to be Franz.

The Desolate Star Corporation was a very powerful and wealthy existence. It owned many hegemonic powers, and its influence extended even to other Realms. The fact that Franz was second-in-line to inherit this powerful corporation already put him well ahead of the competition.

On top of that, even though Franz hadn’t reached 30 years old yet, he had already become a titled expert and the commander of the Tower Alliance’s sixth trump card legion. The average genius simply couldn’t hope to compare to him.

If these achievements weren’t enough to prove his superiority, the dozen or so people standing guard around him should be more than enough. These people were Franz’s bodyguards, and they were all fourth-floor experts.

Normally, if a fourth-floor expert chose to join a hegemonic power, they would be given an executive member’s treatment and granted the position of a legion’s vice commander. Yet, now, these people had chosen to work as Franz’s bodyguards. Some hegemonic powers’ Guild Leaders didn’t even enjoy such treatment.

While everyone was curiously discussing why Jun Luosha and Franz would be together, Jun Luosha suddenly walked up to Wu Xiaoxiao, a twinkle of joy in her eyes.

“I finally get to see you again, Xiaoxiao. I thought you met with some big trouble and had to go into hiding,” Jun Luosha said, feelings of concern and relief on her face as she looked at Wu Xiaoxiao. “Since you’re here now, come with me to the third floor’s restaurant. They serve many delicacies that can permanently increase Basic Attributes there.”

As soon as Jun Luosha finished speaking, Franz, in a somewhat prideful tone, said, “Hello, Miss Wu. I am a good friend of Miss Jun. Since you are Miss Jun’s junior, why don’t you come with us? Many important figures from the various hegemonic powers are gathered in the third floor’s restaurant. I’m sure you will have significant gains in the Thunder Fortress if you get acquainted with them. It’ll also be safer in the restaurant.”

Upon hearing Franz’s invitation, many of the geniuses on the deck couldn’t help but look at Wu Xiaoxiao enviously.

Because this flying ship was the safest and quickest way to reach the Thunder Fortress, the cost of boarding this ship was exorbitant. Each person had to pay a non-negotiable fee of 100,000 Magic Crystals.

To get into the flying ship’s third-floor restaurant, players would even need a VIP membership. Meanwhile, not only did players have to pay 300,000 Magic Crystals for this membership, but they also needed to show proof of having ruled over a city.

However, so long as players got into the third floor’s restaurant, not only would they receive greater security, but they would also get the opportunity to interact with various big shots.

“Senior Sister, Captain Franz, thank you for your kind gesture, but my friends and I like the scenery here, so I won’t be going with you,” Wu Xiaoxiao said, rejecting the invitation without hesitation. “Moreover, I think that this place is also quite safe.”

TL Notes:

[1]Dual Absolute:

If I were to translate the raws of Jun Luosha’s title in full, it would be something like “Sword and Medicine Dual Absolute(剑药双绝).” It’s too long for my liking, so I shortened it to “Dual Absolute.”

I’m bringing this up since the “Sword and Medicine” part gives a lot of information about Jun Luosha. She’s probably a Swordsman/Berserker + Alchemist, or she has a Hidden Class that lets her become a healer+swordsman.
