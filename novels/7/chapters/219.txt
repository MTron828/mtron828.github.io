Chapter 220 - Tier 4 Magic Scroll

First-floor reception hall of Starstreak Trading Firm.

The Starstreak Trading Firm’s store was different from normal stores. As it specialized in big businesses across cities, it had its own specialized reception room set up in the building. At the same time, there was also a sales area located on the first floor of the building. The sales area sold various merchandise such as clothing, weapons, equipment, potions, alchemy products, magic scrolls, and much more. This place was just like a supermarket in reality.

A trading firm was different from the Auction House. As the Auction House charged players exorbitant processing fees, the items sold there were far more expensive than the items sold in normal stores. Earning money in God’s Domain was no simple task. Hence, rather selling their wares at the Auction Houses, losing 15% of their profits in the process, a large majority of the players in God’s Domain would prefer to spend more time, selling their wares at trading companies or stores.

“Esteemed Sir, how may I assist you?” The beautiful and dignified young lady at the receptionist counter smiled at Shi Feng.

“I wish to meet President Henry. Please tell President Henry that Lady Sharlyn sent me to speak with him,” Shi Feng said.

“Please wait for a moment. I will notify the president immediately.”

The receptionist immediately took out a Multicolored Communication Crystal, transferring Shi Feng’s information through the crystal.

After several minutes...

“Mister Ye Feng, the President is waiting for you in the President’s Office on the third floor.”

“Thank you.”

Immediately, Shi Feng walked towards the spiral staircase in the distance.

When he arrived before the President’s Office on the third floor, he met two Level 150 guards who stood by the office’s door. Average players were absolutely not allowed to enter the President’s Office.

In the past, countless Guild executives had queued up in front of this office. They had wished to meet with President Henry to discuss matters of renting out the first floor of Starstreak Trading Firm’s store for business. Unfortunately, they did not manage to catch even the shadow of President Henry.

However, when Shi Feng walked up to the office, the two ferocious-looking guards immediately parted the sturdy, mahogany doors for him.

Inside the luxurious and spacious office, a man in his fifties sat on a sofa in the middle of the room. The man had an elegant and dignified appearance. This person was indeed President Henry of Starstreak Trading Firm, and he was a well-known financial magnate in White River City.

“Your Excellency, Ye Feng, please, sit,” President Henry said when his eyes met Shi Feng’s, his finger pointing to the beastskin sofa before him.

“President Henry, this is the contract that Miss Sharlyn wanted me to bring to you.” Shi Feng sat down. He retrieved the contract from his bag, handing it over for Henry’s inspection.

“No need. Before you arrived, Her Highness Sharlyn had already notified me of your coming here. I’ve also learned some information about you from Her Highness Sharlyn. The young truly are promising,” Henry praised. He then said, “Since you are here now, I feel reassured.”

“Reassured? What are you reassured about?” Shi Feng had a bewildered look on his face. Just what was President Henry saying?

Also, just what did Sharlyn tell Henry?

“Oh? Did Her Highness Sharlyn not tell Your Excellency about it?” Confused, Henry said, “This contract was set between me and Her Highness Sharlyn. As long as Her Highness can save the Starstreak Trading Firm from its current predicament, she will obtain 20% of Starstreak Trading Firm’s shares and the Tier 4 Magic Scroll that was obtained from the ancient ruins.”

“You say 20% of the company’s shares and a Tier 4 Magic Scroll?” Shi Feng’s expression froze.

Sharlyn was simply ruthless. Sharlyn had sent him to deal with the predicament, yet, she would receive a Tier 4 Magic Scroll in addition to 20% of the company’s shares?

“That’s right. I’ve already mentioned this to Her Highness. As long as Your Excellency can save us from this predicament, that Tier 4 Magic Scroll will belong to Your Excellency,” Henry said, nodding his head.

“May I know what kind of magic scroll it is?” Shi Feng was incredibly curious about the Tier 4 Magic Scroll.

In the past, the most powerful magic scroll Shi Feng had seen was only a Tier 4. If he sold the scroll, the minimum price for it would be 500 Gold Coins. If it were an amazing Tier 4 Magic Scroll, he could even sell it for over 1,000 Gold Coins. However, players who obtained a Tier 4 Magic Scroll were not usually willing to sell it.

“It is a Tier 4 Position Teleportation Scroll. With it, one can teleport to anywhere they wished within an instant. However, this scroll was made using the technology of an ancient civilization. In our current era, we have no way of replicating such technology. Hence, this scroll is the only one that currently exists in Star-Moon Kingdom. It is priceless,” Henry said pridefully. This scroll was his most precious treasure; he had always been reluctant to part with it. If it were not for the trading firm facing a great predicament, he would never willingly offer this Tier 4 Magic Scroll as a remuneration.

Hearing Henry saying so, Shi Feng came to a realization.

If he had the Tier 4 Position Teleportation Scroll, he could teleport directly to the Dark Den. He would not even have to waste time searching for its exact location. It was no wonder Sharlyn was so confident in her information.

“President Henry, I wonder what sort of predicament your trading firm wishes me to solve?” Shi Feng asked.

“To be honest, bandits have snatched one of our shipments carrying precious merchandise, costing the trading firm massively. To make up for the loss, our trading firm had to pay a large sum of money as compensation, which in turn, resulted in our trading firm facing its current crisis. So, I hope that Your Excellency can help us resolve this predicament. Otherwise, if this problem drags on for another month, our trading firm will have to declare bankruptcy,” Henry unhurriedly explained.

“Then, President Henry, are you telling me to get rid of those bandits and retrieve your stolen merchandise?”

“It would be best if that is possible.”

“Then, which band of bandits stole your merchandise?”

“The Black Scorpion Corps of Black Cloud Ridge, led by Black Scorpion himself. He is a Level 180 Tier 3 Shadow Warrior. If you can get rid of him and retrieve our merchandise, I would greatly appreciate it.”

Hearing the words “Tier 3 Shadow Warrior,” Shi Feng nearly fell off of his seat.

Was President Henry telling him to deal with a Tier 3 NPC? Only players who did not know how to write the word “death” would accept this request! Not to mention a month, Shi Feng would still fail this task even if he had two years to complete it!

This had to be a joke!

Shi Feng had originally thought that the Epic Quest’s difficulty had been reduced. Rather, wasn’t this the exact opposite?!

Noticing Shi Feng’s troubled expression, Henry once more unhurriedly said, “If Your Excellency feels that this request is too difficult, there is a second option. It is also for this reason that Her Highness Sharlyn sent Your Excellency here.”

Shi Feng slightly recovered from his shock as he heard that there was a second option.

“In reality, our trading firm also feels that it is impossible to retrieve the merchandise. The only possibility for Starstreak Trading Firm to get through this predicament is for us to collect 30,000 Gold Coins within a month.

“Her Highness Sharlyn has always praised Your Excellency as a business prodigy. If Your Excellency manages our Starstreak Trading Firm, I believe that we can achieve that goal.”

Seeing Henry’s anticipating gaze, Shi Feng only wanted to curse.

Just because he managed to earn a few Coins, he was suddenly a business prodigy...

What kind of sick joke was this?

Earning 30,000 Gold in a month! Moreover, he didn’t actually have 30 days at all! Considering the time when the great demon would appear, Shi Feng would, at most, have 20 days to earn 30,000 Gold Coins. Even if he currently earned 100 Gold or so per day, ten days would only net him 1,000 Gold, while 30 days would only net him at 3,000 Gold. That was only one-tenth of the required amount!

Players were still stuck in the initial stages of God’s Domain right now, so it was impossible for anyone to make that much money.

If one added a week’s earnings of every player in the White River City region together, it might equal 30,000 Gold. How was he supposed to earn that sort of money?

He might as well become a bandit and snatch the money from someone else.

No, that’s not right! Even if he tried to steal it, there was no way he could get that much money!

Before Shi Feng could reject the quest, a system notification popped up before him.
