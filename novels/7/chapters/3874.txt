Chapter 3875 - 949 - Top Ten Experts

“Lunar River? Who is this?” Frost Raven was stunned again when she saw who was ranked second on the Divine Glory List. No matter how much she searched her memories, she couldn’t recall any information on the player named Lunar River.

Although the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Divine Glory List would see significant changes in every iteration, that was only true for the bottom ranks. As for the top 100 ranks, it wouldn’t be strange for them to remain the same for several months or even a year. As for the top 10 ranks, it had already been years since a change occurred.

Yet, the Divine Glory List’s top two ranks were now under different ownership. Moreover, they were occupied by experts Frost Raven had never heard of.

Before today, Solitary Warlord, the former number one on the Divine Glory List, had defended his position for over a decade. He was also the youngest expert to join the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Senate, becoming one of the Alliance’s twelve Grand Elders. Even Spear Paradise, the former number ten on the Divine Glory List and Scarecrow Fox’s Great Commander, couldn’t survive more than three moves against Solitary Warlord. It was also rumored that Solitary Warlord was very close to becoming a Mortal God.

But now, Solitary Warlord occupied neither first nor second place on the Divine Glory List. This situation made Frost Raven seriously doubt the validity of the Divine Glory List before her.

Just as Frost Raven was about to express her skepticism to Azure Dragon, she suddenly noticed the addition of a Combat Power Evaluation section to the Divine Glory List. Immediately, she inspected the evaluations of Purgatory Jade and Lunar River.

1st – Purgatory Jade – Sixth-Floor Expert

2nd – Lunar River – Overlimit Expert

“How is this possible?!” Frost Raven gawked at the two’s evaluations.

The sixth-floor standard, also known as the Mortal God standard, was an unattainable goal for most experts in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain. If Frost Raven hadn’t witnessed a sixth-floor expert in the Continental Championship, she would have similarly thought it impossible to reach that standard.

Nonetheless, Frost Raven felt the sixth-floor standard remained far from her reach. She also doubted that anybody from the human race’s Greater God’s Domain could reach it anytime soon.

Yet, someone had reached it. Moreover, it was an expert she had never heard of before.

As for the Overlimit standard, it was as much of a legend as the sixth-floor standard in the Greater God’s Domain. After all, many fifth-floor experts already had difficulty achieving a 100% Completion Rate with their Tier 6 Skills and Spells, let alone exceeding the 120% threshold. Achieving the Overlimit standard might be even more challenging than the sixth-floor standard.

“The top two is only the tip of the iceberg,” Azure Dragon said, unsurprised by Frost Raven’s reaction. “The later ranks are even more shocking.”

“Even more shocking?” Her curiosity piqued by Azure Dragon’s words, Frost Raven quickly turned the pages to inspect the Divine Glory List’s later ranks.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

3rd – Elise – Sixth-Floor Expert

4th – Kowloon Demon – Sixth-Floor Expert

5th – Red Frost – Sixth-Floor Expert

6th – Black Flame – Pseudo-Sixth-Floor Expert

7th – Solitary Warlord – Pseudo-Sixth-Floor Expert

8th – Aurebeth – Pseudo-Sixth-Floor Expert

9th – Mourning Tone – Pseudo-Sixth-Floor Expert

10th – Spear Paradise – Pseudo-Sixth-Floor Expert

When Frost Raven finished inspecting the top ten ranks, the shock in her eyes intensified. She even started to wonder if she was hallucinating.

“How could there be so many sixth-floor experts?!” Frost Raven looked at Azure Dragon in disbelief.

She wouldn’t have been as surprised if only the top two players on the Divine Glory List had achieved the unprecedented. After all, the Greater God’s Domain was vast, so it wasn’t impossible for one or two extraordinary monsters to appear.

But now, four out of the Divine Glory List’s top five experts had achieved the sixth-floor standard, with the remaining one having achieved the Overlimit standard. Solitary Warlord, the undisputed number one expert of the Divine Glory List for over a decade, was even knocked down to seventh place.

“This is why I called you here,” Azure Dragon said sternly. “According to the information I received, Everlasting City’s competition is the main reason behind the Divine Glory List’s overhaul. Moreover, it isn’t just the human race that has gained sixth-floor experts. Many of the Holy Race’s and the Crystallian race’s younger generation experts have also achieved the sixth-floor standard.

“The upcoming war among the three races might pose a huge threat to the various powers, but it is also an opportunity for talented individuals to shine. Although the Tower of the Abyss offers extensive guidance, we will never get to fight sixth-floor experts unless we can conquer the fifth floor. However, that might not be the case for the war. The two other races are bound to have the top experts of their younger generation participate. If we can challenge their sixth-floor experts, they will help us more than the Tower of the Abyss.

“The Great Commander knows you are eager to achieve the sixth-floor standard, so he asked me to take you to that secret land to level up. He hopes you can raise your level before the war so it doesn’t become a weakness later.”

“Really?” Frost Raven grew excited at Azure Dragon’s words.

As the Order of Twelve was an alliance of adventurer teams in the Eternal Realm, it had hardly any Taboo Secret Lands in the Greater God’s Domain. It was especially so for Level 235 Taboo Secret Lands. The entirety of the Order of Twelve owned only one such secret land. Moreover, it was a medium-sized one shared with other pseudo-apex powers. This greatly limited the number of members the Order of Twelve could send into the secret land.

“Of course, so get ready to leave,” Azure Dragon said, chuckling. “If the Holy Race and the Crystallian race want to have an easier time occupying the ancient ruins on our side, they will have to invade our NPC Cities before the first Void Beast Tide. The NPC Cities the Order of Twelve is based in will likely come under siege at that time. Hence, the Great Commander has decided to loosen the entry conditions for that secret land. So, make sure to do your best to catch up in levels. The upcoming war is an opportunity you do not want to miss.”

Frost Raven nodded, her eyes shining as she said, “I’m ready to go, Commander Azure!”

As the entrances into the Eternal Realm remained unsafe, the various powers of the three races could afford to send only a small number of elites to fight in the upcoming war. This created a conducive environment for the geniuses of the three races to fight. She had to capitalize on this opportunity. Otherwise, once the entrances became safe, war weapons would quickly take over the leading role in the war, and opportunities for geniuses and experts to clash would become scarce, just like the current situation in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain.

…

As Frost Raven left Shadowring Town with Azure Dragon, a 20-man team escaped pursuit from hundreds of experts on a Void Island in the Greater God’s Domain. Currently, the members of this 20-man team were gasping for breath as they slumped on a pile of rubble, their faces pale from Stamina and Concentration exhaustion.

“These Demon’s Gate lunatics! All we did was pass by that ruin! Did they have to chase after us for so many days?!” a Level 233 Shield Warrior complained angrily.

“They’re not just chasing us. According to my friend, Demon’s Gate has placed a bounty to have all of us permanently eliminated from God’s Domain…,” a middle-aged elven man, who was a Level 231 Ranger, said in despair. “With Demon’s Gate’s bounty on our heads, we’ll be doomed, even if we make it into the Eternal Realm.”

“Chisha, don’t you have some connections with the Eternal Chamber of Commerce? Do you have a way to get Demon’s Gate off our backs?” the leader of the team, who was a middle-aged man and a Level 239 Cleric, asked as he looked at Xuanwu Chisha, the Iron Valkyrie.

“I might have some connections, but if we’re talking about getting the Eternal Chamber of Commerce to stop Demon’s Gate from coming after us, I’m afraid…,” Xuanwu Chisha, who had reached Level 235, said as she studied the latest edition of the Divine Glory List. However, before she could finish her words, her mind froze when she saw who was ranked sixth on the latest Divine Glory List. “Sixth place?! A pseudo-sixth-floor expert?!”
