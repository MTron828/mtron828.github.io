Chapter 429 – Unfathomable

Reckless Knight!

He was not only the Paimon Conglomerate’s Second Paragon but also the only expert in the Starlight Realm to have entered the Sacred Glory List. Yet, now, he was defeated by a young man of unknown origins. At this time, even the spectators outside the battlefield had a hard time accepting this outcome, let alone the Riverlight City’s participants who were at the scene of the battle.

Who is this person?

Thousand Scars was in shock as she watched the shy-looking young man sheath his longsword after killing Reckless Knight.

Anyone with eyes could see that Reckless Knight was incredibly strong. It would be almost impossible to find another youth of his strength throughout the Starlight Realm.

Reckless Knight’s strength was also why the Divine Seal Saint had left the matter of dealing with Zero Wing to him.

Previously, the fact that Cheng Xin could fight Reckless Knight to a standstill despite having a delay imposed on her movements was already plenty unbelievable in Thousand Scars’ opinion. Yet, now, even while subjected to the same delay, the shy-looking young man had defeated Reckless Knight in only twelve moves. If Thousand Scars hadn’t seen this fight with her own eyes, she would have never believed such a thing could be possible.

Meanwhile, after a short silence, an uproar occurred among Star Lake City’s inhabitants.

“This young man is so strong!”

“Amazing! This is simply amazing! I initially thought this ten-man battle group was there just to make up for numbers, but now…our city’s victory is all but guaranteed!”

“I can’t believe a single battle group would have so many incredible experts. No wonder Commander Red Frost chose to let a rookie establish an ace battle group all by himself.”

…

At this time, the eyes of Star Lake City’s spectators were practically glowing as they looked at the shy-looking young man displayed on the holographic screen, their excited hearts refusing to calm down.

Previously, everyone had been feeling rather gloomy because of Reckless Knight’s performance. After all, it was considered overkill for a pseudo-great grandmaster to participate in even second-tier city battles, let alone a third-tier city battle.

With a mental strength expert of such caliber on Riverlight City’s side, the chances of Star Lake City’s Tier 4 battle groups achieving a good result were very slim.

However, now that someone on Star Lake City’s side had defeated Reckless Knight, the situations of Star Lake City and Riverlight City were instantly reversed.

…

“How can a Guild with no background have so many monsters fighting for it?”

Resting in the participants’ corner, Chen Qilin abruptly shot up from his seat, his face looking like he had just seen a ghost as he stared at the shy-looking young man’s figure through the holographic screen above the city.

It was already astonishing that a pseudo-great grandmaster had appeared in Zero Wing’s battle group.

Yet, now, it was revealed that in addition to Cheng Xin, Zero Wing’s battle group had another Swordsman who was even stronger than Cheng Xin. How were Riverlight City’s battle groups supposed to win like this?

At this time, even if the other battle groups of Star Lake City chose to do nothing, Zero Wing’s battle group could take on all of Riverlight City’s Tier 4 battle groups by itself, leaving Riverlight City with no chances of victory. Not to mention, the other battle groups of Star Lake City had only promised him that they wouldn’t help Zero Wing. They never promised that they wouldn’t contest for capture points.

…

Star Lake City’s VIP spectator stands:

“Using twelve moves to defeat Reckless Knight… Who is this young man?” White Owl muttered, greatly shocked and confused by the fact that Reckless Knight was so handily defeated.

White Owl was one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s Ten Great Paragons, and she had sparred against Reckless Knight on multiple occasions in the past. So, compared to other people, she had a much better understanding of just how powerful Reckless Knight was.

In addition to being a pseudo-great grandmaster with a Legendary Weapon, Reckless Knight also possessed two Exclusive Absolute Techniques; one to enhance his offensive capabilities and the other to enhance his maneuverability. On top of that, Reckless Knight had also reached the fifth-floor standard when it came to combat standards. With all of these factors combined, he could keep himself alive for a long time, even if he went up against three fifth-floor experts simultaneously, let alone one.

Yet, even while subjected to a movement delay, the shy-looking youth had managed to defeat Reckless Knight in twelve moves. This was simply unbelievable.

“I really didn’t expect to see not just the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s Little Princess but also the Luminous Glory List’s 216th-ranked Amber Soul…” Suddenly, Nameless Blade laughed and said, “Things are going to be interesting. The outside world has always assumed that Zero Wing doesn’t have any background, so how exactly did Zero Wing manage to recruit the help of two such big shots?”

White Owl’s pupils froze when she heard Nameless Blade’s words.

“Amber Soul?!” White Owl exclaimed while staring intently at the shy-looking young man. “He’s the Sword Emperor Amber Soul?!”

Amber Soul was labeled a once-in-a-century genius by the Seven Luminaries Alliance, and he had entered the Luminous Glory List’s top 300 at a very young age. His achievement was one that hadn’t been seen for the past century, and he became known by all in the Greater God’s Domain for this reason.

Some apex powers had even extended an olive branch to Amber Soul because of his achievement. Only, for some reason, Amber Soul never agreed to join any of these apex powers.

Hence, White Owl found it incredibly unbelievable that a Guild with supposedly no background like Zero Wing could manage to recruit the help of Amber Soul. After all, many conglomerates had tried to hire Amber Soul’s services but to no avail.

“It seems we have underestimated Zero Wing,” Nameless Blade said after taking a deep breath. “Not only is it related to a Swordsman nearing Primordial Gods, but it even has close ties to Cheng Xin and Amber Soul…”

…

On the battlefield…

“Are we still going to help them, Boss Markless?” the Assassin youth standing next to Markless Blade asked as he looked at Riverlight City’s dazed participants.

At this time, the situation had clearly turned against Riverlight City’s ace battle groups following Reckless Knight’s death. After all, even a layman could tell right now that Riverlight City’s participants had already lost the will to fight.

“Of course we are!” Markless Blade hurriedly said after coming back to his senses. “If not now, when are we supposed to go and help?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Now that Riverlight City’s participants had suffered a huge blow to their morale, it was the perfect time to kill them. Although killing Riverlight City’s participants wouldn’t earn them any contribution points, it would make occupying capture points much easier later.

Immediately, Markless Blade led his battle group to swiftly dispatch Riverlight City’s participants.

At the same time, Gentle Snow, Hidden Soul, and the others on Shi Feng’s side also snapped out of their dazes and began attacking the enemies around them.

For a time, Riverlight City’s participants, despite having a numerical advantage, could be seen fleeing in all directions, none daring to stand their ground. Unfortunately, their efforts to escape were futile in front of the two pseudo-great grandmasters of Zero Wing’s battle group. Not to mention, Leroja, Cross, and Desolate Fury had also started to take action at this time.

When the trio started taking action, many people quickly recognized them. Leroja and Cross were especially recognizable.

Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac were individuals known by all in the Myriad Forest Empire and its neighboring countries. Their fame ascended to even greater heights after successfully winning an invitation for the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the two ranked among the top of the Starlight Realm’s younger generation.

Hence, when everyone saw Leroja and Cross fighting for Zero Wing’s battle group, they couldn’t help but be astonished. Markless Blade, in particular, was dumbfounded by this situation.

Normally, Leroja couldn’t even be bothered to participate in second-tier city battles. Yet, now, she was helping Zero Wing fight in Star Lake City’s city battle…

Meanwhile, once the other members of Zero Wing’s battle group started taking action, it didn’t take more than five minutes before Riverlight City’s five ace battle groups were annihilated. Of the 100 titled experts who had invaded Star Lake City’s territory, none survived.
