Chapter 2112 – God Mode Regional Dungeon

When Shi Feng stated his condition, everything in the VIP reception room seemed to freeze. Both Yuan Tiexin and Liang Jing, who stood behind Shi Feng, stared at the Swordsman incredulously.

Most of the Guilds in God’s Domain recognized the Secret Chamber of Commerce for the extraordinary existence it was, and those who could become members were either superpowers or powers with immensely powerful backgrounds.

However, only those that had truly joined the Secret Chamber of Commerce would understand how frightening the Chamber was. Only a few of God’s Domain’s powers could match the reach of Secret’s influence.

The Secret Chamber of Commerce ranked at the very top in the game in both its ability to sell merchandise and its ability to collect materials.

This was why the majority of God’s Domain’s superpowers dreamed of joining Secret.

When Liang Jing had taken over the Candlelight Trading Firm’s business, she had learned how frightening Secret Was. She was not a pure gamer like Shi Feng, but she had managed a company before, so she knew business and economics far better than most of God’s Domain’s players.

She already found it astonishing that Zero Wing had become a member of the Secret Chamber of Commerce. She hadn’t expected such exceptional results from Shi Feng.

But now, the man demanded status as one of Secret’s advanced members!

She had no idea what to say about this. His demand was beyond daylight robbery.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, this condition is simply impossible. Do you know what price the Secret Chamber of Commerce’s advanced members had to pay to get to their position?” Contrary to expectations, Yuan Tiexin wasn’t angry about Shi Feng’s condition. Instead, he calmly said, “I can tell you now that even with over tens of thousands of Stamina Gemstones and all of Zero Wing City, you still wouldn’t qualify to become an advanced member.”

Even Super Guilds coveted the Secret Chamber of Commerce’s advanced membership, but the number of Super Guilds that actually became advanced members could be counted on one hand.

If Starlink hadn’t handed over an astronomical amount of resources and.

Advanced members’ status in the Secret Chamber of Commerce was extraordinary. Not only did they have access to more sales channels, but they also had some control of the Chamber itself and received 5% of the Chamber’s profits.

While 5% might not seem like much, it was enough to rival 50% of an ordinary superpower’s income with the scale of Secret’s operations. In other words, by becoming an advanced member in the Secret Chamber of Commerce, one would gain half of an ordinary superpower’s resources. Claiming that one could become a titan in God’s Domain by becoming an advanced member was no exaggeration.

How could a few Stamina Gemstones possibly rival such benefits?

Stamina Gemstones might be a significant boon to players in neutral maps right now, but as players leveled up, they’d acquire better items. Naturally, players would find more items that increased maximum Stamina and Stamina recovery. They wouldn’t have to worry about lacking Stamina items in the future. Furthermore, Stamina Gemstones were very scarce right now. Zero Wing didn’t have enough to affect the big picture. At most, it had enough for the various powers to gain a slight advantage when exploring neutral maps.

“Elder Yuan, I know the value of advanced membership,” Shi Feng said, smiling. “Naturally, I have my reasons for stating this condition; I’m not just spouting empty words.”

“Oh? What is Guild Leader Black Flame willing to offer, then?” Yuan Tiexin could not help his growing curiosity.

Yuan Tiexin, more or less, understood Shi Feng’s personality. The man wasn’t some ignorant fool. He was a Domain Realm expert, and if he dared to say such a thing, he had the confidence to back it up.

However, Yuan Tiexin also found it very difficult to imagine what Zero Wing could possibly offer to convince the Secret Pavilion that Zero Wing should become an advanced member.

“I’ll hand over 40% of Stone Forest Town’s shares!” Shi Feng declared. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“S-Stone Forest Town?” Yuan Tiexin was stupefied by Shi Feng’s answer. For a moment, he even wondered if he had heard wrong. “Guild Leader Black Flame, are you talking about the Stone Forest Town in the Stoneclaw Mountains?”

“That’s right. I’m talking about that Stone Forest Town.” Shi Feng nodded.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, if you are not interested in this transaction, I won’t force you to agree to it. If there is nothing else to discuss, we’ll be taking our leave,” Yuan Tiexin said as he inwardly rolled his eyes at Shi Feng. He was sure that Shi Feng was toying with him.

Not even two Zero Wing Cities would be enough to buy an advanced membership in the Secret Chamber of Commerce, let alone an Advanced Town like Stone Forest Town. Moreover, Shi Feng only offered 40% of the town’s shares.

Even Liang Jing felt that Shi Feng had gone overboard with his latest joke.

Stone Forest Town was indeed an excellent Advanced Town, but the map it occupied was no longer suitable for players to level up. Stone Forest Town wasn’t even worth as much as Silverwing Town, much less Zero Wing City.

What if I tell you that I can move Stone Forest Town to the Ancient Undead Country’s Bottomless Abyss?” Shi Feng unhurriedly mentioned as he watched Yuan Tiexin stand from his seat and turn to leave.

“What?” Yuan Tiexin was stunned. He spun around and demanded, “Are you telling the truth?”

As far as the Secret Pavilion knew, the Ancient Undead Country’s Bottomless Abyss was the only God Mode Regional Dungeon in God’s Domain. The Bottomless Abyss was a Level 60 to Level 100 super-large-scale Regional Dungeon, and not only did it have far more resources than Asura Mode Regional Dungeons, but the Dungeon’s monsters also dropped Seven Luminaries Crystals.

Unfortunately, the Ancient Undead Country’s environment was exceptionally harsh. Players would have an extremely difficult time surviving inside the Dungeon. In fact, entering and leaving the Dungeon was immensely troublesome, not to mention exploring it.

A large part of the reason that the Secret Chamber of Commerce had agreed to promote Starlink to advanced membership was the Guild’s willingness to hand over the fortress it had obtained in the Ancient Undead Country. Otherwise, Starlink would’ve needed to offer a lot more to elevate its membership.

Yan Tiexin could not fathom how Shi Feng could move Stone Forest Town to the Bottomless Abyss. Setting up a Guild Town in a neutral map was already incredibly difficult, not to mention setting one up in a God Mode Regional Dungeon.

However, if what Shi Feng said were true, the Bottomless Abyss would become one of Zero Wing’s backyards. Exploring the Regional Dungeon would become at least half as difficult, and players wouldn’t need to worry about their survival in the Bottomless Abyss.

“Of course.” Shi Feng nodded.

The idea would be delusional at best for others, but for Shi Feng, the task was only somewhat difficult, not entirely out of the question. To complete the task, Zero Wing would need a large stock of resources, enough that not even top- ranked first-rate Guilds would be able to afford it.

Originally, Shi Feng had planned on setting up Stone Forest Town in a neutral map outside of Star-Moon Kingdom, but now that the Ancient Undead Country had been discovered, he dismissed his initial plans.

God Mode Regional Dungeons were treasure troves, and even the various superpowers would fight for control of the areas. Since someone had discovered the Ancient Undead Country now, and the Secret Pavilion had come knocking on his door, Shi Feng wouldn’t ignore this opportunity.

“Even so, that’s not enough. It’s only a town in a Regional Dungeon,” Yuan Tiexin said, but looking at Shi Feng’s confident expression, he couldn’t help but return to his seat.

“This is the most sincere offer I can make. If it isn’t possible, then I can only apologize for the inconvenience,” Shi Feng said, chuckling at the interest flashing in Yuan Tiexin’s eyes.

“I am absolutely certain that the higher-ups will not agree. You’d be better off requesting another condition,” Yuan Tiexin responded with conviction.

After giving the matter some thought, Shi Feng said, “Since that is the case, then I want Starlink’s advanced membership revoked!”
