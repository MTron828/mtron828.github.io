Chapter 3782 - 856 - Fleeting Strike

TL Notes:
Made a change to the name of the Abyssal Eye’s second Skill in Chapter 846:

Abyssal Power -> Abyssal Will

Flame Dragon God’s Nest, Shadow Mountains, Outer Area:

“Long time no see, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Abyss Water said, smiling at Shi Feng. “The last time we met, you humiliated me in front of the Scarlet Merchant Alliance using your Mana and Basic Attributes advantage. What do you say I return the favor using my level advantage?”

“Nobody can ensure fairness in field PvP,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. He was honestly quite surprised to meet Abyss Water again. “But are you sure you have the strength to back up those words?”

“I might have had difficulty killing you if we were still on Dark Star,” Abyss Water said, recalling Shi Feng’s Gold Body Technique. Then, he smirked and continued, “But we are now in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary! I am also no longer the same as when we first met! Now, I have the Blood Reincarnations! With the Passive Skill of these twin Divine Daggers, I can prevent one target from moving more than a hundred yards away! Unless I am killed, even a Level 240 Ancient God cannot escape me!”

After saying so, Abyss Water surrounded Shi Feng with afterimages before drawing the two crimson daggers he carried and brandishing them. He created a crimson energy blade each time he swung his weapons, and these energy blades repeatedly merged to form larger and more powerful energy blades that could tear through the secret land’s space. In a flash, over thirty such energy blades attacked Shi Feng from various directions.

Advanced Gold Combat Technique, Spiritual Light Blades!

Advanced Gold Combat Technique, Thousand Blades!

Many of the Level 225-plus experts present paled when they saw Abyss Water executing two Advanced Gold Combat Techniques in quick succession. None of them felt they could survive Abyss Water’s attack. Although Abyss Water did not manage to fuse the two techniques, the timing of his execution allowed him to achieve a pseudo-fusion effect that drastically increased the power of his crimson energy blades.

When going up against Abyss Water’s pseudo-fusion technique, even experts with Basic Attributes superior to Abyss Water using an Advanced Gold Defensive Technique wouldn’t necessarily escape unscathed. Not to mention, many of the experts present didn’t even have a Divine Artifact. Only in their dreams could they surpass Abyss Water, who wielded two Divine Artifacts, in Basic Attributes.

“It’s over!” This unexpected turn of events shocked Twilight Leaf.

“Dammit!” Heiser also realized the severity of the situation and quickly raised her staff, creating multiple magic arrays under her feet.

However, before Heiser could intervene, Shi Feng suddenly unsheathed the Shadow Incinerator and used the Abyssal Eye.

Tier 7 Skill, Abyssal Will!

Immediately, the Skill increased Shi Feng’s Defense by 500%, Strength by 400%, Agility by 300%, Physique by 300%, Endurance by 400%, and Concentration by one rank. The improvements weren’t restricted to the Tier 6 Limit standard, either.

Boom!

Suddenly, Shi Feng started to radiate an aura of indescribable power that shattered the surrounding space. The crimson energy blades attacking him also looked like they had frozen in place.

Sword’s Orbit!

Subsequently, dazzling stars filled the area, and the crimson energy blades exploded and faded from existence. And all the while, Shi Feng merely stood in place.

Silence!

Absolute silence!

This development stunned everyone, including Heiser.

Impossible! Abyss Water was dumbfounded as he looked at the Shadow Incinerator in Shi Feng’s hand.

Abyss Water could tell that Shi Feng’s sword technique was nothing special. Yet, Shi Feng’s sword moved at an incredible speed. Logically, not even a Level 230, Tier 6 Swordsman should be able to achieve such a speed, let alone a Level 200, Tier 6 Swordsman.

Before Abyss Water could regain his wits, Shi Feng suddenly transformed into a streak of light and appeared behind him. Then, under the gazes of the surrounding players, Shi Feng casually sheathed the Shadow Incinerator.

Click.

When the Shadow Incinerator returned to its sheath, Abyss Water noticed his line of sight shifting upward. Then, a headless body briefly entered his sight before his vision darkened.

“Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like you can back up your words.”

After glancing at Abyss Water’s corpse, Shi Feng collected the item Abyss Water dropped, then executed Flowing Space and disappeared into the depths of the Shadow Mountains.

Abyssal Will only had a five-minute duration. Although he could trample on Level 225-plus, Tier 6 experts during this period, he would have trouble defeating experts like Abyss Water once the Skill ran out. At the very least, he couldn’t end the fight quickly.

Many Level 220-plus experts from the Divine Wing Dynasty were currently scattered across the Flame Dragon God’s Nest. Even if he were at Level 220, they could easily wear him down with zerg tactics. Not to mention, the Divine Wing Dynasty also had Level 230-plus experts in the secret land.

Thus, the wise thing to do here was to leave the Divine Wing Dynasty’s sphere of activity before Abyssal Will’s duration ended.

“What in heaven…”

“The fight’s over? Just like that?”

“Are you kidding me?! This must be an act! How can a Level 200 Swordsman one-shot Abyss Water?!”

The sight of Shi Feng dispatching Abyss Water in a single motion astounded everyone. They couldn’t get their heads around it.

Abyss Water should have had an overwhelming advantage in Basic Attributes. Yet, the battle concluded with Shi Feng’s landslide victory. If they didn’t know any better, they would have thought Shi Feng was the Level 226 Assassin while Abyss Water was the Level 200 Swordsman.

“Leaf, is Guild Leader Black Flame really at Level 200 only?” Heiser asked as she looked at Twilight Leaf. She couldn’t help but feel that Twilight Leaf knew something she didn’t.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Unless Shi Feng was fully equipped with Divine Artifacts, there was no way he could kill Abyss Water as a Level 200, Tier 6 Swordsman. However, based on her observation, Shi Feng didn’t have a single Divine Artifact on him. This must mean that Shi Feng wasn’t actually a Level 200 player like she previously thought. Instead, he was likely at Level 235 or higher. Otherwise, it didn’t make sense that she couldn’t keep track of Shi Feng’s attack.

“This… I don’t know…,” Twilight Leaf said hesitantly. She originally wanted to say she was certain that Shi Feng was Level 200, but even she couldn’t bring herself to believe that a Level 200 player could execute such a rapid attack. Even with a Tier 6 Berserk Skill, it still shouldn’t be possible.

“You don’t know?” Heiser grew confused. “Didn’t you meet him in person before?”

It was no secret in Holy Dragon Spear that Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf had visited Red Frost in the real world. After all, the adventurer team owned only one interstellar spaceship. Every time the interstellar spaceship was used, it would attract the attention of many in the adventurer team. Borrowing it even required the approval of at least two Grand Elders.

“I did meet Guild Leader Black Flame,” Twilight Leaf said, scratching her cheek awkwardly. “But he hadn’t even reached Level 200 at the time…”
