Chapter 447 – Marriage

Corrosion Mountain Range:

In front of the Courtyard of Space’s teleportation gate…

Following Unrestrained Lionheart, Shi Feng quickly passed through the security network formed by over a hundred Level 140-plus, Tier 5 experts. These Tier 5 experts came from the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers and conglomerates, and they worked together to prevent independent teams and the expert teams of other powers from approaching the teleportation gate.

After passing the security network, Shi Feng saw over ten teams gathered before the teleportation gate. Among these teams, two stood out the most. Each of these two teams had over 70 Tier 5 experts, and they were positioned the closest to the teleportation gate. In addition, Shi Feng could feel his sixth sense warning him of certain individuals among these two teams.

!!

Subsequently, Unrestrained Lionheart led Shi Feng to one of these two teams. Then, he respectfully greeted a beautiful woman wearing a silver-gray robe and wielding a wooden staff.

“Frey?” Shi Feng was taken aback for a moment when he saw the beautiful woman.

Frey!

The Galaxy Conglomerate’s Fourth Princess. She was also the peerless genius whom Shi Feng had met once in the Miniature Ancient World.

However, unlike in the Miniature Ancient World, Frey was currently at Level 141, Tier 5 already. The aura she exuded was vastly stronger than before.

When Frey saw Shi Feng looking at her, she smiled and teasingly said, “We meet again, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

Unrestrained Lionheart was surprised when he heard Frey’s words. Unable to help his curiosity, he looked at Shi Feng and asked, “Are you acquainted with the commander, Mr. Black Flame?”

“Mhm. I had the fortune of being on the same team as Miss Frey in the past,” Shi Feng said somewhat awkwardly.

Previously in the Miniature Ancient World, Shi Feng had exploited Frey’s situation to make a fortune because he thought he would never meet the woman again after the Nether King raid. After all, Frey was one of the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Four Princesses. The Starlight Realm was also such a huge place. So, the possibility of them meeting again should be incredibly small.

However, Shi Feng never thought he would meet Frey in the Eternal Realm. Even more astonishing was that someone of Unstrained Lionheart’s stature would behave so respectfully in front of Frey. This situation was both astonishing and confusing. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

While Frey might be the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Fourth Princess, Unrestrained Lionheart was the vice commander of the Red Dragon Nation’s main force.

In front of the Red Dragon Nation, the Galaxy Conglomerate was nothing. Any one of Red Dragon Nation’s second-level affiliated powers could easily match the Galaxy Conglomerate, let alone the Red Dragon Nation’s stronger first-level affiliated powers. Meanwhile, the Red Dragon Nation had dozens of second-level affiliated powers and over a dozen first-level affiliated powers…

“I see.” When Unrestrained Lionheart heard Shi Feng’s answer, realization dawned upon him as he said, “No wonder Vice Guild Leader Frey agreed to your conditions without hesitation.”

“Vice Guild Leader? You’re saying Miss Frey is a Vice Guild Leader of the Red Dragon Nation?” Shi Feng asked, finding Unrestrained Lionheart’s words a little hard to believe. After all, according to his memories, the Red Dragon Nation didn’t have a Vice Guild Leader named Frey, much less a Vice Guild Leader who was so young.

It should be known that only the strong were respected in a pseudo-apex power. However, even peerless paragons would have difficulty becoming a Vice Guild Leader in a pseudo-apex power before the age of forty. After all, anyone capable of becoming a Vice Guild Leader in a pseudo-apex power would be a peerless paragon at the very minimum, so competition for these limited positions was intense.

Meanwhile, Frey probably wasn’t even 25 years old this year. So, how could she possibly become a Vice Guild Leader of the Red Dragon Nation?

“That’s correct.” Unrestrained Lionheart nodded. Then, in a tone of admiration, he said, “Vice Guild Leader Frey has recently been promoted into the Red Dragon Nation’s Ninth Vice Guild Leader. Excluding the Red Dragon Nation’s Founding Elders, she is the first person in the Guild to have met the requirements to become a Vice Guild Leader at such a young age.”

Death Omen and Thousand Scars, who were also on the team, similarly looked at Frey in admiration.

The fact that Nameless Blade could become the Paimon Conglomerate’s Third Paragon at such a young age was already an incredible feat. He was even only half a step away from reaching the fifth-floor standard. However, compared to Frey, Nameless Blade’s achievements were nothing. Frey stood on a completely different level from Nameless Blade.

Honestly, the only reason Death Omen and Thousand Scars could be a part of the Red Dragon Nation’s team was that they had provided the Red Dragon Nation with some information relating to the ruin this time and because they had an incomplete map for half of the ruin. If not for these reasons, they would never have qualified to join Frey’s team.

While Shi Feng was talking with Unrestrained Lionheart, a man looking like he was in his fifties approached Frey. The man was one of the Tier 5 players on Frey’s team, and he exuded a terrifying aura. After walking up to Frey, the man quietly reminded, “The ruin will soon activate, Vice Guild Leader Frey.”

“I know, Elder Parker.” Frey nodded. Then, she looked at Shi Feng and earnestly stated, “Guild Leader Black Flame, as per our agreement, you will have full command over the team. However, if the team’s casualty rate exceeds 20%, I will be taking back the team’s command and your item selection right. I hope you don’t forget.”

After saying so, Frey made Shi Feng the team’s leader, her actions shocking the experts on the team. Only Death Omen, Thousand Scars, and Unrestrained Lionheart remained unfazed.

“Please rest assured, Vice Guild Leader Frey. So long as the team’s casualty rate exceeds 20%, I will immediately surrender the team’s command. I won’t even ask for any payment for my services this time,” Shi Feng said confidently.

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, a low laugh suddenly came from a distance.

“It’s been a while since I last saw you, Frey, but it seems your judgment is getting worse with time.” The person who spoke was a handsome and muscular man who had already reached Level 142, Tier 5. While walking up to Frey, the man smiled and said, “You might as well marry me now. Once you do, both you and your family will have better futures ahead of you.”

“You think too highly of yourself, Moro.” Frey did not get angry at the approaching man’s words. Instead, she calmly said, “I am now the Ninth Vice Guild Leader, while you are still the Seven Vice Guild Leader. With the opportunities in the Eternal Realm, do you think I will need long to surpass you?”

The man named Moro suddenly laughed.

“If you can secure this ruin’s First Clear, you might indeed have a chance to surpass me,” Moro said as he looked at Frey with an admiring gaze. Then, he slowly continued, “It’s a pity you won’t get such a chance.”

As soon as Moro finished speaking, Elder Parker, who originally stood behind Frey, suddenly walked over to Moro and stood behind him. At the same time, over a dozen other Tier 5 experts on Frey’s side joined Elder Parker on Moro’s side. Moreover, six of these Tier 5 experts were fifth-floor experts.

All of a sudden, silence fell over the area.

“What is the meaning of this, Elder Parker?” Frey asked as she looked at Elder Parker, her calm expression wavering for the first time. “The Galaxy Conglomerate has treated you well all these years, hasn’t it?”

Parker was an Elder of the Galaxy Conglomerate, and he had risen to this position by climbing up from the conglomerate’s bottom ranks. Because of his history and strength, the status he enjoyed in the Galaxy Conglomerate was second to only the conglomerate’s successors.

“You are right. Galaxy has indeed treated me well,” Parker said, nodding. “However, I have also fought for over a century for Galaxy and allowed the conglomerate to secure a foothold in the Holy World, so I have long paid back my debt. Now that Lord Moro is willing to recommend me for an Elder position in the Red Dragon Nation, I simply cannot bring myself to turn down such an offer.”

Just when Frey was about to say something, Moro interjected and said, “Which is why I say your judgment has grown worse, Frey. Anyway, once you’ve made up your mind, you can come and marry me anytime. But if you stay obstinate, you might not get to keep your place as the Ninth Vice Guild Leader for long.”
