Chapter 409 – Exclusive Absolute Technique

Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury were very familiar with the appearance of the player named Black Flame.

It was especially so for Desolate Fury.

When Desolate Fury again saw the inconspicuous yet familiar person, feelings of surprise and melancholy filled his heart.

When they first met in the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition, Desolate Fury’s first impression of the player named Black Flame was that the other party was insane. After all, only a lunatic would dare to provoke Saint Three, who happened to be the pinnacle of Tier 4 players in the Ancient River Kingdom at the time.

However, contrary to Desolate Fury’s expectations, Black Flame had not only made it into the Rookie Competition’s finals, but he had even proceeded to become the Rookie Competition’s champion. As a result, not only did Black Flame’s fame instantly overshadow Saint Three but he was even granted the title of the Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon, a title that hadn’t been granted to anyone for the past several decades.

Later on, Desolate Fury heard that Black Flame had ended up offending the Paimon Conglomerate’s Young Master Dira and incensed the Divine Seal Saint into sending an army after him. Yet, just when Desolate Fury and everyone else in the Ancient River Kingdom thought that Black Flame was doomed, Black Flame became an expert on the Luminous Glory List after a stunning battle in the World Passage.

A Luminous Glory List expert!

This was a dazzling glory that even Saint Three could only look up at in awe.

Meanwhile, when Cross and Leroja saw Black Flame appearing before them, mixed feelings filled their hearts.

Initially, even after Black Flame became the champion of the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition, neither Cross nor Leroja felt they were inferior to him. At most, they thought of him as a strong competitor. After all, the Rookie Competition’s finals at the time didn’t involve a direct duel between the top 10 finalists. It was more so a test to see who had the better equipment standard.

Hence, nobody could say for certain who would win in an actual duel.

Not to mention, their goal was never to become the Rookie Competition’s champion. Instead, their goal was to qualify for the official phase of the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition.

Only, neither Cross nor Leroja had expected Black Flame to become an expert on the Luminous Glory List in the short time they hadn’t seen him.

“He’s Black Flame, the Asura Sword Emperor!”

“So, he’s?that?Asura Sword Emperor?”

When the other players present saw Shi Feng walking closer and closer to them, they promptly ceased their offensive on Desolate Fury’s group and looked at Shi Feng warily.

The Luminous Glory List was a compilation of the Greater God’s Domain’s top 1,000 Tier 4 experts under the age of 35. Every individual on the list stood at the pinnacle of Tier 4 in the Greater God’s Domain. Even someone at the bottom of the Luminous Glory List was overwhelmingly stronger than titled experts.

“So, you’re Black Flame?” Ghost Hand wasn’t all too surprised when he saw Shi Feng coming out of his attack unscathed. On the contrary, he smiled at this sight. “I thought I would never get my revenge on you. I never thought I would actually meet you here. Now, I’m going to let those fools over at the Seven Luminaries Alliance know how unreliable their ranking lists are!”

The latest edition of the Luminous Glory List was originally supposed to be the stepping stone for Ghost Hand to propel himself to the apex of his Realm. However, he had lost this opportunity because the Seven Luminaries Alliance made the laughable decision to put Shi Feng on the 963rd rank of the Luminous Glory List after Shi Feng defeated two paragons from the Paimon Conglomerate.

From Ghost Hand’s perspective, whether it was the Paimon Conglomerate’s Storm or Saint Arm, both were trash. This was because neither of them was even at the pseudo-fifth-floor standard. If it were up to him, he could have handily defeated six of such experts simultaneously, let alone two. So, on what basis did Shi Feng deserve to get ranked 963rd on the Luminous Glory List?

After Ghost Hand finished speaking, he suddenly vanished from everyone’s vision.

“Be careful! He’s not a Swordsman!” Leroja shouted when she saw Ghost Hand disappearing. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This was a discovery she had made only recently. More specifically, it was after Ghost Hand had evaded her ultimate move, Blood Arrow. Unlike Cross, she could tell that Ghost Hand didn’t rely on only his sixth sense to evade her attack. Instead, he had paired his sixth sense with a Skill.

He’s not a Swordsman?

Cross was stunned by Leroja’s revelation.

Out of the 99 Absolute Techniques in the Greater God’s Domain, the 9th-ranked Star Rain was a type of swordsmanship. So, to say that Ghost Hand wasn’t a Swordsman was absurd.

“Not bad, pretty lady. You actually guessed that Boss Ghost isn’t a Swordsman.”

“It’s a pity that your warning is too late. Now that Black Flame has let Boss Ghost get within 100 yards of him, he’s as good as dead.”

Ghost Hand’s subordinates were quite surprised by Leroja’s statement. At the same time, though, they couldn’t help but laugh.

Indeed, Ghost Hand wasn’t a Swordsman but an Assassin instead!

It was just that normally when fighting, Ghost Hand didn’t even need to go into Stealth. Star Rain was enough for him to take care of most of his opponents.

Moreover, Ghost Hand preferred to use a one-handed longsword, which gave others the false impression that he was a Swordsman. After all, many Skills for Assassins required the use of a dagger or a short sword. Not to mention, similar to how most high-ranking longswords would provide bonuses to Swordsman Skills, many high-ranking daggers and short swords would provide bonuses for Assassin Skills.

So, it didn’t make sense for an Assassin to be using a longsword.

However, the longsword Ghost Hand used was different.

Magic Weapon, Thorn of Sins!

This was a longsword that provided bonuses for the Assassin class. Moreover, rather than a longsword, it’d be more accurate to consider it a weapon made up of numerous sharp blades. It could be used to launch numerous sharp projectiles or wielded like a whip or a normal longsword. This allowed Ghost Hand to attack his opponents using various combat styles, making him incredibly unpredictable.

Of course, compared to his weapon, Ghost Hand himself was a much greater threat.

Once Ghost Hand entered Stealth, even experts who had mastered their sixth sense could not perceive his presence. Paired with the Thorn of Sins, Ghost Hand could kill any opponent within 100 yards of him with almost 100% certainty.

While Ghost Hand’s subordinates were talking among themselves, Shi Feng unsheathed the Winter of Eternal Night, not daring to be careless.

Experts who had reached the fifth-floor standard were existences standing at the apex of the Greater God’s Domain. Every one of these experts had their own specialty that they could use to integrate their sixth sense with Skills, Spells, or combat techniques, and by doing so, they could create Absolute Techniques exclusive to themselves. Meanwhile, even fifth-floor experts would be at risk of instant death if they weren’t careful when going up against another fifth-floor expert’s Exclusive Absolute Technique.

To make matters worse, Shi Feng had never heard of Ghost Hand’s name during his previous life.

Among fifth-floor experts, the ones whose names had never been heard were usually regarded as the most dangerous. This was because, unlike well-known fifth-floor experts who had been thoroughly analyzed by others, nobody knew what kind of Exclusive Absolute Techniques these unknown fifth-floor experts could have up their sleeves.

Hence, Shi Feng needed to be very cautious when fighting against the Assassin.

“You should feel honored! You will be the first person I use this next move on!”

While Ghost Hand looked at Shi Feng from Stealth, the Thorn of Sins in his hand transformed into countless invisible petals that silently danced around Shi Feng.
