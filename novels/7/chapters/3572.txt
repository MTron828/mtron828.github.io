Chapter 647 – Challenging the Tier 6 Promotion

Shi Feng grew ecstatic when he saw the magic arrays on the Magic Array Scroll lightning up.

Currently, excluding the 10 million units he had to save, he had less than 15 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystals left to spend. However, if he continued with his experiments, Zero Wing might start to have trouble funding its members’ Tier 6 promotion.

There were many fifth-floor experts in the current Zero Wing, and the Guild’s total member count even exceeded 100,000. However, unlike other Guilds, because Zero Wing’s sphere of activity in the Eternal Realm was limited to the Crystal City of Secrets, it had a very limited income of Seven Luminaries Crystals.

If he were to spend all of Zero Wing’s Seven Luminaries Crystals, the Guild would have difficulties producing Tier 6 players in the foreseeable future.

Fortunately, he had finally achieved success. With over 14 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal remaining, Zero Wing should have no trouble affording its members’ Tier 6 promotion.

Just when Shi Feng was about to officially begin constructing his Divine Body, Hidden Soul suddenly approached him.

“You’re finally done with your work, Guild Leader,” Hidden Soul hurriedly said when she saw that Shi Feng had finally stopped drawing on Magic Array Scrolls. “Had you continued working any longer, I might have had to interrupt you.”

Everyone had been focused on improving their mastery of the magic elements in the past two days. And because everyone’s method of going about doing so was different, Hidden Soul did not dare to disturb Shi Feng for fear of interrupting him at a critical moment and ruining all of his progress.

“Did something happen?” Shi Feng asked when he saw the mix of joy and anxiety on Hidden Soul’s face.

“Yes.” After taking a deep breath, Hidden Soul explained, “Some time ago, Mu Huangwu messaged us saying that Azure Shadow’s group has successfully passed Night Watch City’s test. They even monopolized the top ten positions. But as a result, they became a hot topic in Night Watch City, and quite a few powers have started to look into this situation. Mu Huangwu estimates that it won’t be long before those powers find out about Zero Wing’s involvement.”

“So, they’ve begun investigating already?” Shi Feng wasn’t particularly surprised by this piece of news. Smiling, he said, “Tell Mu Huangwu that he can leak some information. Just say that Zero Wing has sold some Secret Treasures to the Green God Corporation and allowed Azure Shadow’s group to receive a huge boost in strength. Of course, make sure to do this covertly.”

Azure Shadow’s group had experienced meteoric improvements during their training in Zero Wing. It was especially so after they received the Advanced Bronze Mana Purification Technique. Although they weren’t fully equipped with Legendary items, they were already close to rivaling Tier 6 Gods. And if they were to fight against the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ Tier 6 paragons, even if they were inferior to those paragons by one rank in combat standards, so long as those paragons hadn’t learned a Mana Purification Technique yet, they could achieve victory handily.

Fortunately, due to the nature of Secret Treasures improving players’ Mana Protection, they could be used as a cover to explain the abnormal mana strength of Azure Shadow and the others.

As for the matter of Night Watch City’s various powers showing interest in this matter, it was something Shi Feng had long anticipated. It was also something he had hoped would happen.

It hadn’t been long since Zero Wing had established itself in Star Lake City, so the Guild was in urgent need of various resources and Star Coins. While Zero Wing could easily acquire these things if it sold its Secret Treasures to the Eternal Realm’s various powers, Zero Wing would be funding its competition if it did that. It might be fine to sell a small portion, but if the numbers grew too large, Zero Wing’s advantage in the Eternal Realm would diminish significantly.

However, it would be a different story if Zero Wing sold its Secret Treasures to Star Lake City’s neighboring cities. Most of the powers based in these neighboring cities didn’t have any presence in the Eternal Realm. So, it wouldn’t affect Zero Wing’s influence to sell Secret Treasures to these powers. Moreover, if Zero Wing were to sell its Secret Treasures through the Miniature Ancient World, it could sell its Secret Treasures at a high price and avoid getting heavily taxed by trading via the Eternal Chamber of Commerce.

Not to mention, Zero Wing could use these transactions to apply pressure on Silver Frost City, killing two birds with one stone.

“Mhm. I’ll notify Elder Mu,” Hidden Soul said, nodding. “Also, one more thing. The Skylight Association has officially moved into the Crystal City yesterday, and it has recruited five upper-ranking hegemonic powers and twenty-three of the city’s top 30 adventurer teams. Right now, it should have over 300 fifth-floor experts and over 300,000 members under its command. Vice Commander Qilin has advised us to be careful and said that we should avoid the World Ark for the time being.”

“What an extravagant move.” Shi Feng was a little surprised to hear Hidden Soul’s report on the Skylight Association.

The fact that these adventurer teams had agreed to join the Skylight Association must mean that Skylight had offered them a much more irresistible offer. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She was aware of the conflict between Zero Wing and the Skylight Association. Now that the Skylight Association had recruited many experts in the Crystal City, if Zero Wing were to head to the World Ark to develop, a direct confrontation with the Skylight Association would be inevitable.

“Of course we’re going! Why wouldn’t we?” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “The resurrection camps are crucial for development at the World Ark. If we miss this chance, it’ll be difficult for us to catch up in the future. Now that some of our people have already started their Tier 6 promotion, wouldn’t it be a waste not to compete?”

“If that’s the case, I’ll go and get ready,” Hidden Soul said, deciding to challenge her Tier 6 promotion right away.

Currently, she had already mastered two Basic Laws thanks to the Medium World Fragment’s help. Originally, she had planned to master a third Basic Law before challenging her Tier 6 promotion. That way, she could construct an Epic Divine Body with 100% certainty. But for the sake of the World Ark, she decided not to delay her Tier 6 promotion any longer.

The Medium World Fragment’s effects were admittedly astonishing, but it only allowed players to tap into the potential they had accumulated over time and achieve rapid growth. Once players exhausted their untapped potential, their growth would slow down significantly, and they would need significantly more time to achieve any notable growth. However, the current Eternal Realm was overflowing with opportunities, and time was an incredibly precious resource. If she were to delay her Tier 6 promotion for too long, she would miss out on many of these opportunities, effectively putting the cart before the horse.

“Okay, you go and do that,” Shi Feng said, not bothering to dissuade Hidden Soul from her decision. After all, he was fully aware that reaching Tier 6 was just the beginning.

After Hidden Soul took her leave, Shi Feng took out an Eternal God Crystal and absorbed it without hesitation. Then, he took out the Primordial Dragon Legacy Crystal he had obtained from Kalisha.

Whether I succeed or fail, it all comes down to this!

After taking one last look at the completed Divine Body Magic Array, Shi Feng injected 100 Eternal God Crystals into the Primordial Dragon Legacy Crystal.
