Chapter 83 – Zero Wing?

Meanwhile, outside the Ancient Demon Court, chaos had ensued.

Not long ago, the Glory Tablet outside the Ancient Demon Court had suddenly displayed that Shi Feng’s team had cleared the Hell Mode Ancient Demon Court, the tablet listing the names of the players on the team and the Guild the team was affiliated to. Meanwhile, everyone outside the Ancient Demon Court momentarily fell silent upon seeing these names.

“Zero Wing? What is this Guild? Why have I never heard of it?”

“Don’t tell me it’s the new Guild Su Qianliu’s adventurer team joined?”

“That’s Hell Mode we are talking about! How can a new Guild clear it?! Could it be a bug?”

The many experts present couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw the name of the Guild displayed on the Glory Tablet.

With their team’s strength, even clearing Normal Mode is going to be a challenge, so how did they manage to clear Hell Mode? Could it be that the Ancient Demon Court’s Hell Mode is only a front? Rain Song wondered as she looked at the pitch-black skull hovering above the entrance portal.

Su Qianliu might have been a Tier 4 expert on the main continent, and her adventurer team might have four or more Refinement Realm experts, but such a team line-up was nothing compared to the various first-rate Guilds’ main force. If even first-rate Guilds like Hundred Flower Palace and Nature Hall needed to work together to raid an Ancient Demon Court, there was no way Su Qianliu’s team could raid it successfully.

Yet, not only did this insignificant team clear the Ancient Demon Court, but it had also done it on the Hell Mode difficulty. This situation was akin to a mockery of their two Guilds’ inability and foolishness…

“Big Sis Rue, do you think that we might have misunderstood the Miniature Ancient World’s Ancient Demon Courts?” Rain Song asked, voicing her confusion to Cleansed Rue. “Could it be that the Ancient Demon Courts here are much easier than we believed them to be?”

“We can’t exclude that possibility.”

Cleansed Rue was also feeling a little dazed as she looked at the Glory Tablet. She had never expected such an outcome, and she couldn’t help but regret her decision to remain outside.

Setting aside the Hell Mode Ancient Demon Court’s actual difficulty, just the fact that Su Qianliu’s team had managed to clear it was undoubtedly a slap to their two Guilds’ faces.

To make matters worse, they had lost the Ancient Demon Court to an unrated Guild under a situation where they had mobilized their best experts. If news of this situation got out, their two Guilds would become a joke in God’s Domain.

Had she known this would happen, she wouldn’t have wasted time waiting for reinforcements outside. Instead, she would’ve entered the Ancient Demon Court with One-eyed Ghost immediately after Su Qianliu’s team entered it.

“Alright, what’s done is done. There’s no use for regrets,” Crimson Heart, clad in her sacred white armor, said when she saw Cleansed Rue’s regretful expression. “As a Vice Guild Leader, the first thing you should do isn’t to regret, but to figure out how you can make up for your mistakes!”

“Vice Guild Leader Crimson is correct,” One-eyed Ghost, who was standing some distance away, said when he heard Crimson Heart’s words. Then, he revealed a cold smile as he continued, “I have indeed underestimated Su Qianliu’s new Guild. However, this is the end of the line for them. I will let them know how foolish their actions are!”

The team led by one of the Eight Sword Meisters had actually gotten toyed by a no-name Guild. If news of this got out, he would absolutely become a laughingstock. The only way he could salvage this situation now was to kill every member on Su Qianliu’s team, take back what was rightfully his, and make the other side into the laughingstock instead!

“Well said! It’s been a while since I’ve encountered such interesting people. We must take good care of these people and make sure they learn that there are some things that they can’t simply lay their hands on!” Stalwart Bear said, nodding in agreement with One-eyed Ghost’s words. Then, he looked toward Crimson Heart and said, “Crazy woman, my suggestion is for us to use our Guild War Orders and kill them until they delete their accounts! What do you think?”

The Guild War Order was a privilege afforded to all Guilds, and it could be used to lock down an entire map. However, the Guild War Order had limited duration and a considerably long Cooldown. If they wanted to lock down a map for a considerable period, they would need to use at least two Guild War Orders.

“Okay,” Crimson Heart agreed without hesitation.

“Do you think Su Qianliu lost her mind, Big Sis Rue?” When Rain Song saw Crimson Heart and Stalwart Bear agreeing with each other to use their Guild War Orders, she couldn’t help but pity Su Qianliu and her team. “Had she raided with us, she could’ve more or less acquired some benefits. Yet, she chose to monopolize the Ancient Demon Court right in front of our faces…”

The Guild War Order was different from magic barriers used to seal maps. Apart from prohibiting teleportation inside the targeted map, the Guild War Order also prevented players from logging out of the game while inside the map. Players would have to walk out of the affected region before going offline. Otherwise, even if players forcibly logged out of the game, their characters would remain in God’s Domain, and they could still be resurrected, killed, lose items upon death. Moreover, the item drop-rate after death would be extremely high.

Thus, the Guild War Order could be considered the biggest trump card of the various Guilds in God’s Domain. Unless conflict between two Guilds had escalated to an unsalvageable point, Guilds wouldn’t typically make use of their Guild War Order.

Now that Crimson Heart and Stalwart Bear had decided to use Hundred Flower Palace’s and Nature Hall’s Guild War Orders, one could see just how angry the two of them were.

“…”

Cleansed Rue remained silent in response to Rain Song’s question. This was because she couldn’t understand why Su Qianliu would make such a foolish decision, either. Did Su Qianliu really think that her small team could go against their two Guilds? Or was she so foolish that she had never considered these problems? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, their two Guilds had long since made it clear how much importance they placed on the Ancient Demon Court.

Moreover, since Su Qianliu had already told them the Ancient Demon Court’s location, her only option was to cooperate. Trying to monopolize the Ancient Demon Court in such a situation was simply foolish. It might be fine if she had failed to monopolize the Ancient Demon Court, but if she succeeded, what she had to face next was the wrath of their two Guilds.

Meanwhile, the wrath of two top-tier first-rate Guilds wasn’t something a newly-established Guild could endure. Faced with such a situation, there would only be one outcome for the new Guild—annihilation! Complete and utter annihilation!

Yet, for some inexplicable reason, Su Qianliu had done exactly that. She had given up on cooperating with their two Guilds without hesitation and cleared the Ancient Demon Court in front of them…

Of course, there was another possibility, and that was the fact that Su Qianliu had never cared about what their two Guilds thought since the very beginning.

However, in Cleansed Rue’s opinion, the likelihood of that being the case was minuscule.

While Cleansed Rue was immersed in her thoughts, an energy ripple suddenly spread from Stalwart Bear. The energy ripple spread across a massive area, spreading all the way to Rock Devil City and covering nearly half of the city.

“A Guild War Order?! What’s going on?!”

“The notification says this is Nature Hall’s Guild War Order. Is Nature Hall declaring an all-out war against another Guild?”

“Investigate! Find out which power Nature Hall is trying to target immediately!”

The activation of Nature Hall’s Guild War Order immediately stirred the various powers based in Rock Devil City, everyone’s reactions ranging from curious to fearful. They were curious to find out which power had provoked Nature Hall to a point where the top-tier first-rate Guild had used its Guild War Order, and they were fearful that this Guild War Order might be targeted at them.

Hence, the various powers based on Rock Devil City promptly dispatched a large amount of manpower to look into the situation.

Meanwhile, around 20 minutes after Nature Hall activated its Guild War Order, flashes of light suddenly appeared in front of the Ancient Demon Court’s entrance portal one after another.

In the blink of an eye, a team of nearly 300 players had appeared in front of Hundred Flower Palace’s and Nature Hall’s members.
