Chapter 2380 – Tier 3 Team

Many players waited in Zero Wing’s Residence for their turn to take the recruitment test, making the Residence quite lively. Because of the commotion, no one noticed the two dozen cloaked Zero Wing members’ arrival.

At this point, seeing Zero Wings leave or enter the Residence in their cloaks had become the norm. Starlink’s bounty was no trivial matter, and for poorer experts, killing Zero Wing’s members for a quick buck was easy.

Zero Wing’s members could only avoid hostile players by hiding their identities with Black Cloaks, and to enter the Guild Residences, they only needed to reveal their Guild Emblems to the members that guarded the entrances. Many of Zero Wing’s members had begun to take these precautions recently.

However, unlike most of the Guild’s players, these cloaked players didn’t stop to rest in the lounge or visit the quest area. They made their way straight to the Guild Leader’s office, where Shi Feng had been waiting for a while.

Once they entered the office, the two dozen players removed their cloaks and revealed themselves. As they did, violent, scorching auras filled the room. Their combined auras could paralyze Tier 2 experts with fear.

“What do you think, Guild Leader? We’re much stronger than before, aren’t we?” Cola boasted as he radiated dense mana.

“Guild Leader, don’t listen to him. He was the last of us to complete his Promotion Quest. He just got lucky and constructed an Advanced Gold Mana Body with an 80% Completion Rate,” Shadow Sword said.

“Hey, I’m satisfied with that! At least my Mana Body is better than yours! I’m happy enough to squeeze into the eighth place on the team!” Cola said joyfully.

Before they had left to challenge their Tier 3 Promotion Quests, Shi Feng had informed them of the importance of their Mana Body and told them that they should try as hard as they could to earn a Gold Mana Body. Shi Feng had also offered tips about the Mana Body’s construction process.

Initially, Cola had only aimed to construct an Intermediate Gold Mana Body with an 85% Completion Rate, but during his second try, he had been inspired and constructed an Advanced Gold Mana Body.

Of their group, only ten people had completed an Advanced Gold Mana Body with a 75% Completion Rate or higher. Although the difference was only one rank, the difference between their Stamina and Concentration recovery rates was significant. An Advanced Gold Mana Body would be immensely helpful to them in the future.

“An Advanced Gold Mana Body with an 80% Completion Rate?” Shi Feng was surprised by Cola’s achievement.

Compared to magical class players, physical class players were at a disadvantage when constructing their Mana Bodies. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although Cola’s combat standards were considerable, he was only averagely talented among Zero Wing’s main force members. If not for his Fragmented Legendary Shield, he wouldn’t have even ranked among the top 15 in the main force with his combat power.

Moreover, Shi Feng had heard about the Tyrant Bear Cola’s Mana Body during his previous life. At the time, Cola had only had a Basic Gold Mana Body with a 78% Completion Rate, yet he had still managed to shake Star-Moon Kingdom, becoming one of its top-ranked MTs.

Now that Cola had an Advanced Gold Mana Body with an 80% Completion Rate, his future strength would undergo a qualitative improvement.

“Cola’s Mana Body is nothing, Guild Leader. Boss Tianxing and Big Sis Yi are even more amazing. Boss Tianxing constructed a 93% Peak Gold Mana Body, and Big Sis Yi constructed a 95% Peak Gold Mana Body. Their Stamina and Concentration recovery rates are ridiculous,” Turtledove interjected.

Originally, Turtledove had been relatively proud of constructing an Advanced Gold Mana Body. After all, Shi Feng had told them that the difference between Intermediate and Advanced rank was considerable.

However, Yan Tianxing, Yi Luofei, Zhao Yueru, Silent Blade, Alluring Summer, and Youlan were so much more powerful. Every one of them had successfully constructed a Peak Gold Mana Body. Moreover, the weakest among them had an 80% Completion Rate. Since Stubborn Bone, who ranked seventh among them, hadn’t been able to construct a Peak Gold Mana Body with an 80% completion or higher, he had settled for an 89% Advanced Gold Mana Body as he ran out of time.

Compared to the top seven players, Cola’s achievement was nothing.

While the team bickered, Shi Feng received a compilation of their promotion results.

He was shocked when he examined the data. Of the 24 players that had completed their Tier 3 Promotion quests, the weakest of them had constructed an 80% Peak Silver Mana Body. Not even the superpowers of his past had dreamed of such wonderful results.

In the past, the majority of the various superpowers’ experts had been fortunate to construct an Intermediate or Advanced Silver Mana Body. Second- and third-rate Guilds had thrown massive celebrations of any of their experts had constructed a Silver Mana Body at all. A Silver Mana Body was the minimum requirement for players to reach Tier 4 or higher, after all.

Not even experts from ordinary Guilds had dared to dream of acquiring a Gold Mana Body. In fact, players with Gold Mana Bodies were even quite rare in the various superpowers. Every additional expert with a Gold Mana Body had significantly elevated a superpower’s status The advantages of a Gold Mana Body when exploring Level 100-plus neutral maps were that massive.

And yet, of the 24 Zero Wing members that completed their Tier 3 Promotion Quests, 19 had constructed Gold Mana Bodies...

“Guild Leader, we haven’t had the opportunity to test out our new bodies, so I suggest we head to the Battle Arena.”

“I agree. My body feels too strong. It feels a little strange to move. Since we’ve already completed our Promotion Quests, we should spar with each other to get a feel of our new strength.”

They had been too busy celebrating their success that they hadn’t bothered to test their new strength. They hadn’t had any good places to do so, either. However, since so many Tier 3 players were here, it was a good opportunity to learn what they could do.

You want to test your new strength?” Chuckling, Shi Feng said, “Alright, it’s simple then. Plenty of superpowers want a piece of our Stone Forest City right now, and Starlink has sent a large number of experts to the Cold Spring Forest. You guys can go and test your strength there, and while you’re at it, inform Starlink’s people that they have no place in the Cold Spring Forest.”

Even after finding out that Cola and the others had completed their Tier 3 Promotion Quests, Shi Feng had still worried that they didn’t have enough players to deal with Starlink’s forces. Initially, he had planned to mobilize the Knight Division to teach Starlink a lesson and warn the other superpowers against trying to steal Stone Forest City.

However, it seemed that he could save Zero Wing’s final trump card. With the superior Mana Bodies Cola and his companions had constructed, they could move through the Cold Spring Forest unobstructed.

“Starlink?”

“Wonderful! I’ve been itching to practice some of the combat techniques I haven’t fully mastered yet. Starlink’s peak

experts should be excellent practice partners!”

Shi Feng’s decision excited the entire team. Although fighting a bunch of Tier 2 experts wouldn’t help them properly gauge their new strength, they could use this opportunity to test the effects of their Tier 3 Mana Bodies in a Level 100 neutral map.

The two dozen main force members then resupplied and repaired their equipment in White River City before teleporting to Stone Forest City.
