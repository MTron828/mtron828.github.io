Chapter 2822 – Pinnacle of God’s Domain

“A Sky Fortress?! What’s going on!?”

“This is a lie! This is definitely a lie! How can such a thing appear at this stage of the game?!”

“There are pictures and videos of it. I heard that the fortress’s interior is a paradise for training. It even provides a significant boost to Mana affinity.” “Zero Wing is really on the rise now!”

When news regarding the Small Mobile Fortress first broke out in the Twin Towers Kingdom, many people refused to believe it. After all, no matter how they thought about it, they simply couldn’t see how Zero Wing could come to possess such a mythical fortress. However, the information leak came with photographic and video evidence; even if everyone refused to believe the report, they couldn’t change the fact that Zero Wing owned a flying fortress.

The leaked videos showed a fortress hundreds of meters tall, covered in all kinds of magic runes, hovering in the sky above the Secret Covenant Tower. A faint layer of mist enveloped the fortress. From afar, it looked like a city found in paradise. No words could describe how spectacular the fortress was.

“This Sky Fortress looks so cool! The view from up there will definitely be amazing!”

“When will this Sky Fortress be open to the public?”

“I heard Zero Wing is limiting entry to its members and allies. I doubt anyone else will have the chance to visit the fortress. After all, it isn’t particularly large. It should house one or two million people at most. Moreover, it is even being used to garrison the Secret Covenant Tower. Zero Wing isn’t letting any outsiders get close to the tower now, let alone the Sky Fortress.”

“I’m joining Zero Wing! I must join Zero Wing!”

The Twin Towers Kingdom’s players, both independent and Guild members, couldn’t help drooling when they saw the Sky Fortress above the Secret Covenant Tower. Many independent players immediately thought of joining Zero

Wing.

The fight in Sky Spring City had already proven that Zero Wing, Unyielding Soul, and Crimson Emperor’s rule over the city and the Secret Covenant Tower was unshakable. Zero Wing even revealed that it had five Tier 4 players, far surpassing the various superpowers. The addition of the Sky Fortress basically solidified Zero Wing’s hold over the Secret Covenant Tower. Now, it would be utterly impossible for the various superpowers to compete with Zero Wing when it came to providing their members with an excellent leveling spot. For a time, the number of players visiting Zero Wing’s Residences to apply for Guild membership skyrocketed. The atmosphere within Zero Wing was also boiling, with many members celebrating the fact that they had not rashly quit the Guild.

Meanwhile, Unyielding Heart and Illusory Words arrived in front of the Secret Covenant Tower together with a bunch of Tier 3 experts. When they saw the Mobile Fortress floating above the tower, despite having long known about the fortress, they were still shocked. After all, the Mobile Fortress was simply too overwhelming! Tier 3 players might not be able to tell, but as Tier 4 players, the two of them could clearly feel that all the Mana within a 10,000-yard radius had converged upon the fortress. This was an unimaginable amount of Mana.

Most importantly, the Mobile Fortress was capable of movement. Just this point alone made it invincible. After all, if the fortress faced an insurmountable opponent in a certain location, it could simply transfer elsewhere.

“With this Mobile Fortress, Zero Wing has truly reached the pinnacle of God’s Domain,” Unyielding Heart said enviously as he looked at the Mobile Fortress. He couldn’t help sighing ruefully.

Back when he first learned of Zero Wing’s existence, Zero Wing had only been a small Guild. Now, even Unyielding Soul had to look up to it.

Of course, Zero Wing’s foundation was still weak. However, so long as the Guild could maintain its hold over the Secret Covenant Tower, its rise would be inevitable.

Nodding in agreement with Unyielding Heart’s words, Illusory Words said, “Although I don’t know whether we can successfully defend the Secret Covenant Tower, even if we fail, it wouldn’t affect Zero Wing by much. With this Mobile Fortress, Zero Wing can simply set up shop in a Level 130 map. At that time, the leveling speed of its members wouldn’t be in any way inferior to grinding in the tower. They just wouldn’t be able to produce Tier 3 players as quickly as before.”

Previously, Zero Wing could be described as a ferocious tiger. While it was incredibly strong in one-on-one combat, it was still vulnerable against multiple strong opponents. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, after gaining the Mobile Fortress, Zero Wing had become a behemoth that no superpower could threaten. Even economic suppression would no longer be effective against it. “Let’s hurry inside.” Looking at the time, Unyielding Heart said, “The Faux Saint army should arrive in just a few more hours.”

“Mhm. If we can defend the tower, our two Guilds might be able to contest with those Super Guilds,” Illusory Words said, glancing at the Secret Covenant Tower behind her. She then led her subordinates into the Mobile Fortress.

While the three Guilds’ Tier 3 experts were entering the Mobile Fortress one after another, the distant Faux Saint army was steadily making its way to the Secret Covenant Tower. Throughout its march, the army continuously devoured the players and NPCs it came across, adding to its numbers.

“Lord Beast Emperor, will we have any problems with the Mobile Fortress Zero Wing brought out?” Lu Xingluo asked worriedly as he looked at Beast Emperor. “According to reports, more than 40,000 Tier 3 players have also gathered in the fortress.”

The fight in Sky Spring City had gutted Starlink’s combat power; the Guild would take a long time to recover from this loss. If he failed to secure the Secret Covenant Tower this time, he would most likely have to lie low for some time. Someone might even replace him as Starlink’s Guild Leader.

He had a very good understanding of that old undead’s personality. That person definitely wouldn’t let him remain as Starlink’s Guild Leader simply because he was the heir of a major corporation. After all, the only reason Hundred Ghosts was even willing to partner with Starlink was that old undead. It had nothing to do with him at all.

Meanwhile, the defensive capabilities of a fortress far surpassed those of a Guild City. Zero Wing’s Mobile Fortress definitely wouldn’t have any problems defending against the attacks of Tier 4 Mythic monsters.

“Relax. This Mobile Fortress might pose a problem for other people since it is floating in the sky, but you shouldn’t forget that Mythic ranked Faux Saint monsters can fly. They are walking now only because they need to protect the Great Lords and Grand Lords,” Beast Emperor replied nonchalantly. “A fortress might be capable of blocking the attacks of Mythic monsters, but doing so should still consume a large amount of Mana. How long do you think a fortress can last against the bombardment of a thousand Mythic monsters?”

If they had only several dozen Mythic monsters, they would indeed be helpless against a fortress. After all, the attacks of Mythic monsters couldn’t exceed the defensive threshold of a fortress’s defensive magic array. However, 1,000 Mythic monsters would be a different story. The attack of each Mythic monster might deplete only a small portion of the defensive magic array’s Mana, but when multiplied by 1,000, even a Main City’s defensive magic array wouldn’t last very long.

“Yes, you’re right. Who can possibly go up against 1,000 Mythic monsters?” Lu Xingluo regained his confidence when he looked at the Mythic ranked Faux Saint monsters marching on the ground below.

A fortress might be amazing, but there was also strength in numbers!

After saying so, Lu Xingluo looked at the giant serpent flying nearby, a cold glint appearing in his eyes.

Hundred Ghosts’s Ancient Demonic Serpent was an extraordinary existence. Not only was the Flying Mount itself at the Tier 4 Mythic standard, but it was also a Legendary Flying Mount, one of the rulers of the sky during ancient times. According to rumors, the strength of the Ancient Demonic Serpent’s Bloodline was close to rivaling that of Dragons. In air combat, the combat power it could display surpassed even that of a Flying Ship. Hence, their side wouldn’t necessarily lose to Zero Wing’s Mobile Fortress in air combat. Time passed quickly. After traveling for another six hours, Lu Xingluo and Beast Emperor saw a gigantic, floating fortress on the distant horizon.

“So, that is the Mobile Fortress?” Beast Emperor was a little surprised when he first laid eyes on the Mobile Fortress. Afterward, though, a smirk appeared on his face. “Black Flame, I admit that you are indeed capable. However, I wonder if you’ll go mad if I destroy this fortress of yours?”

After saying so, Beast Emperor gestured with his hand. In response, his army’s 1,000 Mythic ranked Faux Saint Saboteurs[1] took to the skies and flew straight toward the Mobile Fortress. Their speed in the air was just slightly inferior to that of Flying Mounts, and they gave Zero Wing’s side no time to react whatsoever.
