Chapter 380 - Destroyer of Immortality

“They won’t help me even if I offer each of them a Fragmented Legendary item?” Shi Feng was taken aback.

He did not think Sharlyn was lying.

He had personally witnessed how extraordinary the Sword in the Stone was. Even Sharlyn, a Tier 4 Great Divine Official, could not uncover its secrets. Meanwhile, he had only obtained the Golden Stigmata due to luck. Otherwise, he would have never known that the Sword in the Stone was a Legacy Item.

Fortunately, I made the trip here. Otherwise, I would have missed my chance. Shi Feng inwardly celebrated his luck as he looked at the Sword in the Stone.

Originally, Shi Feng had thought he only needed to hire three Tier 4 NPCs to help him. Now, it would seem that even if he found three Tier 4 NPC powerhouses, there was no price he could pay to gain their help.

Based on Sharlyn had said, however, even if he could afford the price, he still couldn’t awaken the power within the Sword in the Stone.

“Alright, let’s begin. I, too, want to see just what sort of item this is. Little dummy, stand back.”

Sharlyn was greatly interested in the Sword in the Stone right now. After saying so, Sharlyn tossed the 21 Mana Stones into the air and started chanting an incantation. The 21 Mana Stones suddenly split up and flew in all directions. Fortunately, Sharlyn’s room was sufficiently large. After the Mana Stones flew 20 yards, they immediately stopped, hovering in the air. The Mana Stones then started to spin slowly. In the next moment, silvery-white light shone from under their feet.

Shi Feng immediately distanced himself from the magic array that appeared, watching silently from afar.

As the 21 floating Mana Stones rotated, the Sword in the Stone hovered in the center of the magic array.

Sharlyn then shouted. Suffocatingly dense Mana filled the room, buzzing.

As if unable to withstand this immense pressure, the 21 Mana Stones immediately shattered into dust, forming clouds of gray smoke that flowed into the Sword in the Stone.

When the Sword in the Stone completely absorbed one of the Mana Stones, the Legacy Item emitted a thumping sound that resembled a heartbeat.

Shi Feng even wondered if his ears were playing tricks on him at first.

However, as more Mana Stones fused with the sword, the thumping became much louder and more powerful. It was as if the disintegrated Mana Stones were waking an ancient beast from its deep slumber.

However, as Mana Stones continued to drift into the sword, Sharlyn, who currently stood inside the magic array, grew weaker.

By the time the seventh Mana Stone fused with the sword, Shi Feng could clearly feel that only half of the terrifying Mana that filled the room remained. At this moment, Sharlyn had also greatly weakened. As the fourteenth Mana Stone melded with the sword, Sharlyn began to grow pale. When the twenty-first and last Mana Stone fused with the sword, Sharlyn wavered. A gentle breeze could send her tumbling to the floor.

At this moment, Shi Feng finally realized that it was not easy to awaken the Sword in the Stone.

Channeling a single magic array had weakened a Tier 4 powerhouse to such a degree. It was no wonder why Sharlyn had said that no Tier 4 powerhouse would agree to aid him, even if offered a Fragmented Legendary item.

Sharlyn’s power stunned Shi Feng.

She had managed to complete a task that required three Tier 4 classes. Her strength was simply too frightening.

Just who is she? Shi Feng grew curious about Sharlyn’s identity.

It was impossible for an ordinary NPC to grow so quickly. Moreover, back in the God’s Grave, Shi Feng saw a woman who looked exactly like Sharlyn. Although Sharlyn’s strength could not compete with that slumbering woman’s, the aura the two gave off felt exactly the same; the intensity was the only difference.

While Shi Feng pondered Sharlyn’s identity, the awakening ritual had come to an end. The silver magic array that covered the floor vanished.

Boom!

The Sword in the Stone hovering in the air suddenly fell, half its blade sinking into the floor.

“Sharp!”

Sharlyn, who was currently unstable from the drain of Mana, could not hold back her shock when she saw the blade slide smoothly into the floor.

Not even the Great Destruction had managed to destroy the Stargazing Tower. The strongest and highest quality materials had gone into this monument’s construction. Magic arrays reinforced the building further. A full-powered blow from a Tier 4 Sword Emperor armed with a Legendary ranked sword could not even scratch the floor. Yet, the hovering Sword in the Stone sunk effortlessly into the wood.

By now, the transparent crystal encasing the sword had completely disappeared. Only a sword with a golden hilt and guard remained, with a blade that was as pure and clear as a diamond.

“Impossible! This is actually... the Destroyer of Immortality!” Sharlyn was tongue-tied when she read the Sword in the Stone’s information, which was now fully visible.

[Destroyer of Immortality]

A creation born of nature, containing unrivaled power. Although it was greatly damaged during the war between the Ancient Gods, it had absorbed some of their powers. If one can master this blade, they will obtain a trace of the Ancient Gods’ powers.

Class restriction: Berserker and Swordsman

“Destroyer of Immortality?” Shi Feng was puzzled. He had never heard this name before.

Reading the item’s introduction, apparently, its origin was quite amazing. The Ancient Gods had actually used this weapon.

Shi Feng knew a little about the Ancient Gods.

The Ancient Gods were born from nature, and they had the power to decimate the heaven and earth. Even the Tier 6 god-ranked classes of God’s Domain were no more than ants before an Ancient God. They were practically invincible. However, all of these Ancient Gods had perished in the Great Ancient War.

“You must have heaven-defying luck. It is no wonder you didn’t want an Advanced Legacy.” Sharlyn smiled. She then explained, “The Destroyer of Immortality is one of the Ten Great Saint Legacy Items in ancient records. Moreover, the Legacy is unique; not even the Peak Legacy of the Stargazing Tower can compete with it.”

“Ten Great Saint Legacies?” Shi Feng was at a loss.

The highest Legacies he had heard of in the past were Peak Legacies. This was the first time he had heard of the Ten Great Saint Legacies.

“I, too, have only read about the Ten Great Saint Legacies. Today is my first time actually seeing one in person. However, I don’t know any details about them. Even so, I will remind you not to look down on these Saint Legacies.

“A Peak Legacy is already as difficult as a Legendary Quest. At the very least, the trial of Ten Great Saint Legacies should be just as difficult. If you are not confident in succeeding, you should not recklessly attempt to challenge it. You might lose your life, even if you are a heaven-blessed individual.”

Sharlyn was extraordinarily serious when she looked at Shi Feng, even more serious than when she gave the “Immortal Crown” quest to Shi Feng. When she spoke of death, she had even paused for a moment.

Shi Feng could clearly discern the kindness in Sharlyn’s tone, and he, too, knew how dangerous and difficult the trial of a Saint Legacy would be.

God’s Domain’s law of equivalent exchange held true everywhere.

Naturally, there was danger in challenging the trial of a Legacy. Take Basic Legacies for example. If a player failed to clear the trial of a Basic Legacy, they would lose three levels, be weakened for three days, and be barred from accepting the trial again for ten days.

Meanwhile, the penalty for failing an Intermediate Legacy was much harsher. Players would lose five levels, be weakened for seven days, be barred from accepting the trial for twenty days, and permanently lose a small portion of their Attributes.

For Advanced Legacies and Peak Legacies....

Shi Feng was 90% certain that he could complete an Advanced Legacy. As for a Peak Legacy, Shi Feng had around 50% to 60% certainty of success. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, the Legacy he had eagerly looked forward to turned out to be one of the Ten Great Saint Legacies. Shi Feng had never even heard of a Saint Legacy, so he was not too sure how well he would fare.
