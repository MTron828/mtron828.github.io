Chapter 400 – All Are Ants Beneath Tier 6

The arena fell silent when everyone saw Chen Qilin stumbling to the edge of the ring.

“Vice Commander Qilin lost the exchange?”

“What did that Shi Feng guy do?”

Everyone’s eyes bulged as they looked at Shi Feng quietly standing in the middle of the ring.

!!

Everyone had gotten a clear look at the exchange that had taken place in the ring.

One slash!

Although they didn’t know how many strikes Chen Qilin launched, they were certain that Shi Feng had executed only one slash. Moreover, it was a simple slash that did not have any techniques applied to it. It was a common attack that ordinary players would use most often.

Is Big Brother deliberately making it easy for him? Chen Qitian wondered to himself as he looked at Chen Qilin in the ring. The only reason he could use to explain what just happened was that Chen Qilin had been holding back his strength. Otherwise, there was no way Shi Feng, who wasn’t even a mental strength grandmaster, could repulse Chen Qilin, who was equipped with the Demon God’s Armor and a bunch of Fragmented Legendary items. Not to mention, Shi Feng had accomplished this feat using nothing but a normal attack.

It should be known that Chen Qilin’s equipment allowed his Basic Attributes to match a well-equipped Tier 5 Berserker in Basic Attributes.

It might have been possible for Shi Feng to repulse Chen Qilin if he had used an astounding combat technique or heaven-defying Skill, but a normal attack? Under normal circumstances, Shi Feng would have been sent flying out of the ring the instant their weapons touched.

…

In the simulation ring…

After taking a deep breath, Chen Qilin put on a serious expression as he looked at Shi Feng and raised his greatsword.

Unlike the spectators outside the simulation ring, Chen Qilin was aware of what Shi Feng had done. Shi Feng had accurately read the movement of his arms and took advantage of this knowledge by striking him during one of the brief instances where his arms were relaxed after they had just finished executing a swinging motion.

“It seems I’ve underestimated you, Shi Feng. I didn’t think you could catch such a small detail. However, I won’t let you replicate this miracle a second time!”

After saying so, Chen Qilin suddenly transformed the greatsword in his hands into a pillar of light and sent it smashing into Shi Feng.

Mana Technique, Dawn Sword!

This was an attack without any fancy movements. The only thing this attack had was absolute destructive power. It was an attack that could turn the entire simulation ring into a desolate wasteland.

“As expected of Vice Commander Qilin. It seems he was indeed trying to let the rookie preserve some of his dignity.”

“I see! I get it now! I was nearly fooled by Vice Commander Qilin’s acting skills for a second there!”

“It seems even Vice Commander Qilin doesn’t dare to go overboard in his actions. But I guess that makes sense. We are talking about the top ranker of this year’s rookies, after all. The commander even appointed him to be the first to take the test. Vice Commander Qilin would make the commander look bad if he eliminated the rookie on the first move.”

…

When the peanut gallery saw Chen Qilin using his trademark move, aside from being stunned by Chen Qilin’s prowess, they also quickly concluded that Chen Qilin was merely acting when he got sent stumbling to the edge of the ring.

After all, Red Frost had taken the initiative to appoint Shi Feng as the first examinee for her test. Had Chen Qilin eliminated Shi Feng on the first move, it would be no different than slapping Red Frost across the face.

However, it’d be a different story if Chen Qilin deliberately lost the first move to Shi Feng, offered Shi Feng some words of praise, and then eliminated Shi Feng on the second move.

If that were the case, Shi Feng’s defeat could be announced to the public as “This year’s top rookie remains standing even after receiving one move from the Star Lake Legion’s Vice Commander Chen Qilin.” Such an achievement could allow Shi Feng’s fame in Star Lake City to skyrocket.

At this time, Thousand Scars and Death Omen also bought into the peanut gallery’s reasoning, looks of realization appearing on them.

It was clear to them that Chen Qilin possessed astonishing strength. He even used to be a strong contender for the position of the Star Lake Legion’s commander. So, Thousand Scars and Death Omen were greatly shocked when they saw Shi Feng repulsing Chen Qilin.

However, after hearing that Chen Qilin was most likely acting, Thousand Scars and Death Omen couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

The fact that Zero Wing had an expert like Black Flame was already plenty astonishing. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

If, on top of that, Zero Wing had an Acting Guild Leader who could win against someone of Chen Qilin’s caliber, Zero Wing would have no trouble rising in the Greater World.

…

When everyone thought the simulation warfare was about to end, Shi Feng suddenly split into two copies of himself: one stood in the middle of the ring, while the other stood behind Chen Qilin.

“If the first time is a miracle, what about the second time?” the Shi Feng standing behind Chen Qilin asked, revealing a faint smile as he pierced Chen Qilin’s heart with his carbonized longsword.

An afterimage?!

Chen Qilin’s eyes widened in shock when he saw the Shi Feng in the middle of the stage gradually fading away.

Formless Steps!

It was one of the most basic footwork in God’s Domain.

Normally, expert players would use this footwork to toy with beginners, and anyone who had reached the Domain Realm could easily see through it. Yet, he had failed to realize that the person standing in front of him all this time was actually nothing more than an afterimage?

“Your reaction speed surpasses mine? Are you a monster?”

Whilst his body was collapsing onto the ring, Chen Qilin turned around to look at Shi Feng in confusion. As a Beyond Domain Realm expert, the only way Shi Feng could fool him using Formless Steps was if Shi Feng’s reaction speed surpassed his.

But how could a Tier 4 player possibly have such reaction speed?

“It seems you’re not entirely ignorant,” Shi Feng said as he sheathed the Shadow Incinerator.

Chen Qilin was indeed strong. Not just in equipment standards but also in combat standards. Shi Feng would have been in for a tough fight if it was before obtaining the Shadow Incinerator.

Unfortunately for Chen Qilin, after obtaining the Shadow Incinerator, Shi Feng could push his Concentration standard to Tier 6, even without upgrading the Winter of Eternal Night to the Legendary rank. Hence, even though his Basic Attributes in the simulation warfare remained at the Tier 4 standard, his reaction speed had already reached the Tier 5 standard.

In addition, Shi Feng’s powerful Concentration allowed him to perceive everything around him perfectly, which naturally included Chen Qilin’s movements. So, he took advantage of the instant Chen Qilin had relaxed his mind to quietly appear behind the other party.

Of course, while all this seemed miraculous to Chen Qilin, it was a different story for the spectators outside the ring. From the spectators’ perspective, they only saw Shi Feng executing Formless Steps to quickly arrive behind Chen Qilin and land a strike. Meanwhile, Chen Qilin stood still like a wooden block throughout this time.

This was the might of Tier 6 existences!

Unless players reached Tier 6 in their Concentration, they couldn’t keep anything,, not even their mental states, a secret from a Tier 6 existence. Depending on the Tier 6 existence’s strength, they might not even need to execute any physical or magical attacks to kill existences beneath Tier 6. Instead, they could simply launch mental attacks, such as Divine Might, to give players below Tier 6 a mental death.

Meanwhile, after Chen Qilin collapsed under Shi Feng’s sword, the whole arena suddenly fell deathly silent as everyone stared at Chen Qilin’s corpse in disbelief. Particularly, Chen Qitian, who was about to celebrate his elder brother’s victory, had his jaw fall wide open.

Chen Qilin lost!

The Star Lake Legion’s unofficial First Vice Commander lost!
