Chapter 11 - Black Steel Beer

After leaving Red Leaf Town...

Shi Feng brought Blackie along as they headed straight towards Dark Moon Valley.

“Brother Feng, we’re on the path towards Dark Moon Valley. That’s a Level 4 monster area. Can’t we choose a safer place?” Seeing that Shi Feng’s target was Level 4 monsters, Blackie couldn’t help but ask nervously.

Challenging higher levels in God’s Domain was extremely difficult. Usually, players would just challenge monsters that are one level higher than themselves. Challenging monsters two levels higher required at least a 6-man party for it to be possible. However, even 6-man parties wouldn’t carry out such an action. Compared to exhausting themselves just to kill a single Level 3 monster, it was much more efficient to just kill a Level 2 monster.

Shi Feng and Blackie were only two people. Ignoring Shi Feng, who was a Level 2 Swordsman, Blackie himself was still a Level 0 Cursemancer. He was just free food to a Level 4 monster. Going against Level 4 monsters just with the two of them was utterly suicide......

Shi Feng only smiled regarding Blackie’s worries. He securely said, “Relax, can’t you see that I’m already Level 2? That friend of mine is an expert Beta Tester. If it weren’t for our good relation, he wouldn’t even tell me such a secret. You can just wait to get on the leveling rocket.”

Shi Feng pushed all the problems that came with him being a reincarnated person onto his ‘good friend’. Now all his actions in God’s Domain could be easily answered, too. He also didn’t have to explain much since Blackie would easily believe him.

This was because a Beta Tester was the best explanation.

“As expected of Brother Feng, you’re still the greatest. No wonder you didn’t join Shadow Workshop to earn money. With an expert Beta Tester giving you pointers, you could definitely earn a lot of money in God’s Domain. The happiness of my body’s lower half will depend on you now.” Blackie laughingly said as he became relieved.

When joined the party before, he was very surprised to see Shi Feng already at Level 2.

Currently, there had yet to be any news of a Level 2 player in Red Leaf Town. Even elites of a Workshop were no exception. However, Shi Feng had reached it. His leveling speed was absolutely terrifying.

Blackie knew about Shi Feng’s standards. Although his skills weren’t bad, he definitely wasn’t that good. Before, Blackie still had some suspicions about the news of the Beta Tester. However, all his worries disappeared after seeing Shi Feng’s level, because only a Beta Tester could make something like this happen. Blackie had also started believing the possibility of Shi Feng earning 16,000 Credits in ten days.

“Scram! This brother’s straight!” Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Blackie, slightly widening the distance between them. However, Blackie’s gaze still carried some impurities, causing Shi Feng to panic slightly.

“What are you thinking, Brother Feng? My dream lover is the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow.” Blackie hurriedly explained.

The Snow Goddess?

Shi Feng had a very deep impression of this woman. She had performed extremely outstanding in other virtual games. Not only did she possess an absolutely beautiful face and devilish body, but she also had a proud attitude which was backed up by her excellent battle techniques. Because of these traits, she became even better received by the public.

After three years since God’s Domain’s opening, she had become a top-tier expert within the whole country. She was also the top ten Berserker within the country. She was dubbed as the Battle Goddess. She had starred in plenty of commercials. Her personal net worth at that time had exceeded tens of billions of Credits. Not only that, but she was also the Vice Guild Leader of ‘Ouroboros’; millions of players would move with her single command. During those times, Shi Feng was only a minor character within God’s Domain. He could only look up to Gentle Snow’s shadow. Unfortunately, sometime later, Gentle Snow suddenly vanished from God’s Domain. Her disappearance became a hot topic within God’s Domain for some time.

“Brother Feng, look. That’s an Elite monster.” Blackie pointed towards a snow-white fox in the distant paddy field as he shouted.

Shi Feng looked over to the golden fields, discovering a white colored fox. There was even a little rabbit in the fox’s mouth right now.

[Cunning Snow Fox] (Rare Elite)

Level 2

HP 450

“Blackie, your eyesight and luck are seriously too good. You even spotted a Rare Elite. We’re going to earn a fortune this time.” Shi Feng stealthily walked closer to the fox as he directed Blackie, “You just attack from a distance and leave the rest to me.”

Rare Elites were a special type of Elite. They had the same capabilities as a normal Elite monster, but the rewards they give out were a lot greater. It would take a long time for it to respawn after being killed. Whether you could meet one depended on your luck. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Brother Feng, you must be crazy. That’s a Level 2 Elite. We can’t go against it.”

Blackie wanted to stop Shi Feng. Only a small party of the same level could deal with an Elite. Fighting one alone, without any healing, would definitely lead to death.

However, Blackie was too late. Shi Feng had quickly circled to the Snow Fox’s back, launching a sudden attack.

Chop!

A sword strike flew.

The Snow Fox’s actions were very nimble. It immediately avoided a vital hit to its abdomen, taking only 32 damage.

“Such nimble actions. Its Defense isn’t low either.” Shi Feng made a quick judgment after observing how the Snow Fox dodged and took damage.

He had the Might Of A Thousand title, so all his attributes were increased by 10%. There was also an additional 5 points to both Strength and Endurance, increasing his Strength to 13 and Endurance to 10. His Agility was also increased to 17 points. Now his Attack Power was 29, and he had 260 HP.

With great speeds, the enraged Snow Fox bit towards Shi Feng’s neck. It activated the skill [Fatal Blow].

However, with 17 Agility, Shi Feng’s speed was not any slower than the Snow Fox. By the time the Snow Fox had rushed over, Shi Feng’s Novice Sword had already struck down towards the fox’s head.

Peng!

Shi Feng only had 13 points of Strength; it was still not enough to block the Snow Fox’s attack. Forty-nine damage appeared above Shi Feng’s head, and his Novice Sword’s durability decreased by 1 point, as well.

On the other hand, the Snow Fox only received 5 damage. The gap between the two of them was as clear as day.

“We’re dead! We’re dead! We’re so dead this time.” Sweat started appearing on Blackie’s forehead. He had seen damage from Common monsters, but he never imagined that there was such a great difference from an Elite monster. Shi Feng was lucky he had blocked the attack with his sword, only taking close to 50 damage. If the attack landed on his body, wouldn’t it be over a hundred? Shi Feng had reached Level 2 with great difficulty. If he died this time, he would return to Level 1; his great advantage over others would be gone.

“Move, Blackie!” Shi Feng shouted.

“He really must’ve gone mad. Fine! Fine, at worst I’ll just die once. I’m still Level 0, anyway. Blackie clenched his teeth and started chanting a curse, his hands making gestures.

A [Dark Arrow] shot out, dealing 5 damage to the Snow Fox.

Blackie sucked in a deep breath when he saw the damage. He had added all his points into Intelligence, yet 5 damage was all he could do. An Elite monster’s Defense was just terrifying.

Shi Feng who was facing the Snow Fox was under even more pressure. The Snow Fox had very high Agility. It was able to dodge whenever Shi Feng wanted to use Chop. In the end, Shi Feng could only use normal slashes, dealing 18 damage each time. However, each successful bite from the Snow Fox would deal over a hundred damage; it was greatly disproportionate.

Tens seconds later, Shi Feng’s HP fell to 31, while the Snow Fox still had 244.

“I guess there’s still no way to directly face off against an Agility-type Elite with such a small amount of Skills.” Shi Feng looked at the Snow Fox’s half-remaining HP. If he continued to drag on this fight, he would be the one to die. He had to start bursting.

Shi Feng took out a bottle of Black Steel Beer from his bag. After taking two mouthfuls, he became slightly drunk, and his vision started becoming blurry. He then activated Gravity Liberation, his speed increasing by a huge leap. He arrived at the Snow Fox’s side with lightning speed.

When Shi Feng looked at the Snow Fox’s level again, it displayed Level 0, whereas he was Level 2. Suddenly, the suppression due to level difference was removed, letting Shi Feng’s damage rise. Similarly, however, his body became difficult to control.

“Die!” Shi Feng’s eyes were icy cold, his grip around the Novice Sword tightened.

Thundering Flash!

Hua! Hua! Hua!

Three lightning quick slashes struck past the Snow Fox’s waist, causing it to let out a tragic cry. Damages of -30, -36, -42 appeared on top of its head, instantly taking away a quarter of its HP.

Afterward, another Chop dealt 43 damage to it.

The Snow Fox desperately resisted, but Shi Feng’s speed after activating Gravity Liberation was very fast. Even if he was in a drunken state, with his many years of battle experiences, Shi Feng could still easily maneuver his body. This had placed the Snow Fox at an absolute disadvantage.

“Damn, what did you drink, Brother Feng? You’re suddenly so fierce!” Blackie’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as he saw Shi Feng’s cheat-like performance. At this moment, the fierce Snow Fox had become Shi Feng’s plaything. It had zero chance at resisting.

When the Snow Fox had 42 HP remaining, Shi Feng was about to give the last strike.

Suddenly, Shi Feng felt a shiver going down the back of his neck. It was as if he had a dagger pointed at his neck; it was a terrible feeling. Shi Feng instinctively leaped forward. In the next moment, a bright snowy dagger had slashed across his original position. Shi Feng had surprisingly avoided that strike.

Behind Shi Feng, a figure with an extremely surprised expression revealed himself. He had already kept his presence hidden incredibly well; he did not even let out a single sound. Not only that, after he had raised to Level 1, his Agility had reached 10 points. However, his sneak attack had actually been dodged. What sort of intuition did Shi Feng have?

“Friend, we have no hatred or enmity between us. It isn’t good doing something like this.” Shi Feng focused his gaze on the newly appeared Assassin as he coldly said so.

“If you wish to place blame, then blame yourself for angering us Shadow. It is too late even if you regret it now.” Quiet Wolf said excitedly. He held his dagger in reverse grip, paying attention to Shi Feng’s every movement.

Quiet Wolf had been following Shi Feng while also reporting his location. He never imagined that they would meet an Elite monster. The Snow Fox’s current target was Shi Feng. Although Shi Feng had good skills, with the Snow Fox holding him back Quiet Wolf could definitely find a chance to kill of Shi Feng’s remaining strand of life, then he could kill the Snow Fox. There were only benefits for him. As for the Cursemancer on the side, he was just garbage that was not even worth mentioning.

Naturally, the Snow Fox wouldn’t care about any of this. It just knew that it had to kill Shi Feng.

The Snow Fox suddenly bellowed, its snow-white skin turning into a flaming red. Its body also increased in size and its HP rose by 20%. Then, the Snow Fox activated its final skill [Tearing Bite]. The skill amplified its damage by 50%, also causing a bleeding damage of 30, lasting for 5 seconds.

“You can go and regret, now! I’ll take care of this Snow Fox in your stead.” Quiet Wolf rushed at Shi Feng. He was prepared to kill off Shi Feng the moment he dodged the Snow Fox.
