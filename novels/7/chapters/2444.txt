Chapter 2445 – You Have Two Choices

“Guild Leader, is it someone you’re familiar with?” Aqua Rose asked curiously when she saw Shi Feng muttering to himself.

The western continent was utterly foreign to eastern continent players like themselves. Although the distance separating the two main continents was not as great as the distance between the main continents and the various Otherworlds, in God’s Domain, it was as if a barrier existed between the two main continents.

Not only was information on the two main continents segregated, but even the cultures of the two continents differed significantly. For example, players of the same class would give the impression that they possessed a completely different class depending on which continent they played on; their combat styles would be quite dissimilar.

On the eastern continent’s side, battles were fought using mainly a combination of combat techniques and Skills or Spells, with Mana control playing only a supporting role. Meanwhile, on the western continent, battles were fought using mainly a combination of Mana control and Skills or Spells, while combat techniques were only for support.

Aside from the difference in combat styles, the greatest contrast between the eastern and western continents was the management styles that the various kingdoms and empires adopted.

On the eastern continent, NPC kingdoms and empires relied on their national armies to manage their cities. On the western continent, however, NPC cities were managed by the Adventurer’s Association; the various kingdoms’ and empires’ armies only served to maintain the safety of their respective countries’ borders and fend off the main forces of the Demonic Creatures.

As there existed many Demonic Creatures on the western continent, armies of Demonic Creatures regularly invaded kingdoms and empires. In fact, these Demonic Creatures would launch attacks on towns and cities once every two or three days—which was much more frequent than the monster sieges on the eastern continent—and sometimes even capture those on the borders.

If the various kingdoms and empires failed to reclaim those captured towns and cities, the players’ range of activity would shrink significantly. Conversely, the more demonic towns and cities the various kingdoms and empires captured, the larger the players’ range of activity would become. The western continent did not have any clearly defined neutral maps, and the territory the various kingdoms and empires possessed was in constant flux.

Hence, the western continent was labeled the “Demonic Creature Continent,” and battles on a national scale occurred here much more frequently than on the eastern continent. It wouldn’t even be surprising for a kingdom that had faded out of existence to reappear.

If the ten from Zero Wing could have someone familiar with the western continent guide them, it would save them a lot of trouble. After all, the western continent’s situation was ever-changing, and players not familiar with the western continent would most likely have a very difficult time mingling here.

“We’re not familiar with each other, just acquaintances,” Shi Feng replied, shaking his head as he looked at Yan Xiaoqian, who was fighting while commanding the battle.

He had come to know Yan Xiaoqian only because of the Azure Chamber of Commerce’s alchemy competition.

Although he had heard that Azure would be sending Yan Xiaoqian to the western continent to receive priority grooming, he never thought that he would encounter the woman here.

Currently, Yan Xiaoqian was already a Level 106, Tier 3 Great Mage. She was also equipped in quite a few pieces of Level 105 Fine-Gold Equipment, and the purple crystalline staff she wielded even radiated the glow unique to Epic items. At a glance, it was obvious that the staff was a Level 100-plus Epic Weapon. At this stage of the game, her equipment standard definitely ranked at the peak of God’s Domain.

Moreover, her Mana control had improved by a significant margin since Shi Feng last saw her. Now, she was actually capable of casting her Spells at a Completion Rate of 95% or above. The power her Spells exhibited could rival the attacks of Grand Lords of the same level.

While Shi Feng’s group was quietly observing the battle below, the players fighting inside the mine had similarly noticed Shi Feng’s group.

“Who are those people? Don’t they know that this is a battle between Azure and Divine Tribe?” a Tier 3 Berserker King, who was an Elder of the Azure Chamber of Commerce, muttered, a frown forming on his face as he looked at the players atop the Thunder Eagle.

At this point, even the various superpowers of God’s Domain still couldn’t afford to underestimate Tier 3 experts. Meanwhile, from what the Berserker King could tell, Shi Feng’s group of 10 were all Tier 3 experts. To ordinary superpowers, they would indeed pose a significant threat.

However, to superpowers like the Azure Chamber of Commerce and Divine Tribe, a force of 10 Tier 3 experts was nothing to worry about.

Nevertheless, on the western continent, what the various powers found most troublesome was when other people suddenly appeared in a battle between two powers. This was because nobody could guarantee whether this third party would simply spectate and do nothing, or try to take advantage of the situation. Hence, whenever a third party appeared, the two combatant powers would first take care of this unknown factor before resuming the battle.

The Azure Chamber of Commerce and Divine Tribe were superpowers that everybody on the western continent knew of. Now, however, someone had actually ignorantly barged into their battle.

Black Flame?! Why is he here?! Yan Xiaoqian revealed an astonished expression when she spotted Shi Feng sitting on the Thunder Eagle. Doesn’t he operate on the eastern continent?

Yan Xiaoqian had a very strong impression of Shi Feng. After all, Zero Wing was responsible for her loss to Silent Wonder during Azure’s alchemy competition, which, in turn, lost her family the ruling rights to the Chamber.

Aside from that, Shi Feng’s identity as a Tier 3 player had also shaken the entire competition venue.

Back then, not a single superpower had managed to produce a Tier 3 player, yet Shi Feng had succeeded in becoming one himself. Even Long Xianglong, one of Azure’s Grand Elders, had taken the initiative to acknowledge defeat against Shi Feng. This was something unprecedented.

Moreover, she had previously inwardly ridiculed Shi Feng for being so foolish as to give up on partnering with Azure and toss away an excellent opportunity to obtain the western continent’s resources. Hence, she never thought that Shi Feng would actually appear on the western continent now!

“Xiaoqian, do you know them?” the Berserker King Elder asked when he noticed the shock on Yan Xiaoqian’s face.

At this point, Yan Xiaoqian was a future Grand Elder that the Azure Chamber of Commerce was nurturing vigorously. Although she was currently only an ordinary Elder, her position, combined with her identity, granted her a status that was far superior to ordinary Elders’. She was well within her authority to argue with even the Chamber’s Vice Guild Leaders.

If Shi Feng’s group were Yan Xiaoqian’s acquaintances, then the Azure Chamber of Commerce would overlook the group’s transgressions. However, if they weren’t acquainted, then Azure definitely wouldn’t let the group off the hook.

“We’re somewhat acquainted. To be precise, they are Silent Wonder’s friends,” Yan Xiaoqian said after giving the matter some thought.

If possible, Yan Xiaoqian really did not wish to acknowledge her acquaintance with Shi Feng. After all, Silent Wonder was her rival, and Zero Wing was Silent Wonder’s supporter.

“Wonder’s friends?” When the Berserker King Elder heard Yan Xiaoqian’s words, the hostility in his eyes disappeared. “However, this matter will be problematic. Divine Tribe’s side definitely won’t let them off the hook.”

The Long Family had already acknowledged Silent Wonder as its future heiress. Since the Long Family now held the ruling rights for Azure, Silent Wonder’s position in the Chamber was higher than even the Chamber’s Grand Elders’.

Hence, any friend of Silent Wonder’s was naturally Azure’s friend as well.

Only, as they were currently busy defending the mine, they could not spare any manpower to rescue Shi Feng’s group.

Just as the Berserker King Elder finished speaking, Divine Tribe’s army dispatched a force of several hundred players to intercept Shi Feng’s group. Among these players, as many as 20 were Tier 3 players. And leading this detachment was Macaffrey，the vice commander of one of Divine Tribe’s trump card legions.

Due to his special Legacy, Macaffrey possessed a gigantic body three meters tall, which earned him the nickname “Mourning Giant.” Even Tier 3 Domain Realm experts couldn’t last very long in a fight against him.

In the next moment, the giant bat Macaffrey rode arrived before Shi Feng’s group. As he glared at Shi Feng’s group, the dark aura enveloping his body made the surrounding space uncomfortably hot.

“I don’t know who you people are, but since you dared set foot into Divine Tribe’s battlefield, then don’t think you can leave easily,” Macaffrey said in a rough and deafening tone. “You all have two choices. The first is to apologize and hand over 10 pieces of Level 100-plus Fine-Gold Equipment as compensation. As for the other option, believe me, you will not like it very much.”

Upon hearing Macaffrey’s words, the Divine Tribe members around him sneered as they looked at Shi Feng’s group. At the same time, they also took out Magic Scrolls to seal the surrounding space and track the souls of Zero Wing’s members.

It was obvious from the actions of Divine Tribe’s members that they were proficient in fighting against players that possessed Flying Mounts.

However, to the surprise of Divine Tribe’s members, Shi Feng and his companions remained indescribably calm even after hearing Macaffrey’s “friendly warning.” In fact, there was even a hint of pity in their eyes.

What’s going on?

For a moment, Divine Tribe’s members were confused as to which side was stronger and which was weaker in this confrontation.

“I’ll give you two choices as well, then. The first is to apologize and pay compensation. I don’t want much, just 100 pieces of Level 100-plus Fine-Gold Equipment will do. As for the other option, I believe you won’t like it very much, either,” Shi Feng retorted, his mouth curving in a calm smile as he swept his gaze over Divine Tribe’s members.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
