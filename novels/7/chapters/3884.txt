Chapter 3885 - 959 - First Battle Against a First-Generation Hero

TL Notes:

Changed “First Generation Hero” to “First-Generation Hero”

Sure enough!

Shi Feng grew ecstatic when he saw the system notification.

Simply put, the power of a Skill or Spell was determined by the amount of mana fueling it. When players could access only the mana within a certain distance, their only option to supply more mana to their Skills and Spells was to continuously compress the mana in their vicinity. It was similar to the principles behind the Threefold Mana Body Technique. By condensing the mana within a fixed volume, players could increase the quantity of mana they could access without increasing the volume of mana.

Fortunately, everything turned out as Shi Feng had guessed. Although compressing external mana was incredibly challenging, his experience with the Threefold Mana Body Technique had taught him how to compress mana effectively. Combined with his powerful Pseudo-Tier 7 Concentration, he managed to compress the external mana around him to the point where he could use it to execute Absolute Thunder at the Overlimit standard.

“What a terrifying strike!”

“He broke through all five layers in one attack! His Skill must have exceeded the 120% threshold! But hasn’t it only been a little over a day?! Is Black Flame a monster?!”

“It will be the Boss challenge next. I wonder if Black Flame can succeed?”

The sight of Shi Feng’s attack piercing the barrier shocked and excited the members of the Seven Luminaries Alliance and Ninth Street. They had never thought someone could practice a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill to the Overlimit standard within three days. Hope rose within their hearts.

Everyone understood that a Level 230 First-Generation Hero was not an opponent their team of 1,000 could defeat. If they wanted to leave with their lives, they’d have to abide by Adegas’s condition, practice the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skills and Spells he had granted them, and defeat him. Otherwise, they’d meet with death.

“As expected of the Continental Championship’s second strongest expert.”

Fighting spirit flared up in Rin’s calm eyes as she watched Shi Feng walking up to Adegas.

After experiencing Everlasting City’s competition and reaching the sixth-floor standard, Rin had thought that only other sixth-floor experts could be her opponent. Although Shi Feng had means that could grant him incredible strength, these means were ultimately external objects and could not be considered his real ability.

However, Rin changed her mind after seeing Shi Feng practice a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill to the Overlimit standard. She strongly believed that, even in the next Continental Championship, he would be an incredibly strong opponent for her.

“I admit that this human has a talent for learning Skills, but whether he can defeat the Guardian Boss is a different story. Ultimately, it’ll depend on us to defeat the Boss,” Snow Wolf said. Although he was surprised by Shi Feng’s accomplishment, he quickly resumed practicing the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill he had received from Adegas, paying no attention to anything else.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Although Snow Wolf did not know how powerful the human race’s First-Generation Heroes were, he could sense how terrifying of an existence Adegas was. Adegas was equivalent to a Level 230 World Boss. Furthermore, Basic Attributes aside, Shi Feng couldn’t even compete with Adegas in combat standards. After all, the latter had a whopping 21 HP bars.

In God’s Domain, the more HP bars monsters and NPCs possessed, the more intelligent they would be. According to Snow Wolf’s experience, Adegas’s 21 HP bars indicated that the NPC could easily execute Peak Gold-ranked techniques. Such a combat standard could not be toppled with just one Pseudo-Tier 7 Overlimit Skill. Only sixth-floor experts capable of Manifold Execution would stand a chance of defeating Adegas.

Rin did not refute Snow Wolf. Instead, she, too, resumed practicing the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill she received.

Although the archaic city raid had put them in a perilous situation, it had also granted them a massive opportunity. If they could defeat Adegas and secure a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill, their combat power in the future would skyrocket. Thus, they naturally couldn’t waste time paying attention to Shi Feng.

As Snow Wolf, Rin, and a few other experts practiced their Pseudo-Tier 7 Skills, Shi Feng arrived within 100 yards of Adegas.

“So, you are the first challenger, huh?” Adegas opened his eyes and gazed down at Shi Feng, who was only one-tenth his height. Then, he drew his greatsword from the ground and stated, “Three moves! So long as you can survive three moves from me, you will win!”

I only need to survive three moves? Shi Feng sighed in relief when he heard the rules of Adegas’s challenge.

In a direct confrontation with a Level 230 First-Generation Hero, Shi Feng had no doubt he would lose. After all, the God Chaser Set he currently equipped only rivaled Level 220 Legendary Equipment in Basic Attributes. Even though he had other items enhancing his Basic Attributes, such as the Dragon’s Fury Set (an Extraordinary Secret Treasure Set), multiple Divine Artifact-ranked ornaments, the Shadow Incinerator (a Godly Relic that was comparable to Divine Artifacts), and the Ancient Oath, which provided him with 20% of the Frostflame Sacred Dragon’s Basic Attributes, his Basic Attributes remained slightly inferior to that of Level 230 experts fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifacts. His Basic Attributes would be even worse when compared to Adegas’s.[1]

However, if he only had to survive three moves, he felt that he still had a chance of winning.

“Take this!” Adegas said as he swung his silver greatsword with both hands.

Boom!

In the blink of an eye, the greatsword carved with countless divine patterns launched over 30 sword lights at Shi Feng, each a thousand meters long. The sword lights tore through time and space, and together, they formed a massive wall that slammed down on Shi Feng.

Shi Feng dared not act recklessly against the oncoming wall of sword lights. Wielding the Winter of Eternal Night with one hand, he activated the weapon’s Active Skill Holy Mana’s Shadow, reconstructing his body into a gigantified version of himself. Besides his height increasing to over a dozen meters, his Basic Attributes also increased substantially. Immediately afterward, he swung the Shadow Incinerator at the wall of sword lights.

Incomplete Goddess-ranked Mana Technique, Threefold Mana Body!

Goddess-ranked Mana Technique, Dark Moon!

Suddenly, a black crescent clashed with the oncoming sword lights. From a third person’s perspective, it looked like two worlds had just collided, as countless spatial cracks formed around the primordial civilization city.

When the sword lights faded, Shi Feng stumbled a dozen steps back. His HP had also fallen by over 10%, and the Shadow Incinerator in his hand trembled violently.

The first attack is already this strong? Shi Feng gasped at the feeling of numbness in his arm.

Although Adegas had granted each of them a Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill or Spell, he required challengers to survive three moves against him. However, Pseudo-Tier 7 Skills and Spells had long Cooldowns. This meant that challengers could use their Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill or Spell to defend against only one of Adegas’s three moves. It also meant that the longer a challenger waited to use their Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill or Spell, the greater their chances of winning the challenge.

However, Adegas was far stronger than Shi Feng had imagined. Even though Shi Feng had already committed a significant portion of his strength, he nearly failed to block Adegas’s first move. And going by the nature of NPC trials, there was no doubt that Adegas’s subsequent moves would be even stronger.

Before Shi Feng could catch his breath, Adegas executed his second attack. Although this was another simple slash, the 30-plus sword lights created this time didn’t simply advance on Shi Feng side-by-side. They merged to form a 10,000-meter-long sword light that shattered space and time as it descended upon Shi Feng.

Dammit! When Shi Feng saw that Adegas’s second attack was much stronger than the first, he promptly executed Twofold Mana Body, followed by Absolute Thunder.

Immediately, a thousand-meter-long lightning dragon rose into the air and collided with the sword light, creating countless lightning bolts that bombarded the surroundings. When the dust settled, a crater over a dozen meters deep with a 1,000-yard radius appeared around Shi Feng. His feet had sunk deep into the ground, and his HP fell under 30%.

This scene stunned everyone watching. They had never thought a Pseudo-Tier 7 Overlimit Skill would be barely enough to defend against Adegas’s second attack. They couldn’t imagine how anyone was supposed to defend against the NPC’s third attack.

“Die!” Adegas was unsurprised by this outcome, executing his third attack without pause.

Although Adegas had apparently simply slashed at empty air once again, he had actually executed the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill that everyone, including Shi Feng, was incredibly familiar with.

Absolute Thunder!

When Shi Feng saw the 10,000-meter-long lightning dragon descending upon him, he activated Primordial Dragon’s Power and transformed into a Primordial Dragon without hesitation. Then, he swung his massive claw wreathed in pitch-black flames at the lightning dragon.

The End!
