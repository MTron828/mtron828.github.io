Chapter 213 – Monsters Strike

Primordial ruins, Windy Sand Town:

A Level 110 girl carrying two daggers by her waist hurriedly entered the only bar in town. Then, she approached a masked young man drinking by himself inside the establishment and quietly reported, “Boss Wolf, we just received news that Zero Wing has dispatched a large group of experts into the primordial ruins. According to our brothers stalking Zero Wing’s experts, it seems they are making their way over to Windy Sand Town.”

“Zero Wing is sending a large group of experts to our location?” the young man named Summer Wolf said, a dubious expression appearing on his face when he heard the masked girl’s report. “Could they have been misled by Zero Wing? Even Asura’s members don’t dare to get close to Windy Sand Town. Zero Wing’s experts would have to be crazy to come here.”

Due to the Flower of Seven Sins’ investment, Windy Sand Town had already become a gathering place for Red Players. Even if the Flower of Seven Sins chose to stand aside and do nothing, the town’s tens of thousands of Red Players would most likely attack Zero Wing’s members like a pack of hungry wolves. After all, not only could they acquire the weapons and equipment of the Zero Wing members that they killed, but they could also earn an additional sum of Credits through the Flower of Seven Sins’ public bounty.

Hence, unless Zero Wing’s members were tired of living, there was no way they’d come to Windy Sand Town.

However, as soon as Summer Wolf finished speaking, a loud exclamation came from outside the bar.

“We’re under attack! We’re under attack! Someone’s besieging the town!” a Level 108 Berserker with a red name yelled as he ran into the bar.

“We’re under siege?”

“Did someone go crazy? Who would dare to pick a fight with the Flower of Seven Sins?”

“Interesting! How many people are on the other side? Which power is so tired of living?”

The many Red Players inside the bar were quickly excited by the news. Windy Sand Town might not have any defensive facilities or even a defensive magic array protecting it, but it was the biggest gathering place for players in the primordial ruins. It was also the only town with more than 6,000 Refinement Realm experts present within it at all times.

In addition, most of the players in Windy Sand Town were Red Players, individuals used to fighting against other players. Because of this, even two superpowers working together wouldn’t dare to attack the town.

Meanwhile, after the Berserker caught his breath, he shouted, “Zero Wing! It’s Zero Wing’s experts! They’ve already broken through the entrance and have begun sweeping through the main street! Many of the town’s experts have already gone to stop Zero Wing, but they’re unlikely to last long! We need to send reinforcements quickly!”

Silence enveloped the bar momentarily when the Berserker finished speaking. Then, laughter filled the establishment.

“Hahaha! It seems someone forgot to wake up today!”

“Zero Wing’s besieging the town? Can you be any more exaggerated?”

“Zero Wing is only a small Guild that’s been established recently. They won’t even dare to approach Windy Sand Town, let alone attack it!”

Not one person in the bar believed the Berserker’s words. Aside from the 6,000-plus Refinement Realm experts, many of the Flower of Seven Sins’ core members were also based in Windy Sand Town. They’d consider Zero Wing plenty courageous if it dared to send its members near the town, much less besiege the town.

After all, a force of 6,000-plus Refinement Realm experts was enough to kill several Tier 6 God-ranked experts.

“Could this be true, Boss Wolf?” the short woman from the Flower of Seven Sins asked, sweat appearing on her forehead. Only a few minutes ago, she received news of Zero Wing’s Black Flame entering the primordial ruins with a large group of experts. Yet, now, someone had entered the bar saying that Zero Wing was besieging the town. Although this claim sounded absurd, the coincidental timing led her to suspect it might be true.

“It matters not whether it is true. Since Zero Wing’s members dared to approach Windy Sand Town, we’ll make sure none of them leave here alive!” Summer Wolf said, a flash of excitement appearing in his eyes. “Notify the Wild Wolf Team! It’s time to hunt Black Flame!”

Although Summer Wolf didn’t know what gave Zero Wing the courage to come to Windy Sand Town, the Flower of Seven Sins was no pushover. It didn’t matter even if Zero Wing’s team had a Tier 6 God-ranked expert leading it. In a situation where everyone was at Tier 3, even a former God-ranked expert would fall when attacked by more than twenty peak experts and above.

“Okay! I’ll notify the others!” the short woman responded excitedly.

It was normally incredibly difficult to kill a Tier 6 God-ranked expert. Aside from the seven commanders, there were only a handful or so players capable of killing God-ranked experts in the Flower of Seven Sins.

For players like herself, they would never get the opportunity to accomplish such a glorious feat unless they could also get promoted to Tier 6.

Now, however, a God-ranked expert had sent himself to their doorsteps. This was a heaven-sent opportunity to kill a God-ranked expert. Just the thought of killing a God-ranked expert excited her greatly!

However, as soon as this short girl finished speaking, several other Flower of Seven Sins members rushed into the bar from outside with fear coloring their faces.

“Boss Wolf! Run! Run away quickly!”

“Monsters! They’re a group of monsters! There’s no way those monsters are from Zero Wing! They must be experts from the Five Great Super Guilds disguising as Zero Wing’s members! The Five Great Super Guilds must’ve joined hands to attack us!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

These several Flower of Seven Sins members shouted frantically after entering the bar.

When Summer Wolf saw these panic-stricken players, he recognized them instantly. They were none other than the members of the Wild Wolf Team. Every one of them was a bona fide peak expert. When two dozen of them joined hands and got the help of a battle array, they could hold their ground against even the Tier 6 God-ranked experts in the Flower of Seven Sins.

“What’s going on?! Calm down and speak clearly!” Summer Wolf said hurriedly, the words of the Wild Wolf Team’s members confusing him. Monsters? Five Great Super Guilds? What were they even talking about?

“Many, many peak experts! A few minutes ago, a large number of peak experts suddenly appeared outside the town! Many of them wore Zero Wing’s Guild Emblem, but that’s only a disguise! There’s no way Zero Wing has over 500 peak experts!”

“That’s right! I wanted to ask why they were attacking us, but they didn’t give us any time to react and simply attacked without saying a word! We lost over 2,000 Refinement Realm experts to them in less than a minute!”

“Those people are simply monsters! Every one of them is ridiculously young, with the oldest looking no more than twenty! Yet, I can barely hold my ground in a one-on-one fight against those monsters! Some of those people are stronger than even the team leader! It didn’t take more than five seconds before a group of them killed the team leader!”

…

TL Notes:

Fyi, Summer Wolf and the short girl have both appeared in Chapter 169 before. However, based on the conversions in this chapter, I don’t think Summer Wolf is the team leader of the Wild Wolf Team.
