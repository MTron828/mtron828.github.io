Chapter 337 - Unfathomably Deep

Listening to Shi Feng’s anxious tone, everyone from Zero Wing knew that the situation was not as simple as it appeared.

Since Shi Feng had issued his command, none of them would tarry. One after another, they quickly ran for the entrance of the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold.

The Mechanical Slayer’s strength was simply too terrifying. Not only did it possess region-scale destruction skills, but it could also kill Level 50 Tier 1 NPCs with a single hit.

If it had only been a region-scale destruction skill, they could have dealt with it. The key thing was that even the Mechanical Slayer’s basic attacks could instantly kill an NPC guard with over 100,000 HP. At this stage of the game, players had no hope of defeating the Mechanical Slayer.

“Guild Leader, be careful.” Fire Dance could not help but tighten her fists, reluctance filling her heart.

“Yeah,” Shi Feng gave a simple reply. At the moment, he could not relax as he had before.

His current enemies were not limited to just the Mechanical Slayer. They also included the eight other Mechanical Watchers.

Previously, these Mechanical Watches had run out of the hidden warehouse in pursuit of the other members of Zero Wing. However, after everyone escaped from the hidden warehouse, these Mechanical Watchers rushed back to deal with Shi Feng.

It was extremely challenging for Shi Feng to slow the Mechanical Slayer’s movements while simultaneously dodging the attacks of the eight Mechanical Watchers. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When all was said and done, Shi Feng was only a Level 24 Tier 0 Swordsman. Only by activating all the lifesaving skills he possessed could he barely avoid death. However, he was about to run out of gas.

“Damn you fools! I’m clearly helping you right now, yet you idiots are trying to kill me! Since you all wish for death so badly, I’ll grant you your wish!” Shi Feng looked at the eight Mechanical Watchers that only focused their attacks on him in anger. Then, instead of throwing the Intermediate Frost Grenade in his hand at the Mechanical Slayer, Shi Feng aimed it at the Mechanical Watchers charging at him.

“Have fun with each other. Damn you bastards.”

After freezing the eight Mechanical Watchers, Shi Feng retrieved a Speed Scroll from his bag and used it. His Movement Speed soared once more. He then charged directly towards the hidden warehouse’s entrance.

“You will all die!” The Mechanical Slayer let out a mechanical roar after escaping its icy imprisonment. The entire warehouse trembled at its mighty roar.

Instantly, the Mechanical Slayer strode forward and charged at the escaping Swordsman.

While moving forward, however, the Mechanical Slayer found itself blocked by the eight frozen Mechanical Watchers. Without a shred of hesitation, the Slayer swung its greatsword at one of its supposed-allies. The strike sent one of the heavy, over six-feet-tall Watchers flying. Making eight quick successive swings, the Mechanical Slayer sent all eight Mechanical Watchers into the warehouse’s walls.

“Such horrifying damage...it is as expected of a Mutant.” At this moment, Shi Feng finally managed to glimpse of the Mechanical Slayer’s real damage.

A basic swing from its greatsword devoured more than 300,000 HP from each of the Mechanical Watchers.

In other words, the Mechanical Slayer could easily kill a Level 30 Lord ranked Mechanical Watcher with only five basic attacks.

With such strength, the Mechanical Slayer could effortlessly massacre a starter town.

“It seems that fleeing to a town is out of the question.” Shi Feng frowned as he gauged the Mechanical Slayer’s combat power.

Mutants were a special existence in God’s Domain. They were not bound by the logic of the game. Normally, Mutants were born from mutated monsters. However, a Mutant’s spawn rate was as low as that of obtaining a Lucky Stone in God’s Domain.

The system’s laws had no effect on these Mutants, and they were completely independent creatures. They could wander about to any region, and they would attack and destroy any living being they come across.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, every time a Mutant appeared in God’s Domain, a disaster would follow. Mutants were like the various natural disasters in the real world, and they were not something that a single player could deal with.

Mutants possessed an intellect several times higher than normal monsters, and they were practically on the same level as a high-level NPC. In addition, when a monster mutated, their combat power would increase by several folds.

Shi Feng had met with a Mutant in the past. The Mutant had originally been a Level 80 Common monster. However, after it mutated, it had instant-killed the Level 75 Tier 2 player who had been its opponent at the time.

If a Level 75 Tier 2 player possessed incredible techniques, soloing a Level 80 Lord ranked monster was only a matter of time. Naturally, if such a player wished to escape, they would have no problems doing so. Yet, faced with a Level 80 Common monster, the Level 75 Tier 2 player had no chance to flee. Of course, one of the reasons for that player’s demise was negligence. However, the fact that a Level 80 Common monster was capable of instant-killing a Level 75 Tier 2 player clearly displayed how much more powerful it became after becoming a Mutant.

Following which, that mutated Common monster had become the nightmare of players.

By the time everyone was aware of the Mutant’s existence, over 10,000 players had died at its hands. More importantly, the Mutant monster grew stronger the more it killed.

This incident had attracted the attention of many large Guilds. Based on everyone’s knowledge, the more powerful a monster was, the better was the quality of the items it dropped. This was an iron-law of God’s Domain, and even Mutants should have been no exception to this law.

Since this mutated monster was so powerful, being even stronger than a High Lord of the same level, its loot would be magnificent.

Hence, the various Guilds at the time had sent their own armies to hunt this Mutant. At that time, over 100,000 players had been dispatched, and all of them were above Level 70. There were even Tier 2 professional experts among them.

The battle between the Mutant and the player army had shaken the heaven and earth. A starter town had even been decimated as a result of that war.

Although the player army had successfully killed the Mutant in the end, the losses they suffered were tremendous. Out of the 100,000 players sent out, less than 3,000 survived....

Meanwhile, the Mutant before Shi Feng right now had mutated from a High Lord monster. Currently, the Mechanical Slayer was just a newborn; its strength was at its weakest right now. Shi Feng did not dare imagine how powerful it would become once it matured.

In the past, a Level 80 Common Mutant had grown to be able to wipe out over 90,000 players from a 100,000 strong army. Moreover, some of those players had been Tier 2 experts, and everyone’s levels at that time were not much different than the Mutant’s. Meanwhile, although the Mechanical Slayer before Shi Feng was only Level 50, not a single player had reached Level 40 yet. To put it simply, the Mechanical Slayer was invincible against players.

During the time Shi Feng took to escape the hidden warehouse, the Mechanical Slayer had taken care of all eight Mechanical Watchers. Finished with the nuisances, the Mechanical Slayer renewed its charge at Shi Feng.

“So fast!” Shi Feng hurriedly threw a Frost Grenade at it.

This time, however, the Mechanical Slayer had not fallen for the same trick. With nimble steps, it easily avoided the Intermediate Frost Grenade Shi Feng had thrown.

“Damn! It’s those Mechanical Watchers’ fault!” Shi Feng’s anger grew. In the beginning, when the Mechanical Slayer had just awoken, its intellect had still been considerably low. Hence, it failed to dodge the first Frost Grenade. Moreover, as long as Shi Feng’s stock of Intermediate Frost Grenades did not run out, he could freeze the Mechanical Slayer for an indefinite amount of time. Now, however, this strategy was no longer viable.

Almost immediately, the Mechanical Slayer caught up to Shi Feng, its serrated greatsword coursing its way towards him. Currently, the hallway Shi Feng was in only had one path. There was nowhere to dodge, and death was all but inevitable.

Shi Feng had no choice but to bet everything he had, pointing the Abyssal Blade at the Mechanical Slayer.

Abyssal Bind!

Nine pitch-black chains suddenly sprouted from the ground, binding the Mechanical Slayer.

“Aooo!”

The Mechanical Slayer struggled madly, and in the blink of an eye, it shattered one of the chains. Soon, the second and third chain broke apart as well.

At this moment, the chains of Abyssal Bind that had never failed Shi Feng until now seemed as fragile as strips of paper....
