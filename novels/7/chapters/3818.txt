Chapter 3819 - 893 - Hephaestus's Flame

Flame Dragon God’s Treasury, Central Plaza:

While the players trapped in the magic barriers fell into a panic, Red Frost quickly found Shi Feng sitting in a corner, redeeming items, and tried to persuade him to transfer his possessions to her for safekeeping.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, we’re running out of time,” Red Frost said, slightly exasperated by Shi Feng, who refused to go along with her arrangement. “The old commander won’t be able to buy us much time. Because of our partnership, Ember Dragon is bound to come after you. But as I am Holy Dragon Spear’s future representative, nobody will dare confiscate my possessions unless they wish to start an all-out war with Holy Dragon Spear. Red-Tailed Dragon won’t sit by and watch, either. So, your safest option now is to transfer your most valuable possessions to me for safekeeping.”

“Commander Frost, I understand what you mean,” Shi Feng said, a little moved by Red Frost’s concern for him. After all, very few people would be willing to bear the pressure of multiple pseudo-apex powers to help someone. However, he still refused Red Frost’s goodwill, explaining, “But I’m afraid there is no negotiating this matter. I really cannot take out the items in my bag. Otherwise, I will be plagued with endless troubles.”

“I understand your concerns. Who in God’s Domain doesn’t have some secrets?” Red Frost rolled her eyes at Shi Feng, feeling that he was making a mountain out of a molehill.

She had seen many treasures before as the former number-one chosen one of Holy Dragon Spear. She had seen even Godly Relics before, let alone Divine Artifacts. Even if Shi Feng did have Godly Relics in his bag, it would be an exaggeration to say that he would be plagued with endless troubles if they were discovered. Only ordinary powers and independent players would think so.

“This…” Shi Feng didn’t know what to say in response to Red Frost’s skepticism.

His bag held items that could influence the entire Greater God’s Domain. Moreover, there was more than one such item. Setting aside the Book of Eternity and the newly acquired Dragon-Hunting Artillery Design, just the two Pseudo-Tier 7 Spell Books could make every player in the Greater God’s Domain lose their minds.

As for the Inferior Divine Tier 7 Promotion Land Scroll, it was an item that even the Holy Race would try to obtain at any cost.

While Shi Feng was wondering how to explain his situation to Red Frost, a soul-piercing scream suddenly echoed across the plaza, sounding like it originated from the depths of hell. Immediately afterward, silver-black flames erupted from a corner of the plaza, rising hundreds of meters into the air and causing the souls of all players in the area to shudder.

“Madness! These pseudo-apex powers must be out of their minds! They’re trying to permanently erase us!”

“A Tier 6 Soul Fire?! Dammit! I knew these pseudo-apex powers were crooked! After having us gather Undying Souls for them, they are now trying to get rid of us!”

“Fight! We must fight back!”

“I agree! Even Legendary Equipment Sets will be reduced to ashes if burnt by a Tier 6 Soul Fire for several seconds! Our only hope is to break the barriers!”

…

When the thousands of players trapped in the plaza saw the conclusion the ten pseudo-apex powers had reached, they attacked the magic barriers and the pseudo-apex powers’ members out of desperation. In the blink of an eye, the flames of war engulfed most of the plaza.

“Hephaestus’s Flame?! Are the Great Commander and the others insane?!” Red Frost stared at the silver-black flames in stupefaction.

There were six tiers of Soul Fire. Tier 1 was the weakest, while Tier 6 was the strongest. Soul Fire also existed in different types, and Tier 6 Soul Fire came in various levels of strength.

However, even Basic Tier 6 Soul Fire, the weakest of the bunch, could incinerate a Tier 6 player’s Immortal Soul in seconds. As for powerful Tier 6 Soul Fire, also known as Advanced Tier 6 Soul Fire, they could impart permanent death to players and render useless resurrection items that could give players a second chance at God’s Domain.

Hephaestus’s Flame was one type of Advanced Tier 6 Soul Fire. Normally, it was impossible for a single pseudo-apex power to command an Advanced Tier 6 Soul Fire. The cooperation of at least several pseudo-apex powers was necessary. This was because Soul Fire of such caliber burdened its users heavily. To control it, many players with Tier 6 Peak or Tier 6 Limit Concentration were required. Otherwise, using an Advanced Tier 6 Soul Fire would be counterproductive.

Amidst Red Frost’s stupor, several hundred Level 235-plus experts—some of them fifth-floor experts—were killed by Hephaestus’s Flame without resistance.

As expected of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s pseudo-apex powers. They even managed to get their hands on a Tier 6 Soul Fire like Hephaestus’s Flame. Shi Feng was astonished as he looked at the roaring silver-black flames.

Hephaestus’s Flame wasn’t easily obtained in the Greater God’s Domain. It had been extinct since the Mythical Era, and its value exceeded that of Divine Artifacts. Besides its ability to annihilate players’ Immortal Souls, it was also highly valued because it could increase the production success rate of forging and alchemy.

As for Hephaestus’s Flame’s offensive capabilities, they were of secondary importance. This was because its offensive power only reached the standard of Profound Skills of Divine Artifacts utilized to 100% potential. While they might be equal in power, only one player with Tier 6 Limit Concentration was needed to exert a Divine Artifact to its full potential. There was no need to go through the hassle of mustering several dozen elite players.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, you have to escape! Now! If you get hit by those flames, you can never be resurrected!” Red Frost hurriedly said after she returned to her senses. “I’ll try to interrupt their casting in the meantime!”

…

While Red Frost was persuading Shi Feng, the ten pseudo-apex powers’ executives watched the battle through their Magic Mirrors.

Escape? What can someone ranked 281st on the Divine Glory List possibly do in this situation? Ember Dragon smirked as he watched Red Frost’s actions. While I might lose the Access Key, at least I can remove one of your supporters.

Although the ten pseudo-apex powers did not commit their full strength to the frontlines, they still mobilized over a thousand Level 235-plus experts. These experts had mastered multiple Gold Combat Techniques and possessed at least Level 230 Epic Equipment. Each pseudo-apex power had also contributed one expert who could rank among the Divine Glory List’s top 30 to lead the army. With these experts at the helm, Hephaestus’s Flame could exhibit its full power at all times.

Even Red Frost, a sixth-floor expert who had reached Level 231, would succumb to such a line-up, let alone Shi Feng.

“Great Commander, should we try to negotiate with Tarnished Wind?” When Apocalypse saw Red Frost planning to make a move, his anxiety rose.

Red Frost was Holy Dragon Spear’s hope. If Red Frost were to die while attempting to protect Shi Feng, the adventurer team would suffer a devastating loss.

“I want to, but Ember Dragon somehow managed to convince Tarnished Wind not to side with us,” South Lake said, gritting his teeth. “If we don’t have Red-Tailed Dragon’s support, none of the other pseudo-apex powers will take us seriously…”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Are we supposed to just watch, then?” Apocalypse asked.

“We wait! Once Red Frost is under attack, we can use her status as the future Great Commander of Holy Dragon Spear as an excuse to intervene. At that time, the others won’t be able to say anything about us,” South Lake said, clenching his fists so hard that his knuckles trembled. His expression also turned chilly as he gazed at the Magic Mirror before him.

…

Meanwhile, as Red Frost was about to rush up to the ten pseudo-apex powers’ army, a cloaked man with horns suddenly appeared before the army, exuding a terrifying aura akin to that of a dragon from primordial times. The souls of everyone in the army involuntarily shuddered.

“Who are you?! How dare you stand against us?!” someone from the army shouted.

“The pseudo-apex powers of this world, huh? Let me see what you’re made of!”
