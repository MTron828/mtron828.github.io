Chapter 2823 – Fortress’s Abilities

The 1,000 Faux Saint Saboteurs flew across the sky with their ten-meter-tall bodies. From the Mobile Fortress’s perspective, they looked like a dark cloud flowing toward it.

In addition, over a million Faux Saint monsters marched toward the fortress on the ground.

The ground shook with every step these monsters took, the spectacular sight stupefying the players standing guard on the Mobile Fortress.

“It seems we can’t underestimate this Beast Emperor, after all. Despite being only a puppet of the Evil God, he’s actually capable of mobilizing so many Mythic monsters. With this, even if we don’t make a move, Zero Wing probably won’t last very long,” a five-meter-tall, middle-aged man atop the Ancient Demonic Serpent said. Laughing, he continued, “We won’t even get to teach Zero Wing a lesson now.”

Although this golden-armored Giant only spoke normally, his deep voice made the surrounding space tremble.

If Shi Feng were here, he would definitely be shocked to see this golden-armored Giant.

This middle-aged man was not only a bona fide Giant but also a Level 133, Tier 4 Berserker. The surrounding space already grew heavier just from the aura he exuded.

“That isn’t necessarily a bad thing. With this, we can avoid exposing our strength and reduce the Black Knight Legion’s expenditure,” Windshadow said as he looked at the Faux Saint monsters above and below him. “Don’t forget that our goal this time is to rescue that good-for-nothing brat from Sky Spring City’s prison. Dealing with Zero Wing is secondary.” “I guess you’re right. Let’s hope Sky Spring City’s Magistrate can let me stretch my muscles a little,” the golden-armored Giant said, nodding

While Windshadow and the golden-armored Giant were conversing, Jade Leaf, who sat at a side, dared not utter a word, shame filling her face.

Protecting and rescuing Awakened Abyss should’ve been her job, yet she had to turn to Elder Windshadow and Long Day, the vice commander of Hundred Ghosts’s main force, for help. This was a severe dereliction of duty on her part. She was very likely to get removed from the priority list for training when she returned to the Guild’s headquarters. After all, not only was Awakened Abyss one of Hundred Ghosts’s top talents, but his status was one that even Elder Windshadow dared not offend.

Inside the Mobile Fortress, Unyielding Heart and Illusory Words saw the overwhelming army of Faux Saint monsters and couldn’t help gasping in shock.

Although they had long since known that their enemy consisted of over a million Faux Saint monsters and 1,000 Faux Saint Saboteurs, this terrifying scene still frightened them.

The Faux Saint army on the ground aside, just the 1,000 Faux Saint Saboteurs in the air already posed a massive threat. Such a large force of Mythic monsters could easily break through even the defensive magic arrays of NPC cities.

Generally, fortresses possessed significantly stronger defensive magic arrays than cities. However, the Mobile Fortress was different from a stationary fortress. To gain the convenience of movement, the Mobile Fortress sacrificed a portion of its defensive capabilities. Hence, while the Mobile Fortress was still capable of blocking the attacks of these Faux Saint Saboteurs, it was unknown how long it could continue doing so.

Once the defensive barrier broke, these Faux Saint Saboteurs would slaughter the players inside the fortress. Even Tier 4 players like themselves wouldn’t be able to stop these monsters. After all, the difference in numbers was simply too massive.

“Everyone, get ready! Attack with everything you’ve got once these Faux Saint monsters enter within range!” Unyielding Heart shouted. “Remember! Do not hold back anything! Fight with everything you’ve got right off the bat! Only by removing these Mythic monsters as soon as possible will we have a greater chance of victory!”

“Yes, sir!”

When the players stationed atop of the fortress walls saw the approaching Faux Saint Saboteurs, they couldn’t help gulping nervously.

The outcome of the upcoming battle would be decided by whether they managed to finish off these Faux Saint Saboteurs before the latter destroyed the fortress’s defensive magic array.

This would be a race against the duration of the defensive barrier!

Meanwhile, on the Fortress Lord’s Mansion’s top floor, which was also the highest point in the fortress...

“Guild Leader, they’re here,” Fire Dance reported. When the Faux Saint Saboteurs were less than 1,000 yards away from the fortress, she asked nervously, “Should we start attacking now?”

“No, let them come closer,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

The Mobile Fortress had 26 Large Magic Elven Cannons and eight Magic Charging Towers. Its overall firepower exceeded that of Guild Cities by leaps and bounds. However, this frightening firepower came at an equally frightening cost.

Every shot the Large Magic Elven Cannons fired cost 6,000 Magic Crystals, and they had a Cooldown of one minute.

As for the Magic Charging Towers, they cost 20,000 Magic Crystals to fire each time and had a Cooldown of three minutes.

Although Shi Feng had over five million Magic Crystals on hand, he still couldn’t afford to employ these weapons freely. Hence, they had to make the most of every shot. Meanwhile, a distance of 1,000 yards was practically nothing to the Mythic ranked Faux Saint Saboteurs. Just three seconds later, they appeared before the Mobile Fortress’s defensive barrier. Immediately afterward, all 1,000 Faux Saint Saboteurs raised the various weapons they held and launched a barrage of ruthless attacks on the defensive barrier.

The next moment, deafening noises came from outside the Mobile Fortress. Numerous spatial tears also appeared around the fortress’s defensive barrier. The barrier itself trembled violently, and even the players inside the fortress could clearly sense the power of the attacks.

Outside the Mobile Fortress, the thunderous assault was audible even from over 10,000 yards away.

“What powerful attacks! If it were a Guild City’s defensive magic array, it would’ve most likely crumbled at the first wave of attacks,” Long Day exclaimed in astonishment.

The simultaneous attacks of 1,000 Mythic monsters were simply earth-shattering. Even a Tier 5 large-scale destruction Spell would pale in comparison to this barrage!

Jade Leaf also nodded in agreement. Even an NPC Main City’s defensive magic array would suffer tremendously before this combined attack, let alone a measly Mobile Fortress.

However, when the attacks ended, Hundred Ghosts’s members and the players standing atop the Mobile Fortress’s walls were all stunned.

“It’s fine?”

At this time, not only were there no cracks on the defensive barrier, but the magic power oscillation from the barrier also remained frighteningly smooth and steady. It was evident that the Faux Saint Saboteurs’ attacks failed to reach the barrier’s defensive limit. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meanwhile, at the Fortress Lord’s Mansion, Fire Dance goggled in shock.

“Isn’t this barrier a little too strong?!”

She had a clear view of the defensive barrier’s energy level right now. Let alone 1%, the barrier barely lost 0.01% of its Mana reserves after the Faux Saint Saboteurs’ first wave of attacks.

Given a depletion rate of 0.01% per second, the Faux Saint Saboteurs would take 166 minutes to break the barrier. However, the barrier’s Mana reserves could be replenished at intervals of 30 minutes, with each restoration costing 100,000 Magic Crystals.

In other words, so long as they had sufficient Magic Crystals, the 1,000 Mythic monsters before them wouldn’t be able to destroy the Mobile Fortress’s defensive magic array, no matter what.

“Not bad,” Shi Feng said calmly.

Inwardly, though, he, too, was surprised by this outcome. He never thought that the Mobile Fortress’s defensive capabilities were so amazing. No wonder the Mobile Fortresses I saw in my previous life were capable of blocking the attacks of even Tier 5 players.

The next moment, Shi Feng turned to Fire Dance and said, “Have the ones below start testing the power of the Magic Elven Cannons!”
