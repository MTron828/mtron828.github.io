Chapter 424 - Locked Dark-Gold Treasure Chest

The instant the Flame Guards broke out of the barrier, Shi Feng felt a wave of heat wash over him, the surrounding temperature rising rapidly.

This was the Flame Guards’ Flame Domain.

Any enemy within a 50-yard radius would receive a Burning DoT and lose 400 HP every three seconds.

Currently, Level 20 players only had around 2,600 to 2,700 HP on average, while plate armor classes only had around 3,000. On top of that, most players didn’t have any Fire Resistance. Under the effects of the Flame Domain, most players would not last very long. Hence, compared to other Lords, the Flame Guards were far deadlier to the current players of God’s Domain.

Moreover, the Flame Guards had instantly shattered the powerful barrier that had hidden the cave. One could just imagine how powerful they were.

Even if Shi Feng activated Blade Liberation, he would not be a match for these Guards.

Faced with over a dozen Level 28 Berserk Lords, even as a Tier 1 Blade Saint, Shi Feng’s only option was to flee for his life.

Fortunately, the Flame Guards were not very fast, and with the dense stone forest hindering their movements, they were even slower. Moreover, the most frightening aspect of the Flame Guards, the Flame Domain, was ineffective against Shi Feng.

With 60 points of Fire Resistance, Shi Feng was not even slightly uncomfortable inside the Flame Domain. On the contrary, he felt warm and cozy.

Considering that the barrier had shattered, Shi Feng had an idea. Suddenly, he spun around. He then activated Defensive Blade and dashed towards the Flame Guards.

“Aooo!”

The dozen or so berserk Flame Guards roared as they watched the ant charge at them. They raised their war hammers, ready to slam their weapons down on Shi Feng.

Shi Feng smiled faintly as he used Void Steps.

After having rested fully, Shi Feng suddenly felt that the burden on his spirit was much lighter when he used Void Steps than it had been. Moreover, Shi Feng had a sense of familiarity that he never felt before when using Void Steps; every movement felt natural.

Before the gigantic flame hammers could strike him, Shi Feng’s figure suddenly vanished from sight.

When the Flame Guards lost their target, their flame hammers paused in midair as they scanned the area for Shi Feng. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After the dozen or so Lords searched for a moment, they still could not find any traces of their quarry. It was as if Shi Feng had never existed. Suddenly, the Flame Guards were at a loss.

By the time Shi Feng reappeared, he had already passed the Flame Guards’ blockade and was about ten yards from the Lords.

Such a long distance!

Shi Feng was shocked when he discovered that he could actually move more than ten yards while using Void Steps.

Previously, he had only been able to move around a distance of five to six yards before reappearing. Now, he could cross over ten yards before he was discovered. Right now, he had almost caught up with the top-tier experts who had reached minor completion of Void Steps in the past.

Before Shi Feng could rejoice about his improvement, the Flame Guards spat scorching flames from their mouths.

Like a tsunami, the fire blanketed the ground, devouring everything in its path as it swept towards Shi Feng.

However, although the flames moved swiftly, Shi Feng was not any slower. With the 150% Movement Speed increase Wind Rider provided, Shi Feng had easily shaken off the inferno chasing him as he dove into the Final Cave.

Immediately after Shi Feng entered the cave, a notification sounded out from the system.

System: You have discovered the Final Cave.

The Final Cave’s interior was dark. However, the cave walls looked like the starry skies, softly illuminating the gloom. With the weak starlight, Shi Feng could see up to fifty yards around him. If he encountered a monster, he could respond in time.

Meanwhile, inside the cave, the footprints that Shi Feng had previously lost track of had appeared once more. Shi Feng then gradually advanced while following Aqua Rose’s footprints. Along the way, the more Shi Feng observed the Final Cave, the more he realized that this cave was not as simple as it appeared.

Many mysterious runes and pictures were engraved onto the cave walls, and they gave off a similar feeling to the runes found in the Eternal Courtyard. They felt ancient and full of divine power.

Other than these runes, there were also many Earthen Puppets roaming inside the Final Cave. These Puppets were around the same size as a player. Though they were somewhat slow, their flesh consisted of stone; their bodies were extremely tough. Ordinary weapons would only dull, and Durability would decrease if they struck these Earthen Puppets.

[Earthen Puppet] (Special Elite)

Level 27

HP 100,000/100,000

Although there were many Earthen Puppets, Shi Feng could easily outdistance them after activating Windwalk. Once he was a certain distance away, he would simply use Void Steps. As these Earthen Puppets lost their target, they discontinued their pursuit.

After Shi Feng had followed the tracks for over half an hour, he finally discovered his Guild members who were currently resting.

After not seeing each other for more than a day, everyone had leveled by at least one. The lowest leveled player in the team was Level 23. Blackie had even reached Level 26. Their leveling speed was something to behold. On the contrary, Shi Feng had become the lowest leveled player on his team.

When everyone noticed Shi Feng’s arrival, their eyes widened in shock. It was as if they had seen a ghost.

“Guild Leader, how did you manage to get in here?” the Guardian Knight Cola asked, concerned.

They knew full well just how powerful those Earthen Puppets were. Not only did they have high Magic Resistance, but their Defense was also powerful. Their attacks were just as frightening. To kill just one, they had to spend a long time wearing it out. However, those Earthen Puppets respawned indefinitely. Sometimes, if they took too long to kill one another would respawn the moment it died.

Meanwhile, when those Earthen Puppets discovered an enemy, they would not rest until their target was dead. If they did not kill them, these puppets would overwhelm them.

They had spent over half a day to reach their current location, yet, Shi Feng had arrived so casually. Moreover, only two hours had passed since he had started to search for them...

“I ran here, of course,” Shi Feng laughed.

“Guild Leader, did you not encounter any Earthen Puppets?” Aqua Rose asked curiously as she stared at Shi Feng who did not appear exhausted in the slightest.

“I met them, but I managed to throw them off.” Shi Feng smiled. “Alright, let’s not worry about that. Let’s leave.”

“Guild Leader, we can’t leave,” Aqua Rose said, shaking her head. “Previously, when Fire Dance scouted ahead, she discovered a locked Dark-Gold Treasure Chest not far from here. She is currently trying to unlock it, while we’re helping her fend off the patrolling puppets.”

“A locked Dark-Gold Treasure Chest?” Shi Feng could not help his excitement upon hearing those words.

Shi Feng could count on one hand the number of Dark-Gold Treasure Chests he had encountered in the past. Countless Guilds would drool over a Dark-Gold Treasure Chest because there was a certain chance to obtain an Epic item.

Dark-Gold items were extremely rare in God’s Domain at the moment. As for Epic items, most players dared not even dream of owning one. Shi Feng had only obtained a few due to good luck. No other Guild had one.

“Let me have a look at it,” Shi Feng said as he walked over.

The Seven Luminaries Key Shi Feng had obtained from the God’s Grave allowed him to unlock up to three Dark-Gold Treasure Chests. He still had two uses left.

When he arrived at the Dark-Gold Treasure Chest, he noticed Fire Dance trying to unlock it. However, the difficulty of opening a Dark-Gold Treasure Chest was too high. Fire Dance’s Unlock skill level was not insignificant, and she had a very small chance of unlocking a Dark-Gold Treasure Chest. However, after trying over a hundred times, she had not succeeded.

“Let me try.”

Shi Feng walked over and took out the Seven Luminaries Key, inserting it into the ancient magic lock.

In the next moment, a faint blue glow emerged from the Seven Luminaries Key and flowed into the lock. With a click, the chest unlocked.
