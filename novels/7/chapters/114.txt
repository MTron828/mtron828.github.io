Chapter 115 - Egoistic Blade

The Moon Temple was a very well-known Guild in God’s Domain. However, their area of influence was not situated in Star-Moon Kingdom, but instead, the Tulip Empire. The competition between Guilds there was much more intense compared to Star-Moon Kingdom. Meanwhile, the Moon Temple was one of the top few Guilds in Tulip Empire. Compared to Ouroboros, they were much stronger.

The scholarly Lonely Goose in front of Shi Feng right now was also a famous top-tier Swordsman.

It would be advantageous to Shi Feng if he befriended such a person.

“Hello,” Shi Feng nodded his head, giving others a taciturn feeling.

Aside from Lonely Goose, several more players came up and introduced themselves to Shi Feng. They all wished to befriend him. After all, an additional friend meant an additional path they could have in the future. It was especially true for the top-tier experts that could arrive at Blackwing City. As to whether they would become enemies in the future, the possibility of such a situation happening was low.

As for the reason to such a conclusion, up till now, the group of them had yet to see a top-tier expert belonging to the same country as them in Blackwing City. Also, every country was very far apart from each other, and countries coming in touch with each other would be a matter in the far future.

On the other hand, if they could become friends and have a cooperative relationship, then it would be beneficial to both sides.

This was also one of the hidden benefits of Blackwing City.

The bearded man swept a glance at Shi Feng, discovering that Shi Feng’s level was actually the same as his own. Being able to reach Level 7 was an achievement of which he was extremely proud. However, now that he realized he was the same level as an independent player, he immediately felt a sense of provocation. In addition to the other players trying to befriend Shi Feng, the bearded man snorted, “Hmph, he’s just an independent player. What is the point in trying to curry favor with him?”

With the bearded man’s words, the entire atmosphere in the Auction House became tense.

Playing the part of the friendly guy, Lonely Goose said with a smile, “Brother Egoistic Blade, not everyone can easily come to Blackwing City. Is there a need for such a cold treatment? If we can all get along with each other, it would be a great benefit for all of us in the future.”

“Help?”

“Just based on the luck of an independent player, how would he be able to mutually cooperate with us?”

“How can he be of any help to us?”

The disdain in the bearded man’s words kept on growing. The man then flaunted the Guild emblem on his chest, the words “Bloodthirsty War God” written on the emblem. The emblem was silver in color, signifying that the bearded man was at the rank of an elder within the Guild.

Bloodthirsty War God was one of the top three first-rate Guilds in Black Dragon Empire. Bloodthirsty War God was a long-established Guild, its lengthy history tracing back at least 60 years ago. At that time, not even Shi Feng’s parents had been born yet.

Looking at Egoistic Blade behaving so, even Lonely Goose felt helpless about it. He then looked at Shi Feng, apologizing, “Truly sorry. Brother Egoistic Blade doesn’t usually behave this way. Maybe he is in a bad mood today.”

“This should be Brother Black Flame’s first time coming to the Blackwing Auction House, right? You’ve come at a good time. Today just happens to be a day where the Blackwing Auction House is holding an auction. However, if you wish to participate in the auction, you need to purchase a Blackwing Insignia that costs 2 Gold Coins. You will only be allowed entry if you possess the Blackwing Insignia. Furthermore, the players who possess the Blackwing Insignia can bring along two more players with them.”

“How about Brother Black Flame let me bring you into the auction? You could save a big expenditure that way.”

As Shi Feng was about to voice his rejection, Egoistic Blade sneered, “A beggar that can’t even afford a Blackwing Insignia, what right do you have to come along with us?”

“I only have one thing to say. I don’t wish to be together with this little bastard. If you all wish to form an alliance, it’s either me or him. You guys make your choice. Either he goes, or I go.”

Egoistic Blade had the Bloodthirsty War God serving as his background, while Shi Feng had nothing he could rely on. Egoistic Blade was extremely confident that Lonely Goose and the others would choose him without even the need to think.

Only when the strong cooperate with each other, would they be able to bring out the greatest benefits. If they were to cooperate with an independent player, who could guarantee that, after this person’s entry ticket to Blackwing City had been used up, he would still be able to return to Blackwing City. Meanwhile, Egoistic Blade had a first-rate Guild supporting him. It would be tens of thousands of times easier for him to obtain another pass to Blackwing City when compared to a mere independent player.

If Shi Feng did not even possess the ability to frequently visit Blackwing City, how would he be able to guarantee a mutual cooperation?

“Brother Egoistic Blade, must you do so?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lonely Goose and the others could not help but have a headache as they tried to mediate the situation. They only wished to mutually profit from each other. Yet, Egoistic Blade had created such a situation and had even spoken such words. If they chose to accept Shi Feng into their group, then Egoistic Blade would definitely feel humiliated. However, if they accepted Egoistic Blade, then Shi Feng would naturally leave feeling angry and as though he had been crossed.

On one side, it was a first-rate Guild. On the other, it was an independent player. The situation left everyone in a state of distress.

“What are you all hesitating about? Is it such a hard decision to make? I have the Bloodthirsty War God backing me. The information and resources I have at my disposal far exceed what any of you can imagine. If you all do not wish to cooperate, then I can simply look for some other Guilds to cooperate with. No matter what, I don’t wish to see an independent player within our alliance group,” Egoistic Blade looked at Lonely Goose and the others, saying in an extremely displeased manner.

Shi Feng watched Egoistic Blade’s extremely stubborn behavior as if the world revolved solely around him alone. The man was even using the influence of his background in order to chase Shi Feng out of the group. Although Lonely Goose and the others had clearly come up to Shi Feng on their own accord, they now showed signs of hesitation. Seeing this situation, Shi Feng sneered, “Since I’m just an independent player, I won’t trouble you any longer, Brother Lonely Goose. People who walk different paths cannot make plans together. Let us go our separate ways from now on.”

Finished saying so, Shi Feng walked towards the entrance of the Auction House.

Looking at Shi Feng walking away in a huff, Lonely Snow and the others could do nothing but drop the subject. After all, Shi Feng was but an independent player. Although he was an expert, he would not be able to bring them much benefit.

“Hmph, a mere independent player wishes to have the same standing as us? Don’t even dream about it,” Egoistic Blade jeered.

After some time, the gates to the Auction House opened, allowing the masses entry into the building.

When Egoistic Blade and the others walked to the entrance...

“I’m sorry, Sir, but you are not allowed to enter.” A Knight blocked Egoistic Blade and the others.

“Lord Knight, all of us possesses the Blackwing Insignia,” Lonely Goose pointed towards the insignia on his chest, saying.

“The auction held today is the VIP Auction. Commoners are not allowed entry. The normal auction will only be held next week, so please come back again at that time,” the Knight explained.

Egoistic Blade then pointed at Shi Feng, who was currently walking into the Auction House, moodily saying, “Lord Knight, then what right does that person have to enter? He doesn’t even have a Blackwing Insignia on him. It won’t be good if you do something like that, right?”

The Knight became extremely displeased by Egoistic Blade’s attitude. However, he still looked along the direction Egoistic Blade pointed to, discovering the Lord Demon Hunter, Shi Feng. The Knight then swept his gaze at Egoistic Blade and the others, saying in disdain, “Just based on you commoners, you all wish to have the same standing as the Lord Demon Hunter?”

“Be smart and get lost quickly! I’ll have all of you arrested if you continue making a scene!” the Knight angrily yelled at Egoistic Blade and the others.

Egoistic Blade was extremely shocked. How could a random, independent player they met be so awesome? He then thought back to the mocking words said by the Knight. Weren’t they the words he had uttered just now?

If there was a hole available right now, Egoistic Blade wished he could have jumped into it immediately. It was simply too mortifying.

Lonely Goose and the others were even more startled. They looked at Shi Feng with shocked expressions, endless regret filling up their hearts.

After making plenty of investigations, they discovered that there would be an auction held today. Moreover, the items auctioned were extremely rare, so they had paid a huge price in order to prepare a significant amount of Coins. Yet, in the end, they couldn’t even manage to get past the entrance...

Looking at the Knight’s respectful attitude towards Shi Feng, they immediately knew that the title of Demon Hunter must be a very powerful title. Shi Feng definitely would have been able to bring along a few more players with him. However, they had chosen to forsake Shi Feng instead, missing out on the chance to participate in the auction this time around. The regret in their hearts was quickly pushing them to their deaths right now. At that time, just why did they choose to give up on Shi Feng?!

Lonely Goose and the others then thought of Egoistic Blade, the main perpetrator of this disaster. If it weren’t for Egoistic Blade, such an incident would not have happened.

Immediately, everyone turned to look at Egoistic Blade in rage and bitterness.
