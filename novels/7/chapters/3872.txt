Chapter 947 – New Divine Glory List

As the ranking list appeared in the sky, a commotion erupted in the city as many players expressed their disbelief in the placements.

“As expected of the Holy Race. They monopolized the top two spots.”

“Sure enough, the human race is weak. Although three human powers are in the top ten, they’re ranked seventh to ninth.”

“What the hell is up with Zero Wing? It’s not even a pseudo-apex power, yet it’s ranked ninth?”

When the powers of the three races saw the names of the top ten powers, some laughed in ridicule while others were skeptical. It was especially so for the human race’s pseudo-apex powers. They thought they were hallucinating when they saw Zero Wing coming in ninth place.

It was true that Zero Wing’s team had two sixth-floor experts and Black Flame, who could repel four Epic Siege Weapons by himself. However, the various pseudo-apex powers still found it unbelievable that Zero Wing could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Seven Luminaries Alliance and Demon’s Gate.

The Seven Luminaries Alliance was one of the human race’s most ancient powers. Its foundations surpassed those of the average apex power. As for Demon’s Gate, it was an apex power that commanded many experts. Its forces this time were even led by Elise, who had reached the sixth-floor standard. Even so, it only managed to come in eighth place.

In comparison, Zero Wing was a small Guild, and the team it had deployed to the competition was even smaller. Yet, it had surpassed many of the three races’ apex powers and secured ninth place in the competition. This outcome greatly shocked the various human powers.

“Ninth?” Lunar River fell silent as she stared at the ranking list.

Originally, Lunar River had expected King’s Paradise to enter the top 10, obtaining a Great Lord Token in addition to an Eternal World Magic Array. If King’s Paradise could secure a Great Lord Token, it would be able to establish itself in the Eternal Realm immediately. In the end, however, King’s Paradise secured only four plots of land. It even nearly lost its fourth plot to an apex power.

In contrast, Zero Wing had secured six plots of land and placed ninth in the competition. This outcome made her previous words to Shi Feng a complete joke.

…

Only ninth? Shi Feng was surprised as he looked at the rankings. Was the competition that intense?

In his opinion, Zero Wing had obtained an impressive amount of tokens. According to his memories, the champions of Everlasting City’s competition in his previous life never got more than 90,000 tokens. Yet, despite collecting 86,487 tokens, Zero Wing only came in ninth place. The intensity of the competition was simply terrifying.

…

While Shi Feng was surprised by the competition’s outcome, the powers of the three races etched Zero Wing’s name into their minds, and they no longer regarded it as a nobody.

Although Zero Wing had entered the competition with less than 700 members, its team comprised two Mortal Gods and more than ten Half-step Mortal Gods.[1] Not even royal powers could necessarily come up with such a lineup. Not to mention, there was also Black Flame.

After transforming into a Primordial Dragon, Black Flame had single-handedly repelled the Epic Siege Weapons of four royal powers. Such a battle record was unprecedented in the three races’ history. It was also an unforgettable record. After all, Black Flame’s fight against the four Epic Siege Weapons was beyond spectacular and exciting. Many players had recorded the battle and planned to study it carefully. They also felt their experience gave them bragging rights.

…

“Zero Wing! Black Flame!” Slumbering Vocalist glared at Shi Feng’s figure aboard the Silver Wing Flying Ship. “Just you wait! It won’t be long before Evil Nature will make you regret everything you did today!”

After saying so, Slumbering Vocalist got on his Flying Mount and flew away from Everlasting City with Evil Nature’s members. He had no intention of lingering in Everlasting City for even a moment longer.

…

“Elder Martial, the Holy Race’s and the Crystallian race’s apex and royal powers have left. Can we return to Shadowring Town now?” Verdant Rainbow asked impatiently.

The magnitude of the battles in Everlasting City’s competition was dozens of times greater than that of the Continental Championship. Besides Mortal Gods, many Half-step Mortal Gods also appeared in the competition. Just the number of Half-step Mortal Gods she fought in the competition already exceeded ten. Moreover, these experts had different combat styles, making her fights with them very fruitful. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She wanted nothing more than to plunge into the Tower of the Abyss to digest the experience she had gained.

“I understand your urge to consolidate your gains, but the Tower of the Abyss will have to come later. We have more pressing matters right now,” Elder Martial said, looking at the Holy Race’s and the Crystallian race’s departing powers. “We must quickly return and strengthen our defenses to prepare for the inevitable!”

“Already?” Verdant Rainbow exclaimed.

“I still wasn’t sure before, but I am now, after this competition,” Elder Martial said solemnly. “Whether it is the Crystallian race or the Holy Race, they are likely to attack us soon since they have the numerical advantage when it comes to Level 220-plus experts. If they miss this opportunity and let us bridge the gap, they will have much greater difficulty dealing with us in the future.”

“I understand.” Verdant Rainbow grew serious after hearing Elder Martial’s statement. “I will head back and strengthen our defenses immediately.”

…

On the other side, Shi Feng returned to Shadowring Town with his team after the conclusion of Everlasting City’s competition. Upon returning, he promptly had Hidden Soul deliver the promised Intermediate Divine Pattern Scrolls to Purgatory Jade. He also had Gentle Snow start a mass recruitment for Zero Wing. Then, he locked himself up in a workshop and studied the Dragon-Hunting Artillery design he had obtained from the remnant primordial world.

According to his memories, the first Everlasting City competition was a precursor of the war between the Holy Race and the human race. The battle that followed the competition was also the most crucial in the war.

This battle was unlike any of the skirmishes that had occurred before. It was a siege in the truest sense, spearheaded by the Holy Race’s NPCs. The Holy Race’s armies, comprising players and NPCs, besieged many NPC Cities inhabited by human players.

In his previous life, this initial battle led to over 70% of the human race’s NPC Cities on the Eternal Continent falling under the control of Holy Race NPCs. Many Guild Towns faced destruction as well. This situation greatly reduced the scope of human players’ activities in the Eternal Realm. As a result, human players could only travel on foot to many of the Eternal Realm’s high-level maps. It also became impossible for human powers to compete over maps with ancient ruins.

Now that the first Everlasting City competition had concluded, the Holy Race could launch its invasion anytime. With Shadowring Town having the Tower of the Abyss, it went without saying that it would become the Holy Race’s priority target. If Zero Wing did not immediately strengthen Shadowring Town’s defenses, the town might not even survive the Holy Race’s initial siege, let alone the Void Beast Tide.

As Zero Wing began to recruit members, half a day went by quickly. At this time, the Seven Luminaries Alliance suddenly updated its Divine Glory List. The new list saw dramatic changes in its entries and placements. It was especially so for the top ten players. Only two out of the original top ten players remained, the change sending shockwaves across the human race’s Greater God’s Domain.
