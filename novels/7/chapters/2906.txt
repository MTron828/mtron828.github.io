Chapter 2907 – Taking on a Three-star Mental Strength Master

Bang!

Along with the sound of an explosion, the ambient air fluctuated, and even those standing more than ten meters away from Shi Feng and Fu Jiuzhong felt these shock waves.

The next moment, Fu Jiuzhong’s punch came to an abrupt end, while Shi Feng stumbled several steps back before he managed to stabilize his body.

The outcome of the initial confrontation between the two mental strength masters was clear for all to see. However, this result had Han Yifeng and the others looking at Shi Feng in shock and disbelief.

He blocked it!? How did he do it?!

Fu Jiuzhong’s punch was akin to a behemoth’s attack. One could tell how much power the punch carried just by looking at the shattered stone slabs under Fu Jiuzhong’s feet.

The Upper Zone’s pavement was extraordinary, its hardness comparable to steel. Even a Henglian grandmaster’s full-powered attack would, at most, crack it. Yet, the stone slabs directly under Fu Jiuzhong’s feet had basically disintegrated, while the adjacent slabs had web-like cracks spread across them. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Fu Jiuzhong’s punch could probably knock a car back over a dozen meters. The attack undoubtedly reached inhuman levels already.

What did he do just now? Qin Baiyi stared at the uninjured Shi Feng in confusion.

Compared to the other spectators, Qin Baiyi had a far better understanding of how much power Fu Jiuzhong’s punch carried. An entry-level mental strength master would be fortunate to sustain only minor injuries from the punch, let alone emerge intact.

Typically, if the average human removed all of the limiters restricting their body, they could lift an entire car. Meanwhile, Fu Jiuzhong was a mental strength master who had tempered his body over several decades. One could easily imagine how much power he could exert if he removed his limiters and concentrated all his strength into his fist.

Of course, executing such a move would also place a huge burden on the body. If an ordinary person tried replicating Fu Jiuzhong’s move without having absolute control over their physical body, they would most likely end up crippled afterward. This was because the limiters the brain placed was a form of protection for one’s body. However, it was a different story for mental strength masters of Fu Jiuzhong’s caliber.

Currently, not only did Fu Jiuzhong have perfect control over his body’s strength, but he could also freely turn his body’s limiters on and off. So long as he turned off his limiters the moment he attacked and instantly turned them back on after executing his attack, he could minimize the damage to his body. He might even be able to offset the damage completely by using his body’s resilience.

This was also what made three-star mental strength masters so frightening. On the other hand, Shi Feng was evidently incapable of removing all of his body’s limiters right now. Yet, by relying on a strange technique and incredible speed, he had successfully blocked Fu Jiuzhong’s punch. More precisely, he had deflected the power of the Infinity Master’s punch and received only part of the attack’s power and impact. This feat was simply incredible.

In reality, Qin Baiyi wasn’t the only one surprised by this outcome. Shi Feng himself felt shocked and ecstatic. He never thought his plan would succeed. Although he had failed to fully replicate Sword’s Transmigration just now, the incomplete technique still allowed him to resist Fu Jiuzhong’s full-powered blow. However, Shi Feng now felt his mind stagnating slightly, due to using Sword’s Transmigration with his mortal body. His brain had evidently overloaded itself to enable his body to execute the technique.

He diverted my strength?

Fu Jiuzhong eyed Shi Feng in incomprehension. He couldn’t understand how Shi Feng’s two strange chopping strikes had managed to scatter the power in his fist. At the moment of contact, he had felt some kind of power invade his body and deform his posture slightly. This, in turn, caused the power of his punch to plummet and allowed Shi Feng to escape unscathed.

Was it luck?

Fu Jiuzhong shook his head, dismissing his thoughts. He promptly dashed toward Shi Feng and executed a flurry of punches, giving him no time to catch a breather or create another miracle.

Fu Jiuzhong had come to Yuantian City’s Upper Zone intending to teach Shi Feng a lesson, have Shi Feng give up a significant portion of Zero Wing’s shares, and avenge his student. After seeing Shi Feng’s potential, though, he realized there was no way the young man would give up Zero Wing’s shares.

However, reconciliation between them wasn’t possible after Fu Jiuzhong had sent the various corporations’ experts after Shi Feng. Fu Jiuzhong also couldn’t forgive the arrogant behavior Shi Feng took in front of him.

Hence, only one path remained open to Fu Jiuzhong-crippling Shi Feng and utilizing his mental deterrence to arouse Shi Feng’s inner fears. Even if Shi Feng was a mental strength master, this would still leave an indelible trauma in his heart. If that happened, Shi Feng’s future as a mental strength master would be over. And while Fu Jiuzhong would suffer repercussions from the Green God Company afterward, the penalty wouldn’t be anything severe. After all, there was no way the Green God Company would choose to lose a three-star mental strength master after already losing a young talent.

Fu Jiuzhong executed his punches with all his might, without a fixed pattern. Of course, with how fast his attacks were, Fu Jiuzhong couldn’t concentrate all his strength into every punch. Hence, the punches he currently executed were significantly weaker than his first one. Even so, they still weren’t attacks an ordinary mental strength master could receive.

Afterimages of Fu Jiuzhong’s fists filled the space between Fu Jiuzhong and Shi Feng. Even ordinary mental strength masters, who could amplify their perception by more than tenfold, couldn’t adequately capture every one of these punches with their senses.

Is he nuts?

Shi Feng’s complexion changed as he faced Fu Jiuzhong’s attacks.

Even an expert of Fu Jiuzhong’s caliber would suffer serious injuries if he executed so many attacks without any limiters. The fact that he was doing so was simply ridiculous.

However, Shi Feng also had to admit that Fu Jiuzhong’s attacks were effective. He could hardly keep up with the attacks, let alone execute Sword’s Transmigration to deflect them.

When Fu Jiuzhong’s punches were about to reach him, Shi Feng gritted his teeth and liberated the limiters on his muscles once more. He then brandished his arms as if they were two longswords.

Sword’s Orbit!

Bang... Bang... Bang...

Less than one meter separated Fu Jiuzhong and Shi Feng as they clashed in front of the Green God Tower. Although none of the surrounding pedestrians could see the arms of either mental strength master, the numerous thunderous explosions and shock waves made everyone feel as if they were standing in a storm.

Two seconds into the clash, Shi Feng began retreating step by step, evidently at a disadvantage. And although Shi Feng had successfully deflected all of Fu Jiuzhong’s punches thus far, his complexion grew paler and paler as time passed.

“Let’s see how long you can last!” Fu Jiuzhong sneered when he saw Shi Feng’s poor complexion.

Although Fu Jiuzhong was sustaining heavy damage by executing so many attacks with his limiters fully liberated, the damage wasn’t unbearable. At worst, he would have to consume Life Potions for a month, but all his injuries would eventually disappear as if they never existed. However, it was a different story for Shi Feng. If the young man failed to hold on now, he would be crippled in the future.

The seconds ticked by one after another. Qin Baiyi, who was watching the entire fight, grew increasingly anxious.

“Senior Brother, is there nothing you can do?” Weiyang Qianhen asked when she saw Shi Feng’s ashen face.

In a frustrated tone, Qin Baiyi responded, “I want to step in, but the fight between them is no longer at a level where I can intervene. I might even make the situation worse for Shi Feng. All we can do is wait for Teacher to arrive.”

Qin Baiyi wanted nothing more than to intervene in the fight, but he simply lacked the ability to do so. After all, even after pushing his senses to their limits, he still couldn’t keep up with Shi Feng’s and Fu Jiuzhong’s movements. If he charged in recklessly, he might get sent flying by some random attack.

Ten seconds into the fight, Fu Jiuzhong’s complexion began turning red, while Shi Feng’s turned deathly pale. A look of deep fatigue also surfaced in Shi Feng’s eyes, and it was evident he could last only a few more seconds.

“Die!”

Fu Jiuzhong accelerated his punches when he noticed Shi Feng faltering. He planned to end the fight right here and now.

Upon seeing this, Qin Baiyi reflexively closed his eyes, while Weiyang Qianhen’s complexion turned grim. Just as Fu Jiuzhong’s fists were about to overwhelm Shi Feng’s defense, a rebuke suddenly echoed in everyone’s ears.

“Both of you, stop fighting this instant!”

Although this voice wasn’t deafening, it still stimulated everyone’s mind and compelled them to obedience.

Among those present, only Fu Jiuzhong, Shi Feng, and Qin Baiyi remained mostly unaffected by the voice. However, immediately afterward, an incomparably powerful mental deterrence assaulted Fu Jiuzhong and Shi Feng, causing them to stumble back several steps.

This scene amazed the surrounding spectators, and everyone couldn’t help wondering about the identity of the voice’s owner.

When everyone turned toward the voice’s origin, what they saw were two people walking out of the Green God Tower’s entrance. One was a beautiful woman with her black hair tied into a ponytail, and the other was a white-clad old man walking with a hunched back and a cane.

Most of the people present quickly recognized the woman. She was none other than Xia Qingying, the base layer’s general manager. The old man Xia Qingying was supporting, though, was someone unfamiliar to them. Only Qin Baiyi recognized the old man, and he couldn’t help a look of panic and disbelief at seeing the old man. Looking at the approaching old man, Fu Jiuzhong gnashed his teeth and yelled, “Wuyuan! I’m only teaching an arrogant kid a lesson! Are you going to interfere in this as well?!”

The white-clad old man’s name was Xia Wuyuan. In addition to being the middle-layer general manager of Yuantian City’s Upper Zone, he was also a bona fide three-star mental strength master, someone with real authority in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone. Rumor had it that he was only half a step away from becoming a mental strength grandmaster.

However, for Fu Jiuzhong, who had just recently become a three-star mental strength master, Xia Wuyuan wasn’t an existence to fear.

“Jiuzhong, this is Yuantian City’s Upper Zone. Do you take this place for a joke?” Xia Wuyuan said as he glanced at Fu Jiuzhong. “This matter ends here. Shi Feng is already a talent Yuantian City’s Upper Zone has set its eyes on. I won’t sit still if you persist in making a scene.”

Xia Wuyuan’s words thundered in Fu Jiuzhong’s ears, causing his expression to turn ugly. Fu Jiuzhong then glared at Shi Feng and said coldly, “Consider yourself lucky today, kid! However, don’t think you’ll be as lucky next time!”

After saying so, Fu Jiuzhong got back into his maglev car together with Lu Tiandi and departed the area, disinclined to exchange any more words with Xia Wuyuan.

“Teacher, are we going to let Shi Feng go, just like that?” Lu Tiandi asked. With them having thoroughly offended Shi Feng, if they didn’t cripple Shi Feng now, he would definitely become a thorn in their side with his extraordinary potential.

After taking a deep breath, Fu Jiuzhong shook his head and said, “That old ghost is already close to crossing that threshold. I can’t go up against him. However, that doesn’t mean I’ll let that kid off. After I apply for Three-star High Grade authority and get it approved, I’ll have one chance to train in the core area and solidify my gains. Once that happens, that kid won’t be able to stop me as easily as he did today!”

Lu Tiandi breathed out a sigh of relief at Fu Jiuzhong’s words.

If Fu Jiuzhong could train in the Upper Zone’s core area even for a short period, he would definitely return stronger and would have a much easier time dealing with Shi Feng. Most importantly, Fu Jiuzhong could afford to do a lot more things once he gained Three-star High Grade authority.

Meanwhile, after Fu Jiuzhong and Lu Tiandi left, Shi Feng hurriedly approached Xia Qingying and Xia Wuyuan to thank them. If not for Xia Wuyuan’s intervention, Shi Feng really would’ve succumbed to Fu Jiuzhong’s attacks.

This little fellow has quite the talent, Xia Wuyuan thought to himself as he scrutinized Shi Feng. He then said, “Qingying mentioned you to me before. She said you were even more talented than Baiyi. I initially thought she was joking, so it is fortunate I had some business here today. Otherwise, Fu Jiuzhong would’ve crippled you.”

“Thank you for helping me, Elder Xia. Thank you as well, General Manager Xia,” Shi Feng said as he looked at Xia Wuyuan and Xia Qingying

Nodding at Shi Feng, Xia Qingying said, “You really surprised me. Although I’ve long since known you would become a mental strength master sooner or later, I didn’t expect you to break through in such a short time. It seems I didn’t invite my grandfather here in vain.”

Shi Feng grew a little awkward after hearing Xia Qingying’s words, unsure of how to explain himself. After all, his rapid growth was a complete accident. “Ahem, that’s enough talking. You’ll have plenty of chances to talk in the future,” Xia Wuyuan said, faking a cough. He then looked at Shi Feng and said, “Kid, now that you’ve become a mental strength master, come with me to the middle layer!”
