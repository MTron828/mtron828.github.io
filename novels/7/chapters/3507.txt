Chapter 3508 – Chapter 582 – Demon of Swords

“Human parties?” A look of interest appeared on the young man with patterned eyes. Then, he turned to the fair-skinned girl with an indifferent face standing next to him and asked, “Are there any noteworthy experts among them, Feather?”

“You jest, Lord Thunder. There are no noteworthy experts among humans. They are merely a bunch of ants,” the girl named Extreme Feather responded. “Currently, only the chosen ones nurtured by the humans’ apex powers can put up a fight against me. Every other human is unlikely to survive a single move from me.”

“Is that so?” The young man named Royal Thunder couldn’t help but lose interest after hearing Extreme Feather’s answer. Then, he turned back to the middle-aged man and said, “In that case, quickly take care of those human parties. I don’t wish to waste time on them.”

Royal Thunder had no doubts about Extreme Feather’s words. Extreme Feather was one of the Nine Great Chosen Ones under his command, and she was one of the key figures assisting him in securing his position within his family.

!!

When he initially heard that there were human players nearby, his first thought was to find a noteworthy opponent among them for Extreme Feather. After all, only by fighting strong opponents could Extreme Feather grow quicker. But if the opponents were merely insignificant ants, there was no need to waste time on them.

“Understood!” the solemn middle-aged man responded before flying away with a thousand Holy Race experts.

…

Meanwhile, a little over two thousand yards away, the various human parties operating on the Plain of Fallen Gods had gathered together. Every party had used a Tier 5 Group Isolation Scroll to conceal their presence. Unless one came very close to these parties, even fifth-floor experts would have difficulty noticing them.

“It seems the other side has discovered us, Pivot,” a robust man riding atop a Tier 5 Void Manta commented when he saw the thousand or so Holy Race experts flying over from a distance. Then, he looked at a nearby male Summoner and smiled, saying, “Will you be needing our help this time?”

“Careful not to eat your own words, Fire Bull,” Sky Pivot said in exasperation as he looked at the robust man. “According to Seven Luminaries Town’s party rankings, Dawnlight is one rank above Fire Demon. You should be more concerned about your own party right now.”

In Seven Luminaries Town, the Fire Demon Party and the Dawn Light Party could be considered rivals. However, not once did the Fire Demon Party ever manage to surpass the Dawnlight Party in rankings.

“Times have changed, Pivot,” the robust man named Fire Bull said with a nonchalant smile. “Our party has recently welcomed a strong newcomer, so our strength is no longer the same as before. Not to mention, didn’t Dawnlight lose two members some time ago?”

“Do you think your party is the only one with new members?” Sky Pivot said disdainfully.

“Hey, not everyone is equal,” Fire Bull said before delightedly pointing at a female Swordsman with an enticing figure. “Our newcomer is extraordinary. While she might be young in age, she has already reached the Half-step Tier 6 standard. Even an old guy like you might have a tough time against her.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Hello, Party Leader Sky Pivot. I am Cang Sha, the Fire Demon Party’s newest member,” Cang Sha introduced herself to Sky Pivot in a seductive voice. “I am still new to Seven Luminaries Town, so I hope you can look out for me in the future.”

“Hello. I am Sky Pivot, the Dawnlight Party’s leader,” Sky Pivot hurriedly introduced himself as well when he saw how polite Cang Sha was.

Cang Sha? While looking at the Fire Demon Party’s seductive new member, Shi Feng suddenly recalled a name from his previous life.

Demon of Swords, Cang Sha!

She was one of the chosen ones nurtured by the apex power Demon’s Gate. She became a three-star mental strength grandmaster at a very young age, and she was also the youngest person to become a Taboo in Demon’s Gate’s history. However, outside of Demon’s Gate, few people had ever seen Cang Sha’s true appearance. It wasn’t even possible to find Cang Sha’s battle records through public means. Even so, the Seven Luminaries Alliance had awarded Cang Sha the title of Demon of Swords and described her as an existence on par with the Ten Great Sword Gods.

At one point during Shi Feng’s previous life, the Midnight Tea Party’s legendary existence, Endless Scars, fought Cang Sha. Although Endless Scars did not disclose the fight’s result, Shi Feng did learn one thing from Endless Scars.

Only Primordial Gods could defeat Cang Sha!

The evaluation stunned Shi Feng when he first heard it.

Primordial Gods were existences standing at the very apex of God’s Domain. Even among players regarded as Taboos, very few could put up a fight against Primordial Gods, let alone stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Primordial Gods.

While Shi Feng wondered about Cang Sha’s true identity, Fire Bull, the Fire Demon Party’s leader, directed his Void Manta closer to the Dawnlight Party.

“What do you think, Pivot? Look at how polite our newcomer is!” Fire Bull boasted. “I can also tell you that Cang Sha isn’t just polite. She can absolutely stun you once she takes action. So long as your party is willing to admit defeat, we wouldn’t mind helping you out this time. Otherwise, you might not even get past the city gates before getting sent back to the Eternal Continent.”

“Stun me?” Sky Pivot couldn’t help but laugh. Then, he pointed at Shi Feng and said, “Do you know who our party’s newcomer is?”

“Who is he?” Fire Bull responded with an expression of disdain.

“Black Flame! The Lord of War Goddesses ranked eleventh on the Sacred Glory List!” Sky Pivot proudly stated. “Once those Holy Race experts arrive, just watch as we enter the city ahead of you!”

Sky Pivot wasn’t worried about the approaching Holy Race experts.

Aerial combat was different from ground combat. It was especially so when everyone currently lacked the ability to fly on their own on the Western Continent. In such a situation, it was easy for several hundred players to form an impenetrable encirclement on the ground.

However, in the air, where everyone had to rely on Flying Mounts to stay airborne, the best the Holy Race experts could accomplish was to have several players attack from up close. Everyone else could only rely on long-range bombardment. In such a situation, their party could simply rely on defensive magic arrays to defend against incoming attacks while they charged into the city.

Meanwhile, once they entered the city, the monsters that infested the city would greatly diminish the advantage of numbers. At that time, the Holy Race players would have a much more difficult time keeping them pinned.

“Eleventh on the Sacred Glory List?” Fire Bull laughed.

Fire Bull had previously thought the Dawnlight Party had recruited someone incredible for Sky Pivot to boast about so much. However, it would seem that he had overestimated his old rival and the Dawnlight Party as a whole. The party must be in dire straits if it was treating a Sacred Glory expert as a treasure.

“Black Flame?”

Meanwhile, Cang Sha’s gaze promptly locked onto Shi Feng when she heard Sky Pivot’s words, and she couldn’t help but lick her lips as she scrutinized Shi Feng. “How interesting. So, you are Zero Wing’s Guild Leader? I wonder what would become of Zero Wing if I were to kill you now?”

Cang Sha’s words were like the Devil’s whispers, sending shivers down the spines of everyone present. Everyone felt as if a sharp sword was hanging over their heads, ready to fall and claim their lives at any moment.
