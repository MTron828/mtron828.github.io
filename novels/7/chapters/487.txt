Chapter 488 - Young Genius

Although Everlasting War had already spoken, his companions had frowned in response to Shi Feng’s reply.

They had never expected that Shi Feng would try to negotiate.

Countless people yearn to join a competition of such level. Yet, even many of the experts on the God’s Domain Experts List had been rejected. They were already stooping pretty low by willingly inviting an unknown expert such as Shi Feng.

Even world-renowned players fought to join the Dark Arena. Participating in the Dark Arena was already a supreme honor in and of itself. Not only could one win endless riches, but they could also receive the admiration of millions. It was even possible for one to become an international celebrity with a single battle.

Not even the ruler of Star-Moon Kingdom was a match for the Dark Arena’s participants in terms of status. After all, that was a stage at the international level.

Thoughtful Rain and Blue Bamboo’s little jaws hung in shock, their eyes filled with disbelief as they watched Shi Feng.

The competition between Guilds in God’s Domain was intense. Almost every Guild was supported by many corporations. However, not even the backer of a first-rate Guild could compare with international corporations; it was merely an ant in the eyes of such giants.

Although the virtual gaming industry’s total value rose with each passing year, it was still significantly inferior to other top industries. If a Guild could obtain the financial support from such a corporation, they could instantly become a Super Guild, surpassing any first-rate Guild in God’s Domain.

With such a good opportunity at hand, Shi Feng actually had a condition...

However, Shi Feng did not care about what others thought about him. Taking a sip of tea, he returned his gaze to Everlasting War, saying slowly, “My request is very simple. I hear that each battle team participating in the Dark Arena consists of ten members. Seeing as you only have six members at the moment, I wish to invite three of my people to join. That way, we will have a full battle team. What do you think?”

“You must be insane! Just inviting you is already Leader’s limit, yet, you still want to invite three others to join the team? Who do you think started this battle team?” a youth of in black armor shot up from his seat in anger.

The other members of Everlasting War’s party were also clearly angry. Everlasting War, on the other hand, watched Shi Feng seriously.

The member limit for each battle team had only been recently confirmed, so only an extremely small group of people know this information. How did Shi Feng, an upper-manager of a small Guild, find out about this?

Suddenly, Everlasting War realized that the young man before him was shrouded in mystery.

“The only goal of the corporation sponsoring your battle team is to secure victory. Naturally, the stronger the chosen team members are, the better. I can guarantee that the players I want to include are all very formidable,” Shi Feng explained.

Although Shi Feng had not personally participated in the Dark Arena, he had a certain understanding of it. After all, it was the future battlefield for the apex experts of God’s Domain. He had learned plenty of techniques from the matches held in the Dark Arena. For example, he had learned Void Steps from watching the Dark Arena’s battle videos.

If he could allow the experts of the Guild to participate in the Dark Arena and experience those battles, it will enable them to improve their techniques further.

“Brother Ye Feng, I am afraid that I am really powerless on this matter. There are a limited number of slots for the battle team. Although I am the team leader, I only have one invitation for the test, not the member slot for the battle team. Originally, I intended to test Guild Leader Black Flame’s qualifications. However, even if he is qualified, I believe that, as the leader of a Guild, he should be very busy with its management. Even if he has the strength, he should not have that much time to spare. That’s why I wanted to invite Brother Ye Feng,” Everlasting War said, smiling bitterly.

The competition between these international corporations was extremely intense. Every position on the battle team was unimaginably precious, so how could they give them away to Shi Feng so easily?

“I expected as much. Alright, I accept your invitation. When will the test be held?” Shi Feng nodded. He knew how valuable the slot was. The invitation alone had already greatly surprised him. However, he still wanted to know how much power Everlasting War, this battle team’s leader, wielded. If he could obtain another slot, he would have truly profited.

“The unified testing time has yet to be determined. Let’s add each other as friends for now. Once those in charge have decided on a time, I will contact Brother Ye Feng immediately.” Everlasting War promptly sent a friend request to the Swordsman before him.

After Shi Feng added Everlasting War as a friend, they chatted about matters relating to the Dark Arena. Seated by the side, Blue Bamboo was utterly stunned by the two’s conversation. She had never imagined that Zero Wing was so amazing. It had actually received an invitation from an international corporation. If the Guild received support from such a corporation, its potential would be unimaginable.

Blue Bamboo’s decision to join Zero Wing solidified.

After both sides chatted for another half an hour or so, Everlasting War’s group departed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Big Brother Everlasting, there are countless experts in God’s Domain. Aside from Black Flame, how could you invite Ye Feng so casually? What if he fails to pass the test when the time comes? It won’t look good to our superiors. Why don’t we head over to Star-Moon City and take a look? There might be some other amazing experts there,” a beautiful female Elementalist wearing crimson robes suggested.

“I know. Our superiors gave me an invitation slot precisely because they wish to test my judgment and to see whether or not I am suited to lead this team. They will definitely replace me if I fail. Knowing this, I won’t act recklessly. However, this Ye Feng is indeed amazing. Based on his appearance, I’m guessing he is only around 20 years old. Yet, when he moves, not a single action reveals a weak point. There were not even any excess actions in his movement. I have already been in the Refinement Realm for close to 27 years already, so I can tell that he has clearly already set foot into the Refinement Realm. Moreover, his progression into the realm is also not shallow. This Ye Feng is simply unbelievable. He is truly a young genius.

“As for Black Flame, I have already watched his battle videos. Although Black Flame is indeed amazing, his performance shows that he has only taken half a step into the Refinement Realm. He only displays such overwhelming might due to his equipment and Skills.

“With the power backing me, I can easily obtain things such as top-tier equipment. Otherwise, I would not have chosen Ye Feng. Refinement Realm experts are as rare as phoenix feathers in God’s Domain. We are already very lucky to have encountered one. Even if we went to Star-Moon City, it is unlikely that we will find another such expert. Alright, let’s return to leveling up for now.”

His teammates could not help their surprise after listening to Everlasting War’s reasoning. They had not realized that Everlasting War had such a high opinion of Shi Feng. However, they also had to admit the scarcity of Refinement Realm experts. Even the five of them had only taken half a step into that realm.

After Everlasting War and his party left, Shi Feng turned to Thoughtful Rain, thanking her, “I am truly grateful for Miss Rain’s help today. If not for your introduction, I would not have such a fortuitous opportunity. If Miss Rain wishes to purchase equipment for yourself, I can offer a 50% discount.”

“Really?” Thoughtful Rain knew how expensive top-tier equipment was on the market. Moreover, top-tier equipment was not necessarily available. If she could purchase top-tier equipment at a 50% discount, she could save tens of thousands of Credits with each item. She could save over a million Credits if she bought an entire set. In addition, the equipment available on the market was nowhere near as good as Zero Wing’s equipment.

“Of course,” Shi Feng laughed.

“Great! I want to buy a set, then. Also, my best friend here, Blue Bamboo, has always been very interested in joining Zero Wing. However, as she has only recently started playing virtual reality games, she’s not very strong. Can you perhaps allow her to join?” Thoughtful Rain asked meekly.

“I’m afraid I really cannot help you with that. Not even an upper-manager like myself is allowed to bend the Guild’s rules,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “However, I can allow your friend to join and train herself with our Guild’s elite parties, having her learn the combat techniques of God’s Domain. Once she’s sufficiently strong, she can then become an official member of Zero Wing. What do you think?”

“I’ll do it! I’ll go!” Originally, Blue Bamboo had been extremely disappointed when she heard Shi Feng’s initial refusal. However, being able to improve herself with the elites of Zero Wing was not a bad alternative.
