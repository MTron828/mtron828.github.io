Chapter 178 - Super Dark-Gold Rank

Since Shi Feng attempted to contact her, Gentle Snow would not reject the call. In any case, there was still some time before the new batch of Whetstones would arrive.

“Busy man, you finally have the time to contact me?” Gentle Snow laughed softly after the call connected.

“You jest, Miss Snow. I am helpless about this as well. I was worried that my communicator would ring endlessly and distract me, so I simply turned it off. Didn’t I immediately contact Miss Snow after I finished with my matters?” Shi Feng smiled.

From Gentle Snow’s tone, Shi Feng could somewhat discern her aggrieved feelings. However, he was simply helpless with this.

He had spent quite a long time conquering White River City. Moreover, he needed to waste even more time. After all, if he published the White River City Guidebook shortly after he entered White River City, others would become highly suspicious. Without spending some time, how could he conduct an investigation? If he made the guidebook without any prior investigation, it would be strange if nobody suspected him.

Hence, Shi Feng intentionally took such a long time before he initiated contact, letting others think that he used this time to inspect White River City.

“Since you’ve come looking for me, it means that you’ve seen my message regarding the information about White River City. What are your thoughts? Name a price; I’ll buy it all,” Gentle Snow said seriously.

If she could obtain information about White River City, she could prepare ahead of time. This way, they could get a huge lead on the other Guilds. As for the matter of money, she rarely paid any mind. Moreover, she believed that Shi Feng would not just set a random price.

“I’ve already compiled a guidebook with information about White River City. The guidebooks are divided into two versions; a simplified version and a luxury version. I’m prepared to publish and sell them on the official forums after some time,” Shi Feng nodded as he spoke.

Gentle Snow was at a loss when she heard Shi Feng. She couldn’t help but admit that Shi Feng was too good at grasping business opportunities. If Shi Feng truly did such a thing, in addition to his identity as the first player to enter White River City, the legitimacy of the White River City Guidebooks were surely guaranteed. The various large Guilds would all compete for them.

She had to admit that even she admired Shi Feng’s business acumen.

There were countless Guilds, both large and small, within the White River City region. A rough estimate would put the number at over a thousand. Even if Shi Feng earned only a thousand Credits from each of these Guilds, he could still earn well over a million Credits. When she heard of him mention a simplified version, it was clearly meant for average players. There would definitely be countless players purchasing it, so Shi Feng would earn quite a lot from them as well.

Just by collecting information for a few hours, in addition to his title as the Number One of White River City, Shi Feng had already made a net profit of several million in a single night. It was possible that only Shi Feng was capable of such a feat.

“I can’t help but praise your idea. However, I wish to obtain this information in advance. Of course, I will pay a higher price. To put it another way, I hope that you can delay the information’s release for three or four hours. Not only will I purchase the information at a high price, but I am also willing to pay a million Credits as a postponement fee. I wonder if that would be possible?” Gentle Snow inquired, smiling.

“A one million Credits postponement fee, is it?”

Shi Feng was truly shocked. Originally, by contacting Gentle Snow, he merely intended to sell the White River City Guidebook to her in advance. He didn’t think that Gentle Snow would have a move like this. He could not help but appreciate her intelligence. In actuality, even if Gentle Snow did not pay any compensation, he would still delay the release of the guidebooks by two or three hours. That way, the credibility of the guidebooks would be even higher.

At the same time, it would increase those Guilds’ urgency. After all, they were already close to reaching Level 10, so they were in dire need of information about White River City.

“Is it not enough? Then two million should be fine, right?” Gentle Snow wrinkled her eyebrows slightly, feeling that Shi Feng was somewhat too greedy for money.

“No, one million is enough. It’s just... I wonder if you want the simplified version or the luxury version?” Shi Feng teased with a laugh.

“Do you even need to ask? The more detailed, the better,” Gentle Snow rolled her eyes at Shi Feng.

She was even willing to spend a million Credits as an extension fee, so would she even lack that kind of money?

“That would be the luxury version then. I’m selling it for 20,000 Credits. As a matter of fact, I still have a super-luxury version of the guidebook in my possession. I wonder if Miss Snow would be interested in it?” Shi Feng smiled as he asked.

“A super-luxury version? How much do you want for it?” Gentle Snow responded, slightly contemptuous.

“One million!” Shi Feng said earnestly.

“The luxury version is selling for 20,000 Credits, but you’re selling the super-luxury version for one million Credits? Are you taking me for a fool?” Gentle Snow accused.

“How could that be? I’ve poured my blood into making it. If you don’t want it, so be it. It is similarly sufficient to purchase just the luxury version,” Shi Feng was only filled with kind intentions.

He would add some of the truly important information to the super-luxury version. For example, information pertaining to the matter of how to quickly develop oneself and information about the various daily quests available in White River City that could quickly increase one’s level and reputation. Although it was not a lot of information, the help it provided was still considerable. It was enough to allow Gentle Snow to pull ahead of the other Guilds by a great distance.

Originally, Shi Feng did not intend to sell this information. However, Gentle Snow was a slightly special case.

The main reason was that Ouroboros, the Guild Gentle Snow belonged to, did not have any conflicts with him. After all, Ouroboros’ main power was based in the capital city, Star-Moon City. Gentle Snow would, sooner or later, have to head to the capital to continue her development. Right now, he simply offered Gentle Snow a favor. In the future, if he were to meet with trouble, he might even be able to get Gentle Snow to help him. After all, the competition in White River City was bound to be intense. If some large Guild intentionally targeted his own while his tasks swamped him, he could ask Gentle Snow for assistance. With Gentle Snow’s personality, she would definitely lend him a hand.

Also, another reason Shi Feng did such a thing was to disperse the attention from himself. Destruction always pursued the great. If there were another, more outstanding, existence around, the various large Guilds would shift their line of sight from Shi Feng to that existence.

Shi Feng could kill two birds with one stone with his action, and only Gentle Snow’s decision remained as the final hurdle.

After a few seconds of silence, Gentle Snow let out a deep sigh as she said, “Alright, then. I’ll buy it. When can you give it to me?”

“In half an hour,” Shi Feng affirmed.

“Good, then. I’ll transfer the money to you at that time,” Gentle Snow disconnected the call.

Standing beside Gentle Snow, Zhao Yueru had heard every word of the conversation. Puzzled, she asked, “Snow, I’m not trying to reprimand you, but although that Ye Feng is one of the rare top-tier experts, within only a short few hours, just how much information could he possibly have gathered? Not to mention, that information is even priced at one million Credits. He is clearly just trying to make a quick buck off of us. That Ye Feng is insincere. We have already helped him out so much and even dealt with the matter of Underworld targeting him.”

“Let’s have a look at it before we judge,” Gentle Snow sighed. In reality, even she did not hold much hope about the information. If it truly contained some valuable information, she would not take too big of a loss, at the very least.

Following which, Shi Feng also made a similar deal with Stabbing Heart of the Assassin’s Alliance. However, he did not offer the super-luxury version this time. After all, the Assassin’s Alliance’s main power was stationed in White River City. He only sold them the information in advance because of the friendship he had with Stabbing Heart.

Stabbing Heart naturally knew this, so he was greatly touched by Shi Feng’s actions. He immediately paid 50,000 Credits as gratitude to Shi Feng. At the same time, with this information about White River City in hand, Stabbing Heart would also have the confidence to request the higher-ups to review the matter of suppressing Martial Union’s development in White River City. That way, Martial Union would not even have the time to find trouble with Shi Feng.

Soon, another half hour passed by.

Shi Feng finally managed to compile and arrange the super-luxury version of the White River City Guidebook. He then sent it to Gentle Snow, Blackie, and the other members of his team. With Blackie’s power-leveling speed, every member of the team would quickly rise to Level 10. They would be much faster than Gentle Snow, so Shi Feng had to provide Blackie and the others with a better understanding of White River City ahead of time. Otherwise, they would simply be lost after entering White River City.

At this moment, the metal door of the forging room opened, and Seliora walked out.

Compared to when she entered the forging room, Seliora clearly felt more fatigued now. Crystal clear sweat coated her healthy, wheat-colored skin, and she looked like she had just stepped out of a pool of water; her appearance was utterly seductive.

“Here, this item’s for you,” Seliora took out the Book of Forging, handing it to Shi Feng with great reluctance. She then took out a flame-red flying dart. This flying dart radiated a brilliant red that intoxicated a person’s heart. “Aside from the Epic ranked greatsword, this item could be called my greatest masterpiece. Due to the quality of the materials being a limiting factor, this item could not achieve Epic rank. However, it has still surpassed Dark-Gold rank. You could call it a Super Dark-Gold ranked throwing weapon; so you have to cherish it properly.”

“Super Dark-Gold Rank?”

“What’s that?”

Doubt filled Shi Feng. If it was Dark-Gold, then it was Dark-Gold. If it was Epic, then it was Epic. Why would there be a Super Dark-Gold rank? Looking at the meaning that Seliora tried to express, this item seemed to possess a special quality between the two ranks.
