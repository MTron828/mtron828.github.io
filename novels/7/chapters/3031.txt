Chapter 106 – Silver Rank?

The atmosphere inside the 175th floor of the Secret Pavilion’s branch headquarters was currently boisterous. Shortly after the instructor certification test’s rewards were announced, many students paid close attention to the scoreboards situated around the hall.

At this time, there had long since been over a hundred participants who had cleared the first floor, so the scoreboard for the first-floor trial had already been filled. This situation proved that many extraordinary experts were participating in the certification test. Moreover, the names ranked on the list were all famous experts in God’s Domain, many of them being Tier 5 experts.

However, none of the students in the hall were paying attention to the first-floor trial’s scoreboard right now. Instead, all of them had their eyes glued to the second floor’s scoreboard.

This was because the second-floor trial’s first-place ranker had appeared not long ago, and this person was none other than Empress Purple Jade. Everyone couldn’t help but be shocked by this situation as they didn’t think a Tier 6 Sword God would participate in the God’s Domain Association’s instructor test.

Of course, everyone’s surprise was only limited to Purple Jade’s participation in the test. Nobody was surprised to see that Purple Jade had come in first place for the second-floor trial. After all, Purple Jade was a Tier 6 Sword God. How could Tier 4 and Tier 5 experts possibly compete against her?

However, when more names began appearing on the scoreboard, an uproar quickly exploded in the hall.

This was because every expert ranked within the top ten of the scoreboard was a well-known Tier 6 God-ranked expert in God’s Domain.

…

2nd – Witch of the West Alice

3rd – Battle Wolf’s Sirius

4th- Silver Ghost Prosciutto

5th – Thirteen Thrones’ Guild Leader Melancholy

6th – Magic-eye Hunter Fithalia

…

10th – Azure Chamber of Commerce’s Hermit

…

At this point, the instructor test was no longer a simple test for participating instructors. Instead, it had become a global ranking list for experts.

It should be known that Tier 6 God-ranked experts were all elusive existences. Meeting even one of these individuals was akin to winning the lottery, let alone getting the chance to see these God-ranked experts compete with each other.

Oftentimes, people would ask how strong Tier 6 God-ranked experts were and who was the strongest among Tier 6 God-ranked experts. Even though the Secret Pavilion had created a God’s Domain Experts List, those recorded on the list were merely ranked based on their publicly available battle records. It couldn’t be considered an accurate measure of strength at all. Not to mention, some God-ranked experts weren’t even on the list. Thus, the Experts List could, at most, be used as a rough reference.

However, the God’s Domain Association’s instructor test was different.

Although the test did not show how players would perform against each other in a duel, it still showed the exact combat standards of participants. Through this, everyone could tell how strong the participating Tier 6 God-ranked experts were.

Currently, the various Academies’ students weren’t the only ones paying close attention to the scoreboard. The various powers of God’s Domain were also looking at it with great interest.

…

“The Association has really blown the test this time out of proportions, Senior Brother. I can’t believe there are so many God-ranked experts participating. Even Teacher couldn’t help himself from registering,” Tao Yuwei, dressed in a lavender martial artist’s robe, said as she looked at Gu Yiren. Then, she looked toward the scoreboard for the second-floor trial with an expectant gaze as she continued, “I wonder how Teacher will rank among the Tier 6 God-ranked experts?”

Their teacher was Thousand Swords, a legendary individual in World Domination. He was also the Guild’s Great Elder. He had been a powerhouse in the virtual gaming industry since 20 years ago. He had even fought against the Five Great Super Guilds’ old monsters and won some of these battles.

Although their teacher had hidden behind the scenes ever since God’s Domain launched and mainly focused on guiding the younger generations, Tao Yuwei knew that their teacher was not the slightest bit weaker than the top ten rankers on the God’s Domain Experts List.

“He should have no problem placing within the top five out of the God-ranked experts present,” Gu Yiren answered as he looked at the scoreboard. “However, it’ll be difficult to get within the top three. Setting aside the Witch of the West, even surpassing the Silver Ghost will be a great challenge. I heard that the Silver Ghost has already become the commander of Mythology’s main force. This goes to show that his strength has already surpassed the previous commander. Aside from the Silver Ghost, Thirteen Thrones’ Guild Leader and the Magic-eye Hunter are also experts who have reached the extremes of the Domain Realm. It won’t be easy for Teacher to win against these people.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Tao Yuwei did not disagree with Gu Yiren’s judgment. This was because the people Gu Yiren mentioned were indeed monsters. Even their teacher had very little chance of winning against these experts.

…

Is this going to be the era where Tier 6’s compete?

Fighting spirit filled Lin Yaoyue’s eyes as she looked at the display on the first-floor lobby of the Secret Pavilion’s branch headquarters. Originally, Tier 6 God-ranked experts were unreachable existences to her. However, that was no longer the case now. So long as she could successfully persuade her Big Sis and acquire Zero Wing’s resources, she could secure herself a spot among Tier 6 God-ranked experts in the future.

…

“What’s going on? Why hasn’t Instructor Soaring Snake cleared the second floor yet?”

Back on the 175th floor, Liu Yanya couldn’t help but grow confused as she watched more and more people clearing the second-floor trial.

It should be known that her instructor was the 41st participant to clear the first-floor trial. Currently, it had already been over half an hour since the instructor’s test began, and over 70 people had already cleared the second-floor trial, yet her instructor’s name still wasn’t on the second floor’s scoreboard.

“Sis, you don’t have to be too worried. Instructor Soaring Snake is a Tier 5 expert, so he definitely won’t have a problem in clearing the second-floor trial,” Liu Xuanyi said. “The difficulty of the second-floor trial is probably a little harder than we thought. It’s just like the first-floor trial. I heard that nearly half of the Flowing Water Realm instructors that participated failed to clear it, while the rest took a significant amount of time to pass. The second floor’s difficulty is probably the same. Instructor Soaring Snake is at the Void Realm’s peak, so he should have no problems clearing the second-floor trial. It’ll just take a little more time.”

“I understand.” Lin Yanya nodded, feeling that her little brother’s words made sense. Then, she shifted her gaze to another display that showed the student registration list.

The God’s Domain Association’s Talent Camp had three registration lists: the Bronze List, the Silver List, and the Gold List.

These lists corresponded to the rank of the applicant’s instructor. Currently, her instructor was still a Bronze Instructor, so her name was placed on the Bronze List. The Bronze List was also the only list with the most applicants right now, the applicant count exceeding over a hundred already. However, out of all these applicants, the Association would only be allowing ten to pass.

It should be known that the Bronze List’s applicant count was still growing as time passed. By the time the application period was over, it wouldn’t be surprising to see five or six hundred people on the list.

Only by entering the Silver List would she face less competition. Although the Association would also only be choosing ten people from the Silver List, there were only ten applicants on the Silver List right now.

However, what Liu Yanya couldn’t tolerate the most wasn’t her slow entry into the Silver List. Instead, what she couldn’t tolerate was the fact that Chen Ziyou’s name was also on the Bronze List!

In other words, Chen Ziyou’s instructor had also cleared the first-floor trial and qualified as a Bronze Instructor.

Liu Yanya couldn’t help but be upset by this situation. After all, she had confidently extended an invitation to Chen Ziyou before and said that they could enter the Silver List together. Yet, now, she was still stuck in the Bronze List together with Chen Ziyou.

Meanwhile, during the time Liu Yanya shifted her attention to the student registration list, all 100 spots on the second-floor trial’s scoreboard were also filled.

He still hasn’t passed?

No matter how many times Liu Yanya looked at the scoreboard, she simply couldn’t find Soaring Snake’s name on it.

“Sis! Look over there!” Liu Xuanyi suddenly said as he pointed at the student registration list. “Is something wrong with the SilverList? Why is Chen Ziyou’s name there?”

“Chen Ziyou?” Liu Yanya also quickly turned to look at the student registration list upon hearing her little brother’s words. “This… How is this possible!?”

Liu Yanya couldn’t help but be dumbfounded as she looked at the Silver List.

There were less than 25 people registered on the Silver List right now, and one of these people’s names was Chen Ziyou. Moreover, the affiliated academy linked to this name was Jin Hai Academy, so there was no doubt that this Chen Ziyou was the same Chen Ziyou she knew…
