Chapter 2782 – Wealthy Shi Feng

“Double the market value?”

Shi Feng was a little surprised when he heard Zhuo Linqiu’s words.

According to Kerui, the transaction price for contribution points would reach 1.5 times the market value at most. Moreover, that was when the contribution competition was incredibly intense. After all, unless one entered the middle layer, it didn’t matter how many contribution points one managed to accumulate.

Yet, Han Yifeng was offering double the market value. Even if the Green God Company would allow the top 20 participants to exchange for three items from the middle layer this time, this was still a very high price.

After all, the difficulty of getting into the top three was simply too great. Before Shi Feng looked into the current top three participants, he had still been confident of getting into the top three. However, after gaining an understanding of those three participants, all thoughts of entering the top three had disappeared from his mind.

This was because those three people could instantly gain an additional one million contribution points if they grew serious.

In other words, if he wished to secure one of the top three positions, he would need 100,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal at the very minimum.

What did this amount represent?

Even if he squeezed the Five Great Super Guilds and a dozen other superpowers dry, getting such a huge number of Seven Luminaries Crystals was impossible. Moreover, this was only the minimum requirement to compete for the top three positions. Hence, he had no choice but to wait for Zero Wing to grow stronger and set aside trying for one of the top three spots for the future. In the current competition, he simply had no chance whatsoever.

Even if he was currently in the ancient God’s Domain, with its more abundant resources, the Seven Luminaries Crystal was still an incomparably valuable commodity. Moreover, its rarity was not the slightest bit lower than in the modern era. In fact, competition for the Seven Luminaries Crystal was intenser in the ancient era.

From what he heard, the Interstellar Continent’s various powers were similarly purchasing Seven Luminaries Crystals at astronomical prices. Residents of the Interstellar Continent could exchange for living resources in the real world using Seven Luminaries Crystals. In fact, if one collected a sufficient number of Seven Luminaries Crystals, one could even get promoted from an ordinary civilian to a resident of the core area. Simply put, every player in the ancient era was competing for Seven Luminaries Crystals.

On the other hand, only the major corporations based in Upper Zones were competing for Seven Luminaries Crystals in the modern God’s Domain. The competition over the crystals had nothing to do with ordinary players. In fact, it didn’t even have anything to do with ordinary corporations.

Hence, even if he were to contest frantically for Seven Luminaries Crystals in the ancient era, the amount he could get his hands on was unlikely to secure him one of the top three spots in the current contribution competition.

Now, he would be satisfied so long as he could secure one of the top 20 positions, and he could indeed afford to sell a portion of his additional points.

“That’s right. Double the market value. Guild Leader Shi, you should be able to see Young Master Han’s sincerity in this matter,” Zhuo Linqiu said, chuckling. “I can assure you that you won’t find another person in the base layer who would offer you such a price.”

The Five States Corporation was one of the top corporations in the country. It had deeper foundations than even the Boulder Corporation, albeit by only a slight margin. In addition, the corporation even had a genius like Han Yifeng as its heir. It was only a matter of time before the corporation set foot in the middle layer.

After giving the matter some thought, Shi Feng replied, “I can agree to that price, but I have a condition.”

Han Yifeng’s offer would tempt anyone. After all, this was equivalent to receiving a 50% discount on the various products the Green God Company put up for exchange. For Shi Feng, who was currently severely lacking in the Upper Zone’s resources, Han Yifeng’s offer was heaven-sent.

“Condition? What condition?” Zhuo Linqiu frowned slightly. In his opinion, the price Han Yifeng offered was already quite generous. He never thought that Shi Feng would want a foot after getting an inch.

“I want to settle the transaction using Life Potions, Phantom Potions, or the middle layer’s limited products,” Shi Feng said. “I will not accept anything else, apart from these items.”

Five million trade points were already more than enough for him to get by in the base layer; there was no point in getting more. Only the limited exchange items were of value to him.

Particularly, the Life Potion and the Phantom Potion weren’t available in the outside world. Even if he tried to exchange for these items using his authority, he could get only five bottles per year. This amount wasn’t even enough for his own use, much less sharing it with other people. “This condition is too much! You should know that those items can’t be bought even with a large number of trade points and contribution points!” Zhuo Linqiu flatly refused Shi Feng’s condition. “Nobody in the entire base layer would satisfy this condition of yours.”

Whether it was the Life Potion, the Phantom Potion, or the middle layer’s limited items, they were all incredibly precious to the various corporations. No one would casually trade them away.

“How about I buy them at their original price?” Shi Feng suggested.

Shi Feng understood that he was indeed asking for a lot with his condition. However, this was also how negotiations worked. Only after both sides agreed on a price could a transaction take place.

“You...” Zhuo Linqiu fell speechless at Shi Feng’s response. He felt that Shi Feng didn’t understand his previous words at all.

However, before Zhuo Linqiu could manage a response, Han Yifeng’s holographic projection suddenly appeared from Zhuo Linqiu’s quantum watch. “It is impossible for me to sell those items at base price. However, with my authority, I can sell some to you at double the price. This is also the lowest I can go,” Han Yifeng said. “Moreover, I believe that nobody else in the base layer would offer you a better price.” “That works.” Shi Feng didn’t feel particularly surprised at Han Yifeng’s counter offer. On the contrary, he found this outcome to be quite excellent already.

The limited items the Green God Company offered for exchange came with fixed price tags, and residents with the necessary authority could exchange for these items at any time. However, as their description suggested, each resident could exchange for only a limited number of these items. If a person wanted to get their hands on more, they could purchase these items from other residents at a marked-up price. Moreover, even if one were willing to pay the extra cost, one wouldn’t necessarily be able to find a willing seller.

“That settles it, then.” Han Yifeng nodded. “However, let me get one thing straight first. Every transaction we conduct must be valued at 50,000 contribution points or more. Otherwise, our transaction will be invalid.”

“That won’t be a problem,” Shi Feng assured, smiling. He understood what was going through Han Yifeng’s mind.

A sum of several thousand contribution points was most likely nothing in Han Yifeng’s eyes. Moreover, such an amount wouldn’t be of any help to him in the contribution competition. After all, if the top three participants were serious, they could easily add a million points to their names. Hence, a transaction of 50,000 contribution points was most likely the lowest acceptable amount for Han Yifeng.

“Okay. So long as you’ve collected 50,000 contribution points, you can come and find me at any time,” Han Yifeng said before disconnecting the quantum communication.

After Han Yifeng finished speaking, Zhuo Linqiu turned around and walked away, leaving Shi Feng alone at the exchange counter.

When Zhuo Linqiu returned to Han Yifeng’s side, he had a hesitant expression. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Just speak your mind,” Han Yifeng said as he looked at his old butler.

“Young Master, I’m afraid the Old Master and the others will have big opinions about your decision to sell him those items at just double the price,” Zhuo Linqiu said worriedly. “After all, those items are things the corporation went to great lengths to accumulate. They are meant to serve as the foundation for the family’s younger generations.” “Foundation?” Han Yifeng suddenly smiled. “Unless we enter the middle layer, the Five States Corporation will be nothing but ants in the eyes of those above. Also, we have failed to enter the middle layer after all these years. If we don’t fight now, when will we fight? Moreover, the family has already promised to assist me with everything they have. If they’re not even willing to part with these items, how are we supposed to compete with the other participants?”

“However, just Shi Feng’s 50,000 contribution points won’t change anything,” Zhuo Linqiu said.

“I naturally know this. Shi Feng is only one of the small sources for me to secure contribution points.” At this point, Han Yifeng’s eyes began glowing slightly. “The old man has already met with the other corporations in the Upper Zone and made some promises to them. I believe he should have no problems securing seven or eight hundred thousand contribution points for me. Afterward, it’ll depend on whether I can complete the Green God Company’s bounty. So long as I succeed, I am certain I can enter the top three!”

He was hell-bent on winning the contribution competition this time.

Meanwhile, after Han Yifeng and Zhuo Linqiu left the exchange center, Shi Feng made his way to the item exchange counter.

Compared to the contribution points counter, the item exchange counter had many more people lined up before it. After waiting in line for around fifteen minutes, Shi Feng exchanged for five Phantom Potions and five Life Potions, as well as five Strengthening Potions, which cost the same as the Phantom Potions and Life Potions. In the end, he spent a total of 75,000 trade points.

In the outside world, that was already equivalent to 750 million Credits.

The Strengthening Potion was considered the least promising product in the Upper Zone because it had only one function: the strengthening of the user’s physical fitness.

However, residents in the Upper Zone would have their physical fitness automatically raised to a certain level, even without any training. If one combined this effect with daily exercise, they could elevate their physical fitness to astonishing levels. Hence, there was simply no need to spend 5,000 trade points to exchange for a Strengthening Potion.

Nevertheless, Shi Feng naturally believed it was better for him to raise his physical fitness as quickly as possible. After all, the stronger his physical fitness became, the easier it would be to improve his brain activity.

Often, when Shi Feng gained enlightenment and achieved a qualitative improvement in his techniques, he would find himself facing various problems stemming from his inadequate physical fitness. Had he been as fit as Han Yifeng during those times, he wouldn’t have faced any problems at all.

Hence, he felt that it wasn’t a loss to spend 25,000 trade points for five Strengthening Potions. Not to mention, he could already be considered a wealthy person in the base layer.

It’s almost time to pick up Qingxue and Aqua.

After taking a look at the time, Shi Feng promptly departed the Green God Tower and hurried over to the Upper Zone’s entrance.

Two hours later, a levitating car stopped at a designated parking lot before the gigantic metal door serving as the Upper Zone’s entrance. Four people—one man and three women-then alighted from the car. They were none other than Lei Bao, Liang Jing, Bai Qingxue, and Aqua Rose. As to why Lei Bao had come along, it was as a precaution.

After all, many powers were currently targeting Zero Wing. Meanwhile, Liang Jing, someone with little combat power, was unsuited for going out alone. Hence, Lei Bao would usually accompany her whenever she left Zero Wing’s headquarters. Ordinary bodyguards would have little to no use against the opponents Zero Wing faced.

“So, this is the Upper Zone?”

Liang Jing was surprised when she saw the vast steel wall at the Upper Zone’s entry.

Even Lei Bao was surprised by the sight. He never thought that the rumored Upper Zone would have such an appearance.
