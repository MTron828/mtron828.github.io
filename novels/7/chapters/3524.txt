Chapter 599 – Divine Downfall

“What kind of terrible luck does Commander Red Frost have? Why did she have to come across Hundred-Armed Giant right off the bat?”

“Hundred-Armed Giant came in 92nd on the latest Divine Glory List. I recall the last time he took action was when he stole from the Red Dragon Nation. At the time, the Flame Dragon Legion, led by the Red Dragon Nation’s First Vice Guild Leader, was raiding a World Boss called the Evil Void Dragon. The raid had proceeded smoothly from start to finish, but as soon as the Boss died, Hundred-Armed Giant suddenly appeared and snatched the Void Axe, a Fragmented Divine Artifact, that dropped.”

“I also heard about that incident. Although the Flame Dragon Legion tried to hunt him down, Hundred-Armed Giant ultimately got away after killing several dozen of the Flame Dragon Legion’s experts. Also, strangely enough, the Red Dragon Nation didn’t try to escalate the matter afterward.”

When Star Lake City’s inhabitants saw the encounter between Red Frost’s battle group and Hundred-Armed Giant, they couldn’t help but grow anxious. Even the Star Lake Legion’s spectating vice commanders were no exception.

Hundred-Armed Giant was incredibly famous in the Greater God’s Domain, and it would be rare to find somebody who hadn’t heard about him and his recent achievement.

The Flame Dragon Legion was the pseudo-apex power Red Dragon Nation’s trump card legion. It consisted of 1,000 Tier 6 experts, and all of its team leaders were fifth-floor experts, while its vice commanders were Saint-ranked experts. Under the effects of the legion’s battle array, they were a force that was beyond the comprehension of anyone in Star Lake City.

The Flame Dragon Legion was so powerful that, even if the fifteen city legions currently attacking Star Lake City were to band together, these fifteen legions still wouldn’t fare any better than a baby would in a fight against an adult.

Yet, Hundred-Armed Giant had not only successfully escaped from the pursuit of the Flame Dragon Legion, but he had even killed dozens of the legion’s experts in the process. His strength was already beyond description. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Hundred-Armed Giant alone was more challenging of an opponent than the entirety of the fifteen cities’ 3,000-man army.

…

“Hahaha! Wonderful! Let’s see how our mighty commander can continue acting arrogantly in Star Lake City after this!” Chen Qilin, a former Star Lake Legion vice commander, reacted in joy and excitement when he saw Red Frost meeting Hundred-Armed Giant.

In the past, be it in prestige or strength, nobody in Star Lake City could challenge Red Frost. She held so much influence in the city that she could deprive him of his position as a vice commander with only a few words, turning him into an absolute joke in the city. Moreover, he had no choice but to endure the humiliation, as there was nothing he could do against a pseudo-great grandmaster like Red Frost.

But now, he would finally get to see Red Frost suffering defeat.

The current Star Lake Legion was a far cry from before. Because of many experts withdrawing, the legion couldn’t even field ten full Tier 6 battle groups for the city battle. And although the City Lord had included his family guards at the last minute, the Star Lake Legion still only managed to field a little over 60 participants for the Tier 6 match, of which nearly one-third were with Red Frost.

Normally, had Red Frost managed to flee into one of the other mobile cities with the City Lord’s family guards and conducted guerilla warfare, it would have still been possible for Star Lake City to earn some points from the Tier 6 match. However, now that Red Frost had encountered Hundred-Armed Giant, the Tier 6 match was as good as over.

While Red Frost might be a Divine Glory expert in the past, it should be known that Hundred-Armed Giant was currently ranked 92nd on the Divine Glory List. Ignoring the fact that Red Frost was no longer at her peak, even if she were still in her prime, she still wouldn’t be a match for Hundred-Armed Giant.

…

Meanwhile, as Red Frost’s battle group moved closer and closer to the Myriad Forest Legion, to everyone’s surprise, Red Frost suddenly charged ahead of her battle group. It did not look like she intended to work with her allies to break the Myriad Forest Legion’s defensive line.

Not bad. As expected of someone who had the potential to enter the top 100. When Hundred-Armed Giant saw Red Frost charging ahead with her crimson spear, a look of interest surfaced on his face. Then, he commanded, “Leave her to me! You guys get rid of the others!”

“We’ll have to trouble you with that, then, Mr. Hundred-Arm,” Myriad Sky said, sighing in relief.

In Myriad Sky’s opinion, the current Red Frost felt no different than a Tier 6 God, and she highly doubted the Myriad Forest Legion could take Red Frost on. Without Hundred-Armed Giant’s assistance, the fifteen cities would have to concentrate all of their forces and erect magic barriers to be able to kill Red Frost.

So, it was naturally good news that Hundred-Armed Giant was willing to take action.

Following Myriad Sky’s response, Hundred-Armed Giant’s three-meter-tall frame suddenly vanished. Then, he reappeared within 20 yards of Red Frost, his speed stunning many of the Tier 6 experts present.

“He’s so fast! Is this the famous Space-Crossing Steps?”

“Didn’t they say that even three-star grandmasters would have difficulty executing Gold Combat Techniques in simulation warfare? How did he manage it so easily?”

“Is this the strength of the top 100 Divine Glory experts?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Many gasped when they saw Hundred-Armed Giant’s lightning-quick maneuvers. Even Myriad Sky couldn’t help but widen her eyes in shock.

Unlike in God’s Domain, players would have their physical strength heavily suppressed in simulation warfare. Not to mention, players also needed to expend mental strength to maintain their weapons and equipment in simulation warfare. Because of these two factors, it was incredibly challenging for players to execute complex maneuvers such as Gold Combat Techniques.

Yet, Hundred-Armed Giant had executed Space-Crossing Steps, which was a Gold Combat Technique and his trademark move, with little to no stress. It was simply unbelievable.

Meanwhile, at the same time as Hundred-Armed Giant appeared before Red Frost, a dark-gray axe appeared in his hand. The instant the axe appeared, the intensity of the aura Hundred-Armed Giant radiated increased substantially, causing many of the Tier 6 experts present to shudder involuntarily.

…

“Is that the Void Axe?” Mu Huangwu, who was spectating the match from inside the city, couldn’t help but marvel at the dark-gray axe decorated by electric arcs. “With that Fragmented Divine Axe in hand, Hundred-Armed Giant can probably trade blows with the various pseudo-apex powers’ Taboos. Even if that madwoman is still at her peak right now, I doubt she can last more than five moves against him…”

Sitting next to Mu Huangwu, Xia Qingying revealed a grim look when she saw Hundred-Armed Giant taking out the Void Axe.

The Tier 6 match took up a significant portion of the city battle’s points. If Star Lake City lost the Tier 6 match to a miserable extent, it wouldn’t matter how well the city did in the Tier 4 and Tier 5 matches. There would be no salvaging the situation anymore.

…

While everyone was distracted by the Void Axe, Hundred-Armed Giant attacked Red Frost without hesitation, executing his other trademark move, the Gold Combat Technique Meteoric Laceration.

In only an instant, Hundred-Armed Giant had executed over a hundred slashes from various angles, creating a web of rapid attacks that gave Red Frost neither time nor space to evade. He was fully committed to eliminating the Star Lake Legion’s commander as quickly as possible.

At this moment, even though they weren’t the actual target of Hundred-Armed Giant’s Meteoric Laceration, everyone present could feel the threat of death descending looming over them.

Good! You’ll serve as a good test subject for the fruits of my research! Red Frost did not grow flustered in the face of Hundred-Armed Giant’s attack. On the contrary, she revealed a look of excitement as she entered a stance and gathered the surrounding mana to the tip of her spear. Then, she charged forward and executed the Forbidden Technique she had spent years studying.

Forbidden Technique, God’s Return!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The sound of metal colliding echoed throughout Star Lake City time and again as axe and spear clashed, the intensity of the collisions creating shockwaves that spread over a thousand yards.

Before anyone could react, a figure suddenly shot out from the epicenter of the shockwaves and crashed into a nearby metal building, the HP bar above the figure’s head shrinking one-third in size. Then, upon getting a clear look at this figure, everyone’s jaws fell wide open.

This was because the figure in question belonged to none other than the 92nd-ranked Divine Glory expert, Hundred-Armed Giant!

…

TL Notes:

[1]Forbidden Technique:

I have no idea if Forbidden Technique(禁忌战法) is an extension of the “combat technique(战技)” category, “Mana Technique(魔力战法)” category, or if it’s something entirely new.

For the time being, it looks like it is either an extension of the Mana Technique category or something entirely new.
