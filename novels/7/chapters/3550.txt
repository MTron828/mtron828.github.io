Chapter 625 – Kalisha’s Phantom

“The second option?” Kalisha blinked as she looked at Shi Feng, her lips curling into a smile. “You have made quite the…unique choice. Are you certain you wish to give up on the opportunity to match Primordial Gods?”

“I’m sure!” Shi Feng said definitively.

Most players would have gone with Kalisha’s first option in this situation. After all, Primordial Dragons were evenly matched with Primordial Gods in strength. Meanwhile, an opportunity to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Primordial Gods was one that most players would find irresistible.

However, in Shi Feng’s case, the first option wasn’t the ideal choice. Instead, it was the second option.

This was because he had already acquired the Goddess of Space’s Legacy and a portion of the Primordial Abyssal God’s Legacy. Whether it was the Goddess of Space or the Primordial Abyssal God, both were extraordinary existences. If he could secure any of their Legacies, he could absolutely stand above the average Primordial God in the future.

Originally, he had still been racking his mind over how he should go about learning the Goddess of Space and Primordial Abyssal God’s Legacies he had acquired. After all, without any guidance, it would be incredibly difficult for him to study them. And even if he managed to receive legacy guidance from a God or even an Ancient God, it was unlikely to be of much help to him.

However, it would be a different story if they were talking about a Primordial Dragon’s Legacy.

As Primordial Dragons were existences on par with Primordial Gods, a Primordial Dragon’s legacy guidance would naturally be on par with a Primordial God’s legacy guidance. If he could receive such a legacy guidance, it would definitely accelerate his research of the two Legacies by a significant margin. Not to mention, he would have ten opportunities to receive a Primordial Dragon’s guidance.

“Very well, then.” Kalisha didn’t try to change Shi Feng’s mind any longer. Instead, she took out a light-red crystal and handed it to Shi Feng, saying, “Here’s the Primordial Dragon Legacy Crystal. I have left my phantom inside it. Aside from using it for legacy guidance, you can also use it to summon my phantom up to three times. Those Evil and Demon Gods should have already noticed that I have recovered my strength, so I hope you can make good use of that crystal and live until the next time we meet.”

System: Congratulations! Kalisha’s Favorability of you has increased by 30 points. You have activated the second phase of the Inferior Mythical Quest Sanctuary’s Rise.

Quest Content: Head for the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary and search for the Primordial Dragon Relic to help stabilize Kalisha’s strength. You must also avoid getting killed by Evil Gods and Demon Gods during this period. Rewards unknown. Penalties unknown.

System: Warning! Warning!

System: You have been cursed by multiple Evil Gods and Demon Gods, and they have also locked onto your soul’s aura. You will be subjected to attacks by an Evil Demon’s Shadow every 30 days. The Evil Demon’s Shadows will grow stronger with time, and you can only lift the curse on you by killing the Evil Gods and Demon Gods who have placed it on you.

As expected of an Inferior Mythical Quest… Shi Feng couldn’t help but be flabbergasted by the system notifications.

In God’s Domain, quests starting from the Epic rank would usually come with significant penalties that could have a permanent impact on players’ accounts. In the case of Legendary Quests, the penalties would become so severe that players would have no choice but to start a new account.

However, in the case of the Sanctuary’s Rise quest, Shi Feng didn’t even have the option of starting a new account, as the curse of the Evil and Demon Gods would simply be transferred to his new account, and the Evil Demon’s Shadow would continue to attack him every month. The only way he could rid himself of the curse would be to kill the Evil and Demon Gods responsible for placing the curse.

Meanwhile, after Kalisha finished speaking, she swiped a finger across the air and created a space-time tunnel before her. Then, her body transformed into a streak of light that disappeared into the tunnel.

She left, just like that? Shi Feng was rendered speechless by Kalisha’s hasty departure.

Originally, he thought Kalisha would at least attack the Gorgon Queen once before leaving. However, after helping him block the Gorgon Queen’s Chaos Spear, the Dragon Princess completely ignored the Primordial Godkin. She even caused him to be the target of an Evil Demon’s Shadow.

An Evil Demon’s Shadow was essentially a God’s doppelganger. However, unlike illusory doppelgangers, an Evil Demon’s Shadow had a physical body.

Meanwhile, Evil and Demon Gods capable of going against Kalisha definitely weren’t ordinary Gods. They were most likely Ancient Gods, so their physical doppelgangers would not be any weaker than Tier 6 Gods. With his current strength, there was no way he could beat such an existence.

“Since that person has left, it’s time for you to meet your end!”

When the Gorgon Queen saw Kalisha leaving, she breathed a deep sigh of relief and started chanting an incantation.

This time, the Gorgon Queen did not speed-cast a Tier 6 Super Spell. Instead, she took her time double-casting two Tier 6 Super Spells, her spellcasting causing all mana within a 10,000-yard radius to gather around her. The mana within 1,000 yards of her also became frozen, causing Azure Shadow and the others, Tier 6 experts who had learned the Bronze Mana Purification Technique, to be unable to manipulate the ambient mana around them.

A moment later, doppelgangers of the Gorgon Queen started appearing within a 1,000-yard radius of herself. In the blink of an eye, a hundred Gorgon Queens had appeared on the plaza, all looking no different than the real deal. Moreover, each of them wielded a Chaos Spear in their hands.

“She knows Time Doppelganger as well?! How can a Boss grasp so many Tier 6 Super Spells?!”

“Is this the strength of a Primordial Godkin?”

Azure Shadow and the others despaired when they saw the Gorgon Queen’s doppelgangers.

Previously, they already felt that the Gorgon Queen was absurdly powerful. After all, not only did she possess a ridiculous amount of HP, but she could also cast the Tier 6 Super Spell Chaos Spear. But now, they finally understood that the Gorgon Queen had only been playing with them all this time.

Time Doppelganger was a Tier 6 Super Spell that allowed users to create 100 doppelgangers of themselves. Although these doppelgangers only had a 30-second duration, each doppelganger had 100% of the original’s Basic Attributes.

Normally, due to Time Doppelganger’s complexity, an individual would be fortunate if they could even cast it. As for using it in conjunction with another Tier 6 Super Spell, it was simply unthinkable. Even Tier 6 fifth-floor experts wouldn’t be able to accomplish such a feat.

Yet, the Gorgon Queen had successfully paired Time Doppelganger with Chaos Spear…

It seems I can’t avoid wasting a use.

When Shi Feng saw the Gorgon Queen going all out, he did not hesitate to activate the light-red crystal Kalisha left him.

Kalisha had obviously given him the Primordial Dragon Legacy Crystal as a means to resist the Evil Demon’s Shadows. However, if he tried to save its uses in this situation, only death would await him.

Suddenly, the Primordial Dragon Legacy Crystal released a dazzling brilliance. Immediately afterward, a 1,000-meter-tall illusory phantom of Kalisha appeared on the plaza.

When Kalisha’s phantom appeared, the Gorgon Queen promptly entered high alert and hesitated to proceed with her offensive. However, when she verified that Kalisha’s phantom was nothing more than a phantom, much of her fear vanished.

Subsequently, as if to repay Kalisha’s act of ignoring her previously, the Gorgon Queen had all her doppelgangers cast their Chaos Spears at Kalisha’s phantom. She intended to bombard the phantom out of existence.

Meanwhile, in response to the oncoming Chaos Spears, Kalisha’s phantom simply raised its palm and swiped at them. The phantom did not bother using any Skills or Spells, choosing to block the oncoming attacks with only its body’s strength. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

A deafening explosion echoed across Nameless City, and clouds of smoke and dust filled the underground plaza. When the dust clouds settled, Kalisha’s phantom was nowhere to be seen. At the same time, the entire underground plaza had sunk by several hundred meters, and all of the Gorgon Queen’s doppelgangers were nowhere to be seen. As for the Gorgon Queen herself, her body was riddled with serious injuries, and her HP had decreased by nearly 10%…

…

TL Notes:

[1]Evil Demon’s Shadow(邪魔之影):

I’m still not certain on this term. I was originally going to go with “phantoms of Evil and Demon Gods,” but the author seems insistent on using 邪魔之影(Evil Demon’s Shadow).

The system notification is also rather vague, so I’m not sure if Shi Feng is going to be targeted by one shadow or multiple. So, there is the possibility that 邪魔之影 is referring to “Evil’s Shadow(s) and Demon’s Shadow(s).”

I don’t have enough information to work off of, so I will come back and make changes in the future if necessary.
