Chapter 2423 – Black Flame’s Might

The appearance of Shi Feng’s group of four instantly made both sides freeze. At this moment, let alone War Blood’s and Starlink’s members, even Heaven’s Blade’s members had their mouths hanging.

After all, this scene was simply too shocking.

Everyone present was well aware of how powerful the inner corridor’s golem army was. Both teams had suffered severe losses due to these golems. Anyone who tried to force their way through the golem army would suffer losses several times higher than if they employed crafty methods like using a Tier 3 Group Invisibility Scroll.

However, Shi Feng’s group of four had not only brute-forced its way through the golem army but also sent so many golems flying into the altar hall. This was simply unbelievable.

“Black Flame!”

An indescribably dark expression appeared on Blood Oath’s face when he saw Shi Feng, the words he spoke sounding as if they had come from the pits of hell.

At this point, Blood Oath’s hatred for Shi Feng was immeasurable. After Shi Feng killed him in the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion’s Residence, his prestige in War Blood had gone up in smoke.

If not for his abilities and strength being sufficiently strong and the shares he held in War Blood, he most likely would’ve had difficulty remaining War Blood’s commander. After all, unlike ordinary adventurer teams, War Blood had backing from major corporations. Hence, he wasn’t the only decision maker in the organization.

Aside from Blood Oath, Starlink’s Four Shadow Demons were also glaring at Shi Feng, belligerence written across their faces. All thoughts of fighting Zwei had vanished. Now, only Shi Feng existed in their eyes. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I never thought that we would actually meet this brat here,” Sword Demon said, a hint of excitement appearing on his face. “Ever since I got promoted to Tier 3, I’ve been itching to repay the humiliation he gave me. Wind, Mad, and Heart, you three get ready as well.”

This was not the first time Sword Demon had seen Shi Feng displaying absurdly high Basic Attributes. Hence, he was not particularly surprised that Shi Feng had made it all the way here with just a group of four. On the contrary, his fighting spirit soared even higher. After all, ever since he got promoted to Tier 3, his strength had undergone a heaven- defying transformation. If Shi Feng had not improved as much as he had after getting promoted to Tier 3, then he would have been disappointed.

“You can count on us. Originally, I thought we wouldn’t get an opportunity to exact revenge on him. Now that he’s here, things could not be better!” Wind Demon replied eagerly.

After reaching Tier 3, the system restrictions on their bodies had been thoroughly lifted, which allowed them to control their bodies with much greater precision. In addition, the four of them had also learned a battle array. Shi Feng was undoubtedly the best target for them to test their new strength.

“Sword Demon, don’t take this opportunity from me! He must die at my hands!” Blood Oath warned coldly when he saw the Four Shadow Demons preparing to take action. He could regain his lost reputation and prestige only by killing Shi Feng with his own two hands.

“Commander Blood, I’m afraid we cannot do that!” Sword Demon said, frowning as he rejected Blood Oath’s warning. His desire to kill Shi Feng was not the slightest bit weaker than Blood Oath’s. How could he possibly agree to leave Shi Feng to Blood Oath?

Meanwhile, upon seeing this scene, Heaven’s Blade’s members were stupefied.

“Crap! Just how much aggro has Black Flame built up with them?!” Prison Tiger blurted out when he saw Blood Oath and Sword Demon wrangling over who would kill Shi Feng.

Originally, War Blood and Starlink had partnered to target Heaven’s Blade. However, the moment Shi Feng appeared, they fell out with each other and completely forgot about Heaven’s Blade.

However, before Blood Oath and Sword Demon could settle their dispute, the Guardian Soldier that had clambered out of the remains of the stone pillar charged at Shi Feng without hesitation. At this moment, dark-green runes appeared all over the Guardian Soldier’s steel body, and the ambient Mana flowed toward it rapidly. Its aura continuously intensified, and the cut on its body healed instantly.

“Oh no! The Guardian Soldier has gone berserk!” Prison Tiger exclaimed, his complexion paling when he saw the Guardian Soldier’s transformation.

Although the Guardian Soldier was only a Level 107 Grand Lord, when it went berserk, its strength rivaled that of Mythic monsters of the same level. Even Zwei would not dare tank it in such a state.

To current superpowers, Level 100-plus Mythic monsters were still incredibly dangerous existences, killing even Tier 3 MTs in just two or three hits. Without special means, even the various superpowers’ main forces would have to avoid fighting Level 100-plus Mythic monsters.

Hence, the Guardian Soldier was no trivial opponent now that it had gone berserk.

When Heaven’s Blade’s team came across berserk Guardian Soldiers before, they could only resort to Tier 4 Magic Scrolls to restrict the Grand Lords in order to escape. Unfortunately, they had already used up all their Tier 4 Magic Scrolls, so they were helpless against this berserk Guardian Soldier.

At this moment, aside from Heaven’s Blade’s members, War Blood’s and Starlink’s members also wore grim expressions on their faces. Although their team had previously defeated a berserk Guardian Soldier, they had paid a huge price.

In the next moment, the berserk Guardian Soldier arrived before Shi Feng and immediately swung its greatsword down at the Swordsman. As the greatsword covered in emerald runes descended, it tore through space and left a pitch-black trail.

“It’s over!” Prison Tiger’s heart sank when he saw the Guardian Soldier targeting Shi Feng’s group.

From the fact that Shi Feng’s group of four had managed to arrive at this hall, Prison Tiger could tell that they possessed extraordinary strength. These four Zero Wing members might not be able to save Heaven’s Blade’s team, but they would be of some help in the fight against War Blood and Starlink. Heaven’s Blade’s team might manage to flee again.

However, if the Guardian Soldier were to kill Shi Feng’s group of four now, then Heaven’s Blade’s team would definitely be doomed.

Just as Prison Tiger and the others were about to shut their eyes and avoid watching the inevitable, Shi Feng suddenly unsheathed Killing Ray and held the Sacred Sword horizontally overhead. He showed no intention of dodging the Guardian Soldier’s full-power slash at all.

Boom!

Along with the sound of an explosion, a powerful storm surged into the surroundings, nearly sweeping the Tier 2 players within a 100-yard radius off their feet.

How is this possible?! Prison Tiger, who stood a short distance away, gaped in shock at Shi Feng.

The Swordsman had actually blocked the Guardian Soldier’s attack. Moreover, under the redirection of Shi Feng’s sword, the Grand Lord’s greatsword had landed beside the Swordsman. Hence, Shi Feng had barely taken any damage.

Meanwhile, War Blood’s and Starlink’s members were similarly gawking at Shi Feng in stupefaction.

The Guardian Soldier’s attack was undoubtedly at the Tier 4 standard. Even a Tier 3 MT would suffer heavy injuries if they received this attack with a Lifesaving Skill. Shi Feng, however, had blocked it so easily.

Before everyone could wrap their head around this shocking scene, Shi Feng swung the Twilight Blade, which he held with his other hand, at the Guardian Soldier.

Tier 3 Legacy Skill, Void Slash!

Secret Technique, Lightning Flash!

Before becoming a Master Magician, Shi Feng could already execute his Tier 3 Skills at 90% Completion Rate or higher. Afterward, his control over his Mana Body improved significantly. As a result, the Completion Rate of his Tier 3 Skills reached whole new heights as well.

System: Void Slash Skill Completion Rate 99%. Skill Proficiency +5.

Suddenly, nine resplendent sword lights appeared and transformed into lightning arcs that pierced through the Guardian Soldier’s body.

The Grand Lord’s body shot back like a bullet and crashed into another stone pillar, shattering it. The Guardian Soldier then collapsed to the ground in a heavily damaged state.

As everyone stared at the prostrate Guardian Soldier, a deathly silence fell over the entire hall.
