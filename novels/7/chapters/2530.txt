Chapter 2531 – Black Dragon

The Abyssal Blade Shi Feng wielded looked like a gemstone of darkness. Adorned with glowing, crimson patterns, the sword gave off a bewitching feeling.

The instant Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade, a doppelganger appeared beside him. In terms of aura and appearance, the doppelganger was utterly identical to him.

“His trump card is a doppelganger?”

“And here I thought he had something amazing saved up. He’s not thinking that he can defeat Vice Commander Thunder just by relying on a doppelganger, which would have weaker Basic Attributes than himself, right?”

Upon seeing Shi Feng’s doppelganger, Demon’s Heart’s members burst into laughter.

In God’s Domain, Doppelganger Skills were indeed excellent lifesaving measures. They were also extremely rare Skills that could drastically increase the combat power of players. However, Doppelganger Skills were generally useful only against monsters and ordinary experts, gainst experts of Rebellious Thunder’s caliber, using doppelgangers was utterly meaningless.

Not to mention, Rebellious Thunder had Cruel Darkness to further amplify his strength. The Magic Weapon grew through absorbing the Power of Darkness its user radiated. In return, the weapon not only provided its user with a significant boost in strength but also extended its user’s attack range drastically. When Rebellious Thunder wielded it, he could achieve an attack range of roughly 20 yards, which basically transformed him into a ranged player.

With such an attack range combined with Rebellious Thunder’s Strength and techniques, it wouldn’t matter if he went up against one or even five melee players. There wouldn’t be much difference, as he wouldn’t give his opponents an opportunity to get close to him.

Meanwhile, if a melee player couldn’t approach Rebellious Thunder, they naturally couldn’t attack him, either. This was the reason why Rebellious Thunder was able to fight three of Battle Wolves’ Domain Realm experts simultaneously without being put at a disadvantage.

Since Shi Feng had summoned only one doppelganger, this increase in numbers wouldn’t affect Rebellious Thunder’s performance in battle at all.

“Although I don’t know what you’re trying to pull here, you should just use whatever cards you have,” Rebellious Thunder advised. Even after seeing Shi Feng summoning a doppelganger, he did not hurry to attack Shi Feng. Instead, he simply casually observed the Swordsman before him. “I’ll teach you how foolish it is for you to make an enemy out of Demon’s Heart!”

After Rebellious Thunder said this, the Power of Darkness that his body radiated intensified once more. This time, it even produced a faint layer of dark fog around his body.

At the same time, the Magic Weapon he wielded seemingly received an upgrade. Now, pale-blue flames flickered around Cruel Darkness’s blade. However, these flames did not increase the ambient temperature but decrease it. The temperature fell so low that the nearby plants even started freezing. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“He can still grow stronger?”

“Amazing! This is truly amazing! It’s no wonder even the top three adventurer teams do not dare defy Demon’s Heart! Just Rebellious Thunder alone is more than enough to make the top three adventurer teams suffer!”

Upon seeing Rebellious Thunder’s strength improving further, the Demon players spectating from the city walls gained newfound recognition of Demon’s Heart. Many experts even started entertaining thoughts of joining the Guild.

Originally, they had become Dark Players to avoid the restrictions of Guilds. However, the strength Rebellious Thunder displayed was simply too amazing. Now, they felt that they wouldn’t mind losing some of their freedom if it meant that they could become as strong as Rebellious Thunder.

At this moment, let alone the Demon players spectating from the city walls, even Regretful Wind and the others, who were watching inside one of the city’s bars, were floored by Rebellious Thunder’s sudden power-up.

“He still wasn’t at his peak state before?” As Regretful Wind goggled at Rebellious Thunder’s fog-shrouded body, he had trouble keeping his mouth closed.

Compared to ordinary Demon players, Regretful Wind, who had already reached the Demon Viscount rank, had a much clearer idea just how frightening the Power of Darkness Rebellious Thunder radiated was. It was no exaggeration to say that, even if he raised the density of his own Power of Darkness by three or four times, he would still fall short of Rebellious Thunder’s standard.

Since the origin of Demon player^ strength was the Power of Darkness, having denser Power of Darkness would improve not only one’s Concentration recovery but also the power of their Skills and Spells by a large margin. The Power of Darkness affected players similar to how Mana did—but with much more prominent effects.

“To think that a Demon Count can grow that strong. Black Flame really is doomed this time. I’m afraid he won’t last more than a few moves against Rebellious Thunder,” Flame Feather muttered in shock.

She was clearly a 3-star Viscount, only one step away from becoming a Count. However, it never occurred to her that there would be such a huge gap in strength between a 3-star Viscount and an actual Count. At this moment, let alone within Demon City’s sphere of influence, even outside of Demon territories, Rebellious Thunder could still operate without fear.

Meanwhile, outside Demon City, when Blue Frost and the other Zero Wing members from Shelter One, who had followed Shi Feng to Demon City, saw Rebellious Thunder’s transformation, grim expressions appeared on their faces.

“Blue, how about advising the Guild Leader to stop? We’ve already gone this far. I believe the Dark Den’s various powers will understand how strong Shelter One is. However, if we proceed with this fight, our losses will be massive,” Evening Lotus said as she looked at Blue Frost.

After seeing how easily their team reached Demon City, she had indeed gained newfound recognition of their Guild. She never thought that Zero Wing would be this strong.

However, their current opponent was no longer an existence they could deal with. Even though they had over 300 Tier 3 experts on their side, she wasn’t optimistic about their chances of defeating Rebellious Thunder. After all, they were standing in the home ground of Demon players. Moreover, Rebellious Thunder had the protection of Demon City.

“Indeed. At this rate, rather than making a statement, we’ll end up becoming a laughing stock in the Dark Den instead,” Blue Frost said, nodding. He, too, felt that they had done enough.

Blue Frost immediately headed for Shi Feng to persuade him to end this battle of attrition.

However, he had just taken two steps forward when Shi Feng suddenly raised the Abyssal Blade horizontal of himself and started incanting.

The deafening roar of a Dragon entered everyone’s ears and shook the entire Demon City. This Dragon roar made everyone present shudder involuntarily, and they reflexively turned to look at the origin of this roar.

To everyone’s surprise, this roar actually came from the doppelganger Shi Feng summoned. At this moment, however, the doppelganger had started disintegrating into a cloud of black fog, which continuously expanded, growing by several hundred times in size in no time at all. A short moment later, a pair of gigantic, golden eyes appeared inside the black fog, the piercing gaze of the golden eyes sending shivers down everyone’s spine.

“What’s going on?”

“The doppelganger can actually transform?”

“The doppelganger’s aura is so strong!”

The spectating players promptly started discussing among themselves when they saw the transformation Shi Feng’s doppelganger underwent, curiosity and confusion filling their minds.

“It seems you weren’t spouting nonsense before,” Rebellious Thunder said. As he gazed at the dense cloud of fog before him, fighting spirit welled up within him.

However, no sooner had Rebellious Thunder finished speaking than a gigantic claw emerged from the cloud of fog. This claw was the size of a two-story house and densely covered in pitch-black scales. When the claw landed, it instantly shattered the ground. At the same time, everyone in the vicinity also felt the ground beneath them quaking.

Before everyone could snap out of their daze, a thirty-meter-tall Black Dragon appeared before their eyes.

“A Dragon?!”

Everyone’s breath momentarily stifled as they gazed at the incarnation of death and destruction before them, unable to wrap their head around this situation.

“How is this possible?!”

“Why would a Dragon appear here?”

“That is fake! That must be fake!”
