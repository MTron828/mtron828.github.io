Chapter 321 – Six Great Divine Sets

Regional System Announcement: The Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition has officially begun. All participants are encouraged to collect as many Heroic Spirit Remnants as possible. The first ten participants to collect 100 Heroic Spirit Remnants will be able to enter the Ancient River’s Heart. The top 20 participants will receive the qualifications to participate in the official phase of the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition.

Regional System Announcement: Participants will be resurrected in their respective temple plazas in the event of death in the Ancient River Secret Land. Participants who died will not lose any experience points but will drop half of their collected Heroic Spirit Remnants.

Regional System Announcement: If there are fewer than ten contestants who have collected 100 Heroic Spirit Remnants after three natural days, the top 10 participants will be forcibly teleported to the Ancient River’s Heart, and the top 20 participants will be automatically awarded the qualifications to participate in the official phase of the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition.

The Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition?

Realization dawned on Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao when they saw the system announcements. At the same time, they experienced unprecedented pressure.

Some corporations and conglomerates would occasionally host invitational competitions in God’s Domain to recruit geniuses and powerhouses or to help them with some matters. Meanwhile, an invitational competition hosted by the Galaxy Conglomerate was one that any player operating in the Starlight Realm would find too tempting to refuse.

So, the fact that the Rookie Competition’s top 20 rewards included the qualifications to participate in the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition would undoubtedly increase the competitiveness of the top 100 participants, thereby increasing the difficulty of getting into the Rookie Competition’s top 20. Not to mention, their goal was to get into the top 10.

To make matters worse, their party’s starting location was right next to three paragon-led parties. This was horrendous luck.

Currently, Shi Feng’s name had already spread across the entire Ancient River Secret Land because of his victory against Unforgettable Leaf. Everyone also knew Markless Blade was looking to challenge Shi Feng to a duel. These were more than enough to prove Shi Feng’s strength.

So, if other parties were to come across their party of three in the official phase of the Rookie Competition, they would definitely prioritize killing Shi Feng, reducing the competition they needed to face in trying to get into the top 20. After all, not only was Shi Feng a powerful expert, but he was also an expert without any background in the Greater God’s Domain. They could kill him without worrying about any potential repercussions.

However, despite receiving the scrutiny of the three surrounding parties, Shi Feng behaved as if he did not notice their gazes, a smile forming on his face as he looked at the system announcements.

This is interesting.

The Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition was a major opportunity in the Starlight Realm.

If he remembered correctly, the Galaxy Conglomerate was inviting so many Tier 4 experts because Eternity, one of the Six Great Divine Sets of legends, had appeared in the Greater God’s Domain!

A Divine Set referred to a Divine Artifact ranked set equipment in God’s Domain. Naturally, a Divine Set’s value was much greater than individual Divine Artifacts.

Meanwhile, among the Divine Sets that existed in the Greater God’s Domain were the Six Great Divine Sets. Every one of these six sets came with countless legends. According to rumors, should a player manage to gather a complete set, they would become invincible in the Greater God’s Domain.

To Shi Feng, though, this wasn’t a rumor since he had personally seen a Divine Set in action.

Of course, the Divine Set he saw back then wasn’t one of the Six Great Divine Sets, but a normal Divine Set instead. It was also the only Divine Set owned by the apex power Demon’s Gate. Even though it was only a normal Divine Set, it was enough to deter other apex powers from casually provoking Demon’s Gate. This Divine Set was also the main reason Shi Feng had a headache dealing with Demon’s Gate.

Anyway, the Galaxy Conglomerate had happened across a clue leading to the Eternity Set, one of the Six Great Divine Sets, during his previous life. Back then, the conglomerate had invited many Tier 4 paragons from all over the Starlight Realm. It had even gone as far as to invite the Tier 4 monsters of other Realms to ensure the success of its operation.

However, for some reason outside of Shi Feng’s knowledge, the Galaxy Conglomerate’s operation failed. Moreover, it was a catastrophic failure that resulted in severe losses for all participants. Out of the various consequences the participants suffered, the loss of their accounts was the mildest of penalties. Some participants even suffered severe damage to their minds, resulting in their mental strength plummeting. These participants had also never managed to recover fully, resulting in their permanent separation from God’s Domain’s apex.

This incident had shaken the entire Greater God’s Domain, and everybody knew about it back then.

Shi Feng never thought that he would actually make it in time for this event in this life.

During his previous life, he had only heard about the event from others. Moreover, he had only heard about it after the Galaxy Conglomerate’s operation had failed spectacularly.

As for the Eternity Set itself, the original owner of the set had used it to heavily damage the Ancient Abyssal God. It was something Shi Feng didn’t even dare to dream of owning during his previous life.

So, he never thought he would get such an opportunity in this life. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, Shi Feng quickly calmed his agitated heart and turned his gaze to the peak of the mountain, which was also the location of the Ancient River’s Heart. He could feel one of the Seven Luminaries Codex’s fragments there. Although he didn’t know which fragment resided there, it didn’t matter. So long as he could get his hands on one and recover a portion of the Seven Luminaries Codex’s power, he would have enough power to stand at the apex of the Greater God’s Domain.

The Codex could even offer him significant help in acquiring the Eternity Set.

“Brother Black Flame, I get the feeling that these three parties hold significant hostility toward us. Moreover, it feels like they are looking to attack us together. Should we retreat for now?” Midsummer whispered to Shi Feng.

While it was logical for participants in the official competition to prioritize killing the strongest competitors, the three parties around them behaved as if they had discussed targeting their party of three beforehand. As soon as the magic barriers had disappeared, the three parties swiftly moved to block three of the safest paths leading out of the starting point. Although there were several other paths that could be taken, these paths had at least ten Level 140, Tier 4 Heroic Spirits patrolling them, so they were essentially impassable.

If these three parties hadn’t discussed working together beforehand, there was no way they could have moved so neatly and perfectly.

“Your hunch isn’t wrong. They are indeed planning to target us together,” Shi Feng said as he looked at the three parties with a faint smile. “Or, more specifically, they’re trying to keep us from leaving.”

“Keep us from leaving?” Midsummer couldn’t help but look at the three parties in surprise and confusion.

What exactly did their party do to warrant three paragon-led parties of other nations to target them together? Not even the Myriad Forest Empire’s First Paragon would receive such a treatment.

While Midsummer was feeling confused over this situation, Martial Quadbeast looked at Shi Feng’s party and said, “By the request of Heavenly Boa’s Markless Blade, I will have to ask you three to wait here for some time.”

“This Markless Blade fellow must hold a lot of influence if he can get your three parties to sell him a favor,” Shi Feng exclaimed, feeling a little surprised as he looked at the leaders of the three parties.

The Red Star Kingdom’s Glorious Mantra!

The Iron Lion Kingdom’s Martial Quadbeast!

The Myriad Forest Empire’s Silent Saintess!

These were all famous individuals in the surrounding kingdoms and empires. Even when the Guild Leaders of hegemonic powers tried to hire them as helpers, these three turned down the offers they received without hesitation. Yet, now, they had agreed to take on Markless Blade’s commission. This was truly surprising.

“Young man, you have only arrived in the Greater God’s Domain recently, so there are still many things you do not understand,” Martial Quadbeast, the oldest out of the three parties’ leaders, said. “You might be confident in your strength, but you have offended someone you should not offend. So, you will have to pay the price now!”

“What if I insist on leaving?” Shi Feng asked as he calmly looked at Martial Quadbeast.

However, as soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, a sloppy-looking man with an astonishingly powerful aura suddenly jumped down from a nearby cliff and landed directly in front of Shi Feng’s party of three.

“I’m afraid that’s not up to you to decide!”
