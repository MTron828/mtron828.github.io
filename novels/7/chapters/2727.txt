Chapter 2728 – Sword Emperor’s Might “A Sword Emperor?”

Prosciutto was stunned when he heard Odin’s words, his eyes doubtful as he looked at Shi Feng

Although some experts in God’s Domain had already reached Level 120, reaching Level 120 and getting promoted to Tier 4 were two entirely different matters. Reaching Level 120 only meant that a player had met the most basic of requirements for the Tier 4 promotion. According to the various Guilds’ understanding, players would need to search for their Tier 4 Legacy Lands after reaching Level 120-a truly challenging task. Even the Five Great Super Guilds would need a lot of time to search for just one Legacy Land. Not to mention, players would then have to challenge this Legacy Land to obtain their Legacy.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng was merely the Guild Leader of a pseudo-superpower. How could he possibly locate a Legacy Land faster than the various Super Guilds?

“A Tier 4 Sword Emperor?” “No way. It’s only recently that some people have reached Level 120, yet he’s already gotten promoted to Tier 4 Sword Emperor?”

“This is a lie! This must be a lie! That’s a Tier 4 class we are talking about! Even the Kings of the various kingdoms fear a Tier 4 existence! How can anyone possibly get promoted to Tier 4 so soon?!”

The spectating players had likewise heard Odin’s words, and a wave of commotion immediately spread among them, everyone expressing their doubts about Shi Feng’s successful promotion to Tier 4.

Although Shi Feng had indeed displayed frightening combat power, they still found it possible for a Tier 3 player to do so. After all, many treasures in God’s Domain could allow players to become incredibly strong. Lina’s group of seven was a perfect example. However, reaching Tier 4 was a different story.

Tier 4 existences were powerhouses publicly acknowledged by the NPCs in God’s Domain!

Take the current Tier 4 NPCs, for example. No superpower dared offend Tier 4 NPCs. The Five Great Super Guilds were no exception.

This was because Tier 4 was a taboo that had been deeply engraved in the bones of God’s Domain’s players. Tier 4 NPCs were existences that shouldn’t be offended under any circumstances.

In fact, the various major powers suspected that even the superpowers’ Tier 3 experts would have to wait until around Level 130 to get promoted to Tier 4.

On the battlefield, Muxin stared at Shi Feng in shock and expectation.

If this is true... When Muxin considered the possibility that Shi Feng was a Tier 4 Sword Emperor, a passionate flame burned in her heart.

If Odin’s words were true, then Frost Heaven’s position on Island No. 3 was secured. This also meant that Frost Heaven would have a chance of securing the sixth reserve seat and becoming one of the true giants in God’s Domain.

Simultaneously, however, Muxin also couldn’t help feeling dubious.

While players like herself were still agonizing over unlocking their Mana Bodies and thinking about how to search for their Legacies after reaching Level 120, Shi Feng had already completed all these tasks and even reached Tier 4.

No matter how she thought about it, this situation was simply implausible.

“Are you really a Sword Emperor?” Prosciutto couldn’t help asking Shi Feng.

Although Odin had already spoken, Prosciutto still wished to verify this matter with Shi Feng.

Immediately, everyone in the arena focused on Shi Feng, wanting to hear the truth from his mouth.

“That’s right. I am indeed a Tier 4 Sword Emperor.” Shi Feng nodded. At the same time, he glanced reflexively at Odin, his eyes full of surprise.

If a player did not register themself at the Adventurer’s Association and redeem their Tier 4 Class Emblem, it should be impossible for others to notice their identity. This was especially true if the player in question had hidden their aura and concealed their identity using special tools.

In Shi Feng’s opinion, he had concealed his promotion very thoroughly all this time. When he fought earlier, he even limited himself to low-tier Skills and Spells. He also had the Nightwalker’s Cape to conceal his life aura. As for his Mana Domain, that couldn’t be used to prove anything. The Mana Domain’s acquisition and strengthening mainly depended on a player’s control over Mana. The better one’s Mana control, the stronger the Mana Domain they could summon. It was unrelated to one’s tier at all.

Meanwhile, following Shi Feng’s acknowledgment, silence spread across the entire arena. At this stage of the game where even Tier 3 players were rare, a Tier 4 player had actually come into existence. It was as if Shi Feng was making a joke of all their efforts. “No! That’s impossible! I won’t acknowledge it!” Sandstorm’s eyes turned bloodshot as he glared at Shi Feng. “How can you possibly have reached Tier 4 already? You must be lying! You’re trying to fool us into giving you this Resource Node without a fight!

“I won’t let you succeed! I will expose you!” At this point, Sandstorm had already thoroughly lost his mind.

Sandstorm had thought that he had grown a lot stronger since his last defeat at Shi Feng’s hands and anticipated that the gap between them had shrunk significantly already. Now, he was being told that not only did the gap not shrink in the slightest, but it had even widened instead.

In Sandstorm’s opinion, Shi Feng was merely the Guild Leader of a small Guild. How could Shi Feng possibly surpass him, who was an elite among elites even in the Five Great Super Guilds?

The next moment, Sandstorm’s aura burgeoned in intensity, and the size of his body increased by a large margin. Scales also started growing on his face and body. Now, he practically looked like a miniature Infant Dragon. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Flapping his powerful wings, Sandstorm swept up a gale and instantly arrived before Shi Feng. Abandoning his weapon, he swiped a claw at Shi Feg.

The instant Sandstorm’s claw moved, the space around it shattered. Even the flow of time in the vicinity slowed. The power of his attack approached the standard of Mythic ranked Archaic Species. “Why bother?”

Shi Feng couldn’t help sympathizing with Sandstorm when he saw the latter’s frenzied assault. After all, he had once fallen into such despair himself. This was especially true after he saw those geniuses who joined the game much later than he did.

However, he had long since moved on from this despair. He realized that all he needed to do was live his life well. What was the point of comparing himself with others?

“Cool your head first!” Shi Feng said, waving his hand. A ripple of Mana then spread out from under his feet and instantly enveloped a 500-yard radius.

Tier 4 Legacy Skill, Blade Domain!

A magic sword suddenly appeared before Sandstorm, who was only half a yard away from Shi Feng. The magic sword then struck the Assassin like a streak of lightning.

Slash!

The next moment, an arm flew into the air. In the face of this magic sword, even the sturdy dragon scales were no different from a piece of flimsy paper.“You...”

Upon seeing his arm flying away, Sandstorm instantly sobered up. He hurriedly activated a Tier 3 Defensive Skill, increasing his Defense by a significant margin and doubling his maximum HP.

However, no sooner had Sandstorm used his Skill than seven more magic swords appeared in the air. They then transformed into streaks of light that cut him.

Each slash plundered 20% of Sandstorm’s HP, the seven swords instantly robbing the Assassin of all his HP. The swords also burned his body into ashes, eliminating him from the arena.

The entire process might seem long and arduous, but it had taken only an instant in reality.

“How is this possible?!”

The audience in the spectator stands gaped in shock at this scene. Their minds even froze momentarily.

Sandstorm was a Demidragon that rivaled Tier 4 Archaic Species in strength. Previously, he still managed to exchange multiple blows with Shi Feng. Yet, now, Shi Feng had instantly executed him without even giving him a chance to resist.
