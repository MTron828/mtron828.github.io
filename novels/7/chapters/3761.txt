Chapter 3762 - 836 - Zero Wing's Capital

“Zero Wing will support Red Frost?” Xiao Yilong chuckled at Shi Feng’s words. “Although Red Frost is qualified to compete, do you know how much Ember Dragon has invested in his chosen candidate? Or do you think Holy Dragon Spear’s Elders, Grand Elders, and many experts will support Red Frost just because you said you would support her?”

Shi Feng did not respond immediately. He knew Xiao Yilong still wasn’t done, so he quietly stared at the other party.

“You must know by now that a space-time passage into the Eternal Realm has been discovered, and crossing it is a challenge. Every 1,000-man, Tier 6 legion that tries to enter the Eternal Realm reaches it with only several dozen players alive. This is because the passage teems with countless Void Creatures and a type of corrosive energy that eats away at players’ mana. If players wish to traverse the passage safely, they must find safe zones to rest.

“However, there are very few places where players can safely rest in the space-time passage. Moreover, these safe zones are not permanent and appear randomly. If players want fixed rest locations, their only option is to capture one of the Void Fortresses in the passage.

“But to capture a Void Fortress, the monsters infesting it have to be cleared out, and the manpower and resources required to accomplish this are astronomical. It costs 100 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal per day to maintain each player’s mana inside the space-time passage. This number would be even higher if they fight.

“Thus, the Great Commander has declared that whoever in the adventurer team can lead a team to capture a Void Fortress in the space-time passage will become Holy Dragon Spear’s decision maker.

“To help his chosen candidate, Ember Dragon has gathered various God-ranked Legacies and 300 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal from the several conglomerates backing him to win over the experts in the adventurer team. Compared to Ember Dragon, how many God-ranked Legacies and Seven Luminaries Crystals can Zero Wing offer?”

Xiao Yilong’s words echoed in the corridor, surprising Red Frost. She didn’t expect the competition this time to be so intense.

Setting aside the precious God-ranked Legacies, the 300 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal alone were not something most conglomerates could afford, let alone the current Zero Wing.

“If Red Frost wants to win this competition, her only option is to return to Holy Hymn City, seek forgiveness from the family’s Grand Elders, and gain the old commander’s resource support. Only then can she gather sufficient manpower in the adventurer team to challenge a Void Fortress. Otherwise, she still stands no chance against Ember Dragon!” Xiao Yilong said as he looked at Shi Feng with a hint of disdain.

Shi Feng was indeed strong. When Xiao Yilong realized Shi Feng had killed him with nothing but a Law Projection, he was very taken aback. However, that wasn’t enough to sway his opinion of Zero Wing’s insignificance when resolving Red Frost’s predicament. After all, they had fought under the same Basic Attributes.

In the Greater God’s Domain, a player’s strength comprised more than their Law Projection. Levels, weapons, and equipment were also crucial factors. Although Shi Feng currently thrived in the Eternal Realm, he had yet to reach Level 200. He also did not possess any Divine Artifacts. Under such circumstances, how was he supposed to compete with players outside the Eternal Realm who averaged Level 220? Some of these players were even equipped with Divine Artifacts.

Not to mention, Zero Wing was nowhere near as wealthy as conglomerates operating in the Greater God’s Domain.

“It’s only 300 million units. Zero Wing can finance Commander Frost with 500 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal in a month,” Shi Feng said, smiling. “Additionally, so long as Holy Dragon Spear’s Elders and Grand Elders support Commander Frost, Zero Wing can grant them one opportunity to improve their combat standards. Even reaching that step wouldn’t be out of the question.”

Shi Feng’s words immediately stunned Red Frost and the others.

“Is he exaggerating, Big Sis Frost?” Twilight Leaf asked as she tugged on Red Frost’s sleeve. If Shi Feng truly meant what he said, he would need to come up with 500 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal and hundreds of God-ranked Legacies and above within a month. In the current Greater God’s Domain, only the various apex powers could fulfill such a promise.

“I don’t know,” Red Frost said, shaking her head. When she looked at Shi Feng again, she felt like she was looking at a stranger.

Five hundred million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal in a month?

Giving Holy Dragon Spear’s Elders and Grand Elders an opportunity to improve their combat standards?

If Red Frost hadn’t known that Shi Feng wasn’t one to exaggerate his words, she would have suspected that he had lost his mind. After all, no matter how she racked her brain, she simply couldn’t figure out how Zero Wing could come up with so many resources.

“You don’t have to doubt Zero Wing’s capital,” Shi Feng said when he saw Xiao Yilong’s look of skepticism. “I will let Commander Frost bring 100 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal to you in the Greater God’s Domain in three days. Zero Wing will subsequently deliver the remaining 400 million units within a month. As for whether Zero Wing can help your Elders and Grand Elders achieve a breakthrough, you will find out once you meet up with Commander Frost in the passage. If you don’t have any other problems, I can establish a God’s Domain Contract with Commander Frost right away. You can also return and organize your forces as soon as possible.”

Seven Luminaries Crystals were indeed precious in the Greater God’s Domain. The average conglomerate could, at most, come up with tens of millions of units on short notice. Although apex powers could provide 500 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal in a month, it would hurt them significantly to part with such a huge sum. As for Legacies that could help fifth-floor experts achieve further improvements, even pseudo-apex powers did not have many.

Under normal circumstances, there was no way Zero Wing could compete with Ember Dragon financially. After all, the Uncrowned War God had multiple conglomerates backing him. However, it was a different story after Shi Feng obtained the Tower of the Abyss’s design. With the Tower of the Abyss, Zero Wing would no longer lack Seven Luminaries Crystals or methods to help players improve their combat standards.

As for why Shi Feng had decided to get involved with Red Frost’s affairs, it was because of Holy Dragon Spear.

Holy Dragon Spear was an adventurer team with extraordinary strength. Its foundations were vastly superior to those of the current Zero Wing. Now that a passage into the Eternal Realm had been discovered, the war between races had officially begun. If Red Frost became Holy Dragon Spear’s decision maker, it would be equivalent to an alliance between Zero Wing and the adventurer team. This, in turn, would elevate Zero Wing’s overall strength in the Greater God’s Domain by a large margin.

More importantly, Shi Feng could get the help of Holy Dragon Spear’s legendary 10,000-man Tier 6 army. He might not have cared as much about getting this army’s help if it were before his trip to the Crucible of the Ancients, but now that he knew the method to advance to Tier 7, Holy Dragon Spear had become the key to killing one of the Twenty-Two Taboos.

If he missed this opportunity to ally with Holy Dragon Spear, it was unlikely he could find another power that could help him in the foreseeable future.

Subsequently, Shi Feng signed a God’s Domain Contract with Red Frost under the witness of Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf. According to the contract, Zero Wing would give Red Frost 500 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal and her supporters a chance to achieve a breakthrough. In return, once Red Frost became Holy Dragon Spear’s decision maker, she had to ally with Zero Wing and grant Zero Wing the authority to mobilize Holy Dragon Spear’s full force once.

After Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf reluctantly left Zero Wing Tower, Shi Feng promptly returned to his room and logged into God’s Domain.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
