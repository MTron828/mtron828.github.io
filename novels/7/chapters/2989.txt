Chapter 64 – Above the Apex

“This is…a Great Mage?”

Liang Feng and Chen Ziyou couldn’t believe their eyes when they looked at the arrows embedded in the ground around Wu Xiaoxiao’s character.

Magical classes were known for being made out of paper in God’s Domain. Moreover, they were also the weakest in Strength and Agility. This was because most, if not all, magical class players would invest the Free Attribute Points they received from leveling up into Intelligence. Thus, compared to classes that prioritized Strength and Agility, magical classes were vastly inferior in reaction speed and melee confrontations.

Yet, when Shi Feng controlled Wu Xiaoxiao’s character, rather than a Great Mage, the character performed as if it were a war god instead.

How is this possible?!

Wu Xiaoxiao was also dumbfounded when she saw the arrows scattered around her character.

Compared to Liang Feng and the other spectators, Wu Xiaoxiao had experienced first-hand the impact transmitted through the staff when Shi Feng deflected those arrows. Thus, she could tell that under Shi Feng’s manipulation, the intensity of the impact was much lower than when she was the one manipulating the staff.

However, compared to the significantly dampened impact force, what surprised her the most was the speed at which Shi Feng swung the staff.

As a Great Mage, Wu Xiaoxiao could confidently say that she was the most knowledgeable out of everyone in the classroom regarding the limitations of a Great Mage. Meanwhile, based on her understanding, she knew that it should be physically impossible for a Great Mage to swing their staff fast enough to block even 15 arrows, let alone 30 arrows.

However, after replaying Shi Feng’s actions in her mind one more time, Wu Xiaoxiao suddenly came to a realization as she asked, “Is it Strength as One?”

“It’s good that you understand,” Shi Feng said, nodding after removing the auxiliary guidance helmet from his head.

Previously, when Wu Xiaoxiao was dodging the arrows, she had indeed exerted perfect control over her body, using minimal movements to dodge the oncoming arrows. However, by separately manipulating her various body parts, Wu Xiaoxiao had forgotten that her body was actually one big mechanism. She might have succeeded in manipulating the various parts in this big mechanism without making any unnecessary movements, but she had failed to manipulate this mechanism as a whole. She had only used individual parts of her body to cope with the oncoming arrows instead of using her entire body.

This was a common problem all magical class players faced. They might have top-tier control over their minute movements, but they failed to exert their entire body’s strength to cope against attacks like melee players.

Conversely, by virtue of how melee classes functioned, melee players had a much easier time reaching the Flowing Water Realm. They only needed to learn how to exert minute control over their various body parts to reach the Flowing Water Realm.

Afterward, Wu Xiaoxiao looked at the arrows surrounding her again and smiled bitterly, saying, “But even if I achieve Strength as One, I doubt I can perform to such an extent.”

She wasn’t a fool. While Shi Feng had indeed performed the Strength as One technique necessary to reach the Flowing Water Realm, the average Flowing Water Realm expert could only cope against 18 arrows. Yet, not only did Shi Feng manage to cope with 30 arrows, but he had also done so without evading any of them. He had thoroughly blocked all 30 arrows using his staff without moving a single step.

It should be known that even Void Realm experts could only cope against 27 arrows after pushing Strength as One to its limits. There was no way a Void Realm expert could deal with 30 arrows as easily as Shi Feng…

There was no doubt that Shi Feng’s combat standard had already reached the apex of God’s Domain. No, he might even be above the apex!

“Amazing! Truly amazing!” Qi Lianshan couldn’t help but grow excited as he looked at Shi Feng. “Never in my dreams did I imagine that such a mighty expert would appear in our Jin Hai University! So this is the true Flowing Water Realm!”

This is the true Flowing Water Realm? Chen Ziyou’s eyes also lit up with excitement. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Previously, she had been wondering how she could further improve herself after reaching the Refinement Realm. After all, even her instructor, Qi Lianshan, didn’t know the exact method to do so. The only solution he could offer was to train her control over her minute movements to its limits. However, after seeing Shi Feng’s display, she already had an idea of how she should proceed.

“So this is the difference between the Refinement Realm and Flowing Water Realm!” Liang Feng also came to a realization when he heard Qi Lianshan’s words. At the same time, though, he couldn’t help but fall into thought as he wondered, But why would Shadow dismiss such an expert? Is Shadow crazy?

However, Liang Feng didn’t dwell too deeply into the matter, focusing on the class instead.

Subsequently, Shi Feng started providing one-on-one guidance to the rest of the class. Even Qi Lianshan couldn’t help but pose a few questions to Shi Feng. By the end of the class, everyone in the classroom had received a significant harvest. It was especially true for Liang Feng, becoming the second student after Chen Ziyou to reach the Refinement Realm under Shi Feng’s guidance.

Meanwhile, after the class ended, Qi Lianshan hurriedly approached Shi Feng, who was just about to exit the class, and asked, “Instructor Shi, may I know if you will allow people outside the Academy to attend your class?”
