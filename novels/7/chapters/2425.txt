Chapter 2426 – He Is a Peerless Monster

“What’s going on?”

“Why is Elder Wu treating Black Flame so politely?”

Everyone in the hall stared at the old man in astonishment, unable to believe what was happening.

Elder Wu was a great authority in Thirteen Thrones, which even the Guild Leader had to bow to. Moreover, he was one of the most influential figures on Dragonheart Island. What possible reason would he have to act so friendly with a pseudo-superpower’s Guild Leader?

What is going on?! Is Thirteen Thrones giving up on the Tree of Life?! Shock and confusion overcame Blood Oath as he watched Elder Wu.

The Tree of Life was a treasure that could tempt any superpower. It was capable of producing Water of Life, after all, which was necessary for resurrecting NPCs. A Tree of Life nurtured from a main branch could also bear Fruits of Life, which could increase Personal Guards’ Growth Potential. A source of such valuable items would be a significant boon to any superpower.

Blood Oath had been clear about his offer to help Thirteen Thrones eliminate Zero Wing’s few players for free, yet Elder Wu had decided to give up on this golden opportunity. It was utterly baffling.

War Blood and Starlink’s team wasn’t the only one confused. Heaven’s Blade’s members were just as astonished by the situation.

“What kind of person is he?” Prison Tiger muttered as he gazed at Shi Feng.

Elder Wu was famed for using force to get what he wanted on Dragonheart Island. He never even showed the other superpowers’ Guild Leaders any respect. Furthermore, he had fought two superpowers over a treasure at sea; the incident had shocked everyone on the island. That treasure had only been an Epic item, which wasn’t even in the same league as a main branch from the Tree of Life.

Prison Tiger had been certain that Elder Wu would move against Zero Wing, and Heaven’s Blade wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. Thirteen Thrones had never promised not to steal the branch from Zero Wing if the Guild’s team won it. If Elder Wu ordered an attack, he wouldn’t be breaking any promises.

But not only hadn’t Elder Wu attacked Shi Feng’s 4-man party. Rather, he had personally congratulated the Swordsman. For a moment, Prison Tiger even wondered if Shi Feng weren’t actually Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, but the leader of some Super Guild.

In truth, Elder Wu’s amicable greeting had even surprised Shi Feng. He had never expected the old man to take such a friendly tone with him.

After a moment of silence, Shi Feng smiled and replied, “Elder Wu, your praise is too generous. If I have time, I will certainly pay Thirteen Thrones a visit. I believe there are many ways a partnership between our Guilds could benefit us in God’s Domain.”

Based on Elder Wu’s attitude, Shi Feng realized that he wanted to form an alliance regarding the Tree of Life, which was wonderful news for Zero Wing. Not only was Thirteen Thrones a veteran Super Guild, but it also dominated a large section of the eastern continent. A partnership with Thirteen Thrones would greatly benefit Zero Wing’s development.

Moreover, nurturing a Tree of Life’s main branch wasn’t, by any means, easy. Doing so would require many precious resources. Even if Heaven’s Blade kept its main branch, the adventurer team didn’t have enough resources to grow it into a Tree of Life. In the end, it would only be a very expensive decoration.

“It’s a deal, then. Little Art will be overjoyed to hear this,” Elder Wu said, his smile becoming even more companionable with Shi Feng’s agreement.

“Of course. Zero Wing has always been open to working with Thirteen Thrones,” Shi Feng said, nodding.

He wasn’t joking about his interest in forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the Super Guild.

Thirteen Thrones’ territory on the eastern continent was one of flatlands and mountainous regions. Because of that, the Super Guild had access to all sorts of well-known ores, including materials required to produce Level 100-plus weapons and equipment.

This was the very reason that Thirteen Thrones had enjoyed such an advantage in acquiring Level 100-plus weapons and equipment during his previous life.

If Zero Wing could negotiate for a stable supply of materials from Thirteen Thrones, it could surpass other superpowers when it came to equipment production, and the Guild wouldn’t have to worry about a lack of materials due to limited territory.

Zero Wing still relied on the public market and the Secret Pavilion’s connections as its main source of materials, but neither source was reliable. The materials available on both markets depended on how willing the various powers were to sell their materials. If the various powers refused to sell, securing the materials Zero Wing needed would be considerably challenging.

Because the drop-rate for weapons and equipment decreased drastically after Level 100, the materials necessary for producing such items had reached astronomical prices, and supply had been extremely limited during Shi Feng’s previous life. Most of the market’s items had come from independent players, and there hadn’t been enough to support a Guild’s development.

This was also why first-rate Guilds hadn’t been able to outcompete superpowers after mainstream players had reached Level 100.

Meanwhile, everyone’s jaws hung open as they watched Shi Feng and Elder Wu’s pleasant conversation. As experts, they could all determine a player’s emotional state.

If Elder Wu had only been performing for the sake of propriety, he was now truly treating Shi Feng as a friend and speaking with the Swordsman as an equal. Not even Blood Oath, War Blood’s commander, qualified to receive such treatment.

After conversing for a short while, Shi Feng and Elder Wu parted ways. Keeping with his agreement with Heaven’s Blade, Shi Feng then guided the adventurer team’s members out of the Molten Ruin.

Black Flame! Blood Oath gnashed his teeth as he watched Shi Feng leave the hall alongside Heaven’s Blade’s team, his rage spilling forth and causing the players around him to shudder.

Blood Oath had already suffered a massive blow to his reputation after Shi Feng had slain him in the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion’s Residence, and now, he had to stand aside and watch the man lead Heaven’s Blade’s members out of his grasp. It was unprecedentedly humiliating. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Commander Blood, you need to calm down. Thirteen Thrones’ people are still here. Taking action now wouldn’t be appropriate,” Sword Demon quietly advised War Blood’s leader.

Shi Feng’s most recent display had proven that he could nearly rival Dragonheart Island’s three peerless monsters, and the man had just solidified a relationship with Thirteen Thrones. If War Blood and Starlink attacked Zero Wing’s small party now, they’d be digging their own graves.

With Sword Demon’s warning, Blood Oath calmed immediately. He then shifted his gaze toward Thirteen Thrones’ members, who stood a short distance away.

He realized that all of Thirteen Thrones’ members were staring at his team, and based on their postures, they were clearly prepared for battle. It left no room for doubt that Thirteen Thrones’ team would attack his if he tried to pull anything against Zero Wing.

Blood Oath was stupefied.

He could understand if Thirteen Thrones had simply intended to give up on the fight for the Tree of Life’s main branch and maintained a neutral stance, but the Super Guild’s players chose to side with Shi Feng. Blood Oath even wondered if they were putting on an act. Since when had Zero Wing and Thirteen Thrones been so friendly with each other?

Once Shi Feng’s group was out of sight from the altar hall, Blood Oath shifted his gaze toward Elder Wu.

“What is the meaning of this, Elder Wu?” Blood Oath boldly demanded. “Even if you hadn’t come for the Tree of Life, was it necessary to do this to us?!”

Blood Oath knew that even if they combined their strength, War Blood and Starlink were no match for Thirteen Thrones, but that didn’t mean that they couldn’t stand up to a Super Guild. Normally, he would’ve shown Thirteen Thrones the respect it deserved and let the matter slide. However, he couldn’t care less if he were being disrespectful to Elder Wu right now. Besides, Thirteen Thrones wouldn’t start a war with War Blood and Starlink over a simple question.

“I am doing this for your own good,” Elder Wu answered. Surprisingly, he wasn’t insulted by Blood Oath’s rudeness. He actually chuckled and shook his head.

“What do you mean?” Blood Oath’s anger grew. By protecting Zero Wing, Elder Wu had basically slapped him in the face, yet the old man was saying it had been for his own good. This was laughable.

“I know Demon Palace is supporting War Blood, so you think that you have nothing to fear on Dragonheart Island,” Elder Wu said as he shot Blood Oath a sidelong glance. Sneering, he continued, “However, I’m afraid that you aren’t aware that not long ago, Black Flame defeated Demon Palace’s main force members, who had been led by Evil Qilin himself. In fact, Black Flame very nearly killed Evil Qilin with one move. Now, Black Flame has been publicly acknowledged as a peerless monster. I’m sure the news will spread across Dragonheart Island soon. Now that you know, do you still wish to pick a fight with that Swordsman?”
