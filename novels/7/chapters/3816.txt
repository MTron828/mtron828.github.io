Chapter 891 – Nobody Is Allowed to Leave

The various powers’ members in the plaza went into a frenzy following the disappearance of the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key, frantically searching for the person who had redeemed it. Others contacted their respective superiors, causing the originally peaceful atmosphere to freeze.

You’re next.

Ignoring the commotion around him, Shi Feng redeemed the Empress’s Scales after acquiring the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key.

When Shi Feng entered the remnant primordial world, he thought that he would be fortunate if he could obtain enough Undying Souls to exchange for the Empress’s Scales. However, after the trade with Dragon’s Crown, he had over 50 million Undying Souls. Even after factoring in the 30 million Undying Souls he needed for the Empress’s Scales, he would have nearly 28 million Undying Souls left.

Although 28 million Undying Souls were nowhere near enough to let him exchange for the Flame God Set, it was enough to redeem the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key.

Once he had the Access Key, he would have a greater chance of gaining control over the Flame Dragon God’s Secret Land and turning it into Zero Wing’s backyard. This, in turn, would allow Zero Wing’s members to rise to Level 240 or higher without any bottlenecks.

I still have nearly 18 million left. What should I exchange them for? Shi Feng hesitated as he looked at the exchange list.

…

The executives of various powers operating in the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury received word of the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key’s redemption shortly after. The executives of ten pseudo-apex powers and over two dozen conglomerates immediately rushed back to the central plaza with their subordinates, none daring to drag their feet.

Meanwhile, the various powers’ members resting nearby also hurried to the central plaza.

Although only a small portion of the ten pseudo-apex powers’ forces was resting near the central plaza, their total forces still exceeded 30,000. The various conglomerates also had over 50,000 members resting nearby, while the independent players in the vicinity exceeded 100,000. Currently, all of these players had gathered outside the magic barriers enveloping the central plaza.

“How could you not have found out which pseudo-apex power redeemed the Access Key yet?! Why do you think I had you imbeciles keep an eye on this place?!” Ember Dragon, the Dragon God Palace’s First Vice Guild Leader, bellowed at the cloaked man before him.

“Vice Guild Leader, we’ve already checked several times. None of the pseudo-apex powers’ members were redeeming items at the time of the incident,” the cloaked man said anxiously. “But we did find over a dozen suspicious people. These people were all redeeming items when the Access Key disappeared.”

“Who are they?” Ember Dragon questioned coldly.

“Six of these people are members of four conglomerates, while eight are independent players. All eight independent players are executives of well-known adventurer teams. Besides them, there are three people from lesser-known Guilds, one of whom is closely related to Holy Dragon Spear,” the cloaked man reported in a trembling voice.

“Closely related to Holy Dragon Spear?” A cold glint flashed in Ember Dragon’s eyes. “Who is it?”

“Black Flame!” the cloaked man responded. Then, he hurriedly pulled up a video recording of Shi Feng and continued, “This is him. He used one of Holy Dragon Spear’s elder tokens to enter the plaza. Out of everyone in Holy Dragon Spear, only Apocalypse is qualified to hold that token…”

“The little man supporting Red Frost? It seems he has benefited from her rise,” Ember Dragon said, sneering as he looked at Shi Feng’s figure in the video. “Notify the other pseudo-apex powers. Tell them that we should lock down the plaza immediately if they still want the Access Key. Besides the pseudo-apex powers’ members, everyone else must stay put and hand over all their spatial bags. We can decide what to do with the Access Key after finding it.”

“Understood!” the cloaked man responded, then left to execute Ember Dragon’s command.

When the other nine pseudo-apex powers received Ember Dragon’s proposal, they all agreed to lock down the central plaza, prohibiting anyone from leaving. They also paid special attention to the 17 individuals suspected of having redeemed the Access Key.

…

Central Plaza:

“Why won’t you let us leave? Why must we hand over our spatial bags?”

“Do you know who we are? We are core members of the Star Dragon Conglomerate! What is the meaning of confining us here?!”

“Aren’t you pseudo-apex powers going too far? We paid you a bunch of Undying Souls to come here. Now, even though we haven’t redeemed anything, you want us to hand you all our items? Do you think we won’t retaliate?”

The many independent players and various conglomerates’ members were infuriated when they saw the internal magic barriers becoming active and the various pseudo-apex powers’ members pouring into the central plaza. They had never expected the various pseudo-apex powers to be so crazy.

Besides targeting the suspicious individuals, the various pseudo-apex powers also prohibited players who were not members of the various pseudo-apex powers from leaving. Those who wanted to leave had to turn over their spatial bags or die.

…

On the other side of the plaza, Xiao Yilong and the others, who had just finished exchanging their Undying Souls, also wore ugly expressions.

“Ember Dragon is definitely targeting you with this arrangement, Big Sis Frost!” Twilight Leaf expressed her anger after reading the message they had just received from Apocalypse. “Ember Dragon knows Guild Leader Black Flame must have brought a lot of resources since he is here to support you. If Guild Leader Black Flame’s possessions get confiscated, your partnership with him will become a joke to the various powers.”

“It is indeed a cunning move,” Xiao Yilong said grimly. “The Dragon God Palace alone might not be enough to threaten us, but if Ember Dragon gets the other pseudo-apex powers to cooperate with him, we will have no choice but to concede…”

“It can’t be helped.” Red Frost also understood the situation’s implications. After pondering for a moment, she said, “Yilong, go and meet up with the old commander. Have the old commander hold back those people as long as possible. In the meantime, I’ll find Guild Leader Black Flame and have him transfer his items to me.”

“Okay!” Upon hearing Red Frost’s decision, Xiao Yilong agreed this was the only thing they could do in this situation.
