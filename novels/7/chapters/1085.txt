Chapter 1086 – Miracle Appearing Once More

Watching the flood of Zero Wing’s members charge out of the destroyed Residence towards them, Blackwater’s members were stunned.

Based on the reports they had received, Zero Wing’s members in Stone Forest Town had been concentrated on the Magic Towers and town walls. A portion had also been dispatched to repel Pantheon’s three legions. Hence, the Guild shouldn’t have any more manpower to defend its Residence.

Yet, now, several hundred players had emerged. Moreover, their weapons, equipment, and levels were all top class. How could they not be shocked?

However, Blackwater’s members did not consider the matter overmuch.

They currently had 10,000 players surrounding Zero Wing’s Residence. Among them, several hundred were expert players. With so much open space, Zero Wing could not rely on terrain to fight such a large force.

Blackwater members relaxed their tense hearts as they charged to meet their enemies. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In the next moment, several hundred of Blackwater’s MTs raised their shields and slammed into the approaching Zero Wing members.

Peng... Peng... Peng...

As if they had been hit by a truck, Blackwater’s forefront MTs flew through the air and crashed into the crowd of players behind them. Not only had the initial clash shattered the Truth Shields and Protection the Clerics and Oracles had cast on these MTs, but the MTs’ HPs also dropped considerably.

Moreover, among the Zero Wing members in the frontal charge, none showed signs of grouping up to fight their enemies. Instead, they split up and squeezed their way into the Blackwater crowd before them. This caused issues for Blackwater’s ranged players.

After God’s Domain had undergone several system upgrades, even players on the same team could damage each other with their attacks.

If the ranged players launched their Spells and attacks into such a cramped area, there were only two possible outcomes; either they hit their mark, or they harmed their allies.

To make matters worse, the Blackwater melee players couldn’t stop Zero Wing members from splitting up.

As if these Zero Wing members were high on drugs, they all displayed the Strength of Lord ranked monsters of the same level, with some even surpassing Lords. Blackwater’s army couldn’t even block Zero Wing’s members, much less stop them.

“Who are these people?!”

As players throughout God’s Domain watched this fight, they were stupefied.

These several hundred Zero Wing members were too powerful. They looked like tigers pouncing on a flock of sheep. From time to time, one could see numerous Blackwater members flying through the air. This looked like a battle between superhumans and ordinary people. It was a completely one-sided slaughter...

Less than a minute since the battle had begun, Blackwater’s army had lost over a thousand members. Moreover, this number rose rapidly.

The massive gap in Attributes and combat techniques rendered Blackwater’s elite army helpless.

“Guild Leader, these people seems to have active Berserk Skills. I suggest that we retreat for now and wait until their Skills’ durations run out. We’re at a disadvantage right now,” Laughing Drunkard quickly suggested.

“I understand. Order everyone split up. Ranged players will work to pin Zero Wing’s members down.” Abandoned Wave’s eyes twitched with anger as he watched the massacre before him. “Once their Skills run out, I want them taken care of!”

Berserk Skills were extremely rare in God’s Domain. Even Blackwater, with its bountiful resources and strong influence, had only obtained a small number, and only a minority of the Guild’s experts had qualified to learn one. Ordinary experts should not dream of wielding their own.

Yet, Zero Wing had managed to supply Berserk Skills to several hundred players.

With just several hundred players, Zero Wing had forced Blackwater’s elite army to flee like rats.

This was the first time they had witnessed anything like this in God’s Domain.

As time passed, Blackwater suffered more casualties. In contrast, Zero Wing’s several hundred players had extremely few deaths.

“Are Heaven’s Burial’s members not here yet?!” Abandoned Wave demanded anxiously.

Normally, Berserk Skills should only for last two or three minutes at best, yet nearly five minutes had gone by, and Zero Wing’s members still fought vigorously. On the other hand, over half of his elite army was dead. This was a nightmare.

“Guild Leader, they’ve reached the town’s entrance and are currently making their way here,” Laughing Drunkard responded.

...

Meanwhile, 3,000 players had gathered inside the underground first-floor hall of Zero Wing’s Residence. As time passed, more players joined them.

“Guild Leader, Heaven’s Burial’s members have reached the town. Can we start now?”

“That’s right! If we let the main force continue their slaughter, they’ll steal the war’s contributions!”

“Guild Leader, just say the word! We’ll make those bastards from Blackwater beg for mercy!”

The Zero Wing elite members that had used the Guild Transfer Scrolls to teleport to the Residence were starving for action.

As they hadn’t been able to teleport in earlier, they had been forced to watch the war from so far away. Even though their allies were being slaughtered, they hadn’t been able to do anything to help. The building frustration had been intolerable. If not for the Guild’s upper echelons stopping them from running to Stone Forest Town, they would’ve braved the journey.

Instead of responding to his Guild members, Shi Feng contacted Aqua Rose and asked, “Aqua, can you see Heaven’s Burial’s members yet?”

“They’ve already arrived. They are headed towards the Guild Residence. Initial estimates put their numbers above 30,000,” Aqua Rose reported.

Nodding, Shi Feng smiled and said, “Excellent. Your teams can retreat. Try to lure as many people to the Residence as possible.”

“Lure them over?” Aqua Rose was somewhat confused.

Although she knew that the seal on the town had been lifted, the Guild Residence’s wide, open space was not a strategic location for a battle.

However, Aqua Rose couldn’t care less. The Red Jade Legion before her was simply too powerful. Even though everyone from the Dark Gods Legion had activated their Berserk Skills, many of the Red Jade Legion’s members had their own. If they continued to clash with the Red Jade Legion, it was only a matter of time before they were annihilated.

...

“Guild Leader Wave, I’ve made you wait,” Singular Burial, who rode a horned lizard that was over two meters tall, greeted as he slowly approached Abandoned Wave.

On his way here, he had heard plenty of news about the battle in Stone Forest Town.

He had rejoiced when he heard the reports. He inwardly celebrated the fact that he had not led his Guild and joined the initial assault on Stone Forest Town. Otherwise, Heaven’s Burial’s fate would have been far worse than Blackwater’s.

Just as Abandoned Wave was about to respond to Singular Burial, he discovered a change in the man’s face. Right now, Singular Burial wore an incomparably gloomy expression.

Seeing Singular Burial’s ill complexion, Abandoned Wave asked curiously, “Guild Leader Burial?”

Now that Heaven’s Burial’s vanguard army had arrived, victory was within their reach. It was also only a matter of time before Heaven’s Burial’s remaining army arrived. Right now, Singular Burial should be quite pleased, not wearing such an ugly look.

“I just received news that the seal on Stone Forest Town has been destroyed!” Singular Burial explained awkwardly.

“You’re saying Zero Wing has lifted the seal on Stone Forest Town?” Abandoned Wave immediately paled.

With the seal lifted, Zero Wing could send an endless stream of reinforcements into Stone Forest Town. They had exhausted so much effort to annihilate most of Zero Wing’s 20,000 members defending Stone Forest Town. If another forty or fifty thousand joined the fray...

“Wait; something’s not right. Stone Forest Town’s seal should’ve lifted quite some time ago. Why are so few of them here right now?” Singular Burial suddenly felt as if something were amiss when he glanced at the empty Zero Wing Residence.

However, as soon as he finished speaking, he felt the threat of death wash over him.

Singular Burial wasn’t the only one to experience the feeling. All of the players within Zero Wing’s Residence felt it as well. Moreover, this feeling grew more intense as the seconds ticked by.

Boom!

Suddenly, the ground beneath Zero Wing’s Residence exploded, and a tall tower emerged from the ruins. When this tower appeared, everyone felt as if they were suffocating.

This tower was none other than the Obelisk Shi Feng had unsealed when he had first captured Stone Forest Town.
