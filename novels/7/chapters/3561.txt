Chapter 636 – Primordial Chaos Body

Zero Wing’s Residence, Guild Hall, top floor:

Under Hidden Soul’s lead, Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss arrived in front of the Guild Leader’s Office. At this time, though, both of them wore solemn expressions, the calmness they previously wore in the lobby nowhere to be seen.

The Guild Hall’s top floor had always been off-limits to non-internal members of the Guild. Adding on the fact all of the Guild Hall’s primary functions could be accessed from the first floor, outer members of Zero Wing had never really cared whether they could access the Guild Hall’s top floor. Not to mention, every Guild had its own secrets, so it was understandable for Zero Wing to have some secrets that it might not want non-internal members to know on the top floor.

However, after arriving at the Guild Hall’s top floor, Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss found that compared to the lower floors, this place was akin to a completely different world.

Indeed!

The top floor of Zero Wing’s Guild Hall could only be described as a whole other world!

After all, even though the Crystal City of Secrets had yet to see any players successfully getting promoted to Tier 6, they had seen at least a dozen Tier 6 players present on the top floor of Zero Wing’s Guild Hall. Moreover, each of these Tier 6 players were akin to bona fide Gods, and simply standing in the presence of these players’ residual mana caused the two of them to suffocate.

It should be known that the two of them were among the strongest experts operating in the Crystal City. Even though they were still at Tier 5, they were more than strong enough to fight Tier 6 players of the same level. Yet, every one of the Tier 6 experts loitering in the top floor’s hallway instilled a sense of danger in them.

When players reached the fifth-floor standard, also known as the Extrasensory Realm, their sixth sense would become incredibly accurate. If their senses told them a player posed a threat to their lives, it meant that they would have trouble even escaping from said player, let alone match or defeat the other party in a fight.

With such a frightening force at Zero Wing’s disposal, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that even if all of the Crystal City’s powers banded together, they still probably wouldn’t be a match for Zero Wing. Yet, despite Zero Wing having such a force, none of Zero Wing’s outer members were privy to this information.

At this time, Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss were already close to losing their confidence in negotiating better conditions for themselves.

Meanwhile, after opening the doors to the Guild Leader’s Office, Hidden Soul said to Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss, “Head on in. The Guild Leader is waiting inside.”

Although Hidden Soul did not personally involve herself in the Guild’s basic operations, she had still heard of Zero Wing’s Three Overlords, particularly Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss. In terms of influence over Zero Wing’s outer members, Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss had exceeded even Zero Wing’s Guild Leader.

…

Zero Wing’s Guild Leader’s Office:

When Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss stepped into the room, a dense wave of Eternal Energy washed over them, invigorating their mind and body. Immediately afterward, they couldn’t help but be shocked by the scene in front of them. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Currently, inside the spacious office, a young man could be seen sitting behind the sole desk in the room, holding a pulsating golden heart in his hand. Despite being a Tier 5 player, the young man exuded an aura comparable to the Tier 6 experts in the hallway. Meanwhile, the golden heart the young man held released a dense cloud of Eternal Energy into its surroundings every time it pulsated.

What dense Eternal Energy! Heavy Abyss mentally exclaimed when she felt the Eternal Energy surrounding her. If I try to construct an Epic Divine Body in such an environment, I can probably raise my success rate by a minimum of 30%!

“That’s a…Primordial Chaos Body?” Unlike Heavy Abyss, Fervent Samsara’s attention was focused on the pulsating golden heart in Shi Feng’s hand. His reaction toward the heart was so intense that even his voice trembled when he spoke. “How is this possible?!”

“A Primordial Chaos Body?” Shi Feng was a little taken aback by the words from Fervent Samsara’s mouth. “Do you recognize this thing?”

The reason Shi Feng was openly researching the golden heart in his office was to intimidate Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss.

Currently, Zero Wing was in urgent need of capable experts to accelerate its development. It was especially so now that Billowing Water had used her City Building Order as collateral. If Zero Wing could establish a Guild City on the Western Continent, the Guild would need many fifth-floor experts to help defend its city.

Meanwhile, during Shi Feng’s previous life, Fervent Samsara and Heavy Abyss were incredibly strong and famous individuals. If he could get them to become Zero Wing’s internal members and move into Star Lake City, many fifth-floor experts would also move with them. At that time, Zero Wing would no longer have to worry about lacking experts to use.

However, Shi Feng didn’t expect someone to recognize the golden heart he had taken out for display.

Shi Feng wasn’t ignorant of the Primordial Chaos Body. It was a kind of Godly Relic that came into existence along with the Greater God’s Domain. According to rumors, Primordial Chaos Bodies possessed unimaginable strength, and Primordial Gods had relied on them to construct their Divine Bodies.

However, such Godly Relics had thoroughly disappeared from the Greater God’s Domain during the Mythical Era. If any Primordial Chaos Bodies still existed in the modern era, they could most likely be found in the ruins of Primordial Gods. This was why the various powers were fanatics when it came to exploring Primordial God ruins. They were so desperate that they wouldn’t let even clues pertaining to Ancient God ruins slip past them.

“I was fortunate enough to see a Primordial Chaos Body once in an Ancient God’s Legacy,” Fervent Samsara said, taking on a respectful tone when he spoke to Shi Feng. “The one I saw was a golden brain. Similar to the golden heart in your hand, the brain felt like a living object, and it naturally diffused liquid-like Eternal Energy into its surroundings. The Ancient God in question used the Primordial Chaos Body to create a Divine Body suitable for himself. As for the Ancient God’s name, many people have heard of it. In modern times, he is known as the God of Four Elements.”

“No wonder.” Realization dawned on Shi Feng when he heard Fervent Samsara’s explanation.

The God of Four Elements might be vastly inferior to the Goddess of Space, but the Four Gods Secret Art he developed was publicly acknowledged as a Secret Art capable of rivaling Gold Combat Techniques, and players could use it to transcend tiers. Moreover, the God of Four Elements was rumored to be an Ancient God capable of rivaling Primordial Gods in strength.

“I have a presumptuous request, Guild Leader Black Flame.” All of a sudden, Fervent Samsara looked at Shi Feng with a serious gaze and solemnly said, “Can you let me experience the Primordial Chaos Body once? I am willing to accept any conditions.”

“Are you crazy, Samsara?” Heavy Abyss couldn’t help but look at Fervent Samsara in astonishment. She didn’t think the other party would dare make such a bold request.

The Primordial Chaos Body was so well-known that even a solo player like herself had heard about it. She also knew how precious it was. Hence, should any power get its hands on a Primordial Chaos Body, apart from its core executives, there was no way it would let other players use it.

Not to mention, according to rumors, it cost a mind-boggling five million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal to use the Primordial Chaos Body each time. This was a sum that could cause any conglomerate to wince in pain.

Meanwhile, Fervent Samsara was only an outer member of the Guild. Moreover, did he not see the Tier 6 experts in the hallway outside? Even among Tier 6 players, the individuals in the hallway were far above the average.

“Sure, I can agree to your request. Moreover, I can extend this offer to not just Samsara, but you as well, Abyss,” Shi Feng said, a smile suddenly forming on his face.
