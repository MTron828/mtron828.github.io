When he was done reading the details of the three large training centers and guild buildings, Shi Feng took a deep breath.

The City Lord really knows how to tempt people,?Shi Feng thought as he wryly smiled.

The pricing of the three properties was relatively fair. After all, this was the city center they were talking about. The average medium training center there would typically have an annual rent of 50 million Star Coins and an upfront cost of one million contribution points. Meanwhile, the average medium training center could only accommodate up to 400 people.

Originally, Shi Feng had only planned to rent a medium training center or guild building.

After all, Zero Wing had only made a couple of million Star Coins in the Miniature Ancient World thus far. He would even have to sell some contribution points to afford a medium training center.

However, the price-to-performance ratio of the three large training centers and guild buildings was so good that Shi Feng couldn’t help but be tempted.

The large training center in Sector 78 was particularly attractive. It had a whopping five Advanced Combat Simulation Rooms and fifteen Special Quarters. These were facilities that could only be accessed through spending contribution points. Even then, there were not enough of these facilities available to meet the high demand.

Take the Star Lake Training Center, for example. It had 100 Advanced Combat Simulation Rooms, and it cost 2,000 Star Coins and 100 contribution points to use them every time. However, despite the high cost, they would be fully booked by the Star Lake Legion’s members every day.

Advanced Combat Simulation Rooms were in such high demand because they allowed users to engage directly in simulation warfare. In addition, so long as users had detailed information on a player, they could simulate any player they wanted to fight against. This would grant users a realistic experience of fighting against their desired opponents, and it was not an experience that the Basic and Intermediate Combat Simulation Rooms could provide.

As for the Special Quarters, while they weren’t comparable to the living quarters found on the God’s Domain Association’s 600th floor and above, they did come equipped with a mental strength training room. This training room could enhance the efficiency of users’ mental strength development, and even two-star mental strength grandmasters could receive significant benefits from it.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the main reason most rookie geniuses in the Greater World chose to join a corporation or a powerful family was so that they could have stable access to Advanced Combat Simulation Rooms and Special Quarters.

It seems I have no choice but to take a gamble.

Shi Feng gritted his teeth and used all four million of his contribution points to bid on Sector 78’s large training center. That was one million more points than the minimum bid.

Generally, the various powers wouldn’t exceed 20% of the minimum price when bidding for real estate in a third-tier city. After all, what the various powers mainly wanted were the residential slots. If the price exceeded the minimum by more than 20%, it’d be better if they bought other properties.

As for how Shi Feng was supposed to pay for the large training center’s annual rent of 140 million Star Coins, after much deliberation, he decided that he would exchange God Crystal Fragments for Star Coins.

Many experts in the Holy World would gladly buy God Crystal Fragments using Star Coins. Each fragment could easily sell for eight to ten thousand Star Coins.

In addition, Shi Feng could also sell some of his Seven Luminaries Crystals. Even in the Holy World, Seven Luminaries Crystals could still be sold for a lot of Star Coins.

And if worse came to worst, he could always borrow some Star Coins from the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate. Of course, he would only do so as a last resort. After all, doing so would cause him to owe the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate a favor.

Meanwhile, as soon as Shi Feng wrote down his bid, his quantum watch immediately notified him that four million contribution points had been deducted from his account.

With this, I’ve become poorer than even some reserve participants now… Shi Feng wryly smiled as he looked at the numbers displayed on his quantum watch.

Originally, Shi Feng had planned to buy a drop of Stardew after bidding on a medium guild building. It was so that he could step into the realm of mental strength grandmasters earlier. Now, though, he couldn’t even afford to stay in the living quarters on the God’s Domain Association’s 600th floor, let alone purchase Stardew…

“Are you alright, Guild Leader?” Hidden Soul asked as she walked over to Shi Feng and noticed the wry smile on his face. It should be known that Shi Feng was in a very good mood when they were on their way to the Star Lake Training Center.

“It’s nothing. I just became poorer,” Shi Feng explained.

“Poor?” Hidden Soul was rendered speechless by Shi Feng’s answer.

Four million contribution points. With this many points, Shi Feng could already be considered one of the wealthiest people in Star Lake City. If Shi Feng considered himself poor, everyone else in the city would be beggars.

However, Shi Feng did not clarify the misunderstanding. He couldn’t afford to let anyone know he was aiming at Sector 78’s large training center. Otherwise, he would run the risk of facing malicious competition. If a corporation or powerful family decided to compete against him for the training center, he would lose without a doubt. After all, the city’s various powers had collected a ton of contribution points from the Star Lake Legion’s participants. Added together, these participants had far more contribution points than he did.

Beep… Beep… Beep…

While Shi Feng was pondering in silence, his quantum watch suddenly issued a series of message prompts and warning prompts.

What’s going on?

Shi Feng was a little stunned by the information displayed on his watch.

Out of the six prompts he received, five were message prompts, and these messages came from Amber Soul, Cheng Xin, Leroja, Cross, and Desolate Fury. All five of them had messaged him almost simultaneously.

Their messages also more or less had the same content:

Log into God’s Domain ASAP!

As for the sixth prompt, it was a warning message from the Main God System.

…

System: Warning! Warning! It is detected that you are away from God’s Domain. Please log into God’s Domain within ten minutes. If you do not log into God’s Domain in ten minutes, you will have to start over with a new character.

…

If his quantum watch wasn’t linked to his God’s Domain account, Shi Feng would have thought that this was a scam message. This was because he had never heard of a situation where the Main God System required players to log back into God’s Domain within a stipulated time after they had logged out of the game, let alone being threatened with account deletion.

However, Shi Feng knew that the Main God System was not joking. Amber Soul and the others had messaged him to log back into God’s Domain almost simultaneously. This more or less indicated that the system’s message wasn’t a hoax.

Ten minutes?

Shi Feng frowned when he saw how little time he was given to log back into the game. There was no way he could make it back to the God’s Domain Association in under ten minutes.

While Shi Feng was trying to think of a solution, Hidden Soul also received a warning prompt on her quantum watch, the system’s message confusing her greatly.

“Guild Leader, I just received a warning from the system telling me to log back into God’s Domain within ten minutes. Otherwise, I’m going to have to restart my account,” Hidden Soul said. “Could this be a hoax?”

“No, it shouldn’t be fake. I also received the same warning,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “Something big must have happened in God’s Domain for the system to issue such an urgent warning.”

“But how can we get back to the Association in ten minutes?” Hidden Soul asked, her anxiety rising when she heard Shi Feng’s words.

The God’s Domain Association was half an hour away from the Star Lake Training Center by car. Unless they could fly, there was no way they could reach the Association in under ten minutes.

“Don’t worry. We are official participants of the Star Lake Legion, so we can borrow the training center’s living quarters,” Shi Feng said. Then, he promptly led Hidden Soul toward the Star Lake Training Center’s living quarters.

Meanwhile, shortly after Shi Feng and Hidden Soul left the Real Estate Center, an uproar occurred throughout the entire Star Lake City.

Almost simultaneously, many players in Star Lake City had received the same warning from the system, and everyone couldn’t help but panic. At the same time, a shocking piece of news also started to spread across the city.

A new Realm had emerged in the Greater God’s Domain!
