Chapter 2766 – Ancient Era

In a valley amid some lofty mountains, a team of nearly 5,000 people frantically fought a group of Demons. The battlefield was crazed and spectacular and looked just like a battlefield in ancient times.

Both sides suffered severe casualties, their blood staining the valley red. The smell of blood carried for tens of thousands of yards; even those inured to battle would find this situation uncomfortable and unbearable.

However, neither side showed any intention of stopping, both prepared to fight to the bitter end.

Of the two armies battering each other, the Demon army was led by a Level 135, Tier 4 Great Demon, while a woman led the human army.

The woman in question possessed golden hair and crimson eyes. She wielded a silver sacred sword and was clad in a knight’s blue sacred armor. As the woman contended against several dozen Level 130-plus, Tier 3 Demons, her HP continuously decreased. However, despite being at a complete disadvantage, the more she fought, the brighter the glow her sacred sword radiated. The power she exhibited also kept increasing.

“Dammit! You’re actually using the Aria of Holy Blood?! Don’t even think I will let you finish it!” The Tier 4 Great Demon’s expression turned solemn when he saw the glowing sacred sword. Immediately, he spread out his four wings and flew toward the crimson-eyed woman.

“Everyone, protect the Commander! Do not let that Great Demon approach the Commander!” a tall man shouted before rushing at the Great Demon with his golden shield raised.

Subsequently, several dozen other melee classes nearby also charged at the Great Demon, all of them ignoring the fact that they were merely at Tier 2.

“Scram!”

Seeing the crowd charging at him, the Demon Commander pulled out his crimson greatsword and slashed the space in front.

Over a hundred crimson beams shot forth, tearing apart space as they advanced. The power they carried simply wasn’t something even Tier 3 existences could dream of withstanding.

Boom!

The next moment, the several dozen Tier 2 melee classes were instantly vaporized, while the shield-bearing man was sent smashing into the mountain.

“Dammit! I’ll kill you!”

When a man standing nearby saw this scene, his eyes turned bloodshot, and he promptly charged at the Great Demon with his sword raised.

However, before this man could even get near the Great Demon, the long-range Spells of several Tier 3 Demons had already killed him.

In the meantime, blood had already dyed the body of the crimson-eyed woman fighting several dozen Tier 3 Demons. Her complexion was also deathly pale. However, despite the state of her body, her gaze remained indescribably firm.

“Be punished, Demons!” the crimson-eyed female knight bellowed as she raised her sacred sword.

The sacred sword released a beam of light that shot to the skies. Countless streaks of light then rained down on the valley like shooting stars, and the Demons struck by these shooting stars immediately fell into a heavily injured state. The situation on the battlefield reversed in the blink of an eye. “Kill! We cannot let these Demons take even a step into human territory!” the crimson-eyed knight shouted, her pale complexion showing no signs of fatigue. She then raised her sacred sword and charged at the Demons who were still fighting

The female knight’s words stimulated the surviving humans. They began madly fighting against the Demons.

However, after a few exchanges, the humans present were dumbfounded, staring at a distant pile of Demon corpses in disbelief.

The next moment, the Great Demon Commander, who was over a dozen meters tall, emerged from this pile of corpses, a hint of mockery and contempt on his face. “The Aria of Holy Blood is indeed powerful. And for you to still be alive after using this desperate move, your mental willpower is truly astonishing. I’m certain you can rank among the top Tier 4 powerhouses,” the Great Demon said as he looked at the crimson-eyed knight. He then asked mockingly, “But can you use it a second time?”

At this Great Demon’s words, the complexions of the surviving humans instantly turned ashen.

This was the Aria of Holy Blood they were talking about!

This was the Sacred Sword Blood Moon’s Unique Spell. Most people would be able to use it only once before departing for the netherworld. This was because the consequent pain of the body and mind was not something ordinary people could bear. However, in return for the steep price, once the Aria of Holy Blood was cast, it exerted astonishing power. Even a Great Demon would sustain heavy injuries and lose half of their HP after getting struck by this move. Moreover, without restoration items such as the Water of Life, it would be impossible to recover from the attack.

Yet, now...

Needless to say, it would be impossible for the female knight to use Aria of the Holy Blood again. However, with the humans’ current combat power, they were no match for the Great Demon.

After all, the Great Demon before them was a bona fide Demon Marquis. The purity of his Bloodline was far superior to that of ordinary Great Demons.

“Since you no longer have any other moves to make, it’s my turn now.” When the Great Demon saw the silent humans before him, an indescribably excited and joyful expression appeared on his face.

“Don’t even think about it!”

The female knight suddenly appeared above the Great Demon’s head and brandished her sacred sword.

Three phantom swords appeared in the sky, the sight stunning everyone present.

“This is...the Sword Saint Lord Lockes’s personal technique, Sky Cleaver!”

“The Commander actually mastered it?”

When the surviving humans saw the three phantom swords in the sky, a look of awe and admiration appeared on their faces.

“You’re already on your last breath, yet you’re still putting up such boring resistance?” When the Great Demon saw the three phantom swords, he did not reveal any awe or fear whatsoever. On the contrary, he nonchalantly brandished his greatsword.

The greatsword and three phantom swords collided, the resulting shockwave sent both humans and Demons stumbling backward.

Large cracks formed on the ground the Great Demon stood on, and the greatsword the Great Demon wielded let out a low hum. The Great Demon’s arms were also trembling.

Upon seeing this scene, the humans felt both encouraged and excited.

Sure enough, a Sword Saint’s personal technique was truly extraordinary!

However, a moment later, everyone’s joy turned into despair because the crimson-eyed knight hadn’t fared too well, either. Not only was her complexion paler, but even her pupils had begun to fade. It was evident that she was on her last breath; she could no longer fight.

“Hahaha! Amazing! Amazing! This is the first time I, Nemen Carlo, have seen a powerful Tier 4 human like you!” The Great Demon burst out laughing as he looked at the female knight. “However, it all ends here. Before you die, I will drag you all down to hell first!”

After saying so, Nemen Carlo began chanting the incantation for the Tier 4 Spell Hell’s Gate.

Suddenly, the sky darkened. A huge door decorated with skulls appeared, the blood-red glow from the skulls’ eye sockets and the agonizing screams coming from the door seemingly telling everyone that their destiny was about to end.

Even if the humans present wished to interrupt Nemen Carlo’s Spell, they couldn’t do so, as the surviving Demons were doing their best to stop them.

However, just as the formation of the Hell’s Gate was about to culminate, a spatial tear over a thousand yards long suddenly split the sky. The resulting spatial storm not only disrupted the Mana in the sky but even shattered the magic array summoning the Hell’s Gate. Afterward, several figures fell out of the spatial tear and crashed onto the battlefield in the valley, their landing sending clouds of dust into the air.

“So, this is the ancient era?” The man standing in the lead of the group muttered in amazement as he glanced at the world around him.
