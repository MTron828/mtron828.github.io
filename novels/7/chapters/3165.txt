Chapter 240 – Greater World

Inside a training room filled with all kinds of state-of-the-art training equipment, a group of young men and women around 20 years of age and dressed in dark, tight clothing were frantically fighting multiple six-armed Demons on a stage that measured 50 meters in length and width.

If the various superpowers’ peak geniuses were to see this, they would definitely be shocked.

This was because the six-armed demons on the stage were Blade Demons, Tier 4 Great Demons. Moreover, even though the six-meter-tall Blade Demons were only holographic simulations, they fought like real existences, their every attack causing the youths to stumble and retreat. Whenever these youths received a direct blow from the Blade Demons, they would even get knocked back by three meters. It didn’t look like the Blade Demons were simulations at all.

However, the fact that these youths were getting pushed around didn’t mean they were weak. On the contrary, they were extraordinarily strong for youths of their age. On top of having the physical fitness of Henglian masters, every one of these youths possessed incredibly high combat standards, with some having already reached the Void Realm. In addition, every one of them had already reached the Realms of Truth’s Truth Realm and could apply the Truth Realm’s principles to real-world combat.

After the battle continued for around twenty minutes, the youths eventually defeated all of the Blade Demons and breathed a deep sigh of relief.

“Today’s training is finally over,” a young man sweating profusely said after collapsing onto the stage. “I thought I was going to fail just now. I’ll probably be kicked out if I fail again...”

“Consider yourself lucky that we have a lot of talented newcomers this time. Otherwise, we would have definitely lost this battle,” a short-haired girl of roughly similar age said to the young man. Then, she looked toward a silver-haired girl kneeling near her and said enviously, “Aren’t you improving a little too quickly, Wu Xiaoxiao? Even though we are all newcomers here, you have already caught up to the earlier batch of trainees that joined three months ago. At this rate, it probably wouldn’t be long before you get shortlisted.”

“No, I still have a long way to go compared to you all, Senior Sister. Moreover, there are countless geniuses here, but only ten will get shortlisted. Even those at the Domain Realm wouldn’t necessarily get chosen,” Wu Xiaoxiao said, shaking her head. However, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of yearning at the mention of getting shortlisted.

“By the way, Xiaoxiao, I heard that the Guild your little sister is in has done something amazing this time,” the short-haired girl suddenly said. “I can’t believe Zero Wing was one of the parties responsible for activating the new expansion pack. Everyone in God’s Domain is talking about it right now. Zero Wing will definitely gain a significant advantage over the various superpowers.”

“It doesn’t matter even if Zero Wing gets an advantage over the various superpowers,” the young man lying on the ground said disdainfully. “Superpowers are as numerous as the stars among the myriad God’s Domains, and most of these superpowers can barely survive in the Greater God’s Domain. Xiaoxiao, seeing as you are so talented, your little sister should be quite talented as well, right? If you make further improvements, you’ll be able to bring your little sister here. If your little sister wants to make any noteworthy accomplishments in the future, it’s best if she comes to us.”[1]

The short-haired girl nodded in agreement. If Wu Xiaoxiao’s younger sister wished to have a better life in the future,

“Bring Lingling over?” When Wu Xiaoxiao thought of Wu Lingling, who was more talented than she was, a hint of resolve appeared in her eyes.

Zero Wing might have powerful instructors and God-ranked experts, but in this place, reaching Tier 6 was only a beginning.[1] Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Moreover, so long as Wu Lingling came to this place, she’d be able to understand the true extent of God’s Domain. She would realize that their God’s Domain or the Miniature Ancient World were nothing but insignificant existences.

…

God’s Domain Association Building, Zero Wing’s temporary office:

“Something big happened, Guild Leader!” Blackie said after hurriedly entering the room. “People from the G-Green God Corporation are here! They’re asking to have a chat with you!”

“The Green God Corporation?” Shi Feng was a little surprised when he heard Blackie’s words.

The Green God Corporation was the largest corporation in their world, bar none. Be it their world’s God’s Domain or miracle potions like the S-rank Nutrient Fluids and Life Potions, all these things came from the Green God Corporation. Because of this, once powers in God’s Domain grew to a certain extent, it was inevitable for them to make contact with the Green God Corporation.

However, no matter how Shi Feng looked at it, the current Zero Wing was nowhere near strong enough to catch the Green God Corporation’s attention. After all, the standard of technology and manpower the Green God Corporation possessed was far beyond the imagination of any superpower. The corporation was so powerful that not even the Five Great Super Guilds were worthy of its attention.

Although Zero Wing currently possessed considerable fame in the Miniature Ancient World and even had fourth-floor experts safeguarding it, these were still insignificant matters to the Green God Corporation.

Hence, Shi Feng found it incredibly hard to imagine why the Green God Corporation would take the initiative to seek out Zero Wing.

“Do you want to meet them?” Blackie asked quietly.

“I don’t think we have a choice in this,” Shi Feng said with a bitter smile. “Go and greet them. I’ll see you in the reception room later.”

“Understood.” Blackie hurriedly left to make the necessary preparations.

The Green God Corporation was an existence far above even the Flower of Seven Sins. If they accidentally provoked the Green God Corporation’s people, Zero Wing would probably cease to exist before the day ended.

…

God’s Domain Association Building, top-floor reception room:

When Shi Feng, Su Qianliu, and Blackie, stepped into the reception room that was roughly the size of a basketball court, they found that around a dozen people were already seated in the room. Out of these dozen or so people, even the weakest among them was a Henglian grandmaster with physical fitness far beyond the average person. Even Su Qianliu, who had already reached the Henglian master standard, found herself feeling suffocated when standing in the presence of these people, her mind warning her to stay as far away from these people as possible.

After seeing the arrival of Shi Feng’s group, the young woman sitting at the head of the Green God Corporation’s group took the initiative to stand up and introduce herself, “Hello, I am Xia Qingyin, Vice President of the Green God Corporation.”

“Hello, I am Shi Feng, Zero Wing’s Acting Guild Leader,” Shi Feng responded, feeling a little surprised when he saw the young woman before him. However, he did not show his surprise on his face as he calmly asked, “May I know what business you have with Zero Wing, Vice President Xia?”

Xia Qingying!

The young woman might look like she was in her early twenties, but Shi Feng knew that the other party was even older than he currently was. Meanwhile, in addition to being one of the Green God Corporation’s core executives, she also possessed extraordinary individual strength. Most importantly, she was a mental strength grandmaster.

If Xia Qingying wanted to, she could single-handedly wipe the floor with every person in this room…

“I see that you are a straightforward person, Guild Leader Shi Feng,” Xia Qingying said, a smile forming on her face as she scrutinized Shi Feng. “In that case, I’ll get straight to the point. I am here today to make a deal with Zero Wing. I heard that Zero Wing had received five million Star Coins from the Galaxy Corporation previously. The Green God Corporation is willing to sell Zero Wing a slot to the Greater World. I am sure Zero Wing should know how valuable the Greater World’s entry slots are, right? As for the price, it’ll be five million Star Coins. How about it?”

TL Notes:

[1]bring your little sister here || in this place:

I don’t know where exactly “here” or “this place” is referring to. The author decided to be incredibly vague here for some reason.

Following Chapter 54, “here”/”this place” should be referring to Crimson Emperor, but the author might not be referring to Crimson Emperor, so I’ll leave things vague.
