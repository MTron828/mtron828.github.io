Chapter 2768 – Repelling Demons, Sacred Sword Blood Moon

As Shi Feng swung his longsword, innumerable dazzling stars suddenly formed around him. Now that he had reached Tier 4 and had the assistance of a Mana Domain, this Sword’s Transmigration was more than twice as strong as when he executed it at Tier 3.

Boom!

The next moment, the dazzling stars shattered the descending flower petals and attacked the Demon Leaders. Before the Demon Leaders could react, they were already flying back over a hundred yards away, their HPs decreasing in large chunks. They even had difficulty standing up.

“He’s...strong! He sent so many Demon Leaders flying with just one move. Could he really have been sent here from the Holy City?!” “Tier 4! Crap! This aura definitely belongs to a Tier 4 class! He’s a Tier 4 Sword Emperor!”

“With that power, he’s a powerhouse even among other Tier 4 classes!”

Everyone was momentarily stunned by this development. None of them thought that the seemingly ordinary Shi Feng would send over a dozen Demon Leaders flying in one move. Moreover, he was even a bona fide Tier 4 Sword Emperor, an existence capable of rivaling Tier 4 Great Demons.

“Yu Luo, your fellow countryman is so strong! No wonder you were so excited to see him. I never thought he would be a Tier 4 Sword Emperor. With that kind of strength, he can definitely rank within the top five...or maybe even top three in our city,” the female Oracle named Cooling Cloud exclaimed as she looked at Shi Feng. She, too, had not expected Yu Luo’s acquaintance to be so powerful.

A Tier 4 player!

This was a goal players like herself struggled toward desperately. Unfortunately, the Tier 4 Promotion Quest was simply too challenging. Her one attempt had failed.

In the Main City she resided in, there were only three known Tier 4 players. Every one of them was a bigshot in the city. They were existences far beyond Tier 3 players like herself.

However, at this moment, let alone Cooling Cloud, even Yu Luo, who was familiar with Shi Feng, was wide-eyed in shock and incredulity.

Tier 4!

She had improved a lot after arriving in this world. However, Tier 4 remained a huge threshold to cross. Unless she could take one step further in her combat standard, she would be doomed to hover forever in the ranks of Tier 3.

However, despite being at Level 127, Shi Feng had already become a Tier 4 Sword Emperor. Moreover, he had accomplished this feat even before entering this unbelievable world.

Meanwhile, as the humans were goggling at Shi Feng in shock, the Great Demon Nemen Carlo gazed at Shi Feng with a solemn expression, as if he was looking at a monster. “Who are you?” Nemen Carlo asked, a hint of fear appearing in his eyes. “A heaven-blessed individual can’t possibly wield such power!”

After Shi Feng unleashed his aura, let alone the Demon Leaders present, even a Demon Marquis like himself felt suppressed. In fact, even the Mana flowing inside his body was significantly slower. Now, he could exhibit only 60% of his normal combat power, at most.

Generally, suppressing a Tier 4 existence’s strength by even 10% was already a difficult feat, what more 40%. Yet, Shi Feng had done

it.

“That’s none of your business.” Shi Feng paid no heed to the Great Demon’s question. Instead, he smiled and said, “I will give you two options now. The first is for us to continue fighting and determine the victor through life and death. The second option is for you to get out of my sight, together with your people.” As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, a deathly silence fell over the battlefield. Yu Luo and the other players, in particular, gaped, their wide-open mouths forming an O.

“Is he crazy?”

“Even if he’s a Sword Emperor, Nemen Carlo won’t spare him after being threatened in such a way!”

“It’s over! That Nemen Carlo will definitely go all-out against us!”

Demons had always been arrogant in God’s Domain. They did not place other creatures in their eyes at all, even when dealing with the Dragon race. Needless to say, the arrogance of a Demon Marquis was even greater.

Even their commander, Angelica Teresa, would not dare utter such words to Nemen Carlo.

After all, Nemen Carlo was truly powerful. His strength was outstanding even among Tier 4 Demons. He had the potential to become a Demon Prince. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have become the commander of a Demon army.

Sure enough, after the Demon Marquis heard Shi Feng’s words, Nemen Carlo’s complexion turned indescribably ugly. Simultaneously, everyone felt the ambient Mana grow violent.

However, just when everyone thought a bloody battle was about to begin...

“We’re leaving!” Nemen Carlo said, his mouth practically twisting. After giving Shi Feng one last glare, he turned around with clenched fists and instantly disappeared, leaving behind only a group of Demons exchanging stunned looks. “What?! He left?!”

“What’s going on?!”

Everyone in the human army was dumbfounded at Nemen Carlo’s departure.

After all, even with the assistance of a Tier 4 Sword Emperor like Shi Feng, their army was still in dire straits. Yet, Nemen Carlo had actually left without saying another word. He behaved nothing like a Demon at all.

Angelica Teresa, the commander of the knight legion present, couldn’t help looking at Shi Feng strangely. She never thought that Shi Feng’s words would carry such great deterrence for the Demons.

“The Great Demons here are actually so smart?” Cleansing Whistle was also surprised when she saw Nemen Carlo leaving.

She knew that Shi Feng possessed the Bible of Darkness, which could be used not only to summon Demons but also to suppress hostile Demons. This was why Shi Feng could push back those Demon Leaders so easily.

However, of those present, only Shi Feng knew what exactly had happened.

The Bible of Darkness held absolute control over Demons. Although Nemen Carlo did not know Shi Feng held the Bible of Darkness, the Great Demon still possessed an instinctive fear and dread of it. Moreover, Shi Feng had repelled over a dozen Demon Leaders with a single move. This aggravated the fear in Nemen Carlo.

Demons were very smart creatures. After the first major update took place, Demons would almost never fight battles that they were not confident of winning. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even if Nemen Carlo were significantly stronger than Shi Feng right now, the fear and dread he felt for the Bible of Darkness would deter him from casually starting a fight.

After the Demons left the battlefield, the surviving humans all breathed out a sigh of relief. They then began reorganizing their formation and treating the injured. A large number of people also gathered by Angelica Teresa’s side with downcast and unreconciled expressions.

This was because the female knight’s mental state and soul had already reached the brink of collapse, despite her having a lot of HP remaining. This was clear even to the Tier 3 individuals present. “Commander!”

“It’s all our fault! If we weren’t so useless, the Commander wouldn’t have had to use the Aria of Holy Blood!”

“Dammit! Someone in the city must’ve leaked information on our operation! Otherwise, Nemen Carlo couldn’t have led an army to surround us!”

Both NPCs and players present expressed sadness when they saw Angelica’s current state. It was evident the female knight was loved and respected by these people.

Unlike players, it was incredibly difficult for NPCs to get resurrected.

“Big Sis Cloud, what should we do now? The Commander won’t last at this rate!” Yu Luo said while frantically casting Healing Spells on Angelica. However, Healing Spells worked on only physical injuries. They had no effect on damage to one’s mental state and soul.

Commander Angelica Teresa was the only hope for their Main City’s survival. In this world, both NPCs and players had difficulty surviving because this world was several times crueler than the modern God’s Domain.

It was also because of Angelica that Yu Luo had managed to live well until this day. Yet, now...

“There’s nothing we can do. The Aria of Holy Blood’s backlash is too powerful. The fact that the Commander managed to cast it once is already plenty amazing. Yet, after using the Spell, she even used a Taboo Skill that placed a huge burden on the mental state. Now, even a Tier 4 Great Divine Official can’t save her,” Cooling Cloud said as she shook her head, a gloomy expression appearing on her face.

While the two Tier 3 healers, Yu Luo and Cooling Cloud, were doing everything they could to save Angelica Teresa, Shi Feng, who watched all of this from a distance, was filled with an indescribable sense of shock and surprise.

“She’s actually Angelica Teresa?” Shi Feng couldn’t help doubting his eyes for a moment as he gazed at the frail female knight.

“What’s the matter, Commander?” Solitary Nine asked curiously when he noticed Shi Feng’s surprise.

In Solitary Nine’s opinion, there shouldn’t be anything in God’s Domain capable of surprising Shi Feng. Yet, now, the man actually evinced surprise because of an NPC. This was a truly strange situation.

“Have you never visited a library to read about God’s Domain’s history during your free time?” Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Solitary Nine. “She is the Angelica Teresa. She holds the title of Valkyrie and is one of the two Founding Elders of the Fire Dragon Empire!”

“She’s a founding member of one of the four ancient countries?” Solitary Nine did a double-take at Angelica Teresa when he heard Shi Feng’s words.

The four ancient countries of the modern God’s Domain were the only four human empires that had existed since the ancient era. According to legend, the founding emperors of these empires possessed incredible power. In the case of the Fire Dragon Empire, though, a large part of the reason it survived the ancient era was the contributions of its two Founding Elders, and even Gods feared these two Founding Elders.

“However, by the looks of it, she seems to be dying,” Lifeless Thorn said in a quiet tone. “Maybe she just has the same name?” “No, she is definitely that person,” Shi Feng affirmed. “The Sacred Sword Blood Moon is ranked sixth among God’s Domain’s Famed Swords. It is said that this sword once belonged to Angelica Teresa, one of the Fire Dragon Empire’s Founding Elders. While a person can have the same name, the chances are low that she would wield the same weapon.”

God’s Domain’s 36 Famed Swords were unique existences, and their owners were all historical figures in God’s Domain. In other words, it was precisely because of the people wielding these swords that the swords became unique existences known throughout God’s Domain.

“What should we do now, then? If she dies, will it alter God’s Domain’s history?” Solitary Nine asked anxiously. At this point, he still couldn’t tell whether they had arrived in the real ancient era of God’s Domain or just a replica. If it was a fake, then good. If it was real, then the results would be very bad.

No sooner had Solitary Nine finished speaking than the system’s cold, mechanical voice entered Shi Feng’s ears.
