Chapter 3888 - 962 - Ominous Cavalry

Shadowring Town, Zero Wing’s Residence:

As the light around Shi Feng faded, he found himself back in the courtyard of Zero Wing’s Residence in Shadowring Town.

I’ve only been gone for about a week. How did the Guild get so many more fifth-floor experts?

As Shi Feng scanned his surroundings, he found that the number of Guild members loitering in the courtyard was several times more than before he had left. He even spotted close to a hundred Level 225-plus fifth-floor experts. This was a number that would have been impossible a week ago.

Generally, when it came to Guilds that commanded fifth-floor experts, less than 5% of their fifth-floor experts would be present at their main headquarters at any time. Sometimes, that number might not even reach 1%.

Although Zero Wing was active in only Shadowring Town, Luminous Sky City, and the Crystal City of Secrets, no more than 10% of its fifth-floor experts should be in its Guild Residence in Shadowring Town at any given moment.

Yet, there were nearly 100 fifth-floor experts in the Residence’s courtyard. If he included the fifth-floor experts inside the Guild Hall, the total would exceed 150. In other words, Zero Wing currently had over 1,500 fifth-floor experts under its command. Some pseudo-apex powers might not even have this many fifth-floor experts.

Amidst Shi Feng’s bewilderment, a loud explosion suddenly came from a distant location, causing the Zero Wing members in the Residence to tense up. A moment later, the fifth-floor experts in the courtyard summoned their Flying Mounts and rushed to the source of the explosion.

Seeing this, Shi Feng promptly chased after a familiar figure.

“Guild Leader, you’re back!” Blue Phoenix, who had advanced to Tier 6 and risen to Level 227, exclaimed joyfully when she saw Shi Feng catching up to her.

“Mhm.” Shi Feng nodded. Then, he asked curiously, “What’s the situation here?”

“The Holy Race’s Ominous Cavalry is attacking us. The explosion just now was a rescue signal sent by one of our three Guilds’ resurrection camps in the inner area,” Blue Phoenix explained.

“The Ominous Cavalry?” Blue Phoenix’s answer surprised Shi Feng. “Isn’t that one of the Holy Race’s adventurer teams? What gives them the courage to attack our resurrection camp?”

In his previous life, the Ominous Cavalry was famous in the Eternal Realm. It was an adventurer team founded in the Eternal Realm, though it had initially operated under a different name. The adventurer team changed its name because all its members had become Holy Seal Cavaliers, a Mythical Era Class that had become available to Holy Race players following Holy Ring City’s opening.

The Holy Seal Cavalier Class was very special. It allowed players to merge with their Mounts—for a potential gain of up to 100% of their Mounts’ Basic Attributes. Thus, the stronger a Holy Seal Cavalier’s Mount, the stronger they would become. The only problem with the class was the complexity of the merging process. The stronger the Mount, the lower the merging success rate. Even fifth-floor experts could only merge with Tier 6 Extraordinary Flying Mounts at best; Tier 6 Legendary Flying Mounts were completely out of their reach. Even so, the Holy Seal Cavalier Class was still very powerful.

It was also because of this class that, despite being an adventurer team with only several thousand members at its peak, the Ominous Cavalry produced several sixth-floor experts and made a name for itself in the Eternal Realm. At one point, even Demon’s Gate had suffered a huge loss at the hands of the Ominous Cavalry.

Presently, Holy Ring City only became accessible not long ago. Logically, with the Ominous Cavalry’s limited numbers, even if the adventurer team sought to target human players, it should only engage human players in field PvP. It was unwise for it to target fortified locations defended by many experts.

“We don’t know why they are doing this, either. The Ominous Cavalry has already attacked several of our resurrection camps,” Blue Phoenix said angrily. “Although the Ominous Cavalry’s members are few in number, they are fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifacts and have high combat standards. Additionally, they always retreat with uninterruptible teleportation tools after dealing some damage, giving our armies no chance to encircle them. Big Sis Rain and the others are also busy grinding for levels in the Flame Dragon God’s Nest, so we don’t have many capable experts to defend our resurrection camps. Zero Wing has suffered several thousand casualties in the past three days because of the Ominous Cavalry.”

“In that case, let’s hurry over there,” Shi Feng said, summoning the Frostflame Sacred Dragon. “I don’t know where the resurrection camp is, so you lead the way.”

“Understood!” Blue Phoenix grew joyful when she heard that Shi Feng would join the battle. Immediately, she got on the Frostflame Sacred Dragon and directed it toward a resurrection camp in the World Ark’s inner area.

…

As an Advanced Divine-ranked Flying Mount, the Tier 6 Frostflame Sacred Dragon was much faster than Blue Phoenix’s Tier 5 Flying Mount. Originally, Blue Phoenix needed over a dozen minutes to reach the besieged resurrection camp. However, thanks to the Frostflame Sacred Dragon, she arrived within 5,000 yards of the resurrection camp in less than three minutes.

As the Frostflame Sacred Dragon hovered 5,000 yards above the resurrection camp, Shi Feng and Blue Phoenix could see a chaotic battle below them. Of the two sides fighting in the battle, one was an army with over 3,000 Level 225-plus human players assisted by magic barriers, while the other was a team of less than 30 Level 227-plus Holy Race players.

The Holy Race players were fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifacts and rode on Tier 6 Flying Mounts. Despite the camp’s barriers suppressing these Holy Race players, not even the Level 235-plus elite experts of the Red Dragon Nation and Azure Fang could stop them from slaughtering the members of the Red Dragon Nation, Azure Fang, and Zero Wing.

In only three seconds, over a dozen Level 225-plus fifth-floor experts were killed.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The leader of the Ominous Cavalry’s forces was a Level 230 four-armed young man with a savage appearance. As he finished off a Level 235 elite expert from the Red Dragon Nation, a space-time passage suddenly appeared a short distance away. Then, a charming, fairy-like woman wearing a silvery-gray robe and holding an ancient wooden staff emerged from the space-time passage and silenced the battlefield.

This woman was none other than Frey, whom Shi Feng had met not long ago in the Greater World’s Desolate Star City. She had reached Level 231 and was equipped with as many as four Divine Artifacts. The rest of her equipment also consisted of Fragmented Divine Artifacts, and the aura she exuded was not much weaker than that of Daystar during Everlasting City’s competition.
