Chapter 607 – Dark Moon

Join the fight?

Luo Tianhao fixated his gaze on Shi Feng when he heard the other party’s words, a hint of solemnity adding to his expression. Likewise, the other members of the Skystar battle team also couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng, wondering if they had misheard him.

If it was before they had fought Fire Dance, they wouldn’t have cared whether Shi Feng had the rest of Zero Wing’s battle group join the fight. On the contrary, they would have encouraged it, as that would let them save time and end the fight much more quickly.

However, after witnessing Fire Dance’s terrifying display of strength, they no longer dared to underestimate the four other members of Zero Wing’s battle group.

Not to mention, Shi Feng, the leader of Zero Wing’s battle group, should have seen the effects of their Combination Berserk Skill and already gained a good idea of their combat capabilities. He should know that their fight wasn’t one that ordinary Tier 5 players could interfere in. At the very least, one must be at the standard of genuine Tier 6 players to avoid getting killed instantly.

If Shi Feng understood this and still chose to have the rest of his battle group members join the fight, it meant that the other three women in the battle group were likely to be just as strong as Fire Dance.

“Finally!” Hidden Soul exclaimed as she stretched her back. Then, she lazily said, “I thought my chance would never come. Let’s fight together, then.”

Standing beside Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow and Jun Luosha nodded. Then, the three of them began walking toward Luo Tianhao and the others, each step they took adding to the shock Luo Tianhao and the others experienced.

Mana!

Although the three women did not release any of their auras, the closer they got, the denser the mana surrounding Luo Tianhao and the others became. Even though they had just drained their surroundings of mana, the ambient mana that currently surrounded them was even denser than when Fire Dance initially released her mana.

How is this possible?!

Luo Tianhao felt as if the end of the world had arrived as he looked at Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and Jun Luosha.

Dealing with Fire Dance alone had already given him a massive headache.

Not only was Fire Dance a fifth-floor expert with Basic Attributes at the Legendary standard, but she even possessed mana close to rivaling that of Tier 6 Gods. She was such a monstrous existence that should she get promoted to Tier 6, she would instantly become an existence capable of upsetting the Starlight Realm’s balance.

Meanwhile, in the current battle, even though he and his teammates had already activated their Combination Berserk Skill, they would most certainly need to trade damage for damage and sacrifice a few players to kill her. Moreover, they would need to do so before their Combination Berserk Skill’s duration ran out. Otherwise, only death would await them.

However, before they could even defeat Fire Dance, they were now being told that Zero Wing had three more monsters of Fire Dance’s caliber?

Before Luo Tianhao could recover from his stupor, Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and Jun Luosha had already joined the battle.

After joining the battlefield, the three women did not bother with any fancy combat techniques. Instead, they merely fought using their Tier 5 Skills.

Tier 5 Skill, Splitting Shadows!

Tier 5 Skill, Blade Storm! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Tier 5 Skill, Sword Resonance!

Suddenly, over a dozen doppelgangers of Hidden Soul appeared on the battlefield, each doppelganger carrying 150% of Hidden Soul’s Basic Attributes. Enhanced by her God-ranked Mana, her doppelgangers could easily repulse Skystar’s tanks with their every attack. As for the rest of Skystar’s members, they had no choice but to abandon their offensive against Fire Dance and focus solely on defense, lest they wish to get killed by Hidden Soul in a couple of moves.

Immediately after Hidden Soul had single-handedly suppressed the entirety of the Skystar battle group, Gentle Snow and Jun Luosha followed up with a combination attack targeted toward Skystar’s lone Oracle. Gentle Snow’s AOE attack forced the Oracles to desperately erect defensive barriers on his teammates, while Jun Luosha used the opportunity to instantly end the Oracles’ life, reducing Skystar’s healers by one.

“Dammit!” When Luo Tianhao saw his Oracle getting killed, he knew that the fight was as good as over. Hence, he promptly turned toward the fifteen cities’ experts and shouted, “Deploy the Star Cluster Barrier!”

With his battle group’s strength, the best they could do was deal with Fire Dance alone. If they wished to defeat Zero Wing’s four members, they must rely on the Star Cluster Barrier.

The Star Cluster Barrier was among the most commonly seen large-scale great grandmaster magic barriers in the Greater God’s Domain. It required 1,000 Grandmaster Magicians to construct, and it could suppress the Basic Attributes, Physique, and Mana of even Tier 6 Gods by a minimum of 30%.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that this battle would be as good as over once the Star Cluster Barrier was deployed. It was also why he detested the idea of utilizing it previously.

Meanwhile, upon hearing Luo Tianhao’s command, the fifteen cities’ participants, who had been anxiously waiting for their turn all this time, promptly executed their orders and completed the Star Cluster Barrier.

…

“Sure enough, the disparity in numbers is simply too much for just a handful of powerhouses to manage.”

When Mu Huangwu saw the countless stars and magic arrays appearing across Star Lake City’s sky, he couldn’t help but sigh.

Previously, Red Frost had only managed to win the Tier 6 match because of the fifteen cities’ conceited attitude. She had wisely taken advantage of this fact to quickly eliminate the fifteen city legions one after another before they could group up and become a significant threat.

Unfortunately, Zero Wing’s battle group didn’t have such a luxury in the Tier 5 match.

Under the effects of the Star Cluster Barrier, even mighty Tier 6 Gods would be at great risk of death. It was just that Tier 6 Gods would normally never let players have any opportunities to catch them in a Star Cluster Barrier out in the fields. But in a city battle, constructing a Star Cluster Barrier over a handful of players was a piece of cake.

…

Meanwhile, after the completion of the Star Cluster Barrier, Fire Dance, Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and Jun Luosha were immediately subjected to a powerful suppression. Their mana was quickly weakened to the standard of ordinary Tier 6 players, while their Basic Attributes declined to the Fragmented Legendary standard. Now, they were merely a shadow of their former selves.

When Luo Tianhao and his teammates sensed the effects of the Star Cluster Barrier, they couldn’t help but sigh in relief. They had very nearly sullied their reputation as one of Skystar City’s ace battle groups in Star Lake City, a measly third-tier city.

The Star Cluster Barrier, is it? As it so happens, I have a move called Dark Moon!

As soon as Luo Tianhao and his teammates breathed a sigh of relief, Shi Feng, who had been standing by idly all this time, suddenly unsheathed the Shadow Incinerator hanging by his waist and executed a horizontal cut at the sky.

Dark Moon Mana Technique, Sword of Space!

Dark Moon was a Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique that placed stringent requirements on the user’s Concentration and Mana. Previously, Shi Feng could only barely execute the Mana Technique, even after utilizing all of his power-up abilities. But after he grasped the Advanced Bronze Mana Purification Technique and elevated the strength of his mana to the standard of Tier 6 Gods, he could finally execute Dark Moon without relying on any Skills, albeit just barely.

Meanwhile, the moment Shi Feng swung the Shadow Incinerator, darkness enveloped the entirety of Star Lake City.

However, this darkness lasted only for a brief moment before disappearing. Immediately afterward, the sky began to split into pieces and fall to the ground like falling snow. Then, what followed was the sound of the Star Cluster Barrier shattering…

…

TL Notes:

[1]Basic Attributes at the Legendary standard:

This expression refers to “players with Basic Attributes rivaling players fully equipped with Legendary items.” I personally find it incredibly awkward to write this lengthy segment, so “Basic Attributes at the Legendary standard” is the alternative I decided to go with.
