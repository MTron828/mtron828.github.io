Chapter 2781 – Times Have Changed

Fifty thousand contribution points? Tenth place?

When Zhuo Linqiu heard the Green God Company’s staff’s words, he was dumbfounded.

In fact, even Han Yifeng, who possessed an apathetic personality, felt a little dazed at the staff member’s words.

After all, Shi Feng was initially only a pawn in their eyes. Yet, not only did he climb up to the same playing field they fought on, but he was now even actively competing with them.

“No wonder he didn’t put us in his eyes.” Realization dawned upon Zhuo Linqiu as he looked at Shi Feng. However, a moment later, a hint of mockery appeared on his face as he said, “It’s a pity he doesn’t know that the contribution competition participants are just warming up and that the current rankings are only temporary.”

The Upper Zone’s contribution competition had been going on for many years now, and everyone mostly understood how it worked. Those intent on participating in a particular season’s competition generally wouldn’t reveal their cards in the first two months of the season.

This was because contribution points were basically trump cards for participants. Naturally, it would be best if participants hid their cards as deeply as possible and only revealed them at the last possible moment. Only then could these trump cards play a vital role.

Moreover, there was an added benefit to accumulating contribution points in secret: deciding whether one would continue participating in a particular season’s contribution competition or not. After all, aside from time-based assignments, other forms of contributions could be reserved for future competitions if necessary.

Since the contribution competition had been running for many years now, some participants had been accumulating contribution points for a long time. These participants were waiting for the fateful day when they would reveal all their cards, instantly securing one of the top three positions, and gain access to the middle layer.

Meanwhile, the current contribution competition was less than a month along. Hence, the various participants were still testing the waters and had yet to seriously invest their contribution points. The majority of their current points were from completing time-based assignments the Green God Company issued, not from long-term assignments that could be turned in at any time.

“Although I don’t know why he made such a move, this is a good opportunity for us,” Han Yifeng said, shaking his head as he regained his calm. “Old Zhuo, go talk to him and tell him I’ll buy the remaining points he has kept hidden at double the price.” “Double the price?” Zhuo Linqiu looked at Han Yifeng in surprise. “Young Master, historically, purchasing points at 1.5 times their original value is already pretty high. After all, there is no way these people can secure one of the top three rankings. There’s no meaning for them to hold on to their points. If other people were to find out that you’re offering to purchase his hidden points at double the price, they’d most likely raise their own prices, as well.”

There were many instances where multiple participants joined hands to compete in the contribution competition. After all, unlike contribution points gained through completing assignments, points gained through other sources could be freely traded in secret.

When a competition was about to end, participants who were close to the top three positions would often purchase the hidden points of other participants. Naturally, as Han Yifeng was aiming for one of the top three positions this time, he would also participate in this practice.

The exchange rate would be based on the prices of the items sold by the Green God Company.

“Just do as I say. The Green God Company announced that the top 20 participants would receive a reward, so many people are trying to compete for the top 20 positions. It is only natural for the price of contribution points this time to be higher,” Han Yifeng said, shaking his head. According to the information he had obtained, the Green God Company intended to further squeeze the various corporations for their wealth. To do so, the company had intensified the competition by allowing the top 20 participants to exchange for a limited number of items exclusive to the middle layer.

Once this information spread, the price of contribution points would definitely increase.

However, while a price hike was inevitable, the increase wouldn’t be exaggerated, either. After all, there were only so many items the top 20 participants could exchange using contribution points. Beyond that purchase limit, whatever contribution points they had remaining would become useless. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I understand.” Zhuo Linqiu nodded and walked toward Shi Feng.

On the other side, Shi Feng was currently ecstatic.

Just a second ago, he had still been a poor bastard in the Upper Zone. Now, however, he had 5,000,000 trade points to his nameenough to purchase five ordinary housing units in the base layer. Of course, these points were still insufficient to purchase a large villa in the base layer. However, they were definitely more than adequate for his daily expenditure. At the very least, even after welcoming Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose into the Upper Zone, he wouldn’t have to worry about their necessities.

However, it’s going to be difficult to get another large influx of points. It seems I’ll have to think of a long-term way to secure Seven Luminaries Crystals in bulk, Shi Feng thought with a sigh.

Five thousand units of Seven Luminaries Crystal was a significant amount, yet it was only enough to get him 5,000,000 trade points and 50,000 contribution points. With just this many trade points and contribution points, let alone catching up with the top three rankers of the competition, he probably couldn’t afford anything from the middle layer.

However, for his present self, obtaining more Seven Luminaries Crystals wasn’t much of a challenge. After all, he was currently in the ancient God’s Domain. The resources available in the ancient era were far more abundant than in the modern era.

After verifying on his quantum watch that he had received the 5,000,000 trade points and 50,000 contribution points, Shi Feng planned to head for the Upper Zone’s entrance to receive Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose. After all, this was the first time they were visiting the Upper Zone. Without anyone to guide them, it was very easy for problems to occur.

There were many taboos in the Upper Zone. If they accidentally violated one of these taboos, there was a high chance they would be banished from the Upper Zone permanently.

However, before Shi Feng could leave the exchange counter, Zhuo Linqiu appeared beside him.

“Guild Leader Shi, we meet again.” Although Zhuo Linqiu felt displeased at Shi Feng’s earlier attitude, as Han Yifeng’s butler, he still greeted Shi Feng politely. “Master Zhuo, do you have business with me?” Shi Feng asked calmly as he looked at Zhuo Linqiu. Inwardly, though, Shi Feng was a little surprised by this situation. Although he had expected Han Yifeng to seek him out sooner or later, he never thought that the man would act so quickly.

Kerui had informed him about the ins and outs of the contribution competition, so he knew that those competing for the top three spots would secretly purchase contribution points from other participants. Now that he had just exchanged for 50,000 contribution points in one fell swoop, those seeking the top three spots couldn’t ignore his existence.

“Indeed, I do. Moreover, this is great news for you, Guild Leader Shi,” Zhuo Linqiu said with a faint smile. “I believe you know about the matters regarding the contribution competition already, so I’ll get straight to the point. Young Master Han wishes to purchase the contribution points you have yet to turn in. Moreover, Young Master Han is willing to purchase them at double their market value. May I know what you think of this, Guild Leader Shi?”
