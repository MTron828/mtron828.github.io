Chapter 2745 – Different World

“The rewards are so excellent?”

Shi Feng was stunned momentarily by the rewards Xia Qingying mentioned. He couldn’t believe that just by clearing the Mental Path above the age of 20, he would get 50 times the reward of everyone else.

“They’re not particularly excellent. However, they’re the best rewards I can give you within my authority. If you were one of the Green God Company’s internal members, you would receive a much more generous reward. In fact, your authority level would even be elevated to the Advanced Grade directly,” Xia Qingying said. She then smiled and asked, “May I know if you are interested in joining our company?”

“Thank you for your offer, General Manager Xia, but I am used to operating freely by

really don’t wish to be restrained.” Joining the Green God Company might be the dream of many people, but he knew that the Green God Company had many restrictions. This was also the reason Muxin and Kerui did not join the company but retained their connection with the Boulder Corporation instead.

“What a pity,” Xia Qingying sighed when she heard Shi Feng’s answer.

If a talent like Shi Feng joined the Green God Company, he would have climbed to a position not lower than hers in the Upper Zone. After all, mental strength masters were incredibly valuable to the Upper Zone.

The Green God Company paid astronomical prices to cultivate mental strength masters. However, even now, the company hadn’t managed to cultivate many.

“Shi Feng, this is a good opportunity for you. If you get 50 bottles of Phantom Potions, which is of equivalent value to Life Potions, you might be able to elevate your mental strength to the next level,” Kerui said, her eyes glowing with excitement when she heard Xia Qingying’s offer.

Although Life Potion was something that could be exchanged and each bottle cost only 5,000 points, there was a limit on the number of bottles a person could exchange. People without authority could exchange for only one bottle per year, while Grade 3 authority could exchange for two bottles per year, and Grade 2 authority for five bottles per year. If one wanted to purchase more, they would have to buy them at a much more exorbitant price from other people.

Meanwhile, the Phantom Potion was an incredibly magical drug the Green God Company developed that could sharpen and improve one’s mental strength. Anyone with ambition in the Upper Zone would try to exchange for it.

Fifty bottles of Phantom Potions!

She had never even seen so many Phantom Potions in her life before.

With that many Phantom Potions, she could definitely achieve a breakthrough within a year and elevate her authority to Grade 2.

“General Manager Xia, does the Green God Company have any medicine that can heal mental damage?” Shi Feng asked as he looked at Xia Qingying.

Currently, Life Water was definitely out of his reach. Hence, he could only seek inferior alternatives to stabilize Gentle Snow’s and Aqua Rose’s mental states temporarily for now.

“We do, but these medicines are much more valuable than Life Potion,” Xia Qingying answered as she looked at Shi Feng strangely. She couldn’t understand why Shi Feng would want something like this. However, she still explained, “Out of all the injuries out there, mental trauma is the most difficult to treat. If you wish to purchase such medicine, you can only do so after entering the middle layer. However, you are not qualified to enter the middle layer yet.” “I can buy them only in the middle layer?” Shi Feng frowned. He then said, “General Manager Xia, I’ve decided. I will take the ordinary house.”

When Hong Xinyuan heard Shi Feng’s decision, he couldn’t help looking at the young man in surprise. Hurriedly, he dissuaded Shi Feng, “You’re crazy! It’s not easy to get 50 bottles of Phantom Potion! Even with your Grade 1 authority, you’d need five years to redeem that many! The Green God Company has a completely different evaluation for those who reach Advanced Grade authority before and after the age of 25!”

Before the age of 25, humans would still be in their growth stage. Reaching the Advanced Grade authority before 25 meant they still had potential for growth. The Green God Company would prioritize nurturing such talents even if these talents were outsiders. An example of this would be how Xia Qingying was showing so much care for Shi Feng right now. However, if Shi Feng was already over 25 years old by the time he reached the Advanced Grade authority, the Green God Company’s evaluation of him would plummet.

Before Hong Xinyuan could continue trying to dissuade Shi Feng, Xia Qingying suddenly extended a hand to stop the older man. She then looked at Shi Feng with a strange gaze.

“It seems you are adamant on restoring mental trauma. You actually gave up the possibility to improve yourself rapidly within a short period and settled for a house that can just barely maintain and heal a person’s mental state,” Xia Qingying said, seemingly having seen through Shi Feng’s intentions. She then smiled lightly and continued, “Okay, since this is your decision, I won’t meddle with it. However, I should still give you a reminder.

“The Upper Zone isn’t as simple as you think it is. Life here is not easy. If you wish to help someone, the fastest way to do so would be to raise your own authority. Anything else is just futile effort.”

“I understand. Thank you for the reminder, General Manager Xia,” Shi Feng replied gratefully. “Also, I wish to participate in the contribution competition. Can I register for it now?”

An individual of Xia Qingying’s status probably wouldn’t pay people like himself a second glance under normal circumstances. She had gone out of her way to help him this time only because she admired the excellent potential he had shown.

However, Shi Feng understood himself very clearly. In reality, he was still far from the standard of a mental strength master. Even with the Phantom Potion’s help, he could, at best, elevate his mental strength to the Special Grade. In his situation, such an achievement would be of no help whatsoever. Rather than doing something meaningless, he would rather stabilize Gentle Snow’s and Aqua Rose’s conditions by relying on the Upper Zone’s environment. After all, from what he heard from Kerui, people who entered the Upper Zone without gaining any authority would have to struggle to survive in the Upper Zone unless someone provided them with accommodation.

However, obtaining a residence in the Upper Zone was easier said than done. Even an ordinary housing unit cost one million trade points.

One million trade points! That was equivalent to ten billion Credits in the outside world. Moreover, even if he had that kind of money, it would still take him a very long time to exchange for one million trade points. Most importantly, every housing unit had a limited occupancy. An ordinary housing unit could accommodate five people at most, whereas the independent villas could have up to 20.

For the various major corporations, let alone 20 slots, even 100 slots wouldn’t be enough. After all, who didn’t have close friends? Who didn’t have sons and daughters? Who wouldn’t wish to live in the Upper Zone forever? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hence, he would be dreaming if he thought he could borrow other people’s houses! It might be fine if he were alone, but if he wanted to help other people, he would need an ordinary housing unit of his own.

“The contribution competition? It seems you’re more extraordinary than I thought. In that case, I have nothing more to say,” Xia Qingying said, nodding. She then transferred a message from her quantum watch to Shi Feng’s and said, “This housing unit in the Sixth Southern District will be yours from now on.”

Shi Feng was overjoyed when he saw the information displayed on his quantum watch. Although it was called an ordinary house, its floor area was still more than 200 square meters-definitely enough for five people to live comfortably.

“I have registered you for the contribution competition. However, I’m afraid the likelihood of you catching up with the other participants is low, especially if you are aiming for the top three. Every one of the top three participants has more than 100,000 points already. I heard they have the backing of God’s Domain’s Super Guilds. It’s impossible for you to catch up to them now,” Xia Qingying said as she looked at Shi Feng. “However, you can try competing for the top 20 positions. Our company plans to offer the top 20 winners the right to purchase three items from the middle layer. You can give it a try at that time.”

Shi Feng was slightly surprised by Xia Qingying’s words. Hurriedly, he thanked her, “Thank you, General Manager Xia.”

Afterward, Xia Qingying spoke a few words with Hong Xinyuan before departing the building. From her haste, it was evident she was truly busy. Meanwhile, Kerui was greatly angered and frustrated by Shi Feng’s decision. She never thought that Shi Feng would give up on such an excellent opportunity to improve himself. Even Hong Xinyuan shook his head over Shi Feng’s decision. After instructing Kerui to guide Shi Feng, he also gave Shi Feng a few reminders.

However, unlike Kerui and Hong Xinyuan, Shi Feng felt very happy with his current situation.

This was because he had reaped a massive harvest from his visit to the Upper Zone this time. He had also finally understood the importance of Seven Luminaries Crystals and found a way to heal Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose. He had even found a way to help outsiders into the Upper Zone.

Once his authority reached the Advanced Grade and he entered the Upper Zone’s middle layer, he could spend 100,000 contribution points to exchange for one Upper Zone reserve slot. While he could exchange for only three slots per year with this method, this was still good news for him. After all, his goal wasn’t simply to live in the Upper Zone by himself.

As the sun set, Kerui brought Shi Feng to his residence in the Sixth Southern District and left without saying a word, evidently unhappy with Shi Feng’s decision. This left Shi Feng standing alone in front of the residential building’s entrance.

Isn’t this house a little too amazing?!

Shi Feng was stunned when he entered Unit 02 on the 35th floor.

Not only was the housing unit fully equipped with smart facilities, but it even boasted a comprehensive array of exercise equipment. After entering the house, Shi Feng also felt much more comfortable than before, as if his whole body was soaked in a Nutrient Solution, and he could continuously improve his physical fitness even without doing any training. His brain also felt clearer than ever, like when he was in a Mana-rich environment in God’s Domain.

Moreover, every bedroom in the house was equipped with a state-of-the-art Fearless Virtual Gaming Cabin, something even more amazing than the virtual gaming cabins Zero Wing had purchased.

According to Shi Feng’s memories, the Fearless Virtual Gaming Cabin was a model that would appear in the outside world only three years later.

The Fearless Cabin did not just allow players to fully immerse themselves in God’s Domain. It also improved the player’s sensitivity. In particular, the cabin improved Mana sensitivity by at least 20% and allowed players to exhibit 100% of their mental strength in God’s Domain.

Back when the Fearless Cabins were first released to the public, the various corporations had fought over them frantically. Each unit had sold for at least 100 million Credits. Moreover, the Fearless Cabins were always in short supply. Even ten years after God’s Domain’s launch, first-rate Guilds could only afford to supply their executives with Fearless Cabins.

The situation of second-rate Guilds had been even worse. Even a Guild Leader like Shi Feng did not get to use a Fearless Cabin.

I never dreamed I would have the opportunity to experience the Fearless Cabin in this life. Shi Feng was deeply moved by this situation. At this moment, he finally understood why people who entered the Upper Zone would be unwilling to leave it. The various environmental benefits aside, just the technology one could enjoy here was leaps and bounds ahead of the outside world’s technology.

A 20% increase to Mana sensitivity!

Even ordinary Tier 3 experts would experience a huge boost in combat power if they received such an improvement, what more peak experts and apex experts? The increase in Mana sensitivity would also help players tackle their future promotions. After all, Mana was the foundation of everything in God’s Domain. The more one understood about the operation and control of Mana, the stronger one would become.

It seems I should have Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose come over as soon as possible. These Fearless Cabins alone could increase their chances of reaching Tier 4 by at least 10%. As Shi Feng looked at the pitch-black gaming cabin that was the size of a double bed, many thoughts and plans ran through his mind.

After he gained a rough understanding of the house’s functionality, he hopped into his Fearless Cabin without hesitation, intending to experience the effects of this legendary gaming cabin properly. Not to mention, it wouldn’t be easy for him to return to Zero Wing’s headquarters at this time.

Once the cabin linked with God’s Domain’s Main God System, Shi Feng muttered in his heart, Log in!
