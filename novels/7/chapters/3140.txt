Chapter 215 – This Is Only the Beginning

“This… Impossible!”

“Why are there so many peerless geniuses?”

“Did the Five Great Super Guilds really join hands to target us?”

The Flower of Seven Sins’ members were in utter shock and disbelief when they saw the increasing number of youths gathering on the main street.

For veteran experts like themselves, this wasn’t the first time they had seen a force of several hundred peak experts. However, it was a different story for a force of several hundred peerless geniuses. Anyone with a certain degree of understanding about God’s Domain’s various superpowers would understand just how heavy and scary the weight of several hundred peerless geniuses was.

This was no longer a force any individual superpower was capable of mustering.

In fact, even if the Five Great Super Guilds banded together, it was highly unlikely they could form such a large team of peerless geniuses. After all, peerless geniuses were essentially the favored children of heaven. Every one of them had a great chance of reaching Tier 6 in the future. A superpower would be fortunate if it could find even one peerless genius out of ten million youths.

Yet, now, several hundred peerless geniuses were gathered on this street. It was as if every superpower in God’s Domain had decided to send their peerless geniuses to Windy Sand Town.

“Who are you people? Why are you targeting us?” Summer Wolf asked as he looked at the youths around him warily. After seeing so many peerless geniuses gathered, he no longer dared to continue attacking. “May I know what the Flower of Seven Sins has done to offend you? Could there be some sort of misunderstanding?”

When the other Flower of Seven Sins members saw Summer Wolf trying to communicate with the other side, they promptly put away the Death Curse Scroll in their hands, afraid their actions might cause unnecessary misunderstandings.

There was no way such a large number of peerless geniuses had come from a single superpower. There must be numerous superpowers behind them. Anyone who thought otherwise would be a fool.

The Flower of Seven Sins might be a transcendental power capable of exterminating even veteran Super Guilds. However, against the joint force of over a dozen superpowers or the Five Great Super Guilds, even the Flower of Seven Sins would have no choice but to lower its head.

Shortly after Summer Wolf finished speaking, the youths gathered on the main street suddenly stepped aside to open a path. Then, a cloaked man carrying a longsword by his waist slowly walked down this path and approached the Flower of Seven Sins’ members.

The Flower of Seven Sins’ members instantly grew alert when they saw this man. This was because this man was none other than Black Flame, Zero Wing’s Guild Leader.

“Misunderstanding?” Shi Feng smiled as he looked at Summer Wolf. “How interesting. Tell me, then. How, exactly, did Zero Wing misunderstand you? Is it because you killed too few of our members? Or did you make a mistake when you placed a bounty on us?”

“Zero Wing?!” Summer Wolf stared at Shi Feng in shock. “How can all of you be from Zero Wing?!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Flower of Seven Sins had thoroughly investigated Zero Wing before initiating an all-out war with the Guild. While it was true that Zero Wing had some geniuses, these were ordinary geniuses that the various superpowers couldn’t even be bothered to recruit. Aside from Black Flame, there was no other noteworthy individual in Zero Wing.

“Aside from Zero Wing, who do you think we could be?” Shi Feng asked with a raised brow. Then, waving his hand dismissively, he continued, “Go back and tell your commanders that this is only the beginning. Sooner or later, Zero Wing will claim back whatever the Flower of Seven Sins owes us!”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, the 200-plus Zero Wing and Twilight Echo members here promptly charged forward like a hungry pack of wolves.

Summer Wolf and the others might be the Flower of Seven Sins’ core members, but even Summer Wolf, the strongest out of the group, was only a Domain Realm expert. He might be able to barely survive and escape if he was only going up against six or seven peak experts. However, against a force of twenty or thirty peak experts, he didn’t even have a chance to flee for his life.

As for the Flower of Seven Sins’ Void Realm experts, they lasted no more than a few seconds when ganged up on by three or four peak experts.

This scene caused the Zero Wing members who had arrived late to sigh dejectedly. Opportunities to fight against so many peak experts were incredibly rare. Yet, the others had gobbled up this opportunity without leaving even scraps for them…

“We’ve cleaned up Windy Sand Town already. Should we head outside and hunt for the remaining Flower of Seven Sins members?” Blackie asked Shi Feng when he saw that everyone was still filled with enthusiasm. “The Flower of Seven Sins will definitely lose its mind if we wipe out all of its members in the primordial ruins.”

Now that the various superpowers were frantically exploring the Boundary Mountain Range, the importance of Mounts had increased drastically. After all, a team without Mounts had a very limited range of movement. The exploration efficiency of such a team would be significantly lower than that of a team equipped with Mounts.

The Flower of Seven Sins had expended a ton of manpower to secure an advantage in the Miniature Ancient World. If its exploration of the Boundary Mountain Range ended up being slower than the various superpowers, the corporations backing the organization would definitely start to have opinions.

Meanwhile, when the newcomers of Zero Wing and Twilight Echo heard Blackie’s question, they promptly perked up their ears and looked at Shi Feng with expectant gazes.

Their battle with Windy Sand Town’s numerous Refinement Realm experts had only allowed them to get accustomed to the Hypersensitive Potion’s effects. It hadn’t helped them improve their combat standards by much. If they wanted to improve their combat standards quickly, they needed to engage in more fights with peak experts and above.

Unfortunately, there were far too few peak experts in Windy Sand Town. There weren’t even enough for them to share.

“No, that’s just a waste of time. The primordial ruins is far too big. With so few of us here, searching for the Flower of Seven Sins’ scattered teams is no different than trying to find a needle in a haystack. They should have also received news of the battle here already, so it’ll be even more difficult to find them,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “Sort out the loot for now. Afterward, take everyone out of the town and hunt for Mounts. Once the Hypersensitivity Potion’s effects run out, withdraw from the primordial ruins immediately.”

The primordial ruins was the size of a kingdom. Trying to find the Flower of Seven Sins’ scattered teams with only a 500-man team was simply impractical. Not to mention, they would be exposing themselves to an encirclement if they did so.

If they wanted to maximize the use of the Hypersensitivity Potion, they should be engaging in fights constantly. It didn’t matter whether they fought against players or monsters. So long as they kept fighting, they could utilize their enhanced senses to discover their flaws and reduce their weak points. Of course, it would be even better if they could fight against peak experts since doing so would allow them to discover their flaws more easily.

However, the Hypersensitivity Potion’s effects only lasted for twelve hours. Rather than waste that limited time running about, it’d be much better if they spent that time fighting easily accessible monsters.

Moreover, Shi Feng had already accomplished his goal in the primordial ruins. All that was left to do was wait for the situation to ferment. After all, he wasn’t aiming to train just Zero Wing’s and Twilight Echo’s geniuses. A more important goal was establishing an unshakable foothold for Zero Wing in the Miniature Ancient World. Only then could Zero Wing enter the upper echelons of God’s Domain.

After Shi Feng issued his command, Blackie promptly left with everyone to carry it out.

Meanwhile, not long after Zero Wing’s team withdrew from Windy Sand Town, news of Windy Sand Town’s forces getting annihilated quickly spread like wildfire.
