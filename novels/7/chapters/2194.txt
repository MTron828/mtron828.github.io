Chapter 2195 – Nameless Team

“Although you are an expert Scars has invited, there are still nine other people in the team. Every one of them is an expert as well. If we give you priority in choosing the loot, it will not be fair to the other experts. Moreover, we are only working on commission. We won’t be distributing the loot we obtain,” Burning Sea explained. “Hence, our team leader has rejected your suggestion. Of course, the remuneration we are offering for your help definitely won’t disappoint you, Guild Leader Black Flame. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Our team leader knows that Zero Wing has recently recruited a lot of new people in the real world and is also being targeted by Starlink, so it should be fast-tracking a batch of experts through the Heaven’s Rumble Training Center. Our team leader is willing to pay you 30 S-rank Nutrient Fluids.”

“Thirty S-rank Nutrient Fluids?” Aqua Rose could not help being moved by Burning Sea’s words.

She was no longer an ordinary Guild Elder who was ignorant about the world. Instead, she was part of Zero Wing’s core upper echelon and knew just how valuable S-rank Nutrient Fluids were.

Originally, S-rank Nutrient Fluids were used only by fighting experts to recover quickly from a heavy injury. However, S-rank Nutrient Fluids’ utility wasn’t limited to healing injuries. If consumed after fighting an intense battle in God’s Domain, S-rank Nutrient Fluids aided in the development of one’s brain capacity by providing the necessary nutrients.

This was something Aqua Rose had personally experienced before. In fact, her consumption of S-rank Nutrient Fluids was a major factor behind the rapid improvement of her combat standards. Moreover, aside from herself, others such as Fire Dance, Violet Cloud, Cola, Shadow Sword, Alluring Summer, and Silent Blade also had similar experiences.

However, S-rank Nutrient Fluids were extremely difficult to come by even if one had the money to purchase them. After making use of both Aqua Rose’s and Gentle Snow’s connections, Zero Wing had managed to secure only an additional dozen or so bottles. Since then, the Guild had used up all its S-rank Nutrient Fluids, including the ones the White Tiger Dojo provided. As a result, the rate of improvement of Zero Wing’s core upper echelons had recently been gradually decreasing.

If Zero Wing could secure an additional 30 S-rank Nutrient Fluids, combined with the training slots Unyielding Soul provided, Aqua Rose was confident that at least she and Gentle Snow could reach the Flowing Water Realm within half a month, instantly increasing the number of Flowing Water Realm experts Zero Wing had by a large margin.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, this is the greatest sincerity we can offer. May I know what you think of this?” Frozen Gem asked.

It was not easy to find a spiritualized expert. Even experts like Burning Sea and herself had managed to reach the Spiritualization Realm just recently.

Now that she knew that Shi Feng was a spiritualized expert, she naturally wanted to rope him in. However, at the end of the day, this team of theirs was established by their team leader, who wanted to secure the item inside the Thunder God’s Secret Land no matter what, and he was unwilling to give others a share of it. This was something beyond her control.

Nevertheless, the price of 30 S-rank Nutrient Fluids could be considered extremely high. Even hiring a Super Guild’s old monster would not require such a price. However, doing so would also expose the Thunder God’s Secret Land’s existence to the various Super Guilds, something they definitely didn’t want to happen.

Of course, if Shi Feng refused to help, then they would have no choice but to seek the help of those Super Guilds’ old monsters. After all, once they secured the item inside the Thunder God’s Secret Land, they wouldn’t really care whether those Super Guilds entered the secret land or not.

“What an irresistible offer. Alright, I agree,” Shi Feng said, nodding while revealing a bitter smile.

At the same time, Shi Feng also grew curious about the team leader Burning Sea and Frozen Gem mentioned. This team leader was truly generous to be able to offer 30 S-rank Nutrient Fluids as remuneration. Moreover, this person’s information network was very powerful. Shi Feng had just resolved the problem at the Heaven’s Rumble Training Center, yet this person already knew about the troubles he faced and what he needed most right now.

As for the Guild Alchemy Workshop Design, Shi Feng had no choice but to think of another way to obtain it. Not to mention, the design didn’t have a 100% drop-rate. His request before was merely for insurance.

Afterward, Shi Feng signed a contract with Burning Sea. If the mission was a success, he would receive 30 S-rank Nutrient Fluids as payment. In the event of failure, he would still receive ten bottles.

After confirming that the contract was signed, Burning Sea took out a crystal that crackled with electricity. Golden divine runes were carved all over the crystal. The crystal itself gave off a faint trace of Divine Might.

In the next moment, Burning Sea threw the crystal to the floor. Suddenly, the space within the reception room started trembling violently. A moment later, a black hole the size of an adult male opened up inside the room.

“Here’s your entry pass. Let’s go,” Burning Sea said as he took out a token made of Magic Crystal and handed it to Shi Feng. He then took the lead and walked into the black hole.

Once Shi Feng accepted the entry pass, he followed Burning Sea into the black hole, leaving Zero Wing’s affairs to Aqua Rose and Gentle Snow to handle.

After Shi Feng entered the black hole, his vision turned black. When he could see again, he found himself in a desolate wasteland filled with electricity and flames. The wasteland was endless. From time to time, horrific lightning bolts would strike the ground, creating huge craters. Occasionally, towering pillars of fire would rise from the ground. The scenery here was the epitome of Armageddon.

Be it the lightning strikes or fire pillars, even an ordinary person could tell that, so long as they were struck by these things, they would definitely lose their lives.

At this moment, however, a large number of Demonic Creatures was actually roaming this wasteland. These Demonic Creatures were all Level 70 or above, and even the weakest among them was at the Lord rank, with many of them being Great Lords and Grand Lords. Moreover, the instant Shi Feng stepped into this wasteland, his tier was suppressed to Tier 0.

This wasteland was undoubtedly a forbidden land for players.

If an ordinary expert were to come here, they would most likely lose hope immediately. After all, if a player’s tier dropped to zero, the effectiveness of their Skills and Spells would fall drastically. Their Basic Attributes and physique would decrease as well. Under these circumstances, ordinary expert players would have difficulty fighting even Special Elite ranked monsters of the same level, let alone Lords and Great Lords.

This would be akin to tossing an ordinary player into a Team Dungeon filled with Boss monsters.

“The new guy’s here?”

“Now that everyone’s here, we can start advancing.”

At this moment, several voices came from a short distance behind Shi Feng. Turning around, Shi Feng noticed seven people sitting on a gravel pile and resting. The group consisted of both young and old, male and female. Even the lowest-leveled player in this group of seven was Level 72. Moreover, their equipment standard was not the slightest bit lower than Burning Sea’s.

Endless Scars sat among this group of seven. Only, the current Endless Scars was a lot different from the last time Shi Feng met her. Now, not only had her weapon and equipment undergone a massive improvement, but even the aura she exuded had transformed significantly. As if she were a Demon that had just walked out of the abyss, her aura was filled with coldness and madness, entirely different from her calm and cheerful aura from before.

When Endless Scars saw Shi Feng, she simply greeted him with a nod.

“Hello, I am the leader of this expedition team, Samsara,” a white-haired man who appeared to be in his 30s said as he approached Shi Feng.

The white-haired man gave off a friendly vibe; Shi Feng did not feel uncomfortable in the slightest while in the man’s presence. However, the white-haired man was actually the highest-leveled player present, having already reached Level 73. He could already rival Fire Dance, who was currently grinding relentlessly in the Bottomless Abyss, in terms of levels. As for the equipment the man wore, even the weakest piece was Level 70 Dark-Gold rank. In addition, he also sported six pieces of Epic Equipment. The shield and one-handed axe he carried were also of indiscernible rank.

However, even though Omniscient Eyes could not discern the rank of the white-haired man’s shield and axe, Shi Feng recognized them because they had been extremely famous in his previous life. They were a set of Magic Weapons called the Purple Thunder Set. The set’s overall performance was much better than that of individual Magic Weapons.

“Hello.” Shi Feng nodded as he looked at Samsara, his mind filled with confusion.

His confusion was because he had never heard of the name Samsara in his previous life. Moreover, the Purple Thunder Set’s owner should be a Tier 5 female Guardian Knight, and the Purple Thunder Set had never changed owners, as far as he knew. The female Guardian Knight had relied on this Magic Weapon Set to rise to fame in God’s Domain.

“Our mission this time is to reach the Thunder Temple in the deeper area of this plain. You’ve seen the situation here for yourself already. Since you’re a Swordsman, you and Happy Art will be responsible for the healer’s safety as well as supporting the others in the team. Do you have any problems with this arrangement?” Samsara asked as he pointed at a female Shield Warrior with a beautiful appearance and a magnificent body.

At this time, Shi Feng was only one level away from the Level 80 threshold. Currently, however, he had disguised himself as a Level 72 Swordsman, a very standard level in this team. As for his equipment standard, he had matched it to the equipment standard of current apex experts. Anyone using an Identification Skill on him now would find that he was wearing five pieces of Epic Equipment, with the rest being Level 70 Dark-Gold Equipment. Unless someone in the team could see through the concealment ability of his Fragmented Legendary ranked Nightwalker’s Cape, they would see only this information and nothing more.

“That’s fine.” Shi Feng nodded.

In such a poor environment, fights would undoubtedly be drawn-out and challenging. Hence, the healer could be said to be the backbone of the team. If the healer died, the team would not be able to advance at all. Moreover, the poor environment here had a much greater effect on magical-class players, as their Lifesaving Skills would be much less effective than usual. Hence, prioritizing the protection of the healer was indeed the best decision.

“Since there are no problems, everyone, let’s move according to the original plan,” Samsara said to the others in the team.

Upon hearing Samsara’s command, everyone quickly fell into formation. The Guardian Knight Samsara took the lead while Burning Sea and Endless Scars supported him from the sides. The Assassin and Ranger of the team went to lure monsters over. As for Shi Feng and the Shield Warrior Happy Art, they flanked Frozen Gem, who was the team’s healer.

“New guy, the monsters here are very powerful. Run to me if you find yourself unable to hold on,” Happy Art said as she clapped Shi Feng’s shoulder in a friendly manner.

“Alright, I’ll be troubling you at that time,” Shi Feng responded.

Shi Feng could tell that this beautiful Shield Warrior was very powerful. Her strength was most likely on par with Burning Sea. She would be treated as a genius even in Super Guilds, although he had never heard of the name Happy Art in both his past and current lives. As a Shield Warrior, she would be much better at tanking monsters than a Swordsman like himself. Since the other party was showing him goodwill, he naturally wouldn’t reject it.

After Samsara finished making sure everyone knew what they needed to do later, he led the team deeper into the desolate wasteland.
