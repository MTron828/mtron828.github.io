Chapter 820 – Outcome

When Shi Feng activated Sword Law World, Chains of Law emerged from the void to restrain Ink Crystal. Even though Ink Crystal’s Law Projection put up a strong resistance against the chains, they still weakened her by 15% in all aspects.

“What a powerful Tier 6 Super Spell!” Ink Crystal was a little surprised when she sensed the Chains of Law affecting her. However, her surprise was brief before she said, “Even so, you still can’t stop my Thornstorm!”

Previously, when she allowed Shi Feng’s Law Projection to affect her, it suppressed her in all aspects. It even suppressed her surrounding environment, preventing her from using her surroundings to her advantage.

Now, although Sword Law World had similarly weakened her in all aspects, it failed to recreate the Law Projection’s environmental suppression.

However, before the first hundred vines could connect, Shi Feng suddenly transformed into a 20-meter-tall giant covered in glowing divine patterns. His Life Rating also increased, and his Basic Attributes could now rival a Level 190 player equipped with four Divine Artifacts.

After activating Holy Mana’s Body, Shi Feng executed Dark Moon to defend himself without hesitation.

This time, a moon several times larger appeared in the void, and the moonlight it radiated eliminated the oncoming vines like light erasing darkness. The difference between the two attacks immediately became apparent.

…

“Crap! He managed to block even that?!”

“No way! Ink Crystal got pushed back!”

When the radiant moonlight dissipated, the spectators were stunned to see Ink Crystal moving back by half a step. Ink Crystal’s five party members were especially shocked by this development. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“What an incredible Berserk Skill! He actually managed to push the leader back by half a step!” the bald young man from the Ink Crystal Party said in astonishment as he looked at Shi Feng’s mighty figure.

When enhanced by Ink Crystal’s Primordial God-ranked Law Projection, Thornstorm could exhibit unbelievable power. Even players equipped with four Divine Artifacts using a Peak Gold-ranked technique couldn’t necessarily neutralize it, let alone overpower it.

Players like Garuda and Daystar, who had previously traded blows with Shi Feng, were equally shocked.

He still wasn’t going all out just now? Garuda had mixed feelings as he looked at Shi Feng.

Originally, Garuda thought Shi Feng had only won their fight by a small margin. If he wasn’t being humble, he might even consider it a lucky victory. However, it was evident that Shi Feng had never fought him seriously. Otherwise, the duel could have ended on the first exchange.

Meanwhile, unlike most other spectators, Verdant Rainbow grew ecstatic when she saw Shi Feng’s small victory.

We have a chance! Verdant Rainbow thought, her eyes sparkling when she saw Ink Crystal getting pushed back slightly.

Truthfully, Verdant Rainbow didn’t have much confidence in Shi Feng defeating Ink Crystal. Now, though, it would seem she was mistaken, and Shi Feng had a great chance of winning.

Although Ink Crystal lost less than 1% of her HP in the exchange, it should be known that she no longer possessed a stronger attack. So long as Shi Feng could repeat this exchange, it would only be a matter of time before he won.

….

Meanwhile, inside the ring, Shi Feng naturally realized his advantage. Thus, he promptly brandished the Shadow Incinerator at Ink Crystal again, not allowing the other party to catch her breath.

Not to mention, World’s Descent only had a five-minute duration. Once the Skill ended, he would no longer have a Goddess-ranked Law Projection backing him. At that time, he would be completely at Ink Crystal’s mercy.

“Are you trying to whittle me down? How boring.” When Ink Crystal saw Shi Feng attacking her frenziedly, she did not panic. Instead, she calmly said, “I was originally thinking of giving you some hope, but now… I should show you what it truly means to be a Mortal God.”

After saying so, Ink Crystal stamped her feet and began to dance. Then, countless vine spears materialized in the void and rotated around her as if dancing along with her.

When this new batch of vine spears appeared, Shi Feng’s heart sank.

This is…a Twofold Implement Manipulation Technique!

When Shi Feng saw the rotating vine spears impacting and transferring their power to one another, he quickly understood that Ink Crystal was executing a Twofold Implement Manipulation Technique. Moreover, she wasn’t simply executing the same technique twice simultaneously. She had also merged the power of the two techniques, achieving a situation where 1 + 1 was greater than 2.

Boom!

The instant the moonlight of Dark Moon collided with the vine spears, Shi Feng instantly experienced a powerful backlash through the Shadow Incinerator. Immediately afterward, he stumbled three steps backward, and his HP fell by 10%.

…

A Twofold Peak Gold Technique?! This must be a lie! How can there be such a huge difference with just a one-floor difference?! Rin’s jaw dropped as she looked at the dancing girl in the ring.

Among Crystallian players, experts who had progressed to the later stages of the fifth-floor standard would be considered incredibly fortunate if they could properly execute a Peak Gold Implement Manipulation Technique. As for executing a Twofold Peak Gold Implement Manipulation Technique, that was something they didn’t even dare to think of accomplishing. Yet, Ink Crystal had accomplished it with ease.

Garuda, who was a Half-step Mortal God, was similarly horrified by this development. He never imagined there could be such a huge gap between him and Ink Crystal in technique usage.

Is this what a true Mortal God is like? Elise was thunderstruck as she looked at Ink Crystal.

Although Elise had previously managed to execute a Twofold Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique, which could be considered as strong as a Twofold Peak Gold Implement Manipulation Technique, she only managed it with the help of the black book she wielded. In contrast, Ink Crystal performed this complicated execution all by herself.

…

I’m bound to lose at this rate! It seems I can only go for broke!

When Shi Feng saw Ink Crystal attacking him again with a Twofold Thornstorm, he gripped the Shadow Incinerator with both hands and executed a simple downward slash.

Profound Skill, The End!

After he undid the Shadow Incinerator’s second seal, The End became his greatest trump card. Although the Skill’s 30-minute Cooldown prevented him from using it more than once in a single fight, in return for sacrificing one level, he could unleash the Shadow Incinerator’s full power and deal a devastating blow that covered a 50,000-yard radius. The attack could also theoretically reach the Tier 6 Limit standard.

Suddenly, flames that burned as hot as the sun appeared in the void and collided with the oncoming vine spears.

Boom… Boom… Boom…

Spatial storms swept the battlefield, causing cracks to even appear on the barrier around the ring.

When the storms subsided, Shi Feng and Ink Crystal stood quietly facing each other. Shi Feng remained intact. In contrast, Ink Crystal lost 20% of her HP, and her clothes looked scorched.

However, the silence on the battlefield lasted very briefly as Ink Crystal promptly followed up the exchange with another Twofold Thornstorm.

I lost? When Shi Feng saw that his last-ditch attempt failed to kill Ink Crystal, he stopped struggling and let Ink Crystal’s Thornstorm devour him.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng disappeared from the battlefield, Ink Crystal revealed a solemn expression as she looked at where Shi Feng originally stood.

What a terrifying attack. If not for the Divine Illusion Garb’s ability to weaken one instance of fatal damage, I would have died just now.
