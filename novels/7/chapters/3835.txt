Chapter 3836 - 910 - Gold Guest?

“We were here first! What gives you the right to take our room?!” Drifting Bean frowned, seething at the chubby young man.

Many other guests glared at the chubby young man at Drifting Bean’s words.

“Who is this person? How dare he act so arrogantly here?”

“We are in Desolate Star City’s territory. Are they not afraid of being kicked out?”

Everyone capable of attending the auction was someone of extraordinary stature. They were either the heirs of conglomerates or executives of upper-ranking hegemonic powers. Rarely would anybody dare disrespect them in public.

Yet, someone not only had the gall to jump the queue, but this person even did so in a wildly arrogant manner. This person was challenging the authority of Desolate Star City.

While Desolate Star City might be only a first-tier city, everyone present knew that an extraordinary power backed the city. Otherwise, it couldn’t have invited so many powers to attend its trade fair.

“What gives me the right?” The chubby young man glanced at Drifting Bean and said arrogantly, “The fact that I am Angel’s Retribution’s Crocodile Fang!”

The chubby young man’s answer frightened everyone present. Even Drifting Bean paled.

“Angel’s Retribution? Isn’t that the Angel Sanctuary’s number one power?”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Heavens! Desolate Star City managed to invite even Angel’s Retribution?”

“Crocodile Fang… I’ve heard of that name before. Isn’t that the son of Angel’s Retribution’s current Guild Leader? Not long ago, the successor of the Cruise Conglomerate provoked Crocodile Fang and ended up losing his successor qualifications. I heard he couldn’t even stay in mobile cities anymore and could only wander outside…”

In the blink of an eye, the guests in the hall no longer dared to disparage the chubby young man. Some even fled the lobby, not daring to get involved in this conflict.

The Twelve Sanctuaries were the center of the Greater God’s Domain. Any power capable of ranking as the number one power in any of the Twelve Sanctuaries was not an opponent the average power could afford to provoke.

Even if an extraordinary power backed Desolate Star City, it was unlikely that this power would dare to oppose Angel’s Retribution.

“Why the sudden silence, little girl?” Crocodile Fang sneered at Drifting Bean. “I’m already showing you leniency by having you go to the general area. If you keep upsetting me, I might even decide to have you kicked out of Desolate Star City!”

Although Drifting Bean still wanted to fight back, she ultimately chose to grit her teeth and keep quiet.

As a local of the Angel Sanctuary, Drifting Bean knew plenty about Crocodile Fang. In reality, there was nothing remarkable about the chubby young man. His talent was mediocre, barely reaching the fourth-floor standard after receiving astronomical resources from his father, Angel’s Retribution’s Guild Leader. If they were to meet out in the fields, Drifting Bean was confident she could kill Crocodile Fang under three moves.

The problem was the authority Crocodile Fang’s father wielded. Previously, when Crocodile Fang kill-stealed the Cruise Conglomerate’s successor and got killed because of it, Angel’s Retribution demanded the Cruise Conglomerate dismiss its successor and hand over the rights to ten Holy Cities. Failure to comply would mean making an enemy out of Angel’s Retribution.

As the Cruise Conglomerate was no match for Angel’s Retribution, it had no choice but to concede. Otherwise, its operations in the Angel Sanctuary would cease to exist.

Although the Blood Wing adventurer team was second only to the Angel Sanctuary’s pseudo-apex powers, it wasn’t a pseudo-apex power. It was nowhere strong enough to compete with the Angel Sanctuary’s number one power.

It should be known that Angel’s Retribution was publicly acknowledged as being strong enough to rival the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers. If Blood Wing were to become enemies with such a behemoth, surviving in the Greater God’s Domain would become a challenge.

When Drifting Bean chose to concede, Crocodile Fang noticed Xiao Quan’s gaze directed at the woman beside Drifting Bean.

“Brother Xiao, do you know this beautiful woman?” Crocodile Fang asked in an amused tone. “You should have told me you knew her. Wouldn’t that have solved our misunderstanding?”

“I do know her.” In response to Crocodile Fang’s question, Xiao Quan looked at Xia Qingying with a calm smile and said, “But Miss Xia has never given me the time of day. She even humiliated me a bunch in Silver Frost City. How would I dare introduce you to her, Brother Fang?”

“She humiliated you?” Crocodile Fang laughed. “In that case, how about I help you resolve the misunderstanding between you two?”

After saying so, Crocodile Fang walked up to Xia Qingying.

“Pretty lady, Brother Xiao and I are good friends, and it hasn’t been easy for me to invite him out on a trip. For my sake, how about you share a drink with Brother Xiao to clear up your past misunderstandings?” Crocodile Fang said. Then, he glanced at Drifting Bean and continued, “If you agree, I will treat this little beauty’s offense as nothing more than a misunderstanding. Otherwise, this little beauty will have to keep me company for a day as compensation.”

“You…” Xia Qingying turned ashen upon hearing this. She had never thought Xiao Quan could be acquainted with someone like Crocodile Fang.

At this time, the female head attendant responsible for escorting Xia Qingying’s group stepped forward hurriedly to intervene, saying, “Dear guest, please be reminded that we are in Desolate Star City. We have a duty to ensure the freedom of all guests visiting Desolate Star City.”

The female head attendant’s behavior surprised the spectating guests. They had never expected such a minor character to get involved in this situation. Did she not know of the consequences of angering Crocodile Fang?

However, everyone quickly noticed that Crocodile Fang did not react angrily to the female head attendant’s intervention.

“Of course, I understand. However, my father is acquainted with that great personage. If I say a few words to that great personage, I believe she won’t give you any trouble out of respect for me,” Crocodile Fang said, chuckling as he looked at the female head attendant.

Just as the female head attendant was about to say something else, the male head attendant in charge of escorting Crocodile Fang’s group stopped her.

“Shuoyun, stop interfering! Mr. Fang is a Gold Guest invited by that great personage! Mr. Fang knows what he is doing! You’ll be finished if you anger that great personage!” the male head attendant quietly dissuaded the female head attendant while pulling out an invitation made of gold.

When the female head attendant named Shuoyun saw the gold invitation, her expression darkened, and she dared not say anything more.

Although Desolate Star City had invited many people to its trade fair this time, very few received a gold invitation, and every one of them was highly valued by that great personage.

It seems I have no choice but to use my Elder status. When Endless Scars saw that Crocodile Fang did not intend to stop his persecution of Xia Qingying, she knew that an ordinary power’s authority would not be enough to deter him. If she wanted Crocodile Fang to back off, she would have to use her status as one of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s Elders.

At this time, though, a deep voice suddenly entered everyone’s ears, shocking them.

“Does Desolate Star City not know how to host a proper event? So what if they are Gold Guests? Aren’t we also?”
