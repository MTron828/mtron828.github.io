Chapter 3777 - 851 - Sixth-Floor Expert?

“I…don’t know…” Ember Dragon was similarly surprised by this turn of events. Then, he looked at the VIP room that South Lake, Holy Dragon Spear’s Great Commander, and another man occupied, and continued, “But South Lake should have something to do with this. Otherwise, Heiser couldn’t have improved so quickly.”

Ember Dragon acknowledged that Heiser was the most talented genius to have appeared in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary in the past several centuries. However, he did not think she could improve at such an unbelievable rate. Even with her talent, it simply shouldn’t be possible for her to go from conceptualizing an Advanced Gold Combat Technique to completing it in two weeks.

When a person conceptualized an Advanced Gold Combat Technique, their idea would often be riddled with flaws they needed to rectify to complete their technique. In this situation, a person would be lucky to complete their technique after several hundred attempts.

“Are you saying Heiser received that Legacy Guidance from the Apocalypse Berserker God?” When the bandage-wearing young man followed Ember Dragon’s gaze and saw the white-haired old man sitting beside South Lake, realization dawned on him. “I thought Apocalypse was adamant about saving it for Red Frost all this time. I’m surprised he changed his mind so quickly. Now, I’m really starting to pity Red Frost. First, she had her opportunity stolen by you in her younger days. Now, even the Apocalypse Berserker God has sided with Heiser. With this, she isn’t even qualified to fight Heiser, let alone sway the opinions of Holy Dragon Spear’s Elders and Grand Elders.”

“She only has herself to blame,” Ember Dragon said, sneering as he looked at Red Frost. “Had she partnered with me back then, she would have long since become Holy Dragon Spear’s Great Commander. Now, all she can do is watch helplessly as the person who has nurtured her since she was young sides with someone else.”

The Apocalypse Berserker God was formerly one of Holy Dragon Spear’s four commanders. He rose to prominence many years ago. He was also regarded as one of the Ten Great Berserker Gods in the Greater God’s Domain over a century ago, and many considered him to be Holy Dragon Spear’s strongest member. He had even obtained a Primordial God-ranked Legacy Guidance during his active days.

Presently, although Apocalypse was only an ordinary Grand Elder in Holy Dragon Spear, it was well-known that he still had the Primordial God-ranked Legacy Guidance with him, and many believed he was saving it for Red Frost, the Apocalypse Legion’s successor. Nobody ever thought he would give it to Heiser and enable her to reach even greater heights.

“I originally thought Heiser only had the potential. I hadn’t expected her to reach this step so soon,” Ember Dragon said, a hint of fanaticism in his eyes. “With her talent, I might just be able to recommend her to that side so long as she joins us!”

“That

 side?” The bandage-wearing young man’s eyes lit up in excitement. “Indeed. She does have the qualifications.”

Heiser’s talent thoroughly exceeded their expectations. Although she was a genius nurtured by Holy Dragon Spear, she would know to accept their invitation so long as she wasn’t a fool.

…

In another VIP room…

Unlike everyone else in the arena, South Lake reacted calmly to the revelation of Heiser’s combat standard. While the audience was making a commotion, he turned to the indifferent old man beside him, a hint of glee flashing in his eyes.

“Do you regret it?” South Lake asked playfully. “Your precious student is in a tough spot now because of you. Two days ago, she still had a chance to put on a performance. But now, she doesn’t even have that.”

“There is nothing to regret. She chose this,” the old man said as he looked at Red Frost calmly. “Moreover, it is beneficial for the adventurer team to have a Half-step Mortal God leading it. With this, the other powers will have to think twice when making a move against us in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary in the future.”

“That’s good to hear.” South Lake sighed in relief at the old man’s calm response. “The current God’s Domain is no longer as peaceful as before. Without a sufficiently strong expert leading Holy Dragon Spear, the other powers can easily devour us whole.”

“I know that.” The old man nodded and glanced at the Dragon God Palace’s room.

The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary might seem peaceful right now, but following the discovery of the Eternal Realm’s entrance, the flames of war had reignited in the Greater God’s Domain. Particularly, the Twelve Sanctuaries would definitely become the various powers’ main targets of contention once more. If Holy Dragon Spear did not have a sufficiently strong expert to lead it, it wouldn’t even be able to defend its current resources and territories, let alone expand.

…

In the ring…

“What a surprise. You are the second person to see through my true combat standard,” Heiser exclaimed in wonder, looking at Red Frost. “In that case, I’ll stop hiding it. Admit defeat. We might have been able to have a good fight if you were still at your peak and we were at the same level. But in your current state, I won’t need more than three moves to win.”

In reality, Heiser was speaking humbly when she said she could win in three moves. After all, she was currently at Level 227, while Red Frost was at Level 223. Even without considering the difference in equipment and combat standards, this four-level gap was enough to tilt the scales heavily in her favor.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Little girl, while you might be a Half-step Mortal God, you still aren’t strong enough to make me surrender,” Red Frost said before thrusting her spear. Simultaneously, the weapon transformed into a flame dragon hundreds of meters long that flew toward Heiser.

Advanced Gold Fusion Technique, Flame Dragon Dance!

With just one move, Red Frost turned the primeval forest into a sea of flames. Apart from the extremely violent fire element, all other magic elements ceased to exist. This development made the audience watching the match from a first-person perspective gasp.

“Law Suppression?”

“Is this an Advanced Gold Combat Technique?”

The average fifth-floor expert would be fortunate to even execute an Advanced Gold Combat Technique normally. Yet, despite her weakened soul, Red Frost managed to merge her Law Projection with an Advanced Gold Combat Technique perfectly, elevating its power to the standard of Peak Gold Combat Techniques. The level of expertise she showed was simply unheard-of.

“I see.” When Heiser saw Red Frost’s Flame Dragon Dance, she immediately understood that even with a level advantage, she couldn’t neutralize Red Frost’s attack with just an Advanced Gold Combat Technique.

Immediately, Heiser raised her emerald staff and created the magic arrays for three Tier 6 Curses. Then, she combined the magic arrays and drained all forms of energy within a radius of several thousand yards, creating an energy vacuum. Immediately afterward, a dragon claw the size of a mountain appeared in the sky and attacked the oncoming flame dragon.

Peak Gold Combat Technique, Triple Samsara!

This was Heiser’s strongest combat technique. It was also because of this technique that she could develop her own Advanced Gold Combat Technique.

Boom!

The instant the dragon claw and flame dragon collided, cracks appeared on the barrier covering the ring, and the primeval forest on the battlefield was reduced to ashes. The destructive power of the two attacks could already rival that of Ancient Gods of the same level.

After the explosion, Heiser and Red Frost both stumbled three steps backward. Compared to Red Frost, though, Heiser lost slightly less HP.

However, before the audience could marvel at the two, Red Frost swung her spear and thrust it at Heiser again. This time, though, the weapon split into two flame dragons instead of one.

Twofold Advanced Gold Fusion Technique, Flame Dragon Dance!

Silence enveloped the arena the moment the two flame dragons appeared. Even Heiser was momentarily taken aback.

A Mortal God?
