Chapter 3832 - 906 - God's Domain's Strongest Player

Starlight Continent, Green God Corporation’s Private Passenger Plane:

“Guild Leader Shi, we must be extra careful when buying Mana Sealing Wood in Desolate Star City later,” Xia Qingying said seriously as she led Shi Feng aboard the passenger plane. “The trade fair this time is out of the ordinary. It can be considered a first-class event, even compared to all the events hosted on the Starlight Continent and the neighboring continents throughout the years. Besides powers from the Starlight Continent, many powers from other interstellar continents have also been invited to attend the event, and some of them are bound to have established a foothold in the Eternal Realm.

“Since the Divine Engraving Scrolls started circulating in the Eternal Realm, many powers have thoroughly analyzed the scrolls. They should already know plenty about the scrolls by now, especially the scrolls’ material composition. If we slip up, it will be the end for us in the Greater World.”

“Don’t worry. I know the consequences,” Shi Feng said, nodding. “I’ll buy Mana Sealing Wood in small batches from different sellers and have them delivered to different Realms for your people to collect.”

Although Desolate Star City’s trade fair was held in the real world, the transfer of purchased goods had to be done in God’s Domain. With the God’s Domain Association insuring the transaction, neither party would dare to mess around. Otherwise, they would be punished by the God’s Domain Association and suffer dire consequences.

As for how he could avoid drawing attention, it was simple. Every power in God’s Domain needed rare materials. So long as he didn’t have all the Mana Sealing Wood he bought delivered to the same location, the sellers wouldn’t think too deeply about his purchases.

He could also conduct his purchases in person without worry. Not all powers were qualified to participate in such a grand trade fair. Naturally, those who failed to qualify would try to get attending powers to make purchases on their behalf. Moreover, there would be plenty of such powers. After all, now that various powers were trying to accumulate Eternal Coins, it was an excellent opportunity to purchase rare items and materials at a bargain.

So long as the sellers he bought from didn’t crosscheck their sales, nobody would suspect a thing.

“Alright, then.” Xia Qingying blinked in surprise. She hadn’t expected Shi Feng to be so quick on the uptake. Then, she smiled and continued, “By the way, I’ll introduce you to someone later. You can think of the other party as your great senior. This person arrived in the Greater World much earlier than you. If you can join forces with this person, you’ll have a much easier time in the Greater God’s Domain.”

“A person who arrived in the Greater World much earlier than I did?” Shi Feng had his interest piqued when he saw Xia Qingying snickering. “Could this person be one of the experts who went missing from our God’s Domain?”

Many experts had abruptly disappeared from their God’s Domain in this timeline. Although these disappearances had caused a huge uproar in God’s Domain, nobody knew where these experts had gone. However, as Shi Feng had entered the Greater God’s Domain in his previous life, he knew that most of these experts had entered the Greater God’s Domain ahead of time because of the Green God Corporation’s intervention.

After returning to this timeline, Shi Feng had thought of gathering these missing experts. After all, these experts had all accomplished extraordinary achievements in his previous life. It was also because of these experts that Zero Wing could survive Demon’s Gate’s persecution.

Unfortunately, he failed to gather much information on these experts. Now that Zero Wing’s development was focused on the Eternal Realm, gathering these experts became even more difficult.

“It seems you know quite a lot,” Xia Qingying said when she saw Shi Feng’s relatively calm reaction. “You are correct. This person is one of the experts who went missing in our God’s Domain. Also, it would be more accurate to say that the Green God Corporation can attend this fair only because that person received an invitation. Otherwise, the Green God Corporation, a corporation that is based in only several dozen cities, wouldn’t be qualified to attend this event at all.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Are the requirements that high?” Shi Feng was surprised.

The Green God Corporation might have branches in only several dozen cities on the Starlight Continent, but it couldn’t be considered an ordinary corporation. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have the ability to let people from their homeworld live in a third-tier mobile city as soon as they entered the Greater World.

If even the Green God Corporation wasn’t qualified for an invitation, how many corporations and powers from the Starlight Continent were qualified to receive one?

Two hundred?

One hundred?

“Extremely high!” Xia Qingying said, nodding solemnly. “As far as I know, only corporations with operations in 150 cities or more on the Starlight Continent have received an invitation. As for the Starlight Realm’s powers, only upper-ranking hegemonic powers and a handful of pseudo-upper-ranking hegemonic powers were invited.

“The invitation conditions for foreign corporations and powers are even more stringent. To be invited, foreign corporations and conglomerates need to be among the top ten of their respective continents, while foreign powers in the Greater God’s Domain have to be an upper-ranking hegemonic power.”

When Xia Qingying spoke up to this point, a prideful expression appeared on her face.

“This trade fair will be the grandest trade fair that the Starlight Realm and the neighboring Realms have ever seen in the last century. It might even exceed the trade fairs hosted by pseudo-apex powers,” Xia Qingying said as she led Shi Feng to the passenger plane’s VIP cabin.

When Xia Qingying pushed open the door to the VIP cabin, a lounge half the size of a basketball court entered Shi Feng’s sight.

Two people were currently seated in the lounge. One was an agile-looking, sixteen-year-old girl dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and shorts, while the other was a woman with a curly ponytail whose face was covered by a black veil.

Although the veiled woman’s appearance was hidden, she radiated extremely powerful mental fluctuations that exceeded even that of one-star great grandmasters. Evidently, the woman had reached the two-star great grandmaster standard, a standard that only a handful of individuals had reached on the Starlight Continent.

“Big Sis Xia, what took you so long? Also, can you please talk some sense into my commander? This is my first time going on a long-distance trip, yet she won’t even let me get off the plane to look at this city! What if I miss out on a potential opponent?” the agile-looking girl grumbled as she approached Xia Qingying and tugged on her sleeve.

“Sit down. You will get to look around once we arrive in Desolate Star City,” the veiled woman said indifferently, her voice compelling the girl to return to her seat obediently.

As this awkward interaction took place, Shi Feng suddenly thought of a name as he looked at the veiled woman. This was the name of the strongest player of his home God’s Domain in this timeline. It was also the name of the legendary Midnight Tea Party’s strongest commander.

Endless Scars!
