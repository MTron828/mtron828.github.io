Chapter 524 – Fighting a Tier 6 Opponent

Tier 6!

This was the highest tier players could achieve in God’s Domain. It was also the dream of countless players to reach this tier. Even with the countless experts that existed in the Greater God’s Domain, Tier 6 players remained the various powers’ core combat power.

Tier 6?!

Is this the Hades Society’s true capability?

!!

Hidden Soul, Liu Wusheng, and the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s other executives wore grim expressions as they quietly looked at the old man hovering above the city. The joy they felt from seeing Ink Qilin killing Heratis disappeared completely when they felt the aura coming from the old man and saw the Hades Society Guild Emblem the old man wore.

In the current Miniature Ancient World, Tier 6 was a goal that the various powers’ experts were frantically trying to reach. This was because they knew that the appearance of the first Tier 6 player would instantly change the Miniature Ancient World’s power structure.

Although Hidden Soul and the others had long known that a Tier 6 player could appear at any moment given the Miniature Ancient World’s current situation, they never thought the Hades Society would give birth to a Tier 6 player so quickly.

Shortly after the appearance of the elderly Berserker God, the various hegemonic powers’ executives present in Abyssal Star City went into an uproar.

“Is the Hades Society insane?! How dare they send Nightmare Chaser to the Miniature Ancient World?!” One Step was in utter disbelief as he looked at the old man in the sky.

Unlike the Miniature Ancient World’s native players, One Step knew a lot more about the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers.

Nightmare Chaser!

This was a name that any player who had operated outside the Starlight Realm would have heard of at least once. It was also a name regarded by the various powers operating in the Void Sea as taboo for their Tier 5 members.

More specifically, the various powers prohibited any of their Tier 5 members from taking action within the Hades Society’s Devil Fortress. This was because any Tier 5 player who dared to do so would be permanently removed from God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, the cause of these removals was none other than Nightmare Chaser.

Nightmare Chaser was the Tier 6 Berserker God responsible for guarding the Devil Fortress. He was also the biggest contributor to the Devil Fortress’s prosperity.

In the current situation where only Level 160, Tier 5 players were allowed to enter the Miniature Ancient World, the idea of sending a Level 220, Tier 6 Berserker God into the Miniature Ancient World was simply absurd. It was especially so when the Berserker God in question was Nightmare Chaser. After all, not only would it cost an astronomical expenditure to bring Nightmare Chaser back to Tier 6 within a short time, but it would also leave Devil Fortress without the infamous Nightmare Chaser’s protection.

“Abyssal Star City is a lost cause now,” Melissa stated with a sigh. Then, she turned her gaze toward Shi Feng, who stood in the Abyssal Star Plaza, and continued, “I thought I would have another chance to fight Black Flame again, but it seems that won’t be possible anymore.”

“What a pity.” One Step nodded in agreement as he similarly turned to look at Shi Feng. “With Nightmare Chaser’s personality, he absolutely won’t rest until every member of Asura is gone.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After losing to Shi Feng several months ago, One Step would often think of redeeming himself. But after seeing Nightmare Chaser, he did not doubt that be it Zero Wing or the Asura Mercenary Alliance, both would become history after today.

However, just when everyone thought Shi Feng would panic at the sight of Nightmare Chaser, Shi Feng nonchalantly glanced at the lean old man in the sky and said:

“I’m afraid you’re still lacking.”

These words were spoken in a flat tone, yet they echoed loudly in the ears of everyone present in Abyssal Star City.

Meanwhile, following Shi Feng’s words, the various hegemonic powers’ executives couldn’t help but look at him with their eyes and mouth wide open.

“…Is he crazy?”

“He still dares to make provocations at a time like this? Is he not afraid Nightmare Chaser will make him disappear from God’s Domain?”

“Does he think Ink Qilin can still protect him?”

When the various hegemonic powers’ executives saw Shi Feng’s behavior, they couldn’t help but think of him as a fool. After all, a Tier 6 Berserker God was present before him, yet he still failed to see the situation for what it was.

“How brave of you! It seems you have already prepared yourself to face the consequences of provoking a Tier 6 expert!”

Suddenly, Nightmare Chaser raised his hand and summoned a crimson saber. Then, he slashed downward with the saber, sending forth a frightening energy blade that threatened to cut Shi Feng and Abyssal Star City in half.

When the energy blade made contact with Abyssal Star City’s defensive magic array, it cut through the self-generated defensive magic array like a hot knife through butter. In front of the frightening energy blade, the defensive magic array that could normally withstand bombardment from an army of Tier 5 players behaved as if it did not even exist.

Meanwhile, all of the players in Abyssal Star City couldn’t help but be dumbfounded by this scene.

Is this how powerful Tier 6 players are? Sound Reaver thought. This was the first time she had seen a Tier 6 player in action, and she couldn’t help but be greatly shocked.

As an Advanced City, Abyssal Star City came with a defensive magic array that could withstand continuous bombardment from over a thousand Tier 5 experts. Without Skills and Spells specifically designed to break barriers, it would be impossible to break the defensive magic array within a short time. This had already been proven multiple times in the Miniature Ancient World.

Yet, the defensive magic array that had withstood numerous attacks from various hegemonic powers failed to last even one move against Nightmare Chaser. The gap between Tier 5 and Tier 6 players was magnitudes greater than what she initially thought.

Meanwhile, different from Sound Reaver, Shi Feng remained unfazed in the face of Nightmare Chaser’s attack. He didn’t even try to evade it, looking like he was simply waiting to receive the Berserker God’s judgment.

But just when it seemed like the energy blade was about to hit Shi Feng, a figure appeared before him, the shield in the person’s hand raised to face the energy blade directly.

A moment after the shield and energy blade made contact, a deafening explosion reverberated throughout Abyssal Star City. The resulting shockwaves were so powerful that most of the Tier 5 players standing in the plaza were sent flying over a hundred yards away.

When the dust settled, a large, bottomless fissure could be seen splitting the plaza. Two people could also be seen standing at one end of the fissure, and they were Shi Feng and the shield-wielding Ink Qilin.

“They didn’t die?”

“What did she do?”

The various Tier 5 experts situated around the plaza couldn’t help but doubt their eyes.

There was no doubt Nightmare Chaser’s attack carried devastating power. It simply wasn’t an attack Tier 5 players like themselves could hope to withstand. This was evident just by looking at Abyssal Star City’s fading defensive magic array. Even the slightest contact with this attack could probably reduce a Tier 5 tank to dust.

Yet, not only did Ink Qilin survive blocking Nightmare Chaser’s attack, but the HP she lost from doing so was also inconsequential.

“How is this possible?!”

“Is she really just Tier 5?”

Riding atop the wyverns loitering above the city, Daybreak and Death Stride were visibly shaken as they looked at Ink Qilin.

No one knew the might of Nightmare Chaser better than them. Even if Nightmare Chaser was still at Tier 5, the two of them working together would not last more than three moves against him.

Yet, even though Nightmare Chaser was currently at Tier 6 and wielding the Legendary Weapon Revenant Blade, Ink Qilin didn’t even lose 3% of her HP from blocking Nightmare Chaser’s attack.

…How was this even possible?
