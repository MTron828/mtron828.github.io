“What’s going on? Why is that great grandmaster challenging the Guild Leader?”

“He thinks he can defeat the Guild Leader in three moves? How arrogant is he? The Guild Leader is among the Divine Glory List’s top 300 experts!”

“That person might be arrogant, but it’s a fact that he is a great grandmaster. In an even fight in a simulation battle, not even the Divine Glory List’s top 100 experts can necessarily beat him.”

Xiao Yilong’s challenge sparked discussions among the people in the hall.

Zero Wing was no longer an unknown Guild. Not only was it the sole Guild based in Star Lake City, a second-tier mobile city, but it also wielded considerable influence in the Eternal Realm. Additionally, Shi Feng, Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, was an expert on the Divine Glory List. His name was known by many across the Greater God’s Domain, and few Guilds and experts would dare to challenge him.

However, Xiao Yilong, as a great grandmaster, was no ordinary individual, either. Besides being qualified to be the City Lord of a first-tier mobile city, he could enjoy executive treatment if he joined a pseudo-apex power. This was because even the weakest great grandmasters could rank among the Divine Glory List’s top 100. It was just that most great grandmasters found it beneath them to do so unless they could enter the top 10.

“What? Don’t tell me you don’t dare?” Xiao Yilong curled his lips at Shi Feng. “If you’re worried about having an equipment disadvantage, we can fight under the same Basic Attributes. I can defeat you in three moves nonetheless.”

“Don’t be rash, Shi Feng,” Red Frost hurriedly whispered to Shi Feng after hearing Xiao Yilong’s provocation. “Xiao Yilong is only a step away from the pseudo-sixth-floor standard. Even the current Divine Glory List’s top 30 experts can’t beat him under the same Basic Attributes.”

Red Frost knew Xiao Yilong well. The man might look like a musclehead, but he was a meticulous person. He would never fight unprepared.

Although Shi Feng currently ranked among the Divine Glory List’s top 300 and could be considered an apex expert in the Greater God’s Domain, he still had a long way to go before he could match a veteran expert like Xiao Yilong.

While Xiao Yilong might not have much fame in the Greater God’s Domain, he was well-known within the Holy Dragon Spear adventurer team. Even among the many apex experts in Holy Dragon Spear, Xiao Yilong could rank among the top two Shield Warriors.

“Don’t worry, Commander Frost. I know my limits,” Shi Feng said, nodding to Red Frost. Then, he turned to Xiao Yilong and continued, “Since you wish to test me, we can fight in the advanced combat simulation room on the third floor, Mr. Xiao.”

“At least you’re not a coward.” Xiao Yilong was a little surprised by Shi Feng’s answer. He hadn’t expected Shi Feng to accept his challenge.

After Shi Feng agreed to Xiao Yilong’s challenge, he led the other party to an advanced combat simulation room on the third floor, the sight causing a stir in the crowd in the lobby. Immediately, everyone focused their attention on the lobby’s broadcast screen, which now showed the situation in the advanced combat simulation room.

“Big Sis Frost, your Guild Leader sure is something,” Twilight Leaf, the fairy-like woman, said as she watched Shi Feng go upstairs. Then, she turned to Red Frost and smiled. “If anyone else had heard your goal is to take revenge on the Uncrowned War God, they would probably have been scared out of their wits. Yet, your Guild Leader is willing to stand up for you and claim that he can help you defeat Ember Dragon. I can see why you were willing to join a small Guild like Zero Wing. It’s just that he will probably suffer at Uncle Xiao’s hands first.”

“I wouldn’t necessarily say that,” Red Frost retorted. “Although Xiao Yilong is strong, Shi Feng is by no means weak.”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Are you sure you’re not just putting him on a pedestal?” Twilight Leaf asked, astonished by Red Frost’s claim. “That’s Uncle Xiao we are talking about. Even if Black Flame is strong enough to enter the current Divine Glory List’s top 100, it will still be a tall order to survive three moves against Uncle Xiao.”

“I don’t know if Shi Feng can enter the current Divine Glory List’s top 100, but based on what I heard, he killed Demon’s Gate’s White Ghost in the Eternal Realm not long ago. He even did it with just three moves,” Red Frost explained.

“He killed White Ghost in three moves?” Twilight Leaf was surprised.

Demon’s Gate was an apex power, and the Six Great Paragons it nurtured in this generation were known across the Greater God’s Domain. White Ghost was especially well-known among the Greater God’s Domain’s upper echelon, and many believed his combat standard was already worthy of the Divine Glory List’s top 100. He merely needed time to bring his other parameters up to standard.

Assuming there was no difference in Basic Attributes, only the Divine Glory List’s top 30 experts could defeat White Ghost in three moves.

If Shi Feng had accomplished such a feat, Xiao Yilong might have trouble defeating him.

While Red Frost and Twilight Leaf chatted, Shi Feng and Xiao Yilong appeared on the broadcast screen.

Currently, Shi Feng and Xiao Yilong could be seen standing on a street in a dilapidated city. Their Basic Attributes had been lowered to the same standard, and they stood less than 500 yards apart. Since they were both at Tier 6 in the simulation, they could close this distance in three seconds if they sprinted.

“It’s started!”

“Holy! That Shield Warrior is so fast! He’s as fast as experts executing an Advanced Gold Body Technique!”

Following the simulation room announcing the start of the duel, everyone saw Xiao Yilong raising his shield and saber, splitting into three, and charging Shi Feng from three different directions—moving faster than Tier 6 experts executing Basic Gold Body Techniques.

Before anyone in the lobby could react, Xiao Yilong arrived within 20 yards of Shi Feng. Then, all three copies of himself swung their sabers down at Shi Feng, the weapons leaving afterimages that made it look like three walls of sabers were descending upon Shi Feng. Additionally, these saber walls formed a triangular encirclement as they came down on Shi Feng, which made it impossible to dodge them all.

“Sure enough, he is only one step away from reaching that standard.” Red Frost subconsciously held her breath when she saw Xiao Yilong’s performance.

The others in the lobby might be unable to determine the intricacies behind Xiao Yilong’s move, but experts who had learned Advanced Gold Combat Techniques could tell that Xiao Yilong had just executed an Advanced Gold Fusion Technique. This indicated that Xiao Yilong could already achieve the Advanced Gold Combat Technique standard with his every move. Otherwise, he could never have pulled off such a complicated fusion technique.

“Why isn’t he moving?” Twilight Leaf stared at Shi Feng in confusion. “Did he give up?”

If Shi Feng had indeed slain White Ghost in three moves, his strength wouldn’t be too far behind Xiao Yilong’s. Yet, even though Xiao Yilong was already attacking him, Shi Feng still did not unsheath his swords.

Amidst Twilight Leaf’s confusion, Shi Feng suddenly raised his right hand at Xiao Yilong. Immediately afterward, an indescribable wave of energy spread from Shi Feng.
