Chapter 3260 Chapter 334 – Monster-Level Treatment

“Coming in 10th on the first test?”

Markless Blade, who had taken a seat next to the fighting right, was similarly shocked when he heard the silver-haired youth’s report.

As one of the Star Lake Legion’s vice commanders, Markless Blade had a much more thorough understanding of Star Lake City’s situation than outsiders.

Going by Star Lake City’s database, the last time someone had ranked within the top 30 of the city legion’s selection on their first try was several hundred years ago. That person was also the only person to have accomplished such a feat in Star Lake City. Meanwhile, that person eventually rose beyond the realm of mental strength grandmasters.

!!

Three-star mental strength grandmasters were individuals qualified to pioneer a third-tier city in the Greater World and become the lord of a city. Should three-star mental strength grandmasters join a corporation, they would be given the position of Grand Elder without question.

As for individuals who had gone beyond mental strength grandmasters, they were all big shots in the Greater World, and even conglomerates would strongly try to recruit them. At the same time, they were also the foundation for corporations to become a conglomerate.

If a newcomer really did manage to come in 10th place in Star Lake City’s selection on their first test, Markless Blade couldn’t even begin to imagine what such a monster could accomplish in the future.

Once news of such a monster spread, the Star Lake Legion’s competition wouldn’t just be limited to Star Lake City’s various powers. The powers of the various mobile cities would also try to get in on the action. Even the various conglomerates might go out of their way to recruit this monster.

“But it’s going to be a challenge to snatch up such a monster,” Red Frost said after pondering for some time. “Do you have any details of that person?”

“We only know that her name is Bai Qingxue, also known as Gentle Snow in God’s Domain, it is her first time entering the Greater World, and she is currently tied to the Zero Wing Guild,” the silver-haired youth answered. “Zero Wing also happens to be the Guild that Shi Feng, the person you asked me to keep an eye on, belongs to.”

“Zero Wing?” Red Frost was a little surprised, and she couldn’t help but chuckle. “What an interesting Guild we have on our hands.”

Markless Blade was similarly surprised.

If it was a few days ago, he wouldn’t have even known about the Zero Wing Guild. Now, however, he couldn’t stay ignorant about Zero Wing’s existence even if he wanted to. After all, the person who had defeated him in the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition was none other than Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, Black Flame.

Now, not only was it revealed that Zero Wing possessed an expert of Black Flame’s caliber, but the Guild also possessed a monstrous genius like Gentle Snow.

If the news about Gentle Snow was real, Zero Wing was no longer a Guild that could be underestimated.

“We should act quickly, Commander. Otherwise, that monster might get snatched away by another city,” the silver-haired youth urgently suggested to Red Frost.

News of such a frightening monster would definitely reach the neighboring cities. After all, every city needed powerful experts to defend and lead it to acquire more resources and achieve stable growth. Meanwhile, if a third-tier city could grow into a second-tier city, the city’s environment would undergo a qualitative transformation, and all residents of the city would see an increase in their life expectancy.

Because of how much value monsters like Gentle Snow could bring, every one of them was a hot commodity among the various third-tier cities.

However, it wasn’t necessary for Gentle Snow to stay in Star Lake City. So long as other cities were willing to accept her, she could move to that city and become a resident there at any time…

“Relax.” Red Frost smiled. “Even if the other cities want to compete for her, they will have to wait until the selection is over, just like us. Not to mention, we have the home-ground advantage. Rather than focus on what the other cities will do, we should pay closer attention to the corporate powers acting in secret. Bring some people over and make sure no accidents happen.”

“Understood!”

The silver-haired youth quickly understood Red Frost’s point and promptly left the room, not daring to waste even a moment.

There were many corporations in the Greater World, and there were bound to be some that wouldn’t mind using unscrupulous means to achieve their goals. It was especially true when a monster-level genius was involved. The best time to strike at these geniuses would be when they were weak and without any powerful support.

If a genius such as Gentle Snow met with an accident in Star Lake City, Star Lake City would definitely become a laughing stock for the neighboring cities.

…

Less than half an hour after Gentle Snow’s test results came out, a group of one-star mental strength grandmasters gathered outside the God’s Domain Association Building entrance. Every one of these mental strength grandmasters wore the uniform of the Star Lake Legion’s official participants, and their arrival surprised many of the people in the building.

These one-star mental strength grandmasters were different from the bodyguards hired by the various corporations. Every one of them was relatively young, and most of them were under the age of 35. Moreover, all of them were combat experts equipped with Mind Assistant Devices. These one-star mental strength grandmasters could even take down a two-star mental strength grandmaster if a few of them worked together.

Normally, these elites of the Star Lake Legion wouldn’t show themselves in the God’s Domain Association. Yet, now, a group had gathered outside the Association Building’s entrance.

“What’s going on? Why did the Star Lake Legion’s elites come here to stand guard? Is some big shot visiting the Association?”

“Did you not hear? A monster who managed to come in 10th place on her first test has appeared in Star Lake City.”

“What? The Star Lake Legion dispatched one of its ace battle groups for her? Isn’t the legion worried the battle group’s training might get affected? I recall that there is going to be a city battle next month. If this affects the outcome of the city battle, it will be a huge loss for Star Lake City.”

“A huge loss? Not at all. I’ll have you know that we are talking about the most talented genius Star Lake City has ever seen here. Once that monster grows up, she will become an existence that can help Star Lake City get elevated into a second-tier city. If that monster joins the Star Lake Legion, the city wouldn’t care even if it loses several city battles, let alone one.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone started an enthusiastic discussion over the Star Lake Legion’s actions. At the same time, they also couldn’t help but be surprised by the lengths the Star Lake Legion was willing to go to recruit a monster-level genius. Normally, even geniuses who had already joined a conglomerate wouldn’t dare to receive such treatment.

After all, it should be known that members of the Star Lake Legion’s ace battle groups were geniuses among geniuses. Among them, there were even paragons nurtured by the various hegemonic powers. In terms of strength, they were vastly superior to newcomer geniuses. Some of these paragons could even reach similar heights as the internal geniuses nurtured by the various conglomerates.

…

God’s Domain Association, first-floor lobby.

Gentle Snow, is it?

Fighting spirit burned in Thousand Scars’ heart when she saw the Star Lake Legion members standing guard outside the lobby.

Meanwhile, when Death Omen, waiting in line next to Thousand Scars, saw the look on the other party’s face, she suddenly smiled and said, “You don’t have to worry, Qianheng. Gentle Snow might have extraordinary talent, but she still won’t be a match for you in the future. Lord Supreme Sky has already prepared a big present for you. Once you enter the Greater World, even once-in-several-century monsters will be nothing but a joke to you. At that time, you’ll even have hopes of becoming a core member of the Paimon Conglomerate.”

Thousand Scars nodded to Death Omen’s words. Talent might be important, but one’s achievements in the Greater World and the Greater God’s Domain were also highly dependent on the resources and opportunities one had access to. When it came to these two factors, she was vastly superior to Shi Feng and Gentle Snow.

…

While Star Lake City’s various powers and participants were talking about Gentle Snow, Shi Feng had already conveyed all of the general information he knew about the Greater World and the God’s Domain Association to Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow, the information leaving the two women in awe.

At the same time, Shi Feng also told the two to fully utilize the Association’s resources during this period, even if it meant dropping some of their responsibilities in the Miniature Ancient World. After all, personal strength was the number one priority in the Greater World. Everything else was secondary. Only with great strength could they get the various powers and cities to make them better offers.

Afterward, Shi Feng returned to his room and logged back into God’s Domain.

When Shi Feng reappeared in the Ancient River Secret Land, he saw that Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao had already withdrawn from the ancient stele’s learning state. When the two girls saw Shi Feng returning, they turned to look at him with undisguised excitement in their eyes.

“Did you two succeed?” Shi Feng asked, feeling a little surprised when he saw the two girls’ expressions.
