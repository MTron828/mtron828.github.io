Chapter 2956 Chapter 30 – Final Creation

Shi Feng was momentarily stunned as he looked at the icy-cold longsword and gray key hovering before him, his mind having a hard time accepting this situation.

In the present God’s Domain, the number of people who knew about Primordial Objects probably did not exceed ten.

Items of this level could only be found outside the world of God’s Domain or ruins of Ancient Gods. This was because God’s Domain had been split into countless fragments during the Great Ancient War. The current main continent that most players roamed on was merely one part of the true God’s Domain.

The Miniature Ancient World he currently resided in was once a part of the main continent of God’s Domain as well.

Not to mention, even Legendary items would be damaged and disappear under the erosion of time. Thus, Primordial Objects were incredibly rare in the present era, so rare that they could rival the rarity of Eternal Items.

Shi Feng knew about Primordial Objects because he came across one while participating in an auction in an Outerworld (another world’s God’s Domain). The Primordial Object he saw was a severely damaged breastplate, and it was utterly unusable at the time. However, the materials used to craft the breastplate were stronger than even the materials used to craft modern Divine Artifacts. So, although the breastplate was no longer usable, it could be melted to produce a new weapon or equipment.

At the time, many Outerworld God-ranked experts had fought to acquire this breastplate. Eventually, a Tier 6 Berserker God had won the breastplate after paying a steep price of four Legendary items. Then, he had a Famed Smith craft him a new breastplate. Meanwhile, the quality of the breastplate had exceeded the Legendary rank, becoming the first Fragmented Divine Artifact ranked equipment usable by players!

Indeed!

A Fragmented Divine Artifact!

It was an item that had reached the step above Legendary. It was also an item that many God-ranked experts had once thought that players couldn’t use. Even Shi Feng was under the same assumption that that was the case. After all, he had seen even Divine Artifacts before, let alone Fragmented Divine Artifacts. In fact, any player who had reached Tier 5 would’ve probably seen a Divine Artifact or two at some point. This was because there were two Divine Artifacts displayed in the War God’s Temple’s treasury: Meteor Glow and Frost Heaven.

Meteor Glow was a staff, and Frost Heaven was a spear. Both were the best items the War God’s Temple had to offer.

Initially, Shi Feng had thought that the War God’s Temple was only showing off those items to players due to their absurdly expensive price tags. However, after that Tier 6 Berserker God had worn a Fragmented Divine Artifact, everyone finally understood that players, too, could use Divine Artifact ranked weapons and equipment.

It was also because of that Fragmented Divine Artifact that the Berserker God who owned it became publicly acknowledged as the number one Berserker God across multiple worlds, and no other Berserker God could ever hope to be a match for him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, not only did the Purple Crystal Treasure Chest in front of him contain two Primordial Objects, but both items were complete and usable. How could Shi Feng not be surprised and shocked by this situation?

It should be known that whether it was in this God’s Domain or other God’s Domains, none of the Primordial Objects he had heard about had ever been a complete item!

Thinking up to this point, Shi Feng quickly suppressed the excitement in his heart and retrieved the two Primordial Objects in front of him. Then, he opened their Attribute Panels, eager to see what they were like.

“Final Creation?” Shi Feng was momentarily stunned when he saw the icy longsword’s information.

…

Shi Feng wasn’t a stranger to the Ancient God of Thunder. This was because the creator of the Solomon’s Sword he used in his previous life was none other than the Ancient God of Thunder. Meanwhile, Solomon’s Sword was also considered one of God’s Domain’s Ten Great Legendary Weapons.

The sword that I failed to find in my last life… I didn’t think it would be here. It’s no wonder why I couldn’t find it no matter how much I searched the main continent. Shi Feng couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile as he looked at the pitch-black longsword in his hand.

As one of the oldest Ancient Gods, the Ancient God of Thunder had created many swords during his existence. Among them, the most famous one was none other than Solomon’s Sword. However, few people knew that Solomon’s Sword wasn’t a completed product but a half-finished product instead.

The reason for that was that nobody had ever managed to gather all of the necessary fragments, not even Shi Feng.

After Shi Feng had acquired Solomon’s Sword and used it for some time, he realized that the weapon was actually missing half of its power source. Meanwhile, after doing some research, he discovered that the remaining half was inside the Ancient God of Thunder’s final creation.

Yet, now that Solomon’s Sword was no longer in his possession, he had obtained the final creation instead…

However, after rueing over this ironic situation for a moment, Shi Feng wiped his bitter smile away and stored the Winter of Eternal Night away. Although Solomon’s Sword’s fragments were currently scattered across God’s Domain right now, it was still a good start to have the Winter of Eternal Night.

Subsequently, Shi Feng shifted his attention onto the gray key, his expression growing stern.

Not only did this gray key not originate from his current sub-world, but it was even an item from the main world of God’s Domain. Although he was missing a significant portion of his memories right now, he still vividly remembered that any item from the main world would pose extreme danger to a sub-world.

He had heard of one instance where a main world item had caused the disappearance of an entire sub-world in the past. Moreover, every Tier 6 God-ranked expert that couldn’t hold back their curiosity and tried to look into this matter had fallen…

It should be known that Shi Feng wasn’t a Tier 6 Sword God right now. He was merely a Tier 3 Sword King who had practically nothing to his name. If a problem occurred due to this gray key, he would be utterly powerless to salvage the situation.

Meanwhile, the gray key had a very simple function. So long as one could perfectly solidify Mana, one could activate the key and travel between the many worlds of God’s Domain!

While this function might not seem like much, if any Super Guild learned of it, they would probably lose their minds over it. They wouldn’t even hesitate to start a war against every power in God’s Domain so long as they could acquire this gray key.

At this point, the various Super Guilds should’ve already learned that there wasn’t just one God’s Domain in existence, but many instead. They should’ve also learned about the main world and its importance. Unfortunately, entering the main world and securing a foothold wasn’t an easy task. It was an endeavor that required a large number of God-ranked experts.

However, producing a God-ranked expert was easier said than done. Not only did it require an astronomical amount of resources, but it also required a large number of opportunities and Legacies.

Meanwhile, a single sub-world’s limited resources and opportunities were only enough to facilitate the birth of a limited number of Tier 6 God-ranked experts. If a sub-world wanted to produce more God-ranked experts, it would have to plunder resources and opportunities from other sub-worlds.

However, entering other sub-worlds was a difficult feat even for God-ranked experts. Normally, only when a World Passage appeared could the players of two sub-worlds freely travel to each other’s world. Although other means were available for players to travel between sub-worlds, achieving success with these means was unimaginably difficult. Moreover, even if players got lucky and crossed worlds, they would still have to deal with the foreign world’s suppression. In the end, they wouldn’t be able to accomplish anything meaningful.

However, it was a different story for the gray key before him. Not only did it allow him to open passages to other sub-worlds, but it also allowed him to avoid facing any suppression from the foreign sub-worlds. This gray key was essentially a free pass to the many sub-worlds of God’s Domain. Even describing this key as heaven-defying would be an understatement!

Whatever. I can only take things one step at a time right now.

After taking a long look at the key in his hand, Shi Feng stored it in his bag and chose to log off for the day. He needed to plan out how he should earn Academy Points. After all, what he needed to do most right now was improve his physical fitness in the real world and improve his brain’s activity. If he couldn’t even get his body to meet the minimum standards of getting promoted to Tier 4, there’d be no point in talking about the future.

…

God’s Domain Academy, advanced training hall:

Various smart training equipment was situated across the hall that was the size of a sports arena. Not only could this training equipment perfectly measure a person’s physical parameters, but it could also provide personalized training solutions to allow users to train with maximum efficiency. There were also autonomous robots available for sparring purposes, and those who chose to spar with these robots could maximize the improvement of their physical fitness and combat techniques. These were all advanced technological products that ordinary training centers in the outside world couldn’t purchase.

Meanwhile, in addition to the Academy’s instructors, only a few students were present inside the training hall. This was because only the Academy’s instructors and students who had received A-rank evaluations on their academic performance were qualified to enter this training hall. Moreover, just spending one hour in this training hall would cost one 2,000 Credits or 2,000 Academy Points. It was not an expenditure that ordinary students and instructors could afford.

However, at this time, most of the instructors and students present weren’t actually doing any training. This was because they had their attention attracted toward the person who had just entered the hall.

The person in question was a sexy girl with shoulder-length brown hair. She wore a white sports T-shirt and shorts that revealed much of her healthy wheat-colored skin. Meanwhile, as soon as this woman entered the hall, she promptly made her way toward Wu Lingling, who was going through a reaction test right now.

“Crap! Isn’t that Senior Ziyou?! Why is one of the Four Heavenly Kings here?!”

“I know, right? After she won in the Professional League’s third preliminary round, I heard that she is now in line to be selected as one of the preliminaries’ seeded candidates! I heard that even some first-rate Guilds have extended an invitation to her already!”

When the students in the hall saw this brown-haired girl, feelings of admiration appeared in their eyes. Many of the instructors present even cast envious gazes at this girl.

Apart from Wu Xiaoxiao, the God’s Domain Academy’s star and a monstrous genius, the Academy also had four top-tier geniuses. Every one of these four geniuses had long since surpassed most of the Academy’s instructors in terms of combat standards. If not for Wu Xiaoxiao’s appearance, these four top-tier geniuses would’ve been the Academy’s pride.

Meanwhile, Chen Ziyou, the brown-haired girl, was one of these four top-tier geniuses, also known as the Academy’s Four Heavenly Kings.

However, despite Chen Ziyou being such a talented beauty, few boys in the Academy dared to pursue her. Even the Academy’s wealthy young masters dared not have any designs over her.

This was because Chen Ziyou wasn’t just one of the Academy’s Four Heavenly Kings. At the same time, she was also Senior Instructor Qi’s favored student. In the future, there was a very high chance that she would join one of God’s Domain’s Super Guilds. After all, Chen Ziyou was currently only in her third year. She still had one entire year to develop herself.

Apart from Chen Ziyou, there was also a man who had entered the hall at the same time as she did. This person was none other than Luo Tiancheng, who had come running here in a hurry after learning about Chen Ziyou’s visit. At this moment, though, Luo Tiancheng’s dignity as a teacher was nowhere to be seen as he simply stood behind Chen Ziyou like a follower while Chen Ziyou waited for Wu Lingling to come out of the reaction tester.

After a minute, Wu Lingling came out of the reaction tester covered in sweat. Then, when Chen Ziyou saw the result displayed on the tester, she said, “Not bad, Little Ling. It’s been a while since I last saw you, but I didn’t think your reaction standard had already reached Excellent. You’re outperforming even your elder sister.”

The reaction test results could be categorized into five ranks: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Excellent, and Perfect.

Even among senior students, those who received an Advanced evaluation for their reaction test were the minority. As for those with Perfect evaluations, they could rank among the Academy’s top 30 students.

It should be known that even Chen Ziyou herself had reached Perfect only recently…

“Why are you here, Big Sis Ziyou?” Wu Lingling asked, feeling slightly surprised when she saw Chen Ziyou. Chen Ziyou was one of her elder sister’s good friends and someone akin to a second big sister. Even before she entered the God’s Domain Academy, Chen Ziyou had given her a lot of pointers and helped her with training.

“Of course, it is because I have business with you. Moreover, it can be considered good news for you,” Chen Ziyou said, smiling. There was also a hint of envy in her voice when she spoke.

“Good news?” Wu Lingling grew confused. “What good news?”

Seeing the bewildered look on Wu Lingling’s face, Chen Ziyou put on a formal smile and said, “My instructor, Instructor Qi, wishes for you to become his student. Moreover, so long as you become my instructor’s student, not only will you get a training slot in World Domination, but you will also receive one of the Legacy slots Shadow acquires in the Miniature Ancient World!”
