Chapter 121 - Invitation

When Shi Feng arrived at Jin Hai City’s business district, he wandered about and discovered customers flooding the electronics department store. He noticed several youths rushing out of the department store after much difficulty, their hands holding a God’s Domain virtual gaming helmet and their expressions filled with joy and excitement.

After leaving the apartment, Shi Feng immediately hitched a ride to the business district in the city’s center.

“Hahaha, this is just wonderful! Fortunately, I came here as early as 7 o’clock in the morning to queue up. After three hours of waiting, I finally got my hands on it! From today onwards, I will be fighting for my future in God’s Domain!” the lean youth wearing a blue T-shirt laughed loudly as he grasped the helmet.

“Do you need me to carry you guys? I have a friend who has been playing God’s Domain since the game started. Right now, he is already a Level 4. As long as we have him to help us, we’ll definitely level quickly. If we’re lucky, we might even be able to have him carry us,” another curly haired youth proudly proclaimed.

“Really? Then it’s a promise! Our futures will be in your hands from now on. As for your lunches at the university, we’ll pay them for you.”

“Leave it to me! He and I are close brothers!”

When these youths heard there was an expert willing to give them pointers and carry them, they were all incredibly excited. They fantasized about their beautiful futures.

With the many global corporations fiercely investing in God’s Domain, in addition to the many news reports about it, the common folk all discovered a new way to make money.

These large corporations would easily offer a gaming expert a high salary. So much so that, for some of the veteran and expert players, the annual salaries would reach as high as three million Credits. This was an unimaginable figure when considering the virtual reality games of the past. Previously, those with an annual salary in the millions just from gaming were godlike players standing at the apex. Now, however, even retired experts could receive an annual salary of three million Credits. Meanwhile, the current trending top-tier experts could receive an annual salary of up to eight million Credits. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

According to Shi Feng’s knowledge, the annual salary of the Guild Leader of Ouroboros did not even exceed six million Credits, while Gentle Snow’s annual salary was only four million Credits. Of course, the Snow Goddess would not even pay heed to this small amount of money. She could easily obtain an income of several tens of millions just from advertisement. In addition to her family background, money was truly not a problem for her. Unlike Shi Feng, who played God’s Domain to change his fate, fulfilling his wish that never was fulfilled, Gentle Snow’s goal was purely the joy gained from stimulating adventures.

“Luckily, I’m not here to buy a gaming helmet,” Shi Feng sent a glance to the sea of people at the department store, exclaiming. He then turned towards a mobile phone store near the electronics department store.

It was an inconvenience for him to continue using an old-modeled phone. Hence, Shi Feng was prepared to switch to a quantum watch instead. Not only did it support communication between multiple languages, but it also supported bank account binding, allowing Shi Feng to transfer Credits at any given time. This way, he would neither have to always go to the bank to retrieve money nor would he have to constantly carry around a stack of cash, causing a bulge in his pockets. He could avoid showing others a bulge on his lower body, preventing an awkward situation from occurring.

Immediately after Shi Feng walked into the quantum watch store, a beautiful saleswoman came up to greet him.

“How may I help you, Sir? Our store’s number one priority is quality. We have various models of mobile phones. I especially recommend the latest Quantum 3000. It has an independent binding, is water resistant, and is definitely safe. Not only can it carry out payment in real-time, but the Quantum 3000 also supports transactions from the virtual reality game, God’s Domain.”

“Alright, take me to see it then.”

“This way, please, Sir.”

Judging from Shi Feng’s tone, the beautiful saleswoman could discern that Shi Feng intended to buy a quantum watch. Immediately, she respectfully brought Shi Feng to the area dedicated to selling quantum watches. She then took out dozens of models. Not only were their designs beautiful, but they were also elegant-looking and convenient to use. They were all operated by a holographic screen, and even when carrying out vigorous activities, the clarity of the display and sound would not be affected in the slightest.

“Sir, as we are doing a promotion for God’s Domain, you only need to pay 29,999 Credits instead of the usual 30,000 Credits to take the Quantum 3000 home.”

Shi Feng could not help but sweat at the saleswoman’s promotion. Just how was this any different from 30,000 Credits? This price was practically unaffordable for the average university student if they did not possess a well-paying job, and even then, they would usually need to save up for half a year before being able to buy one. However, Shi Feng was indeed in need of the latest quantum watch. After all, it would be particularly convenient for him. Although running to the bank was good training for his body, it was, after all, a very troublesome task. It was especially true when he needed to make a transaction of millions of Credits. He would definitely look fishy if he carried around a large suitcase filled with money.

“Give me this blue one, then,” Shi Feng chose a good-looking model.

Under the beautiful saleswoman’s guidance, Shi Feng carried out the bindings for his identity, original phone number, bank account, and so on. Shi Feng then swiped using his new quantum watch, paying the bill for it. It was a very convenient item.

Now that he had obtained a quantum watch, Shi Feng went on to purchase 10 bottles of A-rank Nutrient Fluids and 50 bottles of B-rank Nutrient Fluids, spending a total of 150,000 Credits for them. Although it was a heartache to spend so much money, in consideration for the future of his body, Shi Feng still needed to carry out several in-depth strengthening training sessions. So, he needed to purchase this number of Nutrient Fluids at the very least.

Di... Di... Di...

His quantum watch rang and vibrated, notifying him that his class monitor, Zhao Ruoxi, was calling him.

Aside from notifying him about the class assembly last time, the class beauty, Zhao Ruoxi, had never once contacted him.

“Class monitor, is something the matter?” Shi Feng immediately asked.

“Fellow student Shi Feng, must I have a purpose to call you? Or are you trying to tell me that you hate receiving calls from me?” Zhao Ruoxi said in a slightly downcast tone.

“No, no. How could that be possible? I still haven’t thanked you for your help the last time!” hearing such a bitter tone from Zhao Ruoxi, Shi Feng hurriedly responded. In his heart, Zhao Ruoxi was a very good girl. Not only was she smart, kind, and beautiful, but she was also the only one who stood up to Ling Feilong, demanding justice for Shi Feng. Her actions gave Shi Feng a warm feeling.

“That’s better. At least you still have a conscience.” Zhao Ruoxi laughed, “The date of the Fellowship Party I mentioned to you the last time has been confirmed. It will be held next Friday. Every participant will be required to pay a fee of 5,000 Credits. I’ve already paid it for you, so don’t forget to show up.”

Finished speaking, Zhao Ruoxi immediately disconnected the call. As a result, Shi Feng was left dumbfounded for a long moment.

“Ruoxi, why did you notify Shi Feng? You’ve even paid the participation fee for him. He’s not anything good, to begin with, always keeping his thoughts and emotions to himself. He must have a hidden motive. There is a wide gap between both of your statuses, and to change his own fate, he will definitely use unscrupulous means to get close to you. You better not let him trick you,” Ling Feilong pretended to care about Zhao Ruoxi. However, inwardly, he was close to the point of going insane with anger. A poor bastard like Shi Feng actually received Zhao Ruoxi’s attention. She even footed the participation fee for him. Her actions revealed that she indeed possessed some interest towards him.

“Enough, Ling Feilong. Whoever I pay for is my own business. I don’t need you to butt in on it,” Zhao Ruoxi said in displeasure.

Ling Feilong was speechless. However, he did not dare to display his thoughts, hatred for Shi Feng permeating his heart. Originally, everything had been smooth sailing for him. Yet, Shi Feng’s sudden appearance caused everything to run amok.

Shi Feng, just you wait... If I can’t deal with you myself, then I’ll just tell Zhao Ruoxi’s uncle. We’ll see how he takes care of you... Ling Feilong inwardly sneered. With Shi Feng’s lowly status, Zhao Ruoxi’s uncle would definitely reject them being together. As long as he exerted a little effort, he could easily deal with a small fry like Shi Feng.

At 6 p.m., Shi Feng returned to his rented apartment. After spending the afternoon running around, Shi Feng finally found himself a good apartment in the city’s center. The furnishing of the apartment was quite thorough. Moreover, the surrounding environment was very appealing. With the initial deposit paid, as long as he packed up his things, he could move into the apartment tomorrow.

After tidying himself up, Shi Feng drank a bottle of B-rank Nutrient Fluids. He then lay on the bed, donning his gaming helmet and resuming his conquest in God’s Domain.
