Chapter 426 - A Godly Tool

When Shi Feng appraised the pendant with Omniscient Eyes, the process actually required ten full seconds to complete.

Shi Feng had used Omniscient Eyes to appraise many Unknown items before. However, those normally took one or two seconds, with high-end items requiring two or three seconds. Even Dark-Gold items only needed four or five seconds.

However, the pendant required ten!

“Jackpot!” Shi Feng could not help but smile.

Ornaments were much more difficult to obtain than weapons and equipment. Even after reaching Level 40, a majority of the players in God’s Domain would still have around Level 20 ornaments. Moreover, these ornaments would be low quality, with Mysterious-Iron rank as the average, and Secret-Silver rank as the more powerful ones.

“Guild Leader, look at how happy you are. What sort of treasure is this?” Fire Dance asked curiously upon seeing Shi Feng’s grin.

“I don’t know.” Shi Feng shook his head. “It’s still being appraised.”

After ten seconds, a notification from the system sounded out, signifying appraisal’s completion.

Shi Feng then clicked on the dark-blue crystal pendant, checking its Attributes.

“What?!”

Shi Feng’s eyes shone upon seeing the Attributes of the pendant.

[Icarus’s Heart] (Necklace, Bronze Rank [Can be evolved])

Equipment Requirement: All Attributes 90

Level 20 - Level 50 (Currently Level 20)

All Attributes +8

Luck +5

Additional Skill -

Divine Providence: Temporarily increases player’s Luck by 20 points for 30 seconds.

Cooldown: 1 hour

Evolution Condition: Absorb the souls of 100 Lord ranked monsters to evolve to Mysterious-Iron rank. (0/100)

Although the Icarus’s Heart was only Bronze rank right now with low Attributes, the 5 points of Luck were extremely valuable. More importantly, it had Divine Providence, instantly increasing a player’s Luck by 20 points. This offered a player 25 points of Luck.

The Luck Attribute was the most precious Attribute in God’s Domain. Not only could it increase the equipment drop-rate when killing monsters, but it could also increase the success rate when producing items. It was an extremely valuable Attribute for Lifestyle players, and it was an Attribute that would never become outdated.

With just 1 point of Luck and players’ current levels, their drop-rate would almost double. Although increased values of Luck offered diminished returns, 25 points of Luck could still increase the drop-rate by six or seven folds.

If Shi Feng activated Divine Providence when killing a Boss, skyrocketing his Luck, his chances of obtaining a high-quality item would improve significantly.

Previously, Shi Feng had reaped massive harvests with only the 3 points of Luck that Shadow’s Blessing provided.

Normally, Lord ranked Bosses would only drop Secret-Silver items; Fine-Gold items if one were lucky. With 25 Luck, however, Shi Feng could almost certainly obtain a Fine-Gold item when he killed a Lord. If he killed a High Lord, it might drop a Dark-Gold item.

Icarus’s Heart was most likely even more valuable than an Epic item.

Unfortunately, the Equipment Requirements for Icarus’s Heart were quite high, requiring 90 points in All Attributes. Throughout Zero Wing, only Shi Feng could equip it.

I need to kill 100 Lords to evolve it? Its demand is quite high. After reading the Attributes of Icarus’s Heart, many ideas flooded Shi Feng’s mind. The Warfire Set Equipment unique to White Fog Canyon, in particular, was the Level 30 Fine-Gold Set Equipment that countless Guilds dreamed of obtaining.

Currently, Icarus’s Heart was only Bronze rank. If he evolved it to Fine-Gold or Dark-Gold rank, it would offer far more Luck points. At that time, it would be a godly tool when raiding large-scale Team Dungeons.

Zero Wing was already the center of attention right now. If other Guilds knew that Zero Wing possessed an item like Icarus’s Heart, they would lose their patience with Shi Feng’s Guild. It was highly possible that they would unite to attack Zero Wing. Hence, Shi Feng had no intentions of letting others discover Icarus’s Heart.

Moreover, he would only make a fortune if he kept quiet about it. He would be a fool to reveal his hidden cards.

“Fire Dance, we’re returning.” Shi Feng smiled faintly as he switched out the Shadow’s Blessing around his neck for the Icarus’s Heart. He then said, “Let’s go make a fortune.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Guild Leader, there might be more treasures deeper in the cave. Are we not going to search for them?”

The Final Cave intrigued Fire Dance. She had discovered a Dark-Gold Treasure Chest just by exploring this far. If they searched the cave, they might stumble upon something greater.

Shi Feng shook his head, laughing bitterly, he said, “Our strength is still lacking. We will only find our deaths if we delve further. If you don’t believe me, go down this passageway, and you’ll reach a large, empty hall. Take a peek outside the hole, and you’ll know.”

Previously, while Shi Feng still had Omniscient Eyes activated, he had perceived everything within 100 yards of him. Roughly 70 yards away, there was a hole that led to a large hall. Inside the hall, there were two Level 30 Great Lords guarding a tightly sealed stone door. However, as the path was dimly lit, players could only see around forty to fifty yards ahead of them, so neither of them had noticed the hall before.

Two Level 30 Great Lords!

One of such monsters could easily annihilate a team of several thousand Level 30 elite players. With their team of 500, they would only die if they forged ahead. They wouldn’t even be enough to fill in the gaps of the teeth of those two Great Lords.

Initially, Fire Dance had not believed Shi Feng and had chosen to advance. After walking for some distance, she suddenly froze.

She had not stopped because she did not wish to continue forward. Rather, it was because she could faintly see the hole. However, Fire Dance could feel power and killing intent that gave her goosebumps radiating from the hole. She felt as if she would plunge into an abyss if she took another step.

Fire Dance’s intuition was undoubtedly correct. If she dared to enter the hall, the Great Lords inside would slaughter her mercilessly; thus, Shi Feng had told her only to take a peek from outside the hole.

“Alright, let’s head back. We shouldn’t make Aqua and the others wait for us too long,” Shi Feng laughed as he saw the hesitant look on Fire Dance’s face.

Fire Dance obediently nodded. She then pouted at Shi Feng, complaining, “Guild Leader, you’re too evil!”

If Shi Feng had told her there were such powerful monsters ahead, she would not have approached them. Fortunately, she had sensed them and stopped. Had she not, the consequences would have been dire.

“Relax. Those monsters are only guarding the door. As long as we don’t go through the hole, they won’t attack us,” Shi Feng said, laughing. “However, after not seeing you for some time, it seems that your senses have grown sharper. You sensed the danger when you were halfway there.”

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s praise, a tinge of red appeared on Fire Dance’s cheeks. Even so, she was still somewhat frustrated.

Shi Feng could sense danger from so far away, yet, she had to be so close...

After rejoining the team, Shi Feng led everyone to the path they had come from.

Along the way, they continuously killed the patrolling Level 28 Earthen Puppets.

After Shi Feng joined the team, the journey that would have originally taken the team the majority of the day was shortened to only a few hours. Everyone’s experience bars had soared as they traveled. Shi Feng had also risen to Level 23 as a result. However, everyone was more shocked by the loot that dropped than they were by their EXP gain.

Before Shi Feng’s return, the majority of the loot they had obtained after killing the Earthen Puppets consisted of Level 25 Bronze Equipment; very rarely did they obtain Level 25 Mysterious-Iron Equipment. Now, however, more than half of the drops were Mysterious-Iron Equipment.

“Guild Leader, we’ve tried fighting the Flame Guards outside. Unfortunately, we don’t have any defense against their Flame Domain,” Aqua Rose said, feeling a slight headache coming over her as she watched the Flame Guards outside the cave entrance.

“The Flame Domain is indeed a problem. However, we are not without solutions,” Shi Feng said, smiling as he looked at the surrounding environment.

Originally, he had planned to lure the Flame Guards away from the cave. However, upon recalling that the Icarus’s Heart required him to kill 100 Lords to evolve it, he was sorely tempted to take on the Flame Guards.
