Chapter 2858 - Intercontinental Teleportation Magic Array

Starlight Fortress, Summoning Tower:

After spending over 80,000 Magic Crystals to purchase all of the materials he needed from Divine Tribe, Shi Feng immediately began working on the Summoning Tower’s teleportation array. The Summoning Tower’s main purpose was to summon monsters. It was a construction unique to the Starlight Fortress.

However, the Starlight Fortress itself could be considered a Teleportation Tower, as it possessed a teleportation array and a spatial node passed down since ancient times. These inheritances were what allowed the Summoning Tower to summon monsters from other worlds to fight for the Starlight Fortress.

Under normal circumstances, it shouldn’t be possible for the Summoning Tower to facilitate intercontinental teleportation.

However, Shi Feng was now a Grandmaster in manipulating magic arrays. He even possessed a Teleportation Magic Array Design. Hence, he could make the impossible possible.

Not to mention, he had also seen quite a few Guild Cities that possessed player-made intercontinental teleportation arrays in his previous life.

To achieve intercontinental teleportation, one needed to fulfill three conditions.

The first condition was to have a Grandmaster Magician.

The second condition was to have a Teleportation Magic Array Design.

The third and most important condition was to have a spatial node on one of the two continents.

Only after fulfilling these three conditions could one construct an Intercontinental Teleportation Magic Array.

Meanwhile, there weren’t many spatial nodes on the two continents. In total, they numbered less than 20. Moreover, many of them were in dangerous forbidden lands. However, so long as one managed to secure a spatial node, they could freely travel between the two main continents, no longer subject to the various limitations of ancient intercontinental magic arrays. This was why Shi Feng was adamant about acquiring the Starlight Fortress previously. The only flaw intercontinental teleportation arrays had was their colossal energy consumption. Instead of using Magic Crystals like ordinary teleportation arrays did, an intercontinental teleportation array required Mana Stones as fuel. Moreover, each teleportation cost ten Mana Stones. If the job of synthesizing Mana Stones using Magic Crystals were left to a Master Alchemist, it would cost nearly 1,000 Magic Crystals per teleportation. With such a high cost, even superpowers wouldn’t be able to afford to teleport people between continents in large numbers.

However, even with such a limitation, the intercontinental teleportation array was still plenty amazing

After all, the two main continents had different resources. Trading in these resources could net massive profits. Moreover, transportation by teleportation was much more convenient than by air or by sea.

Most importantly, an intercontinental magic array could allow a Guild to synergize its forces on the two continents. This Guild could operate on the two continents as if operating on a single continent, free of the problems arising from operating on two different continents.

This was also one reason Shi Feng had been desperately working to become a Grandmaster Magician all this time. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As Shi Feng was quietly constructing the intercontinental magic array in the Summoning Tower, Divine Tribe’s executives suddenly held a meeting in the Guild’s temporary Residence in the Starlight Fortress.

“Fithalia, is what you say true? Can Black Flame really connect the two continents?” Great Elder Adolf asked in disbelief as he looked at Fithalia.

When Adolf heard that Shi Feng had reached the Half-step Tier 5 and World Creation standards and single-handedly killed over a dozen Tier 4 NPCs, he had already been incredulous. Yet, Fithalia was now telling him that Shi Feng could also create an intercontinental teleportation array. How could he possibly believe her?

However, Adolf also understood one thing very clearly-Fithalia was never one to exaggerate things. Since she had said so, then this matter was most likely true. Only, he still couldn’t help seeking further confirmation from her.

“With Black Flame’s personality, it’s unlikely he would lie. Not to mention, he doesn’t have any reason to lie to us,” Fithalia replied after giving the matter some thought. “After all, even if he can’t connect the two continents, with the strength and potential he has displayed and the Starlight Fortress’s support, should Zero Wing fall on the eastern continent, it can easily rise again on the western continent. Zero Wing won’t need our support at all.”

“That makes sense.” Adolf nodded.

The Starlight Fortress had a Tier 4 Divine Dragon guarding it. Unless a Tier 6 God or a group of Tier 5 existences attacked the fortress, nothing could threaten the fortress. Not to mention, Shi Feng was already highly likely to get promoted to Tier 5. Whether it was now or in the future, he definitely couldn’t be underestimated.

“The reason I called everyone here is to recommend that we deepen our partnership with Zero Wing,” Fithalia said as she took out a set of documents detailing the eastern continent’s situation. After sending a copy to everyone present, she continued, “This is the latest report on the eastern continent’s state of affairs. Several more superpowers have come from the Outerworld recently. Although there shouldn’t be any large-scale battles occurring between the Outerworld invaders and the eastern continent’s natives, friction between the two sides will definitely occur one way or another. Meanwhile, Zero Wing’s resources are extraordinary. A battle between Zero Wing and the Outerworld invaders is inevitable.

“Hence, I propose that we have some of the Guild’s Tier 4s head to the eastern continent to support Zero Wing. This way, Divine Tribe will have some initiative in future partnerships with Zero Wing.”

When Fithalia finished speaking, everyone present promptly nodded in agreement.

Before today, they had merely treated Zero Wing as an ordinary superpower and did not put much thought into their partnership with the Guild. However, after today’s incident, they could no longer afford to do so.

This was because Zero Wing possessed not only a Half-step Tier 5 expert but also an intercontinental teleportation array linking the two continents. Once word of this teleportation array got out, the Starlight Fortress would undoubtedly become the western continent’s focal point. At that time, the Starlight Fortress’s income would definitely multiply by tenfold or more.

If Divine Tribe could get a cut of this pie, it would be of significant help to the Guild. With Divine Tribe’s foundations, the resources from the Starlight Fortress might even allow it to rival the Five Great Super Guilds.

“I don’t see any problem with this.” Looking at Fithalia, Adolf pondered for a moment before saying, “Since we are going to help Zero Wing on the eastern continent, Fithalia, take MacAffrey and Crimson with you. The two of them should be able to help Zero Wing solve many problems.”

“Thank you, Great Elder.”

Fithalia was overjoyed when she heard Adolf’s words.

MacAffrey and Crimson Witch were top combatants of Divine Tribe. The two of them possessed Fragmented Legendary items and were fully geared in Epic Weapons and Equipment. Most importantly, both had broken through the 100% threshold of their Mana Bodies. Crimson Witch, in particular, had even reached the 105% Completion Rate.

Adolf aside, the Completion Rate of Crimson Witch’s Mana Body was the highest in Divine Tribe.

If not for Fithalia owning a Fragmented Legendary Weapon, she wouldn’t be a match for Crimson Witch.

“I’ll contact the two of them in a moment. As for everything else, I’ll leave it up to you,” Adolf said, nodding.

Originally, Adolf had other plans for MacAffrey and Crimson Witch. However, taking into account Zero Wing’s potential, he deemed deepening Divine Tribe’s relationship with Zero Wing much more valuable.

Shortly after Divine Tribe’s executives concluded their meeting, Shi Feng completed the intercontinental teleportation array at the top of the Summoning Tower.

Good! The spatial coordinates are stable! Now, I just need to set up a corresponding teleportation array on the eastern continent, and the two continents will be connected!

Shi Feng nodded in satisfaction as he looked at the intercontinental teleportation array before him.

This intercontinental magic array was definitely his best creation since he began playing God’s Domain. Not only did constructing this magic array require a lot of knowledge and understanding of the various elements of Mana, but he also had to convert a Master Teleportation Magic Array into a Grandmaster Teleportation Magic Array. The difficulty of such a feat was simply extraordinary. Shi Feng suddenly received a call soon after completing the intercontinental teleportation array.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, I have already arranged the matter you asked before,” Fithalia said as she looked at Shi Feng through the video chat. Smiling, she continued, “You can head over to the eastern continent together with us at any time. If it’s the intercontinental teleportation array in the Hell Forest City Secret Land, we should be able to reach the eastern continent in less than two days.”

“Together?” Surprised by Fithalia’s words, Shi Feng asked, “You plan on heading to the eastern continent as well, Commander Fithalia?”

From what he understood, Divine Tribe had never shown any interest in the eastern continent. The Guild had always focused on the western continent. Not to mention, the current eastern continent was an incredibly dangerous place. Most importantly, Divine Tribe had to pay a huge price to send people to the eastern continent.

The superpowers controlling ancient intercontinental teleportation arrays normally charged around 8,000 Magic Crystals and various precious materials per person when facilitating travel between the two continents. Moreover, this was still considered a friendship price.

Even for a superpower, having many people travel between the two continents would still be a considerable expenditure.

In response to Shi Feng’s question, Fithalia nodded and smiled. “Mhm. Our Guild has some matters to deal with on the eastern continent. I’m afraid we will have to trouble you at that time, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

“You’re being too polite, Commander Fithalia. Your Guild has helped me plenty on the western continent,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “If you encounter any trouble on the eastern continent, feel free to look for me.”

“Since you’ve said so, I definitely won’t hold back when that time comes, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Fithalia said, her smile turning even brighter.

“Naturally.” Shi Feng nodded.

Besides Divine Tribe’s status on the western continent, just being able to form friendly relations with Fithalia herself was already well worth his time. After all, there weren’t many players capable of reaching Tier 6 in God’s Domain.

Shi Feng ended his call with Fithalia, then sorted out the Starlight Fortress’s income. He collected the 2.14 million Gold and 930,000 Magic Crystals the fortress earned during this period and made his way to the fortress’s entrance. And after he met up with Fithalia’s group of three, they promptly made their way to the Hell Forest City Secret Land’s intercontinental teleportation array.

After waiting for more than a day for the teleportation array to activate, Shi Feng transformed into a streak of light and disappeared from the secret land.
