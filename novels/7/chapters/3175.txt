Chapter 250 – Terrifying Abyssal Star City

“As expected of a primordial settlement. To think it would undergo such a drastic change just by becoming a Basic City.” When Hidden Soul sensed the change in Abyssal Star City’s mana environment, flames of excitement ignited in her eyes. “With the current Abyssal Star City, it’s only a matter of time before we can catch up to the foreign superpowers.”

At present, local players of the Miniature Ancient World were vastly inferior to the foreign God’s Domains’ players in terms of combat standards. It was especially true when they compared the core members of both sides’ superpowers.

In the case of foreign superpowers, even the weakest of their core members were Void Realm experts rivaling local Domain Realm experts in strength. In comparison, local superpowers would be fortunate if their core members could even reach the Void Realm standard, let alone the Domain Realm standard.

Simply put, local superpowers had too few experts they could put to use. Even the Five Great Super Guilds were no exception.

However, Abyssal Star City’s mana environment, which rivaled the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s mana environment, combined with the various Combat Legacies brought in from the Greater God’s Domain, it would be easy for the Asura Mercenary Alliance and its associates to nurture a batch of capable core members within two or three months.

“Catch up to those superpowers?” Shi Feng shook his head and chuckled when he heard Hidden Soul’s words. “Isn’t your goal a little too small?”

The Abyssal Star Primordial City was one of the Nine Primordial Legacy Cities of the Second Sequence. Moreover, going by the Primordial Tower’s effects, Abyssal Star City was most definitely ranked near the front of the Nine Primordial Legacy Cities. With Abyssal Star City, it’d be child’s play for the Asura Mercenary Alliance and its associates to surpass the various superpowers from the Greater God’s Domain.

Small?

Liu Wusheng, Galaxy Past, and Crimson Heart, who stood nearby, couldn’t help but be stunned by Shi Feng’s response.

They might not have understood how powerful the Greater God’s Domain’s superpowers were in the past. However, after these superpowers displayed a portion of their strength in the Miniature Ancient World, they realized just how massive of a gap existed between their local superpowers and the Greater God’s Domain’s superpowers.

Setting aside core members, just the number of God-ranked experts they had was different by orders of magnitude. Even the weakest among the foreign superpowers had dispatched over a dozen God-ranked experts into the Miniature Ancient World, while the stronger ones had mobilized two or three dozen.

In comparison, the Asura Mercenary Alliance in its entirety only had nine God-ranked experts under its service...

“I doubt you’ll believe anything I say now, so it’s best if you check it out for yourselves,” Shi Feng said as he glanced at Liu Wusheng and the others. Then, he led everyone to the Primordial Tower located at the center of the city.

The Nine Primordial Legacy Cities would undergo a qualitative transformation whenever they underwent an upgrade. It was especially true for the cities core structures. In Abyssal Star City’s case, this core structure would be the Primordial Tower.

…

Primordial Tower:

As soon as everyone entered the Primordial Tower, they promptly noticed that the environment inside the tower had also undergone an earth-shattering change.

“How is this possible?!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Liu Wusheng and the others were dumbfounded when they saw the mana environment inside the tower.

The mana inside the Primordial Tower had always been much denser than the mana outside. Even before Abyssal Star City was upgraded into a Basic City, the Primordial Tower’s mana had already reached a near mist-like state. At the time, the Primordial Tower’s mana environment was already comparable to the holy lands for mana found on the main continent.

Now, though, the Primordial Tower’s mana had thoroughly taken on a mist-like state already. This was an exceedingly rare mana environment, even on the main continent. Meanwhile, any location with such a mana environment would be one that even God-ranked experts would seek to live in.

However, the shock Liu Wusheng and the others experienced reached a whole new level when they arrived on the tower’s newly-opened second floor.

This was because the mana environment inside the 100 miniature worlds on the second floor had already taken on a liquid state. While standing in these miniature worlds, even experts like Hidden Soul had experienced a feeling of omnipotence.

Learning Skills, Spells, combat techniques, and Mana Techniques had become as simple as child’s play in these miniature worlds. Even the learning difficulty of Silver Combat Techniques had decreased drastically, and it only took them a few tries before they could execute these combat techniques at a rudimentary level.

The effect of these miniature worlds was something even Shi Feng did not expect.

Silver Combat Techniques!

Any player who had managed to learn a Silver Combat Technique, even if their mastery over it was only at a rudimentary level, would become invincible among players of the same tier. If players thoroughly master a Silver Combat Technique, they could even transcend tiers.

In reality, the various superpowers of God’s Domain were in possession of many Silver Combat Techniques. However, the number of experts who had managed to actually learn how to use a Silver Combat Technique numbered incredibly few. This was also the case even in the Greater God’s Domain.

Simply put, the various superpowers and hegemonic powers did not lack Silver Combat Techniques. What they lacked were people capable of learning Silver Combat Techniques.

However, the Primordial Tower’s second-floor mana environment could reduce the difficulty of learning Silver Mana Techniques by tenfold or more. With such a drastically lowered learning difficulty, even second-floor experts could fully master Silver Combat Techniques, let alone third-floor God-ranked experts!

Of course, the effects of the second floor’s miniature worlds did not come for free.

The first-floor miniature worlds only cost 100 Magic Crystals per hour to maintain, yet the cost of operating the second-floor miniature worlds was 100 Mana Stones per hour...

Even if one could convert Magic Crystals to Mana Stones in the ideal 100:1 ratio, the cost of operating the second-floor miniature worlds would still be 100 times greater than that of the first-floor miniature worlds...

In addition, the cost of maintaining the Primordial Tower itself had also increased drastically. Originally, the tower’s maintenance only cost 1,000 Magic Crystals per day. Now, simply keeping the Primordial Tower active cost 1,000 Mana Stones per day...

It seems I’m going to have to start stocking up on Silver Combat Techniques from now on.

Shi Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw the situation on the Primordial Tower’s second floor.

The consumption of Mana Stones was still acceptable since he could refine Magic Crystals into Mana Stones with the Seven Luminaries Codex. Although the Asura Mercenary Alliance would probably have to expend all of its Magic Crystals to let many members learn Silver Combat Techniques, it was a worthwhile price to pay. Worst case scenario, the mercenary alliance would simply have to earn more Magic Crystals.

However, acquiring Silver Combat Techniques was going to be a challenge.

Silver Combat Techniques were incredibly valuable, each one as valuable as a Fragmented Legendary item. Moreover, the Legacy items holding Silver Combat Techniques would usually break after a few uses…

“The effects of the second floor’s miniature worlds are simply too frightening, Guild Leader Black Flame. I suggest we only allow contracted members of the Asura Mercenary Alliance to use them,” Liu Wusheng hurriedly said to Shi Feng after snapping out of his daze. “We should also raise the price and usage requirements of the first floor’s miniature worlds.”

Crimson Heart, Galaxy Past, and Zhuo Yalin also nodded in agreement.

The upgraded Primordial Tower was simply terrifying!

Just the changes to the first-floor miniature worlds would already be enough to attract the attention of countless powers, let alone the second-floor miniature worlds. After all, the first-floor miniature worlds’ mist-like mana could allow Refinement Realm experts to quickly master Bronze Combat Techniques and possibly even Advanced Bronze Combat Techniques.

It should be known that even peak experts had trouble mastering Advanced Bronze Combat Techniques. Meanwhile, peak experts who had mastered Advanced Bronze Combat Techniques could threaten even Domain Realm experts.

If a peak expert managed to master multiple Advanced Bronze Combat Techniques of various types, even defeating Domain Realm experts wouldn’t be out of the question.

Domain Realm experts!

Even in the Greater World, Domain Realm experts were not cabbages that could be found everywhere. They were existences inferior only to God-ranked experts.

“I do have such plans,” Shi Feng said, nodding. “Aside from the Primordial Tower, I also plan to tweak the city’s entrance fee. The standard entrance fee will be increased to 50 Silver per person, and teleportation fees must be paid in Magic Crystals.”

“Fifty Silver?” Blackie’s mouth widened when he heard Shi Feng’s words.

Because of the myriad worlds’ descent, competition in the Miniature Ancient World had become much more intense than before. As a result, even Refinement Realm experts could only earn around three or four Gold a day. If they were unlucky and failed to find any good equipment or rare materials, their daily earnings might even fall to just one Gold.

As for players beneath the Refinement Realm standard, they’d be fortunate if they could earn enough to break even with their daily expenditure.

Previously, when Abyssal Star City charged 20 Silver for its entrance fee, the average expert could still afford to enter the city. However, if the entrance fee were to be raised to 50 Silver, even Refinement Realm experts might hesitate to enter the city. After all, they’d be left with hardly any money after paying the city’s entrance fee, renting a hotel, repairing their equipment, and having a meal.
