Chapter 131 – Zero Wing’s Guild Residence

Hundred Flow City, Candlelight Hotel:

At Shi Feng’s command, Blackie promptly used a Return Scroll to teleport back to Hundred Flow City. Then, he hurried his way back to the Candlelight Hotel, not daring to delay for even a moment.

After entering the hotel, Blackie followed Shi Feng to the secret room located in the hotel’s basement. Then, after entering the secret room and making sure that nobody else was around, he finally couldn’t hold back his curiosity any longer as he asked, “Why did you call me back so urgently, Guild Leader? Where are we heading to?”

“To a city. You’ll know once we arrive,” Shi Feng said as he took out a Guild Transfer Scroll from his bag. Then, he handed the scroll to Blackie and continued, “Take this and use it.”

“A Guild Transfer Scroll?!” Blackie’s eyes widened in shock when he saw the magic scroll Shi Feng offered him. “Guild Leader, we have a Guild Residence now?!”

A Guild Transfer Scroll was similar to a Return Scroll. However, instead of teleporting players to a city’s Teleportation Hall, it teleported players to the Guild Residence linked to it instead. The Transfer Scrolls could also only be used by the members of the Guild that produced them.

Since Shi Feng was giving him a Transfer Scroll, it meant that Zero Wing now possessed its own Guild Residence!

“Mhm. We did acquire one some time ago, but I kept it a secret from you guys because of reasons,” Shi Feng said, nodding. Then, he took out another Transfer Scroll for himself and said, “Alright, let’s quickly head over. I have many things I need you to do once we head over there.”

“Okay!” Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Blackie promptly activated his Transfer Scroll.

A Guild Residence was something that almost every Guild player would’ve come across. Any Guild with sufficient strength would have their own Guild Residence. Or, more specifically, only after gaining a Guild Residence would a Guild be recognized as such officially.

Meanwhile, a Guild Residence granted many benefits to a Guild’s members, and it was of significant help to the development of a Guild.

When Blackie opened his eyes again, he found that he had arrived inside an ancient-looking city. Many of the buildings in the city also looked somewhat dilapidated. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This Mana... It’s so dense!

Shortly after arriving in the Abyssal Star Ancient City, Blackie quickly realized its uniqueness. Then, when he focused on perceiving his surrounding environment, he couldn’t help but grow even more shocked.

Not only is the Mana here much denser than Hundred Flow City’s, but its purification properties are also many times greater!

Before meeting up with Shi Feng, Blackie had been grinding in the New Moon Forest, and his body had accumulated a significant amount of foreign energy as a result. Normally, if he rested in Hundred Flow City or any other NPC City, he would’ve needed an hour to get rid of this amount of foreign energy.

However, upon arriving in the Abyssal Star Ancient City, he discovered that the rate at which the foreign energy in his body disappeared had increased drastically.

Ten minutes!

At most, it would take ten minutes for all of the foreign energy in his body to disappear! The purification rate here was several times faster than any NPC City!

However, this wasn’t the end of Blackie’s surprise. A moment later, he quickly discovered an even more surprising matter.

The map!

According to his system map, the recommended level for his current area was Level 115 to Level 120!

In the current Miniature Ancient World, this was a map that no player could grind in. Moreover, Misty Canyon that the city was located in was only one map away from the Boundary River...

Noticing the dumbfounded look on Blackie’s face, Shi Feng smiled and asked, “How is it? Not a bad place, right?”

Blackie couldn’t help but be rendered speechless when he heard Shi Feng’s words.

This bastard was blatantly showing off!

How was this just “not bad?” The value of this place was off the charts!

Zero Wing would have a humongous advantage over the other powers if it had access to this city. Setting aside the city’s excellent geographical location, just the city’s purification ability was already more than enough to put it above any NPC City in the Miniature Ancient World.

If Zero Wing’s members could use this city as their base of operations, their leveling speed would be twice as fast as other players at the very minimum. Not to mention, the city itself was surrounded by Level 115-plus monsters. It wouldn’t take more than a few minutes of travel for players to reach a grinding spot. In comparison, players operating from Hundred Flow City would need to travel several hours before they could reach a suitable grinding spot.

While Shi Feng was giving Blackie a general introduction of the Abyssal Star Ancient City, a lithe figure suddenly appeared before them. Meanwhile, this lithe figure was none other than Hidden Soul.

“How is recruitment coming along on your side?” Shi Feng asked when he saw Hidden Soul suddenly appearing before him.

The main reason Shi Feng had left Abyssal Star City under Hidden Soul’s control was to get her to recruit mercenary players for him. Then, they would use these mercenaries to rapidly develop and defend the city.

“I’ve recruited a batch already,” Hidden Soul said. Then, sighing through her mask, she continued, “But I’m afraid it’ll be tough to convince the remainder. At the very least, it’s unlikely that they will join right now.”

“Are they not interested in the city?” Shi Feng asked curiously. He found it hard to believe that any expert could resist the Abyssal Star Ancient City’s temptation.

“It’s not that they’re not interested. It’s just that they don’t believe me...” Hidden Soul said with a bitter smile. “However, considering that none of them are willing to join or sign a confidentiality contract, it’s too big of a risk to reveal anything to them.”

The Abyssal Star Ancient City was too magical. It was especially so for the ancient tower in the middle of the city. It was essentially a holy land for players to learn the operating principles of Mana. They’d be inviting disaster for themselves if they recklessly revealed the ancient tower’s secrets to others without having the necessary strength to protect it.

Hence, while trying to recruit her acquaintances, she would only vaguely say that the city was an excellent place to improve one’s combat standards. Only after these people had agreed to join and signed a confidentiality contract would she share the tower’s secrets with them.

After thinking it over, Shi Feng asked, “How many people are we talking about? What are their standards?”

Hidden Soul raised a finger in response.

“Ten? Or a hundred?” Shi Feng asked in confusion.

Hidden Soul rolled her eyes when she heard Shi Feng’s question. Then, in a contemptuous tone, she said, “It’s one thousand! Out of these one thousand players, even the weakest is a Half-step Refinement Ream expert, and over half of them are Refinement Realm experts or above. There are also over twenty Void Realm experts and four Domain Realm experts.”

“That many? How did you find all these people?” Shi Feng was honestly shocked when he heard Hidden Soul’s answer.

Originally, Shi Feng thought that Hidden Soul could, at most, recruit a dozen or so Void Realm experts. Then, they could get these Void Realm experts to introduce their acquaintances to join the mercenary alliance. The best-case scenario would be that they managed to recruit a few hundred experts before the city’s opening. In the current state of the Miniature Ancient World, this could already be considered a relatively sizable force.

Meanwhile, Blackie couldn’t help but be dumbfounded by Hidden Soul’s words.

Over 500 Refinement Realm experts!

Even first-rate Guilds couldn’t field so many Refinement Realm experts. In the Miniature Ancient World, this was a force that only the various superpowers could take out.

“Don’t ask,” Hidden Soul said as she looked at Shi Feng. “The only thing I can say is that if I can open this place for others to visit, I’ll be able to recruit even more experts. However, if I have to operate without exposing this city’s existence, it’d be difficult for the mercenary alliance to take shape in just ten days.”

Seeing the anxious look on Hidden Soul’s face, Shi Feng chuckled and said, “Don’t worry. You can start sharing some of Abyssal Star City’s information with those people from today onwards.”

“Aren’t you worried that the various superpowers will surround this place once it gets exposed?” Hidden Soul asked as she looked at Shi Feng in surprise.

If the Abyssal Star Ancient City’s secrets got out, she did not doubt that the various superpowers would band together to attack this place. Meanwhile, with the city’s current defenses, the city would fall instantly.
