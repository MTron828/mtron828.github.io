Chapter 2606 – There Are Many Who Are Stronger Than Me Sinful Flame’s question shocked every member of the audience.

“What? Sinful Flame is actually eager to fight Silent Wonder?”

“He hadn’t seemed very interested in when he had expected to face Solitary Frost, yet he looks like he’s looking forward to the fight with Silent Wonder? Just how strong is she to get a reaction like this from him?”

“Could Sinful Flame intend to learn more about his Mana Body by fighting Silent Wonder ?”

The man’s sudden suggestion took everyone by surprise. Although Silent Wonder’s combat power had been astonishing, her combat standards were significantly weaker than Solitary Frost’s, not to mention Sinful Flame. The only advantage she had was her fully unlocked Mana Body.

That advantage was also the only reason anyone could think of that would pull such a reaction from Sinful Flame.

Even now, no one knew how many experts with fully unlocked Mana Bodies the various superpowers had, if any. Most of the superpowers’ Tier 3 experts hadn’t even begun to unlock their Mana Bodies. Of course, one might make some progress if they fought a player who had unlocked their Mana Body’s full potential.

“What is Sinful Flame thinking?! He’s challenging a junior?!” Duan Hanshan could only glare at Sinful Flame, furious over the man’s spontaneous act.

Silent Wonder’s victory over Solitary Frost had already boosted the Long Family’s prestige. The outcome practically ensured the family would retain its right to rule over Azure. By challenging Silent Wonder, Sinful Flame would only elevate the Long Family’s reputation further. This would definitely drive many of the Guild’s neutral Elders and Grand Elders to the Long Family’s side.

Meanwhile, Yan Xiaoqian stared from a nearby stage, similarly stunned.

“How did things turn out like this?”

When it combat, Yan Xiaoqian had always been more talented than Silent Wonder. After training with Violet Sword, she had even grown beyond seeing Silent Wonder as a serious opponent.

However, it turned out that she had been seriously overestimating her abilities. Not only was Silent Wonder much stronger than her, but one of Azure’s old legendary individuals also wanted to challenge the Elementalist.

This won’t do! I must stop him! Otherwise, the Long Family will become unstoppable in Azure!” Duan Hanshan snarled, quickly contacting the competition’s deputy referee.

Just as the deputy referee, an Elder working under the Duan Family, was about to interfere, the spectators broke into cheers.

“You have my support, Sinful Flame! Stop wasting time and get this started!”

“While I wouldn’t have minded watching Solitary Frost face Sinful Flame, seeing the old man fight an expert with a fully unlocked Mana Body will be awesome.”

This is beyond ‘awesome!’ This will go down in God’s Domain’s history as a classic match! We’ll get to see them pit power against technique!”

After their momentary shock over Sinful Flame’s proposal, the various spectating powers’ members fervently voiced their support for his decision. Many people even began to shout, demanding Sinful Flame begin his match against Silent Wonder immediately.

“Good! Since the audience approves, what of our various Elders?” Sinful Flame asked, turning to address the various shareholder families’ Elders and Grand Elders, who were in the midst of trying to stop him.

The audience followed his gaze, staring at the Elders and Grand Elders, silencing them into complacency. If they dared to refuse Sinful Flame, they’d have to answer to everyone in the arena.

“Damn it! Sinful Flame is insane!” Duan Hanshan turned ashen when he heard Sinful Flame’s nonchalant question.

“Forget it. Let them fight,” a white-haired old man in black robes said as he approached Duan Hanshan. “This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, in any case. Sinful Flame might’ve raised that little girl’s standing, but if he kills her instantly, all of the glory the Long Family just gained will be forgotten.”

Realizing the old man was right, Duan Hanshan and the various families’ Grand Elders stopped trying to object.

“Since Elder Flame and the audience are so eager, this will be simple,” Duan Hanshan said after calming down. He then looked at Sinful Flame and said, “However, we need Wonder’s agreement first. She just finished a match, and I’m afraid fighting a senior such as yourself so soon after...”

Sinful Flame nodded in response. His goal was very simple; he wanted to fight Silent Wonder. Some things could only be experienced first-hand, after all. He wanted to face the girl at her peak.

However, before Sinful Flame could speak up, a crisp voice interrupted him.

“I’m fine. Besides, I’d actually enjoy a proper fight against Elder Flame to test the extent of my development,” Silent Wonder said.

Long Wushang, who watched from the stands, began to grow nervous.

“Why is this girl so foolish?! That Old Ice Demon is clearly provoking her!” Anxiously, Long Wushang said, “This won’t do! I need to warn her!”

Even if the Elders gave Silent Wonder some time to recuperate, it wouldn’t be long, and even if she recovered all of the Stamina and Mana she had used during the prior match, her Concentration couldn’t recover that quickly. In a battle between high-caliber experts, Concentration was more important than anything. Without her full Concentration, this match might end as quickly as it began.

If that happened, the glory Silent Wonder had earned for her family with her last victory would vanish.

Long Wushang didn’t have enough time to contact Silent Wonder before Sinful Flame returned his attention to the young woman, however.

“Girl, while your fight with Solitary Frost was short, you expended a considerable amount of your Concentration. I wish to fight you at your peak. I don’t want to fight just for the sake of winning. I won’t fight you in such a state. You best take some time to rest,” Sinful Flame calmly said.

“Please, rest assured, Elder Flame. My match with Solitary Frost hadn’t cost much effort. I don’t need to rest,” Silent Wonder definitively replied.

Meanwhile, Solitary Frost, who had just resurrected below the stage, nearly fainted from rage.

How arrogant!

Silent Wonder was far too cocky!

Even the spectating crowd seemed displeased with Silent Wonder’s comment. While her match with Solitary Frost hadn’t lasted long, it had been a soul-stirring battle, yet Silent Wonder spoke as if she hadn’t given it her all.

“While it’s good to be confident, Wonder, I don’t want to hear any excuses when you lose too quickly,” Duan Hanshan warned her softly.

You worry too much, Elder Hanshan. A loss is a loss. I won’t offer any excuses. Moreover, I haven’t had enough training. There are many people in the Guild who are stronger than me, even though we’re the same age, so defeat wouldn’t be unusual for me,” Silent Wonder said.

With her statement hanging in the air, the entire arena fell silent.

“Silent Wonder is so already strong, yet she’s saying that Zero Wing has members that are even stronger and around the same age?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“A boast! She must be boasting! The various Super Guilds don’t even have many players that can rival Solitary Frost, much less Silent Wonder!”

“That’s right. Zero Wing might be quite famous in the east, but it shouldn’t be able to nurture talents as well as Super Guilds.”

Azure’s various shareholder families refused to believe Silent Wonder’s claim, glaring contemptuously at her.

“Since that is the case, I have a suggestion. Seeing as Wonder’s Concentration hasn’t fully recovered, why don’t we send one of Zero Wing’s young talents in her place? I’m sure Elder Flame will still benefit, and didn’t she just say that her Guild has plenty of youngsters that are even stronger than her?” Duan Hanshan suggested, sneering at Silent Wonder.
