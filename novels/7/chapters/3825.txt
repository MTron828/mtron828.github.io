Chapter 900 – Times Have Changed

Central Plaza, Advanced Tent:

“Guild Leader Black Flame, is it okay to exclude those two powers?” Red Frost asked Shi Feng quietly, worried about the other party’s decision.

Red Frost knew that Shi Feng had chosen to exclude the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty primarily for her and Holy Dragon Spear’s sake.

However, the partnership regarding the Flame Dragon God’s Nest was of utmost importance. If the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty were to harass Zero Wing secretly, Zero Wing would have trouble coping. After all, she knew that Zero Wing’s actual circumstances were nowhere near as optimistic as the various pseudo-apex powers were led to believe. It didn’t actually have the strength to stand as equals with a power like Dragon’s Crown.

Furthermore, the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty both knew the location of the Eternal Realm’s entrance. They could easily enter the Eternal Realm to strike at the heart of Zero Wing’s development.

“Don’t worry. Even if they enter the Eternal Realm, they can’t do anything to Zero Wing,” Shi Feng said nonchalantly after sitting down.

The Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty were indeed much stronger than the current Zero Wing. However, what Red Frost didn’t know was that Zero Wing’s partnership with Dragon’s Crown wasn’t an act. Zero Wing had indeed established deep ties with Dragon’s Crown. Should Zero Wing come into real trouble, Dragon’s Crown would intervene.

Not to mention, there was the Dragon-Hunting Artillery Design he obtained from the remnant primordial world. So long as Zero Wing constructed a few in Shadowring Town, not even the Holy Race’s royal powers could threaten the town, let alone the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty. Additionally, once Zero Wing stabilized its control over the Tower of the Abyss and the Flame Dragon God’s Nest, it would not lack experts to command. Even surpassing the Holy Race’s royal powers would be possible.

Now, all Zero Wing needed to do was occupy the Flame Dragon God’s Nest successfully.

“Just in case, once this incident is over, I will lead Holy Dragon Spear’s main force to stabilize the route to the Eternal Realm. That way, Holy Dragon Spear will have an easier time reinforcing Zero Wing, while Zero Wing’s members can access the Flame Dragon God’s Nest more conveniently,” Red Frost said. When she saw that Shi Feng was willing to help her and Holy Dragon Spear to such an extent, she made up her mind to throw Holy Dragon Spear’s support behind Zero Wing.

“Okay. I’ll leave the passage to you,” Shi Feng said, smiling when Red Frost took the initiative to help.

If Holy Dragon Spear could establish a stable route between the Eternal Realm and the Greater God’s Domain, it would be a big help to Zero Wing. Although he could transport players in and out of the Eternal Realm with the Abyss Workshop Certification’s World-Breaking Teleportation, the number of players he could transport was limited. It’d be impossible for him to let Zero Wing’s hundreds of thousands of members enter and grind in the Flame Dragon God’s Nest en masse.

If Zero Wing could secure a stable way out of the Eternal Realm, it could send thousands, or even tens of thousands, of members to grind in the Flame Dragon God’s Nest at a time. This would undoubtedly accelerate Zero Wing’s growth by a large margin.

As Shi Feng and Red Frost conversed, the various pseudo-apex powers’ representatives sat around the table and quietly stared at the two.

“South Lake, Holy Dragon Spear’s luck truly leaves me speechless,” Tarnished Wind said, feeling a little envious of Holy Dragon Spear when he saw Red Frost sharing a rather close relationship with Shi Feng. “First, you got an expert like Red Frost. Now, you even managed to latch on to Zero Wing.”

“It’s a fluke. It’s all a fluke,” South Lake said modestly. Inwardly, though, he was all smiles.

“What happened to the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty is a shame, though. If not for Ember Dragon, they could have also had a share of the secret land,” Tarnished Wind sighed.

The other representatives nodded in agreement with Tarnished Wind’s comment.

The grudge between Ember Dragon and Red Frost wasn’t much of a secret in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Originally, everyone thought that Red Frost would fade into obscurity after her downfall. Nobody had expected her to find a powerful patron like Zero Wing. Now, the tides had turned, and the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty would eventually fall to the bottom ranks of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary because of their inability to participate in the partnership this time.

“Since everyone is here, I will get straight to the point,” Shi Feng stated when he saw that the various pseudo-apex powers’ representatives had quieted down. “Firstly, I would like to clarify that the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key is already in Zero Wing’s possession. I’m sure everyone here knows about the Access Key’s effects, so I won’t go into detail about them. Secondly, due to a lack of manpower in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, Zero Wing will need everyone here to cooperate in defending the secret land.

“Of course, Zero Wing won’t let your efforts be in vain. In exchange for guarding the secret land with all your might, Zero Wing can promise entry for your members at a fee of half their income in the secret land and ten bottles of Life Potion per day.”

Following Shi Feng’s words, silence enveloped the tent again as everyone stared at him in disbelief. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

After a while, Tarnished Wind raised his hand tentatively and asked, “Guild Leader Black Flame, are you sure this is your only condition?”

At this time, South Lake, Apocalypse, and even Red Frost couldn’t help but doubt Shi Feng’s words.

In the Greater God’s Domain, powers that occupied Level 230 secret lands or below typically charged their allied members exorbitant fees to grind in their Taboo Secret Lands. Some even required payment of a piece of Level 230 Taboo Legendary Equipment or a Fragmented Divine Artifact per player or party. As for the loot obtained in the secret land, it was standard practice for powers to collect everything their allied members obtained. After all, each secret land was limited in resources.

Yet, Shi Feng only charged a fee of ten Life Potions per person per day. Moreover, he only asked for half of their harvest in the secret land. He was basically letting them in for free.

Although the value of Life Potions had skyrocketed due to the major system update, it was still nothing compared to being able to level up to Level 240 quickly. Many powers would be willing to pay a fee of twenty or thirty bottles of Life Potion a day, let alone ten.

“Of course. If you are fine with this condition, we can establish a God’s Domain Contract for the partnership immediately,” Shi Feng replied, smiling.

The Flame Dragon God’s Nest was certainly valuable. By relying on Dragon’s Crown’s banner, Zero Wing could also monopolize the secret land’s harvests if it wanted to. However, Life Potions were much more useful to the current Zero Wing than the secret land’s harvests. After all, unlike the various pseudo-apex powers, Zero Wing did not have many Life Potion manufacturing facilities and connections that could handle the needs of millions, or even tens of millions, of members.

Thus, Zero Wing needed to stock up on Life Potions to continue growing. Otherwise, if the Guild were to engage in an all-out war with any power, its operations would quickly get crippled. Even if Zero Wing had a stable supply of weapons and equipment, if its members couldn’t quickly recover their mental strength, they wouldn’t be able to keep fighting. Moving forward, the stockpiling of mental strength recovery potions was also an essential step for powers in God’s Domain when preparing to wage war against other powers.
