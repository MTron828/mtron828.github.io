Chapter 178 – Hypersensitivity

As soon as Echoing Judgment finished asking his question, the other Purple Light members promptly looked at Shi Feng’s team, their eyes filled with excitement and desire. Even Wordless Ember and Sleeping Quicksand wore looks of interest on their faces. Meanwhile, Shi Feng and the others couldn’t help but be surprised and confused by this situation.

“Are you perhaps not from the Dark Sanctuary?” Echoing Judgment asked, feeling a little confused when he saw Shi Feng’s team remaining silent.

Although the levels of Shi Feng’s team members were somewhat low, this was a normal situation in the Stratified Abyssal Realm. After all, it was incredibly easy for players to meet death out in the fields. Moreover, leveling up became absurdly challenging after Level 110, each subsequent level-up requiring several times the EXP of the previous level-up. Depending on a player’s class, the increase in EXP requirement could even reach tenfold. Yet, each death would cost players to lose one entire level...

Meanwhile, if Shi Feng’s team truly came from the Dark Sanctuary, it was completely normal for them to suffer multiple deaths in their process of completing the exit trial. So, it was understandable that their levels were so low. However, if Shi Feng’s team wasn’t from the Dark Sanctuary, it’d be strange why they were so low-leveled despite having such great strength.

“You’ve guessed correctly. We are indeed from the Dark Sanctuary,” Shi Feng said without breaking his composure even in the slightest. “We had to go through a lot of trouble to come out here, and our goal this time is to find some long-term partners.”

Shi Feng had heard about the Dark Sanctuary located in the Stratified Abyssal Realm inhabited by Ancient Gods. He even knew about some of the Dark Sanctuary’s secrets.

Although he could also lie that they were players from another city, they didn’t have much knowledge regarding the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s current state of affairs. If they pretended to be from another city, their act would get exposed very easily.

Of course, there was also the option of being truthful and saying they came from outside the Stratified Abyssal Realm. However, if they did that, it would put them in a passive state.

This was because the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s native players knew that players from outside the Stratified Abyssal Realm were pushovers. Regardless of how powerful an organization these outsiders came from, none of these outside organizations could set foot into the Stratified Abyssal Realm.

Moreover, native players also knew that outsiders needed to go through a lot of trouble to enter the Stratified Abyssal Realm. This meant that outsiders didn’t really have much to offer.

To make matters worse, many outside powers had access to the Stratified Abyssal Realm. It was just that each power could only send a very small number of players into the Stratified Abyssal Realm. This meant that native powers would have no lack of outside powers to partner with. So, the native powers would typically squeeze outside powers for everything they’ve got.

However, it was a different story for the Dark Sanctuary.

The Dark Sanctuary was located in the Stratified Abyssal Realm, and it was a place countless players in the Stratified Abyssal Realm sought to enter. It was just that the various powers were currently stuck outside the Dark Sanctuary. Even so, it was only a matter of time before the various powers got into the Dark Sanctuary. Meanwhile, to ensure their entry into the Dark Sanctuary went smoothly, the various powers based outside the Dark Sanctuary strongly revered and desired to partner with the Dark Sanctuary’s local powers.

When Crimson Heart, Blood Hammer, and the others heard Shi Feng’s words, they couldn’t help but look at him in astonishment. They didn’t think that Shi Feng would dare tell such a lie. Was he not afraid of getting exposed?

However, Echoing Judgment and the other Purple Light members simply took Shi Feng’s words at face value.

It’s no wonder he can exhibit destructive power rivaling Limit Breakers. The Dark Sanctuary truly is an extraordinary place. I wonder when we’ll be able to gather twenty certificates? Wordless Ember thought to himself in excitement.

It was the dream of every player in the Stratified Abyssal Realm to become a Limit Breaker and leave this world. After all, only by becoming a Limit Breaker could they reach the rumored place in the real world, acquire much longer lifespans and youth, obtain their own city, and set foot into the true Upper World. They wouldn’t have to constantly worry about living space and food like they were now.

“You’re finding partners?” Echoing Judgment’s smile grew even brighter when he heard Shi Feng’s words. “May I know if you are willing to partner with the Purple Light Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Black Flame? We are willing to show you our absolute sincerity!”

“Partner with you?” Shi Feng simply revealed a faint smile as he looked at Echoing Judgment. “May I know what you can offer us? You should know that there aren’t many things that aren’t available in the Dark Sanctuary.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Yes, I am aware of that. However, Slumber City’s local specialty, the Hypersensitivity Potion, is unique in the entire Stratified Abyssal Realm. I’m certain this thing will be of great help to you,” Echoing Judgment said, smiling as he took out twenty dark-blue potions and handed them to Shi Feng. “You can check the description yourself if you don’t believe me. You can also take these twenty Hypersensitivity Potions as thanks for helping us.”

“Commander, aren’t you giving away too many...” Wordless Ember whispered to Echoing Judgment.

The Hypersensitivity Potion was Slumber City’s local specialty. Not only could it double players’ EXP gain, but it could also put players into a Hypersensitive state. When training under the Hypersensitive state, players could achieve improvements much more quickly than usual. Moreover, the potion lasted 12 hours and a Cooldown of only two natural days.

The Hypersensitivity Potion was also the main reason Slumber City’s experts were stronger and more numerous than most other cities.

However, the Hypersensitivity Potion had an incredibly low production volume, so even powers based in Slumber City could only acquire a very small amount. Meanwhile, Purple Light could only obtain around 100 bottles each month.

“No, this is Purple Light’s show of sincerity! Moreover, it is thanks to Mr. Black Flame’s team that we managed to protect our Dark Crystals!” Echoing Judgment said.

Their caravan carried the Dark Crystals they had gone through great lengths to acquire from several cities. Meanwhile, these Dark Crystals would allow the Purple Light Chamber of Commerce to elevate its contribution in Slumber City to the next level. Compared to the benefits they stood to gain from these Dark Crystals, 20 Hypersensitivity Potions was a small price to pay.

Afterward, Echoing Judgment looked toward Shi Feng and asked, “May I know if you are interested in this Hypersensitivity Potion, Mr. Black Flame?”

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng and the others were done reading the Hypersensitivity Potion’s introduction, their hearts pounded rapidly. They never thought they would come across such a godly item in the Stratified Abyssal Realm.

There was no power in God’s Domain that would complain about having too many experts. It was especially true for experts at the Void Realm standard or above. Although there were many external items in God’s Domain that could be used to nurture experts, few could match the Hypersensitivity Potion in terms of efficiency.

If they could purchase the Hypersensitivity Potion in large quantities, the benefits they could gain would be no less than if they managed to recruit the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s experts into their respective Guilds.

“We’d be lying if we said we weren’t interested in this potion,” Shi Feng said as he put the Hypersensitivity Potions into his bag. Then, he looked toward Echoing Judgment and asked, “But how does Purple Light plan on trading this potion? Also, how many can you supply? Judging by this item’s efficacy, it should be quite difficult to obtain it, right? I’m guessing that its supply should also be very limited.”
