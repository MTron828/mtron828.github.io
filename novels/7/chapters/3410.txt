Chapter 485 – Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s Decision

“Boss, what exactly did Black Flame just do?” the young Shield Warrior standing next to Untold Paths couldn’t help but ask as his eyes focused on Abyss Water’s corpse. “Shouldn’t Thousand Blood Blades be an unstoppable attack? Also, how can Black Flame move so flexibly in the air? Shouldn’t it be impossible for players to fly on Dark Star?”

While saying so, the young Shield Warrior turned to look at Shi Feng, confusion filling his eyes as he watched the Swordsman sheath his weapon.

None of what just happened made sense to him.

Thousand Blood Blades was a well-known Skill in the Greater God’s Domain. When the two previous owners of the Scarlet Threads wielded the dagger set, they had slain countless experts using the Thousand Blood Blades Skill.

Although Abyss Water was currently limited to the Level 120, Tier 4 standard, any one of his several hundred scarlet threads could easily kill a Tier 4 player of the same level. Not to mention, with an expert like Abyss Water manipulating the scarlet threads, it should be utterly impossible for any Tier 4 player to evade the threads completely.

Even more astonishing was Shi Feng’s ability to move in the air. After all, it should be impossible for players to fly in Dark Star as it was a forced setting. At most, players could jump and stay suspended in the air for a brief moment.

Yet, Shi Feng had stayed in the air throughout the entire time he was dodging the scarlet threads and closing the distance on Abyss Water!

“Most likely, he has mastered a Gold Combat Technique! A Gold Body Technique at that!” Untold Paths said after a deep breath. “But I’ve never seen such a Gold Body Technique in the Guild’s archives before…”

“He’s a Golden Master?” The young Shield Warrior’s breathing became a little labored.

Anyone who mastered a Gold Combat Technique was known as a Golden Master and considered an apex existence in the Greater God’s Domain. Even apex powers would try their best to recruit Golden Masters as they were a source of great power. Golden Masters had also become a measure of strength for the various Realms to gauge the strength of an apex power, and the more Golden Masters an apex power possessed, the stronger it would be considered.

Meanwhile, among experts who had mastered Gold Combat Techniques, those who had mastered Gold Body Techniques were somewhat special. Firstly, Gold Body Techniques existed in scarce numbers, and so were the people who had mastered them. Secondly, experts who had mastered Gold Body Techniques were almost invincible against opponents of the same tier out in the fields. This was because they could run or fight whenever they wanted.

No wonder the higher-ups want to get in touch with him. With such strength, he can conquer and occupy territories in the Eternal Realm with ease. When Untold Paths deduced that Shi Feng might have mastered a Gold Body Technique, a new realization quickly dawned on him.

Although experts who had mastered Gold Body Techniques were not as useful as those who had mastered Offensive and Defensive Gold Combat Techniques in dungeon raids, they were extremely powerful in outdoor PvP situations and stronghold sieges.

Now that the Eternal Realm’s various powers still lacked access to their full capabilities, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that a Golden Master who had mastered a Gold Body Technique was nigh invincible in the Eternal Realm. Of course, it would be under the precondition that said Golden Master was going up against opponents of the same level, tier, and equipment standard.

While Untold Paths and the young Shield Warrior were quietly conversing among themselves, Xia Qingying, Invincible Swallow, and Xuanwu Chisha quickly came to their senses.

“You really know how to hide your cards, Vice President Xia. How did you even manage to find such an expert?” Invincible Swallow looked at Xia Qingying and couldn’t help but say.

A Golden Master who had mastered a Gold Body Technique ranking only 963rd on the Luminous Glory List? This might as well be the joke of the century.

At this time, even Xuanwu Chisha couldn’t help but admire Xia Qingying’s capabilities.

So long as a Golden Master reached Tier 6 and obtained sufficiently good weapons and equipment, their debut into the Divine Glory List was basically guaranteed. Moreover, they would have a very high ranking. Meanwhile, not even pseudo-apex powers would dare think of inviting such an expert to work for them. Yet, not only did Xia Qingying dare to do so, but she had even succeeded.

“Don’t spread this news,” Xia Qingying awkwardly reminded Invincible Swallow and Xuanwu Chisha.

Xia Qingying didn’t intend to correct Invincible Swallow’s and Xuanwu Chisha’s misunderstanding. This was because even she herself was surprised by this revelation. It should be known that Shi Feng was formerly an expert who could barely stay in the Miniature Ancient World’s God-ranked Expert List. Never could she have imagined such a person could have such terrifying strength.

“Naturally.” Invincible Swallow and Xuanwu Chisha nodded to express their understanding.

The current Green God Corporation was not united at heart. Many people were eyeing Xia Qingying’s position. In such a situation, Shi Feng would undoubtedly become one of Xia Qingying’s trump cards in the future.

…

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng killed Abyss Water, none of the other groups on the battlefield dared to pick a fight with Xia Qingying’s group of four, choosing only to fight among themselves.

Ultimately, Xia Qingying’s group won first place without suspense, while Untold Paths’ group won second. This outcome was completely different from what everyone expected at the beginning of the test, so the atmosphere in the whole arena turned incredibly tense.

“Xia Qingying is in big trouble. The Eternal Chamber of Commerce has gone out of its way to prepare an extra advanced partnership slot to win over Abyss Water. Yet, Xia Qingying’s group not only eliminated Abyss Water, but they even took an advanced membership slot for themselves. The Eternal Chamber of Commerce must be fuming over this matter right now.”

“They’re very bold; I’ll give them that. Interests come above everything else for the various powers in God’s Domain, and to defy the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s interests takes a lot of courage.”

“But isn’t that Swordsman named Black Flame suspected to have mastered a Gold Combat Technique? I doubt even the Eternal Chamber of Commerce would want to offend someone like him, right?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“You would think so, but that’s only the case for other powers. This is the Eternal Chamber of Commerce we are talking about. Not to mention Golden Masters, Eternal probably owns more than one Divine Artifact. Do you think it would be afraid of an expert who’s only suspected of having mastered a Gold Combat Technique?”

When the test results came out, the players on the spectator stand promptly engaged in a quiet discussion.

While it was true that the Eternal Chamber of Commerce was an apex power that took a somewhat aloof stance in the Greater God’s Domain, the organization was still subject to various interests. Even if the Eternal Chamber of Commerce didn’t take any drastic measures immediately out of consideration for its reputation, the apex power probably wouldn’t let Xia Qingying’s group have a good time on Dark Star later.

This was also something Xia Qingying was very concerned about.

The Twelve Sanctuaries predated the current Greater God’s Domain, and many myths and secrets are circulated within them. Some of these secrets were even tied to the mysterious Primordial Gods. Many upper-ranking hegemonic powers and cross-realm conglomerates desperately wished to gain a foothold in the Twelve Sanctuaries, but only a few could actually achieve this wish. Even for Tier 6 experts, entering the Twelve Sanctuaries was an extremely difficult task.

Now that her group had disrupted the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s plans, if the organization took the offense to heart, the consequences would be unbearable for her group.

However, after the test ended, the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s attitude surprised everyone.

Contrary to everyone’s expectations, the three Elders of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce wore friendly smiles as they awarded Xia Qingying the authority of an advanced partner. They even took the initiative to remind Xia Qingying that she was now qualified to visit the Dark Star Auction House’s 200th floor and beyond, which was where players could get in touch with the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s inner circles.

…

After the award ceremony…

“Elders, are we just going to let them go like this?” Wu Duanhen asked with a puzzled face as he looked at the three Elders who had just stepped down from the stage. “Xia Qingying’s group has eliminated Lord Abyss Water and even got a free advanced partnership. If we don’t do anything about this, Eternal will become a laughing stock for the various powers.

“Laughing stock? Who dares to laugh at us?” The leading Elder coldly said as he looked at Wu Duanhen. “And since when did you think you could represent the Eternal Chamber of Commerce? Also, why would you think the extra advanced partnership slot is for Abyss Water?”
