Chapter 356 - One Man Holding Out against Ten Thousand

“Big Brother Red, their HPs aren’t declining that rapidly. They should have started fighting not that long ago. Also, they’re only a short distance away from us. If we run back there right now, we might still be able to save them,” Flourishing Willow said hurriedly.

However, the moment Flourishing Willow finished speaking, one of the members on their transport team suddenly died.

“What?!”

Flourishing Willow looked at one of the HP bars on the list of team members in disbelief. The dark HP bar proved that this player was already dead. She was very clear on the strength of the team transporting the dropped items. They were all elites of the Star Alliance. Yet, just shortly after the battle started, one of these elites had already died. How could she not be shocked by this situation?

“It’s too late. At this point, we can only kill Black Flame to make up for our losses.” Red Feather shook his head. He then looked at Shi Feng, rage burning in his eyes.

In reality, Red Feather was not the only person present who was angry. The other Guilds were similarly enraged.

Shi Feng had so easily taken away the dropped items they had paid such a large price to obtain. This also meant that, at this moment, Shi Feng had obtained all the drops of the Mechanical Slayer. So, how could they not feel angry?

They had far underestimated Shi Feng’s ambitions. From the moment the Mechanical Slayer attacked the city, Shi Feng never had any intention of letting anyone obtain a share of the loot.

Now, they finally realized how naive they had been. They had lost the battle from the very beginning...

The battle between their transport teams and the members of Zero Wing had been going on for some time now. It would be too late even if they tried to rescue the transport teams. The only thing they could do now was to get rid of Shi Feng. In any case, the number of drops Shi Feng had on him was almost the same as the number of drops of the Guilds combined.

“Kill him! Kill him right this instant!”

“Black Flame, today will be your funeral!”

None of the Guilds present could care less anymore. All of them started charging at Shi Feng one after another, not caring whether or not Shi Feng had set up any traps for them.

However, when the various Guilds started charging at him, Shi Feng and the others of Zero Wing also retreated into the Teleportation Hall. Facing death with a smile, the various Guilds rushed into the building without a moment’s hesitation.

Seeing the large number of players swarming into the Teleportation Hall, Shi Feng said in the team chat, “Start!”

Blackie, who had been eagerly waiting for this moment, immediately cast Stars of Light.

The entrance and hallway of the Teleportation Hall was not very spacious, with a capacity of only around a hundred players or so. Meanwhile, the range of the Stars of Light just happened to completely cover this area.

One after another, stars of sacred light shot down from the sky, rocking the entire Teleportation Hall. Even with the preparations the Guilds made, the might of the Stars of Light was simply too overwhelming. Despite the healers at the rear trying their best to save their companions, Blackie’s Stars of Light destroyed even the MTs, who possessed the highest HP and Defense, in just two to three rounds.

After the duration of Stars of Light ended, many members of the various Guilds had died.

Shi Feng estimated the death toll for Blackie’s skill at over 500. At this moment, Blackie’s name looked more black than red. If not for the guards of White River City temporarily halting their management over the vicinity of the Teleportation Hall, the guards would have killed Blackie dozens of times by now.

Meanwhile, Blackie’s skill had thoroughly shocked the various Guilds.

The scene before them brought home to the crowd once more the importance of large-scale destruction spells. Even before their frontline players had a chance to clash with the enemy, their side had already suffered so many deaths...

This was just like the battlefields of ancient times when archers would already fire their bows before the two sides could even clash. In this case, however, since their side did not possess any archers, they would naturally suffer a one-sided beating. The only thing they could do in this situation was to endure and hope they survived.

Fortunately, large-scale destruction spells like this definitely had a very long Cooldown time. After all, if such powerful skills could be used constantly, would there even be a need for them to fight? They might as well stand still and await their deaths.

“Don’t be afraid! Charge! They should have used up their skills already!” Red Feather calmly shouted a reminder to everyone.

Following which, the members of the various Guilds charged at Shi Feng once more. In addition, the number of players that charged into the Teleportation Hall this time was even greater than before.

At this moment, the members of Zero Wing were also ready for battle.

“Just in time. Let’s see how powerful my newly improved skill is, then.”

At this moment, Shi Feng finally utilized the Seven Luminaries Ring and activated Firestorm. The Level 5 Firestorm was even more powerful than Blackie’s Stars of Light.

Towering flames brightly illuminated the entire Teleportation Hall. The temperature inside the building rose by tens of degrees as well. Numerous butterflies formed by flames fluttered gracefully around the Teleportation Hall, creating a beautiful scene to behold. However, all the players touched by these flame butterflies instantly combusted, their bodies turning into ash shortly after. Before the healers standing at the back could react, countless players had already died. The number of deaths caused by Shi Feng’s Firestorm far surpassed Blackie’s Stars of Light.

“Why do they still possess large-scale destruction spells?”

The various Guilds present had long since known about Blackie’s Stars of Light. After all, the scene of Blackie using this skill had appeared on video recordings many times by now. Since they had been prepared for it, they had not sent their full force in the initial charge.

For their second charge, however, they had held nothing back.

Yet, now, Zero Wing had revealed a second, and even more powerful, large-scale destruction spell. This situation greatly confused everyone. Just where did Zero Wing manage to obtain so many large-scale destruction spells?

Just having one of such spells was already a near-impossible feat. At this stage of the game, not even first-rate Guilds possessed a single one of such powerful spells. Yet, Zero Wing actually laid claim to two.

After Firestorm ended, the members of the various Guilds turned silent. No longer did anybody dare to rush forward.

After seeing this second large-scale destruction spell unleashed, the various Guilds present started hesitating. Instead of letting their blood rush to their heads, they started calmly observing the situation.

Looking at Shi Feng’s leisurely behavior as he stood inside the Teleportation Hall, they could not help but wonder whether Shi Feng still had another card hidden up his sleeves. From beginning to end, Shi Feng had never considered the army before him a threat. The expression Shi Feng had, in particular, made it seem as if everything was under his control.

If there were still members among Zero Wing capable of using large-scale destruction spells, wouldn’t they just be seeking their own deaths by recklessly charging ahead?

Before arriving at the Teleportation Hall, the various Guilds present had already suffered immense losses. Now, the two spells they suffered were like fuel added to the fire. If they were to take another one or two of such blows, just how were they supposed to cope with the losses?

“Why aren’t you guys charging?! It is impossible for Zero Wing to possess any more of such large-scale destruction spells!” Red Feather shouted anxiously as he looked at the various Guilds.

“Brother Red Feather, it’s not that we are unwilling to charge. However, our manpower is limited. What if they reveal another large-scale destruction spell? My Guild can’t hope to endure another blow like that.”

“Brother Red Feather, why don’t you lead the charge for us? If Zero Wing has indeed run out of large-scale destruction spells, we’ll then follow you in your charge.”

Red Feather nearly spat out a mouthful of blood at these Guild Leaders when he heard their words.

He had brought only a small number of members with him on this expedition to White River City. After going through the two great wars earlier, he had lost over half the members he had brought. Just moments ago, Zero Wing had also killed his transport team. In the end, the only thing he gained from this trip was losses! If he were to send his few remaining members at Zero Wing right now, wouldn’t he just be seeking his own death?

At this time, the various Guild Leaders present were also unwilling to let their own subordinates act as cannon fodder. Every death was a loss of money to them. As of this moment, they had yet to gain a single thing, so how would they be willing to continue throwing lives away?

Previously, they had gotten caught in Shi Feng’s plots one after another. Now, Zero Wing’s performance had even surpassed their expectations. After suffering successive blows, they were truly afraid now.

“What? Not gonna charge at us anymore? If you guys aren’t coming, then we’ll be leaving.” Shi Feng stood at the stairs of the Teleportation Hall, looking at the various Guilds that did not dare to enter the building.

The calm and easygoing smile Shi Feng wore made it impossible for anyone to guess at his thoughts.

Looking at Shi Feng’s relaxed and indifferent attitude, as well as the low-grade provocation he used, the various Guilds present became even more certain that Shi Feng still possessed a hidden trump card. As long as they dared to charge at him, what awaited them would be an even greater loss.

At this moment, the independent players observing from afar were completely stupefied by this scene.

An army of tens of thousand!

Shi Feng actually intimidated such a force all by himself, such that they didn’t dare to set even a single foot inside the Teleportation Hall.

This scene was truly one man holding out against ten thousand.

Before today, nobody present would have believed such a nonsensical feat was actually possible. Now, however, they believed it. After all, Shi Feng was the best proof.

It would be an honor to die to such a player!

After a stalemate of more than ten seconds, Red Feather suddenly stepped forward.

“Everyone, don’t be fooled by Black Flame! Do you think large-scale destruction spells can be obtained so easily? He is simply buying time! As long as we charge at him once more, the drops Black Flame obtained will be ours!” Red Feather did not believe that Shi Feng still possessed a third large-scale destruction spell. Shi Feng was definitely tricking them. Emphatically, Red Feather advised, “If anyone doesn’t believe me, then our Star Alliance will compensate you with five times the losses you will suffer!”
