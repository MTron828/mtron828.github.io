Chapter 3808 - 882 - Tier 7 Skill

“Heavens! What rank of a Flying Mount is that?!”

“Could it be a Legendary Flying Mount?”

“Crap! That’s a Sacred Dragon! That Flying Mount is a Tier 6 Sacred Dragon!”

…

The sudden appearance of the Frostflame Sacred Dragon sent the players in the airport into a frenzy.

Although Nightmare Holy City’s players primarily relied on Flying Mounts to get around, Flying Mounts were extremely rare in the city. Most first-rate teams only had Tier 4 Basic Extraordinary Flying Mounts; even the Holy Knights and the White Dragon Nation only had Tier 5 Advanced Extraordinary Flying Mounts. Nobody dared to dream of owning a Tier 6 Flying Mount, much less one that was a Sacred Dragon.

It should be known that the average Tier 6 Dragon was already considered invincible among opponents of the same level. Sacred Dragons possessed Bloodlines superior to those of ordinary Dragons. They were akin to Bosses among Dragons. A single Level 226, Tier 6 Sacred Dragon could likely defeat the Holy Knights and the White Dragon Nation combined. Nonetheless, such a frightening existence was someone’s Flying Mount. This was simply unbelievable.

The chosen ones of Dragon’s Crown were even more dumbfounded by this situation. Unlike the ignorant players of Nightmare Holy City, they had a much better understanding of the world they resided in. Thus, they knew the Tier 6 Frostflame Sacred Dragon was an existence that trumped even Legendary Flying Mounts.

Although Legendary Flying Mounts were rare in their world, they weren’t rare to the point of nonexistence. The two royal powers ruling the world had over a dozen Tier 6 Legendary Flying Mounts in total. However, none of those Legendary Flying Mounts could hold a candle to the Frostflame Sacred Dragon.

A Tier 6 Sacred Dragon? Could this be one of the legendary Divine Flying Mounts? 

As Purgatory Jade looked at the descending Frostflame Sacred Dragon, her curiosity about Shi Feng’s world grew.

Although Shi Feng’s party’s average level was pitiful, the party’s ownership of the Frostflame Sacred Dragon alone made it worth Dragon’s Crown befriending.

It should be known that the Frostflame Sacred Dragon was only Level 226. Yet, Purgatory Jade already felt threatened by it. Once it reached Level 240, who could be a match for Shi Feng in a one-on-one fight?

Besides Nightmare Holy City’s players and Dragon’s Crown’s members, Red Frost, who was familiar with Zero Wing and Shi Feng, was equally surprised by the Frostflame Sacred Dragon. She had no idea when Shi Feng had gotten his hands on such a Flying Mount. At the same time, she finally understood why Shi Feng had been leveling up so slowly despite grinding with them for the past few days. He had most likely shared the majority of the EXP he received with the Frostflame Sacred Dragon. Otherwise, he would have long since reached Level 220 or higher.

Amidst the surrounding players’ discussions, Shi Feng hopped onto the Frostflame Sacred Dragon’s back.

“Get on. With the Frostflame Sacred Dragon’s speed, we should reach the Taboo Boss in about five hours,” Shi Feng said to Dragon’s Crown’s members when he saw them getting ready to summon their respective Flying Mounts.

At Shi Feng’s invitation, many of Dragon’s Crown’s members excitedly hopped onto the Frostflame Sacred Dragon. When they felt the mana-nourishing effect of the Divine Flying Mount, their dissatisfaction with Shi Feng disappeared, and they now acknowledged him as their commander.

After all, although the Frostflame Sacred Dragon was only Level 226, its resilience was greater than even that of a Level 240 tank, and it was more than qualified to tank a Taboo Boss. With the Frostflame Sacred Dragon distracting the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss, the chances of the raid succeeding would increase greatly.

After a five-hour flight, Shi Feng’s team arrived at a mountain range in the Northern Badlands. A demonic mist enveloped the central area of the mountain range, the place where the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss resided. Although many players had entered the mist in the past, few ever made it out alive.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, the Taboo Boss is inside that mist,” Kowloon Demon said, pointing at the demonic mist in the distance. “The mist is a product of the Northern Badlands’ unique environment. It devours the mana of any player within range. This mist is also why nobody has ever gotten a glimpse of the Taboo Boss’s true appearance. But because this mist is caused by the environment, its density varies from time to time. If we want to raid the Taboo Boss, we will have to wait until the mist’s density falls. Otherwise, we will have to raid it handicapped.”

As a native of Nightmare Holy City, Whirlwind Bulwark agreed with Kowloon Demon’s statement.

The Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss might be terrifyingly strong, but its strength wasn’t the only reason it was difficult to raid. The demonic mist that enveloped its sphere of activity also played a significant role. For this reason, all teams that challenged the Taboo Boss in the past had chosen to do so when the demonic mist was at its thinnest. If a team were to enter the demonic mist when it was dense, that team would have no chance of surviving.

“This demonic mist is indeed troublesome.” After surveying the area from the Frostflame Sacred Dragon’s back, Shi Feng found that the demonic mist covered a radius of hundreds of thousands of yards. It was definitely one of the major hurdles to raiding the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss. However, he quickly added, “But we don’t need to go inside. We just need to lure the Taboo Boss to us.”

“Lure it to us?” Kowloon Demon shook his head and chuckled when he heard Shi Feng’s solution. Then, he explained, “Guild Leader Black Flame, you might not know this, but the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss loves this demonic mist. Many teams have tried to lure it out, but none have succeeded. This is also why the teams that tried to raid the Taboo Boss all had to fight it inside the demonic mist.”

“It’s a pity the suppression of this world is too powerful. Otherwise, I could slowly chip away at this mist with my Tier 6 Large-scale Destruction Curses,” Heiser said, sighing.

The suppression that the remnant primordial world imposed on players was as powerful as that of the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury. This was also why players of Nightmare Holy City had to rely on low-tier Flying Mounts to fly, even after reaching Tier 6. In any other world, Tier 6 players could have easily flown at speeds nearing those of Tier 5 Flying Mounts.

“It’s not up to the Taboo Boss to decide whether it wants to come out,” Shi Feng suddenly said. Then, he raised his hand and cast the Abyssal Eye’s Dark Cluster Skill, one of the two Tier 7 Skills he possessed.

Before anyone could react, the sky above the Northern Badlands turned pitch-black. Then, all the mana in the map began converging in the sky, causing the mana-devouring demonic mist to thin out rapidly.

A moment later, Shi Feng brought his hand down toward the demonic mist.

Tier 7 Skill, Dark Cluster!

Boom!
