Chapter 2719 – Gentle Snow’s Sword

Above the competition venue, inside a VIP room...

“This is bad. Miracle’s Thousand Miles discovered Gentle Snow’s team,” Flourishing Willow said nervously as she stared at a dense forest on Island No. 3. “Gentle Snow will be in trouble. Thousand Miles’s team is a 1,000-man team.”

“The experts on Thousand Miles’s team are astonishing. I’m afraid there are at least a dozen peak experts and two apex experts.” Galaxy Past, the Star Alliance’s Guild Leader, also frowned when he saw this situation.

As a Guild of Star-Moon Kingdom, the Star Alliance had frequently clashed with Gentle Snow’s Ouroboros during the early stages of the game. In fact, Galaxy Past had even treated Gentle Snow as his rival. Hence, Galaxy Past paid close attention to Zero Wing in this competition.

This was especially so for his ex-rival, Gentle Snow. Galaxy Past had even set Gentle Snow as a priority target on the spectator’s interface. So long as she fought in a battle, he would be notified of it immediately.

“The gap between the two sides is too large.” Purple Eye, who was now a Level 117, Tier 3 Great Mage, shook her head and sighed, “If Gentle Snow were leading Zero Wing’s main force, she might still stand a chance. However, with her strength alone, there’s no way her team can win. Even escaping will be a problem.”

Although the Star Alliance had been in conflict with Ouroboros and even the current Zero Wing, as Guilds originating from Star-Moon Kingdom and peak experts from the same kingdom, Purple Eye still hoped to see Gentle Snow and Zero Wing perform well in this competition.

“Dammit. If only we could join the battle.”

The other Star Alliance upper echelon present also sighed and grumbled. They never thought that Gentle Snow’s team would be so unlucky as to encounter a 1,000-man team right off the bat.

“Miracle has started moving!” “Gentle Snow! Why haven’t you noticed them yet?!”

Flourishing Willow reflexively stood up in worry and pointed at Miracle’s members on the holographic projection.

A one-hundred-versus-one-thousand battle already placed Gentle Snow’s team in an overwhelming disadvantage. Moreover, Miracle’s team was even stuffed with experts, while Frost Heaven’s members were obviously no good. Even the strongest among them had reached only the Refinement Realm; most of them weren’t even at the Half-step Refinement Realm standard.

Let alone Miracle’s experts, even the Star Alliance’s main force could trounce these Tier 3 experts from Frost Heaven.

However, despite the Star Alliance’s members’ thoughts and shouts, Miracle’s experts had already sneaked within 100 yards of Gentle Snow’s team. For Tier 3 players, such a distance required only a few steps to cross. Gentle Snow’s team had no chance to flee now.

“Good! Magic team, start chanting!” Thousand Miles commanded after his team arrived within the critical range. He then turned to the two elderly men beside him and said, “Elder Roc, Elder Feather, I’ll leave Gentle Snow to you two. Do not let her get away.”

“Rest assured, Vice Guild Leader. Leave that young lady to these two old men,” Elder Roc, a white-bearded old man clad in black robes and armed with two pitch-black short swords, answered.

“If we take action, she won’t have a chance to escape,” Elder Feather, an old man with golden pupils, said, smiling. He wore dark-gray leather armor and carried a white-winged feather bow. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I am naturally confident in your abilities. Both of you are our Guild’s top-ranking ambushers. However, Gentle Snow isn’t an easy target, either. In terms of combat power, she rivals Domain Realm experts already. Killing her will definitely deal a huge blow to Zero Wing,” Thousand Miles said, smiling.

Thousand Miles felt reassured that Elder Roc and Elder Feather were taking action. After all, the two Elders could hold their ground even against a peerless expert if they worked together. This was why the Guild had let these two Elders join a 1,000-man team.

However, he did not wish to repeat his mistakes. He would use everything he had, even to deal with a minor problem.

When Thousand Miles finished speaking, the magical-class players in the team had also completed the incantations for their Spells.

“Vice Guild Leader, all preparations are done. We can make them disappear from the island at your command,” a Level 118, Tier 3 Great Mage reported quietly.

“Good!”

Thousand Miles did not doubt his subordinate’s words at all since the 20 magical-class players had jointly cast eight Destruction Spells. These powerful Spells would devastate even Level 120 Mythic monsters, let alone Tier 3 players.

The magical-class players on the team grew excited. After all, they rarely had an opportunity to use such high-caliber Spells. The Bosses in Dungeons normally wouldn’t give them a chance to cast such Spells. Only during siege battles would they have such an opportunity.

Now that they could use Gentle Snow’s team for target practice, they were naturally more than happy to do so.

Immediately, Thousand Miles turned to look at Gentle Snow’s team. “Huh?”

However, the instant Thousand Miles turned around, his entire body shuddered.

Before anyone noticed, Gentle Snow had already appeared before his team’s magical-class players. The Tier 3 Great Mage that reported to him was even laughing, wholly unaware of Gentle Snow’s arrival.

“Not good! We got discovered!” Thousand Miles shouted instinctively.

At this moment, Thousand Miles wasn’t the only person to have noticed Gentle Snow’s sudden appearance. The other Miracle members noticed her too. Only, their minds failed to react to the situation.

Gentle Snow, who had used Instant Flash to arrive before her ambushers, had no intention of giving her opponents time to react. She immediately swung the Glorious Will replica, which had already been upgraded to the Fragmented Legendary rank, at the Tier 3 Great Mage leading Miracle’s magical-class players.

Gentle Snow’s slash was straightforward, so fast that the Great Mage could only watch as her sword descended. He didn’t even have time to dodge using Instantaneous Movement.

The next moment, the Great Mage was cleaved in half, and his HP plummeted straight to zero.

What a quick slash!

Thousand Miles couldn’t help gasping when he saw his subordinate getting killed.

The Great Mage in question was a Void Realm expert. Normally, so long as his opponent made any movements, he would instantly sense his opponent’s intentions and react appropriately. Moreover, all magical-class players possessed Skills or Spells like Instantaneous Movement.

Hence, in order to finish the Great Mage in one hit, even Domain Realm experts had to launch an attack without the Great Mage’s awareness of the situation.

However, despite Gentle Snow executing an attack right before the Great Mage’s eyes, the latter had actually failed to respond to it.

“Little girl, you are really courageous! Aren’t you afraid of making a one-way trip?” Elder Feather sneered as he looked at Gentle Snow. However, despite his confident words, he still observed Gentle Snow cautiously. He then privately whispered to Elder Roc, “It seems this little girl is much stronger than we imagined, Old Roc! I’ll try to create an opportunity for you in a moment!”

“Leave it to me.” The black-clad Elder Roc also understood that the woman before them shouldn’t be underestimated. Immediately, the short swords he held behind his back bloomed with a pitch-black brilliance. As soon as there was an opening, he would use his strongest move to finish off Gentle Snow.

However, before Elder Feather and Elder Roc could make their move, Gentle Snow seemed to see through their intentions already.

Before the two elderly men realized it, 16 swords of light were flying at them, the abrupt attack catching them off guard. To make matters worse, they actually couldn’t perceive the presence of these 16 light swords.

“Dammit!”

Immediately, both Elder Feather and Elder Roc used their Lifesaving Skills simultaneously.

The next moment, a storm brewed around Elder Feather, who was a Tier 3 Ranger, the storm deflecting all attacks around him. As for Elder Roc, who was a Tier 3 Assassin, he executed bewildering footwork and instantly split into six identical copies of himself. It was impossible to tell the real one from the fakes.

After Elder Feather and Elder Roc, Thousand Miles was the quickest to react among the Miracle members present. He raised his Divine Skeleton Shield and dark-red battle axe and charged at Gentle Snow, leaving behind an afterimage.

Tier 3 Skill, Triple Purgatory Flash!

The next moment, Thousand Miles brandished his axe and summoned three black crescents that attacked Gentle Snow from three different directions. The attack was so fast that even Domain Realm experts had to focus all their attention on it if they wished to dodge or block it.

However, Thousand Miles did not see Gentle Snow paying any attention to him. As if he were only an ant by the roadside, she completely ignored his existence.

“Die!”

Feeling extremely humiliated by Gentle Snow’s attitude, Thousand Miles bellowed in anger. Simultaneously, the three black crescents’ power also strengthened slightly, enough to shatter space itself.

However, Thousand Miles quickly felt despair overwhelm him.

Even now, Gentle Snow still ignored him. She merely swung her greatsword at the crescent approaching her from the front. Immediately afterward, the black crescent deflected along the greatsword’s trajectory and smashed into the two other black crescents.

To Thousand Miles’s surprise, after the latter two crescents got struck, their courses actually deviated toward himself. How is this possible?!

Thousand Miles was dumbfounded. Although he wanted to repulse these two black crescents, his body simply couldn’t react in time.

Boom! Boom!

Two dull sounds appeared, and Thousand Miles stumbled two consecutive steps backward. Each step was accompanied by a significant loss of HP. By the end of the attack, two deep cuts had appeared on his armor, and his HP had fallen below 50%.

Just when Thousand Miles thought he could catch a breather, he noticed that his surroundings were surprisingly quiet.

“You guys... What happened?”

Thousand Miles couldn’t help his confusion when he saw his teammates’ shocked expressions.

However, before Thousand Miles could take in the situation, another black crescent flew across his neck and left behind a black line in space and a flying head.
