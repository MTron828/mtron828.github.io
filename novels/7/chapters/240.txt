Chapter 241 - Envious Wealth

All the players present at the auction venue were awestruck by Shi Feng’s bid of 20 Gold Coins.

Players who could attend the Blackwing Auction all had extraordinary backgrounds. Even so, none of them could afford such a price.

Although plenty of the players present were provided funding by their own Guilds, that only amounted to 10 Gold or so. Even the wealthiest Guild present had brought only a little more than 20 Gold. Hence, nobody present would be willing to go all-out just for a pair of Level 15 daggers, even if they were weapons of supreme quality. Although these daggers could instantly turn an expert Assassin into an apex Assassin, they would not be of much help to the Guild in the long run.

Even if the players present could afford to buy these daggers, they would not spend 20 Gold to do so.

After the auctioneer slammed his hammer for the third time, everyone in the audience started laughing maniacally.

“What a stupid guy! He actually spent 20 Gold for those two daggers! I wonder who he is trying to impress, for him to willingly part with so much money?”

“Hahaha! At least I have one less competitor now!”

“Twenty Gold! What a rich tycoon!”

While ignoring everyone’s mockery, Shi Feng paid 20 Gold to the Auction House and received the two daggers. He then shifted his focus to the next item up for bid.

[Purgatory’s Shadow] (One-handed Sword, Dark-Gold Rank)

Level 20 (Can be upgraded twice)

Attack +273

Strength+30, Agility +25, Endurance +22

Attack Speed +2

20% chance to cause 300% damage.

10% chance to reduce damage dealt by target by 20%. Effect not stackable.

Additional Skill-

Purgatory Power: When activated, increases Attack Speed by 100% and damage dealt by 30% for 15 seconds.

Cooldown: 2 minutes

In God’s Domain, weapons and equipment could be categorized into two types: those that could be upgraded, and those that could not be upgraded.

A majority of the weapons and equipment available belonged to the latter category, and only a scant few items could be upgraded. Normally, only items of Epic rank or above could grow along with a player’s level, and very rarely would any item below Epic rank possess such a capability.

It can be upgraded twice? As expected of one of the treasures of the Blackwing Auction House. If this item could be upgraded to Level 30, it can still be of use even when players reach Level 45. Shi Feng was very satisfied with this weapon. He could equip the Purgatory’s Shadow once he reached Level 20, and he would not need to waste time looking for a new weapon.

Not only was the Purgatory’s Shadow suited to Swordsmen, it was also suitable for Shield Warriors and Guardian Knights. If an MT equipped this sword, not only would their maximum HP greatly increase, their damage output would similarly increase by a huge margin; they could aggro monsters much more firmly. However, the most important feature of this sword was its ability to reduce a target’s damage-dealing by 20%. This weapon was practically made to counter Boss monsters. If used inside a Team Dungeon, its effect would be decisive.

Compared to the two Fine-Gold ranked daggers from before, the Dark-Gold ranked Purgatory’s Shadow would be of much greater help to a Guild.

However, the minimum price for the Purgatory’s Shadow was likewise greater.

Many Guilds were overwhelmed by the sword’s starting bid of 15 Gold. With the funds they possessed, they could only sit on the sidelines in this auction.

“This sword belongs to me! Everyone else, don’t even think of trying to compete against me for it!”

“Who the fuck are you? We, World Dominators, have taken a liking to this sword! Whoever dares to bid will be looking for trouble with us!”

“Do you guys think you are the only first-rate Guild present in this auction? Our Guild is the Bloodthirsty War God! Anyone who dares to bid will be dead meat!”

......

Although the price of the Purgatory’s Shadow was high, the competition for it was still intense. It made one truly wonder just what price it would achieve in this auction. Hence, the many first-rate Guilds present started sending warnings to the other Guilds in the hopes of buying the Purgatory’s Shadow at a cheap price.

“Idiots.” Shi Feng helplessly shook his head at their actions.

Did these people think that the ones buying items here were limited only to players? Although the minimum bid for the Purgatory’s Shadow was 15 Gold, according to Shi Feng’s understanding, one needed to bid at least 25 Gold in order to secure the item. Otherwise, it would be bought out by NPCs. Did these first-rate Guilds think that, by voicing threats, they could take advantage of loopholes in the system?

Soon after, the bidding for the Purgatory’s Shadow started, and the price for the sword soared continuously.

In a blink of an eye, the price of the sword had already reached 20 Gold.

The ones currently bidding for the sword consisted of only first-rate Guilds. Second-rate and third-rate Guilds did not have the funds to take part in this auction at all. They could only look on in silence, unwillingness filling their hearts.

Meanwhile, Joking Scholar similarly felt helpless as he sat in the front row of the auction. If he had not been swindled by Lone Tyrant, he could have bought those two daggers already and also this Purgatory’s Shadow, while the other Guilds could only watch as he did so.

After the bidding continued for several minutes, the price for the Purgatory’s Shadow finally stopped increasing.

At 24 Gold 30 Silvers, this price was very low where Level 20 Dark-Gold Weapons were concerned. Not to mention, this was also a Dark-Gold Weapon that could be upgraded.

“Hahaha! This Purgatory’s Shadow belongs to me now!” Seeing that nobody else was outbidding him, the Berserker from World Dominators cheered.

The members of other Guilds could only look at this Berserker with unwillingness in their eyes. In an auction, players competed with one another in terms of wealth, not influence.

However, immediately after the auctioneer slammed his hammer for the second time, someone broke the silence and made a bid. Moreover, it wasn’t just limited to a single person.

“Twenty-five Gold.”

“Twenty-six Gold.

“This sword looks finely made. I can add it to my collection. I’ll bid 30 Gold Coins.”

At this moment, a nobleman of Blackwing City placed an astonishing bid, stupefying all the Guilds present. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Why are the NPCs joining the bid as well?”

This question baffled many of those present in this auction. If NPCs were going to bid against them too, how were they supposed to compete? That man was an NPC! A noble of Blackwing City at that! How were players supposed to outbid him?

“Damn! This Auction House is clearly trying to toy around with us! They’re only letting us players compete for the non-precious items!”

“If I had known this would happen, I would’ve bought those two Fine-Gold ranked daggers from before!”

“That person was truly lucky. He managed to so easily obtain those two daggers.”

Many of the players present started regretting their previous inaction. They never thought that the Auction House would play such a card.

“Thirty-one Gold.”

At this moment, a familiar, indifferent voice resounded in the auction hall. Every player in the venue immediately turned their gazes toward the origin of this indifferent voice. However, their eyes were immediately filled with both shock and disbelief when they discovered the owner of the voice.

The person who called out this bid was none other than Shi Feng, the person who previously bought the two Fine-Gold ranked daggers for 20 Gold. Now, he had once again placed a bid of 31 Gold.

“How much money does this fellow have?” Everyone started making speculations that Shi Feng might have robbed an NPC noble. Otherwise, how could he have so much money?

After Shi Feng shouted his bid of 31 Gold, the great noble immediately countered with a bid of 32 Gold.

However, Shi Feng did not fall behind as he followed up with 33 Gold.

As both parties took turns placing bids, the price of the Purgatory’s Shadow gradually increased. Every player witnessing this scene had their mouths gaping wide in shock.

Finally, Shi Feng secured the Purgatory’s Shadow at a price of 39 Gold.

Following which, several rounds of auction passed without much commotion. Compared to Shi Feng’s 39 Gold purchase, the other auctioned items were sold at much lower prices.

Although another treasure appeared during the auction, it was a Dark-Gold ranked leather armor that failed to pique Shi Feng’s interest. In the end, the equipment was bought by an NPC for 32 Gold.

When the auction reached its peak, the bid for the third treasure finally started.

This third treasure could also be considered the grand finale of this auction. Just the starting bid of this item was already set at 30 Gold, causing every Guild present to give up on bidding for it. After all, they already knew that, in order to secure this item, they would have to bid at least 50 Gold or above. Unless several first-rate Guilds pooled their funds together, it would be an impossible feat. However, the notion of forming such an alliance was simply unimaginable for the many first-rate Guilds present.

Lending money to other Guilds at this point in time would be no different from lending money to an enemy. Even if they did join together and purchased the item, there would only be one copy of the item. How were they supposed to split it? Hence, it was impossible for any of the Guilds present to form an alliance.
