Meanwhile, once players developed their Concentration to the Tier 6 Limit standard, they could mentally manipulate their Divine Might to form a domain, which was also known as a Divine Domain.

“Advanced Fine-Gold?” Shi Feng’s eyes brightened when he heard Melting Flame’s answer. “How many people do you need? How long will the upgrade take?”

Secret-Silver Flying Ships were already considerably rare in the Greater God’s Domain. As for Fine-Gold Flying Ships, they were as rare as a phoenix’s feather, and they were usually regarded by upper-ranking hegemonic powers as one of their most prized possessions.

Originally, Shi Feng thought Melting Flame could, at best, upgrade the Silverwing into a Fine-Gold Flying Ship. After all, the improvements flying ships received from each rank upgrade were much more significant than weapons and equipment. Hence, it was much more challenging to upgrade a flying ship’s rank.

Meanwhile, upon reaching the Advanced Fine-Gold rank, a Flying Ship would be akin to a Mobile Fortress. Not only could it withstand the attacks of Tier 6 players, but it also had the power to kill Tier 6 players. If the average Tier 6 player were to encounter an Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship while traveling across the Void Sea, they would usually steer clear of its path.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

For these reasons, Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ships were used by conglomerates as their primary method of transporting cargo between Realms.

“It’s only a simple power source replacement, so I’ll only need one Grandmaster Engineer to assist me with the modifications. The process also shouldn’t take more than four or five hours,” Melting Flame said, anticipation coloring his face as he looked at the crimson crystal on the table.

He had only seen an Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship once before, and it was when he was visiting a Holy City. When the Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship appeared near the Holy City, the entire city erupted with commotion. Even the Holy City’s Tier 6 defenders went on high alert for fear that the Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship was looking to do harm to the city.

Now that he had the opportunity to create an Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship, he couldn’t help but feel as if he was in a dream.

“Okay, go and get a Grandmaster Engineer right away, but make sure they are trustworthy,” Shi Feng said, nodding. Then, he handed Melting Flame a God’s Domain Contract and added, “Also, whoever you choose must sign this contract. The both of you will be responsible for modifying all Silverwings produced in the future.”

While time was of the essence currently, Zero Wing could still afford to wait a handful of hours, especially if it meant it could add an Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship to its resurrection camp’s defense. At that time, the resurrection camp’s safety would rise to a whole new level.

As for why Shi Feng was placing such heavy emphasis on keeping the Silverwing’s upgrade process a secret, it was because almost all Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ships in the Greater God’s Domain came from ancient ruins. Not a single power in existence could manufacture flying ships of such rank. Hence, should news of Zero Wing having the ability to produce Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ships get leaked, the consequences would be beyond Zero Wing’s capability to bear.

“Do you still have more of this godly material, Guild Leader?” Melting Flame couldn’t help but doubt his ears when he heard Shi Feng’s words. He dared not believe Shi Feng had more than one Divine Titan Source.

As an Inferior Divine Material, the Divine Titan Source’s rarity went without saying. Melting Flame wouldn’t even be surprised if there only existed a handful of pieces in the Greater God’s Domain. Yet, going by Shi Feng’s words, it was obvious that Zero Wing was looking to create more than just one Advanced Fine-Gold-ranked Silverwing. In other words, Zero Wing still had more Divine Titan Sources.

“I can’t tell you how many I have, but you can come straight to me for a Divine Titan Source for every Silverwing you complete,” Shi Feng said. “Also, make sure you are the only person present when installing the new power source.”

The value of a Divine Titan Source was not much lower than an Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship, and the Divine Titan Sources Shi Feng obtained from the God Slayer’s treasury numbered over ten thousand.

If Melting Flame were to learn of this number, he would probably go crazy.

If all these Divine Titan Sources could be converted into Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ships, Zero Wing would be unstoppable even in the Holy Race’s Greater God’s Domain, let alone the human race’s Greater God’s Domain.

“I understand! Rest assured, Guild Leader!” Melting Flame nodded, understanding the importance of this matter. Immediately, he left to seek out a trustworthy engineer.

The fact that Zero Wing could mass produce Secret-Silver Flying Ships was already plenty astonishing. If it became known that Zero Wing could mass produce Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ships, all hell would break loose in the Eternal Realm.

…

Zero Wing’s Residence, Special Workshop:

Two Zero Wing members wearing a Grandmaster Engineer Emblem currently stood before a work table, looking at Melting Flame, wondering why the other party had gathered them here.

“Why did you summon me and Silk Radish here, Boss Flame? Do you have something important for us to do?” Dozing Crocodile, a young man in his mid-twenties and one of the two Grandmaster Engineers in the room, asked as he looked at Melting Flame nervously.

Due to his contribution to the production of a large number of Eternal Magic Armor for the Guild, Melting Flame had already become Zero Wing’s Chief Forger. Although he still wasn’t a core executive of Zero Wing, his status was already comparable to that of core executives.

“It’s nothing major,” Melting Flame said as he looked at the two individuals who had joined Zero Wing at the same time as he did. Then, with a smile, he took out a God’s Domain Contract and continued, “I need an exclusive engineer to work under me. The benefits are listed in this contract. See if any of you are interested.”

Heeding Shi Feng’s instructions, Melting Flame settled on two possible candidates to take on Shi Feng’s task with him. These two candidates were Silk Radish and Dozing Crocodile. They were among the same batch of players who joined Zero Wing as he did, and both were currently among the best engineers in Zero Wing.

“We can never log in to God’s Domain once we break the contract?” Dozing Crocodile frowned when he read the final clause of Melting Flame’s contract.

Admittedly, Melting Flame offered incredibly lucrative benefits in his contract. In addition to a monthly salary of 100,000 Star Coins, Melting Flame also offered an advanced living quarter in Zero Wing’s main headquarters. In the current situation where the surrounding third-tier mobile cities were all frantically competing over Star Lake City’s housing spaces, this was a privilege Dozing Crocodile dared not dream of obtaining.

However, signing this God’s Domain Contract would also mean that he would forever be restricted to working for Zero Wing.

It should be known that he had only joined Zero Wing on behalf of his family, and his relationship with Zero Wing could only be considered a temporary partnership. There was also a strong possibility he would become the head of his family in the future. Compared to the benefits he could reap from being the ruler of a hegemonic power, the benefits Melting Flame offered could only be considered laughable. So, there was no reason for him to restrict himself to Zero Wing.

“I’ll sign this contract, Big Brother Melting Flame,” Silk Radish said without hesitation after reading the contract.

Silk Radish’s circumstances were different from Dozing Crocodile’s. Dozing Crocodile was an original inhabitant of the Greater World, and he even had citizenship in a third-tier mobile city. Even if he left Zero Wing, he would still have plenty of equally good options to choose from. However, for Silk Radish, Zero Wing was her only option as it was the only Guild from her home world currently operating in the Greater World. Not to mention, once she signed the exclusive contract, she would become a core member of Zero Wing and receive more resources to support her advancement to the Great Grandmaster rank.

“Okay. Sign it and follow me,” Melting Flame said, nodding.

Subsequently, Silk Radish signed the God’s Domain Contract and left to modify the Silverwing with Melting Flame. As for Dozing Crocodile, he nonchalantly returned to his workshop and resumed striving to become a Great Grandmaster Engineer so that he could become the head of his family as soon as possible.

Roughly five hours later, Melting Flame ran to the Guild Leader’s Office and happily handed the modified Silverwing to Shi Feng. Then, he left to start production on the second Silverwing so that he could modify more Secret-Silver Flying Ships into Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ships and produce a fleet of them for Zero Wing.

…

Zero Wing Residence, Guild Leader’s Office:

It’s all up to you now.

After Melting Flame left, Shi Feng took out the Origin Myth and expectantly moved the Advanced Fine-Gold Silverwing from his bag into the Origin Space.

An Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship might be powerful, but calling it the ruler of the skies was a stretch, especially against the Holy Race’s Sun Dynasty. One Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship was not enough to get Zero Wing out of its current predicament. However, with Zero Wing’s current situation, it wouldn’t be possible to produce a second Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship within a short time.

Hence, Shi Feng decided to take things a step further and upgrade the Silverwing again.

System: Origin Space has detected the Advanced Fine-Gold Silverwing. Strengthening and modifying the Silverwing will cost 4,000,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. Do you wish to proceed?

Four million?! What a scam! Shi Feng couldn’t help but be flabbergasted by the system notification.

It had only cost him six million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal when he upgraded the Abyss Workshop Certification from a Legendary Item into an Inferior Divine Item. Yet, the system was now asking him to pay four million units just to strengthen an Advanced Fine-Gold Flying Ship. The cost scaling was absolutely ridiculous.

Eventually, though, Shi Feng still chose to grit his teeth and strengthen the Silverwing.
