Chapter 152 - Legendary Character

South Wolf fell silent at Shi Feng’s calm reply.

He clearly informed Shi Feng of Underworld’s background and its frightening might, yet, Shi Feng still resolutely chose to oppose Underworld, refusing to hand over the flame.

This was the first time South Wolf encountered such a case.

“If you think that, just by being acquainted with and backing of [a]Gentle Snow, Underworld will not dare target you, you couldn’t be more wrong.” South Wolf sneered, “Even the currently famous Ouroboros does not dare possess enmity against Underworld, not to mention a measly First Vice-Leader. I’ll give you one last chance to hand over the flame. That way, you can still play in God’s Domain comfortably. Otherwise, there will be no place to accommodate you in all of God’s Domain.”

“It looks like you really don’t understand human words. Or is there a problem with your intelligence?” Shi Feng laughed disdainfully, “You wish to take something that belongs to me just with just a few words? Do you think that your family runs God’s Domain or something? I’ll tell you one more time; if you have the ability, then come! I’m eager to see just what you can do to me!”

If it were his last life, Shi Feng might have yielded. However, it was a different story altogether now. In this life, he possessed both the capital and confidence to challenge a gigantic existence like Underworld.

After reincarnating, Shi Feng’s goal in life was to complete the dream he never accomplished in his previous life, establishing his own virtual empire. On this path, he was destined to make enemies of the many major powers of God’s Domain.

If he lowered his head to Underworld now, how could he challenge the tyrants of God’s Domain in the future? How could he compete over the resources, territory, equipment, and such in God’s Domain?

Although Underworld’s influence was massive, and its influence in reality similarly great, when faced with God’s Domain, the globally acknowledged ‘second world,’ nary a power in the world could interfere with the Main God System, not to mention a measly Underworld.

Even if Underworld wished to investigate Shi Feng’s identity in real life, it was an impossible task to achieve. After over a hundred years of operation and improvements, the privacy of players in virtual reality games was nigh perfect. It was also impossible to uncover a person’s identity through virtual trades.

“Very good! Since it seems that you have truly steeled your heart to oppose Underworld, you better make your preparations to enter hell!” South Wolf was so angry, he smiled. He truly did not think that there would be a person who did not fear death.

Shi Feng was but a single independent player, and he only dared speak those conceited words because he did not know the terror of Underworld at all. In South Wolf’s view, Shi Feng was just an arrogant and presumptuous fool who did not know fear.

Underworld’s main influence covered two empires and several kingdoms, Star-Moon Kingdom included. As long as he reported this matter to the higher-ups, within a few days, an independent player like Shi Feng would no longer remain mingling in God’s Domain. At that time, Shi Feng would have no choice but to offer up that Epic ranked flame.

“Hell, is it? I’ve enjoyed it’s atmosphere plenty of times before, and entering yours won’t make any difference!” Shi Feng shrugged, smiling insolently as he spoke.

Shi Feng now possessed the Ice-Blue Devil flame. With his current battle prowess, he did not fear any player in the least. If they wished to gang up on him, he would use guerilla warfare to deal with them. His leveling speed was extremely rapid, so he could afford to face off against them. He did not believe that there was any Guild or power that could afford to waste that much manpower and resources to continuously battle him in Red Leaf Town.

After speaking his piece, Shi Feng disconnected the call.

“Brother Feng, what happened?” Blackie could feel Shi Feng’s rage from the conversation he just had. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Nothing much; it was just someone trying to rob me,” Shi Feng shook his head, casually describing Underworld as a bandit. “We’re better off thinking of a way to get information off of that elderly NPC.”

“Okay,” Blackie nodded, agreeing.

Although Shi Feng spoke lightly, Blackie knew that the matter was not as simple as Shi feng described. Blackie inwardly hated himself for not being any help to Shi Feng. If he could become more powerful, he might be of help to Shi Feng in the future.

In actuality, Blackie was not alone in this train of thought. Lonely Snow also detected the abnormality in Shi Feng’s tone, and he similarly hated himself for being so weak and helpless.

I must work harder to improve my technique and strength! At the very least, I can’t remain as dead-weight to Brother Feng!

Suddenly, the two of them held an eager desire to increase their own strength.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng hung up on him, South Wolf immediately contacted the upper echelons of Underworld.

“South Wolf, how is the matter regarding the Epic ranked item coming along?”

“Young Master Feng, I’ve already tried my best, but that brat Ye Feng still refused. He also looked down on Underworld, telling us to come at him if we have the ability.”

“Hahaha! He’s truly an interesting fellow! It is no wonder Snow is paying attention to him. I haven’t met such an arrogant person for a very long time now. Since he has rejected my good intentions, let him disappear from God’s Domain. I’ll give you the authority to mobilize all of Underworld in White River City, so quickly fetch me that item.”

“Yes, this subordinate will definitely succeed.”

After the call ended, South Wolf released a sigh of relief. Listening to that person’s tone, they were definitely angry. Otherwise, that person would not have given him the authority to mobilize the full strength of Underworld in White River City just to deal with a single Ye Feng.

“Ye Feng, let’s see how long you continue acting freely. Very soon, I’ll show what kind of place hell really is.” Just thinking of Shi Feng was enough to cause South Wolf’s belly to fill with rage. However, when he thought about how he could operate all the power of Underworld in the White River City region, he could not help his excitement.

Although Underworld had a very low member count, each and every one of them were elite experts. Some were even the upper echelons of major Guilds. If he gathered all of the members within the White River City region, the total power might even surpass that of a third-rate Guild in White River City. Being able to mobilize such a power, just thinking of it gave him an invigorating feeling.

Moreover, a majority of Underworld’s members were players who walked the path of darkness. What they loved most was murder, and they were the best at dealing with independent players like Shi Feng.

Meanwhile, as South Wolf thought of ways to deal with Shi Feng, the person, himself, was in the process of having a conversation with the NPC named Faust, albeit a one-sided one.

According to Shi Feng’s understanding, Faust was a strange old man.

Although Faust was a strange old man, he was also a legendary character. He was once known as the Elemental Dominator. During his youth, Faust had once killed a mighty dragon and had even sealed the Great Demon King. A Great Demon King was the human equivalent of a Tier 5 class. Moreover, Faust was once a teacher to the emperor of the Black Dragon Empire. Rumor had it that Faust had once fought against a God and survived the encounter. However, when he reached the age of 100, he suddenly started wandering all over God’s Domain. Right now, Faust was already an old monster that exceeded the age of 300.

As to how powerful Faust was right now, Shi Feng was unable to properly discern that. In short, Faust’s strength was immeasurably deep.

Hence, it was extremely difficult to start a conversation with Faust. The first condition to do so was to have sufficient strength to attract Faust’s attention. The second condition was to have delicious cooking.

Only when both of these conditions were fulfilled would Faust give out a Rare Quest called ‘Delicious Golden Fish.’ When this quest was completed, one could obtain a reward.

In reality, displaying sufficient strength to Faust was a simple task. To do so, one merely needed to deal over 100 damage to the Golden Fish. However, it was an extremely difficult challenge for players below Level 20 to cause over 100 damage. At the very minimum, one needed to be Level 20 and possess a complete set of Bronze Set Equipment and a Mysterious-Iron Weapon to achieve such damage. Moreover, before one displayed their strength, they needed to initiate a conversation with Faust. On the surface, Faust appeared to not take notice of players; in reality, he secretly paid attention.

Yet, just when Shi Feng was about to inform Blackie and Lonely Snow about these conditions, the two of them started cursing at Faust. However, this could also attract Faust’s attention...
