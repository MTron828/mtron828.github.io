Chapter 352 - One-Hit Asura (1)

The battle on the streets of White River City was in full swing now, and a large number of players died with every passing moment.

Surprisingly, however, even with such a massive war going on in the middle of White River City, none of the city guards had come forth to stop the players from killing each other. The guards had only sealed off the neighborhood around the Teleportation Hall where the battle took place. As long as a battle between players remained in this area, the guards would not pay it any mind. They would silently stand aside with spears in hand.

Meanwhile, the players in question had already gone completely crazy over the loot of the Mechanical Slayer. None of them even noticed Shi Feng who currently sat on top of a building at a distance. All of their attention was directed towards the items scattered across the ground.

However, when the female Guardian Knight, Turtledove, who stood beside Shi Feng, used an identification skill on him, she abruptly jumped in shock.

Level 34?! How is his level so high?!

Currently, a majority of the players in God‚Äôs Domain had yet to reach Level 20, yet, Shi Feng was Level 34....

The sight of Shi Feng‚Äôs Level of 34 was enough to cause any player to despair.

In God‚Äôs Domain, the suppression of 5 levels was detrimental, let alone a suppression of over 10 levels.

However, Turtledove had quickly discovered Shi Feng‚Äôs level falling by one. She was confused. Shi Feng had obviously not died, yet, his level had fallen.

Turtledove did not know that, at this moment, Shi Feng had assigned a large amount of EXP to the seven great skills of the Seven Luminaries Ring.

The amount of EXP that Shi Feng possessed at Level 34 was extremely abundant, and with the EXP of a single level, he had managed to upgrade all of the seven great skills of the Seven Luminaries Ring to Level 3.

As expected, the EXP required becomes increasingly abundant at the further levels. However, the skills have indeed significantly improved. I wonder how far I can upgrade them to if I dump in all the EXP I have? Once again, Shi Feng started assigning EXP to the Seven Luminaries Ring.

After Shi Feng examined the Attributes of the Level 5 Seven Luminaries Ring, his calm heart inadvertently grew excited.

In the legends, the Seven Luminaries Ring was said to be a Godly Relic. Even if it were just an Epic ranked Replica of the item, its strength far surpassed any player‚Äôs imagination.

Currently, the Seven Luminaries Ring Replica Shi Feng possessed was only Level 5. Looking at the Replica‚Äôs current Attributes, Shi Feng had even wondered if this Seven Luminaries Ring Replica could rival the strength an actual Legendary item.

However, if Shi Feng wanted to continue upgrading the Seven Luminaries Ring, he would need a horrifying amount of EXP. In his current position, it was simply impossible to upgrade the ring to Level 6.

Next, I need to work on the sure-kill skill, Flame Burst. Shi Feng called up the skill interface and began to upgrade Flame Burst.

Back in the Flame God‚Äôs Cave, Shi Feng had upgraded the skill to Level 5.
