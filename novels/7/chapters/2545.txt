Chapter 2546 – Divine Artifact?

When Shi Feng merged the Star of Light with the withered branch, the Mana inside the Basic Meditation Room started gathering rapidly around the branch.

In less than three seconds, a layer of white mist had formed around the withered branch. Moreover, this still wasn’t the end of it. Afterward, the Mana mist started condensing into drops of Liquid Mana on the branch and the area around it. Subsequently, the Liquid Mana flowed toward and into the branch’s broken end.

And with each drop of Liquid Mana that entered the withered branch, the branch quivered, giving off ripples of energy, as if some kind of creature was awakening.

It seems the results are quite good. Shi Feng grew elated when he sensed the ripples of energy from the withered branch.

Previously, when he saw that the Withered Rate of the branch had reached 94%, he had somewhat despaired of reviving the branch already.

Fortunately, there was no failure when trying to revive a Tree of Life’s branch. One merely needed to provide it with a continuous supply of high-density Mana and life energy. So long as that condition was met in sufficient quantity, the branch would grow into another Tree of Life.

The only problem was that the quantity and density of Mana and life energy required would vary depending on a branch’s Withered Rate. Meanwhile, the materials capable of supplementing the Mana and life energy that a 94% Withered main branch required were incredibly rare.

Fortunately, Shi Feng had been lucky on his trip to the western continent this time and secured himself a Star of Light. Without it, he really wouldn’t have any hope of resuscitating the withered branch he had.

Following which, time passed by rapidly. Before he knew it, eight hours had passed already. During this period, the withered branch had continuously condensed and absorbed Liquid Mana. Combined with the Star of Light’s essence, the branch was now brimming with life energy. In fact, it had even started leafing.

As green leaves kept sprouting on the branch, the life energy it radiated grew denser. Now, the entire room was brimming with life.

It just awoke, yet the life energy it’s giving off is already so dense? What is the rank of this Tree of Life? Shi Feng was a little surprised when he sensed the life energy filling the room. If players rest in this room, their recovery rate will most likely more than double.

In God’s Domain, even after players reached Tier 3, they still wouldn’t be immune to the corrosive energies in Level 100-plus maps; they would merely be more resistant to these energies. After the corruption reached a certain point, they would still have to return to cities to rest. Otherwise, they would collapse from hunger or exhaustion or simply outright die.

This was also the reason behind Stone Forest City’s rapid development.

However, even if players returned to a city to rest, they would still take a very long time to recover to their peak. While wealthy players also had the option of consuming Mana-rich food and beverages to accelerate their recovery, these only improved the recovery rate by a few dozen percent.

If players rested inside this room, however, their recovery rate would increase by at least 100%. This was simply incredible.

After all, expert players of God’s Domain consumed food and beverages that accelerated their recovery rate on a regular basis, to have more time grinding and exploring. Those of Guild upper echelons would even take ancient potions to increase their recovery rate, which was extremely expensive. The cheaper ones cost around 20 or 30 Gold per bottle, while expensive ones cost over 100 Gold!

Ancient potions were all Consumables whose effects lasted only four to six hours. However, combining the effects of ancient potions and food that boosted recovery rate could just barely double players’ recovery rate.

Now, however, a Tree of Life’s branch that had just been revived could grant this effect merely by being present inside a room. If news of this spread, the various powers of God’s Domain would definitely go crazy with envy.

After all, an ancient potion granted its effects to only one person. The Tree of Life’s branch, however, could aid all the players resting inside the room it was in.

Setting all else aside, this branch alone would already give Zero Wing’s main force members a huge lead over the various superpowers’ experts when it came to leveling up and improving their strength.

Meanwhile, as Shi Feng was reeling in astonishment from the passive effects the Tree of Life’s main branch displayed, the branch in question suddenly released an emerald glow. It then transformed into a sapling.

The instant the sapling took shape, Shi Feng felt an indescribably heavy pressure on him. The sapling had actually sucked the Basic Meditation Room dry of Mana. If not for Shi Feng having fully unlocked his Mana Body, the sapling’s action would’ve most likely killed him.

Unable to hold back his curiosity, Shi Feng promptly called out the sapling’s Attribute Panel.

Crap! It’s actually a Divine Artifact?! Shi Feng was stunned when he saw the statistics displayed before him.

[Ancient Tree of Life’s Sapling] (Fragmented Divine Artifact Rank)

A sapling brimming with life energy. The sapling also contains a trace of the world’s aura before the Great Destruction. This sapling is capable of producing 17 drops of Water of Life daily, 3 Nuclei of Life every three days, and one Fruit of Life every seven days. This sapling can survive only in places with high Mana density.

Capable of growth. (Requires a large amount of dense and pure energy to grow. Current Growth Rate 0%.)

Previously, he had merely speculated that the branch he obtained was a Divine Artifact because it had existed since ancient times, and the environment in ancient times was many times better than the environment in the current God’s Domain.

However, he never thought that the main branch would actually turn out to be a Divine Artifact!

Although it was a fragmented one, it was still a bona fide Divine Artifact! It wasn’t some powerful Legendary item labeled as a Divine Artifact.

Divine Artifacts could bring entire races to prosperity. They were existences that even Ancient Gods would fight tooth and nail for. Even the almighty War God’s Temple had only two Divine Artifacts in its warehouse.

If news of this sapling got out, let alone players, even the NPC powers of God’s Domain would most likely take action— particularly the dark powers, which would definitely destroy Stone Forest City. In fact, they wouldn’t mind drowning an entire empire in flames to get their hands on this sapling.

Hence, while Shi Feng was indeed ecstatic to see that the sapling turned out to be a Fragmented Divine Artifact, his emotions were complicated as he looked at the sapling.

Moreover, resuscitating a Tree of Life’s branch wasn’t the most difficult part about growing a Tree of Life. After all, so long as players found the right materials to supply the branch with Mana and life energy, they would be able to revive it. Even if players didn’t get the right materials on their first attempt, they could simply try and try again and eventually succeed.

The truly challenging part of growing a Tree of Life was keeping it alive.

The Tree of Life had extremely stringent living conditions. If players failed to meet these conditions, let alone getting the Tree of Life to develop, it wouldn’t be strange if the tree died. Then, players would have to find more materials to resuscitate it. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

One of the main conditions to keep a Tree of Life alive was to plant it in a location with sufficiently dense Mana.

Originally, Shi Feng had thought he could rely on Stone Forest City’s environment to grow his Tree of Life. After all, even if he managed to revive his branch, it would only become a sapling. The amount of Mana a sapling required wasn’t as much as what a mature Tree of Life needed. In fact, with Stone Forest City’s Mana environment, he was confident he could grow even a Legendary ranked sapling.

However, for the Fragmented Divine Artifact ranked sapling before him, he discovered that even one of the city’s Basic Meditation Rooms couldn’t supply the sapling’s Mana requirements.

It seems that if I don’t upgrade Stone Forest City, I can’t even touch this Tree of Life. Shi Feng revealed a bitter smile as he looked at the sapling hovering before him. He then contacted Gentle Snow and asked, “Snow, how are things coming along on your side?”
