Chapter 210 – Superpower Zero Wing?

“How are their levels so high?”

“Even the various superpowers’ leveling maniacs have only reached Level 110, yet Zero Wing’s executives have already reached Level 112 or above. They can already explore the Boundary Mountain Range’s surroundings with such levels!”

“They can do more than just exploring the Boundary Mountain Range’s surroundings. With such high levels, they can already investigate the labyrinth inside the Boundary Mountain Range. So long as they don’t go too deep and come across monsters above Level 117, they won’t have to worry about level suppression.”

Twilight Echo’s peak geniuses were shocked when they saw Shi Feng’s group.

Leveling in the Miniature Ancient World would slow down to a crawl past Level 105. Once players reach Level 105, they’d be fortunate if they could achieve a level up within three or four days. Because of this slow leveling speed, even the various superpowers’ main force members had only managed to reach Level 110 at this stage of the game. Moreover, that was with the help of Mounts.

Even so, that was already more than enough to make many players envy them. This was because players who have reached Level 110 could explore the Boundary Mountain Range’s surroundings without having to worry about level suppression.

Meanwhile, according to the various superpowers’ initial exploration of the Boundary Mountain Range’s surroundings, it was found that the place was extremely rich in resources. Just the number of mineral veins, which produced Magic Crystals, discovered numbered over a dozen already.

There were also several towns occupied by monsters. So long as players managed to occupy these towns, they would become money-printing machines that could help players generate a lucrative income. After all, these towns had a much better geographical advantage than even the Abyssal Star Ancient City.

However, neither the mineral veins nor the towns were the focus of the various superpowers. What truly caught the various superpowers’ attention was the labyrinth inside the Boundary Mountain Range.

While investigating the Boundary Mountain Range’s surroundings, the various superpowers had come across plenty of information pertaining to the Tier 4 promotion process in the Miniature Ancient World. Meanwhile, according to this information, the crucial factor for players to reach Tier 4 lies within the labyrinth inside the Boundary Mountain Range.

On the current main continent, it was no longer special for players to reach Tier 4. However, it was a different story for the Miniature Ancient World. Getting promoted to Tier 4 would be a crucial factor in deciding whether one could break through the Boundary Mountain Range and enter the Miniature Ancient World’s neutral zone. Meanwhile, the sooner one could reach the neutral zone, the sooner one could meet with the players of the other God’s Domain, and the more advantages one could acquire in the struggle between the two God’s Domains.

“But why is Zero Wing gathering so many peak geniuses in Hundred Flow City? Is it not afraid of getting targeted by the Flower of Seven Sins? Many of the Sin of Gluttony’s lunatics are currently operating around Hundred Flow City. If those lunatics find out Zero Wing has gathered so many peak geniuses here, they’ll attack the Candlelight Hotel without hesitation.”

“It’s probably to catch the Flower of Seven Sins off guard. If we were to suddenly enter the primordial ruins with so many experts, even the Flower of Seven Sins would need time to gather enough experts to deal with us. We can use this time to hunt for many Mounts.”

“It’s a sound idea. Most of the Flower of Seven Sins’ members are resting in the town located in the primordial ruins’ center. With how large the inside of the primordial ruins is, the Flower of Seven Sins can only focus its search around the resting towns. So, all we need to do is avoid those towns. Although doing so would reduce the amount of time we can spend in the primordial ruins, it’ll give the Flower of Seven Sins a hard time to target us.”

Twilight Echo’s members started an enthusiastic discussion when they saw the Zero Wing members gathered in the lobby, their previous gloominess vanishing completely.

Initially, they thought that Zero Wing would be having them enter the primordial ruins and help the Guild do the bulk of its work. If they were the only Refinement Realm experts in Zero Wing’s team, they’d have a very limited range of movement in the primordial ruins. This was because the monsters inside the primordial ruins were not only numerous, but even the weakest among them was a Great Lord. Even a team of 100 Refinement Realm experts would have difficulty operating in such an environment. If they couldn’t even move about freely in the primordial ruins, it’d take no time for the Flower of Seven Sins to find them and kill them.

However, if their team was made up of several hundred Refinement Realm experts, moving around inside the primordial ruins would become significantly easier. This would make it much more difficult for the Flower of Seven Sins to locate them. Moreover, even if the Flower of Seven Sins found them, by the time it gathered its forces to attack them, they would have long since moved to another location or left the primordial ruins with their harvest. Overall, the risk of the operation had decreased by at least 80%.

“All of Zero Wing’s internal geniuses and Twilight Echo’s peak geniuses have arrived, Guild Leader,” Blackie excitedly reported to Shi Feng after counting the young players present. “We have a total of 507 geniuses here. Of them, 331 have reached the Refinement Realm, while the rest are at the Half-step Refinement Realm standard.”

Even if they excluded Twilight Echo’s 60 peak geniuses, the number of Refinement Realm experts Zero Wing currently had already rivaled the number of Refinement Realm experts the various first-rate Guilds had in the Miniature Ancient World.

Although a force of 271 Refinement Realm experts might seem insignificant in the Stratified Abyssal Realm, it was a very formidable force in the Miniature Ancient World. At the very least, such a force was enough to let Zero Wing establish a stable foothold in God’s Domain.

“Good! Distribute the Hypersensitivity Potions to them,” Shi Feng said, nodding.

Originally, Shi Feng had planned to maintain a low profile for some time after returning to the Miniature Ancient World. After all, with his training method, Zero Wing’s Refinement Realm experts would only continue to increase in number as time passed.

However, the Flower of Seven Sins was much more ruthless than he expected, placing a bounty of 1,000 Credits per kill on Zero Wing’s members. Players could earn an ordinary person’s monthly wage simply by killing a few of Zero Wing’s members. Who wouldn’t be tempted by such an offer? Because of this, many players had started to ambush Zero Wing’s members even near Abyssal Star City.

In contrast, the players who targeted the Flower of Seven Sins’ members were only the various powers’ members interested in exchanging Asura’s items. Although this situation had affected the Flower of Seven Sins’ operations to a certain extent, it wasn’t enough to harm the organization’s roots. After all, most of the Flower of Seven Sins members killed were the organization’s outer members. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The existence of these outer members was negligible to the Flower of Seven Sins. Yet, the Asura Mercenary Alliance had to pay out tons of rare resources in exchange for the lives of these negligible individuals.

Hence, Shi Feng had decided that he would teach the Flower of Seven Sins a painful lesson!

In no time at all, Blackie distributed a Hypersensitivity Potion to everyone present. Upon receiving the Hypersensitivity Potion and reading its description, both Zero Wing’s and Twilight Echo’s members were dumbfounded.

According to the description, the Hypersensitivity Potion would promptly put players into a hypersensitive state upon use, greatly increasing their learning capabilities for twelve hours.

The potion’s effect might not sound like much, but it should be known that secret lands capable of improving a player’s learning capabilities were highly contested by the various superpowers. Moreover, this learning buff was only available within the settlements inside these secret lands. This meant that players could only use this buff to train their combat techniques, Skills, and Spells. It couldn’t be used to help them fight against monsters.

However, the Hypersensitivity Potion didn’t have any zone restrictions. Its effects could even be used to fight against monsters. One could easily imagine the improvements it could provide to players.

Yet, Zero Wing had distributed over 500 of these Hypersensitivity Potions in one fell swoop. This was a generosity that even the various superpowers were unlikely to be capable of…

“Alright, bottoms up,” Shi Feng said as he scanned the crowd before him.
