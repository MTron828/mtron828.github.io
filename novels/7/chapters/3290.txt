Chapter 365 – Miniature Ancient World Shaken

Thunder Fortress, Wind Bell Hotel:

The Wind Bell Hotel was one of the few Advanced Hotels in the Thunder Fortress. Even though the hotel charged an exorbitant accommodation fee of ten units of Seven Luminaries Crystal per day for its cheapest room, its rooms were still highly coveted by the various hegemonic powers. This was because it could not only allow players to recover from the corrosion of hostile energies, but it could also temporarily improve players’ Physique. More specifically, players could gain a 5% increase in their Physique for up to 48 hours if they rested in the hotel for eight hours.

Currently, though, the Wind Bell Hotel was surrounded by over a hundred Tier 4 experts. Moreover, when the various hegemonic powers’ Tier 4 titled experts saw these players’ Guild Emblem, none dared to force their way into the hotel. Instead, they chose to look for other hotels to stay at.

“Lord Saint Nine, I really have to thank you for your reminder on the flying ship. Otherwise, I would have most certainly died a tragic death,” Calgaron said, shuddering a little when he recalled the news his subordinates had just sent him. “I can’t believe Black Flame would dare to kill even that Dira! He truly is insane!”

Any executive member of the Starlight Realm’s various hegemonic powers and corporations would know about Dira. He was an existence even the helmsmen of corporations greatly feared.

Yet, now, Black Flame had slain Dira. Once this news spread across the Starlight Realm, it would definitely shake the entire Realm.

Saint Nine, who currently sat cross-legged in the middle of the lounge, also couldn’t help but be taken aback when he finished reading the message Calgaron shared with him. “Although I’ve long guessed that Black Flame isn’t some small-time character, I didn’t think he had kept so much hidden. A Legendary Weapon… With this thing in hand, I doubt anybody in the Miniature Ancient World can survive more than one attack from him.”

…

Meanwhile, in another Advanced Hotel in the Thunder Fortress…

“Dira died?” Franz fell into a daze when he read the message he had just received. “Is Black Flame insane?”

Even the Starlight Realm’s various upper-ranking hegemonic powers would have to treat Dira like he was their ancestor. After all, even disrespecting Dira was enough to lead to the elimination of their entire organization from God’s Domain, let alone harming Dira.

As for the act of killing Dira, this was something nobody in the Starlight Realm dared to think about.

“It seems an unprecedented storm is going to sweep across this miniature world soon,” Favra said, sighing when she finished reading the report. All of a sudden, she wasn’t sure whether her niece Maria had a good eye for people or not anymore. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Not only did Black Flame become the Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon, but he even possessed a Legendary Weapon. With such strength, Black Flame would be invincible in the Miniature Ancient World.

Originally, Black Flame could have accomplished great things in the Miniature Ancient World. Under his lead, Zero Wing could also develop its Abyssal Star Primordial City into the Miniature Ancient World’s number one city. Zero Wing might even be able to secure itself a position in the Thunder Fortress, gaining hold of a portion of the wealth that would eventually come through the World Passage.

Now, though, all that had become nothing more than a dream.

Even the Miniature Ancient World in its entirety was incapable of withstanding the Divine Seal Saint’s wrath, let alone an individual like Black Flame.

…

Meanwhile, after the Miniature Ancient World’s various powers received news of Dira’s death, apart from feeling shocked, they also felt delighted.

“I have to admit that Black Flame is indeed strong. If he can kill even Dira, he is undoubtedly the strongest player in the current Miniature Ancient World.”

“Originally, I thought Zero Wing would make a comeback in the World Passage’s opening this time. Now, though, Zero Wing is finished. The moment the World Passage opens will also be the moment of Black Flame’s and Zero Wing’s elimination.”

There was only a limited amount of reward points to go around during the World Passage’s opening. Originally, Zero Wing could have relied on Black Flame’s fame and strength to secure a share of the World Passage’s opening benefits. So, Black Flame’s and Zero Wing’s elimination would naturally be good news for the various powers.

…

“Brother Black Flame, now that you’ve killed Dira, the Divine Seal Saint definitely won’t rest until you’re gone,” Midsummer worriedly said as she looked at Shi Feng. “The Paimon Conglomerate might not have much strength in the current Miniature Ancient World, but once the World Passage opens, this world will no longer be safe…”

Before access to a God’s Domain or miniature world became open, it would be subjected to the Main God System’s protection. Under the system’s protection, even apex powers would have difficulty laying their hands on it.

However, it was a different story once a God’s Domain’s or miniature world’s World Passage opened.

While foreign players entering through the World Passage would be subjected to the suppression of the world’s power, it still wasn’t a difficult task for a conglomerate to destroy an entire God’s Domain, let alone a miniature world.

Jun Luosha also nodded in agreement with Midsummer’s words. She felt that Shi Feng was truly crazy. She had even started to regret accepting Wu Xiaoxiao’s invitation…

“This is indeed going to be a problem.” Shi Feng did not refute Midsummer’s concerns. Instead, he calmly said, “But so long as we are talking about this miniature world, even after the World Passage opens, the Paimon Conglomerate won’t have an easy time targeting me or Zero Wing.”

The World Passage wouldn’t become fully opened all at once. Instead, it was a gradual process. In a certain sense, it could be considered a protection mechanism for the affected world’s players, giving them time to adapt to the Greater God’s Domain.

Although the opening of the Miniature Ancient World’s World Passage would immediately allow players from other worlds to enter, only Tier 4 players could enter the Miniature Ancient World at the beginning. Only after some time had passed would Tier 5 and Tier 6 players be allowed to enter directly.

Hence, so long as Shi Feng had enough God Crystals to temporarily upgrade the Winter of Eternal Night to the Legendary rank, he had no reason to fear Tier 4 players. Any number of Tier 4 players the Paimon Conglomerate sent at him would merely be cannon fodder. This was also why he dared to kill Dira.

However, a larger part of why Shi Feng had chosen to kill Dira was because of his contract with the Dragon Princess.

So long as he could collect 300 God Crystals to help the Dragon Princess recover her strength, he would not have to fear any power in the Miniature Ancient World. After all, the Dragon Princess’s strength was no joke.

After Shi Feng finished speaking, the group of four also arrived at Zero Wing’s gathering point in the Thunder Fortress.
