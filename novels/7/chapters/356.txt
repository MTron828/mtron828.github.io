Chapter 357 - Six-star Extermination Magic Array

Red Feather’s offer of compensating five times the losses had they suffered was very tempting, and many Guild Leaders present hesitated at the offer.

Unlike the powerful Guilds in White River City, as unrated Guilds, they did not have much financial support as unrated Guilds. Their sources for Gold Coins were also limited. If they signed an agreement with Red Feather, their subordinates’ deaths would only profit them in the future.

If they took Red Feather’s offer, however, they would sacrifice a lot of their Guilds’ strength. Moreover, they would also lose the faith of their Guild members.

Seeing these Guilds hesitate, Red Feather started to panic. Although he was unsure of whether Zero Wing still possessed large-scale destruction spells or not, he had a guaranteed method to kill Black Flame. As long as he could approach the man, Black Flame would die even if he were an expert ranked on the God’s Domain Experts List.

Once Black Flame died, the dropped items he carried would fall from his bag. Meanwhile, Red Feather would be the first person to grab those items. Afterward, he could simply use the teleportation array to leave White River City.

Now that the dropped items his team had previously obtained were no more, if he could not snatch the items on Black Flame’s body, how could he walk away with satisfaction?

“Don’t tell me that none of you want the loot from the Mechanical Slayer?

“That was a monster that even a Tier 4 Great Wizard struggled to kill. Not to mention Dark Gold items, it would not be odd to find Epic items among the drops. Don’t you want the power of an Epic item?”

Red Feather’s comments excited the various Guild players.

None of them had even seen a Dark-Gold item before, let alone an Epic item.

If a Guild obtained an Epic item, it would instantly become a hot topic throughout the entire God’s Domain. At that time, even an unknown Guild would become famous, attracting the attention of many guildless players. Although it would still be no match for a truly powerful Guild, it could still become an overlord of a city.

The might of an Epic item was unimaginable.

In God’s Domain, Dungeons were one of the main sources for players to obtain weapons and equipment. As only a limited number of players could enter a Dungeon, if one wanted an easier time raiding, they could only do so by upgrading the combat power of a limited number of players. Hence, not only were Epic items significant symbols to a Guild, but they also played a very large role in the Guild.

At this stage of the game, if a Guild could obtain an Epic item, the strength of the Guild would instantly soar to the next level.

The Mechanical Slayer’s loot needed to be appraised before anyone could discern quality and Attributes. Hence, nobody knew the exact quality of the Slayer’s loot. However, seeing as the Mechanical Slayer had been such a powerful monster, it would not be surprising even to find Epic items among its loot. As long as there was the slightest possibility, nobody among the crowd would easily give up on this chance. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Charge!”

“For the Epic items!”

“Black Flame, hand over the Epic items, and we’ll spare your life!”

The various Guilds charged at Shi Feng once more with passion. Setting aside Red Feather’s offer, t the lure of an Epic item alone was worth any price.

At this moment, Aqua Rose walked up to Shi Feng’s side, suggesting, “Guild Leader, they’re charging at us once more. We’ve bought enough time now. Should we depart?”

Although they had the absolute advantage of levels, equipment, and terrain, if they had to face so many players, death and injury would be inevitable. Since they have already achieved their goals, it was not necessary to continue fighting.

“Okay, let’s withdraw,” Shi Feng nodded. “Pass me the Tier 3 Magic Scroll that you obtained from Creek Town. I’ll stall for time and leave them with a memento. Take this chance to activate the teleportation array.”

Indeed, just as Red Feather had guessed, large-scale destruction spells were not so easy to come by. At this moment, only he and Blackie possessed such spells. Although they had plenty of small-scale AOE attack spells, the might and range of these spells were not enough. They would not play a significant role in this battle.

“Are we really going to use that Tier 3 Magic Scroll? That’s the only one we received from the crusade. Why don’t we just have everyone hold those players off for a bit? In any case, we only need to stall for a moment. If we don’t have to fight for that long, we should not incur any casualties.” Aqua Rose’s heart ached when she heard Shi Feng’s intentions. The value of a Tier 3 Magic Scroll far surpassed a single Dark-Gold item.

“It doesn’t matter. Now is the best time to use it.” Shi Feng waved his hand.

Aqua Rose simply sighed in response to Shi Feng’s decision. With a heavy heart, she handed the Tier 3 Magic Scroll over. She only had herself to blame for working under such a Guild Leader. Normally, Shi Feng spent his money lavishly, not bothering with a budget. However, it was also a fact that the results of his spendthrift actions would always pay off.

“Go. Leave this to me.”

The Tier 3 Magic Scroll Aqua Rose had handed Shi Feng was deep-blue with gold inlaid around its edges. Upon receiving the scroll, Shi Feng unrolled it and clicked “Use.”

The Tier 3 Magic Scroll they had obtained from the Blood Hand Association’s hidden warehouse was entitled Water Dragon’s Flurry. This Magic Scroll contained a very rare large-scale destruction spell with a 2-second cast time.

As water-type mana began to gather around Shi Feng, a large-scale, deep-blue magic array formed beneath his feet.

“Crap! It’s another large-scale destruction spell!”

The Tier 3 spell’s generated momentum was so immense that the incoming tide of players quickly discovered its appearance. The crowd immediately panicked and tried to withdraw. At this moment, Red Feather’s face turned ashen. He would never have thought that Shi Feng still possessed another large-scale destruction spell.

Although the crowd retreated quickly, it was too late as Shi Feng had already unleashed the magic of the Tier 3 Magic Scroll in his hands.

Water gushed down from the sky like a massive waterfall, rolling into a tidal wave that was over a dozen meters high. The wave smashed across all of the Guild players within the Teleportation Hall, and in the blink of an eye, the violent tidal wave devoured hundreds of players. Following which, the turbulent water flooded from the building’s entrance. It was like a tsunami. The massive wave devoured many of the players outside the Hall, and every victim of the spell became nothing more than an icy corpse.

As to how many players had died, even Shi Feng himself was not sure. However, what Shi Feng did know was that the Water Dragon’s Flurry had killed more players than both Stars of Light and Firestorm combined.

“It’s about time for me to leave as well,” Shi Feng examined his surroundings, satisfied. The Teleportation Hall was void of any members of the various Guilds.

“Oh? That’s not right. Someone’s still here.” Shi Feng suddenly sensed danger.

Shi Feng was very familiar with this feeling, so he knew to keep his guard up. Such a feeling only occurred when he encountered life-threatening danger. Hence, Shi Feng immediately activated Omniscient Eyes.

Since he had not seen anyone inside the hall, the only possibility left was Assassins.

Omniscient Eyes allowed Shi Feng to perceive any invisible or stealth units within 100 yards.

After activating the skill, a golden glow enveloped both of his eyes. He then observed his surroundings. Like a god overlooking all lifeforms, nothing could hide from his vision.

“Six people, is it?” Shi Feng quickly discovered six obscure figures slowly approaching him from 30 yards away.

These six Assassins felt a chill down their backs the moment Shi Feng’s gaze landed on them.

“Damn it. We’ve been discovered.”

“Forget about it. This distances should be enough. We can’t disappoint Boss Red Feather.”

The six Assassins were all experts. Hence, they immediately decided to reveal themselves and take out the purple-gold crystal balls.

That’s the Six-star Extermination Magic Array! How could they have it?! Shi Feng was abruptly shocked when he saw the purple-gold crystal balls in the hands of the six Assassins.

These items were no less rare than a Tier 3 Magic Scroll. Though they were far more powerful than a Tier 3 Magic Scroll, the requirements and limitations were also far more troublesome than a Tier 3 Magic Scroll.
