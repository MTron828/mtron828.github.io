Chapter 141 – Zero Wing’s Confidence

Misty Canyon, Abyssal Star Primordial City:

Flashes of light appeared in the city’s central plaza one after another, instantly enveloping the entire plaza in light.

When these flashes of light faded, they revealed the figures of players. These players easily numbered in the tens of thousands, and this number was still rapidly increasing with each passing second.

“So, this is the Abyssal Star Primordial City?”

“What a great place this is! The Mana density here is a great deal higher than even NPC Cities! The purification rate is also several times faster!”

“This primordial city is too amazing! If I can come here once I reach Level 110, my leveling speed will double or even triple! I wonder which of the Five Great Super Guilds built this city? Whoever built it will definitely hold the number one position in the Miniature Ancient World in the future.”

The instant the various players arrived in Abyssal Star City, they promptly discovered its greatness. Many executives from the various superpowers had also begun contacting their friends in the Five Great Super Guilds, all of them wishing to form a partnership with the owner of this city.

However, even after asking around, none of these executives had managed to come up with any useful information. After all, even the Five Great Super Guilds were stunned by this situation. They were all curious which one among them had managed to come up with such a powerful city within such a short time.

Out of the swarm of players that had arrived in Abyssal Star City, one particular group of cloaked players behaved differently from the rest of the crowd. While others were randomly wandering around the city and taking in all the information they could, this group of cloaked players swiftly moved around the city as if they had known about its layout beforehand and inspected only the key locations in the city. Some of these cloaked players had even arrived in front of the primordial tower already.

“Is this the primordial tower that Soul mentioned?”

“This tower should be the Legacy of an ancient civilization. It seems that Soul did not lie to us.”

“I honestly didn’t expect Soul to find a powerful backer in the Miniature Ancient World. I thought she would have no chance of wrestling her commander position back. Now, it seems she might have a chance at doing so.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I heard Soul say that the owner of this city is a God-ranked expert from an Outerworld power that’s even stronger than our God’s Domain’s Five Great Super Guilds combined. I thought she was joking with me before, but it seems that this might also be true. After all, there’s no way any of the current Five Great Super Guilds can come up with such a city.”

“The mercenary alliance Soul invited us to join has relatively lax conditions. They’re much better than the Flower of Seven Sins’s rules. What do you guys think?”

“Soul has gone a little crazy from trying to wrestle back her position, so we can’t fully trust her judgment. I think it’s best if we meet that God-ranked expert she mentioned first.”

When the six cloaked players gathered in front of the primordial tower talked about Hidden Soul, they spoke as if they were talking about a little kid. It should be known that Hidden Soul was a Tier 5 expert capable of threatening even Tier 6 God-ranked experts. Yet, these six players did not show any fear or respect when speaking about her.

If Hidden Soul were here, she wouldn’t feel surprised by these six people’s behavior. This was because these six people were very special. They were also the strongest experts she could find. Although these people were not Tier 6 God-ranked experts, every one of them was an expert who had already reached the second step or third step of the Domain Realm. They were far stronger than the average Domain Realm expert, and even most Tier 6 God-ranked experts were only on this level in terms of combat standards.

...

Meanwhile, in the front courtyard of a Guild Hall that occupied a huge area along Abyssal Star City’s main street, over a thousand players wearing Zero Wing’s Guild Emblem were currently gathered here.

“This is...the Abyssal Star Primordial City?”

“Our Guild Residence is in Abyssal Star City?”

“Am I dreaming?”

When the gathered Zero Wing members looked at their system map and the players curiously looking at them from outside the Guild Residence, they quickly realized where they were currently—the Abyssal Star Primordial City that was now a sensation throughout the entire Miniature Ancient World.

For a time, everyone present couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

This was the Abyssal Star Primordial City they were talking about!

Even though Abyssal Star City had only existed for a short period, many people had already recognized it as the number one city in the Miniature Ancient World. Meanwhile, whoever got to develop in this city would have a significant advantage when entering the Boundary Mountain Range in the future.

Currently, countless powers were trying to get in touch with Abyssal Star City’s ruling power. Yet, their Guild had already secured a Guild Residence in the city... This was simply unbelievable.

At this time, everyone gathered could already imagine what kind of future lay in front of their Guild. They’d be able to enter the Boundary Mountain Range ahead of everyone else and become the envy of the various powers in God’s Domain.

While Zero Wing’s members were getting excited over this situation, Shi Feng had also arrived at the Residence’s courtyard.

“Guild Leader, is this really going to be our Guild Residence?” Firecloud couldn’t help but ask as he looked at Shi Feng.

Zero Wing was currently facing great pressure due to World Dominators’s kill order. While they were still holding on because of the Mana Equipment Set, this wasn’t a long-term solution. If they weren’t careful, they could lose even their Mana Equipment Sets.

However, if Zero Wing could have a Guild Residence in Abyssal Star City, the various powers of God’s Domain would have difficulty even coming into contact with them, let alone hunting them. Moreover, since Zero Wing was able to secure a Guild Residence in Abyssal Star City, it meant that Zero Wing shared deep ties with Abyssal Star City’s ruling power.

In that case, the various powers’ experts and independent experts would have to think twice about targeting Zero Wing in the future. They’d have to consider whether World Dominators’s bounty or Abyssal Star City’s advantages were more important.

After all, Abyssal Star City’s ruling power would only need to lift a finger to prohibit specific players from entering the city. Unless those hunting Zero Wing’s members could hide their identities perfectly, they’d have to say goodbye to Abyssal Star City otherwise.

Moreover, players would become Red Players if they killed other players out in the fields. The more players they killed, the longer they would remain as Red Players. Unless these Red Players remained outside of Abyssal Star City forever, there was no way they could avoid getting detected. However, the likelihood of that happening was low.

The density of the foreign energy present in the Boundary Mountain Range was incredibly high, so the corrosion speed there was much faster than Level 110 maps. Even players with Silver Mana Bodies could, at most, last a dozen hours in the Boundary Mountain Range. If players exceeded their time limit, they would die to the corrosion of the foreign energy and lose levels and equipment.

When Firecloud finished speaking, the other Zero Wing members present also turned to look at Shi Feng, hoping to gain verification directly from Shi Feng’s mouth.

“Don’t worry. This Guild Residence belongs to Zero Wing from now on,” Shi Feng said, chuckling when he saw everyone’s nervous expressions. “Also, I have another piece of news to tell you. Zero Wing is one of Abyssal Star City’s founding powers, so you don’t have to worry that we might get banished from the city in the future. Nobody will dare offend Zero Wing in this city!”
