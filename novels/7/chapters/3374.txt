Chapter 449 – New Upper Limit?

The teleportation gate that was originally enveloped by golden light was now enveloped in pitch-black light, the sight making everyone think as if night had descended.

World Mode?

Thousand Scars and Death Omen fell into a daze when they heard the system notification, shock and confusion appearing in their eyes.

What did he do?

Unrestrained Lionheart turned to look at Shi Feng, an additional layer of mystery shrouding the individual who was already mysterious, to begin with.

It was universally accepted in the Greater God’s Domain that God Mode was the highest difficulty that Team Dungeons could have. Never had a greater difficulty been discovered.

Yet, now, Shi Feng had revealed a difficulty setting above God Mode simply by drawing a magic array. This was simply unbelievable.

At this time, even Frey looked at Shi Feng in surprise.

After witnessing him successfully leading a Tier 3 team to take down a Tier 5 Nether King, Frey had long known that Shi Feng was an extraordinary individual. She could have never completed her Legendary Quest if it wasn’t for Shi Feng. It was for this reason she had agreed to let Shi Feng take command of her team this time a second time.

However, Frey and her team members weren’t the only ones informed about the change in the Courtyard of Space’s difficulty. The many other human and Holy Race players present in the basin had received a similar notification from the system.

“What? World Mode?”

“Is this for real? Shouldn’t the highest difficulty for Team Dungeons be God Mode?”

“Quick! Notify the commander that a change has occurred to the ruin!”

Everyone’s initial reaction to the Courtyard of Space’s change was to be confused. Then, they quickly snapped out of their dazes and contacted their respective teams and superiors. After all, the increased upper limit of the Courtyard of Space’s difficulty was absolutely an earth-shattering piece of news.

Every God Mode Team Dungeon was a massive treasure trove in the Greater God’s Domain.

However, Team Dungeons with a God Mode difficulty setting was unlike other Dungeons. Not only did they appear randomly and infrequently, but they would also disappear forever so long as someone secured its First Clear.

Meanwhile, the Courtyard of Space was a ruin left behind by the Goddess of Space. So, it went without saying it would house astonishing loot. This was also why the various powers were desperate to secure the First Clear for the Courtyard of Space’s God Mode.

Now that the Courtyard of Space had gained an even higher difficulty setting, the loot available in this higher difficulty setting might be elevated to a whole new standard. After all, this was the first time a World Mode difficulty setting had appeared in the Greater God’s Domain.

“Let’s head inside,” Shi Feng said through the team chat after seeing that he had successfully activated the Courtyard of Space’s World Mode.

It was common knowledge that God Mode Team Dungeons would disappear once someone had secured their First Clear.

However, the Courtyard of Space’s entrance did not disappear. Instead, the teleportation gate simply entered a sealed state and forbade players from entering the Dungeon. It wasn’t until a month later, when the various powers had stopped paying attention to the Dungeon, that a change occurred.

More specifically, the team that had secured the Courtyard of Space’s First Clear had returned and drawn a Master Mana Gathering Array on the sealed teleportation gate.

Then, what happened next shocked the entire Greater God’s Domain.

God Mode, the difficulty setting publicly acknowledged as the upper limit for Team Dungeons, stopped being the upper limit.

After Shi Feng finished speaking, he stepped into the teleportation gate and vanished before everyone’s eyes.

“Should we go in, Vice Guild Leader?” Unrestrained Lionheart asked as he looked toward Frey, hesitation in his eyes.

Before today, the Greater God’s Domain’s Team Dungeons had five difficulty settings: Normal, Hard, Hell, Asura, and God. The first three difficulty settings could be found in most of the randomly occurring Team Dungeons in the Greater God’s Domain. The last two difficulty settings could only be found in a very small number of one-off Dungeons, and they offered players the opportunity to obtain extraordinary loot. However, in return, Asura and God Mode Team Dungeons had a ridiculously high raid difficulty.

In the case of God Mode Team Dungeons, their difficulty was so great that even a team fully composed of titled experts would have trouble securing the First Clear in a short time. So, a team that wasn’t at full occupancy would have even greater trouble.

Currently, while it was true that the Courtyard of Space’s World Mode would offer greater rewards than its God Mode, its raid difficulty would also be much greater. With their team of fewer than 90 players, just how were they supposed to raid it successfully?

“We don’t have a choice,” Frey said as she looked at the teleportation gate enveloped in dark light. “If we don’t enter now, we shouldn’t even consider entering later.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

As soon as Frey finished speaking, Unrestrained Lionheart and everyone else on Frey’s team felt frightening killing intent directed toward them.

The owners of this killing intent had no intentions of hiding their thoughts, so Unrestrained Lionheart and the others could tell that it came from all the players around them. Moreover, it wasn’t limited to just human players but also the distant Holy Race players.

“Kill them! Do not let any of them inside!”

“The World Mode Courtyard of Space is ours!”

Almost simultaneously, the human and Holy Race players in the basin maniacally charged at Frey’s team.

“Let’s head inside as well,” Frey said, giving the oncoming human and Holy Race players a glance before stepping into the teleportation gate after Shi Feng.

Unrestrained Lionheart wryly smiled when he saw this situation. Then, he hurriedly had everyone on the team enter the teleportation gate, not daring to stay in this place even a moment longer.

There was no doubt that the World Mode Courtyard of Space was a treasure trove beyond anyone’s imagination. The various powers naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity get away. Even if the Red Dragon Nation was a pseudo-apex power, the various powers were unlikely to show them any courtesy.

Upon seeing Unrestrained Lionheart and the others disappearing into the teleportation gate, the human and Holy Race players quickly switched their target to each other and began a slaughter outside the Courtyard of Space. Everyone was desperately trying to monopolize and enter the Courtyard of Space.

…

At the same time, the various teams inside the God Mode Courtyard of Space also received news about the Dungeon’s change.

“What did you say?” Moro was stunned by his subordinate’s report. “The Courtyard of Space now has a World Mode option?”

He had never heard of Team Dungeons having a World Mode difficulty setting before.

“What should we do now, Lord Moro?” Desert Web, the Windworld Saint, asked anxiously. “The higher-ups have told us to secure the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s First Clear at all costs, but we’ve already entered the God Mode Courtyard of Space, so we cannot change difficulty settings for an entire week. Meanwhile, Vice Guild Leader Frey’s team is already inside…”

As soon as Desert Web finished speaking, Parker, the Rockspear Saint resting at the side, revealed an ashen complexion.

What was going on here?
