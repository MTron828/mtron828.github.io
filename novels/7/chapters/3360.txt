Chapter 435 – Breaking the Balance

“What did you say? A new Realm has appeared?”

“Are you sure this information is accurate?”

“Quickly contact all teams that are fighting in the Void Sea! Have them find a way to locate the Eternal Realm as soon as possible! We must find it before the other powers do!”

“Hurry up! Contact all members at the Elder rank and above! The Eternal Realm will be ours! We must not let the other upper-ranking hegemonic powers taint it with their hands!”

…

When the various powers learned of the Eternal Realm’s birth, every one of them reacted maniacally. They had their Tier 6 teams, which were originally responsible for campaigning in the Void Sea, abandon their positions to search for the Eternal Realm’s whereabouts. Some powers had even abandoned their fortresses to have more Tier 6 experts hunt for the Eternal Realm.

…

Greater World, Silver Frost City, Green God Corporation’s branch headquarters:

Inside the vice president’s office on the top floor, Xia Qingying, dressed in a suit and seated in an office chair, removed the electronic glasses she wore as hints of shock and joy appeared in her eyes.

“Has there been any good news from the Eternal Chamber of Commerce, Vice President Xia?” Lu Wen, who was sorting through documents on her tablet, curiously asked as she looked at Xia Qingying.

Lu Wen had spent a long time by Xia Qingying’s side as the latter’s confidant. However, rarely would she ever see Xia Qingying make such a pronounced expression.

The last time Xia Qingying had revealed a look of joy on her face was when Black Flame entered the Luminous Glory List. However, compared to that time, Xia Qingying was clearly in even greater excitement and delight right now. There were even hints of shock on her face.

“It is indeed good news! No, great news!” Xia Qingying nodded and smiled. “A new Realm has emerged in the Greater God’s Domain.”

“A new Realm?” Lu Wen was momentarily taken aback. She even dropped her tablet on the floor. “This… How is this possible?”

Lu Wen felt as if Xia Qingying was joking with her.

“Shocking, right?” Xia Qingying smiled when she saw Lu Wen’s reaction. “If this information didn’t come directly from the Eternal Chamber of Commerce, I probably wouldn’t have believed it, either.”

After her initial shock, Lu Wen reacted in pleasant surprise to this piece of news. However, immediately afterward, the joy on her face turned gloomy as she said, “But even if this is true, it will be difficult for us to have any part in it.”

Anyone could understand the potential profits to be harvested from a newly birthed Realm so long as they weren’t a fool. Even apex powers would most likely be tempted into action, let alone conglomerates and upper-ranking hegemonic powers.

Once these major characters made a move, minor characters like the Green God Corporation would have no place in the new Realm. If corporations and ordinary hegemonic powers dared to intervene, they would be instantly eliminated like cannon fodder. After all, the quality and quantity of experts they had were vastly inferior.

Depending on the Eternal Realm’s situation, the only powers qualified to intervene in the new Realm’s affairs would be veteran upper-ranking hegemonic powers and above. Even newly promoted upper-ranking hegemonic powers wouldn’t be qualified to participate in the upcoming struggle.

“It’s not like we don’t have a chance.” The corners of her mouth raising, Xia Qingying said, “Nobody knows of the new Realm’s exact whereabouts yet. If we can occupy some of the new Realm’s Lands and territory ahead of time, even after the new Realm’s location gets discovered, we can potentially hold our ground against the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers.”

“Do you mean to say…” Lu Wen quickly figured out what Xia Qingying was trying to convey.

The Void Sea was boundless. For the various conglomerates and upper-ranking hegemonic powers that knew of the exact locations of the three thousand Realms, they could undoubtedly locate the new Realm much sooner than ordinary corporations and hegemonic powers.

However, there hadn’t been any new Realms appearing since the ancient era. So, even though the various conglomerates and upper-ranking hegemonic powers had a significant advantage, it still wouldn’t be a walk in the park for them to find the new Realm. After all, traversing the Void Sea was a dangerous task even for Tier 6 players, so the search for the new Realm couldn’t progress all too quickly.

But it was a different story for players who were already in the new Realm from the very beginning.

So long as the Green God Corporation could recruit some of those players, it could secure a foothold in the new Realm much sooner than the various conglomerates and upper-ranking hegemonic powers.

“That’s right!” Xia Qingying nodded. Then, in a serious tone, she said, “Lu Wen, I need you to try to secure as much of the corporation’s working capital as possible. We can even give up on some of our Lands. Then, head to the God’s Domain Association and put in a commission saying that the Green God Corporation is willing to purchase the new Realm’s Lands and currency for a high price.”

“Understood!” Lu Wen responded and quickly acted on Xia Qingying’s commands.

Every Realm was composed of numerous kingdoms and empires, which would be composed of numerous towns and cities. The newly birthed Realm should also be using its own currency rather than the common currency adopted by the various other Realms.

So, what they should do now was try to secure as much Land and currency as possible in this new Realm. Although this was a somewhat silly method, it was the only reliable way for ordinary corporations like the Green God Corporation to get a head start in the new Realm.

…

At the same time, when the Greater World’s various corporations and hegemonic powers received news of the Eternal Realm’s situation, some of them took a similar action as the Green God Corporation and started to offer astronomical prices to purchase the Eternal Realm’s Land and currency.

For a time, life seemingly returned to the stagnant Greater God’s Domain as everyone made noise over the newly emerged Realm.

Besides curiosity toward the new Realm, many players looked forward to making it big in the Eternal Realm. It was especially so for the players who were already in the Eternal Realm.

Normally, the various powers would seldom purchase a Realm’s currency. They wouldn’t even bother purchasing the Lands of towns. Instead, they would only spend their money on important Lands in cities.

Even then, most players would have nothing to do with these transactions as the various powers had long monopolized the Lands of the various cities. Individual players had no chance of getting their hands on these Lands, let alone reselling them to make a profit.

However, the various powers of the various Realms were now incredibly generous. Not only were they offering to purchase the Eternal Realm’s currency at astronomical prices, but they were also looking to purchase the Lands of the Eternal Realm’s towns. So long as one could get their hands on a plot of Land in the Eternal Realm, one wouldn’t have to worry about not being able to resell it for a fortune.

Shi Feng was also very happy in regard to this situation. However, different from the Eternal Realm’s players, he still felt that the various corporations and hegemonic powers’ offers were too low.

The resources available in a newly birthed Realm were far superior to the Realms found during the ancient era. Many resources considered incredibly rare during the ancient era could even be found in the Eternal Realm.

An example would be the Eternal Realm’s standard currency.

Unlike the rest of the Greater God’s Domain, the Eternal Realm did not use Mana Coins as its standard currency. Instead, the standard currency here was the Eternal Coin!

Eternal Coins were made using a precious metal called Eternal Adamantite found during the ancient era. In the modern era, the existence of Eternal Adamantite was akin to a myth. Meanwhile, not only could it be used to raise the production success rate of Legendary Weapons and Equipment, but it could also be used to construct Saint-rank Fortresses, Dark-Gold Flying Ships and above, and Dark-Gold Combat Puppets and above.

It should be known that fortresses, flying ships, and combat puppets of these ranks were crucial for powers to reign supreme in a world. Even an existence as mighty as the Galaxy Conglomerate only had a small number of these constructs in its possession. Moreover, they were all items inherited from the ancient era. After all, even if a power managed to get their hands on the design for one of these constructs in the modern era, they couldn’t get their hands on enough Eternal Adamantite to construct any.

However, so long as one could secure enough Eternal Adamantite, producing these war machines would no longer be a dream.
