Chapter 686 – New Generation of Experts

Following the arrival of Crimson Mist, the Level 202, Tier 6 Sword God, all the players in the cavern inadvertently found themselves turning to look at her. Even Fiery Heart was not an exception.

“Incredible! Even though she’s just standing there, I’m having trouble moving in her presence!”

“As expected of one of the top five experts from the most recent S-League. Now that she has advanced to Tier 6, she can probably match the various superpowers’ veteran Tier 6 experts already.”

“Match? I heard that Crimson Mist managed to kill a Tier 6 Fallen Angel with her team just recently for a Legendary Quest, and she obtained a Legendary Sword from the quest. In her current state, she can probably even try to fight Tier 6 Gods of the same level.”

When the crowd in the cavern looked at Crimson Mist, all of them, regardless of gender, wore looks of yearning and worship.

Tier 6 players were as rare as a phoenix’s feather in God’s Domain. They were so rare that not every first-rate Guild would have one. As for the various superpowers, many of them only had one Tier 6 expert. So, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Tier 6 players represented the apex of strength in God’s Domain.

In a situation where veteran Tier 6 experts were operating behind the scenes, Crimson Mist had become a living legend for the general public.

The Crimson Sword? Shi Feng also turned his sight toward Crimson Mist, and he couldn’t help but scrutinize the female Swordsman with crimson, shoulder-length hair.

Shi Feng had heard of Crimson Mist’s name in his previous life. It was some time after his home God’s Domain became fully connected with the Greater God’s Domain, and the owner of this name came from the newest generation of experts of his home God’s Domain.

In that generation, seven individuals stood out the most, and the public regarded them as the Three Gods and Four Saints.

Meanwhile, one of the Three Gods was none other than Crimson Mist, the Crimson Sword.

Because Shi Feng had been busy evading Demon’s Gate’s pursuit in his previous life, he had only ever heard of Crimson Mist before. He never met her in person, and the only information he had on her was of her achievements in the Greater God’s Domain.

More specifically, Crimson Mist appeared in 10th place on the Starlight Realm’s Tier 6 Rookie List shortly after she entered the Greater God’s Domain. And if not for the Eternal Glory adventurer team lacking resources, she could have even squeezed herself into the top five.

While Shi Feng was sifting through his memories, Crimson Mist walked to the middle of the cavern and scanned the players around her. Then, she loudly announced, “Eternal Glory is hosting an escort to the Ruined Temple! We are charging 30 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal per player! We are accepting only 92 players! Anyone above Level 190, Tier 4 can apply!”

Crimson Mist’s voice was indifferent, but it gave off a powerful sense of security. She made it sound like a trip to the Ruined Mountain Range’s central area was no different than a casual stroll down a street.

Meanwhile, as soon as Crimson Mist finished speaking, the crowd in the cavern quickly erupted into commotion.

“The Crimson Sword is escorting players?”

“As expected of the Crimson Sword! She’s starting with a 100-man team right off the bat! The average Tier 6 expert simply can’t compete against her!”

“Goddess! I want to apply!”

Many experts were overjoyed to hear Crimson Mist offering to escort players to the Ruined Temple. Many Tier 5 experts also couldn’t help but be impressed when they heard her hosting a 100-man team.

The situation in the Ruined Mountain Range’s inner and central areas was unlike in other maps, where a team’s safety would increase with size. On the contrary, the larger a team was, the more danger it would be in. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This was because the Ruined Mountain Range’s monsters were highly intelligent, and they would never blindly attack any player they encountered. Instead, they would first observe their opponents, and they would only attack if they had a numerical advantage. If they didn’t, they would call for reinforcements until they had enough numbers to overwhelm their opponents.

Hence, players seeking to travel to the Ruined Temple would usually only form 50-man teams. This was also the ideal team size that many experts had concluded from their experience.

Yet, Crimson Mist had chosen to lead a 100-man team. Unless she was confident in her strength, there was no way she would do such a thing.

In no time, many players had gone to apply for Crimson Mist’s team. Some Level 200-plus, Tier 5 experts from other teams had even chosen to leave their teams to join Crimson Mist’s team.

Seeing the crowd around Crimson Mist, Crying Blade from the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion hurriedly said to Fiery Heart, “Heart! Let’s quickly go and apply as well! There might not be any spots left for us if we don’t hurry!”

The other Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion members also looked at Fiery Heart, a hint of urgency in their eyes. Although Crimson Mist charged a higher price for her services than Shi Feng, there was no doubt it would be safer if they traveled with her.

However, the Guild’s higher-ups had appointed Fiery Heart as the leader of their team, so she would ultimately decide on which course of action the team would take. This was also why Fiery Heart had taken the initiative to talk to Shi Feng.

“I know what all of you are thinking, but we’ve already concluded our negotiations. We cannot go back on our agreement,” Fiery Heart sternly said as she glared at her teammates.

“I disagree. You might be the leader, but that doesn’t mean you can act selfishly, Heart,” Crying Blade said as he stepped forward. “The Guild has tasked us to head to the Ruined Temple as reinforcements, so we must prioritize our safety above all else. That uncle over there might be a Tier 6 Sword God, but with his low level, how is he any different from us in front of Level 200-plus monsters? If you insist on acting selfishly, I’ll just pay out of my pocket!”

The other Level 200-plus, Tier 5 experts of the team nodded in agreement.

“Crying Blade! I am the leader of this team!” Fiery Heart bellowed.

“You might be the leader, but don’t forget that you’re from the Phoenix Pavilion, while I am from the Heavenly Dragon Pavilion. Also, if you weren’t from the Phoenix Pavilion, do you think you can get selected as the team leader with your strength?” Crying Blade said, sneering. Then, while making his way over to Crimson Mist, he continued, “Regardless, I am heading over there. Whoever wants to stick with that uncle over there can stay!”

The Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion was made up of the Phoenix Pavilion and the Heavenly Dragon Pavilion, and the two were in a competitive relationship with each other. If not for the current Guild Leader being the Phoenix Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, Fiery Heart could have never become the leader of the operation this time.

Subsequently, over half of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion’s members left with Crying Blade to join Crimson Mist’s team without hesitation. Unfortunately, Fiery Heart could do nothing but watch as this happened.

The Heavenly Dragon Pavilion’s current Pavilion Master was constantly at loggerheads with the current Guild Leader. As a result, the Heavenly Dragon Pavilion’s members were no longer as accommodating toward the Phoenix Pavilion’s members.

Not to mention, the command to head to the Ruined Temple didn’t come directly from the Guild Leader this time. Instead, it came from the Guild’s executives, and the command was only for them to reach the Ruined Temple as quickly as possible. Although the Guild’s executives had appointed Fiery Heart as the team’s leader out of respect for the Guild Leader, she didn’t hold absolute authority over the team.

Not a single Level 200-plus, Tier 5 expert stayed? When Fiery Heart saw that only sixteen members stayed behind, her complexion turned incredibly ugly.
