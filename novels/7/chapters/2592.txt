Chapter 2593 – Extraordinary Tower’s Third Floor Unlocked

The instant Shi Feng chose to unlock the Extraordinary Tower’s third floor, 1,000,000 Magic Crystals disintegrated inside his bag, transforming into a stream of Mana that flowed into the tower itself.

As the torrent of Mana flowed into the Extraordinary Tower, the carved divine runes on the inner walls lit up and repaired themselves.

While the divine runes became more complete, the tower’s exterior changed significantly.

With the Extraordinary Tower in the center, the violent Mana that filled the Lost Town began to obey. The Mana around the tower became denser, and the tower itself released an old, sacred aura that spread throughout the town, instilling anyone it touched with serenity.

“What an amazing aura! My hunger’s even disappeared!”

“That’s not all. My mind feels much clearer, and my Stamina and Concentration have begun to recover, as well. I feel like I can fight these ghosts for an entire day without rest.”

As the sacred aura filled the town, Zero Wing’s fighting members rejoiced.

They had been at an absolute disadvantage against their ghost counterparts, and they had known death was only a matter of time. The foreign energy was corroding their bodies too quickly. However, the situation had changed. Although their surroundings still lacked any elemental Mana other than ice, this sacred aura had cleansed the area of foreign energy. As a result, their minds had cleared during their fight, which would prolong their survival.

Meanwhile, every ghost had spawned with a Mana Life buff, which indicated their remaining lifespan and only had a 6- hour duration. If they could last against these phantoms for more than 6 hours, the ghosts would automatically disappear, even if they couldn’t defeat them. In addition, Shi Feng had informed them that these ghosts only appeared for each player once a day. If they held on for the full six hours, they could spend the rest of their day resting easy in the Lost Town.

Of course, players who wanted to dedicate themselves to growing stronger, especially those with high combat standards, wouldn’t be satisfied with six hours of training. As a result, these players cherished their six-hour combat session even more than the rest.

Moreover, ghosts wouldn’t appear for everyone. At the end of the day, these ghosts’ appearances were the result of a curse. The stronger a player was, the less effective the curse would be. Ghosts might not even appear for the stronger players and would almost never appear for players who had already unlocked their Mana Bodies’ full potential.

While everyone was surprised and elated about the new changes to the Lost Town, the Extraordinary Tower’s sacred aura had finally filled the town. At the same time, a translucent barrier formed around the Lost Town, isolating it completely. This barrier also calmed the violent, ice-type Mana in the town, creating a stable Mana environment. The Mana wasn’t very dense, but it was enough to clear the players’ minds of unhelpful thoughts.

“What did the Guild Leader do?” Aqua Rose was shocked when she sensed the changes. She had felt this strange sensation before. To be precise, she had experimented with it during her travels within the Starlight Fortress’s Legacy Gate!

The only difference was the town’s much lower Mana density, which resulted in a much smaller boost to her mental capacity. Overall, the Lost Town’s training efficiency was barely one-third of the Legacy Gate’s.

Even so, that was astounding!

The Lost Town could accommodate far more players than the Legacy Gate, and while it wouldn’t be quite as helpful, it was an ideal training ground for Tier 3 players as they tried to unlock their Mana Bodies.

Moreover, the magic barrier substantially increased the town’s defenses. With the barrier in place, defeating the monster tides would be far easier.

While Aqua Rose and Zero Wing’s other members fortunate enough to enter the Legacy Gate were shocked over the Lost Town’s transformation, something else within the Extraordinary Tower had shocked Shi Feng.

This is the result of unlocking the Extraordinary Tower’s third floor? He was at a loss as he sensed the ancient aura filling the hall.

Normally, only in ancient fortresses could contain all seven Mana elements, yet the Extraordinary Tower brimmed with all of them. Moreover, the Mana here was even denser than in the Starlight Fortress...

If Tier 3 players trained here, breaking past the 100% threshold would no longer be just a dream, not to mention fully unlocking their Mana Bodies.

He had been worried about crossing that threshold himself, but the tower’s new environment had just increased his chances by 10%. If his chances had only increased by 10%, others would have an even greater boost.

If players who hadn’t yet unlocked their Mana Bodies’ full potential trained in the Extraordinary Tower, they could definitely accomplish the task in a short time. In fact, their training efficiency here might be twice as high as it was against the humanoid ghosts. Fighting in an area with all seven Mana elements would yield completely different results than fighting in an area with almost none of them. Players would have a much easier time recognizing and controlling the flow of Mana in the former.

Unfortunately, while this environment was idyllic, there was a limit to the number of players who could take advantage of it.

This Mana was contained in the Extraordinary Tower’s training grounds. The first floor could only accommodate 100 people at a time, while 50 could fit on the second floor, and only 10 would fit on the third. In total, only 160 people could use the Extraordinary Tower at the same time.

That was only under ideal circumstances. In reality, far fewer players could train in the Extraordinary Tower at a time.

If players wanted to use the second or third floors, they’d have to clear the previous floors first.

Shi Feng didn’t give the matter much thought before he instructed Zero Wing’s main force members to train in the tower during their free time and to ignore level grinding and raiding monster dens.

Unlocking their Mana Bodies was far more important than raiding monster dens and level grinding. Furthermore, they had unlocked a considerable percentage of their Mana Bodies after consuming the Exotic Legacy Potions they had obtained from Poison City. Normally, unlocking their Mana Bodies would require, at most, two full weeks, but with the tower’s third floor unlocked, they could accomplish the feat in even less time.

Once all of Zero Wing’s main force members unlocked their Mana Bodies’ full potential, the team’s grinding efficiency would improve. Securing the Demonwolf den that housed the medium teleportation point would also become easier.

With his Guildmates desperately training, Shi Feng made his way to the tower’s second floor to begin his ascent.

He had reached his limit during his last visit to the Extraordinary Tower’s second floor, unable to improve further regardless of how hard he had tried. Even after creating Sword’s Transmigration, he hadn’t been able to reach the top of the second floor’s staircase and had been thrown after reaching the 30th step.

Now, however, he had fully unlocked his Mana Body and gained a newfound understanding of Mana. He had even learned a Mana Technique, and he was ready to challenge the second floor again to push himself through that final barrier.

Neither his Tier 4 Promotion Quest nor the Divine Dragon’s trial would be easy to complete. If he failed, he would suffer unimaginable consequences. Fortunately, both trials focused on testing players’ individual strength.

Advancing through the Realms of Truth would undoubtedly provide immense help in both upcoming trials. This was why he had decided to activate the Extraordinary Tower’s third floor now. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Controlling his emotions, Shi Feng climbed the first step on the second floor’s staircase. Two silver-armored Swordsmen then appeared, charging at him with the intent to kill.

As Shi Feng made his way to the Extraordinary Tower’s third floor, a group of Level 110 experts arrived before Stone Forest City’s gates, causing a commotion at the city’s main entrance.

“So, this is Zero Wing’s Stone Forest City?” an elegant, middle-aged man amidst the group commented as he gazed at the magnificent city before him. With a surprised tone, he continued, “It is truly extraordinary. With such dense Mana and natural terrain advantage, Wonder should’ve grown much stronger here.”

“Don’t forget our orders, Elder Hermit. We are not here to sightsee,” a bald, middle-aged man in black robes scolded, rolling his eyes. “No matter how much stronger she’s grown, Wonder must return with us. The time for her willful rebellion has come to an end!”

“I know. Isn’t that why I tagged along in the first place?” Hermit replied. Instead of getting upset at the bald man’s comment, he breathed a deep sigh as he led his team into Stone Forest City.
