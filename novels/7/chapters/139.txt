Chapter 140 - Shadow Leopard King

The Shadow Leopard King was a Level 8 Chieftain Ranked monster. As long as its HP fell below 50%, it would enter a berserk state. Both its Attack Power and Attack Speed would then increase by 20%, and even an MT geared with a full set of Level 5 Set Equipment could hold it off.

“Guardian Knights, pay attention to cast Protection Blessing on the Shield Warriors. Shield Warriors, prepare to activate Shield Wall at any time. As long as we can endure its berserk period, we will be victorious,” Unstable Devastation knew about the berserk state; hence, he hurriedly gave commands as he saw the Shadow Leopard King’s HP reaching 50%.

Protection Blessing could reduce the damage an ally received by 50%.

A Shield Warrior’s Shield Wall could also reduce damage by 50%.

With both effects stacked, the Shield Warrior would only receive 25% of the total damage. Even if the Shadow Leopard King went berserk, the Shield Warrior could hold it off completely.

Finally, the Shadow Leopard King’s HP dropped below the 50% threshold.

“Aooo!” the Shadow Leopard King bellowed, its body abruptly expanding.

Everything was within Unstable Devastation’s grasp. Just as he was about to reveal a victorious smile, the situation suddenly changed.

At this moment, the Shadow Leopard King summoned two more Level 8 Elite Ranked Shadow Leopards, each of them possessing 3,000 HP. The two new arrivals roared as they abruptly pounced, arriving behind the healers on the backline. Before any of these healers could react, the two Shadow Leopards pinned them to the ground.

“Shift focus! Get rid of these two Elite Shadow Leopards first!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Unstable Devastation’s expression turned grim. Just after he finished speaking, the Elite Shadow Leopards annihilated two of their healers.

However, the Level 9 branch leaders were not to be trifled with. Just after the two Elite Shadow Leopards killed the healers, they moved into position to fend off the attacks of these two monsters, preventing the damage from extending any further.

However, with the loss of two healers, the pressure the core MT faced greatly increased. Even with Protection Blessing and Shield Wall, every attack he received from the Shadow Leopard King exceeded over -300 points. On the other hand, his own HP did not even exceed 1,200 points. Moreover, the Attack Speed of the Shadow Leopard King was very quick. If it were not for him constantly dodging its attacks, he might have long since died already.

Just with the Shadow Leopard King going berserk, Martial Union had lost over five players in the blink of an eye. The Shadow Leopard King’s tail swipe took out three melee players. All three were instantly thrown and died while in mid-air.

“Hold on for a little longer. Its berserk period will be over soon.” Watching his team members die, one after another, Unstable Devastation became very depressed and annoyed. The players he had brought with him were all elites, and every death was a huge loss to Martial Union. Fortunately, they could revive these players, greatly reducing the lost EXP.

However, as long as they could kill the Shadow Leopard King, all of the losses would be worth it.

Just when everyone from Martial Union thought the situation had stabilized, Shi Feng’s doppelganger used Wind Blade, arriving behind a Cursemancer.

The Cursemancer had completely concentrated on the Shadow Leopard King, chanting incantations. He paid no attention to the surrounding situation at all.

Due to all of Gale Valley falling under Martial Union’s control, the risk of an ambush was nonexistent. Hence, the Cursemancer was very much at ease.

However, such a way of thinking was a big mistake.

After the doppelganger’s sword pierced through the Cursemancer’s back, it then followed up with a Chop to the Cursemancer’s head. The doppelganger followed up with another normal attack. Although the doppelganger only possessed 50% of the original body’s Attributes, just 50% of Shi Feng’s Attributes was terrifying. It could compare to a Level 10 Swordsman geared with a complete set of Level 10 Bronze Set Equipment. Moreover, the doppelganger’s target Cursemancer was only Level 7, wearing only Level 4 and 5 Bronze Equipment. The difference between them was like the difference between heaven and earth.

In the blink of an eye, three damages of -189, -468, and -266 appeared above the Cursemancer’s head. Shi Feng’s doppelganger instantly killed the Cursemancer whose HP was less than 700 points.

The Cursemancer’s death quickly alerted the other mage classes.

“Someone’s kill-stealing[1]!” an Elementalist shouted, startled.

The surrounding mages all felt a heavy pressure weighing down on them. This intruder finished off a Level 7 Cursemancer in just three moves. If this mysterious Swordsman closed in on them, only death awaited.

Without delay, Shi Feng’s doppelganger used Thundering Flash. Three streaks of lightning arced towards the nearest four mages, immediately sending all four of them into a fright. Among them, two Elementalists instantly reacted, using Blink to dodge the lightning. Meanwhile, the Cursemancer, who did not possess Blink, threw himself to the ground, barely avoiding the attack. However, the last of the four mages, the Summoner, was not as fortunate. As he was closest to the attack, even though he, too, attempted to dodge, he was late by a breath. Without a hint of suspense, the Level 5 Thunder Flash instantly fried him to a crisp.

Although the doppelganger only managed to kill a Summoner, a smile appeared on its face.

The goal of this Thundering Flash was not to kill someone but to open a path. At this moment, there were no obstructions between Shi Feng’s doppelganger and Martial Union’s healers.

The doppelganger activated Windwalk, dashing over. As long as it killed one or two more healers, Martial Union’s entire team would fall into a huge predicament.

“Don’t even think about killing the healers!”

At this moment, Ironsword Lion used Windblade and rushed to block the doppelganger. The swords from both parties collided, and as they attacked, they maintained their Extraordinary States, battling with four sword images each.

The doppelganger could not help but halt its momentum, forced to block the attacks.

After exchanging several moves, Ironsword Lion was incomparably shocked. He felt that the Swordsman, whose information displayed as ‘Unknown,’ facing him was a powerhouse. This mysterious Swordsman actually blocked all of his attacks. Moreover, every time their swords collided, Ironsword Lion could feel an immense weight bearing down on him, causing both his arms to go numb. Occasionally, there were even few sudden stabs aimed at his vitals, forcing him to activate Defensive Blade to block.

“Ironsword, it seems that you have truly fallen. You can’t even get rid of an average player trying to kill-steal,” a Level 9 Berserker geared in silver-gray battle armor snidely remarked.

“Crap. Five Rats, you come try, if you have the ability!” Originally, he was already greatly aggrieved due to the constant pressure from Shi Feng’s doppelganger, and his HP constantly fell. Now that he received jeers on top of it, he immediately enraged.

“Since you want me to join, then I’ll join!” the Level 9 Berserker, Five Rats, used Charge at Shi Feng’s doppelganger.

Charge carried with it a Fainted effect. Moreover, the surrounding mages were already in the midst of chanting incantations for their spells, sending Fireballs and Frost Arrows at the doppelganger.

The doppelganger activated Defensive Blade. It dodged the incoming magical attacks while it gradually closed in on Martial Union’s healers.

The Level 2 Defensive Blade aided the doppelganger in mitigating the damage from the attacks it received.

However, Five Rats followed up his Charge with a Break, greatly reducing the doppelganger’s speed.

“You three, get rid of him,” Unstable Devastation commanded the three Assassins, pointing. He did not have the time to think about an idiot who was attempting to kill-stealing a team with around 40 players remaining.

After receiving the command, the there Assassins immediately rushed at Shi Feng’s doppelganger.

Receiving the focused fire of over a dozen players, although the doppelganger managed to dodge a majority of the attacks, it still received a relatively significant amount of damage. The doppelganger’s HP continuously fell, and within a moment, only 30% remained.

“Hahaha! I didn’t think that it would be a fat fish with brain problems!” Judging on the exchanges made and damage caused, Five Rats determined that this mysterious Swordsman’s equipment was exceptional. As long as he could kill the Swordsman, he would definitely drop a lot of good equipment.

The reason Five Rats thought so was that a single normal attack from the mysterious Swordsman dealt him around -100 damage. Meanwhile, his normal attacks also chipped away 100 of the Swordsman’s HP. However, the problem lay in the fact that the mysterious Swordsman used a one-handed sword, while he used a two-handed sword.

In God’s Domain, a two-handed weapon’s Attack Power was much higher than that of a one-handed weapon, and the damage a two-handed weapon caused was normally around twice that of a one-handed weapon. Due to the strong power stored within a two-handed weapon, every attack from the weapon could cause a devastating amount of damage. Meanwhile, the damage a one-handed weapon could cause was much less. However, its Attack Speed was much quicker. As a result, the average amount of damage dealt by both weapons, in the long run, was about the same.

However, Five Rats had only managed to deal -100 damage to the mysterious Swordsman. It showed just how good the mysterious Swordsman’s equipment was.

Unfortunately, it is still too little... It would be great if they could send more people over. In the distance, hidden within a bush, Shi Feng was slightly depressed as he saw that a dozen or so players attacked his doppelganger. He bitterly thought, Forget it; I shouldn’t be too greedy. I should reel in the net, now.

Abruptly, Shi Feng’s doppelganger burst with power. It suddenly leaped into the air. The Abyssal Blade in the doppelganger’s hand then started to emit flames and thunder, immediately releasing a blast of elements towards the most crowded location.

TL Notes:

[1]kill-stealing(KS): In multiplayer video games, particularly in MOBAs, first-person shooters, MMORPGs and MUDs, kill stealing is the practice of obtaining credit for killing an enemy, when another player has put more effort into the kill. This usually happens when a game only keeps track of which player defeats an enemy. If one player whittles down some enemy’s health points, but a different player eventually finishes the enemy off, this second player might obtain all of the loot or experience points from the enemy. Kill stealing is common when the rewards for finishing enemies off is highly desired within the game. (Source: Wikipedia)
