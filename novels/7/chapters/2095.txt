Chapter 2096 – Vicious Black Flame

The confidence Starlink’s members had displayed vanished as Shi Feng’s eight doppelgangers joined the fray. At the same time, fear surfaced in their eyes as Starlink’s members looked at Shi Feng’s doppelgangers.

The nearby spectators’ eyes nearly fell from their sockets when they saw this.

“Crap! Is this real?!”

“Cheating! He is definitely cheating!”

Many experts watching from a distance couldn’t help but shout in indignation.

The Zero Wing members watching from outside of the battlefield, however, began to cheer.

“All hail the Guild Leader!”

“Zero Wing for the win!”

No one had held a favorable view of Zero Wing when this competition had begun. Some had even been certain that Zero Wing would perish after this, and everyone had mocked the Guild. Now, however, would anyone dare question Zero Wing’s superiority?

A special Doppelganger Skill? Sword Demon’s expression twisted as he observed Shi Feng’s doppelgangers.

He had already struggled against Shi Feng alone. After all, the younger Swordsman’s Basic Attributes were higher than his. If not for the significant Strength and speed boost his special weapon provided, Shi Feng would’ve already defeated him.

Yet, now, he had to face nine identical copies of this troublesome Swordsman...

He might not have been worried if these copes had been ordinary doppelgangers. If that were the case, their Basic Attributes would be far lower than the original’s. At most, these doppelgangers might have slowed him down a little, which would be annoying, but from what Sword Demon could sense, these doppelganger’s Attributes rivaled his own. Sword Demon felt an intense pressure from each clone, which meant that Shi Feng had just gained eight more monster-level experts.

Of course, this was the best-case scenario for Shi Feng. If Sword Demon actually continued this fight, it would be a different story. After all, everyone’s attention span was limited. Even if Shi Feng were a Domain Realm expert, he couldn’t perfectly control all eight doppelgangers and fight. Controlling a doppelganger was far more complex than controlling one’s body. Controlling a single doppelganger perfectly was the limit for a Domain Realm expert. Controlling more would affect the doppelganger’s performance.

However, even if Shi Feng couldn’t control all eight doppelgangers perfectly, he shouldn’t have a problem exhibiting Flowing Water Realm combat standards with them. With his ridiculously high Basic Attributes, each of his doppelgangers could face a peak expert of the same level.

In other words, Zero Wing’s party had suddenly gained another eight peak experts. Unfortunately, Starlink only had a total of five peak experts on Battlefield No. 1, and the strongest of them, Tengu, had already been killed. This left Starlink with only four peak experts, and the remaining members were only Refinement Realm and Flowing Water Realm experts.

Overall, Starlink was now at a massive disadvantage.

Even Wind Demon gulped nervously as he watched Shi Feng.

Who is this kid? Wind Demon wondered as he stared at the young Swordsman in confusion.

Not only had Shi Feng successfully reached the Domain Realm at such a young age, but he had also amassed absurdly high Basic Attributes. Now, he had revealed a Doppelganger Skill that defied common sense. No matter how Wind Demon considered the situation, he couldn’t believe it. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

No individual player could easily obtain Shi Feng’s weapons, equipment, or Skills. Acquiring any of these required an astronomical amount of resources and manpower. The Four Shadow Demons had only even secured their current weapons, equipment, and Skills thanks to Starlink’s help. However, Shi Feng had collected such items by relying on a Guild that only controlled one kingdom’...

Amazing! With this, Starlink is finished in Battlefield No. 1! Mu Cheng balled his fists in delight as he glanced at Blindman.

He had been worried for Zero Wing, and if not for Blindman’s interference, he would’ve jumped into this battle to help the Guild. However,Blindman’s efforts had gone to waste with this new development.

Just as Shi Feng was about to attack Starlink’s members, a low voice reached his ears.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, don’t be so quick to act!”Blackwater’s Jing Yang called out•”丫ou’ve already proven Zero Wing’s strength. I doubt anyone will continue to oppose Zero Wing’s participation in this competition for energy crystals, so do you need to exterminate them all?”

“What are you trying to say?” Shi Feng asked as he eyed Jing Yang, who wore aqua-blue robes and carried a glowing, golden staff.

Jing Yang had made no effort to hide his equipment’s glowing effects, so Shi Feng knew that the man carried four pieces of Epic Equipment in total. Although Shi Feng couldn’t discern what rank Jing Yang’s staff was, he guessed that it was at least Epic rank based on its aura. Moreover, Jing Yang wore a complete Level 65 Fine-Gold Set Equipment, which even the various superpowers struggled to collect.

Level 65 Fine-Gold Set Equipment was far more difficult to acquire than Level 60 Dark-Gold Set Equipment at this stage of the game. Not even Starlink had a complete set. Naturally, a Level 65 Fine-Gold set had even higher Basic Attribute bonuses than Level 60 Dark-Gold Set Equipment.

The Mana fluctuations around Jing Yang were even stronger than those around Wilting Netherworld, and his combat standards were likely stronger than hers. He had reached the Void Realm more than a decade ago, and although Wilting Netherworld was a prodigy, she would need more time before she could catch up to Jing Yang.

“Starlink only acted in compliance with the rules our superpowers agreed to. If Guild Leader Black Flame is earnest in moving against Starlink, the rest of us won’t just sit back and watch. I hope you can understand this,” Jing Yang said, smiling.

Jing Yang’s words left everyone stunned. They had never expected this battle to take such a drastic turn.

“Blackwater is too shameless! It didn’t step forward when Starlink was about to annihilate Zero Wing, but now that Zero Wing has the upper hand, it wants to interfere. Since when have Blackwater and Starlink had such a good relationship?”

“Zero Wing is in trouble now. Such a powerful Doppelganger Skill definitely has a very long Cooldown. If Zero Wing misses this opportunity to take out Starlink, it isn’t likely that the Guild will find another chance.”

“Zero Wing is so unlucky. If it hadn’t provoked Blackwater, the Guild likely wouldn’t have interfered today.”

For a time, the various major powers either pitied or mocked Zero Wing’s situation.

“Melody, I advise that you give up any hope for Zero Wing. Zero Wing might have the strength to resist a superpower, but it has provoked too many. Zero Wing can’t survive in God’s Domain for long. This situation is the best proof. Just before Zero Wing emerges victorious in this fight, Blackwater steps in. Zero Wing has no chance of winning White River City’s Auction House,” Evil Judgment said, chuckling when he saw Melody’s enraged expression.

Blackwater was no weaker than Starlink, and although it hadn’t sent as many experts to this competition, it had nearly as many experts fighting for the Auction House as Starlink. Including Jing Yang, Blackwater had four peak experts and seven Refinement Realm and Flowing Water Realm experts on Battlefield No. 1. In addition, the Guild had the Domain Realm expert, South Time, the man standing behind Jing Yang.

Although South Time had only recently reached the Domain Realm, he was still a monster-level expert. His participation would be more than enough to turn the tides of the battle between Starlink and Zero Wing.

If Zero Wing missed this opportunity to eliminate Starlink’s members, it wouldn’t encounter another. Regardless of what Shi Feng decided, Zero Wing was guaranteed to lose White River City.

“Understand?” Shi Feng could not help but laugh. “You think you qualify to stop me?”

Suddenly, Shi Feng vanished.Before anyone could react, he reappeared before Jing Yang, his Killing Ray releasing a brilliant blue glow.

Tier 2 Taboo Skill, Instant Strike!

A streak of blue light flew toward Jing Yang’s throat, and the man panicked at the sudden attack. Shi Feng’s attack was so fast that he didn’t even have time to activate Blink. Just before the blue light bit into the man, his golden staff released a golden light, instantly creating a barrier of light around Jing Yang.

Seeing this barrier, Jing Yang could not help but breathe out a sigh of relief.

The Passive Skill, Three Pillars Barrier, had created this light barrier. The ability triggered automatically when its wielder faced a lethal attack. When activated, the Skill created a magic barrier that negated 90% of all attacks’ damage for three seconds. It also increased his Defense by 300%, raising his Defense to rival an MT’s of the same level. It was an amazing Lifesaving Skill that had a one-hour Cooldown, and with it, even Grand Lords would struggle to kill him.

However, the moment after Jing Yang sighed, Shi Feng’s attack struck.

The light barrier cracked, and Jing Yang instantly lost one-third of his HP.

The man paled with IVight. Although he immediately tried to escape by using Blink, Shi Feng’s Twilight Blade had already begun its descent.

When the second slash landed, Jing Yang’s HP dropped to zero in an instant without the protection of the Three Pillars Barrier. His body only teleported 20 yards away after Jing 丫ang’s vision began to darken. He then collapsed and disintegrated into countless particles of light...
