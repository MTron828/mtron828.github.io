Flame Dragon God’s Treasury, Central Plaza:

The central plaza was the size of several stadiums. Sometime after the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key disappeared, the ten pseudo-apex powers had amassed a force of over 50,000 inside the plaza.

After grinding in the Flame Dragon God’s Nest for over a week, these pseudo-apex power members had all reached Level 230 at the very least. Over 20% of them had even reached Level 235 or higher. Currently, these pseudo-apex powers’ members formed a tight encirclement around the players in the plaza.

Meanwhile, the core executives of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s ten pseudo-apex powers had gathered at the edge of the magic barriers. The sight of these core executives made the independent players and members of various conglomerates extremely anxious and helpless.

“There are only ten pseudo-apex powers in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, and all ten have gathered for the Access Key. Are we doomed this time?”

“Don’t despair just yet. Before they come to a conclusion, we still have hope of making it out alive.”

“Dammit! I’m one of Primordial Rock Holy City’s top ten experts! Why do I have to leave my fate in the hands of these powers?!”

“So what if you’re one of Primordial Rock Holy City’s top ten experts? Don’t you see the people there? They are all members of conglomerates. Together, they represent over twenty conglomerates. Even though these conglomerates have more members gathered outside the barriers than the pseudo-apex powers, do you see them resisting? Aren’t they still like us? They can only let their members wait for the pseudo-apex powers’ verdict.”

The players trapped in the magic barriers all stared at the Advanced Tent, where the core executives of the ten pseudo-apex powers had gathered, their anxiety levels reaching an all-time high.

The ten pseudo-apex powers’ core executives were powerful individuals who could single-handedly influence the harmony in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. It had been centuries since all ten pseudo-apex powers had last gathered for a meeting. Yet, they were unfortunate to be involved in such a rare event. This was an absolute disaster for them.

If the ten pseudo-apex powers were adamant about having everyone inside the barrier hand over their possessions, they would have to comply or be permanently erased from God’s Domain. Even members of various conglomerates would not escape unscathed.

…

Inside the Advanced Tent…

The representatives of the ten pseudo-apex powers sat around a round table, each accompanied by one or two bodyguards. Among those present, the ones from the Dragon God Palace and Red-Tailed Dragon stood out the most.

Ember Dragon was the Dragon God Palace’s representative this time. Although he was only Level 237, the bandaged young man and demidragon woman who flanked him were terrifying. In addition to being Level 240, both were equipped with at least five Divine Artifacts, with the rest of their equipment comprising Fragmented Divine Artifacts.

Meanwhile, Tarnished Wind, a giant of a man, was Red-Tailed Dragon’s representative. He was Level 240 and fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. He was also the Red-Tailed Dragon’s designated successor. Although he only had one bodyguard, the man beside him was a Level 241 High Elf fully equipped with Divine Artifacts.

After the Dragon God Palace’s and Red-Tailed Dragon’s groups, Holy Dragon Spear’s group stood out the most. Great Commander South Lake, who had risen to Level 240 after grinding in the secret land, represented the adventurer team, and standing beside him was Apocalypse.

“So, what should we do with those people?” The eight-meter-tall Tarnished Wind took the initiative to break the silence. “While having them surrender their belongings is a good solution, many of them are core members of conglomerates. If we confiscate their items, those conglomerates will be dissatisfied.”

“So what if they’re dissatisfied? Do you think they can topple us?” Cloud Rider, the Divine Wing Dynasty’s Guild Leader and a Level 240 player equipped with seven Divine Artifacts, said disdainfully. “The secret land’s Access Key is at stake here. While those 17 key suspects are the most suspicious, we can’t guarantee they didn’t transfer the Access Key to someone else. Rather than risk it, we might as well confiscate everyone’s items.”

“I disagree,” South Lake said, shaking his head. “We are talking about offending every conglomerate in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Have you forgotten that they comprise a significant portion of our Mental Strength Potion supply? They might not be able to do anything against us in God’s Domain, but they can reduce or even outright stop supplying potions to us. Are you sure you can afford such a loss?”

“Great Commander South Lake, what you say makes sense,” Ember Dragon said, chuckling. “But this secret land is paramount. We can always find other suppliers of Mental Strength Potions, but there is only one Flame Dragon God’s Nest. If we lose it, I doubt we’ll ever find another secret land like it. Also, as Guild Leader Cloud Rider said, the people inside the magic barriers can transfer items among themselves. So, whether it is the conglomerates’ or our members, I suggest confiscating everyone’s items. This is the safest solution.”

“Are you out of your mind, Ember Dragon?! Every player in God’s Domain has their secrets!” South Lake bellowed. “Also, we have been taking turns guarding the magic barriers, and it is currently Holy Dragon Spear’s turn to guard them! Do you intend to confiscate the items of all of Holy Dragon Spear’s members?!”

“Why the need to be so angry, Great Commander South Lake?” Cloud Rider said nonchalantly. “There may be more of your members caught up in the mix, but Vice Guild Leader Ember is doing so out of consideration for all of us here. Not to mention, it’s not like we won’t return their items after inspecting them. All we want is the Access Key. None of us are interested in anything else.”

The representatives of the other pseudo-apex powers nodded in agreement, none expressing any additional opinions.

Although ten pseudo-apex powers operated in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, they weren’t equal in strength. Now that the first-ranked Dragon God Palace and the second-ranked Red-Tailed Dragon were confronting each other while the fifth-ranked Holy Dragon Spear and sixth-ranked Divine Wing Dynasty had taken sides, the other powers couldn’t afford to speak their minds at all.

“Does that mean you will show the items in your spatial bags to everyone, Guild Leader Cloud?” South Lake asked sarcastically.

Players in God’s Domain, particularly executives of the various powers, all had secrets they didn’t want others to know. These secrets were usually unsafe to keep in warehouses and could only be carried in personal spatial bags. Needless to say, the Guild Leader of a pseudo-apex power would be carrying plenty of such secrets, such as offensive trump cards and lifesaving measures. Outside of critical situations, these secrets would never be revealed.

“I wasn’t present in the plaza at the time of the incident like your adventurer team’s chosen ones, so why should I show you my possessions?” Cloud Rider sneered. “Or perhaps Holy Dragon Spear has acquired the Access Key after all? Is that why you are constantly resisting?!”

“Don’t you dare slander me!” South Lake bellowed, glaring at Cloud Rider.

“I agree with Great Commander South Lake’s opinion. Everyone has their secrets. I am against having so many innocent people expose their secrets,” Tarnished Wind spoke in support of South Lake.

Tarnished Wind’s words put the other pseudo-apex powers’ representatives in a bind. They didn’t know whether to continue supporting Cloud Rider. After all, should Red-Tailed Dragon go crazy, they would suffer.

“How about we each take a step back,” Ember Dragon suggested suddenly. “We won’t have everyone surrender their belongings anymore, but you must stop worrying about the various conglomerates’ members, Great Commander South Lake. We just need to permanently kill everyone besides our members and the innocent conglomerates’ members. That way, we can minimize the possibility of the Access Key being stolen and thoroughly avoid offending the various conglomerates. We will vote by a show of hands, and the minority will obey the majority.”

Before South Lake could say anything…

“The Hundred Dragon Assembly supports the proposal!”

“The Moonlight Family supports the proposal!”

…

In no time, more than half of the pseudo-apex powers present had voiced their support for Ember Dragon’s proposal. This situation caused South Lake’s expression to turn ugly. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do about it.
