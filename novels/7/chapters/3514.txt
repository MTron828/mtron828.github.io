Chapter 589 – King’s Treasure

“What’s going on? Someone’s actually attacking the Crystal City?”

“What?! Chaos Spear?! Who’s using a Tier 6 Super Spell on the city?!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s over! We’re all done for!”

When the Chaos Spear’s dominating aura spread across the Crystal City of Secrets, many of the city’s players failed to recognize the Super Spell, and they couldn’t help but fall into confusion and bewilderment. As for the players who did recognize the Chaos Spear, fear and despair overwhelmed them.

!!

Chaos Spear!

A Tier 6 Super Spell known for rivaling the attacks of Ancient Gods!

One strike from a Chaos Spear could obliterate an entire city and its surrounding region. Even Tier 6 MTs with their Lifesaving Skills activated would get killed on the spot if struck by a Chaos Spear.

In the current situation where none of the Crystal City’s players had even reached Tier 6, there was a considerable chance the Chaos Spear could annihilate everyone’s souls, permanently removing them from God’s Domain.

However, before anyone could think of a response, the Chaos Spear had already made contact with the city’s defensive magic array.

Boom!

A deafening thunder shook the sky, and a powerful impact spread across a radius of several dozen kilometers. The sky also shattered like glass, making it seem like Armageddon had arrived.

However, when the thunder dissipated, both the Crystal City and its inhabitants remained intact, and the players in the city couldn’t help but look up in disbelief.

This was because what originally should have been a devastating attack ended up getting neutralized by the countless divine scripts that hovered above the city. The Chaos Spear didn’t even cause the city to vibrate, let alone damage any of the city’s infrastructure. All the Tier 6 Super Spell managed to accomplish was put on a flashy fireworks show.

That was close.

Shi Feng sighed in relief when he saw the shattered sky above the city. If he hadn’t chosen to teleport back to the Crystal City using the Abyss Workshop Certification right away, he would have absolutely died at the Gorgon Queen’s hands.

He had personally witnessed the strength of Primordial Godkins in his previous life. Random Teleportation Scrolls might work against the average Tier 6 Divine monster, but the concept of distance was of little significance to a monster of the Gorgon Queen’s caliber. It was also why so many experts had died at the hands of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos.

Similar to the space-crossing attack he had previously executed in the Miniature Ancient World, the only way to stop the Gorgon Queen’s attack would be to block it.

Fortunately, he had the Crystal City of Secrets to fall back on.

The Crystal City of Secrets was one of the Eternal Continent’s Seven Great Cities. In his previous life, the Crystal City stood firm even in the face of the Holy Race’s all-out invasion. Apart from a large number of powers and experts operating in the city, the city itself also had various defensive measures created by Ancient Gods. Even if a group of Ancient Gods were to attack the city, it would take them a considerable amount of time to tear down the city’s defenses.

While Shi Feng was feeling relieved, the rest of the Crystal City erupted into chaos. Everyone started discussing the Chaos Spear that attacked the city and the Crystal City’s defensive measures that stopped the Chaos Spear. Many powers also promptly mobilized their forces to investigate why the Crystal City would be suddenly subjected to such a powerful attack.

In God’s Domain, NPC Cities might face occasional monster hordes and siege battles for no reason, but they would never be subjected to an Ancient God’s attack out of the blue. After all, existences capable of launching such attacks all stood at the apex of God’s Domain. Even a simple action from these existences would be considered a major event, let alone launching a direct attack on the crystal City of Secrets.

It should be known that the Crystal City had many Tier 6 NPCs garrisoning it. Moreover, these weren’t your average Tier 6 NPCs. Even the weakest among them was equipped with a Legendary Equipment Set. Paired with the city’s magic array, even Tier 6 Saint-ranked experts shouldn’t think of stirring up a scene in the city.

…

While the Crystal City’s various powers were frantically investigating the unexpected event, Shi Feng quietly returned to Zero Wing’s Residence.

The Residence had undergone significant changes while Shi Feng was away. Not only were there many more Guild members coming and going from the Residence, but the equipment standard of these Guild members had also improved substantially, with many of them having two or three Common Secret Treasures equipped. Compared to most of the Crystal City’s experts, who only had one Common Secret Treasure equipped, Zero Wing’s members were in a vastly better state. They were already close to matching the various pseudo-apex powers’ members.

“You newcomers have some good luck. Boss Fury’s group will be coming along with us to the Underground Crystal Palace this time, and they’ll be taking us to explore the Level 165 zone.”

“The Level 165 zone? I heard that only the various pseudo-apex powers’ elite teams can grind there right now, and they’ve also found quite a few Extraordinary Secret Treasures already!”

“It seems you all are well-informed. For your information, Boss Fury’s group has already located a Boss. If we can successfully raid it, our Guild might get its very first Extraordinary Secret Treasure. Zero Wing will become the sixth Guild to own an Extraordinary Secret Treasure at that time. Everyone involved in the raid will earn a ton of GCPs.”

Currently, a team of players was gathered in the Residence’s courtyard, and one of the Guild’s veteran members proudly introduced the objectives of the team’s upcoming operation, the veteran member’s words stirring the excitement and expectation of the Guild’s new members.

Ever since the first Extraordinary Secret Treasure appeared in the Underground Crystal Palace, every power operating in the Crystal City had ramped up their efforts in exploring the secret land. However, even until now, only a few teams could explore the secret land’s Level 165 zone.

A team not only required players with sufficiently high combat and equipment standards to raid the Level 165 zone’s Bosses, but it also needed enough players capable of blocking the Bosses’ attacks. Otherwise, the more fragile members of the team would get annihilated in no time.

Currently, only a handful of teams operating in the Crystal City could accomplish such a feat. So long as Zero Wing could do so, the Guild would have a stable source of Extraordinary Secret Treasures in the future.

Sixth? Shi Feng couldn’t help but smile when he overheard the conversation of the players in the courtyard. It seems Fury and the others are making great progress.

The Underground Crystal Palace’s Level 165 zone was already an area where only Tier 6 players could delve in. Apart from the various pseudo-apex powers, it would be incredibly difficult for any other power to explore the Level 165 zone at this time.

The fact that Zero Wing could already begin exploring the Level 165 zone showed that the Guild’s teams could already rival the various pseudo-apex powers’ teams.

If Desolate Fury and the others could successfully explore the Level 165 and acquire an Extraordinary Secret Treasure, Zero Wing would become an attractive choice for the Eternal Realm’s various independent experts. It would undoubtedly elevate the Guild’s status to a whole new level. Zero Wing also wouldn’t need to rely on the Secret Crystal Trading Firm’s privileges to retain its members anymore.

After Shi Feng entered the Guild Hall, he made his way to an underground secret room and activated the room’s defensive barrier. It was to prevent players outside the room from affecting or spying on the situation inside.

I took such a big risk this time. I even had to return ahead of time. Let’s hope the treasury’s items won’t be too disappointing.

After taking a deep breath, Shi Feng opened his bag space and took out the five items he looted from the Nameless City’s treasury.

As soon as Shi Feng took out the five items, the space within the room began to shake, and cracks appeared in the room’s defensive barrier. At the same time, streams of Eternal Energy began flowing out of the void and into the room.
