Chapter 338 - Hunted

After easily snapping the chains that bound it, the Mechanical Slayer swung down its serrated greatsword.

Unlike the downward slash it had used at the very beginning of the raid, this swing had sliced apart the air, the greatsword meeting no resistance whatsoever.

The air blades that the slash produced had also become much finer, sharper, and quicker.

“Its improvement rate is too fast.”

Shi Feng had not imagined that the Abyssal Bind, which could restrain even the High Lord ranked Nebula Tiger, would not affect the Mechanical Slayer. However, the Mechanical Slayer’s improvement was far more frightening.

“It seems that I can only fool around here.”

Shi Feng watched the air blades that filled the hall. There was simply nowhere to take cover. He had also used up all of his lifesaving skills to deal with the eight Mechanical Watchers. However, even if he had his lifesaving skills, he still couldn’t defend against the Mechanical Slayer’s attack. Not delaying any further, Shi Feng switched out the Seven Luminaries Ring’s Aura of Wind to the Aura of Space.

Suddenly, a spatial crack formed in front of Shi Feng. Through this crack, one could see a completely different view from that of the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold. In the blink of an eye, the spatial crack widened large enough to allow a single person to pass through.

Shi Feng jumped through the spatial crack without hesitation.

Soon after, the air blades entered the spatial crack as well, following their target. However, the moment these blades of air entered the spatial crack, they immediately disappeared without a trace like a rock sinking into a bottomless ocean.

This spatial crack was formed by none other than the Aura of Space’s activatable skill, Space Movement. Although the skill was not as convenient as an Elementalist’s Instantaneous Movement, the distance one could cross using Space Movement far surpassed that of Instantaneous Movement.

Mutants were different from other monsters. If a monster or NPC killed a player, they would only suffer the standard system penalty.

However, if a Mutant killed a player...

Not only would the penalty for death double, but players would also need to wait one natural day before they could revive in the game. Healers resurrection skills would also not work on players Mutants had killed. Hence, players were required to wait one natural day before they could resume playing God’s Domain. Moreover, after reviving, players would enter a weakened state, having all their Attributes reduced by 30% and EXP received by 50% for two natural days.

In God’s Domain, time was money. A Guild would suffer tremendous losses if its members became useless for three days. Even first-rate Guilds could not afford to suffer such a loss.

When the Mechanical Slayer saw Shi Feng disappear into the spatial crack, a hint of suspicion appeared on its icy face.

The Mechanical Slayer had only recently gained its own consciousness, and there were simply too many things in this world that it did not know.

Shi Feng was but an ant in its eyes; something that it could easily crush. However, not only had this ant damaged it, freezing it for a long time, but this ant also managed to escape right before its eyes. Moreover, the method this ant used to escape was something it had never encountered before.

“Damned ant, do you think you can escape me?” The Mechanical Slayer laughed coldly, almost human-like. “No matter how far you run, you won’t escape my grasp.”

Following which, the Mechanical Slayer swung its greatsword upwards, piercing a large hole through the ceiling and creating a path out of the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold. Focusing its strength in its legs, the Mechanical Slayer jumped out of the stronghold.

“So, this is how flying works,” the Mechanical Slayer chuckled as it hovered in mid-air.

If Shi Feng could hear the Mechanical Slayer’s words or witness the flying ability it displayed, cold sweat would drench his back. Not only did the intelligence of this Mechanical Slayer undergo a tremendous transformation, but its learning capability also reached frightening levels. The Mechanical Slayer had only seen Shi Feng use Wind Rider once, yet, it actually learned the skill so quickly...

“Hmm. I see that you’ve managed to run quite far away.” Hovering above the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold, the Mechanical Slayer’s lips curled up with a trace of playfulness as it looked towards the northwest. Immediately, it flew in that direction, hunting its prey.

---

At this moment, Aqua Rose, Fire Dance, and everyone else from Zero Wing had just left the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold, confusion still occupying their minds.

Before anyone could react, the roof of the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold suddenly collapsed, creating a hole that led towards the stronghold’s underground space. In the next moment, the Mechanical Slayer appeared from the hole and hovered above the stronghold. Soon after, the Mechanical Slayer transformed into a streak of light and departed from Creek Town.

After a period of silence, Snow Goose rubbed her eyes, asking uncertainly, “Big Sis Aqua, my eyes aren’t playing tricks on me, right? That thing that flew away just now was the Mechanical Slayer, right?”

“Uh...yes.” Aqua Rose nodded her head blankly.

The Mechanical Slayer looked like a flying fortress as it soared through the sky. Not only had it possessed frightening, destructive force, but it also possessed speed that completely surpassed players. Faced with an enemy like this, any player would be left speechless, let alone those who had personally witnessed the power of this creature.

Although the Mechanical Slayer had already departed from Creek Town, fear lingered in everyone’s hearts.

Was it really possible for players to contend with such a monster?

This question echoed in everyone’s minds.

“Crap! Since the Mechanical Slayer has left, doesn’t that mean that Guild Leader died inside the hidden warehouse?!” Fire Dance suddenly realized, her expression undergoing an abrupt change. Filled with worry, Fire Dance immediately activated Wind Steps and rushed back into the stronghold, charging towards the collapsed warehouse.

In God’s Domain, there were only two possibilities for a monster to leave battle. The first was when players had run beyond the monster’s range predetermined by the system. The other scenario was when the monster successfully killed its target. Now that the Mechanical Slayer had departed from Creek Town, it was obvious that the second scenario had occurred.

“I’ll go with you.” Violet Cloud also reacted quickly and chased after Fire Dance.

Following which, everyone finally understood the situation. Shame overcame them as they followed the two girls.

They were the elite members of Zero Wing, yet, they had allowed their Guild Leader to sacrifice himself to protect them. What kind of elite members were they?

However, as everyone arrived before the hidden warehouse, they were all dumbfounded by what they saw.

Unbelievably, the corpses of the eight Mechanical Watchers were embedded into the steel walls of the hidden warehouse. In addition, items littered the floor around the dead Watchers. However, to everyone’s surprise, Shi Feng’s body was nowhere to be found.

Just what was going on here?

They were left with even more questions, now.

Fire Dance immediately checked the team member list, discovering that Shi Feng’s name was still illuminated. The fact that Shi Feng’s name had not turned gray showed that Shi Feng was still alive.

“Just what is happening?” Fire Dance sighed in relief. Though she was visibly more at ease now, the questions plaguing her had only increased.

Just as everyone was at a loss, Shi Feng suddenly spoke through the team chat, asking, “What’s the situation in Creek Town? Is the Mechanical Slayer still there?”

“Guild Leader, where did you run off to? We thought that the Slayer had done away with you!” Snow Goose giggled. She then added, “Big Sis Fire Dance even went into a flurry and wanted to take revenge! We couldn’t stop her, even working together!”

Hearing these words, Fire Dance shot Snow Goose a glare, a faint blush appearing on her delicate white cheeks.

Snow Goose stuck her little tongue out playfully at Fire Dance. She then hid behind Aqua Rose, only revealing her head to glance at Fire Dance with her hands on her hips.

“Snow Goose, stop being naughty. We need to get down to business,” Aqua Rose flicked a finger at Snow Goose’s forehead, pretending to be angry.

“Big Sis Aqua, I was wrong. However, you shouldn’t always flick my forehead! I’ll get brain damage at this rate!” Snow Goose clutched her forehead, her eyes tearing.

Completely ignoring Snow Goose’s spoiled act, Aqua Rose spoke through the team chat, “Guild Leader, the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold has been destroyed. Moreover, the Mechanical Slayer departed from Creek Town and flew towards the northwest.”

“As I expected; it’s still chasing after me.” Shi Feng pondered. He then smiled, saying, “I guess it’s good that it is coming after me. Since the Mechanical Slayer is no longer in Creek Town, I’ll leave collecting the treasures inside the warehouse to you. Do not let others take advantage of us.”

To undo the magic barrier protecting the treasures, they needed to get rid of the eight Mechanical Watchers and the Mechanical Slayer. Now that all eight Mechanical Watchers were dead, only the Mechanical Slayer remained. As long as the Mechanical Slayer died, the magic barrier would vanish. Meanwhile, now that the Blood Hand Association’s stronghold had been destroyed, the treasures had also been revealed. Sooner or later, the Red Names that had just revived or escaped previously would discover the treasure. As long as the magic barrier vanished, those bandits would not sit quietly and watch as their team looted the stronghold. They would take the opportunity to snatch some for themselves.

“Guild Leader, please rest assured. How could anything belonging to our Zero Wing be that easy to steal?” Aqua Rose said, a chilling glow flashing in her eyes.

Following which, Shi Feng began to flee once more.

Space Movement had a maximum range of 300,000 yards, which was only around one or two leveling zones. However, Creek Town was located at the borders of the White River City region. There were no other towns in its vicinity. Even if there were, though, the forces there would not be enough to stop the Mechanical Slayer.

Right now, White River City was the only location that could fend off the Mechanical Slayer.

Thus, Shi Feng used Space Movement to arrive at the closest teleportation point, teleporting to White River City.

After arriving at White River City, before Shi Feng even stepped out of the teleportation magic array, he discovered a commotion going on at the entrance of the Teleportation Hall. At this moment, there were many Guild players surrounding the entrance of the Teleportation Hall, and every one of them acted overbearingly.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
