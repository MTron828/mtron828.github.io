Chapter 2892 – All Sides Shaken

Dark Night Empire, Dark Night City:

Starlink’s Residence had once been brightly lit and crowded with people. However, after Zero Wing’s rise, the number of players visiting Starlink’s Residence had steadily decreased. Now, apart from Guild members, almost nobody visited Starlink’s Residence.

Starlink was now the least prosperous of the Dark Night Empire’s top four Guilds, not even comparable with first-rate Guilds.

However, many people had gathered in the Residence’s top-floor meeting room, including representatives from the various superpowers and executives of many Dark Guilds. These people were here to discuss how to oppose the increasingly powerful Zero Wing in secret and the Outerworld’s invasion.

Only, after everyone present read the report they just received, their complexions turned indescribably ashen.

“Has Cold Shadow lost her mind?! She left Mythology for Zero Wing?! Is she not afraid of Mythology’s retaliation?!”

“Hasn’t Cold Shadow always been at loggerheads with Zero Wing? What’s up with this situation?”

“It seems Mythology is also stunned by this development. According to the reports I received, Cold Shadow seems to have planned this betrayal with her subordinates long ago. Not only did they annex hundreds of Shops simultaneously, but they also exchanged all their GCPs for resources. She took Mythology completely by surprise.”

Although the importance of Cold Shadow’s betrayal was insignificant compared to the Outerworld’s invasion, the various superpowers present were still shocked and confused by this situation.

Mythology was one of the Five Great Super Guilds. Cold Shadow herself also possessed extraordinary strength and status within the Guild. She had a high chance of becoming Mythology’s Guild Leader. With such a bright future ahead of her, there should be no reason for her to leave Mythology.

Moreover, Zero Wing was currently in a terrible situation. The Guild’s ability to facilitate teleportation between the two main continents had made it an eyesore for the native superpowers and also a priority target for the Outerworld forces. Now that the second War of Worlds had begun, everyone was steering clear of Zero Wing.

Despite that, Cold Shadow had taken the initiative to join Zero Wing. The various representatives present simply couldn’t wrap their heads around this situation. Some of them even suspected Cold Shadow of having a secret relationship with Shi Feng. Otherwise, why would Cold Shadow, a woman with a promising future, join Zero Wing, a Guild in a precarious situation?

“All of you, be quiet!” Lu Tiandi shouted as the babel in the room reached unbearable levels. Standing up, he said, “Although Cold Shadow’s betrayal has increased Zero Wing’s strength substantially, our plans remain unchanged. According to the information I obtained, over ten Outerworld superpowers will lead a portion of the NPC conquest army to the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom.

“To ensure the swift destruction of these two kingdoms, we must get the experts there to leave as quickly as possible. We must also get the players of the neighboring kingdoms and empires to distance themselves from these two kingdoms. Without the help of expert players, the two kingdoms will fall with only their NPCs and Zero Wing to defend them!”

The various superpowers’ representatives and the various Dark Guilds’ executives nodded in agreement with Lu Tiandi’s words.

“Guild Leader Lu, rest assured, we will mobilize all available personnel to lure the independent experts of those kingdoms and empires away! We won’t let them assist Zero Wing!”

“That’s right! We can also commission those experts to join the armies of other kingdoms and empires! I believe those independent experts will be more than happy to do so for an appropriate price! The Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom will have nobody to help them!”

In the current era where Zero Wing dominated the eastern continent, the superpowers and Dark Guilds hostile to Zero Wing were having an incredibly bad time. Moreover, with Shi Feng defending Zero Wing, even the Five Great Super Guilds could do nothing against Zero Wing.

Nevertheless, Zero Wing couldn’t stop them from secretly carrying out small schemes. Players played a significant role in the War of Worlds. This remained true even for Tier 3 players because players could resurrect continuously even after falling in battle. While NPCs could also be resurrected, the process was much more complicated. Moreover, the battlefield spanned far and wide. Even if an individual possessed heaven-defying combat power, they could affect the outcome of only a limited area. Winning the war still required the cooperation of a large number of expert players.

In the first War of Worlds, the only reason the eastern continent’s forces managed to stop the Outerworld NPC army’s advance was the large number of expert players who had participated in the war. Otherwise, the eastern continent would’ve long since fallen.

Hence, the various superpowers and Dark Guilds present were confident of destroying the two kingdoms serving as Zero Wing’s backbone in the upcoming war.

While the various superpowers and Dark Guilds were secretly colluding against Zero Wing, a large number of Tier 4 experts had gathered in the distant Orc Empire’s Ancient Rock City. Looking at the pedestrians coming and going on the main street, the female Guardian Knight White Feather exclaimed, “Vice Guild Leader, this city is absurd. Not only does it have stronger defenses than a royal capital, but the number of Tier 4 NPCs here also surpasses even that of certain imperial capitals.”

White Feather had been living and developing in the Fire Dragon Empire all this time, so she was accustomed to the prosperous and powerful Flame Dragon City. Hence, no Guild City had ever managed to catch her eye.

However, after arriving at Ancient Rock City, White Feather had to acknowledge the city’s magnificence.

The number of Tier 4 NPCs visiting Ancient Rock City was especially amazing, practically comparable to Flame Dragon City’s!

Meanwhile, the presence of Tier 4 NPCs would greatly impact a Guild City’s defensive standard and the fortuitous opportunities available within it.

“It is indeed well-developed. Even Mythology’s main headquarters can’t compare,” Cold Shadow said, nodding in agreement.

Originally, she still had some misgivings about her decision to join Zero Wing. However, seeing Ancient Rock City had considerably alleviated her worries.

With Ancient Rock City’s advantages, the city could repulse the various superpowers’ attacks even if Shi Feng were absent. It also wouldn’t have any problems fending off Mythology’s retaliation.

Moreover, given enough time, Ancient Rock City would not only attract a large number of players from the surrounding kingdoms and empires but also acquire increasingly better resources from the Orc Capital City. Afterward, so long as the eastern continent succeeded in fending off the Outerworld’s army, it wouldn’t be difficult for Zero Wing to become God’s Domain’s strongest Guild.

Her only concern was that fending off the Outerworld’s conquest army wouldn’t be an easy task. If the defense were mishandled, Zero Wing might even perish in the upcoming war.

After thinking up to this point, Cold Shadow couldn’t help frowning.

She couldn’t understand why Shi Feng had suddenly called for Tier 4 members like herself to gather in Ancient Rock City. Now that the second War of Worlds was imminent, there was a lot of work to be done. It was especially important for them to recruit expert players from the neighboring kingdoms and empires. If they acted slowly, the other superpowers would definitely interfere with their plans.

When Cold Shadow and her team of nearly ten Tier 4 experts entered the City Lord’s Mansion, they were instantly stunned by the environment inside the building.

“Why are the operating principles of Mana so clear here? The clarity inside Mythology’s special secret land doesn’t even come close,” White Feather exclaimed.

The special secret land Mythology had found and secured after paying a great price had an excellent environment that provided players with greater insight into the operating principles of Mana. However, only a limited number of people could enter the secret land at a time, resulting in fierce competition among the Guild’s many Tier 4 experts and the Tier 3 experts seeking to get promoted to Tier 4.

Moreover, even after one clinched a slot, they still needed to fork out a lot of resources to enter the secret land. One had to pay for these resources out of one’s own pockets, the total cost of which was enough to make even Tier 4 experts wince.

Yet, not only did Ancient Rock City’s City Lord’s Mansion’s environment surpass that of Mythology’s special secret land, but there was hardly an entry limit. With the size of the City Lord’s Mansion, thousands of players could enjoy this wonderful environment simultaneously. If Mythology’s many Tier 4 experts found out about this, they would probably die of envy. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

While Cold Shadow and the others were in a daze, Shi Feng, who had been waiting in the City Lord’s Mansion for some time now, suddenly said, “Alright! Now that everyone’s here, let’s enter the Evil God’s Secret Land!”
