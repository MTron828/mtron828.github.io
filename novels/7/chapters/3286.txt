Chapter 361 – Tier 5

The Tier 5 Sacred Sky Knight’s mockery of Shi Feng caused the silent crowd to laugh.

A Tier 4 player would have to be ignorant of the word “death” to act arrogantly in front of a Tier 5 player. Shi Feng might have a piece of Legendary Equipment, but that would only put him on the same level as ordinary Tier 5 players who didn’t have decent equipment and couldn’t even conquer the World Tower’s fourth floor.

If Shi Feng were to go up against a Tier 5 fourth-floor expert, he’d have an incredibly tough time. This was because players of this standard no longer had any shortcomings. The degree of control they had over their bodies and their surroundings would also be at the Domain Realm standard at the very least, with some having even reached the Beyond Domain Realm. They could even exhibit the power of Silver Combat Techniques with their every action.

Unless Shi Feng was extremely outstanding in one aspect, he’d have no chance of turning the tides against a Tier 5 fourth-floor expert.

!!

For example, if Shi Feng had grasped a Gold Combat Technique, it wouldn’t matter even if he went up against an opponent with superior Basic Attributes and could exhibit the power of Silver Combat Techniques through their every action. The effects of a Gold Combat Technique would give him enough of an advantage that he could have a chance at victory.

But grasping a Gold Combat Technique was easier said than done. Experts who had successfully grasped a Gold Combat Technique were exceedingly rare, even in the Greater God’s Domain. For this reason, once an expert reached the fourth-floor standard, it was nigh impossible for them to lose to players of a lower tier.

Not to mention, Shi Feng’s current opponent wasn’t just a fourth-floor expert but a paragon.

“Don’t get ahead of yourself, Croc,” the female Brilliant Cleric Saint standing nearby said, chuckling. “The young master has already said to capture him alive. If you kill him now, we’ll have to go through the trouble of finding him again to capture him.”

The Sky Knight named Iron Crocodile briefly looked at the Cleric Saint when he heard the other party’s words. Then, he returned his focus to Shi Feng while nonchalantly saying, “Don’t worry. I know what I’m supposed to do. You two, on the other hand, should make sure you don’t let him get away.”

Before Iron Crocodile even finished speaking, he brandished the longsword he wielded, executing a Holy Cross at Shi Feng. Not only did the attack have a large AOE, but its power also far exceeded the attack Platinum Behemoth had previously used against Shi Feng.

“Guild Leader, be careful!” Wu Xiaoxiao subconsciously shouted, shocked by Iron Crocodile’s attack.

Iron Crocodile’s attack was incredibly fast and sudden. He had abruptly attacked Shi Feng while talking to the Cleric Saint nearby, and he had completed his attack by the time he finished speaking. He did not reveal any killing intent throughout the entire process. He also didn’t show any indications that he was going to attack. He had completed his entire attack against Shi Feng as naturally as if he were breathing.

However, unlike Wu Xiaoxiao, Shi Feng was ready for Iron Crocodile’s sudden attack. Or, more specifically, any expert who had reached the Domain Realm’s third step could have adequately utilized their sixth sense to predict Iron Crocodile’s sneak attack and taken preemptive defensive measures. Of course, that was under the precondition that they could keep up with Iron Crocodile’s Tier 5 reaction speed. Otherwise, even if they managed to predict Iron Crocodile’s actions through their sixth sense, it wouldn’t matter if their bodies couldn’t keep up.

Without hesitation, Shi Feng raised the Winter of Eternal Night horizontally before him to defend himself.

Boom!

Following a loud explosion, Shi Feng stumbled two steps backward, the Winter of Eternal Night in his hand humming as it violently vibrated. Shi Feng’s HP had also fallen by roughly 3%.

“Your Strength Attribute really is something. No wonder you managed to kill our leader in one hit,” Iron Crocodile said, feeling a little surprised to see that Shi Feng had only stumbled two steps backward after blocking his attack. However, despite his surprise, Iron Crocodile did not stop moving. “But how will you fare against this next move?”

Immediately, Iron Crocodile split into nine copies of himself. Then, the nine doppelgangers began flashing in and out of existence around Shi Feng, the speed and dexterity they displayed stunning the Tier 4 experts present.

“Is this Nine Absolute Shadows, one of the rumored 99 Absolute Techniques?” When Trecht looked at the nine untraceable doppelgangers, a flame of passion burning in his eyes.

As for Thousand Scars, she hurriedly started making a recording of Iron Crocodile’s Nine Absolute Shadows, afraid the fight would end too quickly.

There were 99 Absolute Techniques in the Greater God’s Domain.

These 99 Absolute Techniques were Advanced Silver Combat Techniques recorded and ranked by the Seven Luminaries Alliance. Meanwhile, it was publicly recognized that any player who grasped one of these Absolute Techniques could achieve absolute strength.

Among the 99 Absolute Techniques, Nine Absolute Shadows was sought after by all Assassins in God’s Domain. Yet, it was now being used by Iron Crocodile, a Guardian Knight.

Although Nine Absolute Shadows ranked 55 out of the 99 Absolute Techniques, it ranked third out of all the footwork-type Absolute Techniques. It was also the highest-ranked footwork-type Absolute Technique accessible to the public. As for the first- and second-ranked techniques, they were monopolized by two apex powers, and only the executives of these apex powers could qualify to learn the techniques.

However, even though the Seven Luminaries Alliance offered all players a chance to learn Nine Absolute Shadows, the cost of doing so wasn’t something ordinary experts could afford. Or, more specifically, only Tier 6 titled experts could afford to learn it.

Meanwhile, in response to Iron Crocodile’s Nine Absolute Shadows, Shi Feng used World of Frost and executed Sword’s Orbit without hesitation. Immediately, within the domain of his World Creation, the nine frost swords he summoned transformed into countless stars that orbited around him.

Ninefold Sword’s Orbit!

Boom… Boom… Boom…

The sound of metal colliding reverberated continuously in the spacious dining hall. In only a few seconds, nearly a hundred exchanges had taken place already. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Meanwhile, every collision would not only see several frost swords get sent flying, but a visible chunk of Shi Feng’s HP bar would also disappear. In no time, Shi Feng’s HP had already fallen to just one-third of its maximum.

This sight caused Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao to panic. Yet, even though they wished to help Shi Feng, they couldn’t. This was because neither of them could keep up with Shi Feng’s and Iron Crocodile’s speed.

When Shi Feng’s HP was about to drop below 10%, Shi Feng finally found an opportunity to take out a Grandmaster Regeneration Potion and consume it, instantly recovering all of the HP he lost.

As expected of the Nine Absolute Shadows. Even Tier 5 Assassins will have trouble keeping up with this speed, Shi Feng thought. He had a headache going up against Iron Crocodile. He had only been on the defensive throughout the entire exchange. If it weren’t for the frost swords giving him a numerical advantage and letting him pinpoint Iron Crocodile’s position, he could have never defended against the Sacred Sky Night’s offensive.

“You are merely prolonging your suffering by drinking a potion!”

Immediately, Iron Crocodile accelerated once again. He did not plan to give Shi Feng more chances to recover. Although Regeneration Potions in God’s Domain typically had a Cooldown of two minutes or more, he couldn’t help but feel a little upset when he saw Shi Feng’s HP recovering to full.

When Shi Feng saw Iron Crocodile’s speed increasing even further, he stopped staying on the defensive. Immediately, he raised the Winter of Eternal Night and swung it down hard.

Third Sword, Holy Annihilation!
