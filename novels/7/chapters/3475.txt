Chapter 550 – Unsealing the Shadow Incinerator

Thank you readers!

What astonishing rewards!

Shi Feng’s fatigue instantly disappeared when he saw the reward options.

Anything capable of being regarded as an Abyssal Treasure in God’s Domain would be a treasure once used by the Primordial Abyssal God. In other words, it would be a Primordial God Treasure, and it would be at the Fragmented Divine Artifact rank at the very least. It was an item that could tempt even the various apex powers.

The Abyssal Guidance was likewise extraordinarily valuable.

!!

In God’s Domain, countless Tier 6 players would do anything to get a Tier 6 God’s guidance to further improve themselves. While a Tier 6 God’s guidance wasn’t as detailed as a God’s Legacy, the guidance would be specifically targeted toward improving one aspect of the player receiving it. Hence, players would benefit much more from a God’s guidance than a God’s Legacy.

On the open market, one opportunity to receive a God’s guidance was worth as much as five Legendary Weapons and Equipment.

As for a Primordial God’s guidance, that was something akin to a legend in the Greater God’s Domain. Nobody would be willing to trade it away, even for a Fragmented Divine Artifact. After all, while Fragmented Divine Artifacts were exceedingly rare, quite a few could still be found throughout the Greater God’s Domain. In contrast, even information on Primordial Gods was nigh-impossible to find in the Greater God’s Domain, let alone a Primordial God’s guidance.

After recovering from his surprise, Shi Feng chose the Abyssal Guidance as his reward without hesitation.

An Abyssal Treasure might be precious, but there were all sorts of Abyssal Treasures in existence. If he happened to obtain an Abyssal Treasure that he couldn’t use, it would be a massive loss to him.

The Abyssal Guidance, on the other hand, would give him a guaranteed opportunity to improve one aspect of himself.

Shi Feng experienced an unimaginably massive Concentration expenditure when using the Sword of Space. The expenditure was so great that he nearly lost consciousness as soon as he finished using the Mana Technique.

But this also allowed Shi Feng to understand the might of the Goddess of Space’s Dark Moon Mana Technique.

Even if he had used only one part of the Mana Technique, it still allowed him to exhibit power rivaling Tier 6 Gods as a Tier 5 player.

If he could reduce the Sword of Space’s Concentration expenditure, making it more practical to use at Tier 5, he would have a fighting chance even if he came across the various pseudo-apex powers’ Tier 6 experts in the future.

Currently, the average level of the Eternal Realm’s frontline experts was 158, with a few having already reached Level 159. At this point, it wouldn’t be long before the various pseudo-apex powers and upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ experts completed the final sprint and reached Level 160. By then, these powers would quickly gain a batch of Tier 6 players to command in the Eternal Realm.

Meanwhile, although Shi Feng had also reached Level 159 due to the Golden Spire’s reward, he couldn’t advance to Tier 6 as soon as he reached Level 160. This was because he needed to construct a Legendary Divine Body before he could get promoted to Tier 6, which was by no means an easy task to accomplish. At that time, he would have to face a bunch of Tier 6 players while being stuck at Tier 5.

If he could receive the Primordial Abyssal God’s guidance and improve his mastery over Dark Moon, it would greatly help in the development of his personal strength and the construction of his future Divine Body. This, in turn, would increase his survivability and reduce the time he needed to construct a Legendary Divine Body.

“You have made a wise decision, young heaven-blessed.”

As soon as Shi Feng decided, an illusory figure several hundred meters tall appeared on the staircase before him and spoke in a voice of commendation. At the same time, Shi Feng could feel a terrifying Divine Might descending upon him, instantly rendering him immobile.

“Well? Which aspect do you wish to receive my guidance on? You have used the last strand of power I have left in this spire, so this will be the last time I will appear here.” Looking at Shi Feng with a hint of surprise in his eyes, the illusory figure pointed at one of the swords hanging by Shi Feng’s waist and asked, “Do you want to receive my guidance on that Goddess’s Legacy? Or do you want help with that sword that shouldn’t exist?”

Sword that shouldn’t exist? Shi Feng couldn’t help but turn to look at the Shadow Incinerator. Then, pointing at the Shadow Incinerator, he asked, “Almighty Being, do you mean you can help me unseal this sword?”

Generally, guidance involved the “guide” providing pointers to players in technical aspects. Meanwhile, the Shadow Incinerator was a weapon, so guidance shouldn’t have anything to do with it normally.

But if the Primordial Abyssal God could indeed help him unseal the Shadow Incinerator, he would naturally be more than happy to go with that option.

It should be known that Ife, the Crimson Wing, had slain eight Ancient Gods with the Shadow Incinerator in his previous life. After that accomplishment, the Shadow Incinerator was even ranked fifth on the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Divine Weapon List. Not to mention, the Shadow Incinerator currently in his possession wasn’t just a Divine Artifact but a Godly Relic instead.

“Unseal it for you?” The Primordial Abyssal God shook his head and laughed. “You have a wonderful imagination. Unfortunately, only you, the wielder, can undo the seals on this sword. Nobody else can do it for you. I can only teach you the way to unseal it. As for what extent you can unseal it to, it all depends on your abilities.”

Teach me how to unseal it? Shi Feng couldn’t help but feel a bit of disdain toward the Primordial Abyssal God.

He already knew how to unseal the Shadow Incinerator. Why would he need anybody to guide him in doing so?

“Your current Concentration has reached the Tier 6 Intermediate standard, so you are already qualified to undo the first seal.” Failing to notice the disdain in Shi Feng’s heart, the Primordial Abyssal God continued speaking, “Of course, if you wish to rely only on yourself, you will most likely have to wait until your Concentration reaches the Tier 6 Advanced standard or possibly even the Tier 6 Peak standard.”

I can undo the first seal right away? Shi Feng was shocked.

It was as the Primordial Abyssal God had said. According to his estimates, he would have to develop his Concentration to the Tier 6 Advanced standard before he could break the mental nodes in the Shadow Incinerator. Before then, he could do nothing about them.

However, developing his Concentration any further than he already had would be difficult to accomplish. After all, a strong body was required to nurture a strong mind. Achieving a Tier 6 Advanced Concentration simply wasn’t feasible with a Tier 5 body.

“Alright, make your choice. That Goddess’s Legacy, or this sword,” the Primordial Abyssal God said, not giving Shi Feng any further answers.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng fell into contemplation for a moment as he looked at the Shadow Incinerator.

Whether it was improving his mastery over Dark Moon or unsealing the Shadow Incinerator, both could significantly improve his strength. It was especially so for the Mana Technique developed by the Goddess of Space. After all, mastering Dark Moon meant mastering a Goddess Law. Such mastery would undoubtedly be of great help to him in creating his Legendary Divine Body. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Eventually, Shi Feng gritted his teeth and said, “I choose the unsealing method of the Shadow Incinerator!”

As a Swordsman, the temptation of having a good sword was simply irresistible to him.

“Good! As you wish!” The Primordial Abyssal God nodded and gently placed a finger on Shi Feng’s head.

Immediately, Shi Feng felt streams of information flooding his brain. These pieces of information were not very complicated. They simply described a special way of utilizing his mind. The technique was named Mental Condensation, and it allowed the user to increase their mind’s tenacity.

What an incredible mental application method! After Shi Feng was done analyzing the Mental Condensation technique, he had completely forgotten about the Goddess of Space’s Legacy.

In God’s Domain, players could only raise their minds’ tenacity by elevating their Life Rating or relying on incredibly rare tools. Before today, Shi Feng had never even heard of a mental application method that could increase the tenacity of a player’s mind.

However, the Primordial Abyssal God’s mental application method had accomplished it. Moreover, this method was very easy to learn, easier than even a Silver Combat Technique. So long as he mastered it, he could even pass it on to others. Its value was easily comparable to that of Dark Moon.

“That’s it for the guidance. How far you can progress in the future is up to you now.” When the Primordial Abyssal God saw the dazed look on Shi Feng, he left behind a few words before vanishing completely.

Meanwhile, after sitting silently for a while, Shi Feng quickly learned Mental Condensation and took out the Shadow Incinerator. Then, he began destroying the mental nodes inside.

One node… Three nodes… Nine nodes…

After breaking 26 mental nodes, Shi Feng successfully undid the first seal on the Shadow Incinerator. Immediately, an invisible pressure rivaling the Divine Might of Tier 6 Gods spread across a radius of several thousand yards. The pressure was so overwhelming that even Shi Feng, the Shadow Incinerator’s wielder, felt a little oppressed mentally.
