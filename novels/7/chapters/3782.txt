Chapter 3783 - 857 - New Twelve Wings of Heaven

“He wasn’t even at Level 200?” Heiser was stunned. “What do you mean? Are you saying he really is only Level 200 right now?”

Had Shi Feng been hiding his level, Heiser would have found the situation more believable. In fact, she would rather believe Shi Feng was at the same level as Great Commander South Lake than accept that he had killed Abyss Water as a Level 200 player.

Although it was mind-boggling for someone from the Eternal Realm to be at such a level, it wasn’t completely out of the question. After all, Shi Feng’s presence in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary proved he possessed the means to travel freely in and out of the Eternal Realm. He could have simply been leveling outside the Eternal Realm in that case.

Many conglomerates and pseudo-apex powers owned Level 200-plus secret lands in the Greater God’s Domain. It wouldn’t even be surprising if these powers secretly owned Level 230-plus secret lands as well. If these powers mobilized a bunch of experts to help Shi Feng grind, so long as he secured the last hits, he could gain significant EXP.

Of course, another possibility was that Shi Feng was already at a very high level and that he had simply kept it hidden. However, this was an unlikely scenario. The Seven Luminaries Alliance shouldn’t be underestimated. If Shi Feng had truly been at Level 230 or above, he wouldn’t have ended up on the Luminous Glory List or the Sacred Glory List. He would’ve landed straight on the Divine Glory List from the start.

Yet, Twilight Leaf was now saying that Shi Feng was indeed only Level 200…

No matter how Heiser wrestled with the idea, she couldn’t fathom it. After all, how could a mere Level 200, Tier 6 player, devoid of any Divine Artifacts, overwhelm her senses?

“I’m certain. Guild Leader Black Flame was only Level 190 when he fought Uncle Xiao in a simulation battle three days ago. Uncle Xiao even complained afterward about not being able to fight at full strength,” Twilight Leaf stated firmly. “As for whether Guild Leader Black Flame is Level 200 now…that I can’t say for sure.”

“Is that so…” Heiser fell into thought for a moment. Then, the corners of her mouth raised into a playful smile as she said, “I guess my teacher wasn’t joking when she described Guild Leader Black Flame as mysterious. Now, I have another expert I can challenge besides Big Sis Frost!”

Subsequently, Heiser and Twilight Leaf advanced deeper into the Shadow Mountains to regroup with the other members of Holy Dragon Spear. Meanwhile, a commotion broke out in the Shadow Mountains’ outer area as news of the Divine Wing Dynasty’s number one chosen one getting killed got around. Simultaneously, the legend of a Swordsman named Black Flame spread like wildfire.

This was the first time in centuries that a Level 200 player had managed to kill a pseudo-apex power’s Level 226 chosen one in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Moreover, this Level 200 player wasn’t even among the Divine Glory List’s top 30. Instead, he was only ranked 281st.

When the Divine Wing Dynasty’s executives learned of this matter, they immediately issued a kill order for Black Flame, adamant in recovering their reputation.

Flame Dragon God’s Nest, Forest of the Dead:

This should be a good spot to level up. Shi Feng sighed in relief after checking his map.

After running for over four hours, he finally crossed the Shadow Mountains and arrived at the Forest of the Dead, a map with higher-level monsters.

The lowest-level monsters in the Forest of the Dead were Level 235. As every five levels was a small turning point for monsters, the Forest of the Dead’s lowest-level monsters were much stronger than the Shadow Mountains’ lowest-level monsters. A Level 235 Legendary monster would be as strong as a Level 220 Divine monster.

Not to mention, many Level 235-plus Divine monsters roamed the Forest of the Dead. If a group of Level 235 Legendary monsters showed up with a Level 235-plus Divine monster in the lead, no Tier 6 party under Level 230 could survive.

Thus, it was unlikely any other teams or parties would venture into the Forest of the Dead right away. They would likely spend a day or two grinding in the Shadow Mountains before considering coming here. This presented Shi Feng with a golden opportunity to grind here undisturbed.

Immediately, Shi Feng retrieved the Feather of Oath and the three World Sources from his bag. Then, he had the Feather of Oath absorb the three World Sources.

My success rides on you now. Shi Feng’s heart clenched with anxiety as he watched the Feather of Oath absorb the World Sources.

Shi Feng never got around to repairing the Feather of Oath since he had to start his journey to the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary shortly after obtaining the World Sources from Enos. Now that he was stuck in the Flame Dragon God’s Nest, unless he could find a party or a team willing to accept a Level 200 player, the Feather of Oath was his only hope for getting out of the secret land alive.

So long as he could summon Level 220, Tier 6 War Goddesses, a party of six War Goddesses should help him get through the Flame Dragon God’s Nest. Otherwise, he would have to lose a portion of his Immortal Soul to leave.

After absorbing the three World Sources, the Feather of Oath released a colorful radiance. Countless divine runes filled the area 100 yards around the Feather of Oath. At a glance, it looked like a primordial being was about to manifest, and many nearby monsters fled in fear.

A minute later, the divine runes merged with the Feather of Oath, leaving it with its original appearance. But upon closer inspection, several golden streaks could be seen adorning it.

As expected of one of the Goddess’s most prized possessions. Even though it is only partially repaired, it already has such a powerful Divine Might and feels nearly as strong as a Divine Artifact. Shi Feng was amazed by the Divine Might emanating from the white feather in his hand. He promptly inspected the Feather of Oath’s stats.

[Feather of Oath] (Divine Artifact)

An item worn by the Goddess of Space. It is a treasure created using the souls of twelve heroes from before the Great Destruction. However, the Feather of Oath suffered serious damage during a fight against three Holy Ancestors, and repairing it will require six World Sources.
