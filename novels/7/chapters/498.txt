Chapter 499 - Rising of Candlelight

In the lounge, both Liang Jing and Xiao Yu approached Shi Feng with far more caution and respect than in the previous meetings.

Only Zhao Ruoxi behaved as usual, smiling and laughing as she conversed with Shi Feng. There did not seem to be any signs of a barrier between them.

“Master Shi Feng, based on our previous arrangements, from today onwards, you will be Big Dipper’s Head Instructor. At the same time, you will also become one of Big Dipper’s Directors, and as you requested, Big Dipper will also come up with an area that will be under your sole management.” Saying so, Xiao Yu took out a half-transparent card from his suit’s pocket, handing it to Shi Feng, “This is Big Dipper’s Diamond Member Card. The card’s information has already been updated. In the future, all of your expenses at Big Dipper will be free of charge. Moreover, Big Dipper will also specially reserve a Special Training Room for your use at any given time.”

When Zhao Ruoxi heard Xiao Yu’s words, even she could not help her shock.

The usual training rooms only contained some fitness and testing equipment.

However, Big Dipper’s Special Training Rooms were different. Big Dipper spared no expense when they had constructed these training rooms. Every item inside was state of the art. The entire room was also controlled by a quantum computer. These rooms were usually only provided to professional fighters.

Normally, these rooms contained a dedicated combat robot. Special Training Rooms also came with full virtual combat videos and combat systems that stored beneficial data, which users could reference and learn from. There was even a gravity control device that allowed one to adjust the gravity in the room in order to produce better results. Furthermore, each room had a Health Cabin that could help its users alleviate physical fatigue, accelerate physical recovery, and maintain the best quality of sleep each day. Hence, many of Jin Hai City’s professional fighters loved come to Big Dipper.

The training rooms in Big Dipper were categorized into four different ranks: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Special. While the cost of each room increased with rank, the benefits also increased. It was especially true for the gravity settings.

In the Basic Training Room, one could adjust the room’s gravity by 2g.

The Intermediate Training Rooms’ gravity could be adjusted by 3g.

In Advanced Training Rooms, one could change the gravity by 4g.

In Special Training Rooms, one could increase or decrease the gravity by 6g. It was impossible for ordinary people to train in such an environment. Even moving one’s fingers would be difficult.

As for the rental fees, ordinary people could not even afford a Basic Training Room.

It cost 3,000 Credits to rent a Basic Training Room for a day; that was almost a typical person’s monthly salary; of course, your average citizen didn’t even qualify to become a member of Big Dipper, to begin with. To professional fighters, however, this was easily affordable.

The Intermediate Training Rooms cost 5,000 Credits per day. A majority of the city’s professional fighters usually preferred to rent Intermediate Training Rooms. Unfortunately, there was not many available.

Big Dipper only had 20 Advanced Training Rooms, and they cost 10,000 Credits to rent per day. This was practically the average price of renting a room at a 7-star hotel.

As for Special Training Rooms, there were only five in the Big Dipper Training Center, or better yet, in all of Jin Hai City. The rental for these rooms was 30,000 Credits per day. However, one would be lucky if they even had the chance to rent one of these rooms.

Yet, now, Big Dipper had specifically reserved one of these rooms for Shi Feng. Countless people would definitely turn green with envy if they found out.

“I’ll have to trouble Chairman Xiao, then.” Shi Feng did not hold back as he accepted the Diamond Member Card.

With the Special Training Room’s gravity enhancement, his future training would yield far better results.

“Master Shi Feng, there is also the matter of the fifteen bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids and five virtual gaming cabins that we previously agreed to. Our Board of Directors has unanimously agreed to increase the count to thirty bottles and ten virtual gaming cabins. We will have the items delivered to you in a few days,” Xiao Yu said with a smile. “Also, I will have my Head Assistant, Liang Jing, follow you. She is always very efficient. If you have any matters in Big Dipper you need to deal with, please let her take care of them for you.”

“Alright.” Shi Feng did not refuse Xiao Yu’s offer. He had no reason to refuse to begin with.

Aside from how important S-rank Nutrient Fluids were to him, just the ten virtual gaming cabins could raise Zero Wing’s Workshop to a whole new level. It would no longer be just your average Workshop.

As for the assistant named Liang Jing, Shi Feng did not know much about Big Dipper. If he wanted Big Dipper to take care of some matters for him, such as training the members of his Workshop, an assistant like Liang Jing would definitely come in handy; she could save him a lot of trouble.

Regardless of the others’ optimistic view of his development in the fighting world, Shi Feng had no intention of changing career paths. He only had one goal in his heart—God’s Domain.

After all, God’s Domain held the world’s future.

After Shi Feng chatted with Xiao Yu and the others for a while, he returned to his apartment.

Before he left, Xiao Yu had Liang Jing prepare five bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids for him, which would help him quickly recover from the injuries he had suffered during the match with Lei Bao.

After returning home, Shi Feng immediately drank a bottle before resting in the virtual gaming cabin and logging into God’s Domain.

A virtual gaming cabin also functioned as a Health Cabin. Only, it had an additional function of allowing its user to log into God’s Domain. Hence, when recovering from an injury, it would be best to lie inside a virtual gaming cabin.

The time was currently 7 pm. Although it was still dark in God’s Domain, the sound of three system notifications rang in Shi Feng’s ears the moment he logged in.

These three notifications informed him of the two Candlelight Trading Firms’ completion in White River City and one in Star-Moon City.

The construction of all three Firms had finished during the day outside of God’s Domain. Moreover, all three Shops had attracted quite a bit of attention, the two Candlelight Trading Firms in White River City in particular.

Both Shops were exquisite three-story-tall buildings. Moreover, as both buildings had suddenly appeared beside White River City’s Auction House and Bank, they had no difficulty attracting notice.

In the end, many players had entered the buildings out of curiosity.

Before they had investigated these new buildings, they had been ignorant. The moment they did, however, they were immediately startled.

Not only were the Shops equipped with a full range of items that players required, but the furnishing inside was also luxurious and magnificent. Both Candlelight Trading Firms were far more glamorous than the Starstreak Trading Firm. There were even lounges available in the two Shops that allowed visiting players to enjoy beverages while they shopped.

Most importantly was the appearance of an item that everyone in White River City thirsted for.

That item was the Basic Strengthened Armor Kit.

Although the Basic Strengthened Armor Kits were inferior to the Basic Mana Armor Kits, the latter was simply too scarce. Despite many people having heard of the item before, they had never personally seen it. Now that the Basic Strengthened Armor Kits had appeared in the two Candlelight Trading Firms, the first batch of players to enter the Shops fought desperately to purchase them, afraid that the Armor Kits would sell out in a heartbeat.

Shi Feng had given Melancholic Smile the authority to determine the goods’ prices in the Shops, so it was up to her to decide at what price she wanted to sell the Basic Strengthened Armor Kits for. Yet, despite having set the initial price of the Armor Kits at 11 Silver Coins, it had taken only an instant for more than a hundred to sell. As a result, Melancholic Smile had no choice but to raise the price once more.

In the end, the price of the Basic Strengthened Armor Kit rose gradually from the initial 11 Silver to its current price of 16 Silver per kit. This price had far surpassed Shi Feng’s initial expectation. Even so, in a short dozen or so hours, the three Shops in White River City and Star-Moon City sold more than 6,000 kits.

Moreover, due to the Basic Strengthened Armor Kits, every player in White River City now knew about the newly established Candlelight Trading Firms. As a result, more players began to visit the Trading Firms, allowing business at the two Shops to flourish.

By the time Shi Feng logged into the game, the two Candlelight Trading Firms in White River City were already packed full of people. Everyone rushed to purchase the Basic Strengthened Armor Kits. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In addition to the several dozen sets of Dragonscale Set Equipment that had sold at the Blackwing Auction House, Shi Feng had suddenly become a wealthy man again, with more than 10,000 Gold in his pockets.
