Chapter 2775 – Astronomical Transaction

Those two? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yu Luo was confused when she followed Shi Feng’s gaze. After all, there was nobody there. Even when she pushed her perception as a Void Realm expert to the limit, she still couldn’t sense any aura or presence of a living being. She didn’t notice any unusual fluctuations in space, either.

Experts at the Void Realm would be aware of even the slightest disturbances around them. At the end of the day, an Assassin’s Stealth only turned them invisible to the naked eye; they remained physically present in the world. So long as they moved, no matter how slow, they would cause some air turbulence. Such unnatural changes wouldn’t escape the perception of a Void Realm expert.

Hence, even a Void Realm Assassin generally couldn’t get within 30 yards of other Void Realm experts undetected. Normally, they could operate only outside the 30-yard radius. As for Assassins at the Domain Realm, while they could perform better, they still wouldn’t be able to get within 20 yards of Void Realm experts undetected. And even if they did manage this feat, they would be able to maintain it for only a matter of seconds.

However, the spot Shi Feng was currently looking at was within 20 yards of himself. Moreover, the conversation between Shi Feng and Lionheart had lasted more than a few seconds already. Even a Domain Realm expert wouldn’t be able to stay hidden for so long. Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Lionheart was slightly surprised. Simultaneously, a hint of alertness and admiration appeared in his eyes.

“Amazing! As expected of a Tier 4 expert capable of moving between Main Cities!”

Part of the reason Lionheart had brought Wind Chaser and Crimson Billow with him this time was to test Shi Feng’s strength.

Crimson Billow was ranked second in Skyflare in terms of stealth. Utilizing her advantages as a Domain Realm expert, she had created a unique concealment technique that allowed her to maintain a high degree of stealth despite being in motion. Meanwhile, after combining this technique with a potion that hid one’s life aura, let alone Tier 3 Domain Realm experts, even Tier 4 Domain Realm experts wouldn’t detect her even when she was within 20 yards of them.

Of course, Tier 4 Domain Realm experts would definitely detect her once she got within 16 yards of them. Even so, being able to conceal herself to such an extent was already more than enough for her to rank at the top of Meteorite City and instill fear into Tier 4 experts. Wind Chaser was even more powerful. After reaching Tier 4, his Stealth Skill was no longer limited to just turning his physical body invisible and concealing his life aura. Instead, the Skill would place his body in a shadow space. No matter what he did inside this space, it wouldn’t affect the outside world. Naturally, others wouldn’t be able to detect his movements while he was inside this shadow space.

In fact, despite knowing about Wind Chaser’s ability, Lionheart hadn’t realized that Wind Chaser was already standing within 20 yards of him.

Nevertheless, Shi Feng had stated that there were two people behind Lionheart. This meant that he had detected both Crimson Billow and Wind Chaser.

“Chaser, Billow, you two can show yourselves now,” Lionheart said, smiling as he looked at the empty space Shi Feng indicated. “No need to hide anymore.”

As soon as Lionheart finished speaking, two figures gradually appeared in that empty space. They were none other than Wind Chaser and Crimson Billow. The two Assassins were looking at Shi Feng with eyes brimming with surprise and confusion. “Commander, did I show some irregularities just now?” Crimson Billow quietly asked Lionheart through the team chat.

Afraid that she would get detected, she had deliberately maintained a 21-yard distance between herself and Shi Feng. After all, she hardly knew anything about Shi Feng, apart from the fact that he was a Tier 4 expert, and she didn’t wish to ruin Lionheart’s attempt at probing Shi Feng’s strength.

Yet, despite the 21-yard distance, he still detected her. Excluding Lionheart, this was the first time a Tier 4 individual perceived her from beyond 20 yards.

“You didn’t. It’s just that this person is much stronger than we thought,” Lionheart responded, shaking his head. “Don’t act rashly against him afterward.”

Shi Feng had discovered not only Crimson Billow but also Wind Chaser. While defeating a Tier 4 expert like Shi Feng would be simple for the current Skyflare, killing him would be incredibly difficult. Unless absolutely necessary, they had best not offend this Sword Emperor.

In response, both Crimson Billow and Wind Chaser nodded silently.

The trio had conversed for only two or three seconds, so outsiders did not find anything wrong with the situation. They merely saw Wind Chaser and Crimson Billow approaching Lionheart slowly after making their appearance.

When Yu Luo, who stood beside Shi Feng, saw the two Assassins walking over, her eyes widened in shock.

There really are two people!

Despite the two Assassins being so close to her, she actually failed to notice either of them. This overturned her understanding of the Assassin class.

Meanwhile, when Shi Feng saw the two Assassins, a hint of wariness also appeared in his eyes.

The two Assassins were astonishingly strong. This was especially true for Wind Chaser.

If not for the recent breakthrough Shi Feng achieved with his Mana Body, which granted him a physique and perception far superior to ordinary Tier 4 individuals’, he would’ve most likely failed to notice Wind Chaser’s presence.

If Wind Chaser really were intent on targeting a specific player, it would be a nightmare for the said player. After all, the Tier 4 Assassin was capable of suddenly appearing within 20 yards of his target without giving off any indications-a distance that any Tier 4 combatant could cross in the blink of an eye.

If Shi Feng was not careful, even he might end up falling prey to Wind Chaser’s ambush. “Let’s head to a reception room to continue our conversation,” Lionheart suggested to Shi Feng

“Sure.” Shi Feng did not object to the proposal.

His original goal in coming to the ancient God’s Domain was to acquire a large amount of resources. Meanwhile, the best way to do so was by partnering with a local tyrant. He could gather resources much faster this way than if he did it by himself. In fact, he could even gain access to items that normally wouldn’t appear on the market.

Lionheart’s taking the initiative to seek him out was naturally good news for Shi Feng.

Lionheart led Shi Feng and Yu Luo to the top-floor reception room he had reserved beforehand.

“Commander Lionheart.” After taking his seat, Shi Feng went straight to the point, saying, “Please just say what you have to say. There is no need for us to waste both our time by playing around with words.”

“You really are a straightforward person, Brother Black Flame.” Lionheart smiled at Shi Feng’s words. “I was thinking the same thing. In that case, I’ll be blunt with you. Skyflare wishes to purchase all of the Crystals of Souls and Soul Water you are selling.”

“It seems you are very ambitious, Commander Lionheart. You actually plan to monopolize Meteorite City?” Shi Feng didn’t feel particularly surprised at Lionheart’s declaration. Calmly, he said, “Of course, we can go with such an arrangement as well. Only, I have quite a number of these items, and I’m afraid your adventurer team can’t swallow them all.”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, Wind Chaser, who stood behind Lionheart, laughed.

“What a joke! There is nothing in Meteorite City that our adventurer team cannot swallow!” Looking at Shi Feng, Wind Chaser sneered, “Of course, that is under the premise that your price is fair.”

At Wind Chaser’s provocation, Shi Feng simply shook his head and smiled. “Truthfully, even at 150,000 Magic Crystals per Crystal of Souls, you won’t be able to afford everything. Not to mention, there is still the Soul Water.”

He had a total of 43 Crystals of Souls. If he sold each for 150,000 Magic Crystals, that would equate to 6.45 million Magic Crystals. Even though the ancient God’s Domain was rich in resources, a player force with a sphere of activity limited to just one city couldn’t take out such an amount.

At Shi Feng’s words, Wind Chaser, who initially planned to probe Shi Feng further, fell silent. There was no way a Tier 4 expert like Shi Feng wouldn’t know about the Skyflare adventurer team’s status and general wealth in Meteorite City. For Shi Feng to say such words meant he had absolute confidence backing him.

Meanwhile, after hearing Shi Feng’s response, both Yu Luo and Crimson Billow couldn’t help gasping. They never thought that Shi Feng would actually be so wealthy.

They had already investigated the Crystal of Souls, so they knew it was a precious treasure that wasn’t obtained easily. Yet, Shi Feng had just declared that Skyflare couldn’t afford to purchase all his stock. This proved that Shi Feng had a lot of Crystals of Souls on hand.

Who knew how many Tier 4 experts one could create with so many Crystals of Souls?

“You truly are extraordinary, Brother Black Flame.” Lionheart immediately broke into a smile. Moreover, this was a very sincere smile. “I apologize to you on behalf of my brother. At the same time, I also hope that the Skyflare adventurer team can form a long-term partnership with you. What do you think?

“I admit that Skyflare cannot take out the necessary Magic Crystals to purchase all your Crystals of Souls. However, our adventurer team still ranks within the top three of Meteorite City’s player forces in daily income. We might not be able to swallow everything in one bite, but I’m sure we can do so after several or a dozen bites.

“Furthermore, I can assure you that not only will we purchase each Crystal of Souls for 200,000 Magic Crystals, but we will also ensure a weekly transaction of three million Magic Crystals at a minimum. May I know what you think of this, Brother Black Flame?”

Yu Luo gaped in shock at Lionheart’s words despite herself. She never imagined that the Skyflare adventurer team had such astonishing wealth. Even the superpowers in the modern God’s Domain were far from comparable to Skyflare in Magic Crystal acquisition.

Moreover, Lionheart even raised the price of the Crystal of Souls to 200,000 Magic Crystals. Skyflare was probably the only power in Meteorite City capable of offering such a price.

After all, a piece of Fragmented Legendary Equipment cost only around 500,000 Magic Crystals, while Fragmented Legendary Weapons cost around one million Magic Crystals. Lionheart’s promise of a weekly transaction of three million Magic Crystals meant Skyflare was trading away three Fragmented Legendary Weapons every week!

“Commander?” At this time, even Wind Chaser was stunned by Lionheart’s offer.

The Skyflare adventurer team operated only in Meteorite City’s vicinity, and there were only so many resources available in the area. If Skyflare really pushed through with this transaction, the adventurer team would have to tighten its belt and strictly limit its future expenditures.

“Okay, I can agree to those conditions,” Shi Feng said, nodding. After giving the matter some thought, he felt that this price was probably the best he could get for the Crystals of Souls. Even if he could get a higher price at an auction, it wouldn’t be much higher. “However, before this, I wish to test you, Commander Lionheart. We can verify our transaction depending on your performance. What do you think?”

“Test our commander?” Shi Feng’s words infuriated Wind Chaser.

Crimson Billow’s complexion also darkened, a hint of hostility appearing in her eyes as she looked at Shi Feng. Even Super Guilds would not dare say that they wished to test their commander’s qualifications for cooperation, yet a person of unknown origin actually did so. Shi Feng was utterly looking down on the Skyflare adventurer team.

However, before Wind Chaser or Crimson Billow could say anything else, Lionheart extended a hand to stop them. He then looked at Shi Feng with a glint of determination in his eyes as he asked, “May I know how you wish to conduct your test, Brother Black Flame?”

“Simple. So long as you survive a hit from me, you’ll pass,” Shi Feng said decisively.
