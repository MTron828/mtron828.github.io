Chapter 453 – Power to Change the World

“Do you recognize this item, Guild Leader Black Flame?”

When Frey saw the look of surprise on Shi Feng, curiosity filled her as she picked up the bronze marble.

The bronze marble dropped by the third Devouring Earth Dragon looked and felt inconspicuous. It didn’t give off any mana fluctuations and couldn’t be identified. If it wasn’t an item dropped by a Legendary-ranked Earth Dragon, she would have probably ignored it thinking it was an ordinary marble someone dropped.

“Mhm, I do recognize it.” Shi Feng nodded. “This is something good that’s hard to come by.”

Secret Treasures were items unique to World Mode Dungeons, and they carried the power to change the world. Meanwhile, Secret Treasures could be categorized into several ranks, namely Common, Combat, Extraordinary, and Fantasy.

Meanwhile, even Common-ranked Secret Treasures were comparable to Fragmented Legendary Equipment in value, while Combat-ranked Secret TReasures were more valuable than even Fragmented Legendary Weapons.

“Is it really something good?” Frey asked as she fiddled with the bronze marble. Even when she used a Master Identification Skill, she failed to appraise it.

“This thing cannot be appraised,” Shi Feng said when he saw magic arrays appearing in Frey’s eyes. Faintly smiling, he continued, “You need to use a sufficient amount of Seven Luminaries Crystals to activate it.”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, everyone present couldn’t help but look at the bronze marble with great curiosity.

“This thing needs Seven Luminaries Crystals to activate?” Frey was surprised.

...

The preciousness of Seven Luminaries Crystals need not be said. The rich mana within the crystals gave them incredible value, and many player powers often used these crystals as the main form of currency in auctions. The crystals were also essential for players to get promoted to Tier 6.

However, Seven Luminaries Crystals were scarcely available in the Greater God’s Domain. They were so rare that a large part of why there were so few Tier 6 players in the Greater God’s Domain was that of the Seven Luminaries Crystals’ limited supply. In reality, many experts were more than capable of creating a Divine Body but couldn’t because they didn’t have access to enough Seven Luminaries Crystals.

So, Frey found it hard to imagine that an ordinary-looking marble would actually require precious Seven Luminaries Crystals to activate.

But when Frey changed her perspective, she quickly felt it was only right for the marble to have such a setting.

The entire World Mode Courtyard of Space was shrouded in mystery. The Dungeon was so strange that its Legendary-ranked Devouring Earth Dragons would only drop coin chests.

When it came to stinginess, the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s Devouring Earth Dragons definitely ranked number one out of all Legendary monsters in the Greater God’s Domain.

Outside the Eternal Realm, Tier 5 Legendary monsters would drop a minimum of one or two Fragmented Legendary items, several Epic items, and a bunch of precious raw materials when killed.

Even inside the Eternal Realm, Tier 4 Mythic monsters wouldn’t drop only coin chests when killed, let alone Tier 5 Legendary monsters.

Logically, as the difficulty setting above Heaven Mode, World Mode should offer better loot. It was very strange for World Mode to have such pitiful loot.

So, it could be considered normal for one of the items dropped in the Dungeon to require Seven Luminaries Crystal to activate.

Thinking up to this point, Frey took out a bunch of Seven Luminaries Crystals and began feeding them to the bronze marble. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

...

The bronze marble felt like it was gaining more and more life with every Seven Luminaries Crystal it merged with. The marble started with no mana fluctuations, but after only a moment, it started giving off powerful mana fluctuations rivaling that of Fragmented Legendary items.

“What a hungry beast this thing is. It still isn’t satisfied even after eating 500 units?” Unrestrained Lionheart exclaimed.

The average hegemonic power would only have a daily income of several thousand units. So, 500 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal was by no means a small amount.

After Frey fed the bronze marble a few more Seven Luminaries Crystals, glowing divine runes appeared on the marble’s surface.

“Six hundred units. Let’s hope it was worth the price,” Frey muttered as she tapped a finger on the glowing marble.

…

[Orichalcum Secret Treasure] (Tier 1 Secret Treasure, Combat)

Attaches to gauntlets. Once attached, it can increase the wearer’s Mana Protection by 15% and the attached equipment’s Basic Attributes by 10%.

…

“Incredible!” Frey’s eyes widened, pleasantly surprised by the information displayed before her.

“What kind of item is it, Vice Guild Leader?” Unrestrained Lionheart asked, his curiosity growing even greater when he saw Frey’s excited reaction. “Is it some kind of Legacy?”

...

“Take a look at it for yourself,” Frey said as she shared the Orichalcum Secret Treasure’s stats in the team chat, not bothering to hide the information.

Meanwhile, as soon as the information appeared in the team chat, everyone but Shi Feng gasped.

“This thing increases the wearer’s Mana Protection? Is this for real?”

“Wasn’t Mana Protection supposed to be fixed?”

“It is, for the most part. Thus far, it is publicly acknowledged that every player’s Mana Protection is set at a fixed value, and it will only change with the player’s tier. If news of this item gets out, it’ll probably shake up the entire Greater God’s Domain.”

Unrestrained Lionheart and the others were greatly shocked by the Orichalcum Secret Treasure’s Attributes.

In the Greater God’s Domain, all attacks made by players and monsters would carry some mana, and this attached mana would greatly increase the destructiveness of one’s attacks. However, every player also possessed Mana Protection that served to weaken the effects of mana. Meanwhile, the stronger a player’s Mana Protection, the better they could defend against mana attacks.

However, thus far, the only known way players could raise their Mana Protection was by raising their Life Rating. In other words, as players’ tiers increased, so would their Mana Protection.

This was one of the main reasons lower-tiered players couldn’t deal a lot of damage to higher-tiered players.

Now, though, the Orichalcum Secret Treasure revealed a new method for players to raise their Mana Protection.

Moreover, going by the first part of the Orichalcum Secret Treasure’s introduction, it was evident that players weren’t limited to equipping just one Secret Treasure. Instead, players could attach a Secret Treasure to every piece of equipment they wore, and the result of doing so would probably be extraordinary. At that time, players could easily transcend tiers even without any Legendary Weapons or Equipment.

...

Once the information on Secret Treasures got out, it could alter Greater God’s Domain’s existing power structure!

So, this is the World Mode difficulty? Unrestrained Lionheart couldn’t help but shudder in excitement.

Previously, he had assumed that the World Mode difficulty was merely a greater difficulty setting than God Mode and nothing more. However, by the look of things, World Mode didn’t just represent the difficulty of a Dungeon. At the same time, it represented a power that could change the Greater God’s Domain!
