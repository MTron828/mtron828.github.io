Chapter 639 – Pseudo-Divine Artifact Forger

“A 20% success rate?”

“Is that guy bluffing? I doubt even Great Grandmaster Forgers can get a 40% success rate. He’s only an Advanced Grandmaster, and his forging success rate even ranked fourth among us previously, yet he’s now claiming he can achieve a 20% success rate?”

“He’s probably trying to catch the Guild Leader’s attention.”

Following the tall young man’s answer, many of the other young geniuses in the room couldn’t help but start a hushed discussion among themselves.

Although nobody present knew that the designs Shi Feng shared were for a Secret-Silver Flying Ship’s core components, as Lifestyle Grandmasters, they could still identify the complexity of these designs. Meanwhile, their knowledge told them that some of these designs were already beyond the means of Lifestyle Grandmasters to manufacture. So, when everyone heard the tall youth saying he could manufacture all of the forging designs, their immediate reaction was to doubt his claims.

Of course, everyone could also understand why the young man would lie about his capabilities.

The current Zero Wing was akin to the midday sun in Star Lake City. It was the power with the most residential slots for Star Lake City. As a result, many geniuses and paragons from the hundreds of nearby third-tier mobile cities and thousands of towns sought to join Zero Wing.

Furthermore, the benefits Zero Wing offered to its core members were tempting even to the various corporations and powerful families. So long as one could become a core member of Zero Wing, one could spend Guild Contribution Points to exchange for precious resources such as Stardew. It was even possible to exchange for the right to enter the Eternal Realm.

The Eternal Realm was a Realm that countless players sought to enter in the current Greater God’s Domain. The opportunities available in the Eternal Realm were beyond any other Realm. There had even been rumors of ordinary Lifestyle Players becoming VIPs in conglomerates and pseudo-apex powers after learning a unique recipe or design in the Eternal Realm.

Unfortunately, as there still wasn’t a way for players to reach the Eternal Realm from the outside, Lifestyle Players outside the Eternal Realm could only look on in envy.

So, now that Zero Wing was offering its members an opportunity to enter the Eternal Realm, how could they not be excited?

Of course, they had only learned about these core member benefits after becoming internal members of Zero Wing and signing a God’s Domain Contract and a Guild Contract. This was also why they had worked so enthusiastically after joining Zero Wing. It was all so they could become core members as soon as possible.

“Huo Rong,” the tall young man answered anxiously. He could naturally hear the hushed discussions behind him, and he couldn’t help but grow worried Shi Feng might come to the same conclusion as his peers. It was especially so after he had heard all of his peers reporting completion rates of about 50 to 60 percent only.

Honestly, at this point, even he couldn’t help but start to doubt his simulation results.

However, it was a fact that he had ended up with a 20% success rate after conducting numerous simple simulations via the God’s Domain Simulation Cabin. Hence, this result should be absolutely correct. After all, the God’s Domain Simulation Cabin could perfectly simulate various matters from God’s Domain.

Even though the simulation cabin was incapable of replicating lifestyle procedures as well as it could combat, which could usually achieve over 90% uniformity, its simple simulations still shouldn’t be too far off from the real deal. At the very least, instances where one could successfully manufacture an item via the simulation cabin but couldn’t in God’s Domain shouldn’t exist.

Huo Rong? Melting Flame? Shi Feng’s curiosity was piqued when he heard the young man’s name. “Do your forging success rates fluctuate significantly? For example, do you experience situations where you get only half the average success rate when you’re unlucky, and 10 or 20 percent higher than the average when you’re lucky?”

“Mhm.” Huo Rong nodded in surprise. He didn’t think Shi Feng would know of his forging circumstances. “When I’m lucky, I can achieve success rates 10 or 20 percent higher than others. But if I’m unlucky, I’d be fortunate if I can even achieve a 10% success rate.”

Honestly, Huo Rong felt very distressed about his own unique situation. If he could stabilize his erratic forging success rates, he could have long joined a conglomerate with his younger sister and become internal members there.

“Okay, I understand.” Shi Feng nodded and smiled. “Since it’s the simulation cabin’s result, it should be correct. In that case, may I know if you are interested in becoming a core member of Zero Wing?”

“A core member of Zero Wing? Me?”

Huo Rong was stunned. Originally, he had been worried Shi Feng would refuse to believe in his result and have him manufacture the items in God’s Domain. After all, he had only managed a 20% success rate in the simple simulations.

In God’s Domain, having a 20% success rate didn’t necessarily mean players could absolutely succeed in manufacturing an item every one out of five tries. Instead, the numbers were much more down-to-earth, and players would be fortunate to even succeed once or twice out of thirty tries.

Meanwhile, the designs Shi Feng shared required materials so precious that even the various major powers would have difficulty obtaining them. At best, they could only take out a few sets on short notice, which should also be true for Zero Wing.

In that case, even if Huo Rong could perfectly transfer his simulation success rate to God’s Domain, his chances of manufacturing the items were slim. At that time, not only would he make a fool of himself, but he would also be at risk of getting kicked out of Zero Wing.

“That’s right.” Shi Feng nodded. “And it’s not just you. Anyone who has achieved a 70% completion rate can also become a core member of Zero Wing.”

Huo Rong’s name was known by all in Shi Feng’s previous life. One could even say that his name was recorded in the annals of the Greater God’s Domain’s history. Only, by the time Huo Rong had risen to fame, he was already much older than he was now. Moreover, at the time, Huo Rong didn’t belong to any of the various major powers. Instead, he was only a member of an ordinary hegemonic power.

Meanwhile, Huo Rong’s fame wasn’t because he was unbelievably talented. Even at his peak, he had only managed to develop his forging skills to the Basic Great Grandmaster standard. Craftsmen like Silent Wonder and Silk Radish would leave him in the dust if compared only in ranks.

Instead, the reason for Huo Rong’s fame was his ability to produce items sought after by even the various apex powers. Or, more specifically, he had manufactured items that were outside the abilities of even Craftsman Forgers.

Pseudo-Divine Artifacts!

Or, more specifically, Replicas of bona fide Divine Artifacts. Moreover, the precision of these Replicas was so high that they could reach the Fragmented Divine Artifact rank. Compared to Replicas that could only achieve ranks such as Legendary and Fragmented Legendary, Huo Rong’s Divine Artifact Replicas were in a completely different realm.

Hence, when the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers learned that a Pseudo-Divine Artifact had come from the hands of a Great Grandmaster Forger, they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. After all, even Craftsman Forgers could only manufacture Legendary Weapons and Equipment at a very low success rate, let alone Pseudo-Divine Artifacts. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yet, Huo Rong had accomplished this miraculous feat not just once, but three times, silencing everyone who thought he had only gotten lucky.

As for the reason Huo Rong could produce Pseudo-Divine Artifacts, it was because he possessed a Divine Craftsman Talent that nobody else had. Even Huo Rong himself had only discovered this Talent after getting promoted into a Great Grandmaster Forger.

Meanwhile, the Talent’s effects were simple. It granted Huo Rong a minimum success rate of 10 to 20% when he was manufacturing weapons and equipment above the Epic rank and reduced his success rate by 10% when he was manufacturing weapons and equipment at the Epic rank or below. If he was manufacturing items that weren’t weapons or equipment, his success rate would increase or decrease depending on the rank of the materials used.

The existence of this Talent was why Huo Rong had been ignored for a long time.

Grandmaster Forgers were very common for the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers. Meanwhile, these Grandmaster Forgers would be tasked with producing Epic Weapons and Equipment most of the time, and very rarely would they have an opportunity to manufacture weapons and equipment above the Epic rank.

Even if such a project fell into the hands of Grandmaster Forgers, those selected would usually be Advanced Grandmaster Forgers with a good track record. For someone like Huo Rong, who couldn’t even produce Epic Weapons and Equipment at a decent success rate, there was no way he would be given an opportunity to produce items above the Epic rank.

“My little sister, Huo Ling, is also as talented as I am in forging, Guild Leader. Although she didn’t achieve a 70% completion rate, she is only one step short of becoming a Great Grandmaster Magician. If she can become a Great Grandmaster Magician, I believe she can fully complete the forging designs as well,” Huo Rong said as he pointed at a 16-year-old girl standing nearby.

Only one step short of becoming a Great Grandmaster Magician? Shi Feng’s eyes brightened as he turned to look at the girl Huo Rong was pointing at. Then, he eagerly asked, “Is that true?”
