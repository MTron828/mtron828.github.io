Chapter 290 – Legend

How is this possible?!

When Death Omen saw Laura Crader remaining intact, she couldn’t help but rub her eyes and take a second glance.

Meteor’s Thousand Threads was an attack that forced the third-ranked player on the God-ranked Expert List to use an Invulnerability Skill. Yet, Laura had blocked it perfectly without using an Invulnerability Skill. On top of that, she didn’t even manage to see when Laura had unsheathed her sword and brandished it…

Standing in the distance, Colorful Lunarite also gaped in shock when she saw this outcome, her mind having difficulty accepting this situation.

The average expert might not be aware of Meteor’s trademark move, but as a genius nurtured internally by the Green God Corporation, Colorful Lunarite knew a little about it. Meanwhile, according to the corporation’s report, so long as Meteor successfully executed Thousand Threads, even paragons like the third-ranked Saint Nine would have to do their best to avoid it.

So, it was incredibly shocking to Colorful Lunarite to see Laura unscathed. Most importantly, she didn’t even see what Laura had done just now!

This situation caused Colorful Lunarite to turn to Su Qianliu, hoping that she could get an explanation from the other party. However, Su Qianliu was equally bewildered by this situation, so she could only respond to Colorful Lunarite’s curious gaze with a bitter smile.

Su Qianliu was aware that Laura Crader was very powerful. After all, the other party was the strongest expert in the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s Slumber City. Only, Su Qianliu never thought that Laura Crader would be?this?strong.

After silence enveloped the battlefield for a short moment, Meteor suddenly revealed a look of realization. Then, he asked, “I truly did not think the Miniature Ancient World would have an expert like you. Players have only begun to reach Tier 4 recently. At this point in time, even titled experts have, at best, developed their Mana Bodies to a Completion Rate of around 110%, yet you have already reached the maximum of 120%. Who are you?”

Her Mana Body is at 120% Completion Rate??When Death Omen heard Meteor’s words, she turned to look at Laura Crader as if she were looking at a monster.

The Mana Body was a player’s foundation. The greater the control a player had over their Mana Body, the greater the strength they could exhibit. Normally, a peak expert would be fortunate if they could unlock their Mana Body to 100% Completion Rate shortly after getting promoted to Tier 4.

As for going beyond the 100% limit, to do so would require players to modify and improve the method they used to control their Mana Body, making their method better suit themselves.

......

However, breaking the Mana Body’s 100% limit was not an easy feat. Achieving further improvements after breaking the 100% limit was an even more challenging task.

Typically, peak experts could, at most, develop the Completion Rate of their Mana Bodies to 105%. Moreover, reaching this Completion Rate required a lot of time and effort. As for fourth-floor experts, their progress would generally hit a wall after they reached 110%.

Moreover, the higher the rank of a player’s Mana Body, the more difficult it would be to improve.

Even a peerless genius like Meteor had only reached 109% Completion Rate with his Epic Mana Body.

Although Meteor couldn’t tell what rank Laura’s Mana Body was at, it didn’t matter, even if it was only a Gold Mana Body. Reaching 120% Completion Rate in a Gold Mana Body was still an incredible feat even in the Greater God’s Domain. If Laura had an Epic Mana Body, she would be a legend in the Greater God’s Domain.

After sheathing her longsword, Laura calmly replied, “I am only an ordinary member of Asura passing by.”

An ordinary member of Asura??Death Omen couldn’t help but cast a look of contempt at Laura.

Only a fool would believe such words!

“We’re leaving.”

After taking one last look at the so-called “ordinary member of Asura,” Meteor put away his broken sword, turned around, and left.

“Commander Meteor! Are we going to retreat, just like that?” Death Omen was stunned by Meteor’s decision to retreat. “This is the perfect opportunity to inflict heavy damage to Zero Wing’s main force. If we miss this opportunity, Zero Wing will create many problems for us in the future.”

Death Omen admitted that Laura Crader was much stronger than she imagined. However, Meteor still had cards he hadn’t used. So long as he used those hidden cards, defeating Laura Crader might not be out of the question.

“I cannot stop her in my current state,” Meteor said as he glanced at Death Omen. “If you wish to continue pursuing Zero Wing’s main force, I won’t stop you. However, I’m afraid you don’t have much time left.”

After saying so, Meteor promptly left the area with the Paimon Conglomerate’s members. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Dammit!”

When Death Omen saw Meteor and the others leaving, she gritted her teeth and retreated as well.

Now that the Land of Ancient Dragons had transformed into a God Mode Regional Dungeon, not only did it house the incredibly dangerous Spirit Devourers, but it also housed an abundance of Seven Luminaries Crystals in its inner zone. Information on these Seven Luminaries Crystals would spread across the Miniature Ancient World sooner or later. At that time, thousands of powers would flock to this place. After all, nobody could resist the temptation of half an Elementary God’s Domain’s daily production volume of Seven Luminaries Crystals. So, they needed to start making preparations as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, Colorful Lunarite, Su Qianliu, and the others experienced another round of surprise when they saw Meteor’s team retreating. Colorful Lunarite, in particular, had her evaluation of Zero Wing and the Asura Mercenary Alliance thoroughly renewed.

After witnessing Shi Feng’s and Laura Crader’s strength, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Asura Mercenary Alliance had two experts capable of rivaling the God-ranked Expert List’s top three players. Not even the Higher God’s Domain’s hegemonic powers possessed such strength in the Miniature Ancient World.

This won’t do. I have to inform Vice President Xia about this as soon as possible.?Thinking up to this point, Colorful Lunarite quickly had one of her subordinates on board the warship go offline to inform Xia Qingying about today’s matter.

…

Meanwhile, inside the Land of Ancient Dragons’ temple…

“There is no escape for you, heaven’s blessed!” Demon King Firenze said gloatingly as he launched one Tier 5 Spell after another at Shi Feng.

Even though Shi Feng was fully focused on evasion and did not make any excess movements, his HP had still fallen to 10% in no time. He also didn’t have any time to consume a Regeneration Potion, so it was only a matter of time before he got killed.

This is my limit.

Shi Feng revealed a bitter smile when he saw that Godslayer’s duration was about to end.

Originally, Shi Feng thought that he would have a chance of surviving if he broke the chains binding Dragon Princess Kalisha.

Unfortunately, Kalisha remained asleep even after her restraints were broken. The only changes that took place after the chains broke were the temple’s space becoming increasingly stable and the temple’s mana becoming increasingly denser. Dense Eternal Energy had even started to flood the temple, allowing Shi Feng’s mind to achieve unprecedented clarity.

With his clear state of mind, Shi Feng was able to quickly break through the 100% threshold of his Legendary Mana Body. Then, once he integrated Holy Annihilation’s mana control technique with his Legendary Mana Body’s mana control technique, he instantly elevated his Mana Body to 110% Completion Rate. Because of this, his Physique, the density of his Mana, and the strength of his Mana also experienced a qualitative transformation.

Combined with Godslayer’s effect, Shi Feng was already close to rivaling a Tier 5 Sword Saint in strength. It was only with this enhanced strength that he had managed to dodge and survive the bombardment of Tier 5 Spells from Firenze.

However, once Godslayer’s duration ended, Shi Feng would lose his only means of surviving Demon King Firenze’s attacks.

“Die!”

When Firenze noticed that Shi Feng had already lost his Tier 5 Mana and Tier 5 Concentration, he promptly raised his scepter and sent three Tier 5 Destruction Spells blasting at Shi Feng from three different directions.

Thump!

However, before Firenze’s Spells could hit Shi Feng, a loud heartbeat suddenly echoed throughout the temple. Then, the entire temple fell silent, and the mana powering Firenze’s three Destruction Spells stagnated. At the same time, sweat began appearing on Firenze’s ferocious face as he anxiously turned his crimson eyes toward the origin of the heartbeat. Firenze had gotten so anxious that he had even forgotten to maintain his Spells, which, in turn, caused the three Destruction Spells to disintegrate.

Immediately afterward, Shi Feng also turned to the source of the heartbeat.

At this time, Kalisha, the Dragon Princess who remained suspended in midair motionlessly this entire time, suddenly opened her eyes. When those indescribable silver eyes opened, both Shi Feng and Firenze subconsciously took a step back. They felt as if their lives were firmly held by this pair of eyes at this moment, and their life and death were no longer in their control.

Meanwhile, the instant Kalisha awakened, a system notification also entered Shi Feng’s ears.
