Chapter 135 – Holy Land That Surpasses All!

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s admission, Liu Wusheng and Blue Sheath couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

How can there be a Guild City so close to the Boundary Mountain Range?! This shouldn’t be possible! Blue Sheath couldn’t help but deny reality as she looked at Abyssal Star City.[1]

On the main continent, Guild Towns and Guild Cities had long since become things that were commonly seen. There even existed quite a few Guild Holy Cities.

However, the Miniature Ancient World had only appeared recently. Yet, while the various powers were fighting tooth for nail to gain the privilege of controlling the various Mana Outposts temporarily, Zero Wing had already acquired itself a Guild City. Moreover, this Guild City was located right next to the Boundary Mountain Range, the neutral zone that everyone was trying to secure a foothold in...

When Blue Sheath thought about the advantage Zero Wing would have over the various powers, she couldn’t help but get goosebumps.

“Is this the reason for your confidence, Mr. Black Flame?” Liu Wusheng couldn’t help but ask Shi Feng while looking at Abyssal Star City.

Zero Wing would have an overwhelming advantage over the other powers in God’s Domain with the Abyssal Star Primordial City in its possession. Naturally, Mysterious Moon, Zero Wing’s partner, would also gain a significant advantage over the other powers in entering the neutral zone.

Meanwhile, with this advantage, Mysterious Moon could abandon its reliance on the main continent completely. So long as Mysterious Moon could secure a stable foothold in the Miniature Ancient World’s neutral zone, it would be able to obtain much more significant profits than before. In fact, many superpowers would desperately try to partner with Mysterious Moon in the future. At that time, World Dominators would have difficulty even pressuring Mysterious Moon, let alone dealing with Zero Wing.

“This city?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but shake his head and laugh when he heard Liu Wusheng’s question. “This city isn’t the reason for my confidence. Also, I’ve already stated before that so long as Witch’s Sin partners with Zero Wing, I will give Witch’s Sin’s Tier 5 experts a significantly greater chance at reaching Tier 6.”

“This isn’t all you have to show us?” Blue Sheath couldn’t help but doubt Shi Feng’s words.

If news spread that a Guild City had appeared next to the Boundary Mountain Range, it would definitely send shockwaves throughout the entire God’s Domain. Compared to this piece of news, Shi Feng’s so-called “greater chance” at reaching Tier 6 paled significantly.

It was commonly known that opportunities that could increase a Tier 5 player’s chances at reaching Tier 6 were, at best, a God Legacy or something of roughly equivalent standard. However, even a God Legacy could only increase a Tier 5 player’s promotion success rate by 10%, while most other fortuitous opportunities couldn’t even provide a 10% increase.

In Blue Sheath’s opinion, the fortuitous opportunity Shi Feng hinted at was most likely the attack he had used to annihilate Shadow’s experts in the New Moon Forest. After all, according to Liu Wusheng, the attack was a product of a Saint-level Mana Technique.

A Mana Technique of such caliber naturally could offer players a certain degree of help reaching Tier 6. Moreover, this help would come in a significant amount. At the very least, it would be much better than the average Tier 6 Legacy Guidance.

However, even a Saint-level Mana Technique would pale significantly compared to an actual God Legacy.

“You’ll find out once we head inside.”

Shi Feng did not bother explaining himself. Instead, he rode the Thunder Wolf into the city.

At this time, Abyssal Star City’s security had improved drastically thanks to the many NPC guards the city recruited. As a result, the number of NPCs visiting the city had also skyrocketed. When Shi Feng’s group made their way down the main street, they could see merchant caravans parked along the entire street while selling their wares.

Meanwhile, the quantity and quality of the items these NPC Merchants sold far surpassed the NPC Merchants found in NPC Cities. Some NPC Merchants were even selling Epic Weapons and Equipment, Tier 3 Magic Scrolls, and Tier 3 Skill and Spell Books, things that normally weren’t sold in NPC Cities.

However, compared to the NPC Merchants, what surprised Liu Wusheng and Blue Sheath, even more, was the Mana density and the purification rate in Abyssal Star City. Both of these factors were directly related to the leveling speed of players. Meanwhile, with Abyssal Star City’s superior Mana environment and purification rate, players operating from this city would have a significant advantage when entering the neutral zone inside the Boundary Mountain Range.

After all, players would have to fully unlock their Mana Body before reaching Tier 4. Meanwhile, a place with high Mana density would benefit players seeking to unlock their Mana Body’s potential. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After arriving before the primordial tower in the middle of the city, Shi Feng hopped off the Thunder Wolf and looked at his two passengers, saying, “We’re here.”

An ancient tower? Liu Wusheng couldn’t help but grow confused as he looked at the majestic tower before him.

Ancient civilizations indeed possessed many powerful constructions that could aid players in their development.

However, the assistance these constructions could provide was only limited to players below Tier 5. After reaching Tier 5, the help players could receive from an ancient civilization’s Legacy was negligible. If Tier 5 players wished to make further progress, they could only rely on themselves to figure things out. After all, Tier 6 existences were incredibly rare, even among ancient civilizations.

“There are special rooms inside this tower that can let players have an easier time grasping the operating principles of the various types of Mana,” Shi Feng said when he noticed the look of confusion on Liu Wushneg’s face. “However, I doubt you’ll believe me even if I tell you this, so it’s best if you head inside and experience it for yourself, Mr. Liu.”

After saying so, Shi Feng brought Liu Wusheng and Blue Sheath into the primordial tower. Then, he let Liu Wusheng enter one of the rooms to experience the miniature world inside it.

An hour later, Liu Wusheng left his room with a reluctant expression. His desire to stay inside the room was so obvious that even Blue Sheath could see it.

“Is the inside of that room really that good, Great Elder?” Blue Sheath asked curiously.

Currently, Blue Sheath had yet to touch upon the operating principles of Mana. This was because she was only at the standard of a Tier 4 player. Meanwhile, what mattered most for her was not to learn about the operating principles of Mana but to improve her precise control over Mana. Otherwise, she wouldn’t even be able to achieve an entry-level understanding of the operating principles of Mana.

“Good?” Liu Wusheng shook his head. Then, with eyes full of excitement and madness, he said, “This is no longer a question of whether it is good or not. This place has already surpassed all holy lands in existence! If I can stay inside such a room long-term, I am confident my chances of reaching Tier 6 in the future will exceed 60%!”

Shi Feng was not surprised that Liu Wusheng would offer such a high evaluation. Looking at Liu Wusheng, Shi Feng smiled and asked, “May I know if Witch’s Sin is willing to partner with Zero Wing now, Mr. Liu?”

TL Notes:

[1]Boundary Mountain Range: I’m not sure if the author forgot, but he’s switched to using “Boundary Mountain Range(两界山脉)” in this chapter instead of Boundary River. So far, there have already been two variations of the Boundary River – i) 断界河; ii) 两界河. However, he has used “Boundary Mountain Range” multiple times in this chapter. I’m not sure if he’s decided to change Boundary River to Boundary Mountain Range, or if the Boundary River is something inside the Boundary Mountain Range.
