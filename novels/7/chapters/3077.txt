Chapter 152 – Outside of God’s Domain

“Five million points for one mission?”

Gentle Snow couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in shock.

The Zero Wing Alliance’s Contribution Points were incredibly valuable. This could be seen simply by looking at the Ancient God’s Blood, which cost ten million points per drop. Even if she demanded a Main Guild City for a drop of Ancient God’s Blood, the various superpowers probably wouldn’t hesitate to accept the trade.

There was no way a superpower would refuse to accept a deal as wonderful as one Main City for one expert with an Epic Mana Body.

Yet, now, Shi Feng was offering the equivalent of half a drop of Ancient God’s Blood for just one mission.

Unless Shi Feng was incredibly generous, it meant that the difficulty of this mission was incredibly high.

“With Hundred Flower Palace’s strength, there shouldn’t be any Dungeon that could trouble them in the current Miniature Ancient World.” Unable to hold back her curiosity, Gentle Snow asked, “Are they asking us to fight against a superpower?”

Hundred Flower Palace was a top-tier first-rate Guild. It must’ve dispatched quite a few Tier 5 experts to the Miniature Ancient World.

While the Miniature Ancient World’s Hell Mode Team Dungeons were challenging, they weren’t insurmountable challenges if a team consisting of Tier 5 experts and a large number of Refinement Realm experts raided them. At most, it would take some time to complete the raid.

Hence, there was no way Hundred Flower Palace would pay a huge price just to get Zero Wing’s help to raid a Team Dungeon. Not to mention, this was a price even Zero Wing could not refuse.

The only possibility Gentle Snow could think of was that Hundred Flower Palace was facing a problem similar to Mysterious Moon in that it was competing against a superpower for resources.

“No, they’re only asking for help to raid a somewhat special secret land,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

“Raiding a secret land? Yet Hundred Flower Palace is only offering two slots to Zero Wing?” Gentle Snow couldn’t help but grow even more confused. “What is Hundred Flower Palace thinking?”

There were indeed certain secret lands with extraordinarily high difficulty. There were even some secret lands that superpowers couldn’t necessarily raid independently. However, a secret land would typically have a maximum entry limit of 100 players or more.

It was true that Zero Wing didn’t have many experts with great combat standards. However, Zero Wing had the Primordial Mana Equipment Sets. If Zero Wing equipped its Refinement Realm experts with these sets, it would have several dozen experts with near-Tier 4 strength.

While Hundred Flower Palace had many experts, those possessing near-Tier 4 strength probably didn’t amount to more than a handful. So, Gentle Snow had a hard time understanding why Hundred Flower Palace was only asking Zero Wing for two players.

When hiring an outside power to help raid a Dungeon or secret land, one would typically pay based on the success or failure of the raid. Rarely anybody would accept payment based on headcount.

Since Hundred Flower Palace wanted to raid a secret land, the normal decision for it to make would be to assign as many slots as possible to Zero Wing. Or was Hundred Flower Palace so confident that Zero Wing could complete the secret land with just two players?

“I already said this secret land is somewhat special,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “Moreover, the raid this time won’t just involve Zero Wing and Hundred Flower Palace. It will also involve many experts from another God’s Domain. These are all the slots Hundred Flower Palace can take out for now.”

“Many experts from another God’s Domain?” Gentle Snow was shocked by Shi Feng’s words. “How is this possible? The Boundary Mountain Range has yet to open. How can many players from the other God’s Domain show up on our side already?”

Gentle Snow was aware that Shi Feng’s identity was extraordinary and that it was likely that he came from another God’s Domain. However, the various God’s Domains were strictly separated from each other. It might be possible for one player to appear in their God’s Domain, but it shouldn’t be possible for many Outerworld players to appear right now.

“No, it’s not the other God’s Domain connected to the Miniature Ancient World, but a completely different one instead,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “The Stratified Abyssal Realm. I doubt you’ve heard of this name before, but this is a special space that connects the Endless Abyss with the many worlds of God’s Domain. It is also one of the few places that allow players from the many worlds of God’s Domain to gather and interact with each other. The only problem is that it has a strict level limit, and players are prohibited from entering it once they exceed the level limit.

“Hundred Flower Palace obtained a key that grants access to a special secret realm by chance, and that secret realm houses a pathway leading to the Stratified Abyssal Realm. However, that pathway is sealed behind multiple seals. Aside from having a level limit of 110, the pathway also has a strict entry limit that makes it nigh-impossible to clear. Originally, Hundred Flower Palace hadn’t planned on challenging this pathway due to the impossible difficulty. However, recently, Hundred Flower Palace found out that it wasn’t the only power that had access to that secret land. Instead, a power from another God’s Domain also had access to it.

“This Outerworld power also has a key for the secret land. Or, more specifically, one part of the full key. When these two key fragments are used together, they can weaken the seals on the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s pathway. So, Hundred Flower Palace and that Outerworld power agreed to work together. Since the pathway only allowed twelve players to enter at a time, both sides will send six players each. Then, once they clear the pathway, they will split the awarded entry slots for the Stratified Abyssal Realm based on their performance during the raid. So, Hundred Flower Palace hopes that we can send two people to help in the raid.

“As for the compensation, I doubt I’d need to tell you what it is.”

“The entry slots for the Stratified Abyssal Realm?” Gentle Snow answered instinctively. Although she didn’t know what kind of place the Stratified Abyssal Realm was, the fact that it connected the many worlds of God’s Domain already made it invaluable.

It should be known that the Boundary Mountain Range was merely a gathering place for two God’s Domains. Even then, the various superpowers were already losing their minds over it.

“That’s right.” Shi Feng nodded. “So long as we can help Hundred Flower Palace outperform that other power, Hundred Flower Palace is willing to give us half of its entry slots!”

Although the two powers had agreed to leave each other with a minimum number of entry slots, the guaranteed amount was only 10% of the total awarded slots. In other words, it was possible for one side to obtain up to 90% of the total awarded slots.

When neither side knew about the other’s background, no amount of preparation could be considered excessive. There was no saying whether the other side would seek help from other experts and powers, either.

However, Hundred Flower Palace dared not seek the help of the various superpowers. Or, more specifically, it dared not seek the help of a power capable of destroying it. Yet, at the same time, the power it sought help from also needed to have extremely powerful experts. This was a very conflicting set of criteria, and only a few powers could meet it. Meanwhile, Zero Wing happened to be one of these powers.

Currently, the various superpowers’ peak experts had already reached Level 105, which was also the recommended level to raid the pathway. So, Hundred Flower Palace naturally couldn’t sit still any longer. After all, the other side didn’t come from the Miniature Ancient World. There was a possible chance that the other side might find a group of Level 110 players and forcibly break through the seals. If that happened, Hundred Flower Palace would end up with nothing.

Hence, Cleansed Rue had sought out Shi Feng to establish such a partnership.

Of course, Hundred Flower Palace wasn’t so generous as to give away half of the slots to the Stratified Abyssal Realm just for some help. It had also attached an additional condition: the primordial tower’s training slots. Hundred Flower Palace demanded to acquire 20 Silver membership slots and 80 Bronze membership slots in the Asura Mercenary Alliance. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

To put it bluntly, if not for Hundred Flower Palace and the other powers discovering the primordial tower’s uniqueness, Hundred Flower Palace wouldn’t have sought out Zero Wing for partnership so quickly.

“If you don’t have any problems on your side, we’ll head over there now. Hundred Flower Palace is quite anxious about this matter. I’ve also been waiting for you to come out this entire time,” Shi Feng said as he took out two translucent crystals. Then, he passed one of them to Gentle Snow and continued, “This is the teleportation crystal for the secret land. Although it can only be used once, it can teleport players directly into the secret land.”

“I’m ready anytime.”

After Gentle Snow finally understood the cause and effect of this situation, a hint of anticipation appeared in her eyes. After all, this was a good opportunity to learn about other God’s Domain!

Afterward, Shi Feng and Gentle Snow disappeared from the office as they got teleported to the secret land.
