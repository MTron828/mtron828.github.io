Chapter 2877 – Divine Dragon’s Might!

“A Tier 4 Dragon?!”

“It’s a real Tier 4 Dragon!” Any veteran of God’s Domain would have heard of the creatures known as Dragons. Ancient Rock City’s inhabitants, who were at Tier 3 on average, had an even better understanding of Dragons. However, when everyone in Ancient Rock City saw the Dragon in the sky, they finally understood how terrifying Dragons were. The Tier 4 Dragon that had just appeared above Ancient Rock City was around 500 meters long, its massive body blotting out the sun. Its aura covered a radius of several thousand yards, making every Tier 3 player in that area shudder involuntarily. Compared to the Tier 4 Evil Dark Dragons protecting Ancient Rock City, this Tier 4 Dragon was akin to a God.

“This is a fake! This must be a fake!”

“How can a player summon a real Tier 4 Dragon?!”

The various powers’ experts standing atop the city walls revealed expressions of shock and horror. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A Tier 4 Dragon rivaled Tier 5 existences. Current Tier 4 players couldn’t afford to provoke it. Likewise, it shouldn’t be something players could control. Nevertheless, Shi Feng had summoned a Tier 4 Dragon. How could they believe this?

This situation was even more unbelievable and shocking than Shi Feng’s promotion to Tier 5. After all, given enough time, a Dragon would reach Tier 5 without fail.

Meanwhile, a Tier 5 Dragon was practically an invincible existence in God’s Domain!

“Everyone, don’t panic! While a Tier 4 Dragon is scary, Ancient Rock City’s defensive magic array isn’t weak, either!” Saint’s Heart’s Guild Leader, Furious Fist, shouted hurriedly when he saw the panicked defenders. “It’s just one more Tier 5 combatant! So long as we combine our strengths, Black Flame will still be helpless against us!”

Furious Fist’s words calmed Ancient Rock City’s experts somewhat. When they remembered how extraordinary the city’s defensive magic array was, they felt that defending against Zero Wing’s assault wouldn’t be impossible.

However, regardless of this battle’s outcome, most likely nobody in God’s Domain would dare provoke Zero Wing anymore. Zero Wing would also officially become God’s Domain’s number one Guild.

After all, which player force in God’s Domain could contend against the combination of a Tier 5 player and a Tier 4 Dragon?

At this time, some of the Dark Guilds based in Ancient Rock City started regretting making an enemy of Zero Wing. While they might escape tragedy today, thanks to Ancient Rock City, what about the future?

They couldn’t possibly hide in Ancient Rock City forever, right?

While the various Dark Guilds regretted their decisions, Thousand Miles’s complexion turned indescribably ashen as he looked at the Dragon in the sky.

Noticing Thousand Miles’s pallidness, Furious Fist asked, “Vice Guild Leader Miles, what’s wrong? Is there a problem with that Dragon?”

No matter how many times Furious Fist inspected the Dragon hovering in the sky with his ordinary Identification Skill, the result said this Dragon was the real deal. Moreover, there was no doubt that the Dragon was Tier 4, and it had reached Level 165. However, he couldn’t get any further information on the Dragon without a higher-ranking Identification Skill.

As a Vice Guild Leader of Miracle, Thousand Miles should have a high-ranking Identification Skill, so it wouldn’t be strange if he managed to see some more information.

A look of despair appeared on Thousand Miles’s face as he said, “That’s not just a Dragon... That’s a Divine Dragon! A Silver Divine Dragon!”

“Divine... Dragon?” Furious Fist was stunned. Glaring at Thousand Miles, he demanded, “Brother Miles, you’re not joking with me, right? If you are, this joke isn’t funny at all.” Divine Dragons were kings among the Dragon race. An ordinary Dragon and a Divine Dragon were as different as an ordinary monster and an Archaic Species. The two were completely different creations.

Turning to Furious Fist, Thousand Miles smiled wryly and said, “I wish that were the case, but do you think I’m joking?”

Thousand Miles regretted using his high-ranking Identification Skill on the Dragon. Had he not probed any further, he would’ve held some hope for victory in his heart. Now, though, no such hope existed.

Meanwhile, when the players who had fled Ancient Rock City gazed at the distant Silver Divine Dragon, they were flabbergasted for a long time.

“Is this why Zero Wing was confident in attacking Ancient Rock City?” “A Divine Dragon!? I must be dreaming!” “That’s right! This must be a dream! I just reached Tier 4, so how could Black Flame have reached Tier 5 and gained control over a Divine Dragon already?! This is a dream!”

Many people began deluding themselves as they looked at the Silver Divine Dragon, none of them willing to face reality.

However, Beast Emperor, who stood atop the city gate, had no plans of giving up. Glaring at the Divine Dragon in the sky, he ranted with a maniacal expression, “Black Flame! So what if you have a Divine Dragon?! My Ancient Grandmaster Magic Array can stop it!”

The Silver Divine Dragon in the sky suddenly opened its maw before Beast Emperor could continue. The next instant, all Mana within a 10,000-yard radius vanished, and everyone within this area felt indescribably stifled.

“Roar!”

Accompanied by a deafening roar, a beam of divine light devoured the entire Ancient Rock City.

Divine Dragon’s Breath!

When the dazzling divine light descended upon Ancient Rock City, it forced all players within a radius of several tens of thousands of yards to shield their eyes. The divine light gradually faded away, and only then did everyone open their eyes again to inspect the breath attack’s effect.

“This... How... Impossible!” When the players standing several thousand yards from Ancient Rock City saw the city again, they were utterly dumbfounded. The Divine Dragon’s Breath didn’t just shatter Ancient Rock City’s defensive magic array. It had even vaporized the towering City Lord’s Mansion at the center of the city-along with almost every player and building in the city. Taking their place was a massive crater that spanned the entire city. Only the Tier 4 experts on the city walls who managed to activate their Lifesaving Skills in time and the two Faux Saint Slayers had survived the attack.

Everything inside Ancient Rock City’s perimeter wall had been reduced to a wasteland.

“No! No! This isn’t possible!”

Beast Emperor fell into chaos and madness as he looked at what remained of his city. And he wasn’t alone. Furious Fist’s mind also stopped working at this cataclysmic scene, his body crumbling powerlessly to the ground.

cr

All of the investments we’ve made!

All of the forces we’ve gathered!

Gone!

As if they were nothing but a joke!

Thousand Miles, who had also survived the ordeal, was rendered speechless for a long time.

One attack!

It had taken just one attack for Ancient Rock City, a city rivaling Main Cities, to disappear!

Who could believe this?

Zero Wing’s members aboard the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship were similarly stunned by this scene. This was especially true for Ji Luorong and Crimson Mask, who had been active on the western continent until recently. An indescribable sense of shock filled the two.

The western continent had legends describing the Dragons’ devastating power and how a single breath attack could destroy entire cities. There were also stories of kingdoms meeting their end because they had angered a Dragon.

Previously, Ji Luorong and Crimson Mask treated these stories as mere folklore.

Now, they finally understood that those stories weren’t just legends to embellish God’s Domain but facts!

In reality, even Shi Feng was shocked by this outcome.

This is the power of a Divine Dragon?

When Shi Feng saw the ruin before him and Auerbeck’s nonchalant demeanor, he was momentarily at a loss for words.

Shi Feng had seen Tier 6 God-ranked experts single-handedly destroy cities in the past. However, compared to the power displayed by those Tier 6 God-ranked experts, Auerbeck’s performance gave Shi Feng a much greater shock.

This was because Auerbeck was only at Tier 4!

Originally, Shi Feng thought that Auerbeck’s breath attack would, at most, deplete a significant portion of the defensive magic array’s energy. Yet, the entire city had disappeared.

He couldn’t help looking at the crazed Beast Emperor apologetically. He even wanted to tell Beast Emperor that he hadn’t done this on purpose.

Of course, while Shi Feng pitied Beast Emperor, he did not show the latter any mercy. Unsheathing the Abyssal Blade, he activated the Tier 4 Darkness Bind, binding Beast Emperor and the other surviving defenders.

Now that Ancient Rock City’s defensive magic array was no more, Beast Emperor and the others were subject to the full power of Shi Feng’s Mana Domain. Without the ability to manipulate the ambient Mana, Beast Emperor and the others were basically Tier 3 players with above-average Basic Attributes. Hence, they were utterly incapable of resisting Shi Feng and got caught easily. And under the restraint of Darkness Bind, they couldn’t die even if they wanted to.

After Shi Feng destroyed Ancient Rock City and captured Beast Emperor and the others, news of this battle spread like wildfire across the entire God’s Domain.
