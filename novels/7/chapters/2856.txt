Chapter 2857 - Black Flame?

“You’re Black Flame?” Brut was stunned when he saw Shi Feng.

Half-step Tier 5!

In the current era, where the various superpowers barely had any Tier 4 players under their command, a Half-step Tier 5 existence was practically invincible. In fact, one would have difficulty finding a Half-step Tier 5 existence even among the Outerworld’s players and NPCs.

“That’s right. I am,” Shi Feng said, nodding. “So, it’s Guild Leader Black Flame. Everything before was only a misunderstanding. We don’t have any intentions of isolating the Starlight Fortress,” Brut said, smiling fawningly. “Since you aren’t interested in partnering with us, the Blood Alliance won’t force the issue, Guild Leader Black Flame. If there is nothing else, we will take our leave now.”

As soon as Brut finished speaking, he turned around, planning to leave the Starlight Fortress together with the Blood Alliance’s members. He had no intention of staying even a second longer.

“A misunderstanding?” Shi Feng laughed at Brut’s words. “Guild Leader Brut, you brought over a dozen Tier 4 NPCs and came all the way here to declare that you plan to isolate the Starlight Fortress, yet you’re telling me this is a misunderstanding?

“Since you’ve already come here, then stay here!”

After saying so, Shi Feng manifested his Mana Domain, enveloping a 4,000-yard radius in liquid Mana. As soon as Shi Feng unleashed his Mana Domain, Brut and the others stiffened. Their bodies felt indescribably heavy as if they had sunk into a swamp. The Level 160-plus, Tier 4 NPCs were just barely able to counter this suppression by releasing their own Mana Domains. However, none of them could manipulate the Mana around them.

Fithalia was astonished when Shi Feng took action. She never thought that he would do so without a second word. After all, the Blood Alliance’s side had more than a dozen Tier 4 NPCs. While these NPCs might not be a match for Shi Feng in a one-on-one fight, if they worked together, they could potentially take on even a Tier 5 existence.

“Not good! This is World Creation!” the elderly Tier 4 NPC leading the other NPCs exclaimed, an indescribably grim expression appearing on his face as he stared at Shi Feng.

The fact that Shi Feng was at the Half-step Tier 5 standard was already plenty frightening. That, combined with his control over Mana being at the World Creation standard, meant he could fight Tier 5 existences already. In front of such an expert, even a group of Tier 4 individuals would be insignificant.

What made Tier 4 individuals much more powerful than Tier 3 individuals was their ability to strengthen their abilities using the ambient Mana. However, individuals who had reached the World Creation standard could create a miniature world with their Mana Domain; all the Mana within the Domain would operate by rules favorable to the user and disadvantageous to hostile forces.

Unless one had similarly reached the World Creation standard, manipulating the ambient Mana while standing in a World Creation-level Mana Domain would be impossible. One could only rely on the Mana in one’s body to do battle, essentially losing all the advantages of Tier 4.

World Creation was something Shi Feng achieved after his Concentration had reached the Tier 5 standard. To be precise, he had first reached the Grandmaster Magician standard after his Concentration had reached the Tier 5 standard; then, his Mana Domain had automatically transformed into a miniature world. He didn’t even have to transform it consciously.

“Run!” Brut shouted in a panic. “Run? With your abilities?” Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and activated Darkness Bind.

After getting upgraded to Tier 4, Darkness Bind’s range had improved tremendously. The next moment, pitch-black chains emerged from the void within a 500-yard radius and instantly constrained the Blood Alliance members’ movements. The chains not only prevented the use of Skills and Spells but also drastically reduced their targets’ mobility.

Shi Feng appeared before the Blood Alliance members and brandished the Light of Two Worlds.

Tier 4 Legacy Skill, Formless Blade!

Sword’s Transmigration! Thirteen sword lights shot at the chests of Brut and the others, so fast that barely any of them managed to react to the attacks in time.

Of the Blood Alliance players, only Brut, who had broken through the 100% threshold of his Mana Body, managed to activate a Tier 4 Defensive Spell in time. Even so, the Tier 4 Barrier he summoned shattered after receiving Shi Feng’s attack.

As for the other Tier 4 players, none of them survived the attack. Even a Tier 4 Shield Warrior died on the spot.

The Tier 4 NPCs fared a little better than the players. Because of their significant advantage in levels and equipment, they all managed to activate a Tier 4 Defensive Skill or Spell in time and block the attacks directed at them. Even so, having used up one of their lifesaving measures, these NPCs wouldn’t be able to reuse these Skills and Spells within a short time.

However, Shi Feng had no intention of giving the Blood Alliance’s members any room to catch a breather. After completing his first attack, he promptly activated Blade Domain and executed Sword’s Transmigration once more.

Under Shi Feng’s control, the seven magic swords exhibited power at the Tier 5 standard. Brut and the Tier 4 NPCs were cornered and had no choice but to work together to cope with Shi Feng’s attacks. Despite not holding anything back, they were still forced to use their lifesaving measures one after another. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

For a time, explosions and spatial tears roiled the entrance of the Starlight Fortress. After these noises continued for around 30 seconds, Brut and the Blood Alliance’s Tier 4 NPCs all turned into ashes, becoming deader than dead.

“They died, just like that?”

“So, this is Black Flame’s strength?”

“Amazing! Isn’t he basically a Tier 5 now?!”

The spectators gaped in shock when they saw the Blood Alliance’s people annihilated, unable to get their minds around this situation for a long time.

After all, Brut was a Domain Realm expert. If he worked together with more than a dozen Tier 4 NPCs, they could probably raid even Tier 5 Legendary monsters. However, in front of Shi Feng, these powerful individuals were like children. Throughout the fight, they could only defend themselves; they didn’t have any leeway to retaliate or even heal themselves. Anyone who slipped up on their defense for even a moment got killed instantly.

At this time, let alone the spectating crowd, even Fithalia was flabbergasted by this situation.

She never thought that a person’s combat power could achieve such frightening heights after reaching the Half-step Tier 5 and World Creation standards. With such combat power, Shi Feng could probably go up against a true Tier 5 existence.

Meanwhile, after killing the Blood Alliance’s members, Shi Feng didn’t hesitate to pocket the items they dropped.

Simultaneously, he marveled at the excellence of the items they dropped. Just the Epic Weapons and Equipment he obtained numbered more than ten. Moreover, every one of them could be used up to Level 150.

After collecting his loot, Shi Feng went to Fithalia’s group and said gratefully, “Thank you for helping out with the Starlight Fortress’s troubles throughout this period. If not for you all maintaining the fortress, it would’ve most likely become a mess long ago.” From the Blood Alliance’s movements, he could tell that many powers on the western continent already had their sights set on the Starlight Fortress. The threat of the Divine Dragon was no longer sufficient to ensure the Starlight Fortress’s development. After all, so long as these powers isolated the Starlight Fortress and prevented other players from visiting it, they could easily stifle the fortress’s development.

“You exaggerate, Guild Leader Black Flame. However, you dealt a heavy blow to the Blood Alliance; the alliance is unlikely to take this lying down,” Fithalia said. She then added, “We have already conducted a thorough investigation into the Blood Alliance. It consists of more than ten superpowers and quite a number of powerful NPC forces. Some of these NPC forces even have Tier 5 NPCs leading them. This is why even the Outerworld invaders are just barely able to suppress the Blood Alliance and not defeat it outright.”

With Shi Feng’s strength, offending superpowers wouldn’t be a problem. However, it was a different story for NPC forces. Now that NPCs were no longer restricted by the system, so long as there were sufficient benefits to be had, they would be more than willing to take action against players.

If a Tier 5 NPC were to attack the Starlight Fortress, even if the fortress could remain standing, it would still be a nightmare for the fortress.

“Relax. Even if a Tier 5 does come, they can do nothing,” Shi Feng said, chuckling nonchalantly.

If it were before he had challenged the trial, he would indeed hesitate to clash with the Blood Alliance.

However, he now had the ability to contend against Tier 5 existences. Not to mention, the Starlight Fortress even had Auerbeck guarding it. The Silver Divine Dragon could suppress even ordinary Tier 5 existences of the same level.

“Do nothing?” Fithalia’s eyes widened in shock. She couldn’t help growing curious about the basis of Shi Feng’s confidence.

In the current era where Gods had secluded themselves, Tier 5 existences were considered the strongest combatants in God’s Domain. This was the same for the Outerworld. Every Tier 5 individual was a strategic existence that could singlehandedly ensure the safety of a region.

Hence, she found it inconceivable that Shi Feng already had the ability to go up against Tier 5 existences. Not to mention, these were Tier 5 NPCs they were talking about, not Tier 5 players.

“Commander Fithalia, may I trouble you to get me these materials?” Instead of explaining his confidence, Shi Feng took out a list and handed it to Fithalia. “I am willing to purchase them using Magic Crystals at double the market value.”

After taking a look at the materials on the list, Fithalia found that although these materials were rare and valuable, gathering them shouldn’t be a problem with Divine Tribe’s abilities.

“This shouldn’t be a problem, but why would you want to purchase these materials at such a high price? With Zero Wing’s abilities, you should be able to gather these materials yourself. There’s no need to pay double for them, much less pay in Magic Crystals,” Fithalia asked as she looked at Shi Feng strangely.

Aside from the Magic Elven Stone, the other materials on the list were relatively easy to obtain for a superpower. So long as Shi Feng returned to the eastern continent, he could gather these materials at any time through Zero Wing. There was no need to pay such an exorbitant price.

Not bothering to hide his motives, Shi Feng explained calmly, “I don’t have a choice. I urgently need these materials to connect the two continents. I won’t have enough if I rely on only the Starlight Fortress’s material stockpile, so I have to ask your Guild to acquire them for me.”

Now that he could summon the Divine Dragon to his aid at any time, he could do many things that he dared not do before. “Connect the two continents?” Fithalia momentarily doubted her ears when she heard Shi Feng’s words. “How is this possible?!”

The two main continents of God’s Domain were incredibly far apart from each other. This was why the various superpowers had desperately contended over intercontinental teleportation arrays. Even so, these teleportation arrays came with a lot of limitations. If Shi Feng really had a way to allow people to travel between the two continents freely, then that would be simply amazing!

However, Shi Feng just smiled in response to Fithalia’s doubt and did not explain himself further.

His past self would indeed be incapable of accomplishing such a feat. However, now that he was a Grandmaster Magician, combined with the Starlight Fortress’s Summoning Tower, such a feat wasn’t particularly difficult.
