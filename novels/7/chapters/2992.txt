Chapter 67 – Zero Wing’s Benefits

Miniature Ancient World, Hundred Flow City:

Roughly 30 to 50 thousand new players appeared in the city’s magnificent and ancient plaza every day. The huge influx of players quickly turned the city that used to be dominated by NPCs into a city dominated by players.

“So, this is the Miniature Ancient World?”

“The Mana here is so dense!”

“So this is why the various powers are desperately trying to get in on the action.”

Among the hundreds of players that had just appeared in the plaza, a few dozen players wearing beginner’s gear looked around with hopeful and curious looks on their faces. Unlike most of the players around them, these several dozen players looked to be in their thirties on average. Some of them even looked like they were 35 years old or older. These players could be regarded as older generation players in the current God’s Domain.

“Blackie, does the Guild Leader plan on developing in this place?”

“This isn’t a bad place. The player traffic here is comparable to royal capitals. It’ll be much easier for us to recruit players in the future.’

“But we came here a few days later than everyone else. We don’t even have any good equipment right now, either. I’m afraid we’ll have to work overtime if we want to catch up. Does the Guild Leader have any arrangements in mind, Blackie?”

The group of veteran players asked questions one after another as they looked at the slightly chubby man standing at the head of their group, their faces filled with expectations.

“Since Brother Feng asked us to come here, he should be planning on using this place as a base,” Blackie said, smiling when he saw everyone’s enthusiasm. “Although Brother Feng says that he has already established his Guild, I still don’t know what the exact situation surrounding it is. We should apply to join the Guild first and see what arrangements Brother Feng has for us.”

Everyone nodded and followed Blackie to the Adventurer’s Association. Then, they applied to join Zero Wing.

...

Meanwhile, Shi Feng, who was planning the Guild’s management system and point system in the Adventurer Association’s temporary Guild lounge, couldn’t help but smile when he saw Blackie entering the lounge. “Aren’t you moving a little too fast? I just finished setting the Guild regulations, yet you’ve brought everyone here already. Anyway, come and take a look at the regulations I’ve set.”

Creating a Guild wasn’t an easy task. It was especially important to get the Guild’s organizational structure and promotion system right during the Guild’s inception. If these matters weren’t handled properly, it would lead to big problems when more players joined the Guild in the future.

However, Shi Feng was already familiar with these matters, so it didn’t take much effort for him to write everything down.

After reading the regulations Shi Feng had set, Blackie couldn’t help but frown and said, “Guild Leader, I think your requirements for members are too high. You’re asking for combat standards at the Trial Tower’s fifth-floor late-stage just for outer members. That’s higher than even the ordinary expert standard right now. You can become at least an internal member in a third-rate Guild with such standards. You’re even asking for the sixth-floor middle-stage standard for official members and the seventh-floor early-stage standard for internal members…”

Blackie felt that Shi Feng was joking when he read the various rank requirements. It should be known that even veteran players like themselves were only at the seventh-floor early-stage standard. Meanwhile, they were already considered first-rate experts in God’s Domain. Otherwise, Su Qianliu wouldn’t have invited them to create a Guild together.

In the current God’s Domain, a first-rate expert could receive an elite member’s treatment at the very least in a first-rate Guild, while most would receive the treatment of core members. In a small Guild, a first-rate expert would be granted the position of Guild executive or vice commander of a legion.

Yet, in Zero Wing, first-rate experts were only qualified to become internal members…

“These requirements are indeed a little high for the current God’s Domain,” Shi Feng said, not surprised by Blackie’s evaluation. However, he didn’t continue elaborating on the matter. Instead, he smiled and asked, “How did your talk with Su Qianliu go?”

“She says she wants to meet and talk in detail first, but we need to go to Rock Devil City first. Also, she is currently in a meeting with the investors, so it’ll take another six or seven hours before she can meet us,” Blackie said, shaking his head. “Judging by her response, I think it’ll be tough to sway her thoughts. After all, she has over a billion in investments dangled in front of her…” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It’s fine so long as she has agreed to meet,” Shi Feng said with a faint smile. “Since we have another six hours to waste, go and gather everyone. Since everyone trusts me so much, I naturally can’t mistreat you all.”

“Guild Leader, don’t tell me you’re planning on digging up your life savings for us?” When Blackie heard Shi Feng’s words, he hurriedly said, “We might not have saved up a lot all these years, we can still make do with what we have! You don’t need to dig into your pockets!”

Seeing Blackie’s anxious look, Shi Feng laughed and said, “What are you talking about? Do you think I have that much money? Didn’t you think that I set the Guild’s standards too high just now? I’m planning to let you guys see whether the benefits our Guild offers are worth the high requirements.”

“Is that the case? I’ll call them over, then.” Blackie nodded and left the lounge.

A short time later, 63 players gathered in the lounge. Every one of these players used to be a first-rate expert in Shadow, and a few of them were even team leaders and vice team leaders in Shadow’s main force in the past. If it weren’t for their growing age and stagnating development, Lan Hailong wouldn’t have been so ruthless as to dismiss so many first-rate experts from the Guild at a time.

“What did you call us over for, Guild Leader?”

“Are we going out to grind?”

Everyone revealed excited expressions when they looked at Shi Feng. Ever since Shi Feng became Shadow’s Guild Leader, they never really got the opportunity to team up anymore. So, it had been a very, very long time since they last teamed up and grinded together.

“No, I only called you here to distribute the Guild’s internal member benefits to you,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “I believe all of you should be aware of the Miniature Ancient World’s uniqueness. Here, you get the opportunity to reconstruct your Mana Bodies. Our Guild might not have a lot of funds or resources right now, but our Guild has a Mana Legacy that can help you construct a better Mana Body!”

After saying so, Shi Feng took out the Memory Crystals he had prepared beforehand and distributed one to every person in the room.

“This is…a Mana Technique?!”

“Am I dreaming? Aren’t Mana Techniques supposed to be incredibly rare? Even first-rate Guilds hardly have any.”

When Blackie and the others saw the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique recorded in the Memory Crystals, they couldn’t help but doubt their eyes.

“Did you rob a God’s treasury, Guild Leader?” Blackie asked, his face filled with an indescribable sense of shock as he looked at Shi Feng.

It should be known that Mana Techniques were one of the best methods available for players to improve their control over Mana, and every copy of a Mana Technique was worth over 10,000 Gold. Yet, Shi Feng had brought out 63 copies…

However, Shi Feng simply chuckled and did not answer Blackie’s question. Instead, he said, “We don’t have a lot of time, so quickly learn it and head to the Colosseum to reconstruct your Mana Bodies. We still need to meet with Su Qianliu and give her a convincing reason.”

“Right! Time is limited!” Blackie also revealed an excited expression like the others after hearing Shi Feng’s words. “We’ll go right away!”
