Chapter 417 – Contention Between Swordsmen

The young female Swordsman was clad in an eight-piece Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set. By the looks of the set, it also seemed customized to fit the wearer. Aside from the Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set, there was a crystalline longsword with a blade as thin as a cicada’s wing hanging by the girl’s waist, the weapon emitting a glow unique to Legendary Weapons. Combined with her delicate figure and stunning appearance that overshadowed even Leroja, the girl instantly became the center of attention in the room as soon as she spoke.

Although the words that came out of the female Swordsman’s mouth were words of inquiry, her tone carried hints of arrogance that displeased Leroja a little. However, despite her displeasure, Leroja dared not say anything about it.

This was because the female Swordsman was not only extraordinary in strength but also in origins.

The little princess of the Platinum Realm’s Dragon Tongue Conglomerate, Cheng Xin!

The Platinum Realm was comparable to the Dragon Mountain Realm, and the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate was existence on par with the Galaxy Conglomerate. Hence, even in the Holy Realm, few people dared to offend Cheng Xin.

“Cheng Xin.” When Amber Soul heard the little princess’s rude tone, he said, “You are behaving rudely to Big Sis Leroja’s friend.”

Upon getting reprimanded by Amber Soul, Cheng Xin stuck out her tongue and said, “It’s just that I find him strange.”

Pausing, Cheng Xin took a moment to scrutinize Shi Feng’s inconspicuous appearance before continuing, “I’ve met many geniuses on the Luminous Glory List, but none look like him. I can’t feel any aura from him, and his movements show that he hasn’t reached the fifth-floor standard yet.

“Even his equipment is merely a damaged Fragmented Legendary-ranked Sacred Armor. Can you blame me for doubting him if he looks like this? No matter how I look at him, he doesn’t look like he can defeat Ghost Hand. The commission this time is of utmost importance. What if we fail because of his lack of strength?”

Upon hearing Cheng Xin’s evaluation, the many experts present also looked at Shi Feng with curiosity and confusion.

Everyone present had heard of the name of Black Flame. After all, that was a Luminous Glory expert they were talking about. Not to mention, it was rumored that Black Flame was responsible for killing the Dragon Mountain Realm’s Ghost Hand previously.

However, it was just as Cheng Xin said.

Even though they had met with quite a few Luminous Glory experts before, none looked as inconspicuous as Shi Feng. In addition, Shi Feng wasn’t even at the fifth-floor standard. So, they found it hard to imagine someone like Shi Feng could enter the Luminous Glory List and defeat a fifth-floor expert like Ghost Hand. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I can assure you that Guild Leader Black Flame has defeated Ghost Hand, Miss Cheng Xin. I was there at the time,” Leroja said with some apprehension.

Leroja wasn’t familiar with Cheng Xin. She was only acquaintances with Amber Soul. It was also thanks to her connection with Amber Soul that she and her party could be invited to this commission. However, the final decision on whether her party could actually join the commission still depended on Cheng Xin, who was related to the commission’s client.

“I trust Big Sis Leroja’s words, Cheng Xin,” Amber Soul said. “Brother Black Flame is a Luminous Glory expert who has gained the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s acknowledgment. He is definitely qualified for the commission.”

“Even if everything about him is true, he is only ranked 963rd on the Luminous Glory List. He is a far cry compared to you, Big Brother Amber,” Cheng Xin said as she looked at Amber Soul in worship. “But out of respect for you, I will talk to the client about him, Big Brother Amber.”

“Don’t get angry, Brother Black Flame,” Desolate Fury quietly whispered to Shi Feng. “That girl is the young lady of the Platinum Realm’s Dragon Tongue Conglomerate. We’ll most likely have to suffer if we upset her…”

Shi Feng didn’t say anything regarding Cheng Xin’s comments. He was also aware of Cheng Xin’s identity as she was considerably famous in the Greater God’s Domain.

In addition to being the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s little princess, Cheng Xin was also a peerless paragon, having become a three-star mental strength grandmaster at a young age. During Shi Feng’s previous life, Cheng Xin had even killed a Tier 6 God as a Tier 6 player.

Although the current Cheng Xin was at Tier 4, she was already a fifth-floor expert. More importantly, she ranked 326th on the Luminous Glory List. In front of her, a fifth-floor expert like Ghost Hand wouldn’t last more than a few moves. So, Shi Feng found it understandable that Cheng Xin would look down on someone ranked in the 900s. It didn’t help that Amber Soul, someone ranked in the Luminous Glory List’s top 300, was present to serve as a comparison.

…

Shortly after Shi Feng arrived, a group of three people entered the underground ruin.

Of these three people, one was an elegant, middle-aged man, one was a burly young man, and one was an old man carrying a bow and arrows. As soon as these three people appeared, everyone felt a strong pressure bearing down on them.

“You stubborn little girl… I already told you not to come, so why wouldn’t you listen?” the elegant, middle-aged man asked as he glared at Cheng Xin. “The operation this time is of utmost importance. This isn’t a place where you youngsters should come to play!”

Disgruntled by the middle-aged man’s words, Cheng Xin said, “Who said I came here to play? I brought Big Brother Amber with me. We won’t have any trouble stopping the Dragon Mountain Realm’s younger generation.”

Cheng Xin dared not behave arrogantly in front of the elegant, middle-aged man. This was because the other party was Flint, an expert who used to rank among the Luminous Glory List’s top 100 roughly three decades ago. At the same time, he was also one of the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s directors.

As for the burly young man and bow-carrying old man, they were Elders of the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate. Both used to rank among the Luminous Glory List’s top 500 during their younger days. With their current strength, they could easily beat up youngsters like her.

“Suit yourself, but be sure to run if you can’t beat them!” Flint said as he looked at Cheng Xin helplessly.

“I know.” Cheng Xin smiled and nodded.

Afterward, Flint walked up to the elevated platform in the underground ruin and swept his gaze across everyone in the room. Then, he said, “I am Flint, the client of the commission. All of you here are our camp’s top-ranking experts. I don’t need you all to do much; you just need to stop the mercenaries hired by the Dragon Mountain Realm’s Heavenly God Corporation. Those mercenaries won’t number more than 50. You can keep the loot of your kills, but I need you to stall them for ten minutes. So long as you can do that, everyone will receive 100 God Crystal Fragments. There will also be a bonus for those who have made significant contributions.

“However, I also have to clarify that should you fail to stall them for ten minutes, you won’t receive any payment!”

Nobody present said anything about Flint’s warning. This was usually how sketchy private commissions worked. Although such commissions didn’t have any minimum payout, the returns for success were extremely high. The payout for one such commission could make up for several days’ worth of normal commissions.

After Flint made sure that nobody present had a problem, he used an Advanced Teleportation Crystal to teleport everyone to the middle of a ruined city. Then, he activated a Tier 5 Isolation Scroll to put everyone under Stealth. After doing all of that, he had everyone hide in the surrounding buildings as they waited for their target to arrive.

Roughly twenty minutes later, a caravan guarded by a 50-man team slowly made its way down the street flanked by Flint’s team.

“Target has appeared! Get ready!”
