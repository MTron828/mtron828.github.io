Chapter 230 - Crazy Night

The night bazaar of White River City had been organized to allow players to conduct business with each other.

Due to Dark Star’s incessant advertising, the bazaar today had grown lively. Many Guilds had collected a large amount of Hard Stones and Coins to purchase the Advanced Whetstones from Dark Star.

Players busied themselves with setting up stalls throughout the plaza where the bazaar would occur.

As one had to pay a steep processing fee to use the services of the Auction House, many players had opted to sell their accumulated loot today instead.

Meanwhile, of the many stalls set up at this plaza, the most attention-grabbing one belonged to Dark Star, as there were several hundred players currently lined up before Dark Star’s stall. Seeing this, Lone Tyrant’s heart fluttered with joy. By the time tomorrow arrived, Dark Star would become the wealthiest Guild in White River City, and very soon, they would even surpass the Starstreak Trading Firm. They would become the possessor of White River City’s economic lifeline.

At that time, even Ouroboros would not be a match for Dark Star!

Half an hour after the bazaar started, something odd happened.

This incident caused plenty of Guilds to grow sluggish in their thoughts, and even Lone Tyrant was utterly dumbfounded.

“Can someone tell me just what has happened here?!” Lone Tyrant bellowed, pointing towards the empty plaza.

“Boss, I made some inquiries just now and found out that the Starstreak Trading Firm has similarly reduced the prices of their items. Aside from having the same prices as we do, they have also released a new product. I hear that the product is a Basic Mana Armor Kit made by Black Flame. As long as one binds this Armor Kit to their equipment, they will receive a great improvement to their Attributes and Defense. If a player binds three pieces to their equipment, then it would be the equivalent of having an additional top-tier Mysterious-Iron ranked breastplate.”

“However, Starstreak has limited the sales of the Armor Kit to 50 each day. So, everyone went to queue up for the item instead.”

“Black Flame? Isn’t that the Chief Forger of Star-Moon Kingdom? Why would he work with the Starstreak Trading Firm?” Lone Tyrant’s brows wrinkled. He had also heard rumors about Black Flame. However, the man was simply too mysterious, so nobody had a concrete idea which major power stood behind him. The public only knew that there was a deeply hidden major power supporting Black Flame.

“So what if he is the Chief Forger?” Lone Tyrant sneered, “Since Black Flame can create such a good item, we only need to make it as well. Immediately investigate the Basic Mana Armor Kit; find out where we can get the Forging Design. I truly wish to thank Black Flame for giving us this great business opportunity.”

“Boss is the best! I’ll investigate it immediately!”

Meanwhile, at the Starstreak Trading Firm, there was already a sea of people lining up outside the building.

“Selling one stack of Hard Stones for a low price! Come over here if you are interested!”

“Level 10 Bronze Axe for 30 Silver Coins!”

“Buying Silver Coins for a high price! I’ll take as much as you have!”

Unknowingly, a market had formed outside of the Starstreak Trading Firm. Although players could not set up stalls there, they could still do face-to-face trading. Albeit troublesome, nobody would mind such a small matter. After all, they were currently trying to make as much money as they could. By the time the Starstreak Trading Firm started selling the Basic Mana Armor Kits again, they would buy as many as possible.

While everyone stood in line outside the building, many had struck up conversations with one another. They started to boast about the effects of the Basic Mana Armor Kit.

What the Three-headed Wolves party had accomplished had especially become the envy of many independent parties.

Meanwhile, the more this news spread, the more it was blown out of proportion. Currently, the rumors mentioned that the Three-headed Wolves had originally not been able to clear even a Normal Mode Party Dungeon. However, after their MT and healer had each bound three Basic Mana Armor Kits to their equipment, the party immediately succeeded in raiding a Level 10 Hell Mode Party Dungeon. They had even obtained a Secret-Silver ranked shield and many other Mysterious-Iron Set Equipment pieces from the raid, increasing their team’s prowess to that of a party of experts. Some said that the Three-headed Wolves were currently stronger than even the elite members of a first-rate Guild.

This rumor had caused many independent players to long for the Basic Mana Armor Kits. They wished to obtain the Armor Kits and achieve great success.

Aside from independent players focusing on the Basic Mana Armor Kit, the various Guilds had also started taking action. They tried to think of ways to contact Black Flame. They wanted to purchase a large number of the Armor Kits from him directly. After all, if they could equip every member of their elite team with three Basic Mana Armor Kits, their team’s strength would rise to an entirely different level. At that time, conquering the 20-man Hell Mode Team Dungeon would no longer be a dream.

Taking a step back, even if they could not clear the Hell Mode, if they could manage to clear the Hard Mode, they could still reap a lot of benefits. Hence, it was a must for them to obtain the Basic Mana Armor Kits.

Di... Di... Di...

“Snow, is Big Brother Black Flame offline?” Zhao Yueru asked, worried.

Gentle Snow nodded her head, saying bitterly, “I have truly underestimated Black Flame. Originally, I thought that he would suffer a small setback after Dark Star revealed the Advanced Whetstones and Intermediate Potions. However, I would never have imagined that he would reveal such a card, catching everyone by surprise.”

Gentle Snow had believed that she had a good understanding of the man called Black Flame. However, time and again, Black Flame continued to surpass her expectations.

It was as if Black Flame had brought out two cards, one white and one black, forcing others to guess which card he would reveal. In the end, however, he had done the unpredictable by taking out a gray card, catching everyone by surprise.

Night in God’s Domain was day in reality. At this moment, Shi Feng had already logged off from the game and started training his body. Hence, he had absolutely no idea about the current goings-on in White River City.

Ever since Shi Feng had moved to his new apartment, the first thing he did after waking up every morning was drink a bottle of Nutrient Fluids. He would then complete 20 sets of muscle strengthening exercises and a 10-kilometer morning run.

“The Nutrient Fluid is as extraordinary as expected. My current physique should be on the level of a normal member of the school’s fighting society.” After ending his morning run, Shi Feng made a rough estimate of his body’s current condition. However, if he wanted a more accurate estimate, he would need to test his abilities in an appropriate training room.

After training and strengthening his body these past few days, Shi Feng was no longer as frail and thin as he used to be. Currently, Shi Feng’s body had grown much sturdier, giving others a faint feeling that it was packed with vitality.

As usual, after completing his daily workout routine, Shi Feng paid a visit to the Workshop to check on its current renovation progress.

A Gaming Workshop occupied an entire office floor of such size. In the past, such a notion was simply inconceivable. However, along with God’s Domain’s growing influence, it wouldn’t be odd even if a Gaming Workshop took up an entire office building, not to mention a single floor. In the past, Shadow was one such example. However, the Shadow of that time possessed a lot of members. It had even established ten great city-states under its name. It was only normal to have such a large Workshop. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Brother Feng, you’re here! The Workshop’s renovation is complete. We are just waiting for the gaming facilities we ordered to arrive, and we’ll set them up. After we finish that, our Zero Wing Workshop will finally take shape!” Blackie excitedly said, “At that time, those who we recruit to our Guild might just join without hesitation after seeing our Workshop!”

A few days ago, Shi Feng had suddenly paid a visit to Blackie’s dormitory. He notified Blackie that he had already purchased a Workshop in the city center. In the future, Blackie would not need to live in the dormitory, disturbed by others.

Blackie could simply live in the Workshop and focus on playing God’s Domain. Moreover, there was a high-class restaurant situated a floor below the Workshop. The well-known Big Dipper Training Center was also located on the street next to their building. Compared to living in the university’s dormitory, it would be far more comfortable for Blackie to live in the Workshop.

In the beginning, Blackie had thought that the Workshop Shi Feng had mentioned would only be a house of 50 to 60 square meters. Even so, that would still be a relatively comfortable place to live.

However, when Blackie arrived at the building floor and discovered that the entire floor was meant for their Workshop, Blackie had nearly thrown out his back in shock. Shortly after, that shock had turned into immense joy. After all, this large Workshop of theirs was far more amazing than Shadow’s. With such an amazing Workshop, would they even need to worry that they couldn’t surpass Shadow in the future?

“Oh, right. Blackie, how are things on your side? How much longer do you guys need before getting out of there?” Shi Feng asked.
