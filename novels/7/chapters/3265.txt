Chapter 340 – One Sword to Silence Them All!

“Does Black Flame really think he can stop a Silver Combat Puppet all by himself?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“He’s probably trying to buy time. After all, there are so many people targeting his party right now. It’s only natural he would try to secure as much of the loot as possible.”

“I would do the same in his shoes. The opportunity to join the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition might be great, but getting into the competition and actually winning an invitation are two entirely different stories. Rather than gamble for the small chance of winning an invitation, it’d be much better to just secure a few of the items dropped by the Mutated Heroic Spirit. A Tier 4 Mutated Heroic Spirit’s loot is better than even that of Tier 5 Legendary World Bosses. If he’s lucky, he might even get a few Fragmented Legendary items!”

…

!!

When everyone saw Shi Feng trying to stop the Silver Combat Puppet by himself, they shook their heads at the futility of his struggle. At the same time, though, they couldn’t help but look at him enviously.

The Silver Combat Puppet possessed Strength superior to even Tier 5 Berserkers. No matter how powerful Shi Feng was, he was still only a Tier 4 player. If he tried to clash with the Silver Combat Puppet head-on, he would definitely be sent flying and open to attacks.

However, Shi Feng didn’t really have a choice. The Silver Combat Puppet’s target was Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao. If Shi Feng didn’t intercept the Silver Combat Puppet, the two girls would be instantly killed should they let it reach them. This, in turn, meant that Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao wouldn’t be available to stop the next wave of Tier 5 Spells.

As for Glorious Mantra, because he had the Silver Combat Puppet’s protection, he wasn’t worried about the bombardment of Tier 5 Spells at all. At worst, his Silver Combat Puppet would lose some of its durability.

So, for the sake of acquiring more loot, Shi Feng had no choice but to take the initiative to stop the Silver Combat Puppet. Otherwise, he’d be killed for nothing.

Of course, if Shi Feng’s action allowed Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao to grab a few Fragmented Legendary items, any sacrifices he made here would be worthwhile.

It should be known that Fragmented Legendary items were precious to the various powers. Even hegemonic powers could only afford to give their peerless geniuses two or three Fragmented Legendary items when they were at Tier 4.

Meanwhile, the more Fragmented Legendary items a Tier 4 player possessed, the more easily the player could get promoted to Tier 5. The Tier 5 promotion required players to collect all sorts of Legacy Guidances. Apart from the peerless geniuses of upper-ranking hegemonic powers and apex powers, the peerless geniuses and paragons of all other powers had to search for their Legacy Guidances on their own if they wanted to get promoted to Tier 5.

Because of this, individual strength was very important for Tier 4 players. Meanwhile, the strength of a Tier 4 player was largely dependent on their weapons and equipment. At Tier 4 and Tier 5, even the difference of one Fragmented Legendary item could result in a significant difference in Basic Attributes.

While everyone was discussing Shi Feng’s actions and decisions, the Silver Combat Puppet suddenly swung several dozen punches at Shi Feng.

The Silver Combat Puppet was ten meters tall, and its fists were the size of houses. Adding on its Strength that was at the Tier 5 Peak standard, the Silver Combat Puppet quickly transformed the space around it into a dark void with its several dozen punches. The power of its flurry of punches was vastly stronger than an attack from a Tier 5 Magic Scroll.

“Do you think you’re invincible just because you defeated Markless Blade?” Glorious Mantra sneered as he watched the Silver Combat Puppet’s fists rapidly overlapping with Shi Feng’s figure.

In terms of combat standards and Basic Attributes, Glorious Mantra admitted that he was inferior to Markless Blade. However, the outcome of fights between players out in the fields wasn’t decided based solely on these two factors. The various tools players wielded also played an important role.

Combat Puppets were strategic weapons designed for war. In the case of Silver Combat Puppets, they were slaughter machines often used by the various hegemonic powers when they waged war against each other. A Silver Combat Puppet could even go up against a group of Tier 5 players, let alone one Tier 4 player.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

When the Silver Combat Puppet’s large fists fell on Shi Feng’s body, the sound of metal ringing appeared in a series and echoed throughout the entire mountaintop. Sparks also flew everywhere, brightening the dim sky a little.

“This… Impossible…”

Glorious Mantra gaped in shock when he saw Shi Feng blocking the Silver Combat Puppet’s attacks and coming out unscathed.

He had used a combination of the Silver Combat Puppet’s Strength and his Storm Strike, a Silver Combat Technique, to attack Shi Feng. Not only did this combination allow him to exhibit power at the Tier 5 Apex standard with every punch, but it also enabled him to attack at the rate of a Tier 5 player. Even a paragon like Markless Blade would be instantly killed by such an attack.

Yet, Shi Feng had resisted the attacks without taking any damage…

However, before Glorious Mantra could recover from his shock, the surrounding parties had already used their Tier 5 Magic Scrolls and Tier 5 Consumables.

Immediately, more than twenty Tier 5 Spells flew at Shi Feng’s party, the combined might of the attacks vastly greater than the first round of attacks. Even the Storm Strike executed by the Silver Combat Puppet paled in comparison.

When Shi Feng saw the oncoming Tier 5 Spells, he began brandishing the golden longsword he wielded at the attacks.

Immediately, over twenty dazzling sword lights cut through the Tier 5 Spells one after another, causing them to disintegrate. Even the magic arrays maintaining these Spells had crumbled and disappeared.

“Everything’s gone?”

“How is this possible? How did he break apart over 20 Tier 5 Spells in an instant? Does his sword have some kind of Mana Destabilization effect?”

“No, not even a Mana Destabilization effect can destabilize Tier 5 Spells completely. It can, at most, destabilize Tier 4 Spells and weaken Tier 5 Spells.”

Everyone present was shocked when they saw the Tier 5 Spells disintegrating.

It wasn’t uncommon to see Tier 4 Spells getting destabilized, especially among players of their caliber. However, none of them had ever seen Tier 5 Spells getting destabilized before.

It should be known that the difference between Tier 4 and Tier 5 Spells wasn’t limited to just their power output. The mana composition and density of Tier 5 Spells were also on a completely different level.

The so-called Mana Destabilization effect was achieved by using stronger and denser mana to clash with mana of lower strength and density, causing the latter to destabilize and disintegrate.

However, Tier 5 Spells were made up of near-solid mana. Because of this, it was nigh impossible to destabilize a Tier 5 Spell completely. It couldn’t be achieved even with mana that had thoroughly achieved a solid state. At most, Mana Destabilization could destabilize a portion of a Tier 5 Spell’s mana, thereby weakening it.

Yet, the Tier 5 Spells before them had disappeared…

“Since you people have had your turn, it’s my turn now!” Seeing the confused looks on everyone’s faces, Shi Feng swung his Replica Eternal Ashes and merged it with the world around him.

Holy Law!

Immediately, stone swords shot out from the ground in a 200-yard radius one after another, every sword carrying power rivaling the punches of the Silver Combat Puppet. Not even Tier 5 players could afford to defend against these stone swords without adequate countermeasures.

In the blink of an eye, over half of the 50-plus experts on the battlefield were killed. Some of these experts didn’t even manage to react to the sudden attack before they got killed. As for the stronger experts, they only managed to block one or two stone swords before they got pierced by other stone swords and killed on the spot.

“…”

Whether it was experts still alive on the battlefield or the players spectating from the outside world, they all fell silent at this moment.

It should be known that every player on the battlefield was an extraordinary expert. Every one of them was either a peerless genius or a paragon who had gotten through the Rookie Competition’s preliminaries, and even the weakest among them was a fourth-floor expert. Moreover, they also had many lifesaving measures, and even Tier 5 experts would have difficulty killing them.

Yet, now, Shi Feng had killed nearly 30 of such experts in one move…
