Chapter 380 – Demigod

TL Notes:

Made a change to Chapter 380:

Original:

!!

Meanwhile, as soon as these Flying Mounts crossed the 10,000-yard mark, each Flying Mount came face to face with over a thousand Void Sea Serpents and several dozen Void Sea Dragons. Trecht and the other paragons could feel their scalps tingling when they saw how many enemies they had to go up against. It was especially so when they saw how many Void Sea Dragons stood in their way.

Changed to:

Meanwhile, as soon as these Flying Mounts crossed the 10,000-yard mark, a significantly greater number of monsters moved to hinder their advance. Among them, the Mutated Frostflame Phantom Dragon had to deal with over a thousand Void Sea Serpents and several dozen Void Sea Dragons simultaneously. Trecht and the other paragons felt their scalps tingling when they saw this scene. It was especially so when they saw the grouping of Void Sea Dragons.

“Impossible!”

“Who is she?!”

…

Whether it was Trecht and the other Tier 4 paragons or the Four Beast Warriors, they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded when they saw the several dozen Void Sea Dragons blocking Zero Wing’s team falling into the void sea. They were so shocked by this scene that they had nearly forgotten to defend themselves against the Void Sea Dragons they faced.

Meanwhile, standing atop the Frostflame Dragon’s back, Midsummer couldn’t help but turn to look at Shi Feng and ask, “Who is this person, Guild Leader?”

Even Trecht, an existence on par with Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac, had great difficulty going up against three Void Sea Dragons by himself. If he tried to take on several dozen Void Sea Dragons by himself, he would instantly be reduced to ashes. After all, all of the Void Sea Dragons could attack from range. If several dozen of them attacked, there’d be no room for him to make evasive maneuvers.

Yet, the woman named Laura Crader had heavily damaged several dozen Void Sea Dragons in one move. Her strength was utterly horrifying.

“Xiaoxiao, has Zero Wing always had such an expert?” Jun Luosha asked, the corner of her eyes twitching as she looked at Wu Xiaoxiao. The degree of shock she experienced from seeing what just happened was beyond the shock she experienced from learning about Shi Feng’s ownership of a Legendary Flying Mount.

At this time, Jun Luosha could only think of one word to describe the woman known as Laura Crader.

Invincible!

True invincibility!

Dira’s four bodyguards had to work together just to hold back a dozen or so Void Sea Dragons from attacking Dira. Moreover, that was under the condition that all four of them had reached Tier 5.

It should be known that the Four Beast Warriors were not some random nobodies. They were paragons nurtured by the Paimon Conglomerate for many years. During their early years, their names were known throughout the Starlight Realm, and the fame they enjoyed back then went far beyond what paragons like Trecht currently enjoyed.

But now, comparing the Four Beast Warriors to Laura Crader felt like comparing the glow of four fireflies with the glow of a full moon.

With an expert like Laura Crader defending Zero Wing, the Guild’s position in the Miniature Ancient World would be unshakable.

Did Zero Wing have such an expert?

Wu Xiaoxiao did not have an answer to Jun Luosha’s question. This was because she was equally shocked and confused by this situation. She never knew Zero Wing had an expert of Laura’s caliber under its command.

The reason behind Wu Xiaoxiao’s confidence in inviting Jun Luosha to join Zero Wing was because of Shi Feng and the Hundred Refinement Building in Gazing Moon City. Meanwhile, like Jun Luosha, this was the first time Wu Xiaoxiao was meeting with the person known as Laura Crader.

While everyone was immersed in shock and confusion, Shi Feng steered the Frostflame Dragon to the floating island. In only a few seconds, the Frostflame Dragon overtook Dira’s party of five. Meanwhile, every Void Sea Dragon that tried to hinder the Frostflame Dragon’s advance was struck down without fail by Laura’s sword.

“Dammit!” Dira cursed when he saw that Zero Wing’s team had moved within 1,000 yards of the floating island. Then, he turned to Platinum Behemoth and asked, “Platinum, what is that person’s standard?”

“Tier 6!” Platinum Behemoth said, a hint of fear surfacing in his eyes as he looked at the distant Laura Crader. “Her strike just now has already reached the entry level of the Tier 6 standard!”

“The entry-level of Tier 6?” Surprised, Dira exclaimed, “Doesn’t that mean she’s already on par with White Owl?”

“Most likely.” Platinum Behemoth nodded. “If we have to compete against her for the Legacy, we have zero chances of winning…”

White Owl was one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s current Ten Core Paragons. Not only did she receive a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set from the conglomerate, but she was even assigned a Legendary Weapon of high compatibility. Recently, she had even successfully constructed a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body, becoming a candidate for the conglomerate’s Three Overlords position in the future.

At the same time, White Owl was also responsible for commanding the Tier 4 army that would be invading the Miniature Ancient World to deal with Zero Wing. Moreover, because of a favor she owed to the Divine Seal Saint several years ago, she had agreed to complete her promotion to Tier 5 as soon as she entered the World Passage.

“Dammit! Contact White Owl and have her hurry over here!” Dira said in dissatisfaction. “It’s all that damned Zero Wing’s fault! Once White Owl’s group arrives, I’ll make sure Zero Wing suffers!”

The appearance of the Void Gods’ settlement in the Miniature Ancient World’s World Passage was a huge surprise even for him. Originally, he had thought of monopolizing the Void Saint Legacy, but that evidently wouldn’t be possible now.

…

When Platinum Behemoth had gone offline to contact White Owl, Zero Wing’s team also arrived on the Void Gods’ floating island.

When Hidden Soul, who had only gotten promoted to Tier 4 recently, felt the Eternal Energy present on the island, she couldn’t help but exclaim, “What an incredible place this is! Not only does it have such dense mana, but it even has Eternal Energy diffused across the air! This place will be wonderful for training!”

Gentle Snow, who had similarly reached Tier 4, excitedly nodded in agreement.

Setting aside the solidified mana environment, just the Eternal Energy diffused in the air was enough to make it the dream training ground of countless players. Players seeking to train their Skills, Spells, and combat techniques could achieve incredible results here. Even players looking to create their Tier 5 Mana Body could receive great help from the environment here.

“This isn’t a place for training,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head as he looked at the numerous void chains that covered the island.

“Not for training?” Looking at Shi Feng in confusion, Midsummer asked, “Wasn’t it mentioned that the Void Saint Legacy could be found here?”

“The Void Saint Legacy indeed exists here,” Shi Feng said. Then, he turned to look at a nearby town and explained, “But this island itself is a Space-Time Prison built specifically to imprison the Greater God’s Domain’s Demigods.”

Void Gods constantly wandered the void, so most people knew very little about them. However, Shi Feng happened to come across a piece of important information related to the Void Gods during his previous life. This information was also one of the Greater God’s Domain’s great secrets.

“Imprison Demigods? Do Demigods need to be imprisoned?”

Existence capable of being regarded as a Demigod in God’s Domain were NPCs who were only one step away from reaching Tier 6. However, there were plenty of such Demigod-rank NPCs in the Greater God’s Domain. There was also very little these Demigod NPCs could accomplish in the Greater God’s Domain, since even a country like the Ancient River Kingdom had Tier 6 NPCs guarding it.

“It is naturally unnecessary to imprison ordinary Demigods,” Shi Feng said before pausing for a short moment. Then, he continued, “But what if it’s a Demigod who has destroyed a kingdom or an empire in the Greater God’s Domain?”

“What? A Demigod who has destroyed a country in the Greater God’s Domain? How is that even possible?” Wu Xiaoxiao did not believe Shi Feng’s words for even a second.

No matter how powerful a Demigod was, they would still be nothing more than Tier 5 NPCs. Meanwhile, the Greater God’s Domain was a place where many Tier 6 NPCs existed. There was no way a Demigod could destroy an entire kingdom in the Greater God’s Domain, much less an empire.

However, in response to Wu Xiaoxiao’s doubt, Shi Feng simply chuckled and did not bother offering additional explanations.

In God’s Domain, there were significant differences even between Demigods. In fact, the difference could be even bigger than the gap between Tier 5 and Tier 6. If memory serves him correctly, it wouldn’t be long before a piece of major news would shake the entire Greater God’s Domain—the destruction of a Realm caused by a Demigod!

…

While Shi Feng and the others were making their way closer to the nearby village, a powerful voice suddenly echoed in everyone’s minds, the voice instilling fear into everyone’s souls.

“Humans! This is not a place for you to approach!”
