Chapter 199 – Foundation Exposed

“You really do not mince your words, Mr. Shi Feng,” Aqua Rose said, blinking in surprise when she heard Shi Feng’s direct response to her offer. She also couldn’t help but carefully examine the unassuming man before her. “I’ll be blunt and say it directly, then. In exchange for our help in resisting the Flower of Seven Sins...

“We want your physical training method! Specifically, the aerobics that you’ve taught to your students. Of course, what we want is the complete version!”

When Aqua Rose finished speaking, Unyielding Ice, who had remained silent this entire time, also turned to look at Shi Feng with a passionate flame in her eyes.

Every superpower in God’s Domain had its own physical training method that it used to teach its members how to manipulate their bodies’ subtle movements, allowing them to become an expert in God’s Domain. The problem was that these training methods needed to be supplemented with S-rank Nutrient Fluids if a player wanted to become a Refinement Realm expert as quickly as possible.

However, according to the information Twilight Echo obtained, Zero Wing, or more specifically, Shi Feng, possessed a special training method that could allow one to quickly become a Refinement Realm expert, even without using S-rank Nutrient Fluids.

It should be known that the supply of S-rank Nutrient Fluids was incredibly limited. Even corporations partnered with the Green God Company could only purchase a very small amount each year. This limited supply also became a limiting factor for the various superpowers’ growth.

If a superpower could train players into Refinement Realm experts quickly without using S-rank Nutrient Fluids, this superpower would achieve significant improvements.

“So it still got out in the end?” Shi Feng sighed when he heard Aqua Rose’s words. “It seems Wu Lingling’s performance has caught your notice.”

Shi Feng wasn’t particularly surprised by the condition Aqua Rose proposed. After all, the only thing Zero Wing had that could attract the attention of a superpower like Twilight Echo was his aerobic exercise.

“Yes. Your student’s performance in the Secret Pavilion’s competition was very eye-catching. Had Wu Lingling participated in any of the past competitions, nobody would have made a big deal out of her victory. However, it just so happened that the opponent she beat this time was Leili, an incredibly rare genius even by the Secret Pavilion’s standards,” Aqua Rose said, nodding. “I’ve met Leili before, and I can say for certain that the girl is in no way inferior to Ziqiong. The Secret Pavilion has also been vigorously training Leili, so the resources she has access to are beyond what most people her age have access to.

“Yet, such a talented and well-nurtured genius like Leili lost to someone who didn’t even come from an Advanced Academy. Can you imagine our shock when we received this news?”

Leili’s name was well known among the various superpowers of God’s Domain. After all, Purple Jade was already cultivating Leili as her successor. If nothing unexpected occurred, Leili should have no trouble ranking among the top 20 of God’s Domain’s newest generation of geniuses.

In the opinions of the various superpowers’ executives, only the peerless geniuses nurtured by other superpowers could possibly match or beat a peerless genius like Leili.

Hence, the actual outcome of the Secret Pavilion’s competition was very unexpected.

In the current era where God’s Domain’s influence had already spread across the globe, it wasn’t difficult to discover geniuses from an early age, let alone peerless geniuses. The various superpowers of God’s Domain investigate everyone who registered for a God’s Domain Academy’s entrance test and immediately determine whether any of these applicants were geniuses worthy of their investment. Jin Hai University’s God’s Domain was no exception.

However, the strange thing was that there was no news about the student named Wu Lingling.

According to the basic threshold set by the various superpowers, they would conduct further investigation on any students who had managed to reach the late stage of the Trial Tower’s fifth floor during their entrance test. Although the fifth floor’s late-stage was only the standard of ordinary experts in God’s Domain, it wasn’t an easy goal for 16- and 17-year-old students to reach without experiencing any systematic guidance. Hence, a student would be considered talented in the various superpowers’ eyes if they reached this standard during the entrance test.

Yet, Wu Lingling had not entered the scope of investigation of any superpowers. This included Twilight Echo. When Aqua Rose and Unyielding Ice first learned of this situation, they had initially suspected that the recruitment personnel had been slacking on their duties and that they had never bothered investigating Jin Hai Academy’s entrance test.

However, when they had their trusted aides investigate the matter, it was discovered that Twilight Echo did have a record of Wu Lingling’s entrance test. Only, they couldn’t help but doubt her eyes when they saw Wu Lingling’s test results.

Wu Lingling had only reached the Trial Tower’s fifth-floor middle-stage standard!

Non-superpowers might regard teenagers with this combat standard as geniuses, but the various superpowers would only treat such teenagers as mediocre individuals who had no talent.

Yet, such a mediocre student had defeated Leili, the Secret Pavilion’s peerless genius. This was simply unbelievable.

When they learned about Wu Lingling’s circumstances, two possibilities came to their minds. Either Wu Lingling had hidden her strength in the entrance test, or she came across a fortuitous opportunity sometime after the entrance test.

Eventually, after learning more about Wu Lingling through the Secret Pavilion, they stumbled upon a shocking discovery. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Based on their findings, there was a 90% chance that the reason a mediocre talent like Wu Lingling had managed to defeat Leili was because of the physical training method she had learned from Shi Feng. Meanwhile, thanks to this training method, Wu Lingling had managed to achieve lightning growth in her combat standards.

To validate their conjecture, they had also investigated the other students that had participated in Shi Feng’s training. Meanwhile, what they found matched their expectations.

Shi Feng was indeed in possession of an incredibly effective training method. With the help of this training method, even people of mediocre talent could achieve rapid growth in a short period of time.

If they could apply this training method to their Guild, they were certain that Twilight Echo would achieve a massive leap in strength within a short time.

Initially, Aqua Rose and Unyielding Ice had found it strange that Shi Feng had managed to get his hands on such a technique. After all, he was only the former Guild Leader of a second-rate Guild.

However, after they watched the replay of the one-sided clash between Zero Wing and World Dominators, they quickly understood how Shi Feng had managed to get his hands on such an amazing training method.

Outerworlders!

Zero Wing’s Guild Leader Black Flame was already deemed to be someone from another God’s Domain. In that case, everything made sense.

Only an Outerworlder could possibly possess such an amazing training method. After all, even the Five Great Super Guilds did not have such a physical training method.

Meanwhile, as Zero Wing’s founder on paper, it was only natural that Shi Feng had deep ties with the Outerworlder known as Black Flame. Otherwise, he would have never been allowed to become Zero Wing’s founder.

“So, can I take this as a joint offer from Twilight Echo and the Secret Pavilion?” Shi Feng asked.

Twilight Echo was certainly a superpower in God’s Domain. However, it wasn’t that much stronger than Witch’s Sin, and Witch’s Sin didn’t even dare to go against the Flower of Seven Sins. So, he had difficulty understanding why Twilight Echo dared to go against the Flower of Seven Sins.

The only explanation Shi Feng could think of was Twilight Echo had partnered with the Secret Pavilion.

After all, the Secret Pavilion was also transcendental power like the Flower of Seven Sins in God’s Domain. It was one of the few powers capable of going against the Flower of Seven Sins.

“You’ve guessed it, Mr. Shi Feng,” Aqua Rose said with a smile. She did not bother hiding this information from Shi Feng. “We have indeed partnered with the Secret Pavilion for this deal. However, the Secret Pavilion has always maintained a neutral position and never participated in the struggles between the various powers of God’s Domain. So, Twilight Echo will be responsible for overseeing this deal on the surface, while the Secret Pavilion will be assisting in secret. I’m sure you can now understand why it wouldn’t be difficult for us to fight against the Flower of Seven Sins, right?

“The Flower of Seven Sins is like a pack of frenzied dogs. They’re incredibly hard to deal with. However, if you are willing to sell us your training method, we will not only guarantee Zero Wing’s safety, but we will also help Zero Wing construct a fully-equipped headquarters in Jin Hai City. On top of that, we will also supply 300 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid for Zero Wing’s future development.”

“The assistance against the Flower of Seven Sins is unnecessary. Zero Wing can resolve this matter by itself,” Shi Feng said, his tone as calm as before. “If you want the training method, I don’t mind selling it. However, in addition to a fully-equipped headquarters in Jin Hai City, it will also cost you 1,000 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid!”
