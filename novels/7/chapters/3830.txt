Chapter 3831 - 905 - Zero Wing's Mortal God?

“They still haven’t given us a price,” Hidden Soul answered. “As Snow and I couldn’t get in touch with you recently, we used that as an excuse to avoid discussions. But judging from their tone and how many unfamiliar Level 230-plus experts have appeared in Shadowring Town recently, I suspect they won’t take no for an answer.”

“Won’t take no for an answer?” Shi Feng sneered. “Okay, I understand. If they get in touch with you again, have them contact me directly.”

Evidently, Shadowring Town had become an even fatter sheep in the various powers’ eyes ever since the Tower of the Abyss’s addition. However, who would end up the hunter and the hunted remained to be seen.

“Oh, right,” Hidden Soul said, suddenly recalling something. “Miss Frey from the Galaxy Conglomerate sent you an invitation a few days ago.” She pulled out a gold invitation card and handed it to Shi Feng. “According to the invitation, you are invited to attend a once-in-a-century trade fair hosted by Desolate Star City, a newly promoted first-tier mobile city. It just so happens that the trade fair’s opening ceremony is today.”

“Even the Galaxy Conglomerate is sending out invitations? It seems this trade fair is quite something.” Shi Feng was surprised as he looked at the invitation card.

It was indeed rare for a second-tier mobile city to be promoted into a first-tier mobile city in the Greater World. Each interstellar continent typically experienced such an event only once every few decades, and some might see the birth of a first-tier city only once in a century.

Thus, Desolate Star City hosting a grand trade fair to celebrate its promotion wasn’t strange. The event could boost the city’s fame and announce its status to the rest of the Starlight Continent. If it could get many powers to attend the event, it could also showcase its strength and influence.

However, while the birth of first-tier mobile cities might be rare, after years of development, the various interstellar continents had come to possess quite a few first-tier cities. Nowadays, the average interstellar continent had at least ten first-tier cities, while more developed ones have twenty or even thirty. The Galaxy Conglomerate, which reigned over the Starlight Continent, normally wouldn’t even bother celebrating the birth of a first-tier city, let alone take the initiative to invite others to join the celebration.

The Galaxy Conglomerate’s willingness to send out invitations on Desolate Star City’s behalf showed that there was something special about the city. At the very least, it wasn’t the average first-tier city.

“Are you going? I can arrange a flight for you if you are,” Hidden Soul asked. “If you leave on a passenger plane now, you should be able to make it in time.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“That won’t be necessary. Vice President Xia has already arranged it for me,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head as he put away the invitation with a smile.

Subsequently, Shi Feng instructed Hidden Soul to recruit more members for Zero Wing in the Eternal Realm. He also instructed her to extend Zero Wing’s recruitment to the rest of the Greater God’s Domain. Any player who had reached the fourth-floor standard, regardless of their level or equipment, could join Zero Wing. Additionally, he had all core members and executives of Zero Wing gather in Shadowring Town within a day so that he could help them level up once he returned from the trade fair.

“Guild Leader, isn’t it too soon for us to recruit fourth-floor experts from the rest of the Greater God’s Domain?” Hidden Soul was shocked to hear that Shi Feng wanted to recruit fourth-floor experts from all over the Greater God’s Domain.

She wasn’t surprised that Shi Feng wanted to help them level up. After all, the Eternal Realm’s native players were all frantically grinding for levels. They all wanted to increase their strength and seize more resources before high-level players entered the Eternal Realm en masse.

However, recruiting fourth-floor experts from the Greater God’s Domain was an entirely different matter.

Setting aside whether Zero Wing had the manpower and resources to recruit members on such a large scale, nobody would respond positively to its recruitment, even if it could fulfill these requirements. On the contrary, Zero Wing would become a laughingstock in the Greater God’s Domain.

Fourth-floor experts might be common in the Eternal Realm, but they held significant influence in the Greater God’s Domain’s various Realms. They typically occupied high positions in hegemonic powers, as hegemonic powers needed to make substantial investments to produce experts of such caliber.

Zero Wing was nothing more than an upstart Guild from the Eternal Realm. Even if it did hold significant influence in the Eternal Realm, it remained insignificant in the vast Greater God’s Domain.

“It’s fine. Just spread the word. While you’re at it, you can announce that Zero Wing now commands a Mortal God. Additionally, core members of Zero Wing can redeem Life Potions without limit, while internal members can redeem one bottle a day, and normal members can redeem one bottle every three days,” Shi Feng said firmly.

“A Mortal God?!” Hidden Soul was stunned. “Do we really have a Mortal God?!”

“Mhm.” Shi Feng chuckled. “It’s even someone you know.”

“Someone I know?” Hidden Soul couldn’t help but doubt her ears when she heard Shi Feng’s words.

A Mortal God was akin to legends and myths in the Greater God’s Domain. Until now, Hidden Soul had only heard about the existence of a Mortal God through Gentle Snow, Fervent Samsara, and Heavy Abyss. According to them, when Ink Crystal was revealed to be a Mortal God during the Continental Championship, she shocked the three races’ chosen ones. Moreover, she had thoroughly crushed the chosen ones of the three races; nobody had been able to draw out her true strength.

“It’s Commander Frost,” Shi Feng explained with a smile. “She was lucky enough to reach the sixth-floor standard ten days ago with the Tower of the Abyss’s help.”

Although Red Frost was Holy Dragon Spear’s future Great Commander, she was also Zero Wing’s training consultant. Thus, it wasn’t a lie to say that Red Frost was a member of Zero Wing.

“Commander Frost has reached the sixth-floor standard? And it happened ten days ago?” Hidden Soul grew even more surprised.

Everyone who was an internal member of Zero Wing or above knew that Red Frost was a first-class expert, even among fifth-floor experts. Many experts in Zero Wing had sparred with Red Frost before, and Hidden Soul was no exception. Thus, she didn’t find it impossible that Red Frost had achieved the sixth-floor standard. Even so, rationality still made her incredulous.

If Red Frost had truly reached the sixth-floor standard, it would bring Zero Wing unimaginable prosperity. Star Lake City would also undergo a metamorphosis because of her.

Once this news spread, players from all over the Greater World would flock to Star Lake City. Zero Wing would also become famous throughout the Greater God’s Domain.

“Alright, enough daydreaming. Hurry up and go,” Shi Feng said, waving his hand in front of Hidden Soul’s eyes.

“Okay! I’ll get it done right away!” When Hidden Soul came back to her senses, her eyes shone with unprecedented joy. Then, she sped out of the room, practically teleporting.

While Hidden Soul was making her way to the God’s Domain Association and arranging for the promotion of Zero Wing’s recruitment drive in the Greater God’s Domain, Shi Feng rushed to the airport to await the arrival of the Green God Corporation’s private plane.
