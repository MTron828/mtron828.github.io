Chapter 62 – Flowing Water Realm

“Log into your ID,” Shi Feng said to Wu Xiaoxiao as he pointed at the virtual gaming cabins situated beside the podium.

Due to God’s Domain’s global popularity and increasing relevance in the real world, entertainment and training centers weren’t the only ones with virtual combat rooms nowadays. Even the various God’s Domain Academies would have virtual training facilities.

Meanwhile, the super-large classroom came equipped with over a hundred holographic imaging equipment that could perfectly replicate a person’s God’s Domain character in the classroom. Moreover, users could operate their characters as if they were moving their real bodies; there wouldn’t be any delay in control whatsoever. With this equipment, instructors could provide more in-depth guidance to students even without entering God’s Domain.

After hearing Shi Feng’s words, Wu Xiaoxiao got into a virtual gaming cabin without hesitation. Then, a moment later, a silver-haired woman holding a crystal staff and wearing a golden robe appeared on the podium that measured over a dozen meters in radius.

“That’s the Crimson Meteor! I can’t believe Dazzle Wave actually gave her one of their most prized weapons!” Liang Feng exclaimed, feelings of shock and envy appearing in his eyes when he saw the crystal staff in Wu Xiaoxiao’s hand.

The crystal staff was named Crimson Meteor, and it ranked 99th in the God’s Domain Epic Weapon List!

One shouldn’t underestimate the Epic Staff simply because it was ranked 99th. The God’s Domain Epic Weapon List was a list the Secret Pavilion created, and it featured only 100 of the best Epic Weapons that existed in the current God’s Domain. Every Epic Weapon on the list was a supreme weapon capable of rivaling Fragmented Legendary Weapons, and players could use them up to Level 150 without having to change weapons.

“Her robe is not much inferior to the Crimson Meteor, either,” Chen Ziyou said, her eyes similarly filled with jealousy when she looked at Wu Xiaoxiao. “The Starlight eight-piece set. This is the Epic Set Equipment that Skyfrost relied on to become a Famed Smith. I heard that only three sets were made. Back when it was first created, one Starlight Set could go for a plot of golden Land in any of the five Holy Cities.”

“It sure is great to have a major power’s backing. She’s practically unstoppable in the Miniature Ancient World with such equipment. I think she can even fight against the Mythic monsters in the Miniature Ancient World,” Liang Feng said with a bitter smile.

While combat standards were indeed important in God’s Domain, weapons and equipment were even more important. This was because weapons and equipment served as the foundation of players, whereas combat standards acted as a bonus to this foundation. Without proper equipment, the benefits a player could reap from their combat standard would be significantly reduced.

To offer an example, imagine an ordinary player geared in top-tier equipment rated at 100 points. If this ordinary player was capable of exhibiting only 50% of their actual combat power, the actual combat power of this player would be rated at 50 points.

Then, imagine a top-tier player capable of exhibiting 90% of their actual combat power geared in average equipment rated at 50 points. The actual combat power of this top-tier player would be rated at only 45 points.

Despite having vastly superior combat standards, the top-tier player with average equipment would still be inferior to the ordinary player with top-tier equipment. This was the harsh reality players needed to face in virtual reality games such as God’s Domain.

Not to mention, combat power was only one of the many bonuses players had to boost their combat power. After factoring in other bonuses, the gap between the two players would only continue to grow.

Although Liang Feng and Chen Ziyou had also received secret invitations from many first-rate Guilds, the amount of support these first-rate Guilds were willing to provide them definitely wasn’t close to the support Wu Xiaoxiao had received from Dazzle Wave. Now, not only were they inferior to Wu Xiaoxiao in terms of combat standards, but they were also inferior to her in terms of equipment standards. It was a truly despairing situation…

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng scrutinized Wu Xiaoxiao’s equipment for a moment, he nodded and said, “Not bad. Your equipment is good. Do you have any specific guidance you want to receive?”

Others might think that Wu Xiaoxiao’s equipment standard was excellent, but it could only be considered average for Shi Feng. It was especially true now that the current God’s Domain had yet to join the Greater God’s Domain. These so-called top-tier weapons and equipment would only be useful in the current God’s Domain.

Once this sub-world gained access to the Greater God’s Domain, over 99% of the currently available weapons and equipment would fall into disuse.

The reason for this was simple. It was because the craftsmanship level of this sub-world was vastly inferior to the craftsmanship level of other sub-worlds. In other more-developed sub-worlds, all of the weapons and equipment they produced were close to rivaling Mana Weapons and Equipment. Not only did the items these Outerworlds created carry Mana, but they could even be repaired using Magic Crystals. Meanwhile, these Mana-imbued items gave players an easier time to use combat techniques, Mana Techniques, Skills, Spells, etc., drastically increasing their combat power.

Simply put, the bonuses provided by the current God’s Domain’s equipment came in the form of addition, whereas the bonuses provided by Outerworld equipment came in the form of multiplication…

During Shi Feng’s previous life, it had been a huge shock to everyone when they discovered the craftsmanship level of more-developed sub-worlds.

Meanwhile, after hearing Shi Feng’s question, Wu Xiaoxiao pondered for a moment before Hidden Soul’s figure suddenly popped into her mind. Then, she asked, “I have been having trouble facing the ambush of Assassins recently, Instructor Shi. Is there any way I can deal with these ambushes?”

After training with Hidden Soul, Wu Xiaoxiao had come to appreciate the terror of Assassins. At the same time, she came to realize how unprepared she was for melee combat. Although she had racked her mind for solutions, not once did she manage to dodge or block Hidden Soul’s attacks throughout their several hour-long training session.

As soon as Wu Xiaoxiao finished speaking, Qin Wuchen and the others also promptly perked up their ears.

Big Sis is so cunning. She’s actually having Instructor Shi to help her answer Instructor Soul’s challenge. Wu Lingling grew speechless when she heard her elder sister’s question. Even so, she still couldn’t help but lean forward a little to hear Shi Feng’s response.

“Cope with an Assassin’s ambush?” Looking at Wu Xiaoxiao, Shi Feng calmly said, “That’s simple. You just need to reach the Flowing Water Realm.”
