Chapter 3780 - 854 - Flame Dragon God's Nest

The mountainous gate enveloped in red-hot flames stood quietly in the middle of Flame Vein Holy City, its sudden appearance putting a damper on the brewing battle.

“Is that…a Taboo Secret Land’s entrance? But the Divine Might it’s giving off is much stronger than that of Level 220 Taboo Secret Lands. Could it be a Level 230 Taboo Secret Land?”

“Impossible. I’ve been to the Level 230 Taboo Secret Land under the Dragon God Palace’s control. The Divine Might its entrance radiated was only at the standard of Level 220 Ancient Gods. This entrance’s Divine Might is even more frightening than the Level 240-plus Ancient Gods I’ve encountered.”

“Could this be a Level 240 Taboo Secret Land?”

The crimson gate that suddenly appeared piqued the curiosity of the players from Flame Vein Holy City and the two invading empires.

Secret lands weren’t particularly rare in the Greater God’s Domain. Unlike dungeons, the inside of a secret land was like a miniature world. There were many monsters and rare resources for players to harvest. Thus, every Level 200-plus Taboo Secret Land was a leveling paradise for players.

It was common knowledge that the difficulty of leveling up would skyrocket once players reached Level 200. However, so long as players were willing to fork out the money, they could still pay to enter the Level 200-plus Taboo Dungeons under the various powers’ control. The only problem was that each dungeon instance had a limited number of monsters. Additionally, dungeons would also enter a cooldown period once players completed them.

However, Taboo Secret Lands were different. Although the Bosses inside secret lands would not respawn after getting killed, the other monsters respawned like monsters out in the fields—and fairly quickly at that. Moreover, the monsters of Taboo Secret Lands were much easier to kill than those of Taboo Dungeons. Players didn’t need to operate in teams; they could grind in relative safety in parties of six.

Unfortunately, because there were much fewer Taboo Secret Lands than Taboo Dungeons, any that appeared in the Greater God’s Domain would immediately be snatched up by the various powers. Even apex powers would join in on the action if it wasn’t inconvenient; they would never complain about owning too many Taboo Secret Lands. This was why the various powers’ members were at a higher level than independent players on average.

When it came to Level 240 Taboo Secret Lands, only apex powers owned them. Unless one was a genius nurtured by an apex power, one could only dream of entering a Level 240 Taboo Secret Land.

What’s going on? When Shi Feng saw the crimson gate, confusion colored his eyes. Why is the Flame Dragon God’s Nest active already?

The Flame Dragon God’s Nest might be new to the players and powers in the current Greater God’s Domain, but it was known by all in his previous life.

The Flame Dragon God’s Nest!

It was one of only three super-large-scale Taboo Secret Lands found in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain. It was also one of only three Level 240-plus Taboo Secret Lands found in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain.

When the Flame Dragon God’s Nest initially appeared in his previous life, everyone assumed it was merely a Level 240 Taboo Secret Land. But because of Holy Dragon Spear’s excellent security measures and the fact that the various apex powers were busy dealing with the Holy Race’s invasion, nobody could investigate the secret land in detail. This situation changed only when the Holy Race’s invasion reached the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At the time, to resist the Holy Race’s invasion, Holy Dragon Spear had decided to let outsiders enter the Flame Dragon God’s Nest en masse. From that point onward, the various powers learned that the Flame Dragon God’s Nest wasn’t just a Level 240 Taboo Secret Land like they initially assumed. Instead, it was a Level 240-plus Taboo Secret Land. The various powers also understood how Holy Dragon Spear could defeat an army of one million Holy Race experts with just ten thousand Tier 6 experts.

Yet, in this life, even though the war with the Holy Race had yet to begin, the Flame Dragon God’s Nest had already been activated. It was also done when Holy Dragon Spear was completely unprepared.

“Why do you have the entrance key?” South Lake gazed at Ember Dragon in disbelief after he saw the towering crimson gate.

“Why are you so surprised that I have it?” Ember Dragon said as he glanced at South Lake. “Do you think you’re the only ones who can obtain a Primordial Dragon Legacy? Do you think you’re the only ones who have entered those super-ancient ruins?”

“No wonder we could never find the entrance key!” Realization dawned on South Lake.

Through a stroke of luck, Holy Dragon Spear had obtained a teleportation key that could periodically open a teleportation gate to the super-ancient ruins inside the Flame Dragon God’s Nest. However, because they could never find the secret land’s entrance key mentioned in the super-ancient ruins’ records, they could only stare at the secret land’s sealed entrance. Now, it was revealed that Ember Dragon had the entrance key all along.

“So what if you have the entrance key?” Apocalypse said as he rose from his seat and cast a cold gaze at Ember Dragon. “You are in Holy Dragon Spear’s Flame Vein Holy City! Do you think you can come and go from here as you please?”

When Apocalypse finished speaking, his personal information, which was previously hidden, became available for all to see.

Level 240!

Besides being one level higher than South Lake, Apocalypse was fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. Additionally, because he was at Level 240, his Divine Artifacts could unleash their Basic Attributes at the maximum, allowing his Basic Attributes to achieve heights much greater than those of the Level 239 South Lake.

When the Holy Dragon Spear members present saw Apocalypse’s level, surprise and a sense of pride filled them. Their confidence in dealing with the two empires’ forces also grew.

Level 240 was a major turning point for players and NPCs. With the help of the Holy City’s magic arrays, Apocalypse would have no problem dealing with Hawke Barron or Highgate by himself. Once Flame Vein Holy City’s City Lord joined the fight, the Dragon God Palace’s and the Divine Wing Dynasty’s members would have a very difficult time entering the Holy City.

If the two pseudo-apex powers couldn’t even enter the Holy City, they shouldn’t even think of entering the Flame Dragon God’s Nest, much less take control of the secret land.

“As expected of one of the Ten Great Berserker Gods from over a century ago. Only apex powers and a few pseudo-apex powers can take out someone of your level,” Ember Dragon said as he looked at Apocalypse, who exuded an aura much stronger than even that of South Lake, Holy Dragon Spear’s Great Commander. “But since we dared to act, do you think we came unprepared?”

After saying so, Ember Dragon crushed the dragon eye in his hand. Immediately afterward, the crimson gate opened and sucked all Tier 6 players within one million yards of it, leaving only the NPCs of the Holy City and the two empires to confront each other.
