Chapter 2690 – Unknown Metal Fragments

What a powerful phenomenon!

Shi Feng’s heart was filled with surprise when he saw the dozen or so items quietly hovering in midair.

He had seen many kinds of monster loot before. He had even seen loot accompanied by a Holy Chant. However, this was the first time he had seen or heard of the phenomenon the Outer Path Guardian’s loot created.

Currently, all Mana within a 50-yard radius of the dropped items was getting banished from the area. Even the Mana within his body was rapidly depleting.

Right now, if a player with a Silver Mana Body were standing here, they would most likely have lost consciousness instantly from Mana exhaustion.

Seeing this situation, Shi Feng did not dare hesitate for too long. Immediately, he stepped forward and tried to store the loot in his bag space.

However, the instant he touched one of the dropped items, a system notification entered his ears.

...

System: This item should not be stored, as it has an extremely powerful repulsion toward Mana. Storing it in your Epic Spatial Bag involves a certain degree of danger. Do you wish to store this item in your Epic Spatial Bag?

...

Should not be stored?

Shi Feng was quite surprised at the system notification. However, despite his surprise, he still chose to store the loot in his Epic Spatial Bag. After all, he would lose his life if he didn’t put the items into his bag space and allowed the Mana Repulsion Field to continue existing.

As he stored the items in his bag one after another, the Mana environment within the cave gradually recovered. Upon seeing this, he could not help a sigh of relief.

How close. These items truly are strange. Had I been a few seconds later in taking action, they probably would’ve drained all my Mana. Sitting down, Shi Feng shuddered involuntarily as he checked the 15 new items inside his bag space.

Previously, the Outer Path Guardian was already plenty astonishing, as it could actually freeze the Mana around it, preventing players from using the ambient Mana. For players that relied heavily on Skills and Spells during combat, this was a fatal ability.

However, these dropped items were even more amazing. They had directly banished all the Mana within a 50-yard radius. Not even the Mana within his body was exempt. This situation was simply unheard-of.

If players encountered these extraordinary items without any means to store the items, they would definitely meet their deaths.

Despite Shi Feng’s wariness toward these items, he could not hold back his curiosity and started inspecting them.

After he used his Identification Skill on these items, he was stunned. He couldn’t appraise any of these 15 metal fragments. Even after he activated Omniscient Eyes, all he got was that these metal fragments were named as “Unknown Metal Fragment” and that they were originally part of a weapon. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Crap! What kind of weapon was it?! Isn’t it a little too amazing?! Just its fragments alone are so powerful already! Even Legendary Weapons are not that powerful! Shi Feng was astonished when he saw the little information Omniscient Eyes obtained.

In God’s Domain, Legendary items usually deteriorated into Fragmented Legendary items because their core component had suffered damage, which prevented them from exhibiting their true might. However, if a Legendary Weapon got shattered into numerous fragments, rather than becoming multiple Fragmented Legendary Weapons, the Legendary Weapon would become garbage. Only if the shards were recast and more material was added was there a chance of them becoming a Fragmented Legendary Weapon.

Yet, despite not having undergone any rework, the fragments in his bag still exhibited such a powerful Mana Repulsion effect. Even the strongest Legendary Weapons he had heard of were unlikely to be so powerful.

However, Shi Feng did not dwell on the metal fragments. After getting enough rest, he left them sitting inside his bag space and resumed attacking the cliff wall.

Since he now knew that the Outer Path Guardians provided Legacy Power and that the Guardians spawned from the rubble of the cliff, he naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity to kill two birds with one stone get away.

However, despite Shi Feng repeatedly using Holy Devour on the cliff wall, not every attack of his caused an Outer Path Guardian to spawn. Roughly one Guardian spawned for every three or four attacks he executed. As a result, his accumulation of Legacy Power wasn’t going as fast as he initially expected.

Moreover, because of the Legacy Land’s harsh environment, which severely hampered Stamina and Concentration recovery, Shi Feng’s recovery rate wasn’t particularly fast despite the high-ranking foods and beverages he consumed. At best, it was like he was resting inside an ordinary town.

Fortunately, he was familiar with the harsh environments of Tier 4 Legacy Lands and had made preparations beforehand. Long before he could challenge his Tier 4 Promotion Quest, he had already tasked Melancholic Smile with stockpiling a large amount of high-ranking foods and beverages in the Guild’s Warehouse for both himself and the rest of the Guild’s core upper echelon. Hence, he currently had more than enough high-ranking foods and beverages to last him for two whole months.

As Shi Feng relentlessly attacked the cliff and killed Outer Path Guardians, his experience bar filled up rapidly. His mastery over the simplified Holy Devour also improved. Only, as the number of Outer Path Guardians he killed increased, the number of Unknown Metal Fragments he obtained conversely decreased.

Initially, each kill yielded him more than ten fragments. Eventually, that number dropped to single digits. Now, he got just one or two from every kill.

As Shi Feng progressed down the cliff, he had unknowingly spent nine days inside the Legacy Land. After nine days of constant grinding, Shi Feng had reached Level 124. If not for Demon God Atlock’s Soul Curse, he would’ve already reached the Level 125 threshold.

As for the accumulation of Legacy Power, he had reached 83% Completion Rate already, just 2% away from the minimum requirement to activate his Tier 4 Legacy. As for the Unknown Metal Fragments, he had collected a total of 96.

Meanwhile, a lot had also happened in the outside world during these nine days.

Thanks to the 50 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids Muxin provided as a deposit, Shi Feng could afford to consume one bottle per day, meeting the energy requirements of his brain. His body’s condition also improved considerably. However, if he wished to recover to his peak state, he still needed Life Potions.

Aside from that, Zero Wing’s main force members also started exiting the spatial maze one after another. However, as Fire Dance, Aqua Rose, Gentle Snow, and two dozen or so other players had taken different paths midway through the maze, they remained trapped inside.

Along with the return of the majority of Zero Wing’s main force, the prosperous Zero Wing flourished even more. After returning to the eastern continent, Zero Wing’s main force members continuously raided large-scale and super-large-scale Team Dungeons, enriching the Guild Warehouse with plenty of rare materials.

Including the rare materials brought back from the western continent, Melancholic Smile and the others produced batch after batch of Level 120 weapons and equipment. Now, when it came to Level 120 weapons and equipment, Zero Wing surpassed the various superpowers. For a time, Zero Wing entered the spotlight of the neighboring kingdoms and empires, and many expert players and well-known adventurer teams applied to join Zero Wing.

However, during all of this, a very shocking matter got exposed.

The true identity of Zero Wing’s mysterious Guild Leader, Black Flame!

When this information spread, it shocked the eastern continent’s various powers. This was especially true for Unyielding Soul, Crimson Emperor, and the Secret Pavilion, superpowers that were partners of Zero Wing. None of them had ever thought that Zero Wing was truly a Guild that had no background whatsoever and that a youth like Shi Feng had developed it from scratch.

God’s Domain’s various powers no longer feared Zero Wing. Many powers started secretly targeting Zero Wing’s internal members. At the same time, they spent huge sums to snatch the Heaven’s Rumble Training Center’s disciples and customers of Zero Wing’s virtual combat platforms. They even offered astronomical prices to poach Zero Wing’s core members, resulting in a brain drain of Zero Wing’s internal members and core members day after day.

“Guild Leader, another dozen core members have applied for withdrawal today. In addition, quite a few training centers’ and dojos’ disciples have come challenging our training center’s disciples, and several of our disciples got injured. Even Master Lei Bao himself got challenged by a mysterious half-step grandmaster martial artist on his way home and ended up suffering heavy injuries. That mysterious expert warned Master Lei Bao that if he remained in Zero Wing, there would be more of such incidents. Moreover, several superpowers have sent representatives to our headquarters. They say that so long as we let them become shareholders of Zero Wing, they’ll make all these problems go away,” Liang Jing reported in frustration.

“However, these still aren’t the most crucial matters. The biggest problem is that the suppliers that previously provided us with S-rank Nutrient Fluids and state-of-the-art training facilities now refuse to do business with us. Moreover, nobody is commissioning our Guild for tasks anymore. At this rate, we can only rely on exchanging Coins for Credits to maintain our Guild’s daily operations.”

“I understand. For now, make use of Silverwing City’s income to fill in the gaps,” Shi Feng said, nodding. “Also, did you find out which superpower sent that expert that injured Lei Bao?”

“I checked with the Secret Pavilion. Although the other party hid themselves quite thoroughly, the Secret Pavilion still managed to find out who sent that expert. It’s Dragonheart Island’s War Blood adventurer team,” Liang Jing said.

“War Blood?” In an icy tone, Shi Feng said, “It seems these superpowers really think Zero Wing is some kind of pushover. Do they honestly believe I can’t do anything against them?”

“Guild Leader, we don’t have the home-ground advantage on Dragonheart Island. Moreover, Starlink and a few other superpowers have partnered with War Blood. They also have a Medium Fortress. Right now, our forces are tied up defending Silverwing City and Stone Forest City. If we dispatch a large number of experts to Dragonheart Island, I’m afraid...” When Liang Jing heard Shi Feng’s words, she hurriedly tried to dissuade him from taking any rash actions.

“I know. I’ll handle this matter myself,” Shi Feng said calmly before hopping back into his virtual gaming cabin and logging into God’s Domain.
