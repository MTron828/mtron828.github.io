Chapter 2893 – Natural Holy Land

“Entering the secret land at this time?”

Cold Shadow was stunned when she saw Shi Feng instructing Zero Wing’s executives to enter the Evil God’s Secret Land’s entrance located on the second floor. She couldn’t understand what was going through Shi Feng’s mind.

It wouldn’t be long before the Outerworld’s NPC conquest army launched its invasion of the eastern continent. Meanwhile, even ten Zero Wings wouldn’t be enough to stop the advance of these armies.

Zero Wing’s top priority should be the recruitment of a large number of expert players to fend off the Outerworld’s players and NPCs. Otherwise, only annihilation awaited the Guild.

Even without conducting any investigations, Cold Shadow was certain that the eastern continent’s various superpowers had already begun recruiting expert players themselves. If Zero Wing did not hurry, it would fall behind them.

Hence, this was no time for Zero Wing’s Tier 4 members to be raiding a secret land.

However, when Cold Shadow saw Zero Wing’s members entering the secret land one after another, she had no choice but to enter the secret land together with White Feather and the others. After all, not only was this the Guild Leader’s arrangement, but the other Zero Wing executives did not voice any objections, either. It wouldn’t be appropriate for a newcomer like herself to express her views in such a situation.

What Cold Shadow didn’t know was that Fire Dance and the others had previously reminded Shi Feng of Zero Wing’s situation. However, Shi Feng still insisted on carrying out this raid.

His insistence on this raid was because he was certain that apex combatants would play the main role in deciding the upcoming war’s outcome.

While low-tier expert players could indeed play an important role in wars involving kingdoms, empires, and even entire worlds, they were still significantly weaker than higher-tier players. Several thousand Tier 3 players were no match for one Tier 4 player in a large-scale battle. Similarly, several hundred Tier 4 players couldn’t compare with one Tier 5 player.

In a situation where the NPC combatants of both worlds were roughly equal, the players’ apex combatants would play a vital role. If the eastern continent’s player forces lacked sufficiently powerful apex combatants to influence the battlefield, no amount of Tier 3 players could change the war’s outcome. There was no way a bunch of Tier 3 players could defend against Tier 4 and Tier 5 players in the long run.

Hence, at this critical moment, Zero Wing needed to increase its apex combatants. Otherwise, Shi Feng wouldn’t have decided to enter the Evil God’s Secret Land after preparing potions for just two days.

After Cold Shadow and the others entered the Evil God’s Secret Land, Shi Feng took the other entrance, leaving behind only four Tier 4 NPCs to guard the control room.

Upon entering the Evil God’s Secret Land, a wave of nausea assaulted everyone’s brain, and everything around them appeared pitch-black. After this situation lasted for ten seconds, they gradually recovered, and they found themselves standing in a primitive forest.

“What’s with this situation?!”

White Feather gaped in shock when she saw the forest around her.

She had visited many secret lands before, so she had long since become familiar with them. Even if it was a secret land she had never visited before, she was confident she could cope with whatever situation she came across. However, the sight before her was a first for her.

A dark sky enveloped the entire secret land, and only a blood moon served as a faint light source.

The trees in the forest were hundreds of meters tall, with some even towering over a thousand meters. Compared to the trees here, the trees in the outside world were saplings. Players like themselves were practically ants when standing beside these gigantic trees.

However, the blood moon and gigantic trees still weren’t the most astonishing part about this secret land. Instead, the greatest shock was the monsters here. At a glance, White Feather spotted over a hundred Level 150-plus Mythic monsters in the vicinity, outnumbering the entire team. These monsters stood in groups of ten to twenty, and a Level 160-plus Superior Mythic monster led each of these groups. The aura these Superior Mythic monsters radiated was also significantly more powerful than that of Superior Mythic monsters in the outside world.

(Evil Blood Soldier] (Evil Creature, Mythic) Level 153 35,000,000,000

(Evil Blood Stalker] (Evil Creature, Superior Mythic) Level 160 80,000,000,000

To White Feather’s horror, all of these Mythic and Superior Mythic monsters had already noticed the team’s presence. However, instead of charging at the team like wild beasts, these monsters stood still and appeared to be observing the team. They would also grunt occasionally. Evidently, these monsters were communicating with each other and were in no hurry to take action.

However, amid her horror, White Feather also sensed the Evil God’s Secret Land’s incredible environment.

Even without deliberately focusing her senses, White Feather could tell that the secret land’s Mana density was incredible. She felt as if she was drinking a mouthful of water with every breath she took. The clarity of the Mana’s operating principles was also unprecedented, surpassing even that of the City Lord’s Mansion by a large margin.

She even felt that if she could stay here, she could improve her Mana Body before long. Perhaps she could even try to reach the 115% Completion Rate, a threshold very few people had reached in Mythology.

“The space here is unique. The suppression it imposes on our bodies is significant,” Cold Shadow said, frowning slightly after she tried moving her body. “I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for us to fight these monsters under these conditions.”

The number of Mythic monsters was already more than what their team could handle. With their mobility restricted on top of that, there was no way they could survive, let alone enjoy the Mana environment here and improve themselves.

Upon hearing Cold Shadow’s deduction, Fire Dance tried moving her body as well. She instantly created three afterimages around her, her speed so fast that the Tier 4 players could barely keep her in sight. She then nodded and said, “It will indeed be slightly difficult, but it is still within an acceptable range.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Still within an acceptable range?

White Feather gaped in shock when she saw Fire Dance’s ghost-like movements.

White Feather had already developed her Mana Body to the 105% Completion Rate. However, when she tried moving in this secret land, she felt as if someone had replaced her blood with lead. She couldn’t move her body freely, let alone create afterimages like Fire Dance.

However, Fire Dance wasn’t a unique case. When the other Zero Wing members tried moving, the effects the suppression from the surrounding space had on their mobility and combat power were limited and almost negligible.

White Feather and the other Tier 4 experts from Mythology were dumbfounded. Even Cold Shadow was astonished.

Are they all monsters?

It was understandable for Fire Dance to negate the secret land’s suppression, as she was the commander of Zero Wing’s main force. However, what was up with the others?

Cold Shadow herself faced a significant reduction in combat power in this secret land. Yet, Zero Wing’s 60-plus Tier 4 members fared better than her. In particular, Violet Cloud, Gentle Snow, and Aqua Rose appeared utterly unaffected by the secret land’s suppression.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng arrived in the secret land and tried moving his body, he smiled and thought to himself, This Evil God’s Secret Land truly is paradise. The air is filled to the brim with powerful Mana. Someone without sufficient control over the elements will face suppression from the space here. But if they stay here for a while, they’ll receive great help in developing and creating Mana Bodies.

Originally, Shi Feng had planned to rely on the ancient God’s Domain’s environment to improve Zero Wing’s members. However, he didn’t need to do so anymore. The Evil God’s Secret Land was the perfect replacement.

Moreover, players wouldn’t have to waste time on training. Fighting the monsters in this secret land would more than suffice to let players familiarize themselves with Mana’s operating principles. This was because players could even sense the operating principles of Mana’s various elements in the secret land with their bodies. Hence, players simply had to fight and experience the ambient Mana’s operating principles repeatedly to improve their control over Mana’s various elements. However, when Shi Feng arrived, the surrounding Mythic monsters immediately grew alert.

Shortly afterward, a 40-meter-tall Evil Blood Stalker clad in exquisite armor and holding a spear let loose a roar, inciting all of the monsters to charge at Zero Wing’s members.

“Dammit! Why are they charging at us all of a sudden?” Cold Shadow frowned when she saw the oncoming monsters.

Because of the secret land’s suppression, they might not even be a match for these monsters in a one-on-one situation. Over a hundred of these monsters charging at them en masse was an absolute nightmare. Among those present, only Shi Feng could cope with the attacks of multiple Mythic and Superior Mythic monsters simultaneously. However, Shi Feng wasn’t an MT but a damage dealer. In front of high-intellect monsters, dealing high damage wouldn’t be enough to attract their aggro. Only the Mock Skills of MTs could forcibly secure the aggro of these monsters; Shi Feng couldn’t aggro all of these monsters to himself.

So, they’ve decided to get rid of everyone else before targeting me? How smart of them. Shi Feng smiled when he saw the Evil Blood Soldiers and Stalkers splitting up and targeting different players. “Unfortunately, group tactics are useless against me!”

He immediately unleashed his Mana Domain and caught the Evil Blood Soldiers and Stalkers within it.

The instant he did so, Cold Shadow and the others were dumbfounded.

This was because Shi Feng was practically a God descending onto the mortal world at this time. Despite the Mana Domain holding no hostility to them, they still had their breath stifled.

As for the oncoming Evil Blood Soldiers and Stalkers, Shi Feng’s Mana Domain reduced their mobility by at least 50%. Some Evil Blood Soldiers even had difficulty taking a step. Compared to the time Shi Feng unleashed his Mana Domain against Saint’s Hand’s Tier 4 experts, his current Mana Domain was significantly more powerful.
