Chapter 326 – Invincible Among Tier 4

Silence!

Whether it was the participants present or spectating players watching the live broadcast, everyone went silent when they saw Markless Blade’s corpse gradually disintegrating and disappearing.

After a short silence, though, the players watching the live broadcast exploded into activity.

!!

“Markless Blade got defeated? Just like that?”

“Markless Blade can already exhibit 100% of his Tier 5 Magic Equipment’s effects, yet he still couldn’t endure those three slashes? This Black Flame is a monster!”

“If even Markless Blade lost to him, I think Black Flame has a good chance at competing for the top three spots. No wonder he dared to kill Unforgettable Leaf.”

“I didn’t think Markless Blade would be the first of the top ten seeded players to get eliminated. This is truly a surprise. The Myriad Forest Empire’s players were even touting how at least half of the top ten spots would belong to people from their empire. They must be looking dying from embarrassment right now.”

“Hahaha! Three slashes to fell Markless Blade! With this, our kingdom is going to see the rise of another paragon!”

“The Asura Sword Emperor, is it?”

Although it had been a long time since Markless Blade last made a public appearance, he was undoubtedly a paragon-level individual in the hearts of the Ancient River Kingdom’s and Myriad Forest Empire’s players. Moreover, he was a paragon capable of ranking within the top ten of the Myriad Forest Empire’s younger generation paragons.

Yet, now, Markless Blade had lost to Shi Feng. This was a shocking outcome, especially for the Ancient River Kingdom’s players. They were all excited by this outcome.

Subsequently, the name of the Asura Sword Emperor quickly spread, causing even more players to spectate Shi Feng’s fight through the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s broadcast.

The various kingdoms and empires often butt heads in the Greater God’s Domain. It was especially so when a neutral resource node was involved. These fights usually required the paragons of the involved nation to take to the battlefield. Meanwhile, the more experts a country had, the greater the advantage it would have in battle. This was why the ruling powers of the various kingdoms and empires tended to curry favor with the various Tier 4 and Tier 5 paragons.

These Tier 4 and Tier 5 paragons might not be a match for Tier 6 players in terms of actual combat power, but the value they could exhibit wouldn’t be inferior to Tier 6 players in the slightest.

The Ancient River Kingdom had already been in a weak state for a long time. So, it was definitely a great joy for the kingdom for a new paragon to appear in its territory.

Because of this unexpected development, the number of people spectating the broadcast of Shi Feng’s battle had also gone up from four hundred thousand to over a million. Moreover, this number was still rapidly increasing as time passed, the broadcast’s viewership quickly catching up to the broadcast of famous Tier 6 experts.

While the spectating players were holding their respective discussions, the members of Glorious Mantra’s, Martial Quadbeast’s, and Silent Saintess’s parties revealed very ugly expressions. In addition to fear, their faces also expressed a hint of anger.

They had a joint deal with Markless Blade. It was why they had helped Markless Bade in the first place.

Now that Markless Blade had died, their deal with Markless Blade to enter the top 20 together naturally became worthless. This meant that getting into the top 20 would become a big problem now.

The Galaxy Conglomerate would rarely hold invitational competitions, the last one being several decades ago. If they wished to avoid the challenge of getting into the official phase of the invitational competition, the best way would be to get into the top 20 of the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition.

If they couldn’t enter the Rookie Competition’s top 20, they’d have to face intense competition between countless experts originating from the various kingdoms and empires. Moreover, at that time, the experts they needed to face wouldn’t be limited to those from the younger generation. Many older generation experts would also be competing. After all, the Galaxy Conglomerate had set the age limit for its invitational competition this time at 35.

This meant paragons like Markless Blade, who were close to reaching the age limit, would join as well.

For the sake of giving the younger generation a chance, most hegemonic powers had refrained from sending their veteran paragons to participate in the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition this time. According to the information they received, there were still over 50 older generation paragons in the Rookie Competition.

Indeed!

Over 50 veteran paragons were in the Rookie Competition!

These veteran paragons had already lingered at Tier 4 for a long time. They were vastly superior to the younger generation paragons when it came to the development of their Mana Bodies, the weapons and equipment they possessed, and the Skills, Spells, Mana Techniques, and combat techniques they had mastered.

Because of the presence of these veteran paragons, it was no exaggeration to say that the difficulty of getting into the Rookie Competition’s top 20 this time was much greater than getting into the top 10 of the Myriad Forest Empire’s Battle of Geniuses.

However, before the three parties could think about how they should compete for the top 20, Glorious Mantra, Martial Quadbeast, and Silent Saintess suddenly felt Shi Feng’s gaze on them. This instantly put a lot of pressure on them.

“Black Flame, we won’t stop you anymore now that you’ve defeated Markless Blade. Why don’t we each go on our separate ways?” Martial Quadbeast, the oldest of the three paragons, took the initiative to suggest. “This will be good for all of us. I’m sure you don’t want to miss out on the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition, right?”

“The Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competitions come only once every several decades. You might have defeated Markless Blade, but I doubt you are currently in good shape. If we fight, we will only be benefiting the other parties. So, why bother?” Glorious Mantra chimed in.

Shi Feng might have killed Markless Blade, but anyone could tell that his complexion looked a lot paler than before. It was obvious that Shi Feng’s victory over Markless Blade wasn’t as easy as it seemed. So, it definitely wouldn’t be wise for Shi Feng to fight the three of them now.

The three of them definitely weren’t a match for Markless Blade in a one-versus-one situation. However, if the three of them worked together, even Markless Blade would have to flee. Although Shi Feng was stronger than Markless Blade, they were confident they could win against Shi Feng in his currently exhausted state.

When Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao heard Martial Quadbeast’s and Glorious Mantra’s words, they couldn’t help but sigh in relief. If the three parties were to work together to attack Shi Feng, it would definitely be disastrous for Shi Feng now that he had already revealed all of his cards.

Fortunately, the three slashes Shi Feng had used to kill Markless Blade were enough to deter the three parties from escalating the situation.

“Go on our separate ways?” Shi Feng looked at the three paragons for a moment. Then, he swung his sword and sent three slashes flying at them, saying, “Who do you think you are?”

When the three paragons saw the three Holy Annihilations rapidly approaching them, they mentally cursed at Shi Feng before using their respective trump cards, none of them daring to hold back.

Immediately, Martial Quadbeast summoned a Tier 4 Mythic ranked Titan Behemoth to defend him, Glorious Mantra waved his staff and transformed into a cloud of dark fog, and Silent Saintess formed over twenty magic barriers before her.

Boom!

After the three pitch-black sword lights hit their mark, apart from Martial Quadbeast, who had nearly half of his HP remaining, Glorious Mantra and Silent Saintess had hardly any HP remaining. On top of that, the three paragons were alone now as all of their party members were devoured by the pitch-black sword lights. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This scene dumbfounded the players spectating the battle’s broadcast.

“This… How is this possible?”
