Chapter 2767 – You Chose the Wrong Opponent

At the sudden appearance of Shi Feng’s group of five, the whole battlefield immediately went silent. The humans and Demons all stared at Shi Feng’s group with looks of surprise, confusion, or anger.

“Who are they?”

“They came out of that large spatial tear, so they shouldn’t be ordinary existences. Maybe they’re Guardians from the Holy City?”

“However, their auras seem weak. Those people are also only at Tier 3. They shouldn’t be the Holy City’s Guardians. Moreover, judging by their looks, they seem to be heaven-blessed individuals.”

The humans began a hushed discussion among themselves as they scrutinized Shi Feng’s group. Initially, they had held hope that Shi Feng’s group could save them. However, after noticing the five players’ auras, they immediately fell into despair.

The crimson-eyed knight peered at Shi Feng’s group with her blurry sight. It was evident that she, too, felt surprised and puzzled by the sudden appearance of Shi Feng’s group.

“Humanity’s heaven-blessed individuals?” When the Great Demon Nemen Carlo saw Shi Feng’s group, he, too, was shocked. “How is this possible?!”

Nemen Carlo wasn’t particularly surprised to see more heaven-blessed individuals of the human race appearing in this place. What shocked him was the spatial crack that these humans had arrived through. That massive spatial crack had carried an extraordinary amount of power; even he would lose his life if he accidentally came into contact with it. Yet, Shi Feng’s group had actually come out of it directly.

Compared to the humans and Demons originally fighting on this battlefield, however, the ones most surprised by the present situation were Shi Feng’s five.

How is this possible? Shi Feng’s heart surged with shock as he looked at a group of people standing among the human army. Why are there other players here?

Aside from the many NPCs, the human army also had quite a number of players. Moreover, the average level of these players was incredibly high; even the lowest-leveled among them was Level 128, while some had even surpassed Level 130. Shi Feng was certain that he had arrived in the ancient era of God’s Domain. After all, the environment here simply couldn’t be found anywhere in the modern God’s Domain.

The Mana in this land was so abundant that it was close to condensing into a liquid state. He could even clearly feel the magic elements in the air. Like sprites, some of the magic elements were cheerful and lively, some were cold and lonely, some were hot and angry, etc. He could sense all of this with exceptional clarity.

Moreover, the NPCs on this battlefield wore significantly different gear compared to the NPCs of modern times. Their weapons and equipment were of much higher quality.

In the modern God’s Domain, NPCs were mainly geared with Epic Weapons and Equipment; very few possessed Fragmented Legendary items. After all, Fragmented Legendary items were incredibly rare and precious even to NPCs.

However, that was far from the case for the NPCs here. Every NPC had at least one or two Fragmented Legendary items. The female knight leading the human army was even fully equipped in Fragmented Legendary items. The sword she wielded was also a top-tier Fragmented Legendary Weapon.

Moreover, what was even more incredible was that Shi Feng had found someone he recognized.

This person was none other than Yu Luo, a captain of the Heaven’s Blade adventurer team, based on Dragonheart Island. Only, unlike the Yu Luo he had met on Dragonheart Island, the one he was looking at now was like a completely different person. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Presently, not only had Yu Luo reached Level 129 already, but she even sported an Epic Staff and a full suit of Epic Equipment. Although her Epic Equipment wasn’t a set, her equipment standard was still ridiculously excellent.

Unlike the last time Shi Feng met Yu Luo, though, the Cleric looked much more haggard. She did not possess the aura and spirit of a peak expert at all.

“Guild Leader Black Flame?!”

Meanwhile, at this time, Yu Luo, who stood amid the human army, also noticed the five new arrivals on the battlefield. And when she saw that the man leading this group was none other than Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, Black Flame, her originally dispirited expression immediately became energetic. “Do you know them, Yu Luo?” the female Oracle standing beside Yu Luo asked curiously upon seeing the latter’s reaction. The female Oracle was a Level 131 player clad in a white dress, wearing a white priest’s hat.

“Yes. Moreover, he’s my fellow countryman,” Yu Luo said, nodding excitedly.

“Fellow countryman?” The female Oracle scrutinized Shi Feng’s group. She soon noticed that the average level of Shi Feng’s group was quite low, and their appearances indeed resembled Yu Luo’s a lot. Particularly, the feeling of incompatibility Shi Feng’s group had with the other players in God’s Domain was exactly the same as Yu Luo. The female Oracle then shook her head and said, “What a pity. His luck is truly poor. He actually got teleported to this place.”

Upon hearing the female Oracle’s words, Yu Luo remembered the situation they were in, and her heart grew cold.

The joy on her face promptly disappeared.

The death penalty in the God’s Domain they were currently in was different from the God’s Domain on the other side. Players would not only lose two or more levels upon death but also fall into a mentally weakened state. Depending on the severity of the situation, players might even lose some of their memories. And worse, the use of Resurrection Spells could only mitigate the loss of EXP and not restore the lost memories.

Moreover, even when resurrected using a Resurrection Spell, players wouldn’t be resurrected on the spot but inside the Life Temple of a random Main City run by humans.

Of course, if players had registered themselves with a Main City, they could get resurrected in the Life Temple of a fixed Main City.

However, Shi Feng’s group had just arrived in this world. They definitely hadn’t registered themselves with a Main City yet. If they died, they would get resurrected at a random Main City. Meanwhile, a great distance separated the Main Cities run by humans-and there were no teleportation arrays in these cities.

In other words, so long as Shi Feng’s group died, Yu Luo was unlikely to meet him again. After all, humans had many Main Cities, even in this world. Just the ones she knew already numbered over 500. As for the possibility of Shi Feng’s group coming out alive from this battlefield, that was simply impossible.

In the original God’s Domain, a group of Tier 3 players could still put up a fight against a Tier 4 Great Demon. However, in this world, let alone putting up a fight, Tier 3 players would be considered capable if they could escape with their lives.

The reason for this was the incredibly high average combat standard of the monsters here. Monsters of the caliber of Great Demons would possess combat standards rivaling peak experts. However, the combat system of monsters was completely different from the Realms of Refinement players relied on.

In Skill and Spell utilization, monsters such as Great Demons could display combat standards at the Spiritualization Realm without having to exert themselves. Such monsters were not opponents Void Realm experts like herself could hope to match.

However, before Yu Luo could snap out of her daze, the Great Demon Nemen Carlo stopped paying attention to Shi Feng’s group and shifted his gaze back to the crimson-eyed knight. The Great Demon then looked at the dozen or so Tier 3 Demons around him and commanded, “Go get rid of them!”

“Please leave it to us, Milord!”

The heavily injured Demons nodded and flapped their wings. They then flew toward Shi Feng’s group of five, their speed greatly surpassing even Tier 3, Agility-focused Assassins’.

“Not good! Those Demon Leaders are working together to target them!” The Level 131 female Oracle was shocked by this development. She never thought that Nemen Carlo would have his trusted subordinates deal with Shi Feng’s group. Although these Demon Leaders had been heavily injured by the Aria of Holy Blood, individually, they were still stronger than Tier 3 experts. In addition, if over a dozen of them worked together, they could form a demonic array that greatly increased their combat power.

“Big Sis Cloud, let’s go save them quickly!” Yu Luo urged anxiously when she saw the Demon Leaders targeting Shi Feng’s group.

She knew that Shi Feng was incredibly strong. After all, he was someone the various superpowers on Dragonheart Island had labeled a peerless expert. His strength surpassed even that of Domain Realm monsters.

However, not only did the Demons of this world possess high combat standards, but their demonic arrays also operated like the humans’ battle arrays. Even a peerless expert would fall in the face of such a group of Demons. “Die, humans!”

Runes suddenly lit up all over the Demon Leaders’ bodies. The auras they radiated also intensified significantly until they were just short of rivaling ordinary Great Demons in terms of strength. Simultaneously, the weapons in their hands turned into brilliant rays of light.

Tier 3 Combination Skill, Skyflower’s Shadow!

Immediately, countless red petals fell from the sky, heading toward Shi Feng’s group. Every flower petal tore space as they fluttered down, making it seem as if night was falling.

“You used a good Skill; I’ll give you that. Unfortunately, you chose the wrong opponent!”

Shi Feng snorted when he saw the red flower petals descending toward him. He then unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and unleashed his aura. Simultaneously, a Mana Domain spread out from his body, instantly covering a 1,000-yard radius and enveloping the entire battlefield.

The next moment, Yu Luo saw Shi Feng execute an upward slash with the Abyssal Blade.
