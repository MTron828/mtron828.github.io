Chapter 1831

“Ugh! Ek! Uchuchuchuchu!” 

“What does that mean?” 

“Eek! Kuweeek! Ugh!” 

“Since you lived with orcs, have you really become an orc?” 

“...Ahh, ah! Can you understand me right now? Haha, I turned off the interpreter. Isn’t it hard to be conscious of this every time? Please understand. It hasn’t been long since I’ve changed to the fifth class advancement.” 

“I’ve heard rumors. Isn’t it said that the fifth class advancement of the orcs strengthen the orcs’ habits?” 

“That’s right. It is a setting that despises the culture and habits of other species. So even the language I speak is the orc language. It is annoying in many ways.” 

The hundreds of burly orcs—they were all players, and most of them were Chinese. They fell for the propaganda of the Communist Party and changed their species to an orc. They visited Reinhardt as a group. 

“There is a terrible rumor that a second Great Human and Demon War will break out soon. We will try to help out a bit, so let us use the hell elevator.” 

“...I can’t do that,” Lauel stared blankly at the orcs who made the demand so confidently and refused. 

The orcs were bewildered. 

“Why? If we go to hell and get rid of some demons, won’t it help in the war? In the first place, didn’t you often open up the elevator to high level players in the early days? Why are you being like this all of a sudden?” 

“It was announced a few months ago, but it seems you have been living with your ears covered. Among the demons, special entities that become stronger as they hunt players have started to appear. We are trying to prevent people with poor skills from stepping out for no reason and raising the level of the enemies.” 

“Really? But we aren’t people with poor skills, right?” 

The impression of the orcs became fierce. It was natural. The orcs who visited Reinhardt today were strong players in the top 10,000 of the warrior class. The media outlets and fandoms that were friendly to them described them as ‘high rankers.’ 

Of course, it would’ve been unimaginable in the past. A person who ranked in the top 10,000 of their class, not even the overall rankings, was treated as a high ranker? It would’ve been a disgrace just a few years ago. The media who described them as high rankers would’ve been suspected of taking bribes and lost credibility. 

However, the times had changed. The average combat power of players had increased significantly. It was around the time of the Great Human and Demon War. In particular, the change in the world meant the number of people who owned legendary items increased dramatically. It was because there were many boss monsters. Now it wasn’t uncommon to see people handling field boss monsters of the same level alone or with less than three people. All of them were treated as high rankers. 

“I changed to the fifth class advancement. My overall ranking is in the triple digits. It might be impossible for me to join the Overgeared Guild, but I want to assist you with my strength, so I brought 250 high rankers to visit. You might not bow down to thank me, but you should at least welcome me, right?” 

“Hong An. I know you well. After changing to an orc, you rose through the ranks and became a superstar.” 

Hong An shrugged with confidence after hearing that Lauel knew him well. It was with an expression of great pride. The orc rankers who followed him proudly puffed up their chests. 

Lauel poured cold water on all of them, “But there is no law that states that skills are proportional to fame. What isn’t allowed isn’t allowed. You can’t use the elevator.” 

“...Why?” 

Hong An stood in a daze for a while and doubted his ears. Then he frowned. 

“Why are you ignoring me? Ranking is skills... no, have you ever seen me fighting in the first place? On what basis are you devaluing me? Ah, is it that? Are you ignoring me because I am Chinese? Is it because I am a fool who only listened to the party and changed to an orc? Then you are racist.” 

“How rude.” 

The moment Hong An raised his voice, Lauel’s escort responded immediately. Dozens of knights and hundreds of elite soldiers surrounded the group of orcs. 

Lauel restrained the knights who were about to strike and said, “Hong An, didn’t I say that I know you well? The feats you’ve achieved since becoming an orc. Most of it was exploited from other people, right? There is no way that a person who gained power in an unjustifiable way can use it properly.” 

“What does that mean? Do you want to be sued for defamation?” 

“There is a lot of evidence. Don’t tell me you are looking down on my information network?” 

“...Let’s concede and say that you are right. What is wrong with that? Isn’t it all the same anyway? Aren’t you also trampling on the weak and rising up? The one who gained power in an unfair manner is speaking nonsense. I guess your chuunibyou disease hasn’t been fixed.” 

“......”

“Why are you being so rude and merciless and regarding everything? It is good to help each other, right? In fact, Grid has repeatedly stated to the media that players should cooperate with each other. Why treat us so badly and make us feel resentment when our strength isn’t weak? Even if you don’t want to cooperate with us, you should try to maintain a smooth relationship. People think you are a genius because you are the number one contributor to creating an empire, but I’m disappointed to see that you aren’t as good as your reputation.” 

Hong An wasn’t agitated. He criticized Lauel very logically. What Lauel initially pointed out as the problem— 

In other words, the orcs had been focusing on Hong An’s unethical behavior, but now they found themselves nodding in agreement with him. 

Lauel sighed. “I understand why Hao advised me not to associate with you as much as possible.” 

“Hao...?” 

The orcs were agitated. His reputation plummeted after he was defeated by Grid several times in the National Competition and eventually became a subordinate of Kraugel and Grid. Even so, Hao was one of the best players who once represented China. He had been keeping a low profile these days, but his skills wouldn’t have gone anywhere. 

The Chinese media might criticize Hao, but the Chinese rankers still admired him. Above all, they trusted Hao because they knew that he was a man of integrity. 

“Hao told you not to deal with Hong An?” one of the orcs asked. 

“Now it makes sense. That traitor is playing tricks behind the scenes,” Hong An interjected, “Hao doesn’t want the Overgeared Guild to have a deep relationship with us Chinese rankers. His own transgressions might spread widely within the Overgeared Guild and weaken his position.” 

“What transgressions did Hao do? Admitting defeat to Grid in front of the whole world? Why is that a fault?” 

“I agree...” 

“I won’t say anything else to you. Be obediently captured.” 

“...Huh?” Hong An, who had kept his cool until the end, became dumbfounded. Captured? So suddenly? 

“Why?” 

“It is the sin of conspiring with the great demon, Rose.” 

“W-What? What do you mean?! Is there any evidence? Additionally, what right do you have to accuse me of a sin...?!” 

The orcs were agitated. 

The always composed Hong An was rarely agitated, so they wondered if Lauel’s words were true. 

“You are a man who gets along well with a traitor. It isn’t worth getting along with. Let’s stop playing around with nonsense and go back,” Hong An thought this couldn’t be done so he tried to regain his composure and urged his colleagues. 

The knights of the empire blocked his way. 

The knights of the Overgeared Empire—their equipment was full of legendary items. It was a sight that would be astonishing before the change in the world. Now it didn’t matter. 

“Lauel, remove these guys. I don’t want to be hostile to the Overgeared Guild by killing them for no reason.” 

“Don’t worry.” 

Lauel smiled. A black fire dragon appeared as he covered half his face with one hand. 

“They aren’t people you can beat.” 

The knights of the Overgeared Empire were trained by Piaro and Asmophel. They also inherited items that had been used by the Overgeared members themselves. They had a strength that was different from ordinary knights of other kingdoms. Of course, they weren’t good enough to defeat a ranker like Hong An one-on-one, but the number of knights was close to 30. 

“Kuek...!” 

Hong An’s expression gradually distorted as he received the knights’ pincer attacks. He felt that the battle wasn’t going as it should. He utilized the racial special quality of an orc and condensed power in his huge hand that was like a pot lid, swinging it. However, he was blocked by a shield. 

He blocked a spear that protruded from between the interlocking shields with his shoulder and grabbed one of the knights by the neck while shouting at his companions, “What are you all doing not helping? Their level is high, but if we work together, we can break through in an instant...” 

“What does it mean by you conspiring with Rose?” 

“I was honestly a bit puzzled when you suddenly gathered people to go to hell. Were you going to sacrifice us to the great demon?” 

The orcs were cautious. They doubted things and didn’t help Hong An. In the first place, they didn’t have a deep relationship with Hong An. The famous Hong An suddenly posted on the community to recruit party members and they joined. 

Hong An sighed. “I didn’t expect you to take this crazy guy’s nonsense seriously. This is a trap and oppression. Lauel is trying to stop our Chinese people from uniting...” 

“I’m not trying to incite the people here. There is no way that the Overgeared Guild would make enemies for such a ridiculous reason.” 

“...Tsk.” Hong An’s eyes changed. He was filled with killing intent as he broke the neck of the knight he was holding. 

Stopping the Breath—it was one of Hong An’s ultimate skills. It instantly killed non-named targets with force. Of course, it was a skill that could only be activated on the premise that the target was held by the neck, but it was excellent for controlling the situation. 

“Lauel’s unfounded instigation is ridiculous but it won’t work if the target isn’t agitated. It’s fine. I don’t need anything. I will break through alone...?” 

Hong An’s expression stiffened. The knight whose neck he had just broken and he had thrown away—the one who should’ve died and turned to gray ash was slowly getting up. It was a very bizarre sight. 

Lauel told the flustered Hong An, “The knights of the empire aren’t dull enough to be caught by an orc.” 

“......?” 

What was he saying? So this guy wasn’t a knight of the empire? 

Hong An’s eyes widened as he was feeling bewildered. The knight who was immune to instant death and completely got up before he knew it. It was because a purple glow flashed between the crooked helmet. 

“A death knight?” 

“That’s right. My escort force has become a bit more diverse.” 

“Hah, what are you going to do with an undead?” 

The undead were vulnerable against physical attacks. They were easily destroyed. After all, Hong An was an orc. He was an orc warrior who completed the fifth class advancement. The fists and club he wielded were so powerful that they were excellent against the undead. It had to be so. Compatibility was that important. However... 

‘What? This guy?’ 

The death knight standing in Hong An’s way was incredibly powerful. It used advanced swordsmanship to block all of Hong An’s attacks. Above all, it was calm. Unlike the ordinary undead, which clung to a target until the target was dead, it slowly and calmly pushed Hong An. It was a relaxed, hunter-like attitude. 

Hong An felt extremely uncomfortable and noticed one step late. 

“I see. This is... an Overgeared Skeleton. Grid must really like you, Lauel, to send such a precious power as your escort.” 

“No.” 

“”Don’t call God’s name so recklessly.”” 

“......!” 

Hong An was stunned. It was because the death knight suddenly became reanimated and the speed at which it flashed in was like a flash of light. It was an executive of the No Offspring Tomb with the modifiers of ‘Thick, Big, Speedy, and Powerful.’ 

The Specter’s death knight started to rapidly push Hong An. Unlike ordinary undead, the gesture of counterattacking by deflecting the destructive power contained in the club wielded by Hong An was elegant. It was an overwhelming sight. Who would’ve imagined that there was a death knight who would dominate Hong An, who had a three digit overall ranking? 

Lauel explained to the speechless orcs, “The Overgeared Shadow team captured the scene where Rose’s minions met with some rankers. You are free to believe it or not, but I guarantee that Hong An was going to sacrifice you. Looking at his past actions, he is a very bad person. He came from a dark gamer background and is one of the worst dark gamers. I recommend that you don’t meet him again.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“......” 

The orcs didn’t refute it. They didn’t have enough loyalty to defend Hong An by refuting it and in this atmosphere, wouldn’t they also be beaten up if they refuted it? They watched in silence as Hong An was overpowered by the knights’ cooperation as he was fighting the death knight.
