Chapter 1955

[Content and System Expansion]

1. Humanity has been subdivided into categories.

Players and NPCs are classified as mortals, regardless of their occupation or level. They can become warriors, true people, superhumans, great people, or saints by accumulating certain achievements or experiences.

<>

2. A treasure system has been added.

All players can craft and use treasures.

However, the probability of success in crafting varies depending on the value of the treasure. The more times you attempt to craft the same treasure, the more likely you are to succeed.

There are 37,098 types of treasure blueprints available by default. There are hidden designs all over the world. New designs are sometimes created through acquired methods.

The materials needed for the treasure crafting can be obtained through various means, such as hunting, gathering, farming, and clearing quests.

<>

3. The pet system has been changed.

A number of new taming methods have been added. In the future, all monsters and beasts can be taming targets.

The amount of Domination stat required when dealing with pets has been greatly reduced.

<>

4. Looting and erosion systems have been added.

Outsiders will threaten players. They are known for plundering natural resources and the treasures of others, but their appearance isn’t that different from humans. They are also quick learners. Be careful not to be deceived by them, or you might lose your treasures and home.

[System Improvements]

1. The five senses restriction and speed limit applied to players will be removed.

2. Many opportunities to learn new skills will be added.

3. There is a significant increase in hunting and harvesting efficiency.

4. Various formations will be added to increase the efficiency of the party system.

5. The time scale between reality and Satisfy is adjusted to a ratio of 1:8.

You must advance to the minimum rank of a true person to activate this system.

However, this is only if you agree to the terms and conditions that you will be responsible for any side effects, such as a sense of disconnection and fatigue caused by the time difference between reality and Satisfy.

……

…

Satisfy’s first update generated an abundance of repercussions. The majority of responses were positive because of the user-friendly intentions.

“Looking at the treasure list, there seem to be a lot of weapons and defensive gear, but there are no restrictions on use? Even if existing items are obtained with great difficulty, there are many cases in which their restrictions prevent them from being used.”

“Instead, I’m worried that resources are consumed every time a treasure is used. The stronger the treasure, the greater the resource consumption... Would it be used as a special move?”

“Most of the treasures are consumables! Many of them seem to be medicine? A lot of consumables have permanent effects, just like elixirs. Foraging will be very important in the future. It will be crowded with foragers on the mountains near towns.”

“You can use the search function to find materials for treasures? I’ll have to keep an eye out on my surroundings whenever I’m traveling, then.”

Everyone talked about the update, both in real life and online. In particular, the fact that one hour in real life equaled eight hours in game attracted a lot of attention. The existing time adjustment was already extremely efficient when people took breaks during work or study, and this situation would only improve in the future.

There were many people who vowed to become a true person just to take advantage of this time ratio. Experts from every domain expressed doubts and concerns, stating that they didn’t know how such a thing was possible. However, it was none of their business.

Even those who had stayed away from Satisfy for personal reasons had become interested in the game all of a sudden. The production of capsules couldn’t keep up with the demand.

One faction kept being brought up frequently.

“The only victim of this update is the Overgeared Guild.”

“They can afford to lose some profit. Grid and the Overgeared members helped us a lot, but... Honestly, I’m sick of them.”

For a while now, Legendary items were no longer the exclusive property of Overgeared members. Since Grid insisted that all players should have a chance to flourish, the empire had been releasing high-ranking items into the market for some time now. As more players entered the top hunting groups, the levels of dropped items also increased.

However, top-tier items such as dragon weapons were still monopolized by the Overgeared Guild. Some of the treasures hinted by the update seemed to be as powerful as dragon weapons. Detailed descriptions hadn’t been released just yet, but the brief summaries were unusual. Anyone who had the required materials could craft them, so the gap between the Overgeared members and ordinary players would gradually shrink. Of course, it wouldn’t be easy to obtain the materials. Most people would be frustrated by the possibility of failing, but...

The theory was that the number of players was so high that the speed of releasing high-ranking treasures would be faster than expected. The Overgeared Guild had even monopolized warp gates. People had to pay a hefty fee to use them, mostly because the cost of construction was astronomical, since it required many magic stones in order to be activated.

That was what the Overgeared Guild said, at least. The users had always been dissatisfied with the high usage fee and the inconvenient accessibility. Now, they could use the gates anywhere at a low price.

People were happy with this update. A small number of people who regarded the misfortune of others as happiness started ridiculing the Overgeared Guild. But this happiness only lasted two days. After that, people became frustrated, because Valhalla had designated the mountains, mines, lakes, rivers, and sea areas within their kingdom as prohibited. Those areas were home to all types of herbs, trees, fruits, minerals, gems, rare animals, and monsters.

This aspect in particular thwarted every single player’s plan to rush into the mountains and seas after finding out about the foraging update. To add insult to injury, other guilds also set up controlled areas within their territories!

People were becoming anxious. What if the Overgeared Guild did the same? Everything would spiral out of control. The Overgeared Guild occupied nearly two-thirds of the continent!

A few days passed. Finally, on the day of the update, the silent Overgeared Guild made an announcement. They would not impose any type of control within their territories. In addition, some previously controlled mines and raid areas would be released every other week.

At this point, even those who complained about the Overgeared Guild started to feel remorse. The factions which had been issuing kill commands with the intention of confronting the Overgeared Guild lost their support and dispersed like dust.

***

Initially, when they first caught wind of the existence of the update, The Overgeared Guild had planned to place bans like Valhalla. They possessed so much land that it wasn’t necessary to prohibit all areas. Their plan was to monopolize some of the really valuable land.

The damage would be serious if they didn’t come out on top of it immediately after the update, but they soon realized that they didn’t have to do this.

The Skunk expedition team knew exactly where precious materials and resources could be found. They set out alongside tens of thousands of the empire’s elite soldiers, scattering all over the continent and sweeping all the important resources. The materials they brought back were transplanted to the field made by Piaro. Piaro’s direct disciples (farmers) dedicated their time to cultivation.

The seedlings that were transplanted grew quickly, their number increasing from a few dozens to hundreds of thousands. Herbs that were only decades old were reborn as herbs that were hundreds of years old in just a few days. Piaro’s enlightenment from growing the golden walnuts played a huge role. Even Braham was extremely surprised at the sight.

“You are the best of the apostles.”

Braham even handed over the title of number one apostle to Piaro. He seemed to have his own standards and submitted to Piaro. Piaro took it half as a joke, but he smiled widely for the first time in ages. He felt a great sense of pride as a farmer.

Eat Spicy Jokbal was also a huge help to the Overgeared Guild. His ability to produce dungeons that were able to one day reach heaven was at a remarkable level. The Guild could build several mines as long as they had enough resources. Of course, the amount of resources needed were astronomical.

For example, the construction of a mithril mine required at least ten million tons of mithril. This created an environment where even mithril could grow in the mine.

The Overgeared Guild also had mountains of minerals, since they had a habit of mining them for Grid, so they had accumulated a lot of them over time. The empire alone had tens of thousands of mines, so that was only natural. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lauel grinned.

‘There is nothing to lose from the warp gates.’

Warp gates were installed in existing towns and cities. A portion of the gate fee paid by players was settled as tax revenue to the lords. The number of lords under the Overgeared Empire alone was in the thousands. This meant that the revenue generated from the new warp gates would go directly into the empire’s pockets.

In addition, unlike the warp gates made by Sticks, the profit margin was expected to be a lot higher, since they didn’t need to use magic stones when activating the gate. Instead, there was the disadvantage of limited available coordinates. But this was irrelevant to the Overgeared Guild, who originally had dozens of warp gates.

“For those on this list, please lead the battleships to sea as soon as the update is complete. By steadily securing large quantities of monster cores and seabed resources, we will be able to collect most of the materials that exist in the world. My goal is to focus on producing elixirs and improving training first...”

“Elizabeth, we will provide you with sufficient manpower, so please pour your heart and soul into the creation of new treasure designs. Those on this list will comb the territories shown on the map to search for outsiders and prepare for erosion...”

Lauel and the Overgeared members gathered together to exchange ideas and make plans. Meanwhile, Grid was solely focused on body manufacturing in the smithy.

A few days later, Satisfy finally updated.

Lauel logged into the game half a day after the maintenance and couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Piaro’s herb garden was in turmoil.

“The herbs grew feet and ran away?”

“Yes! Most of them were caught, but some of them were too fast and displayed some strange magic. It was difficult for the knights to catch them.”

“What...?”

The bewildered Lauel hurried out of his office.
