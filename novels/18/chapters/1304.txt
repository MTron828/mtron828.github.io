“......”

Sword Saint Biban had denied the sword dances. He evaluated that a sword dance based on a particular ritual, not combat, couldn’t be better than swordsmanship. Wouldn’t this change his mind?

Grid’s heart started beating faster as he demonstrated the new sword dance toward empty air. As Grid grew, his developed Grid’s Swordsmanship gained a form comparable to any swordsmanship. It was while keeping the essence of the sword dances.

‘One day, it will be like the Undefeated King’s swordsmanship...’

It would be a sword dance that no one could touch. Grid smiled as he confirmed that creating the five fusion sword dances was possible.

Jingle.

“There were many things lacking so it filled in more spaces.” Chiyou’s voice was heard along with the sound of bells, but it gradually faded. “Your potential is great because you haven’t hid or turned away from your own shortcomings.”

Jingle...

The vision of Grid and the grandmaster’s group dimmed. The reason they visited the Hwan Kingdom was to meet with the Five Seniors and their business was over. Chiyou had no intention of holding onto the guests.

‘It is difficult because the Five Seniors are greedy.’

***

“......”

At the huge peach tree forest...

Zibal returned to the human world and looked up at the sky blankly. ‘We were there just a moment ago...’

The heavens high in the sky. It was the place where the gods worshipped by countless humans lived. There, Zibal had been constantly overwhelmed. He watched the conversation between the gods like an unnamed extra. He thought it was natural. What type of influence could a player exert at a gathering of the world’s protagonists?

Zibal considered it a great benefit and blessing just witnessing an episode that was central to the worldview. He believed that the information obtained today would serve as the foundation for an important quest that would occur in the future and was satisfied.

On the other hand, that woman... no, Grid, was different. He was a protagonist even in the world of the gods. It meant that the quality and quantity of the episodes that Grid had intervened in far exceeded Zibal’s level.

’I still have a long way to go. It is really far away.’

Imperial Prince Edan and Grandmaster Zikfrector—Zibal had also served as a leading role in large-scale episodes. The amount of information and influence that an average player obtained by experiencing and clearing difficult quests and episodes were truly powerful. He was confident that he was comparable to Grid in terms of being able to intervene in a story. However, this wasn’t the case at all. The gap with Grid was larger than expected.

‘...I have a reason to try harder.’

A smile spread on Zibal’s face. He was one of the best rankers who burned with more motivation in the face of frustration.

Grid woke up from the aftermath of the events and asked Zibal, “By the way, how did you figure out who I am?”

“Isn’t it natural to notice?

“Is it natural? Even Hanul didn’t figure out my original identity...”

“It isn’t that he didn’t know,” the grandmaster interjected. He had returned to his usual relaxed form and seemed to find it bothersome to talk for long. “He just didn’t feel the need to make the distinction because it is trivial to know who you are. From Hanul’s point of view, it doesn’t matter if you are Grid or someone else. You are still the same human being.”

“......”

“Well... it will be different after Chiyou’s Test.”

The grandmaster eventually sat down. He fell asleep and the Neo Red Knights seemed familiar with this situation as they supported him and leaned him against a tree.

Zibal scratched his head with a sad expression and suggested to Grid, “We are going back to the West Continent. We have found a passage that can move freely between continents that other people haven’t discovered yet. It is very important information, but... do you want to come with us?"

It was referring to the Abyss. Intercontinental movement through the Abyss was fast and convenient compared to other previous known methods of movement. There was a disadvantage that it was full of dungeon boss monsters, but it could be tolerated if they thought about how it was part of their growth.

Grid shook his head. “No, thank you, but it isn’t needed.”

Zibal’s intentions were clearly visible. He wanted an item in exchange for information. Grid had realized that Zibal was a decent person from the time of Edan’s rebellion and he thought it was okay to sell one item to Zibal, but it was still premature.

‘He needs to increase his favorable impression if he wants to pay for it.’

“Eh? Y-Yes...”

Grid refused this type of high level information? Zibal was flustered by Grid’s refusal. He didn’t know who easily Grid could move between continents. The gap between the two of them was much larger than Zibal thought.

‘Was Piaro successful?’

After saying goodbye to the grandmaster’s group, Grid activated Transcend and freely used Shunpo to travel to Xing. He was still a bit confused that he had gone through so much on the East Continent when he had only come to gain the white phosphorus wood and learn how to grow the golden walnuts.
