Chapter 1845

The Breath contained Bunhelier’s magic power and shook Baal’s body.

“Ohhhhhhh!!”

Grid responded with Serve Dragon Pinnacle Wave Kill Link.

Jingle.

The sound of Chiyou’s bell was a precursor. Ultimate Martial Art was activated and caused Baal to reel again.

Bunhelier’s body slammed into Baal. Bunhelier, who had been holding his breath in the form of a mouse and succeeded in a surprise attack, had no intention of missing this opportunity. It was the same for Grid.

Giant Transformation—the transformation skill usually used by plant-type bosses had two clear advantages. The first was that their stats increased, and the second was that they didn’t get knocked down easily. Due to the increase in mass itself, they demonstrated a constitution that was immune to serious injuries. In particular, Baal had become so huge that he treated it as being stabbed by a toothpick even if he was pierced by a sword.

[Hurry! Pour it all out!]

Bunhelier’s will was conveyed to Grid. Perhaps it was because of the effect of Dragon Knight. Grid and Bunhelier communicated in real time. They read each other’s will as if it was their own and responded to each other.

Grid was already moving. God's Command and other abilities reset the cooldown of his skills, so he linked the six fusion sword dance again.

[The target has received 24,469,055,100 damage.] [1]

[You have broken the record for the highest damage dealt to a single being in the world!]

[Someone imprisoned in heaven’s prison has noticed your amazing achievement and is clicking his tongue.]

[”At this point, even Dominion and Judar will be taking notice...”]

Fortunately for Grid, Baal’s Giant Transformation only seemed to have half the advantages. It felt like his defense had become weaker. The damage was inflicted really well. Of course, it had to be taken into account that the combination of Defying the Natural Order and Twilight was creating a tremendous synergy. The additional damage effect against great demons meant the damage had tripled. Additionally, the weak point attacks and critical hits were the basics.

It naturally neutralized the strength of Giant Transformation.

‘Even taking that into account, the damage was dealt very well.’

What was the reason? Grid found it easy to guess. Originally, Baal’s strength lay in the chaining of the skills he learned from the dead. Thanks to these skills, he was able to deal more damage to Grid, while offsetting some of Grid’s attack power.

However, the giant form Baal didn’t use any special skills. Maybe it was hard to use human skills with that huge body?

Grid thought this and stopped the sword dances he had been linking without a break. This was because all the means to remove the cooldown of the sword dances had been exhausted. It was a pity that this wasn’t the Overgeared World.

He was in awe of Baal, who was still alive.

Kuaaaaaaaah!

The suspension of the six fusion sword dance also meant that the shackles of Ultimate Martial Art were lifted. Baal regained his freedom and roared like a monster in a movie. It wasn’t like he lost his sense of reason and behaved like a beast. He was just a bit excited from becoming huge.

Baal didn’t run amok. The first thing he did was to dispose of Bunhelier. He grabbed Bunhelier by the neck with his huge hand and immediately cast the curse magic.

“Groan...” Bunhelier was weak in hell. In terms of simply magic power and physical ability, he was halfway between the intermediate dragons and top dragons. It was very humiliating for Bunhelier, but what could he do? He was suffering the consequences of his own actions. He was paying for the sin of joining forces with a demon and harming his own kind. Nevertheless, from the perspective of Grid, there was a fortunate outcome.

“Let go!”

It was that Bunhelier’s status was completely preserved.

The status of an Old Dragon—it wasn’t a concept that could be dismissed recklessly. Just as Nevartan was still feared despite wandering in madness for hundreds of years, Bunhelier was still an Old Dragon. The fact that he fell into a demon’s trap and was tricked, or that he turned into a mouse to survive, didn’t undermine his value.

The effect of Dragon Knight was intact.

Grid fired an onslaught at Baal, who was about to rip Bunhelier’s head off. He deployed Request to Stand With Me and sniped at Baal’s huge hand. It was very powerful with the Dragon Knight effect.

Baal was unable to cope with the power and let go of his hand. Thanks to this, Bunhelier was able to breathe. However, a curse spell was falling from the sky.

“Again... I will come back again.”

Bunhelier didn’t wait for a reply from Grid. He immediately turned into a mouse and fled the scene. Thanks to this, the curse magic struck Grid, who was left alone in the air.

[You have suffered 1,333,333 damage.]

[The bondage of powerful magic oppresses you.]

[You have resisted.]

‘Damn.’

In a sudden turn of events, Grid was struck and he spontaneously let out a curse. In the first place, it was a bondage aimed at Bunhelier. He resisted, but the damage was quite painful. It was quite burdensome in a situation where he lost his health every time Baal swung an arm or roared, and it was like he received damage over time.

[Resent your judgment for cooperating with that guy.]

Could it be that he transformed into something smaller than a monster?

...Really?

Baal was momentarily taken aback by the sudden disappearance of Bunhelier before his eyes, only to smirk. He was quite satisfied with Grid’s bloody appearance. He was very relaxed for a guy who had suffered a lot of damage in a row and even showed ugly screams.

Grid belatedly noticed one thing.

‘Isn’t he going to die?’

Baal, in his humanoid form—he couldn’t last long against the merged Defying the Natural Order and Twilight, and suffered several deaths. However, the one who became a giant didn’t die despite suffering more damage than when he was a humanoid. It was even after being hit by the six fusion sword dance a whopping nine times in a row.

‘What happened?’

After becoming a giant, his health gauge itself had disappeared, so it was hard to grasp the situation. Well, it didn’t disappear, to be precise, but it was difficult to identify.

Baal’s head was located so high up. The health gauge that floated above it—it was physically impossible to discern the gauge at close range when it would be infinitely smaller than Baal’s head.

‘It is inconvenient in many ways because I can’t use Shunpo.’

Grid’s vision turned black as he clicked his tongue. It was because the magic power Baal released from his mouth attacked him.

A tidal wave seemed to be coming. The earth and sky were turbulent and further disturbed Grid’s view.

‘No.’

Grid was about to rally the God Hands to block it, but he changed his mind midway. He was conscious of Baal’s hand, which was chasing behind the tidal wave. He feared that he would be caught by Baal’s mighty hand and unable to move the moment he wrapped himself in the sun sphere made from the God Hands.

‘I have to find a way to kill him one more time.’

Grid thought while flying at full power and distancing himself from Baal. He wanted to level up...

It would become easier to fight if his stats increased. But...

“Keuk!”

The tide was turning rapidly.

Baal’s exhaled breath and every hand wave all put pressure on Grid.

Baal was a tricky opponent in many ways after he returned to his primal form. For one thing, it neutralized many of Grid’s strengths just because it was so huge.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The epic described such a situation. Grid was obviously in a crisis. It recorded it without turning a blind eye because it was a situation where Grid might die. What if it tried to hide it and Grid died? There was a concern that the epic would be treated as a distorted scripture, rather than one that contained only the truth.

All the records so far could be discredited, and Grid’s status could decline. However...

[Humanity’s fear has faded.]

People didn’t lose faith at Grid’s crisis. They weren’t frightened even after checking the contents of the epic that depicted Baal as a giant. They still trusted Grid. It was natural. Grid had shown them so many things. People gathered all over the world shouted that Grid would overcome even this new disaster. He would challenge again even if he failed without overcoming the crisis.

There was a being who responded to their beliefs.

“Gridddddd!”

It was Nefelina.

“Gasp! Gasp! Damn! This X-ing thing? What the hell is this? Why is it so big?”

Zibal’s curses echoed from the loudspeakers as he followed her on Raiders.

The entrance to Baal’s city where Jishuka and Zik’s party had been fighting—Nefelina and Zibal, who had been watching the battlefield from afar, rushed toward this place from the very beginning. Thanks to this, they were able to arrive in time.

“Nefelina!”

Grid suffered heavy damage again in the aftermath of blocking Baal’s fist and he used the recoil of the impact. He didn’t resist and flew obediently, quickly narrowing the distance to Nefelina.

[...Transcendent Dragon.]

Baal didn’t treat the daughter of the Insane Dragon as a mere hatchling. He was aware that she had inherited her father’s talents and could temporarily transcend her limits. Thus, he was wary of her.

A beam of black magic power was fired from his wide-open mouth. In the aftermath of his body becoming huge, the size of the light beam was also tremendously large. In terms of size, it was bigger than an Old Dragon’s Breath. It was a skill effect that could seem like the strongest skill ever.

Viewers thought it wouldn’t be strange if Grid and Nefelina perished side by side as they were swept up in it together.

It was a damn thing. They had been watching the show for hours and cheering eagerly, so they couldn’t believe that this was the result.

The 1st Great Demon, Baal—as expected of a final boss candidate, he was strong. It was clear that he was a mountain that couldn’t be climbed yet.

The moment everyone thought this—

“Kyak!” Nefelina screamed.

The huge, fast-moving beam of magic—it was inevitable and she didn’t avoid it. She was obliged to put the flying Grid on her back, so she flew with her back to the ray. Thus, a barrier of magic was raised. It was to stop the advance of the light ray for a while and to allow Grid to safely get on her back.

However, the barrier of magic collapsed in a disastrous manner. The structure of the defensive magic, which had been carefully designed by a master of magic, couldn’t withstand the ignorant strength of the powerful beam. She was going to be swept away. Even if she survived, she would fail to allow Grid to board her back.

It was the moment when Nefelina, overwhelmed by the rapidly approaching light, felt it…

A silver magic machine fell in front of her and blocked the ray. No, it was too horrible a sight to describe as blocking it. It broke and turned into ashes the moment it touched the light.

Zibal, who was riding on it, appeared. He looked determined even after losing a colleague who had been with him for a long time. He smiled as he used a skill with the dragon weapon he received from Grid and reduced the power of the beam, which was still powerful even after turning Raiders into ashes. It was the smile of a man who was an idol to American boys and girls.

“A hero doesn’t turn away from a child.”

Nefelina—it was the second time since she was born that she realized that the backs of people who were much smaller than herself could look so big.

“Zibal...!” Nefelina’s cry didn’t reach him. Zibal’s hearing was completely ruined after being swallowed up by the remnants of the beam. He was just holding on with his dragon armor and struggling to fully handle the power of the beam of light. The beam was caught by Zibal’s skill and exploded without penetrating Zibal. Through the thick smoke that spread—

“I won’t forgive you!”

Nefelina showed up. Her wings were spread wide out as she charged toward Baal. It was a disappointing appearance. It was the limit of a hatchling. The not fully grown dragon was more than a dozen times smaller than Baal.

However, Grid was standing on her back. The god of the surface who scattered orange divinity from his body like a cloak or long hair—he was raising Nefelina’s presence to a great extent.

Still, Baal wasn’t shaken. The people also didn’t have any big hopes.

It was a little while ago. Grid rode on the back of an Old Dragon and couldn’t do anything against Baal. Being with a hatchling wouldn’t be enough for him to win...

Grid thought differently. “Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.”

The five fusion sword dances.

Linked Kill Flower Pinnacle Drop.

Drop Dragon Pinnacle Kill Wave.

Revolve Dragon Drop Pinnacle Kill.

Linked Kill Revolve Pinnacle Chop.

They were the ultimate skills Grid had been using all along until he got the six fusion sword dances. It could be called his fundamentals. He killed far more enemies with the five fusion sword dances than the six fusion sword dances. It was the same for the four fusion sword dances, three fusion sword dances, and two fusion sword dances.

That’s right—in a situation where the six fusion sword dances were blocked, Grid returned to his roots.

‘It will be okay. It is going to work.’

Grid noted two facts. Baal hadn’t used any special skills since he became huge. Additionally, he took more damage every time he allowed Grid’s attack.

‘The Giant Transformation pays a huge price.’

Originally, Baal had honed his body to resist the power of the dragon weapons. Then after Baal became a giant, Grid broke his highest damage record several times despite Baal’s trained body. It could be interpreted that his body itself had changed again.

The energy of a God Killer, the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship, etcetera—the fact that he didn’t use any of the skills he acquired also supported this. In other words...

[Kuaaack!]

The giant Baal lost even his immunity to the sword dances.

His primal form—he, too, had returned to his roots. From now on, it was a clash of the fundamentals against the fundamentals. There was an obvious difference.

Baal’s fundamentals was to wield his innate power.

Grid’s fundamentals was to utilize the skills he had honed.

It was because Grid was born as an ordinary guy with nothing. His fundamentals were polished by himself. Additionally, Nefelina’s small body worked to her advantage. She flew around and around between Baal’s legs, and Grid stabbed at his gaps.

Grid’s linked fusion sword dances easily slashed Baal’s legs. Baal’s body slowly started to tilt.

At this time, Grid noticed a new fact. The super fast regeneration—the fraudulent power that had restored Baal’s wounds almost immediately wasn’t working.

This wasn’t the aftermath of Giant Transformation. The super fast regeneration wasn’t a power taken from the dead, but Baal’s own power. However, it was weakened. It was a phenomenon that showed that the power of regeneration had been using people’s fear as a resource. Only this interpretation could explain why Baal’s recovery was so significantly slower.

‘Baal isn’t someone who can’t die.’

He was just in a position where he couldn’t die. He was desperately resisting death...

The appearance projected by Baal in Grid’s eyes was not that of a giant, but a sand castle.

1. Seems to be an author error since the damage in the previous chapter was higher. Korean comments have noticed this as well. I will keep an eye on the raws to see if the author/publisher fixes it ☜
