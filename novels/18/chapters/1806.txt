Chapter 1806

“Let’s look at your mental world.” 

The words carried a faint pitch. It represented Grid’s excitement. 

From Braham to Zik—Grid succeeded in making exclusive weapons for the apostles one after another and felt great joy. He almost thought that his rewards for all the hardships he experienced so far had come at once. The probability of succeeding with Intent Production was too small. 

In fact, Grid didn’t have high expectations at first. 

An item that was made through the unity of the apostle’s mental world—the possibilities that Braham presented and put into practice were indeed ideal, but it was difficult to achieve in reality. 

First of all, the apostle had to have a mental world. The mental world also needed to be unified with Grid’s mental world. It was because the prerequisites were too demanding. 

Fortunately, they succeeded in succession. He just hoped it would continue like this. 

“Would you like to see my mental world?” 

Grid stiffened instantly at the voice. The Mir who was wearing a faceplate that didn’t suit him was very disturbing. Wasn’t it like he heard from someone that Grid hit the young Zik in the face and he came up with his own countermeasures? It was a scene that anyone would misunderstand as an evil god recklessly assaulting his apostles. 

‘Mir’s ears are thin, but Zik’s mouth is surprisingly light.’ 

It was after putting the mental world in the sword. Zik faced the memories that he had sealed in his mental world. It was right to say that he was in a state where his mental world was always open. He remembered what he went through as the young Zik and spread rumors... 

It happened as Grid was feeling some disappointment... 

Mir slipped off the thick armor and said with a calm expression, “Lord Braham said that God would be pleased if you saw me wearing this... I seem to have been deceived.” 

“......”

Grid suddenly remembered something. It was the fact that Braham’s expression distorted and was almost rotten as he checked the sword that Grid made with Zik. He was clearly displeased. 

‘I often don’t understand this old man.’ 

He could understand how Braham felt. He probably didn’t like that other apostles were benefiting from the method he devised. He felt deprived. 

‘I understand, but... if he is going to pout over something like that, why did he take the risk of ascending to heaven?’ 

It was a big help when he obtained Raphael’s wings for Sariel... he was an old man who was hard to understand. 

Grid shook his head and sat down on a rock. The place where Mir lived was as shabby as an old monk practicing ‘not having unnecessary things.’ There were no particular household items and a large rock carved by a sword replaced a chair. 

“I apologize for Braham.” 

“I deeply apologize for inadvertently offending you, God. About the mental world you requested… my mental world might be offensive to you, God.” 

“...That won’t happen.” 

Grid suppressed the question of why and reassured Mir. There was no reason to think in advance about the mental world he would have to face anyway. No matter what form Mir’s mental world took, Grid wouldn’t be offended or disappointed. 

After all, the mental world was from the subconscious. Too many factors intervened in the formation of the subconscious mind. The dark side of everyone was naturally expressed. If he was going to be disappointed by every one of them, he wouldn’t have given a notice to his precious friends to create a mental world. 

‘I’m used to the dark side of people.’ 

Clean people were rare. There were even fewer people who didn’t have wounds. Grid himself had it and so did all the protagonists of the relationships Grid had made so far. It was right for Grid to understand and embrace all the things that were present in their mental world, not to hate and ignore them. 

“If so, I will gladly...” 

They were very deep and warm eyes. The reason why Mir felt so happy since becoming Grid’s apostle was the look in Grid’s eyes when looking at him. It was as if Grid understood everything and believed it unconditionally. Grid’s eyes were as kind as ever. It reminded him of parents taking off their clothes for their children in a city covered in snow due to the Blue Dragon’s fury. 

That’s right. To Mir, Grid felt like a parent. From the perspective of Mir, who was made to be a tool from the beginning, Grid stirred up emotions he believed he would never feel. There were omens when a mental world was opened. 

The precursor of Grid’s mental world was a calm but hot heat, the precursor of Zik’s mental world was the sobbing of a child, the precursor of Braham’s mental world was the perception of blueness created by the whirlpool of magic power, etc. 

Mir’s mental world was opened through self-harm. By inserting a blade into his heart, Mir opened up his own space that was cut off from the world. 

[You have entered Mir’s mental world, ‘Broken Mainspring’.] 

Click, click, click...  

The scene in front of Grid’s eyes was really unexpected. It was the inside of a huge machine. Tens of thousands of mainsprings and gears were interlocked and turning. 

A yangban who stuck to old-fashioned clothes and way of speaking had such a mental world. It didn’t suit him at all. 

“......”

Grid noticed something jarring. Not all the gears were properly interlocked. Each of them acted independently, twisting and creaking. The shape of their teeth was as different as their color, so they couldn’t fit together at all. 

“It was in a city covered in snow and deserted by the inhabitants.” 

Mir emerged from the large mainsprings and spoke. He stood on the small  gears as a stepping stone and his body rotated slowly. Nevertheless, his dopo didn’t fly and he stood as straight as a blade. This was the ability to control his body as well as his clothes and was commonly referred to as ‘qi.’ 

“I thought the bells of the grandfather clock that ring every hour even though no one is listening was particularly pitiful. It seemed to be unaware it was abandoned and still responded to the wishes of its maker. It was just like seeing us in the future.” 

The yangbans were just tools created to accomplish Hanul’s purpose. Most yangbans tried to deny it or to not realize this fact, but Mir didn’t turn a blind eye to reality. He knew that if he was broken in the process of achieving Hanul’s purpose, he would be abandoned. Additionally, once Hanul achieved his purpose, then Mir would become useless and would be abandoned. The grandfather clock left alone reminded him of it again. 

Therefore, he was even more eager. He would cut down the Martial God and change his fate. Of course, he knew it was a long shot, so he built this desperate mental world. 

The small sparrows that came every morning to eat the seeds on the snow-covered outdoor terrace weren’t saved by Mir. Instead, the sparrows saved Mir. They made him realize that he could exist for something other than the gods. Without the sparrows, Mir’s mental world would be even more horribly ruined than it was now. 

‘...Did he think of himself as a tool that is broken or is bound to break?’ 

Grid’s chest felt heavy as he vaguely fathomed Mir’s position. He was so frustrated that he almost exploded. He came to despise the gods of the Hwan Kingdom, who made the yangbans only for themselves. 

‘I’m glad I didn’t make ego items.’ 

If he made an item like Talsha with his own hands, he would’ve felt like Hanul.  

Grid suddenly had a scary thought and shook his head to shake off his thoughts. As always, he could only say one thing. 

“Believe in me. Everything will change when you are with me.” 

“Can you fix me when I am so broken?” 

“You aren’t an object. What do you mean by fix you? It isn’t about fixing you, it is about changing.” 

Mir had always considered himself a tool. 

Grid gave a poignant and accurate piece of advice and continued. “You need to face yourself fully in order to change.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Grid activated Intent Production. 

“Let’s put this place into the sword I am going to make now. This way, you can watch every moment until the broken mainsprings and gears are fitted together and working properly. Who knows? Once they fit together and work properly, they might be completely independent of you.” 

At that time, he could fill in the new mental world that he wanted... 

Grid was worried about whether his intentions would be properly conveyed since he wasn’t good at talking. Contrary to his worries, it was delivered properly. The small smile that spread across Mir’s face was evidence. 

“Yes.” 

Ttaaang! 

The answer was a signal. 

Grid hammered Trauka’s bones. The broken mainsprings followed Mir’s will and responded as much as possible. Most of the movements were mixed, but some clearly helped Grid. They fit right with Trauka’s scales and bones, creating a tremendous sense of unity. 

It felt like Trauka’s arm was being restored to its original form. 

Grid was excited and his hammering accelerated. The form of the sword that was soon completed was something that even Grid had never seen before. 

[One]

★ It is possible to replace ‘Fire Dragon Trauka’s Arm.’ 

A sword created by Only One God Grid in a state of mental world unity with Apostle Mir. 

Mir’s mental world—inthe form of mainsprings and gears—has completely bound together the bones and scales of Fire Dragon Trauka. This means that while the form is judged to be a sword, it is equal to Trauka’s arm. 

Fire Dragon Trauka will be very interested in it. He will consider anyone who damages this sword as a challenge to him. 

Conditions of Use: Mir, Grid. 

Weight: 16,000] 

“...Hah.” 

Grid was reminded in many ways about when he made Ifrit’s Horn. He couldn’t help smiling. The true value of One lay in its possibility rather than its power. It was the possibility of a relationship with Trauka. Of course, its power was just as great as the exclusive weapons of the other apostles. 

‘Is it possible that I am really going to take the same side as the Old Dragons?’ 

It wasn’t an unfounded conjecture. It was a possibility following Raiders’ attitude. Above all, the function of Dragon Knight itself gave a lot of room for a relationship with Old Dragons. Grid wanted to think in as positive a manner as possible. 

If the Old Dragons really became allies— 

Maybe he could prevent the bloody apocalypse. There might be a world where his friends and family were safe without him. 

‘I really want to make it like that.’ 

Sometimes he wanted to be free from these scary and troublesome responsibilities... Grid thought up to here only to come to his senses in surprise. Mir was looking at him anxiously. 

“Are you not satisfied with this?” 

“That isn’t it. I was just thinking about something else for a moment,” Grid answered with a bright expression and returned to reality with Mir. 

The mental worlds of Piaro and Mercedes were unlikely to exist, so he planned to climb the Tower of Wisdom after working with Sariel. 

It was as expected. 

“Coincidentally, I still haven’t..."

“Me too...” 

Piaro and Mercedes had yet to create a mental world. However, Mercedes’ reaction was strange. He thought she would be upset, but she was very calm. 

“Mer, you… do you have a mental world?” 

“Hiccup!” 

Mercedes’ face, which was as white as a snowflake, quickly turned red.
