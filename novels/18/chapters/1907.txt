Chapter 1907

The epic was sealed.

Grid passed over it like it was insignificant. It was an event that was within the predicted range. For Grid, who equated Morpheus with the S.A Group, he felt that such an interference was natural. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

‘Looking at the ways of the company, I think it must come from the top.’

Chairman Lim Cheolho—every time Grid accomplished great things, Chairman Lim Cheolho would send a lot of gifts. He also often visited in person to share medicinal wine with Grid's parents...

On the surface, he was pretty broad-minded.

“There is no light. I didn’t expect the influence of the foreign god to reach this place...” Rebecca’s expression stiffened. She seemed to be talking about the epic rewards.

‘If the epic was written properly, would it have received the protection of the light?’

An epic completed with the faith of a God of the Beginning—it was safe to say that it contained content that could turn the world upside down. Naturally, the value of the rewards would be the highest ever. It was sealed, so he couldn’t check it. But...

“It’s okay.” Grid showed a mature appearance. In any case, it had happened and it was something that couldn’t be stopped. Being obsessed with it would just make him feel dirtier.

‘There is a possibility that it will be solved to some extent by borrowing Huroi’s words.’

What if the epic was stopped? The power of the word-of-mouth transmission through people’s stories was also proven through the yeouiju incident this time. It was enough to spread the secret story.

The Goddess told him, “...Blood is flowing from your hands.”

“Hum hum....” Grid coughed in embarrassment while warm light surrounded his fists. His hands, which had been bleeding due to his nails digging in, recovered in an instant. No, it went beyond the level of recovery.

[Your skin and muscles have become stronger.]

[The special stat ‘Physical Tolerance’ has been opened.]

“......?”

Was this... a God of the Beginning?

A special stat was opened just from receiving healing from her. Then how great was the epic's reward...?

The anger that he tried to suppress was about to rise up again...

Grid barely calmed himself down and changed the subject, “As I said earlier, I understand you.”

The struggle to protect the precious world—the Goddess’ past moves resembled Grid’s present. Naturally, he sympathized and understood. He became eager to help her.

“No matter how many times you have destroyed the world... the weight of your crime might be comparable to the size of the universe, but I have no intention of blaming you.”

The Goddess had no choice but to do so. Her goal was to stop Satisfy from opening. He also understood why.

“But... why did you kill Yatan?”

Of course, a god couldn’t die. He was also a God of the Beginning, so he couldn’t have perished. However, Yatan hadn’t been seen for a long time. He didn’t even show his nose when his precious hell was distorted like that. It was safe to say that he must've been put in a condition that was close to death, and it was by none other than the Goddess.

Grid recalled the ending of the Yatan that he had seen in the old hell and asked bluntly, “Wasn’t he the only one who understood you and collaborated with you?”

Why did she have to hurt him?

“Were you afraid of him becoming the second Hanul?”

“Yes.” The Goddess was a very strong being. Despite revealing her sadness, she didn’t waver and responded immediately. She must have a disciplined personality to face the terrible reality without turning away from it. “At some point, he showed signs of it. He said he hated the foreign god, but he questioned whether it was right to go against providence. It was just like Hanul before the war.”

Therefore, she gave him the death penalty. Yatan’s soul was sealed in a temple built at the end of a dimension. The Goddess was protecting Yatan from being contaminated and forgetting himself. This was also the Goddess’ determination. She was determined to bring about the end of the future with her own hands. She was desperate to bear all her sins and pains alone.

“If I don’t give you all my strength to stop the foreign god... will you destroy the world at that time?” Grid’s question followed. It was the core question. After the question that he expected her to answer from the beginning, he connected it to the most important question. He didn’t even give her time to think. It was a conversational technique he learned from watching Lauel and Huroi. “Answer me.”

“...I don’t know.” Therefore, the Goddess revealed her true feelings. She didn’t know.

At the very least, the worst situation was averted. If Rebecca had said yes here, Grid would have needed to reconsider working with her.

“As you know, I have a precious family.”

Of course, Rebecca knew this.

The first father—she had been watching Grid, the first player in the world to bear the fruits of love and faith.

“I have decided to stand by your side in order to make a better world for my wives and children, and their friends and descendants, to live in. You just have to keep that in mind.”

It was a clear threat.

Don’t even think about destroying the world in the future.

The Goddess had doubts.

“If you can’t tolerate the end of the world... wouldn’t it be better for you to cooperate with the foreign god?”

Rebecca hoped for help from Grid. Yet ironically, she didn’t understand why Grid would help her. It was natural. Morpheus’ task was to prevent the apocalypse. It was completely on the side of humanity. Furthermore, Grid was the person who liberated the apostle of the foreign god, the Refractive Dragon. It was advantageous and beneficial for Grid to cooperate with the foreign god. For the sake of the family he wanted to protect, he shouldn’t cooperate with the ‘risk variable’ called Rebecca.

“Then why do you want to hear my prayers?” There was a tremor in her voice. Before he knew it, Rebecca’s eyes were losing their light again. It was stained by the abyss and became the eyes of the dead. She realized that it was realistically impossible to ask for help from Grid and felt despair.

On the other hand, Grid’s eyes were still clear. He had a firm faith. “Didn’t I tell you that I wanted to make a better world to live in?”

There were too many terrible human beings in the world. It was especially the case in this world where players placed a low value on morality and ethics. Even if Grid and the members of the Overgeared Guild took the lead, the effect was only momentary. Additionally, there was a limit to controlling an infinitely growing player using the laws of the Empire. Above all, Grid’s life wasn’t eternal. It was Grid’s belief that the existence of an Absolute who supports NPCs, not players, was essential.

“The world without you will gradually degenerate into a world for players. I don’t want that.”

Of course, Morpheus would also care about the safety of NPCs. NPCs must exist for Satisfy to be maintained. That was why it was trying to correct Rebecca. However, Morpheus’ will was ultimately the will of the S.A Group. They would strive to ensure the freedom of players rather than the human rights of NPCs. Over time, NPCs would become little more than devices or tools for players.

Grid couldn’t just watch that happen. He had too many precious people. He wanted to completely eliminate the possibility of his friends and family being trampled upon by scumbags.

“My hope is that the people born in this world and players can have an equal relationship. I want both sides to respect each other as human beings. I am going to make it common sense. To that end, I will take full advantage of the freedom that the foreign god has given me.”

The freedom guaranteed to the players—it was a privilege that Grid could also enjoy. The S.A Group could never force him as long as collaborating with Rebecca was ‘possible in the worldview.’ Instead, Grid would take advantage of this structure of the worldview to interfere with the Refractive Dragon and Old Dragons...

Grid was already prepared to fight against them.

He said, “But before I do that, I need to do some fact-checking.”

“Go ahead. I will answer with all my heart.”

“It looks like Chiyou and the Old Dragons clashed in the east. Is Chiyou an ally at this point?”

“I think so.”

“Does Chiyou also know that this world is a game?”

“I don’t think so. He only cares about his own death... it is just that his desire to disappear will only urge him to fight against the Old Dragons.”

“......”

The desire to die was something he had from the beginning. Chiyou was just a madman...

Grid made a note in his head and asked the next question, “Why did the Old Dragons bother to attack Chiyou?”

“I think it is judged that Chiyou is holding Hanul captive. Otherwise, it doesn’t explain why Chiyou is standing by Hanul at this point.”

“In other words... the foreign god suspects that Chiyou has reached the same truth as you and harbors resentment, right? The foreign god recognizes Hanul as an ally.”

“Yes.”

“...Why is Chiyou still next to Hanul?”

“I guess there is nowhere to go?”

“......”

Why did it remind him of his school days when he ate alone every day? Grid became sad for some reason and barely managed to escape from his thoughts.

“...The gods of Asgard don’t seem to know the truth of the world. What will happen to your relationship with them in the future?”

The Goddess’ expression grew darker. “I think they are already under the influence of the foreign god. They just faithfully perform the role given by the ‘game setting’ that was created by the foreign god. You can see it by looking at their instincts.”

Suddenly, Grid remembered the words of Yatan, whom he had met in the old hell. He said that the ‘cycle’ of the Goddess was nothing more than an escape. She was more solitary than Grid expected.

“If you tell them the truth, won’t they agree with you?”

“It is dangerous. They won’t understand the notion that they are just characters in a game. Even if they do understand, they won’t accept it. They will just be outraged. There is a concern that the growing confusion will reveal the truth to humanity. I think that is the end in the truest sense.”

Grid thought about it. He thought about how Irene and Lord would react if they found out they were characters in a game.

Such a tragedy... it should never happen.

“......”

Grid closed his eyes and organized his thoughts. Finally, he tried to get to the most important point—the question of whether she was a maiden or not. No matter how pure his intentions, he was cautious to say it in front of her.

‘It has already been verified by Overgeared Corn.’

Grid made a detour. “I... I believe in the fact that you are sacred and inviolable.”

“...Huh? Ah, yes...”

What...? Why was he avoiding her gaze?

“D-Don’t tell me, you’re not?”

“T-That is impossible.”

“Sigh... I’m glad.”

The Goddess eventually said, “...It is already time.”

[The exit of the primordial space has opened.]

“Go out before the exit closes.”

Grid wondered, “Why are you in such a hurry all of a sudden?”

“This is the beginning of the world. This is originally an area where only the Gods of the Beginning can enter. From the beginning, it was impossible for you to stay for a long time.”

“The timing seems coincidental...”

Before Grid’s words were over—

[You have left the primordial space.]

The green light source disappeared without a trace and a familiar landscape filled Grid’s field of view. He was back in the Overgeared Palace.

-You don’t have to change.

-Do what you believe is right, as you always do.

-That is my wish and my faith.

The voice of the Goddess permeated his mind. She said that she would leave the next steps entirely to him.

Grid nodded. “I will go to the East Continent first.”

Grid first called Nefelina. She looked particularly small and shabby to him, who had been working with Bunhelier for a while, but he had no other options.

‘Small cars can have their advantages.’

He had never actually driven a small car before, so he didn’t know. In any case... there was no other way...
