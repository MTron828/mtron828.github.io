Chapter 1626

[Overgeared God ‘Grid’ has built a new divine world on the surface.]

The world message that emerged at dawn turned the world upside down.

A divine world—people immediately understood it as a concept of a dimension like Asgard. The 19th epic of Grid’s that emerged earlier helped them understand.

Garion and Debirion—the two great gods asked to serve Grid and this led to the arrival of a holy divinity on the surface? It was said to be the cornerstone of the wall that would lead to the jealousy and envy of others. Shortly thereafter, there was a message that Grid had built a divine world.

“Messiah...”

Lauel’s heart thumped.

Surprise, joy, and excitement—all types of intense emotions whirled in his heart.

A world where the gods resided. He didn’t expect that a new divine world, following Asgard and the Hwan Kingdom, would be born on the surface and it was even at the hands of Grid. He couldn’t have imagined it, let alone anticipated it. The rationale was too poor to assume it would be within the range allowed by players. From Lauel’s point of view, it was an event that occurred with no foreshadowing.

‘...Maybe His Majesty himself didn’t expect it.’

The S.A Group had always been unkind.

Lauel suddenly recalled the past. The day when the first ‘lord’ was born among the players. The world had been turned upside down and Lauel was astonished. It was because the information provided in advance by the S.A Group didn’t mention a system in which players could become nobles and lords. There was a really big wave when the news spread to the world one day that Chris, who suddenly became a noble, had become the master of a city a short time later. People ran wild with excitement like a monkey in a new world.

Until this time, the NPC nobles had rightfully ruled over players and were arrogant. Many people had hopes and dreams that they could rise to an equal position and gain power and wealth. There were only a few players who became nobles and lords, but... in any case, there was such a time. It was the era of nobility, when every player had the goal of becoming a noble.

It was the era that Chris opened. Chris was the first to pioneer a system that was now common sense. It wasn’t until a few years later that Grid ushered in the era of kings. Now at this moment, he opened the era of gods. It was literally a divine world. An era he could’ve never imagined even after going through the era of nobles and the era of kings...

The scale was different.

“Indeed... he is the one I chose.”

The black flame dragon flashed over Lauel’s hand as he smiled and covered half his face. The flames mixed with the black energy were stronger today as if to represent his emotions.

The divine world on the surface—the place that would henceforth be humanity’s greatest bastion held a significance so great that it diluted the anxiety Lauel had buried deep in his heart.

‘A third divine world after Asgard and the Hwan Kingdom...’

What type of cool name would it have? Lauel’s thoughts were naturally connected. He naturally wondered about the name without even being aware of it. At the same time, a chill went down his spine.

“...Don’t tell me?”

Ehhh? No? He tried to believe it, but—

[The name of the divine world is ‘Overgeared World.’]

Reality was harsh. The smile disappeared from Lauel’s face. His skin turned so white that it looked blue.

The Overgeared Guild—Lauel resented Grid when he first heard the name. The name of the guild he would belong to for the rest of his life was called Overgeared? Lauel suffered from nightmares for half a year. It was a nightmare where he was surrounded by many people and was being pointed at.

‘He said it is the Overgeared Guild.’

‘Is this real? How did the guild get the name Overgeared?’

‘Overgeared members, keke.’

In the nightmare, the masked people laughed at Lauel like he was insignificant. Lauel was always ashamed and sad because their attitude seemed to represent the public’s inner thoughts. Lauel’s nightmare ended only when Grid and the Overgeared Guild’s fame rose and the world adapted to the name of Overgeared.

However, the peace was short-lived. Soon afterward, Grid created a second guild that was the Overgeared workforce. From then on, Lauel had to suffer from nightmares again. He almost fainted with open eyes when Grid designated the kingdom’s name as Overgeared.

Overgeared Kingdom...

Surprisingly, the public quickly adapted to the name, but Lauel’s nightmare continued for two years. He felt like a chicken.He got goosebumps every time people called him the ‘Overgeared Prime Minister.’ Yet he even adapted to that.

Lauel was proud of himself. Thanks to Grid’s naming sense, he was confident that his mentality was harder than a rock and that he could withstand any trials and adversities in the future. However, that firm faith had soon been broken.

“Overgeared World...?”

Cock-a-doodle-doo...

At the same time, dawn broke and roosters cried out. Lauel resented himself for studying Korean so hard. In his head, English was naturally translated to Korean and he had the idea that the tone of Overgeared World resembled Black-skinned Chicken World.

Tears flowed down like chicken poop.

[Overgeared World Lv. 1]

[Rating: Myth

Type: Dimension

It is a dimension that descended from the divinity of the god of the earth, the god of hunting, and the Overgeared God.

★Dimension effect (based on current level)

-The size of the Overgeared World is proportional to the size of the temples of the Overgeared God, the god of the earth, and the god of hunting in Reinhardt.

-The cooldown time of all skills is removed for the Overgeared God, the god of the earth, and the god of hunting within the Overgeared World.

-If a target that isn’t allowed by the Overgeared God enters the Overgeared World, their status will be greatly weakened and all stats will be reduced by 50%.

-If a target allowed by the Overgeared God enters the Overgeared World, their status will be preserved and all stats are increased by 30%.

-Part of this effect is applied throughout the ‘Reinhardt’ area where the Overgeared World is located.

-You can appoint ‘angels.’

However, the attributes of the angels are greatly influenced by the chief god. In order to appoint angels of the Overgeared World, the target must be armed with at least three myth rated items and the target must be absolutely loyal to the Overgeared God. Number of angels currently available to be appointed: 10.

★Every time a new god is recruited, the level of the Overgeared World will rise.

★Every time the level of the dimension rises, the dimension effect is enhanced or added.]

‘This is crazy...’

The envy and jealousy of others. It was an allusion to the invasion of gods and demons. It meant that the Overgeared World would act as a wall to guard against the enemy’s invasion. Grid had expected it to be a huge influence, but he never dreamed it would be this much.

Wasn’t this truly a heavenly fortress? He could feel reassured. In the future, Reinhardt was unlikely to be the target of an invasion. Even Zeratul, who enjoyed pretending to be strong, would never come near Reinhardt again. Additionally, if the level of the divine world was steadily raised then the entire surface would be safe one day.

Garion explained to Grid, who was feeling amazed and rejoicing, “It is theoretically possible for chief gods to become independent and create a new world. It is easy if you reference the sample called Asgard, made by the gods of the beginning. It is just that the chief gods who have existed so far don't dare to create a separate divine world because they regard the god of the beginning as a mother.”

Asgard was created by Rebecca, a god of the beginning, while the Hwan Kingdom was made by Hanul, another god of the beginning. Except for these two places, the divine world created by the Overgeared World God was the first.

“You have crossed the last line. By now, the heavenly gods must be very angry. There will probably be many gods who will use today’s event as a pretext to invade the surface.” Garion was discussing a despairing matter, but her eyes didn’t waver at all. She wasn’t blaming Grid. “Still, I dare to assure you that the result wouldn’t have changed even if you hadn’t made the Overgeared World. The gods would’ve made up an excuse to someday invade the surface. So... well done.”

"I also have the same idea." Grid nodded.

Angels and gods had already threatened the surface several times. It was a shame to lower his head just because he was afraid. It was right to provoke them or gain the strength to fight back. It was the same logic that nuclear weapons were needed for a nation’s self-defense.

Grid, a citizen of the Republic of Korea, had completed his national defense duties. He understood the importance of national defense. He would’ve created the Overgeared World for the sake of the future, even if he had known in advance that the birth of the Overgeared World would lead to a new crisis...

“......”

Grid’s expression suddenly hardened.

Asgard—it was because he realized the fatal penalty he would suffer if he went there in the position of an invader. Just the level one Overgeared World was enough to drastically reduce the invaders’ stats and status. Therefore, he didn’t know how much of a penalty would occur in Asgard.

Then he quickly calmed down again. When was there a situation that wasn’t hopeless? As always, he would find the answer.

[★ You can create a new six fusion sword dance.] Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Grid came up with the first answer. It was the notification window blinking in the detailed information of Overgeared God's Sword Dance. It was the effect of the 10 points of deity he had just obtained.

Grid focused on the late start.

“Your help would’ve been great."

King Sobyeol—he was always smiling. He smiled even when pushing his older brother to hell. Therefore, Chiyou didn’t like his smile.

Jingle.

Chiyou didn’t open his mouth, but his bells made a sound. Light bells swayed in the cool breeze. It was the symbol of absolute force, the symbol of arrogance, and the hope of the one who desired death. The bells were a tool that made Chiyou’s location identifiable. Anyone who wanted to challenge Chiyou could chase after these bells and raid him at any time.

This was Chiyou’s desire for death. Yet so far, no one had ever dared to challenge Chiyou. It had long been engraved into the world as common sense that they would face the backlash of extinction the moment they challenged him.

“A divine world has come to the surface. Isn’t it all thanks to your help that the Overgeared God has survived without ever dying and created a divine world?”

Even those who were blinded by light would’ve noticed it by now.

Ultimate Martial Art—the fact that Chiyou’s blessing resided in the Overgeared God. Perhaps all the resentment was pouring toward Chiyou? It was because Chiyou was behind the Overgeared God insulting the gods of the beginning and creating a divine world.

“It is the most novel suicide method I have ever seen.”

Chiyou was using the Overgeared God to kill himself. The ones blinded by light would soon send an army of angels toward this place and a new war would begin. This... it was a huge opportunity. The power on this side was still far inferior to Asgard. If he invaded from the other side, they could fight from an advantageous position. There were few concepts as important to the gods as the divine world.

Chiyou saw the gradually darkening smile on King Sobyeol’s face and opened his mouth, “I have never helped the Overgeared God.”

The ultimate technique was different for each individual. The Ultimate Martial Art that Chiyou gave to Grid wasn’t Chiyou’s ultimate, but the ultimate that Grid would one day surely reach. It was the ultimate in ignoring and subduing the opponent’s blows. It was purely Grid’s potential that would threaten Chiyou.

“What nonsense is this...?”

King Sobyeol understood the meaning and frowned. He reacted like it was absurd, but the bells that rang violently from the wind that just blew seemed to laugh at him.
