Chapter 1879

The sky was terribly dark because it was encroached upon by Nevartan and Bunhelier’s magic power. Even the moonlight was blocked, so it wasn’t visible at all. The ecosystem was affected in real time. It resembled the hell that Baal distorted. Then—

“”Are you going to run away?””

Metatron couldn’t tolerate it. The darkness split and scattered again and again along the trajectory of the rays shooting from their eyes and halo. The world was illuminated once again by moonlight, starlight, and all types of nature and materials that reflected Metatron’s divinity.

“...You are strong,” Biban stated. It was close to admiration.

A man called a god despite being human—he had achieved great achievements with the one swordsmanship technique he honed his whole life and had eyes that weren’t satisfied with the incompetence of others. However, he wasn’t stingy toward Metatron.

The same was true of Hayate. He carefully observed the angel, who used their 18 pairs of wings from various angels to drive the dragon’s huge body. Finally, he praised it. “It seems there are few existences in the world who can compete against this angel.”

“I agree. They would be classified as one of the best among the Absolutes.”

[It is true that the movements are strange and nimble due to the many wings, but that is all. That winged angel is a fool who couldn’t even breathe properly in front of Nevartan. Due to fear, they betrayed my grace in saving them.]

“They look a few levels higher compared to Raphael. Of course, we can’t take Raphael’s skills lightly. The more I thought about it, the more I feel that Asgard’s power is formidable.”

“It is reasonable because it is a dimension ruled by a God of the Beginning. Grid must’ve already predicted it.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

[That bastard who dismissed the favor of your colleague, an Old Dragon, as worthless. Are you going to let such an evil and lowly bastard who doesn’t know manners and ethics act like this?]

“......”

Hayate and Biban, who had been conversing while ignoring Bunhelier, finally shifted their attention to Bunhelier. Hayate expressed sympathy while Biban expressed disgust.

“By the way, why did you challenge Nevartan to a fight?”

[...I decided I had a chance.]

“Sir Hayate asked why you fought with Nevartan.”

[Didn’t I explain that it was because I knew I could win?]

“Is that really all?”

[Then what other reason should there be? My judgment wasn’t wrong. If that winged bastard had helped me and your support had been a bit faster, Nevartan’s heart would’ve been digesting in my stomach by now. This would’ve made Grid’s authority much stronger and the Martial God wouldn’t hastily attack Grid again.]

“......”

As expected, there was nothing good about being colleagues. Biban’s expression that was showing his disappointment with Bunhelier changed along the way. Perhaps the evil and selfish villain in front of him was trying to do something ‘for Grid’...

‘As a result, he just got in the way... well, he can’t help being clumsy.’

In general, dragons were creatures that lived alone all their lives. Additionally, due to their overwhelming abilities and powers, they perceived themselves as the center of the world. They didn’t know how to live together with others. It was a learning process, just like Bunhelier now.

“I understand why you are sorry. But even if we had joined forces, we wouldn’t have been able to help against Nevartan.” It was a pointless loss to obsess over meaningless regrets. Hayate made Bunhelier aware of reality and changed the subject. His eyes were fixed on Cranbel, who was having a fierce battle with Metatron. “In that sense, his ability to stop Nevartan’s Breath is astounding. Is Cranbel really related to the Refractive Dragon?”

The Refractive Dragon might be real...

Hayate had observed several dragons for countless years and had speculated this. Recently, through Grid, he learned about what the Great Robber of the Red Night had been collecting and was almost certain about the existence of the Refractive Dragon. Then today—

He witnessed the sight of Nevartan’s dozens of Breaths being reflected by Cranbel, who possessed the noblest character and strength among the top dragons, and who had scales that often became transparent. The performance of Cranbel, who was thought to be the descendant of the Refractive Dragon due to the characteristics of his scales, raised reasonable doubts in Hayate. Was he really a descendant of the Refractive Dragon?

Bunhelier answered in a surprisingly obedient manner to Hayate, who couldn’t take his eyes of Cranbel.

[Of course, he is related. More precisely, it is believed that the Silver Dragons, not Cranbel specifically, inherited God’s will.]

Bunhelier as well—just like Nevartan, he called the Refractive Dragon ‘God.’ He acknowledged the existence of the Refractive Dragon very naturally.

“Does the Refractive Dragon really exist...”

Biban’s expression was strange. His mind became complicated over the fact that the god who appeared and helped humanity whenever it was on the verge of destruction was the god of dragons. It wasn’t recorded because he appeared only at the end of the world, making him unknown to the vast majority of people. What type of mentality did the last savior have when helping humans?

‘Come to think of it, surprisingly, dragons don’t hurt humans. I wonder if this habit stems from the attitude of the Refractive Dragon.’

No, wasn’t it right to say that the Refractive Dragon was born because dragons wanted to help humans?

Did dragons want to help humans? Such a thing?

Bunhelier saw through Biban’s mind, that was swept up in all sorts of questions, and added an explanation.

[I think it wasn’t the wish of dragons that gave birth to the Dragon God, but the wishes of humanity. In the eyes of humans who are facing the end, a great and perfect dragon would’ve been seen as the last hope and would be suitable as the last object of worship. Well, it is just a guess.]

“Do you also only know a little bit about the Refractive Dragon?”

[You humans were created by Rebecca, but don’t know her. How can I fathom God? I don’t know what the other Old Dragons think, but at least for me... embracing God is just a part of my nature. I don’t have to think about it. It isn’t that important.]

Even the end of the world was a trivial matter for the Old Dragons. They were still alive when Yatan destroyed the world. It was the hierarchy of the Old Dragons. From a human point of view, their hierarchy couldn’t be broken, even if it seemed insufficient. This was why Bunhelier was still so arrogant.

[In any case, this is a chance. I will rip off all of that winged bastard’s wings and kill them. I will also devour Cranbel’s heart.]

“...Do you have no shame?”

Biban’s eyes changed again as he looked at Bunhelier. He didn’t look kindly at Bunhelier, who declared that he was going to hunt Cranbel despite Cranbel saving his life.

[Is it human humor? Your way of speaking just now resembles Grid.]

“Looking at you now, I think anyone would’ve said the same thing.”

[If you are going to argue about morality, stop it. Cranbel didn’t stop Nevartan’s Breath because of me.]

Bunhelier confirmed it and shifted his gaze to the prey. The angel and dragon were using the vast sky as a battlefield and coloring the world with a dazzling light. Silver Breaths and gold flashes intersected incessantly.

“It is also true that we can’t afford to sit still like this.”

The longer the battle dragged on, the greater the damage to the surface. Right now, both Cranbel and Metatron were taking care not to harm the civilian population by adjusting the angle of the Breaths and beams, but that was only possible when they had room to breathe. If Cranbel, who would soon be forced on the defensive, was forced to prioritize his safety over the civilians, then he would give up all hesitation with his Breaths.

In the first place, they were a dragon and an angel. Both were eligible to be helped.

Hayate seemed to have a different idea. “I will help Cranbel.”

[What? Are you serious? A member of the tower that takes dragons as their main enemies, and even a Dragon Slayer, will help a dragon?]

“......”

Have you forgotten that you are also a dragon?

It got to the point where Biban stared at Bunhelier with disbelief. On the other hand, Hayate had a smile on his face as he calmly explained the reason, “It is because I know that Cranbel feels favor toward Grid.”

Was there a need for any more reasons?

Biban drew the sword at once.

Broken Sword—Metatron and Cranbel paused while fighting and turned to Biban, even though no traces had been revealed yet.

“”God Grid’s presence...””

[Is it a dragon weapon made in the mental world?]

The energy of Fire Dragon Trauka, the mental world of the Sword God, and the technique and divinity of Only One God Grid—this was the framework of Broken Sword. The presence was enormous.

Metatron’s thoughts poured out toward Biban and Hayate.

-I know that God Grid is like me. Since you are servants of God Grid, it is right for you to show respect and favor toward me.

They misrepresented Grid’s favor toward them. It was the limit of the species, an archangel. They obviously looked down on human beings.

“Who is similar to whom? Cheeky bastard.”

Biban clicked his tongue and aimed the Broken Sword. The tip of the broken blade was aimed at Metatron.

‘I have to go all out from the beginning.’

It was hard to guarantee victory in a one-on-one battle. The angel with 18 pairs of wings had a combat power that exceeded a top dragon. Even Hayate couldn’t be relaxed when facing them.

A huge blade that divided the world soared up. It had speed and power despite its size.

Metatron was immediately split in half.

“”Kuek...””

The range was too large to avoid. It was blocked, but defense was useless. It was a completely different power from previous worlds. It was all due to Grid’s influence.

Metatron shuddered and used Heal. Then their body, which had been cut in half, immediately regained its full form. It wasn’t the concept of ‘reversing’ such as recovery, restoration, or regeneration.

Metatron became two. It was the result of the two halves of the body both regaining their original appearance.

[Angels possess the most difficult powers.]

Bunhelier fell silent after these words. The restoration of Metatron, which resulted in proliferation, was in accordance with the providence of the Trinity, which pursued perfection. It was a miracle completed with perfection. Among the gods of Asgard, it was a miracle that only Rebecca, Judar, and Dominion could display.

[There is only one way to kill them.]

Repeated extinction without giving room to breathe. In other words, it wasn’t feasible. There was no way to kill Metatron unless dozens of Breaths were overlapped, i.e. what Nevartan did. Attacking halfway would only give Metatron more power. In reality—

Metatron became two and attacked Biban and Cranbel respectively. Since there were two of them, it was natural to play the role of two. The doubled halos greatly expanded the range of the bombardment, causing a torrential rain of divinity. It wasn’t just Biban and Cranbel. Bunhelier and Hayate were also kept in check at the same time.

This was Asgard’s secret weapon.

It was the moment when Bunhelier belatedly regretted touching Metatron the wrong way...

Bunhelier’s huge eyes caught the scattering of sword energy. The sight of the sharp sword energy that bloomed from a single source and repeatedly collided with each other, irregularly spreading the range and trajectory, was both intimidating and beautiful. He would die if he was cut by that.

The power to remind an Old Dragon of death. The true identity of the energy that was beautiful and eye-catching was the Dragon Slayer energy.

Humanity’s first Absolute—after being impressed by Grid, he overcame his fear and it had been a long time since the hesitation disappeared before the Dragon Killing Sword. It was much faster and sharper than when he cut Zeratul in the past. Furthermore, like Biban, he was armed with a dragon weapon created by Grid.

[I se... e...you... are one of the causes... who instigated Chiyou’s desire...]

Metatron’s two bodies disappeared without a trace. Leaving behind only the thoughts that lingered like echoes, they became two rays of light that soared high into the sky.

After watching the scene for a while, Bunhelier slowly stepped out. He showed off the overwhelming appearance of an Old Dragon to the whole world.

[It is your turn next.]

“Stop.”

“Yes.”

The figure of the Old Dragon disappeared without a trace. It was because Bunhelier discovered Grid, who appeared at the scene, and polymorphed into human form.

Grid’s expression wasn’t comfortable. He was worried about Hayate, whose arms had become rags in return for the blow just now.

The limits of the human body. Grid was certain that Hayate using his full power was the same as a declaration of determination.

“They were greatly weakened after a series of battles with strong enemies and being slashed by Sir Biban’s sword. Thanks to that, I defeated them easily. You don’t have to worry.”

To be a bit more precise, the reason why Metatron meekly backed down was due to Grid’s proximity. Metatron was never a weak opponent and everyone on this field knew it. But Grid wasn’t worried. He had gained new colleagues. It was just like Zeratul.

“Cranbel, I understand the situation. I owe you a lot again. Thank you.”

The incident had come to an end. All that remained was to finish it well.

Grid bowed politely to Cranbel first. It was with genuine respect, just like when he faced Hayate.

Bunhelier’s unnecessarily handsome face crumpled.
