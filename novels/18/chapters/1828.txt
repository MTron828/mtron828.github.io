Chapter 1828

In the last four days, most of the transcendents and legends were escorted by the Overgeared members and fled to safety. On the other hand, the very few transcendents that the Overgeared members couldn’t grasp were killed by Baal. Every time, the world was turned upside down. 

It was like that today. One transcendent lost his life. In the process, a city was smashed. 

“What just happened...?” 

An inn in a city of the Cho Kingdom of the East Continent—a bright young man who worked as an inn waiter died tragically in front of people. It was done by Baal who suddenly invaded. There were many witnesses because the size of the inn was so large. 

Many players who visited the inn to have a meal or restore their stamina witnessed the appearance of Baal. The 1st ranked Great Demon came to the restaurant to eat. 

Players who didn’t understand the absurd situation soon witnessed a horrific sight. It was a scene where the inn waiter, whom they thought was an ordinary young man, was killed while fighting against Baal. The purple transparent hands operated separately by Baal particularly drew attention. They were like the God Hands and they instantly took away the momentum of the inn waiter. The nearby players also experienced an instant depletion of mana. 

Hands that prohibited the utilization of resources—in Satisfy where resources were absolutely necessary to use skills or magic, Baal’s new weapon showed a fraudulent power. It seemed that no one could be Baal’s opponent. 

-Won’t Grid be okay though? Grid is more about items than skills. 

-This is a typical bias. Grid uses twice as many skills as others all the time. He has always relied on the sword dances to kill a boss. 

-That’s right. If you say that Grid is only overgeared, then you don’t know Grid very well. He has skills, stats and items. 

-Therefore, it is true that Grid has an advantage over others. Even if the skills are blocked, his stats and items will remain. Winning against Baal with just that is another story... 

Broadcasters from all over the world aired emergency discussion programs. The videos of Baal’s battle were aired and the causes and solutions to the incident were discussed. In the process, Grid’s name was naturally mentioned. The experts predicted the second Great Human and Demon War through Baal’s action of personally coming to the surface to find and kill the strong. They warned that the short-lived peace would soon come to an end and insisted on cooperating with Grid and the Overgeared members as much as possible. 

The repercussions were huge. Inquiries from players poured in toward the Overgeared Guild. They asked if the Overgeared Guild was getting ready to fight the demons and many of them expressed their willingness to help. This was even though they weren’t rankers. The people who were afraid during the Great Human and Demon War had grown up and were trying to help. 

“They are better than me,” Ibellin murmured as he stared blankly at the procession of hot-blooded people. His eyes were sunken. It was nothing like his youthful eyes that were full of ambition. The days when he was praised as the future of the Overgeared Guild and was on top of the world couldn’t be the same as his present self who was blocked by a wall. 

Someone suddenly asked, “You’ve lost motivation, haven’t you?” 

“Isn’t it obvious? The reason I feel helpless is because I get fewer results compared to my efforts, not because I have lost my motivation...” Ibellin replied with a frown only to suddenly close his mouth. 

The smiling man who approached his side—it was Grid. 

“W-What are you doing here?” 

“I’m here to give you a gift. Now, take this.” 

Grid handed Ibellin a sword. It was a flamberge. It was a sword with a wavy blade. It resembled the Thorn of Deep Grievance, but strangely, the color of the blade was red. It was because the material used was the scales of Fire Dragon Trauka. 

‘A dragon weapon...!’ 

Ibellin was looking at the item information when a shiver ran through his body. 

“I’m certain I can handle this sword really well,” Ibellin expressed his confidence. 

Was it because the dragon weapon’s attack power was nearly twice as powerful as other myth rated items? That wasn’t the case. The reason why Ibellin was confident wasn’t out of the expectation that he could rely on the power of the weapon. 

Small Breath—he noted the wide-area skill built into the sword. For Ibellin, who dealt damage proportional to the health of the target, it was a great advantage to be able to damage multiple enemies at once. 

Grid knew it as well. This was why he wanted to make sure that Ibellin was appointed as an angel and to make him one of the main pillars of the hell expedition. Ibellin’s character was ruined because he grew incorrectly? 

This was wrong in Grid’s mind. There was only one area where Ibellin was worse than a normal swordsman. It was that he was powerless against NPCs or monsters of the named or higher level. For the majority of beings who couldn’t resist damage proportional to their health, Ibellin was a counter. This ability to wipe out enemy mobs alone was amazingly good. Additionally, Satisfy was a team game. Various roles were needed and Ibellin’s value was very high. 

“Now, put this on first.” 

Grid handed Ibellin three pieces of armor. All three were myth rated items, but their performance wasn’t overwhelming. It was because the function was adjusted to lower the wearer restriction. 

“You are my first angel.” 

Possess three myth rated items—the condition for becoming an angel of the Overgeared World was very demanding from a general point of view. However, Grid was the exception. For Grid, who could easily make myth rated items, appointing a specific target as an angel was a very simple task. 

[Only One God Grid has appointed the player Ibellin as an angel of the Overgeared World.] 

This world message emerged. 

Flash! 

Ibellin’s body was surrounded by an orange light. It was Grid’s divinity. 

Buzz buzz. 

The people who visited Reinhardt to make various inquiries—the crowds of people in the square were shaking after witnessing the palace bathed in light. It was the birth of a player-appointed player angel. It was a meaningful moment that allowed them to realize that the Overgeared World was developing into a dimension on par with Asgard. 

“It feels like something is finally starting in earnest.” 

The thrilled Overgeared members smiled. 

[Ibellin is the ‘Angel of Slaughtering Mobs.’] 

“......”

The continuous world message calmed the excited atmosphere. 

-...No, what is wrong with this? If you wanted to give a name like that, it should be Slaughter, not Slaughtering Mobs. 

Lauel immediately sent a whisper to Grid. He fiercely criticized Grid’s negligent attitude. 

Grid felt wronged. 

-I tried to do that, but it didn’t work. I think it is because of Michael. 

Michael, the 3rd ranked Archangel who was defeated by Grid in the past and wiped out by Ruby—he was the Archangel of Slaughter. Perhaps due to this, the system set it so that the title of ‘Slaughter’ couldn’t be given. Therefore, Grid gave the next best option of ‘Slaughtering Mobs.’ 

The reason why he tried to give Ibellin the title of ‘Slaughter’ in the first place was because he was good at slaughtering enemies. 

-In any case, I feel sorry for Ibellin. 

-Well, he likes it. Do you think that everyone in the world is as picky as you? 

Grid briefly blocked the complaining Lauel and spoke to Ibellin, who was looking at the ‘angel’s armor.’ 

“That sword is actually close to a failure. The proof is that even after using the scales of an old dragon, only a Small Breath was recreated.” 

Small Breath was a skill that was activated in items made from the scales of a low grade dragon. Ibellin’s dragon weapon had a clear flaw. 

“But the reason for the flaw is special. The structure itself is different from ordinary swords. Khan and Hexetia devised it from the design stage.” 

Grid handed Ibellin the Eye of Pallalian. He asked Ibellin to check the hidden function of the item for himself using this. Ibellin used the Eye of Pallalian to assess the sword. Then his eyes widened. “This...” 

Ibellin injected sword energy into the flamberge and the wavy blade started to spin. It was a sword that vibrated sword energy with physical force to expand and scatter the range of the blade. It was a feature developed by Khan and Hexetia, who were inspired by the story of Biban turning himself into a sword. Simply put, Ibellin’s sword caused splash damage. Basic attacks were applied as wide area attacks. 

“...No matter how many demons Baal summons, I will wipe them all out. I’ll make sure of it.” 

Ibellin knew exactly what Grid wanted. He declared that he would live up to Grid’s expectations. It was an attitude that made Grid smile.

“Really. It is full of materials for the marks.” 

Norae Hills—Sabaek smiled as he looked at the white butterflies floating in the all yellow landscape. His black eyes were only filled with greed. 

“Didn’t I tell you that there is no way to lose money if you listen to me?” 

Hwang Gildong puffed up. It was while wearing new straw shoes that he took out from his luggage. He must’ve changed ten pairs of straw shoes on the way here. The road was rough. 

“Is there a reason to stick to straw shoes?” Kraugel asked Hwang Gildong as he watched curiously from a distance. 

Old Sword Demon explained, “He said that he has to wear straw shoes to properly hide the sound of his footsteps. He is cautious because if he makes footsteps right after using the cloning technique, there is a high risk of his main body being detected.” 

“I see.” 

On the way here, Kraugel had witnessed Hwang Gildong’s clones several times. He thought it had been particularly difficult to distinguish between the main body and the clones. It turned out there was a reason for it. 

‘However, the equipment, including the shoes, are too simple. It seems to say that he has given up his defense.’ 

It was easy to see why Hwang Gildong was cautious with his main body. Kraugel remembered Hwang Gildong, who put Old Sword Demon in the vanguard and disappeared every time there was a fight. This made him feel sympathy for Old Sword Demon. 

“By the way, how did you find out that the material for the mark is the cloud butterfly?” Sabaek growled out at this time. 

The way he stared at Hwang Gildong was unusual. It contained a killing intent that exceeded hostility. He was ready to turn Hwang Gildong into an enemy and kill him immediately. 

Hwang Gildong waved his hand. “I am the leader of the Chivalrous Robbers. It is only right to know a lot. I have done quite a lot of research on the marks you have made. I have no other intentions.” 

“It is hard to believe. Aren’t you also aiming for the recipe of the marks?” 

“I can’t get it just because I am after it, right? If I ask you how you make it, will you answer?” 

“You will spy on me making it.” 

“Isn’t it enough to make it here? There will be no end to it if you keep suspecting like this... Oh my!” 

It was a mess. Sabaek started to attack Hwang Gildong. It was hard to count how many times it happened. Either way—

Unlike Old Sword Demon, who was chewing on jerky while enjoying the scenery of Norae Hills, Kraugel interjected between the two of them. 

“Sabaek.” 

“Don’t stop me. I can’t stand by any longer and watch him talk nonsense...” 

“The marks. If there are enough materials for the marks here, can you make around 20 sheets first?” 

“...What?” 

Sabaek, who had been polite since witnessing Kraugel’s martial ability, frowned. 

“I will pay a fair price.” 

“You will put a value on my work? How arrogant. I won’t give it to you even for billions of gold.” 

Sabaek’s words became shorter. The mark was a signature that determined his value. There was a concern that his value would be reduced if he hastily used it as a tool for trading. Therefore, Kraugel had to make an effort to convince him, who was reacting sensitively. 

“This is for humanity.” 

“Does that matter to me?” 

“I only need 20 pieces. Grid will be happy.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I have no obligation to please the god you serve.” 

“Don’t you owe me for saving your life? Think of it as returning the favor.” 

“...How dirty.” 

“You are the one making me like this.” 

Kraugel pushed Sabaek to the end. He didn’t want to miss an opportunity to help his colleagues. 

In the end, Sabaek was forced to raise the white flag. “Okay. Instead, I have conditions. Cover your eyes and ears.” 

“I understand.” Kraugel nodded and glanced back. Hwang Gildong stood beside Old Sword Demon and was staring this way. 

“Hwang Gildong, I want you to leave with me for a while.” 

“I understand,” Hwang Gildong readily replied. Old Sword Demon’s expression was uncomfortable when looking at him. It was because he heard Hwang Gildong talking to himself. 

“Everything up to here is as planned.” 

‘...This is 100% a clone.’ 

Old Sword Demon could guarantee that the production method for the marks would be leaked after today. He thought that maybe production would start at the Overgeared Empire’s alchemy facility sooner or later.
