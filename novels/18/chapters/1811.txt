Chapter 1811

‘Of course, I don’t intend to go against Bunhelier.’

Those who knew about the Old Dragons often criticized Bunhelier severely. Putting aside Bunhelier’s weakening in front of Baal, there was an atmosphere of evaluating his natural authority itself as substandard. However, this was just a perception among Absolutes. Even the Absolutes who rated Bunhelier low hadn’t been able to do anything about him so far.

The Old Dragon in front of him, who seemed to have been arbitrarily escorted to the tower by the tower members, was one of the monsters that survived safely from the beginning to now despite all types of resentments. Just because Bunhelier was making various expressions like a human didn’t mean he should be treated as a human, as if he was an insignificant being.

The moment it happened, Dragon Slayer Hayate sent a warning.

-We might not be able to bear it even if the three of us work together to suppress him. If it was possible, I can assure you that Bunhelier would’ve already died in the distant past.

Hayate used an extremely respectful expression while whispering in a tone that only Grid could hear. It wasn’t done consciously. It happened on his own because he felt respect for Grid.

-Bunhelier either has unknown means, or the hierarchy of Old Dragons is greater than what we’ve experienced. It will be one of these two.

Of course, he immediately changed his tone when Grid showed signs of discomfort. It also meant that he was only able to talk without honorifics when he was conscious of it.

-Are you saying there is no benefit in being hostile to him?

-That’s right. It isn’t just because we are afraid. It is because we have so many things to carry.

Let’s give a simple example. Even if the three of them fought Bunhelier here and won, there was no guarantee that they could stop Bunhelier from escaping. It was fundamentally impossible to prevent the rampaging Bunhelier from devastating the continent in real time.To add some exaggeration, how could they respond to the magic bombardment of the Old Dragon that ‘crosses the continent with one flap of its wings?’ Except for some areas protected by the Overgeared World, most areas would disappear from the map that day.

-That leash was made by Bunhelier himself.

Biban inferred the contents of the conversation between Grid and Hayate and interjected to add.

Grid nodded.

-I don’t intend to be hostile in the first place. I just want to get the upper hand in this relationship.

It was only half true that Bunhelier was unnecessary in defeating Baal.

First of all, Grid wasn’t able to accurately estimate Baal’s current level of power.

Yura’s regular reports revealed that Baal had mastered several new skills, including the energy of a God Killer, and the ability to move endlessly in all directions. However, Grid judged that Baal wouldn’t be able to handle the joint attacks of Grid, the apostles, and the tower members.

He was confident that he could kill Baal hundreds or thousands of times even without Bunhelier’s help. In the process of these countless deaths, it was also calculated that using the epics would erase the root of fear that humanity harbored toward Baal. But if Baal became stronger than expected or he had a number of hidden trump cards... at worst, he might’ve completed Asura.

At that time, Grid would definitely need Bunhelier’s help.

‘Bunhelier’s specialty is magic. Even if he is weakened in hell, he is likely to have amazing synergy with Braham.’

It was okay for Grid to simply board him. After all, the effect of riding Bunhelier was greater than riding Nefelina. Of course, Nefelina was a one minute supercar, but Bunhelier was a high-end hypercar. He was a bit aged when compared to the other Old Dragons, who were the latest high-end hypercars, but he was still much better than Nefelina.

‘...Saying this makes Nefelina seem useless, but that isn’t the case. No matter how good the rental car is, my own car is the best.’

Above all, Nefelina could speak short but complete Dragon Words. At least in terms of Dragon Words, she might be better than Bunhelier.

‘Is this right?’

Pity flashed in Grid’s eyes as he looked at Bunhelier. It was a feeling that came momentarily and disappeared, but Bunhelier didn’t miss it and captured it.

“What? Are you really mocking me right now?”

Bunhelier was in a position where Baal had to be destroyed. There was a feeling that he would be reduced to a dog shackled by Baal if he couldn’t overcome the curse. That couldn’t happen. It was naturally right to cooperate with Grid, who was equally hostile to Baal. It was based on the judgment that there would be a possibility of taking Baal’s infinite life if they joined forces.

He didn’t want to be Grid’s enemy as much as possible. It was a thought he had since they fought in hell together. Therefore, Bunhelier gave Grid the respect he deserved. It was to the point where he praised Grid as great while the world was watching.

Yet Grid was arrogantly making fun of him. It wasn’t enough to refuse cooperation. He also sent Bunhelier a pitying gaze. As could be seen from that low ranking man over there...

“You’ve become very arrogant. Is it some type of defense mechanism? You want to conceal your humble birth by insulting a higher being than yourself?”

Despite his temper, Bunhelier was now aware that he was making a mistake. However, he was an Old Dragon. He was in a regrettable position, but his hierarchy meant he couldn’t bear the humiliation.

Grid saw Bunhelier growing increasingly angry and first tried to calm his mood.

-It is a misunderstanding. Putting aside the fact that your strength is unnecessary to kill Baal, I don’t underestimate you. Why is it that you are unnecessary even when I clearly know that you are stronger than all of us in the first place? It is because I don’t need to use a cow knife to kill chickens. Can’t you put it this way?

Black eyes with orange divinity hovering in the center—Grid stared at Bunhelier with deep and mysterious eyes while seeking the advice of Lauel and Huroi.

After a short period of time, he opened his mouth, “Evil Dragon Bunhelier.”

“......?”

“Aren’t you in a very poor position to call yourself noble? The only ones who fear you right now are humanity. If the world comes to an end and all of humanity dies. You must know that you will be nothing at that time, right?”

“You...! You are crazy...!”

“No, it is a terrible reality for you. You weren’t able to handle Nevartan, who has already gone mad, and you have become even weaker because of Baal. Do you think the demons of hell and the celestial gods will respect you properly? From the moment you collaborated with Baal, you would’ve been branded as a black sheep by the other Old Dragons... keep this in mind. You are a piece of trash right now. You wouldn’t be able to have any prestige without humanity who fears you because you are a dragon.”

“......”

Bunhelier’s complexion, which had started to turn red, returned to white. He couldn’t find any words to refute it. He controlled his mind the moment he acknowledged the situation.

An Old Dragon’s mental spirit was indeed transcendent.

“We are in an awkward position to cooperate with you. At best, cooperating with you to invade hell again? Even though you lose most of your power in hell? It would just be raising the morale of Baal and the demons as they wonder how bad our situation is to rely on you.”

“......”

From now on, should he be strict to stop those guys from harming humans?

Bunhelier seriously pondered this while Grid’s criticism continued.

“It is the seed that you have sown. After repeated deception and ridicule without respect for others, you have become lonely. There is no one in the world to help when you are weak.”

“I fully understand your intention of not wanting to cooperate, so do it in moderation. There are limitations to what I will listen to.”

“But only one person.”

Now—

Grid embraced the spirit of craftsmanship, just like when he was making items. He connected every word perfectly through Lauel’s wisdom and Huroi’s mouth.

“Only I am willing to help you.”

“......”

Bunhelier’s eyes sharpened at the unexpected words. He was clearly suspicious and wary.

“Of course. It is because you respected me.”

When Bunhelier praised Grid as great, faint Dragon Words emerged. The world identified the protagonist of that moment as Grid. It was proof that Bunhelier’s words were sincere. Bunhelier himself knew it best. Therefore, at this moment, he no longer doubted Grid’s words.

“Bunhelier, make me a promise if you want to join the Baal subjugation expedition and end Baal’s life without fail. In the future, you will also truly respect the things we are trying to protect, just as you do me and my colleagues. If you don’t deceive us, we will be on your side. So it won’t be a loss.”

“...Is that all?”

The doubts that Bunhelier had erased were rekindled.

“Respect you, your colleagues, and humanity, and that is enough for me to cooperate with you?”

Grid hadn’t always fought and won. At times, he persuaded others with words and emotions. Based on this, he built up his power. The emotions came from Grid’s heart while the words usually came from Lauel’s head and Huroi’s mouth. Grid collaborated with the two of them and was invincible in a slightly different way.

It wasn’t impossible to convince an Old Dragon, who became lonely after repeated bad decisions due to his innate evil nature. Of course, it was possible because Grid was the Dragon Knight. Dragon Knight originated from the wishes of Fire Dragon Ifrit and was the only being worthy of being the object of desire of a dragon.

“Yes, the whole world might deny you, but I think differently. Just as you told me I am great, I also think you are great. Even if cooperating with you does more harm than good, I want to be with you out of respect for you.”

“...I see, thank you.”

‘How absurd.’

Biban, who had been watching the situation with interest, smiled blankly. Bunhelier was the one who approached like his cooperation was an honor. Yet his position changed in an instant. He was expressing his gratitude and believed that cooperating with Grid was possible purely thanks to Grid’s goodwill.

It was an unbelievable sight even when he saw it with his own eyes. It was an opportunity to once again realize the power of the Dragon Knight.

[Evil Dragon Bunhelier has unfamiliar feelings toward you. They are feelings he still can’t admit.]

-You’ve solved it well.

-It is thanks to you.

-You are being too modest.

Grid, Lauel, and Huroi exchanged whispers and praised each other.

“I... I want to gather my thoughts a bit. I want to be here alone for a while.”

“I’ll give you another room so you can relax.”

“No, it is a waste of time to move. I actually feel like I’m wasting my time... I don’t think I’ve ever experienced this before. It is very interesting...”

“...Understood.” Hayate slowly nodded. In this atmosphere, it was a bit embarrassing to tell him to go somewhere else because this was his office.

“It is perfect timing. We needed to move locations.”

At the very least, Grid’s words were comforting.
