Chapter 1785

“It is the power of anion and light wave cooking,” Idan explained. His expression was quite different. He showed no signs of hesitation or frustration and was full of confidence.

“First of all, the anion cooking. The electrons naturally obtained from the soil and sand penetrate into the meat in waves, causing a softening effect. At the same time, it expels foreign substances to eliminate the bad smells.”

‘Isn’t anion a pseudoscience that is legally banned?’

Grid clicked his tongue. As a modern man, he knew from common sense that the anion theory was a superstition.

“Next is the light wave cooking. The pure light of the sun is different from man-made flames. Once it heats the meat, it produces all types of beneficial nutrients. It is literally the energy of the sun. This maximizes the natural aroma and taste of the ingredients, adding great flavor to the meat without the need for sweeteners or spices.”

‘Does he believe in ghosts?’

Ah, there really were ghosts in this world...

Grid gradually became nervous as Idan continued to talk sophistry. He wondered if Raiders would forgive the human being who mocked him.

‘I have to protect him.’

The results were strange, but...

After all, Idan was a valued colleague. Grid was ready to respond as soon as Raiders showed any strange signs. Of course, he was going to persuade Raiders through a conversation rather than fighting. Thus, he sent a whisper to Huroi beforehand. He planned to lead the conversation to the advantage using real-time advice from Huroi.

Such preparations were unnecessary.

“Hmm.” Raiders’ expression gradually changed to interest. “Are you incorporating what humans call science into cooking?”

Human beings were different from other transcendent beings. They were born with poor strength and knowledge from birth, so they had to create, learn, and train themselves in all types of things.

Science was a prime example. It was the study of humanity.

“Science...? No way. No matter how you look at it, I am a pure chef.”

‘It looks obvious, so you don’t have to say it.’

Grid, who did his best even though he didn’t study well, inwardly kept criticizing it.

“You mean that you just enlightened yourself.”

Raiders looked very satisfied. It was a reaction that showed he didn’t care about Idan’s baseless claims. It was natural. The food that entered his mouth tasted delicious right away. This taste was the power that supported Idan’s claims.

“Understanding and utilizing the elements of nature as materials for cooking... you are the wisest and most outstanding of anyone who has ever called himself a sage. You are the sage who has been hiding all this time.”

At this moment, a world message appeared. It was natural. A mere human being received the recognition of an Old Dragon in front of some of the world’s leading figures, Grid and the Great Robber of the Red Night. The world wouldn’t be able to stand by and ignore the person called Idan.

[A new legend is engraved in the world.]

‘No way, there is no way.’

What an absurd yet obvious development? Grid felt joy and sorrow at the fact that the soon-to-be-born legendary chef was Idan. He was happy that his person had become a legend, but he wondered if it was okay for Idan to become a legendary chef.

What if Idan’s cooking in the future increased stats or gave them buffs? The Overgeared members, the knights of the empire, and the soldiers would have to unconditionally eat the dishes he made. Of course, they couldn’t afford not to eat it. Thus, they would have to suffer through his meals three times a day in the future. It was hell just imagining it.

[A new legend, ‘Dragon’s Chef,’ has been born.]

“......?”

The legendary chef was predicted. But a Dragon’s Chef?

The Great Robber’s astonished words rang into the ears of the flustered Grid. “Are you going to make him your exclusive chef?”

His prediction was right.

“Your cooking truly has infinite possibilities. Unlike other chefs who rely on uniform recipes, you are a wise man who uses the ever changing power of nature.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“......!”

Idan’s eyes widened. They shook wildly before water appeared in them, representing his feelings.

Idan shuddered. It was because he was being acknowledged for the first time in his life. He had blossomed his talent in a different manner and might’ve met the only being in the world who understood him. A light shone on the life that was lonely almost to the last moment.

“I want to keep you by my side forever. Of course, my lair might be too big and desolate for you, a mere human being. As a dragon, I won’t be able to understand your hardships and loneliness and will hurt you a lot.”

It had been proven time and time again, but unlike ordinary dragons, Raiders was a rational thinker. He felt a liking that was beyond species for the human chef in front of him who would bring him the ‘new delicacies’ that he had been searching for all his life.

“But I still want to keep you by my side. I want to end my meaningless wanderings and settle down.”

“......”

“The price I will pay for you is enough. I will use my magic and authority to offer you eternal enjoyment.”

Raiders’ voice was very soft. He looked at Idan with affectionate eyes that contained a bit of fear. It resembled the attitude of proposing to a lover.

‘It is a dream...’

Grid couldn’t accept reality. It was because the situation was too unrealistic to be easily convinced.

Ida was watching Grid. ‘His Majesty didn’t mean to hurt me.’

He wanted to pave a new path to me, who is different from ordinary cooks, so he arranged a meeting with a dragon. I’m sure he remembered Nefelina eating my food without any resistance...

‘He is the one who... from beginning to end... helped me…’

It wasn’t enough that you rescued me from the East Continent, that was on the verge of destruction at the time. You allowed me to cook for so many people and now you arranged a better life...

“I will gladly accept it.”

Idan stared at Grid for a long time before soon replying with a determined look.

“The great you...” Idan spoke with his eyes still fixed on Grid, “I will follow you.”

It was only at the last moment that he turned his attention to Raiders.

His intention.

It was clearly revealed to Raiders, who had existed since the beginning of chaos. He knew that the ‘great you’ that Idan was referring to was Grid, not himself. He didn’t care. Raiders was just grateful.

“My sleep can be quite long for humans. At that time, I can give you freedom. You can live to your heart’s content, at least during that time.”

It meant he could meet Grid at any time. Idan read the consideration and was moved to tears. “I have no regrets even if I die, because I am loved by great people.”

“......”

This was enough.

Grid also smiled. He noticed that Idan was genuinely happy.

‘I don’t know what is going on here, but... in any case, I think everything went well.’

Raiders didn’t become angry, the deal worked, and the legendary chef Idan found happiness. The only regret was that he ended up saying goodbye to Idan. He was hesitant to give up Idan. Idan was a chef Grid didn’t want to entrust with cooking, but he was too good a person to just be abandoned. Hadn’t he shown his faith over the years they spent together? He also made achievements like raising the poison resistance of the Overgeared members and knights.

‘Unfortunately, it can’t be helped. It is enough as long as Idan is happy.’

Moreover, from this point on, Idan’s value was astronomical. He would become the closest being to Gourmet Dragon Raiders in the future and would act as a bridgehead connecting the Old Dragon to the surface. Putting aside Grid’s personal regrets, Idan, who became a Dragon’s Chef, would unconditionally be beneficial to humanity.

Grid was controlling his mind when he heard the murmurs of the Great Robber.

“Isn’t the average sleeping time of the Gourmet Dragon one hundred years...?”

“......”

In the past, Hayate had also explained it when asking Grid to participate in Raiders’ gourmet cycle. The first thing Raiders did when waking up was to find a new delicacy.

“Of course, there is no guarantee that I will sleep for one hundred years. If something big happens like this incident, I might wake up suddenly. Conversely, if there is no big event, there is no need for me to wake up.”

‘...In other words.’

In the end, the legendary chef Idan would return to the Overgeared Empire safely.

***

“Thank you.”

Raiders would call the chef named Idan once every few decades or once every one hundred years. He polymorphed into a beautiful man with brilliant blond hair and gold eyes, the coloring of a Gold Dragon, and bowed slightly to Grid. It was an attitude that shocked both Grid and the Great Robber.

Raiders didn’t mind.

“Didn’t you introduce me to the best chef of this age and make concessions? You deserve to be thanked.”

Unlike other Old Dragons who are obsessed with instinct, I am a noble being with principles...

Raiders’ arrogant eyes seemed to contain such thoughts.

Grid judged that there would be nothing good about staying on this matter and nodded.

“I am honored that you have recognized my favor. So I can trust that you won’t break our deal, right?”

“Of course. There is no need to waste time. Let’s carry out the deal immediately.”

“Are you saying that we will be leaving right away?”

“Is there a problem with that?”

“No. No...”

On the Ruins of the Martial God that had been reduced to an uninhabited island, Idan watched the group with a kind smile on his face. Grid immediately ascended to heaven with Raiders and the Great Robber, only to feel a sense of strangeness.

It didn’t take long for him to figure out the reason for this feeling.

‘Aren’t we going to Asgard right now?’

Then why were Raiders and the Great Robber as calm as if they were going for a walk in the park in front of their house? Raiders was an Old Dragon and had little to fear, but why was the Great Robber so calm?

“Don’t you need to prepare anything?”

“Raiders, you, and I are the preparations. It is enough, so don’t worry.”

“Rig...”

Grid’s expression distorted as he was nodding in understanding. Was he included in the preparations?

“Do I really have to go up and fight?”

“That will only happen if we are discovered. Even I can’t guarantee 100% safety when I am invading the realm of the gods. Then you have to protect me.”

Why didn’t you tell me...

Grid missed Biban for some reason and his face moved like it was about to peel off. It was the aftermath of Raiders flying with him and the Great Robber on his back. The Ruins of the Martial God instantly became a dot and the vast Red Sea was obscured by clouds, becoming invisible.

[Keep this in mind. From a human point of view, we are better than the gods of Asgard.]

It happened as Raiders’ meaningful words appeared in Grid’s mind...

[You have entered the world of the gods, ‘Asgard.’]

Golden clouds filled Grid’s vision. Using the power of an Old Dragon, they crossed dimensions in an instant.

“Follow me!” The Great Robber jumped off Raiders’ back and shouted urgently.

"Thank you." Grid chased after the Great Robber, but he didn’t forget to thank Raiders. It was a chance to save Hexetia and Khan. They were words that came out naturally due to gratitude.

Raiders smiled. ‘Thank you for the deal.’

He should be the one who was thankful since he received more than he gave.

‘...It isn’t bad.’

‘Golden Protection’ chased after the moving Grid.
