Colorful Balloons Take Flight
0.00 / 0.00

Amoract’s castle was bizarre. The castle itself was so huge that it was hard to guess the size of it, and while the number of rooms inside it were countless, all of them were empty. There was really nothing. There weren’t even any traces of life.

Maybe this place itself was a huge trap?

Katz even had such doubts, but he soon got rid of them.

A battle against patience—after wandering through the maze of corridors for more than half a day, he finally found it. Chains were strewn across the floor.

The chains—they took the form of a seal. It was created by Beriache’s technique and she originally targeted Baal.

‘It is around here.’

The chains were a signpost. Katz knew that Amoract was at the end of the chains and started walking after the chains. Nevertheless, he got lost several times. The chains were so long and entangled in all directions that they kept presenting him with forks in the road.

“......”

It was after a few hours of concentrating so much that he didn’t recognize the epic sentences that intermittently popped up. Katz finally reached the end.

The great hall lurking at the end of the maze. All the chains were pointing to this place.

Katz’ body turned to smoke as he slowly and cautiously approached the great hall. Beyond the huge door, he saw a woman bound against the wall. It was a woman with a white cloth wrapped all over her body. The outline of her body and face was more prominent due to the cloth, and she was as beautiful as a sculpture. There was the feeling that she shouldn’t be embraced.

The identity of the woman whose entire body was bound by thousands of chains. She was the 2nd Great Demon, Amoract.

He shouldn’t be misled by her appearance.

“......”

Katz watched Amoract while holding his breath. Grid had entrusted him with two missions. It was to spy on Amoract, and to search for Beriache’s soul.

Beriache’s soul was presumably currently believed to be in Amoract’s possession. If he encountered her, then there was a high probability he would be given a hidden quest. It was Grid and Lauel’s guess that this would be of great help to the expedition.

‘It is quiet.’

Katz watched Amoract’s reaction every time a new sentence of the epic popped up. There was no movement at all. She was silent no matter how the epics described Baal’s condition. It was the same when it stated that Grid was on the defensive. She remained silent even when the unbelievable sentence was written about the king of hell becoming fearful.

‘It doesn’t matter.’

The attitude of not caring about what the fate of hell was...

‘She really isn’t getting involved in this case...?’

It wasn’t just strange. Amoract had collaborated with Baal to banish Beriache from hell but that was the only time she collaborated with Baal. From the time hell was distorted to the present day, she walked a different path from Baal. Leraje and Eligos had testified to it. The Yatan Church was also evidence of it. Unlike Baal, who denied Yatan, Amoract even set up a religion using proxies and made humans worship Yatan.

‘It seems obvious that she is at odds with Baal like Grid says...’

Even so, it would be too much from Amoract’s perspective to stand by as Baal fell into a crisis. If Baal died, Grid’s next target would naturally be Amoract. Amoract couldn’t just stand by and watch Baal’s crisis for her own safety. Even if she didn’t openly help Baal, it was right for her to try and interfere with Grid, even indirectly.

So how long was she going to stay silent?

It happened as Katz’ doubts were growing...

[Baal and I are very compatible. It is obvious since our father made us as a pair from the beginning.]

Throughout the great hall—no, the woman’s voice rang throughout the castle.

“......?”

Katz didn’t notice for a moment that the owner of the voice was Amoract. It was because Amoract was chained up, just like when she first appeared. Her mouth didn’t move at all. However, she was talking.

It was intent.

[Every time I stir up a conflict and cause more strife, death comes like a tidal wave and Baal grows stronger. My activities benefit Baal so Baal didn’t harm me.]

Baal delighted in harming beings other than himself. However, he had ignored Amoract, who was opposing him. This was the moment when the reason was revealed.

In addition.

[That’s why I didn’t break this bondage.]

One of the Evils of the Beginning—Amoract, one of the Absolutes of hell, just like Baal, had been too quiet. She only established the Yatan Church so that people could worship Yatan. She didn’t come to the surface and actively harm humans. She even stood by when the Yatan Church collapsed.

Was she favorable or indifferent to humans? It was an attitude that produced such hopeful observations. However, the truth was different. Amoract just didn’t want to help Baal.

[The 1st Great Demon, ‘Baal,’ has died.]

Just in time, a shocking message occurred. No way, it actually happened. Grid really defeated Baal. He succeeded in a solo raid.

It happened the moment when Katz was overcome with shivers...

Rattle.

Amoract raised her head. The chains extended to restrain her, but it was useless. As Amoract slowly stretched her waist and leaned back her upper body, all the chains that bound her started to loosen.

[Now there is no reason to be bound.]

Amoract was also a mutant. She wasn’t good, contrary to the wishes of the absolute god Yatan, who gave birth to children in order to comfort and protect the dead. It was just like Baal. Therefore, she cooperated with Baal and expelled Beriache. Putting aside her love for her father, she had helped Baal distort hell.

Pure evil—the moment she loosened her restraints and stepped on the cold marble floor...

“”We have to stop her.””

A buzzing voice permeated Katz’ ears. It was the voice of a soul. A soul in the form of a slender girl.

An Absolute being on the surface who controlled several dragons through force and helped Grid—it seemed to be a younger version of Marie Rose, the vampire duke who contributed greatly to the success of the Baal raid.

“Beriache...!”

Katz, who had been trying to stay calm even in an urgent situation, was a bit relieved. He saw an opportunity to break the stalemate.

[You have witnessed your master in a previous life.]

[The class ‘Beriache’s Warrior’ has awakened.]

[By designating Beriache as a loyal target, all your stats have temporarily increased.]

[The function of some skills has been changed and the cooldown time adjusted.]

Katz restored his body that had been in the form of smoke and forged a sword from his blood. His right hand was holding a dragon weapon made by Grid while his left hand held that blood sword that originated from Beriache’s power. He held the two swords and took the posture of ‘Protector of the Last Guardian of Hell.’

Originally, it was a skill called ‘Relentless Pursuit In Search of the Master.’ Increased defense, critical hit immunity, an increase in weapon power, an increase in attack speed, unconditional critical hits, an increase in critical hit damage, etc.

All types of buffs wrapped around Katz and made him more powerful than before.

The pool of blood beneath his feet was ready to respond to Katz’ will. The blood staining the air red also gradually grew thicker to disturb the enemy’s vision and senses. The ancient class, which already boasted a majesty that was in line with transcendence, had evolved to a higher level.

[Beriache, that child is much better than the trash you made yourself.]

“”It wasn’t trash. The name was Gabbeli.”

[It was a name that wasn’t worth remembering. On the other hand, I think I will remember this child’s name forever.]

The wall behind Amoract’s back was torn down. It was something that rendered the position of Katz, who was at the entrance of the great hall to guard it, meaningless.

Katz immediately rushed over. He rushed at Amoract, who was trying to escape through the collapsed wall.

[It was purely because of Baal that there are bound souls everywhere in hell. Now that Baal is dead, all the souls have regained their freedom. Child, I have no intention of hanging out with you in a situation where Beriache’s soul might help you.]

“I have no intention of letting you go.”

[Haha, I’m sure you are great but it is too presumptuous to say that. Grid is currently the only one in hell who can pressure me. Even Sword God Biban can’t do it.]

Amoract had been nervous when she first felt the presence of intruders. Between Only One God Grid and Biban, who was reborn as the Sword God—it was hard to gauge which of the two had the upper hand. They were both great.

However, now it was clear. In the process of fighting Baal, Grid had grown in real time and was clearly stronger than Biban. On the contrary, this had become more convenient.

Amoract’s power was to cause conflict. In particular, Amoract’s specialty was to make the weak rebel against the strong. The ugly emotions that lay beneath human beings. It was easy to stir up their jealousy and desire. Moreover, the garbage left by Baal happened to be holding Biban back.

Asura—did Baal say that he was an Evil God? It was so absurd that it made her laugh. Their father was the only god of hell.

Another being—

Moreover, a bug made by Baal shouldn’t dare to claim to be a god of hell.

Amoract opened the warp gate and disappeared in an instant. The law of making movement magic impossible had been weakened since Baal regained his original form, and then it was destroyed with Baal’s death.

“......”

Katz missed her because the spear of magic he released reached her just as she disappeared, but he didn’t hesitate. He watched closely as the spear of magic that pierced her body was scattered. Of course, the scattered magic lost its form and luster. But the blood remained. Katz was able to figure out the direction in which the remnants of magic power-filled blood were heading in order to return to their master.

There were only a handful of players who could do this, including Katz and Euphemina.

“Can you open the warp gate for me?” He was merely asking just in case. Katz was aware that Beriache was just a soul. She might not be able to use proper magic. This was why he already started running even as he asked.

Then a warp gate opened in his path.

“”It is easy.””

***

“Is this possible...?”

“Really...”

It was over. This time, it was really over.

Baal, who repeatedly stood up without dying no matter what Grid did. The king of hell, who seemed to reign as the source of all evil and the object of eternal immortality and fear. He was slashed by Grid and silenced. Then he turned to gray ash.

The breaking news in reality and the epic in Satisfy announced Baal’s death to the whole world.

“Waaahhhhhhhh!”

“Sob...! Sob sob sob!!”

There were shouts of joy in reality and rivers of tears in Satisfy.

Death wasn’t the end, but the beginning of eternal torment...

The people who knew this truth and lived a life of despair were saved.

Sleepless parents worried about the fate of their children, children searched for ways for their parents, who would leave ahead of them to rest, young couples didn’t want to have children because they didn’t want to pass on this hopeless fate, single people felt even more anxious because they were alone, etc.

At the end of the day, everyone in the world was saved thanks to Grid and they were moved to tears. The excitement was so great that they couldn’t even raise their voices. It was also so great that they couldn’t believe it. People believed in Grid and followed him, saying he was their only hope, but they never thought that their generation would get their faith repaid so soon. They were ashamed by their lack of faith.

It happened when people reaffirmed that this wasn’t a dream, but a reality, and started to feel guilty toward Grid...

[You have suffered, Only One God Grid.]

A snow white woman—a pure and saintly looking being draped in a white cloth descended behind Grid.

[I expected you to be tired right after your fight with Baal, but I didn’t expect you to show me your back so easily. I can’t miss this opportunity from my perspective, so I am going to put restrictions on you so you can’t recover.]

Her existence was evil, contrary to her appearance.

The 2nd Great Demon, Amoract—the moment she appeared in the world, she threatened Grid in a very calm tone. She was already chanting a spell.

As she enticed Biban here, she immediately completed the spell to put pressure on Grid and weaken him. The face wrapped in white cloth was clearly smiling.

Baal—he was a guy who couldn’t be beaten. Amoract was fond of Grid who just got rid of him. She couldn’t hide her joy at the thought of not missing the opportunity that Grid had created for her to reign as the ruler of hell.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She hadn’t figured things out. Grid became stronger than she imagined in his fight with Baal. To be precise, he grew rapidly thanks to the result of killing Baal. He wasn’t tired at all. Everything that had been consumed in the course of fighting Baal had fully recovered. No, it was an evolution beyond recovery.

He leveled up in increments of 100. This not only restored the player, but it also had the effect of awakening his stats.

“...Uh?” Amoract groaned. It was a groan that came directly from her mouth.

She panicked as Defying the Natural Order was thrust into her heart.

The 9th awakening—Grid had broken through level 900 in the process of delivering the final blow to Baal.

“...W-What... Cough!”

The 10th awakening—as the result of the complete annihilation of Baal, he reached level 1,000. This was the value of the king of hell. A second-rate being who pretended to be dead in the shadow of the king didn’t deserve to play with Grid.

[Stat redistribution.]

Grid distributed all his stats to agility when attacking Amoract and now he redistributed his stats in real time. It was the utilization of common player characteristics.

A player who reached level 1,000 could redistribute their stats whenever they wanted and there was no restriction on the number of times... this was the first time Grid found out about this fact. Additionally, the privilege of the first achievement meant there was no restriction on the cooldown time that occurred every time the stats were redistributed.

[You have invested all your points in strength.]

Amoract’s body was split in half. She couldn’t bear the power contained in Grid’s sword, even as a naturally born Absolute.
