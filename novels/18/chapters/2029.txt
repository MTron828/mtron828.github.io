Chapter 2029

Help me.

Dominion’s brazen demand baffled Grid. Just how shameless was the God of War?

'...He has a reason to feel confident.’

After reflecting on Dominion's demand, Grid remembered the special nature of this situation. If Asura and Mumud really struck a secret contract with the demon cultivators, would Grid really turn a blind eye to Dominion’s request? No way. Grid’s primary goal was the destruction of the Full Moon Fortress. Dominion, knowing this, asked for help.

“This could be a trap,” Marie Rose warned.

“It’s unlikely, though.”

Marie Roses smiled. Her cold, soft fingers tickled Grid’s palm. She seemed to be advising him that it was okay to relax a bit. Grid responded with a smile and nodded.

‘Certainly, this doesn't seem to be a trap.’

Dominion confessed that he was trapped in this place. It was a very shocking confession to make considering his status. Asgard’s supreme god, who acted as Rebecca’s authority, claimed to have been trapped by someone else? No matter if this was true or not, the probability of his position being undermined was too high. There was no way Dominion would risk such a big loss just to trick Grid.

As long as Marie Rose was by Grid’s side, there was no guarantee that the God of War would be able to harm him after trapping him. Plus, Dominion had always been cautious. Since they met, Grid had rarely seen him act recklessly, except when he had suddenly thrown a javelin.

Dominion didn’t treat others with contempt or made enemies. The evidence to that was constantly being at odds with Judar, who had constantly resorted to using tricks. The attitude Dominion had had when confronting Chiyou at Reidan was also worth referencing.

‘Dominion is fundamentally different from Judar. He isn’t the adventurous type. He wouldn't have risked so much to dig a trap.’

Grid organized his thoughts before asking a question.

“Is there any way for us to get out of here?”

[You don’t have to do anything in particular. You can just leave. These chains only bind heavenly beings.]

“If that’s the case... Does that mean angels are also trapped? How did the angels who led me here remain outside instead of getting locked up in here?”

[They patrol the outskirts. They weren’t here when Mumud used his trick, so they were able to avoid these chains. But now...]

Dominion turned to look toward the angels who had led Grid here. Their limbs were also bound by new chains rising from the ground. They had just been singled out to be sealed.

‘How strange.’

Grid was once again suspicious.

‘Someone like Mumud would’ve considered the possibility of me coming to Asgard... Why doesn’t the sealing spell activate against me?’

Were the resources needed to create this spell so scarce that Mumud had to be sure that Grid would come to Asgard before setting up the spell to chain him as well? Or maybe Mumud wasn’t up to the task. What if the spell bound beings in response to a specific resource, such as the target’s divinity? Mumud had few opportunities to analyze Grid’s divinity, so he couldn’t have found a way to constrain it.

‘There is a good chance that it’s the second option. It would be difficult for even Mumud to create a local sealing spell that can bind everyone present.’

This was something not even Braham could do. Grid gave up on his suspicions.

“Can you tell me where Mumud and the demon cultivators are? Did you say that you can’t see what is going on outside because the water is murky?”

[If you are sure that they are building the Full Moon Fortress within Asgard, there are several possible areas they could be in.]

“Okay, then give me a list.”

[So, you want to help?]

“I’m not willing to keep the cultivators alive. I will eradicate them without allowing them to recover,” Grid said bluntly.

What if the opponent used their brain, like Judar? Grid couldn’t bring himself to use this situation as a means of striking a deal with Dominion. Rather, he thought that showing how sincere he was would be enough to gain the God of War’s trust. If Grid gained trust, he might be able to receive more help than expected.

As expected, Dominion was intrigued.

[What about cultivators in general?]

“Even though cultivators were born human, they don’t see people as human beings because they only pursue eternal life,” Grid briefly explained.

That was enough.

[Seeking eternal life as a human being... How strange. If they are dreaming of becoming gods, shouldn’t they take good care of others?]

“The means for them to gain eternal life is to cultivate a resource called spiritual energy, which requires endless study and discipline. They aren’t interested in people worshiping them.”

Metatron, who had been silently listening to Grid’s conversation with Dominion, suddenly interjected. [How selfish. As long as they don’t care about how people perceive them, they will keep becoming more malicious. I can see why you hate them, Grid.]

Red light shone through the cracks in Metatron’s face that was covered in dozens of wings. There was a flash of killing intent in their eyes.

Metatron also seemed quite displeased with the cultivators. They had different reasons than Grid, but Metatron also valued humanity. This made sense, given that heavenly gods were only strengthened with the worship of humanity.

Judar, who had betrayed humanity regardless, was definitely a fool. He said he did it because he was devastated after finding out that this world was just a game, but to Metatron, who didn’t know the truth, Judar simply looked like a madman. This was also the reason Metatron was gradually drawn to Dominion, who couldn’t hide his discomfort every time Judar made a decision.

Metatron was a strong supporter of Dominion. They even liked how he relied on Grid at this moment. The higher one’s status, the more they couldn’t allow themselves to be pretentious.

Metatron was slightly excited. The atmosphere was now less tense.

Dominion briefly placed a scroll of divinity on his forehead before handing it to Grid. [Take this.]

[Map of the Entire Region of Asgard has been acquired!]

[Map of the Entire Region of Asgard]

[Rating: Mythic.

This is a map that displays all the areas in Asgard.]

“Oh...”

Grid’s eyes widened when he acquired the map. He checked the added mini-map. The map that Dominion handed to him was perfect.

The Temple of Rebecca, the Eternal Prison where Zeratul, Khan and Hexetia had been imprisoned, the meeting hall of the gods, the surface-watching well, the ponds, lakes, rivers and dozens of side streets to enter Asgard... every area was clearly marked.

Grid looked a bit shaken.

“Aren’t you exposing too much information? Now that I have this map in my hands, the surface can raid Asgard at any time.”

[Now that Judar is gone, do you really have any reason to oppose Asgard?] Dominion wondered nonchalantly.

He seemed willing to accept any answer, which made Grid even more embarrassed.

“...I also have something to ask of you. Is Asgard not going to be hostile to the surface? Didn’t I resurrect the Refractive Dragon and kill Judar?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

[The Refractive Dragon was going to be resurrected anyway. The connection that you and the goddess formed after the Refractive Dragon reappeared is what matters.]

“......”

[More importantly, Asgard shouldn’t be hostile to the surface. Gods are valuable only when there are human beings worshiping them. At least, that is what the gods who are trapped here with me think. They are the ones who were brave enough to rebel against Judar, unlike me, who silently followed him.]

Metatron asked, [Didn’t you have to follow Judar’s orders to maintain order in Asgard? Don’t debase yourself.]

“......”

This situation was strange. Of course, Grid was hopeful that relations with Asgard would eventually improve. The abandonment of the tower created by Eat Spicy Jokbal after Judar’s death was a reflection of that hope.

However, he never imagined that such an ideal development awaited him. He hadn’t expected Dominion to think so differently from Judar.

Dominion locked eyes with Grid. [Have you made up your mind?]

The orange eyes of the God of War, obscured by the blazing light that was like flames, were honest and determined, contrary to Grid’s prejudices.

Grid sensed Marie Rose gripping his hand and came to his senses. He nodded. “As I said before, my purpose is to exterminate the cultivators. I will gladly help you.”

From the time that Dominion handed him the map, the possibility that this quest was a trap had been completely eliminated.

Metatron and the chief gods were surprised by Grid’s polite attitude. They were excited. [How can a man of such ill-conduct act like this...?]

Dominion suddenly stepped up to Grid and shook his hand. [Thank you. Please guide Asura and Mumud onto the right path.]

For Dominion, Grid represented salvation. The god was trapped here. He couldn’t do anything. He would need at least a month to break the seal without outside help, so Grid showing up was as great of a hope as the reunion with the goddess that he had been longing for. Thus, he was grateful.

For the sake of humanity, he also wished for the eradication of the cultivators. He was wary of Asura, who had been born from the malice Baal had gathered, and he was also worried about Mumud, who seemed to be influenced by Asura for some reason.

“I will try my best.”

Expectations, hopes, aspirations... The emotions in Dominion’s eyes were all too familiar to Grid. Unknowingly, he felt a greater sense of responsibility.

Marie Rose’s black hair tickled his cheek as he got lost in thought.

“Let’s stop worrying and go destroy the Full Moon Fortress.”

“Ah... Yes, that’s right.”

In any case, his goal was to destroy the Full Moon Fortress. Thanks to Marie Rose, Grid came to his senses and remembered his duty. He flew into the air. He examined the gods and angels who were bound and nailed to the ground because of the chains. All of them were strong. Yes, they were far from ordinary. They were in a bad spot now, but they were beings who could live comfortably forever. Once Grid left Satisfy, humanity would have to rely on them.

“I will try my hardest to capture the missing gods and angels alive.”

Please guide Asura and Mumud onto the right path.

This was what Dominion asked of him. The god wanted to see them alive as much as possible. From Grid’s perspective, it didn’t hurt to grant Dominion’s request. If he gained favor in advance, the possibility of the gods of Asgard taking care of the surface in the future would increase.

[Thank you.]

The gods expressed their gratitude again. Grid and Marie Rose left.

Dominion silently watched the purple and red beams of light move away like meteors before turning back to the gods.

[He is the first Only One God born since Chiyou. Now that I am indebted to him, I hope you will respect him as well.]

[I will keep that in mind.]

Thanks to Judar’s death, Asgard was definitely changing.
