Chapter 1809

“It looks like there is star candy on it...”

This was the sentiment of Peak Sword. It was while looking at Mercedes’ mace, ‘Innocent,’ which had beautiful thorns that looked like snow crystals.

Mercedes cocked her head. Her hair flowed over her collarbone and caught people’s attention. Somehow, she looked even more beautiful. She had entered her mental world with just Grid, so people wondered if it was the power of love.

“What is star candy?” Regas asked on behalf of Mercedes.

Peak Sword shrugged. “People who aren’t Korean citizens might not know. It is a delicacy among the biscuits supplied to the army. It is star-shaped candy made by melting sugar. It is one of the secrets to making the nation rich and its army powerful. It is a traditional treat that boosts the morale of Korean soldiers.”

“Traditional? Isn’t Japan the origin of star candy?”

“...What? Lauel, you have immigrated to Korea, but you are pro-Japanese? If you have to bring up the origin for no reason, Portugal is the origin, not Japan!”

“No, what...”

He was a light novel author, so why did he overreact every time the word Japan was mentioned?

‘Is he worried that the Korean Patriotic Association will be ruined if it is found out that he likes Japan?’

The Korean Patriotic Association—originally, it was just a small gathering, like a group of elderly people in a rural town. It was more like Peak Sword’s business card without any public credibility. Then as Satisfy’s popularity kept growing and Peak Sword became a ranker, the association’s recognition also rose. Once Peak Sword joined the Overgeared Guild, it became one of the representative groups of South Korea. The responsibility of the president, Peak Sword, was also quite heavy...

‘Why was the association created in the first place?’ Lauel suddenly became curious, but he didn’t bother to ask questions. He was a rational and reasonable person, and wouldn’t waste his energy on worthless things.

“Anyway... once you check Sariel’s mental world, will the exclusive weapons for the apostles be finished?”

“Yes, I will climb the tower after meeting Sariel.”

“Why am I ignored?”

A small head rose between Grid and Lauel as they chatted. It was Nefelina, the daughter of the Insane Dragon. She was polymorphed into the figure of a girl as usual and her cheeks were puffed up like balloons.

“Why aren’t you making my weapon?”

“Huh...? Of course it is because... you don’t use weapons, right?”

Grid thought of Nefelina as more of a vehicle. She was just a means to activate the Dragon Knight abilities and he had no intention of putting her on the front lines. The problem was that the level of the enemies Grid had to deal with was too high. As a hatchling, Nefelina was naturally awakened to providence and was often intimidated by the enemies Grid fought. Even if Grid pushed her to fight, she would ignore it and hide. What type of weapon could he make for her?

‘It is a waste of resources.’

Of course, Nefelina also had times when she fought directly. She helped using magic and Dragon Words, but it was only once in a while. Yes, she didn’t need any weapons.

“In the first place, you don’t have a mental world, right?”

In fact, dragons didn’t need a mental world. They were a creature that made whatever they said a reality. There was no need to wish for a miracle. They could do it themselves. There was no reason for their conscious and subconscious to be separated.

“You know me well.” Nefelina’s sulky face brightened like what just happened was a lie. She was glad to know that Grid wasn’t neglecting her out of indifference, but because he knew her too well.

“...Huah?”

Nefelina was smiling when she let out a rather ridiculous gasp. She was surprised by the killing intent that came at a completely unexpected timing. Mercedes was glaring at Nefelina like she wanted to kill her.

“......??”

Dozens of question marks repeatedly appeared and disappeared above the head of the dumbfounded Nefelina.

Grid was also puzzled. “What? Why are you suddenly acting like you saw your father?”

Did she feel signs of Nevartan’s invasion? Nefelina came to her senses while Grid was looking around their surroundings and she pointed a trembling finger at Mercedes. “S-She...”

“What about me?” The killing intent in Mercedes’ eyes was erased without a trace. Her friendly smile and the tilting of her head showed that she really didn’t know anything.

“?”

“??”

“???”

Nefelina, Grid, and the people around them didn’t understand the situation and were puzzled.

“I have answered God’s call.”

Then Sariel arrived at the scene. At first, she had a female figure. It was because Grid’s reaction was always bad when Sariel took on a male form. It was because he was too handsome. He used to raise Grid’s vigilance due to Grid’s instincts to protect his women. Therefore, Sariel stuck to the female form as much as possible when meeting Grid. Now Sariel naturally changed to a male form.

His eyes were fixed on Mercedes with some consternation. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“S-She is crazy,” Nefelina interjected.

She had been staring in a dumbfounded manner at Mercedes. She clearly witnessed the killing intent that appeared in Mercedes’ eyes again the moment Sariel appeared.

Then Mercedes started smiling again.

“What is it?”

“S-She became a monster...!”

“Calm down, Nefelina.”

Sariel calmed down Nefelina, who was gradually becoming pale. He noticed that Grid and the others weren’t aware of the situation.

“As you can feel, she has a terrible chill. I remember hearing rumors in the past about the existence of a snow woman with a frozen heart and no emotions. I almost remembered that monstrous being. It is my judgment that it is better not to be involved. It is right to distinguish her as a cold weapon, not an apostle like us.”

Whisper whisper.

Sariel’s voice was very soft as she whispered in the ears of Nefelina, who was trembling in anger. However, it was a voice that could reach Grid, an Absolute.

Sariel knew this. The problem was that Mercedes knew it as well. From the moment Sariel brought his mouth to Nefelina’s ear, Mercedes moved her red snowflakes to attract people’s attention.

“There must be a more beautiful concept in Sariel’s mental world, right? Sariel has a good heart, unlike normal angels.”

“Certainly...”

The anticipation of the Overgeared members was amplified.

Innocent—it was more beautiful when it was a mace than when it was a sword. It was because each red crystal clinging to the mace was as pretty as the work of a master craftsman. Some humans with a poor ability to respond to others talked about star candy, but in any case, the snowflakes were a concept that bloomed in Mercedes’ mental world. It was a mental world that would be very noble considering Mercedes’ usual image. The weapon had the name Innocent attached to it for a reason.

Expectations rose that Sariel’s mental world would also produce extremely beautiful results.

‘I hope so.’

Grid was also full of expectations. In fact, it was more like a wish than an expectation. He didn’t show it, but Grid was very tired after experiencing the mental worlds of the apostles one after another. Most of the mental worlds of the apostles were dark.

Mercedes’ mental world—full of pretenses—was far from bright. There were too many negative emotions that Grid got from interacting with them. Was it like when he thought of Ahyoung’s face and name when he was spacing out in the shower? To be exact, it was himself who proposed to Ahyoung at the sushi restaurant...

He thought about getting married just because they ate together once...

“...Shall we start?” Grid managed to barely swallow down the scream that almost came out and asked Sariel. Sariel was still in male form, but Grid couldn’t afford to care about this. In the first place, Sariel was equally beautiful when male and female. It was hard to distinguish unless he looked closely.

“Yes.” Sariel nodded. There were no signs of hesitation.

Grid felt a sensation like his body was floating and a golden wave spread across his field of view.

Divine clouds—they were the symbol of Asgard.

[You have entered Sariel’s mental world, ‘World of the Unqualified.’]

“As God knows, my memory isn’t perfect.”

Sariel had suffered from one corruption after another. First, he was expelled from Asgard and disqualified as an angel. Secondly, his memory was sealed and he became a demon, going on a rampage and dying. Thirdly, he lost himself completely and spent time in the Abyss. In the process, Sariel’s soul was torn apart several times. There was no way his memory could be complete. Just regaining his original self was in the realm of a miracle.

“But nevertheless—”

A halo of brilliant light and wings spread out. Sariel’s pupils expanded widely as he stood beside Grid. At the same time, Grid’s field of view also widened. He saw huge shadows lurking beyond the golden clouds. It was the image of the gods.

“I remember their sins.”

Sariel’s long and thin finger pointed to the highest point.

“A being who didn’t take responsibility for the lives she made, for the world.”

Next, he pointed below.

“The one who took advantage of the moment when the highest being turned away and pretended to be noble.”

He moved his finger down again.

“A stingy being despite holding great authority.”

Down again.

“The one who reached the point of being too lustful to be unable to discern reason.”

Below again.

“The one who envies those who should be protected. The greedy one. The angry one.”

Sariel pointed out the images of the seven gods in turn and came to one conclusion.

“They are all useless. If they don’t correct it, then they aren’t worth existing. However, they’ve already refused to correct it.”

Wicked Eye—Sariel’s eyes revealed the target’s sin. The highest god made it so. Yet when Sariel revealed the sins of the gods, the highest god who made Sariel turned away from Sariel, just like she turned away from everything else.

“I’m sorry. My mental world is bright and brilliant only on the outside. It is actually a world full of hatred and resentment.”

“...Why should you be sorry?”

Grid’s face turned white as he smiled bitterly.

Anger, hatred, resentment, lamentation—all sorts of distressed feelings penetrated his heart, but he didn’t show signs that it was difficult.

“The shadow of the envious one is hazy. Does it have anything to do with Hexetia being reformed?”

“...Probably. I could feel my body and mind becoming lighter when God Hexetia reflected on his sins and followed you down to the Overgeared World.”

“Yes... I’ll do my best for you until I get rid of the other six gods or reform them.”

“Huh? N-No. You don’t have to...”

“No, this is my duty.”

Grid pulled out an anvil and hammer. It was a place where the imaginary gods created waves of unclean power, so it was particularly painful compared to the mental worlds of the other apostles. It was to the point where he was certain that any unauthorized person who broke in would surely die. In order to quickly get out of here, Grid hurriedly activated Intent Production.

“You must have reasonable strength in order to exercise your duty, right?”

“...Yes.”

The mental worlds of the two people united. It wasn’t until today that the apostles of Grid became complete. It was to the extent where they could be proud of being apostles of an Only One God in the world.
