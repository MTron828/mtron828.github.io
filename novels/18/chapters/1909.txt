Chapter 1909

“So... Rebecca and Yatan’s reset of the world wasn’t an ‘original setting,’ but a bug?”

“You finally understand. You had a hard time understanding.”

“Haha, why are you so... Wait? Are you making fun of me right now?” Vantner exclaimed. By this point, the members of the Overgeared Guild me,had completed their assessment of the situation.

“It is amazing that the dragons are on the players’ side.”

“More than that, isn’t it correct to say that they are the S.A Group’s livestock?”

“It reminds me of what Chairman Lim said a long time ago. Didn’t they say that dragons were creatures not made to be killed? Now that I see it, these words are quite meaningful.”

“Then what is the Dragon Slayer? Is SIr Hayate a bug?”

“I wonder if that is it. Rebecca’s will must’ve twisted the whole setup.”

It was pitiful. The Goddess realized that this world was just a game and fought for their dignity, so that the beings living in this world didn’t despair.

They understood Grid’s feelings when he decided to stand by her side. They understood the reason. If the Empire cooperated with the dragons, it might be surprisingly easy to punish Rebecca, but then Satisfy’s ‘future’ would disappear. The world wouldn’t be the Satisfy they had been experiencing.

‘Wasn’t it actually Rebecca’s arrangement that the named NPCs received a ridiculous level correction?’

“If the Absolute who protects NPCs disappears, there will be a negative chain effect.”

Morpheus would take 100% control of the system. NPCs would be coordinated and controlled solely to the players’ liking. They would be reduced to tools and devices, just like NPCs in normal games. If they weren’t respected as human beings and had all sorts of questions, they would surely collapse on their own one day.

Lauel imagined it. NPCS who were treated as livestock would realize that they were only in a game. Then they would end their lives as a group. This would be a recurring event even if the S.A Group created new NPCs. Of course, they would create a system that protected NPCs as soon as they figured out the problem, but players who had already broken their immersion once would never see NPCs as humans again.

The green scenery, the smell of the scenery, and the chirping of birds—it would all lose its value, no matter how much it was implemented in the same way as reality.

“However, people’s perceptions have changed quite a bit these days, right? I don’t think they will harm NPCs for no reason just because NPCs are no longer protected by the system.”

“That’s right. There are a lot of people like Grid...”

“Even looking at the news right now, the minority is always a problem. Plus, the players are too strong. Given enough time, just a dozen players can easily conquer a city. Even if they die, they will continue to resurrect and consume their opponents. How can they be handled?”

“Indeed... there are quite a few people who can overthrow not just a city, but also a nation.”

“...Kraugel, can I also go with you?” Yura followed Kraugel, who got up from his seat as the conversation between the members of the Overgeared Guild was proceeding seriously, and asked this question. She knew that his destination was the Tower of Wisdom.

“Under the circumstances, the dragons’ species traits will change completely. They won’t hurt each other any longer and will gather together.”

Additionally, the first place they would target was the Tower of Wisdom. There was no way they could afford to let the Dragon Slayer go.

Yura decided that the Tower of Wisdom should be guarded. It was obvious that Grid’s position would be in jeopardy the moment the tower collapsed. The reason why the entire Overgeared Guild didn’t move there was because the Tower of Wisdom had the attribute of not being able to be observed. Even if dozens of dragons put their heads together and tried to come up with a plan, they wouldn’t be able to easily find the Tower of Wisdom. No, it had to be like that.

Just then—

“Bunhelier...” Kraugel murmured. He looked very shocked.

“The tower is in danger.”

Kraugel’s voice was just as charismatic as Grid’s voice. He just had to raise his voice a bit and he could catch the attention of those around him.

Everyone’s eyes focused on him.

“Bunhelier knows the location of the tower.”

Shocking words followed. Shouts exploded from everywhere and Lauel summoned the Tomb of the Gods.

“Be prepared to die twice a day. Even if we are destroyed, Hayate and Biban must be saved.”

The Prime Minister of the Empire—the person in power, who was below only one person and above many people, set out personally. It was to add his own meager strength. He knew he couldn’t count on help from Grid in the current situation. This was thanks to his habit of always thoroughly calculating things.

***

[The three of us can cooperate...? I see. Chiyou, you weren’t on Rebecca’s side. You are just doing this to increase the chances of death.]

A strange sight was occurring in the sky. The fragments of the moon, which were forming the Milky Way, moved backwards in time and the broken moon was restored.

Nevartan and Chiyou took it lightly. Surprisingly, Grid didn’t pay attention to it either.

‘It is the protection of the system.’

In the worldview, these phenomena were described as the ‘providence of the universe.’ It worked for the maintenance of the world. In short, Morpheus didn’t allow the collapse of the only remaining moon.

[Chiyou, I will fight you at any time later. Get out of the way today. I’ll be content to take Hanul with me.]

“Are you ignoring Grid now?” Nevartan’s attitude of focusing only on Chiyou poked Nefelina’s heart. She released Polymorph, revealing the shape of a small and precious dragon. Then she opened wide her sharp eyes.

[You are my bloodline, so it isn’t like you are low in intelligence... are you maliciously interpreting it?]

Nevartan found it pathetic and puffed out smoke from his nose.

[Your ‘family’ must’ve rushed here to stop the destruction of the continent, right? If I stop fighting with Chiyou and accomplish my goal, that is also fulfilling the will of your ‘family.’ What justification do you have to fight?]

It was Nevartan who emphasized the word ‘family’ with great force. He looked a bit hurt and Grid was embarrassed by the words. At this moment—

[Additionally, your ‘family’ has reached his limits.]

Nevartan said something meaningful.

Grid was startled by the words. Eyes that captured the universe, just like the other Old Dragons—he could clearly feel that Nevartan’s huge eyes were contemplating him. He got goosebumps.

[Don’t you have to leave soon? I can’t give you any attention.]

It was over.

[There is one minute left until your daily connection time limit.]

The notification window that was only visible in Grid’s eyes was being updated. It was predictable. Grid visited the Blue Dragon and the dimensional gap, defeated the imoogi and King Sobyeol, and came here shortly after meeting Rebecca.

It was the limit of a player. His access time was coming to an end.

Nevartan was aware of that.

“Martial God Chiyou.”

59 seconds.

Grid drew Twilight and Defying the Natural Order. The momentum was beyond a modest level and reached killing intent. He didn’t show any of the mental fatigue from acting non-stop for several days.

“If you really want to die, make me grow more.”

Click.

Two swords became one. The wavelength alone stirred the atmosphere. It was the sword energy of the one who saved humanity by punishing the ruler of hell. The target had to be alarmed.

However, Nevartan and Chiyou were calm. They expressed their majesty with ordinary expressions.

Grid opened his mouth. “I think an Old Dragon will be enough nourishment for me, right?

“Who knows... it would be better for me to cooperate with the Old Dragons and Hanul than to give you the Old Dragons as nutrients.” Chiyou had only been obsessed with Grid when facing the gods of Asgard. Now it was different. On the contrary, Grid wasn’t of any interest. Chiyou judged that the value of the Old Dragons and Hanul was higher than Grid.

“Nevartan.”

48 seconds.

Grid wasn’t flustered.

“Chiyou has seen through the fact that I am falsely cooperating with Rebecca.”

He just took advantage of the developments that flowed in an unwanted direction.

Jingle.

The bells all over Chiyou’s body vibrated. It was a vibration created by a combination of him tilting his head in confusion and the false laugh he gave after realizing the situation.

Nevartan snorted.

[You are falsely cooperating with Rebecca? If that is the case, you wouldn’t have missed the opportunity Chiyou gave you. However, you acted hastily without waiting until Hanul stood on our side. Be mindful of trivial tricks. There is a limit to my respect for you.]

“Hanul won’t stand on our side even if I waited.”

43 seconds.

Grid didn’t have time to feel resentment toward the fast-moving time. He just accelerated his heated mind to the next level and tried to figure out the best action. He had the mindset to worship Lauel and Huroi, who solved all sorts of situations with just a few words, as teachers.

It was just as he declared to Nefelina. He was determined to persuade Bunhelier and the Old Dragons. He realized he would have to use force if he got it wrong, but he basically needed to know how to speak a different language.

“Hanul covets Rebecca’s light.”

Transparent eyes—there were no lies in Grid’s eyes at this moment. Putting aside his intentions, he was telling the truth.

“That is why he is buying time without leaving Chiyou’s side. It is the time required to acquire the light stored in the dimensional gap.”

[It is a good thing if Hanul, an ally, gets his hands on the power of light.]

Nevartan was completely unperturbed. He didn’t know what tricks Hanul was doing in the dimensional gap, but he didn’t suspect that Hanul would harm the world.

Grid asked, “Do you really believe that Hanul has been corrected?”

[......?]

32 seconds.

“He might be less powerful than Rebecca, but his hierarchy is the same. Isn’t it arrogant to believe that you can perfectly comprehend and control his heart when he has lived since the beginning of time?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

[...I need proof that Hanul is trying to get the light.]

Grid succeeded. He made Nevartan have reasonable doubts and elicited the desired response.

“129°3...” Grid gave the coordinates he remembered.

“......” Chiyou just watched. It was because he noticed that Grid’s intention was just to ‘move the battlefield.’ It wasn’t a hindrance, so he stood on the sidelines.

Nevartan used Teleport. Chiyou and Nefelina, who was carrying Grid, also chased after him.

The place where they arrived was in front of the gap of some dimension. It was the place where Hanul’s heart, which was repeatedly being destroyed by the light and restored, was located. It was outside the continent. The scenery beneath their feet was the sea.

[It can’t be seen from the outside.]

It was a separate dimension but it was bizarrely secretive. It gave Nevartan greater doubts and he was about to enter the dimensional gap.

“Kill me to enter here.” Then Chiyou blocked the entrance.

Nevartan frowned.

‘What is really going on in this world...?’ His eyes seemed to be saying this.

[Grid, I think it is better for us to cooperate here. Our relationship can be re-established later.]

Finally, Nevartan bowed his pride.

2 seconds.

“I don’t have any time left.” Grid bluntly refused. “If you need it, you can call the other Old Dragons. That is the only way now.”

[......]

The truth that wasn’t a lie—The insightful Nevartan couldn’t say anything else.

“I wish you luck.”

[You will be forcibly logged out after exceeding the connection timeout.]

Grid disappeared from the scene without a trace.

“Follow Grid’s advice and call the other Old Dragons.” Chiyou was very happy about this situation. “That is the only way you can stop Hanul, who is playing tricks in here.”

He decided to match Grid’s rhythm in order to increase the chances of death.
