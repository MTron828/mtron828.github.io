Chapter 1762

The yangbans were a symbol of will—it was Hanul’s will to challenge Rebecca’s authority.

It was also a symbol of a pledge—it was a pledge to kill Martial God Chiyou. This was the pledge that Hanul had made when he asked Chiyou for help. It was the secret story that served as the background for the yangbans to realize the qualifications of a God Killer. There were some yangbans born with the qualification to kill a god as a ‘talent.’

Baal knew this fact as well.

“Yangban Mir... that’s right. I am your diametric opposite. We are bound by a great destiny.”

Thus, Baal laughed. He greatly welcomed Mir, unlike Raphael who treated the yangbans as disgusting clones. It was because he remembered the soul of Yangban Garam, which he had finally started to digest recently. Garam had the qualification of a God Killer, albeit it was faint.

It was a qualification that would be a great help when fighting Grid again in the future. Wouldn’t the qualification of a God Killer be several times more powerful if he could ingest the soul of Mir, who was the strongest among the yangbans?

It happened the moment when he anticipated it...

A subtle smile appeared on Baal’s face, only for his expression to harden. It was due to Mir’s surprisingly fast swordsmanship.

‘Why?’

It was true that Mir was created to be the opponent of Baal and Raphael. However, most of the world’s results had a different value than what the creator intended.

A half-god created using angels and humans as motifs and forcibly bestowed with divinity—the yangbans were nothing more than Hanul’s lab rats and there was no originality.

In other words, they were a fake from one to ten. It was actually absurd that he dared to confront Baal, the son of Yatan. Yet at this moment, Mir showed a higher level of skills than the other apostles. The speed and destructive power of his swordsmanship, combined with his techniques, gradually made Baal step back. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Finally, Baal had to take a large step back. It was in order to shake off Mir’s sword.

Mir caught up with him in an instant. He used Lightning God to launch an offensive on Baal without giving him a chance to think. The basis of the swordsmanship he used was Muller’s Matchless Sword. It wasn’t exactly like Muller's swordsmanship. Just like the modern day Sword Saint Kraugel, he introduced a new swordsmanship that reinterpreted the Matchless Sword.

A long time ago—

It was a swordsmanship devised based on his experience of fighting Muller several times.

Today—

Mir regained all the memories he had lost and recalled the traces of the sword left on his body. He recalled Muller’s swordsmanship, which he couldn’t stop or avoid. Then he recreated it in a new manner based on the wounds carved on his body.

“Kuaaaaaah!!!” Baal roared as he was pushed back.

From the time he appeared to the present, not a single thing went according to his will and his anger soared. He had put all things in the world on the palm of his hand and kneaded them as he pleased. When had he ever suffered such humiliation?

Since when did this happen? As expected, it was Grid. That person called Grid ruined everything.

“It would’ve been better if it had gone easily from the start...!”

Baal’s right arm swelled up unevenly. His muscles expanded like they were going to explode in the aftermath of him raising the power of the sword.

“500,000 Army.”

“......!”

“......!”

“Avoid it!”

It was 500,000 army swordsmanship, not one million. It was a precursor to the technique that proved that Baal’s current state wasn’t perfect. In the first place, the red flesh only made this place a ‘hell-like’ environment. It didn’t completely make it hell. Furthermore, Piaro had changed the environment once.

The time for Baal to manifest the greatness of an Absolute was extremely short. However, Baal judged that this condition was sufficient.

500,000 Army Death Sword—he didn’t know about the apostles, but he believed that all the small fries would die. There would be huge aftereffects so he wouldn’t be safe either, but that was okay. If he could take away a lot of people in exchange for one life, it was never a loss.

“Death Sword.”

The sword energies overlapped one after another.

Horizontally and vertically—the sword energies seemed to form iron bars that blocked all escape routes and would shatter the beings trapped inside this space.

“Idiot.” Someone scolded him in a situation where screams should’ve erupted.

Baal’s gaze naturally turned to Huroi, but Huroi felt it was unfair. Baal’s gaze was lost for a moment before belatedly falling on a gorgeous woman. It was a woman with a huge Red Phoenix behind her and fluttering red hair that was darker than flames. It was Bow Saint Jishuka who Baal was very familiar with.

She raised her middle finger and mocked Baal. “We won’t go to hell even if we die.”

“...Bah.” Baal also knew this. He didn’t know about the concept of a player, but he was aware of the fact that humans of this age could be resurrected even if they died.

“My purpose isn’t you guys.”

The liches and death knights of the No Offspring Tomb were projected on the eyes of Baal, who smiled triumphantly. The seeds that had been planted by Baal a long time ago—they were originally those who should be nourishing Baal. They became undead due to the Specter rather than dying, but now they had stepped on the path of ‘death.’

The iron bars made of sword energy that made it impossible for them to run away—the 500,000 Army Death Sword that Baal deployed at the cost of his right arm dyed the area in a bright light. It was a light that erased everything it touched without a trace.

In terms of power, the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship was the strongest. There was already a history of being destroyed by Grid once, but that was a variable created by ‘someone’s will’ in Grid’s mental image. Ordinary beings couldn’t withstand this power.

Of course, Grid’s apostles would be able to endure it. However, it was all they could do to keep their body intact. They didn’t have room to protect the Overgeared members, the undead of the No Offspring Tomb, and Sword Saint Muller, who was paralyzed by the heart demon backlash.

Baal focused on the remaining variables.

First of all, there was Braham. He was paying the price for pouring out so much magic toward Baal. There was no need to be vigilant yet. All that was left was Sword Saint Muller. It would be a disaster if his sword cut through even the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship. Baal also needed to be wary of Mir, who embodied Muller’s swordsmanship.

Baal, who had soared into the air to shake off Mir, descended like a lightning bolt. Demonic energy spurted from his severed arm instead of blood, flapped like a cloak, and wrapped around him.

“Keuk...!”

Kraugel was stabbed properly as he was preparing the Space Sword to slash the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship. The moment he read Baal’s approach with his Super Sensitivity, Baal had already pierced him in the heart and consumed his immortality. To make matters worse, his skill casting was canceled.

Mir was following Baal and managed to rescue Kraugel. He cut off Baal’s remaining left arm with the Blue Dragon Dao surrounded by lightning energy.

The problem was that Baal was already ready to die. It meant he had in mind the fact that Grid might come the moment he planned to use the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship to smash through the entire space. He had only one purpose. It was to cause as many casualties as possible.

Baal’s head was full of thoughts of filling his stomach with all the prey overflowing in the No Offspring Tomb. He made no efforts to save his life and this became a powerful weapon.

Baal’s sharp teeth bit Mir’s neck. The moment his arm was cut off, he had bent his back and counterattacked. It was a primitive form of attack that was hard to predict. The flustered Mir tried to shake him off, but Baal held on tenaciously.

Demonic energy was rising endlessly from his severed arms. It went beyond the level of a cloak and spread out like wings. It worked as a field that weakened the power of attributes other than the dark attribute.

Due to the weakening of the environment, he lost his qualifications as an Absolute and even lost his super fast recovery. This made him instead focus on the operation of demonic energy. It was trickier to deal with him like this than when he was trying to suppress them with force.

“It is the end,” Baal whispered grimly while still biting Mir’s neck. He moved at a transcendent speed and the iron bars made of sword energy were about to hit the Overgeared members and the undead.

Baal thought it was truly over. This was until a completely unexpected presence intervened.

“...You?”

Had Grid already arrived here when he had been deep underground?

No.

Did the Lightning God of Titan come to support at the right time?

That also wasn’t the case.

Naturally, the members of the Tower of Wisdom didn’t act either.

The one who disturbed Baal at this moment was none other than...

“You...! The old dragon’s daughter!”

It was Nefelina, one of Grid’s apostles. She had stood at a distance and held her breath while the other apostles were fighting valiantly. Now she surprisingly stood facing Baal. The breathing coming from her open mouth was informing Baal of the origin of the Breath that broke through the iron bars of sword energy just a moment ago.

“You are just a mere hatchling, what did you do?” Baal’s temples twitched. His eyes were bloodshot as if his patience had reached the limit. The sharp teeth biting Mir’s neck were grinding down.

“Hiccup!”

Nefelina’s large eyes shimmered with transparent tears.

A Transcendent Dragon—she compressed the years to just a minute and exerted a power close to a saint-class dragon. [1]

She was the daughter of an old dragon. The Breathe she fired was enough to offset the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship that contained such a strong power. However, Nefelina couldn’t feel proud and instead trembled. She couldn’t fully handle Baal’s killing intent.

By her side—

“Well done.”

“It was great.”

“Hmm, not bad.”

The apostles were gathered. They were all covered with wounds. Nevertheless, it was reassuring enough.

Nefelina’s trembling little body gradually calmed down. “I-I tried so that Grid won’t feel sad.”

“It is extraordinary.”

The Overgeared members and the undead of the No Offspring Tomb were also present.

Jishuka approached and stroked Nefelina’s hair. Then she aimed at Baal and pulled the bowstring. “Die.”

There was no room for negotiation. There was only one reason why the apostles and Overgeared members were overwhelmed by Baal. It was because Baal used the ‘Realm of the Absolute.’ However, he couldn’t use it properly after Piaro changed the environment once.

The possibility of a ‘fight’ was established.

“...Kuk! Kukuk! Kuhahahaa! It is crazy! The world is going crazy!”

The one who deceived a God of the Beginning and took control of hell—he was unable to handle a single force from the surface and was on the defensive?

“This is by no means a normal phenomenon. Something is terribly wrong. There is bound to be a backlash that even I can’t imagine...”

Baal’s rant couldn’t continue to the end. It was because Jishuka’s arrow pierced his forehead and his neck was cut by Mercedes’ sword.

[The raid of the 1st Great Demon, ‘Baal,’ has succeeded!]

The apostles and the Overgeared members got a great achievement without Grid. It was a transformation caused by Grid.
