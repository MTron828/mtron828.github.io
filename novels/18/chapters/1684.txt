Chapter 1684

From the little things to the private details—there were many ways in which a couple checked their compatibility.

In that sense, Grid and Yura were a well-matched couple. Not only did the two of them like every aspect of each other, but their fates were intertwined, even in Satisfy. Their final class quest was similar. Grid had to rescue Pagma’s soul from Baal, while Yura had to rescue Alex’s soul from Baal.

It wasn’t a very good thing to have in common. Their class quests were impossible for a single player to handle. It was wise to give up while taking comfort in the fact that there was no guarantee the new skills they would gain from completing the class quest was worth more than a few lives.

Unfortunately, the two people were persistent. Yura gathered information by interacting with demons, such as Red Demon Glant, and she had been trying to rescue Alex’s soul without necessarily having to fight Baal. Meanwhile, Grid had grown in strength with the idea of getting rid of Baal.

Baal was destined to one day clash with the two of them.

-This isn’t a very wise method since it is just accumulating experience for Baal.

-Baal is developing just as much as you are growing.

-Everything that Baal learns during his trials also nourishes that chunk of red flesh.

Pagma’s soul and Alex’s soul took advantage of Baal’s weakness to regain their sense of reason and to speak. Their caution and warnings aroused Grid’s annoyance.

“Then what do you want me to do? Should I not fight and let go?”

The attitude of his seniors, who only gave warnings without providing a solution, was unpleasant for Grid. This was nagging, not advice.

“If you have time for useless words, then you should let me know how to free you.”

-Hah... You are truly Pagma's Successor.

-What do you mean?

-His rude and ferocious personality really resembles you, Pagma. Doesn’t the fact that your personalities are so similar even though you don’t have a blood relationship mean there is a problem with the sword dances? It seems to have the side effect of making the user’s temperament more domineering...

-Stop the speculation.

-You said that your sword dance comes from a ritual that the yangban used for their ceremonies, right? Ultimately, it must’ve been a means of contacting Hanul. Does this side effect mean that God Hanul himself isn’t right...

-It is okay to curse Hanul, but I hate that you used it as a means to insult me. I would’ve made you shut your mouth if I had hands and feet.

“......”

Grid and Yura’s steps as they headed for the hell gate right in front of their noses slowed down for a moment. It was because the illusions they secretly had of the predecessors were shattered. Of course, Grid knew that Pagma had a ruthless personality, but in any case, he was a hero who fought for humanity. He hadn’t expected Pagma to be so blatantly wild and emotional. In the first place, it didn’t match his elegant appearance. It was also hard to see Alex’s personality as good when Alex clearly knew Pagma’s personality and provoked him.

Grid felt pure doubts and murmured, “He doesn’t have the personality to be friends with Braham...”

To put it bluntly, Braham had a bad personality. He had improved a lot these days, but in the past, he didn’t care about others at all and lived purely according to his own tastes. A person naturally had to be broad-minded to be friends with Braham.

‘Like me.’

On the other hand, Pagma’s personality seemed to resemble Braham’s. It seemed like they would growl just by making eye contact with each other. Then how did it develop into a relationship where he was Braham’s most trusted friend?

Pagma answered Grid’s question.

-As you know, Braham was arrogant and made frequent mistakes. It was easy to grab a weakness. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“......”

Was it a friendship built up by gaslighting? Grid was thinking about the crime of grooming with a dismayed expression when Pagma’s bitter voice entered his ears.

-I’m glad he has a good friend like you, even if it is late.

Pagma’s soul and Alex’s soul had never actually lost their sense of reason. Rather, they had always maintained a clear mind and felt Baal’s despair and pain. This was why they always screamed. Pagma had watched in pain the sight of Grid fighting for others at any time and under any circumstances.

Grid was clearly different from him, who sacrificed innocent people under the pretext of a cause. It was probably the result of the differences in their origin. It was said that Pagma had experienced the life of the weak when living among the yangbans, but in the end, he was still different from a human. There were many areas where he wasn’t emotionally compatible with them. Therefore, he often made the wrong choice and repeatedly regretted it over and over.

On the other hand, Grid was a completely normal human being. He communicated with many people much more easily than Pagma.

-Your existence isn’t a blessing just for Braham, but for all of humanity. I admire and envy you... Ugh...

Pagma’s words abruptly stopped. His groan, which sounded like he was being mutilated by a sword, hinted at Baal’s resurrection. He was still alive and well despite already suffering a few deaths. Rather, Baal, who became stronger as he learned, resembled a player.

Grid trembled when he realized how great Baal was. The strongest people in human history, who dominated an era and eventually became legends, were captured by Baal in such an insignificant way. Pagma and Alex, who trembled in pain without being comfortable for a moment, recalled the fear that they had been trying to suppress.

There was a voice that awakened him. “Youngwoo-ssi!”

“...Ah.” Grid reflexively reached out. At the same time, the demon sword that pierced his abdomen tilted diagonally just before it separated his upper and lower body. Grid was pulled by Yura and succeeded in escaping to the surface through the hell gate.

“Y-Your Majesty!”

“God...!”

Unfortunately, the place where he landed was bad.

At the temple of the Overgeared God, in the Overgeared World....

The imperial subjects were praying under Damian’s leadership and they became agitated when they witnessed the seriously injured Grid.

“Look at this! Our god has once again punished the evil demon Baal and returned in a dignified manner!”

Damian and Sariel quickly acted. Damian took off his uniform and spread it out like a veil, hiding Grid’s appearance. Meanwhile, Sariel used that short gap to restore Grid with magic. Then with Damian’s next shout—

Ta da! Grid reappeared with the feeling of ‘aha!’ and was unscathed without a single wound.

It happened in an instant. People were confused, but they had no choice but to think the Grid they saw a moment ago was their illusion.

‘Isn’t this the leader of a pseudo-religion?’

Grid clicked his tongue as he watched Damian secretly smiling. Then he waved toward the cheering people as a response. After a while, he arrived at the smithy and told Yura his honest feelings.

“Is there no answer?”

“......”

In fact, he had noticed it little by little. Just as Grid’s level got higher the more he fought Baal, Baal had also learned combat skills. The number of times that Grid’s six fusion sword dance missed in vain gradually increased. Still, it was okay.

If he killed Baal a few more times, then Baal’s status would be undermined at some point. From then on, Grid would gradually gain an advantage... he used this thought as consolation, but there were no signs that Baal’s status was being undermined. Additionally, he learned the shocking truth that the red chunk of flesh was learning from Baal’s experience.

He didn’t show it on his face in front of Pagma’s soul, but honestly, he felt his vision darken.

Grid lowered his head with a sense of loss. Yura quietly stroked his head and spoke cautiously, “How about not giving Baal a chance to learn?”

“...Through what means?”

“Fight in a different way every time. For example, equip an item with a different function every time you challenge Baal. Then Baal won’t have a chance to adapt... I’m sorry.”

Yura was eagerly explaining only to hurriedly close her mouth. It was because she knew the pain of creation. How easy could it be to create new and different items every time? She felt guilty when she realized that she had almost imposed too much responsibility on Grid.

Grid grabbed her hands. “Thank you.”

Creating something out of nothing and forcing a new attack strategy on the target—it was a method that could only be used by Overgeared God Grid and the blacksmithing god Hexetia. Of course, it was true that the burden was high. It required infinite deliberation. Even so, Grid didn’t mind.

“That’s right. I forgot the most basic thing.”

He should actively utilize his strengths. Was it because he relied on Request to Stand With Me through the fight against Baal? He became accustomed to borrowing the power of the apostles and tower members and didn’t consider using items. It could be a side effect of perceiving the items he was currently armed with as endgame items.

Grid stood up. Yura was shocked to see him preparing to leave even though the immortality cooldown hadn’t ended.

Grid reassured her, “I am going to the East Continent, not hell.”

There were still two of the Four Auspicious Beasts that Grid hadn’t saved. Among them, Grid coveted the Blue Dragon. It was judged that the Blue Dragon’s lightning was the most suitable attribute to hurt Baal’s mental image that harbored a cold chill.

‘Another method is to ask Braham to attribute lightning magic to Twilight.’

However, there wasn’t the lightning attribute among the great magic that Braham used. It meant he would have to receive an insignificant magic if he wanted Braham’s help to attach the lightning attribute to Twilight. This was very regrettable. On the other hand, the Blue Dragon was the god of lightning. There was a limit to the lightning power gained from the Blue Dragon’s Boots, so it didn’t have much power against Baal. However, he was sure that the lightning power he obtained from the Blue Dragon would be different.

“Reinhardt’s defense?”

“There is Sticks, so it is fine. I can come and go at any time.”

“Ah...”

The transportation vehicle...

After a long and peaceful time at the Overgeared Academy, Sticks would once again be used as a tool.

***

“Request to Stand With Me.”

Grid arrived in Kaya on the East Continent with the help of Sticks and didn’t delay for even a moment.

“Keen Insight.”

He immediately borrowed Mercedes’ power to search for the exact location of the Blue Dragon. To be precise, it was the location of the Blue Dragon Dao where the Blue Dragon was sealed. He naturally felt a familiar aura. “Mir...”

A person he was unintentionally deeply connected with. Maybe he had been putting off saving the Blue Dragon because he didn’t want to fight Mir—Grid had this thought and moved toward the center of the desert that was covered with snow.

***

At the same time...

“It has been a while since I’ve given you my greetings.”

Mercedes returned to her home after decades and bowed her head like a criminal while giving her greetings. It was a habit that arose from an early age due to the attitudes of her family, who hated making eye contact with her. The days when her ‘eyes’ were weak. They were the days when she couldn’t control it, so she unintentionally peeked into the secrets and innermost thoughts of her precious family, to their displeasure. This was why they felt reluctant and fearful toward each other.

“What brings you here...?” They didn’t even welcome her or ask her how she had been. The elderly couple treated their one remaining daughter like she was a complete stranger. Mercedes’ status as a knight and the new emperor’s concubine give justification to the couple’s indifferent attitude.

“I would like to take the head of the family’s test.” Mercedes mustered up the courage to speak.

It happened shortly after she was asked to lend Keen Insight to Grid. This allowed her to temporarily overcome her trauma and raise her head. For the first time, she could see her parents’ old and dwarfed appearance, who flinched when they made eye contact with her.

“...Now I can bear the sins of our family.”

Most people didn’t know the truth, but the Vaintz family’s two swords actually meant slaughter. Back in her childhood, it was something that was difficult to understand and handle for Mercedes, who was taken by Piaro after being abandoned by her parents and raised to be a knight that protected the emperor and the nation. Her Vaintz’ Swordsmanship differed greatly in form from the original.

However, this time she saw real demons in hell. She had a mission to destroy them, and she achieved the sword energy of dramatic victory. She was ready to accept her family’s slaughter.
