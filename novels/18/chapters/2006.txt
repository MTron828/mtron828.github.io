Chapter 2006

Raiders and Nevartan thought this was somewhat unfair. Many of the Absolute-level cultivators who confronted them were monsters who could ascend at any time. If they were at a slight disadvantage during a fight, they would sacrifice a Full Moon Fortress to ascend, evolve into an immortal, and return to the battle.

The good news was...

“They are my prey.”

“Bah, you really think I will just let you have a dragon that is at least as strong as a true immortal? How can you hoard all the rewards for yourself? All the scales, leather, horns, teeth, claws, eyes, heart, or even the blood? Unless you want me to kill you first, let’s abandon our greed and share this prey.”

“Do you really think you can kill me?”

“You two, calm down. Wouldn’t it be better to work together and settle how to share the rewards afterward?”

“Work together? Why should I trust you?”

The immortals didn’t trust each other. They hated each other and were wary of the others’ actions as if they were blood enemies. For the old dragons, it was much more convenient to be chased by seven immortals than to be chased by two or three immortals.

-They are treating us as if we’re already dead.

-Honestly, I thought I was about to die.

Raiders and Nevartan had contradictory expressions on their faces while chatting. Raiders looked relieved, while Nevartan gritted his teeth like he was about to go on a rampage any second now.

-Is this something an old dragon should say? Have you completely lost your self-esteem since Hayate captured you and since you allowed Trauka to die?

-I can’t say those things didn’t affect me at all.

Raiders was candid about how he felt. Nevartan’s taunts didn’t work on him at all.

Nevartan frowned and released black fog. This thick fog temporarily made it hard for the cultivators to see or sense anything at all. They had already slowed down in their pursuit because they were too paranoid of each other.

“You despicable black dragon! I will rip out your heart alive and chew on it!”

The female immortal, who had been on bad terms with Raiders since attacking his lair, lost her temper. She used the iron ball stuck to the tip of her tongue as her main Treasure, and she was the one who had done the most during the chase. She didn’t bother with the other immortals and only focused on chasing the two old dragons.

‘This is a bit excessive.’

The girl had lived for tens of thousands of years but she had almost never experienced dilemmas. She kept getting stronger and stronger thanks to her natural talent and good fortune. Not only had she found herself into a strange world, but now she also risked losing the prey she so desperately wanted? She had never experienced this before. She didn’t know how it felt when things didn’t go her way.

The old dragons were very clever. They used the areas where the Full Moon Fortresses were located as escape routes. Every time they arrived at a Full Moon Fortress, they would go on a rampage and provoke the cultivators of other sects. If there was a cultivator among them who was qualified to ascend, it would be very troublesome for the other immortals. The moment a cultivator who could ascend laid eyes on the dragons, they would become competition for the immortals.

“Again...!”

The old dragons spewed flames from their mouths while retreating. Their retreat path was jade colored. They reached a Full Moon Fortress where the Eternal Life Sect was located.

This sect was fairly large. It had quite a few cultivators in the great ascension realm. There were also old cultivators who could ascend at any time, so there was the possibility that they would also start competing with the immortals.

“Going on a rampage...!”

The female immortal with sharp eyes increased her spiritual energy to the maximum amount. All the other immortals turned to look at her. They were insidious and ready to make her their new victim.

The female immortal made a bold decision. ‘I can make up for the losses if I take the dragons’ hearts.’

She used most of her spiritual energy to cast a lightning movement technique and charged forward at lightning speed. She approached the old dragons and swung her spear. Some of Nevartan’s scales fell off because of the surprise attack.

[Bah!]

Nevartan just snorted.

Flash!

The two giant dragons vanished. They used a secret move called teleportation. This spatial movement technique had already fooled the girl several times.

“How is this possible...?”

They could just use spatial movement techniques without a formation or spirit stones? This world was bizarre. It was common for beings in this world to display magical abilities beyond their realm. Some of these beings made her think that they had realms higher than golden immortal.

‘What is this place?’

Was this world the hometown of the warrior? The girl who had become an immortal remembered the story about the warrior who wreaked havoc in the immortal world a long time ago. She kept making up absurd scenarios in her head.

‘Did the descendants of the warriors summon us to this world to wipe out the cultivators?’

...No, this had been a forced dimensional transfer. There was no way someone could do this unless they were a god...

The girl shook her head. Her eyes gradually became cold because she noticed that the other six immortals had stopped chasing the old dragons and instead surrounded her.

“You are very brave to ignore us like this...”

An immortal’s spiritual energy recovered incredibly fast. By absorbing a spirit stone of the highest tier, one could recover their strength.

However, it was bound to take some time until they completely recovered. The girl was in a bad situation right now. Using up all her spiritual energy to cast a lightning movement technique? Blinded by her greed, she didn’t save enough resources and she was temporarily out of spiritual energy. She was vulnerable now, which meant that this was the perfect opportunity for the other immortals to kill her.

“This situation was already quite bothersome because there’s a lot of competition, but things worked out well in the end. It would be perfect if we could kill you and increase our strength before resuming chasing the fleeing dragons.”

The six immortals didn’t hide their murderous intentions. They quickly closed the distance between them and the girl and pulled out their respective treasures.

The surrounding jade light faded in an instant. There was a problem with the source of the jade light— the Full Moon Fortress. Astonished, the immortals looked up at the sky.

Rumble...

They witnessed the Full Moon Fortress being split in half and falling.

The immortals watched in a daze as it crashed to the ground and shattered to pieces. Then they finally reacted and frowned.

“That plaque... Was that the Eternal Life Sect? How did the Full Moon Fortress of the Eternal Life Sect end up like this...?”

“Wasn’t Yu Seong the great elder of the Eternal Life Sect? Didn’t Yu Seong deliberately postpone his ascension?”

Deliberately postponing ascension referred to cultivators who, for some reason, even though they could ascend to immortality at any moment, chose not to do so. The seven immortals present had been mere cultivators just a few days before. Because of personal reasons, they hadn’t considered leaving the cultivation world. They ended up giving up on these reasons to chase the old dragons.

In any case, Yu Seong was a very powerful individual. There was no way he wouldn’t have done anything to prevent the Full Moon Fortress from collapsing.

“...He didn’t even have time to ascend?” the immortals wondered.

Now that they paid extra attention to the remains, it looked as if the Full Moon Fortress of the Eternal Life Sect had been cut by a single slash of the sword. This was the work of a being who was at least on the same level as a true immortal.

“Or maybe even on the level of a golden immortal...”

The immortals were a bit nervous. They put off killing the girl they surrounded.

“This is a formidable enemy. Let’s get rid of our greed for a moment and work together.”

At someone’s insistence, the immortals, including the girl, nodded. They put away the desire to harm each other, as well as the plan to chase the old dragons.

Just then, Grid’s group showed up. The immortals who promised to cooperate had nothing to fear.

“Did you do that?”

They immediately made their killing intent obvious to Grid’s group and approached slowly.

[I was wondering why they stopped chasing us.]

The old dragons were back. They had run away, but now they seemed to have gained some confidence.

“Were these guys chasing you?”

[It just so happened that they were.]

“Let’s finish them off quickly.”

The conversation between Grid and the old dragons greatly angered the immortals.

“Are you crazy?”

The immortals noticed that Grid was very powerful. He had cut down the Full Moon Fortress with a single slash of his sword. At the very least, was stronger than any of the seven immortals in terms of raw power. But the immortals had a numerical advantage. Or so they thought.

The immortals snorted, but their eyes suddenly widened. They paled. Many things changed the moment Grid landed on top of the black dragon’s head. The energies exuded by Grid and the black dragon became ridiculously intimidating.

“He really is on the same level as a golden immortal...!”

The immortals exchanged looks and made a decision. They used binding and isolation-type techniques, aware that they needed to sever the bond that existed between Grid and the black dragon.

They took out black chains and huge boxes from their mouths. They used the chains imbued with mystical characters to bind the wings and legs of the black dragon. A box wriggled as if alive and swallowed Grid whole. This was a trick meant to isolate Grid and the black dragon.

Grid was aware of their intentions and slashed through the box with the Falling Moon Sword. Nevartan couldn’t move because of the chains.

‘This is better than the dragon’s harpoon.’

The chains seemed to have been forged over the years so they could be used to hunt down giant beings. This meant that huge monsters like dragons were common in the cultivation world.

Grid saw how powerful the chains were and abandoned Nevartan without a second thought. The Dragon Knight effect was lifted the moment he separated from Nevartan using Shunpo. The immortals relaxed, sensing that Grid’s aura had changed the moment he was alone.

They were happy that they succeeded in pinpointing a powerful enemy’s weakness and attacked. Many mystical arts and treasures of the immortals headed for Grid. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

[You have suffered catastrophic damage!]

[You have suffered catastrophic damage!]

Grid’s HP bar decreased rapidly. By the time he had got close to the cultivators, he had less than one-third of his HP remaining. Why? Because the immortals were true Absolutes. Of course they were powerful.

However, there was something that was more important than that. Grid didn’t activate Multiple Weakening Barriers and Absolute Defense. Yup. He deliberately let the immortals hit him to maximize the power of the new armor, which increased his attack power every time he got hit.

[The effect of the Chaos Fire Dragon's Armor has increased the power of your next attack by 630%.]

[The effect of Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears has been triggered. Attack power will increase by 50% for 5 seconds.]

Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears was a skill built into the Slaughterer's Mask. Since this skill triggered after Grid accumulated enough blood flow from taking damage, it had great synergy with the Chaos Fire Dragon's Armor.

“Restraint.”

Grid closed the distance between him and the immortals and performed a fierce sword dance that overwhelmed nearby enemies. The immortals were already affected by Chaos Aura and now fell victim to a breathtaking illusion.

“Drop.”

Grid proved his greatness to the world. A wave of sword energy rained down from the sky like a giant palm, hitting the already overwhelmed immortals and making them collapse to the ground.

Grid’s hair was standing up because of Transcend’s effect, which triggered whenever he used Drop.

“Flower.”

The petal-shaped sword energies fluttered in all directions around the immortals.

[Grid.]

“Raiders.”

Beneath Grid’s feet, something golden appeared. It was Raiders, who replaced Nevartan and carried Grid on his back.

[The effect of Dragon Knight is activated!]

“Kill, Wave, Link.”

From Raiders’ back, the purple sword energy imbued with Annihilation energy spread out like waves. Unable to handle that power, the seven immortals were torn to shreds.
