Chapter 1846

“No, what...”

Both Ibellin and Cork were dumbfounded.

Broken Sword—it happened as Biban pulled out a seemingly useless item and took aim at the fragments of Asura that were approaching at the speed of light...

Their view was blocked by a ‘wall.‘ It was really a wall. The wall that suddenly appeared like an illusion filled their vision. Then there was an earthquake and the wall was lifted.

Before they knew it, they witnessed the scenes of the demonic creatures on the battlefield turning to ash. Thousands of demonic creatures had been slaughtered. The fragments of Asura were also gone.

What happened? It took them quite some time to understand. The two people belatedly realized the truth and fixed their eyes on Biban’s broken sword.

“As expected. It isn’t cut.”

Biban aimed his sword at the sky again.

What they had doubted was actually true. The identity of the wall that blocked Ibellin and Coke’s vision—it was Biban’s sword that rapidly grew in size. It felt like the physical embodiment of the Space Sword, the Sword Saint’s ultimate skill that cut through the world with a sword.

The targeted fragments of Asura flew into the distance like a home run ball and the battlefield split in half. The demons and demonic creatures swept away by the shock either fell to the ground or fell off a cliff to their deaths.

“Hahat! Is the Sword God also overgeared?” Asuka giggled as she clung to the cliff that had just formed. She didn’t show any displeasure even though she almost died. Rather, she seemed to have formed a liking toward Biban.

‘She is an enigmatic person, even though I know her.’

It was true for most of the people gathered around Grid. It was the same for them.

Ibellin glanced at the masked angels who were observing before his eyes widened.

“Behind! Behind you!”

A slime-like flesh was creeping out of the underground entrance that the group had their backs to. It was very suspicious. He wondered if it was part of the red flesh that was fighting fiercely with Yura’s group underground.

The destructive power contained in Ibellin’s sword was enormous. The flesh was shattered with one blow.

Biban looked at the flesh scattering in all directions and cocked his head. “It is strange. I didn’t feel its presence. It is persistent.”

The group’s eyes shifted back to the sky. The fragments of Asura that flew away a while ago were returning. He felt a strong determination to enter the underground area.

“It is better to change the method.”

Biban put away Broken Sword. He stood blocking the entrance of the underground area and glared at the fragments of Asura approaching at the speed of light. The fragments of Asura that arrived were caught by Biban’s hands. Both arms were captured in the left hand and the lower body was in the right hand. Finally, the torso was caught under Biban’s armpit and it was immobilized.

It was a rather unrealistic sight. It was already abnormal that the fragmented body parts were flying around. Additionally, Asura’s arms and legs were twice as large as the average adult man, yet Biban held them with both hands. It was only possible because his hands were as big as pot lids.

Biban had veins bulging from his neck and forehead as he folded all of Asura’s joints. It was a fearsome strength.

He sat down and used as a cushion the fragments of Asura, which had strangely twisted arms and legs wrapped around the torso. Then he spoke to Ibellin, “Look for something to tie it up with.”

“...Yes!” Ibellin and Coke answered with a sudden sense of loyalty. They were thrilled after seeing what Biban had shown. Asuka followed the two of them silently. The angel in the gold mask also chased after the group.

Biban spoke to the man in the silver mask who was left behind, “Your eyes are fierce. Your uneasiness is showing despite the mask.”

“...Haha. It makes me excited that they don’t seem to recognize me at all.”

“You changed your race to an angel and even wore a mask. Isn’t it a problem if you are easily recognized?”

“I guess so...?”

It was during the time when the two of them were having a conversation.

“......”

The pieces of flesh that had just been shattered were moving slowly. They passed between the rocks and approached the fragments of Asura that Biban was sitting on. There were no signs. It was because it wasn’t a living thing.

Creak.

Only Asura reacted to the flesh. Asura desperately moved his arm, which was tied to his torso and bent in the opposite direction of his joints. He barely managed to stretch out one finger.

“Stay still.”

It was the moment when Biban felt a disturbance and put strength into his hips. However, Asura’s finger barely stretched out and touched the flesh. At the same time, a powerful explosion occurred. It was an explosion of energy. The origin was Asura, whom Biban had been sitting on. The explosion pushed away Biban and the angel in the silver mask.

“Cough, cough!” The angel hurriedly raised his head to examine the situation. He could see a figure slowly standing up through the thick smoke. It was a headless figure.

“This...!”

Asura’s arms, torso, and lower body were glued together.

The angel in the mask grasped the situation and took a battle stance, only for blood to spew from his mouth. Asura’s hand was piercing his torso.

“Hup!”

Biban’s cry rang in the angel’s ears as he was stunned by the shock. Before he knew it, Biban had come to his side and wielded Broken Sword.

Broken Sword was caught in Asura’s hand and stopped. It was useless. Asura was forced to let go the moment the sword grew in size. It slashed heavily and soared into the air. Biban supported the angel and went back to the entrance of the underground, guarding there.

“Did it combine...? So what are you going to do?”

An Absolute—it was a hierarchy that went beyond the concept of a nation or an era and controlled the fate of the world. There was no reason to shrink back just from facing a god.

“......”

The Evil God, Asura, who ingested the red flesh and took a form, was quiet. It was because it didn’t have a head. He didn’t even have nostrils or a mouth, so he couldn’t breathe. Only his heart was pounding.

Duguen, dugeun, dugeun...

The only sound was the heartbeat that got louder and louder.

“...Are you having fun?”

The Evil God derived from Baal’s desire and hard work—his madness irritated Ibellin and the others, who came running at the sound of the commotion. He was bizarre from his appearance and quickly spread fear.

“This is an opportunity to properly check his power.”

Instead, Biban laughed. He looked pleased to see Asura.

***

There was no invincibility.

Grid’s experience was telling him this truth.

From Elfin Stone, who was regarded as a disaster in the vampire cities, to Belial, the great demon who invaded the surface for the first time, the yangbans of the East Continent, the dukes of the empire, the archangels, Martial God Zeratul, and even the dragons.

Grid had met dozens of enemies he was ‘unlikely to win against.’ How were all of them now? They were dead, gone, or wouldn’t go against Grid. Grid believed that Baal would have the same fate.

A guy who had been playing with the concept of death at the peak of hell—he was a strong enemy, but Grid wasn’t inferior.

Grid’s individual force exceeded Baal’s and the firepower of the expedition led by Grid also overwhelmed the firepower of the demonic army called by Baal. It was thanks to the dragon weapons and armor that had been produced and enhanced in large quantities.

‘I will win.’

It was a conclusion based on thorough analysis, not vague confidence. Grid’s expedition this time must be successful. He was confident from the beginning and put it into action. It was beyond his calculations that Baal became stronger than expected, but this wasn’t even a variable. It was because Grid also grew stronger in real time.

[Die...!]

Baal slumped down and shouted in a threatening manner. No, it was more than just a threat. It was a real danger. He shot a ray of magic power every time he opened his mouth.

“Ugh...!” Nefelina swallowed down a scream as she turned and narrowly avoided the light. She didn’t know how many times this had already happened. If she was polymorphed as a human being, then she would have a half-crying face.

“I’m sorry, Nefelina!” Grid grabbed Nefelina’s horn to guide her flight path. He headed straight for the newly fired beam.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Hiik!”

The flapping of Nefelina’s wings stopped for a moment. It was only for a moment. Her eyes snapped shut and she flapped her wings again. She risked turning into a rag and rushed in. It was because that was what Grid wanted.

It was a misunderstanding. Grid didn’t want to hurt Nefelina. He hoped to close the distance between them and Baal. He was responsible for Nefelina’s safety by striking the beam with Revolve the moment it was about to touch.

‘There are 20 seconds left.’

Nefelina was a hatchling. She had only temporarily transcended her limits. Originally, she didn’t have the qualifications to activate Dragon Knight. Additionally, the time of this transcendence was limited. He had to gain more benefits.

[Kuaaack...!]

Baal allowed Grid’s approach and screamed again. There was a mind-numbing pain. Baal thought that the sword Grid was wielding was really unreasonable. He keenly realized how miserable and painful the feelings of an innocent victim were.

That’s right.

Gourmet Dragon Raiders, Fire Dragon Trauka, Blacksmith God Hexetia, the Great Robber of the Red Night, Grid, and Khan—the power of Defying the Natural Order, created through the cooperation of many Absolutes and transcendents, made Baal understand the position of the weak.

It made Baal realize how cruel his crimes had been. Baal had no choice but to admit it.

‘He is stronger than me.’

The dragons—he didn’t expect for a monster to be born that could use the creatures even Rebecca couldn’t control as a power in a different way.

[Dragon...! Knight!]

Baal’s angry cries set off a series of explosions. It resembled Dragon Fear. It was a powerful technique created simply by combining his loud voice and magic power.

Nefelina’s small body shook like she was going to fall. Then she spun around and Grid missed his target. It gave Baal an opportunity to fight back.

[It is up to here...!]

Grid and Nefelina’s vision darkened. It was because the shadow made by Baal’s hand was getting closer. They would be crushed the moment they were caught.

Nefelina had a hunch, so she gritted her teeth and picked up the pace. However, she was slow. The short period of time where she was off balance proved fatal. Baal’s hot hand that was heated by mana touched her scales.

It was over...

Then the scenery that Nefelina saw changed like it was a lie. The valley formed by the ground that collapsed every time Baal walked disappeared completely and a wilderness spread out. Baal’s back could be seen in the distance.

Clack clack.

The sound of clacking teeth was heard.

An Overgeared Skeleton. The Overgeared Skeleton, summoned by Grid, changed Nefelina’s position.

Spatial distortion—it wasn’t like movement magic. This meant it was possible to resist to a certain extent the barrier blocking movement magic. It was thanks to Baal returning to his primal form. Most of the skills that Baal acquired from the dead were incapacitated.

“”I’m sorry... I couldn’t move you far. The amount of magic that Eve demanded...””

“No, this is well done.”

Hundreds of God Hands, each holding weapons, spread out like wings. They were like the wings of a spear. At the same time, Grid used Request to Stand With Me. He gathered the wishes of the people. He also activated Another Tomb, which had been used three times.

Finally, the six fusion sword dance was used. God's Command couldn't activate again due to the constraints of hell, but there was a limit to the restriction effect of the dimension. It couldn’t stop the cooldown from resetting.

A god who climbed onto the back of a dragon and spread wings like a spear blade—he danced in the rain of battle gear and magic. He slashed at the wrists of the giant evil who released inexhaustible magic power. He cut it, reached his heart, and inserted Defying the Natural Order.

It was a blow to bring down the sky of hell.

[Ah... Huuuuu...]

Baal groaned.

A being who had overcome death—he backed away with a flustered expression. He floundered as if he was frightened.

Finally, Baal collapsed and coughed up blood. The blood quickly formed lakes and rivers, soaking the barren land. Countless shades of gray were escaping from his body.
