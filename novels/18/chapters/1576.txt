Chapter 1576

According to the words of Sword Saint Biban, the sword dances were just a means of directing a ritual. In fact, Pagma was very weak in the past episodes of the Hwan Kingdom that Grid experienced. He had a different temperament from the other yangbans and was treated differently.

Pagma was raised as a priest to ‘assist the gods’ rather than a ‘god.’ It was a type of disposal. It was right to see it as the expelled gods abandoning him due to his different tendencies and abilities rather than making him a yangban. Therefore—

For Grid, the sword dances were a trace and legacy of the underprivileged. He felt a sense of kinship. He could never turn a blind eye to it even when the limitations were pointed out by the strong and sometimes ridiculed.

From Golden Flash and Unbreakable Justice to the skills gained from the Behen Archipelago, magic learned from Braham, the power of the runes, the duke titles, the swordsmanship of the Undefeated King, and blood magic—Grid had always gained new power. There were cases where these new powers transcended the power and potential of the sword dances.

Grid had been subconsciously turning away from them. Rather, he became more obsessed with the sword dances and trained in them. It was out of the fear that he might be denying himself the moment he abandoned the sword dances, discussing their shortcomings, weaknesses, and limitations.

The result was Grid’s Sword Dance. It was the result of transcending Pagma’s Sword Dance several times in conjunction with the teachings of Sword Saint Biban, the inspiration given by Kraugel, and Braham’s magic and knowledge that coincided with Grid’s tenacity that was close to obsession. The sword dances that had grown with Grid were one of the most positive proofs of Grid, who used to be a ‘useless being’ and it was one of his greatest prides.

[’Grid’s Sword Dance’ has been promoted to ‘Overgeared God’s Sword Dance.’]

“Ah...” The notification window that appeared gave Grid infinite joy and vitality. The ever-bright vision combined with his clear spirit accelerated Grid’s thinking. He made a quick decision. He used Storm of the Fire God to prevent the flooding of light. The contrast and shade created by the flames induced the light elemental king to become smaller. The light elemental king couldn’t easily escape.

Magic—the law of Braham’s magic transcended the concept of common things. Grid’s domain became more powerful in conjunction with Braham’s magic.

Light and virtue—Zik’s runes, which denied everything that symbolized the gods of Asgard, were pressing the light elemental king.

Grid had a complete understanding of the situation.

‘Now the sword dances are a part of me.’

It was from the moment it evolved into Grid’s Sword Dance. Once he grew to be the Overgeared God, the sword dances should’ve grown together with him. However, Braham’s magic that was attached to the sword dances inhibited its growth.

The Overgeared God’s divine power. The attribute was judged to be ‘nothingness.’ Braham’s magic had bad compatibility with the sword dances due to the multiple attributes. As a result, growth didn’t occur. This didn’t mean he blamed Braham. Braham’s magic was the decisive reason why Pagma’s Sword Dance grew into Grid’s Sword Dance. There would be no Overgeared God's Sword Dance without Braham’s magic.

‘It is ironic.’

Braham’s magic, which created the current sword dance, was actually the cause of suppressing the sword dances.

Perhaps it would’ve been a truth that was buried forever if it wasn’t for Braham noticing it?

“I have really received a lot of help from you every time. Thank you.”

“Bah,” Braham’s expression was uncomfortable as he scoffed. He seemed very displeased. It was natural. The task of hitting Greed with ‘Disintegrate’ that he had been doing so far was meaningless. Considering the future, it was right to discard any attributes in the equipment used by Grid. It was because the higher the status of the Overgeared God, the more likely it was that the effects of attributes and harmony would occur. Perhaps from today, Braham would drop Meteor on Greed?

‘It must be terrible.’

The thing he had been doing for months was overturned and he had to start over...

Grid felt deep sympathy for Braham. However, there were no empty words such as ‘don’t overdo it’ or ‘do it slowly.’ Grid was the one who wanted to get the result of magic tempering quickly. Furthermore, Braham regained the power of a direct descendant. It might be different mentally, but physically, he didn’t easily get tired. It was Grid’s honest feelings that he wanted Braham to save time used for eating and sleeping to finish the work quickly.

“It is somehow unpleasant.”

“What?”

Grid’s heart as he questioned the frowning Braham was still hot. It was due to the anger that was seething separately from his clear mind.

Light Stone—they couldn’t even communicate properly because their emotions and languages were different...

Still, it was a precious colleague. They had obviously been communicating and Grid received a lot of help. Grid could never forgive the light elemental king who took Light Stone’s life.

[Overgeared God! Think about it calmly!]

The light elemental king shouted urgently.

[There will be no chance of reconciliation with Mother if you hurt me!]

“So who is your mother?”

[This guy, even until the end...!]

The light elemental king growled out and its killing intent exploded. It wanted to pierce Grid’s heart and kill him right now.

The velocity of light—its greatest weapon was the ‘speed’ that couldn’t be countered except by a few rare beings. The light elemental king was confident that if it intended to kill Grid from the beginning, Grid would’ve already become a cold corpse. However, it hated the attitude of talking nonsense without knowing how to be grateful.

[I feel sorry for you who can’t feel my mercy due to your low level.]

The light elemental king abandoned its lingering regrets. It formed the shape of an arrow of light with the determination to kill Grid. It strengthened the power of speed by adding the concept of ‘shooting’ to the light. Indeed, as the ruler of a dimension, all actions were meaningful. This meaning became real force.

There was just one fact that the light elemental king overlooked. It couldn’t easily kill Grid. The result would’ve been the same even if it aimed to kill Grid from the beginning. This was a fact that all transcendent beings in the world should remember.

Grid had experienced conflicts every day. He had rarely experienced a peaceful period. He was endlessly shaken, hit, and polished without rest like steel. This was why fire dragon Ifrit evaluated Grid as a ‘great being who overshadows the times.’ Grid was different from the existing transcendents who enjoyed a life of cowardice and had merely built up a long existence. He should not be considered easy.

Hundreds or thousands of beams of light that were like threads unraveling pierced Grid’s entire body. Even Greed was destroyed by the light elemental king, who claimed to be Rebecca’s descendant. Nevertheless, Grid didn’t collapse. Two types of White Tiger’s Posture, Calm Before the Storm, First Emperor, etc. He endured the shock using all types of powers.

He took a heavy step without letting go of the swords held in both hands. Rather, Grid’s eyes where the light didn’t go out gave a subtle fear to the light elemental king.

‘He isn’t collapsing?’

The light elemental king’s sense of reason cried out that it should give up on Grid and leave. However, it was hard for it to leave even if it wanted to. The biggest problem was the gravity field that spread out extensively from the magician who had Beriache’s blood and became a god’s subordinate. The moment its position moved outside a certain range, the light dimmed and decelerated.

A space where a storm of fire swirled—the moment it left the mental world of the Overgeared God, the light elemental king would become even weaker. It was to the point where light was caught and swallowed up by the darkness and runes that were stretching out.

‘First of all, I have to kill that magician to find a way to live.’

The light elemental king made this judgment and laughed from the absurdity.

Light that had existed since before the beginning. It was confident that it was one of the sources of light, but it was experiencing a crisis against three people? The provocation of the Overgeared God lingered in its mind.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

‘Is Goddess Rebecca truly my mother?’

It was the moment it questioned the truth that it took for granted.

──!

The light glowed like it had been hit by a strong wind. The problem wasn’t that the light was weakened due to empathizing with the light elemental king’s feelings. It was due to the wavelength of force generated by Grd’s actions that pushed the light away.

The principle was simple. The ground crushed by Grid split apart and the fragments that soared up from the impact became a barrier against the light transmission. That was all.

[......?]

The light elemental king was belatedly shocked. It was because Grid disappeared. It missed Grid’s movement the moment the dizzying barrier caused a blockage in its vision.

Drop.

Grid had fallen into a gap in the cracked ground. The land where the spirit elemental king was located became soft. A pattern reminiscent of a whirlpool that occurred in the middle of the sea was engraved instantly on the ground. It was an aftermath that affected the entire tens of kilometers thick crust.

Dragon.

Grid penetrated through the center of the pattern and shot toward the sky.

‘This ignorant guy?’

Putting aside its dislike, the light elemental king was derisive. Light couldn’t be cut. He was currently wary of Braham and Zik, not Grid. It was always like that.

Just then, the vision of the light elemental king was split in half and shifted. The gathered light blocked by the barrier was neatly cut.

[......?!]

The light elemental king was shocked. The Martial God that all beings in the world who longed for power envisioned and desired. It was because the appearance of Martial God Chiyou overlapped with Grid for a second.

Pinnacle.

It was proof that the new fusion sword dance, divided into six breaths, perfectly embodied the martial god’s strike.

Jingle.

The quiet sound of bells that shouldn’t exist here rang out. Of course, Grid thought he was hallucinating. This was until he read the greatly shaken light elemental king who acted like it had heard a funeral march.

[The Ultimate Martial Art is suppressing the target.]

One Who Met the Martial God—the favor given by Martial God Chiyou occurred as if he was praising Grid. It cast a stun that couldn’t be resisted or recovered from, ignoring the species, status, and ranking of the target. The greatest of all powers that existed in the world caused the light elemental king to stiffen. It was the moment when the unstoppable light stopped.

There were all types of chaos in its field of view. It was as if a void had descended. The stopped light shattered. It was the aftermath of the disastrous crushing of Link and Kill, which carried the divinity of the Overgeared God behind it and could be called invincible. Nothingness denied the phenomenon of light.

[I can’t believe it...]

Shock, confusion, and fear—the thoughts of the light elemental king, which were directly transmitted to Grid’s mind, scattered fleetingly. It was because it was swept away by the waves of condensed sword energy released in the process of linking the sword dances.

[The new fusion sword dance ‘Drop Dragon Pinnacle Linked Kill Wave’ has been created.]

[An unknown person is praising you for your ability to transcend your limits.]

[A strong blessing has fallen on Drop Dragon Pinnacle Linked Kill Wave.]

Jingle.

The sound of bells rang out again. Grid clearly felt that Martial God Chiyou was watching as he swapped the sword in his left hand for the Falling Moon Sword.

The light elemental spirit that reunited as soon as it escaped the influence of Ultimate Martial Art was once again cut in half.

[Kuaack!]

However, light was extraordinary. Following the Falling Moon Sword, it repeatedly recovered after several cuts from the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship and the five fusion sword dances. Every time this happened, it attacked Grid at a speed that couldn’t be caught with Grid’s senses. It would’ve been a very big crisis without the ‘reconstruction’ function of Greed.

“You endure well.”

Braham and Zik were also active while Grid faced his limits. A gravity field combined with runes turned into a black hole that started sucking in light. The light elemental king sharply weakened. Even so, the situation wasn’t very good. Most of Grid’s attack skills were on cooldown and his resources were at the bottom. He couldn’t afford to deal the finishing blow. At this moment—

[You...! You!!!] The light elemental king that was attempting to ambush Braham suddenly stopped and struggled alone.

Grid felt a faint pressure from inside the light elemental king. It was the sign of Light Stone, whom he thought was extinguished. Light Stone was igniting the last of its willpower to help Grid, not the king it had served so far. Grid responded to that will. He squeezed out courage as someone who had been fighting to repay the expectations of others.

[Kuaaaaaack!]

The light went out.

[The light elemental king has been defeated!]

[A new elemental king has been born based on the laws of the elemental world sustained by the five attributes.]

It was finally over...

Someone supported the body of the collapsing Grid. It was a cute elemental with a smiling face. It was small and blurry in shape, but it contained infinite power.

“Light Stone...? Are you perhaps Light Stone?”

The elemental king of nothingness—the new elemental king nodded vigorously.

[Yes, I am Nothing Stone.]

“......”

The pillar of light symbolizing a level up fell dozens of times onto the body of Grid, who had a strange expression.
