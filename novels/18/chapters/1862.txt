Chapter 1862

The first in the world to break through level 1,000—he earned the stats redistribution with no cooldown perk.

The powers of Baal and Amoract were also attached to the Rune of Gluttony. There was a significant increase in the level of the Overgeared World, which had expanded its territory to hell. He secured the core of the beginning that could make any wish come true, and Bunhelier’s loyalty (?).

The acquisition of Pagma’s Sword Dance, etc.

This was putting aside the fact that the dead had been put to rest and humanity had overcome its fears.

The hell expedition brought huge rewards to Grid. There was no other way since it was a reward for a near-final ordeal.

The redistribution of stats would be a formidable variable for enemies fighting against Grid in the future. Due to the ability to change it in real time, it was theoretically impossible to properly assess Grid’s power.

The increase in the level of the Overgeared World allowed him to appoint more angels.

The influence of the human gods belonging to the Overgeared World had increased. This also increased the probability of beneficial effects for humans.

The core of the beginning and Bunhelier were reliable insurances.

If—

If Grid did experience a crisis, then they could be relied on.

Grid was particularly fascinated by the power of Baal and Amoract.

[Demon Sword Remnants]

[A remnant of the power left by the 1st Great Demon, Baal.

After entering a state of combat, the form of Baal’s favorite demon sword will emerge and assist you.]

[Deception, Confusion, Temptation]

[A remnant of the power left by the 2nd Great Demon, Amoract.

Any target hostile to you won’t properly recognize your health gauge (or wounds).]

It was before Beriache took the powers of Baal and Amoract—Grid gained their powers first. Of course, it was only a fraction of it. Just as has been the case for a long time, he had been hampered by the setting that the capacity of the Rune of Gluttony was insufficient. The system explained that the hierarchy of Baal and Amoract was too high to fully absorb their power.

Even so, he was thankful. There were many cases where he wasn’t able to gain any powers at all. It was meaningful that he gained a small amount of the powers of the 1st Great Demon and the 2nd Great Demon.

Of course, he didn’t have high expectations. It was comforting that it wasn’t on the level of dog fur. Then when he checked later, he realized it wasn’t just that much. The power of Baal and Amoract far exceeded Grid’s expectations.

First of all, both skills were passive. It didn’t require any resources or conditions. It was triggered spontaneously without Grid being conscious of it and controlling it. Nevertheless, the effect was very interesting.

First of all, Demon Sword Remnants—it was a skill that was activated in a ‘combat state.’ It was very compatible with the senses of an Absolute. The moment something antagonized Grid, it immediately floated up and intercepted it. To put it more precisely, the skill reacted before Grid could identify the enemy.

It was similar to the artificial senses, but the artificial senses had to be consciously unfolded by Grid. This meant that Demon Sword Remnants was much more convenient. In the first place, the attack coefficient was so high that the God Hands couldn’t be compared to it.

In any case, the reason to keep his nerves sharp at all times had disappeared. It might not seem like a big deal, but it was a huge difference. Grid usually had to stay focused because he didn’t know when an enemy who was an Absolute would threaten him. Now he found peace in the true sense of the word. Finally, he was able to live a normal life just like everyone else.

Next up was Amoract’s Power.

Deception, Confusion, Temptation—this skill was also simple in principle, but it had a great effect. It was a passive skill that caused confusion over his ‘current state’ with a hostile target. It was bound to be useful. If a player was hostile to Grid, then they would be mistaken about Grid’s health gauge. They might misunderstand high health as low health or vice versa.

The same applied to NPCs and monsters. The other person would be confused and make misjudgments, such as recognizing a dying Grid as being in a normal state, or Grid without any wounds as dying.

‘I should’ve received these skills from the beginning.’

They were simple and convenient, but powerful skills. There was no cooldown time or resource consumption. They were skills that the old Grid longed for. It was a shame that he got them so late.

‘...No, in the first place, it is too fraudulent. That is why I only got it now.’

They were skills dropped by the 1st Great Demon and the 2nd Great Demon. It was too unconscionable to feel regret about not having acquired such skills from the beginning.

Grid soothed himself and slowly raised his head.

A military band was performing to announce Marie Rose’s position.

The entrance to the wedding hall—the most beautiful woman in the world, and one of the few beings Grid could rely on, entered. She was greeted by her siblings, who had their lives restored. Of course, Braham wasn’t among them.

Braham...

“What is so pretty about her?”

He was sitting in the guest seats with the other apostles. He was deeply displeased with the reaction that people showed when Marie Rose appeared.

“I would be a few levels above Marie Rose if I was born a woman.”

It was Braham who added an assumption that Grid didn’t want to imagine. Even so, Grid thanked him very deeply. If it wasn’t enough that he interfered with the mother he loved and respected most in the world for Grid’s sake, he also didn’t resent Marie Rose for hurting their mother. His attitude toward Marie Rose was just as chilly as before, but the evidence was that he obediently participated as a guest.

Maybe Braham—

Maybe he felt sorry for Marie Rose from the moment he found out what Beriache was trying to obtain through Marie Rose. It might’ve been a reminder of their sibling relationship that had been ignored.

‘Maybe one day they can get along...’

...No, it probably wouldn’t end up like that?

Slowly and with an elegant gait—Marie Rose approached Grid, who coughed in vain as he watched Braham glare at Marie Rose with a killing intent that went beyond hostility.

“Wow...”

The guests were half-mesmerized.

Beings who crossed species, tribes, and borders—all the guests who gathered to celebrate Grid today were mesmerized by Marie Rose, regardless of anything.

Lauel had said it jokingly. If it wasn’t for Grid and Marie Rose’s overwhelming power and authority, the Empire might’ve been ruined by those who were fascinated by Marie Rose’s beauty. There must’ve been people who rebelled in order to get Marie Rose. It wasn’t an exaggeration. When it came to expressing Marie Roe’s beauty, the term ‘peerless beauty’ wasn’t sufficient.

“Wow. I’m discouraged.” Even the always confident Jishuka muttered such words.

Mercedes even put on makeup. Just like a knight among knights, she wasn’t interested in embellishments at all, but she felt a sense of crisis from Marie Rose.

They all looked pretty to Grid.

No, the same was true in the eyes of other people.

Irene, Yura, Jishuka, Mercedes, and Basara—all of them were beautiful to the point where they could be described as peerless beauties. Why did all these women, each with their own charms, fall in love with Grid? The jealousy that had been forgotten for a while was renewed and people started to glare at Grid.

Then one by one, they controlled their emotions. It was the aftermath of seeing Grid greet his bride with a big smile. Unlike on the battlefield, Grid in his formal clothes was objectively cool. He looked as brilliant as his achievements so far.

In a way, it wasn’t something to be jealous of. They even thought it was fortunate that it was Grid, not another ugly man, who had a relationship with them.

“The next procedure...”

The atmosphere was completely calm. Huroi’s voice rang out after the ceremony filled with pure goodwill and blessings. The world stars Laella and Nyangmong sang a congratulatory song, and Piaro gave a congratulatory speech.

Why was the marriage arranged in such a hurry?

The somewhat puzzled members of the Overgeared Guild slowly realized the reason.

The day the world was saved—they witnessed several times the sight of the people, who were happy but somewhat anxious and confused, become relieved after seeing the faces of the heroes who came as guests.

We are always by your side...

Maybe Grid wanted to tell the people this.

“He was using his own marriage as a tool to reassure people. That is how deep God Grid is.”

The impressed Peak Sword even had red eyes. He didn’t forget to ask the reporters who were usually close to him to make good use of Grid’s inner thoughts when writing their articles.

Finally, Grid and Marie Rose swore eternal love and kissed. There was thunderous applause. All of those cheering truly blessed Grid and Marie Rose’s future.

‘...I’m happy.’

A kiss without pain—Grid felt the soft texture of Marie Rose’s lips, not the metallic taste of blood, and trembled with joy. Marie Rose was trembling in a different sense.

A lofty Absolute in the world had shaking eyelashes and was rarely trembling—it was due to Grid’s hands wrapped around her waist and against her cheek. It was like...

A sensation she had never known before rose from the depths of her body. It was truly an unfamiliar and terrifying sensation. Her mind turned blank and she almost lost strength in her legs. She vowed to Irene that she would behave well, but she almost showed an indecent appearance in front of people.

“...Marie Rose?”

Marie Rose’s reaction as she subtly lost her breath made Grid feel puzzled. Could it be that she was suffering from her vampire instincts?

Grid was feeling anxious at the thought of his lips possibly being bitten again. Then Marie Rose leaned her forehead against his chest and whispered, “I’m afraid of tonight.”

“......??”

***

Grid held a grand festival and neglected surveillance on the surface. It was an opportunity for the 1st ranked Great Archangel, Raphael. They came down to the surface secretly and moved to hell.

Hell—a large portion of it was incorporated into the Overgeared World, but the situation was different compared to the surface. Remnants of distortion remained and some areas were just as unstable as they were when Baal was alive. It was surprisingly easy to find demons and demonic creatures who were still stained with malice.

Raphael searched for the wandering great demons.

Pure white wings and a halo of light—they searched for gloomy spaces that didn’t match the appearance of a holy angel. Finally, they found it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Vicious demons biting at each other like beasts.

“Beasts who have lost your master. I will give you some help.”

“...Thank you so much?”

The great demons who were preying on other great demons—the girls who looked exactly like twins welcomed Raphael with a smile.

‘It is going well from the start.’

Raphael also smiled.
