Chapter 1996

The baihui acupuncture point was located at the top of one’s head. Even the slightest shock to this point could kill someone instantly.

However...

[You!]

Surprising, the golden immortal woman was still alive. She nervously pulled out the magic spear that had pierced the top of her head all the way to her neck before looking around.

She directed her anger solely at Chiyou. She didn’t recognize Grid’s clone, which she desired greatly, as an opponent. She thought that as long as she defeated Chiyou, she would get her hands on the incarnation no matter what.

Grid’s clone had consumed a lot of resources after defeating both Du Baeryong and his incarnation before forcibly teleporting the golden immortal away. The situation would have been different had the clone inherited all of Grid’s titles, but he hadn’t, so he was completely out of mana.

Of course, in theory, the clone had infinite magic power. The mana core made through the body manufacturing method, the stats that resembled Grid’s, and the titles obtained through training with Braham... The clone’s mana could gush up endlessly. Yes, this was the concept of mana surge. His mana pool wasn’t infinite. He just needed time to restore it.

[You’re pretty tough.]

Chiyou looked a bit embarrassed. He had no intention of killing the golden immortal with his own hands because he didn’t want to become stronger than he already was. Therefore, he entrusted Grid’s clone to finish her off. However, that didn’t happen. After all, a clone was just a clone...

The clone met Chiyou’s disappointed gaze and sent him a sound transmission.

-I request that you buy me thirty minutes.

[The lack of honorifics... You’re just as shameless as Grid, but your attitude is slightly different.]

-I can’t say that I’m shameless. Since I am asking for your cooperation so that things will turn out the way you want them to, doesn’t that make me considerate?

[Do I even have to say that you’re just like Grid? You are bold. Okay, I’ll accept your request.]

Chiyou wasn’t the type to enjoy meaningless arguments. If he really enjoyed anything, then he wouldn’t want to die all the time.

He gave the clone a quick nod and turned to look at the golden immortal. The woman swallowed a black pill, sprinkled white powder on the wound on her head and sutured it with her mystical characters. This was a quick and effective emergency measure that was reminiscent of the Saintess’ heals.

[It looks like you’ve been injured this way more than once or twice before.]

[I’ve risked my life many times.]

The woman held hundreds of thousands of mystical characters in her hands. Chiyou moved reflexively the moment they took the form of a great bow.

After throwing his sword, he approached the woman and thrust his hand under her armpits.

[Ack...!]

The woman narrowly escaped his grasp before Chiyou caught her again. She hurriedly shot an arrow. Even though she didn’t gather enough strength in that specific arrow, it was still very powerful, since it contained her immense aura. The arrow barely brushed Chiyou’s shoulder, and that was enough to inflict a slight wound.

[Um...]

Chiyou restored his numb arm by turning it a few times. He was overcome with a strong desire to fight properly and show off his strength. This was the true desire of the martial god.

However, Chiyou knew what achieving that desire would result in—nothingness. No matter how strong his enemy was, they would all fall at his feet. He would once again become stronger and have to endure eons of solitude. This had happened to him many times before. He was aware of this. Therefore, he had to control himself until he met someone who could definitely kill him.

Knowing this...

[Listen carefully for the bells.]

Jingle.

In the end, Chiyou couldn’t hold back his desire. He was completely fascinated by how powerful the golden immortal was. The woman could tell where Chiyou would move based on the sound of bells and managed to block his attack. However, she paid a high price for blocking that.

Her arms snapped back after she had crossed them in front of her chest to block the attack which sent her flying.

[This monster...!]

The woman paled as she quickly turned around. A whirlwind of mystical characters came out of her bow and surrounded her, blocking Chiyou’s follow-up attack.

Chiyou laughed.

[That’s it. Make this more enjoyable for me.]

The Martial God was the strongest fighter. Chiyou’s heart was filled with a deep desire to show off the extent of his power. He’d always suppressed this desire because things had always turned out bad when he let it run amok.

Still, wouldn’t it be different this time? This time, he might finally die after testing his limits...

The pupils disappeared from Chiyou’s eyes as he forced himself to feel hopeful. He had the urge to act on his desires. The whites of his eyes as his eyes rolled back made him look like a madman.

Jingle jingle!

The clear ringing of the bells became violent.

[Ack...!]

The woman’s shield was already on the verge of breaking. It was difficult to predict where Chiyou would hit her next, and it was also difficult to dodge since Chiyou was attacking from all directions.

The woman’s shield couldn’t withstand the consistent damage and finally broke. Chiyou grabbed the woman by the neck and waist using his capturing technique. The woman got turned upside down and she was about to be slammed into the ground. This was dangerous. She was going to die!

The immortal changed the mystical characters into chains and hooks and tried to bind Chiyou or wriggle out of his grasp. However, she was already falling and could no longer do anything to change that. She felt hopeless.

“Anti-gravity.”

The speed at which the woman was falling decreased considerably. However, this spell didn’t target her specifically. It targeted an entire area. It was a lot more difficult to resist this gravity spell since it was anti-gravity. The spell halted Chiyou’s advance, and the woman didn’t have her skull smashed in.

[...What are you doing?]

The golden immortal barely managed to shake off Chiyou and glared at Grid’s clone as if she was going to kill him.

Immortals were ruthless. It was common for them to stab their allies in the back. They never received help, especially from their enemy. However, the clone had helped her, so the woman was suspicious. She realized she had to be extra vigilant. Was the clone ridiculing her?

The clone didn’t even bother explaining his reasoning to the immortal. He was busy reprimanding Chiryou for his sudden change in attitude. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I asked you to buy me some time... What are you doing? Why do you want to kill her?”

[I thought it would be more fun this way.]

“I’ve seen low-level players leave buses because they wanted to get strong on their own, but I've never seen a bus driver try to steal the EXP.”

The clone decided to take matters into his own hands, so that was why he had cast all types of spells to hinder Chiyou’s movements.

The whites of Chiyou’s eyes were still showing.

[It’s more fun to fight together.]

Chiyou couldn’t regain his senses. The clone once again realized why Grid treated Chiyou so poorly and warned the woman, “Run away. You must not die to this guy.”

[How dare you order me around?]

“Don’t you realize that you’re going to die? Or are you just pretending to be tough? It’s like I’m talking to an imbecile...”

The woman’s eyes were filled with anger. She honestly had no idea what was going on, but she really wanted to survive. She suppressed her confusion and chose to flee. Pride? Had she had any pride, would she have become an immortal in the first place?

Jingle.

The sound of bells chased after her.

‘No way!’

A chill went down the woman’s spine. She had never been so frightened in her entire life. She thought Chiyou was about to catch up to her and prepared to fight back, only for dozens of magic power shields to appear around her.

“Chiyou, don’t do anything you will regret later. Regain your senses.”

[Make me. Use your strength.]

This conversation was going nowhere. Martial Gods Zeratul and Chiyou had one thing in common. Everytime they became blinded by their own desires, it made everyone around them exhausted. The Absolutes, including Grid and the old dragons, had suffered more than once or twice because of the two martial gods.

And now, once again, Chiyou was causing problems.

Grid’s clone had no way of solving this situation without using force to suppress Chiyou.

‘How troubling.’

However, Chiyou was strong. Grid clone, who was exhausted, was no match for him. Every time Chiyou hit the shield cast by the clone, it would shatter. Chiyou was still quick despite being under the effect of anti-gravity. Grid’s clone concluded that there was no way to put a stop to him.

Just then—

[You!]

A ray of light fell on the battlefield. It was Hanul, a God of the beginning. He’d crossed the continent at the speed of light and attacked Grid’s clone. He was faster than Chiyou. Because he was now in the Hwan Kingdom, Hanul showed off the strength of a God of the beginning.

“Ack...!”

The clone had been on the verge of collapsing after getting hit by Chiyou. Now he finally fell to the ground. He squirmed while clutching his chest where Hanul had hit him with his attack made out of light. Hanul also stomped on the back of his neck.

[I will make you pay a heavy price for damaging my divine world.]

Hanul pressed down even harder with his foot. The clone’s neck bent in a strange direction. Light flashed from Hanul’s eyes as he spotted the golden immortal not too far away.

[.....!]

The woman witnessed the two rays of gold coming toward her and felt hopeless.

[Don’t disturb me.]

Chiyou punched Hanul in the face, which made Hanul miss his attacks. The light rays barely brushed the woman’s cheeks.

[This guy is crazy!] The woman complained.

Chiyou’s attitude kept changing, so the woman was even more confused. However, Hanul was aware of how Chiyou was.

In any case, the woman had survived the encounter and ran faster. She wanted to get as far away as possible while Hanul and Chiyou were fighting.

There was something she wasn’t aware of. Before she knew it, she had entered the realm of the Overgeared World.

In other words, she walked right into Grid’s hands.

Slash!

[......?]

She saw herself hitting the ground before rolling around. The woman realized one second too late that she had been beheaded. She tried to reattach her severed head to the rest of her body, but to no avail.

The Falling Moon Sword didn’t just cut off her head. Grid had neatly cut her in half from the cervical spine to the lumbar vertebrae. Her outstretched hands floundered in the air, unable to touch each other.

[You... You deceived me!!]

She felt betrayed. The clone had helped her, yet Grid appeared and attacked her out of the blue?

Grid snorted.

“You are surprisingly naive. Remember this. Cultivators, immortals... Not a single one of you will make it back alive.”

Subsequently—

[Aghhhhhhh!]

He trembled slightly as he sliced the dwarf that emerged from the woman’s body. He gained dozens of levels at once.

Chiyou lending a hand had helped Grid greatly, but there was no time to rejoice. He had to make a choice.

Chiyou and Hanul were fighting. Should he rescue his clone from the monsters who lost their sense of reason or should he just leave and wish the clone good luck?

He still had many Full Moon Fortresses to destroy. He didn’t want to waste any time, so he needed to be cautious.

“...I have to decide what to do.”

No matter how much he thought about it, he decided it was better to end this unstable relationship as quickly as possible. So what if he didn’t have time? If his plan did not work, then he could make up for the wasted time after he died and resurrected.

Grid made up his mind and took a step forward.

Several stories were coming to an end.
