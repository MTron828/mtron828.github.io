All of South Korea was shaken. The US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, India, Japan, China, and many other countries were in similar situations.

The leaders of dozens of countries around the world visited South Korea. It wasn’t just politicians who did this. Famous figures from all walks of life, including big names from the business world, rankers who had made a name for themselves in Satisfy, and Hollywood actors visited the country. All airports in South Korea were congested with private planes.

There was only one reason for this—Shin Youngwoo, the hero who had saved Satisfy several times. Everyone had come to attend Grid’s wedding as a guest. He had overwhelming support from at least two billion players, so attending the wedding of the world’s most influential person had become an honor in itself.

“Vantner, do you want us to break up?”

Vantner turned his head every time a beautiful woman passed by. Eventually, he had to kneel in front of his girlfriend and ask for forgiveness.

“No? F-Forgive me, angel. I shouldn’t have done that.”

The wedding hall, which was packed with people, was on the verge of becoming a disaster. It was incredibly noisy. Wouldn’t people get hurt if this continued? The bodyguards of the political and business figures were on high alert.

“Guests, please follow our instructions.”

Toon and his friends, dressed in stylish suits, suddenly appeared. They were the former Italian mafia and they had a strange charisma. They had a lot of experience living as guests in Grid’s apartment complex, so they were very good at guiding other people.

“We will take you through this corridor according to the manual distributed in advance.”

Faker was in charge of guiding the heads of state.

The bodyguards snorted. They were responsible for the safety of their own president or prime minister, so they were very prideful. They glared at the back of Faker’s head as he led the way and wondered, ‘Just who is this guy?’

It was only for a moment. After all, they were professionals. They quickly noticed that Faker knew what he was doing. They also vaguely saw how swiftly and carefully Faker was moving and were impressed.

The world’s leading military companies reached out to Faker after seeing the bodyguards with high reputations in the industry following him like he was their master. They really wanted him to work for them. “Faker, have you considered getting a job at a military or security company in the future? We promise you that you will receive the best treatment in the industry.”

Faker quietly said, “It’s easier to kill and protect if I work alone...”

Of course, he was talking about Satisfy… for now, at least.

The bodyguards gulped and laughed awkwardly.

"I-Is that so? Haha...”

We can’t control him...

The bodyguards felt strangely anxious and uncomfortable. Meanwhile, their escort targets greeted Lauel.

“Once again, I would like to express my sincere apologies for not being able to give you the closest seats,” Lauel said.

The presidents of the United States, China, and other countries had to sit in the front row regardless of the event they attended, but Grid’s wedding was an exception. They were guided to the third or fourth row of seats. Some of them didn’t like this, but they didn’t show it.

“Don’t worry. We are just guests. We can’t possibly take away the seats of relatives.”

“Thank you for understanding.”

This wedding was taking place between three people instead of two—Grid, Yura, and Jishuka. The seats in the first and second row were filled with their relatives. Fortunately, the three of them had similar circles of friends. Most of the second row was occupied by Overgeared members.

“Huh, I’m nervous...”

An elderly man in the first row wiped away his sweat with a handkerchief. It was Chairman Lee Jinmyung. The leader of one of the world’s largest companies was unusually nervous. Of course. After all, he was human.

Chairman Lee Jinmyung certainly was a natural leader, but it was difficult for him to remain calm in front of the big shots who controlled the world’s politics and economy. It was hard to believe he was sitting in front of them.

Just then, he suddenly became overcome with a strange joy...

‘This is killing my mood.’

Chairman Lee Jinmyung quickly adapted to the situation, shook off the nervousness, and even smiled faintly.

“I’m very glad to have such a good granddaughter.”

“That’s right, father. Thanks to my niece, today will be an unforgettable memory.”

“Unforgettable memory? Someone like you, who runs a business in your family’s name, is shrugging this day as a mere memory? How ungrateful... Think about what the politicians and businessmen present here want since they’re guests. They want Youngwoo. They traveled all the way here purely because they want to get along with my grandson-in-law.”

“T-That’s right. Of course I know that. I will take advantage of this opportunity.”

“Don’t cross the line because you are blinded by greed. Always keep in mind that it could be the end for us if you are rude to my grandson-in-law.”

“Right...!”

***

Huroi stood in front of the mirror. He was nervous. He was presiding over the wedding ceremony. His liege could’ve entrusted it to a more famous and important person, but he dared to ask Huroi.

Huroi was more afraid than happy. Could he speak properly in front of the people leading the world’s politics, economy, and culture?

He wasn’t playing a game. This was reality. He didn’t have the ability to do justice to his liege’s speech when he didn’t have skills such as Oration and Instigation.

“Huroi! Get ready!”

Peak Sword rushed toward him. Huroi’s face turned white as he asked, “D-Do you think I can do a good job?”

“Huh?”

Peak Sword frowned as if he was surprised by the question. He slapped Huroi hard on the back.

“You have been doing a good job so far. What nonsense are you saying now? Do you feel the need to back down? Haven’t you been a spokesperson for the Overgeared Guild and held a lot of press conferences so far?”

“How can you compare this to a mere press conference? Today is the wedding of my liege. This is the most important and historic event in the world. Do I deserve to host it?”

“Um... God Grid trusted you, so you must be qualified, right? I’m sure you’ll do well.”

“Is that... so?”

Huroi calmed down. Yes, his liege had entrusted him to do this. Of course Huroi would do a good job…

After happily exchanging high-fives, Huroi left the waiting room confidently.

After a while, the wedding began.

‘Um...?’

Huroi felt something change as he proudly watched the people in front of him. He couldn’t help being thrilled.

“This is still hard.”

“It can’t be helped since the average level of named-grade bosses has gone up.”

The day after Grid’s wedding, which had made headlines around the world, the Overgeared members gathered after neatly clearing away the field and dungeon bosses that had been neglected for the past few days. They all looked exhausted.

The raid boss monsters had become more powerful as the average level of the players increased, so it was quite tiring to raid them. There were many variations of bosses emerging from dimensional rifts.

“The stronger they are, the higher the drop rate of items. It isn’t all bad.”

“Where did Grid go on his honeymoon?”

“I heard he is traveling around the world. I hope they all take the time to enjoy it before they come back. The three of them usually do the most amount of work. Now that they have a chance to rest, they should make good use of that.”

“...Grid might not rest that much...”

“......”

Knight sat sullenly among his colleagues as they chattered after a rewarding day.

Death God Knight had been scouted directly by Lauel and was now a member of the Overgeared Shadows. He was the busiest person. He was responsible for inspecting all the territories in the empire and monitoring the private lives of the lords and nobles.

But, recently...

‘Won’t I become unemployed?’

...There had been no work at all.

Things changed shortly after Lord became emperor. The nobles were inspired by Grid’s epic that mentioned wanting to get rid of everything that people lacked, so they became nice, but seeds of discontent couldn’t sprout because Lord inspected the territories every day.

No matter how many cities, villages, or alleys Knight looked through, people were happy and at peace everywhere.

‘...Well, it doesn’t matter if I am unemployed.’

Knight relaxed as he remembered watching children playing everywhere with bright expressions. There was nothing wrong with being unemployed. He would be a high ranker even if he left the Overgeared Guild. He would have no problem with making a living.

‘I might spend some time in the hunting grounds for a while. I haven’t been able to level up recently. I was in a daze fighting against gods and all those otherworldly beings, but... I can’t let my guard down just because I have become stronger.’

Knight was planning what to do after leaving the Overgeared Guild.

Pon caught him off guard. “Hey, Knight. You don’t really have a lot of work these days, right? Rabbit complained that you are leeching money off of him.”

“...Haha, it seems that way.”

As expected of Rabbit. Even after becoming prime minister, he was still worrying about the salary of one inspector. Embarrassed, Knight laughed. The Overgeared members extended their hands to him.

“Aren’t you bored? Join our group starting tomorrow.”

“No. Knight should join us. Pon, you still have a lot of firepower.”

“Knight, we need you. Without Yura, we can’t guarantee our group’s safety.”

“Um... Knight, I know this is annoying, but you can take turns helping out. You can do that much for your friends, right?”

“Right.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Knight had become an inspector out of necessity. Now that he was no longer useful, he thought he would have to say goodbye to the guild. However, he was mistaken. The Overgeared members didn’t discriminate against him at all because he used to be a villainous gamer...

The smile on Knight’s face was as bright as the stars in the night sky.

***

The real name of the owner of the Overgeared Ranch, Nyangmong, was Kim Doohyun. He had been a famous Hollywood actor for a long time. Thanks to his outstanding acting skills and unique personality, he had received many offers from bigshots in the acting department.

He used to be the symbol of South Korea. Then, two years after Satisfy’s launch, the symbol of South Korea became Grid.

“......”

The events from the day before flashed through Doohyun’s mind as he watched Noe having fun herding sheep. Grid’s wedding had taken place in South Korea. There had been an excessive amount of very important guests. Whenever Doohyun saw someone important, which happened thousands of times, he thought, Oh my god, this guy is here too?

This had to be the first time in South Korea’s history that so many great people gathered in one place. Kim Doohyun was accustomed to interacting with celebrities, but even he couldn’t help being very nervous.

At some point, a reporter had come up to him and asked him which person he was acquainted with. Kim Doohyun couldn’t help wondering if it would be rude to point out someone in the crowd.

It was a useless worry. Everyone at the ceremony was looking at only one person—Grid.

‘Truly amazing.’

How many years had it been since Kim Doohyun had been completely liberated from other people’s gazes? Thanks to this, he could enjoy the wedding buffet in peace...

As he recalled these memories, Kim Doohyun hummed the Taming Master’s song happily. Naturally, all types of animals flocked to his side. Noe used a sheep as his bed and arrogantly conducted the flock along with one hand.

Dogs and wolves howled while bears and foxes danced. The wild beasts ignored commands and played as they pleased, so Noe scolded them.

Doohyun didn’t stop singing. The Overgeared Ranch located outside Reinhardt’s outer castle was a bit noisy, but this didn’t upset the people.

Thanks to this, Emperor Lord sensed the commotion in the ranch from the distant palace. He held his younger siblings in his arms and flew over. The hearing of a Transcendent was a great thing.

“Can we play together?”

Grinning, Nyangmong nodded. The animals warmly welcomed Lord and his siblings—

“Nyaaa! You pea-sized kid!”

—except for Noe. Lily had grabbed his tail again.
