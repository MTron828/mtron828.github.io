Chapter 1903

A god couldn’t be killed by physical means—King Sobyeol personally proved this fact. Coincidentally, the place where he opened his eyes again was in the Hwan Kingdom.

“You... why are you here?” King Sobyeol shouted. It was because Martial God Chiyou was beside him. Even after doing such a thing, Chiyou shamelessly didn’t leave the Hwan Kingdom.

Jingle.

Chiyou’s eyes didn’t shift to King Sobyeol as he tilted the teacup. It was utter indifference.

King Sobyeol was able to realize how much status he had lost and how much he had weakened due to the failure he suffered this time.

‘Above all, I lost my bow.’

The bow imbued?with the divinity of King Daebyeol—it was a divine object containing the great myth ‘War of the Gods’ and the creation myth ‘Arrow that Dropped the Sun.’ It wasn’t just in the Hwan Kingdom. Throughout Asgard, there were few divine objects with such value.

In particular, King Sobyeol couldn’t meet the activation conditions of the creation myth ‘Arrow that Dropped the Sun’ even with his status. This loss was indescribable for King Sobyeol, whose long-cherished wish was to completely own the bow.

His body started to tremble from the rage that was gradually rising inside him.

-Martial God Chiyou.

Then Hanul’s voice rang out. It felt like it was coming from a faraway place. It was majestic.

-What were you thinking when you broke Rebecca’s prohibition? I’m not happy about giving her strength.

The contents of the words didn’t make sense from King Sobyeol’s perspective. However, he had to notice one thing. ‘He was watching?’

Wasn’t Hanul?unaware of outside events when he was in seclusion?

‘It isn’t that he isn’t aware, but he pretended not to know...??’

King Sobyeol’s face turned white as he guessed this. There were so many things that bothered him.

Just then, Chiyou opened his mouth, “You are mistaken. I didn’t leak a single word about the truth contained in the yeouiju.”

-You are playing around with words in a manner that doesn’t suit you. Didn’t you give them enough hints? In order to do that, you must’ve broken the prohibition, right?

“I just warned him because Grid has reached the truth on his own. At that level, I didn’t have to break the prohibition.”

-...Do you really think it is all a coincidence?

The yeouiju that had lost its master—it was the reason why the Old Dragons and Chiyou couldn’t fight again. For the first time in their lives, the Old Dragons experienced oblivion and Chiyou lost hope. Instead, more humans were able to develop a longer history, but it meant nothing from Hanul’s perspective. Even if the time before the world’s destruction in the current cycle was extended, the result was still destruction. There was no value in Rebecca’s trivial outpouring of sympathy.

-...That is a stupid question. It must be a coincidence.

As the world went through several cycles of destruction and birth, the yeouiju without a master had always been hidden by someone. Even Hanul, who desperately searched for it in the beginning, eventually gave up.

Yet today—

King Sobyeol found what even Hanul couldn’t find. It was a miracle created by the overlapping coincidences made by Grid.

Hanul felt an immense power of fate. It was from Grid, not King Sobyeol. “It is a good thing you didn’t act rashly. Even if you had intervened, it wouldn’t have entered your hands.”

-...It isn’t just a matter of who gets it.

It was a series of crises.

The Three Masters, who had regained their strength for some reason, were very strong and accustomed to war. They established an effective linkage in tactics and strategy against Zik, Mir, and the Four Auspicious Beasts.

On the other hand, the Four Auspicious Beasts weren’t accustomed to battle. All they could do was amplify their innate attributes with divine power to suppress the rain and wind caused by the Three Masters. They wouldn’t have even been able to do this properly if they hadn’t learned magic from Braham.

[...It is amazing.]

The old god—the Three Masters were frankly impressed even though they had experienced Judar’s strategy, Dominion’s military power, and the force of the archangels in the War of the Gods. It was while they watched Zik and Mir cross the threshold of death several times to survive and grab onto their ankles.

[It is unbelievably strong considering your birth and life.]

[Mir, I wish you hadn’t betrayed us... no, you must’ve been able to grow this much because you left the Hwan Kingdom.

[In the end, it is all thanks to God Grid...]

The longer the battle dragged on, the darker the expressions of the Three Masters became. Not only did the great myth that allowed them to regain their ‘former power’ disappeared without a trace, but...

The Four Auspicious Beasts gradually became more proficient in combat. They developed really quickly as if to argue that the problem wasn’t a lack of strength, but a lack of experience.

It didn’t take long for the Three Masters to acknowledge that they had no chance of winning. The enemies were getting stronger while they were getting weaker.

The great myth, ‘War of the Gods,’ was supported to be activated, but it disappeared without a trace. It was crushed by Grid’s salvation myth.

-This energy...?!

“The Martial God...”

Then they felt Chiyou’s presence in the middle. Putting aside the fact that Mir, Zik, and the Four Auspicious Beasts became extremely nervous, the dark expression of the Three Masters didn’t brighten.

[The trend won’t change even if Chiyou comes.]

[I don’t have the slightest thought that your god will fail. At the very least, not yet.]

[I envy you, Mir. In the future, we will look up to you.]

The Three Masters retreated.

It was around the time when Grid stabbed the heart of King Sobyeol.

***

The designated coordinates?of Bunhelier’s Mass Teleport was the Tower of Wisdom, not Reinhardt. He was a dragon. There would be a lot of chaos if the Evil Dragon appeared in the middle of the city.

‘Besides, it is a hard-earned loot. I have to research it.’

Grid was unable to access the details of the yeouiju even with his appraisal skills. These items were usually meant to be appreciated by people who were well-versed in ancient knowledge and information. It made sense that the giant brothers, Radwolf and Fronzaltz, would be the right people.

‘If the two of them can’t solve it, I’ll have to ask Sticks and Braham. I hope it turns out well...’

Well, wouldn’t it be solved by the giant brothers, Radwolf and Fronzaltz?

Grid’s unwavering belief in the last survivors of the giants was unknowingly expressed.

“Squeak.” Bunhelier finished polymorphing into a mouse. At the same time, Noe bit his head...

“...Just like a trivial creature, your instinct prevails.” It was something that happened more than once or twice, so Bunhelier ignored it. Additionally, Bunhelier’s mind was now as wide as the sea. It was because the object that would soon belong to him had a more special value than expected. Didn’t Chiyou, not anyone else, speak meaningfully about it?

‘In fact, aren’t I actually qualified to be a dragon lord...? Did the others seal my strength and memories to keep my potential in check?’ Bunhelier thought.

What was the hidden truth?

Bunhelier smiled while imagining pleasant thoughts while his black fur was drenched with Noe’s saliva.

“...There actually was a yeouiju without an owner.”

Just then, Hayate and Biban entered the room after noticing Grid’s return. There was a considerable air of haste around them. They seemed to have a lot of questions to ask.

“Hey, Grid. You said you were going to find the yeouiju. Then what did you do again...?”

That’s right—the reason for Grid’s sudden decision to go to the east was just to confirm the existence of the object called the yeouiju.

Sword Saint Biban had personally witnessed Grid departing with a very light mindset, as if he was just going on an outing. However, just now, the world was covered with Grid’s epic. It was about overwhelming the great myth, ‘War of the Gods,’ and defeating King Sobyeol. It was a development that he couldn’t understand.

Hayate calmed down the somewhat agitated Biban. “Isn’t it just that King Sobyeol made a scheme and failed?”

‘...Is that what happened?’ Grid wondered.

Did I fall into King Sobyeol’s trap? I even hid my identity and went there. Yet he knew and prepared a trap?

‘Does this mean that I moved within his prediction range? King Sobyeol... he is more capable than I thought...’

In fact, Grid himself was in a more absurd position than Hayate or Biban. He thought Bunhelier was a mixed race, so he went to look for the yeouiju. Then all sorts of things happened and he wondered what was going on. But now he had some doubts.

‘I should move more carefully from now on.’ In the end, he could only come to this conclusion.

“......?”

Hayate and Biban were puzzled by the strange expressions that Grid was making. They had no idea of what was going on. Grid could only roughly explain it to them with words like, ‘King Sobyeol is more amazing than I expected.’

“Is Lord Radwolf in the workshop?”

“All the other tower members are away.”

“Uh...??They haven’t come back yet?”

Just before Grid had left for the East Continent, the tower members had left the tower to find Betty and Agnus. From the way they had spoken, the tower members had accurately pinpointed?the location of the two people.

The tower members dealt with all sorts of transcendent and even magic machines. Thanks to Radwolf, they were enjoying scientific benefits such as various radar devices. This meant that they could immediately arrive at the scene after identifying their target and achieve their goal.

Yet they hadn’t come back?

“Did something happen?”

Grid didn’t doubt Agnus.

That guy was reforming... rather, he was in the process of regaining his true nature.

Grid had been watching Agnus over the past few years and found that he was surprisingly close to a good person. Furthermore, Baal’s coercion had disappeared. Grid didn’t think Agnus would betray those who had shown him so much grace.

“I know you are worried, but there is no need. As you know, unexpected monsters and phenomena often appear in dimensional gaps.”

Certainly. On the way to the destination, they could’ve been caught up in some dimensional gap.

Grid thought so and jumped up from his seat.

“Calm down. Didn’t you come here after a huge incident? We will go out, so don’t worry and rest...” It happened the moment when Biban was about to push Grid back down onto his seat... Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He felt a wave of magic power. The tower members had returned.

“Oh, they’re back?”

The faces of the group brightened.

Grid was also relieved.

‘Yes, who would dare to get in the way of the tower members?’

After a while—

“Lady Betty, you...?”

Betty wasn’t wearing a robe when she returned with the tower members. Her hands and ankles were exposed...

“The curse... did you break the curse?!”

Her exposed limbs were?like that of ordinary people. Under Baal’s curse, her small body had only been bones below the collarbone. Now it was?restored to normal.

Hayate and Biban’s eyes reddened and Grid’s heart throbbed.

‘Agnus, you really did it.’

During the Baal subjugation, one of the things Grid had been concerned about was Betty’s personal safety. He knew that Baal’s death would lead to the annihilation of the former Baal’s Contractors. It was Agnus who reassured him.

Was it because he was also Baal’s Contractor? He said he had found a way to break the curse by going through related curses.

Honestly, Grid was uncertain. However, it didn’t make sense to keep Baal alive just for the sake of Betty... Grid could only rely on the feeling of grabbing the last straw and pin his hopes on Agnus. Then today, it was finally done.

In the midst of the thrilled atmosphere—

“Agnus... Agnus is dead,” Betty repeated in a hollow voice. It didn’t sound like nonsense. The tower members who brought her back lowered their heads with solemn faces.

“......??”

From Grid’s?perspective, this strange atmosphere didn’t make sense. The tower members knew that Agnus was a player. Did they need to mourn so much for his death...? Wouldn’t Agnus?be resurrected anyway?

‘No... I should focus on the fact that they are sad despite knowing he is a player.’

What happened? Grid felt the need to hear the story.

“Tell me in detail.”
