Chapter 1453

[Galgunos’ Soul has detected your call. He has ignored it.]

‘That’s it.’

Galgunos had just taken over Overgeared Skeleton Two’s body. Grid confirmed that he could be designated as a target of Granting an Ego. That was enough. Grid moved rapidly. He couldn’t help Overgeared Skeleton Two, who was suffering from being unable to control the magic power in Galgunos’ remains, but he could help Overgeared Skeleton Two, whose body was taken away by Galgunos. He could just squeeze this person out.

Grid planned to inflict enough pain that Galgunos wished he was dead and give up the body of Overgeared Skeleton Two. It would also assist with the use of Granting an Ego, pushing Galgunos thoroughly to the point that it was tempting.

[Galgunos]

The name that rose brightly above the head of Overgeared Skeleton Two filled Grid’s vision. Before he knew it, he arrived in front of Galgunos and used Kill at the same time. Euphemina missed some of the process. In her eyes, Grid’s movements seemed to be suddenly interrupted.

‘Very fast...!’

Mumud’s Successor was a magician after all. Euphemina had less agility. Still, the insight that she had trained and accumulated since the days of being a Duplicator was one of the best in the world. This meant she received considerable correction to her body’s dynamic vision. It was one of her greatest strengths.

The fact that she missed Grid’s movement was quite a big shock. Yet the real surprise was something else.

“......?!”

Galgunos’ thick, dark shield was something that could only be analyzed and disassembled by the characteristics of a Duplicator and Mumud’s magic, or pierced by Jishuka’s Breaking Evil Arrows. The shield that absorbed all normal magic and physical attacks broke instantly at Grid’s attack and scattered fragments of magic power?

‘How high is the attack power required to do this?’

Euphemina laughed bitterly when she recalled the moments she struggled with Jishuka to destroy Galgunos’ shield. She had a lot of feelings, but her mind and body didn’t stop. She used three magics simultaneously. She used the characteristics of a Duplicator to observe Galgunos and analyze his weaknesses. Then she used her rainbow colored magic power to induce decomposition and destruction.

Triple casting. It had reached the point of a genius.

Galgunos’ body emitted dark magic power from the wound Grid created and twisted in the reverse direction of the joints. The body grotesquely bent and due to the lighting in the underground training room, it was reminiscent of the shadow of a dried, old tree.

Mumud’s magic reversed the flow of magic power and caused the body to malfunction. This was the result.

[Again... this girl...] Galgunos stopped as he tried to counterattack Grid with the fog of magic power and his eyes were attracted to Euphemina. The red light of the eyes was full of anger and killing intent. He seemed to have a deep grudge against her.

It was natural. Lich Galgunos had already lost to her once. He was pulled out of the temple where he reigned as a god. Everything returned to nothing just before he achieved the dream of becoming a god using a lich’s body. Galgunos would resent and curse Euphemina forever and ever.

However, it shouldn’t happen now. The one second where Galgunos and Euphemina’s eyes met. In that second, Grid moved his sword dozens of times. The combination of the Formless Sword and Link was destructive. Dozens of sword trajectories appeared, each with their own spiral while a ‘hard to recognize blind spot attack’ was also launched. The swordsmanship was completed in just one second. It was more like a phenomenon. A phenomenon that caused a disaster.

“......?!” Grid’s expression hardened as he was cutting Galgunos. It was because around 80% of the attacks scattered like a mirage without touching Galgunos’ body.

‘Spatial distortion!’

The ultimate in space magic. It was a great magic that transferred any object, phenomenon, or even concept to another space. It was similar to Lantier’s Shadow Movement, but it was one level higher. Shadow Movement was a technique that moved the body to another shadow, while the usage of a spatial distortion was endless. Of course, it was a magic that couldn’t be easily used, even for Braham. It was because every time the magic was used, catalysts made with ‘horandia’ were needed and were consumed. It wasn’t something that could be obtained just because of money.

A chill went down Grid’s spine as he retrieved the Formless Sword that had entered and left the unknown space.

‘It turns out that this guy...’

He had the catalyst formulas engraved on his bones. It was unexpected that they could create a catalyst that could distort space.

‘...Good.’

Astonishment turned into joy. The scene of Overgeared Skeleton Two using space distortion magic unfolded in Grid’s head, increasing his motivation.

[You... are quite strong.] Galgunos, who hadn’t been very interested in Grid, spoke to Grid for the first time.

“You too.” The moment Grid answered, Galgunos used Blink. His destination was behind Euphemina. Grid immediately followed with Shunpo and stabbed at Galgunos, but it was shortly after Galgunos’ magic had already struck Euphemina’s back. Shunpo wasn’t an all-rounder in all situations. If the other person moved through space first, then it was natural for him to be a step later.

[You are nothing without that woman who can use the power of breaking evil.] Galgunos looked ecstatic when he saw Euphemina coughing up blood. There was little change in the expression, unlike the Overgeared Skeletons, but his joy was clearly revealed.

‘This jerk doesn’t care about it.’

Grid realized he was being ignored, but he wasn’t agitated. His side would be very comfortable if Euphemina was pulling the aggro. He calmly used Pinnacle Kill. There were two tricky things about Galgunos. First, the power of a lich’s Mana Shield that was always activated would absorb a significant amount of damage. Second, many of the attacks that penetrated through the Mana Shield were affected by ‘Spatial Distortion.’

Once again, the Kill part of Pinnacle Kill was sucked into the distorted space. It wasn’t known where it had been, but the Formless Sword was soaked in muddy water. During the time when Grid retrieved the sword, Galgunos and Euphemina were engaged in a first exchange of attacks and defenses. Wounds appeared all over Euphemina’s body.

Grid protected Euphemina with the God Hands while taking off Lee Jeong’s training tools set. In that short period of time, Euphemina suffered a new wound. “Ugh!”

The situation was funny. The magic she fired into the air was blocked by the God Hands, causing the God Hands to stiffen. Then Galgunos easily pierced through the gaps that Euphemina showed. The God Hands were proof that this was a fight they couldn’t read. Euphemina predicted Galgunos’ route while the God Hands were more likely to sabotage Euphemina.

“Sorry!”

Grid accumulated fighting energy because he had taken off the training tools and regained his original stats. His speed was like an instantaneous flash of lightning.

“Huh? You don’t have to apologize for this much.”

Euphemina was flustered because she didn’t know when Grid had come to her side. The shield in his hand was blocking Galgunos’ magic bombardment that was pouring in from the side.

‘Really... It is on a different level. Is it too much to be a support?’

Euphemina had missed a chance to fight back due to being hindered by the God Hands. Nevertheless, she maintained her composure and smiled widely, unable to suppress her excitement. It wasn’t a bright smile. Her eyes were blazing with fighting spirit.

This fighting spirit was her essence. She was a bigshot who had reigned as an unofficial ranker since the launch of Satisfy until now. She might be a ‘conditional’ powerhouse, but this made her sharpen her temperament of a winner and her senses were sharp.

“Feel free to run wild. I’ll support you as much as I can.”

Euphemina had a hunch. The current partnership with Grid was a chance that would never happen again. Galgunos was too strong an enemy and Grid’s movements were one level higher than her own. The moment she succeeded in identifying Grid’s intentions and worked together with him to take down Galgunos, her skills would increase one step further.

“Yes.”

Grid nodded without saying much. It meant he was highly focused. He was also aware of it. Galgunos was impossible to defeat in a normal way. The Spatial Distortion magic that had a 80% chance of invalidating any form of attack and the lich’s unique infinite Mana Shield...

The key was to break the flow of Spatial Distortion and Mana Shield. Then what could be done against the magic that was always activated?

‘Jishuka’s Breaking Evil Arrows must’ve played a really big role.’

There were too many tricky prerequisites for overpowering Galgunos. It was a super named boss with a terrible level of difficulty. He thought it was a good choice not to challenge Galgunos prematurely. Even if he challenged it, the probability of the raid failure was high.

Of course, this was a story before he made ‘this.’ Grid placed the Formless Sword in the inventory and pulled out the Fire Dragon Sword and Falling Moon Sword at the same time. The items were combined like flowing water and the long sword with flames that were like moonlight was held in his right hand.

The Transcend sword dance generated intense air waves. Fenrir’s cloak fluttered and the hard ground of the training room was torn off, the debris floating in the air. Unlike the turbulent space, Grid’s gaze was calm as he held the sword in the center. No emotions could be read on his face. This was why it was hard to figure out his intentions. Even Euphemina, who was preparing to keep pace with Grid, was flustered because she couldn’t predict his next move.

[You...?]

Galgunos’ reaction was extraordinary. Grid noticed something from Galgunos’ reaction, who was distracted the moment the Falling Moon Sword was pulled out.

‘It is an ancient existence.’

Galgunos could create a catalyst for space distortion through ancient secret techniques and knowledge. Why couldn’t he recognize the moon night iron?

[......!]

“......!”

Galgunos and Euphemina had wide eyes. The storm centered around Grid still stayed with Euphemina, but Grid, who caused the storm, was right in front of Galgunos. The two of them were aware of the concept of Shunpo, but the triggering of Shunpo combined with the brilliant effect of Transcend displayed a ripple effect that took away the souls of the two people.

The great thing was that in the meantime, Euphemina’s magic was pouring out from behind Grid. It would’ve been the perfect support if she activated it one second earlier.

[Galgunos’ Soul has detected your call.]

Galgunos’ astonished expression overlapped with the notification window on Grid’s retina. The Fire Dragon Sword, wrapped in the cold flames, was already about to reach Galgunos’ core.

[Galgunos has answered your call.]

“......”

“......”

The sword that was roaring as if to tear the world apart stopped. Galgunos, who was staring fiercely at Grid, suddenly smiled. The name that appeared above his head was Overgeared Skeleton Two. It was the name Grid gave so the more he saw it, the more wonderful he felt the name was. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“...What is this vain end?” Euphemina’s words resonated through the call room.
