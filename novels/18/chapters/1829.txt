Chapter 1829

The field boss’ hierarchy was the lowest among boss monsters. Not only could it not be compared to a named boss, but it was weaker than a dragon boss or elite boss. Naturally, the level of items that it dropped was also low. Instead, it had the advantage of a short respawn cycle, so it was suitable as a stable resource supply and for achievements. 

Of course, there were exceptions such as the Guardian of the Forest. The lake’s giant illusionary body was also an exception. It was a very special one. 

Unlike the Guardian of the Forest, which evolved into an elite boss only at certain intervals, the giant illusionary body was powerful from birth. In particular, the higher the level of the player challenging the raid, the stronger it became. Therefore, it was necessary to be prepared. 

The rewards were enormous. 

‘It really drops 12 pieces at a time.’ 

Grid raided the giant illusionary body at the lake for the third time and smiled with satisfaction. He even felt affection for the illusionary body that always dropped 12 ancient enhancement scrolls every time. It was only for a moment. 

‘No, shit, did it mostly drop accessory enhancement scrolls again?’ 

This time, it was only 6 pieces, but it was 8 pieces just four days ago... 

It seemed like it had a certain probability and it wasn’t a coincidence. The clear evidence was that the armor enhancement scrolls, which he needed the most, were dropping the least. As expected, the S.A Group was the source of all evil... 

Wasn’t it the S.A Group who created the distorted hell in the first place? He even suspected that they created and ran Satisfy for the purpose of harassing people. 

Biban’s voice crept into Grid’s ears as he was holding the bundle of scrolls. “I couldn’t properly test the power of the sword again today. I can’t wait to go to hell and cut down Baal. By the way, can you keep postponing the expedition to hell like this?” 

“We have secured all the transcendents and legends that can be targeted by Baal. Baal can’t play tricks any longer, so it is better to drag out time. I’m sure you are bored, but please be patient a bit longer.” 

Grid was steadily receiving the ancient enhancement scrolls and Kraugel was supplying the marks. There were too many ways to make the hell expedition stronger. The story would change if certain variables arose, but so far, time was on the side of humanity, not Baal. 

In the first place, it took time to gather the transcendents and legends scattered across the continent in Reinhardt. 

‘Baal’s search ability is beyond imagination. We need to summon the escort targets to at least within the range of the Overgeared World.’ 

The problem was that the escorts had their own lives and the transcendents were so eccentric that it was difficult to forcibly assemble them... in any case, it was a necessary procedure. He didn’t want to do a rough job and make a mistake because they were hard to control. 

“Ah, take this.” 

Grid handed Biban an enhancement scroll. It was while trying to prevent his hands from shaking. 

Biban stared at it. He had an expression like he was thinking about something. 

Soon, he nodded and received the scroll. “Thank you. I will use it well.” 

“I’m always grateful to you. I’m sorry that you come here every four days to work hard, but I’ve only been able to give you one piece.” 

“Are there only one or two people you need to take care of? I understand it.” 

“You haven’t used the two scrolls I gave you before, right? If you don’t mind, can I apply them for you? I am a bit lucky.” 

It wasn’t nonsense. Grid’s good luck stat was very high. It was to the extent where even professional players who made a living off gambling couldn’t dare to surpass him. Additionally, he possessed a passive skill that increased the chances of enhancement. It was a skill he had ever since becoming Pagma's Successor. 

“...Um, don’t worry about it.” Biban glanced at Grid’s sword and armor and shook his head. 

Grid was frustrated. 

“This was because of exceptionally bad luck.” 

Currently, Defying the Natural Order and Fire Dragon’s Armor were +1 each. He tried to strengthen it with the enhancement scrolls he got on the first day the illusionary body died, but he only got it to +1. The high good luck stat was overshadowed. It could simply be seen as being unlucky. 

However, Grid guessed that the higher the rating of the equipment, the lower the probability of enhancement. 

“Still, I assure you that it is better for me to enhance it than you, Biban.” 

“I understand. I’ll ask you to do it later. More than that—” 

Biban’s concern seemed to lie elsewhere. He quickly skipped over the topic related to enhancement and brought up unexpected words. 

“Why don’t you call Hayate and Marie Rose in four days?”’ 

“......?” 

“I think there is a high chance they are stronger than me. You will be able to raise the level of the illusionary body to a higher level.” 

The lake’s illusionary body copied and mixed toward the appearance of the strongest enemies. Currently, Grid and Biban were the strongest here. Therefore, it copied and mixed the appearances of the two people. Then what if it faced someone stronger than the two of them? 

It would be much stronger than it was now and the level of the items it dropped could also increase. Who knows? It might drop 20 scrolls instead of 12. 

“Um...” 

However, Grid was reluctant. It was for two reasons. 

First, would the dragons be happy to see Hayate’s activities on the surface for personal reasons? The Gourmet Dragon and Fire Dragon showed similar, weak goodwill toward Grid, but Grid and Hayate were two different existences. From the perspective of a dragon who was wary of or desired a Dragon Slayer, it would be difficult for them to sit around as Hayate’s activities increased. There was a risk of creating an unnecessary disruption at a critical juncture. 

Secondly, Marie Rose’s position should be considered. She said that she needed time. She pushed back the schedule even though she could break the curse by marrying Grid. She seemed to be agonizing over her future. 

‘She seems to be questioning whether the life she is living to fulfill her mother’s aspirations is really her own.’ 

Grid thought that perhaps they were questions she had been harboring for countless years. Therefore, she hadn’t been active in her role and had been on the sidelines for all types of events. Braham’s hatred toward her explained it. The case where she was obediently sealed by Chreshler was similar. 

‘It isn’t a human thing to ask her to help at perhaps the most important moment of her life.’ 

After a while— 

“Now that I think about it, you are right.” 

Biban was convinced when he heard the reasons why Grid was reluctant. 

“It wasn’t a good idea in the first place. I wonder if I would’ve been able to control myself when seeing with my own eyes Marie Rose, who is stronger than me.” 

Certainly. The huge illusionary body naturally arranged the ‘order’ of enemies. A person with a strong sense of pride or desire for victory might be unconvinced by the order set by the illusionary body and make trouble. 

‘The Overgeared Guild has been in an uproar for a while.’ 

He wondered if it had something to do with why the Overgeared Guild’s PvP promotion battles had been so active in recent months. Grid thought about this and was ready to go out. 

The vampire cities—he planned to visit the castle where Marie Rose lived. 

He felt obligated to not leave her alone when she was already in agony. 

‘She is my fiance after all.’ 

It was a relationship where they had to rely on each other from now on. Furthermore, Marie Rose had saved Grid from danger several times. Grid couldn’t turn away from her unless he was an ungrateful beast. 

“Then I’ll see you again in four days.” 

Grid bid farewell to Biban and went to the warp gate. The closest city to Marie Rose’s castle that was located deep underground. He planned to move to the primarily industrial city of Reidan.

Buzz buzz. 

Reidan was a place where all types of industrial facilities were gathered and it was noisy. It was so lively that it was hard to believe it was the city that had once collapsed due to the dragon’s invasion. However, looking closer, it could be seen that everyone was being careful. Even as they were moving in a hurry due to their busy work, they only moved along a certain route. The soldiers on the watchtowers placed at certain intervals didn’t take their eyes off the sky. 

They were wary of a dragon suddenly appearing again. At this point, caution had been ingrained in their bodies. 

‘It is understandable.’ 

The city was first attacked by Xenon, swept up in the fight of the dragons pursuing Xenon, and it most recently witnessed the emergence of Fire Dragon Trauka. For Reidan, a dragon wasn’t only a monster in the myths and legends. It was a real threat they had experienced several times. In fact, there were many victims and bereaved families. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that many of Reidan’s residents suffered from PTSD. 

Of course, the Overgeared Guild also took countermeasures. A large army was sent and stationed there in order to reassure the residents. Additionally, they planned to relocate the residents, except for essential technicians, to other cities. 

But the residents didn’t want to leave the city. This was originally what being a person was. They couldn’t easily abandon their hometown. 

“...Hmm.” 

Was there any disturbance? Grid looked at the city with the Hooded Zip Up covering his appearance. Then he laughed. It was a pleased laugh. It was because he witnessed the Asuka and Black Teddy duo. During the time when Xenon attacked Reidan, they protected the residents and joined the Overgeared Guild due to this. They chose Reidan as their home under the pretext that they wanted to hunt the illusionary bodies near Reidan. 

It was obviously a lie. For top rankers like Asuka and Black Teddy, the hunting grounds near Reidan were somewhat below their level. But they insisted on staying in Reidan. 

‘They must’ve gotten attached in the process of fighting to save the residents’ lives.’ 

In addition to that— 

“Aren’t the dragon bastards coming today?” 

“Young Lady, please refrain from saying this. Rumor has it that a dragon’s hearing extends across the continent.” 

“No, isn’t it too frustrating if I just let it go without dealing a proper hit? The next time we meet, I am confident I can deal some blows before dying. That is the only way I will be satisfied.” 

“What if people get swept away?” 

“You don’t have to worry. Lauel only has his brain. Do you think he hasn’t come up with a countermeasure?” 

...Asuka’s pride was too strong. According to Kraugel, Grid was the only one she had ever given in to without a fight. 

‘She lost to Kraugel ten times, but still attacked whenever they made eye contact.’ 

Over the years, Kraugel and Asuka had naturally ran into each other as high rankers. Every time, Asuka challenged Kraugel, lost, and repeatedly attacked him again. Her challenge always stopped when she died. Kraugel always intended to end it with moderate suppression, but he confessed that he was fed up with Asuka’s insistence of fighting to the death because she didn’t think it was a big deal to lose in the game. 

‘A persistence that makes even Kraugel tired of fighting...’ 

Indeed, she was also a candidate for an angel. 

Step. 

He thought about things over and over again. Before he knew it, Grid had arrived at Marie Rose’s castle. 

A deep, dark corridor—after passing through the paintings of the hellscapes, he was able to reach the coffin. 

“I didn’t expect Dear Husband to come and find me first.” 

The seductive voice made Grid’s mind dizzy. 

The human figure draped over the coffin—Marie Rose was still beautiful as she sat cross-legged on it and looked down at Grid. 

“Are you going to impregnate me today?” 

“...That is after marriage.” 

Grid blushed and tried to calm down. He had to gather his energy in order to make a child. It wasn’t the time... 

“I came here simply because I was worried about how you were doing.” 

“Worried...?” 

Marie Rose cocked her head like she didn’t understand it. Then she soon smiled. Her eyes curved like the crescent moon and she seemed to be performing some type of magic. 

Grid’s heart exploded. 

“Yes, I see.” 

Marie Rose stood up and took a few steps. She slowly started to approach Grid. Her dress, which made a sound every time it dragged on the floor, seemed to be as soft as her white skin. 

“I was also worried about Dear Husband. You are going to hell soon, aren’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

“I’m repeating this, but beware of Amoract.” 

“Amoract... I heard she interfered with Baal by intercepting Beriache’s soul that was about to fall into Baal’s hands. She even asked for an alliance with me, so she seemed genuinely hostile to Baal.” 

Grid was also planning to cooperate with Amoract. Of course, he had no intention of trusting her. They were just on the same boat for a while. Marie Rose said he couldn’t even do that. 

“There is no way, but you shouldn’t cooperate with her even if she would sacrifice her life for Dear Husband. Don’t show her even the slightest gap. The Great Demon of Conflict is more dangerous than you think.” 

“...Yes.” Grid didn’t speak for long. The reason he explained his relationship with Amoract in the first place was to ask for advice, not to refute Marie Rose’s words. 

Marie Rose smiled with satisfaction. “Huhu, I hope you don’t blame me too much for not being able to be with you, even though I know that Dear Husband is approaching obvious danger.” 

There was a lot to think about in many ways. Killing Baal with her own hands meant fulfilling her mother’s wish. For some reason, she kept thinking she shouldn’t do this. There was no basis for it. It was something instinctive. She didn’t explain it to Grid. What she wanted to share with Grid was love, not worry. 

In the first place, it was unfamiliar for her to discuss her problems with others. It was a difficult concept to come up with. 

“If you don’t mind, why don’t you show me around the castle?” 

“...What is there to see in this dark castle?” 

Grid’s suggestion made Marie Rose’s eyes widen for a moment. A rare look of bewilderment flashed across her fair face. It was fleeting. She soon regained her relaxed smile and held out her hand to Grid. 

“Hold me if you don’t want to be a missing person.” 

On this day, Grid strolled with Marie Rose through the serene and dark castle. It was a surprisingly calm and enjoyable time.
