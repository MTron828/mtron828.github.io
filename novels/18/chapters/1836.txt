Chapter 1836

“...It is disappointing in many ways.”

Baal stared at Grid’s new sword—the sword that broke the curse chains—and rose up from his throne. Then he slowly stepped down the thousands of stairs from the high throne to the great hall one by one. His red eyes were fixed on Grid.

All types of status abnormalities overlapped and weighed down on Grid. It gave the sense that he was being targeted by all CC techniques present in Satisfy. Grid felt a huge sense of pressure. Putting aside resisting the status abnormalities, he was horrified and overwhelmed by the result of one of Baal’s ‘gazes.’

“Manipulating myths in real time to turn the flow to your advantage... It is the attitude of a lowly cheater. Isn’t it the same as before?”

With every step he took down the stairs, the demonic energy emitted from Baal’s entire body thickened. The vast hall that contained even Bunhelier’s huge body started to shake.

“Speaking of which, it seems you are relying on Bunhelier and the dragon weapon just as before. You haven’t improved at all.”

‘Is there a Xing trash game like this?’

Grid’s heart sank.

The decent manner of speaking.

The low, solemn voice.

The appearance that overwhelmed everything.

Baal’s appearance was different from before. He didn’t just enjoy the situation and wield force. Instead, he acted with a certain intention.

The intention? It was obvious. Baal was also conscious of the epic. He maintained his posture so that the epic didn’t dare to mock him. He didn’t want people to be ‘surprisingly’ afraid of him, so he arranged his words and actions so they were ‘forced to be afraid.’

It had an effect. People’s fears deepened again. The epic had stagnated because it couldn’t disparage Baal and worship Grid.

‘It is seriously a trash game.’

Grid continued to inwardly swear. He had expected that Baal would be much stronger than before. However, he had never imagined that Baal would’ve evolved to the level of using the system—the epic. He might be a super named boss, but wasn’t this infringing on a user’s rights at this point?

‘...Ah.’ Something flashed in Grid’s mind. It was the past Rebecca, who gave divine messages and blessings to himself and some players.

Hanul of the Hwan Kingdom, who singled out the desired group and distributed a large-scale quest.

Chiyou, the Only One God who greatly increased his abilities under the pretext of ‘potential.’

That’s right. The Absolutes were already using the system from the very beginning. They moved people and the world as they intended. It was just so obvious that he hadn’t noticed it. Conversely, players had also intervened in the system by creating quests on their own. The epic was the ultimate power.

‘The right to move the world doesn’t just belong to me.’

The world that used to move around Grid stopped. The epic was still silent. It finished describing Baal’s appearance and watched the situation in silence. It knew this wouldn’t help Grid, but it couldn’t help it.

Baal’s force was so great. It was more likely to harm Grid if it described things recklessly.

The 1st Great Demon—the source of all evil that had distorted and usurped hell. In more ways than one, he was no ordinary enemy.

“......”

Grid’s eyes changed when he became aware of it. As he focused his sight on the gradually approaching figure of Baal, he visualized the battle that would soon ensue.He abandoned the arrogance that he was the only protagonist of this world and the illusion that only he had prepared for this moment.

In the world of dead silence—

“Yes, that is the look. It is right to be desperate against me.” Baal’s voice rang out. The smile that spread across his face represented his feelings. He was having fun. It was purely fun.

Baal’s figure disappeared. Ignoring the steps he had taken one by one so far, he jumped over thousands of steps in one go and arrived in front of Grid. It wasn’t until Grid’s body flew far away that an explosion rang out. The recoil as he blocked Baal’s raised shoulder with his sword shifted his position back hundreds of meters.

“Um.” Bunhelier snorted. He was trying to understand the seriousness of the situation and to keep calm.

He had seen it just now with the eyes of a dragon—it was the purple body part that rose like an illusion in line with Baal’s movements. It resembled Asura’s head that was decorating the gate. It meant that Baal had transplanted Asura’s body parts into his body.

“......”

Bunhelier used Polymorph. He abandoned his big body and turned into a handsome man with black hair. It was an act to move stealthily. Meanwhile, Grid was in the midst of his sword dance, Pinnacle. It was a blow that halted Baal’s advance.

‘It is crazy.’

He barely swallowed back the curse words that almost popped out of his mouth. Having just been ambushed by Baal, he knew that this battle would be harder than expected. He was embarrassed to think that Baal would flee to the river of reincarnation when on the defensive.

“It ended with a bit of your skin peeling off, right?”

Grid scanned Baal’s shoulder and right wrist in turn. They were the areas that had just collided with Defying the Natural Order. Grid had intended to slash Baal to death when blocking Baal’s shoulder with Defying the Natural Order or when stoppoing his advance with Pinnacle. But he couldn’t cut Baal.

Both Baal’s shoulders and wrists fully bore the destructive power of Defying the Natural Order and were intact. It was the aftermath of the purple body part emerging like an illusion and suppressing the power of Grid’s sword energy and Conditional Sword Saint.

The pure offensive power of Defying the Natural Order was lost to a large extent in the process of penetrating the demonic energy used as a self-defense power. As a result, Baal’s hard skin easily handled the remaining destructive power.

“You said you were going to make a true Evil God different from Yatan and then you were going to devour it?”

The more formal ‘you’ had been changed to the impolite ‘you’—it was evidence that Grid had lost his cool. Even during the brief moment when he spoke, he was tense and too busy observing Baal’s every movement to make any pretenses.

“It is still new. I only borrowed it for a while, just like my clones.”

Even the clones on the surface were accompanied by parts of Asura’s body. There was no reason why the main body couldn’t handle Asura. It was only natural for him to handle it in a better manner. Then Baal’s straight kick hit Grid in the jaw. The absolute defense that was activated was broken and Grid’s bleeding body flew hundreds of meters away. It was close to the ceiling of the great hall, which had already collapsed.

Baal immediately chased after him and unleashed dozens of strikes. With the flair of a martial artist who had been training all his life, he repeatedly hit, cut, grabbed, and threw Grid’s entire body with dazzling movements, before finally slamming him into the ground.

“Kuk...” Grid groaned as he was slammed into the ground face first from hundreds of meters in the air.

Baal was laughing because he thought it was a good look for Grid, only to frown. He noticed that his ankle was in Grid’s hands. The grip was so powerful. It was a level that was hard to shake off immediately.

‘It would’ve been suitable even if someone called him a God of Strength.’

Baal’s eyes unknowingly harbored such sentiments and his expression crumpled even more. He noticed that Grid’s groan was actually laughter.

“I got you. You X jerk...”

The fortunate thing was that the epic was silent. Thanks to this, Grid felt relieved enough to express his true thoughts. In any case, the cameras of the broadcasting stations were far away. They couldn’t capture Grid’s voice because they couldn’t chase after Grid and Baal, whose location rapidly changed.

Turning the World Upside Down—this skill had a history of putting even Sword God Biban into the ground and had a tremendous effect since it was affected by Grid’s stats. The fact that Baal’s form resembled a human also had a great influence. The super named boss who originally should’ve resisted the CC was overturned. He fell to the ground face first, just like Grid.

Grid stood up in the gap and immediately stabbed downward with Defying the Natural Order. The fusion sword dance based on Pinnacle and Kill became entangled with Baal’s fingernail. As befitting of a man who moved in defiance of physical laws, Baal was able to respond to the attack under any circumstances. He was almost lying down as he countered a series of attacks from Grid.

Baal grinned as he restored his nails that were broken after several collisions by regenerating them. “It is fun. As expected, it is good to be alive.”

This was usually the case with fights between Absolutes, but the battle between Grid and Baal wasn’t properly established. The moment they allowed each other’s ultimate attacks, it would be difficult to continue the battle. Therefore, it would be concluded in almost an instant.

However, it was different this time.

Grid and Baal—they were durable enough to withstand the overwhelming attack of their opponents. It meant they could enjoy it to their heart’s content.

The genuinely excited Baal glared at Grid like he was going to kill Grid.

How disgusting. A demon bastard who easily hurt others. He was grateful for life.

“You... Do you think others will be like you? Life is precious to others as well.”

“It is sophistry,” Baal immediately rejected it, “A finite life is worthless. What is the point of a life that only reaches death? I would rather die quickly and fall to hell. It is only when you come here that you can find any value.”

A conversation was impossible. After being reminded of Baal’s essence, Grid started to use the five fusion sword dance and six fusion sword dance. The techniques that caused Baal to die several times in the past had unfolded one after another.

“......!”

The smile disappeared from Baal’s face. The sword energy, divinity, and powers formed on the rushing blade scattered every time it approached Asura’s body, but this didn’t mean much.

[Critical!]

[The target has received 79,554,405 damage!!]

[Critical!]

[The target has received 120,623,800 damage!!]

[The target has received 301,889,777 damage!!]

[The target has received 676,244,050 damage!!]

Sword energy, divinity, and powers—they were all incidental.

Grid’s strength was his pure power. Stats far beyond the level of a player. Items that amplified his high stats and exerted great power. Skills to bring the powerful weapon damage to the limit along with stats. All the titles that multiplied the power of his skills.

Grid was purely powerful.

“...Kuack!” In the end, Baal screamed. Skin that withstood the dragon weapon and nails that pierced the dragon armor—it was the aftermath of the new body that was formed based on his experience and knowledge from the clones being disastrously crushed.

The last boss? It was familiar to Grid. In any area, there were those who were like the final boss and they got in Grid’s way. Most of their endings were similar. After being reduced to a sandbag to measure Grid’s damage, they were then turned to ashes.

...The final destination of that ash was always Baal.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“......?!”

Continue, continue, continue. Just a little bit more. Just one more step.

Grid stiffened as he was repeatedly slashing and stabbing at Baal, trying to split him apart with gritted teeth.

[The 1st Great Demon, ‘Baal,’ is immune to ‘Drop Dragon Pinnacle Kill Wave.’]

The absurd notification window made it so. The flow of the sword dance was interrupted. Baal took advantage of the gap that Grid briefly exposed and acted at high speed. He completely recovered in an instant and retrieved the demon sword that had been exchanging blows with the God Hands.

The black demon sword became incandescent. It was the power of a God Killer.

Grid’s heart was instantly pierced with the glowing demon sword. It was a blow that silenced the cheering viewers.

“Do you know?” Baal’s voice permeated the ears of the staggering Grid. “You have killed more beings than I have.”

The path that Grid had walked. All of his journeys had made Grid who he was now.

“It was quite a chore to find their souls and absorb and hone their knowledge and information. Now it has turned out quite rewarding.”

It was at this moment that Grid’s ankle was grabbed for the first time.

The 1st ranked Great Demon, Baal—the source of all evil brought the god of the surface to his knees.
