Chapter 1883

“Don’t you like my suggestion?”

Grid’s expression was stiff. He asked Zeratul to accept the title of Overgeared. It was an expression of trust and goodwill.

Grid highly valued Zeratul. A being in the ranks of the strongest in the world—to put it bluntly, how many beings on the surface and in heaven could stand up to Zeratul? He even had the power to produce skill books.

It was naturally valuable. He wanted to shake off the past and have a true relationship.

However, Zeratul’s response was very disappointing. It was hard to be happy because his goodwill was rejected.

“Um...” Zeratul reacted cautiously. It wasn’t an exaggeration. He was really keeping an eye on Grid. It was because his absolute pride as the Martial God had been shattered when he met Chiyou. Furthermore, he was determined to live as a member of the Overgeavred World. It was only natural for him to keep an eye on Grid.

“I know the meaning of being overgeared.”

From the time that Grid became the Overgeared God, the gods of Asgard also learned and understood the meaning of the word overgeared.

Relying on battle gear—it was unwelcome from Zeratul’s point of view.

“As I said before, I will continue to be the Martial God. Relying on battle gear? I don’t want that. My last remnant of pride... I can’t accept it.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Zeratul hesitated for a moment before speaking. It was because he recalled Grid’s Defying the Natural Order. The treasured sword that allowed him to stand up to Chiyou. It was so powerful. He was fascinated in an instant and wanted to make it his favorite weapon.

However, a tool should always be a tool. He couldn’t rely on it. Zeratul was convinced that it would act as a poison.

Grid nodded. “It is the will of the Martial God, not anyone else, so I will respect it. But it is a bit shocking... it turns out I am a guy with no pride...”

Grid’s murmur was very faint. Except for the reply that he respected Zeratul’s wish, the rest was talking to himself. However, Zeratul was an Absolute. His overwhelming hearing clearly captured even Grid’s low words to himself.

‘How should I react?’

Originally, Zeratul was an extremely arrogant person in Asgard. He unconditionally prioritized his own will without considering other people’s feelings. This was the nature of the being who had been the Martial God since his birth. The current situation of having to pay attention to Grid was very unfamiliar.

“My apostles and the tower members. My guild members and the army of the empire... they were all fools with no pride...”

“......”

Grid was even the narrow-minded and very stubborn type of person. It meant Zeratul met the wrong person. Zeratul had no resistance to hold out at all against Grid, who constantly scolded him by pretending to talk to himself.

“The people who believe in me and follow me have no backbone or courage...”

“Stop.” Grid’s self-talk started to go too far and Zeratul eventually failed to stay still. “I’ll think about it a bit more.”

“You don’t have to do that if you don’t want to...”

“No, I’m being serious. I can’t get the sensation of using your sword out of my mind.”

Really. The sensation of cutting Chiyou’s flesh with Defying the Natural Order was clearly engraved in Zeratul’s mind.

In the first place, he was the Martial God. He had mastered all martial arts and there were no weapons he couldn’t handle. He shouldn’t rely on weapons? That was too one-dimensional.

‘If I put it that way, I shouldn’t even rely on martial arts.’

...Wasn’t this too extreme?

‘No.’

Zeratul recalled who he was.

The Martial God. There was an inseparable relationship with martial arts. Meanwhile, weapons were tools that completed martial arts.

“Huh...?”

A thunderbolt flashed in Zeratule’s mental world. It was the aftermath of having an epiphany. He needed multiple weapons and Grid had a knack for making the most powerful weapons. The relationship between him and Grid was inseparable...

“...I see. It was like that.”

In the past, he—

Why did he hate Grid so much? Why did he obsess over Grid and take risks every time?

‘It is because I knew instinctively that Grid was what I needed.’

However, he didn’t admit it. He would’ve felt great shame the moment he admitted that he, the lofty Martial God, needed a lower status existence.

“I was foolish in my ways...”

He is doing this on purpose.

The suspicions he had for a moment that Grid was constantly scolding him with the self-talk were completely erased. Unlike before, Zeratul’s gaze toward the world was clear and transparent.

Only Hexetia noticed the change. It was because he had been watching Zeratul for a long time. He had also experienced the same changes that Zeratul was experiencing at this moment.

‘What?’

He just didn’t understand why Zeratul had changed. From his perspective, Zeratul had been staring at the grumbling Grid only to suddenly change.

‘...He has unique tastes.’

Hexetia’s eyes filled with deep misunderstanding followed Zeratul.

Zeratul was turning his back to Grid. “Okay. I will try to be the Overgeared Martial God. I had better do that to let the world know that I am distinctly different from Chiyou.”

“......!”

Lauel’s face turned white and Euphemina secretly clenched her fists.

“However, there should be a price.”

Step, step.

Zeratul walked away with these words. It was toward an area where hundreds of young beauties were concentrated.

“Eh? You can’t do this...”

The surroundings were in an uproar. The beauties that Zeratul suddenly had his eyes on while talking about the ‘price.’ They were those who already had a master. The hundreds of people were the escorts and girlfriends of Prince Lord. Zeratul, who had a history of trying to kill Lord, was now trying to become Lord’s love rival.

There was great tension.

“......”

Lord stepped in front of the women. He directly met Zeratul’s eyes with his big and bright eyes. There was no trace of gulping or his legs shaking. He showed a strong will rather than fear against an Absolute who was two heads taller than him.

A strange smile spread across Zeratul’s face. “Grid, in exchange for you giving me items, I will give a blessing to your children.”

In fact, Grid owed a debt to Zeratul. He was able to rescue Hexetia and Khan due to Zeratul’s help. If Zeratul had turned away from Grid—

In the worst case, even Grid himself might’ve been held for a while in the Prison of Eternity.In the first place, Zeratul should be the strongest force of the Overgeared World. Grid naturally planned to arm Zeratul. He had no intention of receiving payment for it.

However, Zeratul refused. He said he would pay a fair price and placed a hand that was the size of a pot lid on Lord’s head.

“Dark hair and sharp eyes. There are some areas that look surprisingly like your father.”

What is with the word surprisingly...? The reason why Lord is so tall and handsome is because he is my son in the first place.

Grid clicked his tongue in a dumbfounded manner and glanced at Lord. He was telling Lord not to be anxious and to wait. Lord trusted his father absolutely. He remained calm even after being caught in the hands of an Absolute who tried to kill him in the past.

Zeratul’s smile deepened even more. “I am different from Chiyou.”

Chiyou—he amplified the growth rate of the target by forcibly bringing out the potential of talented people. The steps that must be taken in order to grow in a normal way were omitted. It was the manifestation of the selfish will to achieve his desire of ’I want to meet an opponent and be killed.’

Of course, he couldn’t be blamed for using the wrong method. It was because of Grid. The existence of Grid proved that Chiyou’s method wasn’t wrong.

But was it the right answer? Zeratul wasn’t convinced it was. For him, the martial arts that he thought of were something that shone only when he devised and practiced them himself. For example, Grid’s sword dances. The sword dances currently used by Grid were very different from Pagma’s Sword Dance. It was strongly honed through Grid’s experience and hard work. Putting aside the blessing given by Chiyou, it was an achievement obtained by the individual called Grid.

That’s right. Ironically, Zeratul’s ideas were completed through Grid. He realized it after losing to Grid one after another and going through a series of defeats. The decisive moment was the emergency incident involving Venice...

Zeratul’s anger flared up when he remembered the past. Still, he continued with a frown.

“My blessing won’t be as convenient as Chiyou’s one, which causes ‘potential’ to blossom at every desired moment. I don’t have the power to defeat someone overwhelmingly stronger. However, your hard work and enthusiasm won’t be betrayed. This will serve as a springboard for expanding your possibilities yourself.”

Flash!

The white glow that came from Zeratul’s eyes wrapped around Lord’s body. At the same time, a miracle happened.

[Your son ‘Lord’ has received ‘Zeratul’s Blessing.’]

[Zeratul’s Blessing]

[All types of mastery skills are blooming.

There is a master level 3 increase for all skills.

Increases skill experience acquisition by 300%.

Increases character experience acquisition by 200%.]

“......”

It was an effect that was permanently applied. Lord trembled at the feeling of the power of Zeratul’s Blessing and a smile spread across Grid’s face.

Zeratul took his hand off Lord’s head and added a few words. It was an apology. “I’m sorry for what happened in the past. I shouldn’t have turned the grudge I had for your father toward you. I was narrow-minded.”

“...It is understandable.”

I wouldn’t have been composed if I was beaten like that every time by someone like my father...

Lord was smiling awkwardly without being able to say the next words. Then his eyes widened. The same was true for the other people present. Everyone’s eyes were focused on Mercedes.

“H-Huh?”

It was due to the light that flickered in Mercedes’ abdomen.

Zeratul’s voice permeated into Grid’s ears as he sensed the anomaly and was rushing toward him. “What are you flustered about? I told you beforehand that I would give a blessing to your children.”

“......?!”

A notification window appeared in the vision of the surprised Grid.

[The child inside Irene’s womb has received ‘Zeratul’s Blessing.’]

[The child inside Basara’s womb has received ‘Zeratul’s Blessing.’]

[The child inside Mercedes’ womb has received ‘Zeratul’s Blessing.’]

[Marie Rose has fought off the divine blessing trying to infiltrate the child in her womb.]

“......”

In fact, it wasn’t even surprising. After the Baal raid, Grid fulfilled his wish with the ‘Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time’ and dedicated himself day and night. He acted as if he had ten bodies in order to make his wives happy after they had suffered from loneliness because he could only function once a month. It was the fruit of hard work and love...

Overcome with emotion, Grid hugged Mercedes tightly.

On this day, the rumor about Grid being unable to have any more children ended.
