Chapter 1770

[...Yes.]

Fire Dragon Trauka slowly raised his head. The deep, long pit on the ground was a sign of his jaw being stuck there. It was a symbol of the unprecedented event made by a vampire who did a six step dance.

[I admit it.]

The scales of Trauka’s head, which had been smashed by a powerful attack, quickly regenerated and joined together. The procession of red scales that adsorbed into each other without leaving a single gap was like a wall. It was an endless wall that couldn’t exist on the surface. It was a wall that the heavenly gods couldn’t cross and gradually painted red with their own blood.

[The world has changed.]

Dragon who reigned in the world before my dear husband was born...

Trauka reflected on Marie Rose’s words. He took it seriously, rather than hastily denying it.

Certainly, the world was different from the one that Trauka remembered. In less than a year, he had already been hurt twice. The first wound was dealt by an unfilial child who didn’t care about her father’s position at all, and the second was dealt by a mad vampire.

The two of them had something in common. It was the fact that they wielded the power gained from the newly born Only One God, Grid. Yes, he was the one who created this unprecedented event. He proved that the world had changed by inflicting two wounds on Trauka, who had ruled for eternity.

[The influence of an Only One God isn’t something to be ignored. It is so shocking that I can’t help thinking back to when I first saw Chiyou.]

Why did the dragons sign a nonaggression pact with the gods? It was because it was Rebecca’s will. Trauka had decided that it would be unwise to confront Rebecca. Thus, he made a promise and kept it. Technically, he was controlled.

Meanwhile, Chiyou was different. Perhaps the only one Rebecca couldn’t control was Chiyou. It was to the point where he saved Hanul, who thought he was going to die.

Trauka had to admit it. An Only One God was special and Grid was also an Only One God. But—

The total amount of ‘specialness’ was different for each existence. Moreover, Trauka himself was special.

[But that is it. I don’t think Grid’s influence is enough to make me apologize.]

Dragons don’t forget.

Trauka clearly remembered Beriache’s abilities. She could reproduce the power of the target whose blood she sucked from the minimum to the maximum. In order to reproduce it again, there was a condition that the blood must be sucked again. Reproducing it to the maximum meant sacrificing something. This was even assuming that Marie Rose was better than Beriache.

Currently, Marie Rose was in a state where the ‘blood was consumed’ and partially ‘damaged.’

Drop Dragon—she wasn’t in a position to use that arrogant sword technique of dropping dragons again. She couldn’t afford to make any more variables.

[One who bears Beriache’s grudge. The world will seem very simple to you. It is divided into whether your mother’s vengeance is accomplished and completed, or whether it fails and can’t be completed.]

Trauka’s huge eyes contained the universe. It had a colorful glow and contained a history unknown to modern humans. There were countless experiences and emotions.

[However, the real world isn’t as simple as what you know. This isn’t the domain of an individual. There is too much at stake.]

The flames intensified as the Fire Dragon’s breathing intensified. The presence of the wounded old dragon swelled beyond his size. He proved that he was the center of the world.

Marie Rose wasn’t intimidated. Who was she up against now? She had never forgotten for a single moment. Putting aside her calm expression, she had been prepared to die when she came here. There was no grand reason. She just wanted Grid to be respected. He was the man she chose.

[...I think it would be less frustrating than this if I sat down and talked to that jerk.]

Trauka noticed it.

The vampire in front of him—all his words were entering one ear and going out the other. The serene eyes were the proof. The desire in those red eyes was the same from the beginning to now.

[You are crazy.]

Marie Rose’s vision sank downward. The ground she stood on was completely smashed by Trauka’s tail, which had moved like a thunderbolt. Then a battle took place in the Realm of the Absolute, where the fragments of the collapsed ground had completely frozen.

Marie Rose and Trauka crossed the debris and relentlessly threatened each other.

Trauka’s lair, which was huge enough to hold several mountains, collapsed in an instant. If observed from the outside, Trauka’s lair resembled the moon at first glance. It was like the moon sunk to the ground. It was because it was round.

Trauka’s nest that he carved out of a few mountains was a realm of art that couldn’t be surpassed by a human level. Now a small hole was drilled in the lower part of it.

A stream of fire pursued the woman who shot out noisily from the pierced hole. It was a Breath. It was the first time Trauka showed off a proper weapon.

[Go to hell, one who bears Beriache’s grudge. It is better for you to wallow in a worthless life, just as you have been doing all your life. Isn’t that the reason for your insignificant existence?]

The Fire Dragon was the worst type of opponent for Marie Rose. Trauka was wrapped in flames of willpower that melted anything and they repeatedly evaporated Marie Rose’s blood before she could try anything. He sealed her blood magic and power in real time.

Even so, Marie Rose showed no signs of agitation.

A monstrous existence—she didn’t hesitate to fight in strength against an old dragon.

She pierced through the flames and scratched Trauka’s scales with her nails. Before the scars in the scales could heal, she inserted her hand that had shapened like blade and ripped them apart. In order to crush his body, she grabbed the flying tail and threw it away, exposing the belly of the dragon under her feet.

There was a sound like a balloon popping. It was the noise from Trauka’s belly as it was trampled on by Marie Rose’s small, white feet. Anyone would mistakenly believe that a hole had been drilled. Yes. It was an illusion. Even if a mosquito stung a human, there was no way the human’s skin would explode. The difference in physique between Marie Rose and Trauka was so great that it could be compared to that.

It was obviously like this.

‘...This person, no way?’

Trauka raised his fierce eyes. The skin of his belly was convulsing. He tried not to make it obvious, but the pain of being trampled on by Marie Rose was surprisingly great.

‘She didn’t lose anything?’

It was a little while ago. Marie Rose recreated Grid’s swordsmanship using the blood of the Only One God. It must’ve been Grid’s ultimate move. In other words, she wielded the Only One God’s ultimate skill as if it was her own strength. She naturally would’ve paid a heavy price.

If it was Beriache, her strength would’ve decreased by half. However, Marie Rose showed no signs of weakening at all.

‘You created a monster that exceeded expectations.’

Beriache—beyond taking revenge on Baal, perhaps she also wanted to establish a new guardian in hell?

‘Poor thing.’

Trauka snorted and accelerated his speed. His huge wings moved so fast that they blurred and twisted the trajectory of things around them. The number of Marie Rose’s missed attacks became frequent. Occasionally, her fingernails would graze Trauka’s scales, causing sparks to fly and her fingernails to fall off.

The fire dragon’s body was heating up. As he entered the atmosphere, his body glowed like a meteorite burning from the frictional heat. It was a physical phenomenon created by combining the speed of an Absolute with the flames of willpower.

Steam spread every time the wounds on Marie Rose’s body increased. It was the aftermath of her flowing blood evaporating immediately.

‘I’ll blow her as far away as possible.’

The dragon’s long tail was clinging to the skin of his belly. The moment the Fire Dragon reached a certain speed, he was going to expand and show off a tremendous force that would blow Marie Rose to the other side of the continent. Finally, the tail fell away from the belly and stretched out like a whip. It struck Marie Rose’s small body.

Marie Rose couldn’t hold on. Her body would shatter the moment she tried to hold out against the flow of power. Of course, she wouldn’t die from this much. However, it would be impossible for her to regenerate immediately because it consumed a lot of stamina. It was like asking for danger.

Trauka thought that Marie Rose would obediently leave this place. He predicted that she would save her own life by going along with the flow of power of the tail and flying away. It was natural. Marie Rose was different from Ifrit. She might be crazy, but she had no reason to cling to Trauka at the risk of her life. However...

[......]

Marie Rose showed more obsession than necessary. The moment she was struck by his tail, she didn’t choose to fly away. Instead, she planted her feet on the ground like a tree rooted in the ground. She raised her arm to block Trauka’s tail and held on.

The price was severe. Both arms were shattered. Some of the sides of her body couldn’t be protected by her arms and were destroyed without leaving a trace. Her blood evaporated without a trace. Her unsightly figure neatly stretched out like slaughtered livestock.

[Are you going to die here? Why are you pushing yourself so hard? You have a separate duty to carry out, right?]

Trauka felt excruciating pain. His tail had also exploded in the aftermath of Marie Rose’s collision with his self-defense. A weapon he had been boasting about for eternity was horribly damaged. It didn’t recover easily. It was because he also drained his physical strength. In the first place, he wasn’t in a perfect condition.

On the contrary, Marie Rose’s red eyes were regaining their vitality as she met his eyes. Her Curse of Sloth had been briefly shaken off due to the pain.

“Trauka, do you know how your child feels?”

[......?]

It was a strange question. Trauka cocked his head.

“Have you ever understood the feelings of your child in the egg who must’ve felt relieved when feeling the signs of you sleeping soundly next to her?”

[...What are you saying?]

The topic started to diverge completely off track. Trauka once again realized that the vampire in front of him was purely crazy. It was natural since she didn’t respond at all no matter what type of conversation he tried to have. Then she suddenly started talking nonsense.

“I’m sure you haven’t thought about it.”

Marie Rose remembered.

The day of her birth. The moment when the hand that reached out to hold his mother’s hand was thrown away.

The way Trauka overlapped her with her mother every time he treated her as ‘the one who bears Beriache’s grudge.’ In Marie Rose’s opinion, Trauka, who preyed on his children, resembled Beriache, who made her children bear the burden of vengeance. It was the attitude of treating children as the tools of their parents.

“You might not understand, but hell and Baal aren’t my concerns.”

Therefore, she was discussing her duties about hell and Baal without a second thought.

Marie Rose got back to the point.

“Apologize to my dear husband.”

Just then, Trauka’s gaze shifted to the sky behind her, rather than Marie Rose. A sunset that didn’t suit the deep night was coloring the sky. A familiar presence was coming. It was the presence of Only One God Grid.

[Do you believe in him?]

Trauka laughed.

[I just experienced Grid’s ultimate skill through you. Purely thanks to you, I am certain that he isn’t a big threat to me.]

Just in time, Trauka’s tail finished regenerating.

Marie Rose’s arms had also been restored to their full, intact appearance. However, Marie Rose’s sides hadn’t recovered yet. Marie Rose staggered as steam persistently rose.

[Grid’s joining won’t change the situation.]

Trauka’s laughter turned into ridicule. Then it happened in an instant. He aimed for the moment when Marie Rose turned her back to him as she stared at the approaching sunset.

Trauka fired a Breath. It was intended to drive out both Marie Rose and Grid completely.

“I never reproduced my dear husband’s ultimate skill.”

He ignored the nonsense that entered his ears.

“To be precise, there is no way to reproduce it.”

Marie Rose’s six fusion sword dance was definitely powerful. Despite suffering from the Curse of Sloth, her stats transcended Grid’s. But was her sword dance really more powerful than Grid’s sword dance?

“I can’t exceed the potential of the target whose blood was sucked and I don’t have a dragon weapon.”

No, rather, it was weak. The six fusion sword dance reproduced by Marie Rose was missing ‘Twilight’ and ‘Ultimate Martial Art.’

Grid approached while ignoring the Breath that melted his body and slashed at Trauka.

‘This...’ Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Trauka had a hunch. It was dangerous.

[I, can’t be, cut.]

This was why he gave up his pride and urgently shouted the Dragon Words. A new providence was overlaid on top of his absolute defense and scales. It was a principle and law that governed the natural world.

Twilight, held in Grid’s hands, repeatedly slipped without cutting Trauka’s red scales. Twilight spun in Grid’s hands. It was held in reverse.

“Serve Dragon Pinnacle Wave Kill Link.”

It was simple. Grid couldn’t cut, so he stabbed.

It pierced Trauka’s huge body.
