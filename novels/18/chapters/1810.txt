Chapter 1810

Jingle, jingle, jingle...

Sariel’s exclusive weapon was very different from Grid’s expectations. A chain connected with the halo. To be precise, it was a chain woven by shrinking the halos. It was like a long earring that hung down to the pelvis. Every time Sariel moved, it rang and made a clear friction sound. The sound was too clear to be metallic and it was somewhat like a thunderbolt. He wondered if this was the sound of light colliding.

The halos of an angel, made by Only One God Grid in a state of mental world unity with Sariel, the angel who reveals sin.

The bones and scales that contain Fire Dragon Trauka’s intent have been tempered with Sariel’s divinity.

It is a divinity that is contaminated with deep distrust and resentment, but was purified by the trust they had in Grid. Unlike the divinities handled by the celestial gods, it is pure and optimized for blessings.

However, the moment when the crimes of the targets defined as enemies are revealed, it will suddenly change and exert strong killing power.

Conditions of Use: Sariel, Grid.

Weight: None.]

“It is as pretty as your heart.”

Honestly, in terms of beauty, it was the best of all the works Grid had made. The pure admiration made Sariel hesitate a bit out of the thought that Mercedes might have a competitive spirit if she saw this. It was because Sariel felt this was an atmosphere where it would be right to have a female appearance.

It was an obvious misunderstanding. Grid had a number of wives and lovers, but it wasn’t because he was blinded by lust. They just shared pure love. Perhaps it was the result of trying to respect the other person’s feelings. In technical terms, it meant, ‘I didn’t stop the women from coming.’ There were too many relationships involved to prevent it.

For example, Irene’s relationship with Basara was politically intertwined. Of course, that was just how it started. Grid loved his wives wholeheartedly. He wasn’t just falling in love out of courtesy. All of them were so charming that they naturally fell in love over the years.

Sariel was also aware of the situation. This was why Sariel, who hated the lustful celestial sinner, trusted Grid. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Let’s go.”

Sariel’s mental world was a bit overwhelming for Grid to handle.

The virtual divinities lurking in the fictional Asgard—there was a lot of pressure even though he knew it was fake, not real. If Sariel’s enemies ever set foot in here—

In particular, if the protagonists of the fictional divinities stepped inside here, they would probably be in a lot of trouble.

‘I can put Sariel on the battlefield in the future, so it will be a great help.’

The system expressed that Sariel’s divinity was purified. There was plenty of room for interpretation that there was no possibility of running wild even if Sariel left the Overgeared World. In fact, he checked Sariel’s status window and the warning of the risk of running wild was no longer present. It felt like he had won thousands of troops and horses.

Grid smiled with satisfaction as he returned to reality once again. The people who were waiting were stunned. They were dazzled by the chain of light that swayed as it connected to the halo that hovered above Sariel’s head.

“It is like an accessory woven with light. It is definitely prettier than star candy... Cough.”

The commotion grew as Pon’s spear slammed into the side of Peak Sword, who was speaking nonsense.

“You are heading to the tower, right?” Jishuka asked while tidying up Grid’s clothes. They were reminiscent of a couple, but for some reason, Mercedes’ animosity wasn’t directed at her. Nefelina’s cheeks swelled up like a balloon.

“Yes, I don’t know about the other members, but Biban and Hayate’s mental worlds definitely exist.”

“Travel safely. In the meantime, we will study as much as possible on how to open up the mental world.”

“There is no need to rush. You can use normal dragon weapons until you open up the mental world. They are powerful enough.”

Defying the Natural Order and the apostles’ exclusive weapons were really powerful, but Twilight was still one of the strongest weapons.

Of course, ordinary dragon weapons that couldn’t use Greed as a material should be regarded as weapons below the level of Twilight. However, if they were all made into growth items, then it was expected that they would be on the same level in the future.

The individuality of the Overgeared members was that outstanding.

“I’ll be back.”

Grid didn’t delay. He went straight to the Tower of Wisdom.

Hayate and Biban—in terms of force, they could be evaluated as unique ‘humans’ comparable to the current Grid. Developing them was an important task even in the context of human history. It was a duty that Grid must be responsible for. Apart from this duty, he also had a strong curiosity. Grid was so curious about how strong they could become that he couldn’t sleep properly for days.

“Welcome.”

Grid had the honorary position of the 10th Seat. The location of the Tower of Wisdom was always communicated in real time and he could freely enter and exit.

“Why do you have to come to greet me? Are you treating me like a guest?”

Grid laughed as he watched Biban running out with socks on. Of course, the expression ‘run out’ wasn’t accurate. He obtained the status of Sword God that had never existed before and his feet didn’t touch the ground. He floated in the air. It was one of the miracles performed by the sword energy that was always active.

“Wouldn’t it be rude if a family member came and I didn’t greet them?”

Likewise, there was excitement in Biban’s eyes as he answered with a smile. His eyes were full of the experience and wisdom accumulated over the years. It made Grid want to rely on it.

[The swords you possess are responding to Sword God Biban.]

[Biban’s sword energy is caressing the swords.]

[The spirits of the swords you own have become sharper. The chances of a beneficial effect occurring increases with the weapon’s attack power.]

[The ego of the ‘Fire Dragon Sword’ has fallen into ecstasy. It is further enhanced.]

‘...I really have to rely on him.’

During the time when Grid was admiring the Sword God’s ‘passive skill,’ Defying the Natural Order in the inventory seemed to flinch and floated into the air on its own without Grid’s permission. Biban’s will made it this way.

The smile on Biban’s face gradually deepened as he examined Defying the Natural Order that floated right in front of him. “You’ve captured yourself in this.”

“Yes, it was possible thanks to the help of God Hexetia and Khan.”

“It is a precious relationship. Be good to them.”

Just as I promised I would be good to you.

Biban swallowed down these words and led the nodding Grid to the top floor of the tower. This was where Hayate’s office was located.

‘He is still the same even though he is on the same level as Hayate.’

Biban had great respect for Hayate, who was older than him. He took it for granted that Hayate would have a conversation with Grid before he did.

He thought it was just that.

“...Huh?”

Grid’s brow furrowed the moment he got closer to Hayate’s office. There was a magic power so strong that even the tower’s barriers couldn’t completely hide it despite being able to deceive even a dragon’s senses. It wasn’t until he got close enough that there was only a single door in between them that he sensed the ominous magic power.

‘How did someone invade this place?’

No, he didn’t wonder how. He wondered what type of guts this person had. It was the moment when Grid pulled out Defying the Natural Order and squeezed it.

“Gasp.” The sound of someone’s gasps came from beyond the door. It was a voice familiar to Grid. The voice belonged to the owner of the ominous magic power.

“Calm down.” Biban patted Grid on the shoulder and slowly opened the door.

“You have become more prominent.”

Hayate stood up from his seat and gave his usual greeting. It wasn’t just a polite greeting. Grid’s reputation was rising day by day. So for Hayate, he tried to carefully chose the most suitable greeting but the content of the greeting was always the same.

Grid bowed respectfully to him and slowly raised his head. It was from the feet to the face of the man sitting opposite Hayate. He examined this person clearly without blinking once.

It was a man whose hair—black enough to swallow up light—hung down to his waist. He had the name ‘Bunhelier’ above his head. As Grid sensed, it was Evil Dragon Bunhelier. The difference was that his face was whiter than before.

“You, what guts do you have to aim at the tower...?”

Grid didn’t look down on Bunhelier. He was inferior to other Old Dragons because he fell into Baal’s trap, but he was still an Old Dragon. He didn’t want to run into Bunhelier as much as possible. However, he was also the only one among the Old Dragons that he judged as ‘must be killed.’ It was impossible to let such an unpredictable villain live for Nefelina’s sake and for the sake of world order and security.

Additionally, this was the Tower of Wisdom. There were two Absolutes next to him that he could carry out a joint attack with. Grid saw a golden opportunity and was about to release killing intent.

“Look at this first.” Then Bunhelier pointed to his neck. His long, white neck was shackled with something akin to a dog collar.

Bunhelier was confident. “I didn’t invade, I was captured. You can calm down, Only One God Grid.”

“......”

What made him so confident?

Just as Grid’s mind wasn’t able to keep up with the flow of events, Hayate and Biban explained it to him.

“He surrendered himself and expressed the desire to cooperate with the defeat of Baal.”

“I’m sure you also expected to collaborate with Bunhelier. It is right to say that your prediction came true in a pretty ridiculous form.”

“...Why didn’t you come to me?”

“Isn’t this place the Overgeared World just like Reinhardt? It just happened like this.”

He couldn’t go to Reinhardt because he was afraid of Trauka’s endless energy that he sensed... Bunhelier was unable to confess honestly and his anxious eyes briefly glanced at Defying the Natural Order. It contained faint astonishment like it was an unbelievable sight.

“Come, let’s start negotiating.”

Finally, the impatient Bunhelier urged.

Hayate and Biban looked at Grid. Of course, the main protagonist of the negotiations had to be Grid. Yet contrary to his expectations, Grid shook his head. “There will be no negotiation.”

“......?”

Biban laughed like he was having fun, while Hayate cocked his head.

“...Why?!”

Bunhelier’s eyes widened and he jumped out of his seat. His face was shocked, as if he had been shocked by lightning and electrocuted.

Grid explained, “I judged that I can kill Baal without your help. I don’t need you.”

“How can that be?”

Bunhelier burst out in a dismayed manner.
