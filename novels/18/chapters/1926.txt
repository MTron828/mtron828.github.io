Chapter 1926

“I think his madness got worse, right?”

Zeratul clicked his tongue as he silently watched Grid disappeared and reappeared a few times using Shunpo, before finally disappearing underground.

Zeratul had been Grid’s enemy for many years and he only recently became an ally. He was able to evaluate Grid more objectively than anyone else. Zeratul thought that Grid, who didn’t seem to know his opponent, had been crazy since he was a human. Now looking at him, Grid seemed even crazier.

Breaking into Trauka’s lair? It was right that it was the best plan.

It was impossible to use a defense strategy when fighting against dragons. Dragons could destroy the fortresses that humanity built all over the continent with a single flap of their wings. Unless every city was covered with a lid, all of human civilization would disappear into ashes with a single Breath from a dragon.

The best strategy was to attack Trauka and force the dragons to take the defensive. The problem was that Grid was going alone. This went beyond arrogance and was suicidal.

“His Majesty is a bit far from normal, but he isn’t incapable of discerning things. He won’t overdo it. I think he will probably focus on buying time while we recover by attracting the attention of the enemy. I don’t know if it is a well-thought out plan or if he is just doing it instinctively, but...”

Lauel’s words trailed off as he was giving the explanation. Even he had a hard time seeing Grid’s true intentions. He was also distracted. It was because he heard that Nathaniel, who visited Grid in reality, talked meaningful nonsense. He didn’t think there was any solid basis for her prediction, but he was reluctant to just ignore it. He realized that his hair loss was going to worsen again for a while.

“Let’s take a break for now. I have to check the rewards I received.”

As Lauel was worrying about hair loss, the person with a bald head stepped in. Lauel became even more anxious, but he put aside his personal feelings for the time being.

“Yes, do so. I even opened special stats and new characteristics despite only being ranked 173 in the raid. However, I haven’t adapted to them, so I wasn’t able to use them properly against the angels. Those who performed greater than me have probably acquired skills, so I think you will all have to work hard for a while to adapt.”

“173rd? Why are you number 173? Why are you higher than me?”

The world message only mentioned the top 20 individuals who contributed to the defeat of Trauka. There was no way to figure out who was ranked more than 21st place unless they were a participant. Vantner’s ranking was 200th. He was far below Lauel, who retired from active duty a long time ago. Vartner couldn’t understand it at all.

Lauel shook his head. “You never blocked a Breath, right? Do you think a tank who failed to play the role of a tank deserves to be jealous of his colleagues?”

“Kraugel cut the Breath of the Fire Dragon. What do you expect me to do? Instead, I blocked magic and storms several times.”

Lauel said, “I changed the climate and weakened Trauka a little bit.”

“Didn’t you only weaken it by 0.01%?”

“Trauka was so powerful that this was enough to be recognized as the 173rd place contribution. Even if you managed to block some magic at most, the contribution of the tank who couldn’t save his allies and survived alone is bound to be lower than me.”

“What would people do if the magic exploded and caused splash damage...? This is unfair.”

“You are dwelling on trivial rankings. In any case, humans are greedy and narrow-minded. That’s why there are so many people obsessed with my secret techniques. Tsk.” Zeratul glared pitifully at Lauel and Vantner, who were arguing over something trivial. Then he sat down on the sand.

It was a situation where Saintess Ruby was looking after Braham. Zeratal had to recover on his own and he was capable of doing so. He changed the cycle of divinity and focused on recovery, causing his wounds to heal quickly. However, the various types of resources consumed when he used all types of martial arts were still depleted. He would have to recuperate for at least half a day to ensure full completion.

“4th place.”

“......?”

Zeratul was trying to concentrate on recovery when he doubted his ears. He slowly opened his eyes and saw the half-dead person lying across from him.

“I guess being 4th place is embarrassing. That is why you dismiss and turn away, disparaging the rankings that contributed to defeating the Fire Dragon as insignificant.”

The identity of the half-dead person was Biban. He was still upset by Zeratul’s attitude of looking down on humans.

Zeratul’s temples twitched. “The guy who would be wandering through hell by now if it wasn’t for me is talking shamelessly. The way you are barking in an unruly manner is like seeing a dog.”

“I am 2nd place. Doesn’t this mean you are worse than a dog?”

“If I had arrived at the battlefield earlier than you, I would’ve been in 2nd place.”

Zeratul’s conscience didn’t allow him to say he would be 1st place. Hayate’s performance was that unique.

Biban snorted. “Your 2nd place reward would’ve been paid in hell.”

“Why does this guy keep barking? I am the Martial God. Are there only crazy people here?”

Zeratul’s face, which was always red, heated up as if it was about to explode. The tip of his raised eyebrows that looked like an upside down sickle trembled.

As the atmosphere became unusual, Piaro approached. He was going to mediate between them.

Before Piaro could say anything, Zeratul opened his mouth, “Farmer.”

A farmer was an apostle of God? Some people might’ve showed discomfort, but Piaro’s expression was bright. To him, being called a farmer wasn’t something to be ashamed of. It was a title that was higher and more precious than anything else. It was a job that expanded his life.

Zeratul also understood—the experience of being able to breathe easier once Piaro caused all types of plants to grow in the desert heated up by Trauka was very impressive.

“Is there no alcohol? Sometimes alcohol is made after a harvest.”

What type of drink did he ask from an apostle of a god? Someone should’ve scolded him, but everyone instead kept their mouths shut. It was because Piaro took out a jar and was gladly handing it to Zeratul.

“You are good at looking at people. My wife is an elf.” Piaro raised his head. Proper communication was the way to open up people’s hearts.

Zeratul took a gulp of the alcohol in the bottle and his face turned red again. “My anger is cooling down a bit. Maybe it is because your wife is from a race that makes alcohol from dew. You are an alcohol maker.”

“I’m flattered.”

“Don’t you have yours? Let’s drink together.”

“Okay.”

The heavenly gods naturally enjoyed drinking. They lived for eons and had nothing to do, so it was a common occurrence to lie down and drink fruit wine. Looking back on it now, those who just drank and wasted their time were good. Strangely, it was those who didn’t drink who caused accidents. It was just like Judar.

‘That isn’t necessarily the case.’

He still caused trouble even after drinking. He had an extremely short life compared to other gods.

Zeratul’s eyes gradually deepened as he reflected on it. All the years he spent doing nonsense to prove he was the Martial God felt fleeting. He just liked this moment. Fighting with some reliable people against incredibly strong opponents erased his complicated ideas and made him feel relieved. He was able to gladly hand over the bottle of alcohol even to that rude guy.

“You drink too.”

“... I will do so.”

Biban grabbed the bottle that Zeratul had thrown to him and gulped down the alcohol. He didn’t like this lunatic who had been going around on a rampage for a long time while believing he was the Martial God, but it was clear he received this person’s help. He was certain that no one here would’ve survived if it wasn’t for Zeratul today.

“It is good.”

The clean grain wine that contained the beliefs of a farmer who was once Grid’s teacher—Biban realized that his world had become huge. It was good in many ways compared to the narrow world of the tower.

The tower members and other apostles started to gather around them.

“You would’ve died if you had been attacked even once by an angel. It was lucky. It was really good luck.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ruby was relieved as she was treating Braham. It was a situation where the bleeding from the wounds that didn’t heal naturally exceeded the regenerative capacity. Braham’s life had been on the verge of being extinguished.

“I wasn’t lucky.”

Braham shook his head as he recalled the sight of Grid covered in blood while fighting the angels.

“Your brother protected me.”

Ruby’s face, which was exhausted from using heals all day without a break, softened even more.

People who faced the risk of death because her brother took Rebecca’s side—she clearly knew that her brother was responsible for the terrible war that took place today, but she didn’t blame him. She was so thankful. She was proud and happy that her brother, who used to have no friends, had made friends with such kind people.

Did he read her mind clearly?

Braham snorted as he stared at Ruby’s ever-changing expression.

“The reason we respect your brother’s choice and risked our lives isn’t just because we like him. We just believe he made the best choice.”

“Isn’t that the same thing?”

“That is true.”

Braham looked up at the sky. The clear sky was very clear after the golden clouds disappeared. His heart gradually became lighter as he thought about how Mumud was living a disease-free life somewhere out there.

Then he suddenly became angry. He was bothered that the topic of conversation of the people who suddenly started drinking over there was ‘rewards.’

“I should’ve fought Trauka too.”

He chased Grid to the East Continent for nothing, got involved in the fight between the Old Dragons and Chiyou for nothing, and was defeated like this... he was the only one who didn’t participate in defeating Trauka and didn’t receive any rewards, so he suffered a huge loss.

It might be different if he had become an Absolute, but he almost died and lost his status.

“Braham? Calm down. Your wounds are opening.

“...I’m becoming very angry.”

Braham didn’t know yet that he was the one who saved the subjugation force from being annihilated by Nevartan. He would rather not know for the rest of his life. There was no reward anyway.

“Are you disappointed in me?”

The underground area of Reidan Desert—Grid belatedly realized his mistake, ran to Marie Rose’s castle, and waved.

“No way? Why do you think that?”

“I didn’t do my best and many of Dear Husband’s subordinates died.”

Marie Rose’s expression was as aloof as usual. There was a bored smile on her face and she chattered as if talking about something insignificant.

However, Grid knew—The fact that an Absolute from birth was discussing the life or death of humans was an unusual thing in itself. She was trying not to show it, but Marie Rose was clearly worried on the inside. She was feeling regret and worrying that her choice was wrong.

Grid’s tone softened.

“Wasn’t it to protect our child? You did your best and you feel guilty that people are dead. That is enough for me. I’m honestly very pleased.”

“...I thought you were disappointed because you left without greeting me.”

“Haha, that isn’t possible. I just forgot for a moment...”

Grid’s words stopped midway. It was because Marie Rose’s expression was unusually cold. It was like a beam of light was pouring from her eyes and it was far more threatening than the angels’ beams.

“Yes... Dear Husband was busy with the recovery work, so you might’ve forgotten about me for a while. It is just a bit shocking that you even forgot about our child.”

Marie Rose had always been kind to Grid. No matter who she was dealing with or the situation, her tone was always dignified. However, now it was a bit cold. Her tone was strangely harsh and it sent chills down Grid’s spine. It felt as if thousands of invisible, blood-stained weapons were aimed at him.

“I have committed a sin that deserves death...”

Grid couldn’t say anything and simply apologized. The Emperor knew that an irreparable mistake was made, so an apology was the default.

Before he knew it, Marie Rose approached and hugged him around the neck. She buried his black hair and white cheeks like porcelain into his chest and whispered, “If you want to be forgiven, come back alive and well.”

It was an encouragement to shake off all of Grid’s fears and a pledge to suppress Marie Rose’s own impulses. She was barely holding back her desire to follow Grid. This moment was much more difficult and painful than when he found out the truth about her mother who tried to devour her. However, she had to endure it for the sake of her unborn child.

“I will keep that in mind.”

Grid’s expression finally became calm as he wrapped his hands, which were like a pot lid, around Marie Rose’s head.

……

…

Grid came back up from the desert.

“Let’s go.”

Nefelina was waiting for him. She had been half-dead a moment ago, but since she was a direct descendant of an Old Dragon, she seemed to have recovered quite well.

Grid said, “The difference between a supercar and a compact car is as thin as a sheet of paper.”

“What are you talking about?”

“It means the value of a car depends on who the driver is.”

He wondered if it was because he grew properly for the first time in ages—it felt like he was getting a new realization every moment. Nefelina was tilting her head in confusion. Grid wrapped his arms around her slender neck and looked behind her.

The blood that formed a river was covered with sand and yellow dust, disappearing without a trace. On it, the tower members, apostles, and members of the Overgeared Guild were drinking.

A few of them noticed Grid’s look and winked at him. They seemed to be telling him to act moderately because they would soon follow.

“The yellow sand has settled...’

Grid had a lighter heart as he moved with Nefelina in his arms.
