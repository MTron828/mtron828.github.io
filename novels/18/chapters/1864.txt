[Why did the S.A Group dream of a bad ending?] T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

[Chairman Lim Cheolho’s keynote that he wants Satisfy to be a hope for everyone was just a pretense.]

[Without Grid, all the people comforted by Satisfy would’ve tasted frustration instead of hope.]

[Does Chairman Lim Cheolho have an antisocial personality disorder?]

Third-rate media outlets that appealed to sensationalism in order to attract public opinion originally couldn’t easily touch the S.A Group. This was partly due to the enormous power of the S.A Group’s legal team, but more precisely, there were many targets to aim for even if they didn’t touch the S.A Group.

Right now, these media wanted to dig into Grid and the Overgeared Group.

Earth and Satisfy—literally, the world’s attention was focused on the performance of Grid and the Overgeared Guild, and there was no target more delicious than them. However, the media didn’t dare to touch them. So instead of the pheasants, they targeted the S.A Group who were chickens.

“I never thought the day would come when our group would act as breakwater.”

Ever since Satisfy launched its service, the influence of the S.A Group had been comparable to that of the United States and China. It wasn’t uncommon for another individual or group to act as a breakwater for the S.A Group, but this was the first time when the opposite was the case.

“Nothing lasts forever. However, it is quite a shock to have this experience due to an individual influence.”

Grid—additionally, the Empire and Overgeared Guild led by Grid. The hero born from Satisfy had become a strong competitor to the S.A Group.

“...Great.”

“It is because Grid is really great. Huhu.”

“I didn’t expect him to kill Baal and get rid of him. One big nuisance is gone, so it feels like a tooth has been knocked out.”

“Well, if it helps Grid, then it is a breakwater.”

This wasn’t a board of directors who could be swayed by the press. In the first place, the media is like a reed in front of the wind. It wasn’t worth responding to them one by one. Despite the provocations of the third-rate press, the atmosphere within the group was actually very good.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the S.A Group was also enjoying the festive atmosphere. In fact, some executives and employees had visited Reinhardt in person and enjoyed the festival.

Baal—the irregular who turned Satisfy’s worldview into a dystopia. The S.A Group hated him the most in the world. The company was caught up in the rules of not intervening in Satisfy and stood on the sidelines.

“There is nothing we can do but cheer for them in the future.”

Rebecca, the Goddess of Light, had the greatest authority within Satisfy. She had such a powerful artificial intelligence that she evolved independently of the group’s will. Depending on what she thought and the choices she made, an irregular like Baal would be born and it was impossible for the group to cope with. It was similar to the feeling of the universe or a transcendent being like a god creating humans and then only being able to watch them.

Therefore, they relied on players like Grid and supported them for many years.

Rebecca and other Absolutes joined hands one after another, leading Satisfy to ruin. This was the worst development for the S.A Group. If Grid had failed in this expedition, the S.A Group’s stock price would’ve plummeted right now. They would’ve seriously discussed the introduction of a seasonal system.

“……”

The executives smiled happily as they once again checked the soaring stock price. Among them, only Director Yoon Sangmin’s expression was particularly dark.

The Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time—it could make any wish come true so it was a stone that stimulated the target’s desire. There was already a history of it creating a monster called Baal once. However, it fell into the hands of a player.

Of course, Director Yoon Sangmin had been watching Grid for a long time and knew him well. He thought the chances of Grid using the core of the beginning to harm Satisfy was close to zero. Even so, there was harm that was done without any malice. Grid had no intention of doing so, but any choice he made could have serious side effects.

‘I hope he thinks about it...’

Director Yoon Sangmin was biting his nails in anxiety, only to soon smile bitterly. He always felt grateful to Grid, but he felt it was a pity that he couldn’t help being suspicious and vigilant every time.

Well, what could he do? This was the relationship between the operator and the user.

“By the way...” Director Yoon Sangmin cocked his head.

Chairman Lim Cheolho, who claimed to be God Grid’s number one fan—he should’ve blessed Grid’s wedding alongside the other executives, but he never showed up at the scene.

“Is the chairman heartbroken?” Director Yoon Sangmin carefully asked the chief of staff. It was a situation where the third-rate media criticized him as a hypocritical person. It was a sad moment for Chairman Lim Cheolho, who cherished and loved Satisfy more than anyone else. Director Yoon Sangmin felt heavy as he recalled the lonely appearance of the chairman sitting alone in the office and drinking a glass of soju.

“No,” the chief of staff replied firmly.

“I’m glad to hear that... then where is he?”

“He went out. Considering that he gave orders to draw up a list of gifts preferred by men in their 30s, I guess he went to see Grid.”

Director Yoon Sangmin was the chairman’s closest confidant.

Yoon Sangmin was relieved thanks to the chief of staff, who spoke frankly.

‘The chairman is the most excited one.’

Indeed, he couldn’t be swayed by the media.

“......?!”

Director Yoon Sangmin was smiling happily only to abruptly jump out of his seat. The other executives were also disturbed.

It was after Grid’s wedding. It was due to the system message that popped up on the screen that was illuminating the night view of Reinhardt and the Tomb of the Gods.

[Player ‘Grid’ has used REX-001001.]

REX-001001—as the operations director, Yoon Sangmin knew what this code name meant: The Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time.

“Did Grid use the wish stone?”

The other executives noticed the situation one step late and bombarded Director Yoon Sangmin with questions. It was a big reaction. None of the people gathered here had expected that Grid would use the Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time, the ‘wish stone,’ so quickly.

Director Yoon Sangmin muttered, “He is short-sighted... will there be a situation where the dead are resurrected as Morpheus feared...?”

It had a relatively high probability of 23.9%. Morpheus had predicted the possibility that Grid would ‘resurrect the dead’ using the wish stone. Khan and the former Red Knights were cited as examples.

Khan, who lost his young son early on.

The former Red Knights who were falsely accused and lost their comrades and family members.

It warned that if Grid immediately resurrected the dead to heal their wounds, all types of chaos would appear in the world.

‘It is harm without malice.’

Director Yoon Sangmin felt the need to quickly assess the situation. He moved immediately to the operations team. This was when the system message took over.

[Player Grid’s wish has no effect on Satisfy.]

“......??”

“......???”

The wish of a person like Grid had no effect on the world? It was hard to believe.

“What is the content of his wish?”

The system replied to Director Yoon Sangmin and the executives, who looked somewhat confused.

[I can’t tell you in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 9 of the Terms and Conditions.]

“……”

Article 3, Paragraph 9 of the Terms and Conditions—the company respected the privacy of the players. The privacy here meant ‘something that can’t be monitored even with the authority of the operations team.’ In other words, it was a very intimate part of human dignity.

At this point, Director Yoon Sangmin and the executives all noticed it. It was easier to guess because Grid had just married Marie Rose.

“I acknowledge this...” someone muttered.

***

Really. Grid didn’t come out of the bedroom until the sun rose to the middle of the sky.

Lauel had served Grid for a long time, but this was the first time he had seen it. In the past, rain or shine, Grid used to get up before anyone else and leave for the smithy or hunting grounds.

“What...?” Lauel cocked his head. For the first time in a long time, no, for the first time, Grid rested soundly without any worries.

It was Lauel who had been waiting for Grid, who didn’t come out of the bedroom until late. He had been expecting a refreshed look from Grid. Yet ironically, Grid was even more exhausted than usual. Was he tormented by Marie Rose all night?

It was impossible. Grid—

No, every player was sexually constrained in Satisfy. It was natural. Players were only allowed to do it once a month. It was a huge restriction. This was even if they were spending their first night with the person they loved most in the world. It was physically impossible for a player to make love all night. If the timing was wrong, there were many cases where they couldn’t make love even once.

Of course, Lauel was a bachelor, so he only knew this theoretically, but...

In any case, there was no problem with his theory based on knowledge and information.

“Don’t tell me... was your blood sucked all night?”

“It is similar...?”

“Marie Rose is a vampire, so she is different from humans. Don’t be too considerate just because you are newly married. You should stay away from her at night.”

“...In any case, she left.”

Just a little while ago, right before Grid left through the bedroom door, Marie Rose left the castle through the window. It was as if running away.

“It is harsher than I was prepared for...” She left with such words.

Grid reflected on it. From last night to noon today, Marie Rose had passed out 27 times.

‘I was too excited.’

He was fascinated by Marie Rose’s beauty and his eyes went dark when the limit was lifted... Yesterday, he was just a beast...

Grid sighed while reflecting on himself again. Then he strongly made up his mind.

‘From now on, let’s manage myself well.’

It was a situation where the system couldn’t impose restrictions due to the influence of the Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time. Grid himself had to be careful. He really had to keep his mind tense.

“By the way, I heard there is a tower?”

“Yes, I presume it is a tower that can reach the sky. As you know, among the dungeons created by Eat Spicy Jokbal, haven’t the dungeons rated unique or higher naturally expanded in size according to the exploration rate?”

“So the more you climb the tower, the higher it will go? Maybe it is enough to reach Asgard?”

“That’s right. Of course, to do that, we need someone who can climb the tower.”

Grid nodded.

“Let’s go.”

After a while—

“This XX.”

Grid’s swear words rang out through the tower.
