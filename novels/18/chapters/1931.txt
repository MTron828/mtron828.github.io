Chapter 1931

Just as it was proven by the disappearance of the dimensional effect of the Overgeared World, Trauka’s lair was classified as a separate dimension. The inside and the outside were completely independent. It meant that the beginning and end were separated.

The green dragon’s death didn’t directly affect Grid, so Grid wasn’t aware of what was happening outside the lair.

On the other hand, the dragon group noticed it. Shortly after Revola left, they confirmed that the green dragon’s life had ended and felt that Revola’s energy had rapidly strengthened. This didn’t mean that dragons were superior to Grid. It was simply that the lair dimension had a structure that favored dragons.

In any case... Haranbeka wasn’t worried about Revola. He might’ve lost to Grid, but this wasn’t a reason to belittle Revola’s skills.

Haranbeka acknowledged Grid’s abilities and was starting to feel a lot of interest. It was a situation where the group, which originally numbered 24, couldn’t afford to handle Grid for all types of reasons and left one after another. The strength that should’ve ensured victory was weakening like it was all a lie.

The first one or two times could be dismissed as a coincidence, but at this point, it was right to say that it was a situation that Grid intended.

“...I have a personal question.” Haranbeka, who had been quietly observing the situation, staring straight at Grid. “Are you confident that you will be able to deal with the aftermath after twisting the ‘structure in which this world is built’?”

Haranbeka’s question was straightforward.

“I have been studying the concept of games since the end of the Age of Oblivion. I observed the physiology of you players, explored their conversations that drifted on the wind and understood what they are generally after.”

“The purpose of a game is to constantly become stronger by targeting mighty enemies.”

“Rebecca should’ve been the common enemy of you and the players, but you made her your ally.”

“If you succeed in neutralizing us in this situation.”

“Can you players have fun in this world after that?”

Most games had a clear sense of purpose. For the most part, that goal stemmed from the worldview. In the flow of the story, there was a final boss that must be defeated. This gave the players a basis to immerse themselves in the game. Surprisingly, Haranbeka understood this.

Grid was inwardly impressed and thought for a moment. Then he replied, “My parents created a mountain hiking club.”

“...Hiking what?”

“The two people couldn’t enjoy a proper hobby because they were taking care of their naughty children. Then after belatedly discovering this world, they resumed the hobby that they had given up.

Was it the ‘Former Euljiro Mountain Hiking Club’?It was a club created with the merchants whom his parents had become friends with after running a fruit store. They were busy working every day in reality. Additionally, due to their age, they had problems with physical fitness and gradually gave up on mountain hiking.

For some, it was a hobby that was normal and easy to come across, but Grid’s parents only rediscovered it after experiencing Satisfy. They said that their goal was to conquer all of Satisfy’s famous mountains.

Grid clearly remembered his parents’ eyes shining as they revealed their aspirations.

“Not all people have the same goals. There are more people who want a normal life without fighting. Games where the goal is to fight against a strong enemy are common anyway. There is no reason to pursue it here.”

“...But you can’t deny the fact that there are many players who will push back against it, right?”

“You don’t have to worry about that.”

Suddenly, a dark smile spread across Grid’s face. It was an arrogant and ominous smile that went beyond confidence.

For a moment Haranbeka mistook the being in front of him for Baal. In fact, he had a ridiculous doubt that it wasn’t Grid who defeated Baal, but rather that Baal had swallowed up Grid. It was because depending on how one interpreted it, the smile on Grid’s face was sinister enough.

“I will become the new goal of those who must have a goal.”

“Hah...”

Haranbeka was speechless for a moment.

I will be the goal of the players.

It was nothing less than a declaration to replace the heavenly gods, the Old Dragons, and Chiyou. It couldn’t just be described as arrogant. Then why? Haranbeka didn’t think that Grid was arrogant. On the contrary, he felt relief.

“Only One God Grid. I finally understand you. From now on, I won’t question you. Therefore, I won’t be deceived. I will acknowledge you as a threat that must be prevented.”

The group of dragons, now led by Haranbeka, surrounded Grid.

[I, the Faithful Dragon Haranbeka, will prevent a ‘disaster’ with my like-minded companions.]

'...I thought they don’t use Dragon Words when it is advantageous?’

Grid looked at Nefelina with resentment, but even Nefelina couldn’t fathom Haranbeka’s resolve. The nature of those who were an Absolute had peculiar aspects. It easily went beyond the realm of understanding.

From now on, it became difficult for Grid to even utter a word. It was because a tremendous onslaught poured in nonstop.

***

-All nobles must know honor and exercise restraint.

-Be loyal to the kingdom and serve the king, but know how to be grateful to the people.

-Try to be an example for all. A noble becomes a pillar that supports the kingdom only when he or she earns the respect of the king and the trust of the people.

The words that his father engraved into him—as he went further up the river of reincarnation, all types of memories became blurred, but the words in his heart came to mind clearly. Therefore, Hayate didn’t show signs of tiredness. He suppressed all his confusion and walked straight forward.

The memory of cutting the scales and heart of Fire Dragon Trauka had long disappeared. He also forgot his tower colleagues, who had been with him for nearly a thousand years.

The memories of killing a wounded dragon.

The scenery of the city that was swept away from the fall of that bastard.

Even the last glimpse of his loved ones who had lived together in a peaceful city... 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hayate couldn’t remember anything. He even forgot the mission of a Dragon Slayer.

The hell released from its distortion—it was the oblivion caused by a ‘world created so that the dead can live happily.’ Hayate would completely forget all the pain and sorrow he had experienced in his life. The moment he threw himself into the river of reincarnation because he missed the happiness and joy he rarely felt, he might regain his memories, but it would only be for a moment.

At the end of the river, he would forget himself and be reincarnated as a completely new person. He knew it instinctively. Therefore, he couldn’t throw himself in the river. He was obsessed with the duty of a noble that only he remembered.

“...The more I look at you, the more amazing it is. I’m sure you have lost most of your memories, but it is amazing that you are still maintaining your ego.”

Hayate walked silently along the riverbank.

A boy approached him as he was unable to assimilate into hell.[1]

His white skin, like porcelain, shone even brighter thanks to the halo above his head. The wings on his back were sacred and warm.

An angel—Hayate realized that the boy who followed him was from heaven.

“I think I am fascinated by your noble spirit.”

The boy didn’t hide his identity.

“Come with me to Asgard. I, the ‘chief’ of the angels, will personally guide you onto the path of the angels.”

Was he certain that he wouldn’t be rejected?

Raphael held out his hand so confidently.

“......”

Hayate ignored him and walked past him. Raphael was unperturbed. He kept smiling like he had experienced this many times. “Is your ego wary of a new life? It’s fine. It is a very natural phenomenon. How easy is it to completely abandon yourself and start anew? However, be courageous. You deserve to be a holy being.”

“......”

“Eh, are you going to keep ignoring me?” Raphael was a bit flustered. No matter how much he talked, Hayate didn’t give him a single glance. This made Raphael both curious and suspicious.

That’s right. He was aware of Hayate’s identity. After watching all day, he vaguely felt the quality of Hayate’s soul. Based on various circumstances, he came to deduce the soul’s identity.

“I can’t wait to see Grid after he is reunited with you as his enemy (angel)!”

The number one Archangel, Raphael—he had reigned as a heavenly power for many years since his birth. Thanks to Rebecca’s laissez-faire attitude and Judar, who was always contemplating something, he established himself behind the scenes and manipulated many gods.

He was now demoted to hell, but his self-esteem was still high.

“In fact, there is no need for a conversation. Isn’t that right? Go up to heaven with me.”

Raphael pulled out his spear. He planned to kill Hayate’s soul and take him up to heaven.

The Black and White sisters, who were watching the situation from a short distance away, hurriedly approached him.

“Archangel, didn’t you say that you can’t return to heaven until you have completed your mission?”

“I can do that later. I will be praised if I take him back right away.”

There was no time to stop him. Before the Black and White sisters could arrive at Raphael, his spear had already stretched out like a flash of lightning. It was an attack that stabbed Hayate in the neck...

However, it was blocked. It was by Hayate’s sword, who still didn’t have any focus. It was also very smoothly. It wasn’t the Dragon Killing Sword.

Hayate was holding a ceremonial long sword that seemed flashy in appearance. It was because the ego left to now was that of a nobleman, not a Dragon Slayer. However, it was solid. The sword didn’t shake in the slightest as it collided with the archangel’s spear.

“What...?” Raphael couldn’t hide his surprised expression as he hurriedly retrieved his spear and raised it. Hayate’s blade fell toward him.

“Kuock...!” Raphael’s knees bent slightly. It was the price of not being able to fully endure the power of the sword that fell toward him.

‘The Dragon Slayer was this strong? Additionally, isn’t he now in a soul state?’

As the name suggested, the Dragon Slayer was an existence who hunted dragons. Additionally, Hayate was a human being. He might be very strong against dragons, but he didn’t have much of an advantage in fighting other Absolutes. If it was actually a few days ago, Hayate would’ve never overwhelmed Raphael.

However, Hayate’s status had risen greatly as the 1st place contributor in defeating Fire Dragon Trauka. This meant even his soul was strengthened.

In hell, Hayate was like a blind man. His blue eyes, which were still out of focus, didn’t contain Raphael’s image.

Nevertheless, Hayate’s swordsmanship dealt serious damage to Raphael and it brought an incomprehensible humiliation to Raphael.

1. Since Raphael is specifically described to have the form of a boy here, I will use male pronouns for him from now on, unless he is shown to change genders like Sariel
