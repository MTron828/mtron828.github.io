Chapter 1788

“If the declaration to hurt you is a sign of treason—”

Zeratul’s greatest strength lay in his mastery of all martial arts. He could perform supreme feats regardless of the presence or absence of weapons. Even the chains of magic power binding his hands weren’t a constraint. They would turn into a deadly weapon the moment he wielded it.

“You have insulted me many times in the past, so how many times have you committed treason?”

Grid suddenly remembered something as he watched the situation with bated breath.

One time in the past, when Raphael discussed Zeratul, they laughed at him for being a fake, a clone, etc.

‘As expected, people have to live a good life.’

Don’t do anything to earn people’s resentment.

It was just like Raphael at the moment. It was easy to get caught at a critical moment.

“I don’t want to admit it, but the Goddess of Light had a hand in my birth. According to your logic, not respecting me is the same as not respecting the Goddess, right?”

“Eh? You usually pretend to be the Martial God born purely from the worship of the people. You only admit the truth when you are at a disadvantage?”

“Don’t change the subject, you feathered mongrel.”

“......”

Raphael had remained mischievous without losing their composure even after going through all types of humiliation on the surface when their power was sealed. However, now their expression stiffened. No, they looked solemn. They had shown it occasionally when on the surface, but now even the light in their eyes was cold. They looked genuinely angry.

“I have also hated you for a long time. The existence created to replace Chiyou treated me like a pigeon.”

“I remember saying it was chicken.”

“...This is good. I have to get rid of you, who has gone completely crazy. There is no need to keep you alone, who is incompetent contrary to expectations and unsuitable to be Chiyou’s replacement, right? You are filth with no value.”

Rattle, rattle.

Zeratul looked like a clear sinner as his wrists were restrained by a chain of magic power.

His beard that hadn’t been maintained at all, a dwarfed physique, and worn-out attire made him look unsightly. However, it was difficult to see him as degrading to something other than the Martial God. The momentum he was exuding was incredible. It was incomparable to when he was on the surface.

The power of the angel army, led by Raphael, was also immense. The moment magic power was injected, their perfectly refined prayers wrapped around their bodies in brilliant armor. It felt like hundreds of beings were one.

Every moment, their choices and actions cooperated with each other. Even the buff magic that strengthened their abilities were completed by changing one letter each and overlapping it with each other. Dozens of types of magic were literally completed in a flash.

‘None of them are ordinary. Each one of them is at the level of the 10 Meritorious Retainers?’

Asgard was a divine world that had existed since the beginning. Considering the fact that the newly born Overgeared World removed the skill cooldown time and skill resources consumption of its gods. In addition, a target that Grid allowed to enter the Overgeared World would receive a 30% boost to all stats. If he didn’t allow it, then all stats were halved and their status would decrease.

The effect of Asgard would exceed anything Grid imagined, unless he had the power to ‘neutralize the dimensional effect’ like an Old Dragon. It was suicide for an intruder to fight here.

‘No... it might be the level of the Apostles, not the 10 Meritorious Retainers.’

An army with each member resembled Mercedes or Braham?

It happened the moment when Grid was intimidated by the angels’ prayers and gulped...

“Take advantage of this opportunity to run away.”

Hexetia shattered Grid’s thoughts. His voice was firm. He seemed to be criticizing Grid for not focusing on the situation and thinking nonsense.

“It is hopeful that Raphael didn’t bring the entire army with them. I will help Zeratul and draw away attention. You should find a chance and take Khan away.”

“Hexetia...”

Khan’s eyes shook.

Hexetia might be in prison now, but he was one of the higher ranked gods. Nevertheless, he remembered the name of an angel. Furthermore, it was the name of an angel who betrayed Asgard. It was touching.

Grid shook his head as he looked at Hexetia, who was turning a blind eye to Khan’s affectionate gaze. “I don’t want to.”

“What?” Hexetia’s expression distorted. “Are you going to run amok in Asgard? What is the difference between you and Zeratul who went to the surface?”

“Trying to fulfill my responsibilities is different from running amok.”

“Responsibilities?”

“I am going to save you.”

“......!”

“The reason I took the risk to ascend to heaven is to save you and Khan.”

Even before obtaining Trauka’s arm, Grid’s goal was to rescue Hexetia. It was a goal he had been harboring even before he knew that Khan had become an angel. Hexetia shook his head slowly as he saw only the truth that was contained in Grid’s dark eyes, which were as sharp as a bird of prey.

“It is ridiculous... as long as you are fighting for humanity, I don’t deserve your favor.”

Hexetia had a history of betraying humanity. His petty and disgusting jealousy led the demons to the surface and pushed Pagma, who was like Grid’s teacher, into Baal’s hands. It was like committing the sin of denying Grid, who fought for humanity. It was a position where he didn’t dare to win Grid’s favor.

Grid asked Hexetia, who was deep in thought, “Are you still bound by your past sins, even though you deeply regret it and have reflected on it?”

“It isn’t a crime that can be washed away with cheap reflection.”

“If you really think so, we can communicate better. Please leave here with me.”

“What nonsense is that...?”

“Let’s go down to the surface. Reflect by standing by the people’s side and serving them.”

“......”

As Grid was persuading Hexetia, Zeratul was clashing with the army of angels. The battle gear of the angels, covered with all types of destructive magic, were reduced to worthless shards and shattered. It was thanks to the chains wielded by Zeratul. Zeratul’s advance was unstoppable as he repeatedly bound and crushed the approaching swords and spears. He proceeded as quickly as a guest of wind and collapsed the camp of the angels.

“Single-handedly taking on a Braham-level power?”

[Braham? Who here has the same power as him?]

Zeratul retorted to Grid, who was surprised and admiring it. It was an unbelievable reaction from someone rampaging in the middle of enemy lines.

Grid replied to him in an attempt to resolve his doubts with thoughts rather than words. “I mean... those angels.”

[Are you rating the chickens who are enemies as a red phoenix to increase your value...? You are like a rare scammer.]

Zeratul’s thoughts contained absurdity, anger, and ridicule as he thought of the distorted epics. It was an attitude that angered the angels who were hesitating to fight against a higher ranked god.

“Isn’t mocking the Goddess’ army clearly an act that crosses the line?”

There was only one Archangel here, Raphael. For some reason, the 2nd ranked Archangel and below weren’t here. It was a dispersion of power that made it possible to have the ridiculous speculation of ‘is it possible that intruders appeared elsewhere?’ Zeratul was good at ‘fighting’ since he was the Martial God, so he understood that the current situation was a huge advantage.

He laughed contentedly at the sight of the angels, who normally wouldn’t be able to breathe in front of an Archangel. “Even chickens know how to chirp.”

“......!”

A terrible killing intent appeared in the eyes of the angels, visible through the gaps in their helmets. The provocation worked properly. The angels didn’t bother with a conversation. They didn’t hesitate any longer as they actively linked up and unleashed killing attacks on Zeratul.

They recalled again that their duty was to protect Asgard, not the gods. It was an unworthy duty that they recalled in the wake of petty anger.

Grid felt a sudden surge of anger.

‘Why couldn’t they have fought so hard when the surface was in danger?’

The humans in Satisfy were so pitiful. They worshiped the celestial gods and provided them with daily food, but received no rewards. Hell was the place where most people fell after dying. They suffered eternally regardless of the merits they accumulated during their lives. Only a few selected humans ascended to heaven, but they lost their memories and were consumed as soldiers of the gods.

Why?

Why should they be treated like that?

Khan, Irene, Piaro, Lord, Mercedes, Basara, Asmophel, Jude, Isabel, Han Seokbong and Sua, etcetera—Grid’s divinity gradually deepened as he recalled his cherished relationships.

The shape of the Yellow Dragon had faded after being mixed with the light that dominated Asgard. Now it dispelled the darkness of the prison and started to reveal its full form. Its momentum was so majestic that the gazes of Raphael and the angels reflexively shifted from Zeratul to it.

“Dragon...?”

Even if it was just the form, wasn’t it a dragon combined with divinity?

“Are you saying it is the second coming of the dragon god?”

Raphael frowned like they were displeased and used their authority for the first time. A powerful dimensional force that couldn’t be matched by the Overgeared World crushed Grid.

[The 1st ranked Archangel, Raphael, protects the security of Asgard and has defined you as an intruder.]

[Asgard won’t tolerate your traces.]

[All of your stats are reduced by 70% and your status is greatly damaged. You have lost most of the beneficial effects of a transcendent.]

[Shunpo can’t be used.]

Raphael only used their authority, not their power. This was just a basic debuff. It was the penalty for breaking into Asgard without permission.

“Unfortunately, this place isn’t that trivial,” Hexetia spoke bitterly.

It was because he knew it would be difficult for Grid to even take care of himself. He wouldn’t be able to get out of here...

Two flames rose from both of Hexetia’s nipples.

At first glance, the blue flame resembled the hellfire river and it split the encirclement of angels in half. Meanwhile, the red flame mimicked the Fire Dragon’s Breath and forced Raphael to use their halo for defense.

“Run away in this gap.”

The power of a god who gave up on his way to live—Hexetia performed bravely like the God of War, not the God of Blacksmiths. He was filled with the determination to open a way for Grid to escape, so he poured out all his divinity regardless of future troubles.

His hand trembled as his energy was rapidly exhausted and Grid grabbed it. Hexetia was surprised and reflexively tried to resist, but it was useless. Grid’s grip was so strong that he couldn’t resist. It was a strength that was completely unbelievable even when it was suppressed in Asgard.

“You... what are you doing?”

Hexetia’s question didn’t last long.

“You fools! Avoid it!”

It was due to Zeratul’s urgent cry. Raphael had pierced through the fire in an instant and was stabbing their spear. It was a spear that shot in a straight line to pierce Grid’s back and Hexetia’s heart at the same time. It was literally like a ray of light.

The speed of the attack was reminiscent of an Old Dragon and was one of the highest speeds among the attacks of the Absolutes that Grid had experienced many times. It was a level where it was hard to react immediately without the effect of Dragon Knight. If it was a surprise attack then he would have to give up some of his flesh.

In fact, there was no special emotion on Raphael’s face. They didn’t seem to doubt that their attack would achieve the results they intended.

Hexetia was unable to hide his frustrated expression. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Aren’t you too calm?” Grid asked Khan.

Khan smiled softly. “I am with you.”

By the time Khan’s answer ended—

“......?!”

Raphael’s spear was sliding away with a roar. It was the aftermath of Grid wielding Twilight and twisting the trajectory of the spear.

“How?” Raphael narrowly avoided the orange divinity that approached their neck in an instant and asked while not caring about their reputation. It was close to astonishment.

[You have resisted.]

[The ‘Golden Protection’ from Gourmet Dragon ‘Raiders’ is temporarily neutralizing the dimensional effect that oppresses you. 9 minutes and 56 seconds left.]

[The energy of the Old Dragon in ‘Golden Protection‘ has activated the Dragon Knight effect.]

“Have you forgotten who I am?”

Grid was more flustered than anyone else. Of course, he didn’t show it. He just asked calmly and reminded the angels that he was an Only One God. It was the appearance of facing the 1st ranked Archangel in Asgard, where it was absolutely disadvantageous for him. It was enough to astonish not only the angels, but also Hexetia.

Zeratul’s sneer rang out in the silence. “I got beaten by him for a reason.”

Raphael had to pay the price for ignoring Zeratul, who was the Martial God. Raphael was counterattacked after failing to ambush Grid. Then Zeratul’s fist precisely aimed at the top of their head and caused blood to spill. Thanks to this, a path of retreat was perfectly opened. Grid didn’t miss this opportunity and joined hands with Hexetia and Khan to escape the prison.

“Stop them! Stop them!!” Raphael shouted urgently, but it didn’t work.

It was because Zeratul blocked the entrance as Raphael was regaining their composure. It was too high a wall to overcome with the power of angels alone.

“You bastard, you would’ve been beaten the same as me.”

The corners of Zeratul’s mouth twitched. He felt tremendous exhilaration.
