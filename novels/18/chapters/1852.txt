Chapter 1852

The mass of red flesh—there was no other name for it. Their honest feeling was that they didn’t even want to mention it. 

“Is it over? Really?” 

The world message that emerged the moment Baal perished—Toban had been cheering at the thought that it was over, only to break out in a sweat. Not only was the red flesh unharmed by Baal’s disappearance, but the news of the birth of a new Evil God came right after. It was a desperate situation. 

‘How long do I have to face this disgusting bastard?’ 

The red flesh formed a circular shape, but the surface was uneven. It was because it was wearing countless faces like an outer shell. The mouth, noses, and eyes of the dead were tightly embedded in the flesh and wriggled in real time. They seemed to be screaming together. 

Please come and save me. 

They seemed to be shouting to get them out of here. 

Wriggle! 

One of the human faces embedded in the red flesh seemed to protrude slightly. Finally, a human figure was vomited out. Once again, it was the yangban, Garam. He was killed by Mir a short time ago, but he was resurrected again, his body made from the flesh of the red flesh. 

“It is very convenient that I don’t have to fear death.”

Garam smirked and rushed at Mir. Like his own body, he wielded a long sword made of flesh. 

The sword flashed continuously like lightning. Dozens of blows were exchanged and Mir was pushed back a few steps. It was a shocking sight. 

At first, Mir had easily overwhelmed Garam. He was hurt by the energy of the God Killer, but he easily handled Garam and the yangbans. However, Garam became stronger every time he was resurrected and he already reached the level of receiving Mir’s swordsmanship. 

Garam was the only one. The other yangbans were killed by Mir’s sword no matter how many times they resurrected, while Garam became stronger in real time. 

It was the pure difference in talent. Even after suffering the same death, Garam was the only one who immediately realized his defeat and quickly came up with a solution. He repeatedly studied and gained insight into how Mir’s swordsmanship incapacitated him and led him to death. 

Before long, the red flesh didn’t resurrect the other yangbans. It only molded Garam using its own flesh. In the process, Garam’s arms and legs became a bit longer. His neck and ankles thickened, and calluses formed on his toes and fingers. The muscles of his entire body were reorganized in a different form than before. 

It was the result of the red flesh responding whenever Garam realized and aspired for the physical conditions necessary to transcend Mir. Garam started to catch up with Mir’s swordsmanship using sheer talent and he was even blessed with an evolved body by the red flesh. 

“The sword that destroys the gods.” 

The energy of a God Killer—the incandescent long sword accepted the aura created from Garam’s intentions and caused a powerful explosion. It had the power to offset some of the absolute elements of Mir’s dragon weapon, One. Garam’s sword, which easily broke every time it collided with One, was intact for the first time. It endured dozens of blows and scattered pale energy. 

Garam didn’t seem satisfied. 

“It is still too much to say it will destroy a god. I’ll have to name it differently.” 

The blue dopo fluttered and spread out like a curtain. It was a scene created by the shockwave that occurred when One pierced Garam’s chest. 

“Cough... I should’ve dealt one more blow.” 

A slight twist of the wrist. 

Flop! 

Garam’s body collapsed as he looked down with some surprise at One, which made it through his sword like his sword was a piece of paper. The beautiful body shriveled up in an instant and turned into dirty, red flesh. 

A piece of flesh that was the size of a fist—it was the material that formed the body of a half-god. 

The possibilities of the red flesh were limitless. 

“At this time, I wonder if Baal is greater than Hanul.” 

Step. 

Garam walked out again. Once again, it was a body made from a small piece of flesh. It was newly made, so it was fine without any wounds. 

“Unlike Hanul, who is limited to creating dozens of yangbans who are trash except for you and me, Baal’s creation can create and evolve an infinite number of objects using the material called the ‘soul.’ Isn’t that right?” 

Chiyou’s test—Yangbans must study and develop on their own in order to qualify for the test and pass it. They had to try hard like they were human beings. It was too insignificant for a creature created by one of the Gods of the Beginning. 

Therefore, Garam wasn’t satisfied with his life. He was jealous of the Absolutes who were perfect from the moment they were born and felt skeptical about his own situation. Of course, that changed after he met Grid. 

In any case, the world felt easy and comfortable now. It was because his innate talent was in full bloom thanks to the red flesh. 

“It feels so good... Mir, why don’t you get eaten by this too?” 

“......”

Mir didn’t reply. 

Garam—among the yangbans, he was one who neglected his studies and training. 

Mir always regretted the waste of his talent, but that was a story from a long time ago. After discovering that Garam’s personality was very twisted, he was glad that Garam was lazy. To be honest, he would confess it now: he had been relieved when he heard that Garam died. 

However, Garam came back alive in front of his eyes. It was while retaining his tremendous talent and terrifying sadism. 

‘As long as we can’t destroy that red flesh—’ 

Wouldn’t monsters like Garam revive again and again and become the second or third Baal? He wondered if the source of fear that Grid had cut off would be resurrected someday. 

Mir thought up to here and closed his eyes to control his breathing. He engraved a determination in his mind. That determination— 

“Your prayer has changed. What are you going to teach me this time?” 

“Don’t look forward to it.” 

The method to suppress Garam’s talent was simple. Repeatedly killing him without giving him the chance to learn. For example.

“......?” 

Killing him without him realizing it. 

Flop! 

It was only after Mir shook the blood from his sword that Garam collapsed and died like a broken doll. 

Mir, the strongest yangban—until he met Grid, he had only one dream: to fulfill the aspirations of Martial God Chiyou and become the new Martial God. He worked hard in rain and snow to achieve that dream. It was while being grateful for his natural talent. 

That’s right—Mir was superior to Garam in every way. Therefore, Hanul identified Mir as the opponent of Baal and Raphael. Garam borrowed the power of a demon and repeatedly evolved through expedient means, but he couldn’t surpass Mir’s hundreds of years of effort. 

Grid also knew Mir’s value. Therefore, he made Mir his apostle without hesitation and gave him the most important role in this expedition. 

The mass of red flesh—a monster who used the power of the souls absorbed through Baal, resurrecting them as demons and wielding them as its own limbs. It was very versatile. It was possible to easily counter specific targets. 

For example, Mercedes. She could analyze the powers of the dead to counter and neutralize them, but it consumed a lot of mental power. As she countered the powers of the dead unleashed by the red flesh, she would become increasingly vulnerable over time as she received pincer attacks from the dead who were resurrected as demons. 

No matter how strong Braham was, he was a magician and was vulnerable to close combat. Meanwhile, Zik had a weakness that his combat power rapidly declined the moment he couldn’t use runes. In other words, they could be attacked somehow if the red flesh made full use of the power of the dead. 

Based on Grid and Lauel’s discussion, the apostle with the highest win rate against the red flesh was undoubtedly Mir. A being who mastered martial arts in the process of dreaming about becoming the Martial God and who freely handled the power of the Four Auspicious Beasts—Mir had an appropriate level of tolerance for all forms of attack. 

He might not be as good as Mercedes, but he had the insight to grasp the weaknesses of the target. He could momentarily display a similar firepower to Braham and could be as versatile as Zik. Of course, expectations were somewhat low compared to Braham’s potential to ‘kill’ the red flesh, but Mir had the highest chance of buying a ‘stable’ amount of time for Yura to find a way to attack the red flesh. 

The red flesh must be a living being. It was clearly wary of the fact that Garam had died without being able to react and drew out more of the power of the dead. It intensively passed on the pain, sadness, and despair of the souls it carried to Mir. It was in the form of magic, skills, physical powers, curses, and plagues.

Mir endured with the power of the White Tiger, the Black Tortoise, and the Red Phoenix. 

He manipulated the ground with the power of the White Tiger to ward off physical attacks, he offset the curses and plagues with the Black Tortoise’s poison and curses, and he quickly healed the wounds inflicted by magic that he was forced to allow with the power of the Red Phoenix. 

“Weren’t the Four Gods liberated by Grid?” 

Garam witnessed the vision of the Four Auspicious Beasts rising behind Mir and frowned. In the past, when Garam was alive, the reason why they could use the power of the Four Auspicious Beasts was because the Four Auspicious Beasts were sealed and weakened. It was a power that could be taken away at any time the moment the Four Auspicious Beasts regained their free will. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, Mir was using it and it was also all the powers of the Four Auspicious Beasts.

“...Did you become acquainted with the Four Auspicious Beasts thanks to Grid and retained your strength? Kukuk, don’t you have any pride? It is disgusting to see you cling to Grid, who is just a mere human being, just to be able to gain a bit more.” 

Garam took a completely different posture than before. At the same time, the way he used Formless Will changed. He wrapped it around his body rather than using it to strike at and disturb Mir. It was different from self-defense. Rather than spreading it out widely, it was condensed and overlapped on a specific area. It was under his feet. 

At the same time, the condensed formless energy exploded and he gained tremendous acceleration. He was conscious of the current that still remained weakly in Mir’s sword. Garam noticed that he had just been killed by Mir, who used the ‘power of the Blue Dragon.’ He did everything in his power to move faster than that. 

It was useless. It was because what Garam could do, Mir could also do. Mir raised the energy of the Blue Dragon and exploded the intangible energy condensed below his elbow, while fending off the offensive of the red flesh. He bent his wrist to match it and the sword soared at a tremendous speed. 

“This bastard...” 

Did he see and follow along? 

Garam realized what Mir had done and started swearing. His position was once again next to the red flesh. 

“......?” 

Garam’s expression was puzzled for a moment before he slowly stiffened. He realized that he had died without his knowledge. 

“Huh? Is there a XXing case like this?” 

A guy who grew one step faster than him growing stronger. It was the second time. 

Garam smiled as the image of Grid overlapped with Mir. It was an expression he made when his anger was soaring to the top of his head. 

“I have to kill you first before even being qualified to challenge Grid.” 

His tone subsided. It seemed like he was trying to concentrate. Garam was thinking about how to attack Mir, who showed no gaps, only to completely shut his mouth and collapse. It was the aftermath of the bones and flesh of his lower body being crushed. 

“What?” 

Garam, who didn’t care how many times he died, was quite shaken. It was because the human faces covering the surface of the huge red flesh started to squirm wildly. Then the flesh started to swell up. 

A spot on the flesh exploded. It was by Yura’s bullets. It was a bullet that accumulated the power of the dead, whose red flesh had erupted throughout the battle. The shooting method was also different from usual. 

Faker shoved the bullet directly into the flesh’s body. After being shot several times by Yura, he identified a gap in the flesh with an immune system that was wary of Yura and targeted it accurately. 

“You guys...” 

Garam noticed the situation. The method to attack the lump of red flesh that easily regenerated no matter how many times it was cut and smashed—it was to inject ‘excessive energy’ at once to exceed the allowed amount and cause self-destruction. 

In fact, the red flesh was collapsing. From the perspective of the flesh, which had been originally slowly absorbing powers and souls through Baal, it was a strange and dangerous experience to receive back all the energy that it had released at once. It was also great that Yura, Faker, Mir and Leraje attacked in the gaps created every time it took off some flesh to create another being and the accumulated wounds weren’t completely repaired. 

The screams of the flesh as it crumbled like water-soaked mud continued for a long time. Garam’s body, created by it, was also affected and collapsed even more miserably. 

“He is definitely running here right now.” 

Grid—he must have no intention of resting even after he killed Baal. Yura knew he would be working to help his colleagues. This was the reason why. 

“We have to finish it before he arrives. We need to give him a break,” Yura encouraged the group. 

The effect was great. 

Faker, Toban, Mir, and Leraje nodded and struggled to jump on the flow that she had changed. They tore down the red flesh. Soon— 

“Yura!” 

It happened as Grid arrived at the scene... 

[The distortion of hell is released.] 

The situation was over. The terrible screams of the dying red flesh shook the underground area and scattered the souls that it had accumulated like Baal. 

At the same time, in front of the elevator heading for the surface... 

“Mother...” Braham greeted Beriache. He looked sadder than ever. 

“I didn’t want you to come here alone.” 

Braham’s magic power was infested with divinity. It was an obvious divine force. 

Beriache laughed bitterly. “Looking at you, I shouldn’t have given birth to Marie Rose.” 

Then things wouldn’t have been so messy. 

Beriache was holding a long, dark sword in his hand. It was the demon sword made from Baal’s magic power, which she had completely absorbed. 

“I’m relieved. You are trying to protect your little sister.” 

That isn’t it. I’m just trying to keep Grid safe. 

Braham wanted to refute it, but he held back. It was because he thought tears would flow if he opened his mouth.
