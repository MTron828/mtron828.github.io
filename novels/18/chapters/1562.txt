Chapter 1562

[You have taken a highest grade recovery potion.]

[You have taken Haeju’s Potion.]

[You have taken hemostasis medicine.]

[You have taken a sedative.]

“Kuuack...”

The lower body of the struggling Old Sword Demon was tinged with various colors. It was a sign of hastily drinking potions. It was reminiscent of a clown’s makeup. Old Sword Demon found it hard to keep up with the situation.

Suddenly, a dragon appeared. Dozens of robots ran around and finally, there was an explosion that destroyed the city. The scale of the incident was too large to understand and respond to. There was no such absurdity.

‘This isn’t the place for me to be.’

Grid and a dragon—they were transcendents who eclipsed ordinary yangbans. The level was too high. There was nothing he could do if he returned to the scene. Nevertheless, he was thinking about going back. It was to take care of even one more injured person.

‘There will be many people waiting for help...’

The leather armor that Old Sword Demon was proud of had become rags. His body that was covered with all types of wounds was no different. However, Old Sword Demon moved in a busy manner. The people who fortunately survived the explosion a few moments ago. In order to save one more person who would’ve been seriously injured, he moved forward while wiping his blood-stained eyes.

Many memories came to mind. He had shared the hardships, trials, kindness, joy, emotions, love, sadness, and grief of the people who had been living here for over 10 years...

There were memories he couldn’t experience in reality where he was alone. Old Sword Demon wanted to repay the people of this land. Some people might scoff, but he was thankful to them. It was unacceptable that those who had been deceived and suffered all their lives due to gangsters, who claimed to be gods and committed all types of violence, would even suffer a tragic death.

Trudge. Trudge. Trudge...

A dry desert disturbed Old Sword Demon. It clung to his legs, which had become heavy due to the wounds. It was as if it was whispering that he should be alone forever. It seemed to be sneering, ‘Who can you protect?’

Old Sword Demon belatedly realized it. Half of his abdomen was torn apart. His bleeding didn’t stop and his health was being consumed too quickly. The potions hadn’t worked properly.

“Huhu.” He laughed through gritted teeth as if the wounds were nothing, but it was just a bluff. In the end, the face of Old Sword Demon was on the verge of falling into the sand. Then someone approached, grabbed Old Sword Demon’s arm, and supported him.

“This bad guy is tenacious. I can’t be as bad as you.”

The voice was detestable. Old Sword Demon’s blurry vision was filled by this rascal in the traditional bamboo hat.

“The most powerful person among the two of us... do you admit that it is me, not you?”

“Does that matter in this situation?”

“It matters.”

“Well... I have no choice but to acknowledge it this time.”

Hwang Gildong shook his head and applied a lot of medicine to Old Sword Demon’s abdomen. It had a very sweet scent. It was an elixir made using medicinal herbs that were hard to obtain even after searching the world. Old Sword Demon turned his body that couldn’t even move properly.

“What are you doing? Why are you using such precious medicine on me when you know my death isn’t the end...”

“Didn’t you say there is a big loss when you die?” Hwang Gilded retorted. There were numerous shadows behind his back.

The Chivalrous Robbers—the righteous group that fought for the weak people of the East Continent. The hundreds of members had been called by Hwang Gildong and were carrying several people each. Among them...

“Ah! Grandfather!” It included the child who Old Sword Demon rescued along with Agnus. It was the child Old Sword Demon couldn’t care about at the moment of the explosion. He thought the child would’ve died, but he was alive.

“You...” Old Sword Demon held the child who ran to hug him in his arms and looked up at Hwang Gildong with wet eyes.

Hwang Gildong pressed his traditional bamboo hat down deeply over his face. His face couldn’t be seen. “Don’t forget. The reason for today’s crisis is all because of you.”

"...I will keep that in mind.”

Agnus had entered Kaya with the demons. It meant that even if Old Sword Demon hadn’t come forward, Agnus would’ve eventually died at the hands of Hwang Gildong. In other words, the current situation where the dragon appeared and burned the city would be the same.

However, Old Sword Demon couldn’t deny his mistake. He failed to control his anger and caused a battle in the city. It caused more people to become affected by the battle.

Hwang Gildong urged the deeply reflecting Old Sword Demon, “Let’s leave the rest to my men and go to help the Overgeared God.”

“......!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Old Sword Demon was shocked. Hwang Gildong avoided fights that couldn’t be won. It was because he insisted he had a lot of work to do and had to stay alive, yet in Old Sword Demon’s eyes, he was cowardly. However, today, Hwang Gildong wasn’t cowardly. He helped people in an unfavorable situation and now he wanted to help Grid.

‘I’ve misunderstood him all this time.’

His personality might be flawed, but he was overall a good person. Thus, they had been together...

Old Sword Demon thought this while he stood up and asked, “Do you think the Overgeared God has a chance to win?”

“It is hard. A god’s form depends on faith and while the power is different, the dragons of the west are good at fighting. Of course, it is a dragon. There is almost no chance of winning.”

“So why are you going to help?”

“He is the Overgeared God. What is worth risking our lives if not this?”

“......”

That’s right. Hwang Gildong was ready to die. It was due to the belief that Grid would do numerous things in the future. He was convinced that Grid was better than himself. It was from the black tortoise’s incident to now. Hwang Gildong had been using the information network of the Chivalrous Robbers to keep a close eye on Grid.

“...I also agree.”

Old Sword Demon nodded as he clenched his fists hard.

Hwang Gildong—the legend who sustained the East Continent was ready to sacrifice himself for just one player. Old Sword Demon was deeply touched. He was thrilled when he compared it to the days when named NPCs dominated and controlled players.

‘It is said that less than a handful of people can change the world.’

This wasn’t a lie. Grid alone was proving it by changing the world. He was a great person who made Old Sword Demon feel admiration several times.

“Let’s hurry.”

Old Sword Demon and Hwang Gildong no longer talked. They ran as if they couldn’t waste a moment and arrived at the collapsed city. Then in hindsight, they detected an unexpected event. Something they hadn’t felt before the explosion.It was unable to be measured.

A being with enormous power broke into the scene.

“Mir...?”

“Difficulties are occurring one after another.”

Hwang Gildong paid attention to the barrier behind Mir, not Mir. It was a barrier built by divine power.

“The three masters have descended. They are planning to kill a dragon.”

“Kill a dragon...? Then the three masters are fighting with the dragon in that barrier?”

“Probably.”

“Do the three masters have a chance of winning against the dragon?”

“Of course. Unlike the Overgeared God who had just been born, they are gods who have existed since the early days. There are three of them and this is Hanul’s domain. There is a high chance.”

“In any case, this is good. We can rescue the Overgeared God as the three masters and the dragon fight each other.”

Mir was the strongest yangban. He had the characteristic of ‘training every day’ and his growth potential was remarkable. It was clear that if he one day became a god by building up divinity, he would be incomparably stronger than what he was now. However, that was a story of the future. Old Sword Demon thought that he would be a few stages below a dragon right now.

It was just that Hwang Gildong’s reaction was very reluctant. “I wonder if this is actually a good thing.”

“Why?”

“Mir’s energy can’t be compared to the past. I am wondering if we can shake him off until the three masters succeed in killing the dragon. If the three masters join Mir, then all hope is lost...”

Hwang Gildong slowly stopped talking. Old Sword Demon immediately shut his mouth. It was because the flow of the battle was reflected in the eyes of the two men. Mir’s power, which threatened and deceived Grid with every step while rushing forward at the same time, was extremely transcendent.

Before the momentum of the charge disappeared, dozens of sword strikes occurred and thick fog surrounded Grid. It was a phenomenon that occurred when the blood shed by Grid was burned by lightning.

“It is scary.”

Hwang Gildong sighed. The moment the battle began, he realized the situation was even worse than he thought based on the large amount of wounds on Grid. Yet strangely, Grid wasn’t moving a single step. He stood firmly in place and just confronted Mir with ‘one hand.’ It would look like a master dealing with trash if it wasn’t for the continuous bleeding. He really would’ve looked like a master if he fought one-on-one without the help of all his summons.

The blood magic of the direct descendants was canceled. Mir slashed at the source of the magic and neutralized it. Then he leaned his head back to avoid the surprise attack of Overgeared Skeleton One. He didn’t even glance at the sword of Overgeared Skeleton One that passed over his shoulder. Instead, he reached out, grabbed Overgeared Skeleton One by the collar and slammed him into the ground.

Mir paid the price for this move. Due to the numerous runes clinging to his hand, he lost some speed for a while. Overgeared Skeleton Two’s black magic forced Mir’s next action while predicting Randy’s joint attack that would come in the gap. Randy raised his sheath in his left hand the moment the Linked Kill sword dance was destroyed to block the Blue Dragon Dao, only for his two arms to be cut off.

Then Grid’s dao cut through the ground. He saw an opportunity while hammering and used Pinnacle, aiming for the gap Mir showed when he was driven into range by the Overgeared Skeletons and Randy. Unfortunately, it didn’t cause too much damage.

Mir’s judgment, which made him retreat the moment he witnessed the wave of orange, was accurate. Mir’s waistband was lightly cut instead of his abdomen and split in half. The loosened blue dopo fluttered loudly due to the wind pressure that occurred one step later.

“......?"

Hwang Gildong suddenly questioned it as he was speeding up his run. Mir was the owner of the Blue Dragon Dao. The Blue Dragon Dao was known to have the strongest attack power of the relics of the Four Auspicious Beasts. Yet he avoided a confrontation with Grid. He took great risks and forcibly avoided the attack. A lot could be suggested from this.

‘Is that sword greater than the Blue Dragon Dao?’

Hwang Gildong’s gaze was fixed on Gujel’s Dao. A weapon that overpowered the Blue Dragon Dao. He was astonished when he guessed its true identity.

‘A dragon slaying weapon!’

The sound of the explosions continued. They were the explosive sounds created by Mir, who moved quickly again the moment the runes were extinguished. Hwang Gildong missed Mir’s appearance and Mir reappeared in front of Grid a few seconds later.

Blood once again gushed from Grid’s body. He had been slashed dozens of times during the period when Mir disappeared. It meant that Mir’s speed exceeded Grid’s speed. However, blood also spilled from Mir’s chest. Grid’s attack caused more blood to pour out than the combined blood from all over his body.

Grid’s artificial senses—the particles of silver thread and magic power spread out like a cobweb using the God Hands captured Mir’s speed for a moment.

“You are buzzing like a fly. Flies will eventually be caught,” Grid spoke in a low voice. His calm attitude was at odds with the current battle.

Tang tang! Tang tang tang! Tang tang tang tang!

On the other hand, the sound of hammering was becoming extremely fast, so the atmosphere wasn’t very cool.
