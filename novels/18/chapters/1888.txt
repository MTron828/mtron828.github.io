Chapter 1888

The world regained order because the God of Virtue, Grid, released the seal of the Four Auspicious Beasts. It was thanks to this that people regained the forgotten myths, realized their place, and fulfilled their respective duties.

Bang Gwanyeom was one of them. His family reigned as a provincial lord just a few years ago and disturbed the people by committing evil. The story in which the nobles stripped all their people naked because they had to give their robes to the yangbans was so famous that it spread all over the kingdom. They were a vicious family with so many evil deeds that it was difficult to list them all.

However, their disposition completely changed when they remembered the myth they had forgotten. Originally, their family were a traditional warrior family who served God Blue Dragon...

The day when the forgotten myth took root again on the continent. Bang Gwanyeom was surprised to learn something he didn’t know and first offered an apology to his ancestors. He fasted for a month to punish himself for disgracing his family. He prayed and prayed all night to forgive his father and grandfather, who had wrongly educated him.

After that, he ran out of the house and screamed an oath that he would live to serve those who had been harmed by him and his family. Fortunately, his sincerity worked. Those who regained their true gods and their lives had become very generous. They were determined to forget their false past and live a proper life from now on. It was to the point where they considered even the position of a wicked person like Bang Gwanyeom.

Thanks to this, the forgiven Bang Gwanyeom started to be faithful to his duties. He helped the civilian population with his own strength and power. Eventually, he gained fame with the Kaya royal family. The king of Kaya appreciated his efforts and enthusiasm and summoned him to the palace one day.

“I will tell you where God Blue Dragon is staying. Just like your ancestors, you should be acknowledged by God Blue Dragon and serve it sincerely.”

Two months had passed since then. Bang Gwanyeom was guarding the entrance to the White Forest. It was the road leading to the home of God Blue Dragon. Perhaps it was because he had accumulated so many sins, but he still wasn’t welcomed by God Blue Dragon. Nevertheless, Bang Gwanyeom was very moved.

At the very least, he wasn’t kicked out. God Blue Dragon allowed him to act as a guard...

In fact, this alone overwhelmed Bang Gwanyeom. He vowed over and over again that he would stay here until he died of old age one day.

“I guessed she was a celestial maiden.”

“Is she that beautiful?”

“Ah, how many times do I have to say it? Um, come to think of it, you said you have seen Miss Sua before, right? They say she is as beautiful as Sua, who once had a reputation for being the number one beauty in the Cho Kingdom.”

“If you say that, it makes sense. Are you worried about it? There is bound to be a lot of trouble if such a beautiful woman is on the road alone.”

“That’s right. No matter how much better the world has become, there will always be gangsters.”

“Stop.”

“......?!”

The middle-aged men, who were approaching the White Forest while talking, stopped in surprise.

At the entrance of the forest—it was because a big snowman, which hadn’t moved, suddenly opened its mouth.

“A spirit in such a sacred place?”

“The world is getting better.”

It happened the moment the middle-aged men clicked their tongues and drew their swords...

“I am a warrior who worships God Blue Dragon. This is the road leading to the sanctuary, so outsiders aren’t allowed to enter,“ the snowman took a step forward and explained.

The voice was soothing and imbued with innate power. Snow was falling deeply and must’ve covered the man for at least half a day.

“Mr Bang... the great master from the rumors.”

“Looking at his spirit, he doesn’t look like an impersonator.”

The relieved middle-aged people put down their swords. They took the initiative to explain their situation to Bang Gwanyeom.

“We are from Duke Tao Qian’s family. We serve the Four Auspicious Beasts, just like Mr Bang. I’ve come a long way to get the roots of the Box Tree. Can you please understand the situation?”

“Tao Qian... the roots of the Box Tree... I guess the rumor that Lady Tao Qian is suffering from a terminal illness is true.”

“You knew about it?”

The faces of the middle-aged people brightened. It was because they thought the conversation would go well. However, the next words of Bang Gwanyeom were different from what was expected.

“Duke Tao Qian’s situation is pitiful, but I can’t break the rules.”

“Huh...?”

“As I said before, I can’t allow outsiders to enter.”

“What is that...? A person’s life is at stake! Furthermore, Duke Tao Qian is a warrior who serves God White Tiger. The two of you haven’t been in direct contact, but how can you be so indifferent when you are no different from comrades-in-arms?”

“Duke Tao Qian’s position is the same as mine, so I am drawing the line even more.” Bang Gwanyeom sighed and explained, “Those who serve the gods are always ready to give their lives for the gods. Yet invading a god’s realm to save his own daughter’s life? It is a dark thing. Go back. It is better for you to go back empty-handed for Duke Tao Qian.”

Duke Tao Qian himself didn’t know if there was a medicine in the White Forest that would save his daughter.

The attitude of the middle-aged people suddenly changed when Bang Gwanyeom once again issued an order for them to go back.

“A man no different from a thief just a few years ago is now talking about the gods and admonishing us.”

“You vulgar bastard. You cleaned up your identity thanks to the change in the world. You can’t be allowed to take our young lady’s life.”

“Um.”

Bang Gwanyeom was silent. He understood the reactions of the middle-aged people. His past was too shameful. He couldn’t use the excuse that the yangbans cursed his family because long ago in the distant past, his family worshiped God Blue Dragon.

The Tao Qian family of the Pa Kingdom—even in the distorted world, the apostles of the Four Auspicious Beasts who lived for the people existed.

“I understand your loyalty.”

It was the same in the days when the gods were lost and after the gods were restored. The Tao Qian family were great, unlike him. The family members were deeply loyal. Bang Gwanyeom was convinced. For that reason, the level of their family members was raised. Even considering this, they had very excellent skills.

‘They are warriors who have been honing their natural talents all their lives.’

They were real ones. They must’ve lived a different quality of life than he did, who flattered the yangbans and bullied the common people. They were born with a fortunate lineage and it would be sinful to trample on them.

Bang Gwanyeom drew his weapon. It was with the judgment that their level was so high that it would be difficult to suppress them unless their wrists were cut.

However, the blade’s trajectory was off. The same was true for the swords of the middle-aged people. A sword flew in like a flash of light and struck the swords of the middle-aged men and Bang Gwanyeom one after another, shifting the trajectory.

‘A transcendent...!’

If their level was high, then they generally had good discerning eyes. The frightened Bang Gwanyeom and the middle-aged people shifted their gazes in the direction the sword had come from. Standing there was a blonde-haired woman. She was as beautiful as a celestial maiden who came down from the sky. She smiled with thin eyes that were hard to tell if they were closed or open.

“You seem like straightforward people. Please resolve it peacefully through dialogue.”

The identity of the blonde-haired woman who spoke was Grid. He was trying very hard to imitate Basara’s actions that he had seen and experienced firsthand.

“Something... is disgusting. Squeak.”

The mouse hiding in his sleeve spoke nonsense, but he ignored it.

“Can I ask for this distinguished lady’s name?” Bang Gwanyeom cautiously asked.

No matter whether it was her appearance or her clothes, she looked like she was from the west. He wouldn’t know her identity even if he heard her name. The opportunity to ask a valuable question was wasted.

Bang Gwanyeom was regretting it while the middle-aged people murmured.

“Is she perhaps...?”

“She is one of the ones I mentioned earlier.”

A beautiful woman with long black hair and a beautiful blond-haired woman with an attractive smile—they were the best-looking women who had been a hot topic in Kaya lately. They appeared out of nowhere. Suddenly, one of them appeared in the area of the gods. She was even a transcendent. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They had a bad feeling. It took a moment for the middle-aged people to decide it was better to cooperate with her. But before they could bring it up, their minds became blank.

“My name is Basara.”

Grid’s wife and the queen of Titan, the second capital of the Empire—Grid revealed this name first and tried to introduce himself.

“I-I greet the wife of the God of Virtue!”

Bang Gwanyeom and the middle-aged people interrupted his speech by kneeling down and bowing.

A continent far beyond the Red Sea. It was difficult for them to grasp all the people of the West Continent unless they were in a unique position and had an extraordinary intelligence network. However, there were few exceptions and one of them was Basara.

One of the two wives of the God of Virtue. There were many rumors about her. It was because the soldiers who often went to the West Continent during and after the Great Human and Demon War witnessed her and praised her as beautiful after they returned. They made a lot of noise and said that the God of Virtue took her as his wife for a reason.

“H-How did Your Highness, one of the noblest people in the world, travel so far in person?”

The characteristics of Basara and the characteristics of the woman in front of her were quite consistent. Moreover, it was just after witnessing her incredible skills.

Bang Gwanyeom and the middle-aged people didn’t dare have doubts and obediently accepted Grid’s identity. It was an unexpected development from Grid’s perspective, but it was quite convenient.

“As one of his four wives, God Grid has personally bestowed upon me a special mission.”

He tried to reproduce Basara’s tone as much as possible.

“...Four?” one of the middle-aged men suddenly asked in amazement before hurriedly shutting up.

The God of Virtue—Grid was the symbol of benevolence. He belatedly thought it was natural for Grid to have multiple wives.

“Are you here to see God Blue Dragon?”

“Yes.”

Bang Gwanyeom calmed down and explained patiently, “I‘m sorry, but outsiders aren’t allowed to enter after this. Please wait. I don’t know how many days it will take, but I will ask for permission from God Blue Dragon...” No matter how noble she was, she wasn’t Grid. Therefore, Bang Gwanyeom tried to do his duty.

At this point, even the middle-aged people were clicking their tongues. The reason why this person didn’t open the way for them—they realized it wasn’t because he was ignoring them or had any ill feelings toward Duke Tao Qian. It was because he was upright to this extent. They regretted that they had wielded their swords recklessly. They shouldn’t have judged with prejudice caused by the rumors they heard during the days of distortion.

It happened as the middle-aged people were reflecting on themselves...

They heard thunder and a bright blue thunderbolt struck Bang Gwanyeom’s body.

“Keeeok!”

Was it a demonic human?

The middle-aged people watched in a daze as Bang Gwanyeom screamed in a terrible manner and flew away, breaking several trees before rolling on the ground and trembling.

The shadow of a god—they noticed the shadow of the Blue Dragon covering the snowy ground. Was the Blue Dragon angry at the commotion? The middle-aged people didn’t dare to look up and started to tremble. Then they soon doubted their ears.

-I’m sorry... don’t get me wrong. That spoiled person has nothing to do with me...

It must be the voice of God Blue Dragon. But it was apologizing. It was toward a woman who was just a human being, even if she was the wife of the God of Virtue. Just the shape of the shadow showed that its head seemed to be lowered.

“Really? I was happy to think God Blue Dragon has a good person by your side. It is a pity that it is a misunderstanding.”

-I will keep him by my side starting from tomorrow.

“You thought well. Shall we start with treatment first?”

-Human beings are most precious to me, so I didn’t hurt them hastily. I just pushed him, so don’t worry.

“I’m glad.”

“......”

[Your wife, ‘Basara,’ has obtained divinity.]

A being who made the Blue Dragon bow—she couldn’t be accepted as a human being. In the first place, the background of Grid’s wife was extraordinary. She was naturally deified. Moreover, the middle-aged people had very high standings in the Pa Kingdom. The sighting would gain credibility and quickly spread across the country.

Thanks to this, Grid quickly achieved his desired result. He smiled happily and took off the skin mask. He followed the Blue Dragon’s guidance and walked deep into the forest. After a while—

“......”

A tree root fell in front of the middle-aged people who couldn’t raise their heads. It was the root of the Box Tree.

“Ahh... Thank you. Thank you...”

The man who sought to be recognized as an apostle of the Blue Dragon and the people who worked hard to relieve their master’s worries—at this moment, their wishes were fulfilled. It was due to Grid’s influence, which was getting stronger day by day.

At the same time, at a swamp...

“It is on a different level from ordinary daoist immortals.”

Hwang Gildong, who was walking in front, took a big step back. It was with a very flustered and hurried look. It didn’t match the behavior of a transcendent who easily took care of the well-being of the world in the face of any natural disaster.

After all, Hwang Gildong was a person who fought fierce battles with half-gods. He had accumulated experiences that weren’t possible for ordinary people, even if they died and were reborn several times. However, he was intimidated because he didn’t understand the situation. The momentum emitted by the old man who blocked the road went beyond the perception of a transcendent.

“Isn’t this at the level of being called the best among the daoist immortals?”

There were hundreds of amulets floating around him right now.

“You must not touch this imoogi,” the old man warned Hwang Gildong, who was sweating, and Kraugel, who was quietly observing the situation.

The landscape changed several times before even a single word was completed. There was a subtle overlapping of formations.

Kraugel seriously thought, ‘I think Grid should’ve been in charge of this.’
