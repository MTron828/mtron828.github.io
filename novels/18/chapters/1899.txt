Chapter 1899

[I’ll be blunt.]

His gaze, that went backwards in the aftermath of his half-severed throat, straightened up. It was in a natural manner.

King Sobyeol didn’t die easily. The muscles melted by Bunhelier’s Breath and the bones torn apart by Grid’s Twilight were quickly restored with his divinity.

A true god was a concept. They didn’t perish unless they were forgotten. The body was just a tool necessary for activities. King Sobyeol was the son of a God of the Beginning and his body was a tool worthy of joining the discussion of the strongest tool.

[Cooperate with me to punish Asgard. The favors I have shown you over the years aren’t small. You can trust my suggestion.]

Grid thought, ‘People who have ulterior motives are like this.’

In fact, King Sobyeol’s position of wanting to cooperate with Grid was actually very reasonable. For him, Asgard was the home he had to reclaim.

However, Grid didn’t consider King Sobyeol’s position. It was due to the prejudice created by the experience of almost being stabbed in the back by Amoract. There was no way he could trust King Sobyeol, who dropped his own brother into hell.

[...Think carefully.] Once there was no answer, King Sobyeol tried to persuade him again. It was to his advantage for the conversation to drag out longer. Chiyou must’ve felt Grid’s presence and would soon descend here. Then King Sobyeol would have the upper hand in the negotiations.

[Think of the benefits of working with me. You must be fully aware that the situation is against you, right?]

There was a limit, no matter how fast the speed of their intent was.

Only a few seconds had already passed since Grid’s appearance.

King Sobyeol held out well against Grid, who united with the Evil Dragon and poured out all his strength. It was the power of an Absolute.

Grid must’ve felt it as well. It would be burdensome to engage in a conversation. Grid must’ve noticed that it was impossible for him to retreat before Chiyou arrived.

“Are you done now?” Grid retorted as he looked at King Sobyeol, who didn’t hide his confidence. Then Grid swapped his sword.

King Sobyeol’s head cocked at an angle. For a moment, he didn’t understand why the conversation was cut off. He realized the situation only after he felt the present day Sword Saint’s presence getting closer.

[You have too much confidence.]

Kraugel’s swift approach was achieved due to flying on a sword. He hadn’t fully recovered from his wounds and he wasn’t much of a threat to King Sobyeol.

The reason King Sobyeol was cut by Kraugel’s sword early was purely due to Bunhelier. The cause was that his route was read while he was trying to avoid the Breath of the crazy Evil Dragon, who always acted contrary to common sense.

Now it was different. King Sobyeol was free. It was because Bunhelier, carrying Grid, passed by King Sobyeol and headed for the lake where the imoogi was.

[Are you going to aim at the imoogi without fighting me?] King Sobyeol burst out laughing.

First of all, this imoogi was very strong. It had skin and scales that could withstand the Breath of the Evil Dragon. King Sobyeol had experienced it himself. Moreover, King Sobyeol had no intention of letting the yeouiju be taken away.

[Do you believe that the present day Sword Saint will buy time for you?!] King Sobyeol declared. Then he caught sight of Kraugel’s blade, which had come close to him.

A dragon weapon—it even looked exactly like Grid’s sword. However, the power was significantly reduced.

The power of Grid’s sword that King Sobyeol just experienced... it was powerful enough to send shivers down his spine just thinking about it. At one point, it was even more powerful than the Evil Dragon’s Breath.

[You still have a long way to go, Sword Saint.]

King Sobyeol didn’t feel the need to exchange blows with Kraugel. A legend who had only achieved a few levels of transcendence wasn’t the opponent of an Absolute. King Sobyeol extended the time and stretched out his hand in a leisurely manner. He intended to grab the wrist of Kraugel, who was approaching slowly like he was in slow motion.

However, King Sobyeol couldn’t achieve his goal. Kraugel’s wrist, which should’ve been grabbed, seemed to blur and moved to the side.

King Sobyeol missed it.

[What?]

Then a ray of neutral light rose from King Sobyeol’s neck. It was divinity that replaced all the blood that had been spilled from him when he was seriously injured by Grid and Bunhelier in succession.

[The sword that can cut anything isn’t omnipotent, right?]

In order to cut, the premise of ‘the target must be hit’ must be established. This was why the Sword Saint couldn’t face an Absolute in a one-on-one match, no matter how great his swordsmanship. But now, Kraugel slit the throat of King Sobyeol. Coincidentally, he aimed perfectly at the place that had just been cut by Grid. It was thanks to the additional effect of Kraugel’s Twilight.

[Make Twilight Become Dawn]

[Passive.

Gain the maximum hit rate correction against targets wounded by the ‘Twilight’ of Only One God Grid.

This effect is maintained until the target is killed.

Even if Twilight falls and the night passes, the next day’s dawn will come.]

Kraugel’s Twilight relentlessly aimed at the target. It was an extreme use of growth-type items. The biggest strength of growth-type items was that they ‘grew with their masters.’ Every time the item rating increased, effects were added that could help the master based on the master’s inclination. Make Twilight Become Dawn was one of them.

The experience of fighting with Grid on several occasions made it possible. Maybe it was a miracle created by the resonating of the two Twilights.

[It is better for you to be killed. We will be allies when you open your eyes again, so don’t grumble too much.] King Sobyeol raised the danger level of Kraugel and drew the string of the great bow. Dozens of shots filled with divinity, capable of destroying mountain peaks with a single blow, were fired from close range and aimed only at Kraugel.

Kraugel didn’t bother to avoid them. The opponent was an Absolute. Kraugel had overcome many physical problems such as speed thanks to the absolute hit rate correction effect, but it was only minimal help. He couldn’t waste even a small movement.

A glass-like barrier of magic power was created and destroyed in succession around Kraugel. It was the shield support from Braham, Euphemina, Zednos, and Laella.

[Your strength has increased dramatically.]

[Your stamina has increased dramatically.]

[Your agility has increased dramatically.]

[Your health recovery speed has increased dramatically.]

[The power of the items you have equipped will increase.]

[Your health has been significantly restored.]

[Your damaged bones and organs will regenerate quickly.]

Ruby’s blessings were focused on Kraugel.

“I will support you!” Yura and Jishuka fired at King Sobyeol’s wrist. They couldn’t cause a critical wound even aiming for the vital point, but they could prevent him from fully using his weapon.

“Fortunately, I’m not too late!! Sun—Guard!”

“Aura Blade.”

“King Sobyeol...!”

Vantner and Hurent also arrived at the scene of the attack and supported Kraugel. The yangbans hesitated, but didn’t change their side.

Piaro and Huroi, who were originally blocking the imoogi, also did their best to attract King Sobyeol’s attention. They were freed up once Grid and Bunhelier started attacking the imoogi.

It was truly an all-out offensive. It felt like the group that was originally united around Grid had been reorganized around Kraugel.

[You are pitiful.] King Sobyeol considered it to be just a small game. He even felt pity. From the point when Grid and the Evil Dragon left, all their wisdom and power had been reduced to being worthless. The present day Sword Saint didn’t deserve to replace Grid’s spot.

It wasn’t Kraugel’s problem. It wasn’t possible unless it was Chiyou. It was King Sobyeol’s sentiment and the truth that no one in the world could replace Grid.

[Come.]

What is the point even if you can cut me? The moment you cut me, I will also cut you down.

At the same time that King Sobyeol was decapitated, Kraugel’s right arm was also cut off.

Kraugel had already switched Twilight to his left hand. Twilight’s red-stained blood pierced through the blood of his right arm that was splattering in the air and pierced the throat of King Sobyeol again. Kraugel’s left ear and cheek were cut in exchange. He narrowly escaped both sides being cut.

The power was fortunately halved thanks to the magic shields of the magicians, who overlapped dozens of them.

“Cough!” Zednos and Laella slumped to the ground while coughing up blood. It was magic power backlash. They suffered internal injuries in the aftermath of the damage far exceeding what the shields could handle.

It was the same with Euphemina. No, her condition was much worse. The Mana Shield that targeted and deployed around Kraugel. Obviously, the faster the casting, the more the number of shields that could be stacked.

In that sense, Euphemina was too capable. During the time when Zednos and Laella cast two or three shields, she had cast ten shields. This meant she received more backlash. She entered the immortality state just for blocking this blow. She was effectively a living corpse.

“One second. No, I’ll step back and take a break when I have 0.2 seconds left.” Euphemina’s face turned white and she barely suppressed her trembling voice as she cast the shield again. This was the only way for a magician to play an active role against an Absolute who never allowed attack magic to hit. Ironically, it was the role of a tanker. She had no choice but to do her best.

Red rain started to pour down from the sky. It was a huge amount of bleeding that made it hard to believe it was the blood shed from one person. It was all the blood that Kraugel spilled.

The more Ruby and the magicians prolonged Kraugel’s life, the more miserable Kraugel’s state became. Brain fluids flowed down from his diagonally severed heads and both eyes had already been cut out for the fourth time. All the muscles in important parts of his body were torn. His body was full of stab or cut wounds, revealing many bones and organs.

In the end, only his left arm remained intact. It was a situation where his right arm was cut off again and again just before it regenerated. He would lose any means of attack if he lost his left arm, so Kraugel devoted himself to defending it.

Kraugel thought, ‘The opponent is an Absolute. There is no way other than directly cutting him.’

‘Heart Sword’ had been used several times, but it didn’t deal a significant blow to King Sobyeol. There was just a fleeting pause. This was too short a time for Kraugel to take advantage of. He just wasted mana uselessly.

[It is the end.] King Sobyeol saw Kraugel’s eyes, which lost focus at last, and responded with some frustration. He never thought he would fight a battle of attrition against a single swordsman who wasn’t even an Absolute.

[You were great.] King Sobyeol didn’t hide his feelings. HIs intent was imprinted on the world and elevated Kraugel’s status. Of course, this didn’t affect the trend of the battle much. In the first place, there was something else that Kraugel believed in.

Finally, King Sobyeol beheaded Kraugel. It was literally a beheading. Since his head had been cut off his neck, his immortality state didn’t work properly.

“Ah.” There were sighs everywhere. In particular, the anger of the damage dealers was great as they barely managed to reach the battle location by using the Blue Dragon’s Boots or the beanstalks planted by Piaro, only to crash down.

This was a battle in the air. The amount of mana consumed by the Blue Dragon’s Boots was so large that most damage dealers were vulnerable. They couldn’t help Kraugel.

“Shit! Die. You bastaaaaard!”

Just as Grid was always left alone, this time they left Kraugel alone...

It happened when the frantic Vantner was roaring...

Flinch.

Kraugel’s Twilight, which had stopped just before reaching King Sobyeol’s neck, suddenly moved.

Kraugel died standing—there was no other way to put it, yet his left arm moved. It was despite it slowly turning to ash.

[......!]

King Sobyeol’s expression stiffened. He had a terrible feeling that he never experienced before. Kraugel’s left arm and the dark shadows on Twilight that were elongating...

[The name ‘King Sobyeol’ has been recorded in the ‘Kill List.’]

It was the opportunity that ‘Grid’s shadow,’ which had been holding his breath while dwelling in the shadow of the present day Sword Saint, had been waiting for. He critically injured King Sobyeol at the end of the period of perseverance.

[Kuek...!]

King Sobyeol groaned like he had allowed a hit from Grid. It was the power of Kill List, which combined with the dragon weapon to dramatically increase its power. It was obviously a serious wound.

King Sobyeol’s hands trembled. He couldn’t easily pull out the red dagger that was stuck in his neck along with Twilight.

At the same time, the body of the imoogi, standing tall in the distance, started tilting. The time earned by his colleagues wasn’t wasted by Grid.
