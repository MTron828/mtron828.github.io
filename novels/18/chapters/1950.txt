Chapter 1950

[Link]

[Perform a sword dance that symbolizes memories. The number of swings and the effect of the attack will change depending on the relationship you recall.

Skill Mana Cost: Depends on the number of sword swings.

Skill Cooldown Time: 90 seconds]

‘Um...?’

Grid frowned. Originally, Link was a sword dance that allowed him to dance like a butterfly. The number of attacks were supposed to be proportional to his speed. What did it mean by a sword dance that symbolizes memories? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Moreover, why did the number of attacks change depending on the relationship he remembered? Was it telling him to think of people’s faces every time he performed a sword dance?

‘The skill explanation is...’

It offended Grid. He quickly regained his composure after reflecting on Lord’s sword dance. Lord’s Link was different from his. It was more like a buff skill that empowered the people around him.

How did the child feel when using a skill such as this? The more Grid thought about it, the more satisfying it seemed. He also realized something important.

‘It seems this skill will prove to be quite a headache to use, but...’

He should accept that the sword dance had been changed to be influenced by a relationship that was important to him. After all, this was an understandable development.

‘Maybe it will prove to be quite useful, and I shouldn’t worry too much.’

Grid speculated that every time Link was activated, a list of friends or NPCS he had a high affinity with would pop up. He also believed the shape of the Link would change depending on the person he chose from that list. Originally, this skill had been an offensive sword dance, but Lord had changed its capabilities. Grid accepted that he was able to further amplify that capability.

Meanwhile, Braham was in great shock.

‘He is a monster.’

Traces of battle were evident everywhere around the lair. There were thousands of them, different in shape and size. However, Braham saw that many of them had been intentionally left behind by Judar.

Depending on how they were created, these were fragments of magic that could be used for large-scale spells. It was obvious that throughout the battle, Judar had calculated and controlled what kind of traces his attack would leave on which area in the battlefield. At the same time, he seemed to be very capable since he managed to keep up with Grid for even a little bit. These traces were something only Judar was capable of leaving behind.

‘He is the god of wisdom after all...’

Braham was deep in thought while trying to cast magic on the traces under his feet. Flames exploded, and Braham’s face instantly paled.

He gave an urgent warning to Grid.

-Judar has drawn a large magic circle. It’s already complete and cannot be destroyed or transformed. Don’t provoke him until we find out how to deal with this.

Braham shielded Lord, Faker, and Kasim in his shadow, before resuming his investigation on the traces. He was concentrating deeply, believing he had to succeed in deciphering Judar’s magic in order to become the true master of the title of God of Wisdom.

Grid glared at his ragged opponent. He could’ve killed Judar by slitting his throat immediately, but Braham’s warning made him hesitate. Moreover, killing the body didn’t prevent the soul from escaping. Thus, it was impossible for him to act hastily. He didn’t want to let Judar live.

Judar’s power was too versatile and the stakes were too high. If he survived, there would be serious consequences for a long time to come.

‘In any case, it’s easier to progress if I get the god killing energy.’

Grid’s expression turned serious as the dying Judar sneered.

“Your apostle has seen through my magic. After all, he earned the title of God of Magic and Wisdom for a reason.”

Based on the way he was speaking, he seemed to have lost all his magic, divine power, and other energies. Grid doubted Judar still had enough energy to activate the magic circle.

He skeptically glanced in Braham’s direction, but Braham shook his head.

-The magic circle is brimming with power. It will work regardless of Judar’s current state. However, this seems to be magic that Judar made in preparation for his death. I wonder if he is aiming to drag us into the grave with him.

Braham knew how great Grid’s survival ability was. Judar, however, did not. Grid was just as puzzled as Braham. He realized something.

‘The magic isn’t aimed at me.’

Judar was obsessed with killing Trauka. He would’ve prepared a back-up plan if he failed in his mission. The magic circle seemed to serve as his insurance.

If Judar died without fulfilling his goal, this magic would activate and bring Trauka down with him. Judar was aiming to gain more than the status he would lose from dying.

“Nefelina!”

Reading the enemy’s intentions, Grid moved without hesitating. He summoned Nefelina to his side and activated Dragon Knight. His target was now Trauka’s neck.

He was reluctant to kill a dragon. Grid might be cold-blooded, but he wasn’t evil. He might be terrible, but he wasn’t ungrateful. He had formed connections with the old dragons and developed quite an affinity with them.

Still, the existence of dragons was a threat to humanity. He hoped the relationship between humans and dragons wouldn’t be pushed to the extreme.

‘We’ve been through so much, and I even resurrected the refraction dragon.’

If they thought they also owed him a favor, he wanted to improve their relationship, even if it meant putting a lot of time into it. He felt hopeful recalling Nefelina’s wish to live with humans, his memories with Bunhelier, and Cranbel’s kindness.

However, now Grid’s heart was pouring with avarice. Judar was going to kill Trauka, and he couldn’t let that happen.

“Bah!”

Naturally, Judar also understood what Grid’s intentions were. He snorted and cast a spell. The lair shook like it was about to be uprooted and turned into a deep shade of blue.

[Grrrr....]

Trauka had been motionless like a stuffed animal no matter the events unfolding around him. Now, he suddenly made a sound. He released a great deal of heat and killing intent, spreading to all corners of the lair. It wasn’t aimed at Grid, Judar, or the group of dragons.

A red light poured from Trauka’s eyes like he was crying. Judar realized something when he saw this and sighed.

‘Is this the terrible instinct that was inputted in him by the foreign god? If even you, an apostle of this god, is just another actor performing on stage according to your predetermined fate—even if I was to rise to a higher state of being...’

Baaaaaaang!

Judar’s complicated thoughts aside, the magic was completed. Faker emerged from Lord’s shadow, summoned shadow soldiers to form a barrier, and held Lord in his arms. Kasim tried to defend the boy, but Faker stopped him.

Kasim was once praised as the King of Shadows, but he couldn’t oppose Faker, who was the greatest assassin of this era. He was crushed by Faker’s shadow, and couldn’t emerge from Lord’s.

Kasim cried out with deep resentment. “Why are you interfering...?!”

For him, who had lost everything decades ago, the only thing that mattered to him now was Lord. He wanted to curse out Faker, who meddled with his efforts to protect his only student.

But in the end, he couldn’t curse him at all. Faker smiled at him.

Meanwhile, Braham’s complexion changed as he also made it to Lord’s side. He layered magic shields over Faker’s barrier, but he still didn’t feel safe. He extracted a large amount of blood through his heart and set up a blood curtain.

Lord witnessed everything unfold, wanting to keep these memories forever ingrained in his heart.

Baaaang!

There was an explosion below. The ground on which people were standing disappeared without a trace, and sound also vanished.

“......!”

The group of dragons, including Revola and Haranbeka, were saying something, but it was hard to discern their words. They were all frightened, their scales and flesh turning bloody, melting away. They were being reshaped into round hearts that were sucked into Trauka’s mouth.

An incandescent light emerged everywhere.

Tens of thousands of rocks floating in the air were reduced to ashes and disappeared in this light. Half the lair was gone before everyone could even react. Trauka roared and unfurled his huge wings as he was pierced and torn apart by the blue rays of light.

He had used his authority as a being of a higher hierarchy to easily prey on his exhausted kin and refined a fake heart. Still, he couldn’t recover enough strength to handle the bombardment of blue rays emitted by the thousands of magic circles.

As destruction continued to spread, Judar’s body was disintegrating into particles.

I just want to feel alive in the real world, where I can decide my own destiny. That’s it...

He kept repeating these words, words he had never told anyone.

Grid charged forward at the speed of light, stopped between Trauka and Judar and activated Transcend. Nefelina released a Breath while he swung his sword desperately along with the God Hands. Two flashes of black and hundreds of sword energies rained down on Judar and Trauka at the same time.

With this, the reward for defeating Judar was secured without any further casualties. However, the verdict of who killed Trauka was likely to be in Judar’s favor, who had dealt more damage.

Unless Judar died outright...

“......!”

Grid was checking the gradually disappearing space with a gloomy expression when he noticed someone in the entrance of the lair. Kraugel had just arrived at the scene. He leaned back and straightened his posture. His gaze passed over Grid and fell on Judar. He looked like he was getting ready to cut through empty space.

‘Why?’

Grid was puzzled because he couldn’t guess Kraugel’s intentions. He suddenly came up with a hypothesis and pulled out his Falling Moon Sword. The pale sword sucked in the light around him and ended the cooldown of Link.

However, he waited. It wasn’t like he was in a hurry.

Grid silently examined Judar’s condition while slowly unfolding the Link sword dance. People’s faces flashed in his mind. Yura, Jishuka, Irene, Lord, Khan, Kraugel, Braham, Mercedes, Hayate, Biban, Damian, Marie Rose, and many more... It felt like looking at the stars in the night sky. There were so many that he didn’t dare to count them.

Grid instinctively focused on Kraugel’s face.

[Link with Kraugel is working.]

[The power of the sword dance displays acute discipline.]

The tip of the Falling Moon Sword, which was emitting ferocious waves of energy while Grid was under the effect of Transcend, flashed with an even brighter light. For some reason, the blue sword energy mixed with gold accumulated at an incredible speed. This made it look like a crescent moon had been placed on the blade of the sword.

Kraugel looked with wonder in his eyes before moving his weapon as well.

“Link.”

Grid fired a beam of sword energy at the air above Judar’s head. Judar was slowly disappearing, unable to handle the power of the spell.

Finally, an ash pillar shot upward. Grid’s Link and Kraugel’s Space Sword crossed each other as they slashed the pillar.

The explosion stopped. The air cleared and sound returned to normal.

Ohhhh....

Trauka’s final death noise echoed.

[Sword Saint ‘Kraugel’ has killed ‘Judar’, the God of Wisdom, and gained the energy of a god killer.]

[Only One God ‘Grid’ has killed ‘Judar’, the God of Wisdom, and Fire Dragon Trauka...]

[......]

[...]

[...Only One God ‘Grid’ has obtained the energy of Annihilation.]

Shivers ran down both men’s bodies as they exchanged looks. They looked at each other with unconditional trust.

Grid was rushing over to Lord’s side when two souls, in danger of going out like candles, approached and hovered near him.

Grid’s frown gradually deepened as he listened to the whispers of the souls.
