Chapter 974

Chris saw the odds of this mission succeeding as over 90%.

There were four months remaining on the truce agreement with the empire.

The agreement between nations was protected by the system so the empire and Overgeared Kingdom were unable to attack each other. The Overgeared members were guarding the evil eyes village and the empire couldn’t attack wildly.

Even if the empire invaded the village, the Overgeared members just needed to guard the gates and they would be able to protect the evil eyes king until Grid arrived.

‘These villains from my past life!’

However, the empire took different actions than expected.

They indirectly invaded by using external forces.

Chris’ expression instantly darkened.

‘Those villainous empire bastards, they intend to thoroughly consume our strength in this life, sealing the cycle of reincarnation and ending it all here!’

Chris quickly swung Grid’s greatsword, the cross-shaped trajectory of the sword striking the upper body of the two assassins moving through the darkness and killing them.

The assassins with low defense were easily killed by Chris, who had the most powerful attack power.

‘Dammit, it is a mess.’

Chris jumped to the nearby roof of the mansion and shook as he watched the whole city. There were battles taking place all over the village and the assassins who appeared in pairs were powerful enough to dominate two elite military units.

‘They easily cope with two elite units containing 100 high level players...’

Was this truly rabble hired by the empire?

Chris raised the power of the Tyrant and flew forward.

The further he moved, the more his attack power increased.

“Viscount Chris!”

The expressions of the Overgeared soldiers still looked threatened despite capturing the assassins. Chris appeared like the raging wind and saved them from the assassins.

Chris ordered the unit leaders.

"Assemble your troops at the castle of the great evil eyes king who deals with dark flames and white ice and sees the truth of the world. It should never be breached, even if you must risk your soul being casted out of the circle of reincarnation or even destroyed.”

“Yes!”

Among the 10 meritorious retainers, Chris was one of the twin leaders along with Jishuka. It wasn’t a problem for him to operate the troops using his own judgment.

The soldiers replied vigorously and saved another unit as they marched in the same direction.

In the meantime, Chris moved along the roofs towards the village centre while killing assassins.

The heart of the village was a small library. It was a place where Lauel, Jishuka, Pon and Regas were guarding.

The reason why the top rankers were gathered there was because it was one of the most important bases in the village.

“I have come to keep the promise of our previous life.”

Chris broke through the assassins surrounding the library and stood by Lauel. Jishuka was covering him by firing arrows while Lauel looked like he had aged 10 years.

"As expected, the empire seems to covet the knowledge and information which was sealed deep within the library to keep the world safe.”

“Certainly...”

In other places, the assassins appeared in pairs while there were dozens of assassins here.

Chris faced more than 100 assassins and wondered,

“What the hell are these guys? Are they slicing through the dimension itself, appearing from the dimensional gap out of thin air without going through the door? Not even Faker who has unsealed the right arm of the God of Death can do that.”

“They are borrowing the power of the akashic records.”

“The akashic records... magic?”

“Yes. An excellent magician who has gained enlightenment and hatched out of their egg by breaking it can make the space itself weak, allowing people to warp in.”

“It doesn’t feel like Mass Teleport since they are scattered all over the place... Is it easy for a great magician to use this type of magic?”

“I don’t know about ordinary magicians but it is easy for a transcendent.”

“A transcendent...!”

One of the five pillars of the empire and the head of the Tower of Eternity.

Chris recalled the infamous Goldhit and was convinced.

“It is a fraudulent magic that grasps at the long forgotten thing called fear within me... How long can we last if troops keep being sent this way? Despite us being chosen ones born in the brightest day and the blackest night, blessed by both sun and moon, there is a limit to our stamina. We will run out of supplies and become exhausted, unable to unleash the full capabilities of our divine and sacred strength.”

Chris confided the anxiety in his heart. He didn’t feel suspicious about why Lauel hadn’t anticipated the current situation.

It was true that Lauel was intelligent enough to be called a genius but he wasn’t always successful. It wasn’t possible for Lauel to cope with all the variables. He often failed and made mistakes.

However, this time was different.

Lauel didn’t take this situation seriously.

“There is a limit to a transcendent’s magic power, just as we have a limit to our stamina while being sealed in this weak vessel called a human body.”

“It is the same whether they are making a frontal charge or moving with magic. We can’t stop it if troops pour in all at once.”

“Kukuku... There is no need to worry about a volume offensive. Hasn’t this one shown his heaven-defying genius already when it was explained to you last time?”

“...?”

"Our enemies from the past life, despite being reborn under a forbidden star which granted them unimaginable wealth and power that they used to form what is called the empire, do not have infinite money. They will have to give compensation so they won’t be able to easily pour in a lot of troops.”

"The empire will have to pay to move them? Can’t the empire move them for free?”

Nearly every kingdom or group on this continent had been offering tribute to the empire for hundreds of years. They were complete slaves of the empire. Chris wasn’t convinced that the empire would pay compensation for moving them.

Lauel explained.

“Do you know why existing groups have lived like dead mice without resisting the empire despite it being the enemy of the world?”

“...?”

“It is because they think the empire’s power is infinite. The empire isn’t in a position to show weakness. The moment the empire offers no money, other countries will question the empire’s power and the dominance will weaken.”

“That’s why they have to offer a reward every time they move outside forces?”

"It’s a commonly used bluffing system. The empire shines like the brightest sun, blinding everyone with their light, making people unable to see their faults.”

“There is something I can’t understand. Lauel, my companion of eternity, why do you keep saying that the empire is poor?”

It was strange.

This was the empire that dominated the continent for hundreds of years. The empire monopolized all sorts of resources and invaded other kingdoms.

Yet they were so poor that they couldn’t move some outside forces?

Creating quests for 500 million players might be too much but the assumption that it was hard to move subordinate forces didn’t make sense. It didn’t make sense that the empire was poor.

Lauel was quietly using magic while listening to Chris’ questions.

He changed the wind direction to maximize the power of Jishuka’s arrows while also neutralizing the assassins’ throwing techniques. He also created an earthquake every time they approaching, leading them directly to Chris.

Lauel was fighting effectively despite having few combat skills.

It was a combat method that made people realize whey there was the ‘fight cleverly’ saying when praising athletes and martial artists.

Lauel’s brilliant brain was creating a disaster for the enemies.

"I thought of something while watching the magic machine in the National Competition. How much manpower and money did the empire invest in unearthing the ancient artifacts? How much techniques and money were poured in to restore and operate the ancient relics?”

“Do you mean that the empire is poor because of the magic machines?”

“No. The magic machines are just one of the causes. I just came to a more fundamental question.”

“Fundamental question?”

“If the empire is truly as wealth as people widely think, it isn’t normal for them to struggle to suppress the Overgeared Kingdom and Valhalla.”

“...?”

“Can’t they step on the Overgeared Kingdom by constantly producing and dispatching infinite troops, just as you claim now?”

“Ah...!”

Chris felt like he had been struck by lightning as he gained enlightenment.

Lauel was a person who was concerned about the empire’s tactics and he was also the first person to realize the limits of the empire’s tactics.

“You... You really are the number 1 unequalled genius under both heaven and earth...”

Lauel laughed at Chris’ heartfelt admiration.

"Time is fair to everyone.”

As Grid grew, Lauel was also growing. He studied, thought, accumulated knowledge and developed his vision.

"I don’t know what type of genius that God of War Ares recruited.”

Lauel activated a pre-set trap to lure out the hiding assassins.

Then he laughed while covering half his face with his hand.

"That person needs to be ready to deal with me now.”

Lauel was convinced.

Grid and Kraugel had grown rapidly over the years.

They had an absolute force that made strategy and tactics obsolete and no one could be their opponent.

At this moment, grey pillars rose continuously in the evil eyes village.

They were the pillars that symbolized the death of the invaders.

‘That is...’

Chris and Lauel turned towards the south without speaking.

It was the direction of the city entrance where the grey pillars were occurring the fastest.

It was the zone that Yura was protecting.

Chris clicked his tongue.

"Lauel, even if your expectations are wrong, I don’t think the empire can break through if they come.”

“...I agree. Let’s go inside the building. It is time to change shifts with our lifelong friends whose fate and destiny intertwined with ours through all eternity, the evil eyes.”

“Okay.”

The magic power of the evil eyes wasn’t infinite, just like a human’s stamina isn’t infinite. Unlike the king, ordinary evil eyes could only free the power of their eyes for two hours a day.

Two hours was enough.

“H-Hiik!”

“S-Spare me!”

The power of the evil eyes made even the coldest assassins kneel down and beg.

The evil eyes took care of most of the assassin remnants in just half an hour and then switched back to the Overgeared members, who had enough rest.

The empire’s advance team was practically unable to do anything and collapsed.

“Kukukuk... You are decent. It is a power that is hard to be confined to the ‘framework’ of humans.”

“Hahaha... You didn’t buy people who are all talk.”

***

It was the 19th day since the 10 meritorious retainers left for the evil eyes village.

[Your understanding of the Ether Glasses is now at 100%!]

[The ‘Ether Glasses’ production method has been acquired.]

“Kukuku, it’s finally over.”

Grid, who was stuck in the smithy and wrestled with the glasses for 19 days, finally achieved his first task.

He had obtained the production method and could now convert the glasses into the form of armor such as a helmet, or face shield.

’Given that I can use it myself...’

A helmet was better than a face shield.

It was because a face shield and mask couldn’t be used together.

Grid had no intention of throwing away the best treasure, the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch which had been a great help during the Demon King Subjugation.

‘I need a helmet that is at least worth the value of Triple Layers. Okay, let’s combine the glasses and helmet.’

Grid decided to set the value to at least Triple Layers and used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Reconstruction skill to change the Ether Glasses. Then he suddenly remembered the White Tiger’s Breath.

‘The White Tiger Sword summons stone pillars. Then can I make a helmet that is as hard as a rock if I used the White Tiger’s Breath?’

There wasn’t the saying as dumb as a rock for nothing. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was a great opportunity to increase his defense if he made a helmet that was as hard as a rock.

‘...Um. Later, I’ll get one more Ether Diamond and insert the White Tiger’s Breath when making my own helmet.’

Four of the eight rewards that Grid obtained from the National Competition were the breaths of the sacred creatures.

Thanks to this, he had a total of one Red Phoenix’s Breath, one Blue Dragon’s Breath, one White Tiger’s Breath and two Black Tortoise’s Breath.

It wouldn’t be long until his weapons and armor contained the power of these sacred creatures.

‘Kukuku... Once I obtain pure ether, I will be the ultimately overgeared tower that looms above everyone, engulfing them within the shadow that I cast.’

Wouldn’t it be enough to fight against the empire?

“...?”

Grid felt a bit strange as he started modifying the item.

It felt like just yesterday when he was shaken by the ‘strong people of the era’ he encountered when visiting the empire and now he didn’t feel afraid.

Was he too puffed up?

No.

His impression of himself had risen thanks to that bastard Garam. He also became confident after his experience as the Demon King.

“Huehuehue...”

Grid thought about the power of the empire and checked the date.

It seemed the empire hadn’t invaded yet since there was no special communication from his colleagues in the evil eyes village. Thanks to this, Grid could focus on modifying the item.
