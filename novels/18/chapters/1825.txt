Chapter 1825

“Great one who showed me the difference between day and night. Today too, I started my day under the sunshine you gave me. I was able to understand the process of the birth of life through the dew on the fields of flowers of all colors.”

Poriorderporonopitonojiodebe—it was the name of the evil eyes’ king, which was long enough to be omitted due to the character limit. It contained many meanings. It was from the desire to be wise and virtuous like the head of a species. In conclusion, the evil eyes’ king lived up to his name.

He didn’t forget the grace of Grid, who opened his eyes. He emulated Grid and became a king who was kind to his subordinates. However, there was the disadvantage that he said too much when he greeted Grid. It made Grid feel embarrassed every time. It was especially so ever since Grid became a god.

“What are you talking about?”

The chibi species—Biban looked curiously at the evil eye, who was smaller and cuter than a dwarf. Then he cocked his head and frowned.

“He is just saying good morning,” Grid explained briefly before he responded to the evil eyes’ king with a smile, “Have you been well, my friend?”

“Of course. According to the logic of the world, I have to constantly go through new trials, but it is better than the past. Ever since you have broken the curse, my life has always been brilliant. I, who feels infinite gratitude and glory to have been called by you, walked the path you have laid out for me and have arrived safely before you.”

It is easy to live because I am no longer blind. I can walk while looking at the road.

Grid interpreted it roughly like this and nodded.

“I’m glad you are doing well. In any case, the reason why I called you is to borrow the power of the evil eye. Will you cooperate, my friend?”

The evil eye of the evil eyes’ king was particularly powerful. It shot rays infinitely and destroyed anything he saw. He was forced to close his eyes and live by ignoring everything precious to him. To the king of the evil eyes, the evil eye was nothing other than a curse.

Grid felt uncomfortable to ask him to open his eyes again.

“Of course.” The evil eyes’ king readily accepted. The reason he sealed the evil eye with the ether glasses. It was to lead a ‘daily life.’ This didn’t mean that he gave up his power.

The group moved locations. It was toward one of the most difficult hunting grounds near Reinhardt. It was a lake that was formed after the change in the world. Just like Titans’ Mirror Mountains, it replicated the image of a creature reflected on the surface of the water and produced illusionary bodies.

The basic stat of the illusionary bodies were so high that it was impossible for ordinary people to access this place. It was used as a top level hunting ground even for the Overgeared Guild.

Thanks to this, Grid and the evil eyes’ king stood facing each other in a deserted place. Grid armed himself with the dragon armor and siad, “I am ready. You can take off your glasses now.”

“Okay. Like the stars in the sky, countless fates disturb me as usual. According to your will, I will open the curse deep in my blood and soul and engrave it on the world.”

Words that didn’t suit his round and cute face—the sight of the evil eyes’ king answering with a serene expression thrilled Lauel.

At the same time...

Flash!

Beams of light shot from the large eyes of the evil eyes’ king, who had taken off his ether glasses. All the surrounding bushes couldn’t handle the waves and were uprooted. Large rocks also cracked.

[’Absolute Defense’ is activated. 50,000 mana is consumed per second.]

[You have become immune to the damage due to the effect of ‘Absolute Defense.’]

Apart from the loud impact, Grid wasn’t harmed at all. Biban also expressed his disappointment in the beginning.

‘It isn’t a big deal.’

It happened as Biban was thinking this...

Step.

A faint footstep was heard through the noises of the flashes of light. It was the sound of Grid taking a step back.

“......?!”

Why did he back off?

The puzzled Biban noticed one step late.

The rays of destruction coming from the eyes of the evil eyes’ king. This ‘pushing force’ was being replaced by enormous pressure. It was easy to think of water cannons. Water cannons firing nonstop.

Unlike most attack spells which were one shot, including the dragon’s Breath, the evil eyes’ rays had the advantage of being continuously shot. Everything around Grid was falling apart. It was why the evil eyes’ king had to live as a blind person in the past.

‘Of course, Absolute Defense isn’t perfect.’

Grid thought as he pulled out his sword while being hit by the destruction rays. It took him 0.1 seconds to draw his sword. It was several times slower than usual.

‘If Absolute Defense was almighty, I wouldn’t have been able to fight a dragon.’

There was nothing invincible in the world. Therefore, it was necessary to cooperate with each other...

[The activation of ‘Absolute Defense’ has stopped.]

In the Overgeared World, Grid could overcome many constraints. It was also possible to activate Absolute Defense forever with infinite mana. It was just like a dragon. However, his experiment testing out his theory couldn’t proceed properly like this, so Grid deactivated the Absolute Defense skill.

A change occurred immediately.

[You have suffered 1,290 damage.]

The destruction rays of the evil eyes’ king started to inflict damage on Grid.

[You have suffered 810 damage.]

[You have suffered 1,905 damage.]

[You have suffered 366 damage.]

[You have suffered 2,678 damage.]

The infinite number of hits meant damage was accumulated quickly. Grid’s magic resistance was so high that the individual damage was very low, but it wasn’t at a level that could be ignored. The speed at which the damage came was very fast. There were 5-8 hits per second and he had to take into account the occasional critical hits or weak spot attacks that occurred. In addition, each hit overlapped at a certain level and caused debuffs that weakened magic resistance. Grid was immune, but...

In any case, it wasn’t the damage that mattered. There was something else that Grid paid attention to regarding the evil eye of the evil eyes’ king.

“What do you think? I think the light and heat of these rays will narrow the view of the ‘head’ a little bit.”

“Um... I agree. On top of that, it could disrupt its hearing.”

The destruction rays were accompanied by bright light, heat, and tremendous noise. It meant it could interfere with what Asura’s head could see and hear. Of course, there were many magics and skills in the world that could improve the subject’s sight and hearing. However, it couldn’t be triggered non-stop like the rays of destruction.

“Theoretically, it is also possible to make it unable to speak. A beam of light can be shot into its mouth.”

In fact, Grid’s voice was actually trembling. It was because his organs, including his vocal cords, were constantly shaking under the pressure of the rays. If the beam was focused and aimed at Grid’s mouth, the pressure would’ve made it difficult for him to open his mouth.

“Certainly...”

Asura’s head exerted a great power through seeing, hearing, and speaking. The evil eye of the evil eyes’ king had the extraordinary power to keep him in check.

Biban was convinced.

“It is good. Then put on your glasses. You’ve worked hard.”

The rays of destruction, which had been fired with a continuous roar, stopped. The evil eyes’ king put on the ether glasses he had taken off and looked relieved. It was due to the fact that he unleashed his suppressed power to his heart’s content.

‘Is it similar to the feeling when you hold back from peeing and then release it?’

Biban asked Grid, who had a fairly rude thought, “I understand that his evil eye is worth it. But how are you going to use it? There seems to be a huge flaw in his physical abilities.”

The evil eyes species were one of the most powerful among the demonic species. It was purely thanks to the evil eyes. The evil eyes species without the evil eyes? They were like children. They would perhaps be weaker than a human child. Their body balance was so bad that they couldn’t move their body properly. They couldn’t even do a simple run properly.

“I’ve also heard that Asura’s body parts can’t handle the power of a dragon weapon, but that is because the dragon weapon you make is so powerful. It isn’t that Asura is weak. Its physical abilities are close to a transcendent, even though it is divided into parts.”

No matter how powerful the rays of the evil eyes’ king, it was meaningless if they didn’t last. The moment he shot a ray of light, the evil eyes’ king would be immediately targeted by his enemies and was likely to be killed in an instant. No matter how he thought about it, there were many practical problems with the use of the evil eye of the evil eyes’ king.

The evil eyes’ king also looked anxious. He imagined his head falling off the moment he arrived in hell and took off his glasses.

“Will the effect of the evil eyes be maintained if you pull out the eyeballs?”

Biban pondered on it for a while before saying ridiculous nonsense. The face of the evil eyes’ king turned pale and Grid frowned.

“Pull out the eyeballs of a precious friend? Please refrain from saying such terrible things.”

“A precious friend? Um... I was joking.”

“You are still mischievous. Wait.”

Grid took out a portable furnace, anvil, and hammer, and started to make something. It was a handle. It looked exactly like the handle of the dragon shield he made for Vantner a while ago.

“......?”

Under the gazes of the puzzled people, Grid strode over to the evil eyes’ king and put a handle on the collar of the evil eyes’ king.

“......??”

People’s doubts grew. The king of the evil eyes was suddenly lifted up by the handle and was particularly flustered and confused. Grid held him in one hand and moved him in various poses. Soon after, he started to explain. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I have a friend named Vantner who uses shields very well. He is so skilled that he can even use two shields...”

“......?”

“......??”

People started to have doubts the moment the explanation began. Lauel was the only one who noticed something and quietly looked away as Grid’s words continued. “I will tell him to use you as a shield.”

“...What?”

“The evil eyes’ king, as you can see. Jiode, my friend, you just need to keep your eyes open. Vantner will take care of aiming. Ah, he will naturally protect you as well.”

“......”

There was a moment of silence. Everyone stared blankly at Grid, who was talking crazy with a normal expression.

“Wielding him as a shield in the middle of hell... I think it would be less harsh to just to pull out his eyeballs.”

Biban soon came to his senses and clicked his tongue.

“I apologize...” the evil eyes’ king opened his mouth, “...Jiodebe. That is my name.”

He couldn’t bear to refuse the daunting task he had been given. He indirectly expressed his disappointment by saying, ‘Please correct my name at least.’

“In the future, I will call you Jio comfortably. Isn’t that closer to each other?”

“......”

The evil eyes’ king had a lot to say but he swallowed down all the words. The favor he owed to Grid was too great. He didn’t dare go against Grid.

“Do as you please...”

Finally, the king of the evil eyes nodded. This was the end. It was decided that the means to oppose the head of Asura was the evil eyes’ king.
