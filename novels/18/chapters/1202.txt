300,000 Army Swordsmanship Stealth Sword—the upgraded version of 200,000 Army Swordsmanship that was opened when Open Potential was used—was a surprise attack but it had a fatal drawback. It was that it was impossible to recover sword energy for three seconds after use. However, the high damage, the ‘expose weaknesses’ effect, the critical hit damage, and the ‘must hit’ effect meant it could be called the ultimate technique.

“Divinity. Open Potential.”

Stealth Sword meant he succeeded in hitting the yangbans. The veins on his neck bulged as he leaned forward. It was the recoil caused by continuously using Open Potential. Since an extreme penalty was specified, the burden of Open Potential on the user was heavy. It consumed 10,000 mana, 20,000 health, and half his current stamina, as well as causing injuries by increasing the burden on the body. Once Open Potential and the five fused sword dances were used, Grid was in danger of losing his mind.

“Gulp!”

Grid gulped while enduring the pain. Fear struck him but there was no hesitation. His hair rose due to Transcend and his eyes were as strong as ever. “Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.”

[Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle]

[Five sword dances have been sublimated into a single field.

An energy sword that deals 5000% physical attack damage will be fired seven times in one second, causing waves of sword energy to cover all enemies within a range of 10 meters.

Targets hit by the sword energy are ‘disarmed’ and will suffer from the ‘bleeding’ and ‘despair’ abnormal conditions.

All sword energies will ignore 70% of the target’s defense.

★ The effect of Detect Force, Wind Cutter, Shield, and Weapon Enchant will be applied.

Skill Usage Conditions: Have a sword type weapon equipped.

Skill Sword Energy Cost: 500.

Skill Cooldown Time: 2 hours.]

The yangban ‘Saul’ was hit by Stealth Sword and after that, his body swayed indefinitely as he was hit by the merciless sword technique. Saul’s mind was dazed. ‘Now... what am I going through right now?’

As expected, the enemy invasion occurred and half of the ego of the black tortoise was resurrected. However, the yangbans felt the need to disperse the attention of the monster who kept roaring at the sky. Then they found a human who wasn’t on the list. They struck at him because they didn’t think he was necessary. It was like killing an annoying fly.

The enemy’s neck filled their field of view and they let their swords fly. They remembered up to there. However, it was impossible to recall what happened afterwards.

“Cough!” The pupils of Saul shook as he coughed up blood. He had no idea what he was going through. He instinctively operated the breaths of the Four Gods to overcome the pain that he was experiencing for the first time in his life.

“Saul!” Then he heard the voice of his brother behind him. It was desperate in an unseemly manner.

‘We... are gods.’

They needed to remain calm in all circumstances. They had to walk leisurely even through heavy rains and snowstorms. So stop shouting so desperately.

Saul’s wish was in vain as the other yangbans desperately reached out to him. However, they couldn’t protect Saul. It was because the sword energy that had penetrated Saul exploded in unison and stretched out like waves, striking the yangbans. It was a powerful attack that couldn’t be ignored.

“Keuk!”

The two yangbans hurriedly protected themselves from the waves of sword energy but Saul was swept away unprotected. Saul’s limbs started to be torn apart.

“...Ah.”

It wasn’t until he couldn’t even feel pain that he finally realized the situation. Death. A concept that he felt was far away was coming over himself.

“I don’t want...”

Death didn’t allow him to even protest. It snatched him ferociously and without mercy.

“......”

After the waves of sword energy, silence came.

The surviving yangbans needed time to accept the death of Saul. They remembered Saul’s smile as he approached them, who were eliminated and feeling frustrated by the final stage of Chiyou’s test, and reached out. Next, they were reminded of when the three of them shouted that they would pass Chiyou’s test. They gained courage and overcame the setbacks.

“Now finally... finally, one of the seven spots are vacant and we have a chance...”

They were on the verge of gaining divine qualifications. Yet they were going to die?

“You!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The eyes of the tired yangbans were drawn to the gasping Grid. For the first time since birth, the yangbans felt hatred and desperation. They activated the Blue Dragon’s Breath and were engulfed in lightning as they rushed toward Grid. Grid couldn’t respond. He stood with his back bent like a hunchback and his arms hung down in a dazed manner.

Shake shake.

To be honest, it was hard to hold his sword. Open Potential, 300,000 Army Swordsmanship, the five fused sword dances...

It was the aftermath of successively using techniques that the human body couldn’t handle. Grid’s muscles twitched and his stamina was on the verge of being fully depleted.

“Die!”

Was it because killing intent was projected? There was a red glow at the end of the yangban’s swords. The color seemed to hint at the blood that Grid would soon shed.

‘Shit.’

He couldn’t react even if he saw the attack with his eyes. Grid was upset but he tried to control his mind. It wasn’t over yet.

‘I can hold on.’

The recovery and shield skills generated by his titles and item effects remained. If he was lucky enough to trigger a skill to nullify the damage, the yangbans’ attacks would last for 4~5 seconds.

‘These guys aren’t at the level of Garam but they’re consistent with Hangyeol.’

“Ugh!”

Grid’s back and chest were pierced and he threw up blood. He gritted his teeth and moved his eyes in every direction. It was to find a path to retreat. He planned to immediately escape the moment his stamina recovered and he could move a bit more. Of course, it wasn’t that easy. The yangbans were clearly aware of Grid’s intentions. They had no intention of opening a path for the man who dared fight and kill a yangban.

“You can’t live!”

The offensive of the yangbans became more intense. They noticed that Grid’s condition was different from before and pushed Grid with full force, launching dozens of attacks per second. It was a fast and tenacious attack that made any viewers tired. However, it was impossible for them to force Grid into the immortal state in five seconds.

[You have suffered 6,599 damage.]

[You have suffered 7,105 damage.]

[The effect of Gaiters of the White Tiger supporting Heaven and Earth has ignored the damage.]

[You have suffered 7,750 damage.]

[You have suffered 8,300 damage.]

[The effect of Shoulder Guards of the White Tiger with the Protection of the Red Phoenix has ignored the damage.]

[The effect of Arrogant Blue Dragon’s Boots has ignored the damage.]

It was because he was overgeared. The attacks of the yangbans became stronger because they were linked. They quickly got rid of Grid’s shields and recovery skills and Grid was forced to endure using the armor made from the breaths of the Four Auspicious Beasts. The shoulder guards, gaiters, and boots had a probability of nullifying damage and Grid was somehow able to endure.

“You?”

The heads of the yangbans were boiling but Grid didn’t laugh. Grid’s face was dark.

‘Not yet?’

The burden on Grid’s body was too great. Five seconds had passed and his body might’ve recovered the minimum physical strength needed for activities but his body didn’t move properly. All his joints creaked and his muscles twitched.

‘It was crazy to use Open Potential continuously...’

He had expected it and tried to restrain himself as much as possible. However, this time he couldn’t afford to hold back his strength.

‘In this case, I will bet everything on my immortal state.’

Five seconds. He had to somehow survive in five seconds. Grid was determined as he silently watched the two soft swords wrapped around his neck. He accepted the inevitable situation. Just then, the two swords around Grid’s neck were suddenly released and returned in the direction of their masters. The master of the swords, the body of a yangban, was floating in the air.

“...?”

“...?”

Both Grid and the yangbans’ eyes were wide. Grid’s eyes met the eyes of the man holding the waists of the yangbans in the air. The identity of the man was Bubat. The strongest initiator of this era who was specialized in capturing the target. He boasted an irresistible crowd control and even managed to throw Grid to the ground in his prime. This time, he helped Grid by slamming the yangbans to the ground. The legs of the yangbans aimed at the sky as their heads touched the ground.

Bubat yelled at Grid who was staring at the scene. “Damn! What are you doing? Quickly run!”

“...!”

Grid came to his senses. Sensation was coming back at his fingertips.

“Shunpo.”

At this moment, Grid’s eyes weren’t looking for a retreat path. Grid glanced at Bubat’s side and appeared by Bubat’s side.

“...!”

The flustered Bubat was stunned when Grid suddenly appeared in front of him. Grid’s mind recalled the conversation from two years ago.

“Grid, I won’t challenge you again.”

These were Bubat’s words when he was defeated by the Chinese ranker whose name couldn’t be remembered anymore. At that time, Bubat had realized his limitations. It was the limit of a one-on-one confrontation. That’s right—the essence of an initiator came from party play. It made Bubat many times more powerful than when he was alone.

“...If we meet again in a war.”

“I told you that I hoped that we were no longer enemies at that time.”

The two men recalled the same day. They smiled as they remembered the words they said to each other. Bubat’s big hands clutched the ankles of the yangbans lying on the ground.

“Transcended Link Flower.”

Grid tried to do the best he could.

“Linked Kill Flower Pinnacle.”

In the dark world, the blue-black petals illuminated Grid and Bubat. In the eyes of the rankers, they looked happy. They felt ashamed that they were so obsessed with this unknown quest.

It was the unexpected emergence of the black tortoise that had changed the situation.
