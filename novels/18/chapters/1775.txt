Chapter 1775

For Evil Dragon Bunhelier, the front leg was more like a vestigial organ. It was very small among his body parts and couldn’t be used efficiently. In the book secretly written by Peak Sword, it was described as ‘an ostrich’s body with chicken wings.’ It was through the mouth of the protagonist who resembled Damian for some reason.

On the other hand, Nevartan and Trauka had a complete physical balance. Their front legs hadn’t degenerated and were as useful as human hands. They were big. It was at a level when quadrupedal walking was possible, even if it was inferior compared to the hind legs that always supported their huge bodies.

“......”

Braham left after causing a commotion.

In the center of the world where the lines of the epic beautifully praised the cooperation between Grid and Marie Rose, and the sacrifices of Hayate and Biban—Grid stared blankly at a corner of the high, red wall. It was Trauka’s arm. The arm of an old dragon, filled with scales several meters in size. It looked like a treasure trove to Grid. It could be made into thousands of dragon weapons and armor.

All sorts of inspiration filled his mind. Twilight being paired with Dawn was just the basics. In the past few years, Grid had developed and produced all sorts of battle gear for his colleagues. It was all from learning. The learning that he never would’ve gained if he had been alone like Pagma was an infinite source of inspiration.

‘I have to prove that my learning and experience weren’t in vain. It is by developing different dragon weapons and armor.’

Only a few people needed ‘better than before’ dragon weapons and armor. They were himself, Hayate, and the apostles. In the first place, no one other than them could handle the dragon weapons and armor. Therefore, he needed ‘unconventional’ dragon weapons and armor. This way, the Overgeared Guild members and tower members could also use them.

‘It isn’t a matter of discussing whether it is possible or impossible. It must be done.’

Trauka’s gift also foreshadowed a difficult future ahead. There was room to interpret that at least this much power would be needed to move ahead in the future.

“......”

Grid made a serious decision and reached out his hand. It was to support Marie Rose, whose legs weakened and whose breathing gradually deepened like a person who had fallen asleep.

He questioned it. How did this slender woman manage to face Trauka alone? Her stats that he peeked at through the cooperative sword dance weren’t as great as Grid thought. Her intelligence was slightly higher than Grid’s and her stamina was 4,500 higher. Even her strength and agility, which were approximately double his, was a bit over 20,000.

On the other hand, Trauka’s important stats were likely to be 99,999. On the assumption that he was weakened, his stats would still be several times more powerful than Marie Rose’s. Yet Marie Rose held out alone against Trauka. She didn’t back down until Grid got here. It must’ve been a huge ordeal.

Grid felt her great sincerity again. He realized that Marie Rose’s feelings toward him were never light.

“I’m glad to receive your marriage proposal.” Marie Rose laughed softly. She forcibly lifted her heavy eyelids and feigned relaxation. “However, marriage isn’t something that can be done hastily. Wait until I’m fully prepared and come to greet you.”

Marie Rose didn’t wait for Grid’s answer. She immediately dispersed into fog and left the scene. It was her consideration. She fully understood that Grid lived in this world and had a lot of work to do.

“...The cooldown time of blood-sucking must be longer than I thought,” Grid muttered when he was left alone, and touched his lips.

The passive effect of ‘Blood King’ was to temporarily overcome the curse on the vampires. Nevertheless, Marie Rose was affected by the Curse of Sloth. It seemed that the physical strength consumed was really great. At this time, it was right to suck Grid’s blood and seek rapid recovery. However, she just left. It proved that her blood-sucking ability wasn’t omnipotent.

“How is Hayate?”

Grid was relieved of his regret and approached the place where his colleagues were gathered. Fortunately, Hayate had almost recovered from his injuries. Most of the bones and flesh that had melted due to the Fire Dragon’s Breath regained their intact appearance.

It was as Grid expected. Grid believed that Hayate wouldn’t die as long as the Saintess was here.

However, Ruby’s expression was surprisingly dark. “Hayate is fine. But... but...”

“......?”

Grid followed Ruby’s shaky gaze. He saw Biban sleeping as if he was dead. He looked fine without any injuries. It was hard to think of him as an injured person. In fact, he hadn’t received any hits from Trauka. Then what did Ruby’s response mean?

Grid was feeling puzzled when he recalled some phrases from the epic. Dragon Slayer Hayate burned himself to slash the Fire Dragon’s Breath, while Sword Saint Biban forged himself into a flawless sword to extinguish the remnants of the flames...

So far, Grid had personally witnessed it. However, the epic’s intention behind dressing up their performance as a ‘sacrifice’ was difficult for even Grid to understand. Why was it a sacrifice?

“...Did he consume the Origin True Energy?”

Grid’s expression crumpled as he belatedly realized the situation. Running all the way here to Trauka’s lair, all he could think of was despair.

The worldview that would change rapidly due to Marie Rose’s death.

Him being unable to prevent her death and dying after her.

The tower members who joined despite there being no rewards and ended up annihilated.

Grid imagined the worst case scenario in which Baal destroyed the rapidly weakened surface.

The Trauka he encountered in Reidan was that powerful. Fortunately, he had won. It all ended well. That was what he thought...

“Biban. Hey, Biban?”

The tower members surrounding Biban stepped back. Grid sat next to Biban and worked hard to smile.

“Did you have another accident? Is it because you don’t want to clean the bathroom?”

“......”

There was no answer. Biban, who should’ve become angry the moment he heard the word ‘cleaning,’ was silent without any reaction. His tightly closed mouth and eyes pushed Grid into the depths of despair.

“There are no signs of trauma at all. There are no internal injuries, much less curses,” Ruby’s voice trembled as she spoke. She seemed very confused.

“Strange... nothing happens no matter what type of recovery magic I use. Sorry... I’m sorry...” Ruby knew that Biban was a valuable bond for Grid. Ever since the existence of the Tower of Wisdom became known to the world, Grid would often happily share stories about Biban in front of his sister.

“Sehee, come here.” Jishuka soothed the distressed Ruby. She held Sehee’s small body in her arms and patted her back several times.

The fighter, Ken, spoke in the atmosphere that was becoming increasingly heavy, “Biban wanted to be a sword.”

The will of the Sword Saint—an unbreakable sword that could cut anything.

“In the end, he really became a sword. He is a stupid human being.”

Ken was a straightforward person. He was honest, so he connected the best with the pure Biban. Therefore, he understood Biban’s condition better than anyone else.

“...What should I do?”

A Sword Saint falling into a vegetative state? It shouldn’t be like this.

Hayate calmed down the anxious Grid. “There are too many eyes here. It is better to move before people notice anything unusual.”

To the tower members, their colleagues were as precious as themselves. Their colleagues were everything to them, who had left the world. Thus, Grid couldn’t stop Hayate from picking up and carrying Biban on his back with his unhealthy body.

The group soon split into two. Grid and the tower members headed to the Tower of Wisdom, while Jishuka and the members of Overgeared restored the scene and returned to Reinhardt. Unexpected events were already occurring in various parts of the world, which had changed in the aftermath of Grid liberating his power. The future schedule of the members of the Overgeared Guild was bound to be very busy.

***

“Why are you only saying that now?”

Biban’s vivid voice resonated through Grid’s mind as he recalled old memories.

He realized it all over again. Biban had helped him so much. He was Grid’s mentor and friend.

‘Please.’

Grid knew how many people had helped him get to where he was now. There was too much grace that he had to repay someday.

‘Please be safe, at least until I pay off my debts.’

It was while looking at Biban who was on Hayate’s back.

It happened as Grid was feeling desperate...

[Arrogant one. Do you think you can survive after provoking me?]

The thought of a being that was forced into his mind—it was a very large and powerful being that seemed to be qualified to move the world as it wished. The eyes of Grid and the tower members shifted upwards.

A glow different from sunlight was leaking through the thick clouds. It was dark gold compared to Grid’s divinity that colored one axis of the sky. The brilliance combined into a huge pillar and fell. It was a Breath that cut the sky in half and aimed precisely at Hayate.

The tower members gripped their weapons and came out to defend against it.

“Grid! You finally called me!”

Just then, the Transcendent Dragon Nefelina arrived at the scene. She responded to Grid’s will.

[The effect of the Only One title in the world, ‘Dragon Knight,’ will be activated.]

The sword wielded by Grid as he stepped on Nefelina’s back split the Breath in half. Fragments of light that flew in all directions mixed with Grid’s divinity and disappeared.

[You...! Don’t disturb me!]

The shadow that emerged beyond the clouds. It was a huge dragon. It was a gold dragon called Kubartos. He was an existence with a majesty comparable to Cloaked Dragon Cranbel. His dark green eyes flashed.

[It is that arrogant Dragon Slayer who awakened me. It is right for him to pay the price.]

Hayate revealed his presence to the world. It was to induce the dragon’s killing intent to naturally be directed toward him, and to identify Trauka’s killing intent mixed in this and determine his location. The resulting aftermath came in the form of the top-grade dragon Kubartos.

He howled ferociously. Then Grid, who was on the same eye level as him before he knew it, asked while using Item Combination, “Are you above Trauka?”

[Only One God Grid...]

Kubartos belatedly noticed Grid’s true identity and closed his mouth. He even flapped his wings while suppressing Dragon Fear and Dragon Rage.

[...This time, I will look at the face of an old dragon and back off.]

It was shortly after the epic was written. Even the epic didn’t dare to undermine Trauka’s status, but it did state clearly that Trauka bowed to Grid and apologized. He felt reluctant to oppose Grid with the hierarchy of a top dragon. In the end, Kubartos left the scene and the group was able to safely arrive at the Tower of Wisdom.

Grid made another pledge as he got off Nefelina’s back and followed after Biban, who was being moved to a hospital room. ‘I must arm the tower members with dragon weapons and armor no matter what.’

It was so that some dragons wouldn’t even dare to cross the tower members. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“...By the way.” Grid’s footsteps suddenly stopped. It was because he felt the presence of the human figure attached to Nefelina’s stomach, wriggling and rising up. It was Sword Saint Muller. “How are you here...?”

What? Did he grab onto Nefelina when she teleported? Was that possible?

Muller noticed the gazes of the confused Grid and the agitated tower members and politely explained, “I forced her to take me when I heard about the condition of Sir Biban. I thought I might be of help.”

A sword knew the heart of a sword the best.

The end of Biban, which had been prophesied by his enemy some time ago in hell, was destined to be reversed from the time that Muller, who was thought to be dead, returned to the world of the surface.
