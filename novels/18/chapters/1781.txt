Chapter 1781

The form of a weapon changed according to its use. The dragon weapons that Grid would create in the future didn’t have to be a sword. It was because the situation was completely different from when he only had limited materials to use.

‘I’ll replace all my secondary weapons with dragon weapons.’

Grid was placed in a blessed environment. It was thanks to his colleagues, who could handle different weapons to the extreme. All of the data they accumulated through their blood and sweat, which could form a river, was provided to Grid. Thanks to this, Grid was able to master all types of weapons. In other words, he had reached the peak when it came to using and producing them.

‘The materials are overflowing. Don’t be afraid of failure and make new weapons every day.’

The subjugation of Baal was postponed. He would proceed after he armed the top forces of the Overgeared Guild with dragon weapons and armor. The odds would rise by leaps and bounds. Perhaps he could repeatedly kill Baal until his infinite lives were cut off...

‘This is as long as Asura isn’t a big variable.’

Only one hand—Asura showed off a tremendous presence with just one part of his body. Every time Baal wielded his ominous power, the Overgeared Guild and the apostles were in great danger. Baal’s foolish desire to create an evil god with his own hands gave birth to a monster that had never existed before.

“Really... Is this the end?” Irene’s voice awakened Grid from his thoughts. Her face was filled with regret as she exhaled. It was because Grid didn’t give her enough affection. It ended with a gentle kiss and caress of her body. She felt a warm love, but no passion. It was very different from Irene’s expectations.

“I heard you stopped by Titan before you returned here in triumph.”

Irene had been waiting for tonight for three months. Of course, it took Grid a month to regain his energy, but it took a long time because he shared energy with Mercedes and Basara. For Irene, who was full of energy after building up her divinity and honing her swordsmanship, the three months of solo battle was a tremendous struggle. In other words, she couldn’t condone cutting in line. It was a matter of promise and trust.

“Um...? Gasp, don’t get me wrong. I only discussed Reidan’s defense with Basara. I didn’t even look in the direction of her bedroom.”

“Why did you discuss Reidan’s defense with her? Reidan isn’t the territory of Queen Basara’s rule.”

“No, well... I wanted to get some advice and have a chat... I’m sorry that I can’t take care of you often...”

Grid couldn’t lie to Irene. It had been like that all along.

A smile gradually spread across Irene’s stiff face as she stared at Grid, who was honestly confessing. “I see. That’s great. I love all aspects of Your Majesty, but the way your care for your family is my third favorite thing about you. But this time, I have no choice but to suspect it. Today is the day of an important appointment, but you left me alone.”

“That... the daoist immortal said that if I want to have children, I need to accumulate as much energy as possible...”

Grid concluded from the testimonies of Eve and the liches that there was no need to doubt the daoist immortal Yeo Yulan. Thus, she was released from prison. Lauel invited her, who had accumulated a lot of knowledge as a daoist immortal, to be an honored guest of Reinhardt. Then he bombarded her with questions.

That’s right—one of the questions he asked was the issue of Grid having children. It was disclosed to someone who didn’t even know that Grid might have a physical problem... Lauel believed that Grid should have more children to benefit the nation, so Grid’s shame wasn’t the important issue.

In any case, it was as Yeo Yulan said. Grid’s seed was so powerful that it was being protected by providence. She made a pseudo-religious argument that the principles and laws that governed the natural world valued Grid’s seeds and were controlling them to prevent excessive fertility.

“If a child with incomplete energy is born... it is said that the child born as a half-god will be inferior compared to me. To prevent problems that will arise at that time, the world itself is interfering with our plan for a second child.”

If Grid’s child didn’t inherit Grid’s talent, it would be a very serious problem. The child would be an easy target for enemies who hated Grid. It meant that simply existing would cause endless aggression and war.

In that sense, Lord was very pleasing. Due to his constant efforts, he was showing a fast growth rate similar to Grid in his human days. The enemy couldn’t easily target him. The advantage was that it was easy to predict Lord’s radius of activity because he followed the path that Grid originally walked. It was possible for the empire to block the risks and variables that could aim for Lord in advance.

“...It is a completely unreliable argument, but I want to save my energy with the feeling of grasping at straws.”

Irene asked, “I... see... how long?”

“It might be difficult, but around a year...?”

“One year...”

Irene’s green eyes shook wildly before gradually losing their light. There was shock followed by frustration. It was a more intense reaction than Grid expected.

Grid’s resolve started to falter and he said urgently, “I won’t let you be lonely. I will often comfort you with these two hands that I have been honing. If that is not enough, I’ll hug you at any time. Is there high demand for a child? You are more important.”

“No.” Irene came back to her senses and her eyes no longer wavered. But her slightly wet eyes were strangely charming. It reminded him of Marie Rose. “One year of waiting will give us a more valuable day. I will take care of the lonely people and soothe them, so don’t worry about it and save your energy well.”

“U-Um...”

What?

Grid nodded while wondering something. It was because Irene was excited in a way he had never seen before. She seemed to be trying not to show it, but her breathing was rough. He felt like a rat in front of a beast.

“...By the way. If your third favorite thing about me is the way I care for my family, what is your favorite and second favorite?”

“That... it is a secret.”

“......”

The night deepened amidst various questions. It wasn’t until Grid saw that Irene had calmed down and fallen fast asleep that he got out of bed.

The destination was naturally the smithy. It was a smithy as huge as a castle. It was a size that could accommodate a super large furnace. There was also a mountain of white phosphorus wood. All the supplies were ready without the need for Grid to do anything. The expanded smithy and super large furnace were the work of Ke ong and the architects, while the piles of white phosphorus wood were brought directly by God Red Phoenix.

[The smelting of the body part of an old dragon. Normal flames won’t work, so I will stay by your side and help you.]

The Red Phoenix had a very special relationship with Grid. It had already done Grid a big favor by giving its heart to Grid. Putting aside its cold eyes where no emotions could be read, its attitude toward Grid was endlessly warm.

“Red Phoenix, don’t you have to protect the Cho Kingdom? If the Hwan Kingdom notices your absence...”

[Half of the Cho Kingdom has been incorporated into the Overgeared World. It is actually your territory, so the expelled gods can’t easily enter it.] ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I’m glad...”

[It is purely a result you made.]

“......”

Every time he heard something like this, Grid’s heart swelled. He felt it was worth working hard. He felt like his exhausted body and mind were being restored one after another thanks to Irene and the Red Phoenix.

Grid had a big smile on his face as he put Trauka’s arm into the super large furnace that had been heated up with the help of the Red Phoenix. It was slowly and carefully.

In the first place, it was impossible to put the whole thing in. It was because Trauka’s arm was so huge. He planned to melt it starting from the hand. First, separate the six claws and leave them to produce accessories...

Numerous presences were felt outside the smithy. They were Lord and the blacksmiths.

A dragon—they wanted to witness and learn from the historic moment of making battle gear from an Absolute creature they didn’t dare to touch. There were signs of a large crowd gathering despite the late hour, but the knights controlled it. It was due to Grid’s warning that it could be dangerous.

In fact, all the apostles except Braham were present around the smithy, along with Euphemina, Tower Master Laella, Vantner, and Damian. It was to prepare for a situation where the smithy would explode. The apostles created a barrier to prevent the aftermath of the explosion from reaching outside the smithy and the Overgeared members prepared defensive skills.

It happened when the sheer firepower wanted to cause a crack in Trauka’s hand in the furnace...

Flash!

The super large furnace turned red. It was due to the rapid rise in temperature as the heat from the cracked scales of the Fire Dragon combined with the flames of the Red Phoenix.

[This is a material that can’t be smelted with your skills.]

‘It is ruined...’

Grid had the worst case scenario in mind. Then eventually, the furnace exploded because it couldn’t handle the heat.

“......!!”

The barrier created by the apostles shook noisily and people screamed. Fortunately, the aftermath of the explosion didn’t reach outside the smithy. Right before the barrier created by the apostles was breached, Vantner and Damian—supported by Euphemina and Laella’s magic—stopped the flames with their bodies. Thanks to this, the huge waves of flames didn’t reach the city and soared high into the sky. The sight resembled the Breath of Fire Dragon Trauka.

“......”

It was still too early for dawn, but the night receded. The remnants of flames that evaporated all the clouds were acting as an artificial sun.

An unexpected voice entered Grid’s ears as he was alternating looking between Trauka’s regenerated arm and the red sky. “I expected it, but it turned out like this.”

“You?”

Mercedes was already approaching Grid. The target of the sword she pulled out was an old man that was still weighed down by the weight of the years despite achieving transcendence.

“Great Robber of the Red Night...”

Grid realized it again—the years that the old man in front of him had endured. Maybe it was comparable or more than Hayate?

“How did you sneak in?” Sariel’s cold voice cooled down the scene that was engulfed in flames. Her voice was trembling with agitation. She felt a great deal of shame and guilt for allowing an outsider to invade. It was natural. Unlike the other apostles, Sariel was in a position where her activities were restricted. She was forced to take on the role of defending Reinhardt, but she couldn’t even do it properly.

“He isn’t an opponent where you should feel ashamed about this.”

It happened when Zik was giving comfort that wasn’t really comfort...

“How can you be so arrogant about smelting the body of an old dragon when you aren’t even the God of Blacksmithing?” the Great Robber of the Red Night asked Grid.

It was close to criticism. Mercedes’ face contorted in a terrifying manner, but Grid was enlightened.

‘I was too proud.’

It was an unmistakable remark. His origin was a blacksmith, but ultimately, he wasn’t a blacksmith. He still mistook himself for being the best blacksmith. Looking back, he had never surpassed Hexetia.

“It is different from Bunhelier’s fang, which has long been separated from the main body and lost its vitality. This still vividly has the energy of the old dragon. Yet you are being careless in the middle of the city... you are too overconfident in yourself. You are unable to grasp the subject even after winning due to receiving a lot of help?”

It was just as Mercedes’ sword was about to strike.

“What do you want to say?”

Grid stopped Mercedes and got to the point.

The Great Robber of the Red Night—so far, he had never appeared for no reason. It was the same again this time.

“It is time to go up.” The old man’s wrinkled fingers pointed to the sky. “Carry me to the sky. Then I’ll steal the blacksmithing god for you.”

A smile spread across his dark-skinned face. It was filled with such deep meaning that it almost reminded him of Baal’s smile.

“Isn’t it a good deal for both of us? You can borrow Hexetia’s power, and I can steal a god and fulfill my will.”

“The attitude he shows toward Your Majesty shows that he is unlearned. He isn’t a trustworthy person,” Mercedes expressed her opinion.

She was lucky to have been taught by Muller. If it had been before she met Muller, she would’ve struck with her longsword without giving Grid a chance to stop her.

‘She has every reason to be sensitive.’

The day before, Grid had struggled to appease Mercedes. She was sad and looked depressed because she wasn’t called at every important moment.

‘In any case, the Great Robber of the Red Night is a good person who can be trusted.’

Grid remembered the battle Sariel fought with the Great Robber of the Red Night when she was Drasion. He saved countless lives with the skill called ‘Stealing the Country.’ He also knew why the robber retrieved Hexetia’s Short Sword. It was consideration so that Grid wouldn’t become the target of the gods. Additionally, he had helped Biban during the crisis in hell. He might’ve used the justification of achieving his own goal, but...

‘He is a good person despite his cranky disposition.’

The robber was also remarkably good at keeping his promises. At the time when he took Hexetia’s Short Sword, he obediently returned Nevartan’s Necklace in agreement with what he said.

In the end—

“Are you really able to rescue Hexetia?”

“I don’t know about rescue, but if it is stealing, then yes.”

This answer was enough. The old man in front of him was a monster who managed to rob the Tower of Wisdom. In this field, he was several levels above an old dragon.

Grid decided to accept the deal. It was necessary to change the order of work so that Traukaa’s arm wouldn’t become rotten, after he worked so hard to obtain it.

‘I would rather not make plans for the future.’

Grid felt skeptical about a situation that seemed to go differently than planned every time.
