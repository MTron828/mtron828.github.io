Chapter 1911

I am just doing what I believe is right...

The dragon, who was one head bigger than his kin, landed on the battlefield with these meaningful words.

He stood facing Kubartos. He placed the humans behind him. It felt like the wall of an ancient castle that had stood steadfast for a thousand years was rising in the middle of the battlefield.

Cranbel was such an existence. He also had a history of providing some comfort to Only One God Grid on several occasions.

Some of the dragons flinched. They felt a significant pressure. However, Kubartos remained calm. Like Cranbel, he also reigned like a wall.

The confrontation between silver and gold—they seemed to naturally be at odds with each other.

“What is this? Are you really going to stand on our side?” Vantner muttered in a dumbfounded manner. He repeatedly clenched and opened his hands. He could feel strength boiling up.

It seemed like Cranbel’s Dragon Words had increased his stats by close to 50%. It was an unrealistic rise. He couldn’t receive this much of a buff even if the Saintess’ grandfather came, let alone the Saintess.

“Dragon Words... it is said to be tempered through the fulfillment of the covenant.” Lauel opened his mouth. “It is a good basis for trusting Cloaked Dragon Cranbel. We have an obligation to repay him with victory.”

Cranbel’s Dragon Words discussed the strength of human beings.

They had to prove that they truly were strong. They had to win. Otherwise, Cranbell would suffer huge losses. They could lose this dragon that might perhaps be their only ally.

“Honestly, I don’t really understand this situation... in the end, this is God Grid’s arrangement, right? Okay, let’s do a proper sword dance today.”

Grid, how many moves ahead are you looking...?

Peak Sword arbitrarily misunderstood and admired it. Then his upper body tilted significantly. It was the posture of drawing the sword.

Immediately afterwards, the scales of Cranbel and Kubartos noisily reflected the light. It was the aftermath of the sword light shot by Peak Sword penetrating through their gaps.

One particularly small and low-grade dragon flinched. The faint sword mark on its neck gave hope to some of the Overgeared members.

‘The attack works.’

An Absolute—an existence designed to not be killed by a player. During the time when the world had been destroyed and recreated several times, Hayate was the only human to hunt dragons. They had been recognized as beings who couldn’t be confronted.

However, Peak Sword’s attack worked. It was great news.

“Tsk.” In fact, Peak Sword’s response wasn’t great. It was because the sword he just wielded was the work of Grid, not anyone else.

‘I can’t believe I can only scratch the scales with a dragon weapon.’

Hurting a dragon? It was too insignificant to do that. They had received the grace (items) of Grid. They held weapons made of the bones and scales of an Old Dragon in their hands. It was right that their firepower shouldn’t be lacking. They even received the help of Dragon Words. If they couldn’t even hurt a low-grade dragon, they didn’t deserve Grid’s grace in the first place...

“Gasp.” Peak Sword panted for a long time. He was reminded that if they failed to do anything, Grid would have to continue to fight alone for a long time. Over the years, he increased his focus to ensure that Grid’s trust didn’t become something worthless.

[Slashed by a human....?] Kubartos murmured. He tilted his head at an angle and his cold gaze was fixed on the low-grade dragon, who had just been slashed by Peak Sword.

[What is the reason for our existence?]

It wasn’t a philosophical question. The low-grade dragon was enlightened to providence thanks to Bunhelier, who was resurrected after receiving the yeouiju. Now it instinctively replied, [It is to protect humans.]

Kubartos’ elongated maw spread in a sneer.

[It is somewhat similar. It is to reign and rule.]

The moment when the corners of Kubartos’ mouth seemed to be rising upward in a smile, the Breath was already shot. A golden ray filled with Kubartos’ cold magic power—it was reminiscent of the light of the Goddess. Before anyone knew it, the vision of the low-grade dragon was completely covered.

[You don’t deserve it when you were cut by cattle.]

The low-grade dragon was covered by the flash and couldn’t even scream. It stiffened like a stone statue and soon shattered with a terrible explosion.

The dragons were unfazed.

Bunhelier’s soldiers serving the Foreign God. They were an army.

The Age of Oblivion was over and a thoroughly hierarchical society was established. The punishment of a top dragon wasn’t a tragedy but a reasonable punishment.

Cranbel was the only one who showed discomfort. He couldn’t help snorting. Kubartos shifted his gaze to Cranbel and sneered. [I just punished an unqualified guy. I am very sober, unlike the savage guy who ate 11 hearts of his own kin during the Age of Oblivion.]

[Are you criticizing Trauka?] Cranbel wondered.

[Traitor, don’t you dare mention the name of an Old Dragon.]

The golden scales that covered Kubartos rose in unison. Tens of thousands of blades wrapped around him like armor. No, it was more precise to say that he was surrounded by a forest of blades.

A thought appeared in Kraugel’s eyes as he silently watched the situation.

Since it was a sword, it is in the realm of the Sword Saint...

Kraugel recalled his old adage. He reflected on his own value. He walked forward with Kubartos in his vision and Biban followed him, saying, “Calm down.”

“I can cut him. I must cut him.”

“I heard that King Sobyeol also used swordsmanship.”

Biban was aware of the great performance of his distant junior in the east. It was thanks to Grid proudly mentioning it when he returned to the tower with Bunhelier after retrieving the yeouiju.

Biban was proud. He also saw through the fact that it was still insufficient.

“......”

Kraugel read Biban’s intentions. Right now, he was being reprimanded.

He couldn’t even do anything against King Sobyeol, who wielded a sword. What could he do against the top dragon who formed a forest of swords...? It was roughly this type of reprimand.

“Don’t misunderstand,” Biban added. “I don’t think you are lacking. I couldn’t even keep up with your steps when I was your age. I assure you, it is the same with Muller."

It wasn’t consoling for Kraugel. Kraugel was a player. He aged three times slower compared to the inhabitants of the world. He also couldn’t die due to the protection of the system. It was natural for him to grow faster than his predecessors.

Biban told him, “I’m just discussing the laws of the world. I realized after reaching the limits of an Absolute that it still isn’t enough. There is no such thing as infallible strength and power in this world. This is based on my lifelong experience. It is just an exaggerated story that the Sword Saint is invincible against swords. Neither you nor I, not even Hayate and Grid, dares to discuss invincibility against an equal enemy. That is the providence of the world.”

Kraugel could relate. Kraugel didn’t always win when fighting against a swordsman. He had witnessed several times that Grid wasn’t invincible. Even the Goddess, who could claim to be invincible due to handling the power of ‘light,’ was completely countered by the Refractive Dragon. But—

“I understand and sympathize with the words of the Sword God. There is just one thing you are overlooking.”

Step.

Kraugel stepped forward. He shook off Biban’s hand and adjusted his grip on the sword. “If I meet King Sobyeol again now—”

The sword energy that could cut anything dwelled in Kraugel’s Twilight.

This wasn’t the end. Ruby’s Weapon Enchant and Euphemina’s destruction magic were overlaid in turn on Kraugel’s sword energy. The weak divinity of King Daebyeol in Jishuka’s arrows, the aura of destruction emitted by Yura’s magic bullet, and Faker’s shadow sword—they fired as if waiting for Kraugel’s sword energy and then overlapped.

It was the cooperative system that they all devised together after the battle with King Sobyeol.

“I can cut him. I might not be able to carelessly discuss the odds of victory, but I can cut off King Sobyeol’s head several times. That is the answer that ‘we’ came up with. The value is guaranteed by me in the name of the Sword Saint.”

Kraugel recited the Poetry that Praises the Sword and shot forward like an arrow. The magicians of the magic tower, led by Laella, Zednos, and Princess Hwarin of the Ul Clan, overlapped dozens of magic that would accelerate Kraugel.

Sword Saint Kraugel. He was Grid’s sword. In other words, the sword of the empire.

It was right to be upright. Therefore, it was a straight charge.

[Look, Cranbel. Mortals are so insignificant. Even if we allow free will to these incompetent beings, won’t they just waste their life...?]

A speed reminiscent of an Absolute. Kubartos was inwardly surprised by Kraugel’s unexpected speed but still found it insignificant. He spoke casually, only to become speechless

The advance of only one human being. He became stunned because his paw that blocked it hurt to the bone.

[...What?]

The scales that were set up like blades in advance in case of Cranbel’s surprise attack—this human being broke through it without hesitation. The golden blades that withstood the Breaths of an Old Dragon during the Age of Oblivion were brutally swept away.

[Sword Saint, you...!]

The Sword Saint was judged to be advantageous when confronting a sword. Yes, Kubartos naturally knew this. However, he didn’t think that even the swords made of his own scales would be helpless in front of the Sword Saint. He never imagined that the Sword Saint would come at him.

The sensation of the sword penetrating his paw completely and tearing at his muscles was extremely unpleasant. It wasn’t something worth bearing, so Kubartos slammed his paw on the ground in an irritated manner.

Kraugel naturally escaped without much effort. He cut the dragon from the inside and pulled out his sword. The Twilight created by Grid made it possible.

Kubartos’ tail immediately pursued him. It was a tail studded with countless sharp blades. It was like a long chestnut burr.

Kraugel couldn’t avoid it. He read the route with his Super Sensitivity but his speed couldn’t keep up. Cranbel’s Dragon Words were still intact but the one-time (and powerful) buff effect given by his colleagues had already ended.

Dozens of rays of light reflected in his retina and he was forced to raise his sword to defend himself. It was a sword also wielded by Katz, Chris, Hurent, Ibellin, and others. Peak Sword was in the center. Their overlapped swords collided with Kubartos’ tail, slightly reducing the power.

[You have suffered serious damage.]

Thanks to this, it was possible to prevent a situation where immortality occurred with a single blow. Kraugel shook from the shock that penetrated through his defenses. Then the guild chat window updated in his shaky vision.

Peak Sword: What? It increased?

“???”

Peak Sword showed a tremendous performance and made a stupid expression that was unbecoming.

Jishuka scolded him as he was standing mesmerized in the center of the battlefield. “Wake up!”

“Gasp!” Peak Sword came to his senses but he was already covered in a dark shadow.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Kubartos’s huge foot was crashing down on him. It was a scene like a great mountain was falling. It was also the image of death. Peak Sword didn’t have the ability to resist, nor immortality. He was going to die. He suddenly became excited due to the rise in status and penetrated the battlefield too deeply.

‘Well, it is okay. Kraugel’s immortality is more valuable than my life.’

The battlefield was shaking. The ground rose around the point where Kubartos’ foot had trampled. It swelled to the point where it wouldn’t be strange if it exploded right away. However, there was no death message for Peak Sword.

“You are pretty good.”

By the time Peak Sword came to his senses, he found that he was in the arms of Sword God Biban. It was the so-called princess carry.He felt like the main character in a fairy tale.

“From now on, leave the top dragon to Cranbel.”

Biban landed on the Tomb of the Gods with Peak Sword. A super-sized airship that had a city built on it.

He stood on it and contemplated the battlefield. Cranbel and Kubartos were intertwined together. It was like watching the battle of monsters. There were still more than 20 dragons left and they were all approaching and targeting the Tomb of the Gods, but...

“Unexpectedly, it seems worth fighting.”

Biban looked at Kraugel, who joined him one step late. Kraugel looked somewhat absent-minded, just like Peak Sword a moment ago. The Twilight in his hand was crying out. It exuded a much sharper sword energy than before. It was thanks to the achievement of ‘cutting a dragon.’ He didn’t increase in status like Peak Sword, who killed (?) a low-grade dragon, but Kraugel had clearly become stronger.

By this time, more and more people were slowly noticing it. The keywords behind this war—it wasn’t despair, it was opportunity.

If only they could survive. No, even if they died, as long as they could continue playing. The Overgeared Guild would grow into a completely different organization from before.

“Did Grid calculate all of this and sided with the Goddess...?”

Questions poured out.

“......”

Lauel couldn’t bear to answer. He decided it was better to just let them be mistaken.
