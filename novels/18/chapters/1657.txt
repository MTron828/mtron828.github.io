Chapter 1657

The act of absorbing blood wasn’t inherently a means of survival. The vampires who coveted the blood of other species to live were just defective products. The proof was that Braham’s actions weren’t disrupted despite not partaking in the absorption of blood. He regained the power of a direct descendant and became a vampire again, but he didn’t covet the blood of other species. It was because there was no need for it.

“Not bad.”

The blood wiped away by slender fingers—the dark red blood that poured from the sky happened to be Hayate’s blood. It implied that the Dragon Slayer, the last bastion of humanity, was struggling. However, no one knew it. They couldn’t properly watch the battle between Hayate and Bunhelier.

There were some people who even saw it as a game of go. They perceived the polluted sky as a scene of the black and white stones trying to surround each other. It was because their movement was so fast that the figures could only be distinguished by color.

Bunhelier was black, while Hayate was a silver that resembled white. The series of processes where the colors chasing each other formed lines and dots, repeatedly uniting and spreading out, seemed like the process of creating constellations. At first glance, it was beautiful. They wouldn’t have hesitated to enjoy it if it wasn’t for the loud explosions that occurred one after another.

Every time the color and color, or light and light, appeared dozens of times, the roar that followed was so loud that it was incomparably greater than thunder. The echoes were sent through the crumbling ground and caused a bigger earthquake.

People were afraid. It felt like the world was on the verge of the end. They would’ve fallen into great anxiety if they discovered that Hayate, their support, was suffering serious injuries one after another.

However, the situation was rather good for Marie Rose. Unlike Braham, she inherited all of their mother’s abilities and knew how to truly utilize the deed of blood absorption. Marie Rose brought her bloody finger to her lips. Her red lips shone in a bewitching manner and attracted people’s attention. Her beauty caused a serious problem.

It made those who were thinking about the end of the world forget the crisis and fall into a trance. Therefore, it could be used for the purpose of leading people to euthanasia. It felt more like a curse than a blessing. In particular, it seemed to be a great curse for the person concerned.

The people who were fascinated by Marie Rose felt sorry for her. They quickly imagined that she could never truly communicate with anyone because she was so beautiful. The complicated impression she gave of being dignified yet pitiful and bewitching yet innocent naturally aroused a lot of their imagination.

Marie Rose didn’t care. She was accustomed to having the eyes of others on her and just savored the blood of a Dragon Slayer.

‘It isn’t as sweet as my dear husband’s.’

The taste was like perfume. It wasn’t that it was on the level of being bad. Based on the memories of her mother that remained in her mind, it was said that the blood of a high status being was sweet. Yet strangely, it didn’t taste good. Maybe it was the aftermath of tasting Grid’s blood first. She became accustomed to the taste of Grid, so she became dissatisfied with the other tastes.

‘Ahh.’ Marie Rose’s eyes curved while her white cheeks turned red. She felt complete restraint. She was chasing Grid from her mind and spirit to her body, so she felt completely dominated. Up to now, countless beings were obsessed with her and tried to control her, but Grid, who avoided her, was the one who dominated her. It was obvious that a certain pope, who turned his back on the faith he built up all his life and locked his soul in a coffin, would lament after knowing this.

“Eh...?” The people who had been staring blankly at Marie Rose suddenly came to their senses. It was because her collar fluttered and silver waves occurred that were centered around her. It was reminiscent of the aura of a Dragon Slayer, who was fighting fiercely high in the sky.

People’s bodies started tilting. The people who fell to the ground eventually realized that the spot where Marie Rose had just been standing had formed a pit. It was like the surface of the moon. A huge crater was created.

Did the aftermath of the black dragon’s Breath that cut the sky in half manage to reach this far? People were filled with worries and doubts, only to realize the strange sight a moment later. A closed parasol lay neatly in the center of the crater. There were no signs of it being swept away by any explosion.

***

Bunhelier had reigned since the beginning. He swallowed the demonic energy of hell and developed even further, becoming an almighty being. In addition to his high magic power, he was able to utilize all types of evil energies. Therefore, he believed he was invincible and had no doubts. Of course, he had no intention of fighting with other old dragons, but he was confident that he could easily escape a crisis even when faced with an unavoidable situation.

That’s right—most of the crises that Bunhelier imagined came from beings in the same level as him. He wasn’t particularly conscious of anyone unless they were an old dragon or god of the beginning.

The Dragon Slayer? The only Absolute among the human beings? He believed he could easily trample on the Dragon Slayer once they met.

However, the actual situation was very different from his beliefs. This human wasn’t an easy opponent to trample on. The wounds on his body would increase if he didn’t maintain the proper tension. It was very unpleasant.

The absolute defense—he often felt naked when the innate power that protected him in most situations became powerless. There was a slight sense of crisis when the skin and scales that were covered by this defense were cut.

The Dragon Slayer was just as intimidating as his crazy name. It was to the extent that Bunhelier became a bit annoyed at meeting him.

‘It should’ve been someone other than me who dealt with this guy.’

It would’ve been a very interesting sight. He would’ve enjoyed watching it. However, he was reduced to being the spectacle. His anger soared when he thought about the other old dragons who would be watching the situation in their sleep right now. His composure was shaken by the thought that they might be laughing at him.

It was a side effect of hell’s demonic energy. The source of demonic energy was chaos that was mixed with anger, hatred, sadness, and confusion. Bunhelier had been eating chaos as food for quite some time and couldn’t easily control his emotions compared to other old dragons. It was a completely different situation from Trauka, who enjoyed the overt expression of emotions.

Unlike Bunhelier, who only claimed to be invincible after absorbing the demonic energy of hell and built up the confidence to escape any crisis, Trauka was crazy. He believed himself to be invincible from the moment he was born. He didn’t foresee that a crisis would arise during his existence. At the same time, he was unexpectedly cautious, so he seemed to be bluffing... in any case, Bunhelier couldn’t even afford to bluff.

He was often immersed in his emotions. It was a weakness that he was aware of himself. This was the reason why he was extremely reluctant to associate with the Insane Dragon Nevartan.

‘Calm down. There is no reason to be anxious.’

Bunhelier controlled his heart. He struggled to stay calm even though he suffered humiliation several times by the Dragon Slayer, who dared to act recklessly. He was confident that he could get rid of Hayate before Nevartan broke into the scene. Hayate had surprisingly good skills, but he didn’t post a real threat to Bunhelier. This was the case until a moment ago.

[......?!]

He just needed to maintain a speed that Kraugel couldn’t recognize and Kraugel wouldn’t be able to interrupt his activation of the Breath—Bunhelier was aware of this part and flew at the speed of light while releasing a Breath. Then he came to a sudden stop.

The Breath’s trajectory wasn’t completed in the aftermath of the high-speed movement, so the momentum weakened even further and it was split into branches. It wasn’t something he could care about.

Bunhelier’s senses were all directed downwards. Another Dragon Slayer was heading toward him. It wasn’t an illusion. It was real.

[You—what is this?]

It was a situation where his absolute defense and scales alone couldn’t promise complete protection. Bunhelier endured the humiliation and surrounded himself with a magic power barrier. Then he stared at Hayate as if he was going to eat this human.

This was how shocking the situation was. There were two Dragon Slayers, not one. This person had deceived the world...

Bunhelier had no choice but to think this way. It was hard to believe that no one had ever noticed the truth, so he had to be very vigilant.

That’s right—Bunhelier didn’t feel Marie Rose’s aura at all. It was only after she drank Hayate’s blood and reproduced some of the power of the Dragon Slayer that he noticed she was nearby. It was the aftermath of accepting the demonic energy of hell. The Three Evils of the Beginning, who were in the position of dominating demonic energy, had a natural antipathy to him. The secret shackles that Baal placed on Bunhelier were working in Marie Rose’s favor at this moment.

The wave of silver light flowing around the delicate hands pierced through Bunhelier’s barrier from below. It was the Dragon Killing Sword, but it was different from the Dragon Killing Sword. It wasn’t in the shape of a sword, but took the form of five claws. At the same time, it tore apart the magic power and the weak parts of the body.

Bunhelier’s demonic energy was disturbed. The barrier of black magic power had no effect and was shattered.

[You...!]

Bunhelier trembled when he saw the face of the uninvited guest who appeared at eye level with him.

Long black hair and red eyes—the pointed fangs that gradually appeared as the corners of her mouth rose revealed her true identity.

[Beriache’s...!]

Just then, the real Dragon Killing Sword fell down and cut Bunhelier’s scales. It was aimed at the nape of the neck, but it ended up grazing the shoulder. It was because Bunhelier tilted his head back and his neck swelled up greatly. It was the precursor to a Breath. It was an angle that aimed at both Hayate and Marie Rose, who attacked at the same time.

A dopo fluttered behind Hayate’s back as the sword that had been lowered diagonally was raised. It belonged to Kraugel.

[The target’s skill casting has been canceled.]

It was the moment when the sword that cut the breathing finally came into effect. Marie Rose’s unexpected intrusion presented a big opportunity.

“Hmm.” The smile on Marie Rose’s mouth grew even deeper. She saw Hayate rushing forward without worrying about the precursor of the Breath, so she also moved forward without hesitation. Then a human did a great job. It was a familiar person. He was the human who was most active after Grid, so she had heard a lot of rumors here and there.

“Sword Saint. You aren’t bad either.”

Roars occurred in succession. Hayate’s Dragon Killing Sword took the lead and slashed Bunhelier. Thanks to this, Kraugel’s ultimate skill was also slightly effective.

Marie Rose assisted. She used the magic power borrowed from the Dragon Slayer’s energy and more effectively suppressed Bunhelier’s demonic energy. This made the attacks of the two men even more powerful.

[......!]

The evil dragon Bunhelier swallowed his scream. It wasn’t just an effort to save face. It was because he was conscious of Nevartan. He deduced that Nevartan would arrive even quicker if the turmoil increased beyond this. He avoided the Dragon Killing Sword that aimed at his heart using Polymorph.

He used the details of the human body to launch a counterattack. However, a satisfactory result wasn’t obtained. The demonic energy that was mixed with magic power wasn’t controlled. Rather, it was fatal because it responded to Marie Rose’s will.

In effect, his magic was sealed and the movements of his body became dull.

[Baal...!!]

The more he became aware of his condition, the more Bunhelier resented Baal, not the enemies in front of him. He developed a grudge against Baal.

In hell, Baal laughed.
