Chapter 1791

Many people gathered in Reinhardt. It was safe to say that it was all the bonds that Grid had made. They were all smiling widely.

Khan—everyone purely blessed the fact that the most important person to Grid was back. It was even the case for dark gamers like Tarma, the Black and White sisters, and the Shay, Kerb, and Sniffer assassin trio.

“I’m glad the big shit that Veradin did has been belatedly cleared up.”

“I still shudder when I look back on the years I suffered because of him...”

It was after Grid issued a kill order on Veradin and declared that he would destroy Immortal. Numerous dark gamers were directly and indirectly harmed.

The Shay, Kerb, and Sniffer assassin trio were caught by Kasim, who they had long had a bad relationship with, and were hung upside down from the ceiling all day. Due to the prejudice that dark gamers interacted with each other, they were subjected to unfair torture. Unlike the Black and White sisters, who joined Immortal without much thought, the assassin trio had no relationship with Immortal and were still resentful and angry about the events of that time. Tears welled up in their eyes.

“We never even talked to that bastard Veradin before. How could we reply when asked where he was...?”

“To be precise, he was someone we didn’t dare talk to...”

“Yes, because we were relatively weak.”

“Didn’t I tell you to give up the loser’s mentality? The reason we went through the dark ages was purely because we were killed one after another by Grid and Kasim! If it weren’t for those two, we would’ve dominated the assassin ranking! We would’ve been above Tarma!”

“I can’t believe this. Are you talking about me now?”

“H-Hik! Tarma!”

“D-Don’t be scared! In any case, he is just like us! He is a bastard who was squeezed by Grid and Faker!”

“These lowlifes...”

“...Why are you gathering here and making noise?”

“It is a good day so let it go. They have been active since the days of the Great Human and Demon War.”

“Jude is already on his way.

“Oh dear, they are going to be kicked out.”

The noisier the party, the better the mood. The tendencies of the dark gamers had long changed. Now they didn’t commit evil acts. To be precise, there was no need to commit evil acts. It was much easier and more beneficial to do the quests related to demons and demonkin that started to flood out after the Great Human and Demon War, than to act against people. Unless they were a ‘real psychopath’ who gained pleasure from harming people, they adapted and lived well in the changed society.

True madmen were surprisingly rare. Even Agnus was just an ordinary, pitiful man. Among the dark gamers, the Grid who showed no mercy was considered the craziest one.

“Then you have been blacksmithing all the time in heaven?”

Khan was bombarded with questions.

Queen Basara, who ruled Titan, and the dukes who served her were sitting side by side with Khan.

The Overgeared members had sufficiently expressed their feelings and gave up their seats one by one. Of course, the Overgeared members wanted to be by Khan’s side until the end, but there were so many people who wanted to greet Khan.

“I heard that wine springs from the lakes and ponds, not water. So did you quench it in wine?’

“Hmm, not that I hear this, it seems like I became drunk every time I worked...”

“Hahaha! Khan, you are very good at talking!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The questions of the dukes had a rather sensitive side to them. Most of the questions were about how he became an angel after death and what life was like in Asgard. It wasn’t something they could be blamed for. It was a natural instinct for humans to wonder about the afterlife.

Furthermore, Asgard had long been considered a paradise for the humans of this world. For the dukes who didn’t know how Khan was treated in Asgard, they believed that at the very least, he wouldn’t be unhappy. It was natural to believe that it would be better than the souls suffering in hell.

“Are you going to live as a human again in the future?”

It was Basara who silenced the cheerfully talking dukes. Her narrow eyes, which always seemed to be closed, suddenly opened clearly. She was still a wise person, even though she had become a queen and empress, rather than the ruler of an empire. Her clear eyes were full of deep thoughtfulness and were fixed on Khan’s back, which he was struggling to cover with his coat.

“Under the moonlight of a rare calm night, I heard from His Majesty Grid that angels are perfect beings only when they form the Trinity. Khan, if you have to live as an angel, then I’m afraid there will be too many restrictions on you on the surface.”

“You are Grid’s third... no, was it the second wife?”

Khan had already suffered death. He became an angel, not a human, and lived in the world of the gods. It was strange to be bound by his earthly status. It wasn’t because Grid, who was like his child, had become emperor, nor was it because Prince Lord and Empress Irene treated him highly. His position itself meant he was equal when dealing with others.

However, he naturally became careful with his words toward Basara. The bloodline of the Saharan imperial family was great, but the influence of Basara individual’s abilities was greater. The combination of her highly noble attitude and her ability to be respected while respecting others made her a high person.

“Huhu, the order doesn’t matter. Personally, I would rather be the youngest. I won’t refuse if you call me the youngest.”

It was Basara who secretly cared about her age more than Grid. The dukes sipped their drinks with complicated emotions as they saw her treating Khan like an in-law.

“My body has already turned to dust and disappeared. I will have to endure the life of an angel living on the surface without ever being able to return to being a human,” Khan said bitterly.

He was relieved that Grid wasn’t present and whispered softly so that no one would hear him except for Basara and the dukes. In fact, he had been feeling it ever since coming down to the surface. His body was losing its strength. He wasn’t just referring to muscle strength. His energy was gone. He felt himself weakening in real time, as if his body was sick and on the verge of dying.

“I can’t believe it...”

The expressions of the dukes stiffened. In particular, the reaction of Beast King Morse was fierce.

“What is the point of not being able to be happy even though you have reunited with your precious people after a long time? There must be a way! I will definitely find a way with all my might!

The reason why Morse was belligerent was because he was an emotional person. To put it nicely, he was very worried about Khan because he was sensitive. He was ready to howl with the wolves who usually lived together like they were one body.

“Let’s pray to Saintess Ruby! She will take care of everything!”

Finally, he overturned the drinking table and started to pray. Spear Saint Rachel and Immortal King Grenhal quietly pulled him out. The ones who sat in their vacated seats were Grid’s apostles.

“You were an Archangel...”

Khan recognized Sariel instantly. He saw a huge halo of light and wings that were different from his own.

Sariel smiled sadly.

“The greed of the gods causes you new pain every time.”

“Is there no way to solve Khan’s condition?” Piaro urged her. Like the early Overgeared members, he had a long relationship with Khan and was particularly pleased to see him. Then he happened to overhear the conversation with Basara. In fact, the term overheard wasn’t appropriate. Mother Nature just conveyed what happened around him.

“I don’t know how to turn an angel back into a human, but I know how to rejuvenate Khan. It is naturally about forming a Trinity and maintaining it.”

“The Trinity...”

“I happen to be here. If one more angel can be obtained, we can form a Trinity and restore your health.”

“It means we have to secure an angel...”

“In the current situation, we have no choice but to go directly to Asgard. Originally, angels sometimes came to the surface to fulfill their duties, but ever since the Overgeared World came to existence, they have ceased to do so.”

“......”

Piaro’s expression stiffened. It was because he recalled Grid’s declaration that he wouldn’t even pee in Asgard’s direction in the future. There was someone secretly watching the increasingly serious atmosphere through the crystal ball.

“An angel...”

Braham, the God of Magic and Wisdom, was staying deep in the mountains.

Marie Rose—it happened when he noticed Grid showing genuine affection for the object of hatred that took everything away from him... Braham felt like he was going crazy. He felt like his world was falling apart. For a moment, he even felt a bit of resentment toward Grid. Maybe it was due to the overlap of recent events.

Grid, who didn’t call him at every important moment. It felt like the sad feelings accumulated in him exploded in unison. However, he couldn’t turn a blind eye to it forever.

Braham felt that just as Grid understood him when he hurt many people hundreds of years ago to fulfill his desire to break the Curse of Sloth, he too should understand Grid. He wanted to apologize for blaming and resenting Grid. However, he couldn’t open his mouth... Due to his personality, it was difficult to even stand in front of Grid. He was feeling troubled when he got some good information.

An angel.

Let’s rise to Asgard and kidnap an angel...

‘It would be perfect as an apology.’

A distorted smile spread across Braham’s face as he planned it.

“That... can’t you let go of your anger?”

The reason why Grid was absent during the party was due to Mercedes. As everyone was laughing and chattering, she was alone and sad. Then she suddenly left.

Grid fully understood how she felt.

The Seven Apostles—they were the ones Grid should rely on and trust the most. However, Grid suppressed the Apostles at every critical moment and acted alone. It was purely for the sake of the Apostles, but they naturally felt a great deal of skepticism. It was to the point where they seriously considered the reason for their existence.

The Apostles’ dissatisfaction probably reached the peak right after the first battle with Fire Dragon Trauka. The expressions of the Apostles who greeted Grid on the Tomb of the Gods were empty and bitter. For once, they couldn’t hide their feelings.

Mercedes was the only one who was surprisingly calm. Now that he looked back at it, he thought that it might’ve been her truly angry appearance.

“You just say the same thing every time.”

“...I’m sorry.”

“Don’t misunderstand. I have no desire to put a burden on My Liege’s heart. As a knight, I dare not go against the will of My Liege. I have just organized my mind today.”

“Organized?”

“Even though I am My Liege’s knight and Apostle, I understand and accept the situation where I am not needed. I don’t know the position of the other Apostles, but at the very least, you don’t have to look at me in the future.”

“Mercedes, it isn’t that I’m not expecting something from you. I just don’t want to lose you.”

“I know,” Mercedes’ expression was sad as she answered. It was the same reaction as the other Apostles. They seemed to resent their own weakness that caused Grid to worry.

“As I have said many times before, I understand My Liege’s heart. Even so, it was too much for you to rise to Asgard alone...”

Mercedes knew how dangerous Asgard was. It was a truth that could be known without using Keen Insight because she was the Apostle of a god. She fully enjoyed the effects of the Overgeared World, so it was easy to guess how powerful Asgard’s dimensional effect would be.

“From now on.” Grid declared to her, who finally revealed her heart. It was a declaration that could be made because Khan and Hexetia were around. “After I make new dragon weapons and armors, this will never happen again.”

Grid’s Apostles were never weak. In terms of pure level and stats, most of them were more powerful than Grid. It was just that they didn’t have enough items. Creating new dragon weapons and armor would solve the problem.

“From then on, I intend to rely on the Apostles thoroughly even if you don’t like it. So please trust me and wait for me?”

“...There will be no Apostles who refuse.”

It happened as Mercedes finally regained her smile...

Kyaaack...

Screams rang out from the distant party hall. It was so far that Grid could barely hear it.

“What?”

The surprised Grid and Mercedes rushed to the party hall.

“Steady yourself! Vantner! Don’t die!!”

The sight he saw after arriving was truly pandemonium. People were foaming at the mouth. No matter whether they were ordinary people, legends, or transcendent, they were all lying face down on the table.

‘A terrorist attack?’

Terrorism aimed for the day when Khan returned? If it was a player’s doing, Grid would kill them a thousand times to make them pay for their crimes...

“......?”

Grid was looking around with cold anger when he suddenly made eye contact with Idan. Idan was standing there with a very flustered expression. He said in a frightened manner. “That... Y-Your Majesty said I could use the lean meat, so I prepared a feast. Then this...”

“......”

“Raiders clearly enjoyed it. I don’t know what absurdity this is...? Will the meat of a dragon go bad...?”

There were many modifiers, but in any case, Idan had become a legendary chef. It was the day when people who had been waiting for his cooking were attacked as a group.
