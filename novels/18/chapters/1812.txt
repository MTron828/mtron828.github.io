Chapter 1812

Grid moved locations and revealed the reason why he came.

“Intent Production...”

The faces of Hayate and Biban were filled with admiration as they listened carefully. Battle gear made using the body of an Old Dragon as the material—no matter how many destroyed worlds they looked back on, Twilight was the first one. Before Twilight, such battle gear had never existed and couldn’t exist.

However, he intended to create a more powerful weapon than Twilight. It was by adding the mental worlds of the creator and user as better materials. In theory, it was the ultimate battle gear.

“I’m really looking forward to it. But Sir Hayate doesn’t need a sword or armor.”

Biban looked rather sorry.

The Dragon Killing Sword—it was Hayate’s weapon that the entire dragon species was wary of, but it was a concept rather than real. It originated from Hayate’s mental world and responded to the will of its master in real time, becoming a sword that could kill enemies or armor to protect its master.

“My mental world doesn’t match a dragon weapon in the first place.”

The biggest feature and strength of the Dragon Killing Sword was that it erased the power of a dragon. It was completely different from the dragon weapon and armor that embodied the power of a dragon. There would naturally be a collision. The dragon weapon held and wielded by Hayate would instantly be reduced to merely ‘good sword.’

Of course, if he suppressed the energy of a Dragon Slayer when wielding a dragon weapon, he could unleash its full power, but the Hayate who didn’t use the energy of a Dragon Slayer was no longer a Dragon Slayer. Many of his inherent strengths would be lost.

“Isn’t it the blacksmith’s ability to supplement and improve the item according to the client’s circumstances? Armor. Leave it to me to at least make armor.”

In fact, Grid didn’t necessarily want to make a sword for Hayate.He had already witnessed the power of the Dragon Killing Sword many times and received its help. Why be insistent on making a weapon that would replace the Dragon Killing Sword? It was impossible unless he had courage that came out of ignorance.

Of course, he was motivated to make a weapon that could be used with the Dragon Killing Sword rather than replacing it, but at a certain point, even this faded away. It was from the point where he speculated that the dragon weapon and Hayate would have a bad compatibility. When he thought about Hayate’s weapon in the first place, Hayate was already using the Dragon Killing Sword. It would be a waste of energy to worry about it.

However, he couldn’t give up when it came to armor. There was a definite limit to the self-defense force created by the Dragon Slayer energy. This was a fact that Kraugel found by watching the videos recorded when he fought with Hayate and Marie Rose against Bunhelier.

First, the energy of the Dragon Killing Sword weakened whenever Hayate used it for self-defense. It was a situation that occurred because the energy of a Dragon Slayer that was concentrated on the sword was distributed.

Secondly, there was a limit to the strength of the self-defense, even at the expense of the Dragon Killing Sword. It was speculated that it was because he used the energy that was being divided up in the first place, but the self-defense ability was unlikely to improve significantly even if Hayate poured all his energy into it.

‘If Hayate is confident in the Dragon Slayer energy armor... he wouldn’t have needed to be afraid of dragons for so long.’

Hayate was an Absolute, but he was also pure human. He was a very great man deserving of more respect, but he had the limitation that he couldn’t be free from death.

A Dragon Slayer—this was why he had been hiding despite being the only one with this identity in the world. He was incomplete. Behind the imperfection was a low survival ability.

“I want to free you from the threat of death in some small way.”

Of course, Grid couldn’t make armor that made a target invincible or immortal. However, he was able to make armor that would make the enemy wonder, ‘Is that a cockroach?’

He learned from Hexetia and Khan. The technique that purely used the heat of the flame to divide Trauka’s scales into hundreds or thousands of strands and then weaved them together. This new technology was currently concentrated in the Fire Dragon’s Armor that Grid was currently wearing.

‘The key isn’t to melt the scales slowly, but to create a high enough heat to break them in an instant.’

The moment the explosive firepower broke scales like glass, the cells in the scales became rigid at once and became even harder. It took a high degree of concentration, quickness, and dexterity to weave the hard strands of scales that had been thinly ‘torn’ along the grain before they hardened or burned out. This caused even Hexetia to lose dozens of scales in the process. In the end, he completed the Fire Dragon’s Armor with the help of Grid and Khan, but...

‘I can do it.’

Grid decided that he could do it all on his own. He believed in the effect of Dragon Knight, which tripled all stats.

That’s right. In the Dragon Knight state, Grid also had his dexterity tripled. It clearly transcended the dexterity of Hexetia, the God of Blacksmiths. It was possible for him to do the part of three people alone. He also had a separate insurance policy.

The experience of completing ‘Fire Dragon’s Armor’ once was saved in ‘Item Auto Production.’ If even a triple increase in his dexterity failed to weave the scales of Trauka together, he would be able to solve the situation by shortening the time using Item Auto Production from time to time.

Of course, this was the next best option. The item would be less complete from the time he used Auto Production.

‘The simple way is to invite Hexetia.’

The mental world was the inner heart of the person. It contained too many things. Looking at it from a narrow perspective, it could be expressed as a person’s shame, but it was more accurate to say that it was everything. Therefore, it was a lethal move.

Opening up the mental world to the enemy—it was a manifestation of their determination to kill the target without fail. Every time Grid entered the mental worlds of his apostles, he politely asked for understanding because he knew it was very disrespectful. In the end, stepping into Hayate’s mental world was a huge burden for Grid.

Asking him to let Hexetia inside as well? No matter the reason, it didn’t make sense. From Hayate’s perspective, what reason did he have to believe in a complete stranger?

‘I will blow away all the good feelings I’ve built up.‘

...In any case.

“I understand... I am honored by your kindness and gratefully accept it.”

Hayate’s permission was given. Armor that made him no longer rely on the Dragon Slayer energy armor—this was what Hayate wanted more than anyone else. Besides, he respected and trusted Grid. He didn’t hesitate to open the mental world to Grid. There was only one problem.

“Just be careful. It won’t be easy for you to deal with my mental world.”

“I am determined.”

Hayate once bestowed infinite sword energy on Grid. It was sword energy from Hayate’s mental world. However, now he knew. The fact that even that infinite sword energy was only a part of Hayate’s mental world.

Grid was certain that there must be a dragon in Hayate’s mental world. He just couldn’t guess what form it would take. This was the background behind his judgment of being able to activate Dragon Knight within Hayate’s mental world.

‘I can survive in any situation if I activate Dragon Knight.’

Grid’s hair started to flutter. His orange divinity fluttered along with it, making Grid’s neat black hair look like naturally colored long hair. It was due to the wave of sword energy overflowing with Hayate as its source. The wave of infinite sword energy, like the sea, filled and shook the spacious room before he knew it.

It happened the moment when Grid captured the energy of a Dragon Slayer lurking beyond the waves...

[You have entered Hayate’s mental world ‘Dragon’s Tomb.’]

......

...

The scenery seen by Grid changed at once. At the same time, numerous notification windows disturbed Grid’s vision. It was more like a red warning light. The effects of all items related to dragons had been disabled. The mental world of the Dragon Slayer didn’t allow the power of a dragon.

It was amazing... it was a mental world filled with power he couldn’t believe even after experiencing it directly. He was keenly aware of why so many dragons were obsessed with Hayate.

Kurarararara!

A mountain range with endless high peaks. What he saw below the mountains wasn’t the ground, but clouds. It was a high and narrow terrain that daoist immortals like Yeo Yulan came to when training. Somewhere there, a dragon’s cry could be heard faintly.

Grid shifted the direction of his gaze. He saw the shadow of a huge dragon that completely covered one side of the sky at a distance so far away that it was hard to judge the distance. It was a scene of it being suppressed and beheaded. The Dragon Slayer energy that took the shape of a straw cutter cut through the long, thick neck of the dragon. The dragon’s head soon regenerated as it screamed and the reloaded straw cutter repeated the same task.

There were no feelings of killing intent or hatred. It just felt very mechanical.

“Duty... is it the duty of a Dragon Slayer?’

The dragon killing simulation that repeated infinitely to withstand the pressure.

Kurarararara...

Grid tried to interpret the meaning of the distant sight when a new cry came from another place. Grid’s gaze followed the sound. He saw the shadows of many dragons.

The shadows filled every corner of the sky. They were all being slaughtered in different ways. The screams were so horrible that Grid felt like he was being constricted in this mental world.

‘No… it isn’t just a feeling.’

Dragon’s Tomb—Hayate’s mental world denied Grid. To be precise, it was a denial of Dragon Knight. The source of the mental world showed signs of being antagonistic to Grid and suppressed him. If Hayate wasn’t by his side, the energy of the Dragon Slayer that was slashing at the shadowy dragons would’ve poured down on Grid all at once.

In reality—

[The title ‘Dragon Knight’ is sealed.]

Even the effect of Dragon Knight was sealed.

“What can I do to help?” Hayate asked after calming down the Dragon Slayer energy that started to fluctuate wildly.

Grid barely managed to answer, “Just... please stay still.”

“......”

Grid’s Intent Production that he did with the apostles was naturally assisted by the apostles. It was to smelt and temper Trauka’s bones and scales using the energy that made up the apostles’ mental world. However, it was right to handle Hayate’s mental world differently.

Smelting and tempering Trauka’s bones and scales with the energy of a Dragon Slayer That would be destruction, not creation. Of course, it wasn’t making it together if he didn’t receive Hayate’s help.

“Just stay still for now... once I ask you...”

Grid made a thorough plan. Rather than smelting and tempering Trauka’s bones and scales with the energy of a Dragon Slayer, he planned to treat them as if they were bones and scales so that he could accumulate and utilize them as parts of the armor. He also planned to activate the power of Dragon Knight when he created the armor...

However, things were twisted from the start.

Dragon Knight was sealed...

“As expected... are you very uncomfortable...?” Hayate carefully asked Grid, who was so flustered that he couldn’t speak properly.

He predicted this situation and was very worried about Grid.

“That... wait?”

After hesitating for a moment, Grid was about to explain his position only to suddenly come up with an idea.

‘Tearing apart Trauka’s scales. I don’t have to do it myself, do I?’

A way to solve the underlying problem came to mind.

“Hayate.”

“Yes. What is it?”

“Can you use the Dragon Killing Sword to seal the power of an Old Dragon with a single blow?”

“That is impossible. The hierarchy of an Old Dragon is much higher than mine. It will take sufficient preliminary work to properly apply the energy of a Dragon Slayer. It is in such a way as to injure the target’s body or to cause a mental blow.”

“Then can you please attack this?”

Grid pulled out Trauka’s scale.

“Yes.”

The Dragon Slayer energy that filled the mental world reacted to Hayate’s will at once. It immediately took the form of a lightning bolt and struck Trauka’s scale that was placed on the large anvil.

‘This is it.’

A smile spread on Grid’s face as he identified the way that Trauka’s scale was terribly split.
