Chapter 1895

[The other person is in a place where they can’t receive whispers.]

This was the notification that Lauel received every time he sent Grid a whisper.

Grid was in an unusual location.

From the Tower of Wisdom to the Blue Dragon’s area and the dimensional gap—they were places where communication was impossible because they were cut off from the outside world.

Due to this, Lauel wasn’t informed of Grid’s plan when he suddenly departed for the East Continent. He didn’t think much of it at first. The fact that Grid didn’t say anything meant there was nothing unusual about it.

Then he gradually sensed something unusual. Kraugel’s contact was the beginning of it. It was a call saying they had come to the East Continent to prove that Bunhelier was a mixed race. It was nonsense that came out of the blue.

An Old Dragon that existed since the beginning of time was a mixed race...? It was a claim that didn’t have anything supporting it. Lauel started to speculate that Grid had other intentions. He tried to read Grid’s heart, which was surprisingly deep.

Then all of a sudden, he looked out the window. There was the scene of Reinhardt in ruins. It hadn’t been fully restored. It was because Chiyou went on a rampage. The heart of the Overgeared Empire and the place where his precious people lived was miserably destroyed.

“Ah.”’ Lauel remembered what type of person Grid was.

The incarnation of rash and thoughtless actions—he kept saying he would be careful with his words, but he created unpredictable developments every time. It was proof that he wasn’t the type to thoroughly plan and execute things carefully. It would be the same this time.

“He is going to take revenge on Chiyou.”

It all started to add up. The reason why Grid secretly headed for the East Continent after making Bunhelier join him with a forced argument—it must be because he planned to get revenge on Chiyou without causing damage to others.

‘...Surprisingly, this seems like good timing.’

Chiyou might have the best martial arts in the world, but he wasn’t invincible. The evidence was that he wanted to die. It meant he could be killed. He must not be in a perfect condition after being pursued by Dominion and the Valkyrie army and fighting a long battle of attrition. Now was the chance to attack before he recovered.

Lauel calculated that even if they couldn’t kill Chiyou, it was quite possible to inflict devastating damage on the Hwan Kingdom.

‘It is a revenge battle if it succeeds.’

This was why Lauel dispatched reinforcements in a hurry.

***

Evil Dragon Bunhelier was still in the form of a small mouse. He calmed down and suppressed his anger due to Grid’s words to him. It was an attitude of respect for his friend. But from the perspective of others, he was just an obedient pet mouse.

The vigor of the Three Masters was on the rise.

“God Grid’s wife. Are you going to hide your identity until the end?”

The Three Masters didn’t even bother to look at Bunhelier. To borrow an expression from the east, it was because Bunhelier had reached the level of ‘achieving extremely high martial arts and looking like an ordinary person.’

Every time he met Baal and Chiyou, he turned into a mouse and hid his breath. His Polymorph skill, which was almost perfect, had evolved over and over. Even an Absolute of the same rank couldn’t see through his Polymorph. It was clearly impossible for the Three Masters, who were deceived by Berith's skin mask, to notice Bunhelier’s identity.

‘It is natural that they can’t distinguish between the skin mask and my true face.’

Grid always utilized blacksmith-related techniques. It wasn’t just his main equipment. Even his auxiliary tools had reached a level where they had evolved. The performance of Berith's skin mask had increased by several times compared to the early days.

Grid’s power was almost fraudulently superior. It can’t be considered that the Three Masters were incompetent.

‘Overall, it is a power that is hard to ignore.’

Grid knew that the momentum of the Three Masters wasn’t a bluff. It was easy to believe that they survived after even separating from Dominion’s forces. They might have a history of losing to Raphael, but this didn’t mean there was a reason to disparage the skills of the Three Masters. In the first place, Raphael was on par with Baal. Of course, Raphael was inferior in pure force compared to Baal, who was the ruler of a dimension, but they were clearly an Absolute.

‘It will take me a while to suppress them without using the sword dances...’

Grid was still wary of Chiyou’s intrusion. He contemplated the situation on the basis of sealing the skills that could identify him. Of course, the Three Masters didn’t know this. They only looked with pity at the blonde-haired woman, who was overwhelmed by the storm and couldn’t move.

“The Crazy Dragon who married a god. You, too, must have your own reasons. If you are in a situation where you can’t reveal your identity, it is good for your personal identity if you step down obediently. It is a lot of pressure for us to be antagonistic to God Grid.”

“Please understand that we can’t let you reach King Sobyeol.”

“......”

Grid felt strange. He couldn’t harbor much animosity toward the Three Masters, who were doing a good job of respecting the person they repeatedly hindered in the past.

Essentially, the Three Masters were gods. Unlike demons, they didn’t kill rashly. From the perspective of Grid, who had already liberated the East Continent, they weren’t a target to hold grudges against. It was the relaxation of the winner.

‘Should I just ignore them and move on?’

In any case, he would have to bring out all his strength the moment he came face to face with King Sobyeol. The key was whether he could cut King Sobyeol or not before Chiyou intervened.

Anyway, it was urgent to get to the scene. In the end—

“......”

Grid activated Barbatos’ Vision. He looked at the clear sky beyond the countless raindrops with the power of artillery shells.

“......?!”

The Three Masters responded immediately. They created a storm in all directions.

It was meaningless. Grid jumped over it with Shunpo.

“Using it like that continuously?”

Originally, Shunpo wasn’t a skill that could be used infinitely. It was because it consumed a lot of mental and physical strength at the same time. It couldn’t be used several times in a row unless one was an Absolute. Meanwhile, the blond-haired woman didn’t seem to feel such pressure at all. Furthermore, she had a wide field of view. This was enough to confirm that she was a dragon.

The Three Masters had temporarily regained their strength and were also accustomed to Shunpo.

The rain and wind moved along with the Three Masters who were chasing after Grid. The sky they stood on was always gray and their territory gradually expanded. It was so gray that it reached as far as Barbatos’ vision could see.

It was a great achievement. The sky within Grid’s line of sight were all dominated by rain, wind, and dark clouds. This made it difficult for Grid to secure a proper view.

‘They are really uselessly competent.’

Grid clicked his tongue as he once again realized the power of the Three Masters. He thought about how the Three Masters could act as one Absolute if they joined forces, and was prepared for a surprisingly long chase. To be honest, he wanted to use a sword dance on the Three Masters right away. However, Grid was aware of his position. He never acted rashly.

“...Let’s just kill them.” It was in just one minute. As the Shunpo’s strides became smaller and smaller, Grid suffered a heavy loss and lost his patience.

He had already prepared the justi?cation that the battle would become very difficult if the Three Masters joined with King Sobyeol. He put one hand on the hilt of Twilight tucked into his coat. This caused Bunhelier to stare at him in amazement.

Suiddenly, light fell. It was a color reminiscent of the sunset. It was just like Grid’s divinity that he was suppressing. However, it wasn’t Grid’s divinity. It was much hotter. It was just like flames.

“Red Phoenix...”

The rain and wind evaporated from the heat.

The Three Masters had expressions of disbelief as they saw the dark clouds receding helplessly. Then they figured out the cause.

At the same time—

The light turned into flames that dominated the scene. The Red Phoenix that rose like the sun between Grid and the Three Masters was unusually small. The symbol of the Red Phoenix was sacrifice. This was the aftermath of burning its own vitality to stop the strong rain and wind.

‘I appreciate your protection...!’

Then the Three Masters each drew out a combination of an iron wire, a soft sword, or a whip made of adamantium, and wielded them. They were equipped with weapons that hadn’t been shown in the past. It was a form that clearly had a pincer attack in mind. They were acutely aware of their many advantages.

Grid judged that the Red Phoenix would quickly be on the defensive and stopped trying to draw Twilight.

Just then, the eyes of the Three Masters lost focus for a moment.

The rainwater that hadn’t evaporated yet—blue lightning flowed through the moisture that was soaking the dopos of the Three Masters. Following the Red Phoenix, the Blue Dragon also descended.

-I was deliberately one step late. It is because the Red Phoenix must come out first to gain an advantage in the pincer attack...

The expression of the Blue Dragon was ugly as it explained why it arrived later than the Red Phoenix.

Bunhelier’s eyes showed complex feelings.

On the other hand, Grid didn’t misunderstand. He understood the Blue Dragon’s explanation. He glimpsed hope in the fact that the Four Auspicious Beasts were as good at pincer attacks as the Three Masters.

He asked, “Can I leave this place to you?”

-......

The Blue Dragon delayed answering.

Grid suddenly remembered the noble dragons. He vaguely overlapped the personalities of Cranbel and the Blue Dragon, who both carefully thought about things before acting in any situation.

“It just doesn’t feel confident...” It happened the moment when Bunhelier spoke nonsense with a complicated expression...

-Of course. I can handle the Three Masters.

The Blue Dragon completed the calculations and replied confidently. It happened to be after two men arrived at the scene.

The blond hair and black hair that blew in the wind contrasted with each other.

Grid’s apostles—they were Zik and Mir respectively. Additionally, the White Tiger and the Black Tortoise could be felt approaching in the distance.

The Blue Dragon’s voice grew louder.

-Leave this place to me and move on.

“The Four Auspicious Beasts can handle it by themselves.” Zik grasped the situation and approached Grid.

Mir stood beside the Blue Dragon, who had closed its mouth. He spoke to the Three Masters, “Long time no see, three gods. We have a connection to end.”

“You—Mir, this traitor has no shame...!”

Mir properly provoked the Three Masters.

A being born thanks to Hanul giving him life—they didn’t have any intention of forgiving Mir for betraying Hanul.

Zik said cautiously to Grid, “Their level seems higher than I thought...”

“That’s right. Try to cooperate with Mir and the Four Auspicious Beasts.”

“Yes.”

It was only then that Grid was free. He still retained the form of Basara as he moved through the open sky again. Humans on the surface were witnessing her everywhere.

At the same time, Titan...

“I apologize... did you change your cosmetics?” Spear Saint Rachel cautiously asked Basara.

It was an attitude that was only possible because they had once been colleagues. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Basara smiled widely. “Yes, it is a gift from His Majesty.”

“As expected, people should meet good spouses...”
