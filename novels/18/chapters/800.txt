’That magic sword can wreak so much havoc alone?’

A magic sword could only be created by combining the strengths of a magician and a blacksmith. A blacksmith or magician could sometimes produce it alone, but this was a very rare occurrence. Goldhit had experience with producing magic battle gear with blacksmiths.

‘It is difficult to produce such a magic weapon alone.’

There were three types of magic weapons.

First, a magic battle gear imbued with complete magic. In this case, it was possible to consume the user’s mana when the magic was used.

Second, there was magic battle gear enhanced with magic. It increased the magic power of the wearer.

Third, there was magic battle gear containing a pure attribute. It consumed the wearer’s mana while having a certain probability of releasing fire, ice, electricity, etc. It wasn’t very powerful despite being able to express the pure power of an attribute.

The current sword Grid was using was the third type. But the user’s mana wasn’t consumed. The atmospheric mana was used every time flames were released. Thus, the user wasn’t tired and the power of the flames were huge. It was a weapon that would appear in legends.

‘A legendary sword...!’

Goldhit recalled that Grid was Pagma’s Descendant. All her nerves were concentrated on Grid’s long sword. It wasn’t made out of an ordinary material.

‘Demonic energy? Don’t tell me?’

The story that Grid defeated the Great Demon Belial was already well known. Goldhit could easily guess what type of material the sword was made out of.

‘A by-product of Belial!’

Definitely. This sword would be worshipped as a legendary sword later on. In addition, it was likely that Grid had made it directly. Goldhit got goosebumps. How many years had it been since she felt such admiration? Looking back on faint memories, it seemed to happen half a century ago.

A dark smile appeared on Goldhit’s face. Her impression of Grid changed. He wasn’t just the beneficiary of enhancement magic. She accepted him as a greater person.

‘In fact, it was like this from the beginning.’

The other person was a legend, the hero of a nation, a person who built a new kingdom and a hero of heroes. Now that her narrow-mindedness due to her obsession with enhancement magic was released, Goldhit had genuine respect for Grid.

’A hero that transcends the era... It is right to greet him politely.’

But.

‘Don’t forget my original purpose.’

Respect and purpose are separate things. She felt respect but she needed to do what she had to do. Goldhit needed to encourage Grid to use enhancement magic. She checked on Grid on the 16th floor and pulled out her trump card.

"Let’s try the lilith guardian.”

***

[You have dealt 1 damage to the target.]

[You have dealt 1...]

[The Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has emitted flames. It deals 5,000 fixed fire damage to the target.]

The Enlightenment Sword had ‘a certain chance to release large flames with every attack.’ Based on Grid’s experience, the probability was around 30%. As the number of attacks increased, the probability of releasing flames would increase exponentially.

It had a very good compatible with the Alex’s Quick Gloves which raised Grid’s basic attack speed.

The power was very low compared to the black flames and it was often useless against enemies with high fire resistance because it had a pure fire attribute. But it was useful in situations like now. It was sometimes more capable that the black flames which was separated as physical attacks.

‘There are many item options remaining.’

A huge smile! Wasn’t this huge luck? Grid smiled as he saw that his intelligence stat had increased by 12 points and ascended to the 16th floor. Grid was able to handle all the guardians while climbing up here and didn’t feel any great tension. Of course, this didn’t mean he wasn’t vigilant.

‘Isn’t this different?’

Snap!

He opened the door to the 16th floor without a hitch and looked at the features of the waiting guardian. The physique was very small. It was the level of a normal adult male so there wasn’t any big pressure. However, it was less likely for monsters on the higher floors to be weaker than monsters on the lower floor. It was ridiculous to judge the outward appearance.

‘It reminds me of Braham’s golems...’

He recalled the golem invasion of Reinhardt years ago. The humanoid golems with small physiques had caused the most casualties. Their strength that was incomparable to ordinary golems was still vivid in his memories.

‘Doesn’t this golem look similar? Am I mistaken?’

[Lilith Guardian]

Grid looked at the name and appearance of the monster before trying to grasp the type of metal that the body was made out of.

“Kuk!”

He reflexively raised his sword. It was because the guardian narrowed the distance with footwork reminiscent of Yangban Garam’s Shunpo and suddenly appeared in front of Grid’s nose.

Peeeeeong!

Shockwaves occurred the moment the Enlightenment Sword collided with the guardian’s fist. One of the inner walls and a part of the ceiling collapsed. Grid ignored the rain of stones and fought back, hitting the guardian before using the moment to raise his sword. He linked attacks without stopping. He judged that the act of opening the distance against the guardian would be bad. Grid kept wielding the sword and didn’t give the guardian a break.

Kaang!Kakakang!

Every time Grid hit the guardian, it suffered one damage. Like the previous guardians, this one was resistant to physical attacks. There was no defense against a man who cut and stabbed and who wasn’t afraid of being hit. It punched with its right fist when Grid slashed and responded with a left fist when Grid stabbed in the centre.

[You have suffered 1,900 damage.]

[You have suffered 1,780 damage.]

[You have suffered 1,910 damage.]

The damage that Grid received accumulated. Despite the outward appearance, Grid was being one-sidedly struck. Yet he wasn’t irritated and waited for the release of the flames.

Peeng!

Finally, the Enlightenment Sword burned red.

However.

[You have dealt 1,660 damage to the target!]

’What? Why is its fire resistance so high?’

The guardian’s health gauge only got a small scratch. The total health was also high. It was difficult to tell how long it would take to die if Grid only relied on the release of flames that dealt a small amount of damage. Maybe Grid’s stamina would be depleted quicker than it took for the guardian to die.

Jjeejeeeong!

The guardian ignored the Enlightenment Sword, jumped into the air and kicked out. Grid’s vision filled with the crumbling ceiling as he flew back.

And.

“Yohohoho... Is it hard to hold on?"

Goldhit on the 80th floor clearly saw Grid’s shaky eyes.

In fact, at first she had chills. She had been amazed beyond admiration when she saw Grid respond to the guardian’s first space jump using the magic Blink. She knew that Pagma’s Descendant was a blacksmith and swordsman. She never dreamt that Grid would show such strength and agility.

Yes, Grid was much more outstanding than rumoured. Maybe the empire had underestimated him.

‘But.’

Resistance was a factor that neutralized strength. In order for Grid to defeat the guardian with excellent fire resistance, he had to discard the sword and bring out magic. Goldhit’s expectations reached the peak. She hoped that Grid in the crystal ball would used the enhancement magic she wanted. She still didn’t know. Grid was an expert at destroying common sense.

***

Peok!

Kwajajak!

‘It isn’t painful.’

Grid desperately felt Khan’s presence every time he was hit by the guardians’ punches and kicks. It was because the work Khan left behind was protecting Grid. Valhalla emitted a little bit of smoke every time the guardian hit Grid. Only Grid knew what it was the precursor of.

Chukakakakak!

Peeng!

Grid cut at the guardian’s chest while accumulating minor damage and smiled.

Jeeeeeong!

The guardian’s fist firmly hit him. At the same time. The guardian’s fist hit Grid’s arm and green smoke emerged from the armour. It was now a fog.

“This...!”

Goldhit, who had been watching closely in order to not miss the moment when Grid used magic, was shocked and stood up. She noticed it. The identity of this fog was poison!

Shaaaaah-

It was the poison that Kyleo had completed after many experiments. The powerful poison that was hard to resist filled the 16th floor. It was an option attached to Khan’s armour. The lilith guardian suddenly lost its destructive momentum. The guardian couldn’t resist the poison. Not only did its health drop, its movements also became dull. The unidentified metals that made up the body quickly rusted.

“This is ridiculous!”

He had a powerful magic armour as well as the magic weapon? It even caused reflective damage? Goldhit was nervous as Grid quickly cleared the 16th, 17th and 18th floors with the help of the armour. He was now entering the 19th floor. It was the last gateway. If Grid broke through the 19th floor, he could reach the 20th floor.

In the end.

-Expand the gateways by 10 more!

Goldhit’s urgent voice rang in the minds of the magicians of the tower. Her disciples were upset.

-Aren’t you giving an outsider too many benefits?

-Master, the internal backlash will be great.

The essence of knowledge that was obtained every time the tower was climbed was incredible large. Therefore, climbing the tower had great meaning. The magicians of the Tower of Eternity studied in order to qualify to climb the tower. Yet Goldhit was giving preferential treatment to the outsider Grid.

Goldhit asked the worried disciples.

-How many people can climb the tower even if they qualify?This is a trial, not preferential treatment.No matter how much I increase the gateways, it will be pointless if Grid fails. And Grid... Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was rising. He kept continuing! Even without magic!

“Dammit...!”

Goldhit had been blocked by a wall for decades. The lack of development meant the past few years of Goldhit’s life was hell. Her only hope was Grid. However, the problem was that Grid wasn’t a person who could be predicted.

[Grid is on the 24th floor.]

[Grid is on the 25th floor.]

[Grid is on the 26th...]

.......

.......

"...No, he still isn’t using magic?”

Who could imagine that the strongest magician on the continent would be sulking like a child? Even Grid couldn’t imagine despite him making Goldhit like this.

[A new gateway has opened. Please challenge up to the 40th floor!]

“Is this heaven?”

The gateways kept being generated and he kept getting rewards! Grid had secured 40 intelligence in just three hours. The smile couldn’t disappear from his face. He was extremely happy.
