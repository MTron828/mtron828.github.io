[Falling Moon Sword]

[Rating: Myth

Durability: Infinite Attack Power: 1

★ No matter the target, it must be cut. Ignore effects such as defense, evasion, counterattacks, reflection, damage reduction, ignore damage, and other effects. The amount of damage applied is calculated by adding up all of the user’s stats and multiplying it by the target’s level. A critical hit will be dealt unconditionally and all the buff effects of the target will be eliminated, making them unable to use buffs for three minutes.

★ It can be swung once every 10 minutes.

This is a new product made by Overgeared God Grid tempering the moon night iron for 23 days and nights.

A blade emitting cold light that destroys all concepts.

Weight: 500

Conditions of Use: Grid]

Grid’s total stats was approaching close to 58,000. Of course, this was when all the non-combat stats such as dexterity, dignity, and political power were added. Strictly speaking, it meant nothing. What was the use of having stats at least three times higher than the other rankers?

Stats that affected combat were limited and non-combat stats were excessively subdivided. A typical example was that Grid’s political power stat was still only 800. It was very low compared to the average political power stat of a player engaged in political activities, so it didn’t exert much power in managing internal affairs.

Although the ‘all stats increase’ benefit of creating items was the basis for creating the current Grid, recently Grid had been somewhat disappointed by the benefits. He felt it was a shame and thought it would be better if the points were focused on necessary stats rather than all the useless ones. Of course, this was greed without a conscience. He knew there was no possibility it would be realized.

Still, he made the Falling Moon Sword with the obsession that couldn’t be abandoned. It was a weapon that made full use of his surplus stats. It was perfect for Grid. It was worth spending 23 days stuck in the smithy. Of course, it wasn’t completely satisfactory. He could only wield it once every 10 minutes and the name was too shabby. Considering the beautiful appearance and eerie power, the name ‘Scorched Earth’ was more appropriate than ‘Falling Moon.’

‘What is this naming sense? Tsk.’ T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The S.A Group... there was really nothing satisfactory about them. The only thing they did well was creating a virtual reality world that was exactly the same as reality, processing and implementing the world that was wider than Earth as an open field that billions of users could enjoy together, and providing complete freedom...

‘...They are amazing! S.A!’

Dammit, he wanted to scold them without mercy, but it wasn’t possible. It was true that many people, including him, were happy due to the virtual reality world they created. It wasn’t that he was saying good things because the Falling Moon Sword was myth rated. The S.A Group was a great company to be grateful to. It was a company that had acquired nation-level resources and power for a reason.

“Um...” Grid calmed his excited heart and turned his attention to the sun carriage. The appearance was like a condensed sun. It was normal to be unable to look directly at it because it was too dazzling but Grid could see everything in the carriage without discomfort.

[Thank you for visiting the sun carriage, an open market for all the gods in the world ( *˘╰╯˘*). The market’s cutie ❤Venice❤ doesn’t discriminate against customers. It isn’t just Asgard. All the gods in the world can use it! ᑊ ڡ ᑊ]

[Take the reputation gathered by human worship as wealth and buy the goods sold by other gods or sell your own goods. .("◕ ‿◕"✿)]

“...Hah.” It was once again a ridiculous introduction.

Venice—one of the gods of Asgard, she was a potential enemy of Grid, but she felt very different from normal gods. He wasn’t just referring to her tone when speaking. It was a business for all the gods in the world... she was unlike other gods who were closed up and did activities in Asgard, the Hwan Kingdom, or the East Continent, and her open mind was amazing.

Of course, Grid didn’t trust her. ‘She isn’t doing this to get along with the gods.’

The introduction pointed out that the ‘reputation gathered by the worship of humans’ or ‘faith’ should be used as wealth. Meanwhile, the power of a god was directly related to faith. The more faith that a god had, the stronger they were. A typical example was the martial god. All the gods in the world coveted faith. Venice established and opened this market by using the psychology of such gods.

‘Will all the fees that occur when trading with the sun carriage enter Venice’s pocket?’

Grid made this guess and frowned. He felt that Venice wasn’t a simple existence and felt a great sense of caution. Then his expression gradually changed as he checked the items registered in the sun carriage.

Various gods were selling their power or things. All of them except for Zeratul were anonymous.

‘Why is Zeratul using this place?’

He might be a fake but the martial god was the martial god. It was much easier for Zeratul to build up faith than any other god. He just had to sit still and faith would accumulate. Grid didn’t understand why he was selling things on the market.

‘Don’t tell me... he just wants to brag...’

Even Venice said that Zeratul’s selling price was a rip-off. It was highly likely that he was just showing off seeing that he was a god with no need to put things up for sale to gain faith.

‘Don’t look at what Zeratul has posted.’

The secret techniques were items with a source. It wasn’t worth buying with reputation points that were extremely difficult to collect. The problem was that the Secret Technique Box was a random draw.

“......!” Grid’s appearance stiffened as he looked down at the list of items.

[Hexetia’s Hammer & Anvil]

[These items were confiscated when the traitor, Hexetia, was imprisoned. I bought it on impulse because it came at a low price at auction, but there is no place to use it ( •́ ̯ •̀ ).

Seller: Venice

Price: 35,000, commission not included]

“Hexetia...”

The blacksmithing god who was imprisoned for helping Grid. The things he had cherished all his life were being treated as nuisance in this place. The price was 35,000. The price was very cheap considering they were the symbols of Hexetia. It was simply shabby compared to one-time items or goods registered for tens of thousands of points.

Of course, it wasn’t cheap from Grid’s standpoint. Perhaps it might be different if the faith of the Overgeared God Church could be used as wealth like reputation one day, but Grid could currently only build up reputation by making myth rated items or raids.

Nevertheless, Grid didn’t hesitate. He willingly paid the reputation points to purchase Hexetia’s hammer and anvil. The divine objects of the blacksmithing god would be of great help to him. It didn’t matter even if they couldn’t help. They were items to be returned to Hexetia anyway.

‘I will take care of your things. I’ll give them back to you after rescuing you.’

[35,000 reputation points have been paid to purchase Hexetia’s Hammer & Anvil.]

The two items were delivered to Grid’s inventory along with the notification window. He was about to confirm the item information when he heard someone’s voice.

-Oh my, oh my?I was wondering what type of thankful customer you are. It turns out it is you?

It was easy to infer who the owner of the voice was. ‘Venice.’

The god of money. The god most merchants served. The buff effect that occurred when serving her was known to be advantageous during item trading. In particular, the effect of reducing fees was excellent.

“Do you know me?”

-Of course!A god born from the desires of humanity!Grid, you are famous among us.Huhu, there is no need to look nervous.The sun carriage is open to all the gods in the world.Even if it is a god hostile to Asgard, I won’t leak information or apply poison as long as you are a customer of the sun carriage.

“I’ll believe you.”

-Use the sun carriage often.If you want to sell things, then don’t you think I’m pretty good?

"I understand.”

Grid didn’t want the conversation to last long. Gods were good at concealing their hearts so it was hard to expect a useful conversation. Rather, it was possible that he might be the only one to leak information. Grid wasn’t very interested in conversation and Venice noticed it.

-Then see you later~~

“......”

Venice left. Grid confirmed the information of Hexetia’s hammer and anvil and was relieved. It was because the performance was much better than Grid’s hammer and anvil. It was natural since it was used by the blacksmithing god.

‘It is different from the hammer I saw before. Is it new?’

It was very good. In particular, the effect of doubling the speed of item production was the best. If he had this hammer then he wouldn’t have needed to use 23 days to make the Falling Moon Sword. However, it wasn’t at the level to be called fraudulent. In the first place, a limit was set for production items. The production probability of high ranked items couldn’t be increased infinitely.

Ttang.Ttang.Ttang.

Grid immediately started production. This time he was making a belt that would help him use the Magic Power Ejection Machine more quickly. The completion was very fast thanks to Hexetia’s hammer and anvil.

‘Shall I go?’

Grid finished his work in the smithy and summoned the messengers. It was time to go to war with hell, which could potentially collude with heaven. The goal of this itinerary was to capture the hells in the 20s. Grid believed it would be possible. After all, the grandmaster and Nefelina were on his side this time. Moreover, Leraje was more cooperative than expected.
