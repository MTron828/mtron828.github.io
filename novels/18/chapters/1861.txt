Colorful Balloons Take Flight

It was almost a disaster—that was the overall assessment of those who watched Grid’s hell expedition. This expedition didn’t end even when Baal was killed. Instead, incidents repeatedly occurred. If Grid had failed, people would’ve complained to the S.A Group and said that it was a really terrible game.

This damn thing. What type of nonsense was it that the situation didn’t end after defeating the final boss, and one crisis after another kept popping up?

They were nervous even from the position of those cheering. It scared them. Then how were the feelings of the parties involved?

“What is the point of protesting as a group? They won’t quit the game anyway. Isn’t that right?”

“There is no alternative.”

“That is the scary thing about Satisfy. If it wasn’t for Grid, the users would always be at odds with the company.”

Reinhardt, the capital of the Overgeared Empire, and in addition, the super-large airship floating above Reinhardt, the Tomb of the Gods—a grand festival was held in the ‘greatest city on the surface’ and the ‘greatest city in the sky,’ which were located next to each other on the ground and in the sky.

A festival was held to celebrate a successful expedition. It far exceeded the scale of the self-celebration of the Overgeared Guild. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that people came from all over the world. The crowds gathered at Reinhardt and the Tomb of the Gods was staggering.

It was truly unprecedented. It was also a festival of a scale that would never be seen in the future.

The reporters from third-rate news organizations around the world watched the crowds enjoying the festivities without any worries and were convinced—in this atmosphere, if they wrote malicious articles against Grid and the Overgeared Guild, they were bound to be terrorized by someone.

At this time, it was right to abandon their rigid work ethic...

A truly surprising thing happened when the third-rate reporters, who originally made their living by writing ‘rumors without any accurate evidence’ or ‘articles avoiding responsibility when rumors were false,’ didn’t write recklessly. It was a great unification of the media that transcended borders, races, and ideologies.

From all over the world, there were only articles favoring Grid and the Overgeared Guild. This was something that no great person or group in the history of humanity had achieved.

Of course, the resulting backlash occurred. Was it because of the sense of crisis that they might lose their livelihood? The third-rate and tabloid media from all over the world targeted the S.A Group and relentlessly bit at them. If it wasn’t for Grid and the Overgeared Guild, who would’ve defeated Baal and the hidden bosses one after another, and purified hell? They criticized the S.A Group and Chairman Lim Cheolho for being hypocrites. Chairman Lim Cheolho repeatedly stated that he wanted Satisfy to be the hope of the people, but Satisfy’s ending was actually set as a bad ending.

“I feel better.”

Peak Sword laughed. Most of the members of the Overgeared Guild responded the same. In fact, they were the ones who wanted to blame the S.A Group the most. It was especially so when they saw the development of ‘Baal’s death gave birth to Asura.’ It was really... many people uttered curse words that they had never spoken in their lifetime. Then the third-rate media outlets, which were usually hated, started to target the same object of hatred and were rampaging wildly.

“It is completely letting the barbarians fight among themselves,” Hao said as he smiled slightly and tilted his glass. He was still wearing a gold mask.

Ibellin asked carefully, “The mask... why are you using it?”

The reason why Regas was wearing a mask was revealed.

At the time of the Asura raid—Regas, who hadn’t been able to grow up due to the Asura class, made explosive progress by replicating Asura’s skills in real time. It was a relief after being suppressed for several years.

Yes, the reason for wearing a mask was quite convincing. If Asura had recognized Regas’ face and was wary, Regas wouldn’t have been able to replicate Asura’s skills and wouldn’t have been able to help Biban in any way. Regas needed to hide his identity.

On the other hand, what about Hao? The reason why he had to wear a mask was still a question...

“Look at the attitude of these media outlets right now. If it is revealed that Hao is working with us, there will be a lot of uproar in China,” Regas explained on behalf of Hao, who laughed bitterly.

“Ah.”

It made sense right away. Hao became a traitor to China just because he admitted defeat to Grid in the National Competition. He had been criticized so much and for too long that he couldn’t handle it. His desire to hide his identity was understandable.

“It almost seems like the object they will criticize will become Hao, not the S.A Group. It is very difficult to be famous.”

Ibellin himself was a celebrity. It meant Ibellin had suffered tremendously from the third-rate media outlets that were now biting at the S.A Group like the group was their parents’ enemies. In other words, he could fully understand Hao’s position.

“I think that Grid is really great in that sense.”

Hao laughed.

The success of the hell expedition—it was right after accomplishing the tremendous feat of saving humanity. To put it bluntly, the eyes of all of humanity were focused on Grid. Besides, it was now the time of the festival with the provocative promotional phrase ’Overgeared Guild’s Treat.’

During the festival, visitors to Reinhardt and the Tomb of the Gods could enjoy unlimited food and drinks for ‘free.’

According to Lauel’s calculations, it was still a surplus business. No, it was a ‘business that will make more money.’ Thanks to the promotional slogan of unlimited food and drinks, even those with heavy buttocks came to the festival.

Additionally, as the best city in Satisfy, Reinhardt sold all types of rare things. To add a bit of exaggeration, the quality of the stalls in a corner of Reinhardt’s smallest market was comparable to the quality of the goods stocked by the most famous stores in small and medium-sized cities. This meant that visitors had no choice but to open their wallets.

Additionally, there was a huge number of demonkin among the tourists for this festival. They had regained their freedom after being trapped in the safe zones all their lives and came to the surface for the first time. From their perspective, the ordinary items sold by Reinhardt were rare treasures that they had never seen in their lifetime. It was natural to imagine Administrator Rabbit crying out of happiness.

In any case, in this place where so many people were visiting—

Today, Grid would hold a surprise wedding ceremony. This was given that Grid was often criticized by people for only one reason: his experience with women. It was a very bold decision...

“It will be an opportunity for some of the media and public opinion to turn against Grid when it is currently unconditionally favorable to him.”

Currently, Grid had three wives. Of course, it was a common situation for players who had obtained a decent title to be to married multiple men or women. The problem was that Grid also had two lovers in real life.

Gaining a new wife in this situation? The media currently biting at the S.A Group would turn their attention to Grid. Grid clearly knew this fact, but he said he would definitely get married this time. He said he wanted to be blessed by more people.

At this point, it meant that Grid wasn’t afraid of the press at all. It was because he received the most attention in the world and must’ve suffered from the media more than anyone else.

For Hao and Ibellin, it was a strong heart that they really wanted to emulate. No, it was closer to being incomprehensible.

Then Lauel poked his head out from among the Overgeared members worrying about the criticism that Grid would face.

“In fact, it must be now.”

The emperor’s wedding ceremony was about to take place, so he was currently dressed in splendid formal attire.

“It is a wedding ceremony that needs to be held anyway. There will be less backlash if it is done when public opinion is good.”

Lauel looked at Grid’s marriage from a political perspective. He thought that Marie Rose’s strength was essential for Grid. It was after all the events had come to an end.

In fact, he felt sorry for Grid, who said he was going to marry Marie Rose quickly. It was because he witnessed several times what Marie Rose was like. Marie Rose’s evil appearance as she bit Grid’s lips and licked his blood under the guise of a kiss... Lauel would never forget it.

It was the same for Huroi. ‘My poor liege...’

What type of threats did he receive that he was in such a hurry to get married? It was already sad to think that he would be tormented for the rest of his life by the monstrous woman who laughed at the Old Dragons. He was on the verge of tears.

At a time when everyone was worried about Grid for various reasons...

“It is nice to see you.”

“Hello.”

“......”

Grid was scared for a slightly different reason.

It was the moment when he was introducing Irene to his new life. It was already the third time, but he always felt like he was sitting on a cushion of thorns. Furthermore, this time the other person was an Absolute. In fact, he was more afraid of Marie Rose’s inner thoughts than Irene’s. He wondered if she would harm Irene. He was worried and nervous.

Did she know Grid’s heart or not?

Irene spoke with a loving smile as always, “Vampire duke, Marie Rose. I know your noble self well. You have a great reputation. I know that you are a rare Absolute in the world and that you are much older than me. It is right if I serve you wholeheartedly.”

“You know it well.”

Your noble self...?

Marie Rose cocked her head at the unexpected title before slowly smiling deeply.

Her dear husband’s legal wife—she was the first woman her dear husband fell in love with and also gave birth to his child. Marie Rose was going to be respectful to a certain extent. Of course, when she said respect, it meant to guarantee the state of the legal wife and to say some good things.

Marie Rose looked at it realistically. Irene was just a god’s companion and was nothing compared to her, an Absolute. The hierarchy of the two of them could be called the difference between heaven and earth. There would be few such face-to-face meetings in the future.

It happened as she was thinking this...

“However, since His Majesty has welcomed you as his imperial concubine, I won’t be able to serve you. I am afraid and nervous because my rank is higher than yours, but I will be brave and behave properly. I hope we get along in the future.”

“......?”

Marie Rose doubted her ears but she couldn’t react hastily. She didn’t feel any ill will from Irene. It was a truth conveyed by the senses of an Absolute. Irene wasn’t being territorial right now. She didn’t despise Marie Rose, nor was she jealous. It was just that as Grid’s legal wife, the empress of the Empire and the mother of the people, she was aware of herself and behaved properly. As she said, she was squeezing out her courage.

‘...She was originally just a noble of a small kingdom.’

Marie Rose saw Irene’s determined eyes and calculated her position.

Irene—her lineage was inferior to Mercedes, a nobleman and chief knight of the Saharan Empire. She also wasn’t comparable to Basara, who was an empress. However, her identity had changed continuously since her marriage to Grid.

From a duchess to a king’s wife, to an emperor’s wife, and then a god’s wife. She was served in reverse by those she deserved to bow her head to.

Was she happy? Judging from her feelings, she must be more burdened than happy. Even so, she never showed it. She might be very nervous in this moment, but the way her fingertips didn’t even tremble showed how much effort she had put in.

“I like it.”

After Irene’s series of remarks, Marie Rose silently finished weighing the situation and spoke slowly, “Empress Irene, I know your heart. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to behave appropriately. Ah, in addition.”

It was a gentler attitude than expected. Grid was relieved to see Marie Rose speaking unexpectedly softly, only to be nervous again.

Maybe she was going to add that Irene should be careful with her mouth from now on... he had such concerns. It was a guess because he didn’t know much about Marie Rose yet.

“I hope we get along in the future as well.”

The gentle smile she only showed to Grid up until yesterday—Marie Rose had a smile on her face that was captivating to both sexes as she whispered to Irene, “I’ll take good care of you as well as Grid.”

Irene, who almost called out ‘Older Sister,’ hurriedly covered her mouth and nodded. After a while—

“What? Grid is getting married again?”

The surprise announcement of the promotional officer, Huroi, turned Reinhardt upside down. No, it was more accurate to say that the whole world was in an uproar.

The reporters rushed in.

“Is it even a public wedding ceremony?”

They pointed out Grid’s attitude of opening the wedding venue to the public.

“It is an attitude that shows he really isn’t worried about anything.”

“I agree. Later, he will brag about having 3,000 court ladies.”

He wasn’t ashamed of his experience with women but was showing it off. This might be Satisfy and he might be the hero who saved the world, but this was going too far. Of course, the residents of Satisfy would praise it, but it was hard to accept from the perspective of modern people.

Reporters were preparing to use this opportunity to pour out provocative articles when they suddenly stiffened like stone statues.

It was the moment when a woman wearing transparent cotton cloth appeared in the hall. It was a woman whose skin felt whiter than the pure white dress.

The identity of the woman staring at Grid with red jade-like eyes was none other than Marie Rose.

She was the bride.

The gestures of Huroi and the knights as they saluted and shouted for the bride’s entrance were conveying it in real time.

“……”

All the guests were fascinated by Marie Rose’s elegant appearance and only the sound of pens scratching rang through the silent wedding hall. It was the sound of slashing. It was as if the reporters were erasing something.

Breaking news soon poured out.

[The reasons why we can’t help celebrating Grid’s marriage.]

[The bride is too beautiful to criticize Grid.]Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

[This marriage is recognized.]

There was a phrase that people often used to describe Marie Rose—she was the embodiment of the ideal type of all humans.

The reporters couldn’t criticize Grid. They unconditionally sympathized, respected, and acknowledged Grid’s choice. It was inevitable as a human being. If they criticized Grid under the current circumstances, they would just be treated as fools who were jealous of Grid.

Thanks to this, Grid’s wedding was held in a peaceful and blessed manner.
