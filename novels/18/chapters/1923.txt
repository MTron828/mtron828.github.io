Chapter 1923

Nathaniel’s subsequent words caused a series of shocks. Her next words were that the 33 scientists who developed the shocking virtual reality were ordinary until they met Chairman Lim Cheolho.

The source of the rumor that Chairman Lim Cheolho’s initial capital was unusually small was quite reliable. Scholars who had peaked in each field had grasped the construction principles of virtual reality, but were unable to implement it.

Capsule makers couldn’t produce capsules on their own without certain components provided by the S.A Group. There was also the fact that the S.A Group was one step ahead of NASA in discovering Ghamid, etc. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

In the course of researching the S.A Group for dozens of reasons, big and small, she came across a number of cases where the players changed. She dug into them and came to the conclusion that Morpheus was preparing for something...

Nathaniel really conveyed a lot of information to Youngwoo.

“This is all the information I discovered by mobilizing all of my family’s capabilities. I swear on my honor, there is a lot of credibility to it.”

“...So why are you telling me this?” Youngwoo broke the silence and pointed out the most important part.

He didn’t directly respond to the information provided by Nathaniel. He wasn’t sure about the authenticity of the information, nor did he have the knowledge to make his own judgments.

Nathaniel sat on the sofa, took a sip of cold coffee, and laughed. “I told you that I have been watching you for a long time.”

There seemed to be a lot of implications in her words.

Youngwoo realized something. “...Are you interested in me too?”

“Ye... s?”

“Hmm...”

“......?”

Nathaniel’s white face belatedly turned red. She went through a form of embarrassment she had never experienced in her life before. She realized that the interest Youngwoo mentioned was a crush. It was ridiculous. In reality and in Satisfy, he was loved by so many people of the opposite sex that he seemed to have reached the point where he thought every woman in the world loved him.

She was unable to handle Youngwoo’s eyes, which started looking her up and down as if evaluating her. She hurriedly explained, “It isn’t a crush.”

“...I’m glad.” Youngwoo was relieved.

Nathaniel was as beautiful as a doll, but she was too thin. Above all, Youngwoo had Yura and Jishuka. He wasn’t interested in women other than them. Hadn’t he already received too much consideration and forgiveness from them? He wouldn’t be human if he disappointed them again.

“......”

Nathaniel’s eyes turned dark when she was dumped after not even confessing, but it was none of Youngwoo’s business. Nathaniel sighed and correctly the flow of the conversation. “Let me tell you a bit more precisely. It is the reason why I committed the rude action of coming unannounced today after watching you for so long.”

“It is because I was strongly convinced that you would be the main player in any event or era that Morpheus seems wary of.”

“Also, now that you have witnessed Rebecca’s position, I decided that this is the perfect opportunity to convey this fact.”

Youngwoo thought hard and nodded. “...Certainly. If I had met you before I saw Rebecca’s despair after she realized that the world she lived in was nothing more than a game... I probably would’ve dismissed anything you said as nonsense. You came to me at the right time when I logged out.”

“......”

Nathaniel was dazed for a moment. For her, who was born an aristocrat and lived an upper-class life, Youngwoo’s way of speaking was strange and radical in many ways.

“...In any case, I wanted to tell you this even if it meant taking some of your precious time.” Nathaniel adjusted her expression and stood up, her eyes still clear and deep. This was even though she was somewhat shaken by the aftermath of the trauma. “I hope you will calmly respond to any changes that will suddenly come one day.”

This was the conclusion of the conversation. The reason why Nathaniel had come such a long way was finally revealed. The way she lowered her head, as if asking for a favor, was so serious that Youngwoo couldn’t laugh at her at all.

“...I guess the point of change is the day that the asteroid falls?”

“Yes. Of course, it is only a guess. It is impossible for us to figure out the true identity of Ghamid. We can’t know exactly what Morpheus is preparing for until we figure out Ghamid. Everything I told you today could be nothing more than nonsense, to borrow your own words.”

Youngwoo said, “You are quite honest.”

“I don’t have to arm myself with lies when dealing with you. The next time we meet again, you will have to trust me. It is because the day we meet again will be after the change has come.”

“...That’s right.”

Shin Youngwoo nodded silently. For a moment, Nathaniel got a chill. No, if she had to confess honestly, she had goosebumps all over her body from start to finish.

Youngwoo’s restrained movements and breathing were extraordinary. Throughout the conversation today, Youngwoo sat down without showing anything. He never revealed his true feelings. Nathaniel was the only one talking. Youngwoo occasionally added the right amount of words to get all the information he wanted.

Looking back, from the moment when Youngwoo started talking nonsense about her having a crush on him, Nathaniel’s breathing collapsed significantly. She showed her inner feelings to the point where it was somewhat excessive.

‘I was targeted.’ She could vaguely feel the temperament of an Absolute, which she only encountered in Satisfy. On the contrary, she thought that his appearance in reality was more trustworthy and mysterious. She never expected that a person who was always so bold in public situations would actually be this quiet and thorough. She never expected it.

‘Is the personality he shows as Grid, not Youngwoo, a persona he created?’

It could be interpreted as an effort to highlight his human side so that the public and his colleagues didn’t feel distant from him.

Nathaniel smiled faintly and bowed. “Thank you again for your time today. Then I’m going back.”

“Make a proper appointment the next time you come. Then I’ll treat you to a meal. I won’t slam the door on you even if your words today are nonsense.”

“...Why?”

“Aren’t you part of the Overgeared Guild?”

“Haha, that’s true.”

Nathaniel eventually laughed and left.

“......”

Youngwoo was left alone and went about his business as usual. He exercised to maintain his physical strength, chewed his food thoroughly, washed thoroughly, and wore comfortable and clean clothes. He prepared for his turn as Satisfy’s situation was communicated to him in real-time through his logged out colleagues. The information he received from Nathaniel was constantly organized in his head.

‘Lauel will handle it.’

The future that had yet to come—he couldn’t afford to waste his mind on a speculation that was close to a conspiracy theory. For Youngwoo, this was the most important moment. The crisis he clearly identified and the future he had to protect were still in Satisfy.

[Log in.]

The landscape changed. The transcendent sensations that could never be felt in reality were revived.

Grid immediately had insight into the situation.

...No, he honestly didn’t understand anything.

Why was Braham being killed by Chiyou here? Where had the Old Dragons disappeared to when they should be tied up by Chiyou?

At this point, the Trauka subjugation group had just received their compensation. By the time the world message associated with it had flashed up, Grid was looking at the login screen. Coincidentally, the timing was staggered. It was just before the rapidly changing situation was communicated to Grid.

“Again... are you trolling again?”

“......?”

Braham was briefly dazed by Grid suddenly appearing and talking nonsense. On the one hand, he felt unfair and frustrated. On the other hand, he wondered if his choice was wrong.

He had been stabbed by Chiyou.

Grid didn’t sit idly by to let him die. The use of Shunpo and the redistribution of stats were carried out almost simultaneously. Chiyou was hit by the six fusion sword dance. In an instant, the magic activated by Braham traveled through the same time as an Absolute.

Just before Defying the Natural Order reached Chiyou, Braham shattered Chiyou’s self-defense.

“...Huh?”

[Critical!]

[...!]

[...!!]

[.....!!!]

[You have caused significant damage to Martial God Chiyou!]

The damage dealt was unusual. Previously during his fair (?) showdown with Chiyou in Reinhardt a while ago, he slashed Chiyou 37 times. Now he only slashed Chiyou 9 times and dealt much more damage.

“You...?” The way Grid looked at Braham changed.

[The God of the Beginning, Hanul, is amazed.]

The sky of the east was astonished.

[The title ‘One Who Met the Martial God’ has changed to ‘One Who Looks Down on the Martial God.’]

[Ultimate Martial Art has broken away from Chiyou’s influence.]

Taang, taang, taang...

Grid’s Ultimate Martial Art now had the sound of forging, not a bell. Chiyou’s weapon bent like it had been hit by a hammer as he fought back.

Grid’s martial ability didn’t allow the target to be armed. It was similar to a stun in that it caused an inability to fight, but it was much more powerful. It far exceeded the potential that Chiyou had predicted.
