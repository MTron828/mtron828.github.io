Chapter 1892

The dimensional gap—it was famous for being the place where Sword Saint Muller hid for many years. Many of them appeared in the world when Fire Dragon Trauka changed the ecosystem, so Grid was familiar with it.

No, the word ‘familiar’ was wrong. A dimensional gap wasn’t referring to a single place. Just as the stars in the universe were different, so were the gaps in dimensions.

“It is strange in many ways... Squeak,” Bunhelier muttered while entering the dimensional gap opened by the Blue Dragon.

A land that even Old Dragons were unfamiliar with—the dimensional gap was such a place.

“Is this the place where you were trapped? Did you accidentally find traces of light here?”

A space where light was scattered—it was so bright that it was hard to guess the scale. The reflected light added endless colors, making their eyes sore and their minds confused.

Grid speculated that this was the place where the Blue Dragon was sealed.

‘It is said that the Blue Dragon was sealed within the Blue Dragon Dao, but that doesn’t make sense.’

With its resurrection, the Blue Dragon had regained its ‘body.’ This meant that in addition to the soul, the body was also sealed in the Blue Dragon Dao. It was physically impossible. How could such a large body fit into a sword?

‘Of course, the Blue Dragon’s body is made up of divinity and lightning.’

The case of the other Four Auspicious Beasts must be taken into account. The Black Tortoise and the White Tiger had physical bodies made of matter. Nonetheless, they were sealed in a jewel and a spear. They only regained their whole body once they were resurrected.

Therefore, Grid speculated that the place where the Four Auspicious Beasts stayed when they were sealed was a dimensional gap.

-I was sealed in the Blue Dragon Dao...? Didn’t you know?

“How can such a big body be put into a single dao?”

-It is because the magic of the seal performed a miracle. What type of test are you giving me right now...? Ah, I understand. The light here is so bright that it is almost disorienting. You are worried about my condition.

“...That is all I need to know.” Grid was embarrassed that he made a useless guess and got it wrong.

Bunhelier looked suspiciously at the awkward Grid. “Your assumption that I’m mixed race can also be wrong. Squeak.”

“Everybody makes mistakes, but my mistakes aren’t frequent.”

Every time Grid surpassed a strong enemy, he became aware of his position. He had repeatedly vowed to be cautious. He had listened to Lauel’s advice for a long time and witnessed the wisdom of Braham and Sticks many times.

Grid prided himself on now being close to a sage. Based on the knowledge and information accumulated over the years, he was now in the process of expanding his wisdom like a great ocean.

“That confidence... it is sincere.”

Bunhelier saw Grid’s serious expression and no longer spoke.

-This is the place I have been aiming for since the first day I met Hanul. To borrow the words of magicians, it is a place where I never forgot the ‘coordinates.’ I memorized them.

The Blue Dragon recalled the memory of that day.

-As I said many times, Hanul isn’t in perfect condition. Not only did he lose a significant amount of status because of his defeat, but he also suffered considerable internal injuries. Nevertheless, he was nonchalant when dealing with us, the Four Auspicious Beasts.

The Blue Dragon’s fierce eyes became even sharper.

-I couldn’t see a hint of tension when he declared that he would take our land and myths as his own. He was arrogant and leisurely. He subdued the Red Phoenix, the White Tiger, and the Black Tortoise. His attitude didn’t change even when he got to me.

This meant the Blue Dragon was considered equivalent to the other Four Auspicious Beasts.

The story that the White Tiger was defeated by the Blue Dragon several times was insignificant to those noble, celestial gods.

“He was careless. Thanks to that, the trump card you had hidden managed to pierce a hole in Hanul’s chest.”

-Yes, the gods who followed Hanul were also in a very haggard state. Meanwhile, our apostles and the Twelve Zodiacs were fine. It was worth aiming for a reversal. That was when the dimensional gap opened up. It was exactly here.

“......”

The context of the words was strange. Grid had a hard time keeping up with the flow of the conversation. Of course, he didn’t express it. He pretended to understand everything in a calm manner, so that Bunhelier wouldn’t doubt him again.

It was right. His status could be damaged if the Only One God and master of the Overgeared World didn’t understand even one word properly.

‘It is seriously ridiculous.’

He had become infinitely stronger, but he still had many things to worry about. It was a sick worldview...

It happened as Grid, who was finally caught by the concept of ‘status’ that had held him back several times, inwardly lamented...

-Hanul, who opened the dimensional gap, placed his wound here.

The Blue Dragon explained to Grid, who kept his mouth shut tightly.

-It is literally. Hanul personally cut out his wounded chest and threw it here. As a result, his chest developed a bigger hole in it and assimilated into the sky, becoming Hanul, or heaven. I was defeated before I could let out a single breath. It felt like the whole sky was pressing down on me. Hanul, who cut out the wound and ‘removed it’, was close to being complete for a while.

The Blue Dragon guided Grid into the inner area of the dimension.

-It was a very shocking incident. Hanul’s method was incomprehensible to me. I tried to understand it the whole time I was sealed, but it was futile.

Therefore—

-After learning magic from Braham... I decided to personally visit the place where Hanul buried his wound. In order to reach the coordinates in my memory, I repeatedly cut through space and drifted through countless dimensional gaps.

“You reached here at the end of this.”

-Yes. Then I found something amazing. The traces of light that I mentioned earlier.

“......”

Grid’s footsteps stopped.

An unrecognizable scene unfolded before his eyes. Something that was the size of a child’s head—an unidentified object emitted a deep glow from the center of the small space.

It was red.

“A heart. Squeak. Is it really Hanul’s heart?” Bunhelier recognized it immediately.

The Blue Dragon cocked its head.

This unidentified creature—he seemed to have no concept of politeness when serving a god.

-It is right that it is Hanul’s heart. The chest that was cut out when he was hurt was gone, but the one that existed since then must still be intact.

The Blue Dragon didn’t even look at Bunhelier. It treated Bunhelier as nonexistent and explained only to Grid.

Bunhelier interjected again, “The wound on his chest was healed and restored, but this one wasn’t. Squeak.”

“Is it because of that light?” Grid asked as he slowly walked forward.

A faintly pulsating heart. The reason why it emitted brilliance was because of the light that was constantly moving inside.

-I think it is probably Rebecca’s trick.

Bunhelier frowned. “Light can’t pass through?”

Was this really a god’s heart?

Hanul’s heart was ordinary to the point where such questions arose. There was no difference except that it was a bit larger than the average human’s heart. This meant that there was nothing that could be used as a reflector.

However, the light inside the heart didn’t penetrate to the outside of the heart. It hovered inside. It endlessly circulated and destroyed the heart in real time. If it wasn’t for the ‘great divinity’ that filled this space, Hanul’s heart probably couldn’t even maintain its shape and would disappear into powder.

“It is insanely destructive.”

A light that collapsed the heart of a God of the Beginning from within—Rebecca’s divinity, which wouldn’t disappear until it fulfilled its role, came as a shock to Bunhelier as well. To be honest, it was hard to believe even though he was seeing it.

“At this point, Hanul, who survived, is amazing...”

As Bunhelier clicked his tongue, Grid recalled a scene from the past. It was the sight where Yatan, a God of the Beginning, was smashed. He melted into blood as soon as the pillar of light fell. There was literally no other way to describe it other than ‘he was punished.’

‘I have been expecting it since then, but... Rebecca is a monster on a different level.’

Chiyou and the Old Dragons—she seemed impossible to compare even with those who seemed to have no opponents in the world in terms of strength alone.

‘I’m going crazy.’

Rebecca had never directly interfered with Grid’s progress. Even her blessing wasn’t withdrawn...

No matter the reason, he had to be careful not to offend her unless he was crazy. But it was a risk. Grid couldn’t just leave her alone. He needed to figure her out and respond to her somehow. It was inevitable for Grid. His heart was very heavy.

‘I just want peace.’

A world where his loved ones and people could live without worries. Grid’s goal was to create a world where it was okay not to care about the transcendents, who were more threatening than natural disasters. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

...It wouldn’t be easy.

[Do you mean to exterminate the gods and dragons?] Someone retorted after reading Grid’s mental state. It was the owner of this place. He identified not only the intruder, but also his mental state in detail.

-...Hanul!

The Blue Dragon responded immediately. It fired dozens of lightning bolts toward Hanul’s heart. There was no effect. The intangible barrier that surrounded the heart blocked the lightning. No, the term ‘absorbed’ was more accurate.

The place where the heart of an Absolute was recuperating—it was only natural to be fully prepared. It was fully prepared with defenses in place to ensure that nothing would happen, even if Rebecca discovered this location.

[Grid... when you came to the Hwan Kingdom, you were definitely less attractive than the Seven Evils. But now you are an Absolute who rules over a dimension and is discussing the extermination of the gods. The period was only a few years, but it is more like hundreds of thousands of years have passed.]

“A guy without a heart talks a lot. Squeak.”

[Evil Dragon, beware of your words and actions.]

-Evil Dragon...?

[Unlike you Old Dragons, a physical body isn’t necessary for me. Not only can I be omnipotent with just my thoughts, but I can recreate a new body over and over again. That is what a true god is. Something on the level of a mere Old Dragon provoking me is just undermining your own value.]

“Are you pretending to be noble when you are so obsessed with your heart right now? Squeak. It sounds like nothing but a bluff.”

[Obsessed with the heart...? You are greatly mistaken.]

“......?”

[My only interest is the ‘light.’]

The words were meaningful.

It happened the moment Grid’s group noticed something and their eyes widened...

[You have been expelled from the dimensional gap.]

There was a notification window and the group returned to the world they had come from. The remnants of blue lightning flowed through the bodies of the group. It was lightning that closely resembled the Blue Dragon's, but it was filled with hostility and killing intent. They felt it to a high degree. It was enough to burn the skins of Bunhelier and Grid without any difficulty.

-This is mine...?

The Blue Dragon’s voice was rarely trembling. It was shaken when it realized that Hanul had reproduced its power.

“...He is a monster.”

Should he log out? Grid was overwhelmed with a huge amount of fatigue. He was seriously contemplating this when he became startled.

“At this time, is it King Sobyeol? Squeak,” Bunhelier muttered.
