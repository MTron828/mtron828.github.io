Chapter 1894

“......”

Yeoam?gulped.

A person who ascended to the realm of Shangri-La instead of staying as a legend in the world—the Sword Immortal maintained a mental state that was as serene as a polished mirror thanks to his deep cultivation. However, he can't help but feel flustered right now, no matter how rarely he felt that way.

The variables were too numerous.

A realm that had been repeatedly fortified with the power of law to reflect on the past and gain insight into the future—it was difficult to sit by and watch as new uninvited guests came one after another to the ‘sealed place of the yeouiju,’ which had avoided even the senses of the gods.

[It is your karma for not being able to leave the world and abandoning compassion. It wasn’t like you didn’t predict the current situation, but you should’ve prevented the ‘oral traditions.’]

A place that King Sobyeol couldn’t find—Hwang Gildong found this place purely through oral traditions: a story that had literally been passed down from mouth to mouth.?Even the stories that were treated as folktales and ignored by civilians were treated seriously by the Chivalrous Robbers.?Everything had to be thorough in order to protect the people.

Thanks to this, Hwang Gildong was able to guide Kraugel to this place. This caused the current situation to occur.

[I’m grateful for the opportunity.] King Sobyeol sneered as he kept engraving his will on this space. He was mocking?Yeoam’s?stupidity for not preventing the oral traditions because he couldn’t harm people.

[I will devote myself to making up for this mistake.]?Yeoam?didn’t resent the results of his choice. He lowered his head in thought while endlessly searching for a solution.

The arrow that grazed by?Yeoam’s?nose caused another mountain peak to collapse. The sight of the huge rocks scattering was unrealistic. Clouds everywhere were crushed or torn to pieces.

Yeoam?moved like a butterfly within the midst of the destruction. He used the incoming rocks as springboards and repeatedly soared into the sky.?It was to increase the distance so that the uninvited guests, who were messing with the formations, weren’t swept away and injured in the aftermath of the battle.

[You are still stubborn despite reaching this point.] The emotions of King Sobyeol were revealed as he frowned.

A mindset to create results as soon as he developed the intention—there were disadvantages to this even in the realm of an Absolute.

Yeoam’s?power of law read the path of the great bow, which was shooting a violent divinity.?The arrow imbued with violent emotions had a simple side. It couldn’t reach?Yeoam, who had assimilated the discipline he accumulated throughout his life into his body.

King Sobyeol gradually calmed down. [Your breathing is starting to become rough.]

At last, a continuous roar rang out from the fingertips of King Sobyeol as he controlled his mind.?The concept of space?was repeatedly eliminated by the repetitive usage?of his rapid fire actions. It felt like each arrow of divinity was using Shunpo.

Sword Immortal?Yeoam?became isolated in an instant despite using the vast stage of the sky as a battlefield. He would’ve been seriously injured if the amulets around him hadn’t blocked the arrows.?Additionally, his amulets weren’t infinite. They were just consumable items engraved with pictures or characters with shamanistic meanings. It was inferior in comparison to Zik’s runes.

“I was uncertain, but he definitely isn’t an Absolute.” This was Braham’s sentiment. He was very stingy in his evaluation of the Sword Immortal, who was facing an Absolute of the Hwan Kingdom alone while also holding back the Sword Saint of the present era.

Hwang Gildong clicked his tongue. “What nonsense is this person who doesn’t seem like a human being suddenly?saying...?”

The monster who turned this area into a sea of fire with his appearance—for Hwang Gildong, Braham reminded him of all types of legends.

At first, he was so wary that he thought this was the imoogi camouflaging itself.

However, the Sword Immortal was in a completely different world. No matter how great the silver-haired monster was, Hwang Gildong questioned if he was qualified to evaluate the Sword Immortal recklessly.

Braham was adamant. “He is bluffing for some reason.”

Kraugel was also starting to notice it. ‘Certainly... the consumption of techniques is strangely fast.’

Every time King Sobyeol fired an arrow, Sword Immortal?Yeoam?was repeating his countermeasures by stacking several techniques or consuming dozens of amulets.

It was as if he had taken out all his cards and was using them. The?sword energy?and power of law quickly lost its momentum.?It was like risking a war of attrition where there was no profit. It meant he was being pushed in terms of skills. It was hard to see it as a fight between two equal Absolutes.

‘It is a balance that will quickly crumble.’

Kraugel grew impatient. He couldn’t wait for Braham’s flames to destroy the formations that were set up, so he swung his sword.?It was swordsmanship that reversed the magic used by others. He was inspired by?Yeoam, who placed his power of law in his sword energy, and made a new skill using Swordsmanship Creation.

Braham’s brow furrowed. ‘What is this guy?’

Basically, the Sword Saint had an advantage over magicians. In particular, it was right to treat Kraugel as almost a Death God. Kraugel would’ve been quite a threat to him before he regained his power as a direct descendant.

“You deserve to have?Grid’s?favor...” Braham muttered while his expression gradually distorted.?He overlapped other spells on the unfolding Fire Wall. It was a level beyond simply giving attributes and actually changed the principle of the magic. It was as if he could wield this.?It was an obvious provocation. It originated from a competitive spirit.

A problem arose here. Kraugel also had a personality that didn’t shy away from competition.?Blue veins?bulged?on the back of Kraugel’s hand as he gripped the sword.?In the process of continuously changing the gripping method, the sound of finger joints being broken occurred one after another.

“No, what...” Hwang Gildong belatedly noticed the situation and looked at the two of them like they were crazy.

‘Why was Braham the first to arrive?’ It happened as Faker was complaining from the shadows...

Kraugel wielded Twilight, which contained five attributes and seven types of magic, and blew away half of the formation.

The corners of Braham’s mouth curved up. “I am 70%. I won.”

“......” Kraugel’s eyes shook.

Braham urged him to bandage his wrist as if telling him to challenge it again. “Stop fooling around and hurry up. That person won’t last long.”

That person, not that guy—Braham showed rare respect when addressing?Yeoam.

A person who stepped foot on the threshold of being an Absolute by using all the cards he had—in other words,?Yeoam?approached being an Absolute through pure skills alone.

The moment Yeoam accumulated enough?achievements in this almost Absolute state and raised his status, he would be able to rise to a rank similar to Grid and Hayate. It was natural for?Braham?to respect Yeoam.

On the other hand, there was also vigilance.?What if? In the unlikely event that?Yeoam?really harmed King Sobyeol soon. The level of his status would rise dramatically.?It was a result that Braham didn’t want. Someone else would achieve his goal before he did. HIs pride couldn’t accept it.

Braham said, “It can’t be helped. Just take care of yourselves.”

“......?”

A person who was capricious always flustered the people around them.

Braham was like that.

Kraugel and Hwang Gildong were dismayed by the sight of him changing his route and rushing into the battlefield.

On the other hand, Faker was relieved. “Let’s get out of here before he comes back.”

It was an attitude that was?warier?of Braham than King Sobyeol.

Kraugel noticed the reason and blushed.

The distance to the imoogi was rapidly narrowing.

***

The Hwan Kingdom—it was a divine world created and ruled by the God of the Beginning, Hanul. Contrary to Hanul’s ruined state, it once flourished.

King Daebyeol and King Sobyeol, who were active with their great martial arts during the War of the Gods, were still powerful. Additionally, the Three Masters always protected it. The yangbans created to confront the archangels increased their numbers every day.

The prevailing opinion was that it was worth confronting Asgard one day, as long as Chiyou guaranteed the independence of the Hwan Kingdom.

“It is all an old story,” Vantner said vigorously.

There was no denying it. Ever since King Daebyeol fell into hell and Grid set foot on the East Continent, the Hwan Kingdom had been in endless decline.

The yangbans accompanying the Overgeared Guild members right now were proving it. For some reason, the peerless handsome men and women wore agricultural equipment side by side with their equipment.

They were wearing wrinkled and faded clothes like straw mats and were the symbol of the downfall of the Hwan Kingdom.

“They look familiar...?” The people from the East Continent murmured to themselves at the entrance to Kaya.

They were watching the yangbans.

The ones who beat people up could forget, but the one who was hit never forgot. They were only tormented by the yangbans but they didn’t recognize their assailants. That was how dirty the yangbans looked.

“A man named Piaro.”

“He must have a grudge against us...”

The yangbans trembled as they lowered their eyes in shame.

It was after being disappointed by the gods and turning to Grid. For some reason, they fantasized about being farmers and learned to work in the field. Then they suffered greatly for several months.?They had to run all over the agricultural fields until their silk?dopos, which had always been stiff, became completely worn out.

At first, they accepted it as part of their training to become stronger. Then they gradually started to think it was too much. At some point, they suspected that the person called Piaro was abusing his authority to torture them

“Are you doubting the goodwill of the great one?” A man with gray hair spoke up. It was a man who looked drowsy but had a belligerent expression.

It was Hurent, who claimed to be?Piaro’s?protege. He was the one who ignored the yangbans’ opinion that they should tidy up their?dopos?before moving to the east through the warp gate.

“Goodwill? The man who disgraced us in this way isn’t that credible.”

Hurent replied, “Haven’t I repeatedly explained that the clothes covered in sweat and soil are the pride of a farmer? Unfortunately, you are still confused.”

“We have observed human society and found that clothing changes according to the time and place.”

“Farmers are the exception.”

“Aren’t you armed with brilliant armor?”

“This is a gift from Grid. Would you dare to take it off? Stop grumbling and hurry to show us the way.”

The yangbans were half-gods. Regardless of the circumstances of the Hwan Kingdom, they were still powerful. Even the foul-mouthed Peak Sword and Vantner were humble in front of them.?However, Hurent didn’t care and the yangbans didn’t disobey him much. They had struggled together and a sense of camaraderie seemed to have sprung up.

“This way.” Yeum, the head of the yangbans, took the lead. She had once traveled around Kaya like it was her bedroom and she designated a total of nine points.

It was the path that those who responded to the ‘Trial of the Sky’ had to go through in order to reach their destination. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

That’s right. The Overgeared Guild had been wary of Hanul in advance. Hanul had the power to manipulate players and NPCs at will under the pretext of large-scale quests. They had no intention of being hit again after suffering from it several times.

“Good. With this, all variables are blocked.”

Lauel recalled it. It was said that every time Grid visited the East Continent, something big happened.

The yangbans all agreed. It was a spectacle to see them nodding so actively.

Had?their attitude become more vigorous?

With his back to the spire, blackened by the shadows created by the setting sun, Lauel made a shocking prediction. Grid’s trip to the east this time was meant to retaliate against Chiyou for daring to invade Reinhardt.

‘His purpose must be to lay the foundation for the conquest of the Hwan Kingdom.’

‘Run wild as much as you want. God Grid. This time, we will all be together from the beginning.’

‘If we keep Chiyou in check, I think Grid can defeat Hanul...? My shield can hold out a bit against Chiyou...’

Contrary to?Grid’s?plan, things were growing bigger.
