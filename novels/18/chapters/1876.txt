Chapter 1876

‘It isn’t good.’

Grid frowned.

It was because he noticed that the speed at which Chiyou grew stronger in real time started to exceed his own cognitive speed. It wasn’t until Asura’s arms had already been cut off that he could see how fast Chiyou’s swordsmanship had become.

The Martial God—he was getting stronger without knowing the limits.

‘No, I think the word ‘stronger’ is wrong.’

It was only now that he was showing off his abilities little by little.

“...This is what he looks like.”

The members of the Overgeared guild were agitated.

A surprisingly ordinary appearance—they started to recognize Chiyou’s face, which had no special features.

That’s right—Chiyou, who had diminished his presence in order to not be worshiped, was revealing himself little by little. This meant Asura was strong.

“Help Asura.” Finally, Dominion gave orders to the gods of Asgard. It was still a gentle and solemn expression, but Grid thought that he wouldn’t be comfortable on the inside. He might dislike Asura, but he was in a situation where he was forced to help. There was no way he could be happy. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Dominion’s spear intercepted Chiyou’s sword. It was the sword that was about to pierce Asura’s throat.

Asura was feeling relieved when his eyes widened. It was the aftermath of his forehead being pierced. The moment that Dominion intercepted his attack, Chiyou turned and inserted the ink-colored scabbard at an angle. He split the skull of an Absolute like it was tofu.

“Martial God...”Kraugel trembled and drew a simulation in his head. Would it be possible for him to recreate Chiyou’s movements in the previous situation? Impossible. Impossible. Impossible...

“Stop it.” Someone’s calloused hand covered Kraugel’s eyes. They were hands made with tenacity and hard work. The hand, which resembled Kraugel’s one, belonged to Sword Saint Muller.

“The moment you are possessed by him, you will cross a river of no return.”

Possessed by the Martial God—it was an expression that had existed since a long time ago. It was because there were many followers of the Martial God who were possessed by Zeratul’s secret techniques. Additionally, Chiyou’s influence transcended even Zeratul’s.

[The knights of the Overgeared Empire are fascinated by the martial arts of the Martial God. The loyalty of the soldiers toward you is on the verge of being degraded to be worthless.]

The more talented they were, the faster they were possessed by Chiyou. The soldiers with relatively low discernment were still intact, but the knights were greatly influenced.

“Everyone. Strange.”

Jude read the suspicious feeling and attacked the knights without hesitation. The sword was wielded with the real intent to kill and some of the startled knights came to their senses. Thanks to this, the situation that had almost become a mess had calmed down a bit. Of course, not all knights came to their senses. Many knights were still possessed by Chiyou and tried to throw themselves forward for him. Asmophel and the former Red Knights stopped them.

‘There is no need to worry. It is in the range I expected.’

Grid took solace in the fact that players weren’t possessed by Chiyou. He abandoned miscellaneous thoughts. He thought about the best thing he could do and immediately took action.

“Grid-sama?”

Damian, who was guarding one side of the street with the Overgeared members, became taken aback. It was because Grid suddenly seemed to run and leave the battlefield. Soon—

Ttang! Ttang! Ttaang...

The sound of hammering came from the building where Grid had rushed to.

That’s right—Grid took advantage of the fact that this was Reinhardt, in other words, his territory. He made a weapon using the nearby smithy rather than taking out a portable furnace with poor performance. Thanks to this, high-quality battle gear was quickly completed.

Who was the battle gear for? The top players and apostles of the Overgeared Empire had already acquired their final-level weapons. Of course, the battle gear that Grid made now...

“Bring it to them.”

It was for the gods of Asgard.

The God Hands carried the weapons that had just been completed.

“......!”

A god saw the shield shattered helplessly by Chiyou’s sword and prepared for a mortal wound, only to shudder. It was because the shield in his hand suddenly held in his hand completely handled Chiyou’s sword.

“......”

It was like a sword ghost. Chiyou, who was silently swinging his sword to slaughter the gods, took a step back. His momentum had obviously weakened. It was understandable. It was because the original plan to aim for the next target after defeating the god in front of him had gone awry.

For the Martial God, the ‘structure of a fight that goes against my will’ was very strange. It was overwhelming.

“...Overgeared God. Have you remembered your origin?”

Jingle jingle jingle!

Chiyou was smiling slightly when the bells in his ears rang particularly loudly. It was responding to the slightest movements of his facial muscles. It was a scene that showed how sensitive the bells hanging from Chiyou’s body and clothes were.

“You mean those great GPS are worthless...?”

Hurent couldn’t help laughing. The bells were signaling Chiyou’s movements. It was rare for a god to respond properly to Chiyou’s movements.

Caution...

Hurent had been gulping, only to suddenly look at Haster. “Maybe you are the best opponent for Chiyou?”

A genius of sound gameplay—perhaps because they thought it was plausible, but the attention of the members of the Overgeared guild instantly focused on Haster.

“How can that be...”

It was the moment when Hurent expressed his dismay...

A few God Hands flew in, grabbed him by the collar, and carried him to the battlefield.

“Gasp!”

Grid’s whisper flew to the frightened Haster, who suddenly fell in the middle of the battlefield.

-Just try it. Believe in yourself. Your talent is real, right?

“......”

Grid was right. Haster had come to trust Grid more than himself, so he decided to trust Grid again. He closed his eyes and concentrated in the midst of the gods, who were giving him puzzled looks.

“Poor, crazy human,” a god lamented. Asgard might not have helped humans during the Great Human and Demon War and even if Rebecca’s true identity was evil, Haster stood among the gods and realized that the gods were definitely different from demons.

The blessings of the gods poured out. All types of buff effects strengthened him.

-The gods of Asgard have bestowed blessings on humans in order to get a reward for their worship. It isn’t out of any crazy favor. Poor, crazy human. Don’t be mistaken again and again into repeating a false belief.

Aldro, the God of Abundance—he was one of the eight gods who descended to Reinhardt along with Zeratul. He had fought Piaro and won. He had reached out to the fallen Piaro and said he would like to learn fieldwork one day. Now his will poured into Haster.

It was somewhat cynical. However, there was no glimpse of malice. It came as genuine advice.

-The only god you can trust and worship is Grid.

“...Why do you say that?”

-I am just saying what I have seen and felt.

Taking his eyes off a madman whose eyes were still closed, Aldro looked at Zeratul in the distance. It was a face that had lost its poison. He looked good now compared to the days when he was struggling to prove himself and be recognized.

Did he become attached to Zeratul after learning martial arts from him? Aldro couldn’t look badly at Zeratul, who relied on Grid, and took a stance. Both hands were armed with the gauntlets that had just been handed to him by the God Hands.

“Kuek...!”

Haster hastily stretched out his sword. It was toward Aldro’s left flank. Aldro responded. He ignored Haster’s sword stabbing at him and stretched out his fist to the left.

Jingle.

The bell sound that Haster heard earlier rang in Aldro’s ears with a very slight delay.

Baaaang!

Aldro’s fist slammed into Chiyou’s sword.

“Hoh?” Chiyou admired it. He looked at Haster, who blocked his sword, not Aldro. “Did you hear and read it correctly?”

“...Uraaaaat!”

Haster squeezed out all his strength and swung his sword. It was to lift up Chiyou’s foot, which had been pressing down on the back of his sword. It was impossible. It felt like he was carrying a great mountain. The sword didn’t move despite him carrying the blessings of the gods on his back.

Haster changed his plans. He used the authority of the Red Sage to cast buffs on Aldro. Thanks to this, Aldro succeeded in shaking off Chiyou’s sword and linked an attack. He accurately used the martial arts he had learned from Zeratul.

Jingle.

Chiyou’s collar crumpled as a fist brushed against it. No, it was ripped beyond being crumpled. The cause was the claw that stuck out from the back of the hand of the gauntlet that Aldro was wearing.

Haster’s help, Zeratul’s martial arts, and Grid’s item—Aldro was experiencing the Trinity. It was complete.

In an instant, he transcended his limits and slammed his fist into Chiyou’s chest.

“There are talents that bloom at any moment.” It was like humming a song. Chiyou was talking happily as he broke Aldro’s wrist and kicked him in the abdomen.

“......!”

Aldro collapsed without even being able to scream. Chiyou’s sword moved in a diagonal line. It dug toward the neck of the kneeling Aldro.

At this moment—

Ting.

A certain seed flew out and collided with Chiyou’s sword. At the same time—

“Super Growth.”

The rapidly growing beanstalk pushed Chiyou away.

Dominion’s spear, which had been inserted just in time, added its power and forced Chiyou away from this position.

“Farming, I can’t wait to learn.” Aldro struggled to get up and gave a thumbs up. It was toward Piaro’s presence that he felt in a corner of the battlefield.

Braham frowned. “Don’t play petty house games with those you have to kill someday.”

Piaro, who took back Natural State, which had been raised to the extreme, replied with a bitter expression. “At the very least, aren’t we on the same side right now?”

“That isn’t right. In a few minutes, we’ll be enemies again.”

“I’ll cut him at that time. I am a farmer. I thoroughly distinguish between public and private matters.”

“......”

Did a farmer make a strict distinction between public and private matters? Braham, the God of Wisdom, couldn’t say anything because this was an area he didn’t know.

Meanwhile, the battle was intensifying. The gods received Grid’s battle gear that was supplied in real time and the number of times they handled Chiyou’s attacks increased. Thanks to this, Dominion went on a rampage. He focused entirely on attacking and pressing Chiyou.

Asura used this time to finish recovering and joined in. Chiyou’s dopo was repeatedly ripped. Finally, Asura smashed Dominion’s spear into Chiyou’s heart with his foot. A tremendous acceleration was added and it pierced Chiyou’s body.

“......”

The soaring spear attracted everyone’s attention. Dominion’s spear emitted a brilliant glow to prevent the setting sun from reaching it and was clearly conveying something. The Only One God had come to an end here today.

“...Be prepared.” Braham was staring at the limp Chiyou, who was pierced by the huge spear, and ordered the apostles. The knights, who were possessed by Chiyou and came to their senses after seeing Grid’s performance, and the members of the Overgeared guild prepared for battle with their respective forces.

Their targets were the gods of Asgard. As Grid was locked in the smithy and producing battle gear for the gods, Chiyou was defeated and the balance collapsed.

The battle between Absolute was quickly decided as usual. It was probably out of Grid’s expectations. It had to be fixed.

It happened the moment when everyone at the scene was getting ready...

“He suddenly became handsome?”

Peak Sword and Vantner shouted simultaneously while looking betrayed. It was while looking at Chiyou’s face, who was still hanging limp from the blade of the spear. Finally—

Except for Grid, other people also saw Chiyou’s true self. The Martial God was prepared to be worshiped and lifted all restrictions.

“Did you push me this far with a small amount of influence?” Chiyou slowly raised his head, eyes fixed on the building where Grid was located. He didn’t bother to look at the spear that pierced his heart and Dominion holding it. Dominion gritted his teeth and swung the spear. Chiyou was about to be crushed to the ground. But when the spear was thrust into the ground, Chiyou was standing on the spear.

His back was to the astonished Dominion and he fired off a flash of light with his sword. Then Asura’s body was split into dozens of pieces and he hastily retreated. The gods, the apostles of Grid, the members of the Overgeared guild, and the valiant soldiers of the Empire couldn’t close their mouths.

They took a step back. Only Jude rushed in. Jude’s greatsword, which resembled a shark, drew a large horizontal line toward Chiyou. However, Jude didn’t feel anything at the tip of his blade. He suddenly realized that his vision had moved away from the ground and he was puzzled.

Grid’s voice entered his ears. “I told you to cherish your life.”

Jude’s large body slammed into one of the buildings. Grid had grabbed him by the back of the neck and threw him away. It was incredibly fast.

Zeratul, the gods of Asgard, and Dominion, looked somewhat incredulous.

“Martial God Chiyou.” Grid had overcome the limits of speed by going all-in on agility. He arrived in front of Chiyou and then went all-in on stamina. He was fully armed with dragon armor and raised his arms leisurely. “Cut first. In return, I’ll do it next time.”

“It will be an interesting contest.” Chiyou showed interest.

“Ah.” The members of the Overgeared guild sighed.

Between the long, thick fingers of Grid, who was grinning with relief, Doran’s Ring was shining as the cooldown time ended.
