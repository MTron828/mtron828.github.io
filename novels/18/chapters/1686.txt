Chapter 1686

The quiet city was roaring with noise. It was due to the blue light that shone around Mir’s body. The white snow pouring down burned out without touching the ground, leaving only a bit of moisture behind. Additionally, the area where the electricity spread grew larger each time. It felt like Mir himself was gradually becoming bigger.

It was the effect of Lightning God. Mir’s body was completely assimilated with the energy of the Blue Dragon and became made up of lightning, not bones and flesh. He was truly a god.

The sound wasn’t heard until after the action was over. Grid was already under attack by the time the lightning seemed to flash. It was a surprise attack from the Lightning God who literally ‘pierced’ through the camp of more than 300 God Hands.

The Blue Dragon Dao, which stretched out like an incandescent long line, was blocked by a white beam of light. It was the traces of the enhanced Magic Missile that Grid hurriedly fired. Lightning God was immune to all physical attacks, but was vulnerable to magic attacks. It couldn’t resist magic at all and suffered twice as much damage. However, the power of Magic Missile itself was low. This prevented it from damaging Mir, but it was significant because it blocked Mir’s attack.

“......?”

Wasn’t it absurd when a ridiculous magic became the barrier that stopped a god’s advance?

Mir was startled and his next move didn’t connect. It was a gap of less than 0.1 seconds. Grid could take full advantage of that time.

Twilight soared through the gaps in the fragments of the Magic Missiles that collided with the Blue Dragon Dao and scattered. It was a blow that soared in a diagonal line. Then it moved in a lateral line the moment it reached the target. It was a feast of lines that seemed to go on infinitely, the Link sword dance.

“......”

Mir’s expression that could be seen between the blue lights that shook every time the sword wind swept over it was calm. He searched for Grid’s gaps with the confidence that he wouldn’t be cut by the sword.

It was just before Grid recovered the Twilight that had been extended. He wielded the Blue Dragon Dao the moment Grid’s ribs were clearly visible.

Seeing through the weak spot. An attack there would induce a critical hit. However, it stopped just before reaching Grid. The lightning that was making up Mir’s body dissipated without a trace.

It was due to Twilight. It was an inevitable result. Lightning God was the power of the Blue Dragon and Twilight had a high probability of neutralizing the power of a target. It was Mir’s mistake in neglecting the dozens of sword strikes of Link. The moment the Lightning God body was released, Mir received a large cut to his shoulder and immediately pulled up the power of the Red Phoenix. The deep wounds were healed by the heat of the Red Phoenix and a rain of flames poured down from the sky.

Grid was naturally the target.

“......?!”

Mir was about to cooperate with the rain of flames, only to stiffen like a stone statue. The flames that reached Grid didn’t burn him but instead burned his wounds. The other nobles clearly witnessed the sight of the small traces Mir’s lightning left on Grid’s body disappearing without a trace.

“The heart of the Red Phoenix...” Mir muttered after realizing the reason.

Grid’s head was tilted at an angle. His sharp eyes, which were like a bird of prey, became even fierce as he looked at Mir, who was a bit taller than himself. He realized that the scar he had left on Mir’s face in the past was no longer there.

“As expected, you are a fake.”

Don’t hesitate and let’s kill him...

“......!”

A chill went down Mir’s spine at Grid’s words and he leapt forward. The ground on which he had been standing rushed like waves. It was the effect of Earth God. The ground, which turned to mud due to the snow melted down by the lightning and flames, changed shape in response to Mir’s will. He rotated 180 degrees, flipping Grid’s view upside down and pouring out sharp stones. Was this how it felt to be surrounded by giants? The cliffs that soared from side to side pressed down toward Grid.

Grid swapped items. He took off the armor bearing a dragon’s name for the first time in ages and equipped the armor bearing the name of the White Tiger. He activated the effect of Earth God and calmed the trembling ground. Mir’s attempt was unsuccessful.

“The Mir I knew didn’t rely on the power of the Four Gods.”

Mastering the power of the Four Auspicious Beasts perfectly—it was Mir’s greatest strength. However, the reason why Grid felt a ‘wall’ when fighting Mir was due to his swordsmanship and other techniques. Even if Baal’s magic power was infinite, would he have been so strong if he just wielded his magic power? Baal was strong for countless reasons and it was the same with Mir.

However, today’s Mir was different from the past. He neglected his skills as if he had forgotten them and only relied on the powers of the Four Gods. He was now fighting against Grid, who knew how to deal with the power of the Four Gods.

“No matter how much I think about it, you aren’t Mir. There is no way a guy with an empty head like you is Mir.”

Grid’s words and actions became violent. It was natural. It was difficult for his words to come out beautifully from the time he was suddenly attacked. There was also a creepy hypothesis that made him feel uncomfortable. The yangban were existences made by Hanul. It wasn’t strange if the old Mir was wiped out without anyone knowing and a new Mir was created...

Grid thought up to this point and his expression gradually distorted with anger.

“You started from a human life and can admit that you aren’t perfect. To you, it isn’t shameful, but is natural. I have no doubt that you will be reborn as an alarm for the other gods. You will probably change many things in the future.”

“You are my hope.”

“I hope the gods can be an existence to truly rely on.”

“We might be enemies when we meet again in the future. Putting aside my support for you in my heart, the authority to move me is usually with the god I serve.”

“However, today I am on your side.”

Grid was reminded of Mir’s previous words. He stood protecting Grid and honestly confessed his true feelings in his heart as if he thought he might die. The reunion of this moment would take place after that day.

Mir wouldn’t stare at him with this expression unless he forgot what happened that day.

Grid took a deep breath, barely held back his vomit, and opened his mouth, “The Mir I know… where is Mir?”

There was no more mercy. Grid struck Mir, who had ignored the question and entered the Lightning God state again. He approached using Shunpo while using the six fusion sword dance with Twilight, which invalidated the effect of Lightning God and made it difficult for Mir.

The image of Mir being caught by the grappling technique and thrown to the ground made Grid realize it. As expected, this person wasn’t Mir. If this was the real Mir, then Grid would be the one thrown to the ground right now.

Grid gritted his teeth. Once again, he was swallowing his vomit.

From birth until now—Grid felt pity for Mir, who had devoted at least hundreds of years to the gods of the Hwan Kingdom only to be abandoned. He felt dizzy and his stomach was churning because the gods of the Hwan Kingdom were so disgusting. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The world is full of sons of b*tches!” Grid shouted as he pressed his knee against Mir’s solar plexus while holding his sword in reverse.

The killing intent that came from confusion and anger were pouring toward the fake Mir. Mir didn’t resist. From the moment he was hit by the six fusion sword dance, he had been bound by hundreds of God Hands. Furthermore, he was beaten and held down by Grid.

Now he had reaffirmed that it was meaningless to assimilate with the energy of the Blue Dragon. The only way he could overcome the crisis was to use the White Tiger’s energy to strengthen his body. Of course, even this was likely to mean nothing. The sword with the sunset had already cut off the power of the Four Auspicious Beasts several times.

‘What god is he?’

Mir had his memories erased by the gods of the Hwan Kingdom. As a side effect, he lost the experience he had accumulated over the years and Grid was a completely unknown being to him.

He thought of the famous Crazy God and Crazy Dragon based on the armed dragon weapon and dragon armor, but it was only for a moment. It was because Crazy God and Crazy Dragon was a myth that was only completed when the Overgeared God boarded a dragon. Additionally, the presence in front of him was much stronger than the Crazy God and Crazy Dragon depicted by the three masters.

“You... who are you?” Mir asked as if he was vomiting hard.

Grid crushed him every harder as he struggled to shake off the approaching Twilight and replied, “The one who remembers the real Mir.”

To be precise, he was the one who remembered Mir’s true feelings. The true feelings that no one would know in the future.

Grid used Saleos’ Power. He held onto the blade of Twilight with both hands as Twilight was slowly moved toward Mir’s neck. He found out that Mir was a fake, so there was no reason to hesitate. He judged that killing Mir quickly and recovering the Blue Dragon Dao was beneficial to his mental health. Just then—

“Stop!” A woman’s urgent cry was heard. Her name was Yeum and she ran out from among the yangbans who were in a daze. She was Mir’s close confidante that Grid knew. “He is the real Mir...!”

“......?”

“He was taken away by the three masters and his memory was erased. He isn’t a fake!”

The person who was really shocked was Mir, not Grid. How far did his thoughts go after he heard Yeum’s confession? He made a sad expression and released the strength from the hand that was holding the blade of Twilight away from his body.

“......!”

Yeum’s eyes widened and she swallowed down her scream. She clearly captured the scene of the sunset sword penetrating Mir’s neck, which was lying on top of the mud. Liquid where it wasn’t known if it was mud or blood scattered in all directions.

“Ah... Ahhh...” Yeum sank down to the ground. She sobbed while feeling sorry for her brother who had died with the loss of his precious memories.

The yangbans standing silently on the tiled roof left immediately. They ran away out of fear they would be caught up in Grid’s anger.

“Is there a way to bring back this friend’s memory?” Grid asked Yeum, who was left here alone. Twilight hadn’t pierced Mir’s neck. It only slightly brushed against Mir’s neck and was stuck in the ground.

Mir couldn’t refuse the hug of Yeum, who rushed over to him with relief, and muttered with a stunned face, “Fri...end?”

A smile slowly spread on Grid’s face as he spoke bluntly, “To be precise, you were my lifesaver, although I just cleared my debt. In any case, give me the Blue Dragon Dao first.”

He couldn’t hide his joy after knowing that the Mir in front of him was the same as the Mir he knew.

[’Mir’ has handed over the ‘Blue Dragon Dao’ to you.]

Mir’s memory loss ultimately worked in Grid’s favor. He easily secured the Blue Dragon Dao, which wouldn’t have been handed over so easily if it was the original Mir due to his sense of duty.
