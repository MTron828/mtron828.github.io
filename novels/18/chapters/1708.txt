Chapter 1708

“I didn’t know they would attract external forces.”

“It is really unusual this time. Catherine’s party was leading the defense force, but they were quickly logged out.”

“Pushing us this far...”

Currently, there were only three Yatan Servants leading the Yatan Church. Additionally, they were all players. It was against this backdrop that the Yatan Church became an ally of the Overgeared Guild. The players moved based on rational judgment, rather than the position of a Yatan Church member. They followed the trend without being swayed by Amoract, who claimed to be Yatan’s agent. They kicked out the existing servants, who cooperated with demons using their arbitrary interpretation of faith, and instead cooperated with Grid.

In fact, it shouldn’t be happening. The religion worshiping God Yatan instead followed the Overgeared God, who had nothing to do with God Yatan. It wasn’t a joke that the current Yatan Church wasn’t the Yatan Church, but a branch of the Overgeared God Church.

However, the Yatan Church cooperated with Grid to the end and easily suppressed the backlash that arose in the process. It was because most of the Yatan Church members were already players. The existing Yatan Church members could hardly resist them. In other words, Morpheus’ strategy of attracting people with all types of rewards to raise the Yatan Church, one of the few opponents of the Overgeared Guild, actually brought down the Yatan Church.

Yet at this moment, a reversal happened. The church members who lost the faction fight and were kicked out succeeded in returning in a brilliant manner. An unidentified army of undead troops helped them. It was a powerful army where a lich and death knights were common.

The name that came out of their mouths was the ‘No Offspring Tomb.’ It was a tomb so huge that it was difficult to find. They were vague rumors that there was no way to know if it was a tomb or not because the magnitude was like a mountain range.

The thick ceiling made of carved stone collapsed with a loud roar. The Yatan Servants got up immediately and cast magic.

The players who were the Yatan Servants, including Yura and Rose—all those who became a Yatan Servant were outstanding. The same was true of the Yatan Servants of the present day. Based on the characteristics of the invaders who broke through the ceiling, they quickly figured out the attributes and skills the invaders would use. They avoided the surprise attack at a level close to prediction and launched a counterattack.

-Ughhhhh! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The death knights coming from the ceiling fell like they had been electrocuted. Their souls separated from their bodies after being hit by the black magic and they couldn’t handle the shock.

“It is the first time I’ve seen something like this...”

The Yatan Servants couldn’t laugh even after subduing five death knights in an instant. It was because the number of additional death knights coming from the collapsed ceiling was a huge 100. There was even a death knight standing proudly with crossed arms on the ceiling. The name of the man wearing the blue cloak was colored, which meant he was named. The modifier ‘Sword of the No Offspring Tomb’ that was attached to the front of the name was very annoying.

“What is with all these bumpkins guarding the tomb all of a sudden? Who will protect the tomb if they go out as a group?”

Most players still didn’t know the horror of the myth usurpers. They never dreamed that the monsters of the No Offspring Tomb would often go out hunting for human gods. Therefore, the Yatan Servants were even more flustered and resentful of this situation. Sword of the No Offspring Tomb ignored their cry and spoke.

-Kill them, all.This place will be used as an outpost for hunting the human gods.

It was a year with a good harvest. Faint divinities were sprouting up all over the continent. The newborn human gods were usually just easy prey. There had never been a human god who properly handled the power that had just blossomed.

A strong human god regardless of the power? Such a thing was hard to exist. Usually, human gods weren’t born because they were strong. They were born because they had outstanding achievements or were worshiped by people.

I will collect all the rookies’ status and offer them to the specter...

A sly smile spread across the faces of the deceased who had a glowing blue light in their eye sockets.

***

Sariel—the basis for her/him was ‘justice.’

She was upright enough to reveal the original sin of the gods and hold them accountable. She was banished from heaven and stigmatized as a fallen angel. She lost her memories and wandered through hell and the Abyss for many years... She had never regretted her choice. She had the belief that the justice she adhered to would be helpful to some good beings.

This belief was still firm. As Sariel prayed in front of the statue of the Overgeared God, her divinity covered all of Reinhardt and she could sense evil intentions. It was impossible for an ordinary human being to deceive her senses, which revealed even the original sin of the gods. Thanks to this, Reinhardt’s security always remained at its maximum. It was a rare scene that couldn’t be seen in any other city in the world, meaning that the crime rate was close to zero.

Evil beings infiltrating Reinhardt without her knowledge? It was impossible.

[The feathers of Sariel will guide you.]

Players from the security force were busy following Jude. They searched specific places following the ‘guiding feathers’ that had been hard to see for the past few months. Every once in a while, they encountered suspicious intruders. They were beings that clearly existed and moved, but didn’t breathe.

The undead—Jude’s greatsword pierced the purple aura that symbolized the sword energy of the dead. Thanks to this, the players avoided an ambush and gave a thumbs up in admiration.

“As expected of the captain!”

Grid’s first knight—his fame had declined a lot compared to the seven apostles and the 10 meritorious retainers, but Jude was still one of the symbols of the Overgeared Empire. He was at the level of destroying a field boss monster alone, and the shark-shaped greatsword he wielded was famous as a work Grid had personally created.

“Jude. Body is light.”

Jude was naturally named.

After breaking through his limits several times, his stats that were blocked by a glass ceiling were soaring without an end. Tirelessly... no, to be precise, Jude’s personality that was constantly training without getting tired combined well with his named status, showing a tremendous synergy.

However, his growth was only just beginning. It still wasn’t enough. Moreover, the invaders were hunters who played an overwhelmingly active part behind the scenes of the world. They were those who hunted the gods.

“J-Jude!”

The shocked players shouted loudly when Jude was hit by a thunderbolt that fell. Jude’s thick limbs flinched as they were burned black. Due to his low intelligence, his magic resistance was so low that it was difficult to cover even with items. He might be strangely powerful when it came to mental attack magic, but magicians were generally bad opponents for Jude. Additionally, the magician’s identity was a named-class lich, so the fight itself couldn’t be established.

-As expected of a nation established by a god, the military is excellent.I didn’t expect a general-level person to be dispatched immediately.

The lich witnessed Jude surviving even after being hit by the great magic and responded with a bit of surprise. The name of the person with a red light for the eyes was Lopero. He had the modifier of ‘Small Staff of the No Offspring Tomb.’ At the same time that he appeared, he released a wide-area debuffs that caused the players to fall into the fear, futility, and uncontrollable magic power abnormal conditions.

“Kuoock...”

Jude didn’t fall to the end. He held on even though his eyes were white and his mouth was foaming.

-You are strong enough to seem like you aren’t human.

Lopero’s red eyes became sharp. He seemed to be frowning.

-Well, it is fine.If it is a person like you, we can sit down at the negotiating table right away.The thing we want is simple.It is human gods staying here.If you hand them over, we’ll back off.

Myth usurpers were those who hunted divinity. They naturally denied most divinity. The same was true of Lopero, who served the Specter of the No Offspring Tomb as his master. However, he wasn’t completely free in front of the divinity of the Overgeared World. The divinity that spread throughout the continent around Reinhardt felt dirty and painful to him like poison.

Fortunately, he had gained some resistance by damaging a few statues of the Overgeared God recently, even if it was only a temporary measure. He wanted to hurry up and finish his mission to return to the No Offspring Tomb and be comfortable.

“Jude... don’t know... human gods... don’t know...”

-Is your brain damaged?

Lopero felt repulsed by Jude’s slow, awkward tone, and drew dozens of magic circles around him. He was sent in consideration of the fact that the seven apostles of the Overgeared God were his enemies. He had a level that could lightly overwhelm anyone, let alone a single human. The leader of the Overgeared God Church might’ve been annoying, but he had been lured to another place.

-I will have to visit the palace.I have gone off course.

It happened as Lopero’s magic was triggered...

A warm wind seemed to blow and the tiles of the main street shook. Eventually, a large amount of golden wheat grew between the cracks. It was Asmophel. He was the strongest number two, and he naturally became stronger when the number one got stronger. Now he arrived at the scene.

Today, Asmophel used Piaro’s techniques very naturally. It was to the point where he could reproduce some of the faint divinity that Piaro had recently built up.

Lopero’s eyes flashed.

-Apostle of the Overgeared God.You must be Piaro among the apostles.You must’ve been one of the ones who recently started to sprout as a human god.

Things were going really well.

-I need to secure you first.

Lopero grinned and summoned a large army. Hundreds of high ranking undead rose from the ground and destroyed the golden wheat field. The spearmen riding on the bone beasts larger than elephants were particularly threatening. However, it was meaningless. It was because they were annihilated at the same time that they appeared.

“Space Sword.”

-Sword Saint...?

In the center of the ground that was split in half, Lopero almost had a seizure as he watched all the troops he summoned being cut to death.

-Why are you here...?Muller, that boring guy is still here...!

“Go easy on the ground!”

“I’m sorry...”

Lopero’s shout was buried. The current Sword Saint was busy apologizing to the goddess of the earth and wasn’t even looking at him.

-Even Garion...this is good...

It happened as the flustered Lopero activated magic again as if he was trying to show off his presence...

“This guy is mine.”

A swordsman broke in. He was a blind swordsman with long scars covering his eyes. It was the so-called disciple of Muller. He was a transcendent who persistently pursued Kraugel, who had returned after purifying the Elemental World.

It was only some time after he drew his sword that a thunderous roar spread out. The surroundings were already devastated.

The swordsman confronted Kraugel’s sword and smiled bitterly. “It is nice to see you again. This time, I have to take Master’s secret technique.”

“You can’t see this sword.”

“......?”

Kraugel’s words were out of context.

The conversation subtly diverged from the point. The blind swordsman felt suspicious and stepped back in a panic. It was after his sword was damaged due to being interlocked with Kraugel’s Twilight.

“What do you mean by the sword? What swordsmanship did you use?”

“...It is being overgeared.”

It was the first time in history—a swordsman was discussing items, not swordsmanship.
