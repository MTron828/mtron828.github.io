Chapter 1816

“How did you notice that he was fake?”

The noise that had been ringing in Biban’s hand as he gripped the giant sword stopped. The last struggle of the giant sword stopped. The guy who had been twisting his big body to escape Biban’s grip was unable to leave Biban’s hands and lost consciousness.

Unity. No, the expression ‘returning’ was correct. The intent in the form of a giant sword merged with Biban’s intent. Now the giant sword was part of Biban. In any case, It was originally Biban.

“Even I was fooled.”

Biban’s eyes were filled with interest and admiration as he asked Grid.

Around two hours ago. At a time when it might’ve felt like years to Grid, Biban clearly sensed that Grid was following him. It was a presence that followed immediately every time he used Shunpo. It definitely contained Grid’s divinity. He naturally thought it was Grid. He recognized that he was searching for the giant sword with Grid.

This was until he heard an explosion. It was only when he heard sounds in the distance that he looked back in surprise and saw that what was standing there was a doll, not Grid. It was a doll made by the giant sword who acted like a master in Biban’s mental world. It had the appearance of Grid and contained his divinity, but it had no expression. It was also strange that it didn’t respond to the commotion.

It was only then that Biban understood the identity and situation of the doll and hurriedly rushed over. Then he was surprised to find Grid, who was overpowering the giant sword. How did Grid figure out the identity of the giant sword that looked exactly like him? It was a difficult question to answer.

Grid simply replied, “There is no way I wouldn’t recognize you.”

“...Hah.”

In fact, he had been fooled. If the personality and manner of speaking of the giant sword hadn’t resembled ‘Biban before becoming a Sword God,’ Grid wouldn’t have noticed the identity of the giant sword until the end. Still, did he really need to tell the truth? Grid calmly hid the truth to prevent Biban from being upset and to protect his prestige.

“That’s right. Our relationship is quite special. If I was in your shoes, I think I would’ve noticed it right away.”

Biban also hid the truth for the same reason as Grid. He didn’t bother confessing that he had been fooled by the fake Grid. It was consideration for the other person and a bit of bravado. The two of them were close to a match made in heaven.

The unity of their mental worlds was easily accomplished. Grid wanted to get out of here quickly, so he immediately opened the Sanctuary of Metal and the mental worlds merged as if it was natural.

“Then I will start.”

Grid took out the hammer and anvil and activated Intent Production. Trauka’s bones and scales and Biban’s intent were the materials.

Biban nodded and helped out. Biban’s sword energy was added to the flames in the furnace that melted Trauka’s bones and scales.

Flames of sword energy—it went through the preliminary work of polishing and crushing Trauka’s bones and scales, not just melting them. It was close to imprinting a sharp shape. The red molten iron that eventually melted and poured out had a sharp edge like a blade. It was hard to imagine how sharp it would become when it was completed as a sword.

Taang, taang, taang!

Grid forged it while consulting with Biban in real time. It was a collaboration between Grid—who inherited the skills of the Blacksmith God, Hexetia—and Biban, the Sword God. It had to be completed in the most ideal form.

However, the form of the sword that gradually took shape was far from ideal. It was out of line even with the usual standards. The shape was so incomplete that he wondered if it was even a sword. The blade seemed to be split. The blade scattered a cold glow rose smoothly from the handle before it seemed to cut off midway. The sword that Grid and Biban painstakingly completed was broken from the start.

“...Are you really okay with this? The imprinted sword energy during the smelting process has become useless at best.”

“It is perfect.”

Grid was worried, but Biban’s expression was bright. A short sword that seemed cut in half. He showed a very satisfied reaction as he held it and swung it, the tip of the blade forming a straight line. He seemed to have returned to the past. The way he smiled and swung the sword that had been cut in half made him look like the swordsman with dementia.

[Broken Sword]

[Rating: Only One

Durability: 9,200~???

Attack Power: 13,060~???]

Grid double checked the information of the completed sword. The stats were so disastrous that it was hard to believe it was a dragon weapon. It was because the form was incomplete. It wasn’t judged as a complete sword. The stats were low even though the materials used were the bones and scales of a dragon. There were even no additional effects.

It was a glaring failure. A passing dog would recognize it as a failure. However, the truth was different.

Grid slowly accepted reality. ‘This isn’t a failure, but a treasured sword among treasured swords.’

The true value of Broken Sword could be summed up with a single line. It was explicitly stated in the description following the item information.

[A sword created by Only One God Grid in a state of mental world unity with Sword God Biban.

It uses the bones and scales filled with Fire Dragon Trauka’s intent and the intent of Sword God Biban as materials, and it was forged with the flames of sword energy.

It is a sword that responds to the will of Sword God Biban and its length and power can’t be measured.]

The length and power couldn’t be measured. It meant the length and power followed Biban’s will. It resembled Defying the Natural Order, but it was different. It was like Defying the Natural Order when Grid swung vertically or horizontally, stabbed or straightened it, etc etc. It responded to Grid’s will by taking an optimized shape according to the situation.

On the other hand, Broken Sword grew the moment Biban wanted it. That was all. It was much simpler, but it was unpredictable.

“It has a great feeling when holding it in my hand. It seems to be wrapping itself around me“.

It was a sword that completed the blade with the will of the user (Biban). From the perspective of the creator, Grid had to put the greatest effort into the handle. Grid felt rewarded at the sight of the delighted Biban and urged him, “Try swinging it. Shouldn’t you test the performance?”

“In front of you? I’m afraid it won’t catch your eyes...”

“No way. You are too humble.”

“Then I won’t hesitate.”

Biban turned to one side of the wilderness. It was in the direction where a rock was placed. The distance was 500 meters.

Biban aimed the broken sword toward it. He didn’t close one eye or control his breathing, but he vaguely resembled Yura when she aimed her gun. Just then—

Flash!

Broken Sword increased in length. For a moment, it took the form of a giant sword. The rock that stood 500 meters away was already split in half.

Grid belatedly noticed it. Biban’s target wasn’t a single rock. The other rocks lined up several kilometers behind the rock were simultaneously split and destroyed, proving it.

‘Crazy.’

Biban wanted to slash the entire body of the dragon, not just its neck. Grid realized it and trembled. Biban stabbed his sword again and again, wide-eyed. It was a sight where it wouldn’t be strange if the entire wilderness was split apart.

However, the sword wielded by Biban only slashed precisely at its target. Even if Grid stood in its path, it wouldn’t harm Grid. It was possible with the power of the Sword God.

Biban’s huge sword only slashed what Biban wanted.

“This makes me feel invincible...” Biban murmured after testing the performance of Broken Sword many times, “Can I lose when wielding this sword? It is like struggling over a seemingly minor problem. Of course, the story would change when fighting against an Absolute.”

"That’s right. Those who can’t be cut must surely exist.”

“...Once you reach this point, the level of enemies you assume you will meet is too high. How have you endured it all this time?”

A sad expression flashed across Biban’s face as he cautiously asked.

The Absolutes of hell and heaven—Grid had been prepared to confront them even though he clearly knew their level. It couldn’t have been tolerated with ordinary mental strength. It was brave that he didn’t run away.

Grid laughed.

“I was able to endure it because there were people like you.”

Hope existed in a hopeless reality. It was a bond for Grid. He had endured it by always reminding himself that there were many beings to rely on.

“From now on, I will rely on you even more.”

“That’s right. I’ll pay for the meal.”

Their two hands met. The sound of the hands with hard calluses colliding was surprisingly soft.

***

Grid and Biban came back to reality side by side.

He had even made armor. The Fire Dragon Armor belonging to Biban was a deep gray mixed with the energy of a Dragon Slayer and the color of sword energy. It was less beautiful compared to Hayate’s pure white armor, but it gave a sense of intimidation. It might be because Biban had developed muscles and shoulders, unlike Hayate, who looked somewhat thin and weak.

“It is amazing no matter how many times I see it.”

Hayate’s gaze alternated between Broken Sword and the Fire Dragon’s Armor as he greeted the two people.

Works made in the mental world—originally, it was impossible to take it out into reality. However, it was materialized through Intent Production and came to exist in reality like this. At this point, he thought it was right to say that nothing was impossible for Grid.

“Did you have any problems?” Grid asked while wary of his surroundings.

Evil Dragon Bunhelier was in the room directly opposite them. He shouldn’t forget that no matter what happened, it wouldn’t be strange.

“It just so happens that Bunhelier’s mood has changed.”

‘As expected.’

Grid’s sharp eyes shot up. The opponent was an Evil Dragon. An Evil Dragon. It was highly likely that he suddenly changed to have a black heart.

“His magic power is vibrating violently. Is it a precursor to great magic?”

Biban felt suspicious as well and prepared the Broken Sword. Grid and Biban were ready for battle in an instant. At the same time, the door burst open without permission. It was a disturbance caused by the invader who didn’t know fear, or to be precise, didn’t need to know it.

It was deep night before they knew it.

Bunhelier’s face popped up in the darkness that filled the hallway. His pure white face was pale like a corpse.

“You don’t know how to knock, do you? After all, there is no need for an Absolute to learn the laws of insignificant human beings.”

Grid pointed out Bunhelier’s attitude. It was while assessing the strength of his allies, which had risen sharply compared to the morning. If Bunhelier went on a rampage right away, it would be difficult, but it was possible to subdue him. The key was to not lose sight of him.

‘If Biban makes good use of the Broken Sword’s capabilities, he might be able to stop Bunhelier from escaping...’

It was the moment when Grid calculated this and pulled out Defying the Natural Order.

“The laws of humans.”

Grid’s eyes resembled a bird of prey, while Bunhelier’s eyes resembled that of a snake. It was even sharper.

Bunhelier stared at the three of them with these piercing eyes and slowly opened his mouth, “I will learn them from now on.’

“......?”

It was bizarre nonsense.

It happened the moment Grid was flustered and lost concentration...

“Do you know about the origin of the half-draconians? I’ve said in the distant past that I gave birth to them using a drop of my blood, but that is a complete lie. I was so ashamed, but now I will reveal the truth I have been hiding... they are the result of me mating with human females.”

Bunhelier’s nonsense continued. A series of question marks rose above Grid’s head. It was difficult to immediately understand the context of the conversation.

Bunhelier started to add an explanation as if he considered Grid’s position. “I... I used to love human females. The shameful past that I wanted to bury forever... I am confessing this to gain your trust.”

“......”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I can live with human beings. My instinct to love human females is the proof. If there is one dragon you can trust, it is me.”

Bunhelier had been thinking in a troubled manner in Hayate’s office, only to become shocked during the process.

Toward the end of the day—in other words, in less than half a day from Bunhelier’s perspective, the aura of Hayate and Biban had rapidly intensified. At first, he thought it was an illusion. It was such an unrealistic event. However, this was reality. He just checked it with his two eyes.

The armor worn by Hayate and Biban, and the strange sword held by Biban—all of them were threats to Bunhelier. At this rate, he really had to worry that he would die like this. He regretted the choice to go to the tower.

Then he put an end to his troubled thoughts. He recalled that due to the karma he had accumulated, he had been reduced to a state where he was unable to stand in heaven or hell. The only ones he could rely on were the humans on the surface. Therefore, Bunhelier declared, “From now on, we are companions.”

“......”

Really?

...But why did he want to do it?

Putting aside Grid’s confusion, there was a rare sincerity in Bunhelier’s declaration. The energy of Dragon Words that started to flow in the atmosphere was the evidence.
