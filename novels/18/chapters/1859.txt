“I see...”

The reason for giving birth to Marie Rose.

How Noll died.

Grid’s expression was cold when he learned all about the atrocities committed by Beriache. He didn’t feel any sympathy or regret for her disappearance. He even blamed himself for trying to respect her as his mother-in-law when he met few a few hours ago.

However, Braham was on his mind. He was sure that Braham would be sad.

‘...But he will recover soon.’T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Braham was the one who blocked Beriache’s path before anyone else. He held back his mother despite respecting and loving his mother, and resenting and hating Marie Rose. He was the first to notice that she was on the wrong path and denied her.

“By any chance, can you resurrect the other direct descendants?”

Grid was bothered by Noll’s dark expression and changed the subject.

The vampire earls Elfin Stone, Cray, Yetima, and Ruson; Marquis Fenrir; and the viscounts Tiramet and Latina—they had died and were attached to their respective artifacts. He wondered if they could also be completely resurrected like Noll.

“Of course. But it isn’t good for you, so let’s stop here.”

Marie Rose seemed to care that her immediate relatives had a bad relationship with Grid. She nodded that she could do it, but reacted negatively.

Grid didn’t really care about it.

“It is fine. They completed their education well...”

The bridge of the nose of the direct descendants was as high as Braham’s, but Grid was the exception. Now they shuddered and were humbled at the mere sight of Grid. Even if they were completely resurrected, it was unlikely that they would rebel against Grid again. There was no point even if they rebelled. It was because Noll and the other vampires wouldn’t sit back. Every vampire city in the world had long been Grid’s territory.

“Education?”

Noll tilted his head innocently.

Marie Rose spoke to Grid, who was stroking Noll’s head, “If you are trying to understand the moods of Noll and I, then there is no need. They are your property, dear husband. I don’t want to take them away from you. We will be satisfied if my dear husband keeps them by your side and uses them.”

Now Marie Rose didn’t hesitate to use the word ‘we.’ Today, she experienced loneliness and solitude through Beriache, and love and sacrifice through Grid and Noll. She felt many things. It awakened all types of emotions. She felt like she was human. Grid looked at the changed Marie Rose with satisfaction and shook his head.

“I can’t use them even if I want to. In the first place, they can’t help me at all.”

The direct descendant vampires—the enemies who brought a crisis to Grid in the past were different now. They were infinitely weak compared to Grid’s opponents and couldn’t help him train at all.

In a word, they were useless. It seemed much better to revive them so they could contribute to the development of the vampire cities. If they were respawned now, they would get the named NPC correction and overcome the Curse of Sloth.

The Curse of Sloth—the powerful curse that had been imprinted on the bloodline of the vampires and suppressed them was naturally extinguished as hell was purified.

“Yes, that makes sense.” Marie Rose nodded. She realized that there was no exaggeration in Grid’s frank words.

“I’ve experienced them myself. They were useless in life.”

“......”

The conversation between Grid and Marie Rose kept making Noll feel uneasy. He was finally turning to leave when he stopped.

“But if they are resurrected and live a life free of curses and obligations... I think it will be different from before.”

Freedom—it was a concept that none of the vampires had never enjoyed in their life, except for Braham. Looking back on it now, Braham had been blessed when he was banished from his clan.

“I also think the same.”

The Absolutes of the surface nodded and the direct descendant vampires were given a new destiny. Their consciousness that had been confined in the small space of the artifacts was pulled out into the world and given complete bodies. It was a miracle done with Marie Rose’s blood.

“This...”

The direct descendants immediately grasped the whole situation and were flustered. They had something in common. They hated or were jealous of Grid and Marie Rose. Yet they were revived due to the goodwill of these two existences.

Their feelings were complicated in many ways. There was an awkward silence for a while and it overshadowed Noll’s best efforts to be delighted.

Surprisingly, it was Elfin Stone who broke the silence some time later.

A being who hated the entire fate of his blood relatives after losing his lover to Braham—he had faced life with the most skeptical eyes among all his immediate family, but now he smiled, no matter how faint. It wasn’t a smile twisted with malice, but a comfortable and kind smile. It was the first time that his siblings, as well as Grid, had seen it.

“Thank you. Also... you’ve worked hard.”

Elfin Stone sent genuine respect and gratitude toward the opponent he had hated for a long time. It was the appearance of an elegant noble. His other siblings chose to imitate him.

All the direct descendants, including Fenrir, got down on one knee and bowed to Grid and Marie Rose. It wasn’t an act from succumbing to violence, but out of respect from the bottom of their heart. The death of their mother wasn’t a matter of importance to them. In the first place, their mother’s self-inflicted death was her own scheme and they had always longed for the future, not the past.

The evidence was that Braham was the only one who sought to avenge Beriache.

[Hell has been purified and the vampires who have overcome the curse are deeply grateful to you.]

[Your affinity with all the direct descendant vampires has risen to the maximum.]

[The speed of development and production for all vampire cities will increase significantly.]

[Prime Minister ‘Lauel’ has raised the tax rate of the vampire cities to 37%.]

‘What is Lauel’s reaction speed...?’

The purified hell was still exerting its influence in real time. It was like a gift package that hadn’t been fully unwrapped. It was going to give Grid more benefits in the future.

***

In the very distant past—at the height of the war between the Seven Good People and the gods. Fearing that the surface would be destroyed in the aftermath of the war, the giants sought to ascend to heaven. Their intention was to appease the wrath of the gods by presenting precious treasures. However, even the flying ships made by the giants couldn’t handle the heat of the sun. In the end, the giants couldn’t reach heaven.

At that time, the god who helped was King Daebyeol. The arrow shot by King Daebyeol hit the largest of the three suns and knocked it down. Thanks to this, the flying ship carrying the giants was able to ascend to heaven.

It was a myth that modern day humans didn’t know. This was a true story that Filewolf, a survivor of the giants, saw and experienced.

According to Filewolf, King Daebyeol was a very good god. He was the only one of the gods who didn’t ignore the crisis on the surface and helped humanity. The price was brutal. All the gods condemned and opposed King Daebyeol. They harmed him with one heart and one mind.

As a result, King Daebyeol lost his power, was exposed to Baal, and reduced to a mass of red flesh.

‘What a poor being.’

The myth of King Daebyeol had a bad ending in many ways. Not only did King Daebyeol himself meet a bad end, but the giants who ascended to heaven with the help of King Daebyeol angered the gods instead of appeasing them, and perished.

The Seven Good People—then the Seven Malignant Saints, were defeated and sealed in the war. Above all, King Daebyeol already had enemies in hell at that time. Therefore, he was weakened and exposed to Baal. In other words, he suffered throughout his life because he was born with a good heart, which was rare among the gods. Thus, even more—

“We have to stop him,” Zik affirmed from the front.

He looked more pained than the wounded King Daebyeol. King Daebyeol had no choice but to be special to Zik. He was a being who was of more help to his colleagues than himself, one of the Seven Malignant Saints.

Zik sincerely respected and felt sorry for him. Therefore, he thought that he shouldn’t stand by. If King Daebyeol went to the Hwan Kingdom or heaven like this, he would only suffer greater pain. In his weakened state, he would be mocked and die, rather than achieving revenge.

Mir’s thoughts were the same. As a native of the Hwan Kingdom, Mir also knew the myth of King Daebyeol. He stood beside Zik and pointed his sword at King Daebyeol with red eyes. It was while looking at the flowers that King Daebyeol’s divinity made bloom.

They were beautiful and fragrant nurturing grace flowers.

Mir learned that they were flowers made from the divinity of King Sobyeol.

He was taught that humans realized and respected the greatness of the gods thanks to King Sobyeol filling the ground with nurturing grace flowers.

Then King Sobyeol became disappointed with the incompetent and greedy nature of human beings and withered all the nurturing grace flowers from a certain day onward. Since then, humans forgot their respect for the gods and became even more ignorant.

Now that he saw it, everything was false. In the first place, the nurturing grace was a flower made by the divinity of King Daebyeol. The nurturing grace flowers on the surface disappeared because King Daebyeol fell to hell.

“Forget everything and be born again. You will always be great no matter how many times you are reborn. You will definitely be happy. I will surely find and take care of you, who have been reborn.”

He didn’t dare say that they would live together in the Overgeared World. The wounds inflicted on King Daebyeol’s body and mind weren’t at a level that could be easily healed. It was clear that he would never escape from the shadows of the past no matter how many beings, including Grid, comforted and soothed him. That was why he needed to start over.

“”I am too angry and bitter to leave like this...””

King Daebyeol only repeated the same words. He didn’t react no matter how much respect and favor Zik and Mir showed him. He was already blinded. He was only obsessed with the past. He was more like a soul than a god.

“Be careful of the pollen.” Biban gave advice in this solemn atmosphere.

The group responded immediately. They spread out in all directions away from the petals that were fluttering in the wind. The widely scattered petals and pollen became the things that connected the divinity of King Daebyeol. The divinity that flowed around King Daebyeol’s body took over the entire battlefield.

“This is already the domain of King Daebyeol. It is correct to interpret it as a physically embodied mental world.”

It was a horribly ruined mental world. King Daebyeol instinctively distanced himself from his mental world. It was because he didn’t know what type of monster would be born. Thus, he created a flower garden and built an area similar to a mental world in the middle of reality.

It was a ridiculous ability. The days when King Daebyeol was intact even though he had fallen to hell—it was understandable why ‘all the gods’ harmed him with one heart and one mind. Maybe they were wary because he was incredibly powerful.

“”First of all, I will see my little brother.””

King Daebyeol declared and released a huge amount of divinity. The flood of divinity shot in straight lines, diagonal lines, and curved lines toward the pollen and petals that filled the battlefield, dividing the battlefield into tens of thousands of areas.

“Kuek...!”

Kraugel groaned as he cut the approaching divinity with his sword. The burning pain from his hands was secondary. He witnessed the serious injuries of the Overgeared members who failed to avoid the divinity that flew in unpredictable directions and he became properly aware of the seriousness of the situation.

Strong...

It wasn’t at a level that the party, exhausted from repeated battles, could handle. Even the apostles could only protect themselves and Biban was still unable to fight. He was trying not to show it, but it was speculated that he was seriously injured.

‘I need to solve it.’

Kraugel felt an obligation. Unlike the rest of the group, he was the only one in an intact state because he had only fought Madra’s soul. He judged that he should make use of his relatively intact physical strength to face King Daebyeol.

‘No matter how strong, he is still short of his prime. He is just a soul body.’

Far from being an Absolute god, he was probably one level lower than Martial God Zeratul. There was no need to be too intimidated by this fraudulent ability to spread out his divinity widely and use it as a weapon...

Kraugel thought this far and immediately charged forward. He narrowed the distance to King Daebyeol and scattered a sword light. He tried to block the flood of divinity to allow the rest of the group to see an opportunity.

Blood gushed out. It was blood that poured from Kraugel’s body. The fight against a being that wouldn’t fall no matter how many times he was cut made Kraugel one-sidedly exhausted.

What was Grid thinking when he fought Baal?

It was the moment when Kraugel and Pagma, who were one, became solemn at the same time...

-Bend down!

Then he heard someone send him a whisper. The purified hell highlighted the players’ strengths.

Freedom of communication and freedom of movement.

Jishuka, who died and returned to the surface, returned with reinforcements. It was a tremendously large army. It was an alliance led by almost all of the members of the Overgeared Guild and the kings of the different species. There was also Ares’ army flying the flag of Valhalla.

“Protect the heroes!” Asmophel’s shout as he commanded the soldiers was heard. The former Red Knights also led the elites of the Overgeared Empire into war.

It was the final stage.

The Breaking Evil Arrow shot by Jishuka grazed by Kraugel’s ear and pierced King Daebyeol’s chest. King Daebyeol didn’t even flinch. He didn’t seem hurt at all. It was natural. In the first place, the Breaking Evil Arrow came from King Daebyeol’s divinity. The ‘unknown shrine’ where Jishuka obtained the Breaking Evil Arrow in the past was a shrine that served King Daebyeol in the distant past.

“”This...?””

Jishuka shouted to King Daebyeol, who was surprised to recognize the identity of the arrow in his chest, “King Daebyeol! There are still people who haven’t forgotten you and are serving you! I am one of them!”

“”......””

“We... we will surely get revenge for you...!”

It was before Jishuka’s cry was over.

The beautiful petals and pollen disappeared, leaving only the scent. The divinity that dominated the battlefield in the form of a spider’s web was almost lifted like it had been a lie.

“”Thank you. Thank you...””

He wasn’t forgotten. It brought great comfort to the great god, who had fallen to the ugliest form against his will. As it was, there was no way his revenge would succeed if he went to the Hwan Kingdom or heaven like this...

It was a strong hope for him, who knew this, but had no choice but to push himself.

“”Thank to you, I can close my eyes.””

King Daebyeol pulled the Breaking Evil Arrow from his chest and took out a huge bow. Even though he was an archer who shot down even the sun, he hadn’t taken out his bow until the end. This was the first time he took out a ‘real weapon.’ The Breaking Evil Arrow was placed on the bowstring pulled by King Daebyeol and fired at Jishuka.

“Eh? Huh?”

What? Didn’t he thank her?

The Breaking Evil Arrow penetrated the heart of the confused Jishuka.

“Jishuka!!”

It happened as her colleagues screamed out of shock from the development that was different from their expectations...

King Daebyeol shook off all his lingering feelings and jumped into the river of reincarnation.
