Chapter 1874

The archangel prior to Raphael—they told Braham that they didn’t know the name Beriache. Additionally, when they descended to the ground and faced Grid for the first time, they were amazed that this world was different from the first world.

Metatron had been around for a very long time. Unfortunately, it was long enough to witness or experience the Old Dragons in person.

‘It must be Nevartan.’

Even from the position of someone who served the Goddess, Raiders gave off a strange pressure because he was mysterious and dignified, but there was the impression that he was worthy of confrontation. It was also judged that there was a good chance of winning against Bunhelier.

On the other hand, Nevartan had something that was hard to fathom. It was rumored that he had been ruthless and powerful even before he was reduced to an Insane Dragon, but he was stronger after becoming the Insane Dragon. This meant Metatron couldn’t approach hastily.

‘...But now the insanity has been cured.’

The death of Baal was the trigger. The curse that had been engraved in Nevartan’s mind was extinguished. The essence of Yatan, which had served as the basis for the spell, evaporated when it ceased to play a role. It was the result of Baal’s arrogance in not predicting his own death. He didn’t do it thoroughly.

Thanks to this, they were able to see the benefits. Metatron saw Nevartan’s two huge eyes that contained cunning and had a smile that didn’t suit their fierce and hideous face.

‘Let’s be grateful that it isn’t Trauka.’

I will be qualified as a Dragon Slayer and have the power to confront Chiyou...

Flash!

A beam of light shot from Metatron’s eyes. It was to offset the snort that Nevartan exhaled. The angel’s halo emitted a bright glow in the chain of destruction caused by the collision of fierce energies.

Hundreds of magic circles appeared in the sky that was darkened due to Nevartan’s shadow. Nevartan failed to stop it. There were 213 shining magic circles. They were all pre-arranged traps. Metatron had completed the magic circles with the possibility of attracting the attention of an Old Dragon. They completely concealed the traces of the magic circle while inwardly waiting for a dragon to fall into the trap.

It was a few months ago. On the day they descended to the surface and met Grid for the first time, they predicted what was going to happen when they mentioned an Old Dragon openly. Metatron took advantage of the fact that the hearing of the Old Dragons extended across the entire surface. They deliberately targeted the Old Dragons.

Then today—

Metatron was convinced that Chiyou’s appearance would have awakened the dragons, and allowed Chiyou’s blow to hit them. They naturally left the scene that would soon become the battlefield of the gods and ended up alone. They created an environment where it was easy for them to hunt their prey.

In other words, the appearance of Nevartan was an event that took place within Metatron’s expected range. Technically, it was an expected development.

“”I was about to give up because I thought you weren’t going to show, so I’m grateful. This is also the grace of the Goddess.””

The ultimate in divine magic at its finest—the giant Nevartan was bombarded with divine magic that not even the God of Magic, Braham, could reproduce, for it was divine magic that could only be embodied by those who worshiped the Goddess.

Every single spell was faith. It contained the wishes of those who served the Goddess, and it was a doctrine. It had a weight that overwhelmed the usual rules of magic.

Nevartan’s magically unfolded shield was smashed. That was it. The dragon’s self-defense wasn’t just magic. Metatron might’ve drawn out exactly 213 magic circles in advance, and even achieved a Trinity with that, but it wasn’t enough to pierce the magic power and scales of an Old Dragon in a single shot.

Metatron also knew it. Their 18 pairs of wings vigorously waved at the same time that the magic was cast, and they were already in Nevartan’s vicinity.

Defeating an Old Dragon and the Martial God—Metatron had signed a contract with Judar on this condition and was in an intact state. Their speed and strength were unparalleled after freeing all their wings and regaining the freedom of their body. The speed of inserting a blade into Nevartan’s heart was comparable to that of Chiyou, who was ‘somewhat weakened by erasing his presence.’

However, there was a problem. The opponent was too bad.

[The prestige of the Old Dragons has dropped. I also contributed to the situation, so I don’t want to blame the others. It is just that at this point, my anger is rising.]

Up to the point when Nevartan went insane, the Old Dragons symbolized invincibility. Either because they were afraid or because they were dirty, even the arrogant gods of Asgard didn’t dare make eye contact with an Old Dragon. The majesty of the Old Dragons was so absolute that even the Goddess finally asked for a truce.

Yet when Nevartan woke up from his insanity, things had become ridiculous. The majesty of an Old Dragon was so low that even a mere angel treated them as prey to be hunted. The biggest culprit was naturally Nevartan. Nevartan himself was aware of it.

From the time he fell prey to the demon’s machinations and fell into insanity, there must’ve been a crack in the dignity of the Old Dragons. There was no use making excuses for being deceived by Bunhelier.

Yes, he admitted that he set the stage. However, that was just a trigger. It was right to say that the reason why things got to this point was the others, not him...

[What happened while I wasn’t in my right mind? Could it be that Raiders had a duel with the gods due to his obsession with the gods? Or was it Bunhelier, who wasn’t confident in himself, fell for Baal’s deception, whispering good words to demons and relying on them?]

“”......””

Metatron watched in vain as the sword inserted in Nevartan’s chest was trapped in a crack in the scales and broke. They were speechless for a moment. It was the aftermath of feeling great admiration. As expected of Nevartan. As the owner of a cold personality, the level of reasoning was high.

—Although reality was worse than Nevartan’s speculation.

[...It doesn’t matter. It is a broken prestige. I just need to restore it from now on.]

Nevartan’s black scales started to glow. Not only was it dyed white, but surprisingly, it exuded divinity. It was Metatron’s divinity. The 213 divine spells that had just bombarded Nevartan bloomed from Nevartan’s scales. It was the moment when the Black Dragon’s ability to absorb and utilize the attributes contained in magic was maximized by Nevartan’s unique power.

This—

It was a terrifying sight for Metatron. However, Metatron didn’t shrink back. They felt more anger than fear.

“”How dare you blaspheme my divinity.“”

The source of Metatron’s divinity was Rebecca. They felt a strong hatred for Nevartan, who recklessly took and wielded the power of the Goddess. They growled like a beast and had a fierce expression, but Nevartan just snorted like it was ridiculous.

[Angel of Contract. You don’t know yourself. The reason why you are bound by a contract and have many restrictions is different from what you think.]

“”You are trying to mislead me with your words.””

Metatron scoffed. The reason why they covered their eyes and ears with 18 pairs of wings and sealed their limbs was simple—it was because they were afraid they wouldn’t be able to control their mighty power. It had been like this from the moment they were born. It was a safeguard made by the Goddess herself. There couldn’t be any other reason.

Nevartan told the truth to Metatron, who believed this.

[No, you are deeply mistaken. The reason why Rebecca put the conditions of a contract on you is because you are a fool who doesn’t understand the subject.” Considering Rebecca’s personality, she didn’t want to see her creature go out on a rampage and die pitifully.]

“”Kukuk...!””

Metatron couldn’t resist laughing. This time, it was clear mockery.

When Chiyou, who sided with Hanul, left Asgard—some gods questioned the Goddess’ choice of creating Zeratul rather than liberating Metatron. Through these reactions, Metatron was convinced. They deserved to face Chiyou. It was a belief that wasn’t shaken even after facing Chiyou in person today.

Therefore, anything Nevartan tried to say sounded like nonsense.

“”The Old Dragons... Trauka avoided confrontations with Chiyou even in the days when he was running wild. The prestige of the Old Dragons has been on the decline since then. The incident where Raiders toured human restaurants and Bunhelier had a love affair with humans aren’t decisive causes.””

Metatron had been around for a very long time. After being removed from their position of archangel, they had turned their back to the world. Still, they knew what the Old Dragons were doing. This was why they had been thoroughly investigating ever since going out into the world recently.

That’s right—Metatron was obsessed with the Old Dragons. One of their ultimate goals was to destroy Trauka, who brought shame to the Goddess through the pact.

“”Do you understand what I mean? To use your vulgar tone, it isn’t me who can’t grasp the subject. It is you.””

[......?]

Nevartan’s already huge eyes widened even more. It felt like seeing two full moons up close. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Nevartan tilted his head. The repercussions were huge. The clouds dispersed without a trace and a terrible storm raged.

[I can’t put it off any longer. I have to settle things with Trauka.]

“”......?””

Why did it end up this way? This time, it was Metatron’s head who tilted. It didn’t matter whether it was true or not. This wasn’t in Nevartan’s interest. In his mind, he wanted to crush that winged bug at once and get rid of it from in front of his eyes.

...But it wasn’t easy. It was true that Metatron was strong, unlike an angel. It was inevitable that he would have to spend time trying to kill Metatron. In the current situation, it was an unnecessary loss.

Nevartan completed the calculations and turned around. He showed his back to Metatron. Metatron was about to aim for this gap that was momentarily revealed, only to stop. They hesitated.

Nevartan—he possessed both magic power and brute force that was on a different level from Bunhelier. He might be less dignified than Raiders, but he had a charisma that was hard to ignore. In Metatron’s own experience, it was comparable to Trauka. It would be a loss if they fought hastily at this stage. To tell the truth, it was hard to get a glimpse of the odds.

[Be grateful that I didn’t declare that I would kill you.]

Dragons were creatures that valued vows very much. If Nevartan had said, ‘I will check your skills’ to Metatron. If he had declared that he would harm Metatron without saying much else.

Nevartan would’ve definitely killed Metatron.

[Additionally, keep this in mind. If you hurt Grid... then you will die.]

Metatron compared themselves to an Old Dragon. Yet Nevartan, who said he would step down without causing harm, cared immensely about Grid’s safety. It was an attitude that seemed to value Grid more highly than the honor of an Old Dragon.

Why? Metatron didn’t have any doubts. Nevartan’s insanity was eventually cured thanks to Grid. Apart from that, Metatron was aware of Grid’s value.

“”I will respect him forever as long as he doesn’t tarnish or threaten the honor of the Goddess like Chiyou.””

[You will die soon.]

It happened the moment when Nevartan about to leave after spitting out these meaningful words and snorting...

[Die! Nevartan!]

There was a sharp cry and a flash of dark light flew in. It was a Breath. It was the Breath of Evil Dragon Bunhelier.

At this moment, the expressions that Nevartan and Metatron made were similar.

Baaaaang!

The Breath collided with Nevartan and caused a powerful explosion. The surrounding mountains and rivers evaporated.

[Kuhaha! As expected, it didn’t stop you! Arrogant bastard! Do you think I am the same as before?!]

Originally, it was the standard to offset a Breath with a Breath. However, Nevartan hit it directly with his body. It was because he judged Bunhelier to be several levels below him. This was exactly what Bunhelier expected, and it was a huge opportunity.

[Angel over there, cooperate with me in exchange for me sparing your life. If we join forces, we can hunt Nevartan. He is relatively weak because he is still stuck in the past.]

Due to his madness of many years, there was a gap in Nevartan’s time. He couldn’t develop because he couldn’t sleep or accumulate magic. On the other hand, Bunhelier had grown significantly. He also enjoyed a tremendous rise in status in exchange for killing Baal together with Grid.

The conclusion was that there was a good chance of winning. It was right to deal a surprise attack first rather than wait for Nevartan’s retaliation. It happened to be a good way to collaborate with a very powerful angel.

“”......””

However, the angel’s response was very shaky. It was a look like they wanted to avoid it rather than cooperating.

Bunhelier laughed.

[This Nevartan was persistent even when he was insane. Even if you run away from here like this, you will be tracked down someday. So cooperate with me. That is the only way for you to live.]

“”...Can’t I just leave?””

Metatron didn’t bother with Bunhelier. He just looked at Nevartan, who was covered in smoke.

It was the moment when Bunhelier became displeased and frowned.

[Bunhelier. I tried to understand the crimes you have committed against me. I understand your position, since you were born weak alone and have low self-esteem. I couldn’t forgive you, but I didn’t intend to kill you... at most, I planned to cut out your heart and chew it in front of you...]

A gloomy voice rang out. It was filled with Dragon Fear. The fish and monsters fluttering on dry land due to the evaporated river immediately died.

[But I’m going to have to change that plan.]

A magnificent sight unfolded. It was a scene in which two Old Dragons, who were bigger than a great mountain, intertwined and fought.

Metatron was a bit overwhelmed by the sight of monsters crushing each other’s scales with their claws and biting each other’s necks with the teeth that were harder than claws. Gradually, they were swept away. Metatron had to get out of here quickly, but the impact of the battle was so strong that they were stranded in a daze.
