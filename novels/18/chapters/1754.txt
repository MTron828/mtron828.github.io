Chapter 1754

The position of an apostle of a God of the Beginning was definitely great. It made one wonder how many higher hierarchies existed in the whole world. Nevertheless, it was rude to limit the Specter to just an apostle of a God of the Beginning. 

A place where an enemy of the surface caused it to be reborn as a separate dimension—the Specter that set up this No Offspring Tomb, which resembled the Overgeared World, was definitely unique and an Absolute. 

In the first place, there were dozens of myths that she had usurped. It was right to see her as special among the gods. 

The problem was that in Satisfy, a god didn’t mean an omnipotent being. It didn’t matter how great the Specter was. Additionally, she might’ve been the one to build the No Offspring Tomb, but it was impossible for her to understand everything that was happening in the No Offspring Tomb in real time. It was just like Grid. 

Moreover, this incident occurred outside the No Offspring Tomb, not inside it. How could she figure it out in advance and defend when the No Offspring Tomb was deep underground and it was being bombarded from above? 

‘What type of ignorant power is this?’ 

The Specter’s emotions had long been worn out. It happened naturally after enduring eons of time. However, at this moment, she was upset. Throwing hundreds of meteorites from a ridiculously huge airship? The destructive power of each meteorite was comparable to hundreds of artillery shells. 

Due to the overwhelming mass, the distance of hundreds of meters between the No Offspring Tomb and the surface was being overshadowed. It was because the strata that had been tightly deposited over the years was collapsing helplessly. 

“You… it is a pity in many ways.” 

The lonely eyes behind the mask—the Specter stared at the unfamiliar moonlight for some time before confiding her honest feelings. She felt very regretful about Grid’s versatility, who provided Muller with thousands of new swords and even operated a super large flying ship. 

“It isn’t to the extent... that I don’t want to kill you. The years you have accumulated are similar to mine. If you have tasted deep despair... you would be able to sympathize with my ideology... you would’ve gladly joined forces with me.” 

“......”

Grid didn’t respond. It was because he felt the true heart of the Specter. He was afraid he would feel sympathy if they exchanged a few more words. 

‘She is crazy.’ 

The ideology of the Specter was twisted. The purpose of purifying hell was purely noble and it was true that it would be beneficial to humanity if her purpose was fulfilled. It was just that the method was wrong. To put it mildly, she was the same as Pagma. She was even an upgraded version. She was someone who he should never sympathize with. 

Then the ceiling, which had been damaged by the meteorites, was quickly repaired. The moonlight that was falling like light on Grid gradually faded. 

The No Offspring Tomb was a world of ghosts. As long as the Specter’s will refused it, there was a limit to destroying it through physical means. 

“Jishuka.” 

Once again, the setting sun fell on the world encroached upon by darkness. It seemed to use Grid as the horizon and rose from Grid’s fingertips. It was Twilight. 

“Let everyone except for Ruby and the 10 meritorious retainers escape.” 

The power loss would be too great if hundreds of Overgeared members were wiped out here.

“Yes.”

Jishuka didn’t doubt Grid. Surprisingly, she had an obedient side like a puppy. She used a demon-like expression that Grid didn’t show to urge her colleagues, who were feeling that it was a pity. 

“I don’t have the hobby of harming humans. Even if you invaded my territory... even though you slaughtered my subordinates...” the Specter spoke in the busy atmosphere.

There is no need to rush, so don’t get hurt and leave slowly. 

At first, it seemed kind, but no one was fooled.

“You tried to kill Huroi.” 

In the end, Peak Sword criticized the Specter’s attitude as a pretense. 

“That human deserved to die.” 

The Specter confirmed it and her consciousness once again focused on Huroi. Huroi got the aggro unwillingly and he glared resentfully at Peak Sword. Grid ran through the wide space and approached the Specter, swinging Twilight. The rising Twilight that followed the movements of the sword dance was blocked after several collisions with the Specter’s dark club.

“If my plan fails to be carried out... humanity will suffer worse than destruction.” 

Craters occurred on the ground around where Grid stood. Did some of the meteorites that bombarded the Tomb of the Gods squeeze through the ceilings and fall? Some of the Overgeared members had such absurd thoughts. 

The spectacle created by the power of the Specter slamming the club was that unrealistic. 

‘Did she feed Beriache’s corpse with her own blood?’ 

Grid remembered the monstrous power that was released from the little girl’s corpse and broke out into a sweat. He tried to smile to pretend to be composed, but he was gritting his teeth so tightly that he ended up with a twisted smile. 

The Specter didn’t smile. 

“Don’t worry. Maybe I... I can’t kill you.” 

The ghost’s dark divinity was intertwined with Grid’s orange divinity. It was like the feeling of a hand digging. The Specter’s power of an usurper was examining the history of Grid’s divinity. It was like it was wondering what to eat first. 

The agony lasted for a very long time. It was because some of Grid’s myths were incredibly great. The life that Grid had experienced flashed through the Specter’s mind. It was a short life like most human gods. It could be compared to a mayfly. However, it was very dense. It was to the extent that it was equivalent to a life accumulated over thousands of years. 

‘...I can’t take this away.’ 

The Specter took back her club. The pressure that had been weighing on Grid’s entire body was released like it was a lie. 

“You have also seen and experienced a lot of despair.” 

It was natural. Originally, Grid’s life was marked with despair. He just didn’t get frustrated and got up every time. He even caught a glimpse of the truth of the world. 

The distorted hell—he was obliged to restore hell for his beloved wives and son. 

Heaven who stood on the sidelines—Grid was determined to rescue his precious person who was being exploited by the arrogant gods, who didn’t do anything. Of course, it didn’t mean that he suffered greater despair than the Specter. To the Specter, hell was everything and her pride. 

To put it bluntly, the Specter was an entity who had been deprived of everything. Her position was much worse than Grid, who might have everything taken away. The future of the ‘failed Grid’ was the Specter. Nevertheless, the Specter respected Grid. 

Apart from the total amount of despair that Grid suffered, she was deeply impressed by the way he cut the neck of a half-god while declaring that he would rather become a god. He lit the last flame of the dying fire dragon and became a Dragon Knight, allowing his immense potential to be seen. Didn’t Chiyou guarantee it? 

“Even after going through so much despair... you still can’t sympathize with my ideology?” 

“Yes. From my point of view, your way of doing things is wrong.” 

Grid stretched out the Blockade that was held in his left hand. 

A dull sword—it had a form that was purely faithful to the function of a sword. It amplified the power of basic strikes while having the effect of accumulating skills in proportion to the number of times it blocked the enemy’s attack. It was the latest divine sword made in preparation for the battle against Zeratul. 

[Blockade] 

[Rating: Myth 

Durability: Infinite  Attack Power: 15,880  

★ Increases the power of normal attacks by a minimum of two times to a maximum of five times. 

★ Every time an attack hits an enemy or an enemy’s attack is blocked, the ‘tempered’ effect will be obtained. However, it is limited to a single attack and the effect is reset when the target of the attack is changed. 

★ The accuracy rate is decreased by 30% for targets of a certain level or higher. 

★ The skill ‘Up to Here’ is created. 

A divine sword made by Only One God Grid to target Martial God Zeratul. 

The learning effect was maximized by giving free authority to Greed, which was used as the material. Greed’s own judgment is sometimes a disadvantage, but in terms of potential, it might surpass all other divine swords. 

Conditions of Use: Grid 

Weight: 1,900] 

[Up to Here] 

[Passive. 

Every time the sword is ‘tempered’ 30 times or more, it randomly blocks on enemy skill based on the accumulated information. Prioritizes the blocking of persistent passive skills. 

Duration of the blockage: Random.]

Blockade was a divine sword that opened up new possibilities for Grid. 

Items with free authority—it was made experimentally, but it had more effects than he expected. The disadvantage of moving contrary to Grid’s will often wasn’t very fatal. If Blockade went against Grid’s will, it was because it carried out the habit of ‘defending Grid.’ 

If Grid attacked, it didn’t move forward and instead held on to urge defense. It would cause the attack timing to be missed, but Grid was adept at handling dual swords. He moved both hands freely so he could wield the sword in the other hand if Blockade decided to troll. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

‘In any case, it has a great compatibility with the Motley Flail.’ 

Of course, in terms of potential, the Motley Flail was the best, but... 

Blockade had an unconditional beneficial effect while demonstrating attack power that was incomparable to the flail. It had an incomparable high expectations value. 

“Wait... there is no need to fight.” 

The Specter’s broken voice continued faster than before. 

“I have decided not to hurt you.” 

She refused to fight. It was because she saw a glimmer of hope in Grid’s potential. Someday— 

She really hoped that Grid would understand her one day. It was okay if he didn’t understand in the end. In the unlikely event that her plan failed, Grid could remain as her next hope. 

The Specter was sincere. She truly hoped for the restoration of hell. She didn’t have the bad hobby of harming something valuable. However, Grid refused. 

“I have to smash this place.” 

“......”

“I can’t afford to leave this danger.” 

It had already been declared through the epic. 

I will bury you with the Overgeared Battleship. 

Grid wasn’t forced to act according to the epic, but the reason why the epic was written in the first place was because it was Grid’s will. 

“Okay… then I’ll defend this place.” 

It was a position where neither side could back down. The Specter would surely turn this place into hell. 

A plan that had been prepared for thousands of years—she couldn’t give up on the only way to restore hell now. 

“Come.” 

The Specter’s black divinity rose like a tidal wave. It took the same form as the Yellow Dragon and devoured the charging Grid. 

Grid broke through. He blocked the Specter’s club that moved in unbelievable trajectories with Blockade while doing the sword dance with Twilight. He took several strides, just as he did when he became a legend. Some of the status that he had built up with the epics was getting blurred every time he got closer to the Specter. The power of usurpation was attempting to devour the comparatively trivial content of Grid’s epics. Every time, Grid was weakened in real time. Close combat came with a heavy pressure. 

‘It is one of the greatest monsters.’ 

Why did such a monster exist as a boss monster that couldn’t be negotiated with? Grid frowned and clicked his tongue as he felt his fingers start to be torn by the black lightning that exploded every time the club and Blockade collided. The fact that he would have to fight against the powerful enemies that infested heaven and hell was daunting. 

‘This is a really damned worldview.’ 

It was to the point where he could feel the malice. He could easily guess what the personality of the development team would be like. 

“Isn’t it okay if we cut this?” 

It happened at a time when Chairman’s Lim Cheolho’s ears were starting to itch... 

Suddenly, a voice caught the attention of Grid and the Specter at the same time. They saw Muller standing next to the huge mass of red flesh. He still had Gujel’s Sword in his hand. 

“I will cut it.” 

Grid was faster this time. He moved to Muller’s side before the Specter and blocked the Specter’s attack that was aiming for Muller. The two crossed swords were blocking the dark club. 

“...Stop it.” 

A person who was called a hero was cowardly catching her off guard? A man who claimed to be an Only One God was cowardly taking advantage of the opportunity? 

The meaning conveyed in the Specter’s weak cry was conveyed to Grid and Muller. 

Muller’s big eyes shone brightly. “It is a villain’s accusation. It is high praise.” 

The Specter wasn’t aware of it, but from humanity’s point of view, she was a villain.

A drop of blood spurted from the center of the red flesh. Things went out of control after that.

The sword of the Sword Saint, which targeted the red flesh, split the entire No Offspring Tomb in half. It was a sword that cut the world.
