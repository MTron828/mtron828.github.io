Chapter 1458

Modern and convenient infrastructure, advanced technology, a stable economy, high security, quests to get the mass produced Grid set, etcetera—from a player’s point of view, the Overgeared Kingdom was a very attractive kingdom. The long history and abundant resources of the Saharan Empire wasn’t very attractive compared to the convenience of the Overgeared Kingdom, which was developed using the sense of modern people.

In fact, the number of people migrating to the Overgeared Kingdom was increasing every year. Still, it wasn’t the case that every player coveted the nationality of the Overgeared Kingdom. The high security of the Overgeared Kingdom meant there was no work for mercenary users, the Overgeared Kingdom’s policy of controlling the respawn area of the top bosses deterred high level users, and the economic market directly monitored by the Overgeared government and managed by the Muto Merchant Group was shunned by merchant users.

The safe and stable Overgeared Kingdom might be a ‘good kingdom for people to live in,’ but it wasn’t a good environment to have a dream.

“The price of iron ore has soared to 5 gold? Should I buy some more?”

“The rising speed is much faster than expected... Um... I’ll buy it for 9 gold, no, 13 gold.”

“It is said the empire has started construction of a new fortress!”

“There is too much bidding going on there. Let’s turn to the east. Since the competition for stone purchases intensified in the east first, those kingdoms will soon begin to build fortresses.”

For merchants and engineers, the great human and demon war was an important occasion. It was especially true for the merchants and engineers who didn’t belong to the Overgeared Kingdom. Most merchants and engineers in the Overgeared Kingdom were commissioned by the Overgeared government to produce goods or carry out construction. They had no choice but to be wary of the Overgeared Kingdom when setting prices. Meanwhile, merchants and engineers of other kingdoms were commissioned by various kingdoms and were free to set prices.

For example, the current metal and stone resources were in short supply. It was because demand increased rapidly ahead of the war. In just four days after the news of the great human and demon war broke out, the market price soared by nearly 20 times. The merchants and engineers of the Overgeared Kingdom delivered goods to the Overgeared Kingdom, regardless of the fluctuating market price.

It was because this was how the contract was signed in the first place. The Overgeared Kingdom gave merchants and engineers the right to use quarries and mines, guaranteeing stable sales. Instead, they offered to buy items at the ‘fixed price.’ The workers and merchants took it for granted. It was a great attraction to be able to collect resources reliably and deliver goods at the fixed price at any time without having to fear monsters, bandits, or mercenaries hired by competitors. Instead, they weren’t able to enjoy this special event, but... who knew this would happen? They couldn’t be disappointed considering the benefits they had already received.

“Make sure to stack up the purchased materials in the warehouse. Don’t put items, especially those in high demand for blacksmiths, on the market until the market prices rise as much as possible.”

Until now, the Overgeared Kingdom had the upper hand in the item market. This was natural as most blacksmiths belonged to the Overgeared Kingdom. Merchants who didn’t belong to the Overgeared Kingdom used to sweat every time they tried to deliver resources to the Overgeared Kingdom.

Now the situation had reversed. Resources couldn’t keep up with the overflowing manpower of the Overgeared Kingdom. The Overgeared Kingdom had reached a point where it couldn’t make items even if it wanted to.

They took the initiative against the Overgeared Kingdom...

The merchants even felt some pleasure. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Is this all the materials coming in today?”

“It is said that the mines are on cooldown.”

“If the amount for production isn’t enough, we should buy it on the exchange.”

“There is nothing else for sale on the exchange. The moment the news of the great human and demon war broke out, many individuals or merchant groups started buying goods...”

“Were we only sucking our fingers?”

“Of course not, Lauel was the first to start buying. Still, you know that there are people on the exchange who click fast. It is impossible to buy them all. In the meantime, some crazy rich person have sorted the items in ‘order of high price’ and swept the sales... rumor has it that he bought iron ore for 200 gold. At that price, I wonder if hoarding is meaningful at all...”

“Hah... Is this a game for chaebols? In any case, it won’t work today.”

Panmir, 1st in the blacksmith rankings and vice president of the Overgeared Blacksmiths Association (Grid was the president, but this didn’t mean much)—since four days ago, he failed to take one step out of the smithy. Currently, he put down his hammer for the first time. He couldn’t do his job because he couldn’t get the materials.

“Isn’t the quantity of the finest materials still very large?”

Most of the finest materials were pushed to Grid. It was natural since the items that Grid made were far better than the items made by other blacksmiths.

“Yes..."

“This... it must be left in Grid’s hands.”

“It is said that Valhalla will send 100,000 troops for support, right? Of those, 5,000 are the elite. At the very least, we have to supply top items for 5,000 people. It will be hard.”

“Lauel and Sir Rabbit must be troubled.”

***

At the Overgeared meeting hall...

Senior officials from all over the Overgeared Kingdom and Valhalla’s staff gathered in one place. Administrator Rabbit might be intimidated in front of such extraordinary figures, but he expressed his opinion in a dignified manner, “No, it isn’t possible.”

He completely opposed people’s insistence that war supplies in short supply should be purchased at a high price.

“Why do we have to pay a lot of money to buy supplies? I’m not in favor of it.”

“Didn’t you decide to supply the soldiers with new equipment? How can we make equipment and spread it without purchasing materials? Do you want to buy finished products?” a female military officer from Valhalla asked with a disbelieving expression. The corners of her mouth twitched like she was trying to hold back the ridicule.

It was bound to be ridiculous. Currently, most kingdoms on the continent were determined to unite to protect their homeland and the world. Apart from some small kingdoms, or ethnic groups in border areas, they had witnessed or experienced the fear of demons and realized the seriousness of the situation.

Meanwhile, the person in charge of administration in the Overgeared Kingdom, the center of the alliance, was speaking out of personal feelings. Not buying the materials necessary for a war because the market price had risen? The behavior of merchants who hoarded materials while coveting huge profits was abominable, but the change in price was a natural law of the economic market. He wanted to refuse due to this natural law? It was nothing more than a child’s whining.

The female military officer looked at him like he was pathetic and the glasses wearing Rabbit shot back, “If we buy finished products from outside, it will be useless because they are of lower quality than what we are used to being equipped with. Is the equipment that Valhalla soldiers wear inferior to the equipment on the market?”

“We are wearing mostly old equipment. As you know, our nation is short of blacksmiths.”

“Stop,” the senior military officer of Valhalla cut off the words of Valhalla’s female military officer. This was a public place. It was even a gathering of the key figures from both kingdoms. It was a disgrace to act like this. He sighed and spoke to the top military adviser, Sima Qian, who had been silent, “I’m sure that Administrator Rabbit insists that we don’t have to buy supplies because he hasn’t forgotten the nature of this incident. I am also thinking the same thing.”

“The... nature?” The female military officer showed an expression of surprise.

This was an officer of Valhalla. The senior military officer clicked his tongue and explained, “We are the heroes of this age gathered under the banner of protecting humanity from demons. It is a position to help humanity and merchants are also included in humanity. They should cooperate with us and don’t deserve to offer us a deal.”

“Of course, the logic is that they have to cooperate with us. Yet what can we do if they don’t want to? Do you think this persuasion will be accepted?”

“There is no need for persuasion. Once the disaster occurs in due time, they will want to cooperate with us. Isn’t this what Administrator Rabbit is thinking?”

“That’s right.”

‘It’s great.’ Lauel admired as he silently watched the meeting. Valhalla’s senior military officer—just like the top military adviser, Sima Qian, his name shone golden and his insight was excellent. He could immediately see the thought of Rabbit, who was the top two in political power in the Overgeared Kingdom.

‘If he has the determination...’

The moment Lauel thought this, the senior military officer continued, “However, it is too late to get supplies after the disaster has already begun. It might be a bit extreme, but I think it is necessary to inform the world of the omens of disaster.”

“In what way?”

“Doesn’t the Demon Slayer belong to the Overgeared Kingdom? If she travels around cities on the continent, opening the hell gate and letting demons flow out... those who have experienced the power of the demons will be alert enough to recognize that the great human and demon war is a disaster, not a festival.”

Sticks looked serious. “Are you saying that we should deliberately release demonic creatures and harm people? The heavens and earth will be angry! I don’t agree.”

On the other hand, Lauel’s assessment was different. ‘He has decisiveness... Ares had gathered a lot of talent.’

In Lauel’s view, the senior military officer’s opinion was very reasonable. If the demonic creatures destroyed cities all over the continent, players would slowly realize that the great human and demon war was a disaster. They would also find that the power of the Overgeared Kingdom was necessary to prepare for the great human and demon war.

Then public opinion toward the merchants who tried to rip the Overgeared Kingdom off would deteriorate. The more famous a merchant, the more they would turn over supplies to the Overgeared Kingdom at a cheap price in order to protect their position.

‘It is the most effective way since there are a lot of people who won’t listen no matter how we try to persuade them, but... it will be hard to handle the aftermath once it is found out that Yura was the one who released the demonic creatures. The image that the Overgeared Kingdom and Overgeared Guild has accumulated with such hard work will fall at once.’

The biggest problem was that Grid was likely not to approve. Sacrifices would inevitably occur in the process of destroying cities and planting fear in people. Would Grid acquiesce to that? Lauel was thinking with his hands on his chin when he suddenly met Sima Qian’s gaze. He responded with a smile.

‘Does he think that the senior military officer’s opinion is the most reasonable? If there is a better way, this resourceful person will definitely know more than me...’

He was the superior of the senior military officer with a similar level of intelligence to Lauel, so he should be better. Lauel was somewhat wary when he thought about it, but he didn’t show his innermost thoughts since he had been involved in politics for a long time. It happened at a time when the officials of the two kingdoms were continuing to exchange information...

“Sorry I’m late.” The door of the tightly closed meeting hall opened without anyone’s consent. It was the arrival of Grid.

Everyone immediately rose from their seats. It was the same with Valhalla’s staff.

“I greet Your Majesty, the Overgeared King.”

All of Valhalla’s staff bowed deeply to Grid, including Sima Qian. The female military officer, who had shown a lack of emotions during the meeting, blushed and her mouth dropped open like she was a fool. It was the power of the charm and dignity stats.

The Overgeared members were so used to Grid that they often forgot it, but objectively, Grid was a very cool and likable person. Among actors and actresses who chose classes and focused on the charm stat, there were often people acting as femme fatales, yet even they would appear to be ugly next to Grid. It was a matter of aura, not of appearance.

“It is nice to meet you, Military Adviser Sima Qian. We will exchange greetings later. I will give you the news first. In the next three days, a large amount of war supplies will arrive here in Reinhardt. It is enough to prepare for war. As first discussed, we will buy the supplies. Then Valhalla will buy the equipment we produce at a reasonable price.”

“......?”

“......?”

Most of the people gathered here were smart but none of them could understand Grid’s words. Enough supplies to prepare for a war would arrive soon? In the confusion, Sima Qian opened his mouth, “Your Majesty, can I ask about the source of the supplies?’

“The Lion Merchant Group. It is a place where my side has infiltrated as a spy.”

“......!”

The eyes of the members of both kingdoms were wide open and shook.

Sima Qian asked again, “What is the purchase price of the goods?”

“It is according to the original price. My people have done a really good job.”

“......!!”

“......!!”

This time, even Sima Qian shook. He was so surprised that his face turned white. Everyone was expecting that the price of war supplies would rise. However, using spies to take control of a giant merchant group and buy as many supplies as needed before the market price rose... it wasn’t something that could be done with ordinary foresight. It was hard to see it as the level of a human.

‘Even his resourcefulness has reached the realm of a god...!’

[Affinity with Sima Qian, military adviser of the Valhalla Kingdom, has increased by 20.]

“......?”

Grid was flustered while Sima Qian looked at him with eyes filled with pure envy. In the midst of the uproar, Lauel sent a whisper to Huroi. He was clearly aware that this situation wasn’t the result of Grid’s strategy.

-What is going on?Why is the Lion Merchant Group giving us such cheap supplies?

-I stole the seal of the merchant group and tampered with a few documents.

-......?

Was Huroi so competent? No, this wasn’t a matter of being competent. This couldn’t be possible just by manipulating a few documents. No, how did he steal the seal of the merchant group in the first place?’ Weren’t such important things always kept in the inventory?

Lauel frowned out of confusion from the incomprehensible situation and thin blood flowed from his nose. His skin was being upgraded every day.

In any case... even Lauel couldn’t understand the situation. It was because his premise for understanding the situation was wrong. Huroi didn’t infiltrate as a spy. He was being entertained as a guest.
