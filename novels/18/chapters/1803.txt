Chapter 1803

Asgard.

“”How did you end up against him?””

Gabriel frowned as she was thinking about Grid’s new sword and armor. It was because Metatron’s question after being reborn in a reserve body was unpleasant.

“To be exact, he went against us. He dared to challenge the Goddess’ authority.”

“”Seeing how sensitive you are, Gabriel, you must’ve also contributed to this relationship.””

“You are talking nonsense because you don’t know anything. He was hostile to Asgard even before I met you.”

How could a doll who was obsessed with instinct shift the blame onto her? Gabriel lost her composure and was growing angry again. Then Metatron offered her comfort that wasn’t really comfort.

“”The good news is that the level of the apostle doesn’t match the master. Is he called Braham? He is too inferior compared to the chief gods who worship the Goddess. The other apostles must be like that as well. Grid might be special as an individual, but in terms of power, the surface is no match for Asgard.””

“Of course. There is no need to even talk about this.”

“”However, there will be a few crises if you provoke Grid.””

“...I won’t do that,” Gabriel replied angrily and grudgingly.

She meant it. She was very angry, but she had vowed several times that she would never deal with Grid again. He was too strong. The fact that he ignored Raphael’s authority and could use his full abilities in Asgard was very intimidating.

‘Come to think of it, why is there no news?’

She received a report that the blueprint of the key has been found.

Mumud attracted Judar’s attention—unusual for an angel—and was nominated as a candidate to be an archangel. Now he personally led a large army to the Prison of Eternity. She thought he would come back with Raphael soon, but for some reason, there was no news.

‘It is too long even considering the fact that Zeratul will interfere.’

It was unlikely that Zeratul was in a perfect state. He must’ve fought to the death with Raphael while out of his mind. By now, he would’ve been overpowered by Raphael.

‘Is Raphael forcing it for no reason?’

In the end—

Gabriel found it hard to wait and raised herself up. She headed to the Prison of Eternity. The atmosphere around the prison was unexpectedly noisy.

“What is going on?”

She couldn’t show emotional agitation in front of the angels. Gabriel was maintaining her usual smile to protect her reputation, only for her expression to gradually stiffen. She maintained her smile, but all her muscles stiffened. It was the aftermath of finding the lock that was still tightly closed despite the key being in Mumud’s hand.

‘Magic?’

It was absurd. The lock that the angels had managed since the beginning of time had now been modified by magic. It was magic with a structure they had never seen before. Even at a glance, it was a form that was difficult to destroy.

‘...That damn guy.’

Gabriel recalled Braham’s face, which was only good to look at, and her expression crumpled as she lost her composure.

“”It is hard to say that his level is low.””

Metatron changed their assessment of Braham. They added that it seemed force wasn’t the only virtue Grid considered important when selecting the apostles. Meanwhile, Mumud’s emotions were fluctuating as he analyzed the spells on the lock.

‘It is like my magic.’

To be exact, it seemed as if someone had spent a long time researching and evolving his magic. For some reason, unfathomable anger and sadness soared.

“Mumud, is it difficult for you as well?” Archangel Umiel asked in a worried manner.

Angels were natural enemies of magic, but this didn’t mean that they knew magic well. In the current situation, they were forced to rely on Mumud.

A being who lost his natural lifespan in exchange for a magical talent that had never been seen before—the archangels knew that Mumud was qualified to be the most accomplished magician in the world.

“It will take some time, but it can be solved.”

As expected, Mumud didn’t betray their expectations. A concept penetrated his mind as he answered with a blank expression, not showing his emotional agitation.

‘My past life.’

He had a hunch that he would get to know another him the more he unlocked the magic in this lock...

***

Create a mental world.

This was a notice that was sent to all the Overgeared Guild members.

“Mental world... what?”

“It is like the Sanctuary of Metal that Grid uses.”

“Is it a skill that can be learned without a hidden quest or specific job change?”

“That is why this order must’ve been issued.”

“But it didn’t mention how to do it?”

The content of the notice was extremely unfriendly. They were simply instructed to create a mental world, but there wasn’t a word about how to create it. In other words, the confusion felt by the Overgeared members was natural. The members who opened up the ‘willpower’ stat understood the context, but there were only a few of them.

“Should I raise the level of Formless Will? Perhaps something special will happen when I master it.”

“If there was such a hidden piece, wouldn’t Grid have told us right away?”

The top-tier Overgeared members who had risen to the rank of legend or transcendent—they acted for Grid on the continent that changed due to Fire Dragon Trauka and they were very splendid. Jishuka, Faker, Chris, Hurent, Zibal, Vantner, etc. They were less famous compared to Yura, who guarded hell alone. However, they were even more like beginners in front of Grid.

They had no idea how to open up a mental world. It was natural. Even Grid didn’t know the precise method.

“...I am getting a lot of inquiries,” Lauel came to Grid and said. It was Lauel who informed the members to create a mental world, but it was Grid who instructed him to give the notice.

“Can’t you at least roughly give me a hint?”

“I just played the game seriously and it worked out?”

“......”

Lauel had an expression like he was fed up.He thought it was a joke. Surprisingly, Grid was serious. It was because he got the mental world after exercising his will. In fact, a few days ago, Khan created a mental world with the idea of ‘protecting Grid with my skills and works.’

“Really. In my opinion, the conditions for opening up the mental world aren’t fixed, but vary from person to person. The trajectory of their lives... therefore, if there is will or tenacity, the system will have to acknowledge their playing history and they will naturally get it. It is with the sense that their existence is invading the world.”

“Then it is a bit difficult. The will of our colleagues can’t be insignificant compared to you.”

“I think it is weird as well...”

Basically, the Overgeared Guild was a group made up of rankers. They were also the best rankers among billions of players. They were great people who must’ve heard at least a hundred times in the past that they were game crazy, that they only ate and played games.

At the same time, Satisfy was becoming the foundation of the global economy. None of the Overgeared members played Satisfy with a light heart. They had been playing Satisfy wholeheartedly. They might have fewer achievements compared to Grid, but it was the result of luck or a skill difference, not a lack of passion.

However, none of them had ever established a mental world. To be exact, it wasn’t recognized by the system.

‘The circumstances of the apostles are the same.’

None of the apostles except for Braham had a mental world. They were just hoping that perhaps Zik had it.

However, Zik hid himself so well that he had yet to even show off his Seven Malignant Saints’ skill. There were too many question marks in the status window. They felt like they wouldn’t respect Zik if they asked about the identity of these question marks, so they were cautious.

‘It doesn’t mean that the conditions for opening the mental world are difficult.’

Braham and Biban had their own mental worlds since they were mere legends.

‘Surprisingly, I don’t think it is difficult...’

Grid had this vague belief, but it was impossible for him to find the answers on his own. In the end, he had no choice but to trust and wait as always.

“There is no need to be nervous. I’m sure everyone will do a good job.”

In the meaning, Grid shared the details of ‘Braham’s Staff’ that he made today with Lauel.

“It is the other parties who need to be nervous.”

[Braham’s Staff]

[Rating: Only One

Durability: Proportional to the wearer’s mental strength (mana level).

Magic Attack Power: 35,990~???

★ Intelligence +2,000

★ Perfect Memorial can be used up to five times.

★ Increases the power and effectiveness of all magic and reduces the cooldown time.

★ Increases attack magic hit rate by 80%.

★ The effect of ‘Second Boundary: Exploration Room’ is always activated.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

A staff created by Only One God Grid through the unity of the mental world with Braham, God of Magic and Wisdom.

The bones and scales that contain Fire Dragon Trauka’s intent have been tempered with Braham’s magic.

It will act on behalf of Braham’s thirst for endless wisdom and will show a disaster in a form that has never been seen before.

Conditions of Use: Braham, Grid.

Weight: 2,500~???]

It was a simple yet incomprehensible explanation. Unlike Defying the Natural Order, Braham’s Staff had fewer effects. He wondered if it was such a big advantage that it could always exert the effect of the mental world. This was until the description of the Exploration Room confirmed it.

[Second Boundary: Exploration Room]

[Passive.

It analyzes, understands, and intervenes in all ‘phenomena.’

Enhances and modifies allies’ skills and magic with a high probability.

Duplicates, absorbs, and reflects enemy skills and magic with a high probability.

Blocks phenomena classified as a ‘miracle’ such as divinity, power, mental world, and absolute defense with a low probability.]

It was a superior version of Duke of Wisdom. One of Braham’s mental worlds, Exploration Room, closely resembled Mercedes’ Keen Insight. It was as if artificially creating a power that even the gods feared. When it was just a mental world, the power to intervene in reality was weak and the practicality was low. That was no longer the case. He would now be able to actively use it in the future thanks to the staff made with Grid’s help.

“The premise of owning a dedicated weapon made through Intent Production is to have your own mental world. If they know this, then I don’t think anyone will be holding back. Isn’t that right?”

Intent Production—it was simply a system designed to create dedicated items for Grid. However, Braham changed the system itself. No, he didn’t change it, he proved it. The fact that other people’s mental worlds can be used as the main subject, not Grid.

“...Certainly, that is true.”

Lauel belatedly came to his senses and nodded.

Defying the Natural Order, Fire Dragon’s Armor, and Braham’s Staff—how many Overgeared members would be calm after seeing these?

It was clear that they would also be obsessed with the mental world because they wanted similar items. Right now, Lauel alone became nervous. He had retired from the battlefield a long time ago, so items weren’t very important, but he was filled with the desire to have his own dedicated weapon.

Anyone would be like this. It was an item optimized only for them with their mental world applied. Even monk players who shouted about not having unnecessary possessions would be greedy for it.

“I will diligently analyze it.”

What was the difference between Grid and other players? What difference determined the existence or absence of a mental world? Starting from today, Lauel would explore it.

Grid smiled at him. “So dependable.”
