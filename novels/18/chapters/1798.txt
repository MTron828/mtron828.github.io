Chapter 1798

“......!” 

‘We were tricked.’ 

The blueprint of the key made in the distant past—the faces of the angels hardened as they searched for the whereabouts of the blueprint by looking back on past history. It was because they felt Raphael’s traces. 

The angels scattered throughout Asgard all felt it. For the angels, the presence of an archangel was that great. 

“They have liberated their divinity. They are definitely under threat.” 

“It was obvious from the time they were trapped with God Zeratul... what matters is the identity of the new intruder. Is it Grid again?” 

“It is a problem if it is Grid, and a problem if it isn’t Grid. What is wrong with our surveillance network?” 

In the midst of the angels’ agitation— 

‘They dare!’ 

The archangels spread their wings wide and moved at full speed. They descended vertically through several layers of golden clouds that blocked their vision. Due to the divinity wrapped around their bodies, they looked like beams of light. 

‘They are taking advantage of the gaps when the Goddess isn’t intact to infiltrate one after another!’ 

There was no time to summon the angels, so the faces of the archangels pursuing the intruder distorted. They looked like demons, not angels. Their anger had reached the peak. It was natural Their sanctuary had been violated one after another. 

Shamefully, they didn’t even notice the presence of the intruder until the incident. It was hard to believe even if the surveillance network had been greatly weakened by the Goddess’ cycle. 

How did that guy called Grid infiltrate Asgard? Additionally, why couldn’t Raphael’s authority restrain him? There were many questions but they couldn’t afford to think about it. 

The archangels immediately focused on the situation in front of them. They chased after the traces of the ‘wings’ that had detached from that idiot, Raphael. The wings symbolized Rule and Domination and it was presumably held by the intruder on the run. It might only be a small part of Raphael, but it was closely related to the authority of the archangels and shouldn’t be leaked. Moreover, the worst situation could be assumed if it fell into the hands of Grid, who had the Fallen Angel Sariel. 

“Okay! Hurry up!” 

The big eyes of the 2nd ranked Archangel, Gabriel, almost turned white. Extreme killing intent was contained in the eyes following the trail of the wings in real time. 

“We have to catch him before he gets to the surface!” 

The archangels were aware of the identity of the intruder—Braham. At first, they naturally thought it was Grid or the Great Robber of the Red Night. However, the faint traces of magic proved that the intruder was a magician. If not Braham, who else could use stealth magic that avoided Asgard’s surveillance network and high-speed flight magic that allowed him to escape from the archangels. 

“He is quick. It is a level different from the existing magic. Keep in mind that we might not catch up until we get to the surface.” 

The 5th ranked Archangel, Raguel, expressed their opinion and Gabrial responded in an agitated manner. 

“Then it is over! We have to catch him somehow!” 

“Calm down and relax your mind. The opponent is a magician. We can punish him the moment we close the distance, even on the surface.”

The 4th ranked Archangel, Umiel, also expressed their opinion, but it wasn’t enough to calm Gabriel down. 

“Don’t make me laugh! The surface has long been the domain of Grid! The moment we step there, we will be surrounded by evil pagans and we might not get a chance! So!” 

Gabriel’s head almost snapped as she turned back. It was to send a longing gaze toward the 7th ranked archangel who was at the very rear. It was an angel flying with only two wings. They had six wings covering their face and head, and 28 wings on their body. Nevertheless, they were chasing after the other archangels effortlessly. Gabriel shouted to them, “Metatron! Please help us!” 

“Gabriel!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Umiel and Raguel’s complexions paled with horror, but Gabriel didn’t stop. 

“I will make a contract!” 

“”...State the collateral of the contract.”” 

“My wings!” 

““It isn’t worth it to me.””

“...I’ll give you Raphael’s wings that were taken away by the intruder!”

“”Okay.”” 

A smile seemed to spread across Metatron’s face that was hidden by the wings. Four of the wings that restrained Metatron’s body were unfolded. They were particularly huge wings. The thick shadows they cast somewhat tarnished the divinity of the archangels. 

“Are you sane? You are going to give them the authority to Rule?” 

“It is better than it being taken away by Grid. 

“Even Sariel wouldn’t know how to use it...!” 

“You are too peaceful. Don’t talk and focus on recovering the wings.” 

Shockwaves struck Gabriel and Umiel’s bodies as they were arguing. They were shockwaves caused by Metatron, who suddenly disappeared as a dot. It was an extremely fast speed that could be compared to other Absolutes. It was difficult for the three archangels to narrow the distance, no matter how hard they tried. It was best to feel relieved as they followed Metatron’s presence, who was gradually catching up with the intruder. 

‘Forget it. We will catch up before he reaches the point where dimensional movement is possible.’ 

It was the place where she missed Grid and the prisoners. Gabriel thought this, but— 

“......!” 

Just before Metatron almost caught up with Braham, Braham’s presence disappeared for a moment. Then it reappeared a long distance away. 

“Teleport?” 

What magic did the intruder use to move when deep inside Asgard? Asgard’s barriers weren’t in such a disgraceful state, right? 

“If he could use it freely then he would’ve used it from the beginning. I’m sure he is overdoing it.” 

Raguel’s analysis was accurate. The complexion of the intruder, Braham, was visibly haggard. 

‘What is this monster?’ 

Braham’s enhanced magic had evolved by several times. It meant that even after giving Disintegrate and Meteor to Greed, he didn’t stay in the mountains for no reason. Braham’s flying magic was special. Once he exerted its maximum output, it made it possible to fly at such a high speed that even Braham couldn’t control it. 

However, someone quickly caught up with him. Despite the forced teleporting in Asgard’s environment, which suppressed the magic power of intruders, he was on the verge of being caught again. It was by a strange and hideous angel who restrained their body with dozens of wings. 

Braham had never heard of anything like this. Most of the angels admired by humanity were portrayed beautifully. 

“”Is it Yatan’s distant flesh and blood?”” 

A voice echoed like it was in a cave. The words that contained content about Braham’s origin offended Braham. 

“Is it necessary to skip Beriache and discuss Yatan?” 

“”Beriache... I don’t know that name.”” 

“Your eyes and ears are blocked. You deserve to be an angel.” 

Braham laughed in a mocking manner, but his heart was heavy. This angel didn’t know the name of the child that Yatan gave birth to right after he created hell? 

How far in the past was it? 

‘It must be close to the beginning.’ 

Of course, the other archangels were also born close to the beginning. Rebecca’s first creations were the seven archangels. The existence behind his back that was gradually getting closer was an archangel. However, it was clear that they had a huge flaw. Therefore, they were cut off from time and never heard of the name Beriache. 

‘So many wings... restrictions... are they like me?’ 

Was this archangel like him, who hurt his own kin in search of knowledge? Was this archangel also driven by some instinct to take the wings of other angels and eventually became a prisoner? 

Braham’s consciousness was divided into several parts as he analyzed why the monstrous angel had so many wings and why they were disconnected from time. In order to outwit Metatron, he modified his magic in real time while installing trap magic among the clouds so that other archangels couldn’t act as variables. 

He even finished casting dimensional movement magic so it would be triggered immediately the moment the pressure on his magic power weakened. He didn’t forget to look at the coordinates to ensure that the landing site was as sparsely populated as possible. 

It was a desperate move. It wasn’t simply to survive. Braham wasn’t afraid since he had overcome death. He just didn’t want to be treated as a troll. 

‘I can’t humiliate Grid as his number one Apostle.’ 

Right now, Braham was convinced that he was the strongest among Grid’s seven Apostles. Of course, the potential of the other Apostles was so great that he didn’t know how long he would be able to hold onto this position… in any case, he was in a position not to humiliate Grid. 

‘I need to disperse my consciousness a bit more.’ 

Not so long ago, Braham had received great inspiration from Trauka, who gave up the battle and left without hesitation because of him. The moment Trauka gave up and turned around, he felt the ‘traces’ he hadn’t noticed before disappear from all over the world. 

The traces were none other than the clones that Trauka had set up. He was monitoring the entire world while dealing with Grid, Marie Rose, and the tower members. He had been wary of any possible threats that might come toward him. It was an act that the relatively arrogant Braham of the past would’ve ridiculed as being cowardly. 

However, Braham was different now. Braham decided to learn from Trauka’s prudence. He couldn’t disperse his consciousness into thousands or tens of thousands like Trauka, but he tried to disperse it as much as possible. It was to use it as a springboard to ‘omnipotence.’ 

...He was still arrogant. 

“”......?”” 

Metatron paused while following Braham closely. It was because the invader, who had already started to suffer from the side effects of the magic power backlash, teleported again and increased his presence to dozens. It was the use of Decoy, which had reached the highest level. There was no difference between the main body and the clones. 

Metatron didn’t delay at all. They opened the eight wings that covered their face and head slightly and shot light rays from the eyes exposed through the gaps. They were rays of light that extended to the edge of their vision in a fan shape as soon as they were fired. 

Braham’s dozens of clones were all struck by the rays and disappeared. Only one remained, leaving the presence of the main body. 

‘This monster?’ 

Braham gritted his teeth and hurried. 

It was in order to arrive at his destination that wasn’t far away and to move to the surface. The giant angel was a monster where he couldn’t guarantee victory even if he fought on the surface, but… it was tens of thousands of times better than fighting in Asgard. 

“”Is it really your hope?”” 

Metatron asked as they chased Braham again. It was more of a murmur than a question. They seemed to have some interest in Braham’s attitude of being obsessed with escaping to the surface. 

“”What is on the surface?”” 

They didn’t know Beriache so they naturally didn’t know Grid. The prisoner, who was originally the leader of the angels along with Raphael, only to fall to the 7th rank and have their power sealed, regarded Braham’s efforts as insignificant. This didn’t mean they let their guard down. The contract was for the Wings of Rule, but it was only a fragment. 

Metatron could only fully unfold four wings and the level of the intruder was too high to catch up with just this. Yatan’s blood seemed thicker than they expected. 

“Come and check it out.” 

Braham barely arrived at his destination and activated his dimensional movement magic. 

“”Okay.”” 

Metatron followed. The two of them were intertwined as they descended toward an ocean of the surface. 

Braham wasn’t in his best state due to the series of high level magic used in Asgard, which suppressed magic power. Even though he received the buffs of the Overgeared World, he still wasn’t at his peak. Additionally, Metatron briefly ignored the debuffs of the Overgeared World because he was a prisoner who wasn’t bound by the rules of the Trinity. 

“Kuaaack!” Braham’s heart was pierced by a ray of light and he let out a rare scream. 

Metatron wasn’t very interested in his life. “”The presence of a great god... it is very different from the first world...”” 

They just pulled at Braham’s right hand while observing the changes on the surface with interest. It was the hand that was holding Raphael’s wings. 

“”It is a nostalgic strength.””

Having achieved their will, Metatron’s gaze shifted upward. Unlike Metatron, the three archangels who formed a Trinity were descending the stairs made of golden clouds. 

“Let’s go back.” 

Gabriel had abandoned her nervousness. She was very calm despite this being the surface. Even if Grid appeared, there was Metatron. Now she had unlocked some of Metatron’s power in exchange for a contract. The only thing she feared was the hierarchy of an Old Dragon. There was no need to be conscious of any power that was inferior to that. 

Suddenly, she stiffened. It was because the presence of Fire Dragon Trauka suddenly approached. 

“...What?” 

Gabriel’s expression hardened as she turned her head toward the approaching presence. 

Only One God Grid—he had none other than Trauka’s aura. 

“What are you doing here?” 

Grid asked coldly while the flames spreading from his hands changed moment by moment.
