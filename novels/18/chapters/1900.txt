Chapter 1900

Bunhelier’s Breath was offset every time the imoogi released the magic power of the yeouijus. The durability of its body was comparable to that of a top dragon. It was able to withstand Grid’s attacks quite well.

It didn’t seem to know fear. It must’ve easily overcome any confrontation it ever experienced.

The proof was that it rushed forward without shrinking back even against the Crazy God and Crazy Dragon.

Bunhelier deflected the blow from the imoogi and swung his tail.

[It is more than I expected…] Bunhelier muttered as he grabbed the imoogi and threw it into the lake. He had a rather excited intonation.

Bunhelier was concentrating on the yeouijus that were moving on the tongue of the imoogi, not on the imoogi. He grasped the value of the yeouijus in real time and developed greed.

To be honest, the current Bunhelier didn’t care if he was a mixed race or not. He thought that it was okay to be treated as a rat as long as he got his hands on a yeouiju. He would gain the power to kill anyone who treated him as a rat.

“......”

Unlike Bunhelier, who was smiling wickedly, Grid’s expression was stiff.

The battlefield on the other side—it was the aftermath of feeling King Sobyeol’s divinity constantly rising from the place where he had just been. It was a divinity that had been sharpened and woven into blades.

At this moment, it would be slashing at Kraugel. There was no chance that Kraugel would succeed even taking into account the ‘effect of Twilight’ that Kraugel had mentioned, the existence of Sainteses Ruby, and the actions of the other apostles and colleagues.

King Sobyeol’s attack power was threatening to Grid as well.

‘It would be a good thing if Kraugel is the only one who dies.’

King Sobyeol was an Absolute. This meant he was an existence that made Kraugel’s control skills meaningless. The possibility of a one-sided loss in a battle of attrition was too high.

In the worst case scenario, Kraugel would die quickly. Many things would go awry from then on. Maybe there was a high possibility of Grid’s side being wiped out?

“Item Combination.”

Grid hurried up. He even used the skills he had been saving in preparation for Chiyou’s descent, raising his attack power to the limit.

Bunhelier didn’t bother to stop him. From his perspective, Grid’s apostles and colleagues couldn’t face off against King Sobyeol. It was imperative that they hunt down this imoogi before King Sobyeol could get in the way. It meant they didn’t have time to think about the consequences.

In that sense, the compatibility between Grid and Bunhelier was very good.

Bunhelier’s Breath squeezed through the gap in the imoogi’s skin that had been split apart by Grid’s sword dance. Then it repeatedly exploded from the inside.

Kiyaaaaaah!

‘The power of an Old Dragon is fraudulent.’

Being able to shoot a Breath without any cooldown time—this was the biggest difference between an Old Dragon and a top dragon.

‘It is just a bit shabby compared to Nevartan, who can stack dozens of overlapping Breaths...’

[What? Your eyes look very unpleasant. What are you thinking?]

“Just concentrate.”

Did he have eyes on the back of his head?

Grid was surprised by the senses of an Old Dragon and strongly grabbed Bunhelier’s horn. It was because Bunhelier’s huge body, which was carrying him, rotated 180 degrees. The green bodily fluids released by the imoogi grazed the skin of Bunhelier’s belly and there was a rotten smell.

[Tsk, it is a lowly like a low-level creature.]

The imoogi might have a body and power comparable to an Absolute, but it was a monster after all. It had low intelligence and was unsophisticated. It couldn’t utilize the power of the yeouijus properly and instead spat out poisonous needles.

‘Noe deserves to be the number one demonic creature of hell.’

At the very least, Noe wasn’t stupid. If the imoogi could properly utilize the magic power of the yeouijus, it would’ve shot something similar to a Breath. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Grid was relieved that it was less troublesome. Then black-gold wings spread out on Grid’s left and right sides. They were wings made by the God Hands. Hundreds of hands, each with a different weapon, started a sword dance in unison.

Bunhelier’s huge body shook as he made all sorts of noises. The pressure generated when Grid used his body as a stepping stone and used a six fusion sword dance was considerable enough. Then once it was combined with the waves created by hundreds of sword dances, this noise was created because the waves didn’t mesh well with the dark scales.

[H-Hu...]

Bunhelier was trampled on in a bad place and unknowingly groaned. Then he hurriedly closed his mouth. He shuddered, perhaps feeling ashamed at losing his composure due to the pain.

Grid fully understood Bunhelier’s position.

‘Maybe it is because I am going all-in on strength. I should be careful in the future.’

Grid carefully moved the foot that was crushing Bunhelier’s spinal cord. Blood flowed out from the cracks in the scales and soaked his boots, but he didn’t care. He wouldn’t slip when it was only to this extent.

Then Grid jumped off. At the same time, the broad jaw of the imoogi filled his vision.

.

Grid was incredibly fast, even if he was using the Dragon sword dance to move instead of Shunpo.

Grid was strong. Even though the level of the prey was equivalent to an Absolute, Grid was so overwhelming that there were no hindrances. Didn’t he deal a blow (?) on an Old Dragon just by doing the steps of the sword dance?

The Dragon sword dance pierced the jaw of the imoogi. Then a foothold once again appeared under Grid’s feet. It was Bunhelier’s forehead as he followed Grid without any difficulty. Thanks to this, the Crazy God and Crazy Dragon effect was maintained and the six fusion sword dance was used four times in a row.

Kiyaaaaaaah!

The master of a dimension—they were Rebecca, Hanul, Baal, Grid, and Eve. Among them, Baal was killed by Grid. Even if only a simple calculation was done, there were only a few beings in the world who had a hierarchy equal to Grid.

What about monsters? They couldn’t handle Grid.

The imoogi had always risen immediately after falling down several times, but on this occasion, it took a long time to get back up. It struggled in pain without being able to easily raise its body stuck in the lake.

The lake was dyed red and it seemed to be all the blood of the imoogi. This battlefield itself was like a space created to slaughter the imoogi.

“Right now, this... is it really true?”

The Sword Immortal was in a terrible state of shock.

The imoogi—it was a monstrous creature that he barely sealed by using what he had spent his whole life studying. It was incredibly powerful. If it had a bit of wisdom, Yeoam wouldn’t have dared to dream of sealing it. He was certain that even King Sobyeol wouldn’t be able to hunt this imoogi easily.

He was worried that the fighting would last for days and the civilian population would be damaged, so he prepared a number of guard formations. But now, the battle was over before the worst-case scenario could be put into operation. Grid smashed the imoogi in an instant.

He had only heard about the god of the surface, who could treat the Western dragons as mounts, through rumors. This god had a power that Yeoam couldn’t imagine even with all his knowledge and experience.

‘This is why he was able to save the world.’

Yeoam didn’t find Grid incomprehensible. Yeoam reflected on the path Grid took and was convinced instead. Then he became overwhelmed with great emotion. He had always wondered if the people of this continent had suffered more due to his departure from the world...

Now he let go of some of the guilt he always felt.

“It is still alive after that?” Grid asked with a frown.

Bunhelier read Grid’s inner thoughts and reacted immediately. He dived into the lake with Grid on his back and tracked the fleeing imoogi.

“It is dangerous....!” Yeoam called out in shock. The blood of the imoogi was a poison in itself. In fact, the red foam soaring high into the sky and then falling was killing the surrounding land and forest. It was the imoogi’s resentment itself. It would penetrate deep into the ground and turn this place into a land of death over time.

“Ahh... Huh?” Yeoam was sighing while imagining the sight of the great god’s mighty body melting terribly. Then he doubted his eyes.

It was because all the dying land and forest had been revived. The aura of the earth was strengthened and it purified the imoogi’s poison so there were no traces left.

“I’m glad. If I was a bit late, it would’ve been hard to recover.”

It was thanks to Garion, God of the Earth, arriving in time. The chief god of the Overgeared World performed miracles too easily.

Yeoam was at the peak of Natural State so he could feel clearly how great she was.

“Really... the true gods have descended.”

At this time—

Gurgle gurgle!

The lake boiled over and turned even redder. What followed soon after...

“I only got one.”

It was Grid and Bunhelier. Contrary to Yeoam’s worries, they were both fine.

[I never thought the yeouijus would be destroyed the moment the imoogi dies. They are insignificant in many ways compared to dragons, who leave our hearts behind when we die.]

“In any case, it has been proven that ‘this thing’ doesn’t belong to the imoogi.”

[Unidentified Yeouiju]

[Rating: ???

It was one of the two yeouijus held by the imoogi, who practiced for a thousand years, but failed to ascend to heaven and instead became a monster.

There is an aura around it that makes it hard to guess where it came from.]

Bunhelier demanded, [Give it to me. I’ll try it out.]

“Let’s not act rashly.”

Grid put the yeouiju in his inventory. It was an object whose origin couldn’t be clearly identified even after the appraisal skill was used. Grid judged that it was right to use it after investigating more clearly using various routes.

Kkikikikik!

Grid took out the ‘Imoogi’s Poisonous Fang’ and coated Defying the Natural Order with it. It was an item dropped by the imoogi. It was a myth-level buff item. It wasn’t even a consumable and could be used permanently.

[Poison damage equivalent to 50% of the weapon’s attack power has been added to ‘Defying the Natural Order.’ The effect lasts for 30 seconds. During the duration of the effect, there is a 100% chance of inflicting ‘Imoogi’s Poison’ on the target.]

[Imoogi’s Poison]

[Randomly inflicts the poison, bleeding, internal injury, paralysis, confusion, or stun abnormal statuses.

If the target is a being who resists status abnormalities, then it will deal additional no attribute damage equal to 100% of the weapon’s attack power.]

‘Isn’t this better than the yeouiju?’

Grid seriously had that thought. It was a random effect item.

Kkikikikik.

[What are you doing...? Hmm, is this useful?]

The Imoogi’s Poisonous Fang was literally ‘an item that gives a buff to a weapon.’ It wasn’t a consumable item. It could be used infinitely and it didn’t necessarily have to be used by Grid himself. It was possible to strengthen the weapons of his companions, just as how he just used it on Bunhelier’s claws.

“Noe.”

“D-Did you summon me? H-How long has it been, Master, nyang.”

“Didn’t you have breakfast with me earlier?”

“You haven’t called me during a fight lately, nyang.”

“That is because you... in any case, carry this around and apply it to the kid’s weapons once in a while. Come back to me every 30 seconds and apply it.”

“???”

Bunhelier, who was carrying Grid even during the conversation, accelerated. He quickly reached the place where King Sobyeol was.

There was no Kraugel. However, all the others were safe, while King Sobyeol wasn’t unscathed.

‘He fought really well.’

What a great guy.

A smile spread across Grid’s face as he felt relieved.

The back of King Sobyeol’s head was getting closer in an instant.

“H-Here it is!” Just then, Noe applied the Imoogi’s Poison to Twilight and passed it to Grid.

Grid used Item Combination again. The two dragon weapons joined together, scattering green fog.

King Sobyeol’s eyes shook as he barely pulled out the dagger stuck in his neck. He had turned into rags just from fighting with a few humans, while Grid was bizarrely unscathed. He couldn’t find any traces of fighting the extremely strong imoogi.

The difference was obvious. The self-esteem of a being who was born as an Absolute collapsed like a sand castle.

[I can’t accept it...] King Sobyeol’s intent couldn’t continue to the end. It was because the moment the first movement of the six fusion sword dance was blocked, the divinity of his body twisted and backlashed. His thoughts also stopped due to the backlash.

[How did you get stronger?]

The power of Grid’s sword far exceeded the Breath of the Evil Dragon—King Sobyeol was convinced of this and his face contorted miserably.

The sight of him jumping into a Breath to avoid the tenaciously linked sword dance was like a moth jumping into flames.
