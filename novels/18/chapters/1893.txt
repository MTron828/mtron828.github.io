Chapter 1893

The Overgeared World—the tip of the dimension that was Grid’s sensory organ, under certain circumstances, was slightly shaken. It was the aftermath of being swept away by an explosion that occurred outside the dimension. The actual scene of the explosion must’ve been devastated.

“It is pretty good. Among the ones who have been kicked out, there is no one who can go wild like this except for King Sobyeol. Squeak.”

It was right after catching a glimpse of Hanul’s power in the dimensional gap.

A monster struggling to grasp Rebecca’s light—Hanul must have a great power. It was a skill that was naturally understandable since he was a God of the Beginning.

However, there wasn’t an immediate sense of power. He was so obsessed with the light that he didn’t retrieve his heart. He was, as the world had speculated, powerless. Even in his own realm, he only inflicted minor wounds on Grid and Bunhelier.

This was the reason why Grid and Bunhelier concluded that there was no possibility that Hanul was involved in the disturbance.

It was also obvious that Chiyou wouldn’t be so rash.

‘I wonder if the imoogi is there.’ Grid quickly grasped the situation and got up. He put back on the skin mask that he had taken off. He had to be wary of Chiyou’s gaze again the moment he left the Blue Dragon’s area.

‘Still, I doubt this will escape Chiyou’s gaze.’

It was a situation where he had to leave the Blue Dragon’s area as well as the Overgeared World. He didn’t think he could deceive Chiyou’s senses, no matter what disguise he wore.

However, Kraugel was in trouble. Clearly, an Absolute had intervened and disrupted their plans. As Bunhelier speculated, it would be King Sobyeol. Kraugel and the Chivalrous Robbers were no match for his power.

‘The apostles alone have a history of defeating King Sobyeol, but King Sobyeol was in a very disadvantageous position at that time.’

King Sobyeol, who was humiliated by having part of his divinity stolen by Zik—at that time, he was not only restricted by the Overgeared World, but also carrying several penalties on himself. He couldn’t reveal his true strength because he needed to act covertly. It was a stroke of luck for Zik’s group.

Now the situation had changed. The battlefield was located outside the Overgeared World, and King Sobyeol showed his power from the time he appeared. He was unconditionally powerful. The level of his attacks meant that if it wasn’t for Baal’s power, it would mean that King Sobyeol was many times stronger than Baal.

Of course, King Sobyeol was also a child of a God of the Beginning. He could be equivalent to Baal. But it didn’t make sense that he was stronger than Baal. Baal was the ruler of a dimension, while King Sobyeol wasn’t.

‘It might be different if he got the power of items.’

-What is going on?

The Blue Dragon still hadn’t grasped the situation. While the incident occurred outside of the Overgeared World, the location happened to be on the East Continent, yet somehow the Blue Dragon wasn’t aware of it.

‘Is it because its level is low?’ Grid felt it was strange.

Then Bunhelier explained it to him, “As far as I am concerned, the level of the Blue Dragon isn’t trash. There is a high probability that a barrier is hindering its senses. Squeak.”

“It must be the work of the Hwan Kingdom, right?”

“That is valid. King Sobyeol noticed Kraugel’s intrusion while the Blue Dragon was unaware of the disturbance itself.”

Was there a barrier around the habitat of the imoogi that the Four Auspicious Beasts didn’t recognize...? There was only one meaning.

“It seems the creature called the imoogi is ruled by the Hwan Kingdom. It must be insignificant even if it claims to have a yeouiju. Squeak.”

“Yes.”

He felt sorry , but what could he do? There was no guarantee that there was only one imoogi in the first place.

Grid controlled his mind and instructed the Blue Dragon, “Contact the other gods and tell them to come after me.”

-Yes.

At the same time that the Blue Dragon replied, the divinity of all the Four Auspicious Beasts spread across the continent like wildfire.

The Four Auspicious Beasts—they were of the same origin and could communicate even across a distance.

The Blue Dragon’s nose rose high out of pride. It had the honor of chasing after Grid faster than any of the other Four Auspicious Beasts. It didn’t know what was going on, but it thought it would be fun to wait leisurely for the other Four Auspicious Beasts after arriving at the scene beside Grid.

-...…!?

The Blue Dragon was feeling a strange sense of superiority, only to be startled. It was because the Red Phoenix had arrived before it knew it.

The god of fire who gave Grid its precious heart and nestled in Grid’s mental world—the Red Phoenix had been taking care of people’s livelihood by constantly burning its body. It had a high hierarchy as well as a noble character. It had a position to read Grid’s inner thoughts.

Thus, it started moving even before Grid uttered the call. It didn’t care that this was the realm of the Blue Dragon.

-You...

The Blue Dragon felt a subtle confusion from the moment it figured out the identity of the mouse.

Now it had all types of feelings toward the Red Phoenix, who came to its territory without permission.

It was followed by a chill. A snowstorm blew. Grid was reminded of the snow-covered city where Mir stood alone.

-God is reminding you of your sins.

-I made another big mistake...! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Blue Dragon was suddenly awakened by the accusation of the Red Phoenix and became devastated. Many people had lost their homes due to the anger it left behind. Trying to make the same mistake again?

Bunhelier stared blankly at the Blue Dragon who was hating itself. The slight confusion in the eyes of the little mouse puzzled Grid.

However, it wasn’t an important issue right now. Grid hurriedly used Shunpo. It was a rush that went beyond speed. Even the Four Auspicious Beasts couldn’t keep up with the movement through space.

***

‘He is arriving late. Did he get a quest from the Blue Dragon?’

Several peaks of the vast mountain range collapsed due to the great bow that ignorantly fired a huge amount of divinity. It meant that quite a lot of time had passed since the appearance of King Sobyeol.

This place might not be the Overgeared World, but it was unlikely that Grid couldn’t detect an anomaly. Nevertheless, he hadn’t arrived. It meant he was in a situation where he didn’t immediately notice the commotion.

Even if he had figured it out by now, he couldn’t arrive on time. This was an area dominated by the Sword Immortal’s rule of law. Even Hwang Gildong, who was good at stealth, took hours trying to find the entrance.

“This it it. No, it isn’t?” They were wandering right now. Hwang Gildong kept being confused about the location of the imoogi he had found.

“It is like a living creature. The format of the formations was changing in real time. Can he afford to keep us in check while dealing with Sobyeol?” Hwang Gildong didn’t hide his admiration. He seemed to be in awe of the Sword Immortal.

Kraugel shattered his illusions. “The Sword Immortal has no reserve strength.”

The Super Sensitivity was particularly sensitive to sword energy. It was one of the secrets behind a Sword Saint boasting an overwhelming win rate against those who wielded the sword.

The sword energy of the Sword Immortal was being read by his senses and it was weakening in real time. It was like how True Clouds had faded before he knew it.

King Sobyeol said, [Yeoam, put aside the meaningless talk. I will make you my right hand if you obey my will right now.]

[What do you mean?]

[Just take the bead without an owner.]

[Do you intend to be the sky?]

[Are you distorting it? It is all for the sake of heaven.]

Unlike when he was dealing with Kraugel, King Sobyeol didn’t speak in words when conversing with the Sword Immortal. He conveyed his intent to the target by inscribing his will into this space. It was proof that he was fighting with all his might. They moved at a speed that words couldn’t keep up with, so they changed their way of communicating.

‘An Absolute...’

It was still a long way off for Kraugel.

Grid had already preceded him, no matter whether it was saving the ‘world’ beyond the confines of nations and continents, earning the worship of humanity, or becoming an object of reliance to dragons and attaining the supremacy of an Absolute.

This meant it was difficult to follow Grid’s footsteps unless there was a new, great crisis.

There was no other way to reach the hierarchy of an Absolute than to silently accumulate victories while maintaining the dignity of a Sword Saint who took victory for granted. But even that standard method had long fallen by the wayside. At some point, Kraugel chose a life of companionship over a life of obsession with achievements alone, even if it was somewhat slower.

He talked about connections. That’s right. Kraugel had also come to resemble Grid. He changed in the process of repeatedly interweaving with Grid. It was just like the other Overgeared members.

“It is better to go to the left.” A voice was heard from the shadows. It was the voice of Faker.

The head of the Overgeared Shadows—hiis intelligence and stealth skills were the best among the players.

It was no less than Hwang Gildong of the east. No, it was clearly beyond Hwang Gildong.

In addition to grasping all the information of the West Continent, the Overgeared Shadows was in the process of absorbing the intelligence network of the Chivalrous Robbers. It was because Hwang Gildong failed to refuse Grid’s continuous requests for cooperation.

Moreover, Faker’s own status exceeded that of a transcendent. The experience accumulated by silently following the battlefields where Grid walked was immense. He properly utilized the Kill List and fought several times against beings with a higher status than him.

Such a bigshot—

“It is on the left again. Decapitate the straw doll you see in front of you. I can’t do it, but it will be possible with your swordsmanship.”

He came to Kraugel in time to support Kraugel.

It was the power of connections. It was the tower of connections where Grid established the framework and the Overgeared members built together. Now it worked flawlessly even in Grid’s absence. It was extremely rare for them to betray each other. It was an artifact like no other in the world.

At this moment, Kraugel indirectly experienced part of the realm of an Absolute. It was by acquiring the shadow called Faker.

“Wait! Are you crazy? Be careful. There is a forest of intangible swords that respond to an intruder’s presence...” Hwang Gildong exclaimed.

“If it is the same as Yeo Yulan’s techniques, the third from the end in the upper right corner is the key.”

Baaaaaaang!

“......!”

Hwang Gildong’s eyes widened.

The Sword Saint, who suddenly took the lead like a madman, eventually destroyed the forest of intangible swords. The Sword Saint could easily cut anything, but this was clearly a result that went beyond the limit.

It was because the formations of the intangible swords set up by the Sword Immortal infinitely overlapped. Originally, cutting off one side was pointless. It was only right to be pressured by the intangible swords that immediately reappeared as much as the number that disappeared. But the Sword Saint cut them all together...

“There are many devices that are deeply entrenched in the history and culture of the east. It is better to rely on this person again.” The shadow finished giving advice and was silent.

Just in time, Hwang Gildong came to Kraugel’s side and started making a fuss. “This is the road I saw earlier! What is this? Did you hear God all of a sudden? Are you actually going to become a shaman?”

It was actually the Death God that he heard.

Kraugel smiled and followed Hwang Gildong. Nervousness was gone from his steps.

It wasn’t just Faker who arrived at the scene. He could feel that his other connections were gathering toward this place.

Kraugel suddenly had a thought. Why was Grid late? Could it be that the reason why he entrusted Kraugel with the difficult task of securing the imoogi rather than doing it himself was because he had a big plan behind the scenes?

‘Did he attract King Sobyeol here in order to invade the Hwan Kingdom...? Make a sound in the east and strike in the west. The real purpose is to inflict a serious wound on the Hwan Kingdom without attracting Chiyou’s attention.’

It was amazing. It was clear that Grid had developed a grand perspective in the process of destroying hell.

Kraugel was admiring it when a series of explosions occurred around him. It wasn’t because Hwang Gildong touched the formations incorrectly, nor was it because of the arrow of King Sobyeol.

“Go on.” It was Braham. The God of Magic and Wisdom burned everything that stood in Kraugel’s way.

The swamp that released poisonous smoke, the rocks protruding like blades, the false night sky that dazzled the mind, and even the persistent techniques of the Sword Immortal that worked even after becoming disgraceful—they collapsed without being able to endure the overwhelming power of the magic.

Grid’s true right hand man joined Kraugel.

At the same time—

Grid stopped using Shunpo.

The Three Masters—they were the ones behind the birth of the Crazy God and Crazy Dragon myth, and part of the few gods of the Hwan Kingdom. This group of idiots, who should’ve put their safety first, absurdly blocked Grid’s path. It was too coincidental to simply dismiss it as a coincidence. They knew Grid’s path and were prepared. They came to him to be killed.

‘Are they crazy?’ It happened the moment when Grid cocked his head in confusion…

“Didn’t you just build up your divinity a while ago? However, you immediately used Shunpo... it is a phenomenal talent. The God of Virtue must’ve taken many things into consideration when picking his wives. He is indeed a noble man.”

A storm raged as Pungsa talked.

“I’m afraid of the consequences of hurting you, but I’m not in a position to sit idly by. How can we care about our own well-being when we are on the verge of achieving our aspirations?”

“It is a critical moment. It is to the extent where you and Grid have temporarily set into motion a grand myth that you will never experience in your lifetime.”

The War of the Gods. We are now comparable to when we separated from Dominion...

The storm was overlaid with rain and wind while Unsa and Usa talked nonsense. It was literally a natural disaster. Every drop of rain had the power of an artillery shell.

The Three Masters regained some of their past status through King Daebyeol’s Bow and simply fulfilled the role of a weapon. They were capable of devastating any battlefield in no time.

Grid wasn’t properly armed because he was disguised as Basara, and he was pushed back a few steps.

Then the Three Masters had expressions of disbelief.

“You endured it?”

“There is something I’ve been doubting since I saw you using Shunpo. It seems reasonable to consider it as a polymorphed dragon...”

“A god and a dragon got married...? As expected, it is still the Crazy God and Crazy Dragon.”

“There is no change even if your identity is a dragon. We are in the prime of our power.”

Grid’s eyes went cold. He was angry at the Three Masters’ attitude of trying to harm Basara even though they knew her identity.

The little mouse’s anger was also formidable. “Are you talking about the Insane Dragon in front of me? Squeak.”

In the first place, killing them would cause the Hwan Kingdom to suffer damage equivalent to their destruction.

Grid would welcome it as well.

Bunhelier slowly raised the magic power that he had been suppressing.
