Chapter 1459

For the past three days, carriages after carriages, each filled to the brim with war supplies, constantly arrived in Reinhardt. The constant procession of carriages spread rumors that ‘the identity of the wealthy person who swept through the exchange is actually Grid.’

Grid didn’t deny it. Well, it was good to be seen as having a lot of money.

In fact, the effect of the rumors was great. The feet of the merchants who tried to rip off the Overgeared Kingdom were on fire. They used to act like masters every time they sat at the negotiating table. Now they fell flat like turtles. They didn’t expect him to buy iron ore for 200 gold to cover the supplies... this... it was just crazy.

The merchants were afraid of Grid’s violent power. They felt madness. They desperately realized that no matter how hard they struggled, they could never be able to best Grid. They didn’t know how much Grid was trying to protect them. The truth would only be revealed after the great human and demon war.

"Excuse me...?”

At a smithy made by remodeling a whole palace...

Lauel visited Grid and was speechless for a moment. The immortal lich, or the king of the dead, stood in front of the anvil while hammering. A dwarf, a noble race sacred to blacksmiths, was busy running around and helping with chores. It was an unbelievable sight.

“You came?”

The lich and dwarf helping Grid was Overgeared Skeleton Two and Ke ong. This smithy was smaller than the one built in the center of the city, but the reason why Grid was working here was because people’s attention was troublesome. If he got caught working with a lich, a lot of people would come in and make a fuss.

“It is unrealistic to see a lich working as a blacksmith. The reason for the coolness... is it because I have the black flame dragon?”

“What is all this nonsense? In any case, the Overgeared Skeleton has become cool.”

The black magic power was like a cloak and left an afterimage of magic power in every action. Even a boss monster wouldn’t be able to show this. Tap dancing while hammering was ridiculous.

“What is the book it is reading in the middle? A forbidden magic that drove me to death in my previous life...?!”

“...It is Madra’s diary. The handwriting is strange, so it is taking it a while to interpret it. You are excited. Then the negotiations must’ve gone well?”

“Huhu, it is good overall, but they seem obsessed with supplies that blacksmiths have a high demand for. They said they can’t give up iron ore for less than 2 gold. Then I said I would stop.”

“Isn’t it a reasonable enough price at this point? I think the merchants have given in a lot?”

“It isn’t giving up, it is almost at the level of a plea. From their point of view, they would’ve sold it for several times or dozens of times cheaper than the purchase price, so they must’ve been in tears. However, we already have enough supplies. There is no need to be obsessed with high-priced items.”

“We need to be prepared for the worst. If we make a mistake or fail to make an item, it is common to consume more materials than indicated in the design. It also isn’t just us. The other kingdoms, including the empire, are trying to secure as much supplies as possible. Shouldn’t we buy a bit more before the market goes up?”

“It’s okay. I got a fixed price contract for the allies.”

“Are you part of the Communist Party?”

“Haha, there can be no completely free market. It is the role of the nation to guide the greedy people correctly when trying to damage the market economy. By the way... can the Overgeared Skeleton make a finished product?”

Lauel showed a somewhat surprised expression. He noticed that the items used by magicians, such as the staff, orb, and robes were being made by Overgeared Skeleton Two, not Grid. He was well aware that Overgeared Skeleton Two had the skills of a blacksmith, but was it qualified to make things used by the magicians of the Overgeared Kingdom? Even if Overgeared Skeleton Two had a blacksmithing ability, it wouldn’t reach the actual strength of blacksmiths, right?

Grid eased Lauel’s anxiety, “It’s fine. The items made by Overgeared Skeleton Two are almost the same as that of a craftsman blacksmith.”

As the lich’s understanding of magic improved, the technique of making magic items naturally developed. Similarly, it made progress in blacksmithing when Grid developed his blacksmithing skill. Currently, Overgeared Skeleton Two was responsible for making magic items while Overgeared Skeleton One, Ke ong, and the God Hands were responsible for chores and making the items for soldiers. Thanks to them, Grid had time to spare and was able to repair his items.

‘I’m going to make my old equipment new... the equipment containing the breaths and the divine swords can go in the direction of modification.’

[Overgeared Grid’s Innovation]

It was originally a skill called Legendary Blacksmith’s Reconstruction. It was a technique that reinterpreted items with a 100% understanding, changing or strengthening them. However, it was only available 10 times at the master level. Additionally, only one modification per item was possible.

This was why he wanted to use it during the second half of the game depending on circumstances. He had sealed it for a long time with the intention of using it only for the best items. Then, after gaining the Overgeared God’s Techniques, he lost the need. It was because the limit on the number of modifications was removed. Even the limit of only one modification per item had been eased to three times. In the future, it would be possible to use it freely.

‘If I knew this would happen, I would’ve used it earlier...’

The Legendary Blacksmith’s Reconstruction skill that disappeared with the opening of Overgeared God Grid’s Innovation... it was nothing more than a skill that reminded him of the old saying ‘it becomes dog poop after cherishing it.’ It was very regretful, but Grid quickly controlled his mind.

‘It is meaningless to regret what has already been done.’

It was the best choice at the time and as a result, it worked out well. Lauel left because he had something to discuss with Sima Qian. Grid saw him off and started the full-fledged work.

“Innovation.”

[Please select an item to innovate.]

Thanks to the evolution of his blacksmithing skill to Overgeared God Grid’s Techniques, the performance of his produced items had increased significantly. Additionally, the word ‘innovate’ itself implied a ‘change for the better.’ From now on, the power to innovate items was opened... it would be much more powerful than before.

***

“Huroi infiltrated as a spy and manipulated documents? A merchant group with the power to secure enough supplies isn’t a small neighborhood store. Is this possible? I don’t think even Faker can do this?”

“Due to this, Faker is completely in low spirits. If Huroi walked the path of an assassin, he would’ve been 1st in the rankings, not Faker.

“Puhaha! Come to think of it, Faker has a strong desire to win. In any case, Huroi did something really big.”

“What a hero. Whether it is sneaking in as a spy or cheating a merchant group, it is all done by using his mouth... I think that later on, he will be able to brainwash people with his words.”

“Hey, that is too much. It is giving me the creeps.”

Most of the Overgeared members gathered in Reinhardt. It was to participate in the upcoming hell expedition. In addition to the Overgeared members, many top rankers from other organizations applied for this expedition. There were also many independent rankers who came after hearing about the news through personal connections.

They intended to go to hell to experience the level of hell and build up practical training for the great human and demon war. It was just that the penalty in hell was bigger than they could imagine. There were many powerful demons and the abilities of the demonic creatures were also colorful. In the worst case, they might encounter a great demon. In other words, there was a very high chance of death.

The Overgeared Kingdom repeatedly warned them of this. Nevertheless, thousands of applicants showed up. The thing they had in common was that they were aware of the dangers of the great human and demon war. Just because they were players didn’t mean they were fools. There were many people who recognized the dangers of the great human and demon war and they applied at this time.

Of course, they couldn’t be purely trusted. There were all types of villains in the world. Lauel created guidelines to select among those who applied. He claimed that it was the ‘process of finding souls embroidered on the constellation of fate.’ It was simply nonsense. In any case, only 27% of those who applied were able to join the hell expedition.

“Once you enter hell and the penalty occurs,.. there will be many who can’t breathe or use mana due to the debuffs. It is part of the demonic energy addiction that occurs when stats fall below the qualified level. If you experience that phenomenon, don’t be shy and tell me straight away. Saintess Ruby can take action.”

“Ah... Yes!"

The rankers, who had half lost their souls from seeing the real Yura up close, came to their senses after hearing the terrible words. How severe was the penalty that it reached the extent of being unable to breathe or operate mana? They thought that this was truly hell, the area known as the final content. The Demon Slayer’s characteristic of becoming powerful in such a place was great and enviable.

“Toban, Miss Ruby, are you ready?”

“Yes!”

“Wait a minute.”

Saintess Ruby responded vigorously while Toban made a final check of his equipment and waved his hand. He was extremely nervous as he had the heavy responsibility of being the first to cross the hell gate.

“What if I go first?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“No.”

Regas suggested this because he was worried about Toban’s poor condition, but Yura firmly refused him. Yura got the black crystal castle in the last expedition and got fixed coordinates for the hell gate. The skill level was still low, but it allowed her to specify the coordinates of the hell gate, which had previously been set randomly. Thanks to the system’s acknowledgement of the stability of the black crystal castle... the location of the coordinates was ambiguous. It was the ‘entrance’ of the black crystal castle, not the inside.

To be exact, it was in front of the gate. Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a safe zone. It was impossible to predict what would happen the moment they crossed the hell gate. It would be hard to handle unless it was the combination of the 1st ranked Guardian Knight, Toban, and Saintess Ruby.

If Damian was still the pope, then Damian and Ruby would’ve been an ideal combination. Unfortunately, Damian changed to the Overgeared God Church and had lost most of his divine power. Additionally, Yura couldn’t go first. She had to stay in the human world for days and open the hell gates until all of the expedition members reached hell.

“This expedition can only take place if Toban and Miss Ruby move through first and build a sanctuary.”

The cooldown time of the hell gate was 30 minutes and only two people could go through at one time. There was a high probability that the level of the skill would rise during this expedition, decreasing the cooldown time and increasing the capacity. However, it was expected that the skill would only increase after 10 more uses. Until then, only two people could be set.

First of all, the role of the people crossing the gate first was the most important thing. The key was Ruby—a child who had been stimulated by not being included in the hell expedition led by Grid and worked hard to grow. Yura observed that her power would be able to ease the hell penalties the expedition would experience to some extent.

“......” Regas stepped back and glanced at Toban.Toban was trying not to show his nervousness, but his fingers were slightly shaking. It was natural to feel pressured. He had to be the first to enter the place where it wasn’t known what might happen and protect Ruby for at least 25 minutes. They couldn’t simply enter the black crystal castle and wait. They had to install a sanctuary for those who came later, but the installation took at least 25 minutes.

A 25 minute mission to protect the Saintess in the middle of hell...

Even the best players would find it hard to succeed.

‘Still, I have to do it. There are many people stronger than me, but I am the only tank who can maintain my power in hell.’

...Yet what if he failed? If he couldn’t protect Ruby and they both died, the schedule of the expedition would become twisted. It would be a disgrace to the Overgeared Guild as well as a nuisance to the hundreds of participants.

“Can you give the vanguard position to me?”

“......?”

Toban was trying to control his heart and the rankers were staring at him. Now they all focused their gazes in one direction. A low and beautiful voice—it was the direction that this voice was heard in.

“......!”

There was a reason for their hazy impression. It was a voice they hadn’t heard in a long time.

Step.Step.Step.

A long black dopo embroidered with a yellow dragon fluttered with the man’s steps. There was long, flowing black hair that created transparent waves in the sunlight. The hand placed on the sword sheath hanging from his waist could be described as a slender and delicate jade white hand. It was a beautiful man.

He approached through the falling autumn leaves with the scent of autumn and was as deep and beautiful as an Oriental painting. However, most people didn’t judge him by his appearance. They discussed his achievements and skills and hardly ever mentioned his appearance.

“K-Kraugel...!”

The Sword Saint—a man who made the title of sky above the sky fit even better.

“I want to protect this child.”

His always calm eyes showed a rare warmth. A friend’s flesh and blood. It was natural to treat this person preciously.

“Ah...” Ruby blushed lightly as she faced Kraugel.
