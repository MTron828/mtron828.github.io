Chapter 1898

‘I’m glad it is so close.’ Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The area of the West Continent alone was larger than Earth. The scale itself was directly linked to the difficulty level.

Carrying out quests while crossing the continent with limited means of transportation was extremely difficult. If people were lazy in real life, then they tended to be lazy in Satisfy as well. Thus, there were surprisingly many people who lived as natives of a certain region.

It had been a long time since Sticks restored the warp gate.

In any case, the size of the East Continent was also enormous. Lands with players as lords were still rare. The infrastructure was poor due to the harsh nature, but in terms of area alone, it was a bit ahead of the West Continent.

If the habitat of this imoogi was the opposite of the Blue Dragon’s area, Bunhelier would have to release Polymorph in order for Grid to arrive at the scene in time. It meant he would be exposed to Chiyou even sooner.

“How long will it take for Chiyou to descend?”

“It is around a minute,” Bunhelier replied immediately. He took into account that the Hwan Kingdom was a ‘pond looking at the surface,’ like Asgard.

As long as that pond existed, the gods were able to quickly navigate to a certain point on the surface and bring it into view. The Shunpo used at that time was called ‘descent.’ This was an advantage that the Overgeared World on the surface didn’t have.

“One minute...”

“He will react quickly to your presence. You know that Chiyou is obsessed with you. Squeak.”

Grid’s expression darkened.

The presence of King Sobyeol was gradually getting closer. It was huge. Even if he was in the Crazy God and Crazy Dragon state with Bunhelier, King Sobyeol wasn’t an opponent he could beat within one minute.

‘Should I fight a battle of attrition in this state and wait for an opportunity?’ Grid thought about it but immediately dismissed it.

The super-sized shadow that looked blurry even from a distance—the level of the monster believed to be the imoogi was also formidable.

The two yeouijus seemed to create infinite energy. It was right to see it as another dragon. It was a real exhalation of energy that went beyond a top dragon. It was physically impossible to deal with King Sobyeol and the imoogi simultaneously while hiding his true skills.

Bunhelier didn’t deny it either. “The yeouiju you mentioned... the fact that it could be mine is quite special. Squeak. Make a decision.”

Bunhelier’s voice was somewhat exuberant. It was a very subtle change, but Grid could feel it. It wasn’t just because of the senses of an Absolute. Before he knew it, Grid was able to read a little bit of Bunhelier’s psychology.

‘Come to think of it, quite some time has passed since I’ve started working with him.’

From the time of the hell expedition to the present, they had been together for quite a while. In terms of the length of direct cooperation, it must’ve been longer than Nefelina.

‘It must be quite sad for Nefelina.’

He would have to give her one more cow to eat when she was sad...

The poor Overgeared Kingdom no longer existed. The finances of the Overgeared Kingdom, which was reborn as an empire, were strengthened again and again in exchange for Rabbit losing his hair. It was to the extent where Nefelina could eat hundreds of cows a day.

‘That isn’t right?’ Grid felt a sense of guilt toward Rabbit, but it was only for a moment. He hoped for Nefelina to grow up as quickly as possible, so he made up his mind.

Grid declared, “I will do it in one minute.”

It wasn’t a question of possibility or impossibility. There was no other way in this situation. Additionally, Grid had built up a great deal of trust during his time with Bunhelier. He thought it was funny to talk weakly when he was cooperating with an Old Dragon.

“Okay. I will also do my best.” Bunhelier seemed to like it as well. The smile on the little mouse’s face rapidly widened.

To be precise, the snout itself grew. He was releasing Polymorph and regaining his original form. At this moment—

[The great myth, ‘War of the Gods,’ is activated.]

An unexpected event occurred on the battlefield, which was getting closer in real time.

[The one who activated the myth, ’King Sobyeol,’ has the power of ‘the protagonist.’]

War of the Gods, the leading role—Grid didn’t know exactly what it was. However, he already gained a hint from the Three Masters. Additionally—

[The battlefield is judged to be ‘Dimension: Asgard.’]

[The dimensional effect of Asgard is oppressing you. All stats are drastically reduced.]

[You have resisted.]

Grid was now free from the constraints of other dimensions. There was no need to mention Bunhelier, who was an Old Dragon. There was no need to be agitated by this unexpected event.

“Bunhelier, bless my friends as soon as you arrive.”

[A blessing?]

“It is a blessing to prevent the dimensional effect.”

[I’m not Raiders.]

It was impossible—Bunhelier, who had become completely huge before he knew it, replied in a plain manner.

“This damn thing,” Grid cursed.

The reason why Grid was struggling to obtain a yeouiju for Bunhelier—it was because Bunhelier couldn’t pay for everything he gained in many ways, unlike other Old Dragons.

[Trauka and Nevartan can’t do it either. Don’t talk too much.]

Bunhelier deployed Teleport with a frowning Grid on his head.

Teleport—it was the basic yet ultimate means of transportation. Under the assumption that certain coordinates were secured, it boasted a much superior convenience than Shunpo’s ‘long-distance travel only’ option.

The center of the battlefield that still wasn’t within range of Barbatos’ Vision. The Crazy God and Crazy Dragon appeared there, scattering the remnants of dark magic power.

[Is this possible?] King Sobyeol was stunned by the shadow that appeared over his head, only to soon react in disbelief.

‘Isn’t this crazy?’

Grid was shocked one step further. The most powerful reward obtained after succeeding in the Baal raid—since it was a passive skill that worked only in certain situations, it created a phenomenon that even Grid wasn’t aware of.

[Your myth is responding.]

[The greatest salvation myth, ‘Hell's Purification,’ is suppressing the effect of the great myth, ‘War of the Gods.’]

[The great myth, ‘War of the Gods,’ is resisting. Some verses from the myth will appeal to the world.]

-There were three Gods of the Beginning, but Rebecca, the Goddess of Light, was overly greedy.

-Hanul criticized the Goddess for starting to monopolize worship.

-The great gods responded to the will of the sky and punished those who were blinded by light.

-Who can fathom the deep inner thoughts of the sky, who caused a war in the eternally peaceful divine world and caused people on the surface to experience the pain and hardships they had experienced.

[Some verses from the salvation myth, ‘Hell's Purification,’ are imprinted on the world.]

-The source of all evil that distorted hell is the sin of the God of the Beginning.

-God Grid uprooted it and gave rest to humanity. Therefore, he must be greater than the Gods of the Beginning.

-Succumb.

Grid’s myth didn’t explain the context in detail. It just delivered the only truth in a simple and clear manner. That was enough. It was true that Grid’s myth, Hell's Purification, was greater than the myth of the God of the Beginning, who started the war out of jealousy and gave it this meaning as an excuse.

In reality—

[The great myth, ‘War of the Gods,’ is overwhelmed by the greatest salvation myth, ‘Hell's Purification.’]

The myth ‘War of the Gods’ still had many verses left, but it couldn’t refute it. The sound of glass shattering rang out in all directions. It was while suppressing the shouts that resonated with the momentum of recreating the War of the Gods.

[Yatan... he is truly pathetic.] King Sobyeol trembled. He wasn’t afraid of the hierarchy of a God of the Beginning. He blatantly criticized Yatan for causing the current situation by creating hell and giving birth to Baal.

Grid’s appearance was changing. His raised chest became flat and firm while his rounded shoulders and slender back became wider than anyone else’s. His blonde hair turned black. Finally, the gentle eyes that curved up as she smiled became sharp. The orange divinity that had been suppressed by Grid surged up like a tidal wave and engulfed the battlefield.

It was a wide-area buff. It wasn’t just Grid’s apostles. All the members of the Overgeared Guild had their stats increased. It was because they belonged to a religion called the Overgeared God Church.

It was just as the members of the Rebecca Church performed miracles whenever they received Rebecca’s divine message, or when the Yatan believers gained knowledge and strength from Amoract, who claimed to be Yatan’s representative.

Grid’s very existence gave the Overgeared Guild a great power. It was proof of the success of the Baal raid and its growing influence.

[You are armed with items handmade by Only One God Grid.]

[Your weapons and armor will respond to the will of the great god. The durability is greatly increased and the basic performance is enhanced. It has acquired a self-repair function, even if it is weak.]

The buffs here weren’t just the help of the system.

“Respond immediately.”

The members of the Overgeared Guild were familiar with most of Grid’s skills. It was a level where they quickly predicted what type of results his sword dances would produce in certain situations.

In the first place, they were the most talented people. They had been together for over ten years. They linked together so that Grid’s results could have a greater effect. This was the state that the top powers of the Overgeared Guild had reached.

[Kuek...!]

The six fusion sword dance used in the state of Crazy God and Crazy Dragon—this was very fatal to King Sobyeol, whose ‘protagonist’ authority in the great myth became useless due to Grid’s myth. He succeeded in defending against dozens of the linked attacks, but he was unable to absorb all the power and crashed to the ground.

At this point, Braham’s magic and Piaro’s crops were laid out like a trap.

The surprised King Sobyeol tried to use Shunpo just before his body touched the ground.

“Not a chance.”

It was useless. The reason was because the universe created when Euphemina cast her magic turned his vision dark. It wasn’t like a status abnormality. Magic status abnormalities couldn’t restrain an Absolute. However, the space itself was simply darkened. As a result, KIng Sobyeol couldn’t use Shunpo.

Of course, there was no way he would obediently be beaten. King Sobyeol, who absorbed Braham’s magic with his divinity, released it with even greater power. Piaro’s crops and Euphemina’s magic were burned. The problem was that it took time.

Bunhelier, who was carrying Grid, had been tracking him. Bunhelier’s tail struck King Sobyeol in the side.

King Sobyeol flew into the distance with his upper body bent into a bizarre shape. This was followed by a dark Breath and Grid’s long-range sword dance. Each one had a different trajectory.

King Sobyeol’s choice was forced in many ways. He desperately avoided the Breath while risking himself being cut to pieces by Grid’s sword energy as he used Transcend.

[Sword Saint...!] King Sobyeol barely soared into the sky only to find Kraugel, who had been waiting for him.

Anger and hatred were contained in King Sobyeol’s sword as he became speechless. He gave up his left arm to the sword that cut through the world and struck back, aiming for Kraugel’s heart. Unfortunately, it failed. It was because Jishuka and Yura’s sniping slightly twisted the trajectory of his sword. It was a shot that could be predicted because Grid limited the options for King Sobyeol, who was on the defensive.

“Endure it!”

Kraugel’s body, which had his collarbone cut rather than his heart being pierced, recovered quickly. It was thanks to the concentration of Saintess Ruby’s heals.

King Sobyeol had no time to resent them. The pursuit of the Crazy God and Crazy Dragon was continuing.

[This is... is this why you have been so obsessed with connections?]

Starting from humans who lived for only a moment to dragons, Grid had been curiously obsessed with ‘connections.’ It was an eccentricity that was completely incomprehensible for King Sobyeol, who was god from birth.

But at this moment, he realized it.

A group that moved like one body around Grid. The dozens of beings gathered at the scene were making Grid more complete. They were Grid’s hands and feet, his breath and his will. It could be described as a living Overgeared World.

Just then, Grid’s Twilight pierced King Sobyeol’s throat. Grid attacked the weak spot on the left side, which was exposed due to King Sobyeol losing his left arm. Bunhelier’s Breath followed. A black flash swallowed up King Sobyeol’s body and vision.

The buff magic of Braham and Euphemina, as well as Zednos and Laella, surrounded the flash. This contributed to the amplification of their power.

The imoogi was agitated by the turmoil that occurred in succession and tried to advance, but the rest of the Overgeared members risked their lives to stop it.

It happened a few days ago. It was shortly after Chiyou damaged Reinhardt and went back. Martial God Zeratul emphasized the necessity of him joining by arrogantly asking who else could stand against an Absolute.

After that, the apostles and Overgeared members had been constantly devising ways to confront an Absolute. Of course, the premise was that they had to cooperate with Grid. Nevertheless, they fully demonstrated their power at this moment.

It was thanks to Grid.

‘Is this team play?’

For the first time, he really understood the thrill of ‘large-scale raids’ that others had taken for granted.

‘...Shit.’

It was both touching and depressing.
