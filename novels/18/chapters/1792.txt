Chapter 1792

“Can’t you make Hexetia the object of the Trinity?”

In order for Khan to recover, he needed an angel to form a Trinity. Piaro pondered hard on Sariel’s words before asking another question. It was while taking out herbs grown referring to recipes from the Overgeared Magic Tower and alchemy facility. They were herbs that would rescue those who ate the undercooked meat cooked by Idan.

“It is cruel, but the positions of gods and angels are vastly different. Gods are relatively free beings involved in the governance of Asgard, while angels were thoroughly bound as beings used for Asgard. In particular, the free will of God Hexetia, a Chief God of Asgard, is stronger than the binding power of Asgard. This allows him to leave Asgard on his own. Meanwhile, Khan is different.”

Sariel’s expression gradually darkened. It was while using divine power to embrace those who had fallen after eating Idan’s dishes. She felt sorry for those who forgot and trusted Poison Master Idan just because he had become a legend. They could easily trust others, even though they had been deceived by the demons of hell and betrayed by the celestial gods every time. Indeed, most humans were naive and foolish. She felt a sense of responsibility to take good care of them.

“Simply put, God Hexetia currently doesn’t belong to Asgard. He doesn’t have the authority to form a Trinity with Khan, who is still bound by his status as an angel made in Asgard.”

Piaro understood at once. There was already a simple example in front of him. Sariel was unable to form a Trinity with the gods of the Overgeared World.

“Is your status still tied to Asgard?”

“Unfortunately, yes. I might’ve been expelled from Asgard and God Grid himself made me an Apostle, but the stigma of slavery on my soul still lingers faintly.”

Perhaps it was because she was a subordinate made by the Goddess herself, but she was bound by stronger restraints... Sariel was thinking bitterly as the atmosphere in the hall calmed down. It was the aftermath of Asmophel delivering the medicinal materials Piaro took out to Ruby. Ruby’s heals and purification skills were enhanced by the medicinal materials and quickly treated the patients who had food poisoning. It was made easier by Sariel’s divine power restraining the patients’ condition.

It was a type of Trinity. The Trinity of the farmer, Saintess, and angel.

Just then, Sariel had a tremendous realization. “...Something suddenly occurred to me.”

“What?”

Piaro was quite surprised because Sariel showed rare signs of excitement. Her pure white face was flushed.

“Khan’s origin is different from mine. Before he became an angel, he was a human. A man who became a legend. Unlike Archangels, ordinary angels can be free from Asgard’s binding force.”

“Um.”

“Of course, that alone won’t free Khan from Asgard. Like me, most angels will be bound to Asgard forever. However, things are pretty good right now.”

“Is the situation good?”

“Isn’t Khan a legendary blacksmith, God Grid a legendary blacksmith, and God Hexetia the God of Blacksmiths?”

“...Don’t tell me?”

“That’s right. It is a Trinity of a different standard. Then Khan might be able to recover his health right away...”

Just then, Grid returned to his seat and sat down. Sariel and Piaro immediately explained the situation to him and Grid asked Hexetia for help.

“It is a good idea. It was something that I was worried about. Now it can be solved well.”

“Wasn’t it something that couldn’t be solved even if I appointed a new angel?”

“It would’ve been solved if you had given someone the identity of an angel. The key is whether Khan would’ve been able to hold out until then.”

“......”

The angels of the Overgeared World were different from the angels of Asgard. Rather than creating a species called an angel, they were given the status. The premise was that the person had to possess at least three myth level items. It was a problem that time would solve. He could just appoint an Overgeared member as an angel as they would soon receive new dragon weapons and armor from Grid.

However, Hexetia was saying that time was too tight even for that. It could mean that Khan’s condition was much more critical than it seemed, or it could mean that it would take a surprisingly long time to create new dragon weapons and armor.

‘It could be both.’

In any case, Grid’s mind wasn’t at ease. He found out that he was causing pain to the precious person he had regained.

‘I thought everything would be fine if I brought him to the surface, but I did something without any countermeasures.’

He was glad that there were people around him who were trying to identify and solve problems on his behalf. He felt a new sense of appreciation and pleaded to Hexetia, “Then please. Please save Khan.”

“It is already settled.”

“......”

“There is no need for a grand plan. It is enough for me to recognize you and Khan as blacksmiths. Of course, it is impossible for my perception to exert any influence on you, but Khan is different. You should be grateful for the path you have walked. Thanks to all your experience, there are many concepts that symbolize you. The benefits you can bestow upon those who serve you are endless.”

Many of the gods of Asgard had a fixed role from birth. For example, Hexetia was the God of Blacksmiths and could bestow blessings or punishments on the blacksmiths who prayed to him. Hexetia could hear and respond directly to people’s prayers, but it was usually an interaction that occurred naturally, like the laws of nature.

In any case, most gods had a limited audience for whom they could answer prayers. On the other hand, Grid was different. He had so many symbols that almost every being could pray to him and get his blessings. It was like Hexetia just now. He prayed to Grid to respond as a blacksmith. This allowed him to form a Trinity with Khan. The Trinity of himself, Khan, and Grid grouped itself into the category of ‘most respected blacksmiths’ and it was a great success.

“I don’t know the precise principles, but... I will take it as a matter of great pride.”

“That is enough.”

Hexetia responded with a smile to the confused Grid. He trembled as he felt the greatness of the newly born god. Hexetia had witnessed the Gods of the Beginning and Chiyou, so he could see how great Grid’s potential was. It was because while praying to Grid, he saw how many beings in the world made Grid the object of their aspirations.

There were many gods besides himself. In addition to the gods, there were several dragons.

‘...It is especially the case with Bunhelier.’

Evil Dragon Bunhelier—he was different from the other Old Dragons who had heavy hips. Like a mayfly, he flapped his wings and traveled all over the world, committing evil every time. It was due to low self-esteem. It was just like Hexetia in the distant past.

Bunhelier was the only one of the Old Dragons to wander without any confidence in himself. He was anxious every day as he struggled to raise his status. A representative example of the one who suffered in the process was Nevartan. He fell into Bunhelier’s trap, who had obtained the cooperation of Baal and the gods, and went crazy...

‘A being who doesn’t trust others and only lives for himself has a longing for Grid.’

It could’ve been simply interpreted as Grid being great, but Hexetia was shocked. Bunhelier was a creature of great harm. He naturally shouldn’t be trusted and it would be better if there was no involvement with him.

‘...It isn’t something for me to worry about. Grid knows the dragons better than I do.’

Hexetia’s interest changed. The human being who instantly cooled the atmosphere of the party, which had been filled with joy and happiness—Hexetia started to focus on Trauka’s arm, which showed off its enormous size behind the back of the unusual chef, Idan.

‘It is about smelting the body part of an Old Dragon, which still has warmth. It won’t be easy.’

Trauka’s arm was still full of his intent. In fact, it could be taken as Trauka in its own right. Making battle gear from it? It was also a novel experience for Hexetia. After all, Trauka was a monster who made the Goddess personally come forward to sign an agreement with him.

Hexetia clearly remembered the absolute power of the monster who hunted the gods while wandering near Asgard. He was a different type of being from Bunhelier, who kept playing tricks behind the scenes. If Raiders symbolized the dragon’s nobility and Nevartan symbolized the dragon’s omnipotence, then Trauka symbolized the dragon’s power.

‘I’m getting goosebumps...’

An awkward smile spread across Hexetia’s face as he gulped. The more he looked at it, the more bizarre the scenery in front of him. Humans enjoying a party with the arm of an Old Dragon hanging like it was an ornament. They even used it as a food ingredient...

‘This world is definitely crazy.’

Could it have something to do with the sudden change in the Goddess’ attitude?

Hexetia seriously pondered on it before saying, “There is only one place on the surface to smelt that thing.”

“What is that place?”

“A god’s... tomb.”

It was a name that Hexetia himself found terrible to say.

Grid saw his somewhat hesitant expression and lamented. ‘As expected, it has to be the Overgeared Battleship.’

“Did you clear up the misunderstanding with Mercedes?”

“Um. She seems a little bit less angry...”

The three day party was over.

The Overgeared members immediately returned to their respective positions after hearing about the resurgence in bandits, made of the remnants of the former Saharan Empire who weren’t satisfied with the continent, and the demons who had flooded the surface in the aftermath of the Great Human and Demon War.

Yura also opened a gate to hell.

At this time, she was the only one who could stop Baal’s expansion in hell. In cooperation with Leraje and the others, she was making an effort to chase the traces of Asura. She made a brief appearance on the last day of the party and then went straight back.

“I understand her. Mercedes is Youngwoo’s knight and Apostle, right? She takes it for granted that she will fight and die for you, so it is hard for her to accept your desire to keep her safe.”

Yura understood exactly why Mercedes was sad not to receive Grid’s call.

“Yes... I see...”

Ultimately, this was a problem that would naturally be solved. If new dragon weapons and armor were made, Grid planned to work them thoroughly, even if Mercedes and the Apostles didn’t like it.

“I understand. I will work Mer as much as she wants... no, I will take care of it. Yura, don’t worry and focus on your work. I’ll join you soon with a new weapon as a gift, so don’t overdo it until then.”

Soon after leaving Yura—

“Shall we start?”

Grid called Khan and Hexetia, who were waiting in the distance. At the same time, a typhoon blew. It was the aftermath of the slow descent of the Tomb of the Gods, which had been floating high in the sky.

“The Trinity Blacksmith Trio, we’ll be back soon.”

“No, what?”

Why did he have to give useless names every time? Lauel grumbled as he saw off the excited and noisy Grid.

On the other hand...

“Um... I have to be careful.”

A new intruder arrived in Asgard. As the God of Magic and Wisdom, he quickly crossed dimensions.
