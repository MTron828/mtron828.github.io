Chapter 4032 Fighting Liao Bencang

“Dragon race, how despicable! You actually use such tricks?!” roared the Kunpeng patriarch.

This powder was the rust scraped from the chains of a Ghost Ship that Long Chen had daringly climbed, and it contained the terrifying power of time.

Even the Kunpeng patriarch’s powerful physical body could not resist the corrosion of time, so the wound instantly rotted and spread.

Feeling the pain, the Kunpeng patriarch roared and twisted, trying to throw Long Chen off.

However, instead of throwing him off, Long Chen used the Kunpeng patriarch’s twisting momentum to slash his other wing.

Just like that, Long Chen applied the rust powder to the other wound. He then leisurely sneered, “First of all, I’m not from the dragon race. Second of all, in terms of despicableness, who can compare to your Kunpeng race? You were the ones who surrendered and begged for mercy, but then you schemed against the dragon race. I’m simply returning the favor. But even ignoring all that, you, a three-flower Earth Venerate who has lived for countless years, actually had the face to attack me, someone in the initial Immortal King realm. Did all your years of cultivation go to thickening the skin of your face?”

The Kunpeng patriarch struggled crazily but was unable to throw off Long Chen. It was like Long Chen was anchored to him, and no matter what he did, he was unable to throw Long Chen off.

The Kunpeng patriarch finally began to grow worried. Even someone as powerful as him was pushed to the brink of death by Long Chen. If this continued, there was no way for him to heal his wounds. Stopping the corrosion of the rust was exhausting a huge amount of his core energy.

As a result, he was growing weaker and weaker. Furthermore, Long Chen was like a leopard eyeing its prey. As soon as the Kunpeng patriarch revealed an opening, he would launch a fatal blow.

“Return to human form! How else are you going to throw him off?!”

Countless experts shouted at the Kunpeng patriarch. They wanted to help, but they couldn’t get close without being injured by his wild flailing.

With that person’s reminder, the Kunpeng patriarch shrank, taking human form. It was precisely at this instant that Long Chen forcibly tore off his wings, causing the Kunpeng patriarch to shriek once more.

“Hahaha, idiot. Transforming into human form severely limits your power. Did you think that you could protect this pair of wings in this state?”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Long Chen laughed. But suddenly, he put away his smile and apologized. “Sorry, I was rude. You and Kun Tu are my precious clients. I shouldn’t laugh at you, or I won’t have any clients in the future.”

“I will kill you!”

With a furious roar, a blood-red halberd appeared in his hands.

BOOM!

In front of the Kunpeng patriarch’s attack, Long Chen simply swung his fist, and the Kunpeng patriarch was knocked back three steps. As for Long Chen, his body merely swayed ever so slightly.

“Having lost your wings, it’s like you’ve lost half of your cultivation base. What can you possibly rely on to act arrogantly? Your thick face that is stronger than city walls?” sneered Long Chen.

He didn’t know if it was because of the true dragon essence blood flowing within his veins, but beating up the Kunpeng race brought him a great deal of pleasure.

Suddenly, the space behind Long Chen trembled, and a sword burst through, carrying a torrent of faith energy.

BOOM!

Long Chen retaliated, swinging his fist once more, but his arm trembled with the impact. Agonizing pain then bloomed on his bleeding knuckles.

Long Chen looked back. As expected, the attacker was the Nine Underworld Hall’s Liao Bencang, who had a shocked expression now. His faith energy was supposed to be unstoppable. However, he barely broke Long Chen’s skin with this attack, not even close to harming his bones.

“It seems that your true body has finally come. If I kill you this time, I will truly be a god slayer.” Long Chen glared at Liao Bencang darkly, his eyes full of icy killing intent.

After all, the Nine Underworld Hall specialized in hunting down nine star heirs before they grew up. This act was akin to harming Long Chen’s kin as he was one of them.

Furthermore, back in the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen almost died to the Nine Underworld Hall’s experts. In that battle, far too many people had died, and it had brought him endless pain.

Although Lord Brahma was the true master behind the scenes, Liao Bencang was the executioner who had carried out his orders. So, Long Chen would have his revenge today.

“Let’s settle everything now!” Long Chen eyed the spatial gate and then took a deep breath.

With Huo Linger absorbing the hell flames, those dead spirits were no longer being burned, and so there was no longer as much resentment. As a result, the hell gate was unable to absorb enough energy to activate.

Everything was still under control. With no immediate urgency to destroy the gate, Long Chen's priority shifted toward seeking revenge for the fallen nine-star heirs.

“Ignorant brat, who do you think you are?! A god slayer?! Keep dreaming!” Liao Bencang sneered. The next moment, a god statue appeared behind him, enveloping him in holy light.

Endless faith energy then flowed around him. Behind this giant statue were countless smaller statues.

Every single statue was like a depository of faith energy, representing one of his inheritances.

After all, the Nine Underworld Hall was spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. In the mortal world, it was unknown just how many followers they had, so their faith energy accumulated over countless years was unimaginable.

This was the most terrifying point of god cultivators. They were gods that used the lives and faith of countless people to build up their position.

As a result, the power of a god cultivator didn’t solely stem from their realm or divine items. Instead, it derived from the abundance of faith energy they possessed.

Having summoned his original divine statue, Liao Bencang was mobilizing all of his faith energy, causing his aura to ignite. Despite being only in the World King realm, his current aura was even more terrifying than the three-flower Earth Venerate Kunpeng patriarch’s.

“As long as my faith energy is not extinguished, my soul is eternal. You will never be able to kill me. I can easily crush a mortal like you,” said Liao Bencang coldly.

“Oh? Then I want to test out if this so-called eternal existence really exists.” Long Chen’s blood suddenly began to circulate many times faster. Following that, the golden spherical runes in his body were awakened, letting Long Chen enter his strongest state.

The endless power in his body threatened to erupt out of him. Long Chen then slowly reached back for the hilt of his saber.

The moment Long Chen gripped the Minghong Saber, killing intent as vast as a sea instantly locked onto Liao Bencang, causing the world to become still.

The saber was unsheathed with a soft sound, instantly drawing in all the murderous aura in the world without leaving a single trace behind. A giant saber-image then tore through the wall of the heavens, slashing down on Liao Bencang.

Long Chen held nothing back with this attack. He only had one thought: to kill Liao Bencang!
