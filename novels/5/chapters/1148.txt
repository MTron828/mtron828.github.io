Chapter 1149 Once More Fighting Han Zhenyu

Translator: BornToBe

This person was wearing a conical hat that blocked his face. Furthermore, this conical hat was a special tool that isolated him from divine sense.

But Hua Shiyu, Zhao Ziyan, and all the others knew who he was.

“Han Zhenyu!”

Their hearts shook. They hadn’t expected Han Zhenyu to appear here.

A large hand tore off the hat, revealing a scalp that looked like centipedes were wriggling all over it. He was indeed the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s strongest expert of the junior generation, Han Zhenyu.

Back then, Han Zhenyu’s cultivation base had been at the third Heavenstage of Foundation Forging. But today, he was already at the seventh Heavenstage. His terrifying aura could be sensed even through the barrier, causing all of them to tremble.

Han Zhenyu was a rank seven Celestial and had an innate suppression over lower-ranking Celestials. As soon as he released his aura, he made them all feel like a mountain was crushing their hearts. It was hard to breathe under that pressure.

“If you don’t want to die, then obediently surrender. We don’t want your lives. We just want to have a chat with the Xuantian Dao Sect,” said Han Zhenyu.

“Hmph, what would you chat about? You came all the way to the Xuantian Dao Sect’s defensive region to sneak attack us. It’s clearly a premeditated provocation, so what is there to talk about?” replied Hua Shiyu coldly.

Long Chen continued to hide himself. He secretly told Hua Shiyu to speak with Han Zhenyu to see if they could dredge up any useful information.

“Since you want to die, don’t blame us for being ruthless.” Han Zhenyu frowned and extended his hand. The Seven Stars Reflect on the Runic Sea manifestation appeared behind him, causing heaven and earth to tremble.

“Senior apprentice-brother Han, these are all beauties. Killing them would be too regretful. Is it possible for us...” That disciple who had once fought Tang Wan-er pled with him.

“I’ll give you an incense stick’s worth of time. If you can’t capture them, kill them all,” ordered Han Zhenyu after a moment of hesitation.

“Haha, many thanks, senior apprentice-brother Han! Don’t worry, that prettiest one will be yours!”

Hua Shiyu’s expression was ashen. She was unable to comprehend how these Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples that were also part of the Righteous path could be so despicable.

What she didn’t know was that the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples didn’t cultivate the Dao. They cultivated magical arts. Their requirements for the physical body were low, and they focused more on Spiritual Strength. To a man, having a weak physical body could be a fatal blow to their confidence.

Which man didn’t want to have the strongest body? But they didn’t have that. No matter how powerful their magical arts were, they weren’t able to make up for that feeling of inferiority at the bottom of their hearts.

People who felt inferior normally wanted to show how amazing they were in front of everyone to cover up the weakness in their hearts. So the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples were all arrogant and insulted others to display their strength.

Other than insulting and looking down on others, they had another way to build up their self-esteem. And that involved women. When they subdued a woman, they would feel a kind of comfort, especially when it was a strong woman. The stronger the woman they subdued, the more pride they would feel.

Therefore, a lot of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples had their heads filled with lecherous thoughts. To put it frankly, their hearts were a bit twisted. They were a bit better than the eunuchs in the royal palace, but only a bit.

Now seeing all these women, all of them had a lecherous light in their eyes. Certain places were already bulging. Only by subduing powerful women could they feel like men.

“Brothers, it’s up to your own abilities! Attack! Ten Thousand Spirit Restrictions!”

Following the shout from the first disciple, the other disciples waved their staves, and over ten thousand illusory spirit beasts appeared out of the barrier.

There were wolves, insects, tigers, leopards, birds, and fish. Each person was controlling one.

Suddenly, the barrier brightened and the beasts roared. Even though they were protected by the flying boat’s defenses, the Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples felt like they were about to faint.

That had been a sound wave attack. Trapped within the barrier, the sound waves repeatedly echoed. And as they continued unleashing this attack, the magnitude only grew more intense.

Seeing the beauties holding their ears with pained expressions, all the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples smiled lecherously.

They didn’t even notice a large figure slowly approaching them. An azure light condensed in the air. Its sound was blocked out by the sound waves of their magical arts.

“Han Zhenyu, it’s been a while! Is your face still well?”

Long Chen’s voice contained a special energy that made it resound over the sound waves. It was far more domineering than the sound waves.

His voice was like a dragon’s roar, and it even caused the barrier to shake. Long Chen didn’t know any sound wave attacks, so he had merely backed his voice with the power of his spiritual yuan. The attacking disciples lost the ability to hear anything for a while just from how loud his voice was.

Seeing Long Chen, all the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples’ pupils shrank, and Han Zhenyu’s expression changed. He had never imagined that Long Chen would be hiding amongst the women. A feeling of unease suddenly rose from his heart.

“Something’s up! Run!” ordered Han Zhenyu.

Regretfully, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples were still unable to hear anything after Long Chen’s roar. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A huge azure light smashed into the barrier, instantly blowing it apart. The azure light also exploded, unleashing berserk energy.

The disciples were all located at different parts of the barrier. But this explosion of the azure light, this one attack, instantly killed half of them.

The disciples who were far away enough to escape the explosion were still injured by the backlash of the barrier exploding, and they wildly vomited blood.

This attack was naturally from Cloud. Thousands of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples had been killed in one blow.

The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples still didn’t know what was happening. Long Chen had already arrived in front of Han Zhenyu. Blooddrinker pointed toward the sky.

“Han Zhenyu, let me see how much you’ve progressed during this time to dare come seeking death again.”

Han Zhenyu found himself locked down by Long Chen’s saber. Not daring to be careless, he hastily took out his golden sword.

Han Zhenyu was sent flying, shocked. Even though he had reached the late Foundation Forging realm, he was still unable to use his superior cultivation base to suppress Long Chen.

Although Long Chen was only at the third Heavenstage of Foundation Forging, he had spent five hundred and fifty million yuan spirit stones to reach that level.

His 108,000 immortal platforms gave him immense power. Even Long Chen didn’t know how powerful he was now.

After sending Han Zhenyu flying with one blow, Long Chen looked back at Hua Shiyu and the others who were still dumbstruck. “Kill them all! You don’t need to worry about them running because Cloud will kill them. I’ll cut down this idiot Han Zhenyu!”

Long Chen was already after him. Han Zhenyu had his manifestation active, and a golden giant appeared behind him. It held a golden sword.

This golden sword was the King item sword he had used before. Now he had given it to this giant.

“Hmph, I’ll let you see my Golden Battle General’s power!” roared Han Zhenyu. He flew to the head of the golden giant. Forming hand seals, he sat directly on its forehead.

Suddenly, the golden giant swung his sword and sneered, “Long Chen, this is a magical art I just learned. Today, I’ll use you to practice with it, letting you be the first person to be killed by my Golden Battle General!”

Long Chen was a bit surprised. Han Zhenyu had actually merged with his golden giant to better control it. It was his first time seeing such a magical art.

“Die!” Han Zhenyu roared and slashed the giant golden sword at Long Chen.

Long Chen sneered, “You’re the one who will die.” His divine ring appeared behind him, and four stars appeared in his eyes. Blooddrinker slashed out.

BOOM! Huge waves exploded on the sea and soared up into the sky. The other fighting disciples hastily circulated their spiritual yuan to defend against the impact.

The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples were surprised to see that the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples were taking out shields to block the sea waves. They actually stopped attacking.

“Their physical bodies are weak! Kill them!” cried one of the Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples. Ignoring the waves, she unleashed a full-strength sword attack.

“Bitch, you’ve gone mad! You’ll also die like this!” roared the disciple being attacked.

“Then let’s see who will die!” The female disciple ignored his cry. Her sword shattered that person’s defense, and at the same time, they were struck by the terrifying sea wave. She vomited blood and shot back, while the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciple was directly blown to bits by the wave. The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples’ eyes brightened. This was a good chance.

They all ignored the waves to unleash full-strength attacks and were heavily injured by them. But the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples who had their defenses broken were all torn apart.

Quite a few of their souls flew out and tried to escape, but the female disciples unleashed powerful spiritual magical arts that completely extinguished them.

Hua Shiyu and Zhao Ziyan were going all out to kill them all. Both of them were fighting against hundreds of them at the same time, and it went without saying that they were powerful. They were temporarily tied.

“Split the Heavens 3!” Blooddrinker hacked down, smashing into the golden sword.
