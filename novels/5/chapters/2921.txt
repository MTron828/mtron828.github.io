Chapter 2910 Power That is Not Human

Yuan Xinghui’s rod unleashed a wild gust of wind that stabbed like knives on the skin of the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples. It almost stopped them right in their tracks.

However, in the face of this attack, Long Chen didn’t even look at him. His gaze was still on Tang Yaochen. He indifferently said, “You schemed against me…”

Just at that moment, Yuan Xinghui’s rod smashed onto him, but he raised his hand and caught it just like that.

“What?!”

All the people, both the disciples inside and the experts outside, were shocked. They had seen just how powerful Yuan Xinghui was. Even so, his full-power attack was caught just like that, as if it was child’s play.

Hence, Yuan Xinghui was shocked and infuriated. He felt like his attack was like a clay ox that had fallen into the ocean, vanishing without a trace. He then tried to pull his rod back, but he found that it seemed to have become rooted in Long Chen’s hand. He couldn’t budge it.

His arms flexed and his body shook as he tried to pull and push his rod. However, even after doing everything he could, it remained stuck. All the time, Long Chen’s expression was indifferent, while Yuan Xinghui’s face was turning purple.

The experts outside were delighted to see this. The power that Long Chen displayed stirred them.

“Truly foolish.” Luo Bing looked at Yuan Xinghui contemptuously. What was he doing? He was still trying to drag back a weapon that had been lost instead of letting go and running while he could.

Holding the rod, Long Chen didn’t seem to sense Yuan Xinghui’s struggles. He then continued walking toward Tang Yaochen. “Your actions have really displeased me. Furthermore, you used a formation to trap my Berserk Blood Mammoth so that you could kill it. You were the ones who forced me to do this. I don’t really like killing people, but you seem to really want to see me killing. Fine, I’ll show you all Boss Long San’s true abilities today…”

Long Chen suddenly moved. With a flick of his wrist, Yuan Xinghui’s giant body was lifted into the air easily. That terrifying power shook everyone’s hearts.

“Power that is not human…” The head judge murmured to himself.

Yuan Xinghui began to fall. As for his rod, it was now swung toward him with greater power than he had ever wielded it with.

“No!” In the air, Yuan Xinghui had no means to avoid it. He could only watch as his own rod smashed into his waist.

BOOM!

Yuan Xinghui’s giant body exploded into a mist of blood. He was left without a corpse.

Seeing this scene, the other experts were silent. Long Chen still had the rod in his hand, while in front of the rod was a blood mist that was slowly scattering. This scene was terrifying.

Even more than that, Long Chen’s expressionless gaze that didn’t have the slightest ripple due to what had just happened was horrifying.

“I wanted to kill Tang Yaochen first, but since you were in such a rush, I decided sending you off first was alright.” Long Chen looked at the blood mist in the air. He slowly put down the rod and then turned toward Tang Yaochen. “Sorry for that. Someone cut in front of you. But I’m sure you won’t mind.”

A fierce sensation of death enveloped Tang Yaochen when he met Long Chen’s gaze. His whole body quivered. However, with Chu Kuang, Li Chengbei, Xiang Kejie, and dozens of other experts in front of him, he felt that he should be safe. He sneered, “Who do you think you are? You’re just a trash ascender from a lower world, and your current accomplishments are all thanks to luck. Do you think that you’re unbeatable? Do you think that you can kill me? Then come!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen looked at him and gradually smiled disdainfully. “I’m not a formation cultivator. But I have a brother who is, so I have some superficial knowledge of formations. That knowledge isn’t really useful most of the time, but when it comes to killing you…”

Long Chen suddenly vanished. Just as everyone was stunned, he reappeared in front of Tang Yaochen like a phantom, grabbing the latter’s throat.

“It should be enough.” By the time he finished speaking, Tang Yaochen’s life was in his hands.

The experts around Tang Yaochen jumped because Long Chen had actually appeared in their midst in an instant. However, when they were about to attack him, he vanished once more, returning to his original location. But Tang Yaochen was still in his hand.

He was truly like a phantom. By the time Chu Kuang and the others reacted, he was already gone.

Chu Kuang and the others didn’t understand and neither did the disciples watching. All they had seen was a blur, and then Tang Yaochen was in Long Chen’s hands. They had no idea what Long Chen had done.

Tang Yaochen was held in the air like a dead dog, filled with horror. He wanted to struggle, but he couldn’t move.

“I want to kill you, and here I am. I, Long Chen, have said trash and foolish words before, but I have never said any empty words.”

Looking at Tang Yaochen’s terrified gaze, Long Chen indifferently explained, “When you first transported me back, I knew that you were starting a performance. Hence, when you started to activate the second transportation formation, I absorbed a bit of your formation’s power. Although I only know a bit about formations, I’m capable of short-range teleportation with it.”

On the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen had learned quite a bit about formations. But this branch of knowledge was too profound, and he was only capable of learning some fundamentals. He had done this because he was worried about fighting formation cultivators when Xia Chen wasn’t present.

Furthermore, he found that the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art possessed a strange ability to absorb a bit of energy no matter what kind of energy it was. Although he didn’t really know how to use it, nor did he have time to study this topic, today, he had absorbed a bit of the transportation formation’s power when Tang Yaochen had tried to send him out again.

Before this, Long Chen didn’t immediately attack because he was calculating the spatial location, nodes, and distance based on the methods that Xia Chen had taught him.

Fortunately, they were less than a hundred meters apart. If they were too far, this bit of energy that Long Chen had absorbed wouldn’t have been enough. Furthermore, his calculations wouldn’t have allowed him to teleport accurately.

However, for such a short range, he succeeded on his first try. Tang Yaochen was now in Long Chen’s hands, and his body suddenly quivered. After that, everyone saw his pants become wet.

This genius who had quite a bit of fame in the Formation Institute had actually wet himself in terror. He was actually so weak. Hence, countless people looked at him contemptuously.

“I…” Tang Yaochen’s throat suddenly thickened and he forced out a shout.

However, before he could admit defeat, Long Chen’s hand tightened its hold. With a crack, Tang Yaochen’s head was ripped off of his body.
