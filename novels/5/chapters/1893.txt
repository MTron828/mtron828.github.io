Chapter 1883: Profound Spirit Dao Scripture

Long Chen and Mo Nian high-fived, laughing . They hadn’t expected things to go so smoothly .

“Long Chen, this con of yours almost made me believe it too . Amazing,” praised Mo Nian .

“It’s all thanks to your cooperation . To make all the runes of the palace seem to echo my voice, that’s really amazing . ” Long Chen chortled . Mo Nian’s cooperation had made things practically seamless .

“It was only as good as you . ”

“You’re too courteous . ”

“Hahahaha…”

The two of them began to laugh again, as if they had just had a major victory .

Seeing them like this, Yue Xiaoqian also couldn’t help smiling . These two were like children, acting like conning others was some particular accomplishment .

“Hehe, I really want to see what the three of them look like now,” said Mo Nian .

“That’s right, who was that fellow who looked not man nor woman back there?” asked Long Chen .

Mo Nian’s lips curled . “That fellow is Gui Can, one of the Corrupt path’s Three Kings . He’s an irritating fellow . He specializes in spiritual attacks and is very difficult to deal with . I once had a fight with him, and he actually raises evil bugs within his body . I almost ended up vomiting . He’s just that disgusting . Ugh, let’s not talk about him, I can’t bear it . Just be careful of his spiritual attacks . ”

Long Chen nodded . So he was one of the Corrupt path’s Three Kings . No wonder he had been capable of standing alongside Di Feng and True Immortal Jiaoqi .FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Now he had seen all of the Three Kings . Xie Luo, Ming Jie, and Gui Can . It seemed that the Corrupt path viewed killing him as a must this time . They had sent three experts on that level at once .

As the three of them entered the palace, the originally dim palace suddenly lit up, revealing a statue .

It was a statue of a thin man who looked to be a scholar . His face was relaxed and content, as if he stood aloof from the world of mortal affairs .

“It’s an ascender!” exclaimed Yue Xiaoqian .

The so-called ascenders were ones whose souls had left the coils of their mortal husks to become gods or immortals .

This statue was surrounded by divine light, giving off a holy feeling . He almost looked like a real person, but his skin had a jade-like luster to it .

“Having entered my home, you must have destiny with me . It’s nice to meet you, little friends . ”

Suddenly, the statue transformed into motes of light . Within that light was the scholarly man . He looked alive and spoke to them .

Long Chen, Mo Nian, and Yue Xiaoqian all jumped, looking in shock at him .

“Senior, can I ask if you are an ascender?” asked Yue Xiaoqian .

“Ascension? No, I didn’t have the power to ascend . Because I was sick of everything about this world, I buried myself here . I left a portion of my inheritance, leaving a strand of my soul to guard it . What you are seeing is just a wisp of my soul,” said the scholarly man . He smiled, but that smile seemed a bit forlorn .

“Senior, I heard someone say that ascension is a scam . Is that true?” asked Long Chen .

The scholarly man looked at Long Chen calmly and didn’t reply immediately . Instead, after a moment’s observation, he suddenly smiled . “So a gamebreaker has come to my place . How unexpected . Then there’s no need for any trial . I’ll give you my inheritance . ”

The scholarly man closed his eyes and suddenly transformed into golden dust that surged toward the top of the palace .

From that location, a pillar of light descended right through the center of the palace . At the same time, chanting began to ring out .

“This is the Profound Spirit Daoist Scripture! It can absorb heaven and earth’s energy and transform it into any other kind of energy!” exclaimed Yue Xiaoqian .

Long Chen was delighted . “Then you should hurry and accept the inheritance . That way, you’ll be able to use your full power even outside the Skyscraping World . ”

“But…” Yue Xiaoqian looked at Mo Nian . She wasn’t so shameless as to automatically accept this treasure .

“This kind of technique is useless to the two of us . You should hurry up,” said Mo Nian . This cultivation technique truly didn’t suit the two of them, but it was extremely important for her .

Most importantly, she even knew the name and origins of this inheritance . She was clearly the best pick .

Yue Xiaoqian nodded and walked into that pillar of light . Soft light enveloped her .

She sat down within it . Bursts of light transformed into a lotus flower throne for her to sit on, making her look like a goddess .

BOOM!

Suddenly, the gates blew open . Di Feng, True Immortal Jiaoqi, and Gui Can came charging in .

“Long Chen, Mo Nian, face your deaths!”

Furious roars rang out as powerful experts charged over to the two of them like an angry flood .

There were over three thousand of them now . They had sent out a call for reinforcements that had summoned all the nearby experts .

These three thousand experts had managed to fully open the gates and charge in . Upon seeing Yue Xiaoqian within the light, their eyes turned green .

“Kill!”

Di Feng, True Immortal Jiaoqi, and Gui Can were about to unleash powerful attacks when they suddenly became still .

Divine light had wrapped around their bodies, and their cultivation bases were sealed . They were unable to unleash any magical arts or Battle Skills .

True Immortal Jiaoqi had been the furthest . He had unleashed a powerful punch at Long Chen, and Long Chen had been planning on receiving it with his own fist .

However, just as the two of them were about to clash, divine light enveloped and separated them .

“A no-fighting zone?!”

Everyone was shocked . It was actually impossible to use martial might within this space . This kind of restriction was something they had only heard of in legends .

One of the Corrupt experts tried to charge into the pillar of light, but it rejected him, sending him flying away . There was no way to enter the light .

Long Chen and Mo Nian were delighted by this . They had been worried about others trying to disturb Yue Xiaoqian, but now it seemed that they didn’t need to worry about it .

“Hahaha, how coincidental to run into you here! Are you all doing well?” Mo Nian waved to Di Feng, True Immortal Jiaoqi, and Gui Can as if they were old friends .

The three of them were ashen with suppressed fury . What coincidence? All of them had been conned outside . They wanted to tear Mo Nian and Long Chen to pieces . Seeing them smiling so brightly, they felt like their lungs would explode .

“Long Chen, Mo Nian, you’re actually colluding with this demon woman of the original devil race in an attempt to topple my ancient family alliance! From today onward, there will be no place for you two on the Martial Heaven Continent! Anyone related to you will be annihilated . I wonder if you’ll still be able to smile then!” shouted Di Feng .

“That’s right, the Martial Heaven Alliance might very well have participated in this collusion, and of course, there’s no doubt that the Xuantian Dao Sect was part of it! They must be destroyed, killed to the last!” roared True Immortal Jiaoqi .

Following their lead, the other experts added in their own comments . Long Chen and Mo Nian became the targets of everyone’s criticism .

“You’re so laughable, why can’t I smile? The two of us chased down this expert from the original devil race for the safety of the Martial Heaven Continent . We spilled so much blood and sweat, risking our lives to defeat her . To do this, we’ve crossed high mountains and deep lakes, torn our way through thistles and thorns, and finally trapped her here! Just as we’re about to succeed, you come barging your way in? What, are you trying to take our success? Nice try!” sneered Long Chen .

“Bullshit! You’re clearly with that demon woman!”

“You’re the one spouting bullshit . Do you have any proof?” Long Chen turned his nose up in disdain .

“Just the fact that you would save her is proof enough!”

“When did I ever save her? I attacked Di Feng because he bullied my brother . It was revenge . Once Di Feng fled like a dog, we started chasing her down . Did you ever hear me say a word to her? Did you see me fight alongside her? No, you didn’t, but did you see her enter first and us chase after her? People like us, handsome men overflowing with looks and intelligence, wisdom and heroism, loyalty and righteousness, style and elegance have actually been turned into fiends that want to topple the continent by your words . It seems all your hearts are filled with darkness, selfishness, wickedness, and resentment . To actually want to slander us, two brothers, the only thing that can be said is that you’re all trash . ”

“Brother, your words are entirely correct . I’ll testify for you . Don’t worry, we won’t be affected by such shaky evidence . No, it can’t even be called evidence . Anyone who tries to slander us is insulting the concept of justice and committing blasphemy against the Heavenly Daos, a betrayal against the Martial Heaven Continent . It’s being disrespectful to the gods…” Mo Nian was even more exaggerated, turning the two of them into god-like existences .

“Shut up! Who do you think you are to compare to gods?! No matter what you say, the three thousand of us all say that you are colluding with that woman of the original devil race! It’s iron proof!” roared an expert from the Xuan Beasts .

He wanted to turn the two of them into pulp, but there was some kind of mysterious energy making it impossible for them to use martial force . Even their divine items were restricted . Otherwise, they would have long since torn through the two of them .

“Long Chen, no matter what lies you spout, it’s useless . We all saw it, and that’s our evidence . This is reality, and even if it’s not the truth, it becomes the truth,” sneered True Immortal Jiaoqi .

“Did you record that?” asked Long Chen .

Mo Nian nodded . “Yup, it’s all recorded . ”

Clearly, the two of them had just been waiting for True Immortal Jiaoqi’s words . This was admitting to framing them .

Hearing this, True Immortal Jiaoqi was infuriated . He had been used again . He was about to burst into curses when the entire palace shook . The pillar of light enveloping Yue Xiaoqian grew even brighter .
