Chapter 3520

Before Long Chen could knock on the next house, its wooden door slowly opened. After that, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan’s hair stood on end.

They saw a skinny and tall man with horns on his head and a pair of bat-like wings on his back. Long Chen almost struck him with his saber on instinct.

“Winged devil!”

Long Chen instantly recognized this lifeform. Although the latter had reserved his devil qi, Long Chen had killed countless devil race experts. So, he was extremely sensitive toward this aura.

Long Chen grabbed the hilt of the Minghong Saber and stared at this devil expert vigilantly. This was an absolutely terrifying winged devil expert. How could he appear in the Wine God Palace?

That winged devil smiled at Long Chen’s vigilance, and this smile made Yu Qingxuan shiver. It revealed his sharp sawtooth-like teeth. It was frighteningly sinister.

“Your hands are dyed in the blood of my winged devil race. I haven’t even formed any hatred with you, so why are you staring at me so hatefully?” said that devil expert lightly.

Long Chen was shocked. Was this devil also part of the Wine God Palace? The Wine God Palace actually permitted the devil race’s people to come and learn how to make wine?

“That’s because your winged devil race slaughtered my brothers. I personally watched countless innocent humans die to your sharp blades. Why don’t you tell me why I would stare at you so hatefully?” said Long Chen coldly.

“Innocent? If that word came from someone else’s mouth, then I might accept it. But when it comes from the human race’s mouth, it’s much harder to accept it. You’ve already come, so come in and try the wine brewed by my devil race. See if it’s to your taste.”

After saying that, the devil expert actually gestured, inviting them in.

Yu Qingxuan couldn’t help looking toward Long Chen. This devil expert’s aura was too terrifying. She was unable to calm down.

Long Chen was very shocked at first, but he quickly calmed down. The Wine God Palace’s doors were truly wide open. They didn’t differentiate between races, and anyone who wished to could learn about the Dao of making wine.

After all, the Wine Dao was a Grand Dao. Hadn’t he intentionally spread the Starry River of the Sky Art as well? If good and bad were differentiated solely by race, then that really would be a generalization.

Long Chen nodded toward Yu Qingxuan, indicating her not to be afraid. They walked in just like that.

Inside the room, they found that it was a bit different from the other rooms. They kept feeling a sinister aura inside that made them uneasy.

“The two of you are the first guests to come and taste my wine other than my apprentice-brothers and sisters ever since I came to the Wine God Palace thirty-seven thousand years ago. I don’t know if my poor wine will be able to satisfy the two of you. I’m nervous.” The winged devil race expert smiled at them.

He was clearly a terrible and brutal winged devil, but his words were very refined. Furthermore, other than that devil qi, Long Chen was unable to sense any other hostility.

The devil expert took out a jug. It was made from the bones of another lifeform, and the wine cup was also made out of bone. Moreover, when the wine entered the cup, it was actually ink-black. Yu Qingxuan frowned. She couldn’t drink such a thing.

“Please.” The devil expert gestured.

Long Chen raised his cup. He then sniffed it lightly and was surprised. “Ink bamboo fruit? Black crystal blood rice? These are all ingredients from the devil world.”

“Of course. I am originally from the devil world. The immortal world’s things clash with my nature. I cannot fully merge my mind with them, so I can only use the devil world’s items to make wine. Please try it,” said the devil expert.

Long Chen nodded and took a light sip. He was moved. “Good wine.”

“What part of it is good?” asked the devil expert.

“I didn’t expect that someone from the devil race could have such devotion to making wine. Your entire heart and spirit were put into it. There is a strong evil qi and a weak righteous qi. But the evil qi is unable to suppress the righteous qi no matter what. Thus, it forms an endless cycle. The wine energy spreads throughout the body in a cycle, refreshing the mind. It also allows one to sense the Heavenly Daos clearer. It truly is a good wine,” said Long Chen, barely capable of believing it.

How could a lifeform of the winged devil race make such fine wine? Furthermore, it was made with the devil world’s ingredients. Hence, Long Chen found it unbelievable.

Based on his understanding, the winged devil race was innately evil. They were greedy, tyrannical, and liked to kill and loot.

In fact, he viewed them as lower grade lifeforms that only thought of slaughter. But this winged devil expert had toppled this perception.

“Hahaha!” The devil expert laughed delightedly. “For you to be able to sense such a thing, it means that we are the same kind of people.”

“No. I am a decent human,” said Long Chen, refusing to accept such a thing. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“A decent human? Not necessarily!”

The devil expert looked at Long Chen with a smile that didn’t seem to be a smile. “My winged devil race’s people are innately evil. No matter what I do, the wine’s evil qi will always be above its righteous qi. If someone who was purely kind were to drink this wine, it would be no different than drinking poison. For you to feel such a thing after drinking it proves that you are the same as me inside. Your evil thoughts far surpass your righteous thoughts. Thus, when you say that you are a human, I believe it. But as for being decent, perhaps only you are clear on the veracity of that.”

“Hey, don’t talk nonsense. My friend is right here. I’m going to become hostile. Remember, I am a good person,” warned Long Chen.

Right now, he was doing his best to give Yu Qingxuan a good impression of him. If this fellow exposed him, her good feelings toward him would diminish. She might even be on guard against him. In any case, that would enrage Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan was speechless when she saw Long Chen’s threatening appearance. That appearance was like he refused to admit to it even if he were to be beaten to death. She couldn’t help smiling. He was actually threatening such a terrifying winged devil expert? Most likely, this matter would cause endless jaws to drop if it was spread.

“Alright, you can count yourself as a good person…” said the devil expert hastily. “You are a good person, okay? Come, try this other wine that I made.”

The winged devil race took out new wine and gave it to Long Chen. When Long Chen drank it, his qi and blood flipped. After that, a certain energy within his body grew active.

It was the dark energy within him. It was excited. Hence, Long Chen jumped in shock and stared at the devil expert.

The devil expert smiled slightly. “In truth, both of us have heart-devils. Your heart-devil is evil, while my heart-devil is good. You want to suppress your evil side, while I also thought of how to erase my good side. But even since throwing myself into the Wine Dao, I gradually came to comprehend many principles that I never thought of before. This so-called devil is nothing more than an opposing voice that you don’t want to hear, a will that you don’t want to face. Just who is the devil? That probably depends on your standpoint. In the same way, good and evil, right and wrong, there are no absolutes when it comes to these things. What do you think about this?”

Long Chen was silent for a long time before he nodded. He had no way to retort.

Suddenly, the winged devil expert’s hand reached for Yu Qingxuan’s throat. He was as quick as lightning. As Yu Qingxuan had no defenses, she cried out in shock.

“You’re courting death!”

Long Chen’s rage instantly exploded and his hair stood on end. He smashed a fist at that devil expert.
