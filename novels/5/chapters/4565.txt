Chapter 4554 Routing With Violence

“Brothers, don’t be afraid! The survivors are all injured from the blast. We can crush them easily. The time of the mixed beast race has come, and every single one of you is a main character. Use the blood of your enemies to illuminate the glory of the mixed beast race! Use your bravery to carve the name of the mixed beast race into the depths of everyone’s soul! In the future, the name of the mixed beast race will be synonymous with fearless heroes. Anyone who dares to be enemies with the mixed beast race will suffer an unbearable loss!” shouted Long Chen.

When it came to raising morale, Long Chen was unparalleled. The mixed beast race had never heard such a passionate speech before.

Even an ordinary person would feel their blood heating up after hearing such a speech. Yet, to the mixed beast race who constantly faced suppression and bullying, these words were like a potent elixir, igniting their souls. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Their eyes instantly turned scarlet, burning with flames of emotions. In front of their old enemies, their most primal killing desire was fully unleashed.

In their berserk state, the mixed beast race’s experts launched furious attacks, displaying a combat power that sent shivers down the spectators’ spines.

BOOM!

Fighting their leader, Feng You unleashed a devastating blow that made it spit out blood and fly back.

Long Chen was startled by this result. When he looked at Feng You, he saw that she was like a different person. Runes flowed all around her, and there was the image of an ancient phoenix on her forehead.

Now, Feng You looked like an awakened ancient phoenix, her blazing Blood Qi filled the sky.

“Oh...” Long Chen hadn’t expected the one most affected by his little speech to be Feng You. When her essence blood ignited, even the Golden Crow race’s expert whom they had passed by felt fear toward her.

“Die!”

Feng You’s spear pierced toward the leader. This Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey had been fighting evenly against her, but after Long Chen’s speech, she went crazy, and every blow forced it back.

At this moment, the void beside Long Chen twisted, revealing the butt-assaulted golden monkey.

No one knew what kind of divine ability it used, but it popped out like it had teleported. However, even before its emergence, Long Chen already swung his hand without so much as a glance.

To everyone’s surprise, Long Chen’s hand seemed to intercept it before it even appeared. The timing was impeccable, the strike landing precisely as the monkey materialized.

Pow!

The monkey seemed to have teleported just to send its face to Long Chen’s palm. When his palm struck its target, a violet lightning rune flashed on it.

The golden monkey’s head burst on the spot, but to Long Chen’s surprise, it was still alive.

“I should have put in some more energy,” grumbled Lei Linger.

“That’s enough,” Long Chen laughed. If Lei Linger had put in any more force, although that monkey would be dead, his own hand would have been injured.

While the monkey survived now, it was spinning from being slapped so hard. Before it landed, the mixed beast race’s experts had torn it to pieces.

While Long Chen slew this golden monkey, on Feng You’s side, she unleashed another strike that forced the monkey leader to spit out blood.

All of a sudden, the monkey leader let out a few shrieks. It actually borrowed the force of Feng You’s attack to flee.

Once it fled, the rest of the desolate beasts fell into chaos and tried to run as well. However, the mixed beast race had surrounded them, not letting their old enemies off no matter what.

As for Feng You, she didn’t chase their leader and just went after another one of their top experts, killing her target in just a few moves.

Another six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit appeared in Long Chen’s primal chaos space, originating from the non-butt-assaulted monkey. To be fair, the butt-assaulted one also yielded a six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit, adding to Long Chen’s impressive bounty.

Other than the six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruits, there were countless others, littering the ground beneath the Heavenly Dao Tree. They quickly covered up the tree.

“It seems that the one to flee was a seven-star Heavenly Doyen on the same level as Feng You.” Long Chen looked at these fruits curiously.

Up until now, Feng You was the strongest Doyen he had ever encountered. She should be on par with that monkey leader and Ying Tian.

However, Feng You wasn’t that strong before. According to Long Chen’s estimate, she had been a six-star Heavenly Doyen and had transformed after obtaining her ancestor’s inheritance.

In other words, the rankings of Heavenly Doyens could change. He wondered if there were eight-star and nine-star Doyens as well.

Just as Long Chen was wondering, the mixed beast race’s roars brought him back to reality.

The aftermath of the battle left the ground strewn with lifeless bodies. The sight of the golden monkey corpses, in particular, filled the mixed beast race’s experts with satisfaction. For so many years, the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkeys had constantly tormented them, but now, their vendetta was finally settled.

Feng You descended gracefully, her flames gradually subsiding. In the recent battles, she had vanquished numerous formidable foes. Aside from the six-star Heavenly Doyen, none could withstand a single strike from her.

The mixed beast race had just gone through an intense battle, but all of their warriors were still in high spirits, appearing completely unstoppable.

Taking advantage of them still in their peak condition, Long Chen went through the battlefield and gathered the corpses. Not resting at all, they continued onward.

In front of them was a group of the devil race. When Feng You and Long Chen arrived, they didn’t say anything and just opened a path for them.

They could see that they couldn’t stop the mixed beast race, knowing that anyone who fought them would suffer.

However, this kind of state would not last for long. The deeper they went, the more dangerous it would be for them. Once they stopped advancing, there would be no going back. In the eyes of the devil race, the mixed beast race was extremely foolish.

None of them wanted to fight these crazy people because they weren’t idiots, so they directly opened a path for the crazies.

Long Chen seemed to have long since expected this, so he directly led the mixed beast race forward. The disturbance of their battle had drawn the attention of countless individuals. Having seen the mixed beast race fighting like madmen, these people did not wish to antagonize them, so they all got out of the way.

The further Long Chen and his companions went, the more experts they would see. If they were to encounter a faction that far surpassed them in power, they would be doomed.

At this moment, the mixed beast race’s people still seemed somewhat insane. Seeing these powerful factions opening a path for them, they felt an unprecedented excitement. Even if they couldn’t enter the Fantasy Spirit World, they were already satisfied.

Outsiders might struggle to comprehend the depth of their emotions, but after enduring years of neglect and relentless bullying, they felt this sense of existence more important than anything else.

After passing by a dozen factions, Long Chen finally raised his hand to make them stop. Before them stood a group of experts cloaked in ominous black qi, emanating an aura of impending death that sent shivers down the spines of the mixed beast race’s warriors.

From among those experts, an extremely large bald man walked straight toward Long Chen. When he appeared, Feng You instantly clenched her spear.
