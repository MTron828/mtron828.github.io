No one had expected Long Qihua to unleash his power here. A terrifying aura locked onto Long Chen, causing him to feel as if the weight of the entire universe bore down on him. Cracks spread in every direction through the martial stage.

This scene shocked countless people. After all, this martial stage was designed specifically to withstand the mightiest attacks from the top ten experts of the Heaven Rankings. Even Long Ziwei’s final attack, which obliterated Long Qingyun, couldn’t damage the martial stage. Yet now, beneath Long Chen’s feet, the martial stage was crumbling. What unfathomable pressure was Long Chen enduring?

“AH!”

While Long Chen resisted the urge to spit out blood, he furiously shoved Evilmoon forward a bit more, causing Long Zaiye to scream in agony as he clutched his head. Long Zaiye couldn’t bother with Long Ziwei anymore and just let him slide out of his hold. As Long Ziwei staggered away, he coughed up blood, feeling as though the pressure might crush him to death.

Although the pressure was primarily directed at Long Chen, with less than one percent affecting Long Ziwei, it was still unbearable for him.

“You want to see who’s more ruthless? Come at me! I’ll slaughter him! If you kill me, my father will return and ensure all of you join me. If you dare, just try it,” taunted Long Chen, his bloodlust boiling.

Indeed, Long Qihua’s power far surpassed Long Chen’s, but relying solely on this pressure to immobilize Long Chen and save Long Zaiye was unrealistic.

Long Chen boldly used his father’s name as a shield, refusing to believe they would dare to kill him. Back then, Long Zhantian had deliberately threatened everyone in front of the gate to the ninth heaven, knowing the Heaven Overseer would relay his words back to the Long clan. As a result, Long Chen believed the old foxes would hesitate to act against him, as it contradicted their profit-oriented nature.

In large clans like the Long clan, emotional ties weren’t the most important thing, so Long Chen knew they wouldn’t kill him due to Long Qingyun’s death. The Long clan didn’t have the guts to do so. After all, if Long Zhantian could slaughter his way into the Long clan once, he could do it again.

Long Qihua was taken aback by Long Chen’s boldness and got increasingly angry. He had given Long Chen a high estimation, so he exuded enough pressure to crush disciples like Long Ziwei and Long Qingyun to pulp. Even Heavenly Chosen would be unable to move or even lift a single finger under this pressure. Long Qihua had thought that he could break the deadlock like this and save Long Zaiye.

Despite his disdain for Long Chen, Long Qihua had no intention of killing him. As Long Chen had calculated, that wasn’t the Long clan’s style. Killing him offered no tangible benefits, and the clan’s regulations would not condone it. On top of all that, there was also the threat of Long Zhantian’s vengeance.

The fact that Long Chen could still threaten Long Zaiye under this pressure was unexpected. He still maintained precise control over his movements, only pushing his saber in deeper without delivering a killing blow.

Long Qihua was now caught in a difficult position. The air was filled with Long Zaiye’s wailing, a result of Evilmoon secretly extracting his blood soul energy. This process was akin to forcibly draining his life force, causing him agony a hundred times worse than any torture.

With each scream, the Long clan’s reputation took a hit. Although Evilmoon could only extract a bit of his blood soul energy and could not store it, that didn’t stop it from carrying out the torture.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“That’s enough!”

Just then, another figure walked over. It was someone with only an Earth Saint cultivation base: the Heaven Overseer. Despite his lower cultivation, Long Qihua had no choice but to retract his pressure.

The moment Long Qihua stopped, Long Chen sighed with relief. It had felt like a hand squeezing his throat, suffocating him. Now, he could breathe again.

Although Long Chen harbored no goodwill toward the Long clan, he also didn’t have any bad feelings about the Heaven Overseer. This person didn’t seem as foolish as the others.

Long Chen then pulled Evilmoon out of Long Zaiye’s head. Freed from this threat, Long Zaiye suddenly turned and launched a fist at Long Chen.

Everyone gasped, and even Long Qihua’s expression changed. Long Zaiye had gone crazy, daring to ignore the Heaven Overseer’s words.

As Long Zaiye turned, a hand covered in dragon scales viciously slapped his face. It was as if he had intentionally turned into the slap for a perfect hit.

Long Zaiye was sent flying like a shooting star, smashing into the spectator stands around the martial stage and leaving a large hole in them. He vanished amidst the rubble, and no one knew where he landed.

Everyone’s jaws dropped. This outcome was something none of them had even imagined.

Long Chen seemed to read the future, predicting exactly how Long Zaiye would move and striking at the perfect moment. Even Long Qihua was stunned by the flawless timing of the attack.

After slapping Long Zaiye, Long Chen sensed his aura fleeing into the distance. He had clearly run off somewhere. Staying here would only embarrass him further, so running was actually his wisest decision. With the Heaven Overseer present, there was no way he could fight Long Chen, and complaining about it would only cause him to lose even more face. For once, Long Zaiye actually made a smart choice.

After a moment of shock, the Heaven Overseer smiled awkwardly. “Long Chen, it’s been a long time. Since the last time in front of the gate to the ninth heaven, your power has once more grown. Very admirable!”

“Thanks to your blessing, between the struggle to gain and lose face, I can barely live with dignity,” said Long Chen with a slight smile.

Long Chen then pulled Long Ziwei up. Noting his broken bones, Long Chen directly fed him a medicinal pill and lightly said, “Surviving this ordeal with only broken bones is a testament to your resilience. You should thank the first Heavenly Saint. Now you can say you’ve clashed with an expert of his caliber. It’s an honor you can carry for the rest of your life.”

At this moment, Long Ziwei’s soul had practically fled his body. Unlike Long Chen, he could not resist that pressure, which weighed not just on the body but also on the soul and will.

Long Ziwei knew that Long Chen was taking a dig at Long Qihua. He should cooperate and say thank you, but he couldn’t force those words out of his mouth no matter how he tried. He could only admit that he was a coward.

“Heaven Overseer, I still have business elsewhere. Goodbye!” Long Qihua cupped his fists to the Heaven Overseer and vanished. It was best to leave this kind of place as fast as possible. Otherwise, Long Chen’s mouth would burn him alive.

“Come, let’s find a place to chat,” said the Heaven Overseer as he gestured to Long Chen. Long Chen then brought Long Ziwei along with them.

Following that, a series of news exploded like bombs within the Long clan.
