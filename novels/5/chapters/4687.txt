Chapter 4676 Sovereign Dragon Roars at the Heavens

"A group of ants! Fuck off!”

The Sovereign clan expert’s fury ignited, and he plunged his spear into the void, triggering an explosion. A ring of lightning then expanded, enveloping all the charging experts.

Struck by the ring of lightning, many experts were blown back by the brutal force. Blood sprayed from their mouths, and many suffered gruesome injuries, their flesh torn apart and their bones exposed.

“What?!”

While they knew that the Sovereign clan expert was an unfathomable existence, based on the rules of heavenly tribulation, his realm had to be on the same level as theirs.

Each of them was a monstrous genius, unrivaled within their respective realms. Yet, the Sovereign clan expert could just send them flying with a single ring of light. Just how strong was he?

This wide-area attack swept them all away, but it showed everyone the disparities among them.

The likes of Luo Changsheng, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yin Jiushang, and Yu Zihao were only blown back. Thanks to their protective divine items, they weren’t injured.

On the other hand, many of them took rather heavy injuries from this one blow. No one knew whether it was because they thought too much of themselves, or they lacked strong divine weapons to protect them, but they were so badly injured that they temporarily lost their ability to fight.

“This is my fight with Long Chen. Anyone who dares to interfere will be killed!” declared the Sovereign clan expert. He attacked Long Chen, his spear piercing toward him.

At the same time, a resounding dragon cry reverberated through the air, sending shivers down everyone’s spines and draining the color from the world. It seemed as though it had flipped heaven and earth, plunging the world into chaos with a single attack.

Long Chen remained vigilant as he knew that this was the Sovereign clan expert’s peak condition.

“Lei Linger, it's time for us to fight alongside each other.”

Long Chen then extended a hand, and from within the tribulation, millions of lightning dragons flew into his hand and formed a lightning saber.

Long Chen rapidly swung it, unleashing four saber-images. On the fifth slash, the four saber-images were devoured by his fifth slash.

“Split the Heavens 5!”

He had merged five slashes almost instantaneously. Previously, Long Chen would have struggled to achieve this feat with such speed, lacking the refined control and endurance necessary to withstand the backlash of such instantaneous actions.

However, it was different now. After comprehending the Nirvana Scripture, Long Chen used this insight to rebuild the nine forms of Split the Heavens, so he was now capable of unleashing all five forms at once.

When the five saber-images merged into one, it slashed down. The world howled as it sliced through it. The next moment, one saber and one spear crashed together in front of countless horrified gazes.

BOOM!

Divine light exploded, and spatial cracks spread in every direction. It was as if this very world almost shattered.

Long Chen’s lightning saber broke in this clash, and he now raised his arms to block the spear.

BOOM!

Long Chen was blasted backward, one of his arms almost destroyed by the Sovereign clan expert’s spear.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors jumped in fright. Long Chen’s blow had seemed unrivaled, but it still couldn’t stop the attack of the Sovereign clan expert. This ancient expert was too terrifying.

“Why are you not taking out that saber?”

After forcing back Long Chen, the Sovereign clan expert frowned even more. He knew that Long Chen had Dragonbone Evilmoon now, so he couldn’t help but feel that Long Chen’s reluctance to use it was akin to underestimating him.

“It’s still in the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest and can’t come for now,” replied Long Chen helplessly as he healed his arm.

Lei Linger’s lightning blade might be good enough against others, but it was a far cry from being able to match the Sovereign clan expert.

If Long Chen had Dragonbone Evilmoon, he wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage. In fact, Long Chen did have the urge to grab Dragonbone Evilmoon right now.

Suddenly, the void quivered, and a divine diagram silently appeared behind the Sovereign clan expert. This was Yu Zihao’s Brahma Divine Diagram. He had taken this opportunity to launch a sneak attack on the Sovereign clan expert.

“Courting death!” This cowardice act fueled the rage of the Sovereign clan expert. He then threw his lightning spear toward the Brahma Divine Diagram.

In response, protective divine runes flowed on top of the diagram, stretching around the spear as if any pressure would only cause it to stretch, not break. However, just then, cracks appeared throughout the diagram.

In the distance, blood sprayed out of Yu Zihao’s mouth and then poured out of his eyes, nose, and ears. Despite the injuries, he had a twisted smile on his face. The divine statue behind him now had lightning circling it, growing brighter and brighter.

“He actually used senior’s power to strengthen his manifestation!” exclaimed Guo Ran. They were all startled by this move.

“Hehe, with my master’s protection, you can’t touch me. I am the true chosen one of the heavens!” Yu Zihao gritted his teeth, looking at the Sovereign clan expert with a twisted delight.

“Scram!” the Sovereign clan expert bellowed. His spear then quivered, and the cracks in the Brahma Divine Diagram worsened. It looked to be on the verge of exploding. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Seeing this scene, Yu Zihao was horrified. His divine statue suddenly blazed with the light of a sun, as he hastily drew the power collected by the Brahma Divine Diagram into his manifestation.

However, the Sovereign clan expert’s power was far too concentrated and destructive, and the statue was unable to absorb that much energy. If this continued, the Brahma Divine Diagram would be destroyed.

Suddenly, a pill cauldron smashed into the Brahma Divine Diagram and knocked off the lightning spear, resolving Yu Zihao’s crisis.

The pill cauldron then flew off, floating above Fallen Daynight’s disciple.

“Hahaha, I’ve absorbed quite a bit of your power now! How long can you last?” The just-saved Yu Zihao shouted arrogantly.

Nourished by the thunderforce, his divine statue became even more holy and divine now, and the Brahma Divine Diagram also rapidly healed, looking like it would be fully recovered in just a moment.

“Attack!”

Seeing this scene, the other experts didn’t just sit there. Like madmen, they roared and charged at the Sovereign clan expert.

“Sovereign Dragon Roars at the Heavens!”

The Sovereign clan expert’s brow furrowed menacingly. Abruptly, he lifted his head and unleashed a deafening roar. Being the closest one to him, Long Chen reacted swiftly, summoning his defenses and covering his ears from the deafening roar.
