Chapter 5035 Feng Fei’s Favor

The Zhao clan leader had surrounded Qin Feng and the others to threaten Long Chen, shocking everyone present. The Zhao clan was being far too shameless.

On the martial stage, even facing two opponents, Long Chen remained unbeatable, prompting them to target his subordinate. However, Long Chen seemed to have long since expected the Zhao clan’s actions. He didn’t even look at them.

Long Chen calmly countered, “If you release them, only Zhao Qingtian will die. But if you proceed with this, more Zhao clan members will suffer. Are you sure you want to do this?”

“Cut the crap! Release Zhao Qingtian, or we’ll kill them all!” shouted an expert of the Zhao clan.

Long Chen smiled, casting a glance beyond the martial stage. “Do you see this? These people always act high and above others until death comes for them. After that, they become a pitiful bug just like the one in front of me.”

“Shut up! Let go of Zhao Qingtian, or we’ll really attack!” The Zhao clan experts were visibly agitated to see Zhao Qingtian cough up more blood.

Seeing that Long Chen showed no sign of relenting, someone proposed, “Let’s kill half the mercenaries first and see if he releases Zhao Qingtian then!”

“Attack!” The clan leader clenched his teeth and nodded.

“Fools. You really are going to lose everything.” Qin Feng shook his head. Somewhat regretfully, he said, “It’s just too bad we won’t get to watch any longer.”

“Kill!” The Zhao clan experts immediately attacked.

Suddenly, all the mercenaries shimmered with light. A massive spatial vortex appeared, engulfing millions of mercenaries, along with Qin Feng, Gui Jiu, Long Ziwei, and others, causing them to vanish.

“What?!”

The four divine clans’ experts were all stunned. The four clan leaders’ expressions changed drastically.

“How is this possible?! This place is fully locked down! They can’t have undergone spatial transportation!” roared the Zhao clan leader with fear in his eyes.

Only the clan leaders knew that the Heavenly Desolation Domain was sealed with impenetrable layers of barriers, not even allowing a fly to escape.

However, Qin Feng and the others had bizarrely vanished. While the clan leaders weren’t concerned about their fate, this event signaled something alarming: if Long Chen were to emerge from the martial stage, he too could vanish without a trace at any moment.

All the four clan leaders were terrified by that thought. It was the worst-case scenario they hadn’t anticipated despite all their calculations. Could Long Chen truly possess such a powerful trump card?

BOOM!

An explosive sound reverberated from the martial stage as Zhao Qingtian’s glaive was finally wrenched from his grasp, and he collapsed to the ground. Long Chen slowly raised Evilmoon and ruthlessly drove it through Zhao Qingtian’s back. It not only pierced Zhao Qingtian but also embedded deeply into the martial stage's bricks, pinning him down.

“Qingtian!” The Zhao clan experts cried out. Unlike Ye Lingxiao’s sudden death, which left no room for mourning, Zhao Qingtian still clung to life. Perhaps Long Chen was giving the Zhao clan face by not killing him immediately. With Evilmoon in hand, he lifted Zhao Qingtian from the ground and turned toward the Zhao clan experts.

“Come, say goodbye to your clan members!” suggested Long Chen.

“Long Chen, I’ll tear your corpse to pieces!”

“Long Chen, you murderer! When you come out, I’ll skin you!”

“Long Chen, get out here! I’ll kill you right now!”

The Zhao clan heaven vein experts roared furiously, wanting to charge into the barrier right away.

Zhao Qingtian was on his deathbed. Suddenly, like the final flash of the setting sun, he cried out, “Don’t!”

BOOM!

Evilmoon quivered, and just like that, a generation’s heavenly genius was killed, turned into blood mist.

Of the four peak ancient heavenly geniuses, Long Chen had killed two.

As the ancient and present experts clashed, everyone had borne witness to the huge difference between the heavenly geniuses of old and those of this era. But then, Long Chen had easily slain Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao. Why was there such a difference between Long Chen and the peak heavenly geniuses of ancient times?

The Zhao clan experts wailed and started to curse Long Chen, even cursing his parents and ancestors of eighteen generations.

“If you’re all so eager to join Zhao Qingtian, I will be generous and grant you your wish!”

In front of everyone’s gazes, Long Chen gripped Evilmoon firmly with both hands. The dragon marks on the saber shimmered as he plunged it into the center of the martial stage.

“What is he doing?!” exclaimed the Long clan leader.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a deafening explosion rocked the land, and the entire martial stage shattered into fragments. The protective barriers vanished one by one.

“What?!”

Long Chen indifferently remarked, “This barrier’s design has a major flaw. When it was converted from an altar, you focused only on strengthening the barriers. But you forgot that no matter how robust the barriers are, once the core of the altar is breached, they become meaningless.”

BOOM!

The final barrier exploded. In an instant, Long Chen vanished from the martial stage and reappeared within the Zhao clan’s camp.

“Seven Forms in One!” Long Chen bellowed, sweeping Evilmoon out in a powerful slash. The Zhao clan experts retaliated with full force, but the sheer strength of Long Chen’s saber obliterated everyone, except for the heaven vein experts.

The one-vein Heaven Saints grimaced as they endured Long Chen’s attack. It felt like a hammer to their chests, forcing them to spit out blood. Even the two-vein Heaven Saints found their arms numb from trying to block his attacks. At this moment, they personally experienced Long Chen’s terrifying power.

After his saber slash, Long Chen slammed his left hand forward. One unlucky one-vein Heaven Saint couldn’t dodge in time and took a fatal blow to the head, resulting in an instant death.

Without hesitation, Long Chen lunged forward with Evilmoon, cleaving through another one-vein Heaven Saint who was still recovering from the first attack. Another heaven vein expert fell in seconds.

In the blink of an eye, Long Chen had killed two heaven vein experts. The top experts from the four clans finally mobilized, swiftly surrounding him to contain the deadly threat he posed.

After the barrier shattered, the four clans’ leaders immediately focused on trapping Long Chen, cutting off any escape routes. They hadn’t anticipated that after breaking the barrier, Long Chen would charge straight into the Zhao clan, the side with the most experts.

“Surround him!”

The heaven vein experts shot at Long Chen like bolts of lightning, determined not to let Long Chen escape.

“Long Chen, hand over your life!” A sudden cry broke the tense silence. With astonishing speed, Feng Fei shot toward Long Chen, followed closely by Jiang Wuwang. Together, they aimed to pin him down. The two of them were so fast that they were actually ahead of the others.

Long Chen was momentarily startled, but as he saw their trajectory, he realized that Feng Fei and Jiang Wuwang were creating a diversion, attempting to clear a path for his escape. By blocking the path for others, they gave him an escape path.

With Feng Fei and Jiang Wuwang blocking the way, it became harder for the others to close in completely. Long Chen’s heart warmed at their unexpected assistance. Feng Fei’s help at this critical moment confirmed her loyalty as a true friend.

Long Chen rushed toward Feng Fei. He wasn’t planning on running, but by breaking through the blockade, he would have more room to maneuver and gain better control of the battlefield.

Relieved to see Long Chen approaching, Feng Fei started to step aside when suddenly, she felt a searing pain in her chest. A sword had pierced through her back.

“Long Qihua, what the fuck do you think you’re doing?!” roared Jiang Wuwang, enraged. It was Long Qihua, the Long clan’s top Heaven Saint, who had attacked Feng Fei from behind. His actions were met with Jiang Wuwang’s furious retaliation.

“You traitors, do you think I can’t see what you’re doing? Scram!” Long Qihua sneered, effortlessly flinging Feng Fei aside before attacking Jiang Wuwang.

Jiang Wuwang’s sword shattered. Spitting out blood, he fell alongside Feng Fei.

Everything happened so suddenly that Long Chen couldn’t react. He had never expected Long Qihua to dare to strike Feng Fei.

Long Qihua smiled sinisterly at Long Chen. “Little brat, let’s see how you keep acting arrogant now.”

In a flash, Long Qihua was in front of Long Chen. Jiang Wuwang lay heavily wounded, and Feng Fei’s survival was uncertain. Thinking of this, Long Chen trembled with fury, and a murderous intent surged within him.

Black spots danced in his vision as Long Chen lost control. With a roar of rage, he ignored Long Qihua’s approaching sword and thrust Evilmoon straight at him.

Long Qihua’s sword nearly pierced Long Chen’s chest, but Long Chen neither blocked nor dodged. His apparent suicidal resolve left Long Qihua stunned.

Having taken the upper hand, Long Qihua felt no need to die with Long Chen. With a snort, he spun, avoiding Long Chen’s saber. Just as he was about to counterattack, his waist tightened—he was bound by a bone whip.

Long Qihua was shocked. At some point, a young maiden wielding the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip and wearing the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress had appeared on the battlefield.

“Sovereign Blood Seal - God Slaying Cross!”

As Huo Linger caught Long Qihua, Long Chen roared and slammed his left hand into Long Qihua’s chest.
