Chapter 2472 Core of the Dragon Nest

Long Chen not only heard Zi Yan’s zither, but he also heard the sound of intense fights coming from other regions.

“Ignore them. They are fighting the resentful spirits, while we bypassed them to go to the core of the nest directly,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen suppressed his thought of joining with Zi Yan and continued in the direction that Evilmoon indicated. Within an empty void lay a circular entity that looked like a honeycomb.

According to Evilmoon, that was the core of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Just by getting closer to it, Long Chen felt his own essence blood flowing quicker.

“The dragon blood in your body has formed a resonance with the dragon king’s power. It’s just still unclear whether or not this dragon king was a true dragon,” said Evilmoon.

Upon entering, Long Chen saw that the passageways were made of white bones. Images of dragons were all along the passageway. Those were not carvings. They seemed to be dragon souls embedded in the walls.

The dragons that had died within this nest had their flesh and souls return to it. It was a calling that made the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest grow stronger and stronger.

The dragon might was extremely powerful at the core. That sensation was exceptionally intense to Long Chen who possessed dragon blood. It almost felt like it was going to ignite. If he didn’t suppress it, his Azure Dragon Battle Armor would have automatically activated.

“It seems that the dragon king isn’t welcoming me,” said Long Chen.

“The dragon race is enormous. The true dragon race is the emperor of the dragon race, and they are few in number. However, there is a natural rebellious nature within members of the dragon race. None of them like to be weaker than the others. Your essence blood came from a true dragon who had just matured into an azure dragon. It is like an emperor who is incredibly weak. Even though it is an emperor, it cannot order around a stubborn general. The dragon king here definitely won’t submit to you because you are too weak. Just take things step by step. Once we reach the center, we’ll know what race the dragon king was from,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen nodded and continued. There were countless dragon images on the walls. Their roars resounded through his head. As his blood raged within him, he had an urge to smash apart the dragon nest.

His anger began to rise without him being aware of it. When it reached a certain level, Long Chen suddenly realized that the dragon blood was affecting his emotions.

The end of the passageway appeared, and there were nine giant dragon skeletons. Their mouths were open and pointed toward a giant sphere.

At this moment, Long Chen realized that he was standing within one of the dragon’s eye sockets. So the passageway he had been going through was the body of a dragon.

“So it’s the divine bone spirit dragon race. No wonder the berserk aura isn’t very strong,” said Evilmoon.

“What is the divine bone spirit dragon race? How come I’ve never heard of them?” asked Long Chen.

“The spirit dragon race is another large branch. The divine bone spirit dragon race is the wisest of that branch. They are very smart, but their combat power isn’t exceptional. They have a miraculous ability though, which is to nurture divine bones. The core of this dragon nest must be those four divine bones. If they can be obtained…” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, the dragon bone beneath Long Chen’s feet lit up, causing him to jump. However, it then faded. Startled, he ran out of the eye socket to the top of the dragon head to see a person.

“Hu Feng?” Long Chen hadn’t expected to see Hu Feng.

Hu Feng on the other hand was delighted to see him. “Haha, it seems that my prediction was correct. Brother Long, you really are my fated benefactor.”

“You…” Long Chen suddenly noticed that the giant die always spinning behind Hu Feng’s back was gone. Instead, it was now in his hand, and he seemed to be doing something with it.

“Brother Long, I will speak honestly. My Heavenly Fate Die was damaged, and I have never been able to repair it. I need to find a Heavenly Fate Bone and extract its essence. This Heavenly Fate Bone is something only the divine bone spirit dragon can produce. Of these nine divine bone spirit dragons, only one produced the Heavenly Fate Bone that I require. However, even after using dozens of drops of dragon blood that I managed to gather in preparation, I am unable to commune with it. Brother Long, I know that you have true dragon essence blood within your body. It can definitely form a bridge between the Heavenly Fate Bone and the divine bone. I was hoping I could use the dragon blood I prepared myself to do it so I wouldn’t have to trouble you, but…” Hu Feng was embarrassed to make such a demand.

Hu Feng had his own pride. This was his first time begging someone for help.

“It’s just a bit of essence blood. It won’t harm my core. Brother Hu, if you’re going to act so polite with me, I’ll be embarrassed to call on you in my next battle,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen flicked his finger, causing a drop of essence blood to fly out into the center of the formation diagram beneath Hu Feng’s feet.

The entire dragon skull began to shine, but after a moment, it stopped. Long Chen knew that this meant that his essence blood didn’t have enough energy to awaken it.

Long Chen sent out three more drops. The dragon skull grew increasingly bright. Countless runes began to light up throughout it.

Thirty drops later, Hu Feng was too embarrassed to let it continue. He hadn’t expected it to require so much energy. At this rate, it would really affect Long Chen, which could be fatal in this dangerous place.

Before he could say anything though, Long Chen waved his hand. “You can’t just give up midway. I feel like it’s coming soon.”

After eighteen more drops of his essence blood, the skull shuddered, and a ray of divine light came out of the formation diagram.

The divine light was incomparably sacred. Just looking at it calmed the soul. Hu Feng placed his Heavenly Fate Die within its light. As if immersed in sunlight, it began to slowly spin. A certain radiance came from it as it began to manifest the Heavenly Daos.

“Brother Long, there are no words I could use to thank you for this favor. If you need anything in the future, just tell me.” Hu Feng cupped his fists solemnly.

“I’m glad to hear it. Remember to come cheer us on in the next battle.” Long Chen laughed. Since Hu Feng’s matter had been settled, he didn’t waste any further time. He jumped off the skull and flew toward the sphere at the center.

Upon jumping into the sphere, he found himself in a strange world. This place was a barren desert.

At the heart of the desert was a giant dragon coiled atop an altar.

“It’s dead.” Evilmoon sighed. It was unable to sense any vitality from that dragon.

Long Chen flew over and also didn’t sense any vitality. However, its scales still emitted some divine radiance.

“I don’t think it’s dead yet. Perhaps there’s a chance to save it,” said Long Chen.

“It’s useless. The flame of its dragon core has started to extinguish. We were too late. If it was still alive, then with its intellect, it would have given all its remaining power to us. Now though, we’ll have to think of our own ways to take it. This divine bone spirit dragon has exhausted all its energy defending against the outside world. I’m going to the source down below to extract that energy. I can strengthen myself and also see if I can break free of Yun Shang’s seal. Then I would be able to unleash my power without the limitations of your cultivation base. There are four primordial divine bones on the four corners of the altar. They are the foundational sources of the world: earth, water, fire, wind. They are also the core of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Those are priceless treasures. For a human to become a Sovereign, they must have a Spirit Root, Spirit Blood, and Spirit Bone that reaches the necessary level. These four divine bones are the strongest divine treasures for condensing a Spirit Bone. Now you should understand just how important they are,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Every human could be said to possess a Spirit Root and Spirit Blood. It was simply the quality that varied from person to person. It could be made up for with various resources, but he had never heard of a treasure capable of giving a Spirit Bone to someone without one.

However, Evilmoon was saying that these four primordial divine bones could allow a person to produce a Spirit Bone. That meant that they were truly heaven-defying treasures.

“It’s unfortunate that the dragon king is dead. The divine bones and blood pool are protected by their own laws. I’m not exactly sure how to take them either. Time is pressing, so I’m going to the source. The dragon source is already starting to wither with the dragon king’s death. If it’s not taken now, it’s going to fade away.”

Evilmoon transformed into a streak of black light that pierced into the ground, vanishing. Long Chen didn’t know what it was using to absorb that dragon source.

Long Chen flew onto the altar. He saw four platforms on the four corners, each with a fist-sized bone on top of it.

Those bones were like jade and shone with divine light. It was possible to see a rune within the bones.

“That rune…”

Upon spotting one of those runes, Long Chen’s heart trembled. He recognized it. It was the flame rune he had obtained in the Immemorial Path. Using it as the core, he had created the World Annihilation Flame Lotus.

Although the creation of the flame lotus technique had been a success, Long Chen had never managed to fully investigate the secrets of the rune. Based on what he knew though, it was one of the building blocks of this world, the most primordial rune of the four kinds of energy that supposedly first appeared in the world.

Long Chen slowly got closer. Suddenly, light blazed from the platform, and a dragon roar rang out. Long Chen felt a wave of power knock him back.

Long Chen was blown into the distance. When he looked again, he saw that the four platforms were blazing with divine light at the same time.

“So the four platforms are linked.” Long Chen was startled, and his expression became grave. Xia Chen had told him that such a formation needed to be approached and breached from all four directions at the same time. Without some special technique, he wouldn’t be able to do anything by himself.
