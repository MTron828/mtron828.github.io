Chapter 2808 Unable to Endure Any Longer

Long Chen followed the path, and it took a long time of walking before he finally reached the registration area. However, when he arrived, two disciples in white robes with a pill furnace’s mark on their sleeves were impatiently glaring at him.

“Why are you so slow? Do you realize that you’re over two hours late? Do you not know how to follow any rules?”

A wave of obscure anger instantly rose within Long Chen. He coldly said, “No one told me the time, so how can I be late?”

“You dare to argue?!” The disciple was infuriated.

“Try to pressure me any further and I won’t just argue. I’ll slap that mouth off. If you don’t believe me, you can try it.” Long Chen’s expression sank. What damn academy was this? Was it an academy for idiots? If this was the Martial Heaven Continent, he’d have long since slapped this person to death.

Ever since he entered this academy, he had encountered countless nonsensical blockades. Long Chen didn’t feel like he had provoked anyone, yet there were always people throwing themselves at him to get in his way. Could it be that he was doomed to be a magnet for trouble in the immortal world as well?

“Courting death!” The two disciples were immediately infuriated. It had to be known that any newcomers who came here were all proper and respectful. What newcomer dared to speak to them so fearlessly?

“What is causing so much noise?!” A stern voice suddenly came from the room behind them.

“Brat, just wait. I’ll put you in your place later. Take this and scram to your class,” said that disciple fiercely, tossing Long Chen a tile.

Long Chen received the tile and sneered, “I’m not a good person. If you’re not in a rush to reincarnate, don’t provoke me.”

As Long Chen walked into the classroom, those two disciples were left with dark expressions. They had never encountered such an arrogant newcomer. On the other hand, Long Chen’s expression was also not very good. Perhaps he had been too much of a hegemon in the Martial Heaven Continent for too long, and by the end, no one on the continent dared to speak to him like this. Hence, he had a feeling like he had suddenly fallen from a dragon to a dog.

There was a stone door covered in runes up ahead. When Long Chen stood in front of it, the tile quivered slightly, and the door slowly opened.

He arrived inside a classroom. There were tables with thousands of young disciples sitting at them. When Long Chen arrived, everyone’s gazes fell on him.

Of course, that included the teacher who was seated on top of a platform. The elder was slim and stiff, with very thin lips that curved upward at the corners of his mouth.

The elder was the teacher in charge of the newcomers. Although these newcomers had passed the initial exam, they were still not counted as outer disciples of the Pill Institute. They had to go through some further examinations and observations. If their results were satisfactory, they would become outer disciples.

“You are Long Chen?”

The elder looked at Long Chen and took out something. He was looking at Long Chen as if verifying something.

“I am.” Long Chen nodded.

“Behave yourself. It’s a yes or no question,” barked the elder.

Long Chen almost passed out from anger. Did the immortal world’s people have something wrong with their heads? It was just an extra word. Or was this elder intentionally causing trouble for him?

“The people from the lower world are all unbearably arrogant while being weak. They’re the worst to oversee, but since this is the High Firmament Academy, and the Pill Institute is the most special institute within the academy, it would be best if all of you were more clever. I don’t care if you’re from the immortal world or an ascender. Now that you’re here, all the luck of your lifetime has been used up. Behave yourself and don’t ruin your future prospects.” The elder finally retracted his gaze from Long Chen and swept his gaze over everyone, clearly using Long Chen as a teaching tool, an example of what not to do.

Flames of rage burned in Long Chen’s heart. Could it be that his bad luck was going to continue to plague him in the immortal world as well? Why was it that he always encountered fools? Was this a case of idiots being able to reproduce limitlessly?

“This class has been waiting two hours for you. Apologize to everyone!” demanded the elder.

“Are you sure your head isn’t full of shit? Why is it that the only thing that comes out of your mouth is crap?” Long Chen stared at the elder with an inconceivable expression.

The other disciples in the room gasped, staring in horror at him. How could he say such a thing? Did he not care about his future?

“You…!” The elder furiously leaped up.

“What you? If you use your finger to point at me, I’ll break that dog paw of yours. Did your parents not teach you that it’s rude to point at others? When I was sent here, not one person told me there was an arranged time. Since no one told me there was a set time, how can I be late? What does you waiting two hours have to do with me? You grew up looking like a dog, and now your mouth spouts dog shit,” cursed Long Chen.

His endurance reached its limit. He would rather not join the High Firmament Academy if he had to suffer this bullshit. If this continued, let alone cultivating, he would probably directly die of rage. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You… you… you’re stripped of your qualifications! Get out of here!” shouted the elder.

“Stripped of my qualifications? You were the ones who called me here. Now you think you can tell me to leave as well? What, do you think I’m a dancing monkey for you? If you want me to leave, then fine. Give me a proper explanation,” sneered Long Chen.

“A reason?! You arrived late, disturbed the class, and insulted the teacher! Any of these reasons are enough!” shouted the elder.

“Idiot. No one told me the time, so saying I’m late doesn’t hold water. Disturbing the class? You are the one shouting and spouting crap. I’m just arguing for what is right. As for insulting the teacher? Do I have to accept being insulted by you just because you’re the teacher? You were the one who caused the trouble for no reason, blaming me, and then telling me to apologize for this. I’m not late, so why should I apologize? You were the one who insulted me first, so why can’t I fight back? If that truly is the logic of the High Firmament Academy, then have the higher-ups come out and admit that these are the rules. I’ll immediately leave if that’s the case. Decision-makers of the High Firmament Academy, come out and let’s have a debate!” Long Chen’s final sentence was a roar containing his fury and terrifying killing intent. It shook people’s ears and was transmitted far and wide.

Although this place was the immortal world and his voice couldn’t go too far, it was still frightening. Those two disciples outside the classroom who were thinking of how to put Long Chen in his place later almost jumped out of their skin.

“This person was notified a bit late and was not told a time. He cannot be said to be late. Let the class continue.” A voice suddenly rang out in everyone’s ears. The elder’s expression immediately changed.
