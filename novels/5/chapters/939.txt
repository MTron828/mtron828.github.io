Chapter 940 The Plan for Vengeance

Translator: BornToBe

Looking at the crippled, half-dead half-step King, Ouyang Qiuyu didn’t know what to say for a long time.

Outside this stronghold, Ouyang Qiuyu had captured a late Foundation Forging expert alive. That was to give an explanation to the head sect and the Eastern Wasteland’s Righteous path.

But now, Long Chen had caught a half-step King alive. That was a shocking achievement, one that would most likely cause the Xuantian Dao Sect’s prestige to rise to an unprecedented level.

“Not only can it be exchanged for quite a bit of things, but it’ll also allow our Eastern Wasteland’s branch sect to vent a bit in front of the head sect,” said Ouyang Qiuyu gratefully.

The bone tower was also put away by Ouyang Qiuyu. Although it was essentially broken, it was a sign of their battle spoils. It was a valuable memento.

At this moment, the Dragonblood warriors had also arrived beside Long Chen. They were incredibly excited, their blood still boiling from the fight. From their expressions, it seemed that they longed to continue fighting.

Ouyang Qiuyu and the other Sea Expansion elders were also excitedly examining the bloodsoaked Dragonblood warriors. They were unable to stay calm.

Over three hundred rank three Celestials, each of them with limitless potential. Although they had only just advanced to Sea Expansion and couldn’t even count as having reached the early stage, they were already capable of dominating the Sea Expansion realm.

Then once they grew, just how terrifying would this group become? Furthermore, there were also people like Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, and the others who were rank four Celestials and capable of killing Foundation Forging experts.

As for Wilde, although they couldn’t tell his cultivation base and they knew he wasn’t a Celestial, his power was still at the peak of everyone. It was just that right now, Wilde was on the ground, crazily devouring food.

Moreover, this terrifying group was led by a supreme monster, Long Chen. Even Ouyang Qiuyu’s heart pounded.

The current Dragonblood Legion had finally revealed their brilliance. It was clear that Long Chen had definitely encountered some kind of miracle within the Immemorial Path to create such an unrivaled army.

“Let’s leave.” Ouyang Qiuyu brought everyone back to the spatial portal. Forming a hand seal, the Heaven Catching Drum boomed. People felt like their bodies were being stretched taut.

“Ah, so sect master, you were long since prepared from the start!” Guo Ran was amazed. He had just been wondering about how they were supposed to leave this sealed world.

“Do you think I’m like you lot and never think of the consequences? Since I dared to come in, I naturally can leave whenever I want,” said Ouyang Qiuyu, rolling her eyes. Why did it seem like these brats were looking down on her?

The Heaven Catching Drum released countless runes that wrapped around everyone. They felt space twisting, and they found themselves on the battlefield where they had entered.

“They’ve come out! Sect master, monastery heads, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you’ve all come out alive!”

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples and Elders all cheered. Some even wept tears of joy. Before they had left, they had all been prepared for them to be annihilated. They had thought they would never see these people again.

But now they saw that they weren’t even one number less than when they had entered. However, they were all soaked in blood, so they had definitely undergone an intense battle. Everyone cheered.

The Sea Expansion elders couldn’t help but feel ashamed. Yes, they were covered in blood, but it wasn’t their enemies’ blood. It was their own blood. Despite the Redeye Sacred Blood Phoenix’s protection, they had still been injured by the final attack.

Several of them were monastery heads, and their disciples flocked toward them, cheering. In their hearts, their monastery heads were true heroes.

“Everyone, thank you all for your support. The Xuantian Dao Sect will remember this favor forever,” said Ouyang Qiuyu solemnly to the various sect leaders that had come to assist them.

Originally, the Xuantian Dao Sect had dozens of smaller powers under them. But once the Xuantian Dao Sect had been attacked and Ouyang Qiuyu had tried to gather them, they had evaded every which way, refusing to help.

Only seven sects had come to their aid. Although they were mostly useless, they had still gone all-out to assist them. Only at this time was it possible to see who was a real friend.

One of those sect leaders shook his head. “Even hundreds of years ago, our Pure Wind Gate was under the Xuantian Dao Sect’s protection. The favor you have given is impossible for us to repay.”

“That’s right. When the Remote Heaven Gang was suppressing us and trying to devour us, it was the Xuantian Dao Sect that helped us survive. For us to come here is something we simply had to do.”

“Hmph, there are some idiots that forget other people’s kindness. If it hadn’t been for the Xuantian Dao Sect, they would have long since been devoured by others,” said another sect leader.

Before coming, they had alerted the other sects like them. But those other sects had refused to come, instead telling them not to send themselves to their deaths, saying something about how the Xuantian Dao Sect was heavily injured and how it would definitely decline. And that they had to stand independent now to avoid being dragged down with them.

At the same time as they had received the request for aid, they had received a threat from the Remote Heaven Gang. Although they hadn’t said anything explicitly, it was clear that the Remote Heaven Gang wanted to dominate the Eastern Wasteland on their own. Helping the Xuantian Dao Sect was becoming enemies with the Remote Heaven Gang.

“Fuck, I even suspect that the Corrupt path’s sneak attack was instigated by the Remote Heaven Gang. The timing is too coincidental. Tch, what are you coughing about, you also know this. So what if there isn’t proof. There’s a ninety percent chance this matter is related to the Remote Heaven Gang,” cursed one of the smaller sect leaders.

He was correct. The sneak attack had been too sudden and fierce. And the timing was extremely coincidental.

If Ouyang Qiuyu had returned according to her original plans, then by the time she would have returned, the Xuantian Dao Sect would have been destroyed. But perhaps it was that the Xuantian Dao Sect’s karmic luck hadn’t run out yet; she had returned just in time to save the sect from destruction.

Furthermore, on the Corrupt path’s way to the Xuantian Dao Sect, there were many smaller sects. But they hadn’t been implicated at all. Their targets had clearly been the Xuantian Dao Sect and their supermonasteries.

However, if you wanted to say something, you had to have proof. That was why someone else had coughed to remind him that he shouldn’t say such things. But that person didn’t care.

“Whether or not they colluded has no relevance for us.” Ouyang Qiuyu shook her head.

The Remote Heaven Gang was an enormous power, and they had many subordinate powers. As for the Xuantian Dao Sect, they were heavily injured. The Remote Heaven Gang would definitely take advantage of this time to make threats and promises to neutral powers to bring them to their side.

Traitors had appeared even amongst the sects following the Xuantian Dao Sect. It was all too easy for them to bring over more powers that had originally been neutral in their conflict.

“Sect master, I’m planning on leaving the Xuantian Dao Sect with my brothers,” said Long Chen suddenly.

“What?!” Ouyang Qiuyu couldn’t believe her ears. Everyone else was also startled, including the Dragonblood Legion. Only Meng Qi, Guo Ran, and the others were calm. They had long since guessed this result.

“Although it’s a bit sudden, I hope you can accept disciple’s resignation,” said Long Chen.

“Give me a reason.” Ouyang Qiuyu’s expression was gloomy. Her eyes were misty. She couldn’t figure out why Long Chen would be this merciless. Or was it that he looked down on the Xuantian Dao Sect?

“Many things happened in the Immemorial Path this time. I’ve gradually begun to understand a certain principle: the struggles of the martial path are simply cruel. Previously, I had many misgivings because of the people by my side. I endured things and restrained myself. But all I got in return was unending schemes and attempts to take my life. So this time, I’ve decided not to restrain myself. I want to completely expose my fangs. I will no longer have any misgivings about my opponents’ statuses, their backgrounds, or their power. To cultivate is to put one’s life on the line. Once a person loses that courage, the people by their side will disappear one by one. So this time, I’m planning on putting my life on the line along with all my brothers.”

Long Chen looked at the Dragonblood warriors. He solemnly said, “All of them are my hot-blooded brothers. Our hearts are connected, and if I put my life on the line, I know all of them will do the same without hesitation. But I don’t want to implicate you and the Xuantian Dao Sect.”

Ouyang Qiuyu raged, “What nonsense are you talking about? Implicating us? You are my disciple, and we are one family. Don’t you feel like your words are very heartless? Furthermore, everything’s already over. We’ve exterminated one of the Corrupt path’s two forces. They temporarily won’t be able to counterattack. What are you so worried about?”

A bitter smile appeared on Long Chen’s face. “Sect master, you’re thinking too simply. This attack against the Corrupt path was just the first step of my plan for vengeance.”

“Just the first step?”

Everyone was startled. Crippling and killing two half-step Kings and dozens of Foundation Forging experts, as well as hundreds of thousands of elite disciples, was just a start?

“I don’t care what your reason is. My Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples are not permitted to leave whenever they want.” Ouyang Qiuyu grabbed Long Chen’s arm. “Furthermore, you promised me that if someone bullied me, you’d protect me. Could it be you’ve grown up and your words no longer count?”

Long Chen’s heart warmed slightly. But he guiltily said, “I also don’t want to leave the Xuantian Dao Sect. After all, the Xuantian Dao Sect is my home. However, if I don’t leave, it will likely cause the entire Xuantian Dao Sect to be destroyed...”

“If it’s destroyed, then it’s destroyed. Since we dared to go all-out with you once, we’ll dare to do it again. Long Chen, you are not allowed to leave the Xuantian Dao Sect! You are the pride of the Xuantian Dao Sect, and our moral pillar!” begged one of the monastery heads.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, don’t leave. We’re willing to follow you into life or death.” What startled Long Chen was that unfamiliar faces began to passionately shout one by one, their voices ringing throughout the sky.

“Do you see? You’re the one who brought the Xuantian Dao Sect’s conviction onto the right path. You can’t leave.” Ouyang Qiuyu smiled at the passionate Xuantian Dao Sect disciples.

Long Chen’s expression was complicated. Seeing these passionate disciples looking at him with worship, his heart was torn.

“Long Chen, you don’t need to have misgivings about us. We will forever stand by your side. Let’s go back to the sect.” Afraid that Long Chen would back out, Ouyang Qiuyu struck while the iron was hot. She directly pulled Long Chen in the direction of the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Long Chen was helpless. If he left the Xuantian Dao Sect at this time, he would hurt too many people. He once more became a bit lost.

Their grand army returned to the Xuantian Dao Sect. When they arrived, seeing the packed people within the sect, Ouyang Qiuyu’s expression changed.

“Ouyang Qiuyu, hand over Long Chen, or we’ll raze the Xuantian Dao Sect to the ground!” A furious roar rang out from within the Xuantian Dao Sect.
