Chapter 3390 Returning to the Immortal World

“Big brother…”

Long Chen looked at Wu Tian reluctantly. They had just met. But after drinking once, they were about to part ways.

Wu Tian was truly just like his big brother, looking after him in every way. Other than the five Sovereigns, no one had ever given Long Chen such a feeling.

“Big brother also wants you to stay a bit longer, but time does not permit it. The arrow has been shot. There is no stopping it. I have already chosen this path, and I must fight to the end against this hateful world. I will either flip the heavens, or be turned to dust. You are the same. Once you return to the immortal world, you must do your best to get stronger as fast as possible. This world is about to change. The peace of the nine heavens and ten lands will not continue for much longer. A terrifying storm is about to sweep over us, and it might be even more terrifying than that battle trillions of years ago. The three worlds, six Daos, nine heavens, ten lands…they will all be affected. Hahaha, it’s exciting, isn’t it? Work hard. I look forward to joining hands with you in that chaotic flow of worlds. We will completely topple the ten planar worlds.” Wu Tian grew excited toward the end. His blood rumbled within his body, and battle intent soared out of him. It was as if he lived for battle.

Affected by him, Long Chen also didn’t show any fear. Just like Wu Tian, his own blood heated up. Even the reluctance to part was pushed aside by that desire to fight.

BOOM!

Wu Tian stabbed his spear through the air. As a result, fragments of spacetime were blown apart, and the dome of the heavens was pierced. A channel then appeared.

Long Chen could sense the aura of the immortal world on the other side of the channel. With a single spear strike, Wu Tian opened a path for Long Chen to go back to the immortal world.

“Go, brother. This place is actually separated by many chaotic flows of space from the immortal world. This channel will only last for a few breaths’ time,” said Wu Tian.

Long Chen nodded. “Take care, brother. When we meet again, let us topple this unjust world.”

Long Chen dove into the channel. There was a powerful suction force that directly brought him all the way to the end of the path.

He was already back in the immortal world. He could sense the aura of the immortal world around him.

Suddenly, he turned back to the channel and shouted, “Big brother, don’t forget to tell my two wives that I’m safe and sound!”

The channel closed. Long Chen didn’t know if Wu Tian heard him or not. Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue must have been worried about him.

However, thinking about it, Wu Tian would definitely send word to them. His worry was superfluous.

Long Chen found himself on a mountain. There were countless birds and beasts around, but they were fleeing in every direction, clearly scared away by Wu Tian’s attack.

After they fled, the world became calm. Long Chen then sat on a boulder, feeling stunned. After returning to the immortal world, he actually felt disappointed.

He didn’t want to leave Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue. He also didn’t want to leave the new brother he had just met. It felt like everything had just been a dream, and it was both sweet and bitter. He felt like he was too small. Within the raging currents of the Heavenly Daos, all his efforts were unable to cause even the slightest ripple.

Furthermore, Wu Tian’s final words stayed with Long Chen. It seemed that after reaching his current realm, Wu Tian’s senses were sharper. He could see further.

Perhaps it was precisely because he could see it coming that he described the oncoming storm as terrifying.

Furthermore, he said that the three worlds, six Daos, nine heavens, and ten lands would be affected. He said that he had chosen a path of no return. But what about Long Chen?

Just as Wu Tian said, once an arrow had been shot, it couldn’t be called back. Long Chen had chosen his path, so he had to walk it to the end.

Wu Tian didn’t have Long Chen follow him. Instead, he treated Long Chen as a true brother. As he still had it very dangerous in the Netherworld, he didn’t want Long Chen to be involved in his business. Moreover, he had never thought about taking Long Chen in as one of his subordinates. Ming Cangyue’s worries had been for nothing.

Wu Tian didn’t have any ulterior motives when it came to Long Chen. Originally, he just wanted to return the favor, but after finding that their characters were similar, they became brothers. He never thought about profiting from Long Chen. He only wanted to look after him and hoped that he would grow up faster.

This time, Long Chen had fallen for Enpuda’s trap. Fortunately, Mo Nian had appeared on time and broken the channel, allowing him to escape into the chaotic flow of space. Actually, falling into the Netherworld could be said to be a blessing in disguise.

Now, he had thirteen mature Heaven tier Heavenly Dao Fruit and ninety-nine mature Earth tier Heavenly Dao Fruit. These things were priceless treasures. So many Heaven tier Nether Kings had been slain in the Netherworld, producing some Heaven tier Heavenly Dao Fruit.

These thirteen Heaven tier Heavenly Dao Fruit were ready for the Dragonblood warriors. However, it would be best if these things didn’t see the light of day. They couldn’t be traded for money.

After seeing Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, Long Chen knew that the two no longer needed his help, and Wu Tian could also secretly look after them. So, Long Chen didn’t need to worry about them.

He had also obtained that supremely terrifying dagger, a powerful life-protecting talisman. Moreover, his cultivation base had even reached the great circle.

“Eh? My cultivation base…”

Suddenly, Long Chen noticed that his cultivation base had fallen a bit. Originally, he had reached the point of breaking through at any moment.

However, now that he was in the immortal world, his realm had fallen from the great circle to the late twelfth Heavenstage. It was rather curious.

Could it be the result of the laws between the two worlds being different? Long Chen couldn’t figure it out. But he had only fallen a little bit. It wasn’t much of a problem. He could reach the peak again in just ten days.

Long Chen’s mind then sank into the primal chaos space. The black soil had devoured a huge number of corpses, unleashing a sea of life energy. Because of it, the Wood Foundation Divine Tree’s fourth generation fruit had matured. Furthermore, the trees themselves had once more grown in size.

Just as Zheng Wenlong said, with every generation of fruit they bore, they would grow in power. Thus, every succeeding generation of fruit was more valuable than the last.

Not only that, but the Devil Eye Water Lilies had even reached the third tier. Long Chen then chose to replant their seeds.

Long Chen found that just a tenth of the corpses could make them reach maturity. If that was the case, he should be able to grow more than six hundred Devil Eye Water Lilies.

It was unknown just how much the life energy contained within the Wood Foundation Divine Trees had increased. Long Chen estimated that even after advancing to the Divine Lord realm, he wouldn’t need to worry about running out of life energy.

His mind then retreated from the primal chaos space. Looking at a distant mountain, Long Chen had the urge to raise his head and roar. Once he became a Divine Lord, he would truly be a fish swimming through the sea, a bird flying through the heavens.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hey, naked little fellow, what are you doing? Don’t you know what shame is?” Just as Long Chen took the posture to release the emotions in his heart, he heard a disdainful voice from behind him.
