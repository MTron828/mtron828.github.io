Chapter 2363 Feng Fei

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen was enraged. Was there no end to this nonsense? Did the divine families have nothing better to do?

Long Chen grabbed the whip with his hand. It was made of metal and covered in tiny barbs. If it did strike someone, it would tear off a layer of flesh.

“A person who can make me kneel and get out of their way has yet to be born in this world,” sneered Long Chen. He pulled, causing the master of the whip to come flying out.

It was a man wearing white robes. He looked young but was already at the third step of Netherpassage.

The white-robed man hadn’t expected the black-robed man in their way to be so brazen as to actually attack. “Courting death!” As he was pulled in, he unleashed a kick at Long Chen’s face. His previous attack with the whip was not a killing blow, but this kick clearly showed that he didn’t care if Long Chen lived or died.

“Long Chen, don’t! He-!” shouted the warrior of the Heavenly Dragon Legion accompanying him. He had a knee on the ground just like everyone else.

Long Chen didn’t wait for him to finish talking. His left foot was an axis as his right foot whipped through the air at that person’s jaw. Despite moving second, his attack landed first.

The white-robed man was startled and hastily blocked with his hand. As a result, he was sent flying.

However, the surprising thing to Long Chen was that he was so powerful that his arm wasn’t broken as Long Chen had expected.

The whip left the white-robed man’s hand, and Long Chen actually swung it at him while holding the tip. His expression didn’t change, but the power of his astral spaces began to circulate into the whip.

The white-robed man felt a mix of shock and anger. Long Chen was attacking his face just like how he had aimed for Long Chen’s face at the start. This was clearly intentional.

His expression sank, and he grabbed his weapon. Having his weapon taken was a humiliation.

However, when he grabbed the handle of his whip, he felt some energy explode within it. His arm trembled. His sleeve exploded, while his palm became bloody, with several of his fingers broken.

They were identical attacks, but Long Chen had received his attack so easily.

“Brazen interloper, you must want to die!” The white-robed man’s manifestation suddenly appeared behind him, and a powerful pressure cascaded down. That pressure was even greater than what the seventh commander of the Heavenly Dragon Legion could unleash.

That startled Long Chen inside. This person looked so young, but his cultivation base and combat power were so powerful.

“You’re the one courting death. If you still don’t appreciate my kindness, I don’t mind helping you achieve your dream of dying.” Long Chen tossed the whip to the side and clasped his hands behind his back. He stared coldly at the white-robed man. As long as the latter dared to attack, Long Chen would kill him.

That gaze made the white-robed man’s heart shiver. His intuition was telling him that he was in danger. However, in the end, his whip lit up and attacked once more.

Long Chen smiled coldly. The divine families were truly powerful. Even such a powerful third step Netherpassage expert could be sacrificed for him to play with.

“Hold it!”

Just as Long Chen was about to take Evilmoon out, an icy woman’s voice rang out, and that made the white-robed man instantly halt.

The voice was as beautiful as birdsong, but it also contained an icy arrogance of someone far above others.

“Senior, this person was so arrogant and ignorant as to block your great carriage. Please permit me to execute him as a warning to others.” The white-robed man turned and bowed toward the distance.

At this moment, Long Chen saw a golden chariot appear behind the white-robed man. It looked incredibly luxurious. The curtains were drawn, so he couldn’t see who was inside. But there were hundreds of experts around it like attendants, and he saw three other white-robed men, most likely on the same level as the one he was fighting.

“Senior Feng Fei, please. Long Chen is from the Martial Heaven Continent and is unfamiliar with the customs of the divine families…” said the Heavenly Dragon Legion warrior.

“You are Long Chen?” The woman inside the carriage ignored the warrior, directly asking Long Chen.

“Why ask a question when you already know the answer?” Long Chen frowned. Just what was wrong with the people of the divine families? Was there a point in asking such a question?

“Impudence! When senior Feng Fei asks you a question, you better answer properly!” shouted one of the white-robed men standing beside the carriage.

“Don’t shout at me. My temper’s not very good. Even a dog should learn how to judge others, or once they’re turned into stew, not even their master will be able to save them, understood?” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen was most irritated with dogs like this who shouted from the side before their masters could even say anything. It gave him an urge to slap them all to death.

“You…!”

Everyone’s expressions changed. The attendants of the carriage were all filled with killing intent. As long as the woman gave the order, they would pounce and tear him to pieces.

“Just as the rumors say, you really are a dung-covered rock, irritating and hard. Since this is your first time in the divine families and you don’t know the rules, I won’t quibble with you. Let’s go. I have more important matters.”

The white-robed man glared at Long Chen, indicating to him to just wait, before returning to his procession and leaving.

When the carriage passed by Long Chen, through the window’s light muslin, he saw a faint figure. He just saw an outline, but it still gave off a feeling of immense beauty.

That entire procession entered the transportation formation. The fluctuations of the transportation were particularly intense. From how intense they were, it seemed that they weren’t going to the Martial Heaven Continent.

The procession vanished to an unknown location. Only once they were gone did the surrounding experts stand.

The Heavenly Dragon warrior was covered in sweat. That had clearly given him a bad fright.

“It’s my life, and I wasn’t afraid. So what were you so afraid of?” asked Long Chen.

The warrior bitterly smiled. “You don’t know, but senior Feng Fei is an extremely terrifying existence. If you give her a bad impression, don’t expect to have a good time in the divine families. Let’s go see Elder Long.”

The two of them left. Only when there was no one else around did he whisper, “Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, are you aware that people are split into four ranks amongst the divine families?”

“What four ranks?”

“The first rank is the main bloodlines. The second is the collateral relatives, the third is the branch families, and the fourth are those outer branches hidden within the Martial Heaven Continent. Although we Heavenly Dragon warriors might look mighty to the outside world, in truth, we’re only from the third rank,” sighed the Heavenly Dragon warrior. “Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you cannot tell anyone that I told you this.”

“Don’t worry, I’m not so talkative. So people like you are only of the third rank? I don’t understand, why do the divine families have to split people up like this? Is that really something good?” asked Long Chen.

Long Chen truly didn’t quite understand. Weren’t such classifications only going to breed resentment and conflict?

“For third rankers like us, we are from the branch relatives and have impure bloodlines. As for the outer branches, they aren’t even related. They just have the name. The second rankers have purer bloodlines, but it is the main bloodlines that are the purest. And the people you just encountered were from there. Those experts all have the power of commanders. As for the one inside the carriage, that was Feng Fei. She is exceptional even amongst the main bloodlines. They are going hunting within the forbidden region of the Ancient Battlefield, and only experts on Feng Fei’s level are qualified to go there. Anyone else would just be sending themselves to their deaths.”

Even the Heavenly Dragon warrior had an expression of worship when he spoke about Feng Fei. Long Chen had an urge to ask what she looked like, but he swallowed that back down. Asking that wasn’t important.

The two of them walked for an incense stick’s worth of time before arriving at another transportation formation, one that was even larger and had four gates to the north, east, west and south. The Heavenly Dragon warrior led him through the south gate.

“The divine families are composed of four powers, while we of the eighth legion belong to the Long family. As for the Ye family, I don’t need to explain much. The two families are constantly fighting. As for the other two, it’s not for me to say. You can discuss it with Elder Long,” said the Heavenly Dragon warrior.

Long Chen nodded to express his thanks. It seemed that this person was one of Shen Chengfeng’s trusted aides, or he wouldn’t have exposed so much about the divine families to him.

Space twisted, and they appeared in a new place once more. This time, Long Chen saw a familiar face.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, we meet again.” It was the eighth commander, Shen Chengfeng. He appeared worn out, but he smiled when he saw Long Chen.

“Come, Elder Long had me wait for you.” Shen Chengfeng took the place of the Heavenly Dragon warrior, bringing Long Chen away on a flying boat deep within a mountain range.
