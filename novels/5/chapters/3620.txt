Chapter 3609

The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s plaza was packed with tens of thousands of experts wearing different robes. The higher-ups of the college had also come, so the plaza contained almost all the leaders of the entire Alldevil Star-Field’s human race within it.

Xue Yifan was also present. Within this giant plaza, everyone else was standing, and only Xue Yifan and eight other elders were seated.

Tens of thousands of late stage World Kings were silently standing there, all of them with dark expressions. Not one person was smiling, so the atmosphere was a bit heavy.

When Long Chen, Guo Ran, and the others arrived, those experts’ sharp gazes pierced toward them. Those gazes were cold, arrogant, and mocking. To sum it up, they weren’t very friendly.

Guo Ran couldn’t help getting nervous when he saw so many gazes. He was originally shoulder to shoulder with Long Chen, but he subconsciously lagged behind one step. When he was behind Long Chen, he felt much steadier and the pressure was relieved.

As for Long Chen himself, he didn’t show the slightest reaction to the gazes of tens of thousands of experts. He had fought on the battlefield his entire life. Having seen and experienced so many things, he thought that this was just a small lineup.

Furthermore, just from their gazes, Long Chen could easily deduce their motive in coming.

“Dean Long Chen, dean Guo Ran, congratulations on your absolute victory. You have finally won a battle for our human race.” Xue Yifan stood when Long Chen and Guo Ran arrived. He laughed and cupped his fists at them.

Seeing this amicable greeting from Xue Yifan, Long Chen instantly had absolute confidence. This old dean still had absolute control despite not doing anything himself. He was leaving this performance to him and Guo Ran.

“Dean, you are too courteous. It was nothing more than a minor victory, not worth mentioning. However, some shameless allies did open my eyes to the world. Who knew that people were so shameless nowadays?”

Long Chen smiled and replied to Xue Yifan before acting like he was seeing the huge crowd for the first time. “Oh, things are pretty lively today. What’s going on? Why would so many people come to our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College? Is there an important matter to discuss?”

“Yes, there is. I heard that you were so bold as to say that the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was going to lead this war. This old man truly wishes to know where you got such courage to say such big words,” said a sharp-faced elder sitting together with Xue Yifan.

“Dean Long Chen, dean Guo Ran, come take a seat for now. Let us sit and talk.” Xue Yifan smiled and had people bring over two more chairs. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“How are they qualified to sit alongside us?! They are nothing more than two brats. The breast milk smell has yet to fade away from them. Xue Yifan, have you grown muddled with old age?” One of the elders who had had his eyes closed in quiet meditation darkly spoke.

Before this, Guo Ran would definitely be enraged. But now he didn’t feel much from that. In any case, his boss was here.

“What hole did this tortoise crawl out of? Who do you think you are? Have you grown tired of living? Do you want to use me to send you on your way?” asked Long Chen disdainfully.

“Brat, you are courting death!” The elder’s eyes flew open, and a sharp killing intent locked onto Long Chen.

“Dean Long Chen, let me introduce you. This is the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, a mighty half-step Divine Venerate. You two will need to get acquainted,” smiled the dean.

A half-step Divine Venerate. That was definitely an existence on the same level as the dean. Long Chen had previously guessed that the dean was a Divine Venerate, but because his aura felt a bit weak, Long Chen didn’t dare to be sure.

Long Chen had only truly met two Divine Venerates, Dongfang Zichu and Xia Guhong. He remembered Dongfang Zichu’s aura. It was vast like a sea and made people feel reverence. He was an existence that they could only look up to.

As for Xia Guhong, his aura was reserved, making it difficult for him to sense. Long Chen knew that Xia Guhong was very terrifying because Xia Guhong’s mental will was incomparably strong.

Of all the experts that Long Chen had encountered, the strongest should be Wu Tian. His aura was as unfathomable as a cosmos. Long Chen didn’t know what realm that was, perhaps it was the late stage Divine Venerate realm, or perhaps it was even higher.

After encountering Xue Yifan, Long Chen also sensed the aura of a Divine Venerate on him, but the pressure was clearly lacking. Let alone comparing it to Xia Guhong or Dongfang Zichu, it was lacking even compared to the Bloodkill Hall’s Enpuda and the Nine Underworld Hall’s Liao Bencang.

However, Long Chen knew that the Alldevil Star-Field’s experts pursued forging techniques, causing their actual power to be weaker. Thus, Long Chen’s estimate was that the dean might be a Divine Venerate.

But now, he knew that the Alldevil Star-Field’s human race didn’t have a Divine Venerate. It was only because there weren’t any Divine Venerates that these half-step bastards were qualified to be so arrogant.

“So this is the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch. I’ve long since looked forward to…” Long Chen laughed and walked toward the elder. “To tell you to fuck off.”

Just as everyone saw Long Chen laughing and saying such nice words, making them think that he was going over to apologize, Long Chen kicked the elder in his chest, making him tumble back.

The elder then coughed up blood, and cracks covered his body. With a furious howl, he summoned his battle armor.

But at the next moment, a black dagger cut through the air. With a splash, that elder’s head flew off of his body and fell in Long Chen’s hand.

Everyone was stunned. Now, those elders were terrified. They shot up from their seats and created some distance between them and Long Chen.

The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch’s battle armor was an inherited one. It was the most famous battle armor within the entire Alldevil Star-Field. But even in it, his head was cut off in a single blow, which terrified these half-step Divine Venerates.

The others were ashen. They had received word that the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College would be leading this war. That meant that all other sects and powers had to listen to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s orders.

It had to be known that while the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was an enormous existence within the Alldevil Star-Field, in terms of pure fighting power, they only ranked fifth.

When this news spread, the other powers were egged on by certain people and came to watch the reaction.

As for the four powers that ranked above them, they sent people with the intention of demanding an explanation. This patriarch of the Celestial Essence Sect in particular was very angry with it. That was because in terms of battleships, battle armors, and the number of experts, the Celestial Essence Sect was number one.

Hence, he was naturally displeased when he heard this news and directly came with everyone else to demand an explanation from the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.

This old fellow might be old and smart, but he was still within Xue Yifan’s calculations. Xue Yifan introduced them, and then Long Chen directly took out his weapon.

“Old tortoise of the Celestial Essence Sect, tell me, are you tired of living? If you are, I’ll kill you right now as an offering to the heavens. I’ve heard that in the ancient era, people offered the six domestic animals as a sacrifice to the heavens before big battles to pray for victory. I feel like you’re not a bad sacrifice. You should be worth at least one full sacrifice,” said Long Chen darkly, staring at the patriarch’s head.
