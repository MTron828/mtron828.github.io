Chapter 2165 The Terrifying Kun Pengzi

This attack was so sudden that neither Meng Qi nor Kun Pengzi saw who the attacker was.

All Kun Pengzi felt was an immense power that sent him flying. Half his head caved in.

“Long Chen!”

Just from that familiar sound, that familiar orbit, Meng Qi knew that it was Long Chen. He was the only one who could make face-slapping into a divine art.

“It’s been hard on you. Leave the rest to me.” Long Chen’s familiar voice rang out, making Meng Qi sigh with relief.

After sending Kun Pengzi flying, Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, his aura instantly bursting forth like a volcano. His aura was berserk, and he was overflowing with killing intent.

Evilmoon unleashed a giant saber-image piercing the heavens. Long Chen was directly using the eighth form of Split the Heavens.

“You didn’t die? That’s good too. It means I can personally kill you.” Kun Pengzi was startled to see Long Chen. He had thought that Long Chen would be dead by now.

Long Chen’s killing intent grew once more. As expected, it was all planned. Seeing the corpses of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race on the ground, Long Chen let out a heaven-shaking roar. “It just so happens that I also want to personally kill you!”

Long Chen’s saber fell mercilessly. In front of Long Chen, Kun Pengzi no longer dared to fight barehanded, and he took out an ancient war halberd. The halberd was covered in lightning runes emitting a fierce aura. This was a weapon that had ended countless lives.

BOOM!

The halberd’s runes lit up, destroying Long Chen’s saber-image. Long Chen was forced back, his blood flipping inside him.

Startled, Long Chen looked at the halberd. The lightning runes on it were like dragons roaming around. Its aura was like an emperor looking down on the rest of the world.

“A true divine item?” Long Chen’s heart shook.

Most of the divine items he had encountered so far were quasi divine items and half-step divine items. True divine items were very rare. For example, Pill Valley’s Brahma Divine Diagram and the Daynight Furnace, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s Xuantian Tower, and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s Heaven Splitting Blade.

Those were true divine items, but they were all used for maintaining karmic luck, so they could only unleash their full potential when supported by karmic luck.

This was why even Tian Xiezi’s Corrupt God Ancient Tower had been temporarily unable to do anything to Li Tianxuan. It needed the support of karmic luck to unleash its full power.

Kun Pengzi’s cultivation base was the same as Long Chen’s, but he was actually able to control this divine item. Its power was even greater than the Brahma Divine Diagram used by the Pill Fairy.

“This is the Kunpeng race’s inherited divine item. It was personally created by the Peng Emperor back in the day. I’m actually surprised that your trash saber didn’t break. This divine item hasn’t appeared in the world for a long time, so you can die at peace knowing that I took it out to kill you.” The Kunpeng in Kun Pengzi’s manifestation slowly spread its wings. Its wings soared into the sky as if propping up the heavens. “I’ll show you what a heavens’ soul manifestation is before you die. This is the Peng race’s inherited manifestation, Kunpeng Splits the Azure Sky.”

Kun Pengzi’s manifestation suddenly exploded. The Kunpeng within the manifestation actually flew out into the world. At the same time, two lightning runes spun within Kun Pengzi’s hands. His aura began to climb rapidly. The lightning halberd in his hand also began to blaze with light, becoming like a sun illuminating this world.

“Break!” Kun Pengzi let out a cry, and his lightning spear wildly slashed down. Whether it was the Dragonblood warriors, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, or even the Xuan Beasts, their fighting all slowed down as they stared in shock at Kun Pengzi.

The current Kun Pengzi was practically like a god. A powerful will spread out of him, one that forced others to submit.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s Five Star Battle Armor was activated, and he didn’t hold back the power of the azure dragon. However, despite going all-out, he was still sent flying once more, coughing up a mouthful of blood.

“It still didn’t break? Interesting.” Seeing that Evilmoon didn’t show any signs of shattering, Kun Pengzi was a bit surprised.

Long Chen wiped away the blood on his mouth, cursing Evilmoon for still not being awake. Without its help, he was at too much of a disadvantage.

Evilmoon was still slumbering, so it wasn’t giving him any divine power in assistance. Everything was dependent on his own power. If it was a clash of power against power, Long Chen wouldn’t fear anyone. But there was a qualitative difference between mortal power and divine power. He was at an immense disadvantage against divine power.

Regretfully, Evilmoon and the Heaven Flipping Seal were both in slumber after absorbing all the divine energy in the stone statues he had stolen from the Brahma Divine Palace. They were temporarily unable to help him. Against Kun Pengzi who was in control of a true divine item, Long Chen was unable to fight evenly.

“Let’s see how long you can last. I heard you also specialize in controlling lightning. Let me see just how strong your lightning is, and if it can match my Kunpeng race’s innate divine lighting.” Kun Pengzi laughed arrogantly, charging at Long Chen with his lightning halberd.

“Then have a look!” Long Chen took a deep breath and put away Evilmoon. Upon forming hand seals, a brilliant dragon cry rang out.

Lei Long appeared, circling in the air. A giant lightning channel emerged.

After that, a giant claw came reaching out of the lighting channel, striking Kun Pengzi. Kun Pengzi was badly shocked, and his hasty block resulted in him being swatted away.

Heaven and earth rumbled. A giant silver drake came flying out of the channel. Lightning filled the surroundings.

“Drake king, activate the lightning domain’s power to help me out!” Long Chen summoned a pair of lightning wings and a lightning spear.

The drake king’s claw shone brightly, and a sacred aura erupted out of it. As a result, the lightning passage shook, and thunderforce poured out of the channel from the lightning domain.

Bathed within a sea of lightning, Long Chen’s lightning wings and spear grew stronger and stronger. This was the blessing of the lightning domain. Its power was slowly entering the Martial Heaven Continent, filling Long Chen and the drake king with power.

“Long Chen, after receiving your favors in the past, I’ll repay you a bit today.” The drake king sent him a message and then charged forward, a claw smashing down on Kun Pengzi. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Hmph, a spirit of a paragon art also dares to be arrogant?!” Kun Pengzi’s halberd suddenly transformed into a blazing streak of divine light that struck the dragon claw.

However, he had underestimated the silver drake king’s power. The divine light shattered and Kun Pengzi coughed up blood.

Just at that moment, Long Chen’s Wild Lightning Soul Battle Spear appeared behind him, as if everything had been calculated perfectly.

“Kunpeng Lightning Shield!” shouted Kun Pengzi. The halberd began to spin rapidly, and the Kunpeng manifestation behind him unleashed thunderforce that condensed into a giant shield before him.

BOOM!

The lightning spear and lightning shield exploded at the same time, transforming into specks of light like a beautiful firework.

“It was actually able to pierce the shield of my divine lightning?” Kun Pengzi’s expression finally changed. Although the power that Long Chen controlled wasn’t as violent as the silver drake king’s, it contained a divine power that actually managed to gain an advantage over his innate lightning.

Kun Pengzi’s lightning was an innate divine ability. Even heavenly tribulation lightning was unable to harm him.

However, he had no time to consider why Long Chen’s thunderforce was so powerful. That was because the drake king’s claw was whipping toward him. He felt a suffocating feeling from it.

“Kunpeng True Body, Suppress Heaven and Earth!”

Kun Pengzi no longer maintained his human form. He transformed into a giant Kunpeng, merging with the image of his manifestation. His huge wings were enveloped by lightning, and he clashed with the drake king’s tail.

A powerful explosion shook the sky, and the earth cracked into pieces. The surrounding mountains were blown to smithereens.

Having summoned his true body clearly showed that Kun Pengzi had been forced to bring out his strongest techniques. It went without saying that Kun Pengzi’s strongest state was in his true form. With it, he and the drake king were actually equally matched. His claws reached out as he took the initiative to attack the drake king.

“A spirit of a paragon art thinks it can look down on my Kunpeng race?!” raged Kun Pengzi. He wanted to first eliminate the drake king because it posed the greatest threat to him.

“If it weren’t for the spatial channel being too narrow and my power being limited by the laws here, would you be able to receive a single attack from me?!” The drake king was also infuriated now by the insult.

Just at this moment, Long Chen shot toward Kun Pengzi as well.

Rumbling rang out as Kun Pengzi was forced back over and over again. Divine lightning arts continuously came out of him in brilliant transformations.

“Long Chen, you’re running out of thunderforce. The channel is about to close!” transmitted the drake king to Long Chen in the middle of their fight.

The drake king’s violent fighting style continuously shook the channel, causing it to use up Long Chen’s power rapidly. Once the channel broke down, the drake king would have to return.

“It’s that bastard’s thunderforce. He’s intentionally damaging my lightning channel. Drake king, hold him down for me. I’ll use something big on him.”

Long Chen suddenly retreated from the battle. He raised his right hand, about to summon the World Extermination Flame Lotus.

However, at that moment, a streak of divine light pierced the sea of lightning and struck Kun Pengzi.
