Chapter 3495

“What a fool. You can hide your voice, but can you hide your soul? And even if you can hide your soul, can you hide your hostility?” Long Chen raised that elder by the throat like lifting a chicken. His expression was apathetic.

Everyone was startled. This elder might not count as a peak expert in the city, but he was the sect master of a powerful sect, and many people recognized him.

Who would have thought that this sect master would be unable to endure a single blow from Long Chen before falling into his hands? This sect master didn’t even have the slightest ability to resist.

“Boss San, spare my life!” the World King pleaded.

“You want to stall for time? That alone deserves death.” Long Chen snorted. Just like that, the World King was blown apart into smithereens without being able to even grunt.

“You wanted to kill me. How could I spare you? Only your life is important, but my life isn’t?” Long Chen coldly looked at those specks that were the last evidence of this World King’s existence. He sneered disdainfully.

Long Chen’s gaze then swept through the distant buildings, and some World Kings hiding in the dark felt their hearts shake. Just now, they also thought about how to stall him when they saw him walking toward the transportation formation.

It was that little bit of hesitation that saved their lives. They were secretly keeping an eye on Long Chen, but Long Chen’s phantom-like movement art terrified them. None of them had seen how Long Chen had moved.

After Long Chen killed that World King, they were woken up from their desire of obtaining the bounty. They had only been thinking of Long Chen’s cultivation base but had forgotten how he was a terrifying existence that had killed dozens of World Kings.

The death of that World King was like an alarm waking them up. Quite a few people felt a burst of fear. If they had also tried to stall for time just now, they would already be corpses. No, they wouldn’t even have a corpse left.

As for the youngsters, at the same time as they were shocked, they were also inspired. The rumors were actually true. At the Divine Lord realm, Long Chen was capable of crossing two major realms to kill World Kings. Furthermore, he killed them with just the wave of his hand, as if it was effortless.

This scene caused their blood to burn with excitement. Humans were a very curious lifeform. Even if they themselves were lacking, seeing someone with the same cultivation base as them be a supreme expert, they would think that one day, they might also become like that.

Although inside, they knew that such a thing was almost impossible, they had a living example like Boss Long San right in front of them. Hence, they felt full of hope.

That was especially true when they saw those World Kings being so suppressed that they didn’t even dare to make a sound. They all felt like Boss Long San was their representative. Watching him kill that World King was both satisfying and addicting.

“Boss Long San, leave quickly! The Soaring Dragon Company wants to capture you. They’ll definitely come prepared!” warned someone.

Long Chen smiled and nodded in thanks toward that person. He had reached the transportation formation. Countless young men and women waved excitedly to him. They were already very satisfied to have seen this legendary Boss Long San.

However, while Long Chen stepped onto the transportation formation, no one activated it. Long Chen simply stood there, not activating it either.

“Boss Long San, do you not know how to activate it? Do you want this junior brother to help?” asked one brave soul.

Long Chen smiled. This youth was merely in the Four Peak realm, and he looked at Long Chen worshipfully. This fellow was definitely still too young. He didn’t realize that helping Long Chen escape would draw the wrath of the Soaring Dragon Company.

Long Chen then flicked his finger, and a round thing flew toward that youth. Feeling stunned, he extended his hand and caught it. His jaw then dropped.

It was a lily seed filled with Water Qi. This thrumming water element energy delighted the youth.

“The water lily seed of the Devil Eye Water Lily?!” Someone cried out, recognizing the origin of this object.

This youth was a water element cultivator, but his aptitude wasn’t particularly high, so this water lily seed would greatly improve his aptitude. Although it wouldn’t be to the point of changing his fate in a heaven-defying way, it was already a huge opportunity for him.

“Everyone, get back!” ordered Long Chen suddenly.

Everyone was startled, but they still respected his order and they retreated.

Long Chen’s gaze was locked onto the transportation formation, like a cheetah waiting for his prey to appear. The other experts stared at him, seemingly understanding what he was doing now. Expressions of disbelief came across their faces.

Suddenly, the transportation formation unleashed a ripple. It was at this moment that the prepared Long Chen unleashed a punch on the formation.

BOOM!

The transportation formation exploded and countless fragments of spacetime flew about. A black hole then appeared where the transportation formation was.

Dozens of figures appeared within that black hole. But those figures had just appeared when they were devoured.

These people were World Kings. One of them was precisely that dark-faced third Heavenstage World King from before, and there were also two other experts with similar auras to him.

When they received the information, they immediately used transportation formations to arrive here. However, they hadn’t expected Long Chen to have long since been waiting for them. The moment they came out, Long Chen destroyed the transportation formation, and they were sucked into the chaotic flow of space.

The black hole had countless spatial blades spinning within it. Seeing them, those ordinary World Kings panicked and were blown apart by those spatial winds, turning into nothingness.

Long Chen had personally experienced just how terrifying these spatial blades in the chaotic flow of space were. Some of the larger ones simply couldn’t be blocked.

Back then, Long Chen only managed to see the spatial blades because he had opened his Purgatory Eyes. Now, he could still see them clearly without using the Purgatory Eyes due to how familiar he was with their auras.

A giant spatial blade was silently approaching them now. However, these World Kings were still completely unaware.

Long Chen couldn’t help tilting his body slightly to the left, as if he was tilting that spatial blade’s path into striking them.

Suddenly, that dark-faced elder’s expression changed. He couldn’t see the giant spatial blade, but he sensed the danger, so he took out a golden rod. This was a World Domain divine weapon. His armor had been half destroyed by Long Chen and had yet to recover, so he had found a World Domain divine weapon for himself in the meantime.

“Attack together!”

That elder shouted. Although they couldn’t see the spatial blades, their sense of danger was sharp. They could tell from which direction the danger was coming.

The dark-faced elder’s golden rod then smashed into the spatial blade. However, Long Chen found it curious that the elder’s new World Domain divine weapon didn’t react. No runes activated on it.

Long Chen was unaware that this dark-faced elder was completely unable to activate this weapon’s runes. The golden rod simply smashed into the spatial blade just like that. The other third Heavenstage World Kings also attacked, and three divine weapons struck at once.

BOOM!

Within the endless darkness, a sphere of light erupted. What Long Chen hadn’t expected was for the golden rod to explode when it smashed into the spatial blade. The immense force directly blew apart the nearby World Kings who were still struggling.

As for the third Heavenstage World Kings, they were left bloody and badly battered. They shot out of the black hole like shooting stars from the explosion.

However, Long Chen had been waiting. The Minghong Saber slashed out, accurately striking the dark-faced elder.

That elder’s arms had been destroyed, resulting in his armor being crippled. Now, he was flying out involuntarily, completely unable to dodge, so he was directly killed by Long Chen’s strike.

“You wanted Boss San’s life. Today, Boss San will take your lives first.” Long Chen snorted and shot toward the other two third Heavenstage World Kings.
