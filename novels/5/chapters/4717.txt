Chapter 4706 Heavenly Doyen Fruit, Heavenly Doyen Pill

The Earth Cauldron quivered, and a medicinal pill with nine star clouds on it flew out of the cauldron and landed in Long Chen’s hand.

The interior of this pill was muddy, not looking all that amazing. However, it possessed vast Doyen power. Long Chen was extremely excited holding it in his hand.

“It really works!” Although the Earth Cauldron had previously mentioned that once his power grew, he could refine Heavenly Doyen Pill, he hadn’t really dared to believe it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This was a nine star Heavenly Doyen Pill, which was created through the refinement of ninety-nine eight star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. The fluctuations it gave off were completely identical to a nine star Heavenly Doyen Fruit.

In other words, this was a pill that could create a powerful nine star Heavenly Doyen. It was absolutely heaven-defying.

Previously, Long Chen had been wondering how to deal with the fact that he only had around five hundred nine star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. How should he distribute them?

Although he knew that the Dragonblood warriors wouldn’t complain no matter how he split them up, as the boss, he had to share things equally.

This was why he was in no rush to distribute these nine star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. After all, the difference between eight star Doyens and nine star Doyens was immense.

Now, ninety-nine eight star Heavenly Doyen Fruits could be refined into one nine star Heavenly Doyen Pill, and this made Long Chen roar with excitement. With this, the entire Dragonblood Legion could become nine star Heavenly Doyens.

Long Chen was unable to imagine just how terrifying such a legion would be. In this world, who could possibly stop them from soaring to the very peak?

“Don’t get too excited. Refining Heavenly Doyen Fruits is taxing, and it must be done by you. Huo Linger cannot help you with this,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“Ah? Why not?” A bucket of ice water directly extinguished Long Chen’s excitement. He had several tens of thousands of eight star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. Even if he were to refine them all into nine star Heavenly Doyen Pills, that would only be a few hundred.

With over seven thousand people in the Dragonblood Legion, he still didn’t have enough eight star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. If he wanted to create eight star Heavenly Doyen Pills, he’d need to refine seven star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. And if those weren’t enough, he’d have to start with the six star fruits. If even that wasn’t enough, he’d have to resort to using the five star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. This was a terrifying amount of work. Refining from five stars to six stars to seven stars, all the way to nine stars, would be an incredibly strenuous task. If he needed to undergo all that shit, he might start coughing up blood. [1]

“There’s no way around it. You should understand how these Heavenly Doyen Fruits came to be. You are its master, so only you have the capability to merge the fruits. Even I cannot do it,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

The “it” the Earth Cauldron was referring to was naturally the Heavenly Dao Tree. Hearing this, Long Chen felt an overwhelming dread looming over him.

“Don’t think too much. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. As long as you can take the first step, you won’t be far from success. You can’t be afraid of trouble,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen also understood this principle, but thinking of this refinement process, anyone would feel despair. But for the Dragonblood Legion, Long Chen clenched his teeth and continued.

The next moment, the Earth Cauldron quivered, and tens of thousands of Heavenly Doyen Fruits appeared within it, startling Long Chen. “Senior, are you planning on making juice?”

“What juice? I am testing the limit of your Spiritual Strength. I want to see how many of these pills you can refine at once. If we were going to refine one pill at a time, how many years would it be before we finish? Let alone you, even I wouldn’t be able to bear it,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

“Ah, we can do that?” Long Chen couldn’t help being relieved.

Long Chen’s flame energy and Spiritual Strength then flowed into the Earth Cauldron. All of a sudden, he was delighted to discover that it was many times easier than refining Divine Venerate Pills.

After the span of an incense stick burning, hundreds of pills with five star clouds flew out of the Earth Cauldron. The Earth Cauldron was cautious and tested out Long Chen’s abilities with the four star Heavenly Doyen Fruits first. After all, if they ruined the eight star Heavenly Doyen Fruits because of some unexpected surprise, that would be awkward.

Hundreds of five star Heavenly Doyen Pills were then refined into less than ten six star Heavenly Doyen Pills, which wasn’t enough to even refine a single seven star Heavenly Doyen Pill. Fortunately, with this good start, the Earth Cauldron started to increase the output.

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was ample, and with his exquisite control, coupled with his enhanced understanding of alchemy, Long Chen’s upper limit was around refining a million Heavenly Doyen Fruits or Pills at once.

Using a million five star Heavenly Doyen Fruits, he refined them into ten thousand six star Heavenly Doyen Pills. From there, he further refined them into a hundred seven star Heavenly Doyen Pills, and ultimately produced a singular eight star Heavenly Doyen Pill.

It seemed like they were still far from the target, however, Long Chen had plenty of six star and seven star Heavenly Doyen Fruits. Long Chen did a rough calculation and found that he wouldn’t be that far off once he had refined them all.

Long Chen started refining pills day and night, not even pausing for sleep. After a whole month passed by, he had finally refined over eight thousand nine star Heavenly Doyen Pills.

This process almost drove him crazy. As if lost in a trance, he slowly left his seclusive area. When Guo Ran and the others saw him in this state, they jumped in shock.

“Boss, are you alright?” Guo Ran hastily supported Long Chen. Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi ran over to replace Guo Ran and put Long Chen down so he could rest.

“Long Chen, what happened to you?” asked Yu Qingxuan worriedly. She had never seen Long Chen look so tired before.

“I’m fine. Guo Ran, distribute these fruits and pills to everyone. Everyone should pick one which fluctuations match their unique attributes. If there’s not enough, I can get more,” said Long Chen.

The reason Long Chen had refined extra pills was to give everyone more choices to choose from. When Guo Ran saw the fruits and pills, he instantly understood and left.

“I can finally take a break!” exclaimed Long Chen as he stretched as hard as he could. He ended up stretching into Bai Shishi’s embrace, causing her to blush. Fortunately, there were only her and Yu Qingxuan with Long Chen in this room. Even so, her heartbeat quickened. She wanted to push him off but couldn’t bear to do so.

When she glanced at Long Chen’s face, she found that he had actually fallen asleep. Bai Shishi’s heart hurt for him. From the battle in front of the gate to the ninth heaven to now, he had not rested at all. How did he even last this long?

When Long Chen awoke from his slumber, he found Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi lying on his left and right shoulder, whispering to each other. When they saw him awake, they immediately threw themselves into his embrace.

Long Chen placed his arms around their waists, wanting to enjoy some quality time while it lasted. After all, he rarely had the chance to. Sadly...

“Not good, not good!”

Just then, Bai Xiaole came running in with a shout.

1. Thready: I didn’t know you could do that... ^.^ ?
