Chapter 3914 Kun Tu

“Xiaoqian!”

Meng Qi cried out in delight when she saw that distant figure. It was Yue Xiaoqian. She had finally come to save them at this critical moment.

Her Devil Suppressing Seal was shining brightly, its holy light causing the blood sea to boil and the essence blood runes to be erased.

“You’re ruining things for me again! Just die!” Shi Yang howled furiously. Yue Xiaoqian’s Devil Suppressing Seal was greatly weakening the energy of his life sacrifice. With this, he wouldn’t be able to fully activate this devil corpse.

Shi Yang then waved his hand, and a blood spear shot out of the blood sea.

“Block his attacks! Buy time for Xiaoqian!” Meng Qi was the first to charge out, her golden bell appearing before her.

Even Shi Yang didn’t quite dare to fight this golden bell directly because it was a soul item, and every clash against it would hurt his soul. If he didn’t treat it cautiously, perhaps his soul would be ripped out of this devil corpse. But as long as he avoided it, Meng Qi’s attacks were unable to damage him.

Just as Shi Yang dodged Meng Qi’s attack, Yue Zifeng’s sword descended toward him. Realizing the threat posed by Yue Zifeng's relentless strikes, Shi Yang instinctively wrapped his tattered bat wings around himself for protection. Despite the wings bearing numerous scars, Yue Zifeng's strikes failed to sever them, leaving Shi Yang without any fatal wounds.

At this moment, everyone’s attacks fell on Shi Yang, stopping him from attacking Yue Xiaoqian. As a result, the blood sea was rapidly vanishing.

“Not good!” In the distance, Xia Chen cried out. When everyone went to block Shi Yang, the Underworld Eye Giant took this chance to charge forward. As the Dragonblood Legion was busy blocking powerful enemies on all sides, the Underworld Eye Giant managed to tear open a hole in their formation with a punch.

The breach caused by that single hole shattered their defensive formation. With this opportunity, the Underworld Eye Giant surged forward, breaking through their lines. Weng Tianyao, the beast cultivator, and numerous other concealed experts also unleashed a frenzied charge, joining the chaos without hesitation.

“Stop them!”

Qin Feng let out a roar. Long Chen had yet to awaken, so he was going to use his own body to stop them.

Whether it was Qin Feng, Qi Yu, or the rest of the Dragonblood warriors, they all charged in front of Long Chen without waiting for Xia Chen’s orders.

“Don’t needlessly sacrifice your lives. As long as I, Mo Nian, am present, no one can harm Long Chen.”

Mo Nian, who was dealing with Yin Changsheng, suddenly appeared on top of the coffin.

He put away his bow and sat down on the coffin, forming hand seals.

In response, the coffin emitted a radiant wave of light, giving rise to a great barrier that enveloped it.

Countless attacks from various experts bombarded the barrier, yet it held steadfast, impervious to their onslaught. Their attempts to break through proved futile as they were unable to breach its formidable defense.

“Hmph, this is an absolute defense. Even if I gave you ten years, you wouldn’t be able to break it,” sneered Mo Nian arrogantly.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, inside, he was cursing anxiously. “Long Chen, can you hurry up?! I can’t hold on much longer!”

Just then, a flame spear stabbed the barrier, causing it to shudder and be filled with cracks. Yin Changsheng naturally wouldn’t let Mo Nian do as he pleased.

Undeterred, Mo Nian simply changed his hand seals, and the cracks instantly vanished as if they had never appeared in the first place.

“Tch, that’s all you have?” mocked Mo Nian while he cursed more inside.

Suddenly, the skies grew dim and the earth plunged into darkness. An immense figure appeared, surpassing even Cloud in her Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow form. It was a figure that was essentially as large as an entire world.

Its pair of golden wings then crashed down from the heavens, emitting a terrifying pressure that made this world about to explode, shaking everyone’s soul with its apocalyptic aura.

“A Kunpeng?”

Mo Nian’s expression changed as he recognized the origins of this enormous figure. This indomitable will that defied the constraints of heaven and earth, yearning to transcend their limitations, could only belong to a Kunpeng.

“Long Chen, get the hell out here!”

Kun Tu’s voice shook the world, akin to the furious roar of a heavenly deity, resounding throughout every corner of the three thousand worlds.

BOOM!

Kun Tu’s heaven-shrouding wings fell upon the barrier. It was so enormous that the barrier appeared miniscule in front of it. When his wings struck the barrier, the impact tore the earth asunder, causing the Heavenly Daos to collapse and fragments of spacetime to fly about. All of heaven and earth were almost destroyed by this one attack.

Countless experts had charged forward upon seeing an opportunity. But when those wings fell, they were directly turned to dust. Other than Double Supremes, everyone else was wiped out.

As for Mo Nian, he spat out blood as he received a backlash. His barrier was covered in cracks, almost shattered by this attack.

“Fuck, if it weren’t for Long Chen, I’d show you who’s boss right now!” raged Mo Nian.

Defending passively like this put Mo Nian at a great disadvantage. Furthermore, Kun Tu’s power was immense and concentrated, making it impossible for Mo Nian to simply guide the force around him. He could only receive it directly.

Kun Tu’s arrival had completely changed the battlefield. Countless experts could only stare at his enormous figure in horror. In front of Kun Tu, even Double Supremes were quivering and completely subdued by his aura to the extent that they didn’t even dare to breathe hard.

When the Kunpeng arrived, the world submitted. The Kunpeng’s unrestrained aura was something that even the Heavenly Daos couldn’t resist, so every other lifeform felt suppressed by his aura.

This kind of suppression had nothing to do with the realm, bloodline, or soul. It was purely a matter of will. Any other lifeforms could only lower their heads in front of the Kunpeng.

“It didn’t break? Then try another attack,” Kun Tu snorted. His claws ignited with power as he extended them downward.

“Brothers, don’t just watch, help me out!” shouted Mo Nian.

Only then did everyone else react. All the Dragonblood warriors along with Meng Qi, the Pill Fairy, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others gathered behind Mo Nian. With the help of some hand seals, their Blood Qi and Spiritual Strength entered his body.

BOOM!

Kun Tu’s second attack landed with even greater force than the last. As a result, Mo Nian and the others quivered under the impact, yet their collective strength shielded them from harm as the force diffused among them.

“They won’t hold out for long. Attack together!” shouted Yin Changsheng. Mo Nian’s barrier was truly tough, and a single person couldn’t break it no matter what.

After all, Long Chen had reached a critical point, and they couldn’t let him fully absorb that dragon scale. If everyone attacked together, Mo Nian and the others wouldn’t be able to last much longer.

It wasn’t just Yin Changsheng who saw this. The others also noticed and swiftly unleashed their attacks. With tens of thousands of Double Supremes attacking at the same time, the barrier was quickly covered in cracks.
