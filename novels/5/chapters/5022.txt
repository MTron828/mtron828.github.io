Chapter 5011 Fuck Off

Long Tianrui’s words left Long Chen speechless once again, typical of her. He couldn’t even muster a response.

There was no denying Long Tianrui’s beauty, but her innate loftiness made it seem like she looked down on everyone. Even in seeking a partner, her primary concern was to have strong offspring. As for emotions? She didn’t seem to understand that concept.

To put it simply, Long Chen didn’t like Long Tianrui. He couldn’t tolerate her character.

Long Tianrui had proposed to Long Chen once again, underscoring how highly she regarded him. As a result, countless people burned with envy.

Among those were Ye Lingxiao, Zhao Qingtian, and even the Jiang clan’s Jiang Wuwang, who couldn’t help but feel a touch of envy.

“You shouldn’t be envious. This chance isn’t worth anything in front of him. He’s just not interested,” said Feng Fei.

Shaking his head, Jiang Wuwang replied, “I know, but I still don’t feel happy about it. To tell the truth, I really want to compete with Long Chen at least once. I want to know what is so outstanding about him that you idolize him so much. Even Long Tianrui views him so highly.”

Long Ziwei’s expression stiffened. This fellow wanted to challenge his boss? Then it wasn’t very suitable for him to be sitting here.

“It would be best if you gave up on that thought. Fighting against people of the same level is polishing yourself. However, against a monster like Long Chen, you will polish yourself into dust. It’s not worth it,” advised Feng Fei.

Jiang Wuwang smiled bitterly. “Do you know just how provocative your words are? Don’t you know that I am a very competitive man?”

“I know, and I also know you have something they don’t,” Feng Fei said with a smile. She was referring to Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao.

“What thing?” asked Jiang Wuwang curiously.

“You have a bit more intelligence,” replied Feng Fei, gesturing with her hand.

Jiang Wuwang said, “Thank you for your praise... Wait, you’ve said that those two don’t even have brains.”

Suddenly, Jiang Wuwang realized that it wasn’t praise. Being only a bit more intelligent than two brainless people? In other words, he barely had a brain, right?

“It’s more than enough. You should be satisfied with what you have. I feel like I only have a bit more intelligence than you,” remarked Feng Fei.

Hearing her say that, Jiang Wuwang felt a bit better. As he turned his attention to Long Chen again, he couldn’t help but ask, “Then what about him?”

“Him?” Feng Fei’s expression became a bit odd. “His intelligence is sometimes this big.”

Before this, she had used her thumb and finger to show a tiny gap, about half an inch. But when referring to Long Chen, she spread her hands three feet apart.

Jiang Wuwang couldn't help but feel a bit angry. Was she insulting him? But he also caught the gist of her statement and asked, "And what about other times?"

Feng Fei clapped her hands together and looked at Jiang Wuwang.

“What does that mean?”

Feng Fei explained, “Nothing. This fellow isn’t frightening when he’s being limitlessly smart; he’s frightening when he becomes limitlessly brainless. Once he throws his brain out, something big is about to happen. He is someone you can’t see through. No one can understand his true power or his thoughts. Sometimes he is like a wily old fox, and sometimes he’s like a stupid donkey. That’s why I don’t want you to fight him. You won’t know whether you’ll be fighting a wiseman or a madman.”

Hearing this explanation, Long Ziwei was dumbfounded. Just as he started to think that he understood Long Chen, he realized that he didn’t know him at all. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Fei was telling Jiang Wuwang not to fight Long Chen. She didn’t even bother concealing that she thought he wasn’t a match for Long Chen.

“Wuwang, let me ask you a question,” remarked Feng Fei with a serious tone.

Startled, Jiang Wuwang replied, “What is it?”

“As a disciple of the Jiang clan, are you loyal to the clan leader, or are you loyal to the Jiang clan?”

“Is there a difference?” asked Jiang Wuwang, confused.

“Of course there is. If you are loyal to the Jiang clan, you must always act with the clan’s best interests in mind. If you are loyal to the clan leader, you only follow his orders. It might seem like there’s no difference, but if one day the clan leader makes a decision that puts the Jiang clan in danger, what will you do?”

“I...” Jiang Wuwang was dumbfounded.

Feng Fei laughed. “Hahaha, it’s just a joke. Don’t treat it so seriously.”

As Feng Fei and Jiang Wuwang whispered, three people were staring at Long Chen, their eyes fixed on him without even blinking.

One was Long Tianrui, who was still waiting for Long Chen’s response. The other two, Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao, glared at Long Chen with such intense killing intent that it seemed they might tear him to pieces at any moment.

Long Chen had originally planned to ignore Long Tianrui, but he hadn’t expected her to just stand there, waiting for his response, as if she wouldn’t leave until he responded to her.

“Consider me convinced of your superiority, alright? I cannot accept your proposal. Can you understand my words?” asked Long Chen.

Long Tianrui shook her head. “I cannot. Why do you not cherish the chance many would risk their lives for? Do you know? You see, I promised that if anyone could defeat me in this elite competition, I would marry them. If no one could, I would select the strongest to be my follower. But you can bypass all those troublesome affairs. Why do you not cherish it?”

Long Tianrui frowned, unable to understand why Long Chen would reject such a favorable offer.

Everyone who heard this was startled. Now they understood why Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao were glaring at Long Chen with such animosity.

They were all after Long Tianrui, but she didn’t seem to have a high opinion of them. Hence, for her to propose to Long Chen was a huge insult to them.

Now Long Chen got it. These two simply hated him because of Long Tianrui.

“Thank you for your good intentions, but I already have many wives at home,” answered Long Chen.

“I don’t mind!” Long Tianrui was unperturbed. “I just need you to accomplish my goal.”

You don’t mind, but I mind, alright? Long Chen was speechless. Were people from the ancient era always so stubborn?

Long Tianrui continued, “I can sense that your bloodline is exceptionally strong, just what I need. Due to a flaw in a sealing formation, my body will begin to regress in function after a hundred years. I must find the best partner within these hundred years. Once my cultivation base reaches the limit, I will have their children.”

After hearing her problem, Long Chen tried to reason with her patiently. “In truth, there are many strong bloodlines in this world. You still have a hundred years; there’s no need to rush.”

Observing Long Chen for a moment, Long Tianrui added, “I heard that your father is very powerful. If you decline, I will consider looking for him.”

Long Chen exploded, “Fuck off!”
