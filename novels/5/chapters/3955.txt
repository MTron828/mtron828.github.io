Chapter 3944 Invitation

Eighteen women were seated atop the stage, looking as graceful as fairies. In this enchanting moment, their graceful thin fingers danced across their zithers, conjuring melodies that possessed the power to immerse one's very soul.

This beautiful scene cleansed the eyes, ears, and soul. In the distance, Long Chen’s vexations were forgotten, wiped away without a trace, and his soul entered a peaceful state. It was an indescribable contentment.

The plaza was packed with people, as the crowd eagerly gathered to witness the spectacle. Separated from them, designated seats were arranged in front of the stage, reserved exclusively for a certain group of experts. Long Chen’s discerning gaze then fell upon the mark of the Vermilion Bird on their sleeves. Having seen such marks on Zhu Yunwen’s robes, he knew that it must be the mark of the royal family.

Beside the imperial disciples, there were also a group of young scholarly individuals seated nearby. Although they were not cultivators themselves, they occupied the same area as the imperial disciples. However, a clear division was evident, as neither group chose to intermingle or sit together. Each faction maintained its distinct space, separate from the other.

Other than the thousands of seats at the front, the others could only watch from a distance. At this moment, the plaza already had hundreds of thousands of people packed inside of it, but not a single person made any noise. They all silently appreciated the beautiful zither music.

Within the crowd, Long Chen wasn’t so tall that he stood out. However, his large saber always drew some attention.

Those scholars then looked at Long Chen disdainfully, as if his equipment displeased them. But they also didn’t say anything.

Ignoring those gazes, Long Chen was appreciating the performance while observing the imperial disciples. He neither saw the crown prince nor the figure that he had been hoping to see.

However, he sensed several powerful auras among them, akin to a calm sea concealing an ancient deep-sea monster. Long Chen couldn’t help sighing emotionally. The Vermilion Bird Empire was truly a den of crouching tigers and hidden dragons.

Long Chen’s attention then turned to Liao Yuhuang, who was also a powerful expert. Today, she was playing music with so many others, and they had to be from the same sect as her. In other words, they were all from one of the four immemorial sects, the Zither Sect.

Suddenly, a yellow-robed woman stepped forward, and a burst of flute music appeared over the zither music, causing the pitch of the music to gradually rise.

When the melody reached a fever-pitch, it suddenly came to a stop. The zither music, the flute music, they all stopped. However, their echoes remained, causing the people’s souls to feel like they had been lifted beyond the clouds. The feeling of floating didn’t fade for a long time.

It was only after a long pause that the applause started. Once it began, it was thunderous. Everyone was amazed as they had never heard such a beautiful yet soul-shaking song.

The final high note seemed to bring people above the dome of the heavens. That impact and explosiveness gave them a rich aftertaste, causing them to feel like they had seen an unprecedented world.

Whether it was the cultivators or the ordinary people, they formed a resonance with the music. Hence, all of them clapped as if their lives were on the line.

After that, the yellow-robed woman and the zither players stood and bowed to everyone. When Liao Yuhuang’s gaze swept over the crowd, her eyes suddenly brightened as she saw Long Chen within the crowd.

Long Chen nodded toward her. Although they didn’t have much of a relationship, Liao Yuhuang had helped Long Chen in the Nine Prefecture Convention, and Long Chen had always remembered this favor.

Liao Yuhuan suddenly whispered into the ear of the yellow-robed woman, who then looked at Long Chen a bit oddly and nodded.

Liao Yuhuang gracefully ran down the stage, lifting her robe to keep her from stepping over it. Her actions instantly drew everyone’s attention.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, seeing the yellow-robed woman and the other women looking at Long Chen as if waiting for something, everyone stared at him. They found that no one recognized this black-robed man.

“Fairy Yuhuang, it’s been a long time. You are as beautiful as ever, and your Music Dao has once more advanced. Congratulations,” Long Chen greeted Liao Yuhuang first.

“Brother Long is too courteous. In just a year, your Blood Qi has reached an astonishing height. You are soaring through the martial path. That is what’s really worth congratulating.” Liao Yuhuang returned his greeting with a smile. She seemed very happy to see him. “If brother Long doesn’t mind, you can come sit with us.”

This invitation shocked countless people. The Zither Sect’s disciples were all fairies, revered as sacred symbols. They were so transcendent that it compelled others to maintain a great distance from them.

Normal people could enjoy the music of the Zither Sect’s disciples, but not many of them dared to even speak to the fairies. Even the ones sitting at the front with special statuses did not dare to rashly open their mouths for fear of being rude.

Consequently, Liao Yuhuang's enthusiastic invitation for Long Chen to join them left people astonished and filled with envy. Quite a few people began to whisper, guessing Long Chen’s origins.

“No need. I was just in the vicinity and drawn over by your wondrous music. I’m glad I got to hear it, but I have to leave. Fairy Yuhuang, you don’t need to waste your time on me.” Seeing so many people staring at him, Long Chen instantly felt uncomfortable. He did not want to make a scene here.

In particular, when those scholars glared at him with hostile gazes, Long Chen feared that his temper might erupt and he would end up killing them with a single slap.

“Brother Long, can you not do me the honor of your pointers? In the Nine Prefecture Convention, I didn’t get a chance to ask for your advice on the Music Dao. This time, I cannot miss the chance again.” Liao Yuhuang actually grabbed Long Chen’s hand and dragged him over to the stage, not giving him a chance to refuse.

Long Chen was embarrassed as this gesture seemed excessively intimate. However, when he looked into Liao Yuhuang's eyes, he realized that her intentions were pure. This action was devoid of any romantic implications; it was purely to keep him here.

Hence, Long Chen couldn’t bring himself to be so rude as to throw her hand away. That would appear far too crude.

Helplessly, he thickened his face and walked to the front. When he was in front of the stage, he found that all the seats were taken, and all of the people there stared at him frostily. The scholars in particular looked at him arrogantly, with no intention of giving up their spots.

“Brothers, if you don’t mind, why don’t we squeeze together a bit?” Just as Liao Yuhuang was about to speak, a young man in the third row waved to Long Chen warmly.

This young man seemed to be in his early twenties, and his face still had a trace of immaturity on it, giving him the air of a grown-up boy

However, this young man was a terrifying Supreme expert with a powerful aura. But even such a powerful existence still gave off a pure and innocent feeling, as if he would never harm anyone.

“Then many thanks.”

Long Chen cupped his fists and sat beside that person, sharing his seat. Liao Yuhuang was originally planning on having Long Chen sit in the front row as an expression of respect, but he didn’t give her the chance.

“You are Long Chen?”

Suddenly, from the first row, a woman turned back and looked at Long Chen coldly, her voice full of hostility.
