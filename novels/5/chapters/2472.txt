Chapter 2462 Realm Suppression

Translator: BornToBe

The statue within Tian Xiezi’s manifestation suddenly came to life, forming its own hand seals.

The manifestation swept over the world, creating a spherical domain around Long Chen and the others. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This domain was a part of Tian Xiezi’s manifestation. It was like they had been sucked inside of it.

Everyone’s expression changed. Guo Ran was the first to attempt charging out, but his attack didn’t shake the sphere at all.

“Hahaha!” Tian Xiezi laughed, standing atop the statue. “Did you think that I only had this little bit of ability? You’re naive! You have no idea just how terrifying a manifestation can be when its true name is called out. You are within my manifestation’s domain. Here, I am god and none of you can compete with me.”

Wilde, who either didn’t believe him or didn’t understand, attacked. His bone club smashed toward Tian Xiezi, but the statue moved, smashing a fist at Wilde.

As a result, Wilde’s incredibly tough bone club that had never been damaged in battle shattered.

“Wilde!”

Everyone was startled, rushing over. Wilde smashed into the wall of the domain and bounced off of it. When he picked himself up, his hands were covered in blood. Crack lines had appeared up to his shoulder.

“Foolish oaf, in this place, your brute power is far from enough. A fully awakened manifestation can unleash world energy through every bit of it. Your world energy can only be released through your body, but my world energy is fully unleashed throughout this entire domain. This domain is my world. Here, I can freely unleash the full power of my astral space, and it is no longer limited by my physical body. Can a person’s power contend with the power of a world?” Tian Xiezi swept his gaze across them. Their shocked appearances were extremely satisfactory to him.

“I bet you never imagined just how much power a manifestation could unleash. Although many of you are talented and have a chance of reaching this level, I won’t be giving you that chance. Your lives will end here,” said Tian Xiezi.

Some faint rumbling rang out. It was possible to see Ye Lingshan, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and the others attacking the barrier. However, their power was unable to break through. They were like grasshoppers jumping into a heavy door.

“I have just entered the Samsara realm, but unless someone’s power can transcend the laws of my manifestation, this barrier will not break. Everyone, it’s about time for you to die. I still have more important things to do. Long Chen, so sorry, I’m going to start with your friends.” Tian Xiezi smiled at Long Chen sinisterly.

However, from start to end, Long Chen remained expressionless. Lightning flickered around him, but that lightning was starting to lose its light under Tian Xiezi’s suppression.

“It’s Guo Ran, right? An ant like you isn't qualified to stand in front of me. I’ll kill you first. You can consider it my favor to you.” Tian Xiezi raised his hand, and a ray of golden light shot out.

“Dodge!” Everyone wanted to stop it, but they were shocked to find that their Heavenly Dao energy had been isolated from them. The golden light had reached Guo Ran.

Guo Ran summoned the defenses of his armor, only to have the runes on his armor flicker. This armor was designed to work with his Heavenly Dao energy. Without it, his armor’s power dropped by over half.

“It’s over.” A sense of death swamped Guo Ran’s heart.

BOOM!

The golden light was shattered by a ray of sword-light. Guo Ran tumbled back, his armor growing dim.

“Zifeng!” Everyone was delighted to see Guo Ran alive. The one to save him was Yue Zifeng, but his expression was extremely heavy.

“The legends say that the Sword Dao can stand outside the Heavenly Daos on its own. It seems that the legends are true.” Tian Xiezi looked at Yue Zifeng. Sword cultivators were the most difficult existences to judge in this world.

The only one not suppressed by his domain was Yue Zifeng. Tian Xiezi then glanced toward the lightning-covered Long Chen and shook his head. “Who would have thought that the famous Long Chen would be suppressed to such an extent, but you are still able to move. Well, I don’t mind showing you how outmatched you are.”

Tian Xiezi formed new hand seals. After that, the statue released a wave of golden light that enveloped everyone. In that instant, Meng Qi and the others were shocked to find that they could no longer move.

“This is a different kind of Heavenly Dao energy, or perhaps it should be called world energy. Within this domain, he is the ruler of the Heavenly Daos. Our realms are suppressed,” Meng Qi transmitted to everyone.

On their way here, they had encountered experts in the Samsara realm, and they had killed some of them. But they had never encountered someone with such power. This was a completely suppressive power that they couldn’t contend against.

“Zifeng!” Everyone suddenly let out a startled cry. At this moment, Tian Xiezi’s spear pierced toward Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng’s sword danced before him, blocking seven of Tian Xiezi’s attacks in a row. However, on the eighth time, his sword shattered. Fragments cut into Yue Zifeng’s body.

As he wasn’t an Empyrean, he couldn’t use Heavenly Dao energy to heal. Adding on the weak bodies of sword cultivators, these wounds, insignificant to others, could be fatal for him.

This was Tian Xiezi’s domain, so Yue Zifeng couldn’t even use his life energy to heal here.

“I really do admire you. You aren’t an Empyrean, but by relying on yourself, you were able to reach this level. You might even give me a more threatening feeling than Long Chen. But now I can rest easy.” A ray of light enveloped Yue Zifeng, making him unable to move either.

Yue Zifeng was covered in blood. Watching as Tian Xiezi slowly approached him, he didn’t show the slightest fear. He just looked at him calmly.

“Although I admire you, I still have no choice but to kill you.” Tian Xiezi smiled faintly and pointed his spear at Yue Zifeng’s head. He turned to look at Long Chen. “Long Chen, I will now return my humiliation to you tenfold. Right in front of you, I will kill everyone by your side.”

At this moment, the lightning around Long Chen had weakened to the point that it was barely flickering. At some time, even his divine ring had faded. However, his expression was still calm.

“Have you heard of this saying? Idiots always talk a lot before death.” Finally, Long Chen spoke for the first time since entering Tian Xiezi’s domain. However, as soon as he spoke, Tian Xiezi’s expression changed. Long Chen’s voice was not his voice. It was a synthetic voice of rumbling thunder.

Having a bad feeling, Tian Xiezi directly stabbed his spear toward Yue Zifeng’s head.

“Too late.” Long Chen suddenly laughed.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s body exploded, and a sinister black saber flew out of him. Evilmoon had actually blown Long Chen up and pierced straight toward Tian Xiezi.

Tian Xiezi was shocked to find that Evilmoon was also able to ignore the laws of his domain. It contained such destructive power that he knew if he was struck, he would definitely die. With his domain unable to bind it, he had no choice but to give up on Yue Zifeng and swing his spear at Evilmoon.

However, just as the two weapons were about to meet, Evilmoon vanished. His spear swept through empty air.

A figure suddenly appeared in front of him, slapping him in the face.

“Long Chen!” When Tian Xiezi stabilized himself in the distance, he saw Long Chen standing beside Yue Zifeng with Evilmoon in his hand. Moreover, as he sensed the life and death energy flowing within Long Chen’s body in an endless cycle, he was dumbfounded.

“Are you surprised?”

Long Chen swung Evilmoon, causing the void to shatter. The power binding everyone was broken, so Meng Qi and the others regained their freedom.

Wilde staggered and almost fell. Tian Xiezi had given him some special attention, binding him with three times the power of the others. Someone else would have been directly pulverized.

Wilde was like Yue Zifeng in that he didn’t need Heavenly Dao energy, but his brute power was also suppressed within this domain. After his weapon was broken, he didn’t know how to unleash his power.

“Boss, you succeeded?” asked Guo Ran delightedly.

“I finished three breaths’ time before, but I was finishing up some arrangements. Now, everything is under control.” Long Chen turned toward Tian Xiezi. “Tian Xiezi, we can settle all our grudges today. Bring out whatever power you have, or you won’t get another chance in the future.”
