Chapter 2897 Maze Battlefield

Long Chen suddenly found himself brought to a mountain valley. However, the other disciples who weren’t part of the competition found that the plaza had transformed into an illusory world. Long Chen and the others were within it, while they were spectating.

The plaza had transformed into its own world filled with criss-crossing mountains. It was like a maze.

At the center was a tall mountain with a rainbow flag stuck at the top. Whoever seized that flag in the end would win.

Long Chen and the others then saw a formation up above them. As they were unable to directly fly up, they could only traverse through the labyrinth-like valleys between the mountains, hoping to find the correct path in the shortest time.

Mu Qingyun and the others had experienced this once, so they immediately split up, each of them carrying some glowing powder. They began to search for the right path with the greatest speed.

On the other hand, Long Chen closed his eyes. He formed hand seals, sending his Spiritual Strength flying out. If he could find the path this way, it would save a huge amount of time.

The disciples outside instantly understood his intentions. Some shook their heads. “Did Long Chen not study the strategies? Did Mu Qingyun not warn him? Spiritual Strength is severely suppressed in the formation.”

Just at this moment, a startled cry rang out from the spectators. Blue smoke appeared on the side belonging to Chu Kuang and rapidly surged forward like the tide.

“That’s the Formation Institute’s Tang Yaochen. He’s using a formation to find the right path!”

The blue smoke was extremely rapid. Tang Yaochen was incredibly efficient.

On the other hand, Mu Qingyun and the others had only covered a tenth of the necessary area to find the right path. But Chu Kuang’s side was already a third done.

At this moment, the space around Long Chen quivered, and the suppression of the formation above him appeared. However, he didn’t stop. Resisting that suppression, his Spiritual Strength continued onward.

The formation runes lit up. They were originally a thin membrane, but now they began to rise like a bubble around Long Chen. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What is going on!?” Everyone was startled to see this. They had never seen such a phenomenon.

“Who can explain?! Is Long Chen cheating?! Whose Spiritual Strength could possibly resist the entire grand formation?!”

“It has nothing to do with Spiritual Strength.” Just at this moment, an old voice rang out.

“Heaven Master Yun Yang!”

More startled cries rang out. Heaven Master Yun Yang had actually been amongst their midst, and none of them had noticed.

“Heaven Master Yun Yang, this disciple wishes to know, if it has nothing to do with Spiritual Strength, what is it?”

“Then respected head judge, magistrates, I’ll embarrass myself by answering.” Heaven Master Yun Yang first greeted the head judge and the magistrates. Although he was a Heaven Master, the Discipline Institute was not under his jurisdiction. The three of them were actually a level higher in terms of status, and to directly respond to such a question would be lacking in manners toward them.

The head judge smiled. “It’s fine. As a Heaven Master, to quench your disciples’ curiosity is natural. We are just bearing witness to this competition.”

Heaven Master Yun Yang nodded and said, “The formation is called the Soul Shrouding Formation. If someone tries to use their divine sense to find the path, it will be suppressed. If the other side resists, in order to prevent the disciple’s soul from crumbling, the formation will suppress their will, making them give up. Thus, when someone attempts to break free of the formation’s spiritual suppression, the formation will automatically suppress their will. So, what you see is the formation attempting to suppress his will. For the formation to start deforming means that Long Chen’s will is extremely powerful. Even with the formation’s suppression, his divine sense is continuing to spread.”

Heaven Master Yun Yang’s explanation left many disciples befuddled. “Heaven Master Yun Yang, disciple will be so bold as to ask a blunt question. What is this will that you are talking about? Whenever I ask any instructors this during their classes, they always give me an ambiguous answer. To tell the truth, I’ve always felt that those classes I bought were scams because of this. Other than that, disciple will be so bold as to ask Heaven Master Yun Yang if the ranks of the instructors can be cleaned up a bit. Many of them are just eating for free and only a few of them actually have skills. I had the fortune to attend one of instructor Long Chen’s classes for free, and I learned so much. But instructor Long Chen is too busy, so he doesn’t have any class slots available. Disciple knows that these words will offend many people, but with the Discipline Institute’s head judge here, disciple feels like only by bringing it up here will there be any effective resolution.”

An uproar exploded amongst the crowd. This disciple’s words were truly sharp. This was practically a public accusation.

They looked at Heaven Master Yun Yang’s response. He wasn’t angry. Instead, he smiled. “Young friend, you spoke very well. The instructor ranks are truly a mix. Quite a few instructors are just there to make up the numbers. Because of it, we will not just have to adjust this, but we’ll have to change the system. For example, free classes that are not bought by the disciples but held by the academy. The instructor exams will also have to become more stringent, with those who don’t fit the ranks being expelled. Young friend, don’t worry. If someone causes trouble for you because of today’s matter, just find me and I will fix it. A youngster should have this kind of courage. You should all try to learn instructor Long Chen’s sharpness. Only once you reveal your sharp light will the academy see you amongst the crowd and have a chance to pick you out.”

“Many thanks… Heaven Master Yun Yang.” That disciple originally only said those words due to his anger at this system. In truth, after he spoke, he grew afraid. But Heaven Master Yun Yang’s promise almost made him sob with emotion.

Everyone felt admiration for Heaven Master Yun Yang’s words. This was a true instructor, modest and receptive. He was on a completely different plane than those instructors who looked down their noses at those who took their classes.

Suddenly, shocked cries rang out. Even Chu Huairen’s expression changed.
