Chapter 3699 Borrowing Someone Spear to Injure Someone

“Who do you think you are to dare to wave a weapon in front of me?! Watch me catch your weapon barehanded!” Long Chen extended his hand toward Long Qinian’s spear just like that.

Seeing this scene, Long Qinian was further incensed. Long Chen didn’t even take out his weapon, clearly looking down on him. As a peak expert of his generation that had defeated countless heavenly geniuses, this kind of disdain made his fury explode.

BOOM!

Dragon marks lit up on his spear. In that instant, the dragon cry resounding throughout the world grew in intensity, and an explosive dragon might shot out.

Long Chen was startled. This person also possessed dragon blood energy? That was unexpected.

“An insignificant trick. You dare to bring out such child’s play? Are you not embarrassed? Take a look at my Unbeatable Dragon Claw! Aiya-”

Long Chen spun, taking on a flashy and cool posture as he reached out for the dragon spear, only to stumble and cry out.

“My waist! I pulled something!”

This stumble of Long Chen’s caused Long Qinian’s spear to shoot right past him. Also, Long Qinian’s momentum was so great that he couldn’t pull it back, and he ended up shooting straight toward the person who was right behind Long Chen, Eunuch Wei.

Eunuch Wei was originally just watching coldly. But when a spear suddenly appeared in front of his chest, his expression completely changed. Everything was happening too quickly, too suddenly.

“Eunuch Wei, watch out!”

Long Chen cried out while he smiled inside.

Eunuch Wei had no time to block. Divine light appeared on his hands, and with a roar, he slammed his hands together over the spearhead.

However, all he was able to do was reduce the speed of the spear. It still pierced his chest. After that, a web of spatial cracks appeared behind him.

“What a bizarre soft energy.” Long Chen was startled inside. This Eunuch Wei had actually transferred the majority of this attack’s power to the space behind him. He himself only endured a very small portion of it.

Considering that he had had no time nor preparation, for him to be able to do so well proved that he was very powerful. Long Chen had actually misjudged. He had underestimated this Eunuch Wei.

Although Eunuch Wei stopped the attack, he still coughed up blood. Long Qinian also took this chance to pull back his spear. He was shocked and enraged to have struck the wrong person. That was far too embarrassing. He was about to speak when Eunuch Wei pointed at him and cursed, “You little bastard, you dare to harm me?! Do you know who I am?!”

Long Qinian was enraged at being cursed, but when he saw the tablet on Eunuch Wei’s waist, his expression twitched. He clearly recognized its origin.

Long Qinian ignored him and turned to Long Chen. “You ignorant junior, I’ll give face to this eunuch today. Next time we meet, I’ll definitely take your head!”

After saying that, Long Qinian fled, not giving Long Chen or Eunuch Wei a chance to curse him.

“Eunuch Wei, you’re amazing! That technique of yours is marvelous. I really admire you. Haha, I truly do!” Long Chen cupped his fists with a sincere expression. But upon seeing Eunuch Wei’s wretched appearance, he couldn’t help himself, and a chuckle escaped him.

“Brat, you did it on purpose!” Eunuch Wei was ashen with rage.

“Eunuch Wei, Long Chen isn’t such a person. Are you injured?” Yu Qingxuan hastily helped Long Chen explain himself.

“Your servant is fine. Thank you for your care, my princess… Cough!” Eunuch Wei ended up coughing up more blood before he was even done talking.

“Although you only suffered a light injury, you should still recuperate. There are not that many people here yet. In a few days, the elites will arrive from various places, and I’ll be counting on you to protect me.” Yu Qingxuan took out a medicinal pill for him.

“Many thanks, your highness. Your servant will go to recover. Princess, be careful.” Eunuch Wei reluctantly received Yu Qingxuan’s medicinal pill.

Long Qinian was an existence that had rivaled Xia Guhong, so his attack couldn’t possibly be so easy to receive. Because of that, Eunuch Wei’s injury was not light. He definitely needed to find a place to recover if he wanted to heal the wound.

“Don’t worry, I will be careful,” promised Yu Qingxuan.

“Other than that, you are the imperial princess. Please take care of the imperial family’s dignity. Pay attention to decorum,” said Eunuch Wei again.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Yu Qingxuan.

Eunuch Wei glared at Long Chen once more. He was no fool. How could he not be aware that Long Chen had conned him? But he didn’t say anything and simply left.

Once Eunuch Wei was gone, Yu Qingxuan and the disciples behind her instantly seemed to relax, as if a heavy burden was lifted from them. It was like they were drowning and finally got a chance to breathe.

“You’re so evil!” Yu Qingxuan couldn’t help rebuking Long Chen when she saw his relieved expression.

“He’s dislikable. To tell the truth, if I wasn’t giving you face, I’d have long since slapped him,” said Long Chen helplessly.

Yu Qingxuan also felt a bit helpless. “To tell the truth, I also dislike him. There are so many more rules when he’s present. But my imperial father sent him, so I can’t drive him away. Hehe, but you’re quite amazing. Now, we can relax for a few days.”

In the end, Yu Qingxuan giggled with a hint of naughtiness. She was also clearly pleased and was happy with the results, if not the means.

Seeing that she wasn’t blaming him, Long Chen smiled. “Speaking of which, why isn’t your master accompanying you?”

“My master didn’t come. Furthermore, this time, I am not representing the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect, but as a representative… a representative of the Vermilion Bird Empire,” said Yu Qingxuan a bit awkwardly.

Yu Qingxuan actually had two statuses. One was the final disciple of the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect’s master, Dongfang Zichu, a peerless heavenly genius of dual pill and flame cultivation. This status of hers was what almost everyone in the major star-fields was aware of.

However, almost no one knew of her other, even more illustrious status. That was the princess of the Vermilion Bird Empire and an heir to the noble Jiuli bloodline.

As a person, Yu Qingxuan was low-key and didn’t like showing off. She would rather live a simple life. Moreover, she was afraid that Long Chen would feel pressure due to her status.

“Hehe, good. Then when I go to the Vermilion Bird Empire, I can just mention your name and be completely unbridled. I can do whatever I want!” laughed Long Chen.

She knew that he was joking. But for him to not react badly to this status of hers, Yu Qingxuan was relieved. She happily said, “If you dare to damage the imperial family’s reputation and my imperial father learns of it, he will definitely break your legs. Let me tell you, my father is very fearful.”

Fearful? He wasn’t afraid. Wasn’t that his future father-in-law? No matter how fearful he was, what could he do? Looking at Yu Qingxuan’s smile, Long Chen also smiled inside.

“This place is very lively. Should we go take a stroll?” Seeing more and more people coming here, with countless people setting up all kinds of stalls, Yu Qingxuan grew excited. There were people as far as the eye could see.

Long Chen naturally didn’t refuse, and he brought Yu Qingxuan into the marketplace. As soon as they were inside, Long Chen was suddenly attracted to a certain thing.
