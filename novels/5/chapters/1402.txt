Chapter 1403 Defeating Gui Yan

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen’s aura began to rise. His robes and hair started to float. Seeing that he was unable to dredge up any valuable information from Gui Yan, he decided not to waste any more time.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, I’ll admit that you defeated me last time. But this time, death is upon you!”

Gui Yan’s expression was indifferent. The blood-colored skeleton beneath him raised its bone club.

“Last time I lost because of your dogshit luck. Your flames just happened to suppress my Ghost General, or you’d have died last time. Are you not curious? My Ghost General was destroyed in our last battle, so how do I have it again now?” Gui Yan smiled.

Long Chen simply stared at Gui Yan without speaking. He had no intention of playing along. What he was saying was to either hurry up and release his fart, or just restrain it already. The battle would start either way.

“Long Chen, by defeating my Ghost General, you half-crippled by cultivation base. But I managed to benefit from that defeat. Speaking of which, I need to thank you. Due to your victory, the Corrupt path suffered such immense losses that countless sects were implicated. To compensate me for my losses, lord Xie Luo gave the resources that should have gone to them to me, allowing me to recreate my Ghost General. Your victory last time was only thanks to some people being careless. Those people were all executed, and I obtained the souls of millions of experts. My Ghost General is no longer a Ghost General - now it’s a Ghost King! Have a taste of its power!”

BOOM!

The blood-colored skeleton’s runes lit up. In truth, each of those runes was a person’s face, and an incredibly evil aura came from it. It was like millions of ghosts were demanding others to join them.

Blood mist filled heaven and earth, making it appear like hell on earth. The wails of ghosts pervaded the air.

“The Ghost General was weak to your Earth Flame, but now I have an unrivaled Ghost King! It’s an unrivaled existence in the same realm!” Gui Yan roared, and the skeleton roared along with him. It looked like a devil from hell.

As the blood mist spread, the Spirit race experts had to retreat. They were filled with loathing for this blood mist, and they didn’t dare to touch it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

At this time, Guo Ran arrived with the flying boat. The Dragonblood Legion joined the battle, and there was no longer any need for the Spirit race experts to fight.

“Are you done bragging? If you are, I’m going to attack.” Long Chen slowly stretched his shoulders. His bones cracked.

He wasn’t even listening. He had heard similar words so many times that they all started to blend into each other. The only reason he was circulating his energy so slowly as a warm-up was because it had been three months since he had fought, and it felt like he was a bit rusty.

During these three months, he had been eating medicinal pills all day. The Divine Gate Star had grown to the size of a soybean. His FengFu, Alioth, Life Fate, and Enlightenment Palace Stars had also gone through a transformation. Even he wasn’t sure what level he had reached right now.

His four qi seas had grown by several times, and his 108,000 stars had been subtly changing as well. He was full of energy.

“I really hate your ignorant way of speaking. Last time, you survived thanks to your dogshit luck. But this time-”

“I’ve gotten tired of your unchanging way of bragging. Can’t you change it up a bit to keep it interesting? Let’s just see who’s stronger!” Long Chen let out a single punch, shaking heaven and earth. He shot toward Gui Yan.

“You’re not fit to be my opponent. Die!” Gui Yan sneered. The giant skeleton’s club came smashing toward Long Chen.

The Spirit race experts were all worried. Long Chen looked completely miniscule when compared to the skeleton.

The Dragonblood warriors who were ‘cleaning up the battlefield’ all looked at him with anticipation. They all felt like it had been a long time since they had seen Long Chen fight.

BOOM!

Space exploded and the earth rocked. A howling tempest tore through the ground. This was a world-shaking collision.

After this fierce exchange, the Spirit race women stared in shock at the sky. Long Chen was still in his punching posture.

As for the skeleton, it had been blown back a hundred miles, its bone club shattered. The skeleton simply lay there as if it was dumbfounded.

“Impossible!” Gui Yan roared furiously, unable to believe this.

“Do you like slapping yourself in the face so much? Alright, I’ll help you.”

Long Chen flew into the sky and then dove down like an eagle after its prey. A cauldron appeared in his hand, smashing toward the skeleton.

“Ghost King Fusion!” Gui Yan had no time to be shocked. He hastily formed hand seals, and he merged into the skeleton’s skull like water. An image of Gui Yan appeared on the skull.

After Gui Yan merged with the Ghost King, nine blood-colored flowers appeared behind it. He was using the Ghost King’s body to summon his manifestation.

Once the manifestation appeared, the skeleton’s shattered club regrew. It now had countless Heavenly Dao runes on it and was much stronger than before.

BOOM!

The club collided with the Blazing Dragon Cauldron.

Terrifying shockwaves spread, tearing apart the land. The Dragonblood warriors hastily defended, and Li Qi summoned a huge earthen shield to protect the Spirit race experts. Once the shockwaves had passed, only a few experts from the Corrupt path were left. Some of them with stronger cultivation bases had managed to escape through luck. The rest had all been slaughtered by the Dragonblood Legion.

After all, the Dragonblood Legion had no weak members. Their cultivation bases had reached the mid Jade Core realm, and they had over three thousand rank eight Celestials. The rest were rank seven Celestials. Such a terrifying legion, when combined with the lead of five rank nine Celestials in Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan, was more than capable of annihilating those Corrupt experts. So what if they had some Life Star experts? They were not even close to being able to stop the Dragonblood Legion.

Since their battle was done, the Dragonblood Legion spread out, forming a huge encirclement that sealed the battlefield. They stared at Long Chen’s fight with rapt attention.

Long Chen was repeatedly smashing the cauldron into the blood-colored skeleton. The Ghost King was definitely powerful, and each time its club collided with the Blazing Dragon Cauldron, the ground would shake violently. This was a pure collision of power with no technique.

After three smashes, Long Chen was still unable to cause any damage to Gui Yan or the Ghost King. Long Chen felt helpless inside. The Blazing Dragon Cauldron might be an Ancestral item, but it wasn’t a fighting item. It also wasn’t heavy enough for him to unleash his true power. It seemed he would need to find a suitable weapon in the future.

“Split the Heavens 5!”

Long Chen suddenly switched the cauldron for a fiery-red sword. Sword-light soared into the air and then slashed toward the Ghost King.

Gui Yan was horrified. In that instant, he felt a cold chill. The skeleton suddenly shrank and coiled around itself, forming a huge sphere. Blood-colored light formed around it, constructing multiple barriers. This was its strongest defensive state.

BOOM!

The sword-light slashed down. A huge explosion caused a bottomless pit to appear in the ground, and the sphere shattered into countless pieces.

In front of the fifth form of Split the Heavens, this defense was too flimsy. Perhaps if Gui Yan had launched an all-out attack instead, he might have been able to receive this blow.

However, Long Chen’s overwhelming power had made him lose confidence, so he had made a foolish mistake. Split the Heavens possessed a natural effect of breaking barriers and shields. By switching to defense, Gui Yan had suffered immensely.

His skeleton shattered, and Gui Yan flew out from one of the fragments, vomiting blood. But Gui Yan was a true expert. As he vomited blood, he quickly formed hand seals. His blood condensed into a huge portal that possessed powerful spatial fluctuations. He was using his own essence blood to build a spatial portal. It was one of his secret life-preserving techniques.

BANG!

His spatial portal had only just formed when a huge wind blade slashed into it, breaking it apart.

It was Tang Wan-er. They all knew that killing a rank nine Celestial was very difficult. They not only had great power but also countless hidden trump cards and karmic luck supporting them. The heavens would create ways for them to escape, which made killing a rank nine Celestial as difficult as defying the heavens.

So Tang Wan-er and the others were all prepared to stop Gui Yan from escaping. Tang Wan-er was also a rank nine Celestial, so their Heavenly Dao energy was equivalent. She was more than capable of breaking his secret art.

Gui Yan hastily took out a talisman, but just as he crushed it, his expression changed.

This precious teleportation talisman was shredded, but no spatial energy came to bring him away. That was because at this moment, he was surrounded by countless wind blades that even cut through the space around him. The disturbance of the spatial energy around him turned his teleportation talisman into scrap paper.

Teleportation talismans were not transportation formations. They needed stable space to activate, or if the space around them was fluctuating, the teleportation talisman wouldn’t have the energy to resist the disturbance.

After failing twice, the delay allowed Long Chen’s sword to come again. This sword was about to take his life.

“Long Chen, you'll regret it if you kill me!” shouted Gui Yan, suddenly taking out a fist-sized emerald.
