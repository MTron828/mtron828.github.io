Chapter 3107 The Chu Family’s Sinister Play

“They truly possessed that kind of power. Just now, when I shattered that protective divine light, I sensed three kinds of energy, but they were not from the same source as Chu Gan’s power. That’s why I’m sure that the four of them have a strange technique to borrow each other’s power. However, I don’t know if their power is the same as myself and Xiaole’s, and can be directly activated through the formation. There’s also the possibility that Silver Moon City already set this up in advance for them to use their technique, telling them the secrets of the formation so that they could cheat,” said Long Chen.

Just now, he had sensed something off. Just as he should be able to easily kill Chu Gan, his attack missed. Thinking back, he found that the Chu family really was slippery.

According to the Chu family’s style, they would always set up a scheme in advance. In that case, it made sense for the Chu family to have set this up, so that the four of them could share their power.

“If they really had that ability, why didn’t they use it earlier? Why wait until Chu Gan was about to die?” asked Lu Mingxuan.

“One reason is because they had confidence that Chu Gan would have enough power to protect himself. The other reason is that I didn’t give them enough time. By the time that they realized that he wouldn’t be enough on his own, they had no time. It must take some time for them to activate their combination technique, so when they realized I was about to kill Chu Gan, they only had time to barely save his life but were unable to turn the tides. The other thing is that this is their killing blow. It might even be for obtaining the champion spot. Just think about it. If all their power merged together at a critical moment, it would be enough to completely change a fight,” said Long Chen.

Luo Xue nodded. “Your assessment is accurate. With our understanding of the Chu family, doing such a thing is definitely in line with the Chu family’s style.”

“They really are sinister. Do they think they can take the champion spot like this?” snorted Bai Shishi. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That’s just one of their wishes. Killing the Luo family’s experts is their primary goal, so I want miss Luo Qing to abandon her match because of this. I almost killed Chu Gan, causing them to lose face. They will definitely do everything they can to kill you in the upcoming battle. If it was a one-against-one and we lost, we could only say that we were weaker. But for it to be four against one, it’s definitely not worth it,” said Long Chen.

Luo Qing smiled slightly. “Many thanks. I understand. I’ll listen to senior apprentice-brother Long Chen.”

Before this explanation, she couldn’t just give up her match. She had to fight for the Luo family’s dignity, and even if she died a hundred times for the Luo family, she would do so without regrets. But it was different after the explanation.

Seeing that she agreed, Long Chen was at ease. The Luo family viewed their family’s glory as more important than their own lives, so he had been afraid of her being stubborn.

“Don’t worry, the Chu family’s people are nothing more than shameless clowns. Putting them in their place is nothing more than a matter of time. There’s no need to rush,” comforted Long Chen.

It was quickly Luo Qing’s turn to fight, but she directly admitted defeat, leaving countless spectators stunned. Considering the Luo family and the Chu family’s relationship, such a thing was bizarre.

That was especially true at the Nine Prefecture Convention, with everyone hoping for the tough opponents to fight each other so that they could gain information on them. Every competitor that had reached this point had information on them, so Luo Qing’s actions were particularly strange for the spectators.

In any case, it infuriated the Chu family. Just as Long Chen had said, Chu Gan’s defeat had resulted in them switching targets to Luo Qing.

However, just as they prepared to crush her, all their preparations went to waste. The Chu family’s people immediately started saying provoking things, but Long Chen and the others ignored them.

The others quickly went through their own matches. Everyone else passed smoothly, but Lu Mingxuan’s luck was bad. She encountered a very powerful opponent, and no matter how she fought, she was unable to beat him. Her opponent had mercy, and Lu Mingxuan could only admit defeat. Seeing her being silent upon returning, Luo Bing and Luo Ning hastily tried to comfort her.

Luo Mingxuan had only come to play around, and she had no intentions of getting a ranking. Hence, after a while of gloom, she returned to her normal self.

Just at this moment, their tablets lit up once more. They had entered the top five hundred. Today’s competition ended here for them.

However, there were still a few more matches to fight. A total of 512 competitors were going to move on to the next round.

Long Chen and the others were sent through since they had obtained the recognition of the martial stage. But some of the competitors still needed to continue fighting for a spot in the top five hundred.

Right now, on Long Chen’s side, there were only Long Chen, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, young master Changchuan, and Luo Xue. The others had already been eliminated.

However, other than Luo Qing, this was within expectation. After all, these experts were truly powerful. Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, and the others had all been mentally prepared for this. Moreover, the results that they had gained were already very satisfactory. They had come here not for the rewards but for the experience.

Having entered the top five hundred, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to watch the remaining fights. He directly returned to his residence.

As for Bai Shishi and the others, they remained to watch. After all, everyone still remaining in the competition was an expert. Every bit they watched was a bit more experience.

Right now, Long Chen was in his room alone and continued studying the World Extermination Lightning Radiance and the Three Flower Pupils. He hadn’t even finished studying his own moves, so why would he go studying other people’s moves during the competition?

His battle with Chu Gan today could count as a warm-up. With the support of his divine ring and the full power of his physical body, things still went very smoothly. He had only used a portion of his dragon scales to suppress his opponent, and this gave him greater confidence.

However, he had to obtain the golden dragon scale. Since there would no longer be any weaklings amongst the remaining competitors, he would have to face them with his full power. There couldn’t be any accidents.

Only by obtaining the golden dragon scale could he raise the power of his physical body to the point that he could freely unleash the power of his divine flames. Having all this power but being unable to unleash it was truly stifling.

As he studied the World Extermination Lightning Radiance and the Three Flower Pupils, he also studied something else. Ever since he had ascended to the immortal world, he had also been studying the nine forms of Split the Heavens.

This technique that had saved him from crisis countless times in the mortal world could no longer be used in the immortal world. The two worlds possessed completely different laws. The Martial Heaven Continent’s laws were incomplete, so it was easy for him to unleash the will to split the heavens.

However, the immortal world’s laws were different. They refused to allow such a will to exist. Long Chen had tried it countless times, only to be injured countless times by the backlash.

But he refused to give up. Recently, he had read an ancient tome in the Divine Scripture Pavilion. With it, he had come up with several possibilities and was currently trying them out. If he could unleash the nine forms of Split the Heavens in the immortal world, perhaps the old man would be able to laugh in the nine springs.

The nine forms of Split the Heavens were not just a Battle Skill to Long Chen. To him, this technique was a memory that he couldn’t bear to part with.

The next day, everyone gathered again. Long Chen had just arrived when countless sharp gazes turned on him.
