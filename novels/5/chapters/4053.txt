Chapter 4042 Unmatched Golden Lotus Seed

As Long Chen smashed the golden lotus seed into the Yan Xu Gate, the golden lotus seed emitted supreme divine might.

In response to this surge of energy, the giant Yan Xu Gate trembled and, to the shock of all present, it exploded along with the colossal hand that emerged from it.

The collapse of the spatial gate resulted in a vast black vortex forming, swirling ominously. However, the divine light radiating from the golden lotus seed illuminated the depths of this dark vortex, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle for all to behold.

Through the vortex, they saw a world engulfed in black flames. Within the sea of black flames, the divine light emanating from the golden lotus seed only illuminated a minuscule portion.

However, within that tiny corner, they saw a long-haired man glaring at Long Chen in fury and shock. Long Chen could see that one of the man's arms was missing, and his shoulder was consumed by golden flames.

“Impossible! Long Chen has killed countless lifeforms! How could he obtain your approval?!?!” roared that man.

That roar came through the vortex but still caused the ten thousand Daos to crumble. Hearing this roar, Long Chen then grunted, and blood suddenly gushed out of his eyes, ears, and nose.

On the battlefield, both allies and enemies were shaken and lost consciousness for a moment. Sharp pain also wracked their souls as if they would be torn apart.

“That is definitely a Heaven Venerate!”

Yu Xiaoyun and the others were shocked. This man was absolutely terrifying.

Despite his terrifying power, he was still injured by Long Chen through space. No, it should be said that he was injured through space by that golden lotus seed.

Long Chen didn’t answer that man. Of course, the golden lotus seed also didn’t answer him. The vortex slowly shrank until it vanished.

…

“Third brother, you…!”

Within an endless sea of black flames where primal chaos qi gushed forth, a startled cry rang out. The speaker was Yan Xu’s eighth son, and the deceased Yan Hong’s big brother, Yan Feng.

As for the man whose arm was gone, he was Yan Xu’s third son, Yan Chang. He was shocked and enraged.

At this moment, the sea of flames beneath his feet erupted, and primal chaos qi rushed toward him. A million-mile sea of flames then wrapped around him.

As those black flames poured into his body, the golden flames on his arm slowly extinguished.

“How can this be?! Even you can’t deal with Long Chen?!” exclaimed Yan Feng.

When Long Chen killed Yan Hong, Yan Feng also attempted to avenge his brother by trying to kill Long Chen. However, Long Chen possessed the protection of the golden lotus seed, rendering Yan Feng powerless to harm him.

So this time, Yan Chang, a formidable Heaven Venerate, took matters into his own hands. But even he ended up losing an arm for nothing.

"It seems that restoring this arm will require several months at the very least," Yan Chang stated gravely.

“What?! Within the sea of primal chaos flames, you still can’t instantly recover?!”

Yan Chang remained silently for a long time before sighing. “I don’t understand. Long Chen is a murderer. How can it have chosen him? It makes no sense. Well, the hell gate is already open. Long Chen probably won’t survive anyway. Let’s just see what happens.”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yan Chang merged into the sea of primal chaos flames. As for Yan Feng, he was stunned for a long time before he also merged into the sea of flames.

…

The vortex vanished, and along with it, the divine light of the golden lotus seed also faded away. Now, it appeared dimmer, having lost its original radiance. It became evident that Long Chen’s act had exhausted all of its energy.

Horrified to see that, he immediately returned it to the primal chaos space. Fortunately, once it was back in the primal chaos space, it returned to its original location, and other than being dimmer, there was nothing wrong with it.

BOOM!

Suddenly, there was an explosive sound, and Long Chen turned to see a black dagger cut through the air, slicing through the ten thousand Daos. A fat head then flew into the air.

“Mingyu!”

That head belonged to the Bloodkill Hall’s master, Enpuda. Dong Mingyu really had cut off his head.

Furthermore, the weapon she had used to do so was not her original dagger, but the divine weapon that Long Chen had given her.

As for Dong Mingyu, despite her paleness and weakened aura, she displayed remarkable composure. Her eyes remained as steady as two stars in the night sky, showing no signs of wavering. Even in the presence of an expert like Enpuda, she remained completely collected and unfazed.

“How unexpected, how truly unexpected. The three thousand six hundred and seventeen attacks at the start were all preparation for your final attack. That steadiness, that patience, that scheming—they were all excellent. My loss was not unjustified.”

Enpuda’s head floated there, the wound on his neck rapidly rotting. But even as his body rotted, he calmly looked at Dong Mingyu.

Within the capital, everyone gaped in utter shock at Dong Mingyu. This seemingly young girl, appearing to be merely thirteen or fourteen years old, had accomplished the unthinkable—she had decapitated the notorious master of the Bloodkill Hall, Enpuda.

Zhu Yifeng, Zhu Yunwen, Yu Qianxue, and the others stood there, their expressions dazed and sluggish, unable to believe what they had just witnessed. They couldn't comprehend how such a tiny figure could possess such terrifying power.

Just then, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others arrived with the Dragonblood warriors. Guo Ran's saber bore the grisly evidence of three corpses still hanging from it—three Empire Lords. Among them was Weng Taibei.

During the intense battle, all eyes were fixated on Long Chen and Dong Mingyu, causing everyone to lose focus on the other battlefield where Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the Dragonblood warriors were fiercely fighting.

But now that the Dragonblood warriors were returning, it was clear that everything was over. They then looked and didn’t find a single living enemy.

The absence of the three-flower Earth Venerates, who were either slain or had fled, signified a great triumph for the Dragonblood warriors. Such a feat would undoubtedly make their names renowned throughout the world. However, despite this remarkable achievement, the expressions of everyone, except Guo Ran, remained indifferent, as though they had merely accomplished something insignificant. This calm demeanor sent shivers through the hearts of onlookers.

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the Dragonblood warriors all stood behind Long Chen. When Yu Qianxue saw that, she couldn’t help but put on a bitter smile.

Any random Dragonblood warrior was actually stronger than them, the princes and princesses of the empire. However, she had actually wanted to gamble on winning the entire Dragonblood Legion? As she reflected on that, she was so embarrassed that she wanted to find a hole to hide herself in.

Zhu Yunwen and the others couldn’t help but sigh in admiration. The Dragonblood warriors were dragons among men. Perhaps only a monster like Long Chen could win their recognition.

“We’ve already determined that when a man is about to die, they talk softly. I don’t know what a crafty, shameless fellow like you will say before your death,” said Dong Mingyu.

Enpuda was reduced to just a head, but Dong Mingyu did not relax. Her starry eyes were still locked onto him.

Enpuda smiled slightly and turned to a certain space.

“I’ve lost and I am fully convinced by it. Ye Wusheng, you can come out.”
