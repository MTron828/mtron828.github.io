Chapter 2541 New Comprehension

This time, Long Chen had gained over eight hundred thousand poison dragon corpses. When the corpses landed in the black soil of the primal chaos space, they were quickly devoured, and the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees began to thrum with life once more.

This allowed Long Chen to relax slightly. It was only with the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees that he could barely use the Six Star Battle Armor. Having this trump card available again made him feel much more at ease.

Although the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had yet to fully recover, it still gave him some confidence.

“Let’s go.” Long Chen led Qi Li and the others away, activating the leaf once more. A rune appeared on his chest, and they were transported to the valley of the wild beasts.

When they arrived, Long Chen couldn’t see Guo Ran and the others anywhere.

“Boss, over here.”

Long Chen finally saw Guo Ran hiding within a pile of rubble and jumped in shock. Guo Ran was covered in blood, and his armor was badly damaged, on the verge of shattering.

“What happened?” asked Long Chen.

“Boss, if you weren’t my boss, I’d really think you were trying to con us. We were attacked by four thirteenth rank beasts at the same time and almost died. If it weren’t for Wilde breaking a golden eagle’s wing, we wouldn’t have been able to run.” Guo Ran almost cried. This was his first time being so unlucky since entering the Star Field Divine World.

“Four thirteenth rank beasts?” Long Chen sucked in a cold breath of air. The Luo Spirit race’s warriors were just as shocked. The fact that Guo Ran, Yue Zifeng, and Wilde had managed to survive such an assault was a testament to how tough their lives were.

Long Chen looked into the distance and saw fresh blood in the valley. There had definitely been a bloody battle, and there were still some corpses left behind.

Countless beasts inside were vigilantly keeping an eye on their surroundings. However, Long Chen didn’t see a single thirteenth rank beast.

Back then, the three of them had joined forces to kill a thirteenth rank beast, but that had drawn out four terrifying beasts from further within.

Yue Zifeng had unleashed his Sword Qi on them repeatedly, but they were too powerful for his Sword Qi to leave any fatal wounds on them. As the battle went on, Yue Zifeng was almost killed by a golden eagle’s wing.

It was fortunate that Wilde was strong enough, and he managed to break the golden eagle’s wing with his door bolt. Only then did the three of them manage to use their speed to escape from the other three beasts.

After escaping, they didn’t dare go back. If they had gone any deeper, they would have been surrounded and probably would have died there. At that time, their lives had truly been hanging by a thread.

The three of them had been waiting here the entire time since then. Now, Wilde was busy eating the thirteenth rank beast that they had killed; his mouth was bloody.

“Boss, this place is too terrifying. Even if they can’t leave the domain of the blue barrier, we can’t deal with them,” said Guo Ran. If four thirteenth rank beasts had come out in an instant, then who knew what was deeper?

“No need to worry. I’ve obtained the good stuff.” Long Chen began to take out house-sized poison sacs filled with black liquid.

“These are the poison dragons’ poison sacs?” Guo Ran cautiously opened one of them, only to find that the poison didn’t have any odor, confusing him.

“Evilmoon said that those poison dragons had spent a long time consuming demonic bugs which strengthened their poison even more than the ones that we fought against before. You just need to turn it into poison mist, and you can instantly poison all of the beasts here. I’ve already tried it, and it was very convenient,” said Long Chen.

Guo Ran took out an arrow and dipped the arrowhead in the poison. When he took it out, the arrowhead had turned pitch-black. The poison had automatically merged into the metal.

“Damn, this really is convenient!” Guo Ran immediately took out a huge number of arrows and tools. After that, he poured the poison into a giant vat, and the Luo Spirit race’s warriors immediately stepped forward to help.

Long Chen warned them all to be careful. This poison was extremely potent. If they were nicked by a poison arrow, it could instantly take their lives.

The Luo Spirit race’s warriors also knew how terrifying these things were, and they were cautiously slow.

With their help, things rapidly progressed. Long Chen then called Guo Ran to turn the poison stingers, poison claws, and poison fangs into tiny bone fragments.

The Luo Spirit race’s arrows were made of wood containing sacred energy that allowed them to easily pierce armor. But those arrows could not be poisoned.

However, these poison stingers, claws, and fangs already had poison in every inch of them. They contained three different kinds of poison, one for pain, one for paralysis, and one for corrosion. If these fragments entered the body of a thirteenth rank beast, the poison would automatically be released. As a result, it was these fragments that were the true killing weapon.

Long Chen had Guo Ran bind those fragments to the wooden arrows. If shot into the body of a beast, then probably even a thirteenth rank beast wouldn’t be able to endure being shot by too many.

As a result, the millions of Luo Spirit race warriors became Long Chen’s most dependable helpers. Guo Ran took charge of the poison bone fragments, while the Luo Spirit race’s warriors quickly poisoned the arrows.

With their immense manpower, they were finished in just half a day. Guo Ran was now confident and ready to charge right back into the valley.

However, just as he was about to charge back in, he suddenly courteously said, “Boss, something as badass as this should be left to you to lead. This little brother will support you from the rear.”

Long Chen curled his lip. Guo Ran was most definitely worried about his broken armor and didn’t want to take the vanguard.

“You can stay with Qi Li and control the tempo of the battlefield. Zifeng, Wilde, and myself are enough.” Long Chen charged into the valley, with Wilde and Yue Zifeng following.

As soon as they entered the valley, countless roars rang out. Those beasts glared at Long Chen through the blue barrier with an ominous light in their eyes. It seemed that they were waiting for him to enter so they could tear him to pieces.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Long Chen swept Evilmoon out horizontally, and a black crescent moon shot out. It quickly grew as it flew through the air. After that, Long Chen followed this crescent moon forward.

“Only now do I understand what the old man meant about the essence of the eighth form. While the blade leaves the body, the soul resides within it. Only then does the attack contain its own soul. I was never able to find that feeling before, but I can sense it easily now. Is it due to the sixth star?” wondered Long Chen.

As the crescent moon left Evilmoon, Long Chen felt a subtle connection between it and his soul. Before this, the eighth form’s attack would have its power constantly ground down as soon as it left the blade. The eighth form was strongest just as it was unleashed.

As it flew through the air, its power began to scatter, and it was impossible to concentrate it. That was a common problem with all Battle Skills.

However, in a battle between experts, who would allow Long Chen to unleash his strongest attack right next to them?

That was why assassins were so terrifying because their power was concentrated and erupted in an instant. Such an attack was the most dangerous.

However, no matter how lethal an attack was, if it couldn’t reach the opponent, it was meaningless. So the most terrifying thing about assassins was not necessarily their attacks, but their ghost-like movement techniques.

Other than the attacks of assassins, other attacks were essentially all large-scale attacks. Once the attack left the body, it would leave the control of the user. This was common knowledge.

However, now Long Chen had gained insight into the old man’s realm. When the eighth form of Split the Heavens left his body, he could merge his soul with it, strengthening it as it passed through the air.

The crescent moon continued growing, and rumbling rang out. It was as if the world was being cut in two.

Guo Ran and Yue Zifeng were dumbfounded to see this. They had seen Long Chen use Split the Heavens many times, but they had never seen such a phenomenon.

The crescent moon was not scattering, but growing stronger and stronger instead. This had already escaped the realm of common sense of Battle Skills and magical arts.

Finally, the crescent moon fell upon those beasts, tearing through the blue barrier.

Those beasts were cut through as easily as tofu, and blood filled the air.

The most shocking thing though was that normally Long Chen’s attack would explode at this moment, but now it continued onward through the beasts.

Long Chen followed his attack; his divine sense still locked onto the giant crescent moon. In that instant, he felt like the ruler of heaven and earth, as if he possessed the power to split heaven and earth, as if all Daos in this world existed for him. It was a feeling he couldn’t explain.

Long Chen focused on his attack as he had to fully comprehend this power. If he couldn’t, then whether or not he could replicate this attack next time would be up to luck.

Countless beasts were cut in two by Long Chen’s attack like wheat being reaped. That sight stunned the Luo Spirit race’s warriors.

“Heavens, as expected of the prophesied son. He only grows stronger and stronger,” exclaimed the Luo Spirit race’s warriors.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They had witnessed Long Chen use the eighth form of Split the Heavens before, but this time his attack was many times stronger.

In just a few days, he had managed to completely transform the same technique. They couldn’t help being stunned by Long Chen’s talent and comprehension ability. His growth rate was astonishing.

The giant blade swept through the entire valley before finally exploding, transforming into a mass of runes. After those runes faded, it revealed a valley empty of beasts.

“Damn, boss is growing more and more monstrous.” Guo Ran was gobsmacked.

Just at this moment, furious roars rang out from the channel at the back of the valley. Countless beasts poured out.

“Boss, be careful! Those four fellows have come out again!” shouted Guo Ran. He saw the four beasts that had almost killed them within that tide of beasts.

“Six Star Battle Armor!”

Six stars lit up within Long Chen’s divine ring and a berserk aura erupted. In the face of a giant rhinoceros, he unleashed a single punch at its head.
