Chapter 2477 I Want To Kill Someone

The sharp arrows pierced through the air so quickly that Long Chen didn’t even have time to dodge. This was a perfectly timed trap.

Despite doing his best, his shoulder and arm were pierced. It was unknown what material they were made of, but they managed to ignore the defenses of his dragon scales.

When his body was pierced, some kind of energy attached to the arrows caused his flesh to begin hardening. It started to transform into black steel.

“Hahaha, little brat, I told you to get out here but you refused. Now even if you kneel and beg for mercy, it won’t work.”

Laughter rang out. The dwarf appeared in front of Long Chen, looking down on him disdainfully.

“Idiot, now that you’ve injured me, even if you kneel and beg for mercy, it won’t work.” Long Chen’s killing intent instantly erupted.

He had been careless. This sneak attack might have pierced his head if he hadn’t been in his peak state with the Azure Dragon Battle Armor active.

Two chunks of metal fell from his wounds. He had never seen this kind of power before, and if his own power wasn’t strong enough to force this strange energy out, it would probably have only taken a few breaths’ time before he turned into a metal statue. If struck in the head, then that would be extremely dangerous.

“Zhao Ritian, Long Chen can count as an ally of the divine families. Don’t go too far. This matter can end here. Long Chen, leave,” said Feng Fei.

“An ally? What a farce. After being away for a few years, have the divine families fallen to the extent of needing allies? Brat, everything here belongs to me, so if you want to leave, hand over whatever treasures you got,” demanded Zhao Ritian. He clearly knew that during the time Long Chen had been gone, it was very likely that he had obtained some treasure.

“Who do you think you are to act arrogant in front of me?” Long Chen stepped forward and unleashed a punch.

“You really are a fool. Do you think you’re qualified to attack me?” Zhao Ritian sneered and also unleashed a punch.

Although Zhao Ritian was short, his punch caused heaven and earth to quiver along with him. Even without his manifestation appearing, specks of light manifested in the air like stars.

His body of flesh and blood instantly transformed into metal. It was a bizarre sight.

Their two fists collided, but the sound was off, sounding more like two metallic fists colliding.

Long Chen’s fist was covered in dragon scales. It was like he was wearing a set of tough gloves.

Zhao Ritian was knocked back a dozen steps, his fist gone. It had been destroyed but no blood flowed out. It was just like a piece of blown-up metal.

“The power of his physical body is enough to break Zhao Ritian’s Million Metal Body?” Feng Fei’s pupils shrank. She was well aware of how powerful Zhao Ritian was. He was born with an innate body of metal. He could control all metal within the world.

His body was no longer flesh and blood but an undying body of metal. Divine items couldn’t break it, but a punch from Long Chen could.

“Hahaha, you’re a bit interesting. Killing you will be fun.” Zhao Ritian looked at his hand that had been blown up and laughed. His metallic body quickly healed, not even leaving a mark where his wound had been.

“Your laughter is really hateful. I feel like I’ve heard it before.” Long Chen stared at Zhao Ritian. Suddenly, he icily asked, “Back in the Immemorial Path, there were four idiots undergoing tribulations. One of them sounded like you.”

Zhao Ritian’s expression instantly changed. Killing intent exploded out of him. “You bastard, that was you?! You ruined our tribulation?! We had to undergo a second tribulation that was unbearably painful to make up for that! Die!” Zhao Ritian furiously attacked.

“So it really was you. Good, then we can settle our old and new enmities together!” Long Chen was also enraged. Those four idiots had almost gotten Yue Xiaoqian killed. He always remembered this enmity.

“Who do you think you are?! I’ll crush you into rotten flesh in an instant!” roared Zhao Ritian. His body exploded with light. Countless runes lit up, turning him into an unstoppable monster made of a million metals.

“Then I’ll crush you into rotten metal.” Long Chen faced Zhao Ritian’s furious charge with his fists.

Runes lit up on Long Chen’s fists. Every punch caused the void to collapse. When they landed on Zhao Ritian, although they no longer caused his body to explode like their first exchange, they still left large dents in his metallic body. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

However, Long Chen’s fists also received repercussions. Zhao Ritian’s body was incredibly hard, even harder than divine items.

Long Chen had just knocked Zhao Ritian back when Zhao Ritian opened his mouth. All of a sudden, his tongue transformed into a sharp sword piercing toward Long Chen’s head. Long Chen hastily twisted his neck, causing the tongue to leave a long cut along his forehead. The wound quickly turned black and began to metalize.

Long Chen grabbed Zhao Ritian’s tongue and then kicked Zhao Ritian’s jaw. Zhao Ritian was kicked away, while half of a sharp sword remained in Long Chen’s hand.

Long Chen wiped his forehead, tearing off the lump of metal that appeared there, before once more charging at Zhao Ritian.

Just at that moment, this space quivered. Several people appeared from multiple directions.

“Long Chen?”

A woman with a bow on her back was startled after seeing the scene before her. She was Beitang Rushuang, and she had entered along with Nangong Zuiyue.

Others had also come at the same time from other directions. Some of them were from the Corrupt path, while some were from neutral powers. However, those people weren’t particularly famous. Most likely, they were rather low-key and liked to conceal their power. If they weren’t strong enough, there was no way they could have reached this point.

“Senior Feng Fei, what is happening here?” asked Nangong Zuiyue. She quickly saw the giant dragon corpse as well as the barrier around the four divine bones. Was this a fight for the treasures?

“This is a personal grievance between the two of them that has nothing to do with others. However, these four divine bones belong to the divine families. All the other treasures are up to your own luck,” said Feng Fei coldly.

Clearly, she was announcing that the main treasure, the four divine bones, was hers. Her tone was quite domineering.

The other experts’ expressions changed as they knew what a divine bone signified. Feng Fei was occupying all four of them with just a word. She had gone too far.

“Are the divine families really going to act like this? Based on what?” demanded someone.

“Based on the fact that we arrived here first,” snorted Feng Fei.

“I got here before you, so why don’t you just scram?” sneered Long Chen as he punched Zhao Ritian back.

Long Chen didn’t have good feelings toward the divine families. Even the peerlessly beautiful Feng Fei had a dislikeable tone.

“A group of ants dare to fight a dragon? If you want the treasures, then bring out your power. If you don’t want to live any longer, why not try to fight against us?” shouted Zhao Ritian arrogantly as he charged back at Long Chen.

As a result, he had just gotten close to Long Chen when he was sent flying back by a kick. The power of this kick created shocking ripples in the void.

“If you want to fight over them, go ahead. But don’t blame me for being merciless at that time,” said Feng Fei icily.

The other experts twitched. They looked at the four divine bones but didn’t dare to go over there.

“Long Chen, do you want our help? The divine families have really gone too far.” Beitang Rushuang sent Long Chen a spiritual message.

Feng Fei and Zhao Ritian’s arrogant and domineering actions had angered her.

“Not yet. You and Miss Nangong should go over to the dragon king’s body and try to comprehend its power. I’m going to test out this dwarf’s power,” replied Long Chen.

A dragon corpse was a treasure in and of itself. Every scale contained its own Dao-charm. Although the dragon king was already dead, the Dao-charm remained. Gaining comprehension from it and corroborating your own Dao from it would be very beneficial.

Nangong Zuiyue looked from Feng Fei to Long Chen and Zhao Ritian. In the end, she chose to walk over to the dragon’s corpse.

Following her, the others also made their moves. But rather than going toward the corpse, they went around the altar in search of other treasures.

Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue trusted Long Chen’s choice. He had to have already explored the surroundings and knew that there was nothing better than the dragon corpse.

“Long Chen, do you only have this little bit of power?” asked Zhao Ritian. The two of them were still fighting with their hands and feet, neither suppressing the other.

“Shouldn’t I be the one saying that? Back in the Immemorial Path, you all acted like heavenly kings, but didn’t you still tuck your tails between your legs and run? Don’t play this kind of game with me. You want me to ask my friends to fight you together so you have a reason to carry out a slaughter? An idiot like you shouldn’t try to play mind games with me,” sneered Long Chen. He forced Zhao Ritian back with a punch and then shook out his hands. A smile gradually appeared on his face. He was coming to grasp what the dragon king had told him about using his dragon blood to fight.

“Hahahaha!”

Suddenly, the space shook once more. An arrogant and wretched laugh rang out.

“I hereby announce that all the treasures here belong to me, Mo Nian! No one can touch them!”

Mo Nian appeared in the air. With his arrival, Long Chen’s aura suddenly explosively grew. His Blood Qi raged within him.

“Mo Nian, cover me. I want to kill someone today.”
