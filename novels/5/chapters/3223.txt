Chapter 3212 Bloodkill Order

Luo Changwu left things in the hands of one of his trusted subordinates. After using the commander tower to investigate the ripples of the devil sea once more, he left with Long Chen and the others.

However, just as they walked out of the commander tower, they saw the Grand Elder walking over with a group of people.

“Grand Elder, why have you come?” Luo Changwu was startled. He had just taken over the Grand Elder’s shift here. Why would the Grand Elder return?

“The family head has ordered me to bring Long Chen back. You are to continue guarding this place. The Chu family has done something to the devil sea, and we cannot be the slightest bit careless right now,” said the Grand Elder.

Luo Changwu nodded. It truly was not good for him to leave the frontlines, but since Long Chen had come to them, it would be rude if he didn’t personally accompany him. It would be as if he didn’t view Long Chen as important enough.

However, it would be appropriate for the Grand Elder to accompany Long Chen instead. Furthermore, it was the family head who had ordered the Grand Elder to receive him. That was naturally to get rid of the grudge between the Grand Elder and Long Chen.

“Then I’ll entrust this matter to you. Long Chen, you can go with the Grand Elder. The family head and the others are also waiting,” said Luo Changwu with a smile.

Long Chen nodded. “Grand Elder, I’m sorry to trouble you. My handling of your grandson’s matter truly wasn’t good enough. I ask that you not take offense.”

Long Chen extended a hand as he walked toward him. “After all, I did not do that intentionally. Let us have this matter end like this.”

His meaning by extending his hand was quite clear. Everyone could shake hands and let the matter rest. Hence, Luo Changwu nodded in praise. Even at such a young age, even in possession of such power, Long Chen didn’t let his arrogance control him. Even though Luo Qingyang’s matter couldn’t be blamed on him, he took the initiative in reconciling, expressing his magnanimity and giving face to the Luo family.

The Grand Elder hesitated slightly, and Luo Changwu said, “Grand Elder, Long Chen has expressed his sincerity. Don’t be so stubborn.”

If the Grand Elder didn’t give Long Chen face, then Long Chen would very likely turn hostile right here. Luo Changwu knew that the Grand Elder was stubborn, but this matter related to the entire Luo family’s honor. He trusted that the Grand Elder would make the correct decision.

As he expected, the Grand Elder also extended his hand. When they locked hands, Luo Changwu sighed with relief.

Just then, as Long Chen held the Grand Elder’s hand, Long Chen’s left hand pierced through the Grand Elder’s chest.

Blood splashed. Everyone was stunned by this sudden turn of events. The Luo family’s experts instantly took out their weapons, their killing intent soaring.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!” Luo Changwu was shocked and enraged. He was unable to understand why Long Chen would want to kill the Grand Elder.

Furthermore, flame runes were flowing on top of Long Chen’s arm. They were still condensed, so the Grand Elder’s life was entirely in Long Chen’s hands. No one dared to make any rash moves.

Everyone was dumbfounded. Luo Bing, Luo Xue, and the others didn’t dare to believe their eyes. Let alone them, even Bai Xiaole and Qin Feng were stunned.

“Why?!” raged the Grand Elder.

Long Chen smiled. That smile had a touch of derision to it. “Why ask when you know the answer? You aren’t the Grand Elder. You’re all fakes.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“What?!”

Hearing that, everyone was even more shocked. Even Luo Changwu was startled. The Grand Elder’s appearance, gaze, and even his spiritual fluctuations were all familiar. How could it be a fake?

Long Chen snickered. “Your imitation is truly amazing. Even your spiritual fluctuations are able to match the real one. Regretfully, fake is fake. There are always flaws. The Grand Elder does have hostility toward me but no killing intent. That’s your fatal mistake. In the lower world, I often fought against your Bloodkill Hall’s assassins, so I’ve seen all your tricks. That hesitation you had over shaking my hand was because you were pondering whether or not to kill me at that moment. The hidden runes on your palm also vanished when you extended your hand. My guess is that you’re a clone, and when you saw the chance, you wanted to kill me, but the true body ordered you to abandon that chance. The clone cannot defy the will of the true body, so you could only accept it. I don’t know if all of what I said is correct, so do you have anything to say?”

The Grand Elder suddenly laughed, “As expected of the existence that the Killing God has issued the Bloodkill Order for. I was seen through.”

The Grand Elder’s words stunned everyone. This Grand Elder really was a fake?

Just then, the figures beside the Grand Elder moved. But a cold light flashed, and those people were cut in two.

Luo Changwu sheathed his sword. Other than Long Chen, no one saw what he had done.

Even Long Chen was stunned inside. The speed of his sword was astonishing. First came his will and then the actual thought. Clearly, Luo Changwu had launched his attack before they even moved. This was a kind of mental lock. As soon as an opponent moved, the body automatically reacted. That was an extremely profound realm.

Furthermore, the moment he attacked, violet light appeared on his sword. That was his bloodline divine ability. Although Luo Changwu hadn’t used much of his Blood Qi, Long Chen still sensed his bloodline pressure. He was definitely a Primal Divine Lord, and an extremely frightening one at that.

Clearly, Luo Changwu was hiding his true power. His expression was extremely ugly at the moment.

“The Bloodkill Hall has gone too far. They really think that the Luo family is easy to bully.”

For the Bloodkill Hall to dare to assassinate people within the Luo family’s territory was already an insult and provocation, but even more importantly, the target was a guest like Long Chen. This was clearly looking down on them. For the assassins to even disguise themselves as the Grand Elder and the others, it was intolerable.

Even with his patience and steadiness, Luo Changwu’s anger flared. He directly killed those people.

“Hahaha, the Bloodkill Hall has issued the Bloodkill Order. All the Bloodkill assassins within the nine heavens and ten lands have their sights on Long Chen. Do you know what the Bloodkill Order signifies? It is the highest glory and honor for the one who accomplishes it. Such a thing has only been issued three times throughout all of history. The one who accomplishes it will receive the Bloodkill Order Badge, and that glory will drive the Killing God’s followers crazy. Do you think they will care about your Luo family, some insignificant descendants of the Violet Blood race?” sneered the fake Grand Elder.

Long Chen indifferently said, “The Bloodkill Order is a bit interesting. But the Bloodkill Hall’s assassins are supposed to be at the same realm as the target and even the level lower. How is there a Divine Lord assassin here? The Bloodkill Hall really is shameless. You clearly don’t really care about honor and glory, but you wish to be claimed as the most glorious and honorable assassins. You have no bottom line. You’ll assassinate anyone with no rules at all but still want to look all elegant and classy. It seems that packing Enpuda’s divine statue with crap was correct. All your heads are full of crap.”

“You blasphemed the Killing God! You will face your retribution sooner or later!” roared that assassin. Clearly, Long Chen's words had stabbed him where it hurt.

When the news of Enpuda’s divine statue being used as a dung pit spread, countless people were dumbfounded. As for Enpuda himself, he was enraged. That was what resulted in the Bloodkill Order.

“If you want to find my true body through this clone, you must be dreaming!” The assassin suddenly roared, and his body rapidly inflated.

BOOM!

Long Chen shoved his arm, and the assassin was thrown into the air. He then exploded.

“Even in death, you have to disgust me. As expected,” sneered Long Chen.

He turned to Luo Changwu. “Senior shouldn’t be angry. The Bloodkill Hall is a group of shameless fellows. Let us go see the family head.”

“Let’s go. We won’t let this matter end like this. The Luo family isn’t an existence that anyone can bully. We’ll report this to the family head.” Luo Changwu took a deep breath and suppressed his fury. He then brought Long Chen and the others away.
