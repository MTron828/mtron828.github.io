Chapter 4439 Silently Profiting

Everything inside the dragon blood domain creaked as it compressed, and the space near it twisted crazily. Unable to see inside the twisted space, the spectators could only rely on their other senses to observe.

“He’s trying to crush Long Chen alive!”

“What a terrifying domain. Even Eternal experts would be unable to move inside.”

Everyone was shocked by this scene. Ordinary experts would be instantly crushed out of existence.

Most terrifying of all, this domain was still compressing around Long Chen’s domain. Long Chen was like a bubble inside a raging sea, and his domain might pop at any moment.

“Tianzhao, remember to capture him alive!” the nether dragon race leader shouted loudly, afraid that Netherdragon Tianzhao was too angry to hold back.

After all, he was eager to find out the origin of Long Chen’s true dragon essence blood. He wanted to know if it really was related to the legendary primal chaos Dragon Sovereign.

“Capture me alive? Based on this little bit of power? Are you joking with me?” sneered Long Chen from inside his golden dragon blood domain.

Facing the overwhelming pressure, the golden domain constantly warped, appearing on the verge of shattering. Despite this, Long Chen maintained a calm expression.

Even now, he was still so arrogant, so many people were wondering whether he was really so calm or if he was putting on an act to cover up his panic.

After being surrounded by such a terrifying domain, anyone would be at an absolute disadvantage and feel afraid. Yet, Long Chen’s demeanor remained disdainful, giving rise to suspicions that his expression was perhaps a false bravado, and he was barely hanging on.

“I want to see how long you can keep up this act,” sneered Netherdragon Tianzhao coldly.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s domain was constantly strengthening, fueled by the burning of his essence blood. Within the domain, black flame dragons proliferated, emitting a scorching heat that seemed to engulf the very heavens and earth. This was his life flame, an existence capable of incinerating all things.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Even after I pointed out that you're a mixed breed, you refuse to accept it. I might not have a lot of dragon blood in me, but it is incomparably pure. To draw a comparison, your power is like a mountain of grass, whereas mine is like refined steel. No matter how much grass you pile on, you can’t crush a steel wire. Although quantity can sometimes make up for quality, your power is clearly inferior. I only have a trace of dragon blood, but even when you use all your power, you can’t break my domain. That, my friend, is the difference between us,” Long Chen remarked with nonchalance.

While his expression was calm, he was overjoyed inside. The increasing intensity of Netherdragon Tianzhao's power acted as a catalyst, accelerating the growth of Long Chen's dragon blood runes.

Those tadpole-like cores grew solid and clear, and millions of them were coursing through Long Chen’s body, akin to millions of active volcanoes moving through him. Once they erupted, they would unleash endless destructive power.

Previously, cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art had been perilous for Long Chen. Even though he managed to succeed in condensing these runes, further improving them would be as difficult as ascending the heavens.

However, today, he found this secret. By using the power of his enemies to stimulate the growth of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, Long Chen wouldn’t need to put in any real effort to grow them. Feeling delighted, he couldn’t possibly let this chance go.

Long Chen continuously provoked Netherdragon Tianzhao, locking him into this competition of dragon blood domains.

“Bullshit! What’s so great about the true dragon race? They’re just a bunch of old fossils! My nether dragon race left the dragon race long ago and formed our own lineage! Our power has long since surpassed the true dragon race! Today, I will show you that the true dragon race’s so-called pure bloodline is nothing more than a joke!” roared Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Alright, then I’m waiting.” Long Chen shrugged indifferently. His apathetic appearance frustrated all the nether dragons.

Long Chen was quite happy. He had initially worried about Netherdragon Tianzhao changing tactics and potentially losing this opportunity. However, he successfully tricked this idiot. For the face of the nether dragon race, Netherdragon Tianzhao couldn’t give up on using his dragon blood domain to crush Long Chen. Furthermore, in his opinion, he was at an absolute advantage.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s domain continued to shrink, causing the entire earth to shake. His domain was clearly growing stronger as it shrank. But at the same time, it came at the cost of further depleting his dragon blood power.

On the other hand, Long Chen’s dragon blood domain was constantly being suppressed. Like a bubble in the wind, it looked like it would pop at any moment. However, even after so long, it didn’t pop.

When it came to his art of provocation, no one would believe Long Chen if he said it was inferior to his combat skills. Every word he uttered stabbed the nether dragon race in the most painful spot. Now, all the nether dragon race’s experts wanted to tear Long Chen apart.

Time passed bit by bit.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s dragon blood domain had shrunk to the point that it could crush budding Doyens to bits in an instant. However, Long Chen’s dragon blood domain continued to remain there, looking like it would explode, but not really.

Now, people started to feel that something was off. The nether dragon race’s people were also getting suspicious, gradually smelling a scheme.

Long Chen was only defending the entire time. Was he trying to exhaust Netherdragon Tianzhao’s energy? Just what kind of scheme did he have up his sleeves?

“Netherdragon Tianzhao, you should just give up. Your blood is so mixed and impure that you can’t do anything to me. How about I take back what I said? I won’t say that you’re a mixed breed anymore. I admit that you are your dad’s son, and no one helped you. Let’s stop this senseless competition, and we can fight seriously with our real skills instead. How’s that?” Seeing that Netherdragon Tianzhao seemed to have sensed something, Long Chen immediately spoke up solemnly.

“Keep dreaming!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, and his hand seals changed. His dragon blood domain once more compressed upon Long Chen.
