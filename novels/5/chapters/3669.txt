Chapter 3658

However, this Ji Wuying looked colder and more reserved than the other Ji Wuying. His eyes were like those of a devil. Within this dark palace, they emitted a spectral light that would give others chills.

Those eyes did not appear to be the eyes of a human. They were like those of a wild beast, filled with a thirst to kill as if he lived to kill.

Enpuda smiled and nodded. “Excellent. Your little brother’s talent has finally been reclaimed by you. You should thank Long Chen.”

“I will surely thank him. I’ll use my brother’s hand to kill him and express how grateful I am.” That man also smiled.

These two were twin brothers. They appeared almost identical. However, the one that Guo Ran had killed was called Ji Wuying, while this one was called Ji Wuming.[1]

The latter didn’t have the slightest grief over his brother’s death. Instead, he was gratified.

“Let me see your hands,” said Enpuda.

Ji Wuming extended his hands. Both of his palms were covered in Heavenly Dao runes, emitting boundless power. Most importantly, there seemed to be some connection between his hands.

“Good, very good! Your Ji family’s bloodline inheritance can only be perfectly displayed by your hands. Your Supreme Bone can control time, but now your other hand can control space. When you become an Immortal King, your Supreme Bones will undergo a heaven-toppling transformation. At that time, you will no longer have any rivals within the same realm. For you to be able to control spacetime, I, Enpuda, have finally obtained a successor worthy of carrying on my legacy. When I pass down my full faith energy to you as well, I’ll watch as you sweep through everyone in this era. You will turn the Bloodkill Hall into a legend of the assassin world.” Enpuda laughed delightedly when he looked at Ji Wuming’s hands.

“It’s all thanks to master that I could reach this point.” Ji Wuming knelt reverently.

“There’s no need for courteous words between master and disciple. I, Enpuda, have no child or heir. You are my only disciple. You are like my son, so what is mine is yours. However, even if you can control both Supreme Bones, don’t get too careless. You need to keep working hard. Once you reach master’s realm, you can assist the Divine Venerate in his important affairs,” said Enpuda, feeling gratified.

“Master, your disciple will become a World King soon and then a Divine Venerate. Why must you serve others? Wouldn’t it be better to be king? When the time comes-”

“Silence!”

Enpuda’s joyful expression instantly changed. He roared so loudly that the palace quivered. As a result, divine might raged and faith energy gushed out angrily. Ji Wuming was forced to kneel by a terrifying pressure. He couldn’t move and was horrified.

“You cannot be disrespectful to Divine Venerate Brahma at any time. Otherwise, even if you are my most beloved disciple, I will kill you!” shouted Enpuda.

“Yes, yes, disciple understands his mistake!” Ji Wuming began to sweat. He kowtowed piously.

Only then did Enpuda retract his aura. Ji Wuming was terrified inside. At that moment, he finally experienced just how terrifying of an existence his master was. In front of Enpuda, he was like an ant.

He had previously managed to kill a half-step Divine Venerate, and now he had even obtained Ji Wuying’s Supreme Bone. With both Supreme Bones awakening, his confidence instantly soared. He had even felt that his current power might not be inferior to his master’s.

However, his newfound confidence was instantly shattered. Enpuda hadn’t even attacked, but just his aura already made him unable to move. Killing him required nothing more than a thought for Enpuda.

Seeing Ji Wuming quivering and kneeling, Enpuda’s expression softened. He then patted Ji Wuming’s shoulder.

“Child, remember, you should never form the thought of betraying Divine Venerate Brahma. He is a mighty and great person who cannot be blasphemed. The reason you could even think of such a thing is because your ego has inflated too much. But a frog in a well cannot speak of the ocean. I will put it frankly to you. The current you is just like a frog at the bottom of a well. Let us not talk of Divine Venerate Brahma; even in the same realm, there are many people that you cannot fight right now. You need more tempering. Your arrogance shows that you are still young. However, many people will only ever be young in their lifetime due to that arrogance. They won’t get a chance to grow up.”

“Disciple will remember master’s teachings,” promised Ji Wuming, his head lowered.

Enpuda looked at him. “Why are you hesitating? Say what you want to say. As long as it doesn’t offend Lord Brahma, it’s fine.”

Ji Wuming raised his head and nervously said, “Compared to Divine Venerate Brahma and master, disciple is naturally a frog at the bottom of a well. The light of a firefly doesn’t dare to compete with the moonlight. But you say that there are many people that I cannot match in the same realm? Disciple… disciple doesn’t quite believe it. Are you saying that I am still not a match for Long Chen?”

Enpuda was silent for a moment. “Long Chen didn’t fight in the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. But his aura is heavier than before. It was only through an ordinary photographic jade, so it’s difficult for me to judge his current strength. You have a pair of Supreme Bones now. Although you can only control a trace of their space and time energy, you have mastered seventy percent of my assassination arts. I feel like if you were to fight, you would be relatively even. Victory or defeat would likely depend on luck.”

“How can that be? Is Long Chen really so powerful? He’s nothing more than an ascender from the lower plane. He has no foundation and has to fight for every bit that he obtains. As for myself, my Ji family is one of the immemorial divine families. I am also the disciple with the purest bloodline. With my family’s foundation and your teachings, I’ve worked day and night at my cultivation. I’ve never slacked off. And even then, I can only barely match him?” asked Ji Wuming, unable to accept this.

It had to be known that Long Chen came from the lower plane. The lower plane’s spiritual qi, resources, inheritances, and other conditions were all inferior to the immortal world’s. To say that Ji Wuming was only a match for Long Chen, wasn’t that calling him trash?

“Long Chen is a variant. Let alone you, even I cannot see through him. But when I said that there were others in the same realm who could beat you, I wasn’t talking about Long Chen. I was talking about Dong Mingyu.”

Suddenly, Enpuda pulled off the clothing on his chest, revealing a terrible wound. Ji Wuming cried out in shock.

“Master, you…!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
