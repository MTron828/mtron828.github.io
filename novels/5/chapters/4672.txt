Chapter 4661 Leading the Heavenly Tribulation

“Hahaha, you idiot! The time hasn’t come yet, but you already made your breakthrough! The heavenly tribulation won’t come, and you’ll never reach the Divine Venerate realm, haha!” Yan Tianhua laughed crazily.

When Long Chen shattered the last barrier stopping him from advancing, Yu Zihao, Gengjian, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yin Jiushang, Luo Changsheng, and the others also laughed at Long Chen like he was an idiot.

All of them released an aura on the verge of breaking through but hadn’t broken the final barrier precisely because they were waiting for the right time.

Even Yan Tianhua had only relied on a special bloodline divine ability to devour other people’s heavenly tribulations; he hadn’t truly initiated his own tribulation. By gathering the tribulations of others, his lightning sphere had grown several times larger than those of his peers, making him the most prominent figure present.

The giant swirling tribulation cloud covering their heads had yet to reach full power and was still spinning. Before it reached its peak state, they wouldn’t start their tribulations.

Starting their tribulation now was futile; it wouldn't trigger any reaction from the spinning tribulation cloud. In such a case, it would be deemed a failure, effectively marking the end of their journey.

Hence, none of them had expected Long Chen to succumb to his anger and actually do something so foolish. They erupted into joyful laughter, only for their mirth to be abruptly halted by a terrifying rumble. They were stunned to witness the massive tribulation cloud in the sky suddenly cease its rotation.

“How can this be?!” Yu Zihao howled.

“There should at least be two more days before the tribulation cloud stops spinning!” Gengjian also cried out.

Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yin Jiushang, and Luo Changsheng were also taken aback. This was beyond all their expectations.

“Did the tribulation cloud stop spinning because of him?” Netherdragon Tianzhao muttered, his voice tinged with disbelief. Shock etched across his face, gradually giving way to a creeping sense of jealousy. After that, an uneasy emotion simmered inside of him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a pillar of light exploded out of Long Chen and soared into the giant vortex, tearing a giant hole into it.

When this hole appeared, lightning came flooding out like a breach in a dam, and a waterfall of lightning instantly submerged Long Chen, causing the other people’s expressions to change.

Realizing that they couldn’t tarry any longer, they directly broke through the final shackles of their realm as well. The next moment, pillars of light soared into the sky, blasting many holes in the tribulation cloud.

The holes they made were all similar to Long Chen’s, showing that these people were all powerful monsters.

BOOM!

Just then, a particularly powerful explosion erupted, and a colossal rift tore through the center of the tribulation cloud vortex, dwarfing even the one created by Long Chen. All eyes turned to the source of the explosion—Yan Tianhua.

Immediately, cheers rang out from the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race’s camp. “Young Master Tianhua is the strongest!”

“Hahaha!” Yan Tianhua laughed. “I am the true chosen one of the heavens! The gate to the ninth heaven will be opened by me and me alone! I will lead the transformation of this world, hahaha!”

By devouring countless people’s tribulations, Yan Tianhua had a natural advantage over everyone else here.

The expressions of the others shifted as they witnessed Yan Tianhua’s actions. Initially, they had looked down upon his method, deeming it as blatant cheating. By manipulating the Heavenly Daos, he was defying the natural order, and it seemed inevitable that he would face divine retribution. However, his feat instantly created a gap between them.

“The heavenly tribulation has started, but the gate to the ninth heaven still has yet to appear. That shows that you aren’t the chosen one,” sneered someone else.

It was like a bucket of ice water over Yan Tianhua’s head, extinguishing his excitement. He then looked around, and indeed, the legendary gate to the ninth heaven was nowhere to be seen.

“That’s impossible! My tribulation is the strongest! I am the chosen one! The pathway to the ninth heaven can only be opened by me! The karmic luck of the ninth heaven is mine!” roared Yan Tianhua.

“Everyone, it seems there’s a problem since the tribulation started early. Perhaps we should kill him and see if something changes,” suggested someone within the tribulation.

At that moment, countless gazes turned toward Yan Tianhua, and he sneered. “If you’re not afraid of dying, come. The Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race shall reclaim its former glory.”

A giant black-python manifestation appeared behind Yan Tianhua. When it materialized, a rock-like armor covered him, causing his aura to grow dark and sinister, like he was a viper that would launch a fatal blow at any moment.

Suddenly, cracks resounded through the air, prompting everyone to hastily search for the source of the disturbance. Their shock was obvious as their gazes fixed upon the sky.

“What?!”

Cracks had appeared in the hole above Long Chen, spreading out in the vortex.

The tribulation cloud was like a layer of ice, and while everyone else had managed to pierce a hole into it, that was it. Long Chen’s hole was the only one that seemed to gush out with so much power, as if the hole wasn’t big enough, causing the tribulation cloud to crack.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the hole above Long Chen’s head collapsed, and even more lightning came crashing down on him. The amount was dozens of times greater than before, stunning everyone.

Following that, the sound of cracking intensified as the collapsed hole expanded further. Similar to the breach in a dam made of sand and dirt, the opening continued to widen as torrents of energy surged through it, causing the tribulation cloud to break over and over again.

The hole quickly grew to the point that Yan Tianhua’s hole simply couldn’t even compare to Long Chen’s. What astonished everyone the most was that the breach showed no signs of halting its expansion; it continued to grow exponentially with unstoppable force.

“Impossible!”

Seeing this scene, Yan Tianhua let out a resounding roar and took out a serpentine bone whip. With a swift motion, the whip stiffened and transformed into a sword, thrusting into the sky with formidable force.

BOOM!

It pierced straight through the tribulation cloud above him, widening his original hole.

Yan Tianhua was delighted as he realized that it was actually possible to widen the tribulation hole. With this discovery, he charged up and started to attack the tribulation cloud, widening his hole. He quickly managed to make it grow by several times.

The others followed suit and started to attack the heavenly tribulation, pleasantly surprised that this method worked.

Yan Tianhua was working hard at expanding his tribulation hole and wanted to keep his advantage. However, when he glanced over at Long Chen, his heart directly turned ice-cold.

Long Chen wasn’t even doing anything, but the tribulation cloud above him had fully collapsed. The cracks emanating from the breach extended beyond the horizon, surpassing anything seen before.

“How is this possible?!”

Filled with shock and rage, Yan Tianhua did his best to attack his hole, wanting to catch up to Long Chen. However, the disparity between them was so vast that he felt a sense of despair creeping in.

“Die!” Yan Tianhua roared and suddenly swung his bone whip straight at Long Chen, ignoring the distance.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
