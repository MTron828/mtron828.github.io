Chapter 2633 Forcibly Charging Through

Long Chen was going to charge through the defense created by the devil race’s army composed of millions and millions of experts by himself? There were multiple mid Heaven Merging existences amongst them! Moreover, there were uncountable early Heaven Merging devils, and as many Netherpassage experts as hairs on a bull. Such a formation would kill anyone.

Hearing his command, not only were the divine families and the Martial Heaven Continent’s warriors stunned, but even the Dragonblood warriors were stunned as well.

However, they listened to his orders. They slowly retreated while keeping an eye on Long Chen.

When Long Chen was still many miles from the exit, he suddenly let out a thunderous roar.

“Divine ring! Battle armor!”

Long Chen’s aura exploded. He was like a blazing star charging into the devil race’s army.

“Ignorant human imp, you won’t be able to escape,” sneered a mid Heaven Merging expert.

Over thirty mid Heaven Merging devils had formed a row in front of Long Chen. Behind them was a mass of early Heaven Merging devils that were like a net, and further back was a wall made of millions of devil experts.

Such a formation was something that not even a mosquito would be able to fly through.

“What a joke. Why would I run? You look pretty big, so you should have quite a bit of meat. My brother will definitely be happy.”

Long Chen looked at their leader. He was three hundred meters tall and had bulging muscles all over his body. He was definitely a power-type existence. Wilde liked this kind of food the best.

“You dare to say such arrogant words with death close at hand. The human race really is foolish,” sneered that mid Heaven Merging expert. He didn’t seem angry.

That was because the boss of the devil race had already sent out orders to stop him. They could not permit him to escape, or everyone guarding the exit would be executed.

The devil race had never given such harsh orders, so they had no choice but to be cautious. Seeing Long Chen, this devil expert felt like he could crush him with a single palm. However, he didn’t act carelessly.

To be absolutely sure, they focused only on blocking this path. As long as he couldn’t get past them, it would be their victory. They didn’t have any intention of killing him personally.

“With death close at hand? Well said. It seems that you know yourself quite well.” Long Chen laughed. In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, he really charged at that mid Heaven Merging devil expert just like that.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s side couldn’t see him directly, but they had a formation that gave them a line of sight into what was happening. Hence, seeing Long Chen charging like that, people couldn’t help letting out startled cries.

They had originally thought that Long Chen had said such words to get them angry and then use some technique to get by, for example poison, fire, or lightning. By creating chaos, he might be able to escape.

However, it seemed that Long Chen wasn’t doing any of that. He was just charging forward without any technique.

The leader snorted. He didn’t budge, refusing to create an opening in their formation. After that, he unleashed a single fist.

However, at this moment, a bronze fragment appeared above Long Chen’s head. A wave of light spread from it.

In that instant, the Martial Heaven Continent’s laws poured into Devil Spirit Mountain and enveloped Long Chen. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen unleashed a single punch as well, facing the mid Heaven Merging expert directly.

BOOM!

Even before the two fists could meet, astral winds had clashed and exploded. Shockingly, the mid Heaven Merging expert was knocked several steps back. As for the ones behind him, they were sent flying, all of them coughing up blood.

“Amazing!” Long Chen was delighted inside. When the Eastern Wasteland Bell’s rune was activated, although their Blood Qi was unaffected, these devil experts had their auras drop all the way to the Netherpassage realm.

After that, Evilmoon appeared in his hand, and with a single slash, a head flew into the sky. Black blood rained down.

“What?!”

Let alone Feng Fei and Ye Lingshan, even Meng Qi and the others were shocked. Just when had Long Chen become so powerful? They had retreated from the battlefield and were unable to sense that within the divine light, the mid Heaven Merging expert’s aura had suddenly changed.

“Those who block me will die!”

With new confidence, Long Chen roared and attacked again. Another mid Heaven Merging expert was cut in two along with their weapon.

“Am I dreaming?” Guo Ran couldn’t believe his eyes. Those were mid Heaven Merging experts!

Back then, the entire Dragonblood Legion working together had been forced to retreat. It was only thanks to a lucky stroke from Wilde that they had managed to kill him.

However, such terrifying existences were being cut down one by one? Had the world gone mad?

Long Chen suddenly swept out with his blade. Saber-light slashed out of Evilmoon, cutting the world in two.

Countless corpses then flew through the air. A crack finally appeared in the wall, revealing Long Chen.

Over ten of the mid Heaven Merging experts were killed by this single strike from Long Chen. As for the rest, they began to collapse. At some point, a small bloody hole appeared in their heads. No one saw how they died.

Their absolute defense was finally broken. Long Chen then charged over to the Martial Heaven Continent’s side, and he even had time to gather the mid Heaven Merging experts’ corpses.

Just as he was about to reach the Martial Heaven Continent and the Dragonblood warriors were cheering fiercely, a large hand stretched out from the depths of Devil Spirit Mountain.

When that hand appeared, endless devil qi filled the air. Space and time froze. Long Chen felt everything come to a stop.

“Not good. A late Heaven Merging expert.” Long Chen’s expression changed. This fellow had arrived shockingly fast, attacking right after the rune from the fragment of the Eastern Wasteland Bell was completely used up. Everything had been going smoothly before this hand appeared.

Moreover, this was the hand that had interrupted Long Chen’s transportation. Now that it reappeared, the experts on the Martial Heaven Continent’s side felt like their souls were being squeezed, as if a bit more force would cause their souls to explode.

This was a level of power that brought despair. The difference between them was simply too great.

Long Chen suddenly grabbed Dong Mingyu, who had been forced out of the void, and threw her out of Devil Spirit Mountain.

“Big brother Long Chen!”

Dong Mingyu let out a startled cry. She knew that Long Chen was unable to dodge in this state, so he could only face this terrifying hand directly. But how could he receive this attack?
