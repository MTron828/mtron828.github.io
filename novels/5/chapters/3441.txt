Chapter 3430 Ancient Corpses of the Ghost Ship

Sinister ghost qi filled the world as though the gates of hell had opened. Following that, countless corpses in ancient clothes appeared, their bodies almost eroded to nothing.

When Long Chen saw those figures, his heart pounded wildly. Weren’t those the ancient corpses that he had seen on the Ghost Ship when crossing the devil sea? Was this because of karma? Was this karma also included in his tribulation?

Legend had it that those that saw a Ghost Ship had ill fortune befall them, but Long Chen had actually gone onto a Ghost Ship. Because of it, now the Ghost Ship’s ancient corpses appeared in his heavenly tribulation.

Long Chen was shocked, but everyone else was even more shocked. How could ancient corpses appear in a heavenly tribulation? Furthermore, these corpses possessed sinister ghost qi. That was not in accordance with the Heavenly Daos, no?

“Shrink the encirclement and fight them together!”

This expert had just shouted when those ancient corpses came flying out of the lightning gates with their weapons, attacking.

BOOM!Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

An expert of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race was the first to strike them. As a result, he was simply sent flying by a stroke of the ancient corpse’s sword.

After that, another sword from an ancient corpse swept out, breaking the void and cutting that expert of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race in two.

“What?!”

Everyone was shocked. That person was a first-rate expert. Although he couldn’t compare to the eighth prince, he still had a certain amount of prestige within the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. No one had expected him to be slain in an instant.

These ancient corpses’ attacks were sharp, and they still had their techniques from when they were alive. In his carelessness, that expert was instantly killed.

The ancient corpses killed everyone on sight. Moreover, all of them seemed to be experienced warriors with refined skills. In just the first exchange, a wave of the demonic beast race’s experts collapsed.

The eighth prince, Wu Ying, and the others’ expressions finally changed. Before this, they didn’t care about the deaths of those people. One reason was that the ones dying were from the weaker demonic beast races. The other reason was it was simply the natural elimination of the weak. It wasn’t a big deal to them. After the dirt was washed away, it would leave only the gold.

However, it was different now. The attack power of these ancient corpses was terrifying. If they still didn’t interfere, these elite disciples would also be slain.

“Other than the sixteen of us, everyone else, go deal with them!” shouted the eighth prince.

Thousands of experts had been eyeing Long Chen and preparing to test their luck.

However, the situation had changed and the eighth prince had even given them an order. So, they helplessly turned to the ancient corpses.

These thousands of experts were very powerful existences. But when they started fighting these ancient corpses, they were shocked to find that the latter was even stronger than they had expected. Their experienced techniques couldn’t be broken.

Even with them joining in, countless experts continued to be slain. As a result, the number of people at the core rapidly fell. As for the four lightning gates, they were still open, and more ancient corpses continued to come out. They seemed endless.

In the distance, Lei Yuner also ran into danger. Fortunately, they were at the very edge, and there were far fewer ancient corpses here. With Lei Yuner personally dealing with them, things were still manageable.

When those ancient corpses were slain, they also transformed into multicolored lightning runes. Moreover, when the runes fell onto Lei Yuner, she sensed her physical body growing in power crazily. Due to this, she began fighting even harder.

The experts behind her also benefited from her. They did their best to absorb those runes to strengthen themselves.

Suddenly, one of them coughed up blood, and cracks appeared throughout his body. He had reached his limit. If he continued to absorb more lightning runes, his body would explode.

“Princess, thank you for everything. My Swifts race swears to follow the Lightning Falcon race to the death.” That expert immediately retreated after reaching his limit.

After going outside of the range of the tribulation, his aura suddenly grew explosively. He finally finished advancing to the Divine Lord realm. At that moment, a light flashed out of his tablet, enveloping him and bringing him away.

Once a person finished advancing to the Divine Lord realm in the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, their tablets would automatically activate and bring them out.

These people’s tribulations had all been absorbed by Long Chen. Hence, only once they left his tribulation would the Heavenly Daos silently accept that they had finished undergoing tribulation.

Following that one person, more and more experts of the flying beast race thanked Lei Yuner and left, having reached their limit.

They were extremely grateful to her. If she hadn’t summoned them here, they would have all died within the heavenly tribulation.

Seeing those famous experts at the core being slain in droves by the ancient corpses, they knew that their lives had been given to them by Lei Yuner.

Not only could they keep their lives, but their physical bodies had also been strengthened to the limit. This was a huge opportunity that had changed their fates.

In just a few breaths’ time, only a few thousand people remained by Lei Yuner’s side. The runes that came from killing the ancient corpses were so powerful that just absorbing a few was enough for these experts to reach their limits.

Fortunately, these thousands of experts were all elites, so they continued to absorb a few more runes. In just a bit, Ying Bokong also reached his limit. And just like everyone else, he wanted to absorb a bit more, only to cough up blood.

He helplessly left, knowing that his potential couldn’t compare to Lei Yuner’s. He was about the same as the other experts.

More and more people continued to leave. Lei Yuner was killing so many ancient corpses that they quickly reached their limits. After thanking Lei Yuner, they left.

In the end, only Lei Yuner was left. After that, with a laugh, she charged into the core.

The flying beast race’s experts reappeared in the plaza. Thereafter, the senior experts of the demonic beast race cried out in shock when they saw them in person.

These disciples that had just finished their tribulations were shockingly powerful now. Their auras and physical bodies were several times stronger than previous generations who came out of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. No one could believe it. This enormous heavenly tribulation could completely transform a person.

All the flying beast race’s senior experts were in high spirits upon seeing their descendants return with such powerful auras. These old fellows almost started dancing in excitement.

The heart of the Lightning Falcon race’s leader was pounding emotionally as he stared at the hundreds of thousands of new elites of his Lightning Falcon race. Their race had truly profited this time, so he felt like he had wrongly blamed Long Chen.

However, he was quite smart to not express too much joy. He also cast a glance at the other old fellows of the demonic beast races.

Other than their flying beast race, all the other old fellows in the plaza had dark expressions. Their disciples were either dead or bitterly hanging on inside of the tribulation. Cheering at this time wasn’t very appropriate.

Hence, some of the old fellows hastily suppressed their emotions, as well as told their people to calm down. After that, they all stared into the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.

There were endless ancient corpses and fewer and fewer demonic beasts inside. They numbered only a tenth now and were still falling, unable to stop the terrifying army of ancient corpses.

Standing at the very center of the heavenly tribulation, Long Chen didn’t have the slightest speck of lightning around him. After staring at the eighth prince and the others, he finally smiled mockingly.

“Even if you throw your lives away to protect me, I won’t thank you.”
