Chapter 2748 A Blood Debt Must be Paid in Blood

Beheading was a humiliating form of death. In the secular world, it was only used for those who had committed the most heinous crimes or against those with deep enmities. They would make sure that the dead didn’t have a complete corpse.

On the other hand, in the cultivation world, dying without a complete corpse was common. One person could kill the other with a single punch, blasting them to pieces. But to intentionally behead someone wasn’t very commonly seen. Without a certain level of hatred, no one would use such a method.

However, today, Long Chen did it. He had thousands of ways to kill the Lord Saint, but he chose this way.

“Long Chen…!”

The divine families’ experts roared furiously. Long Chen had beheaded the Lord Saint in front of all of them. That was a huge insult. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Long Aotian’s spear trembled, but he didn’t move. That was because his mother was still in Long Chen’s hands. He was dragging her like a dead dog.

Long Aotian clenched his teeth, but he didn’t have any method. No carrot or stick would work on Long Chen. No one could change his mind on what he had decided, not even a god.

Furthermore, Long Chen was a madman. No one could tell what a madman would do. After escaping his prison, instead of fleeing, he actually came directly to the core of the divine families to cause a ruckus. Even though the experts of the other worlds were also rushing over, Long Chen seemed not to care.

Long Aotian wanted to save his mother. While he was relatively indifferent to his father, he depended on his mother. His current achievements today were all thanks to her. It could be said that his path in life had been personally paved by her.

That included his path in the future, which involved ascending to a higher plane. His mother had arranged all of it. All her hopes were on him, and she showed her love to him in a hundred different ways.

Long Aotian almost broke down several times and charged out, but knowing that Long Chen could kill her with just a thought, he didn’t move.

“Long Chen, what do you want to release my mother?!” demanded Long Aotian.

“You want me to release your mother? That’s easy. As long as you hand over what you owe me, I’ll give her to you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“That’s impossible. I would become a cripple!” raged Long Aotian.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed before his face suddenly became harsh. “So even for an adult like you, taking your Spirit Root, Spirit Blood, and Spirit Bone would be crippling? So how did your side manage to do that to me when I was just a baby? Now you want me to let your mother off? Did she ever think about letting me or my entire family off?”

The divine families’ outer experts were in an uproar over hearing Long Aotian personally admit to this. They couldn’t help being disappointed. While they could mostly guess what had happened back then, it was hard to hear that their greatest genius was only a genius due to stealing from Long Chen. On the other hand, even after being crippled, Long Chen had still reached the peak of the martial path.

A crippled person who had fallen to a small secular nation and had been forced to fight for every scrap of resources he could get, versus someone in the divine families who had resources thrown at him and got everything he wanted.

The two of them were worlds apart. But which one was the true expert? It was someone who had their wings clipped and still soared through the heavens!

“In this world, reasons and logic cannot be found through discussion. Some people will only understand what pain is when they themselves are beaten. Foolish people will only understand what it means to respect others at that time. All of you have seen others in pain, so you can enjoy watching them suffer. Today, I’ll let you taste what that feels like.”

Long Chen turned to Long Aotian’s mother. “You evil bitch. You were the main ringleader in all this. My family was destroyed by you. Normally, I’d rip off your skin, tear out your tendons, and grind your bones to dust, but I disdain doing such a thing to a woman. Instead, I let you run, let you see hope. But what I want you to experience is seeing hope right up ahead and not being able to grasp it. Today, even if a god descends, they won’t be able to save your life. Today, I will give you your final judgment for what you did that day.”

Long Chen suddenly twisted his hand, and her Yuan Spirit was pulled out of her body. At that moment, flames burst into existence, burning her Yuan Spirit.

“AHH!”

Long Aotian’s mother screamed. This was a torture that not even the Heaven Executioner had been able to bear, let alone her.

“Long Chen!” Long Aotian roared furiously. He knew that Long Chen was dead set on killing his mother, but he was unable to save her. All he could do was kill Long Chen as vengeance for her.

Pressed to his limit, Long Aotian furiously attacked, his dragon spear stabbing toward Long Chen.

Long Chen snorted and threw the Yuan Spirit in his hand toward the tip of the spear.

“No!” Long Aotian’s mother let out a sharp screech. Long Chen was so hateful that he wanted her to die to her own son’s hands.

Long Aotian seemed to know that Long Chen would do this. Although his attack looked to be at full power, he actually held back a great deal. Delighted to see his mother’s Yuan Spirit flying toward him, he immediately reached out to grab her.

However, afraid of Long Chen suddenly attacking, he immediately retreated after grabbing his mother’s Yuan Spirit. But then his expression changed.

“How can this be…?” Long Aotian’s mother began to crack unwillingly.

Long Aotian was also dumbfounded. He had clearly caught her, so how could it have been a failure? His mother’s Yuan Spirit slowly faded.

“I told you that I would let you see hope only for you to not be able to grasp it. Didn’t you say you wanted to send a recording of my death to my mother so she could see how grown up I’ve become? I suppose sending your Yuan Spirit to your son doesn’t count as going too far,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“How can this be? I don’t want to die… I can’t die…” Long Aotian’s mother struggled, but it was useless. Even with Long Aotian using all his abilities, he couldn’t stop her Yuan Spirit from dissipating.

Finally, her Yuan Spirit broke apart. With a terrified, unwilling, and perhaps even a slightly regretful expression, her life came to an end.

“Mom…!” Long Aotian let out a wild roar. He hadn’t reacted like this when Long Chen killed his father. But he went insane as soon as his mother died in front of him.

“Long Chen, I’ll tear you to pieces!” Long Aotian roared and attacked.
