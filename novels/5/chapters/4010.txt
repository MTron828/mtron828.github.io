Chapter 3999 Second Refinement

BOOM!

Long Chen smashed into the ground, the impact almost knocking him unconscious. At this moment, countless stars swirled around in his head as he felt the world spinning around him.

Slowly, he managed to get back on his feet, feeling the aching pain in every bone of his body. The impact had left him feeling as though he had lost his cultivation base.

“Is it forbidden to stay in the air in this place?”

Long Chen sensed that the laws did not permit people to fly here, so he fell to the ground like a dog stool. The impact left him with a broken lip, and he appeared wretched.

BOOM!

Long Chen punched the ground, causing an explosive sound to ring out.

“What hard ground! What is it made of?” Long Chen was startled as this punch only caused his fist to hurt, while the ground was completely undamaged.

The pressure here was about the same as the outside, but there was also an altitude difference here. Thus, it was fortunate that it was Long Chen who had stepped through, or someone else would probably fall to their death.

What Long Chen didn’t know was that they were supposed to pass through the gate together. Once everyone was on the stairs to the final gate, the laws would split the burden across all of them. It was a collective effort that the laws demanded.

Hence, for Long Chen to walk out alone was heroic idealism, which was not a desirable trait for a nation’s leader. If one person dared to barge through alone, they would be punished like him.

Long Chen acclimated himself to this new place for a while before deciding to refine his spirit. But the dragon expert stopped him just as he was about to start.

“Refine your blood, qi, and bones once more. Once all three have been refined a second time, you can start refining the spirit. It will give your Yuan Spirit a boost.”

“Can my blood, qi, and bones be refined again?” asked Long Chen, feeling pleasantly surprised.

“Do you need to ask? The Dragon Soul Body Forging Art is my strongest technique. Did you think that it only had this little power?”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Buzz.

When Long Chen started refining his blood again, the golden dragon blood flowed within his body. However, Long Chen found that the terrifying pressure around him caused it to flow sluggishly.

“This is a body-refinement area, and its laws will cause you to return to the most primal form of cultivation. For the current you, everything will become clumsy and awkward within this space, while your various powers become stiff and slow. Cherish this opportunity well. These kinds of immemorial inheritances are very rare now. Cultivating here will be very beneficial to you,” said the dragon expert.

When Long Chen started refining his blood again, he found that his golden blood, which he thought he had refined to the limit, was igniting again. The surrounding pressure was actually helping him, causing his golden blood to temporarily congeal, as if it had become true gold.

Long Chen was overjoyed by this. The power of his essence blood crazily grew as he refined it. It began to flow faster and smoother within his body, causing him to sense his power rising rapidly.

Just as the dragon expert said, such an opportunity was far too precious, so Long Chen cherished it properly. Six hours later, his golden blood finally started to cool off. Long Chen knew that the pressure here was not enough to keep igniting and refining it.

However, he didn’t go deeper. Instead, he used his blood to refine his qi, and then utilized the power of both to refine his bones. When his bones reached their limit, he merged the power of all three to refine his spirit.

Even then, refining the spirit was still too painful for him, so he still had to take breaks between sessions. Three days later, Long Chen heard a disturbance behind him.

He saw Yu Qingxuan and the others appearing one by one. They had passed through the second gate. Yu Qingxuan’s eyes reddened when she saw Long Chen.

“You bad person, you entered the second gate without saying anything! You don’t even know how worried everyone was!”

“Sorry, I was too curious. I wanted to take a look at what was behind the gate, but I ended up falling through. I couldn’t go back.” Long Chen apologized repeatedly.

He knew that Yu Qingxuan had been worried about him. He definitely should have told them before entering. He had acted too brashly, without thinking about other people’s feelings.

Seeing Long Chen repeatedly apologize, Yu Qingxuan wiped away her tears. She really had been worried about Long Chen. Even though she knew that nothing would happen to him, she couldn’t help worrying about him.

By the time everyone passed through the second gate, the imperial disciples had activated the Vermilion Bird Divine Diagram, a natural formation that allowed them to resist the pressure together using the powerful bloodline resonance between them. Now, Long Chen could no longer detect any trace of panic or dismay that they had at the beginning.

Long Chen asked them about it and learned that because Yu Qingxuan had been worried about Long Chen, they had barged through as quickly as they could, and under that terrifying pressure, their bloodline seal loosened, causing this bloodline resonance ability to awaken.

“I’m truly sorry to have made you all worry.” Long Chen once more apologized to everyone, not having expected these imperial disciples to be like this. After all, over a hundred thousand of them were willing to risk their lives for him. He felt ashamed but also moved by it.

“Brother Long, you don’t need to be so courteous. Since my imperial father let you attend this trial, it means that he doesn’t view you as an outsider. We are one family. Furthermore, we’ll probably need to rely on your support,” said Zhu Yunwen graciously.

He no longer had the arrogance from when they had first met. Now, he only felt sincere reverence for Long Chen. His power had completely won this crown prince over.

“Then I won’t be pretentious. To tell the truth, the empire’s current situation is grim. War is about to break out, and I’m also in a rush. I hope that everyone can pass through the gates as quickly as possible. By entering here, I wanted to probe the path for everyone as soon as possible,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen could smell the coming of war. If the princes, princesses, and other elites of the imperial family were trapped here, the empire would be in danger.

Hearing this, quite a few of the imperial disciples covered up their guilty expressions. In truth, when the crown prince brought everyone charging in, quite a few of them felt conflicted about it.

However, if Long Chen had passed through in advance to scout for them, they would feel bad for having those contrary feelings.

Once everyone was in, they did a simple readjustment to stay in their peak condition. They then activated their bloodline formation’s power, which caused the pressure to fall on their bodies and let them become accustomed to this environment gradually.

When the pressure reached the point of their bones creaking, their manifestations began to rumble and ignite.

At the same time, their bloodline power began to rapidly climb. Sensing it, Zhu Yifeng and the others cried out in shock. The pressure here seemed about the same as before the gate, but it was several times more effective.

“Long Chen, I have a brazen idea!” said Zhu Yunwen suddenly.

“As long as you dare to follow me, I will dare to lead.” Long Chen smiled. He knew what Zhu Yunwen was thinking.

Through multiple refinements, Long Chen’s power had risen, so he wanted to know just what kind of pressure he would be able to endure now.

“Then we’ll trouble brother Long!”

Zhu Yunwen directly gathered all the imperial disciples, summoning their bloodline barrier once more. Long Chen then led them even deeper.

They reached the second step of this region. When Long Chen stepped onto it, an immense pressure crashed down on him like a raging tsunami.
