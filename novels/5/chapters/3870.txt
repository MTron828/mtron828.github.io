Chapter 3859 Treacherous Shi Yang

The moment this heaven-encompassing cage exploded, the entire three thousand worlds quivered. All the experts came flying out of the various cities and domains.

They then looked at the sky. Countless chains were shattering, and a majestic aura unfurled within the three thousand worlds.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Primal chaos qi has descended! All the treasure lands are about to open!”

BOOM!

BOOM!

BOOM!

Mountains exploded, rivers suddenly stopped flowing, and spatial gates opened. When all kinds of secret lands opened, primal chaos qi flooded the three thousand worlds.

The next moment, everyone within the three thousand worlds went crazy. They began to pursue the currents of primal chaos qi to their source.

Within the heavenly tomb, Long Chen, Mo Nian, and the others were staring in shock at the elder of the Heavenly Eye race. When he activated his Heavenly Eye, he instantly destroyed the cage encompassing them. Just how terrifying was this one attack?

“Since you’re all dead, it doesn’t matter if you were good or bad. Go back to wherever you came from!” The elder looked at these lifeforms and sighed.

A ripple then spread from the elder’s eye. It was a gentle light that seemed to contain an indescribable energy. Long Chen had never seen this kind of power before.

After this ripple passed, those immobile lifeforms fell one by one. This mysterious ripple stripped them of the energy supporting them.

They were like puppets being controlled, and the elder had severed the strings controlling them. As a result, those lifeforms collapsed and the terrifying pressures coming from their bodies slowly faded. This time, they seemed to be truly dead.

“Little brother, my wife and I were reunited thanks to you. There is no way to repay this favor. Now, we are about to reincarnate, and all the karma between us will be severed. Although there are no words that can express our gratitude, we will probably never meet again, so I can only say thank you,” said the elder.

“Senior, it is only natural for fellow humans to help each other out. Furthermore, senior is a hero of our human race. You have experienced that ancient battle. Without the sacrifices of your generation, this world would not have a Long Chen. You used your lives to give us a chance to live. Senior, please don’t be so courteous. As a hero of the human race, it is an honor for me to help you,” said Long Chen. These words of his were sincere.

All the heroes of ancient times were amazing figures. Long Chen could see that this elder viewed his wife as even more important than his own life.

However, he and his wife had still chosen to participate in that battle that had taken countless lives. What kind of bravery did that require?

On the other hand, Long Chen would set foot onto a terrible battlefield himself, but he did not wish to see his beloved accompany him. From this, it could be seen that both this elder and his wife were true heroes.

“It’s a shame that we weren’t born in the same era, truly a shame. Now the time has come. Little brother, goodbye.” The elder looked at Long Chen emotionally.

“Seniors, go in peace.”

Long Chen bowed. Mo Nian and the others followed. After the elder nodded, the runes in his eye revolved.

Both of their figures slowly faded away, disappearing into nothingness. These two elders that had participated in that ancient battle finally had their souls return to the cycle of reincarnation.

“Courting death!”

Suddenly, Mo Nian shouted and raised his bow.

BOOM!

The next moment, the void exploded and a figure vanished. Mo Nian’s attack missed.

“Ji Wuming!”

Just as the elder vanished, Ji Wuming actually launched a sneak attack, trying to kill Long Chen. However, he was noticed by Mo Nian.

Long Chen was in an extremely weak state, so his reaction speed was ten times slower than normal times. Because of this, he actually hadn’t sensed Ji Wuming’s presence. If it hadn’t been for Mo Nian, Long Chen might have lost his life just now.

After failing, Ji Wuming snorted. “Long Chen, count yourself lucky today. But just because you were lucky this time, doesn’t mean that you’ll be this lucky next time. Just wait for me to cut off your head.”

Ji Wuming’s figure vanished. It was truly a case of fleeing a thousand miles after one attack, the dogma of the Bloodkill Hall.

“Long Chen, just wait. Now that the primal chaos qi has descended, treasure lands are opening. When my Supreme Blood reaches full power, I will take your life.” Long Aotian glared at Long Chen hatefully.

He was in a miserable state. Half his body was gone, and it looked like he might die at any moment. But a faint layer of violet qi was swirling around him. It seemed that his aura was recovering slowly.

After saying that, Long Aotian crushed a talisman and was directly transported away. As for the Nine Underworld Luocha, she eyed Long Chen icily before leaving as well.

At this moment, Yin Changsheng was incensed and flames almost burst out of his eyes. That appearance of his was like he wanted to bite Long Chen to death.

Last time, Long Chen had taken the Ice Soul Divine Flame that was arranged for Yin Changsheng. And this time, Long Chen managed to take the bronze cauldron after Yin Changsheng had spent a huge amount of his blood and soul essence to get it. It was like Long Chen was specifically targeting him.

“Long Chen, next time we meet, I will definitely take back all that is mine.” Yin Changsheng also left.

As everyone was gone, the only ones left were Long Chen’s group. Guo Ran curiously asked, “Why are they all leaving?”

“What would they do if they didn’t leave? Ask us for a meal?” Mo Nian shrugged.

Xia Chen laughed and said, “They were affected by the rampage of the immemorial creatures, while we were protected by the cauldron. Although on the surface they look fine, in truth, they no longer have the power to fight. If they were to attack us, they’d be the ones to lose.”

Guo Ran nodded in comprehension. So it wasn’t that they didn’t want to attack them, but more like they couldn’t.

“Long Chen, we’ll help you take this cauldron first,” said Mo Nian, placing a hand on his back. His energy poured into Long Chen.

Yue Xiaoqian also pressed a hand on Long Chen’s shoulder, feeding him some energy. Even if the bronze cauldron wanted to take him as a master, in his current state, he didn’t have the power to ignite that rune.

With their assistance, Long Chen pressed his hands on the cauldron. Blood then slowly poured out of him, dyeing that rune.

After that, the bronze cauldron quivered and its divine light shone brightly. The master acknowledgment process was complete.

Long Chen was originally planning on drawing it into the primal chaos space, but then it directly charged into his spiritual space. It automatically chose its resting space.

After putting away the cauldron, Long Chen sighed with relief. He had no time to study it and just began to go through the battlefield with everyone.

Mo Nian, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran were gathering the items on the corpses. These items were all true treasures.

“Curious. Why didn’t I see Shi Yang? Did he run before Ji Wuming attacked?” Yue Xiaoqian suddenly tugged on Long Chen.

“No! Everyone, watch out! He might already be in control of some corpse!” Long Chen’s expression completely changed.

Suddenly, one of the corpses on the ground moved.
