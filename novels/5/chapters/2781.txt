Chapter 2770 Taking It

“First answer me. If I could destroy the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, would that resolve the crisis of the Martial Heaven Continent?” asked Long Chen.

The Martial Heaven Continent said, “It could only count as half resolved. The internal trouble would be resolved, but there are still the outside troubles.”

“What are the outside troubles?” Long Chen was originally excited, but this response was like a bucket of ice water over his head.

“The Heaven Devastating Bracelet is the key to opening the wall of ascension. They view the Martial Heaven Continent as a hunting ground, and every dark era’s battle is a hunt. But this time, the hunt is over. They don’t just want to reap lives but also destroy everything here. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet is absorbing the blood soul energy in order to control the star-field core and make me fall into slumber, making me unable to retaliate. This is to create their own path through the wall of ascension. More experts could then pass through the wall of ascension from that path. It’s a gamble. By using blood soul energy to activate the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, they’ve also allowed us to use the blood soul energy to awaken the will of the Sovereigns. Victory or defeat is decided by time. If you become a Sovereign and break the channel that they build, then those higher experts will be unable to descend here. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet is just a tool that seals me. If those higher experts do come though, at that time… everything will be meaningless. You must use the power of the five supreme divine items to destroy the Heaven Devastating Bracelet before that. That is the only way to save everyone.”

“It would save everyone, but it would destroy our home. A thriving world will become a land of death.” Long Chen shook his head. He didn’t want to imagine living in such a world.

“As long as there’s life, there’s a future. You can think of some way to pass through a spatial wall and find a new world.”

Long Chen sighed. “I essentially understand your plan. You are fighting for time, and the Heaven Devastating Bracelet is now a secondary threat. What is most worrisome is that more experts will descend from outside this world. We must seal this path before they descend. But I have my own plan. Since you’ve entrusted your life to me, listen to me.”

“What plan?”

Long Chen said, “Senior, please send me to the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. If I fail, I’ll accept your suggestion.”

Right away, the space around Long Chen changed, and he appeared on the Martial Heaven Continent, standing on top of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. Only when he stood on top of it did he feel just how miniscule he was in comparison to it.

Long Chen had originally pumped himself up for this, but seeing its giant body made him deflate. It was truly enormous.

“What do you want to do? We don’t have much time,” said the Martial Heaven Continent.

“Senior, can you help me? I want to take the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.” Long Chen took a deep breath. His divine ring spun behind him, and his Six Star Battle Armor appeared.

“Impossible!” exclaimed the Martial Heaven Continent.

“Whether or not it’s impossible will be decided at this moment. Senior, as long as you help me lift it up, you can leave the rest to me,” said Long Chen.

“If the Heaven Devastating Bracelet is moved, the suppression that the five Sovereigns have placed on it will weaken. If it goes out of control, then the Sovereigns’ final hope will also be extinguished. Long Chen, are you really confident?”

The current Heaven Devastating Bracelet was still suppressed, and Long Chen’s action could lead to unforeseen consequences. It might ruin all their preparations.

“I am confident, as long as you can lift it up.” Long Chen nodded.

“Alright. Since I’ve chosen you, I will leave it to you,” sighed the Martial Heaven Continent.

The land suddenly began to quiver, and the giant Heaven Devastating Bracelet slowly floated into the sky. Its giant form appeared above the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, darkening the world.

The experts at the core of the continent finally had a view of just how giant it was. As it rose, the formation that the five Sovereigns had created shuddered.

However, the invaders actually stopped attacking. They retreated, with some who didn’t retreat in time consumed by the divine light of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

“It really is enormous.” When its entire body appeared above the sea, Long Chen felt like an ant in front of a giant city. However, he clenched his teeth. No matter what, he had to go all-out.

Long Chen then pressed his hands against the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. With a roar, his divine ring expanded, forming a giant spatial hole. The other side of this hole was the primal chaos space.

This giant spatial hole was his limit after advancing to the ninth Heavenstage. However, it was still miniscule compared to the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

It was like an ordinary person trying to use their mouth to swallow a table. The mouth was far too small in comparison, and there was no way to squeeze the table in.

“Get in here!” Long Chen roared, the veins on his forehead throbbing. At this moment, countless stars appeared around his arms as he pulled. However, no matter how he pulled, he was like an ant shaking a tree. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet didn’t even budge, as it was too heavy. It was practically an entire world.

“Senior, help me!” shouted Long Chen.

“Senior!”

Long Chen waited, but the Martial Heaven Continent didn’t reply. It seemed to be making a difficult decision.

“We trust Long Chen. Do it!” the five Sovereigns suddenly spoke at the same time.

The next moment, the Heaven Devastating Bracelet quivered, and it was pulled toward Long Chen’s divine ring.

On the other hand, Long Chen’s divine ring began to crack and crumble. However, he continued to pull it in.

Suddenly, the Heaven Devastating Bracelet seemed to awaken, and countless runes lit up on it. As a result, Long Chen’s body instantly received a backlash, and he became covered in cracks. But he still didn’t give up. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As for now, a very small portion of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet had been brought into the primal chaos space, and its pressure already crushed all the plants and trees inside of the primal chaos space.

Only the Heavenly Dao Tree at the center of the black soil remained undamaged, but even its fruit had been destroyed.

“Long Chen, give up on this. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet is about to awaken!” urged the Martial Heaven Continent.

Long Chen’s method was impossible. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet was too heavy, and no one could possibly take it. Hence, Long Chen’s idea was a wild fantasy.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen took out Evilmoon and struck the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. It quivered and a terrifying aura rose.

“No-!” The Martial Heaven Continent cried out in shock, but it was too late. Long Chen had woken the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

As the Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s terrifying power raged, huge cracks appeared within Long Chen’s primal chaos space. Just at that moment, an incomparably sharp, majestic, and sacred will was also startled awake.
