Chapter 3642 Foolish Sons of Rich Parents

“Boss, what do we do? Should we go to the Spirit Rune Pavilion and capture that damn pavilion master? We’ll give him a beating and have him hand over Xia Chen,” said Guo Ran.

“Can you please think before speaking? If the Spirit Rune Pavilion could find Xia Chen, they wouldn’t need to announce a warrant. That’s what it means not to wash your dirty laundry in public. For them to do this, they clearly truly cannot find Xia Chen and have to ask for aid from the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. What we need to do now is not seeking revenge. It's to find Xia Chen. Furthermore, we must do it before the others find him. Most likely, he is seriously injured and is recuperating somewhere secret. He is in his most vulnerable state right now. We must find him first,” said Long Chen gloomily.

“But how are we supposed to find him? Is it any different from searching for a needle in a haystack?” said Guo Ran worriedly.

Long Chen once again irritably said, “Please grow a brain. I really am bewildered by how you managed to become one of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes. On the Martial Heaven Continent, didn’t we have our own special way of staying in contact? Using dragon blood as the link, we created an instrument to find any of the Dragonblood warriors who cultivated the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. The compass will sense the dragon blood within a certain range. Xia Chen definitely wouldn’t be as foolish as you. He definitely preserved his dragon blood all this time. Perhaps he even has a sensing compass to sense the other Dragonblood warriors. If two people activate the compass at once, it can sense even further. We’ll definitely have an easier time finding him than anyone else.”

“Oh, I really am a pig. I forgot about this. Boss is wise! I’ll make one right now!” Guo Ran clapped his own head. In his worry, his head didn’t work properly.

This sensing compass had been developed by Guo Ran and Xia Chen back then. It was so that the Dragonblood warriors could find each other if they were ever separated.

However, they hadn’t used it much in the mortal world. Who would have thought that they would find a use for it in the immortal world?

When it came to the art of runes, Guo Ran was not an expert. But this kind of compass was easy considering he had made it before. He quickly made two compasses.

“Boss, these are the best compasses I can make with the materials we have on hand. The sensing range should be beyond three hundred thousand miles. But the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field is gigantic. It would take years to scan all of it. Where should we start?” asked Guo Ran.

Long Chen shook his head. Being with this fellow caused his intelligence to fall. He couldn’t even bother using his head now. Long Chen took out a map and pointed at a few markers. “Let’s start from these areas. These are the areas with the highest likelihood of finding Xia Chen.”

Those markers were actually given to them by the fellow trying to peddle talismans to them. This was the calculations of the Spirit Rune Pavilion and the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field’s experts.

They had calculated the spatial fluctuations of that day, the remnant fluctuations of the Heaven Shaking Talisman’s explosion, as well as how Xia Chen had transported himself. They then came up with several lines of space that Xia Chen might have gone through.

“No way, those areas have been flipped through many times. How could Xia Chen stay there?” asked Guo Ran.

“Fool, do you not understand that it’s darkest right beneath the light? The more dangerous the place, the safer it is. Xia Chen didn’t have time to run anywhere far. If he tried, it would be even more dangerous. Rather than taking that risk, it would be better to stay in a chaotic land. The greater the chaos, the greater the holes. Furthermore, he is a talisman expert. He naturally knows how to conceal himself. The more muddied the waters, the better it conceals him. Alright, let’s not waste time. There are five regions. You take the ones on the left, I’ll take the ones on the right, and we’ll converge at the center. Rather than going fast, make sure that you cover all the space that he could be. Don’t leave any gaps.”

Long Chen drew a path on the map just in case Guo Ran was careless and didn’t go through the entire area.

Guo Ran took the map. He also took out a flying boat and used a brush to write a line of words boldly on it.

“I, Guo Ran, come to find Xia Chen! Those who block my path to riches will be treated like the murderers of my parents. Anyone who dares to block me will be killed!”

Long Chen smiled. This fellow did have some smarts when he wanted to think. Outsiders would probably think that he was crazy and wouldn’t want to bother him.

But if Xia Chen saw it, he would definitely show himself. Xia Chen and Guo Ran had been together the longest. These ugly characters of Guo Ran’s would be instantly recognized as the real deal.

“Not bad! Let’s go!”

Long Chen and Guo Ran parted ways, going to two separate areas.

Long Chen also used a flying boat and wrote some characters on it: Dragonblood Legion.

He had thought about just writing his own name, but he felt that this was being too brash. Supposedly, even the Bloodkill Hall’s assassins had come. Although as long as it wasn’t Enpuda, he wasn’t afraid at all.

However, before finding Xia Chen, he didn’t want to clash with anyone. Finding Xia Chen first was more important.

When Long Chen arrived at the first area, he was dumbfounded. The number of flying boats in the sky made them seem like ravens. Those flying boats were emitting rays of divine light sweeping across the land. They made sure to go over every inch of this land.

“Damn!” When Long Chen arrived, he just happened to see two flying boats attacking each other. He didn’t know if they were fighting over an area to search or if something had happened, but in the end, the two flying boats smashed into each other, causing both flying boats to explode.

Two wretched figures then came flying out of the wreckage. Both of them were in bad tempers. With a wave of their hands, one talisman after another came flying out. They were like flying blades spinning through the air. Those blades would then explode, occasionally causing a tempest, soaring flames, frost that covered everything, or golden light to erupt.

This was Long Chen’s first time seeing two talisman cultivators fighting. First, ignoring their actual fighting skill, it had to be said that a battle between talisman cultivators was very eye-catching. All of their moves were flashy and pretty.

However, after watching for just a bit, Long Chen got bored. It seemed that neither of them was a true expert. They were just randomly tossing out talismans, competing over who had more.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Furthermore, as their hands got to work, their mouths didn’t slack off. They were constantly cursing each other. It seemed that they were intent on competing until one of their stocks was exhausted. Whoever ran first would be the loser.

It seemed that they weren’t competing in terms of power. Those talismans were all money. It was clearly a method of using money to crush the other side. These were two foolish sons of rich parents that were burning money to play around.

Some other talisman cultivators watched them like watching monkeys perform. They occasionally even cheered for them. As a result, the two of them fought more energetically. Talismans were flung out as if they cost nothing at all.

Long Chen shook his head. These two were clearly idiots, and he couldn’t be bothered to keep watching. He continued onward. Just as he started on the path that he had decided, his compass began to violently shake.
