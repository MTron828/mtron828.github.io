Chapter 2473 Zhao Ritian

“How fast!” Long Chen had a bad feeling. According to Evilmoon, the direct path that they had traversed should have allowed them to arrive before others.

Furthermore, entering this core region had required Evilmoon to activate the power of a real dragon. That was the only reason why they could enter so easily.

Others had to bypass a barrier set down by the dragon king. Getting through it was very difficult and time-consuming. The fact that Feng Fei had arrived right after him meant that she had clearly come prepared. She must have a special method to enter as well.

Long Chen stealthily glanced at the other person. He saw that he was small, like a child, startling him. Did Feng Fei have a son?

Long Chen couldn’t directly look at them for fear of being sensed. He could only try to see them in his peripheral vision. All he saw was that it was a very short person. It seemed that he only reached an adult’s waist.

However, eventually he was shocked to find that the shortie’s face was black with a metallic luster. It was like he was made of steel.

Furthermore, his aura was off. It didn’t seem to be the aura of flesh and blood. This person gave him an extremely dangerous feeling.

“Someone else arrived first.” He spoke, sounding fully mature, but his voice had a metallic tone that was ear-piercing.

As soon as he spoke, Long Chen sensed the stones here quivering, as if some kind of energy within them was being activated by him.

“He’s a dwarf.” At this moment, Long Chen realized that even in terms of proportion, this person was off. His lower body was much shorter than the rest of him.

“Get out, or I’ll give you a life worse than death.” The dwarf sneered, his voice resounding throughout heaven and earth, stabbing into Long Chen’s ears like millions of needles. This person’s cultivation technique was extremely bizarre. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Long Chen snorted inside. As expected, the people from the divine families were domineering. It seemed that he already viewed this place as belonging to him.

For some reason, this person’s voice sounded a bit familiar to Long Chen as if he had heard it before.

Based on his sharp memory, if he had seen such a person, there was no way that he would forget. Even if the other side had some ability to make others forget, it wouldn’t affect him.

“Feng Fei, you can take the four divine bones. I’ll go find that person,” said the dwarf.

Feng Fei frowned. “Don’t waste time. On my own, breaking the seal will take too long. It doesn’t matter who it is. As long as they don’t hinder us from taking the treasures, there’s no need to kill them. There are more important things to do.”

“Unacceptable. I’ve given them a chance to come up, and they didn’t take it. So they can’t blame me for being vicious,” said the dwarf coldly.

He suddenly opened his mouth and roared. A sharp sound resounded through the air, and the earth resonated with his voice. Even the platforms let out sharp cries. It was as if the entire world was returning his call.

“What kind of power is this? He can control the metal energy within all things? Is this a variant of the earth element?” Long Chen’s heart shook. This sharp sound stabbed into his soul. He couldn’t defend against it, or it would create a reaction and he would be sensed.

“The divine families really are interesting. Another monster on this level has appeared. Fine, I have more important things to do, so I won’t waste time on you.” Long Chen snorted inside and placed a hand on a blood mark on the dragon scale. The dragon blood in his body shook, and he instantly vanished.

Long Chen’s body had just vanished when the void exploded. The dwarf appeared nearby, and he was surprised. Just now, he had sensed someone around here, but by the time he appeared, that person was gone.

“Get out here! Perhaps I can still spare your life, but if you don’t…!” The dwarf smiled coldly and began to form hand seals.

“They’re already gone. Hurry up and focus on getting the divine bones,” said Feng Fei icily, clearly disapproving of his methods.

“Are you sure?” asked the dwarf.

“I couldn’t confirm his position, but I could sense his spiritual fluctuations. Now, they’re gone, so he’s already left. Although he was hiding his spiritual fluctuations, they felt a bit familiar. If my senses were correct, he was probably Long Chen,” said Feng Fei.

“Long Chen? That genius from the Martial Heaven Continent that the Long family is pulling in? I hear he has some power. Hmph, he was smart to run, or I’d have killed him here,” snorted the dwarf.

Feng Fei frowned at him. “It seems that you’re leaning toward the Ye family and no longer being neutral?”

The dwarf arrogantly said, “I, Zhao Ritian, stand on my own. I don’t need to lean on anyone. Other people’s grievances and favors have nothing to do with me. It’s a shame that the four families’ disciples aren’t allowed to kill each other. The rankings between the four of us are based on our family rankings. The Zhao family was last in the last two rankings, which is clearly an insult, but do you really think that I am weaker than you three?”

Feng Fei looked at him and snorted. “If you don’t like it, you can also rank yourself first. Would that make you feel better?

“You…!” Zhao Ritian clenched his fists. Feng Fei’s insult had touched a nerve.

“Stop wasting time. If you would rather go killing, then go. I’ll take the divine bones myself. But don’t blame me when I don't give you a share. We’re the only ones to enter the Star Field Divine World. The other two went to Resentful Death City. At that time, everyone will have advanced, while you gained nothing. Don’t bark like a wild dog then,” said Feng Fei. It seemed that she didn’t like working together with this person.

“Feng Fei, don’t think that just because your Jiang family has two Sovereign sprouts that you can do whatever you want,” shouted Zhao Ritian.

“If your Zhao family had two Sovereign sprouts, you could do the same. Of course, if by yourself you could suppress me and my big brother, you could also do whatever you want. If you have that ability, then quickly take it out. If you don’t, then stop talking so much. It would be best if you didn’t act so arrogant in front of me. I don’t need to give you face when it comes to my actions,” said Feng Fei, also angered now.

Feng Fei was a peerless heavenly genius, while Zhao Ritian was acting like he was above her and talking like everyone else should die. It was irritating.

She hadn’t wanted to enter the Star Field Divine World this time, mostly because she disliked this dwarf. Zhao Ritian was extremely annoying to her. She essentially hadn’t spoken to him the entire way here because she thought that she might lose her temper and start fighting. She had endured all the way, but she had had enough.

Seeing that she was angered, Zhao Ritian snorted. It was unknown if he felt that he was at a disadvantage or if there was no point in fighting. In the end, he stood beside Feng Fei and took out an ancient jade seal. He pressed it against the barrier.

Both of their energies slowly entered the barrier. A pillar of light exploded out of the two of them.

“The barrier’s power is so strong! Just how long is this going to take?!” said Zhao Ritian impatiently.

“This barrier was created by a dragon king. Although the dragon king is dead, its soul essence has yet to fully fade. This barrier cannot be broken with brute force. We can only slowly draw out the dragon king’s power to weaken the barrier. With both of us working together, at this rate, it should take two months before all the energy is exhausted.” Feng Fei then closed her eyes, ignoring him.

“That long? Fine, if someone else comes in, I’ll just kill them. That way, it won’t be boring,” said Zhao Ritian.

“Zhao Ritian, I am warning you not to mess around. The four of us have always been living in the heavenly abode. We haven’t come into contact with the Martial Heaven Continent. However, the continent has also produced many geniuses. If you create enemies left and right, don’t blame me for turning hostile if you cause me trouble!” shouted Feng Fei. She truly found Zhao Ritian insufferable.

“Geniuses? You mean like Long Chen? When he saw me, he was so scared that he didn’t dare to reveal himself and directly fled. Such a person can be called a genius? Just living in the same world as me is his sin. Feng Fei, I don’t want to be enemies with you. We are collaborating to take the divine bones. You should be clear on your own position and not meddle with my affairs!” retorted Zhao Ritian.

“You’re too arrogant. The Corrupt path’s Ye Ming, Pill Valley’s Yu Qingxuan, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s Zi Yan, as well as that mysterious heir of the Gambling Heavenly Dao, none of them are ordinary. There are also the four everlasting families and the Dragonblood Legion. If you make too many enemies and cause me to fail to take the divine bones, I will make you bear the responsibility for it.” Feng Fei’s expression sank. She had an urge to kill Zhao Ritian right here and now.

Although Feng Fei had confidence in her skills, if so many of those people were angered and attacked the two of them together, although they would be able to survive, their goal of taking the divine bones would end in failure.

They had discussed this from the start. They only wanted the four divine bones. If no one else came by the time they finished, then they would take the dragon body as well.

However, if others came at that time, they couldn’t expel them. They were already taking the main treasure. They had to leave others something. If they didn’t, that would only force others to turn against them.

Although Feng Fei was arrogant, her arrogance and conceit had their limits. But Zhao Ritian had none of that. He felt that he was the only one worth anything in this world, and he refused to let others even get a look at the treasures here since he felt that they were all his. Feng Fei was starting to grow uneasy. She had a kind of premonition that Zhao Ritian might bring a calamity upon the divine families one day.

“I don’t need you to handle my matters. It just so happens that I can take a look at what the Martial Heaven Continent has produced, and whether or not they’re worth my attention,” sneered Zhao Ritian. As he drew out the barrier’s power, he kept a sharp look on the surroundings, a murderous light in his eyes.
