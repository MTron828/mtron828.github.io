Chapter 3693 Enpuda’s Suspicions

Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran were startled when they saw Ji Wuying in the distance. They couldn’t believe their eyes. “How come Ji Wuying is still alive?”

“No, he’s not Ji Wuying! Both of his hands are Supreme Bones!” exclaimed Guo Ran, the first to notice something wrong. Due to also possessing a Supreme Bone, he immediately sensed this oddity.

Ji Wuying killed those people making a ruckus. However, no one saw how he did it. He simply appeared and those people exploded without a warning. Everyone was stunned.

Following that, horrified cries rang out. That was because they saw that big fatty once more. The Bloodkill Hall’s master, Enpuda, had actually come.

Furthermore, behind Enpuda were hundreds of masked experts in black cloaks. They were the best of the Bloodkill Hall’s assassins.

Now, everyone knew why those people suddenly died. Their actions were clearly a slap in Enpuda’s face, so when he came, they had to be exterminated.

Enpuda’s arrival caused quite a ruckus. Countless people stared at this expert whose fame shook the world. Enpuda’s reputation truly preceded him.

Whether it was the junior generation or the senior generation, they were both horrified. This was an exceedingly dangerous figure.

Although Enpuda’s cultivation base on the surface only appeared to be in the World King realm, everyone knew that his power was enough to crush most Divine Venerates.

Countless gazes were drawn to Enpuda. However, they only dared to look and not get close to this existence.

Enpuda didn’t give off the slightest emotional ripple due to those people’s deaths. It was as if their actions were unable to antagonize him.

“Junior brother Long Chen! How coincidental! You’ve actually come so early.” Enpuda spotted Long Chen amongst the crowd and smiled. That tone was like he was seeing a friend for the first time in many years. He then enthusiastically walked over.

“It truly is a coincidence. I admire you very much. This should be Ji Wuying’s twin brother, am I right? Ji Wuying died, and his Supreme Bone was transferred to your hand. If my vision is right, one hand controls time, and the other controls space! How amazing!” Long Chen eyed that man.

“Hahaha, brother Long Chen’s vision really is sharp. You instantly saw through my disciple’s skill. I admire you even more now. Wuming, shouldn’t you come to greet dean Long Chen? You should know that your dual Supreme Bones are thanks to his efforts. Otherwise, who knows how long you would have to wait? It would definitely be after this opening of the three thousand worlds.” Enpuda laughed and turned to Ji Wuming.

“This junior is Ji Wuming. Many thanks for your work, dean Long Chen. To repay you, I will personally cut off your head.” Ji Wuming cupped his fists toward Long Chen with a smile.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s expressions instantly sank. On the other hand, Long Chen’s expression was still indifferent. They were all enemies, and when they fought, it would be a battle to the death. They naturally didn’t need to be polite.

“Then I wish you luck. Again, I, Long Chen, will welcome any challenge at any time. As long as you’re willing to gamble with your life, I will not refuse,” said Long Chen lightly.

When it came to Ji Wuming, Long Chen had a certain feeling. This person might be young, but he had been polished by Enpuda for so long. His scheming ability must be deep and could not be underestimated.

Despite his arrogant and careless appearance, Long Chen’s intuition told him that it was an intentional act to lower his guard.

With Enpuda’s character, whatever disciple he raised personally would definitely be the same as him. It would have to be a person with great endurance and restraint.

However, no matter how he acted, it meant nothing to Long Chen. Again, in front of absolute power, all schemes were worthless.

“Dean Long Chen, I really admire you. When I was investigating your path, I set up many traps where I expected you to go, but they all ended up empty. I thought that you were setting up fakes, while your real targets were the few ruins of the High Firmament Academy in the Violet Flame Heaven. Who would have thought that your real target would be the Nine Underworld Island!” Enpuda looked at Long Chen.

“To tell the truth, my first target in coming to the Violet Flame Heaven was the Nine Underworld Island, while my second target was your Heavenly River Valley. But I underestimated the foundation of divine conners. Us three brothers almost met with calamity against Liao Bencang. If I didn’t make that strange mirror explode, the three of us would definitely have died. We mostly only escaped thanks to luck. But I suppose that only proves that divine conners are already abandoned by the Heavenly Daos. Not even the heavens want to help you.” Long Chen smiled.

Although his expression didn’t change, Long Chen was shaken inside. When Enpuda said this, an almost imperceptible sense of danger enveloped Long Chen.

He had a bad feeling because it seemed that Enpuda had sensed something. Perhaps because Long Chen had destroyed the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, Enpuda was suspecting his status.

The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror was a divine item that targeted nine star heirs. Although Long Chen’s divine ring and star diagram were covered up by the Seven Supreme Yang Technique and the Starry River of the Sky Art, while his own aura was no longer like that of the other nine star heirs, there were still many similarities.

This time, Long Chen had even destroyed the main problem for nine star heirs, the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. It was only natural that Enpuda would be suspicious.

Hence, Long Chen looked into Enpuda’s eyes when he said this. What Long Chen said was true. There truly were two targets. Other than destroying the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, his other goal had been to destroy the Bloodkill Hall in the Heavenly River Valley.

Other than the Bloodkill Hall’s main headquarters, their stronghold in the Heavenly River Valley was the most important one. As long as it was destroyed and his divine faith receptacle was ruined, Enpuda would suffer immense injury.

However, although Long Chen had given Liao Bencang a high power estimation, he hadn’t expected him to be so terrifying when he possessed so much faith energy. Because of that, Long Chen almost lost his life. He naturally wouldn’t go to the Heavenly River Valley after that.

“Then that really is a pity. If you had first come to the Heavenly River Valley, it would have been better. After all, I’m not like that idiot Liao Bencang. If you had come to the Heavenly River Valley, you would have never been able to leave,” said Enpuda with a regretful expression.

“There’s nothing regretful about it. Even if I went to the Heavenly River Valley first, I wouldn’t treat it like the Nine Underworld Island. I would definitely prepare some more. Although you are quite wily, I don’t think my brain is empty. To tell the truth, I actually hope to be able to beat you in wits one day,” said Long Chen very confidently.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen had decided after the battle of the Martial Heaven Continent’s destruction, he would stop relying on his intelligence in handling things. If he always wanted to use wits to resolve his problems, it would slow down his cultivation.

However, Enpuda’s schemes had made him suffer more than once, so he was getting competitive. He really wanted to use his own intelligence to tell Enpuda that he wasn’t smarter.

Enpuda sighed, “A shame, a real shame. If you had come to my Heavenly River Valley first, perhaps there would still be room to talk. Once I caught you, Lord Brahma would welcome you. Unfortunately, you went to the Nine Underworld Island and destroyed the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. There’s no room for discussion any longer. It’s all that idiot Liao Bencang’s fault. Other than having a bad temper and shedding all responsibility for his own actions, he has no other ability. That’s the only reason this matter got ruined to this extent.”

“Fuck your mother! Enpuda, you’re a piece of trash who only knows how to talk behind people’s backs! If you have guts, let’s have a fair fight!”

A furious roar rang out. Hearing it, Guo Ran and Xia Chen jumped. That was a voice that they would never forget in this lifetime.
