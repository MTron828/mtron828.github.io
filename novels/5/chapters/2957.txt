Chapter 2946 Preparing to Break Through

“You also failed?” Chu Yang looked at the man beside him with astonishment.

This man was of average height and average tanned appearance, with the only alarming thing about him being a pair of eagle-like eyes. They appeared shockingly sharp. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This person was one of Chu Yang’s subordinates and also a terrifying archer. He was a mixed-blood descendant of the human race and the Heavenly Eagle race, so his eyes could see through a person’s weak points. He had killed many powerful experts and was one of Chu Yang’s most capable generals. Furthermore, he was a secret trump card that Chu Yang didn’t easily expose to others.

Chu Yang was extremely confident in his killing power. If he caught someone off guard, no one was capable of dodging his assassination.

The magistrate elder had immediately alerted Chu Yang about the failure, having him prepare for an assassination. The failure this time made him extremely uneasy.

Based on Chu Yang’s calculations, after narrowly escaping death, Long Chen’s mental state had to be worn out. This was the best timing to kill him.

Following normal logic, after failing, they would immediately focus on cleaning up the evidence and should be in a state of panic at Long Chen having escaped.

Long Chen truly had thought that this was what they would do. Having not expected the Chu family to immediately send an assassin after him, he had been caught off guard. That was why Long Chen was so enraged. The feeling of being schemed against was hard to take.

However, Chu Yang hadn’t expected this terrifying archer of his to still fail after catching Long Chen off guard. He almost couldn’t believe it.

“His sense of danger is frighteningly sharp. My arrows that are specialized at bewildering other people’s senses were useless against him,” said the eagle-eyed man.

He was a terrifying expert that had killed many people who were actually stronger than him. Hence, he was extremely proud of his achievements. But today, that confidence received a blow. It was his first failure.

“This Long Chen will sooner or later become a tumor to our Chu family. Since we missed this opportunity, killing him in the future will grow more and more difficult.”

Other than the eagle-eyed man and Chu Yang, Chu Huairen and the other elder were also present. The elder’s expression was gloomy. Even now, he didn’t understand how Long Chen hadn’t died.

Chu Huairen also didn’t believe it. He was extremely clear on just how terrifying the energy was when hundreds of sluice gates were opened at once. Even Chu Huairen would instantly die without a trace, but Long Chen was still alive.

Even Chu Yang’s number one archer hadn’t managed to succeed after catching him off guard. He hadn’t even touched Long Chen’s clothes. They were growing more and more shocked.

If Long Chen had some special treasure protecting him in the divine flame spirit pool, then that was somewhat understandable. But for him to even dodge the eagle-eyed archer’s assassination attempt, that meant he relied on actual power.

“We were clean with both our attempts. Even if Long Chen knows it was done by us, he has no proof and can’t touch us. At least having a decent opponent will make life more interesting. The stronger the target, the more satisfying killing them will be,” said Chu Yang with a grim smile.

“Yang-er, don’t get careless. Long Chen is extremely dangerous. Don’t let him ruin everything,” warned Chu Huairen.

“I have never underestimated any opponent. Don’t worry, whether it is in terms of power or strategy, other than those two, I’m not afraid of anyone in the inner academy. The Chu family’s prestige was damaged by Chu Kuang’s death, and now is no longer the time to conceal our power. We must reveal our fangs at the necessary time.”

Chu Huairen pondered this and nodded. “You are correct. Some people that we bought have started growing antsy. Those fellows really think that our Chu family is lacking. What a bunch of fools.”

“But fools also have their own value. Let’s find a few ways to counterattack. However, after missing this chance to kill Long Chen, we won’t have another good one for a while. We’ll have to endure. Uncles, make sure not to leave any evidence for others to take advantage of. Although Long Chen doesn’t have any proof, one little clue could lead to a mistake,” said Chu Yang.

Chu Huairen nodded. “This trait of yours is gratifying. If your little brother had half this steadiness, he wouldn’t have ended up like he did. Alright, we’ll leave for now.”

After Chu Huairen and the elder left, the eagle-eyed man suddenly said, “Should we prepare for a sneak attack? With his cooperation, the two of us can definitely eliminate Long Chen.”

Chu Yang shook his head. “It’s useless. Long Chen isn’t such a fool. It will be difficult for us to catch him off guard again. Even if the two of you attack together, considering that he is now prepared, it will be difficult to succeed. You’ll also end up exposing yourselves, and that would be troublesome. Long Chen has the head judge’s support, so he is just looking for our Chu family to leave ourselves open. You would be sending him your heads by attacking.”

“Then what can we do?”

“Don’t be hasty. An opportunity will definitely come. Long Chen has many weaknesses, while we have plenty of cards to play. Toying with him to death is simply a matter of time. Not killing him this time isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps he can even help us with some matters.” Chu Yang smiled. His voice was full of confidence. He lightly rubbed a string of prayer beads around his wrist. There was a figure carved on that prayer bead.

If Long Chen was present, he would definitely be astonished. That figure carved into the prayer bead was the other god that Pill Valley worshiped, Fallen Daynight.

…

The divine flame spirit pool was closed for three days to investigate what had happened. The ultimate conclusion was that a problem had occurred with the formation. After it was repaired, disciples resumed entering.

When Long Chen received this news, if it was before, he would definitely turn up his nose and scoff. But now, he understood what it meant for a smart person to know how to act foolish. That was its own kind of ability.

As for foolish people who acted smart, those were the real idiots. There were truly many people like this, for example, in Long Chen’s eyes, the most obvious ones were the two brothers, Chu Yang and Chu Kuang.

Long Chen had always felt that he didn’t lose out in terms of intelligence to anyone, but after the battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, he found that intelligence was truly worth crap. He even felt regret about wasting the effort on little tricks in the past. If that effort was spent on steadily advancing his cultivation, then perhaps that battle wouldn’t have ended so miserably. Perhaps he wouldn’t have had to just watch as Qu Jianying, the old man, Ling Yunzi, Hu Feng, and the others died one by one.

In the immortal world, Long Chen gave up using schemes. He wanted to focus all his time and effort on cultivation.

Mu Qingyun and the others had to wait for the divine flame spirit pool to be repaired, so they went to recruit others. As for Long Chen, after resting a day, he reached his peak condition. He then went to the Pill Institute.

The outer region of the Pill Institute was empty. After he found a rather safe place with no one else there, he closed his eyes. When he opened them again, there were flame seeds within them. At this moment, his Blood Qi ignited, and a giant blaze erupted around him. He finally began to attack the Divine Flame realm.
