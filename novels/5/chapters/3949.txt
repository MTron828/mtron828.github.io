Chapter 3938 Great Success

Flame energy and thunderforce interwove around a pair of heaven-covering wings that were now around ten feet long. As the Kunpeng's runes diminished in size, they became even more intricately woven and densely packed. Within these runes, a potent combination of flame energy and thunderforce coursed through, creating a mesmerizing display of power.

This was the refining method that the dragon expert had taught Long Chen. Originally, Long Chen had been planning on using the true dragon essence blood to control these wings, but the dragon expert said that the Kunpeng and the dragon races possessed such powerful wills that they couldn’t be subdued so easily.

One tiny slip and those wings would simply self-destruct. Thus, Long Chen was using flame energy and thunderforce to refine them. Those were natural energies, so the Kunpeng will would not fight them that hard.

Using the thunderforce and flame energy to slowly grind away the Kunpeng will was like slowly boiling a frog in hot water, simply a matter of time.

Long Chen’s original plan was to just leave the Kunpeng wings in the primal chaos space and have Huo Linger and Lei Linger slowly refine them over time. After all, he was in no rush.

But after hearing Xia Guhong’s warning, Long Chen decided to first refine the wings before leaving.

The inside of the Kunpeng wings was filled with divine light, flames and lightning dancing within them. At this moment, the wings were shuddering and the roar of the Kunpeng could be heard. The Kunpeng will was resisting.

As Long Chen didn’t dare to force it too much, he directed Huo Linger and Lei Linger to slow down a bit, giving it some room to breathe so that it didn’t destroy itself.

Once the will calmed down, Huo Linger and Lei Linger continued. Then when it got berserk again, they gave it some time.

Like this, the Kunpeng will was slowly erased. As its core energy was extracted, the resistance weakened.

After three days, the Kunpeng will was gone completely, a sign that this pair of wings were flawlessly refined. They looked as if they were made of gold. Their divine light was brilliant, and they even possessed a sacred aura that made people not dare to look at them directly.

“The Kunpeng race’s sacred energy is so powerful?” Long Chen was a bit surprised.

“Of course. Without it, how could the Kunpeng race be qualified to challenge our dragon race? The Kunpeng will is gone now, so you can insert your Spiritual Strength inside. I will teach you how to control these runes. Hehe, quite a few of the Kunpeng race’s ultimate moves are stored inside this pair of wings. With them, you will truly be like a tiger with wings. With the divine abilities of my dragon race and the Kunpeng race, you might be an unprecedented existence,” said the dragon expert with a hint of excitement.

“Senior, you won’t mind if I use the power of your dragon blood to control the Kunpeng’s divine abilities, will you?” probed Long Chen.

“Why would I? You aren’t really from my dragon race, so you don’t need to preserve the purity of your bloodline. Hehe, killing the Kunpeng race with the Kunpeng race’s divine abilities, now that is satisfying!” laughed the dragon expert. “Hmph the ghost fox evil dragon race’s appearance had the shadow of the Kunpeng race behind it. I have always suspected that it was the Kunpeng race that’s causing trouble from behind the scenes. If they can play like this, well, my noble dragon race wouldn’t lower themselves to their level. Hehehe…”

Long Chen suddenly understood. It seemed that the dragon expert was using him to antagonize the Kunpeng race. Long Chen was a human, so this matter couldn’t be blamed on the dragon race. The dragon race would retain their noble and haughty position, while Long Chen would be the one to drag down the Kunpeng race. It was just like how the Kunpeng race had used the ghost fox evil dragon to cause trouble for the dragon race.

When Long Chen thought of that, he laughed. Without any further misgivings, his Spiritual Strength entered the runes of the wings.

“Kunpeng Heaven Splitting Slash!”

“Kunpeng Void Breaker!”

“Kunpeng Feathered Shield!”

“Hahaha, Long Chen, your luck’s not bad! These wings still have three core runes in them. To awaken three kinds of divine abilities in the Immortal King realm, that Kun Tu can count as a genius.” The dragon expert laughed, pleasantly surprised.

There were countless runes on these wings. However, the majority were not innate runes. They were cultivated later to increase the speed and strength of the wings.

The most precious things on the wings were the natural innate runes. Those were the foundation upon which the Kunpeng race’s strongest divine abilities were born. They were so precious that only extremely talented Kunpengs would produce them.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After all, Kun Tu was a pure Kunpeng. His runes were not passed down through bloodline but generated through the laws of the Heavenly Daos.

Even if he only awakened them through cultivation, they were still natural innate runes. For Kun Tu to awaken three such runes in the Immortal King realm, that was something very rarely seen even in the immemorial era.

Hearing this news, Long Chen was excited. His Spiritual Strength then entered the runes, and the dragon expert taught him what to do. He saw just how terrifying these three divine abilities were.

The first one was Kunpeng Heaven Splitting Slash, a terrifying attack that tore apart the dome of the heavens. Kun Tu had used this move before.

The second was Kunpeng Void Breaker. Kun Tu had not displayed this one because it was a movement art that pushed one’s speed to the limit. Also, Kun Tu had awoken it inside the three thousand worlds, and before he even had a chance to use it, he was already drawn over by the disturbance that Long Chen caused.

Later on, due to running out of energy, he didn’t even have a chance to use it in combat. Thus, no one had seen the effect of this technique.

As for the third move, Kunpeng Feathered Shield, it was a technique for absolute defense. Kun Tu had also awakened it in the three thousand worlds and had tried to use it. However, he had only been capable of summoning an embryonic form of it. Unable to draw out its full power, he was beaten so miserably by Long Chen.

“Hehe, I’ve struck gold!” Long Chen laughed excitedly. The three moves from the ancestral dragon reverse scale were all offensive, without a single movement art or defensive technique. But now, Kun Tu’s wings had made up for it.

After all, Long Chen had many offensive techniques but only very few defensive techniques. Most of the time, he wouldn’t use defensive techniques himself. But if there were ever allies beside him in combat, he would be at a loss without any powerful defensive techniques, especially a defensive technique that could cover a wide area.

Now, that gap was filled, causing Long Chen to feel even greater confidence. He could attack, defend, and now even flee. He had no further misgivings.

Seven days later, Long Chen had mastered the runes on the wings and left his spiritual seal imprinted within each one. There were Huo Linger and Lei Linger’s spiritual seals in them as well. That way, he could allow Lei Linger and Huo Linger to control them.

Long Chen stood in the air with the Kunpeng wings behind him. As they fused into his body, a wild hurricane erupted. The wings gleamed with resplendent divine light, radiating a brilliance akin to a blazing sun. Long Chen, enveloped by the sacred aura, now looked just like a heavenly god.

“Hahaha, I’m ready! Qingxuan, I’m coming!”

Long Chen raised his head and laughed. With a quiver from the Kunpeng wings, he instantly vanished.
