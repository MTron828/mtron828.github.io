Chapter 4111 Dark Domain Lord

One Heaven Venerate after another was shot through the head by Guo Ran’s arrows. Not one of his arrows failed to kill their target.

“One, two… ten, twenty… there are over a hundred of them!” Guo Ran’s expression changed. If this many Heaven Venerate creatures attacked at once, there was no stopping them.

“Don’t worry. Draw them into the range of the formation!” shouted Xia Chen.

The next moment, the formation quivered, and rays of light gathered into a Yin Yang double dragon spear.

BOOM!

The Yin Yang double dragon spear was aimed at a Heaven Venerate dark creature. Upon impact, the ground burst open, forming a massive crater. The surrounding creatures were shattered by the blast, yet the targeted Heaven Venerate creature, although injured, managed to survive the attack.

However, Guo Ran shot one of his normal arrows at it, killing it in its heavily injured state.

“The Yin Yang Heaven Hegemon Formation is focused on defense, so its offensive power is only at this level.” Xia Chen sighed helplessly when he saw that he was unable to kill his target in one blow.

In truth, the Yin Yang Heaven Hegemon Formation was capable of both offense and defense. But the cost of doing such a thing was so great that Xia Chen couldn’t afford it. Thus, he had sacrificed its offensive power for defense.

Just then, a Heaven Venerate creature reached the formation, and its sharp claws raked the formation.

The Fullmoon experts were originally worried that the formation would be instantly destroyed. But unexpectedly, the strike merely caused a minor sound, and the creature was blown back. Its arm was badly mangled.

“The test is complete. As long as five hundred of these Heaven Venerate creatures do not attack at once, the formation can hold! Boss, go ahead and slaughter them!” shouted Xia Chen.

This was Xia Chen’s first time constructing this kind of legendary grand formation, so all its effects needed to be tested first as verification.

Upon seeing that this Heaven Venerate creature’s all-out attack was unable to even shake the formation, Xia Chen instantly relaxed.

Long Chen was also put at ease. After that, his divine ring appeared behind him, and golden scales covered his body. As this transformation occurred, a majestic dragon cry reverberated across heaven and earth, and his sacred dragon might radiated throughout this world.

At this moment, the Fullmoon experts felt their souls quiver. Long Chen’s sacred dragon might was so powerful that even they were affected.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

Long Chen's voice boomed like thunder as a massive dragon claw extended from his divine ring, crashing down with immense power. At this moment, dozens of Heaven Venerates were charging at Long Chen.

Not holding back, he sent the dragon claw smashing down, crushing those creatures.

When it was done, the dragon claw vanished, leaving its imprint on the ground. Within that imprint, everyone could see dozens of Heaven Venerate corpses, their bodies completely flattened and their auras gone.

“Their physical bodies aren’t destroyed, but their souls have dissipated. They didn’t die to my power. but rather, to the impact of the dragon soul.”

Long Chen simply waved his hand and threw the corpses into the primal chaos space. After examining them for a moment, he came to a surprising conclusion.

“Could it be that the sacred dragon might is also effective against them?”

“Boss, watch out!”

Just then, arrows flew by Long Chen’s body. While Long Chen was lost in thought, three other Heaven Venerate creatures attacked him from behind.

Those three Heaven Venerate creatures were instantly slain by Guo Ran, but Guo Ran also lost three Golden God Slayer Divine Arrows.

“I’ll know once I test it. Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens!”

Long Chen abruptly stretched out his arms, emitting a resounding roar that echoed majestically across the world. Once again, the sacred dragon's cry reverberated, and a soundwave emanated in all directions from Long Chen.

Following that, people saw an absolutely shocking scene. Countless dark creatures directly collapsed upon contact with that soundwave.

Even Heaven Venerate dark creatures swayed from the impact of Long Chen’s roar. It was like they were drunk, staggering and falling.

With one roar, all everyone saw was the unending spread of corpses. To their surprise, this one roar had directly annihilated millions and millions of dark creatures.

“How can this be possible?! His sacred pressure can even compete with the race leader’s when supported by the ancestral spirit totem!” exclaimed an elder of the Fullmoon race in disbelief.

“Also, he’s human and not from the dragon race. But even if he were a true dragon, he still wouldn’t necessarily possess such a powerful sacred dragon might!”

Looking at the corpses littering the ground, everyone was stunned, even the Dragonblood warriors. They hadn’t expected such terrifying dark creatures to be killed by a single roar from their boss.

“Cough, cough…” Long Chen suddenly had an intense coughing fit. He had been too excited, and the roar broke his throat.

After that, he formed hand seals, and flames covered the land. The Heaven Venerate creatures were then pierced through the head by flame arrows and died.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They might have survived the Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens, but their souls were in disarray because of it. Hence, they were unable to dodge or defend, and were easily slain.

The flames covering the land vanished along with the corpses, drawn into the primal chaos space.

Now, Long Chen had too many corpses, to the extent that the enormous area of black soil had a mountain of corpses piled on top of it. Even with the black soil’s devouring power, it would take some time to devour all of them.

Thinking that he could now take a break, Long Chen relaxed a bit. However, his heart suddenly shuddered, and a terrifying feeling of death enveloped him. He almost instinctively roared, unleashing his remaining dragon energy into a kick behind him. It was the dragon race’s divine ability: Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum.

BOOM!

A giant dragon tail shattered the dome of the heavens, and its cracks spread in every direction. From that shattered space, they saw a dark creature that looked as if it was made of gold.

The previous Heaven Venerate creatures only had golden runes on parts of their heads. But this one was covered in golden runes. Furthermore, it had six arms, not four.

Long Chen coughed up blood and flew back, feeling like he had just kicked a star. All his bones shattered from the impact.

“A dark domain lord!”

When they saw the six-armed monster, the Fullmoon experts turned pale with fright.
