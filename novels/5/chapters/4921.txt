Chapter 4910: Losing Control

Being locked by Long Chen’s killing intent, the masked man didn’t show any hint of panic. It was as if he didn’t care about Long Chen or Mo Nian at all.

He sneered, “You’re too stupid. Can you not tell that I’ve gained control over this corpse? Even if you join forces, you aren’t a match for me.”

Long Chen didn’t waste words with the masked man. With stars flowing along Evilmoon, he directly attacked.

BOOM!

The masked man didn’t move. When Long Chen’s saber struck him, his mask simply quivered. After that, Long Chen felt all the power behind his attack suddenly vanished without a trace.

Long Chen was stunned, having never experienced such a situation before. Suddenly, his opponent's mask flared, unleashing a berserk power that surged through Evilmoon and struck Long Chen with force. Long Chen’s arms shuddered, and he spat out a mouthful of blood as he was knocked back.

“What’s going on? Is he really in control over this corpse?!” transmitted Long Chen. Mo Nian had spent so much time and effort without managing to take control of the corpse, so how had this masked man done it so easily?

After all, this was an Emperor devil corpse. If the masked man was really capable of using its power, he would be unmatched; no one could possibly beat him.

Although Long Chen’s attack had been more of a probing blow than a full-power attack, the difference between the two forces was too immense.

“Don’t overestimate your power. Don’t you know that an ant won’t be able to shake a tree no matter what?” sneered the masked man.

“Do you know how to deal with him?” Long Chen asked Mo Nian.

Long Chen was enraged by the masked man’s provocation, but the latter was protected by the devil corpse’s power, so Long Chen couldn’t harm him.

If Long Chen were to go all-out, all he would be doing was exhausting his own energy. If executed badly, he would die at this fellow’s counterattack.

“Only the Emperor arrow can have any effect against him. However, with my power, I cannot use it,” said Mo Nian.

Mo Nian had plucked the Emperor arrow from the corpse, but as soon as it was pulled out, it entered a state of slumber. The only option was to wait for it to gather enough energy to naturally awaken or to employ an external force to startle it awake. However, with Mo Nian’s power, he couldn’t rouse it awake.

“This time, we are really in trouble,” said Long Chen as he eyed the masked man, who was surrounded by devil qi. His heart sank.

Neither Mo Nian nor Long Chen had any plans. Even with all their wits, they couldn’t think of anything.

Just then, another figure appeared on top of the devil corpse. He was the devil expert, who had just fled.

When Huo Qianwu tried to self-detonate, he fled in terror, afraid of being dragged by it. However, after there was no explosion for a long time, he ran back.

“Damn you! Return my ancestor’s legacy!”

The devil expert immediately roared and attacked the masked man with his serpentine spear.

Seeing the devil expert, the masked man showed no intention of dodging. He simply let the spear stab his chest.

However, Long Chen, Mo Nian, and even the masked man were all shocked to see the spear pierce through the corpse’s protective devil light.

“Hahaha, you fool, this is my ancestor’s corpse! Did you think its power would protect you?!” The devil expert smiled sinisterly and pushed his spear in deeper.

BOOM!

The devil expert grunted and was suddenly blown back. While blood stained the spear, based on the residue, it only penetrated about an inch into the masked man’s chest.

Long Chen and Mo Nian were shocked. This serpentine spear was a terrifying Heaven Saint divine weapon. It had clearly broken the masked man’s defenses but was still unable to pierce through him. Was his physical body just as terrifying as Long Chen’s?

“No, he has a soft armor around him!” Mo Nian noted the faintest light coming from around the masked man’s wound. It was most likely a metallic glint.

The masked man looked down at his wound and then at the devil expert, his voice growing darker. “So it really was your ancestor. Good, I can use your blood to form a seal and gain full control over this corpse.”

A Heavenly Fate Disk appeared behind the masked man, and the figure of a headless corpse manifested within it.

“So he got here even before me!” exclaimed Mo Nian in shock.

“But of course. Three generations of my family have left their own mark on this devil corpse. The rewards were only reaped now, in my generation. How else do you think I gained control over it so quickly?” sneered the masked man.

As the masked man activated his Heavenly Fate Disk, the devil corpse shook intensely. Countless devil runes spread throughout its limbs, wings, and neck, gathering where he was.

The masked man’s aura climbed crazily, accompanied by the growth of his Heavenly Fate Disk. The blurry devil corpse figure in it gradually grew clear.

“We have to stop him!” exclaimed Long Chen gravely.

“The main thing is that there’s nothing we can do!” Mo Nian was also anxious, but he really was out of tricks. If this fellow was in control of the devil corpse, then that meant he had no weaknesses.

Long Chen took a deep breath. Retrieving an eyepatch, he covered one eye, then closed them both. When he opened the uncovered eye, its pupil was black.

Long Chen had no idea if his Purgatory Eyes could restrain the masked man, but he had to try it. The Earth Cauldron couldn’t be used for killing, Dragonbone Evilmoon had yet to gain full control over its body, and Long Chen had yet to master his Eight Star Battle Armor. Against an Emperor corpse, everything else he possessed was ineffective, except for his Purgatory Eyes perhaps.

Despite understanding the risks of invoking the Purgatory Eyes, as it could empower his inner demons, Long Chen couldn’t afford to worry about it too much.

Just as Long Chen was about to unleash the Purgatory Eyes, the devil expert’s sinister laughter rang out from the distance. With his hands forming a strange seal, he condensed a blood globe in front of him.

“Die! Evil Blood Devil Sacrifice!”

This blood, freshly stained on his spear, belonged to the masked man. As his hand seals shifted, the blood splashed onto the devil corpse, plunging the world into an eerie silence.

When the devil corpse absorbed the blood, the masked man let out a startled cry. The energy pouring into him suddenly reversed course, with even his essence blood being voraciously devoured by the devil corpse.

BOOM!

With a furious roar, the masked man summoned three divine rings above his head. At the same time, three rings also appeared on top of the devil corpse.

“Don’t give up! Hold on!” Mo Nian shouted, pleasantly surprised.

Just as he said this, the masked man’s three divine rings exploded, and the devil corpse was freed of its bindings. A sinister aura directly erupted, blasting Long Chen and the others away.

“It’s over. It’s completely out of control!” Mo Nian shouted, despairing.
