Chapter 4295: Long Zhantian’s Mind

“Dad!”

At the Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s branch of the High Firmament Academy, over five thousand Dragonblood warriors stood and shouted in unison.

“Good, good, you are all my sons! I didn’t expect to gain so many sons at once after being separated from my first son. The heavens are compensating me,” said Long Zhantian emotionally.

As he saw the Dragonblood warriors, a wave of emotion washed over him, his eyes tinged with a hint of red. Long Chen knew that this scene stirred his father’s deep-seated memories.

Long Zhantian, too, had once led a Heavenly Dragon Legion, sharing camaraderie with a band of devoted brothers who stood by his side in countless battles. He had also once been a high-spirited young man who fearlessly charged through all obstacles in his path.

The scene before him was similar, but the people were different. All the brothers who had once fought alongside Long Zhantian had been slain by the Long family. Thinking about this, Long Chen felt a sharp pain in his heart. His father had suffered far more than him, enduring an ordeal he didn’t dare to even imagine.

If one day he was imprisoned and came out to find that the only survivor of the Dragonblood Legion was himself, he didn’t know whether he would have the courage to keep living.

“Uncle.”

Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan also came forward, their movements a bit awkward. After all, Long Zhantian was their future father-in-law, so they were shy in front of him.

“Rise, rise!” Long Zhantian hastily lifted the two of them up, smiling. “Good children. You must have suffered quite a bit with Chen-er. It’s been hard on you.”

“Uncle, no matter how much bitterness we have to go through, we would be delighted to stay with Long Chen,” said Yu Qingxuan hastily. Bai Shishi, on the other hand, was so nervous that she couldn’t even speak. She just nodded from the side.

“It is the blessing of many generations for my Long family to have such fairy-like daughters-in-law, and not just one, but two! Good, very good.” Long Zhantian nodded, very pleased with these two future daughters-in-law. His son’s vision really was impeccable.

“Dad, this is only two of them,” said Long Chen awkwardly.

Long Zhantian was startled for a bit and then laughed, making Long Chen feel even more embarrassed. He could only laugh along foolishly.

After introducing his father to his brothers and lovers, seeing that he was weary, Long Chen brought him to his room to rest.

This branch academy had just been activated, and many areas were still in the midst of construction. However, the constructors prioritized arranging a place for Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion.

Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan kept following behind Long Chen, making Long Zhantian feel bad. Hence, he gave Long Chen a look. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Long Chen immediately understood and made an excuse that his father needed to recover from his wounds, and only then did Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan leave. They then sighed with relief. From the start, the two were so nervous that they barely dared to breathe, feeling even more tense than they had been during the Sage King Convention.

“As expected of my son.” Long Zhantian smiled and gave Long Chen a thumbs-up.

Long Chen didn’t know if his father was praising him for having multiple lovers or many brothers. He only laughed awkwardly and scratched his head, not knowing how to reply.

“Dad, you should rest. I’ll give you a soul calming pill that can make you rest more comfortably,” said Long Chen.

After all, Long Zhantian just had his essence blood extracted by the Long clan again today, and the day had been very tumultuous. He must be weary. Most cultivators would probably be unable to endure it, let alone him in his weak state.

“I am not as weak as you think. Now that it’s just us father and son, tell me what happened during these years.” Long Zhantian looked at Long Chen with pride and love, as well as a hint of weariness and helplessness.

Thus, Long Chen began to narrate how he had grown up in the Long family in the Phoenix Cry Empire, his journey to the Xuantian Monastery, and his arrival in the Xuantian Dao Sect. He then recounted his involvement in the battles between the Righteous and Corrupt paths, not forgetting to also share how he had encountered his lovers and brothers. Eventually, his narrative led to his ascension to the immortal world.

To his father, Long Chen didn’t hold the slightest bit back. He told him all his secrets without any misgivings, including his status as a nine star heir.

Long Chen was well aware that his father’s fate was tied to his own, so there was no such thing as infecting him with karma. Any karma had long since infected him.

Long Zhantian didn’t speak and just let Long Chen talk all the way until he suddenly asked, “Is your maternal grandfather well?”

Long Chen was startled and realized that his storytelling had jumped from point to point so much that he had neglected certain things. He had only casually mentioned his mother’s family once.

Seeing Long Zhantian’s somewhat apprehensive appearance, Long Chen came to realize that even his father was scared to see his father-in-law.

Long Chen smiled. “Grandfather is doing very well. He also treats me very well.”

“Really?” Long Zhantian was pleased beyond expectation.

Back then, Long Zhantian had heard from the mouth of Long Chen’s mother that his father-in-law was incredibly domineering and unreasonable. Hence, Long Zhantian never knew how he was supposed to face his father-in-law. Unexpectedly, this matter was already dealt with by his son.

Long Chen immediately explained how he had gone to the Luo family and been tested by his grandfather, and in the end, Luo Zichuan left the Luo family to him while he went to resolve the problem of his ancestors being trapped in a crack within space.

When Long Zhantian learned that Luo Ningshuang’s marriage was related to the future rise or fall of the entire Luo family, of the entire Violet Blood race, Long Zhantian finally understood why his father-in-law would be so unreasonable.

“Chen-er, you’ve done very well.” Long Zhantian patted Long Chen’s shoulder. Long Chen had helped Luo Zichuan open the spatial gate and accomplish the mission of the Luo family. Then Luo Ningshuang was not a sinner, and the two of them, husband and wife, could once more face the Luo family directly. That knot was directly resolved.

“It is only to be expected of your son,” said Long Chen hastily. He was happy that his father was happy.

Long Zhantian then listened as Long Chen told him about the state of the nine heavens, the conflicts between the various races, and the current situation of the human race.

Long Zhantian had been imprisoned ever since he came to the immortal world, so he had no idea what kind of state the immortal world was in. But through Long Chen, he came to understand this world.

After all, Long Chen had been fighting his way forward ever since he was in the mortal world, slaughtering many experts from various races. As a result, his viewpoint was very comprehensive. He had also read many ancient tomes relating to the nine heavens. Thus, he was able to answer essentially all of Long Zhantian’s questions.

Long Zhantian was extremely pleased with his son’s knowledge and occasionally praised him. Through his son, he came to gain a general understanding of the state of the immortal world.

“Dad, once I become a World King, let’s go search for mom. I miss her, and I believe that she misses us too,” said Long Chen emotionally.

“Good child, just focus on your cultivation. You have many more important things to do. Leave your mother’s matter to me,” said Long Zhantian, patting Long Chen’s shoulder.

“Dad, you…!” Long Chen was startled.
