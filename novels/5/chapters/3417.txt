Chapter 3406 Full Cultivation of Seven Powers

The stone gate was three hundred meters tall and was covered in runes. Some runes started off translucent, but once they glowed, they revealed different colors.

This was a testing gate specialized for evaluating Four Peak experts. The Four Peak realm involved raising four powers within the body to the very peak, and these four peaks decided their future cultivation path.

Furthermore, there were also priorities amongst the four peaks. However, this test only evaluated the flesh, tendons, bones, blood, qi, soul, and essence. As for metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, lightning, light, dark, and other elements, they weren’t tested for.

That was because the seven powers of the flesh, tendons, bones, blood, qi, soul, and essence were the most basic powers. They were the foundation, and those elemental attributes were built on top of this foundation. The Sacred Pill Hall’s test only measured a person’s potential, not their destructive power, so there was no need to know their element.

Long Chen stood before the testing gate. After that, an expert told him what to do. He had to spread his arms and turn his back toward the gate. When its power entered his body, he shouldn’t resist. Otherwise, it would instantly throw the test into chaos, and it might even make his body directly explode. If he didn’t want to die, he shouldn’t mess around.

Long Chen had countless gazes on him. Amongst them were half-step World Kings. Long Chen then saw the two elders of the Lightning Falcon race. They were sneering at him, clearly not having a good opinion of him.

However, there were other elders with them this time. One of them had an aura as deep as the vast cosmos. Long Chen’s heart shook. This was a true World King.

This World King was staring at him. He then narrowed his eyes and asked the person beside him, “Is this the person that Yuner settled on?”

“Yes, the princess fancies him. The two of us tried to advise her, but she cursed us. Leader, the princess’s temper needs to be reserved a bit. If this continues, there will be no way to handle her,” said one of those elders that Lei Yuner had driven off.

This World King was the leader of the Lightning Falcon race. When he heard that response, he shook his head.

“This little fellow is definitely not bad. Yuner isn’t so rude. Perhaps you misunderstood her.”

“Leader, by protecting the princess this much, you are encouraging her arrogance! She’ll do something majorly wrong sooner or later!” said the elder.

“Oh?” The race leader’s expression sank. “What major affair will she ruin? The Mammoth Divine Elephant race isn’t anything good. Even if we were to mate with them, everything must be considered at length. For you to be so anxious, just how many benefits have you gained from the Mammoth Divine Elephant race?”

“Race leader, calm your rage. We are just thinking about the Lightning Falcon race!” declared both of them hastily.

“Hmph, don’t think that others don’t know about those little movements of yours. Don’t let me catch any evidence, or even half-step World King experts like you two will be punished severely. Get away from me. You’re making others laugh at us,” said the leader of the Lightning Falcon race coldly.

The two of them dejectedly left, no longer daring to say anything. But this conversation was carried out with their innate divine abilities, so others were unable to hear it.

Just then, the test started. Everyone’s attention turned to Long Chen, and he spread his arms. After that, divine light covered him.

Long Chen clearly felt traces of energy slowly entering his body. This energy wasn’t hostile as it was just a simple test.

As the light covered him, tens of thousands of runes lit up on the stone gate. Rainbow light then filled the sky.

“How… how can this be?!”

Lei Yuner was astonished. Furthermore, it wasn’t just Lei Yuner. Every single person here was dumbfounded.

“In the Four Peak realm, isn’t it only possible for four runes to light up?” People stared in disbelief.

“Is it a problem with the testing gate?” People couldn’t help turning to the experts in charge of the gate.

These experts from the Sacred Pill Hall were even more shocked than the others. Such a thing had never occurred before.

“The testing gate is operating regularly.”

Those experts closely examined the testing gate. They had checked it carefully, but it was still all seven runes shining together.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Could it be that he cultivates all seven aspects together?”

“How is that possible? In the tribulation, it’s only possible to grasp four Heavenly Dao runes. The tribulation will disappear afterward. Where did he get the other three runes?”

This was simply impossible as it was common knowledge in the cultivation world. All races were the same, without any exception.

“Then how do you explain this situation?”

“Well…”

Just as everyone was dumbfounded and discussing, the experts of the Sacred Pill Hall finished talking and one of them announced, “Everyone, don’t randomly guess. We will increase the power of the testing gate. Which of the seven powers is stronger and weaker will naturally appear.”

Just then, the light enveloping Long Chen shuddered, and he felt his body tighten. It felt like countless thin tentacles were roving within his flesh.

Due to there still being no malice, Long Chen didn’t resist. He allowed them to search his body.

The testing gate continued to shake. The seven runes were still quivering and shining. They grew brighter and brighter until they were blinding.

“How can this be?!”

“The light intensity has reached the sixth level!”

“Did he really cultivate all seven powers at once?”

“Is he a monster?”

Everyone was shocked, even World Kings. Such a thing had never happened before.

It had to be known that the testing gates had nine levels of illumination. In comparison, that human that had drawn a warm welcome from the demonic beasts due to his powerful bloodline activating the green color had only reached the fifth level of illumination.

Now, Long Chen had reached the sixth level of all the runes, and blinding rainbow lights shone. Everyone didn’t get it. How could this be? Was someone really capable of breaking the laws of cultivation?

“Continue to increase the power,” said that expert of the Sacred Pill Hall, also feeling shocked. He refused to believe that someone could really cultivate all seven powers, breaking the laws of cultivation.

As a result, rumbling then rang out from within Long Chen’s body and his aura raged. The pressure increased on his body, provoking the power within him.

At this moment, divine light exploded out of the testing gate, and rainbow light illuminated the stars.

“Impossible!”

Deathly silence rang out. The Sacred Pill Hall’s experts were filled with disbelief.

“They are all at the ninth level?”

Lei Yuner’s eyes widened in astonishment. She then covered her mouth, feeling shocked but also delighted.
