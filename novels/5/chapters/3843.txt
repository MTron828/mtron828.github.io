Chapter 3832 Dual Yin Yang Trees

When the giant door opened, Long Chen and the others saw a dazzling golden world. And the first thing that their eyes fell on within this enormous space was a towering tree, a giant golden tree.

When they saw this enormous golden tree, Long Chen and Mo Nian’s eyes instantly lit up. They recognized this tree.

“The Fusang Tree!”

This was an enormous Fusang Tree whose entire body looked as if it had been made out of gold. All of its leaves were golden and had golden flames burning on them. It was the Sun Flame.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, this Sun Flame was not exactly the Sun Flame ranked sixth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. It was an embryonic version of the Sun Flame. The Sun Flame on the Heavenly Flame Rankings was a Sun Flame that had cultivated for millions and millions of years, experiencing breakthrough after breakthrough, tribulation after tribulation. In the end, it became the Sun Spirit.

The Sun Spirit was an existence that didn’t die even after having experienced nine heavenly tribulations. It was capable of grasping the luck of heaven and earth for itself and standing above the Heavenly Daos. The true Sun Flame was undying, an eternal existence that lasted as long as heaven and earth did.

All the top ten flames on the Heavenly Flame Rankings were eternal existences once they reached their strongest state. But it seemed that within the history of all the Heavenly Flames, the only one that was truly eternal was Yan Xu.

The other flames, such as the Heavenly Rainbow Flame or the Ice Soul Divine Flame, experienced countless nirvanic rebirths. Ultimately, they were unable to reach the level of being eternal.

Right now, the most shocking thing about this enormous Fusang Tree was that there were countless corpses on top of it. Those corpses were stuck motionlessly to the Fusang Tree’s leaves.

When the door was opened, a terrifying murderous aura exploded out. Many of the devil experts at the front coughed up blood from the impact.

The corpses here emitted terrifying pressures. Even from such a distance, they still found it hard to breathe.

After getting accustomed to this aura, the devil race’s experts slowly walked into this new world.

As for Mo Nian, he silently sent the flying shuttle in as well. Once they were inside, they saw that it was a world covered in a dome.

If this world shrank, it would be like a circular lamp cover, with the Fusang Tree being the lamp wick.

The walls also had countless corpses embedded within them. They belonged to various races, with some of them being strange races that no one had ever seen before. There were humans, beasts, devils, and more. Long Chen and the others couldn’t recognize them all.

But curiously, the beasts that should be enormous were only the size of a human when stuck into these walls.

The giant dragon, the barbarian elephant, the divine phoenix, the divine tortoise, and countless enormous descendants of those mythic creatures were buried here, but they were strangely the same size as the humans here.

All of these lifeforms had incomparably terrifying auras. Their cultivation bases were within the Divine Venerate realm. Although they were already dead, their auras were over a hundred times stronger than an ordinary Divine Venerate.

They had just entered when Mo Nian had the flying shuttle go around Shi Yang and the others. He looped all the way to the Fusang Tree. There were no evil corpses here, so no one noticed them.

Shi Yang and the others were still carefully examining the surroundings, but Mo Nian had brought them to the back of the Fusang Tree.

Once they got up close to the Fusang Tree, Long Chen found that the corpses stuck to it were even stronger than the ones on the walls. The pressure that they gave up was also greater.

Furthermore, the corpses on the Fusang Tree were life-like. Their expressions were still healthy like they were just sleeping. There wasn’t the slightest injury to their bodies.

At the start, the evil corpses that they had encountered were withered and even lacking limbs. And once they entered the main caves, the evil corpses were more complete but still had some damage to them.

Now, every corpse was so perfectly intact that it looked alive. Their skin was plump and healthy.

It had to be known that these were corpses from over a trillion years ago, but they were able to resist the erosion of time. Long Chen felt chills when he looked at these corpses.

This definitely didn’t make sense. As Long Chen and the others were getting closer and closer to a heaven-shaking secret, a haze of death was covering them.

“This Fusang Tree is still in a young state; its flame seedlings are listless. It’s as if all its energy is being absorbed by the corpses. But a single young Fusang Tree definitely can’t nourish the corpses of this many experts. There is probably something off down below,” observed Yue Xiaoqian.

There were easily millions of immemorial corpses on the tree. To manage to preserve this many terrifying corpses probably required an unimaginable amount of energy.

“This giant tree is still in a young state?” Guo Ran was speechless.

“Legend is that when the Fusang Tree reaches its full size, it can cover an entire star-field. Its flames can raise millions and millions of Golden Crows for generations. Based on the wrinkles on the bark, this Fusang Tree has lived for many years, but ultimately, it never grew that large. It is definitely related to the corpses. If my guess is correct, this Fusang Tree is a vector planted here for these corpses,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

Long Chen turned to Mo Nian. “Now, do you still believe that this heavenly tomb was made by the Heavenly Daos?”

Long Chen had sensed the whiff of a scheme at the start. He had felt that this heavenly tomb was not natural.

As for Mo Nian, as a master grave digger, he firmly believed that a heavenly tomb could not be altered by people. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a heavenly tomb.

However, more and more things showed that this heavenly tomb was not natural. It was not like the legendary heavenly tombs.

A heavenly tomb was the result of the Heavenly Daos’ compassion. They couldn’t endure letting those experts’ corpses rot in the wilderness, so they buried them, letting their heroic spirits rest in peace. They no longer needed to experience the pain of reincarnation. Once a peaceful era came, the heavenly tomb would collapse, and their heroic spirits would be reborn, enjoying an era of peace.

However, everything they were seeing in the heavenly tomb showed that Long Chen’s guess was closer to the truth. If there was truly someone capable of controlling the heroic spirits that the Heavenly Daos had buried, he didn’t quite dare to believe it. If someone could even control the Heavenly Daos, they would be the master of this world. They would be the Heavenly Daos. So why would they do all this?

If there was truly someone capable of creating a heavenly tomb, then the consequences of Long Chen and the others barging in like this were probably fatal. When Mo Nian thought of this, he felt a cold breeze on his back.

“Boss, look!” Xia Chen suddenly pointed.

Following his finger, Long Chen and the others saw a giant screen of light.

This screen of light was like a gate. Through this gate, they could see that the other side also had an enormous tree. This tree was as black as ink, and its leaves had black flames burning on them. It was the legendary Moon Tree.

“That… is the Heavenly Boundary Line,” said Mo Nian. This screen of light was the Heavenly Boundary Line that split the three thousand worlds, as well as the heavenly tomb, in two.

“The other side has the Moon Tree, and this side has the Fusang Tree. One Yin and one Yang facing each other. Yin and Yang cannot produce life without being together. Xiaoqian is correct, the real tomb is located below,” said Mo Nian, muttering as he eyed the Moon Tree.

“Who’s there?!”

Suddenly, Shi Yang shouted, causing Long Chen and the others to jump. Had they been noticed?
