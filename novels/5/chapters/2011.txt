Just after Long Chen left, space rumbled and more experts arrived. The leader of the ancient races, Long Juncang, had arrived with reinforcements from the ancient races.

However, he was too late. Considering the speed of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, there was no way they could catch up.

Peng Wanli was ashen with rage. He had never suffered something so frustrating in all his life. Right in front of him, his resources were stolen.

“Should we attack them?” asked Long Juncang.

The ancient races always let the Xuan Beasts take the lead. Moreover, the relationship between the two races had grown closer thanks to Long Chen. The Xuan Beasts had officially recognized the ancient races. However, they had yet to let them join them.

“Let Long Chen be arrogant for a while. Just relying on the two of us, we can’t fight against the Martial Heaven Alliance. This is clearly the Martial Heaven Alliance causing trouble. The Brahma secret realm is about to open, so they’re trying to make a counterplay,” said Peng Wanli.

If Qu Jianying was present, she would definitely sneer at them. This matter had nothing to do with the Martial Heaven Alliance. It had entirely been Long Chen’s idea. The brains of the Xuan Beasts were truly lacking.

“Go back and prepare all the elite disciples for the Brahma secret realm. Pill Valley is finally willing to pay such a price. We can’t stand on courtesy. As for Long Chen, let him be. After all, the Martial Heaven Alliance does not have the inheritance of a god. After the Brahma secret realm, all our disciples will have grown stronger, while they’ll still be stuck. The difference will gradually grow. Long Chen is a madman that no one wants to provoke. If we go all-out against him by ourselves, the others will just laugh at us. Heavenly Fate Island is the best example. The Martial Heaven Alliance can’t do anything about Pill Valley’s Brahma secret realm, so they’re just sending Long Chen to mess up our plans. We won’t let them achieve their goals. We will make sure to repay our losses and humiliation today a hundred times,” said Peng Wanli.

“Then about the Peng Emperor’s altar...?” said Long Juncang hesitatingly.

“Once the Brahma secret realm is over, the ceremony will begin. You can send a hundred elites from your side. As for whether or not they can accept the Peng Emperor’s blessing, it will be up to their luck,” said Peng Wanli.

“Many thanks!” Long Juncang was delighted to hear this.

The Peng Emperor had been the supreme expert of the Xuan Beasts. He had been one of the only existences in this world capable of challenging the Sovereigns. In history, only three such Emperors had appeared, and one was from the Xuan Beasts’ Kunpeng race.

“Once the Peng Emperor’s sacrificial ceremony is over, the Xuan Beasts will rise. The Martial Heaven Continent will be ours to rule. Remember, don’t trust the human race at any time,” said Peng Wanli.

“Understood.”

...

Long Chen brought the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race back to their territory in high spirits. They were all delighted. They had managed to vent some of their anger.

Long Chen had openly taken Peng Wanli’s resources, and Peng Wanli hadn’t even dared to do anything. He had just watched them leave. Remembering his furious expression, they all felt refreshed.

“Big brother Long Chen is amazing. That Peng Wanli didn’t even dare to attack us!” exclaimed Cloud excitedly.

“He truly didn’t dare to attack because we are now strong enough that he has to be restrained in front of us. Without enough time, he can’t possibly gather enough experts to attack us. If he had really wanted to fight, it wouldn’t have just been a fight between us. The entire Martial Heaven Alliance would join in. Yu Xiaoyun is currently in a weaker position, so he won’t fight during this period. Both sides taking heavy losses is not what he wants. Although Peng Wanli is stupid, he can see this point, or he wouldn’t be fit to lead the Xuan Beasts. No matter how angry he was, he had to endure it. As for us, we had to do this to restore our prestige. This is an important day to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Considering how the Xuan Beasts have humiliated us, today was just some interest. As for the real debt, we’ll settle it later,” said Long Chen.

Cloud was extremely grateful. She knew that he was only getting involved in this matter because of her. He even treated the entire Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race as his family.

Considering the speed of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, they quickly returned. When Qu Jianying and the others saw the pile of resources they had brought back, they were stunned.

“You...”

“Ah, we robbed- cough, ah, we went to accept their gift!” Guo Ran immediately switched words upon being glared at by Long Chen.

When Qu Jianying and the others learned that Long Chen had gone to the Xuan Beasts’ headquarters and stolen the materials they had prepared for their reconstruction, they were shocked. They had originally thought that he would just cause some fuss throughout the Xuan Beasts’ territory in the Eastern Xuan Region. He might destroy a few buildings and strongholds as a show of might. Once they won back some face, that would be enough.

However, he had personally gone to their home and stolen their things right in front of Peng Wanli. The Xuan Beasts hadn’t even dared to do anything. This was their first time feeling a trace of sympathy for Peng Wanli.

Considering Peng Wanli’s unreasonable and tyrannical nature, he had probably never suffered like this in all his life. It was unknown if he would directly die from his rage.

This move shook the very continent. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was forcibly rising. Another terrifying faction had appeared on the continent, and they were solid allies with Long Chen.

The entire continent’s board changed because of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s domineering return.

Originally, Long Chen had just been planning on setting up a simple headquarters for the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, making it so that they could share a portion of the spirit gathering formations of the various sects.

However, with the gift the Xuan Beasts had given them, they directly built their own spirit gathering formations, transportation formations, and a grand protective formation. Moreover, there were plenty of workers. The Martial Heaven Alliance had never lacked manpower.

With so many materials, it would only take a month for the construction to be completed. The spirit gathering formations would only need half a month before they could be used.

Cultivating with spirit gathering formations meant that the world’s dense spiritual qi would pour into their bodies. This kind of blessing was unimaginable for the old Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Meng Qi was also sharing the Myriad Spirit Diagram with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, allowing them to rediscover their lost divine abilities. Each day, they got stronger. This filled them with confidence.

After arranging this, Long Chen had the Dragonblood Legion temporarily stay here. After all, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had yet to fully recover and needed some protection.

During this time, Long Chen encountered one difficulty. After advancing to the first Heavenstage of Life Star, his cultivation base hadn’t improved in the slightest.

He would need eleventh rank medicinal pills to advance any further. However, there were no eleventh rank medicinal pills in his Pill God memories. The pills that he had stolen also only reached the tenth tier. He had never seen an eleventh rank medicinal pill.

Could it be that the tenth tier was the limit? If that was the case, he was doomed. Others might be fine cultivating without medicinal pills, but he couldn’t.

The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s cultivation speed was already slow from the start. But now that he was in the Life Star realm, he had 108,000 astral spaces, and any advancement would be extremely difficult.

If he cultivated according to normal standards, he didn’t even know how many centuries it would take him to reach the second Heavenstage. By that time, it would be too late.

Long Chen bitterly wracked his brain, but he was unable to find any memories relating to eleventh tier medicinal pills. Helplessly, he could only go find Zheng Wenlong.

Zheng Wenlong told him that an eleventh tier medicinal pill had never publicly appeared in this world.

However, that didn’t represent that they didn’t exist. Zheng Wenlong secretly told him that it was rumored that Pill Valley had eleventh tier medicinal pills. However, it was just a guess. They had never personally seen any, so they couldn’t be sure.

Zheng Wenlong couldn’t know Pill Valley’s top secrets, so what he was saying was only what he had heard from his higher-ups. But there was no proof.

This news was of no help to Long Chen. Even if Pill Valley had formulas capable of refining eleventh tier medicinal pills, they were top secret. They were very likely only known by a handful of people. To obtain them wasn’t possible.

Helplessly, Long Chen could only cultivate within the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s spirit gathering formations. He activated his divine ring, absorbing as much spiritual qi as he could. After ten days, he felt like his astral spaces might have grown a bit larger, but he didn’t feel anything concrete. This speed was too slow.

Clearly, this kind of cultivation was no good for him. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was not cultivated like this. He had to rely on medicinal pills.

On this day, Long Chen left with Wilde. He brought Wilde to the Skyscraping World, having the original devil race’s people look after him. They needed to have someone go hunting with him so that he didn’t get lost.

He then left on his own. Long Chen had been hoping to spend a few days with Yue Xiaoqian, but she was already in seclusion.

Yue Xiaoqian had reached the final stages of the Profound Spirit Daoist Scripture. She was just one step from mastering it. That Profound Spirit Daoist Scripture had been a priceless treasure found within the Yin Yang World. Once she mastered it, she would be able to perfectly disguise herself and freely walk throughout the Martial Heaven Continent.

Time passed one day at a time, and undercurrents were flowing throughout the continent. The various large powers were gathering their geniuses and sending them to Pill Valley. The Brahma secret realm was about to open.
