Chapter 3618

The cry of alarm from the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch made everyone jump. They immediately gathered their forces to reinforce the Celestial Essence Domain.

Currently, within the entire Alldevil Star-Field, they only had the Heavenly Dragon Domain, the Celestial Essence Domain, and the Magnificent Heaven Domain. All three of them had powerful formations protecting them. They were also linked by transportation formations so that people could easily move between them.

The spatial channels between the three great domains were held in the hands of Xue Yifan, the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, and another half-step Divine Venerate. That was their lifeline. Other than the three of them, no one else could get close to those three major transportation formations. That was to prevent the Alldevil race from destroying them.

The Celestial Essence Domain was now under attack. Furthermore, the distress signal was already red. That meant that it was such a fierce attack that the formation was in danger of being destroyed.

The patriarch and the others quickly went through the transportation formation to reinforce the Celestial Essence Domain. But when they arrived, they found no enemy army at all.

The patriarch was infuriated. He roared, “Who lied about the situation and set off an alarm?! Get out here!”

“Patriarch… It wasn’t a lie. A powerful army did come. Look, the barrier is riddled with holes that are still slowly repairing,” reported one elder sincerely.

Looking over, the patriarch saw that the formation was at full power, and there were hundreds of giant holes in the barrier that were still in the midst of closing. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“To break through this formation, most likely only the Qingying Battleship is capable of it.” These horrifying holes made people gasp.

“That is what happened. The Luo clan mobilized seven of their Qingying Battleships at once. Adding on tens of thousands of other battleships and various devil beasts that covered the sky and the earth, their frontal assault instantly pierced through the formation,” reported the elder nervously.

The Celestial Essence Domain’s experts were all pale with lingering fear. That had truly been a terrifying experience just now. They had all thought that they were doomed.

“Then where are they?” asked the patriarch.

“They only attacked for a moment and suddenly left. We don’t know what they’re doing either,” answered the elder, just as lost.

“Not good. Are they trying to lure us away? Is their target the Magnificent Heaven Domain?” A half-step Divine Venerate’s expression changed.

Just then, someone’s tablet began to flash, making everyone jump. But then they saw that it was Xue Yifan’s tablet.

“Their target is the Heavenly Dragon Domain?”

“No, this isn't an alarm. It’s a projection mechanism…” Xue Yifan hastily waved his hand, indicating to not be so nervous.

Xue Yifan took his jade tablet off of his waist and placed it in midair. Forming hand seals, it suddenly unleashed divine light, forming a giant mirror in the sky. People then saw countless figures overflowing with explosive killing intent. The sound of a slaughter rang out.

“This is…”

“The Starry River Legion!”

…

Long Chen and the others were transported away to a large mountain range. This mountain range was made of stone with giant cliffs piercing the clouds. Every mountain had large caves from which battleships came out.

This was the Luo clan’s headquarters. It was also a treasured land of excellent fengshui that the Alldevil race provided them. There were all kinds of ores underground. Those ores could be refined into immortal metals used for forging battle armors and divine weapons.

It could be said that the Luo clan had an endless supply of resources here. That was why the Luo clan’s people and the people that had surrendered to the Luo clan were one level better equipped than the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College and the other powers.

It was thanks to this land of wealth that the Luo clan managed to secretly forge so many powerful battleships and battle armors in just a few short centuries. It was this land that caused countless people to despair and join the Luo clan’s side.

This was the secret base of the Luo clan. But today, Long Chen was directly transported here along with a hundred thousand starry river warriors.

Long Chen and the others had just arrived when the formations here sensed their auras. All the formations activated, causing a barrier to pop up throughout the mountains. It happened instantaneously.

Following that, an ear-piercing alarm rang out. Countless experts came flying out of the caves.

Long Chen directly struck the barrier with his black dagger. With a single cut, this formation that could even stop battleships had a giant hole cut into it.

“Kill these traitors that harm their own race!” Long Chen put away the dagger and took out the Minghong Saber. He then unleashed a slash.

BOOM!

This opening that could only fit a few people at a time instantly blew up. With an opening dozens of miles wide, Guo Ran and the others charged through.

“I swept through the four seas, crossed-”

“Shut up! Get killing!” Long Chen kicked Guo Ran before he could finish. Guo Ran wasn’t even done chanting before he was kicked into the enemy army. This fellow didn’t care about the situation when it came to showing off.

“Enemy attack!”

The Luo clan’s experts cried out.

In his battle armor, Guo Ran swept through his enemies. His voice was like thunder. “All of you remember my name! I am Guo Ran! I am cleaning the human race of its trash! When you meet the Yama King, make sure to report my name!”

Traitors were the most hateful existence, and they were even more hateful than the actual enemies. The people here were working hard on creating battle armors and divine weapons, tools that killed their fellow humans.

“Kill! Kill all of them!”

The hundred thousand starry river warriors were like tigers unleashed on a flock of sheep. Even if their battle armors and divine weapons were inferior to the other side, with the support of the starry river manifestation, these people were easily cut down.

Most importantly, the people here were not the main fighters. The true warriors had been dispatched by the Luo clan to attack the Celestial Essence Domain.

Hence, the starry river warriors killed them as easily as slaughtering chickens. With every slash of their weapons, blood flew and battle armors shattered. Even if the battle armors themselves could resist their attacks, the people inside were still killed by the impact.

These people didn’t even last a single breath’s time before they began to flee and cry for their fathers and mothers. Some people even knelt on the ground and begged for mercy. But the starry river warriors had no mercy. All they wanted was to kill them all.

As for Long Chen, once he entered the barrier, the first thing he did was to break all the transportation formations. He then looked at the mountains, examining the terrain. It seemed that he was looking for a suitable place for him to slash his saber.

In only a dozen breaths’ time, all the people outside were slain. There were still some people hiding within the caves, and the starry river warriors directly entered to kill them.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen’s saber fell and a huge mountain was cleanly cut apart. From the opening that he made, it was possible to see many levels inside the mountain. On the bottom few levels, there were piles of battleships, sets of armor, weapons, immortal metals, ores, and other treasures.

There were many incomplete battleships as well. When Guo Ran saw those treasures, his eyes instantly turned green with greed. Like a hungry wolf, he cried out, “We’ve struck gold!”
