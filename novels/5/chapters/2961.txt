Chapter 2950 Spending a Fortune

Long Chen entered the Divine Scripture Pavilion. As soon as he revealed his new instructor status plate, the disciples guarding the door no longer blocked him.

The inner academy’s Divine Scripture Pavilion was much more important than the one in the outer academy, so entering required a more stringent process. Long Chen went through three checks before getting in.

The size of it was about the same as in the outer academy. However, there were only a tenth of the books.

Many of the bookshelves were small, but beside the bookshelves were small rooms that could only fit a single person.

Those small rooms had a special spot to put a book in. As long as you put a book there, the formation would activate and help a person quickly memorize its contents.

All the books in the inner academy’s Divine Scripture Pavilion were very important. Some of them contained a huge amount of information that made them difficult to read.

The disciples would need to pay a hundred thousand immortal crystals for each trip here. But just entering that room cost ten thousand immortal crystals. It could be said that in the inner academy, you would have to burn even more money. Hence, many disciples were prepared to exhaust all of their Spiritual Strength for a trip to the Divine Scripture Pavilion so that they could learn as much as possible before leaving.

There was also no place to recover Spiritual Strength here, so most people used medicinal pills until their bodies could no longer endure it. It was truly a money-burning process.

Since Long Chen was now a Human-rank instructor, he could enter for free. But reading the books still cost money.

The inner academy’s elite disciples rarely used actual immortal crystals. They used crystal cards. To read a book, they needed to tap their crystal card on it. The money would then be deducted, and the book could be taken off of the shelf.

“What a con.”

Long Chen was originally filled with excitement, but now it was like a bucket of cold water had been poured on him. It was like he had been slapped out of his dream by reality.

He had thought that just like in the outer academy, he could use his abilities to consume all these books. He had wanted to read all of these books, but now he could only sigh. He didn’t have enough money.

Long Chen walked onward. He found that every book here cost at least ten thousand immortal crystals. It seemed that ten thousand was the cheapest, while some cost as much as fifty to sixty thousand.

“Why not just steal from your students!”

Long Chen cursed. But how could stealing be as fast as this? This was an unending stream of money for the academy. The academy’s method of raking in money was truly beyond the norm.

However, even though he complained, he still had to learn what he came here for. Even if the cost was extravagant, he still saw many people wandering around. Many of the rooms were even occupied.

He also saw quite a few people with pale faces, and they were bitterly enduring.

Long Chen nodded. Perhaps the high price for entry and learning was precisely what made people cherish their opportunities. People didn’t act like this in the outer academy.

Everyone was busy reading or recovering, and no one was looking at others. Seeing this, Long Chen sighed. Experts truly became strong because they worked harder than others.

Long Chen reached the fire element area quickly. Other places were filled with people, and the rooms sometimes even had lines.

However, there were clearly fewer people in this region. Although it wasn’t empty, there were definitely no lines.

“Fire Cloud Palm, 17000.”

“Exploding Blaze Fist, 20000.”

“Violet Flames Chain the Cosmos, 45000.”

Long Chen was speechless as he looked at these prices. They were too expensive.

However, even as he passed by these techniques, he didn’t see where the Nirvana Scripture was. Hence, his heart started to drop. The further he went, the higher the prices grew. He quickly reached existences costing over a hundred thousand.

At the end of the bookshelves, he saw a pillar that looked to be made of immortal gold. Runes were flickering on top of it, emitting terrifying fluctuations.

There were four squares embedded into it. Those were books covered in flickering flames as if they were burning.

“Nirvana Scripture!”

Long Chen was delighted to find it. Looking at the four books, he found that they were the first to fourth volumes of the Nirvana Scripture. Through the formation, he could sense the scripture within, and it felt so familiar.

“It really is the Nirvana Scripture. The first three volumes are the same.” Long Chen’s heart pounded. When he saw the price though, he almost broke into curses. “The first volume costs five hundred and fifty thousand, the second volume costs a million, the third volume costs one million five hundred thousand, and the fourth volume costs two million?!”

All together, they cost five million immortal crystals. This was an absolute scam. Was the academy so poor that it went crazy?

When he read what was carved on the pillar, he almost laughed. It read: The Nirvana Scripture is profound and difficult to comprehend. Even those with high comprehension will need to reread it multiple times in order to succeed. Take care. Be cautious.

In other words, to learn the Nirvana Scripture, it wouldn’t be possible to succeed in one go. You would need multiple attempts to fully comprehend it, along with multiple payments.

Thus, before learning anything here, you had to be mentally prepared. You might expend a terrifying number of immortal crystals without comprehending it. After failing to comprehend it dozens of times, would you be so angry that you smashed the bookshelf?

Perhaps the academy knew that, so they made it clear right from the start to avoid the dissatisfaction of the disciples. At this moment, Long Chen continued reading and found a delightful surprise.

The second volume contained the first volume’s contents. That was because the second volume’s scripture had to be paired with the first volume.

The fourth volume contained the first three volumes in it. In other words, he could directly buy the fourth volume and check if the first three volumes he had learned were identical to what was here. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It would have been too dangerous for him to only buy the fourth volume without checking if the first three were different here. This was no joke, as he could easily lose his life. But now he felt a bit better.

“Fuck, did they scheme against me? They saw me make a recent fortune, so they want me to spend it all?” Long Chen clenched his teeth and took out a crystal card.

This was a crystal card with two million and thirty thousand immortal crystals. This money was mostly from the Pill Institute. It was the reward for becoming a Human-rank instructor and then an Earth-rank instructor, as well as refining a one-star top grade pill and a one-star treasure pill.

For two million to be taken out at this time made his heart drip blood. But there was no way around it. He had to obtain the Nirvana Scripture no matter what.

Long Chen tapped his crystal card, leaving it with a balance of merely thirty thousand immortal crystals. Then the fourth volume of the Nirvana Scripture trembled, and a ball of light shot out of it, landing in his hand.

After that, the pillar slowly opened, revealing a room specifically prepared for disciples wishing to comprehend the Nirvana Scripture.

Holding the ball of light, Long Chen was about to enter when an icy voice rang out behind him.

“Hold it.”
