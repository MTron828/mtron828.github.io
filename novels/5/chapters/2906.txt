Chapter 2895 Cheating?

“What? Has something happened on your side?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“No, it’s your side that’s changed! Gu Fei led all his experts over to be Chu Kuang’s reinforcements. We basically have no opponents on our side. But we’ve already handed in our list, so we can't be your reinforcements. What can we do?” asked Luo Bing anxiously.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning had been waiting until the very last moment to come out of seclusion. However, they had never expected such a thing to occur.

Gu Fei had actually given up on the immortal competition. In other words, Luo Bing’s side could take the crown without any effort at all.

That made Luo Bing and Luo Ning feel like they had just unleashed a powerful punch on a ball of cotton. The feeling of having power but not being able to release it was difficult to bear. Furthermore, since they had handed in their list of attendance early on, they couldn’t help Long Chen. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When they learned that Chu Kuang had managed to form an alliance with all these experts just in order to obtain an absolute victory in the divine competition, Luo Bing was so anxious that her eyes reddened.

“It’s fine. Everything is within expectations. Let me tell you this: in front of absolute power, all schemes are meaningless. Don’t worry. With me here, you can rest assured. Watch out for them having some devious play on your side as well,” said Long Chen.

Seeing that Long Chen seemed prepared for this, Luo Bing felt better. She nodded and rushed back to the Immortal Institute with Luo Ning. Their competition was also starting soon.

However, with no Gu Fei on that side, there was absolutely no suspense over who would win. Thus, everyone in the academy came here to see the battle in the God Institute.

“Chu Kuang has come!”

An uproar erupted within the crowd when Chu Kuang walked into the plaza with a large group of experts. He had recovered his normal appearance. Furthermore, the divine energy fluctuations around his body had grown even more powerful.

“The God Institute’s Chu Kuang, the Immortal Institute’s Gu Fei, the Formation Institute’s Tang Yaochen, the Soul Institute’s Li Chengbei, and the various famous existences within multiple other institutes! Who would have thought that Chu Kuang could gather them all up today? This kind of lineup is enough to cause despair.”

“Not just that. Look at that red-haired fellow. Isn’t he that Xiang Kejie? He’s a fire element expert from the Five Elements Institute. He has made quite a reputation for himself in less than half a year in the academy. Also, there’s that green-eyed fellow with the hat, the one who looks demonic. He’s called Demon Eye Yang Fang. He’s also a frightening existence. Moreover, there are many other familiar faces. Although I don’t know all their names, they are all incredibly powerful. Chu Kuang really is shameless to gather them all.”

These experts that had joined the Prime Glory Alliance were all very powerful outer academy disciples within the High Firmament Academy. They all had their own reputation and fame.

At the same time as people sighed over the Chu family’s immense influence, they also felt immense disdain for Chu Kuang’s actions. So what if he won this battle? His reputation was completely wrecked now.

Mu Qingyun was infuriated upon seeing this lineup. Chu Kuang was absolutely shameless. This was practically cheating.

“Mu Qingyun, I heard that you’ve all been training as hard as you can? I can honestly tell you now that all your efforts were meaningless. This world’s opportunities only go to the strong. The rules are created by the strong in order to bind the weak to their whims. As for the strong, they are forever above the rules. You think you can become an elite inner academy disciple? Just keep dreaming. With me here, you will never achieve that dream in this lifetime. Those that refuse me, Chu Kuang, have also forfeited their futures,” said Chu Kuang arrogantly.

A hissing sound rang out from the crowd. Everyone had long since heard that Chu Kuang was unbridled and lecherous. He had over ten registered dual cultivation partners, but it was unknown just how many unregistered ones he had.

After Mu Qingyun rejected Chu Kuang, Chu Kuang turned her into an example, suppressing her this entire time. It was as if he was telling every female disciple that if they rejected him, they wouldn’t have a good ending.

“How shameless. Does he see women as playthings?”

“Some women are self-deprecating, as if they need to rely on men to cultivate. But even then, do they have to rely on such a vile person?”

“I heard that Chu Kuang had lost at Long Chen’s hands consecutively. Last time, he was even almost incinerated. But the heavens are really blind. Why not just let him die?”

Countless people were infuriated by Chu Kuang’s arrogance. While many women were embarrassed, the men also felt like Chu Kuang was provoking them, as if silently looking down on them for being powerless.

Mu Qingyun quivered with rage. Chu Kuang was too shameless. With such a giant power disparity, how could they fight?

Gu Fei, Tang Yaochen, Li Chengbei, they were all famous figures. Any one of them would cause Mu Qingyun’s side to fall to an absolute disadvantage.

Now that so many experts on this level had joined the Prime Glory Alliance, their side didn’t have the slightest chance. The rules of the academy were truly frustrating. How was this any different than cheating?

But if it was cheating, well, she could also cheat and invite outside reinforcements. But other than Luo Bing and Luo Ning, she had no reinforcements to draw on. Furthermore, the two of them had been included in Chu Kuang’s calculations and couldn’t come, so there was nothing she could do.

She was filled with fury but also helplessness. However, she suppressed her tears because she knew that would only make her even more aggrieved.

Seeing that she didn’t even dare to open her mouth for fear of crying, Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head. When could these children grow up?

He stepped forward and cupped his fists. “Hey, aren’t you the noble knight Chu Kuang who was almost incinerated and even slapped in the Discipline Institute but didn’t dare to even make a sound? That good brother who tucked his tail between his legs and fled? For someone about to be executed, you sure are arrogant, aren’t you?”

The infuriated Mu Qingyun instantly laughed, along with the other disciples of the Unfettered Alliance.

In fact, many of the other disciples also laughed in delight. These words were like blades slicing through Chu Kuang’s flesh. The way Long Chen could so solemnly call Chu Kuang a noble knight was particularly remarkable and filled with satire.

Considering how much Chu Kuang had infuriated everyone, even if it wasn’t funny, they would probably still make sure to laugh loudly.

“You!” Chu Kuang almost choked. He didn’t even have the ability to retort.

“Long Chen, you really are arrogant. In a bit, I’ll see if your abilities match the sharpness of your mouth,” said the red-haired man beside Chu Kuang. He disdainfully looked down on Long Chen, his gaze full of hostility.
