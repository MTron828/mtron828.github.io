Chapter 2564 The Martial Heaven Continent’s Reserves

Daoist Heavenly Feather came over, but she was still frighteningly icy, completely different from her normal refined and gentle self.

The Ice Qi swirling around her had dissipated, and she had returned the Northern Source Sword to Ye Zhiqiu. But even after exiting her combat state, her aura still pushed others away.

Everyone opened a path for her as she walked over, not daring to get close. Being too close caused their souls to shiver in pain.

Daoist Heavenly Feather’s questioning caused people’s hearts to shake. They looked at the Music Master.

The Music Master bowed slightly to Daoist Heavenly Feather. “Senior, please calm yourself. The Illusive Music Immortal Palace has naturally not forgotten our mission. Junior wanted to join in at the end, but the High Priest was even faster. I’m ashamed.”

Since the Music Master was acting deferential to Daoist Heavenly Feather, the others from the Illusive Music Immortal Palace were a bit displeased. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Daoist Heavenly Feather’s questioning felt very rude and had the tone of interrogation. It was almost tyrannical.

After that, Daoist Heavenly Feather stared at the Music Master for a long time before spitting out, “Do your best.”

The Music Master smiled and nodded. “Many thanks for your reminder, senior. Junior will remember it.”

Daoist Heavenly Feather nodded, turned, and took a single step, vanishing from sight.

“Apologies. The palace master has used her Source Qi, causing her to become unreasonable. I hope that the Music Master will not take this to heart.” A middle-aged woman of the Divine Ice Palace walked over and bowed to the Music Master.

This was a Grand Elder of the Divine Ice Palace, and she was the one who normally handled things there. Everyone with status on the Martial Heaven Continent recognized her.

“Of course. Everyone knows senior Heavenly Feather’s character. She is a respected senior. For her to educate this junior with a few words is only natural. Furthermore, she is correct. As a protector of the Martial Heaven Continent, we naturally must protect the continent’s safety. Long Chen and the others are the hope for the continent’s future, so we must protect them. The Illusive Music Immortal Palace will always be the Martial Heaven Continent’s sturdiest shield,” said the Music Master amicably. It seemed that she wasn’t afraid at all.

The Grand Elder nodded. After saying a few more courteous words, she turned to Ye Zhiqiu. “The palace master has used her source energy. You should avoid coming back for now, or it might cause some undue anger.”

Everyone was startled. It seemed that Daoist Heavenly Feather should not be disturbed after entering her combat state.

Long Chen had originally been thinking of going to the Divine Ice Palace with Ye Zhiqiu to pay his respects, but now it seemed that it would have to be set aside.

“Long Chen, you are the pillar of the Martial Heaven Continent, so you carry a heavy burden. Properly cultivate. When the great tribulation descends, everything will be up to you youngsters. We old fellows can only buy you some time. The countless lives on the Martial Heaven Continent are in the hands of your generation. Do not be reckless,” said the Music Master solemnly.

Long Chen looked at the Music Master’s eyes and patted his chest. “Senior, don’t worry, I will do my absolute best. However, I do not dare to go so far as to promise I will protect all lives in this world. Even for us, if we want to live, we must go all-out.”

The Music Master nodded and then left with her people. Zi Yan also followed, but then she turned back to wave at Long Chen with a blushing smile.

All the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s people had left. However, most people still felt profoundly shaken. Only today did they learn that the Illusive Music Immortal Palace and the Divine Ice Palace were so terrifying.

Based on Daoist Heavenly Feather’s words, it seemed that the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s Music Master also possessed the ability to block one of the divine families’ terrifying Heaven Merging experts.

“I never thought that the Martial Heaven Continent had such powerful reserves,” said Gu Yang.

Under the pressure of the divine families, the Divine Ice Palace, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, and the Wine God Palace had revealed their power. The High Priest in particular had also spoken to the divine families’ Lord Venerate and ended matters today.

Long Chen had killed Zhao Ritian and fought against three Sovereign sprouts. Everyone had personally witnessed his power. Therefore, it gave immense confidence to the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side.

Currently, the junior generation experts of the Martial Heaven Continent were growing stronger and stronger. They even had a leader like Long Chen capable of matching Sovereign sprouts. Moreover, behind him was the support of the Divine Ice Palace, the Wine God Palace, and the Illusive Music Immortal Palace. The Martial Heaven Continent was now unprecedentedly powerful.

“How regretful. If I knew we had such powerful support, I would have gone to kill some of those Sovereign sprouts’ personal warriors. Just looking at their arrogant appearances was annoying. We could have had a proper battle of generals against generals, soldiers against soldiers.” Guo Ran slapped his leg regretfully.

“It was best that you didn’t. Some trump cards should be kept in reserve,” said Gu Yang.

He was a bit more conservative than Guo Ran. The Dragonblood Legion’s new armor had raised their power, and he didn’t want to expose this trump card for nothing. If it was just fighting for prestige, that was meaningless.

“That’s right, it would be best if we didn’t reveal all our power. Next time we can catch them off guard,” said Li Qi.

Although the divine families had retreated this time, it didn’t mean that things were over. Ignoring the others, the Dragonblood Legion had definitely laid down an unending enmity with the Zhao family. It was unknown when they would fight again, so leaving some trump cards in their hands could save their lives.

Just as everyone was talking, Long Chen suddenly noticed that Yun Tian had left at some point.

“Brother Long, brother Yun Tian wanted me to pass on some words to you. He said that he has something very important to do, so he didn’t say goodbye.” Hu Feng walked over.

“He left again?”

Mo Nian and the others shook their heads. Yun Tian had been mysterious from start to finish. Last time, he had also suddenly vanished in the Star Field Divine World.

“Is he not afraid of the divine families sending experts to kill him?” wondered one person worriedly. The family head of the Zhao family in particular had been extremely resentful when leaving. It was unknown what she would do in retaliation.

“He is protected by a Sovereign mark. If someone tries to kill him, it will trigger its protection. It seems that within the domain of the Sovereign mark, everyone’s realms will be suppressed to the same as his. That Zhao family head would have died if she hadn’t retreated fast enough,” said an elder.

“Yes, that mark should be the legendary Sovereign’s protection.” Someone else nodded in agreement.

Although Sovereigns were unfathomable, there were many legends about them passed down from generation to generation.

No one knew Yun Tian’s true status, but that noble aura and refined grace of his was identical to the legendary Sovereigns. Everyone was sure that he was definitely a Sovereign sprout.

However, while they all recognized him as a Sovereign sprout, that did not mean that they thought he was a Sovereign’s son. The legends also said that the Sovereigns didn’t have any descendants. Anyone who could receive a Sovereign’s inheritance could be considered a Sovereign sprout.

Only now did Long Chen understand why the Zhao family head had been unable to receive a single blow from Yun Tian. So her realm had been suppressed to the Netherpassage realm, resulting in her almost dying.

“That Sovereign mark is amazing. Doesn’t that mean he can dominate the divine families?” Mo Nian’s eyes lit up. To suppress Heaven Merging experts to the Netherpassage realm was definitely badass.

“The Martial Heaven Continent’s Sovereign seals must be triggered by someone else to activate. Yun Tian’s Sovereign mark should be the same,” said Qu Jianying.

“Fine. That really is a pity,” sighed Mo Nian.

“Alliance head, old man, sorry to make you worry.” Long Chen hastily went to greet Qu Jianying and the old man. They were his seniors who always viewed him as family.

The old man patted Long Chen’s shoulder and laughed. “Good job. This is what a man is. This time was truly satisfying…”

Qu Jianying also reached out to straighten Long Chen’s collar. Long Chen was emotionally moved, but just at that moment, a sharp pain came from his ear. Qu Jianying’s warmth vanished, and she gnashed her teeth. “You little brat, when are you going to let people stop worrying about you? Do you know you almost scared me to death just now?”

“Why would you be worried? Those fellows were unable to do anything to me. Even if I couldn’t beat them, I could run.” Long Chen grimaced painfully. In truth, Qu Jianying was unable to harm him. After reaching the twelfth Heavenstage, his physical body was so powerful that unless Qu Jianying activated her own manifestation, she would only be able to tickle him.

However, to avoid embarrassing her, he acted like he was in pain. It went without saying that Long Chen’s acting skills were top-notch.

“I’m not even talking about them. Did I not tell you not to randomly guess things about the next realm? Did my words go in through one ear and out the other? You’re already grown up. You can’t act so recklessly.” Qu Jianying poked Long Chen’s forehead. Just now, the heavenly punishment had been the most frightening thing.

In every generation, the first one to expose the name of the Heaven Merging realm would be treated as someone exposing the secrets of the heavens, and they would be wiped out by the Heavenly Daos. Those people were given the title of guides, and all of them died with no exception.

“Cough… You should give the child some face in front of so many people,” advised the old man.

“What face? Did you warn him, hm?” raged Qu Jianying.

“Ah… maybe… possibly… perhaps… I should have?” The old man scratched his head.

“No, he definitely didn’t! I never heard him say anything about it!” said Bao Buping immediately.

The old man raged, ”Are you looking for a beating?!”

“You actually forgot about such an important matter?! I… Just wait, I’ll give you some face in front of everyone.” Qu Jianying turned green with rage. Not only had the old man forgotten to tell Long Chen about this, but he hadn’t even mentioned anything to the disciples of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect either.

“We’re family. Let’s return to the headquarters before discussing things further.” Li Tianxuan came forward to mediate things. Only then did Qu Jianying release Long Chen, but she still had a vicious glare when looking at the old man. After that, they returned to the headquarters of the Martial Heaven Alliance.
