Chapter 3625

Seeing Long Chen charging out, Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others were about to follow when Guo Ran raised his hand to stop them.

“Everyone, don’t be reckless. I am now the general of the Starry River Legion, and all orders will come from me. Boss is launching a preemptive attack to blunt their offense. We cannot mess around now that he has created this opportunity for us!” shouted Guo Ran.

Just as Guo Ran finished talking, Long Chen arrived in front of Alldevil Tianye. The Hongming Saber slashed down with a whistling gust, striking like lightning.

“A little human also dares to brandish their claws?”

Alldevil Tianye swung his staff, directly receiving Long Chen’s attack.

BOOM!

Two immense forces crashed together, unleashing a huge explosion. At this moment, the entire world seemed to flip. Flying sand and rubble blew through the air, and the earth was torn asunder. A huge wave of earth soared into the sky.

The devil beast army was impacted by this clash and came to a sudden stop. Countless giant figures were sent flying by the shockwaves, like boulders flying through the air.

As Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye’s power erupted like volcanoes, a pillar of Blood Qi soared into the heavens, piercing the very bindings of the world.

When their Blood Qi erupted, the whistling sound became an ear-piercing boom that caused the world to quiver.

“A little devil also dares to be arrogant? Is being a dog of Lord Brahma something to be proud of?” Long Chen pressed down on Alldevil Tianye’s staff and shouted.

“What nonsense are you shouting!? Lord Brahma simply has a collaboration with the Alldevil race. You dare to insult the Alldevil race’s name? What awaits you is only death!” roared Alldevil Tianye angrily. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Collaboration? What a huge joke. Your Alldevil race is treated like housepets to be raised by Lord Brahma. They’re sealed in trial regions and used like tools. You have the face to call it a collaboration?” sneered Long Chen.

Suddenly, an image appeared behind Long Chen. It was the image of that monster from the Alldevil race breaking free from its seal, cursing Lord Brahma, and slaughtering the disciples of Pill Valley before ultimately dying in Pill Valley.

This was precisely the scene from the mortal world when Long Chen had inadvertently unleashed a monster from the Alldevil race.

“Alldevil Flame Spirit Beast!”

When Alldevil Tianye saw that scene, his expression instantly changed. He recognized that monster.

“Do you see? The Alldevil race is nothing more than a pawn of Lord Brahma, no different than a dog. After being used, you’re tossed aside for his descendants to eat,” sneered Long Chen.

“Damn Brahma, you dare to treat my Alldevil race like this?!” roared Alldevil Tianye. “However, you’re nothing good either. Your human race should have never been born in this world. I will eradicate you from this world today.”

Alldevil Tianye roared and devil qi erupted out of his body, along with a manifestation. It was vaguely possible to see an ominous beast inside of it. That beast unleashed a desolate qi.

Following that, the earth was torn apart, while mountains and rivers quivered. People stared in horror at Alldevil Tianye. They were unable to imagine what kind of power this was.

“Starry Sea Births Violet Qi!”

Long Chen shouted. At this moment, his divine ring lit up behind him, and violet gi gushed out of it. A starry sea then appeared within his divine ring.

BOOM!

The void exploded, sending a ripple that spread like exploding fireworks. It was beautiful and dazzling, yet fatal. This violent force changed the terrain, and countless Alldevil experts were sent flying miserably, hacking up blood.

Alldevil Tianye was actually forced back just from Long Chen’s eruption of power. With every step he retreated, the land collapsed. Moreover, countless devil beasts were struck by the shockwaves and turned into blood mist.

Those devil beasts were all mid or late stage World Kings. But in front of the power exuded by the two of them, they were as weak as ants.

“Inferior human, you-!” Alldevil Tianye roared furiously. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to possess this much power. His aura was still in the midst of climbing to its peak when Long Chen interrupted him, making him unable to freely unleash his power. Thus, he was repeatedly forced back.

Just as he roared, Long Chen’s waiting left hand found the chance to slap him in the face.

Alldevil Tianye was originally being gradually forced back, but with this slap, he instantly lost his balance and was sent flying like a shooting star. He was like a meteor, leaving a bottomless ditch in the ground.

A batch of devil beasts in that area vanished. All of them were smashed to death by Alldevil Tianye.

“Humans are the spirit of ten thousand creatures, standing at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Daos. Moreover, you transform into human form yet call the human race inferior. Is your head full of crap?”

Long Chen appeared like a god when he slapped Alldevil Tianye. He was incredibly arrogant, truly like a divine being looking down on mortals. This slap was not just a simple slap on Alldevil Tianye’s face. It was also a slap that sent the fear in people’s hearts away, a slap that let them see the dawn of victory.

“Starry river warriors, follow me! Use the blood of our enemies as a testament to our heroism! We will protect the families that stand behind us. Avenge our ancestors! Kill!”

Seeing the moment arrive, Guo Ran’s saber came flying out of its sheath. He directly gave the order to charge, and his Devil Dragon Battle Armor lit up.

“Kill!”

Three hundred and sixty thousand starry river warriors roared together. Even in the face of endless devil beasts, they didn’t show any fear. What they had was overwhelming hatred. After fighting for countless years, the enmity between the two races had sunk into their souls.

“Warriors of the human race, the call of war summons us! This is our life-and-death battle! We will follow the path of experts, slaughtering our enemies! Our battleships will crush the bodies of our foes, our divine weapons will cut off their heads! We fight for our territory, we fight for our families, and we fight so that our descendants can grow in our homes! Kill!” The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch also gave his orders, and countless battleships flew out.

Even Xue Yifan and the other half-step Divine Venerates came out in their battle armors. A huge battle erupted.

This was a truly bloody battle. At this point, no one had any more fear. As long as they set foot on the battlefield, their lives were no longer their own. All they could do was do their best to slay more enemies.

The endless devil beast army also attacked under the leadership of the Alldevil experts.

The Alldevil race possessed the ability to transform. There were over ten million of them, every single one of them being a powerful expert.

“Split the Heavens!”

Guo Ran’s armor blazed. His black saber then pointed at the heavens and slashed down, forcibly tearing a path through the enemy army.

Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others followed close behind him. In a triangular formation, they stabbed into the enemy army.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a powerful explosion erupted. An Alldevil expert smashed his spear down, and over ten starry river warriors were blasted apart along with their battle armors. Seeing this, Guo Ran and the others were appalled.
