Chapter 3381 Terrifying Broken Sword

Long Chen carefully picked up the back side of the broken sword tip with two fingers. He was afraid of the sharp side. No matter what touched the sharp side, it would easily cut through it without the slightest friction.

It wasn’t heavy. In fact, it was as light as a feather. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be floating within the black sea.

Long Chen guessed that it was either the huge amount of sea monsters that had surged out, or perhaps the arrival of the Ghost Ship that had caused the water to surge, resulting in it floating into the bottom of the Ghost Ship. It then broke some parts of it, causing the Ghost Ship to break. After that, it pierced through his body.

Now that he thought about it, he felt a burst of fear. If it had instead pierced through his head, he would have died.

Most terrifying of all, it had come without any warning at all. Long Chen hadn’t sensed the danger at all when the sword pierced him. He didn’t know if it was because it couldn’t be sensed or because his senses were restricted within the black sea.

In any case, being trapped in the black sea this time truly frightened him. That feeling of powerlessness was like he had returned to his youth in the Phoenix Cry Empire and was being bullied by others. The feeling of having all his power stripped away from him was truly frightening.

Ming Cangyue took out a spear. This was the divine weapon of a god. But as soon as it touched the edge of the sword tip, it was severed. Moreover, she didn’t even feel the spear being cut. She might not have noticed it if she didn’t pay close attention.

All of them sucked in a cold gasp of air. They had never seen such a terrifying weapon.

“It looks like a sword tip, but its shape is a bit odd. It could also be part of a spearhead. There’s no way such a terrifying weapon is some nameless item. But it doesn’t release any aura at all. Other than by seeing it, there’s almost no way to sense it. It truly is bizarre.” Ming Cangyue eyed this three-inch-long fragment with confusion. Such a thing was outside the scope of her understanding.

“Take a look. Can this thing be used?” Long Chen grew excited when he saw that even the two of them were shocked by this weapon. It seemed that he had picked up a treasure this time.

“You got this thing through trading your life. How could we want it?” Leng Yueyan shook her head.

Long Chen’s expression stiffened. What kind of relationship did they have for her to say such a thing? Ming Cangyue laughed. “Fool, she’s teasing you.”

Long Chen looked at Leng Yueyan and truly did see a smile on her face, leaving him speechless. So even she had a teasing side. He was caught off-guard.

“However, we truly cannot keep such a thing. It gives me a bad feeling, and it’s not suitable for us. Our bone swords are our innate divine weapons, so we don’t need any other weapons in this lifetime. For it to run into you like that, it must have some destiny with you. You should keep it. As long as you can make a hilt that can hold it, you will have an incomparably sharp dagger. Don’t you have a more suitable person for it?” said Ming Cangyue.

With this reminder, Long Chen instantly thought of Dong Mingyu. For him, she had betrayed her own faith. She was that little girl that had made him into her whole life.

After thinking about it, Long Chen immediately called Changgong Hao over, asking him to create a wooden hilt. Now, Long Chen also suspected Changgong Hao of being an expert carpenter. He instantly understood all of Long Chen’s requirements.

In just a short two hours, a marvelous wooden hilt was made. Two sides pressed tightly against the flat side of the broken sword. It was extremely sturdy. Just like that, an unmatched dagger was born.

The shape was essentially the same as Dong Mingyu’s old dagger. Holding this dagger in his hand, Long Chen was very pleased. Dong Mingyu would definitely be happy with this dagger. In her hands, it would be able to unleash its maximum potential.

However, before encountering her, it would be a life-protecting trump card for him. Although Long Chen was only skilled at hacking people with his saber, this particular dagger had countless uses. At the very least, no formation was capable of trapping him now.

As for terrifying divine weapons, hehe, he could directly cut them apart with this dagger. This was practically cheating. Although he had almost lost his life, obtaining such a treasure in exchange could be said to be worth it.

After playing with the dagger, Long Chen put it away. He thought of the sea monster corpses.

The cores had been separated from their bodies. Ming Cangyue thought that Long Chen wanted to refine pills, so she had specifically ordered the cores to be picked out. After all, those cores were treasures to the Netherworld’s experts.

The powerful cores in particular could be directly absorbed to raise their cultivation base. Thus, those experts that Ming Cangyue ordered to do the work practically salivated over these cores. But they all knew that the cores belonged to Boss Long San, and they could not be touched.

However, what Ming Cangyue hadn’t expected was for Long Chen to ignore the cores and directly take away the corpses like they were treasures.

Long Chen couldn’t tell the cultivation bases of these sea monsters. However, the life energy that they released was much greater than Vile Dragon Valley’s black dragons.

As the corpses were devoured by the black soil, life energy reinvigorated the withered medicinal plants, Wood Foundation Divine Trees, and Devil Eye Water Lilies.

There were millions of these corpses. It took three days until they were fully devoured.

In just the first day, the primal chaos space was restored to its previous state. Furthermore, Long Chen’s wounds had fully healed.

On the second day, the Wood Foundation Divine Trees doubled in size and bore new fruit. It was the second generation Wood Foundation Divine Fruit.

On the third day, the Wood Foundation Divine Trees were three times their original size and bloomed once more. These corpses truly put in some work.

Other than the Wood Foundation Divine Trees, the Devil Eye Water Lilies also grew crazily. When they reached the third tier, their five lily seeds could be planted again. Long Chen directly took out the seeds and planted more of them.

There was now a pool within the primal chaos space with almost a hundred Devil Eye Water Lilies. But they had just been planted and had only produced flower buds due to running out of corpses to urge on their growth.

Despite that, Long Chen was very satisfied. His gains this time were rather unimaginable. Moreover, Ming Cangyue had gained six territories just like that. Those powers also had some other territories under their banners. Whether it was Long Chen or Ming Cangyue, they had profited immensely.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Long Chen was recuperating, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were busy taking over their new territories and gaining control over the laws of all these regions.

Once things settled down, Long Chen asked the two of them to accompany him in training once more. This time, he wanted to soar all the way to the great circle of the Four Peak realm.
