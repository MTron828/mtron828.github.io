Chapter 4283 Primal Chaos Divine Item Heavenly Devil Zither

This terrifying voice had come from the other side of the gate before. However, at that time, everyone’s focus had been on the Sage King martial stage. They guessed that it was the voice of an Eternal expert.

Now that they were right next to the gate, that voice was even clearer. The gate blocked most of its power, but they could still sense its terrifying Eternal fluctuations.

“Ignorant fool, if you have the guts, come out and fight! Let me see just how powerful an Eternal expert is!” shouted the palace master in response to this unknown lifeform’s provocation.

The palace master was a battle-hungry madman. Even in this battle, he hadn’t used his full power. As a result, he was displeased by the lack of opponents and wanted to fully vent.

Hearing this, the unknown lifeform on the other side of the gate seemed to be enraged and crazily attacked the gate. However, the gate simply rumbled without budging an inch.

Everyone was shocked by this. Even an Eternal expert was unable to open this gate? Just what did this gate signify?

“Lord Brahma’s schemes are never small. He used outside forces to forcibly activate the Sage King martial stage, wanting to use the power of karmic luck to open this gate. Unfortunately, he didn’t anticipate this plan being ruined by Long Chen. The gate only opened the slightest bit, causing primal chaos qi to pour out, filling the nine heavens. Also, before the primal chaos qi on both sides is stabilized, this gate cannot be opened. Long Chen has bought the human race quite a bit of time. At the very least, the human race will be able to freely absorb primal chaos qi to cultivate for a year. But with this one year of buffer time, the human race will be able to raise a group of powerful experts. At this moment, this was the best result possible.” Feng Xinyue examined the gate and smiled.

“Two of the primal chaos divine items have appeared, the Heaven Earth Cauldron and the Heavenly Devil Zither. The others will probably surface soon. A new era is coming, so powerful geniuses will rise and fight. However, the nine heavens and ten lands are still recuperating, yet a new primal chaos battle is on the horizon. It remains uncertain whether the nine heavens and ten lands will endure or vanish for all eternity.” Another voice rang out at this time.

“Dean!”

The academy’s disciples cried out. Dean Bai Letian had also appeared, and it seemed that he had been present this entire time.

Feng Xinyue shook her head. “In truth, of the ten primal chaos divine items, only the Heavenly Devil Zither has appeared. Furthermore, from what we saw, it seems to have recognized a master. That violet-robed woman should be one of Long Chen’s lovers, no? Wan-er, you should know her.”

“A violet-robed woman? Could it be…?”

“Zi Yan!”

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, and the others cried out at the same time. Only Zi Yan was known for wearing violet robes.

“If it really was Big Sister Zi Yan, why didn’t she greet us?” wondered Tang Wan-er disappointedly.

“Zi Yan was deceived by the Illusive Music Immortal Palace and fought against Long Chen several times. Perhaps she has yet to resolve that knot in her heart, so she doesn’t want to see us,” guessed Meng Qi.

Hearing that, everyone understood her feelings. Although Zi Yan had ultimately walked alongside Long Chen and fought alongside them in the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, they could still sense that Zi Yan didn’t fit in amongst them perfectly. After all, her inner self remained plagued by guilt and self-reproach. Meng Qi and the others even worried about her becoming bedeviled due to this burden.

If the person who had saved Long Chen was a violet-robed woman who had made one move and instantly vanished, unwilling to be seen by others, then it was most likely Zi Yan.

Upon coming to the conclusion that Zi Yan had saved Long Chen, their hearts relaxed. No matter what, Zi Yan would not harm Long Chen.

“If that violet-robed woman is this Zi Yan of yours, then she really is amazing. She has obtained the approval of the primal chaos divine item, the Heavenly Devil Zither. Although she only plucked a single string of her zither, that is proof that the Heavenly Devil Zither has recognized her as its master. The Heavenly Devil Zither is the only one of the ten supreme divine items to appear in full so far. As for Long Chen’s Earth Cauldron, it can only count as half right now. His Earth Cauldron is not a fighting weapon, so he cannot utilize its divine abilities. Right now, it can only be said that one and a half primal chaos divine items have appeared, as well as a bit,” said Feng Xinyue.

“What is that bit?” asked Tang Wan-er.

The Wind Sect’s disciples were quite different from the disciples of other sects. They got along very well with their sect master and didn’t hold back when speaking to her.

Feng Xinyue simply looked at Dong Mingyu and smiled, not saying anything. However, this one look was enough to shock Dong Mingyu. Actually, she had once asked her master about her dagger, but her master refused to tell her anything.

Now that Feng Xinyue said this, Dong Mingyu realized that the strange dagger that Long Chen had given her was actually a primal chaos divine item.

However, it was most likely only a fragment of the original. This explained its extraordinary power to pierce through anything. A warmth welled up within Dong Mingyu as she realized that Long Chen had bestowed such a precious artifact upon her. This act alone served as evidence that Long Chen had always cherished her deeply.

Meng Qi cupped her fists to Feng Xinyue respectfully. “Senior, you said that you were watching over us the entire time and that this was a test for Long Chen. What were the results of this test?”

Feng Xinyue smiled. “You’re all Wan-er’s sisters. We’re a family, so there’s no need to be bound by formality. Actually, it doesn’t really count as a test. We just want to see if Long Chen is worthy of us risking our lives for him. Also, Wan-er has long since told me everything about him. She praised him into the heavens, saying that he was the most charismatic man ever…”

“Master!”

Tang Wan-er cried out with embarrassment.

Feng Xinyue’s smiled and continued, “When I saw Long Chen, I found that he really was a man with shocking charisma. If I were still young, perhaps I’d also want to be Wan-er’s sister.”

“Then I’ll call you big sister in the future!” giggled Tang Wan-er.

Feng Xinyue lightly slapped Tang Wan-er’s rear. “You bad girl! Don’t mess around with seniority! Haha, getting back to the point, other than testing Long Chen’s aptitude, talent, and potential, what we cared most about was his character. Throughout history, the human race has produced no lack of shockingly talented heavenly geniuses or overwhelmingly intelligent strategists. However, the human race has never produced anyone capable of uniting the entire human race. All those heavenly geniuses lacked the charisma that made others willing to follow them to their deaths. Thus, the human race has always been a plate of loose sand, unable to come together. That is the only reason the human race is bullied by the other races and has declined to the point of being on its last breaths.”

Tang Wan-er giggled and asked, “So what were the results of the test?”

“Did you not see for yourself? Even people who didn’t know him were willing to risk their lives for him. Is there any need for us to say anything more?” Feng Xinyue looked at the people by the Dragonblood Legion’s side.

“We are willing to risk our lives for Brother Long because he is willing to do the same for us. We are all true brothers!” shouted one of those experts.

Even in front of experts like Feng Xinyue and Ye Wusheng, these people still let out a loud shout of agreement. Furthermore, their voices were full of pride.

Today was the day that they would never forget. To be able to fight alongside a peerless heavenly genius like Long Chen was their life’s greatest honor.

Furthermore, Long Chen had even risked his life for them several times in this battle. In the end, he risked everything to protect them, so they were fully won over by Long Chen and were willing to risk their lives for him as well.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Damn human race, if you have the guts, get in here and let’s fight!”

That terrifying lifeform’s roar once more came from the other side of the gate. It seemed that their conversation was too noisy, disturbing it.

“You’re noisy!” Mo Nian snorted and suddenly loaded his bow. An arrow then shot through the crack in the gate.
