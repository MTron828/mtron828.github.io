Chapter 3452 Give You a Chance

This person was the one who Long Chen had stolen the golden sword from on the Ghost Ship.

When he appeared, all the heavenly tribulation’s energy was absorbed by him. Standing in the air, he gave off a feeling of looking down on the nine heavens.

He seemed to have come back to life. Only now did Long Chen see that he was a terrifying sword cultivator. He had been replicated by the Heavenly Daos.

“A half-step World King!” exclaimed Bai Shishi’s mother.

“His true power is probably even more terrifying than an average World King.”

Bai Zhantang had a grave expression. Wielding his sword, he appeared outside the barrier. This was an absolutely terrifying existence, so he was ready to save Bai Shishi if something happened.

Bai Shishi’s mother and Bai Xiaole’s mother, as well as the rest of the Battle God Palace’s experts, also grew serious.

At this moment, Bai Shishi’s sword quivered and her battle intent soared. Facing this terrifying expert of the Ghost Dao, she was fearless. She had conquered her fear of the Ghost Dao.

When Long Chen appeared in front of Bai Shishi, she immediately said, “This is my heavenly tribulation. I will beat him.”

“If you were in your peak condition, I wouldn’t stop you. But now your power is less than a third of your peak. You will be at a disadvantage. If you hadn’t been undergoing this tribulation with everyone, you would have easily passed your tribulation. Leave this final pass to me. You should save some energy to absorb the final lightning essence,” said Long Chen.

There was no need to question Bai Shishi’s power. But against that terrifying Sword Dao expert, in her current state, she would definitely suffer.

In truth, Long Chen was also shocked. He almost messed around too much this time. If he hadn’t had Lei Linger absorb the lightning runes at the end, this fellow might very likely be in the World King realm. Then things would really be out of control.

Since Long Chen had said this, Bai Shishi nodded and didn’t continue arguing with him. He was correct. She had used up a great deal of power. If she then lost to this expert of the Ghost Dao, her new confidence against them might shatter.

Long Chen looked at that expert of the Ghost Dao, and this expert also looked back at Long Chen. What shocked Long Chen was that he saw light appear in that expert’s eyes. Suddenly, he spoke.

“You stole my sword.”

Everyone, including Long Chen, jumped in shock. Just what was going on? How could a lifeform replicated by the Heavenly Daos have its mind intact? How could he speak?

“I didn’t steal it. I openly snatched it,” said Long Chen with a faint smile. He acted calm but was already tightly clenching his saber hilt.

The elder looked at him expressionlessly. “Very good.”

“What part is good?”

Long Chen was startled. Suddenly, he found that his intuition was telling him that this expert wasn’t angry at all. Instead, he was pleased.

“Thank you for helping me find a suitable master for it,” said the elder.

Both Long Chen and Bai Shishi were stunned. This was completely unexpected.

“How did you find me?” asked the elder. However, now he was speaking spiritually, which further shocked Long Chen. Someone replicated by the heavenly tribulation still possessed their soul?

“On a Ghost Ship,” Long Chen also replied spiritually. Long Chen described how he had encountered a Ghost Ship and what had happened.

“Ghost Sovereign, you really are sinister. You killed us and then trillions of years later, you use our corpses to fight for you. Do you wish for us to slaughter the members of our own race?” That expert snorted, his voice filled with hatred.

“Who is the Ghost Sovereign?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“You will know in the future. Even if you don’t find him, he will find you. You set foot on his Ghost Ship, so you are infected by his karma. Since you have his mark planted on you, you have become his prey. Once you grow up enough, he will find you,” said that expert.

“What will he find me for?”

“Naturally, it is to reap your life. He will take back his mark. The Ghost Sovereign’s mark is firmly embedded within you, nourishing your heart-devil. Your heart-devil is his ultimate goal. Once your heart-devil is strong enough, he will reap his harvest.”

“This fucking Ghost Sovereign! He views me as a pig? I will definitely kill him one day!” raged Long Chen.

“The Ghost Sovereign is the master of the Ghost Dao. In the battle of the nine heavens, he killed countless lifeforms. His power is not something you can imagine. However, there is also an aura on your body that is different from all other lifeforms. You are a Divergent. Alright then. This final wisp of my ghost soul has actually been grasped by the Heavenly Daos. I will give you a chance!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the elder’s body exploded. He transformed into eight golden swords that wrapped around Bai Shishi.

Long Chen didn’t stop him. The feeling he got was that this expert was an almighty expert of the human race when he was alive. He shouldn’t have any malicious intent toward them.

The eight golden swords slowly merged into Bai Shishi’s body. After that, Bai Shishi suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood. Feeling startled, Long Chen hastily pressed a hand against her forehead. His vast Spiritual Strength poured into her.

These eight golden swords were actually eight runes containing endless information. They merged with Bai Shishi, instantly exhausting all of her Spiritual Strength. Long Chen was helping her keep up.

Bai Shishi’s Spiritual Strength was very powerful, but unexpectedly, it was used up even before these runes were done being absorbed. Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength then slowly entered her body, helping her absorb them.

Long Chen could sense a huge amount of information entering her soul. Although he didn’t know what this information was, his guess was that it was the life’s learning of that expert.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Almost half of Long Chen’s vast Spiritual Strength was used up before Bai Shishi finished merging with those runes.

Furthermore, at this moment, the tribulation clouds were gone. The devils in the distance then roared and charged back.

Long Chen ignored them and returned to the academy with everyone. Other than Long Chen, everyone else was unconscious.

When the master of the golden sword exploded, other than the eight golden runes, a huge amount of thunderforce was unleashed. Lei Linger naturally didn’t waste it.

It was the final lightning essence, and it was also the strongest part. Lei Linger had absorbed it all and injected a portion into the disciples. As a result, everyone’s body was on the verge of collapse.

According to Long Chen’s instructions, Lei Linger perfectly gave them their max limit of thunderforce. Any bit more and they really would die.

Once they were back in the academy, countless devils attacked the barrier. Long Chen eyed them with an evil smile.

“Just wait to be turned into practice partners.”
