Chapter 3893 Contemptible Ji Wuming

The roars of ten thousand dragons shook the world, seeming to come from the distant past and yet still containing endless killing intent.

At this moment, the ten thousand dragons in Gu Yang’s manifestation were flying, filling the sky. As for his scale armor, it was now covered in images of various dragons.

Gu Yang appeared to possess immense power, as if the strength of ten thousand dragons resided within him. This was a true Dragon Blood Battle Armor, surrounded by Blood Qi that erupted with fierce intensity.

Witnessing this spectacle, Long Qinian was left dumbfounded. But he was not the only one. Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the other Dragonblood warriors shared the same astonishment. Their gazes fixed on Gu Yang, but they couldn’t recognize him.

Presently, Gu Yang emanated an overwhelming killing intent, his presence reeking of raw brutality and an insatiable thirst for blood. Moreover, his eyes appeared as if multiplied by ten thousand, each layering upon the other, casting a foreboding and ominous gaze.

“Excellent, I’ve finally ignited the wrath of the ten thousand dragons. Now, the battle can really start. Come, the first captain of the Dragonblood Legion would like to ask for some pointers!”

Gu Yang’s voice was raspy like a dragon cry, containing immense fury. As countless runes slowly spun around his spear, people were mesmerized by it, witnessing the boundless energy brewing within.

Only now did people understand why Gu Yang was covered in wounds. He had accumulated these injuries to ignite the wrath of the ten thousand dragons.

He had fought the lord of Silver Moon City, but the city lord was too weak. Even when Gu Yang wanted to accumulate injuries, the fight was unable to stimulate the fury of the ten thousand dragons.

Thus, he allowed Long Qinian, who innately possessed dragon blood power, to injure him. Even better, Long Qinian also had the inheritance of the ghost fox evil dragon, who was not only the enemy of the evil dragon race but also a humiliation to the entire dragon race.

The dragon race was far too prideful to accept such schemers into their ranks, as they relied on power to resolve their conflicts. However, the ghost fox evil dragon shattered that norm, resulting in the wrath of the ten thousand dragons.

As a result, when Long Qinian’s power entered Gu Yang’s body, the effect was a million times better than the city lord’s attack, helping Gu Yang quickly reach the necessary level.

This was Gu Yang’s ultimate trump card. However, he only knew of this move and had never managed to activate it, until now.

As he successfully summoned and donned the Ten Thousand Dragon Battle Armor, the power of ten thousand dragons flowed through his body. He then smashed his spear at Long Qinian.

BOOM!

In response, Long Qinian fiercely swung his spear as well, triggering a tremendous explosion that reverberated through the surroundings. After that, the sky was engulfed in giant ripples, while the sheer force of the impact sent Long Qinian flying.

“What?!”

Seeing this scene, everyone was shocked. Although Long Qinian had been beaten by Yue Zifeng, they had all borne witness to his power. Moreover, Long Qinian had used a secret art to raise his power to his peak in preparation for receiving Yue Zifeng’s final blow.

Hence, it could be said that the current Long Qinian was no weaker than when he fought Yue Zifeng. In fact, he might be even stronger. But even in that state, he was blown away by Gu Yang, leaving the people dumbfounded.

With a forceful stomp on the air, Gu Yang shot after Long Qinian, generating a blazing tempest. He suddenly appeared right in front of Long Qinian and then unleashed a storm of attacks.

Long Qinian let out a fierce roar, desperately attempting to block Gu Yang's relentless assault. But despite his valiant efforts, he was still forced back. Within a matter of mere moments, he was propelled beyond the horizon, disappearing from sight. Yet, the remnants of their battle were still felt, as the reverberations of their earth-shattering qi waves resonated in the air.

Meanwhile, Yue Zifeng slashed his sword once more, blocking Ji Wuming’s next assassination attempt.

Just as Yue Zifeng successfully blocked Ji Wuming’s assault, Guo Ran and Xia Chen swiftly joined the fray. Their weapons and talismans exploded at Ji Wuming’s location, but to their surprise, Ji Wuming had already vanished. They couldn’t harm him at all.

As for Yue Zifeng, his face was growing paler. To spread his mental energy throughout the entire battlefield was extremely taxing. Furthermore, he had just used up a great deal of energy fighting Long Qinian.

Ji Wuming just had to casually attack, but Yue Zifeng was constantly using up a great deal of energy to block him. If this continued, Yue Zifeng wouldn’t be able to last much longer. But there was no other solution.

Other than Yue Zifeng, no one could stop Ji Wuming who could control space and time. Anyone who was sneak attacked by him would almost certainly die.

Just then, the Divine Venerates in the surroundings also noticed this. There were over a trillion people here now, all staring at the golden egg that Long Chen was in, unable to wait any longer. In the end, someone roared and took the lead to charge over.

Following that, tens of thousands of Divine Venerates and a trillion heavenly geniuses crashed forward like the tide.

In response, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan swung their weapons. To people’s surprise, even after experiencing such a bloody battle, both of their auras had only grown stronger. Even city lords could not receive an attack from them.

The malevolent spirits in their manifestations devoured the Yuan Spirits of experts, growing stronger as they absorbed more. Thus, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan also got stronger.

Despite both of them successfully repelling waves of foes, the sheer number of enemies was just too overwhelming. Wanting to be the final lucky victor, these lunatics wanted to tear a piece of meat out of Long Chen.

At this moment, Guo Ran and the others couldn’t bother with anything else and just entered their killing formation. Even knowing that there was a terrifying specter like Ji Wuming in their midst, they could only do this to protect Long Chen.

Their killing formation slaughtered all these experts as they met. Even with a numbers advantage, these experts were unable to break through the blockade of the Dragonblood warriors.

Yue Zifeng slashed his sword, once more blocking the ephemeral Ji Wuming. However, this time, the one to be sent flying wasn’t Ji Wuming but Yue Zifeng.

This was already his seventeenth time blocking Ji Wuming, and the amount of energy Yue Zifeng had used up to keep track of him nearly equaled the energy he had exerted while engaging Long Qinian in combat.

On the other hand, Ji Wuming barely used up any energy at all. This was an extremely unfair competition, but the battlefield had never been fair.

“You really are powerful. A sword cultivator in possession of such stamina is beyond my expectations, making me feel uneasy. You are an even greater threat to me than Long Chen, so I should kill you first!”

Ji Wuming suddenly appeared and pounced on the tottering Yue Zifeng. Seeing him in trouble, Xia Chen and Guo Ran immediately flew over.

“Don’t fall for it! His target is boss!” shouted Yue Zifeng. He wanted to block Ji Wuming, but the world suddenly spun around him. He was at his limit.

Just like that, Ji Wuming passed through the blockade of the Dragonblood warriors like a ghost. Looking at Long Chen in the egg, he smiled sinisterly. His dagger then stabbed toward Long Chen’s head like a bolt of lightning.

Yet, just as his dagger moved, his expression abruptly changed. It was as if a jolt of electricity had struck him. His body inexplicably vanished, and he gave up on this assassination attempt.

When Ji Wuming reappeared, he was already outside of the battlefield. But when people saw him clearly, they cried out in shock. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A deep bloody cut could be seen on his neck, like a sharp blade had cut across it, almost cutting off his head.

“Who’s there?!” shouted Ji Wuming furiously.

Just then, ripples appeared in the void before Long Chen, and an indistinct figure slowly emerged from within those ripples.

A pretty youthful maiden, appearing no more than thirteen years old, emerged from the rippling void. Adorned in black leather armor, she stood before them. As if to answer Wuming’s shout, her lips parted, and with deliberate slowness, she uttered three words:

“Dong-Ming-Yu.”
