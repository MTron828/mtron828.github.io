Chapter 4112 Natural and Artificial

This monster appeared completely silently and out of nowhere. Even Long Chen, with all his experience on the battlefield and his sharp senses honed through combat, did not sense this creature. However, the moment he sensed danger, he unleashed his full power.

Even then, he was blown back miserably, his Blood Qi flipping inside of him. He felt like his entire body was on the verge of collapse.

Most frightening of all, after that attack, this golden monster directly appeared in front of Long Chen again. This was no longer a matter of speed but a kind of spatial breaking law. It seemed that distance was no longer a concept in front of it.

BOOM!

Long Chen was horrified as he no longer had the power to block a second attack. Just then, a silver-white spear shot over, managing to barely block the golden monster’s attack.

At the same time, a branch whipped over like a vine, enveloping Long Chen and pulling him behind the formation.

“Long Chen, are you alright?” Yu Qingxuan hastily grabbed Long Chen anxiously.

“I’m fine. What is that monster? How did it appear so silently?”

Long Chen was covered in cold sweat. He had never dreamed of encountering such a monster. It was actually able to trick his senses and appear right beside him.

“It is a dark domain lord. They are the strongest creatures in the dark world, and an average Heaven Venerate is nothing more than an ant in front of them,” said a Fullmoon expert.

At this time, Xu Jianxiong started exchanging blows with the dark domain lord. However, his silver-white spear actually only caused sparks when it struck the dark domain lord’s body. It was like he had struck a divine weapon.

As Xu Jianxiong’s Blood Qi erupted, his manifestation burst into existence, exuding an incredibly powerful aura. Even though his moves were very simple, his brute power made up for it.

With each exchange, the void resembled a fractured mirror, scattering numerous spatial fragments around. Right now, the world trembled as if on the brink of explosion, struggling to withstand the intensity of their power.

“The race leader is so powerful!” exclaimed Guo Ran and the others.

Xu Jianxiong’s attack was the epitome of simplicity. After all, he had reached the stage of turning complexity back into simplicity, while still keeping every single detail perfect. That was already the realm of returning to the true source.

Even more shocking than that, despite the ordinary appearance of each strike, whenever it struck the dark domain lord, his power would erupt. However, not even the slightest trace of his power was wasted or leaked out. That meant that his control over his power had reached the pinnacle.

“Is the race leader an Eternal expert? Or is he half-step Eternal?” probed Xia Chen.

“No, the race leader is nothing more than a Heaven Venerate. The Eternal realm is not so easy to reach!” sighed a Fullmoon expert.

“He’s also a Heaven Venerate? But…”

“Within the Heaven Venerate realm, there are the natural and artificial variants. For example, we are the artificial Heaven Venerates, and the race leader is a natural Heaven Venerate.”

“There’s such a differentiation?”

“Time is the deciding factor. If you are able to become a Heaven Venerate while your Blood Qi is still in the midst of growing, the Heavenly Daos will bless you, and you will have the power of heaven and earth at your fingertips. But if you miss the time and have instead plateaued, relying on accumulating a great deal of time to enter the Heaven Venerate realm instead of your natural talent, you will not receive that blessing. To put it frankly, it is as if we have been abandoned by the Heavenly Daos, but we were unwilling to accept it, so we defied the heavens to make our breakthrough. Without the blessing of the Heavenly Daos’ karmic luck, just maintaining this realm requires us to burn our longevity. Moreover, every battle we fight burns up more longevity. So, if we fight too much, we won’t be far from death,” sighed a Heaven Venerate of the Fullmoon race.

“So that’s the case. There’s actually such a difference.” Guo Ran and the others were astonished to hear it.

“So for our human race, if we become Heaven Venerates within a hundred years, we will be natural Heaven Venerates?” asked Xia Chen.

The elder shook his head. “It’s not exactly a hundred years. Your human race has a shorter longevity and weaker Blood Qi. But you are also the spirit of heaven and earth, with the blessing of the heavens. Even within the human race, there are differences. Some people might have plateaued in their thirties, while some are still growing after thousands of years. On the other hand, our Fullmoon race is more stable. If we are unable to advance within three hundred years, there’s no hope of becoming a natural Heaven Venerate. Our race leader was exceptionally talented and became a Heaven Venerate at the age of fifty-seven. He was the sixth fastest in our history. Originally, he had a high chance of reaching the Eternal realm, but our Fullmoon race has been suppressed…” That elder couldn’t help but sigh bitterly, unable to continue.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, the earth was torn apart, and countless boulders shot out of the ground, smashing the formation like fireworks.

After the stones exploded, they revealed countless crystals that gave off strange fluctuations. The crystals gave off a beautiful divine light, like countless shooting stars flying through the night sky.

“World king crystals!”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. These crystals were actually even more valuable than immortal king crystals.

“Heavens, there’s a world king crystal vein underground!” exclaimed Guo Ran.

The earth repeatedly blasted apart, and more rocks came flying out, exploding in the air. It was like a fantasy world.

BOOM!

After another explosive exchange, Xu Jianxiong and the dark domain lord retreated at the same time. Long Chen saw that Xu Jianxiong’s fluctuations were incredibly intense. He must have reached some kind of peak.

As for the dark domain lord, It was also going all-out, with golden divine light burning around it.

Before this, their full-power exchange had resulted in them being tied in power, and they both retreated. What Long Chen and the others didn’t expect was for the dark domain lord to reveal a trace of fear in its eyes.

“Race leader, we’ll assist you! Once we summon the ancestral spirit totem, we can slay this dark domain lord!” The Fullmoon experts stepped forward, standing behind Xu Jianxiong in formation.

“No!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Unexpectedly, several people shouted in unison.

Those people were Xu Jianxiong, Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran. Hearing this answer, the Fullmoon experts were dumbfounded.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran hastily explained. “Don’t fight here! If the crystals are broken, you aren’t just breaking the land but also a lot of money! With this money, we can do anything!”

The immense power of Xu Jianxiong and the dark domain lord’s clash had caused countless crystals to explode, their essence dissipating back into the world, turning them into trash. Seeing this scene, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were both aggrieved.

Those were top grade world king crystals, treasures that could aid a World King’s cultivation. Moreover, that was real money, an important currency in the cultivation world. Seeing the broken bits of world king crystals, they almost wept.

“Uncle Xiong, leave this dark domain lord as a sparring partner. Such an enemy is truly rare,” said Long Chen.

“Hahaha!”

The Fullmoon experts were horrified when they heard Long Chen say this, but Xu Jianxiong actually laughed.

“Good brat, you were thinking the same thing as me.”

Just then, the dark domain lord roared as if it understood them and was insulted. It then charged back at Xu Jianxiong.
