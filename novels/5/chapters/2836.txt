Chapter 2825 Have Them Scram

This new group of disciples came with blazing killing intent. They were also carrying a stretcher.

The person lying on the stretcher was precisely Pan Mingxiong, who was still curled up like a shrimp. Long Chen’s kick had broken his coccyx. Even with spirit medicines, it was not something that would heal in one or two days. Hence, he was in immense pain.

These law enforcement disciples were his big brother’s good friends. As soon as he was lifted up, he went to find them.

These people were quite brotherly, so they directly came to find justice for Pan Mingxiong. However, after shouting, their leader suddenly noticed something off. He saw another group of law enforcement disciples.

“Squad leader? What are you doing here?”

The one who had just come to interrogate Long Chen was actually a part of the first group’s squad. He was nothing more than a subordinate.

“Do you want to die?! What are you shouting here for?!” The squad leader pelted him with curses.

The one being cursed lowered his head, not knowing what was going on. His relationship with this squad leader was normally pretty good. Why was he being cursed?

“Squad leader, we came to find Long Chen…” He said, not comprehending.

“Shut up! Is the name of instructor Long Chen something you can say?!” cursed the squad leader.

“Instructor? He’s an instructor?” The disciple was startled and looked at Pan Mingxiong on the stretcher. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Pan Mingxiong had told them that Long Chen was nothing more than an ascender from the lower world, someone with no background. Was there a mistake? They definitely wouldn’t have come to find trouble for an instructor.

Pan Mingxiong was filled with disbelief. “The Long Chen I’m talking about is the one in those black clothes. Doesn’t he look like a beggar? Is there some mistake?”

“Shut up!” the squad leader shouted. In the entire academy, other than Long Chen, almost no one wore black. Who else could it be?

The squad leader didn’t care about Pan Mingxiong really, but he did care about his subordinate’s life. As the latter gradually came to understand that this matter was not ordinary, he wisely shut his mouth.

“Instructor Long Chen, I didn’t discipline my subordinate properly, causing them to offend you. Do you think you can let them off due to their youth and ignorance? I don’t want to ruin your meal,” the squad leader begged Long Chen.

The newcomers were dumbfounded. What was going on? Even an instructor wasn’t qualified to make their squad leader act like this, right?

“Have them scram,” said Long Chen.

“Many thanks!” The squad leader indicated for them to leave, but before they could take more than a couple of steps, Long Chen’s voice rang out once more.

“I told you to have them scram. Did you not understand?”

“Understood, understood!” cried out the squad leader. “All of you can roll the hell down!”[1]

“What?” Those disciples were dumbfounded.

“What are you hesitating for? Roll!”

The squad leader grabbed one of them and kicked him in the butt. With a painful cry, he rolled down the stairs.

The others also helplessly thickened their faces and began rolling down.

The squad leader grabbed Pan Mingxiong, wanting to throw him down. That was because in his current state, he couldn’t move, so he had to be helped by others.

“Hey, wait a moment! My brother is Pan Mingying! You must know him! He’ll be returning soon-!” cried Pan Mingxiong.

“He’s already back. Most of his bones are currently broken, and he’s in a worse state than you. Are you still hoping for help from him? Idiot, if it weren’t for you, would all this have happened? Get going!” The squad leader kicked Pan Mingxiong in the butt.

Pan Mingxiong then screamed and rolled down. Medicine had been applied to his coccyx, but it had only recovered a bit, and that wound was torn open once more. Furthermore, he was even more sensitive in this state. This roll almost cost him his life.

He screamed like a dying pig as he rolled down before he eventually fainted.

Once the squad leader and the others were finally gone, everyone else on that floor finally burst into laughter.

“Third brother, why aren’t you laughing?” asked Zhong Ling. Long Chen still seemed serious, but it was precisely that serious appearance that made her unable to hold back her laughter.

“Maybe my threshold for laughter is just a bit high.” Long Chen bitterly smiled.

Before this, he would also have laughed like this. However, after experiencing the battle of the Martial Heaven Continent’s destruction, it felt like his heart had been destroyed along with the continent. He had yet to fully recover from the impact of that battle.

Although he knew he had to persevere and let go of that burden so that he could relax, he knew that would require more time.

He had to find his biological parents, reconvene with his brothers, and find his women. As a nine star heir, it seemed there were far too many secrets within him. He needed to uncover them bit by bit.

He had many things to do. Although he knew that he had to take things one step at a time, that he needed to relax in order to do these things well, he still felt immense pressure. Only someone bearing the same burden would know just how heavy it was.

The food quickly arrived. These were delicacies of the immortal world. Not only were they delicious, but they were also greatly beneficial to the body.

However, the price was also quite considerable. Just from Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu’s expressions, it could be seen that this was a rare opportunity for them.

The food was excellent. However, the wine was lacking. After drinking the Wine God Palace’s wine, Long Chen felt that the immortal world’s wine was as insipid as water.

However, Mu Qingyun and the others seemed to have a low tolerance to the wine. Their cheeks quickly became red. On the other hand, Long Chen never declined any wine and continued drinking until he was several jugs in without changing expression. Mu Qingyun repeatedly praised his capacity.

As they ate and drank, the atmosphere loosened. Long Chen finally learned a bit about the disciples of the God Institute.

The God Institute could be said to be split between three tiers, heaven, earth, and human. These three represented three different realms.

For them, disciples in the Mortal Transcendence realm, they were only at the human tier. Although Mu Qingyun and the others had almost fully expelled their mortal qi, they had yet to condense their divine flames. Thus, they were unable to expel that final trace of mortal qi and were still in the Mortal Transcendence realm.

Each tier had a ranking based on combat power. Those who were able to enter the rankings were given plentiful rewards every month.

Thus, the competition in the God Institute was quite intense. This competition was kept under control with various rules, but there were also loopholes. One rule was that anyone on the human rankings could challenge anyone. If they succeeded, they would take the other person’s ranking. If they lost, then their name would fall from the rankings. In order to get back on the rankings, they would have to wait until next month for another challenge. But that would cost them a month of the rewards.

“Does our side have only a few people on the rankings?” asked Long Chen when he saw Mu Qingyun’s indignant expression.
