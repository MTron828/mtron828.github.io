Chapter 1916 Neither Side Giving An Inch

Translator: BornToBe

Having advanced to the Netherpassage realm, the old man’s power had skyrocketed. The Heaven Splitting Blade was roaring like a wild beast aching to slaughter.

All the other divine items that were raised against it were cut in two by the Heaven Splitting Blade. The old man’s power was explosive, and each strike of his sword killed its target. He attacked seven times, killing seven Netherpassage experts.

“Heavens, is he a god? He’s crazy!” The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples were all dumbfounded. They had never seen someone like this, who slew Netherpassage experts so easily.

“Run!”

No one was able to stop the old man with the Heaven Splitting Blade. Terrified, they knew fleeing was their only choice.

“Split the Heavens 8!” The old man roared and a fierce sword-image appeared, shaking the world. Space twisted so wildly that it was impossible to see anything.

The only thing they could hear was rumbling. It was like heaven and earth had been split. They gradually returned to their senses, and their vision was restored. Their realm wasn’t even high enough to see that attack.

After that attack, all they saw was seven figures tumbling back, wildly spurting blood. Their divine items had crumbled in their hands.

The other Netherpassage experts had vanished. Even Li Tianxuan and the patriarch were startled.

Li Tianxuan sighed, “The nine forms of Split the Heavens would make even ghosts and gods flee. This kind of power is unstoppable.”

The current old man was like a tiger off his mountain, a dragon soaring out of the sea. Although he had just advanced to the Netherpassage realm, with the Heaven Splitting Blade in his hand, he was dominating these experienced Netherpassage experts.

One of the Xuan Beast experts tried to stabilize himself as he tumbled back, but then a ray of Sword Qi severed his head.

A pale hand caught the head, and a woman appeared in the air, her sword stained with blood. Pointing her sword at the other Netherpassage experts, she shouted, “Surrender and I’ll spare your lives.”

Upon seeing that woman, Ye Lingshan was delighted. It was her master, the head of the Martial Heaven Alliance, Qu Jianying.

Behind Qu Jianying was a group of over ten Netherpassage experts who surrounded these people.

“Even if you surrender, you’ll still die.”

However, the old man didn’t listen and continued to attack the heavily injured Netherpassage experts. Each slash of his blade took one of their lives, and they were all killed.

On his own, the old man had killed almost all the Netherpassage experts. He was a bit out of breath, but the bloodstains on him made him appear even more domineering.

The old man stabbed the Heaven Splitting Blade into the ground. Leaning on it, he looked at Qu Jianying without saying anything.

“This again.” Long Chen clapped his head, feeling a headache coming on. These two could never get along.

“You... hmph, so after advancing to the Netherpassage realm, you think you can go against me?!” Qu Jianying roared furiously. The old man wasn’t giving her any face.

“Your words are stupid. First of all, even without advancing to the Netherpassage realm, I could still go against you. Second, these idiots insulted my children. What’s wrong with the elder standing up for the children? Could it be that I have to be like a certain coward who doesn't dare to say anything even after their own disciples are killed?” snorted the old man disdainfully.

“What do you think you’re saying?!” raged Qu Jianying.

“Hey, let’s all calm down. Don’t you think two seniors shouting at each other is a bit unsuitable in front of a hundred thousand disciples?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen hastily flew forward, trying to mediate things. These two seemed to get worse tempers as they got older. If they were to really start fighting, that would be a giant joke.

Only then did Qu Jianying notice that over a hundred thousand disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance were staring at them oddly.

Taking a deep breath, she said, “Some people forget past favors, even forgetting just who to thank for advancing to the Netherpassage realm.”

Qu Jianying’s eyes reddened slightly. She had made painstaking efforts to help the old man, but in the end, it was Long Chen who had managed to convince the old man to use her help.

Now, the old man had advanced to the Netherpassage realm, and if he didn’t want to listen to her, fine. But he actually went against her, putting her in such an embarrassing situation in front of so many people. She felt a bit aggrieved.

The old man’s expression immediately changed, and he was about to retort. “I-”

However, Long Chen hastily grabbed him, saying, “Alright, now isn’t the time to argue about this. There’s been major events in the Yin Yang World, so we have to hurry up. Discussing the important matters take precedence.”

“If you want to discuss something, discuss it yourselves. I’m just an old man, and there’s nothing for me to say. In any case, it won’t matter what I say. I’m leaving, and if you need something, just send me a message. The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect will fight.”

After saying that, the old man beckoned to Bao Buping and Chang Hao. The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples could only follow the old man as he left. Bao Buping and Chang Hao helplessly waved goodbye.

Long Chen smiled. “Alliance head, you shouldn’t argue with him. You know he has a temper. You heard what he said, as long as the Martial Heaven Alliance goes to war, he will join in. He just has a bad way of showing it.”

The old man was truly too stubborn, but the alliance head herself wasn’t much better off in that regard. She knew that he had that kind of temper but was still instantly provoked. As for the old man, seeing Qu Jianying aggrieved because of him, he had clearly felt guilty yet refused to lower his head. Was saying a few nice words really that difficult?

The old man didn’t even ask Long Chen what had happened in the Yin Yang World before leaving. He clearly didn’t want to stay here.

The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s people, from top to bottom, all had very direct characters. If they liked you, they would be willing to give their lives for you. If they didn’t like you, they wouldn’t even look at you. So their characters didn’t make them get along with the rest of the world.

Qu Jianying looked at the stubborn back of the old man as he left. Her mouth opened and shut a few times, but she didn’t say anything in the end.

“Let’s go. We can talk once we’re back at the Martial Heaven Alliance.” Qu Jianying waved her hand, bringing them back to the headquarters. With Qu Jianying and the others’ protection, they were finally returning.

Upon returning to the headquarters, the disciples finally relaxed. They felt like they had just gone through tribulation and been reborn. Some of the female disciples were even crying. The feeling of living was good.

Although they hadn’t felt fear in that intense battle to the death, that was because in that situation, they couldn’t afford to do so. Now that it was over, a lingering fear appeared.

On the other hand, the Dragonblood Legion’s people were all calm as if they hadn’t gone through anything at all. That made the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples feel even greater admiration for them.

They were true warriors. That intense slaughter was something that the Dragonblood Legion was already used to.

The young disciples began conversing with the Dragonblood warriors with great reverence. The headquarters became very lively.

“You should be the brilliant disciple of Daoist Heavenly Feather of the Divine Ice Palace.” Once they were back, Qu Jianying turned toward Ye Zhiqiu.

“I don’t dare to accept that praise, but yes, my master is Daoist Heavenly Feather. Ye Zhiqiu greets the alliance head.” Ye Zhiqiu bowed slightly.

Qu Jianying smiled. “It seems Daoist Heavenly Feather is still my senior...”

“Then does that mean I can call you senior apprentice-sister in the future?” Long Chen’s eyes suddenly brightened.

“Little brat, you dare to take advantage of me? Are you itching for a beating?” cursed Qu Jianying.

“How can it count as taking advantage? According to reason, Ye Zhiqiu is from the same generation as me and even my lover. Her master is your senior, so she should call you senior apprentice-sister, as should I,” said Long Chen.

“You... you little brat, which relation matters more, my relation with the old man or her master?”

“Well... that’s true. Then how about while Zhiqiu is present, I’ll call you senior apprentice-sister, and while she’s not, I’ll call you based on the old man’s relationship with you...”

“Brat, you really are the same as that old bastard! As expected, the master raises the same kind of disciple!”

“Cough...” Li Tianxuan suddenly had a coughing fit, and the patriarch had a bitter smile. It seemed that even they had been included in this cursing.

“I’m not talking about you two. I’m talking about that old bastard who’s like a dung-covered rock, stinky and hard.” Only then did Qu Jianying recall that Long Chen wasn’t just a disciple of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect but also the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Ye Lingshan, and the others all covered a smile.

“You, keep your mouth shut! I’ll handle you later.” Qu Jianying didn’t give Long Chen any chance to keep quibbling. She turned to Mo Nian. “The Mo family was once a blazing sun in this world. With them leading it, the ancient family alliance was a force to be reckoned with. Although the Mo family has now declined, don’t you think doing such dishonorable things all day is an embarrassment to your ancestors?”
