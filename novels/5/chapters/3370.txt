Chapter 3359 Mo Nian Appears

Four chains suddenly shot out of the darkness, binding Long Chen’s hands and feet.

On the other hand, Bai Shishi and the others were wrapped by the light of the sect-maintaining divine stone. The stone also left Long Chen’s hand and fell into Qin Feng’s hold.

“Boss…!”

Qin Feng was shocked. His expression changed.

“I order you to protect the sect-maintaining divine stone!” shouted Long Chen.

Just at that moment, the four chains pulled Long Chen into the spatial channel.

Long Chen’s divine ring quivered, causing the channel to rumble and countless cracks to appear. Long Chen fought against the chains with all his power, and the runes on the chains began to fall.

“Use the divine stone’s power to free Long Chen! Long Chen is close to getting away with his own power. He’s just missing a bit!” shouted Bai Shishi.

But Qin Feng simply held the stone and shook his head. Clenching his teeth, he said, “It’s a trap.”

“What trap?! Save Long Chen!” Bai Shishi cried out. They were enveloped by the stone’s light, separating them from the channel’s power. However, she cried out in panic and anger. If they waited any longer, Long Chen would be dragged out of their grasp.

Qin Feng shouted, “Boss entrusted the divine stone to me, not you, precisely because he didn’t want you to fall for Enpuda’s trap. Boss definitely realized that this channel’s main target is only him. That’s why he gave us the divine stone. That way, the seventh branch academy can be protected.”

“But Long Chen…!”

Bai Shishi saw Long Chen struggling with all his might as his limbs were bound by the chains that sank into his flesh. Seeing him bleed, Bai Shishi felt like her own heart was bleeding.

Qin Feng could tell what Long Chen wanted him to do. He knew that he had to maintain his calm at this time.

Enpuda was letting them see Long Chen struggle as his goal wasn’t just Long Chen. He wanted to destroy the seventh branch academy as well.

As long as they still had the divine stone, the academy was safe. But Enpuda was unwilling to let that go. Thus, he made them have hope, wishing that they would use the divine stone to save Long Chen. Once they did, they would fall for his trap.

Although Bai Shishi normally appeared aloof and indifferent, she simply kept her feelings inside. In a moment of desperation, she wasn’t able to maintain that calmness, which was why Long Chen had given the divine stone to Qin Feng.

Right now, the one suffering the most was Qin Feng. He was unable to do anything and could only watch as Long Chen was pulled further and further away.

“Little fellow, you’re pretty ruthless. Alright, since I can’t destroy the seventh branch academy, I’ll settle for only you.” Enpuda’s expression was gloomy. His plan had been seen through by Long Chen, so he was unable to kill two birds with one stone.

Considering that this passage pierced through multiple heavens, Enpuda was only able to fully lock onto one person. As his goal had been seen through, he knew that using this opportunity to eliminate the seventh branch academy along with Long Chen was no longer possible, so he didn’t want to drag this out any longer for fear of something unexpected happening.

Hence, the channel rumbled and black qi swirled out of the four chains. After that, their power shot up, and Long Chen was instantly dragged into the depths of the channel.

“Long Chen!”

“Boss!”

Bai Shishi, Qin Feng, and the others couldn’t do anything. Could they really only watch as Long Chen died?

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion came from within the channel. Long Chen, who was originally unable to break free and was thinking of how to use the primal chaos bead’s power to handle Enpuda, suddenly broke free of one of the chains.

Long Chen seemed to be caught between two spacetimes. In front of him was Enpuda, and behind him were Bai Shishi and the others. He was incredibly far from both sides.

Bai Shishi and the others cheered. They thought that Long Chen had found a way to break the chains. But they didn’t know that Long Chen hadn’t done anything at all.

Long Chen looked at Enpuda and saw that the latter’s face was covered in astonishment. It seemed that he didn’t know what was happening either.

BOOM!

With another explosion, the chain binding Long Chen’s right hand shattered and the channel quivered. Long Chen then looked at Enpuda and found that the latter was no longer at the end of the path. Instead, the path continued beyond him. At the end of it, Long Chen saw a wretched figure and almost cried out. 

It was a figure wearing a helmet that was as black as the bottom of a pot and holding a three-foot-long shovel in his hand. He seemed to be digging something and was looking deeper into the channel.

“Mo Nian!”

Long Chen couldn’t believe his eyes. It was actually Mo Nian, and Mo Nian now turned to see him.

Mo Nian was shocked as well and rubbed his eyes. In disbelief, he asked, “Are you real or fake? I open a coffin and see you. Have I been bewitched? Hey, are you really Long Chen? When did you end up being one-eyed?”

Long Chen had yet to recover from using the Purgatory Eyes last time, so he was still wearing an eyepatch. With how long the channel was, and being unable to sense any auras from this distance, Mo Nian didn’t quite dare to believe it.

“No way! It really is Mo Nian!”

Qin Feng and Qi Yu cried out in shock. The spatial channel had now been split into four sections. The starting point was Qin Feng and the others, and then there was Long Chen’s section. Originally, Enpuda was at the end, but now another section had appeared behind him. That was where Mo Nian was. This channel was a straight path.

Seeing Qin Feng and Qi Yu also shout out his name, Mo Nian was delighted. He instantly concluded that he hadn’t been bewitched. Before he could speak, Enpuda furiously shouted, “Who are you? You dare to ruin my affairs?!”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Mo Nian cursed, “You damn fatty, roll away! What qualifications do you have to interrupt when I’m talking?!”

Enpuda cursed, “You’re the damn fatty!”

“Are you blind? This is just some baby fat. I’m not fat! Understand? If you have the guts, report your sect and name! Let’s see if I feel like digging up your ancestral graves!” retorted Mo Nian immediately. He very much detested it when others called him fatty.

“You… you are that bastard Immoral Daoist’s new apprentice?” exclaimed Enpuda.

“So you know. If you don’t want your ancestors to see the sun, shut your mouth.”

After that, Mo Nian directly ignored Enpuda and continued shouting at Long Chen. “Long Chen, what’s going on? You don’t seem to be having a good time. You’re being dragged into someone else’s rat hole? Do you need your big brother to stand up for you? Hey, damn, we ascended at the same time! How did you find more beautiful girls so quickly? Hey, if you can, you should introduce a few to me as well! I spend all day digging up tombs- I mean, doing archaeology. Yes, archaeology. After working through the earth all day, I don’t even have a partner! I’m very lonely…”

It seemed as if Mo Nian hadn’t spoken to anyone in a long time, and a flood of words came out. After seeing Bai Shishi, he immediately cried out about the injustice of the heavens. At such a time, he was actually chattering about this nonsense.

Long Chen had the urge to beat him. Did he not have eyes? He shouted, “Hurry up and break the chains!”

“Chains? What chains? There aren’t any chains here,” said Mo Nian. “I was opening up coffins. When I opened the second one, I saw you.”

“Hurry and open the other two coffins!” shouted Long Chen hastily.

Mo Nian was startled. Long Chen actually knew that there were two more coffins here. Without another word, he pried open the third coffin with his shovel.

BOOM!

As expected, when the third coffin was opened, another one of the chains binding Long Chen was broken. Only the last one was remaining.

“Courting death!”

Enpuda was enraged. With Mo Nian’s help, the final chain also shattered. Long Chen escaped from his bindings. 

However, just as he was trying to return to his starting point, the spatial channel crumbled. After that, Long Chen was devoured by fragments of spacetime.

“Long Chen!”

Bai Shishi, Mo Nian, and the others cried out. But the channel vanished, and Long Chen vanished with it.
