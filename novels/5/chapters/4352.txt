Chapter 4341 Old Enemies Meet Once More

The Dragonblood warriors charged into the tribulation clouds like bandits invading a city, and they crazily slaughtered the lightning beasts.

Normally, heavenly tribulation wasn't something people actively provoked; it was something they endured passively. However, the Dragonblood warriors showed no fear as they took the initiative to attack.

Influenced by the Dragonblood Legion, the High Firmament Academy, the Battle God Palace, and the Starry River Sect’s disciples also went crazy, attacking the lightning beasts ferociously.

Those lightning beasts had shocking auras and possessed the power of Heaven Venerates at the very least. Moreover, their numbers seemed endless in the sky, and their roars struck terror into even the half-step Eternals.

Nonetheless, the Dragonblood warriors showed no mercy. They swept through the heavenly tribulation, seeking the area with the most lightning beasts as if they were afraid that they wouldn’t get to kill enough of the beasts.

Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were fighting on their own, and these frightening lightning beasts were like paper paste in front of them, unable to even endure a single blow.

However, the most terrifying one out of them all was Yue Zifeng. With every stroke of his sword, he tore the tribulation clouds apart and wiped out countless tribulation beasts, which then transformed into lightning runes.

For the onlookers, the captains of the Dragonblood Legion were like hungry wolves devouring a thick piece of meat in front of them. That thirst, that craziness, gave them the chills.

“These lightning beasts were the final wave of our tribulations. However, they are actually nothing in front of Long Chen and his companions.” A Triple Supreme couldn’t help but gulp as he watched their crazy assault.

Having undergone their tribulations, all these disciples knew just how terrifying these lightning beasts were. In a one-against-one or even one-against-ten, these disciples wouldn’t be afraid of these beasts. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, during their heavenly tribulation, they had been besieged by hundreds of lightning beasts at the same time. Even with Long Chen’s protection, even knowing that they wouldn’t die, it had been very tough on them. Every single second had been terrifying.

On the contrary, these terrifying lightning beasts were like lambs for the slaughter in front of the Dragonblood Legion. They were running rampant within the sea of lightning beasts, blasting them apart with each attack.

In truth, the Dragonblood Legion had no choice but to go all-out, as they were worried that the tribulations wouldn’t have enough power behind them. After all, they needed it to completely refine their new armor and weapons, activate their latent dragon blood, and root their manifestations into the primal chaos qi of the world.

After some time, mysterious marks appeared on their armor and weapons. They were the runes that Xia Chen and Guo Ran had meticulously inscribed. When these runes illuminated, it signified that a resonance was forming between them. With a constant influx of thunderforce entering them, their armor and weapons were gaining spirituality. Once their spirits were born, complete integration would occur.

Currently, they had managed to reach the level of resonance, and that stimulated them into attacking even more frantically. With every lightning beast they killed, they sensed the connection between their armor and weapons growing stronger. Each surge of thunderforce further empowered them.

“Kill!”

Even Guo Ran was swept up in the frenzy. With his golden armor, a pair of golden wings on his back, and a pair of golden battle sabers in his hands, he looked like an armored god. His armor was different from everyone else’s, consisting of three hundred and sixty interconnected pieces, each supported by its own independent formation. However, this meant he had to kill even more than everyone else, as he needed hundreds of times the energy.

Other than Yue Zifeng, his killing prowess was the highest. With each enemy he killed, he absorbed more lightning runes, enhancing his armor and propelling his strength to new heights.

The lightning beasts only lasted for a brief moment before they were gone. Following that, one strange lifeform after another appeared in the heavenly tribulation. The clouds suddenly shrank, surrounding them like a cage.

“This is…!”

As they witnessed this transformation, shock overcame the onlookers.

“Isn’t that the martial stage from the Sage King Convention?!”

People recognized the familiar setting. The heavenly tribulation had replicated the stage and summoned numerous figures.

All of a sudden, an enormous lily appeared, and one of those figures attacked as quick as a bolt of lightning.

“The Undying race’s Lian Wuying!”

These were all figures from the Sage King Convention. Lian Wuying was replicated by the heavenly tribulation, and her aura had reached the World King realm.

BOOM!

Gu Yang directly clashed with her, and with a grunt, he was hurled backward like a shooting star.

Just then, a sword tore through the void and attacked Gu Yang from the rear.

“It’s Ye Wuchen!”

These figures were all powerful heavenly geniuses, and the heavenly tribulation even replicated the Ye clan’s Ye Wuchen.

“There’s also Zhao Xingtian! Didn’t they all die?!” People couldn’t believe their eyes.

“They died, but their karmic connection was grasped by the heavenly tribulation. These individuals all participated in the Sage King Convention and were affected by that karma. That's why they've manifested here,” explained an elder.

“That sounds troublesome. It's said that when the heavenly tribulation is determined to prevent someone from passing, it will summon entities with strong karmic ties to eliminate the person undergoing the tribulation. Such a heavenly tribulation ceases to be called a tribulation; it becomes heavenly punishment,” another elder added solemnly.

“Is it because they attacked the heavenly tribulation so crazily that it enraged the heavens?”

“Who can say? After all, heavenly punishment is something that exists only in legend. However, for the experts who died on the Sage King martial stage to appear now, it doesn’t bode well,” sighed that elder.

What he actually wanted to say was that no matter how strong a person was, how could they be stronger than the heavens? Their method of undergoing tribulation was absolutely crazy. However, he couldn’t say such a thing out loud here.

Amongst the crowd, a group of experts were fraught with worry. They were from the High Firmament Academy.

“Don’t worry. Long Chen hasn’t even unleashed his aura. Everything is under control,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother. She could feel just how worried these elders were.

BOOM!

Just then, startled cries rang out, and the conjured Lian Wuying exploded with one stroke of Yue Zifeng’s sword. Even the powerful Lian Wuying was nothing in front of him.

“Zifeng!” Guo Ran's cry resounded, and he swiftly rushed to the scene.

Yue Zifeng instantly understood his cue and left, allowing Guo Ran to take his place. As he assumed his position, his armor radiated a brilliant glow, resembling a vacuum that devoured the residual lightning runes left behind by Lian Wuying.

At this moment, Gu Yang also managed to slay Ye Wuchen. When Ye Wuchen exploded, Gu Yang absorbed the lightning runes left in the wake of the explosion.

The Dragonblood warriors were still fearless against the conjured lifeforms from the Sage King Convention. They charged forward like ravenous wolves, and in another short incense stick’s worth of time, the number of lifeforms present started to diminish.

It was at this time that an enormous gate appeared high in the sky. When this gate materialized, everyone’s expressions changed, and they stared in disbelief.
