Chapter 3747 Specialized in Scamming the Human Race

“Little fellow, what do you think you’re doing?”

That person had just fallen when over ten Immortal Kings surrounded Long Chen. None of them had friendly expressions.

“Little fellow, are you blind? Hurry up and kowtow for knocking down my brother. If you give some compensation, we can pretend that nothing happened,” barked one Immortal King.

Just then, three demonic beasts walked over as well. They were also walking through the gate. They then looked at Long Chen’s predicament and sneered. They just walked right through.

This group of Immortal Kings simply let the three demonic beasts pass through without making things hard on them. Once the demonic beasts were gone, they once more turned to Long Chen impatiently.

“What are you looking at?! Kowtow and this matter will be over! We won’t make things hard on you.”

Long Chen looked at them. Flames of anger were constantly spurting out of his heart. He had seen such a scam many times. If he really did pay as an apology, they would only demand more and more, with even more scams. A single kowtow definitely wasn’t sincere enough. Then he would need to pay for dinner, for drinks, until he was stripped of every bit of wealth.

Saying sorry casually would be jumping right into the trap. This was a probing blow. According to the normal pattern, a person would say a few tough words and then toss them some money as if buying a meal for a beggar. Then this matter would be over, and these scammers wouldn’t make things hard on them.

However, Long Chen was enraged. It wasn’t due to them trying to scam him but because they were all humans, yet they were only targeting their fellow humans, completely ignoring those three demonic beasts. Just seeing the mocking sneers of those three demonic beasts enraged Long Chen.

“The world needs to be rebuilt for order. And this rebuilding needs to start from inside the human race,” said Long Chen coldly.

“What kind of nonsense are you spouting? Hurry up and apologize!”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The person who pretended to be knocked down charged forward and grabbed Long Chen’s collar.

As a result, he had just raised his hand when Long Chen caught him. After that, a painful sound of bones breaking rang out. That person’s arm was crushed.

“AH!”

That person had not expected Long Chen to dare to resist. He screamed in pain.

“Release him!”

The others were also shocked and enraged. As soon as Long Chen attacked, they had a bad feeling. It seemed that they had misjudged. This didn’t seem to be a fat sheep for the fleecing.

Long Chen then pointed a single finger. The person who crashed into him had his head pierced just like that; his screams ended.

When Long Chen released his hand, that person’s corpse fell to the ground with a thunking sound.

“Murder! Someone is killing in front of the Giant Peak City’s gates!” shouted the experts that surrounded Long Chen.

“Little fellow, you dare to kill people in the city?! You are becoming enemies with all of Giant Peak City! Your death is sure-”

Their leader was in the midst of shouting when Long Chen’s palm struck him. He directly blew up into a blood mist. Ordinary Immortal Kings didn’t have the slightest ability to resist in front of Long Chen.

The other experts were all horrified when they saw this, and they began to flee. At the same time, powerful auras rose within the city. The real experts had received word about this incident.

When Long Chen pointed his finger again, more lightning arrows shot out. The people that had surrounded Long Chen were killed one by one.

“You’re my daddy! We were wrong, please spare us-!”

Regretfully, Long Chen was not moved. Lightning flashed and those people were quickly killed, all of them pissing themselves in terror. Their old arrogance was gone.

“Stop!”

Experts roared from inside the city, and four World Kings charged out. But Long Chen ignored them. His finger continued pointing and killing the last few stragglers. The final one died right in front of the shouting World King.

“How brazen! You dare to run rampant in Giant Peak City!”

The next moment, an arc of saber-light flew through the air, cutting that World King directly in two. The remaining three World Kings were stunned.

Long Chen’s saber was as quick as lightning and yet silent. It didn’t leak any aura. It was like a random swing of his saber. That World King was simply killed just like that.

“Who… who are you?!” 

The remaining three World Kings retreated in terror. Long Chen slowly walked over while holding a saber that was even taller than him.

Seeing this scene, countless experts within and outside the city fled. They stared in shock at this black-robed man with his giant saber and soaring killing intent.

“Who I am isn’t important. What is important is that you people that only bully your own race are about to become dead people,” said Long Chen coldly.

After killing that person with the Minghong Saber, Long Chen shattered that person’s Yuan Spirit and searched through the fragments of his soul. As a result, Long Chen knew that this city was filled with trash.

They bullied the weak while cowering from the strong. They bent their spines to other races, acting like dogs. But yet, they acted superior to their fellow humans, bullying the weaker members of their own race.

The expressions of these three experts changed. They suddenly turned and fled. But just as they moved, the wind blew and Long Chen brushed past their shoulders. After that, the three of them could only look down in disbelief, watching half their bodies fall to the ground.

They then lost consciousness, and their upper bodies also fell. After being struck by the Minghong Saber, their Yuan Spirits were wiped out.

The Minghong Saber was innately a weapon for killing. It specialized in devouring other people’s souls to grow and had devoured countless souls after following Long Chen in combat. It was growing stronger and stronger, to the point that it could even take Long Chen’s place for searching through people’s memories. Long Chen didn’t even need to do a soulsearch himself.

“Inferior human, are you courting death?”

Just then, an icy roar rang out. At the same time, a snake bone whip came flying out of the city from many miles away. It accurately reached Long Chen’s head in just a moment, and it also contained a terrifying power.

“A Supreme expert!” This terrifying power was Supreme qi.

Long Chen didn’t unleash his saber. He simply reached out and caught it with his left hand. At this moment, golden dragon scales covered his hand, and a thunderous explosion rang out.

Explosive power formed an ear-piercing ripple that spread from Long Chen’s hand. After spreading thirty meters, it suddenly transformed into a violent tempest. Seeing it, countless people fled in terror.

No one knew that the city was hiding a Supreme expert, nor did anyone expect this black-robed man who wasn’t emitting the slightest aura to catch a divine weapon barehanded.

“Get out here!”

Long Chen’s roar was like thunder shaking the world. He pulled and the entire city quivered. Buildings were blown apart as a figure was forcibly dragged out by Long Chen.
