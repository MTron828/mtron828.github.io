Chapter 5006 Accepting Consecutive Challenges

If Ye Qing’s movements resembled a phantom, then Qin Feng’s movements were completely elusive. No one saw how he moved. They witnessed Ye Qing’s swords slashing through Qin Feng’s back, only to realize it was merely an afterimage.

Qin Feng swiftly impaled Ye Qing from behind, blood trailing down his sword. Everyone, except Long Chen, was left astounded by the speed and precision of the strike. It had happened so swiftly that they couldn’t comprehend it.

Qin Feng hadn’t even entered a combat stance, but he stood indifferently after impaling Ye Qing with his sword. Ye Qing remained frozen in his attack posture, unable to move. Looking at the sword protruding out of his chest, he was filled with terror.

“I’ll give you a lesson. If you don’t know how strong your opponent is, you shouldn’t unleash all your power from the start. Without room for adjustment, you’re just offering your head to your opponent. In your next life... be more cautious,” remarked Qin Feng lightly.

“No!” shouted Ye Qing.

When Qin Feng pulled his sword, a rain of blood followed as Ye Qing’s eyes turned dim.

His lifeless body slowly fell to the ground. The sound wasn’t loud, but it struck at the hearts of everyone present. A renowned expert from the Ye clan had been defeated in a single move—or rather, before a single move, as Qin Feng hadn’t even entered his combat state. He had displayed only a fraction of his true power.

Qin Feng elegantly swung his sword, casting drops of blood into the air. The blade traced a graceful arc before returning smoothly to its sheath. His movements were precise and natural, carrying an air of effortless mastery.

“Wow, how strong!”

The female disciples of the Jiang clan were awestruck by Qin Feng’s display. His unmatched skill and unwavering commitment to honor had completely won them over. To them, Qin Feng was a real man, providing them with a sense of absolute reliability and safety, far surpassing the Ye clan’s disciples.

“That’s... that’s incredible!” Long Ziwei exclaimed, his excitement palpable. His gaze toward Qin Feng was now one of deep admiration. In his opinion, this was how a true expert should be.

Although Long Ziwei knew that Qin Feng was very powerful, Ye Qing was not a weakling. So, while Long Ziwei had anticipated Qin Feng’s victory, he had expected it to be a hard-fought battle.

From the very beginning, Long Ziwei had focused intensely on observing every detail of the fight. Unlike others who couldn’t follow Qin Feng’s lightning-fast movements, he could see the entire sequence.

In truth, Qin Feng had moved only once Ye Qing appeared behind him. He was so fast that he only left behind an afterimage.

The most terrifying thing was that Qin Feng had accurately predicted Ye Qing’s movements. His timing was flawless, not a fraction too fast or slow. Had he been slightly quicker, Ye Qing might have reacted and changed tactics; any slower, and Ye Qing’s sword could have struck him.

It was this split-second timing that allowed Qin Feng to execute his attack with near-impeccable precision.

There was no luck involved in Qin Feng’s actions; it was a testament to his honed reflexes and extensive combat experience. Such skill couldn’t be replicated or mimicked. Most impressively, Qin Feng had maintained his calm and confidence throughout the encounter, not even batting an eye from start to finish.

Killing his target in one move was not a coincidence; it was simply inevitable. This was a true expert’s style. The confidence that radiated from their very bones was what made it so shocking.

“You...!” The Ye clan’s referee was enraged and about to criticize Qin Feng for killing his opponent. But he quickly remembered that this was the life-and-death martial arena, so he swallowed his words, unable to speak out.

Qin Feng was transported back to his seat. At this moment, Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu’s gazes toward him were completely different. They had known of his strength, but they had never expected him to be so overwhelmingly formidable.

The mercenaries who had become acquainted with Qin Feng during this time were equally stunned. Was this humble and low-key Qin Feng really such a monster? He had concealed his power quite deeply.

Yu Ying, Brother Song, and the others smiled bitterly inside. Was this a tradition of the Dragonblood Legion? When Long Chen first arrived in Mercenary City, they also perceived him as weak and in need of assistance, so they dragged him along with them.

Long Chen and Qin Feng were so strong, but they were still willing to do so much for the mercenaries. After the mercenaries reflected on this, any reluctance to leave their home vanished. They realized that their initial hesitation was not just ingratitude but also a profound folly.

“How despicable! You were concealing your true power!” shouted a disciple of the Ye clan.

When Qin Feng took off his ring, everyone sensed that he was a nine star Heavenly Doyen. Similarly, Ye Qing, his opponent, was also a nine-star Heavenly Doyen, so they had fought on equal grounds. There was nothing despicable about it.

Furthermore, Ye Qing had gone all-out from the start, not treating Qin Feng lightly due to his appearance. There were no tricks involved in Qin Feng’s victory.

After showing his cultivation base, Qin Feng put the ring back on and indifferently said, “The Dragonblood Legion doesn’t bully the weak, and we also disdain using such schemes. I wear this ring simply to remain low-key and out of habit. All of us hailed from the mortal world, and we don’t flaunt flashy titles or statuses like you. If you’re still unconvinced, feel free to challenge me again.”

“How shameless! You clearly cheated, yet you still make so many excuses! From top to bottom, your Dragonblood Legion is a bunch of hypocrites!” shouted a Ye clan disciple, foolishly including Long Chen in his rant.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Feng’s expression darkened. “You should watch your mouth. Otherwise, even if your clan leader were present, he wouldn’t be able to save your dog life.”

Under Qin Feng’s intense gaze, the Ye clan disciple felt his soul shudder. After all, Qin Feng’s killing intent had solidified, capable of directly affecting soul. The disciple was too terrified to utter another word.

As more disciples from the four divine clans arrived, including some rarely seen peak experts, it was evident they had heard about the commotion and hurried over to witness it.

“I am unconvinced! Do you dare to fight me?!” shouted someone.

Unexpectedly, the person to challenge Qin Feng was not from the Ye clan, but the Zhao clan.

Unlike the other Zhao clan’s midgets, this disciple was extremely tall, carrying a giant wolf tooth club that added to his imposing figure. His body resembled an iron tower, exuding a terrifying pressure.

“Zhao Qingyu, have some shame! You are a half-step Heavenly Chosen! Do you even care about face?” Just then, Feng Fei’s voice rang out, drawing Long Chen’s attention. She smiled brightly and laughed in his direction.

“Where have you been these days? Do you not know? Without you, this world loses much of its brilliance,” she remarked, leaving Long Chen momentarily speechless. It was clear she was here to witness the show.

Just as Feng Fei cut off Zhao Qingyu’s challenge and everyone’s attention turned to her, Qin Feng spoke.

“I accept your challenge.”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
