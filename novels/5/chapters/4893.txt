Chapter 4882 Golden Crow Flame

“That’s...!”

Startled cries rang out when they saw the divine bird within Huo Qianwu’s golden disk.

This divine bird was completely golden, as if it was made of gold. Its wings covered the sun, and its sharp claws had three talons.

“The Three Foot Golden Crow! Her core flame is the Golden Crow Flame!”

The Golden Crow Flame was a branch of the Sun Flame. When cultivated back to its origin, the master of the Golden Crow Flame could understand the sun and transform it into the Sun Flame. Whether it was the Fusang Flame from the Fusang Tree or the Golden Crow Flame, they were all parts of the Sun Flame. However, before transforming, they were merely supreme Yang flames. In truth, both the Golden Crow Flame and Fusang Flame had to be cultivated to the very pinnacle to have a chance to become the true Sun Flame.

Before transforming into the Sun Flame, they would always produce a manifestation of the Fusang Tree and Golden Crow existing together. For example, a legend said that when a Fusang Tree grew to the pinnacle, it would produce a Golden Crow totem. Once the Golden Crow was born, they jointly produced the Sun Flame.

In the same vein, the Golden Crow would produce a Fusang bone after cultivating to the peak. It was said that every Golden Crow had a Fusang seed inside of it, and when the Fusang bone reached maturity, it would fall from the Golden Crow and become a sapling of the Fusang Tree.

The Golden Crow race used the Fusang Trees as a resting place. They grew and multiplied there, cultivating the Dao of the Sun. Some said that the Fusang Trees and Golden Crows were actually one body, and their ultimate goal was the Sun Flame.

The Golden Crow Flame was already famous enough. Hence, when boosted by the Doyen Flame, its power grew even more. When the Golden Crow manifestation spread its wings, a rain of fire fell.

These flames burned right through the barrier around Heaven Screen Mountain, causing countless people to cry out.

However, the scene they expected didn’t occur. While the rain of flame might be capable of burning small holes into the barrier, the holes quickly recovered as soon as they appeared.

“This Golden Crow Flame is actually capable of piercing the barrier around Heaven Screen Mountain. Even Heaven Saints would have to avoid it.” Sighs rang out from the crowd, stating that Huo Qianwu was absolutely terrifying.

“Long Chen, do you have any final words?” Huo Qianwu stood there like a flame goddess, looking down on Long Chen.

“If this is your strongest trump card, I can’t even be bothered to speak to you,” Long Chen snorted. As he clenched Evilmoon in his hand, his black robes billowed despite the absence of wind. His long hair slowly started to flutter, and a sharp murderous aura rose around him.

“With death at hand, your mouth is still tough. Hmph, I won’t kill you in one move. First, I’ll let you savor the feeling of regret and despair.”

Huo Qianwu extended her arm and clenched her hand toward Long Chen. The sea of flames behind her then raged as a giant hand emerged from it, instantly covering the entire world.

This move elicited countless startled cries. No one had ever seen such a large-scale attack before. Dodging it seemed impossible. The scope of the attack was immense, with the giant hand covering everything in sight, including both Long Chen and Huo Qianwu.

However, Huo Qianwu passed right through it. The hand ultimately only grasped Long Chen.

“Is it over in one move?!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Even the Heaven Saints thought like this. If they were in Long Chen’s position, they wouldn’t be able to dodge this enormous attack. They could only rely on their Heaven Saint power to fight head-on.

When this giant flame hand rapidly condensed around Long Chen, a thunderous roar rang out from within him.

“Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor!”

When this majestic dragon cry rang out, the giant flame hand quivered and exploded.

“What?!”

A blood-colored divine radiance spread, pushing back the flames. Seeing this, the other experts knew that Long Chen’s powerful Blood Qi was forcing the sea of flames back. They then saw Long Chen wreathed in flames, his body covered in blood-colored scales, and a blood-colored cloak draped over his back.

“His technique...”

Xing Wujiang’s pupils shrank. He had seen Long Chen use the Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor before, but the aura of his dragon blood was completely different this time.

Every scale on Long Chen was now ablaze, with dragon-shaped runes flowing within it. At this moment, a sacred dragon might scoured against heaven and earth, even surpassing the pressure of the Heavenly Fate Disk. Blood-colored dragon runes flickered in his eyes, and the flames burning around him were also the color of blood.

“This is the Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor in its strongest state, and it’s my first time using it. To use your words, after seeing this, you can die with no regrets.” Long Chen’s voice echoed throughout heaven and earth. His aura did not lose out to that of Huo Qianwu who was backed by the Heavenly Fate Disk. In fact, he appeared even sharper and more domineering than her.

When Long Chen destroyed Huo Qianwu’s attack, even the vice hall master was startled. Long Chen’s power far exceeded his expectations.

Jiang Yiban and the others’ expressions also changed. None of them had expected Long Chen to be this powerful. They now realized that Long Chen would have been able to charge through their blockade without Xing Wujiang’s interference last time. Without enough preparation, they wouldn’t have been able to stop him. In fact, some of them might die if they were caught off-guard.

Thinking of this, Jiang Yiban and the others secretly wiped off some sweat. They had underestimated the power of the youngest dean in the High Firmament Academy’s history. Their contempt toward him almost cost them their lives.

Seeing this scene, Xing Wujiang clenched his fists. Although he knew that Long Chen had been holding back the whole time, he hadn’t expected it to be this much. What Xing Wujiang didn’t know was that within the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art that Long Chen trained in, there was a technique involving burning dragon blood. The Dragon Blood Battle Armor activated with that technique simply could not be compared to the ordinary one.

However, this technique posed such an immense burden on the body that Long Chen had never wanted to use it. He was worried about injuring himself and couldn’t maintain this state for long. Once he exhausted his dragon blood, he would enter a weakened state, and then he would be unable to deal with the other dangers.

Another reason was that while burning his dragon blood power was easy, replenishing it was much more difficult. It took a great deal of time to recover.

Long Chen wouldn’t normally use this move so lightly. However, having cast aside all his misgivings, he had stopped always taking the long view and restraining himself. Now, free of those worries, he only cared about the present. He would deal with the consequences when they came.

Blood-colored flames burned around Long Chen, scouring the world like waves. Most terrifying of all, his aura continued to rise as if there was no limit.

Pointing Evilmoon straight at the shocked Huo Qianwu, Long Chen declared. “Let me see just how much power a so-called Heavenly Chosen has!”

Suddenly, Long Chen swayed, leaving a line of afterimages and a trail of blood-colored flames as he charged straight at Huo Qianwu.
