Chapter 4505 You’re Really Ugly

Surrounded by the flames and lightning, the translucent figure lost his ability to conceal himself. Within this domain, his abilities were greatly limited.

Finally, Long Chen managed to lock onto his target with Spiritual Strength, a task that proved exceedingly challenging to do.

This expert had first used an illusory clone to trick Long Chen, followed by a solid clone on the second occasion. In essence, both figures were manifestations of the same individual.

Having forced his opponent to split his essence, qi, and spirit equally, Long Chen took this chance to counterattack.

As long as Long Chen didn’t give his opponent time to recall his clone, he could potentially kill the clone or even his opponent.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger attacked together. Between them, Lei Linger was slightly stronger, so Long Chen chose to work together with Huo Linger rather than having them both work together.

As the sea of swords tore through the heavens, Huo Linger’s white flame lotus spread, completely sealing their target’s path.

In front of this combined attack, the translucent figure snorted and put away his sword, replacing it with a flag. The emergence of this flag shattered Long Chen’s composure, disrupting his ability to remain calm. A surge of killing intent erupted in his eyes.

This flag bore an image of auspicious clouds, yet they deviated from the typical white hue, instead emanating a violet glow with a sacred aura. Long Chen and Huo Linger’s attacks simply disappeared within the violet light, effortlessly consumed by its radiant presence.

Long Chen was shocked and enraged. The flag contained the power of violet blood and possessed an ancient, desolate aura. The unimaginable quantity of violet blood essence gathered within it left Long Chen astounded.

It could be considered a bit similar to the nether dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, as it had accumulated endless energy over the years. In comparison, an individual’s power seemed so minuscule.

“Don’t you think your violet blood race’s power is very amazing?” taunted that figure.

Although no one could see his face, everyone could imagine that his expression was one of disdain right now.

Long Chen’s head buzzed with disbelief. This fellow was actually using the power of violet blood against him, a descendant of the violet blood race. Nothing could be more contemptuous than this.

This flag had condensed the blood of countless experts of the violet blood race, and Long Chen sensed auras even stronger than Saints from it. However, these auras carried an overwhelming sense of sorrow and grief.

To have their essence blood used by their enemies and turned into a weapon was an indescribable insult. At this moment, Long Chen’s fury exploded.

“Die!” Long Chen roared. Covered in starlight, he charged toward the translucent figure.

Huo Linger also started to chant, and the world trembled as her sacred scripture echoed through the surroundings.

At first, Long Chen had thought that their immediate attack would be able to restrain his opponent, but this person actually had a weapon that could directly nullify their attacks.

Having lost the initiative, they could only attempt to use their full force. Hence, they were now truly going all-out.

Long Chen’s fist was covered in the stars of the sky as it smashed toward his opponent, while Huo Linger’s divine flames condensed into a snow-white blade that made people’s souls almost freeze.

“You’re full of openings. I can kill you like slaughtering a chicken!” exclaimed that person as he swung the violet flag at Huo Linger.

BOOM!

Huo Linger’s blade collided with the violet flag, causing violet qi and white flames to erupt, filling the sky with their brilliance.

In the end, Huo Linger was sent flying by the impact, but her attack left the violet flag covered in frost and engulfed by burning white flames.

That figure was also knocked back several steps, surprised by Huo Linger’s terrifying power. Even with this powerful divine weapon, he wasn’t able to fully block it.

At this time, Long Chen arrived, not giving him a break. Long Chen was clenching his teeth furiously, seemingly on the brink of losing his rationality.

When Long Chen reached him, that figure smiled sinisterly.

“It’s over!”

Suddenly, that figure split into four, all holding a violet flag each. As Long Chen charged toward that figure, all four flags wrapped around him, instantly enveloping him

This technique caught everyone off guard. Furthermore, the four flags were not mere illusions but four equally terrifying divine weapons.

“Long Chen!”

In the distance, Yu Qingxuan screamed. They had been following Long Chen’s orders and going toward the vortex all this time. Hence, they were now too far and unable to help him even if they wanted to.

“What?!”

Suddenly, that figure let out a startled cry as the four flags binding Long Chen inflated.

BOOM!

In the end, the four flags binding Long Chen became covered in cracks, almost breaking apart.

Because of the backlash, the four figures all coughed up blood and hastily retreated. When the four flags opened their encirclement, a bronze cauldron could be seen where Long Chen was.

The moment those flags bound him, Long Chen summoned the Earth Cauldron. However, he couldn’t help sighing inside. Unfortunately, these flags were not a typical hard weapon. If they were a typical saber, spear, sword, or halberd-type weapon, they would have instantly turned to dust upon striking the Earth Cauldron.

“You…!”

That figure stared at Long Chen furiously, realizing that Long Chen had duped him by intentionally showing fake anger.

He had long since heard that Long Chen had a terrifying bronze cauldron that was likely the legendary Heaven Earth Cauldron. However, it didn’t seem as if Long Chen could use it to attack. In his mind, as long as he didn’t strike it, he would be fine.

That was why he had been on guard against it at first, but then, Long Chen went crazy upon seeing the violet flag. His Spiritual Strength fluctuations were chaotic, and his killing intent was blazing, which were signs that he had entered a berserk state.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

That was why this assassin had thought that he had grasped a chance to kill Long Chen. But now, he found that this chance was a fake.

If he hadn’t noticed something off and pulled back his violet flags before they tightened, they would have shattered.

This violet flag was a supreme treasure of the Lifehunter race, something passed down from their ancestors. If it was destroyed, there would be no chance to recreate it.

BOOM!

Just then, Long Chen was charging toward one of his clones, with seven stars flickering behind him. His killing intent had locked his opponent down firmly.

In response, the other clones attacked Long Chen as well, trying to save that one clone.

“Heavenly Flame Prison!”

Just as they moved, Huo Linger formed hand seals, and multiple layers of flame pillars soared into the heavens, blocking them.

Wielding the violet flags, the three figures attacked the flame pillars, destroying them one after another. However, there were just too many of them. There was no getting by them.

At this time, there was a huge explosion. Long Chen’s fist landed solidly on the violet flag, triggering an explosion of starlight that bathed the sky in violet brilliance.

The figure wielding the flag coughed up blood, and his previously translucent form materialized, exposing a pair of scarlet eyes. He was a brown-haired man whose face was so lean that it was almost skeletal.

“You’re really ugly.”

Long Chen’s foot slammed toward that person’s ugly face.
