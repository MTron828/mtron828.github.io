Chapter 2146 The Yin Yang World’s Sovereign Seal

“Yes, the news is that Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit is in Tian Xiezi’s hands,” said Zheng Wenlong

Upon hearing that it was in Tian Xiezi’s hands, Long Chen’s excitement diminished. If that person learned that Long Chen desperately needed the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit, he would rather destroy it than sell it to him.

“We have a collaboration with the Corrupt path as well. Thanks to the Nangong family and the Beitang family’s support, we’ve pooled the resources of dozens of powers and have started to branch out even further. The Corrupt path also wants to be part of that collaboration, but right now, many powers are still in a waiting state. They only take out one or two treasures while merely listing the rest. I saw the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit’s name on the list that the Corrupt path gave me. I thought I misread it when I first saw it,” said Zheng Wenlong. He knew that this matter was very urgent to Long Chen. Every time they met, Long Chen asked about it.

“Do your best to obtain it. The price doesn’t matter. But don’t let them know that I’m the one who wants it.” Although Long Chen knew that Zheng Wenlong was always steady, Long Chen still said this because the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit was just too important to him. This related to whether or not he would be able to condense the sixth star of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

“I will do my best to get it for you.” Zheng Wenlong nodded. Since the Corrupt path had put it on their list of treasures, it meant that they were willing to sell it.

However, he couldn’t promise anything. The Corrupt path and the other powers had wily old foxes amongst them. Without taking out something that moved them, they wouldn’t make any rash moves.

By only taking out one or two treasures and listing the rest, they were probing the Huayun Sect’s power. If the Huayun Sect thought that they could trick them into a useless investment, they were wrong.

If the Huayun Sect wanted to develop this business, they would need to bring out all their capital. Unfortunately, when it came to treasures on this level, they didn’t quite have the power to circulate them. It might take a long time before they could reach that level.

“Good. If it’s really impossible for you, I’ll simply charge into the Corrupt path and take it,” said Long Chen. He almost couldn’t wait. If he didn’t lack the power, he would really charge into the Corrupt path to take it.

“Don’t, I feel like there’s a high chance of success on my side. It’s not worth the risk,” said Zheng Wenlong hastily. He was worried about Long Chen getting hot-headed.

“Fine. I’ll leave this matter to you. Ah, I also brought some stuff for you. They should be useful.” Long Chen took out the materials he had extracted from the corpses of the Magical Beasts in the Wild World as well as the ores they had mined.

“Heavens! The crystal core of a peak twelfth rank Heavenly Qilin Beast, the horn of the Full Moon Earth Rhinoceros, the essence blood of the Deviled Earth Dragon, and... this is Phoenix Blood Immortal Gold, Glorious Star Mithril...”

Zheng Wenlong’s eyes almost popped out. Long Chen was once more amazed by Zheng Wenlong’s learning. He was able to recognize every item that he took out.

“Long Chen, where did you get these... ah, sorry, I shouldn’t have asked that.” Asking other people’s personal secrets was naturally taboo. Zheng Wenlong had been so excited that he forgot, and he immediately apologized.

Long Chen smiled. “We don’t need so many taboos between us. I only struck gold within a minor world. I know that even though those fellows agreed to collaborate, they won’t go all-out at the beginning. If you don’t bring out some of your own money, they won’t be swayed. Right now, I only have this much of the materials from the Magical Beasts. As for the divine ores, I can provide you with more in the future.”

The parts of the Magical Beasts that he needed had been kept aside. As for the rest, it was valuable but not usable, so Long Chen gave them to Zheng Wenlong.

There were hundreds of crystal cores of twelfth rank Magical Beasts, and a tenth of them had reached the peak of the twelfth rank. First ignoring just how valuable these were, just being able to take them out was enough to shock a group of people to death.

There was also the essence blood, skeletons, and divine ores. Each of them was incredibly precious. Adding on the Huayun Sect’s own capital, this would be enough for their business collaboration to truly start.

The Huayun Sect had felt like the weaker one in the collaboration with all these various powers, but with these resources, he was entirely capable of drawing the powers that were still watching into a full collaboration.

“Good. I hope you can get the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit.” Long Chen patted Zheng Wenlong on the shoulder and then left the Huayun Sect.

If even Zheng Wenlong was incapable of this, then no one else would have a chance either. Long Chen had already decided. If Zheng Wenlong couldn’t get it for him, then once he was stronger, he would charge into the Corrupt path to take it.

Originally, Long Chen had been planning on going to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, but instead, he changed paths and went straight to the entrance to the Yin Yang World.

He quickly reached the boundary into the Yin Yang World. After that, he took out a special barrier breaking talisman that Xia Chen had given him and crushed it. Faint ripples merged into his body and then vanished.

This was a special talisman used for avoiding the senses of formations. It was a kind of concealing talisman, but it was possible to see the user with the naked eye as it was entirely focused on concealing from formations.

Long Chen lowered his hood and silently warned himself that if someone provoked him, he would have to kick them or something instead of slapping them. Otherwise, it would be too easy to recognize him.

After concealing his aura, he flew closer. He didn’t sense anything odd. This place looked the same as before.

However, just as he was a few hundred miles away from the channel, the runes covering his body flickered ever so slightly. He had entered a formation.

“As expected, there’s a problem.” Long Chen narrowed his eyes. Looking around, he still didn’t see anything odd, but the flicker from the runes meant that there was a formation set up by someone here. He wasn’t a formation master, so he didn’t know any more.

“The High Priest really is amazing. He actually knew that this place would be the location of the qi flow eruption. So then there’s only one possibility for who set this formation up.”

Long Chen immediately thought of Pill Valley, as well as the strange scene of something trying to extract some of his blood when exiting the Brahma secret realm.

Flying around, Long Chen didn’t notice anything odd. He knew that whoever had set this formation up had to be a master capable of concealing it from people’s eyes. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just as he was about to enter the channel to the Yin Yang World, a strange force of repulsion appeared, blocking his path. If he forced his way through, he might be sensed by the master of the formation.

Not wasting time, Long Chen took a formation disc that Xia Chen had given him. He sliced his way through the formation and walked closer to the channel. Back then, one of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s Grand Elders had sent him and Ye Lingshan through here, giving them a head start.

Now, the channel was replaced with a murky mass of primal chaos. There was mist in the surroundings, making it impossible to see what was inside.

This was the entrance to the Yin Yang World. If the qi flow eruption occurred here, it might destroy this door. At that time, would the monsters of the Yin Yang World be able to charge in through the hole?

“They secretly stole the essence blood of a million geniuses to forcibly change the time and location of the qi flow eruption. Pill Valley, just what are you planning?”

Long Chen was about to leave when he heard the slightest noise from the mass of primal chaos. It was so faint that he thought it was a misperception.

Stopping his footsteps, he turned toward the mass of primal chaos. He vaguely began to see a giant seal inside. The seal was very indistinct, and then it became covered in mist once more.

Although it was barely discernible, Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. He had seen that seal before. The faint aura he could sense from it was also familiar.

Just at that moment, another light sound rang out from inside, and the seal appeared again. A flash of light pierced the mist, allowing Long Chen to see clearer.

It was definitely the Sovereign seal. It was red as blood. The power it exuded made Long Chen feel like an ant. There was no way he could be mistaken about this pressure. Only a Sovereign could do this.

Another light sound rang out, and through the Sovereign seal, Long Chen saw a blurry scene. Countless lifeforms were attacking the Sovereign seal.

“It’s the Blood race.”

Although the scene was extremely blurry, he could see the general shape of those lifeforms. It was the same lifeforms that had hunted him out of the Yin Yang World. He saw an endless horde of the Blood race’s lifeforms attacking the Sovereign seal, unleashing various techniques that crashed against it.

Although he couldn’t sense their auras, based on the scale of their attacks, he estimated that these attacks were probably comparable to Netherpassage experts.

Most shocking of all was their numbers. They seemed endless. The Sovereign seal shuddered ever so slightly as it silently endured the attacks.

The attacks caused bursts of the Sovereign seal’s power to erupt, rebounding the attacks. Some of the Blood race’s lifeforms were killed.

However, more of them replaced the fallen ones. They continued to attack, wave after wave, keeping up a continuous deluge on the Sovereign seal.

Long Chen was in the midst of staring closely at that scene when he felt a strange energy pull him up. Shocked, without even thinking about it, he slashed Evilmoon at the air above him.
