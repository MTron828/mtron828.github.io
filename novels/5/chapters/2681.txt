Chapter 2670 Heaven Slaughtering God Slaying Song

The strings of the Heavenly Daos shrank, transforming into an ancient seven-string zither that was identical to Zi Yan’s Southern Sea Zither.

When the Southern Sea Zither appeared, zither music immediately resounded throughout the world. The entire world became covered in a murderous aura.

At this moment, Sovereign Han Wei suddenly grabbed the Southern Sea Zither and used it as a weapon, swinging it at Long Aotian.

BOOM!

The dragon spear and the ancient zither collided, while black lightning exploded in an apocalyptic scene. Looking at this battle, people felt their hearts clench, as if an invisible hand was tightly squeezing them. They almost coughed up blood.

“A Sovereign is only on this level,” said Long Aotian as he continued pressing on with his spear.

Sovereign Han Wei’s expression was icy. She held the Southern Sea Zither in one hand, as she formed seals with the other hand.

Seeing those seals, Zi Yan muttered unconsciously to herself.

“Three…”

“Two…”

“One…”

Suddenly, the zither strings shook. Red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, and violet light exploded out of it, and an irresistible force blasted Long Aotian back. The void behind him crumbled into a giant black hole that sucked him inside.

The divine families’ experts cried out in shock. That black hole was a crack in the world, and anyone sucked inside would be ground to bits.

Chains shot out of Long Aotian’s manifestation, locking him to the world. He forcibly pulled himself out of the black hole. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Having just escaped from death, Long Aotian was shocked and infuriated. If he had reacted the slightest bit slower and been drawn deeper inside, there would have been no way for him to return. The line between life and death had been incredibly thin for him just now.

At this moment, a rainbow appeared behind Sovereign Han Wei. It was incredibly dazzling and beautiful, but others were unable to feel its beauty. Instead, they felt terror. The aura of that rainbow was icy-cold, and it contained boundless killing intent. It was as if that rainbow was made of countless lives.

“Little sister Zi Yan, watch closely. This is the technique your big sister came up with, the Heaven Slaughtering God Slaying Song. I will transmit it to you today.”

Sovereign Han Wei was like an icy killing goddess. Every single one of her words dripped with killing intent. Just hearing her made people feel like the fire of their souls would extinguish.

Suddenly, Sovereign Han Wei slammed her hand on the zither with no finger technique to speak of. It was just like a furious slam of her palm. At this moment, ripples burst out of the zither.

The ripples were like a heaven slaying sword. Everywhere they went, laws and Daos crumbled, while space and time fragmented.

“Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Attack!”

Long Aotian roared along with the nine dragons behind him. His dragon spear erupted with divine light, stabbing forward.

BOOM!

As the power of the spear was blasted apart, Long Aotian’s body shuddered intensely like he was struck by lightning. He then fell back, hacking up blood.

This full-power attack contained the power to wipe out the heavens and destroy the earth. The killing intent it contained was shocking, and all life had to lower its head toward it. It was an unblockable attack.

The music of the Grand Dao had been transformed into a musical blade that struck the sea, causing it to explode. It left a giant cut that allowed people to see the bottom of the sea, the layers of formations at the bottom, as well as the looks of despair from the sea demons within the formations.

At this moment, countless formations blew apart, and the sea demons inside were wiped out of existence.

The sea demons that were further away from the center were not touched by the blade, and yet they stiffened and floated onto the surface. While they appeared uninjured, their souls had been wiped out.

Sovereign Han Wei’s attack had overturned the sea. She had not only forced back Long Aotian, but she had also killed innumerable sea demons. Hence, countless corpses floated onto the surface of the sea. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples once more got to work on gathering them.

The bottom of the sea became busy as they saw sea demons supporting the formations, trying to prevent the power of Sovereign Han Wei’s attack from spreading any further.

“Those are Heaven Merging experts!”

Suddenly, startled cries rang out. From the crack in the sea, it was possible to see tens of thousands of sea demons at work, and they were all Heaven Merging existences.

“No wonder they dared to so openly take Long Chen’s karmic luck pearl. They have that power.” Now people understood why the dragon woman would undergo her tribulation here. It was because the entire sea demon race was supporting her.

“It truly is a case of courting death. The five Sovereigns have descended upon the territory of the sea demon race, locking down this entire region of the sea. They can’t even leave this place. With a few more blows from Sovereign Han Wei, they’ll be wiped out.”

The fact that the dragon woman had stolen Long Chen’s karmic luck pearl infuriated countless people. Hence, now that the sea demon race was suffering, they felt only delight in their misfortune.

Even though Sovereign Han Wei had dealt such a serious blow to them, the sea demons didn’t dare to retaliate. If they did, they would be sensed by the Heavenly Daos and be viewed as people undergoing tribulation. Then they would be wiped out.

At this moment, Sovereign Han Wei’s zither quivered and flipped through the air.

Heaven and earth flipped along with it, causing everyone to cry out in shock.

The world had suddenly flipped; the seawater began to fall. They were unable to tell what was up or down, left or right. As a matter of fact, countless people even coughed up blood. The laws of the Heavenly Daos had been inverted by this attack.

The ancient zither then flipped toward Long Aotian. Due to the world flipping as well, he was flying toward the ancient zither.

Upon seeing this zither that contained a will to destroy heaven and earth, Long Aotian’s expression changed. He was finally experiencing how terrifying a Sovereign was, realizing that Sovereign Han Wei’s fight with the Nine-Headed Lion had been like toying with a monkey.

Now that she was using her full power, his soul quivered, and a strong feeling of death filled his heart. If he couldn’t block this attack, he would die.

Long Aotian clenched his teeth. At this moment, the pit of his stomach suddenly glowed. Long Aotian’s essence, qi, and spirit instantly condensed into one, and a ray of lightning light shot out, striking the zither.

When that divine light appeared, Long Chen’s eyes were filled with killing intent. His body involuntarily quivered.
