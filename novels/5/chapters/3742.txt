Chapter 3731 Blood-Soaked World

Weng Tianhao actually cut through the spatial restrictions with the lightning-clad Wild Blade and attacked Long Chen.

“Is he not afraid of losing his qualifications for entering the three thousand worlds?!”

Although Weng Tianhao and Long Chen were already standing in front of the gate, any mishap that occurred at this time might result in them being rejected.

Weng Taibei’s expression also changed when he saw this. He hadn’t expected Weng Tianhao to be so brazen. To take such a risk just for Long Chen was completely not worth it.

All the other experts had almost entered the three thousand worlds, as they weren’t as crazy as Weng Tianhao. Entering the three thousand worlds was far more important.

Weng Tianhao instantly appeared in front of Long Chen, and his Wild Blade erupted with lightning.

“Sorry, I’m worried about you dying in the three thousand worlds at someone else’s hand, so it would be better for me to take your life right now. Let me see what kind of disciple someone like Xia Guhong can raise.” Weng Tianhao smiled sinisterly.

Although Long Chen and Xia Guhong called each other brother, Weng Tianhao still thought that their connection was not ordinary. Even if they weren’t master and disciple in name, they definitely did have such a relationship.

Xia Guhong had been Weng Taibei’s opponent for so many years. So, if Weng Tianhao could kill Long Chen in front of Xia Guhong, it would be winning back the face that Weng Taibei had lost all those years ago.

A lightning sea appeared and roared behind Weng Tianhao, and the Wild Blade’s lightning runes revolved. The gate actually quivered because of this blade.

“What a terrifying thunderforce!”

Even Divine Venerates were shocked. Weng Tianhao was still nothing more than a peak Divine Lord. If he became an Immortal King, he would truly possess the power to challenge Divine Venerates.

BANG!

Weng Tianhao’s blade slashed through the air and came to a sudden stop right in front of Long Chen.

“What?!”

Everyone was shocked to find Long Chen spread his arms and clamp them down right on top of the Wild Blade.

“Catching a World Domain divine item with his bare hands?!” People didn’t dare to believe their eyes.

Dragon marks had appeared on the backs of his left and right hands. When thunderforce wrapped around Long Chen’s arms, an explosive power thundered in people’s ears.

“Long Chen is also capable of controlling thunderforce?!”

Just then, a giant dragon appeared behind Long Chen. It was Lei Linger who transferred her thunderforce into Long Chen’s hands.

Thunderforce exploded and rumbled, enveloping both of them. After that, the sea of lightning widened.

But all of a sudden, countless cracks appeared in the sky. The huge gate quivered and began to shrink.

Weng Taibei’s expression changed. “Tianhao, don’t waste your time on him! Enter the three thousand worlds now, or the gate will close!” 

Long Chen and Weng Tianhao were competing with thunderforce. With Lei Linger’s power pouring out, it was like Long Chen’s hands had fused with the Wild Blade. Weng Tianhao tried several times but was unable to blow away Long Chen’s hands.

Long Chen looked at Weng Tianhao with a sinister smile. Weng Tianhao suddenly had a bad feeling.

“You think you can make me lose my chance at the three thousand worlds? Keep dreaming! I’ll let you off for now, but I’ll definitely kill you in the three thousand worlds!” Weng Tianhao saw that the giant gate was many times smaller than before. With a trace of unwillingness, he pulled away.

It was like the Wild Blade was pulled out of its sheath. It came out of Long Chen’s grasp, leaving behind a sheath-like object in Long Chen’s hands.

Once the Wild Blade was pulled out, that sheath in Long Chen’s hands exploded, transforming into runes that once more flowed into the Wild Blade.

“Just wait!”

Weng Tianhao snorted. Seeing the gate rapidly shrinking, he dove in and vanished without a trace.

Long Chen also didn’t dare to tarry and charged in. Just as the gate was about to slam shut, he narrowly managed to make his way in, causing countless people to sweat on his behalf.

Even Xia Guhong couldn’t help sighing with relief once he saw Long Chen enter the three thousand worlds.

Now, all that remained in the Violet Flame Heaven Capital were the elders of the various powers. Although all of them had some enmities between them, they weren’t youngsters anymore, so they weren’t so impetuous. They simply sat in their locations, waiting for their disciples to once more appear.

…

“What a shame. I was just a little bit off of linking up with the Wild Blade’s item-spirit,” sighed Lei Linger.

Previously, they had only defended against Weng Tianhao’s attack to buy time, time for Lei Linger to commune with the Wild Blade’s item-spirit. As long as she was able to brand the Wild Blade with her own runes, then this lightning divine weapon would be changing masters.

However, ultimately, they still let Weng Tianhao escape. They had only just been a bit off, so Lei Linger stamped her feet angrily.

“It’s fine. You fed the item-spirit so much of your energy just now. Although your power isn’t as pure as Weng Tianhao’s, your thunderforce has variety, and the Wild Blade has already become addicted to it. In the future, Weng Tianhao won’t be able to satisfy it with just his pure energy. When we meet next time, we won’t even need to fight it. It will throw itself to our side,” comforted Long Chen with a smile.

“Really?” Lei Linger was delighted to hear that.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She had used up a great deal of her energy this time, having fed it her own core energy. She was naturally furious to end up with nothing.

“Of course. Wild Blade’s item-spirit isn’t very intelligent and acts according to instinct. It could not be easier to deal with it. Don’t be impatient. Next time we meet, the Wild Blade will be yours,” promised Long Chen.

“Hehe, good. I’ll have the Wild Blade, and Huo Linger will have the True Fire Sword. Together, we’ll help big brother beat up the bad people.” Lei Linger giggled excitedly.

Seeing that Lei Linger was no longer depressed, Long Chen sighed with relief. In truth, Long Chen had had a chance to snatch the Wild Blade just now.

However, that would have ended up using even more of her core energy, causing her to fall into a slumber. That was not something that Long Chen wanted to see.

Long Chen had to have Lei Linger maintain her peak condition. Only then would he dare to undergo his next tribulation. Without her help, there was no way for him to pass through his sure-death heavenly tribulation.

After comforting Lei Linger, he had her rest. Only then did he have a chance to examine this new world.

Long Chen found himself in a desolate world, and all he saw was rocks. He then squatted down and picked up a stone. It had blood-colored veins inside of it.

“This was soaked in fresh blood. However, the blood wasn’t from the human race, demonic beast race, or Nether race. It has an aura that I’ve never sensed before.” Long Chen examined the blood-colored rock closely. He sniffed it, but too much time had passed for him to recognize this blood.

“So everything that we saw was true. The location was most likely inside the three thousand worlds. Perhaps this place is hiding a heaven-shaking secret.”

Long Chen looked further and saw no end to this desolate world. In the end, he could only randomly pick a direction to go.

“Let’s see whether or not the blessing of the Butterfly Spirit race works. I want to taste the flavor of luck as well.”
