Chapter 4098 Fullmoon Race Leader

Xu Changchuan was emotional upon seeing the gate. This was one of the entrances to the Fullmoon race. In fact, it was the main entrance.

As long as they passed through it, he could take everything that was his. However, this gate wasn’t so easy to pass through.

“Young master, it’s you?”

A Heaven Venerate appeared and cried out in delight.

“Uncle Yun, it’s you?” Xu Changchuan was also delighted to see him. This was a Heaven Venerate that had looked after him ever since he was young.

“This is wonderful! Don’t go in there, it’s a giant trap,” said Uncle Yun while looking over everyone.

Xu Changchuan’s heart shuddered. As expected, they really had set up a heaven-encompassing net inside.

“Come with me. I’ll bring you somewhere safe.” Uncle Yun then grabbed Xu Changchuan’s arm. However, Xu Changchuan’s expression suddenly changed.

“Uncle Yun, you…!”

Xu Changchuan felt a terrifying power envelope him. When he saw Uncle Yun’s smile, he instantly realized that he had also been bought.

“Die.” Uncle Yun smiled sinisterly, and explosive power poured into Xu Changchuan’s body.

However, this power didn’t explode, and instead, Uncle Yun died as an icy wooden branch pierced his body.

“I knew you weren’t sincere. If you really wanted to help, you’d have long since told the race leader. Why would you be here, guarding the tree stump for the rabbit’s return?” sneered Long Chen.

Uncle Yun had appeared far too suddenly, leaving Long Chen stunned at first. But then he sensed the intense fluctuations inside Uncle Yun’s body and instantly had a bad feeling, so Long Chen directly told Uncle Tree to stop him.

It all happened suddenly. Fortunately, Long Chen reacted quickly enough. Otherwise, Xu Changchuan would have died to someone he trusted.

“How hateful.” Xu Changchuan felt a mix of emotions, not expecting his Uncle Yun to betray him. The Heaven Venerate by his side was also stunned. Even now, he hadn’t reacted.

“We’re charging in!” ordered Long Chen.

“Brother Long, we can’t!” Xu Changchuan was startled to hear that. If there was already a trap on the outside, wouldn’t the inside be a den of dragons? Once they went in, they would never leave.

However, Long Chen ignored Xu Changchuan. Xia Chen was already sending the flying boat through.

When the flying boat passed through the gate, the dim world suddenly grew bright. In this place, a full moon hung in the sky, its gentle divine radiance illuminating every corner of this world.

This was their first time seeing the light of the moon shining as brightly as the sun. Furthermore, in this world, the light was gentle, making them feel as though they had entered a peaceful holy land.

However, within this holy land, icy killing intents shattered the peace.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You dare to barge into the Fullmoon race?! Don’t leave a single one of them alive!”

Countless ferocious auras surged forth, accompanied by over ten Heaven Venerates and hundreds of Earth Venerates. At the same time, an ear-piercing alarm resounded throughout heaven and earth.

“Stop! I am Xu Changchuan!”

Xu Changchuan shouted, but he couldn’t even hear his own voice over that ear-piercing alarm. In that instant, he realized that his enemies had come prepared.

They would give him no chance to ask for help. Most likely, when Uncle Yun noticed them, he immediately sent a message to the people inside.

Countless attacks shot toward them. These people clearly knew who they were, but they didn't give Long Chen and the others a chance to speak.

Like this, even if they learned that they had killed the wrong person, they could simply say that it was a mistake. Then they would shed most of the responsibility, and the punishment would be shared amongst all of them. Even if they killed a successor candidate, they wouldn’t be badly punished.

Facing so many attacks, Xu Changchuan only had one thought. It was over. Even his Heaven Venerate protector shut his eyes as none of them could receive such attacks.

However, just then, countless roots broke out of the ground, weaving into a giant wall in front of them, but they rapidly exploded under this torrent of attacks.

The roots were all blown away, and a qi wave came crashing toward them. It was then that Uncle Tree, with a sudden flourish of his wooden staff, intervened.

Arcane runes flew through the air, shattering all their attacks. All on his own, Uncle Tree managed to block their killing blow.

After all, Uncle Tree was from the Undying race, so offense wasn’t his strong point. However, his race excelled in the realm of defense, and it was being showcased right now.

The wooden wall eroded most of their power, and by the time their attacks arrived, they were powerless.

Just like that, Uncle Tree managed to block the attacks of so many experts. Xu Changchuan almost cried out when he saw this.

The Heaven Venerates were also dumbfounded. All they knew was the information that Uncle Yun sent them, which indicated that there were only a Heaven Venerate and a group of youngsters. How did such a terrifying existence end up appearing?

“Friend of the Undying race, may I know what brings you to my Fullmoon race? If you don’t explain yourself clearly, I might not be able to let you leave.”

Just then, a voice filled with dignity and power rang out, echoing throughout this world. After that, the fabric of space twisted, and a large, muscular man appeared.

The pressure that he gave off was suffocating. Even though he was also a Heaven Venerate, his aura was far stronger than anyone else here.

“Race leader! Your child is back!” Upon seeing this large man, Xu Changchuan wept from emotion. He shot over, sobbing.

“Changchuan, what is it?” This large man was startled to see Xu Changchuan.

“Race leader, you must find justice for your child! There are people within the family who wish to kill me so I cannot compete for the position of successor!” shouted Xu Changchuan.

Upon hearing this, a noticeable shift in expressions coursed through the gathered assembly. Even the countenance of the race leader darkened, his intent to kill emanating palpably as his gaze swept over the crowd. In return, those people lowered their heads, not daring to look at him.

How could he not understand after seeing this? He clenched his fists furiously. However, he didn’t explode right at that moment. Instead, he looked at Uncle Tree and cupped his fists to him.

“Thank you, friend of the Undying race, for escorting my family’s child back. My Fullmoon race will definitely repay you.”

“There’s no need to thank me. If you need to thank someone, thank my master. He is the one who made me do this,” said Uncle Tree indifferently. He directly retreated behind Long Chen.

“Human race?”

When he saw them, the race leader instantly frowned. He seemed displeased, as if he loathed the human race. That made Long Chen’s heart quiver slightly. Were the rewards about to vanish from existence?
