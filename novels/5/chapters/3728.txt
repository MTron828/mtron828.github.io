Chapter 3717 Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruit

Weng Tianyao stepped forward and pointed his sword at Long Chen. Arcs of lightning then flashed on top of his sword in brilliant, blinding light. This was a lightning attribute divine weapon. When this sword appeared, lightning raged in the nine heavens.

“The Wild Blade? Isn’t that Weng Taibei’s personal divine weapon? Why is it in his hands? What is going on?!” A startled cry rang out.

The Wild Blade was a divine weapon that Weng Taibei had obtained in an ancient secret realm during his youth. It followed him through battle and gained its own reputation, so it was a weapon that caused countless experts to quiver in fear.

It was a very famous World Domain divine item. Furthermore, lightning attribute divine weapons were very rarely seen, making it even more famous.

Legend had it that Weng Taibei had used this Wild Blade to defeat all his opponents. Although he was defeated by Xia Guhong twice, he relied on this divine weapon to flee both times. It could be said that this divine weapon was equivalent to Weng Taibei’s life.

For this weapon to now appear in Weng Tianyao’s hands, it seemed that the relationship between the two of them was not ordinary. Although the two of them were surnamed Weng, having the same surname in the immortal world was nothing special. Even between father and son, their relationship might not be very close at all.

After all, in the immortal world, experts had immense longevity and could produce many offspring in one life. Thus, many times it was master-disciple relationships that were closer than father and son.

For Weng Taibei to pass down his personal divine weapon to Weng Tianyao, it seemed that he viewed him as the one to inherit his legacy.

When Weng Tianyao took out his sword, lightning appeared all around him. A shocking aura then erupted along with a terrifying pressure. His battle intent locked onto Long Chen.

Long Chen slowly smiled. He had long since known that this damn fatty would not be helping him. He was praising Long Chen to get him killed. His praise turned him into everyone’s target.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

No cultivator liked to be beneath others, especially when it came to those within the same realm. They had to decide who was stronger. It was unknown just how many heavenly geniuses ended up dying just because of this.

It was a very simple plan with an obvious purpose. However, it was very effective. Countless Supreme experts were now eyeing Long Chen, itching to fight him. It could be said that Enpuda had achieved his goal.

In front of all their hostile gazes, Long Chen’s own arrogance was stimulated. He coldly said, “I like that weapon of yours. I’ll take it from your corpse.”

This response caused a stir amongst those experts. This was an incredibly domineering response. Two experts were about to fight.

“Hahaha, big words! Since you dare to say such big words, why are you hiding in the back like a tortoise? Do you refuse to step out?” sneered Weng Tianyao.

“I just can’t be bothered to waste the effort. Once I beat you, your old fellow will interfere. Then my big brother Guhong will also interfere. But I don’t want to make my big brother get involved in my matters. I feel like their own enmity should be settled by themselves,” said Long Chen.

“You think you can definitely beat me?” sneered Weng Tianyao mockingly.

“Naturally, I will beat you. But killing you will be a bit difficult. After all, you have so many people, and we don’t. There’s also that sinister fatty and the mule-faced Liao Bencang. They’ll definitely take advantage of a chaotic fight here. So, don’t shout in the streets like some vixen. You’re only exposing the limit of your intelligence. If you want to challenge me, I’ll await you in the three thousand worlds.”

After saying that, Long Chen turned toward the others. “I know that you’ve fallen for fatty Enpuda’s ploy. You want to trample my corpse for your own prestige. But that’s fine. Cultivation is a path of no return. I don’t mind others challenging me, as experts aren’t made through restraint or reason. Anyone can use any reason or excuse to challenge me. In the same vein, I don’t need any reason or excuse to kill you. Just like He Changtian, you can come at me arrogantly and then beg for mercy after being crushed, but it’s meaningless. Everyone is an adult and responsible for their own actions. So go ahead and challenge me if you want. But after being defeated, don’t bother kneeling and begging for mercy, because I won’t have any mercy.”

Perhaps it was due to experiencing too much, but Enpuda’s current move felt like child’s play.

However, it was this child’s play that actually drew a bunch of fools against Long Chen. During normal times, if they challenged him, people could fairly exchange pointers. It would mean nothing.

But in the three thousand worlds, everyone’s time was precious. There would also be countless dangers all around. For them to challenge him at such a time, that would be equal to trying to take his life. Thus, as long as anyone was so brainless as to challenge him, he would definitely slaughter them.

Based on his principles, Long Chen would kindly give them a single warning in advance. If they didn’t listen, they couldn’t blame him. In the end, when he killed them, his conscience wouldn’t even twitch.

Also, the moment Long Chen killed He Changtian, he made a shocking discovery. A red fruit had condensed at the very top of the Heavenly Dao Tree. 

That fruit contained flame runes and gave off terrifying fluctuations. Those were the fluctuations of a Supreme expert.

Long Chen had killed the Alldevil race’s Supreme heavenly genius Alldevil Tianye. He had also killed the Bloodkill Hall’s Ji Wuying. However, neither had caused any reaction in the Heavenly Dao Tree. Long Chen had assumed that the Heavenly Dao Tree’s fruits were limited to Primals.

However, after killing He Changtian, the Heavenly Dao Tree actually produced a strange fruit. Based on his experience, this was probably a Supreme fruit.

Long Chen then thought of Alldevil Tianye and Ji Wuying’s deaths. Ju Wuying’s Supreme Bone had been transferred to Ju Wuming somehow; it hadn’t returned to heaven and earth. Thus, the Heavenly Dao Tree was unable to absorb its power. As for Alldevil Tianye, his Supreme Bone had been taken by Guo Ran. 

However, He Changtian was slain, and his Supreme Blood was scattered throughout heaven and earth before being absorbed by the Heavenly Dao Tree. This condensed into a Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruit, and this discovery startled Long Chen.

At this moment, he couldn’t help forming a very moving thought, and that was to slay even more Supreme experts. Then wouldn’t he have even more Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruit?

However, slaughtering people to plunder their wealth when they hadn’t offended him would make Long Chen feel bad. But thanks to this speech from Enpuda, he became everyone’s target. While Long Chen was enraged, he had his own evil thoughts. Since they wanted to die, they shouldn’t blame him.

“If you don’t dare to fight, then just say it. Why waste so many words? Are you covering up your fear? The High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean is even worse than dogshit.” Another Supreme expert beside Weng Tianyao sneered disdainfully. He clearly thought that Long Chen was just making excuses.

“Long Chen, if you want to kill people, just go ahead. As long as I, Xia Guhong, am present, no one will dare to interfere,” said Xia Guhong. The moment Xia Guhong spoke, countless people’s hearts quivered.
