Chapter 4272 Seven Stars Converge, Strongest Attack

BOOM!

Explosive qi waves rose from beneath Long Chen’s feet, transforming into a pillar of light that soared into the sky. As it did, the void cracked and creaked as terrifying astral winds cut through the world like sharp blades.

“Not good! Defend!”

Feng Fei shouted. After all, there was no dodging such a thing. Following her orders, the Jiang clan’s top experts shot to the front and summoned a giant shield.

The other experts also reacted similarly, summoning their own defenses to receive those wild astral winds.

BOOM!

The giant ripples swept through the battlefield, pierced the barrier, crossed the sea ring around the martial stage, and crashed toward the Sage King Prefecture’s buildings.

Upon impact, countless buildings instantly collapsed. The astral winds crushed the buildings in every direction.

“Just what kind of power is that?!”

Some innate Heaven Venerates had activated their full-power defenses but still felt their Blood Qi churning uncontrollably within them, as if it might erupt at any moment. They were filled with terror.

Qi waves continued to scour the world as the barrier was completely obliterated. However, some invisible law still separated the martial stage from the outside world.

Long Aotian was blown back, his feet dragging on the void as he tried to stabilize his body. He was shocked and enraged at being involuntarily pushed back.

When the astral winds finally settled and Long Chen’s aura stabilized, people saw Long Chen’s seven-color divine ring revolving, but the astral sea inside of it was no longer moving. Instead, seven stars within that sea of stars blazed as brightly as suns.

These stars emitted a sacred and majestic radiance that bathed Long Chen in their glow, akin to the brilliance of seven suns concentrated solely on Long Chen.

It was so bright that people could no longer see Long Chen’s face. However, just his figure alone possessed the power to shake their very souls, causing them to have a sense of reverence deep within them.

At this moment, Long Chen was like a celestial emperor, a transcendent existence that could look down on all others, exuding an indescribable air.

As Long Chen raised the Minghong Saber, its saber cry shook the very heavens. The Minghong Saber was crying out in excitement.

Blinding stars then illuminated on the Minghong Saber. With every star that lit up, its aura grew explosively.

Long Chen looked at the Minghong Saber with a hint of sadness. His heart was unwilling, but he knew that this was what the Minghong Saber wanted most.

As seven stars lit up on the Minghong Saber, all the murderous aura within heaven and earth was sucked dry, and an infinite apocalyptic power was concentrated in the Minghong Saber.

Upon seeing this, Long Aotian’s expression darkened. With a bellow, he raised his sword with both hands, and the three petals manifestation behind him spun rapidly, releasing a torrent of runes and brilliant divine radiance that flowed into his sword. Simultaneously, his manifestation rapidly dimmed.

“DIE!”

Long Chen and Long Aotian then roared at the same time, their killing intent erupted. This was the clash between two destined archenemies. With each of them set on victory, there was no longer any possibility of retreat.

“Wilde, get back!”

Upon seeing this scene Liu Ruyan shouted and Wilde obediently rushed back.

The next moment, Liu Ruyan’s true body spread out, and countless willow branches gathered in front of them. Chu Yao then placed her hands on Liu Ruyan’s back, pouring immense wood energy into Liu Ruyan’s body.

Her willow branches then weaved together into thousands of barriers protecting everyone.

“Li Qi, Mingyuan!” shouted Xia Chen.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Understood!”

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan clapped their hands together, conjuring earthen walls to layer on top of Liu Ruyan’s defenses.

Unfortunately, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan couldn’t use much power because the martial stage was suspended in the air. Since there was not much earth energy for them to draw on, they could only rely on their own core energy.

After they finished, Xia Chen gritted his teeth. Hundreds of formation discs suddenly appeared in midair, forming a giant shield on top of Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s defenses.

The Dragonblood Legion’s side moved very smoothly as their cooperation was great. On the other hand, Lian Wuying and the others’ expressions darkened.

“Quick, set up defenses!”

Ye Wuchen and the others shouted in terror. Seeing the Dragonblood Legion set up this absolute defense, they instantly had a bad feeling.

BOOM!

Just as they were hastily putting up defenses, Long Chen’s Minghong Saber clashed fiercely with Long Aotian’s Seven Peak Sword. The outcome was a colossal explosion that shattered both divine weapons.

This explosion triggered a massive mushroom cloud, its berserk power spreading in every direction, overwhelming even Eternal divine weapons.

BANG!

The martial stage finally collapsed, and numerous experts were wiped out of existence despite having summoned their strongest defenses.

Only some stronger factions were able to survive this blow. When the martial stage exploded, they were sent tumbling through the air.

The terrifying ripple then continued through the Sage King Prefecture, flattening the land and sending countless experts flying miserably. Within the chaos, it was unknown just how many people were crushed to death.

Once that terrifying ripple passed, Xia Chen’s grand formation instantly exploded, and the immense power crushed Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s earthen barriers.

Under this overwhelming force, Liu Ruyan's defenses quickly caved in. Given the vast number of people she was protecting and the extensive area, it was as if she was enduring dozens of times the impact that others were facing.

Fortunately, when their outer barrier exploded, Liu Ruyan’s weaving branches sent them bouncing out like a ball, reducing the pressure. In the end, her defenses did not break.

However, as they bounced back, the people inside were in a difficult spot. Some almost coughed up blood, but at least, they managed to survive.

BOOM!

When Liu Ruyan undid her defenses and everyone saw the scenery before them, they were all dumbfounded. They didn’t know where they were.

The martial stage was gone, and the sea ring no longer existed. Countless buildings lay in ruins, leaving no trace of anything familiar behind.

If they could not see countless figures in the surroundings, they would even think that they had been teleported to some foreign land.

Guo Ran and the others looked around for the center of the battlefield and cheered when they saw Long Chen still standing. He was covered in blood but still standing in the air like an undefeatable battle god.

Long Chen suddenly moved. His Kunpeng wings flapped, and he shot down.
