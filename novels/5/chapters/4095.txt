Chapter 4084 Come At Me If You Have The Guts

As Long Chen walked into the hall, his gaze fell upon a group of over ten experts wearing the robes of the Soaring Dragon Company. In particular, their leader, a Heaven Venerate, was blazing with killing intent.

A couple of months ago, Long Chen might need to be a bit careful. But now, he no longer felt much fear toward Heaven Venerates.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

His source of confidence was the completely refined Kunpeng wings. At this full speed, even Heaven Venerates could not catch him.

Moreover, the Dragonblood warriors’ combined might was now enough to challenge Heaven Venerates. Even if they had to face a Heaven Venerate directly, they would still have the ability to fight.

Most importantly, Long Chen had seen so many Heaven Venerates that he no longer found them special.

The Soaring Dragon Company had sent over ten people, with one Heaven Venerate among their ranks and the rest Earth Venerates. Although they still had mighty Blood Qi and could not be considered elderly, making them much stronger than the average Earth Venerates that Long Chen had fought, it didn’t matter. They were still Earth Venerate and unable to threaten him.

Looking at the Heaven Venerate indifferently, Long Chen curled his lips and said, “Can you not switch to a different opener? You don’t need to praise me every time like that. I already know that I’m brazen, and my guts have always been big. If you keep praising me like that, I’ll feel embarrassed.”

“Impudent brat!” barked one of the Earth Venerates, reaching back for the hilt of his blade.

Long Chen’s expression sank. “This conduct of yours is very dangerous. I know that you came to intimidate me, but that action will only anger me. As the Huayun Trading Company’s land isn’t for fighting, I don’t want to have to kill you here.”

This Earth Venerate was truly idiotic as he actually tried to use his qi to lock onto Long Chen and embarrass him.

However, he was far weaker than Long Chen, so his attempt was utterly futile. In Long Chen’s view, he was like a mouse trying to brandish fangs at him, making Long Chen feel the urge to slap him to death.

At this distance, if Long Chen wanted to kill him, not even that Heaven Venerate would be able to stop him.

However, Long Chen felt great respect for the Huayun Trading Company, so he didn’t wish to kill anyone on their territory.

In truth, he could have first slapped that idiot to teach him a lesson, but due to cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art during this time, his power had soared, leaving him unable to perfectly control it. He was afraid he might accidentally kill this Earth Venerate with his slap.

“You…!”

That Earth Venerate was enraged by Long Chen’s disdain for him, but he was also shocked that he couldn’t lock onto Long Chen. This indicated that Long Chen’s power was very likely above his, and Long Chen’s soul would have to be even stronger.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s people were surprised by Long Chen’s power. Based on their information, although Long Chen could defeat ordinary Divine Venerates, his power was below that of Earth Venerates.

However, all the Earth Venerates were unable to lock onto him, and that Heaven Venerate was also unable to see through Long Chen’s spiritual fluctuations.

“Was our information false?”

A thought rose in all of their minds at the same time.

What they didn’t know was that back then, Long Chen’s power truly was below that of an Earth Venerate. It was only after Long Chen entered the Vermilion Bird Empire and underwent the trial by fire, starting to cultivate the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, that he completely transformed. Although his realm hadn’t changed, his power could not be compared to before.

“Everyone, let’s talk nickel. Is there some misunderstanding between us? We can just resolve it with words. When doing business, it is amiability that makes you rich. Going to war is not the Business Dao,” said the guild master.

Within the hall, there were only three experts of the Huayun Trading Company, so in terms of number, they were outnumbered by the Soaring Dragon Company. Furthermore, the Soaring Dragon Company had come ferociously, practically waving their weapons, exuding frightening killing intent.

At this moment, their Heaven Venerate angrily said, “Hmph, I came here today to demand an explanation from the Huayun Trading Company. Long Chen has looted dozens of my Soaring Dragon Company’s strongholds in the Violet Flame Heaven. He is a hateful bandit who must be punished. For him to seek asylum in the Huayun Trading Company as soon as he arrives in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, he must be trying to shed responsibility for his actions. Furthermore, we suspect he is using your Huayun Trading Company to get rid of his stolen goods.”

The guild master was about to reply when Long Chen took the initiative. “What are you talking about? We’re all in the same profession. Why must we attack each other?”

“Who is in the same profession as you?!” barked the Heaven Venerate.

“How are we not? You plunder people secretly, while I plunder people openly. In essence, we’re the same. Also, you treat others as sacrifices, taking their wealth and then offering their lives as a sacrifice. You not only take people’s treasures, but you also kill them. As for me, I only take your wealth, not your lives. In this aspect, aren’t I much better than you?” declared Long Chen indignantly.

While speaking, Long Chen kept a close eye on their reactions. The Earth Venerates were only further enraged, but Long Chen saw the flicker of panic in the Heaven Venerate’s eyes.

It seemed that the matter of sacrifices was a high level secret in the Soaring Dragon Company, so only their most important members were aware of it.

“What nonsense are you spouting?” roared the Heaven Venerate. His expression was now one of a wrongfully accused victim, but icy killing intent now filled his eyes.

Wanting to kill someone to silence them? Long Chen instantly saw through his intentions.

“I’m sure everyone is well aware about whether or not I’m spouting nonsense. Do you really need me to speak more clearly? If you’re wise, you’ll scram now. Remember, don’t throw dirty water on the Huayun Trading Company, or well… you understand.” Long Chen chuckled at the Heaven Venerate.

This elder instantly understood. Long Chen wanted their enmity to not implicate the Huayun Trading Company. Otherwise, he would make this information public.

Hence, the elder was actually delighted to be told to scram. That meant that Long Chen was temporarily not planning on announcing anything.

“Hmph, my Soaring Dragon Company won’t leave this matter be! You, Long Chen, will pay the price sooner or later!” declared the Heaven Venerate.

Long Chen simply smiled. This elder at least wasn’t a complete idiot and could tell what Long Chen meant.

As long as they didn’t implicate the Huayun Trading Company, they could come at him as they pleased, and he would accompany them to the end. Did they really think that he would stop after just plundering a few of their branches? Did they think the enmity of the Bai clan’s brother and sister would be settled just like that? They were too naive.

“Goodbye!”

The Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerate cupped his fists to the guild master, flung his sleeve, and then led his party away.

Once they left, an Earth Venerate hastily asked that Heaven Venerate, “Senior, are we letting him off just like that?”

“Letting him off? Do you think that’s possible? Inform the Shadow race that we want Long Chen’s head! They can ask for any price.”

A cold light appeared in the Heaven Venerate’s eyes, while a sinister smile hung on his face.
