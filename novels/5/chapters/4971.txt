Chapter 4960 Long Qingyun

“What happened?”0

Seeing Long Ziwei in this state, Long Chen and Gui Jiu jumped. Long Ziwei was so severely wounded that they could see some exposed bones from the wounds.0

“Someone took my rank ten spot,” answered Long Ziwei dejectedly.0

Long Chen deduced that Long Ziwei must have been challenged and defeated. Long Chen scoffed, “You deliberately did not heal yourself just to present yourself in this sorry state, huh?”0

This little fellow had been encouraging Long Chen to fight in the arena. After all, Long Chen was also a member of the Long clan and qualified to participate in the rankings.0

However, Long Chen was not interested in it. He harbored no desire for fame within the Long clan, nor did he seek anything from them.0

Now, Long Ziwei arrived with a body riddled with wounds. Despite their severity, he could have easily healed them on the way here. His purpose in displaying his bloody condition to Long Chen was all too apparent.1DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Seeing that he was exposed, Long Ziwei didn’t even feel embarrassed. He directly said, “Boss, you don’t know the full story. I don’t know what medicine that fellow took, but he suddenly jumped way too far in power. If I lost fair and square, that would be one thing. But I can’t stomach being defeated by a cheater. 0

“Moreover, he didn’t just insult me; he also aimed his barbs at you and Saint Emperor Zhantian. Can you truly let that slide? Are you not going to confront him?”0

Seeing Long Ziwei’s fury, Long Chen smiled slightly. He knew that this fellow wanted him to fight. Even though Long Chen had refused, Long Ziwei didn’t give up. Perhaps he had exaggerated this story.0

Long Ziwei grew anxious when he saw that Long Chen didn’t believe him. Just as he prepared to elaborate, the void exploded, revealing a handsome man surrounded by a flock of people.0

“Long Qingyun!”1

Gui Jiu’s pupils shrank as he recognized this man. He was ranked eleventh on the Heaven Rankings.1

Long Qingyun looked a bit pale as he was injured, but that didn’t cover up the wild arrogance radiating out of him. It was obvious that Long Qingyun was the one who had beaten Long Ziwei.0

Long Ziwei didn’t get angry when he saw this man’s arrival, and instead, he suppressed a bit of surprised delight. On the surface, he gritted his teeth and demanded, “Long Qingyun, what are you doing here?!”2

Long Chen remained reclined on the rubble, appearing nonchalant. What amused him was the presence of two familiar faces among the people behind Long Qingyun.0

They were two women who had once been with Long Ziwei. Now, they stood behind Long Qingyun, their demeanor haughty as if they didn’t even recognize Long Ziwei. They turned sides faster than the turning of a page.3

“A dog really is a dog. After being beaten, you immediately run to your master. Unfortunately, your master is a useless coward who doesn’t even dare to show his face, hahaha!” Long Qingyun laughed, glancing at Long Chen who was leaning against the rubble on the plaza.1

“You can insult me, but you can’t insult the Saint Emperor’s son!” shouted Long Ziwei.1

“Saint Emperor? What dogshit. Who gave him that title? It was something that a bunch of mercenaries, who might as well be ants, came up with. Do you really think that it means anything?” sneered Long Qingyun.1

Long Ziwei trembled with what seemed like rage, but in truth, it was excitement. Internally, he urged, “Keep it up, don’t hold back! Push harder! Please, I’m begging you!”22

As if attuned to Long Ziwei’s inner desires, Long Qingyun glanced at Long Chen and remarked, “I hear that you are Long Zhantian’s son? Although I don’t like Long Zhantian, I have to admit that he really is powerful. But seeing his son hiding here like a turtle, I wonder if you really are his son, hahaha!”0

All of a sudden, Long Chen moved, scaring Long Qingyun and the others so much that they instantly retreated a few steps.0

However, Long Chen was just raising his hands and stretching lazily, causing Long Qingyun and the others to feel embarrassed.0

After that, Long Qingyun pointed his finger at Long Chen and directly challenged him. “Long Chen, if you have your father’s guts, you will accept my challenge on the martial stage!”0

Long Ziwei finally revealed a smile, thinking that he had finally succeeded. Now it was just up to Long Chen.0

Long Chen stretched while indifferently examining Long Qingyun, but then he shook his head. “How foolish. Long Ziwei was setting you up, and you really fell for it. Do you know that there are some holes that you can’t get out of once you jump in?”4

Long Ziwei stared blankly at Long Chen, who seemed to have read all his thoughts. He had thought that his acting skills were so good that Long Chen wouldn’t be able to tell.5

“What dogshit are you talking about? Do you dare to fight me or not!?” shouted Long Qingyun.0

“Deep down, don’t you already know the truth?” Long Chen spoke with indifference. “If you truly had the courage to challenge me, you wouldn’t insist on fighting me on a martial stage.”0

Long Ziwei grasped Long Chen’s implication instantly. Despite Long Qingyun’s outward aggression, internally, he still feared Long Chen. If he didn’t fear Long Chen, like Long Ziwei, he would have challenged Long Chen to a fight, leaving his life and death up to fate. However, he lacked the courage to do so. He only dared to fight on the martial stage for his safety.0

Long Chen’s words hit Long Qingyun where it hurt most. Long Qingyun found himself at a loss for words, and the disciples accompanying him watched him awkwardly, unsure how to react.0

Long Chen calmly said, “You know you aren’t a match for me, but someone ordered you to test out my power. You want to rely on the martial stage to preserve your life, yet you don’t realize such a thing is useless. Once I want to kill someone, let alone a tiny martial stage, even a god won’t be able to protect your life.”3

Although Long Chen spoke casually, his words resonated with undeniable confidence, leaving no room for doubt.0

“What are you talking about? The Long clan has rules! Disciples are prohibited from killing each other indiscriminately! Grudges can only be resolved on the martial stage! Do you think that senior apprentice-brother Qingyun fears you?” shouted one of the women who had previously been by Long Ziwei’s side, helping Long Qingyun out of his predicament.0

Long Ziwei sneered, “What nonsense. Why didn’t I know of such a rule? It’s not like it’s a rare thing for disciples of the Long clan to kill each other, is it?”0

“Shut up! You’re already someone else’s dog. Do you really think you can be considered a disciple of the Long clan?” she retorted.0

“You…!”0

“You can endure even that?” instigated Long Chen.1

“What else can he do but endure? He’s nothing but a loser. Next time, I’ll crush him so badly he’ll never be able to climb back up,” sneered Long Qingyun.0

“Ziwei, do you want revenge?” Long Chen rose lazily, his sinister smile barely concealed as he placed a hand on Long Ziwei’s shoulder.
