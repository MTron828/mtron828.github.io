Chapter 2587 Despicable Blood Race

The Sovereign sprout had completely transformed. Under the black clouds, he seemed like the devil king of the night.

“His aura has completely changed.” The Martial Heaven Continent’s side was shocked at the overwhelming pressure coming from him.

“Perhaps this is the true power of a Sovereign sprout. He has summoned the power of his world to suppress the Martial Heaven Continent. Now, he can unleash his full potential.”

Despite being worried for Guo Ran, when the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts looked at the Dragonblood Legion, they saw that the latter was all calm. They didn’t seem the slightest bit nervous.

“This is my true power. Little brat, how do you want to die?” said the Sovereign sprout sinisterly.

Guo Ran looked at him and shook his head. “To tell the truth, I wasn’t going to embarrass you like this. I was actually going to encourage you so you did a bit better. But I’m getting pretty pissed off that you keep trying to anger me. Let me put it to you this way, the Martial Heaven Continent has 1597 Sovereign sprouts. My boss killed one, so there’s only 1596 left. As for you, even the Zhao Ritian that my boss killed was stronger than you. I really don’t know how you get so arrogant with this level of power. Where does your confidence come from?”

The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were dumbfounded. Someone as powerful as Guo Ran actually spouted nonsense without blinking an eye. When had they gained so Sovereign sprouts?

If they didn’t understand the condition of their world well, they would have believed him. Some youngsters who had just entered the cultivation world did actually fall for it and let out cheers. Perhaps they felt that someone as powerful as Guo Ran wouldn’t lie.

“Bullshit. Any world can only have a maximum of nine Sovereign sprouts. This is an ironclad rule that has never changed throughout history. If you’re going to lie, try to use your brain,” sneered the Sovereign sprout.

There was such a thing? With his lie seen through, Guo Ran didn’t even twitch. He sneered, “What do you know? The Martial Heaven Continent has changed. Other than my boss being a peerless expert that the world has never seen before, he also managed to break the laws of the world, allowing countless other geniuses to soar. I suppose a piece of trash like you wouldn’t know about that. Tell me, do I look like a Sovereign sprout? And yet, I’m still beating the crap out of you, right?”

The Sovereign sprout became speechless. Guo Ran was no Sovereign sprout, but he possessed such terrifying power. That was truly different from their records of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.

“You’re just a coincidence. Did you think a stupid set of armor would make you unrivaled? A true expert doesn’t rely on external power.” The Sovereign sprout sneered and stepped through the void. With every step, scarlet runes rippled out of the void. It was as if the void was water he was stepping through.

“Idiot, the power that I can control is my power. There is no such thing as external and internal power,” sneered Guo Ran indifferently.

In a clash between experts, sometimes just words could decide victory. A sharp word could be the key that broke down the other side’s mentality. If two sides were evenly matched, then whoever’s mental strength was stronger would have a higher chance of winning.

All emotions, good or bad, could become negative effects in battle. If the fluctuations were too great, the openings would grow bigger.

After fighting the human race for so long, the Blood race had long since grasped this weakness of the human race. That was why they often used words to provoke them before the battle. Anger and fear were fatal weaknesses that made the human race unable to make the correct decisions, leaving them open to death.

As for this Sovereign sprout, he had used such mental warfare on Long Chen and almost been killed. Now that he used it against Guo Ran, Guo Ran was absolutely shameless. All he wanted to do was show off, so his provocations weren’t suited for use against him.

At this moment, rumbling rang out and pressure crashed down on Guo Ran. Even the Blood race’s experts felt suffocated by the pressure, so it could be imagined just how much pressure was concentrated on Guo Ran.

“This fellow is using the laws of their world to suppress Guo Ran.”

Black qi whirled around heaven and earth. This was the power of a Sovereign sprout. He had summoned the Heavenly Daos of his world to suppress his opponent.

“Your Heavenly Daos’ laws are unable to suppress me. In front of me, you’re nothing more than a slightly stronger ant. Give it your all. Or if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I’m not that picky,” said Guo Ran indifferently.

The Sovereign sprout had originally been walking step by step, but this provocation made him transform into a shooting star crashing toward Guo Ran.

He was like a furious lion, and his black spear was like the fang of a viper piercing toward Guo Ran’s chest.

“Die!”

The Sovereign sprout was fully enraged. None of his words were able to anger Guo Ran, but he himself had practically gone crazy.

The black qi filling the battlefield condensed into his spear in an instant as it stabbed toward Guo Ran.

In the face of this berserk attack, a blood-colored saber appeared in Guo Ran’s right hand. Multicolored runes lit up on it, illuminating this dark world.

At the same time, densely packed runes lit up every inch of Guo Ran’s armor. He became like a blazing sun.

After that, Guo Ran grasped his saber with both hands. The energy of his runes flowed into his weapon. “Using a Sovereign sprout’s blood as an offering to you isn’t that bad.” At this moment, Guo Ran was solemn. This saber was his masterpiece.

BOOM!

The instant that the saber and spear clashed, the entire battlefield exploded like shattered crystal.

Astral winds wreaked havoc, spreading beyond the battlefield. When they blew past the spectators, they were so strong that it felt like blades were cutting their faces. They were unable to open their eyes.

“What?!”

When the laws of space within the battlefield were restored, they were shocked to find that the Sovereign sprout was hanging in the air in complete disbelief. The arm that had been holding his spear was gone.

Moreover, a saber was piercing his chest, picking him up. His essence blood was rapidly fading, sucked away by the saber.

“Now do you believe me? The Martial Heaven Continent is different from before. The invaders will die, every single one of them,” said Guo Ran coldly.

The Martial Heaven Continent and the Yin Yang World’s side were both filled with disbelief. The Sovereign sprout had been defeated and had his life in Guo Ran’s hands.

A fire lit up in Guo Ran’s eyes. He really had succeeded.

Long Chen had used a special method to draw out all of Guo Ran’s potential. Hence, he was now able to unleash immense power with his new armor, and even a Sovereign sprout could be defeated in one move.

Although this move had used up all the stored energy in his battle armor, it did prove his power. Even someone who wasn’t talented in cultivation could reach the peak of the martial path and look down on the so-called geniuses.

Suddenly, the void quivered. Chains shot out from eight different directions, instantly binding Guo Ran. After that, eight figures appeared within the void.

“Release him!”

Those eight figures were elders of the Blood race, and their auras caused the world to shake. They were eight Heaven Merging experts.

It all happened so quickly as if they had been prepared from the start. As soon as Guo Ran obtained victory, he was instantly caught in a trap.

“Despicable Blood race, you’re shameless!” The Martial Heaven Continent’s side burst into curses. This had clearly been an aboveboard battle, but they had launched a sneak attack, one involving eight Heaven Merging experts against someone who was only in the Netherpassage realm.

Even bound in those eight chains, Guo Ran sneered, “Is this the pride of the Blood race? After beating one, a group comes? After beating the small one, the big ones come? Is this the essence of the Blood race’s Martial Dao? Hahaha, how fascinating.”

Even in the face of eight Heaven Merging experts, Guo Ran was as calm as ever. He didn’t show the slightest bit of panic, and he even mocked them.

“Release him! This battle is your victory. Once you release him, we’ll let you go!” barked one of the eight elders.

“Don’t try to escape our chains. These are made from our core essence blood, so with just a thought, you will be pulled into eight pieces. You should be grateful that we didn’t immediately kill you,” sneered another.

“Hahaha, your Blood race really is stupid. Did you think that I’d believe you?” Guo Ran laughed. At this moment, the distant Dragonblood warriors summoned their manifestations, but they didn’t charge over.

“Don’t misunderstand. Even if you kill him, you’ll also die. Why not have both sides retreat peacefully?” said one of the eight elders.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign sprout was terrified and no longer had his old arrogance. He didn’t dare to say anything for fear that Guo Ran would kill him with just a thought.

“I don’t like it when both sides retreat. Moreover, I don’t like how this one looks, so I have to kill him,” said Guo Ran.

“Don’t-!” The eight chains tightened.

However, with a quiver from Guo Ran’s saber, the Sovereign sprout was blasted into bloody mist. A generation’s Sovereign sprout was killed just like that.

“Die!”

The eight elders roared furiously, and their chains erupted with full power. As a result, startled cries rang out from the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. Some of them turned away, not willing to watch as Guo Ran was torn to pieces.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
