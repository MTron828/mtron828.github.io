Chapter 3861 The Dragon Expert’s Suggestion

Using the Purgatory Eyes, Long Chen had broken that illusory figure in Long Aotian’s manifestation. He had also broken the laws of the Heavenly Daos, and from the fragments of space, Long Chen sensed a strange fluctuation. However, it was extremely familiar.

Furthermore, when the elder of the Heavenly Eye race destroyed the heaven-encompassing cage, it also caused a change in the world. After that, that aura grew even stronger, dragging Long Chen’s attention to it.

“I also felt a summons. It must be from an inheritance left behind by the original devil race’s experts in the three thousand worlds. It has also appeared,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

“Xiaoqian, you should hurry there. Don’t let others get a headstart,” said Long Chen.

“But you…”

The current Long Chen might no longer have wounds riddling his body, but his aura was still extremely weak. She was worried about him encountering some powerful enemy on his way.

“I will be fine. I’ll recover a bit here, and then I’ll go to that place,” said Long Chen comfortingly.

“I’ve also sensed the aura of a treasure. This time, it’s definitely some big business!” chortled Mo Nian.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Why didn’t I sense anything?” demanded Guo Ran, feeling displeased.

“I didn’t sense anything either.” Xia Chen smiled bitterly.

“Hehe, it’s fine. My nose for treasures is very sharp. If us three brothers work together, what treasure can escape us?” Mo Nian winked.

“Haha, that’s right. With brother Mo Nian here, all treasures have a destiny with me!” laughed Guo Ran.

“Exactly. Let me tell you, I can smell the scent of an ancient tomb…”

As soon as Mo Nian said this, Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s expressions sank. This heavenly tomb had been incredibly dangerous. Hence, they were all somewhat traumatized by tombs now.

Seeing their expressions, Mo Nian hastily said, “Don’t worry! It’s not a heavenly tomb this time! It definitely won’t be as dangerous, I guarantee it!”

The two of them hesitated. Mo Nian had so many treasures. To say that they didn’t covet such things would be a lie.

Mo Nian had also said that he was going to give them some treasures, but how could the two of them accept that? They still had a bit of shame left and couldn’t simply take other people’s things.

However, if they worked together with Mo Nian and put in some work, naturally the treasures would have to be divided up between the three of them.

Even so, the very first time they worked together with Mo Nian, they just had to enter this heavenly tomb where they had almost died many times. Although they had made astonishing gains, after experiencing this danger, they didn’t want to go through it again.

However, the light of treasures truly had a fatal attraction. The two of them were moved.

“What about our brothers in the city? Are they supposed to go grave robbing with us?” asked Xia Chen.

Mo Nian was baffled. If he brought that many people along, it would not be convenient at all.

“Have your brothers in the Dragonblood Legion stay where they are. Once you deal with your matter, they can absorb the dragon blood with you.” Suddenly, the dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Long Chen didn’t quite understand what it was saying, but he didn’t pursue the topic. After all, he hadn’t listened when it had told him not to fight with Long Aotian. He had clearly irritated this dragon expert, so he obediently listened to it this time.

Long Chen had them deal with their own affairs for now. The Dragonblood Legion was to wait where they were and await further orders.

With this, everyone split up again. Yue Xiaoqian had to leave on her own, while Mo Nian brought along Guo Ran and Xia Chen. None of them wanted to waste any time. They all knew that the primal chaos qi coming out of the world right now was nothing more than a small eruption. When the final current appeared, it would be the day that all the heavenly geniuses of the world gathered. That would be the time for a true bloody battle.

Xia Chen left many talismans for Long Chen, especially transportation talismans. Long Chen was in a rather weak state right now, so he needed them.

With everyone leaving, it wasn’t convenient for Long Chen to stay here any longer. He then used transportation talismans, leaving as well.

“Senior, I need to go somewhere first, but I’ll immediately get your dragon scale after that,” transmitted Long Chen as he flew.

“Do you think you’re so badass that you need to report to me?” The dragon expert snorted. It was clearly displeased with Long Chen’s previous actions.

“No matter how badass I am, there’s no way that I could compare to you. Without you, who knows how many times I would have died on the Martial Heaven Continent?” Long Chen knew that he had to first fawn on the dragon expert a bit before anything else.

“Don’t bother fawning on me. You’re just a stubborn donkey. Tell me, what was the point of that fight? You’re down to one eye again, and you’ve messed up my calculations. Now there are even more variables to getting my dragon king reverse scale,” snorted the dragon expert.

“Junior was hot-headed,” said Long Chen helplessly.

“Let’s discuss this calmly. If you fought purely in terms of bloodline power, would you have beaten Long Aotian?” asked the dragon expert.

Long Chen was silent. It was true, in terms of bloodline power, he wasn’t a match for Long Aotian. Although he won in the end, in terms of bloodline, he had indeed lost.

Furthermore, at the start, he had been planning on just using the power of his physical body to beat Long Aotian. It was all to prove that even without his Supreme Blood, he could still suppress Long Aotian.

“Even if you say that you ultimately won, who cares? Even if he lay there and let you kill him, would you dare to?” demanded the dragon expert.

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” asked Long Chen in confusion.

“Why wouldn’t you dare?! Are you a pig?! If you kill him, how will you take back your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone?! Did you think ripping his corpse into a million pieces would allow you to take them back?!” cursed the dragon expert.

“Ah…” Long Chen was left silent. Back then, when he encountered Long Aotian, his head went blank. All he had been thinking about was killing him; nothing else mattered.

With this reminder, he understood. Naturally, he wished to take back all the divine abilities of his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone. “Senior, are you saying that it is possible for me to…?”

The dragon expert irritably said, “Isn’t that obvious? They were yours from the start. No matter how many changes they go through, as long as they return to the original master, they will be home. All the benefits will be yours. Your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone are only temporarily placed in him so that others can help you nourish them. The immemorial Long clan possesses enough power and resources to do so. Moreover, your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone still haven’t fully matured yet. If you take them now, even if I had a method for you to merge back with them, they will be damaged. Their quality might even drop, and that wouldn’t be worth it.”

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart pounded excitedly. He was so emotional that he almost cried. So, he still had a chance to take back his Spirit Bone, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone.

It wasn’t about how powerful they were. What was more important to him was that these were things that his father and mother had left for him. He had to take them back.

“Alright, don’t get emotional. There’s not that much time. Hurry up and go wherever you want to go,” urged the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded. After settling his emotions, he flew off.
