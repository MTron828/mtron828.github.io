Chapter 3896 Ji Wuming’s Most Powerful State

When the faith energy gushed out, a milky white light filled the world, bending the very laws of heaven and earth.

The faith energy then spread rapidly, causing a profound change wherever it touched. In an instant, countless experts gasped for air, overwhelmed by the immense power of the faith energy.

The faith energy was like water pressing down on them, turning this world into something else. They could not breathe nor absorb any energy here. It was as if they had lost the support of heaven and earth.

Hence, everyone within the range of the faith energy fled for their lives. Within this region, their life and death was in Ji Wuming’s hands. It was like a single thought from Ji Wuming would be enough to kill them in this terrifying faith domain.

“Dong Mingyu, in order to express my respect for you, I’ve decided to face you in my strongest state,” said Ji Wuming within his thirty-thousand-mile faith domain. “Although you will die, you can die honored.”

“Although you will die, you can die honored.”

“Although you will die, you can die honored.”

Ji Wuming’s voice echoed throughout heaven and earth countless times. At this moment, he seemed to be the heavenly god of this world. His words were the law, and nothing could resist him.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Watching this scene, everyone was amazed and terrified at the same time. Although the three thousand worlds also had god cultivators with faith energy, they had never even dreamed of seeing someone possessing such concentrated faith energy.

This faith energy was so concentrated that it dyed this world, taking control of this world’s laws. It was like the world had been possessed by it.

“The Bloodkill Hall’s followers are spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, and no one knows just how much faith energy they’ve accumulated over countless years. All of this faith energy is Enpuda’s. As Ji Wuming is just his disciple and cannot directly mobilize it, it must have been bestowed to him by Enpuda, meaning that this should be no more than one-hundredth, or perhaps one-thousandth of Enpuda’s faith energy. But it is already so immense. God cultivators really are enviable,” sighed one expert.

God cultivators—others couldn’t help being jealous of them. Faith energy was the result of specks of sand being concentrated into a soaring tower, and the one who stood at the peak of this tower controlled all of its power.

Ji Wuming wasn’t even the master of this tower. But just because he was Enpuda’s disciple, he could use a portion of his faith energy, and this portion was enough to make countless experts feel despair.

As the faith energy raged, outside of the domain, people could see countless fragments of the Heavenly Daos being absorbed by it. As this faith domain was constantly growing, the earth slowly collapsed, as if the weight of this domain was unbearable.

The current Ji Wuming was no longer someone other Supremes dared to even look at. Merely casting their eyes upon him induced unease in their very souls, as if they were committing a blasphemous act against a deity and would be struck by some terrifying karma.

Even Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others stood in stunned silence. Having traversed through the Nine Underworld Island with Long Chen, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen had come into contact with Liao Bencang’s faith energy domain.

However, shockingly, Ji Wuming’s faith energy was many times stronger than Liao Bencang’s. That was incomprehensible to them.

It was worth noting that both the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall boasted numerous disciples and shared a comparable history. They were expected to be relatively evenly matched. But Liao Bencang was a true hall master, while Ji Wuming was only Enpuda’s personal disciple. How could a disciple have so much more faith energy than a hall master?

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were unaware that by destroying the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, the Nine Underworld Island’s faith energy was destabilized, resulting in Liao Bencang not being able to draw out his full power.

On the other hand, Ji Wuming was Enpuda’s most favored disciple, his successor. In order to be safe, Enpuda had placed his divine radiance brand on Ji Wuming. It was due to this that Ji Wuming was capable of unleashing so much faith energy. Furthermore, the purity of his faith energy was ten times greater than Liao Bencang’s at that time. Thus, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were stunned by the difference.

“Will Mingyu be alright?” Guo Ran was worried. When he looked at Long Chen, he saw that not even the first rune was fully absorbed yet.

It wasn’t truly a case of Long Chen being too slow at absorbing it. Rather, all of them felt like time was going so slowly that it was standing still. The overwhelming nervousness in the air turned every breath into a simmering torture.

As for Mo Nian, his divine palace was simply sitting there. He also showed no signs of coming out.

Behind them, Yue Zifeng was recovering, sitting in the air with his sword resting on his knees. His eyes were closed in meditation as he rapidly recovered his energy. Just now, he had used up all his energy to block Ji Wuming.

All of them were nervous inside. If Yue Zifeng hadn’t been exhausted, with his unmatched Sword Dao, even faith energy was nothing more than a transient cloud that could be easily pierced through.

Other than Yue Zifeng, the only one who could fight Ji Wuming was his fellow assassin, Dong Mingyu. But Dong Mingyu didn’t have faith energy.

The only solace they found was in Dong Mingyu’s unwavering indifference. She appeared completely unperturbed, as if everything unfolded precisely as she had foreseen, including the formidable faith domain that enveloped them all.

“I was waiting for this. My master told me that I was not permitted to kill you within my first three moves. I had to give you enough space to show off. She said that I had to kill you in your strongest state, or I’d be punished when I got back,” said Dong Mingyu lightly.

“Hahaha!” Ji Wuming laughed furiously. Despite having subdued his rage, these audacious words were so arrogantly delivered that they carried a profound insult within them.

“Kill me in my strongest state?! Are you trying to make me laugh to death?!” sneered Ji Wuming.

“Is it laughable? If I didn’t agree to this, when you tried to attack big brother Long Chen, I could have killed you three times over. I was even hesitating over whether or not to abide by this agreement with my master. After all, the battlefield is no game. However, I still chose to listen to my master. I didn’t know why she wanted to do this, but now I do. She wanted me to accumulate experience. It’s all preparation for me to kill your master, Enpuda,” said Dong Mingyu.

“Nonsense!” raged Ji Wuming. Even he could no longer remain cool in front of all these insults, so he charged at Dong Mingyu.

His faith energy domain was like a sea crashing down on Dong Mingyu. The true clash of assassins started now.
