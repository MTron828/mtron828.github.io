Chapter 2203 The Sovereign Appears

“The Nirvana Scripture!”

Pill Valley’s experts stared in shock as a giant flame lotus appeared in the sky. Its existence set the battlefield on fire.

After that, stars began to appear on top of the flame lotus’s petals. First one, then two, then three... With every additional star, the flame lotus rumbled. Finally, at five stars on each petal, the world began to shake.

“Dragonblood Legion, assemble the Dragonblood Empyrean Formation!” shouted Xia Chen. The Dragonblood warriors hastily pulled together, dragon marks appearing on their foreheads. After that, a layer of light condensed around them, the disciples of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, and the Mo Gate.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man was pale. This attack from Long Chen had yet to come, and yet everything was already burning.

“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll help you out.”

Long Chen’s expression was malevolent. He had managed to upgrade the World Extermination Flame Lotus to five stars, but this was his current limit.

If this attack was unleashed, then all lifeforms at the center of the battlefield would be erased. Although Xia Chen had his protective formation up, Long Chen was not sure that the formation could endure.

However, if he didn’t take action, then the entire Dragonblood Legion would be exterminated. At least this way, there was some hope. He had to take the risk.

The flame lotus raged and the heavens began to collapse. The huge flame lotus fell from the sky. This was truly a world-destroying blow.

“Xia Chen, you have to be able to hold on.” Long Chen’s heart tightened.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man let out a furious howl. With the other five peak experts of the sea demon race, he summoned a giant shield that protected them. By this point, running would only be turning their backs to the danger. Then they would definitely be annihilated.

Just as the flame lotus was about to land on the ground, a giant hand caught it.

Long Chen was stunned. In that instant, he lost his connection to the flame lotus. He couldn’t sense it or control it.

This was something he had never encountered in his life. What person possessed such an ability?

At that moment, a grand pressure appeared, one that caused the world to quiver. Every expert stiffened and found that they no longer had the ability to condense their energy for battle.

“What a nice World Extermination Flame Lotus. Although it hasn’t reached its limit, it already has the might to destroy worlds. However, although destroying worlds is easy, creation is difficult. If it only brings destruction and not a new life, it cannot become a peak art.”

A soft voice rang out, a voice that resonated with the world.

Up in the sky, a white-robed man appeared. The flame lotus was now in his hand.

As the white-robed man appeared, every manifestation on the battlefield dissipated. All of a sudden, the hazy shadow over the sky vanished, and the bright sunlight illuminated the ground. The bloody and wild air was purified.

The Empyreans could no longer sense the Heavenly Daos. All the laws of the Heavenly Daos were revolving around that one man. All the Daos were prostrating themselves toward him.

“Sovereign!”

Everyone hastily kowtowed.

The arrival of a Sovereign was something that subdued all others. That was an instinctual urge from the depths of their souls. Everyone knelt, including Daoist Heavenly Feather, the old man, and Qu Jianying.

Yu Xiaoyun, Xie Wentian, Zhong Ziyang, Peng Wanli, Long Juncang, Di Long also got on their knees.

Even the Pill Fairy, Tian Xiezi, and Dong Mingyu knelt.

A Sovereign was a supreme existence. Not only did they possess the power to suppress all others throughout the ages, but they had also protected the Martial Heaven Continent. Anyone living on the Martial Heaven Continent felt endless gratitude and reverence for the Sovereigns. Only they were truly unrivaled.

“Mo Li!”

The Blood Emperor stared in shock. Even his gaze was filled with respect.

This white-robed man was precisely Sovereign Mo Li. He had actually appeared at such a time.

Sovereign Mo Li looked at the Blood Emperor and shook his head. “Dust to dust, earth to earth. Go in peace. Don’t use up more of your family’s karmic luck. Leave yourself a burning flame.”

Sovereign Mo Li waved a hand. As a result, everyone felt the space compress, and then the Stone Emperor and the Blood Emperor exploded, transforming into runes that merged back into heaven and earth.

“He killed the Emperor’s heroic spirits with a wave of his hand.” Long Chen’s heart shook. Just how strong were the Sovereigns? Wasn’t it said that Emperors were capable of challenging the Sovereigns? Then why was it that their heroic spirits didn’t possess the slightest ability to resist?

Currently, everyone was kneeling on the ground. The Xuan Beasts were lying down with their heads touching the ground, and even the brainless Magical Beasts of Meng Qi were obedient now, not daring to move.

Only Long Chen was still standing in the air, looking at Sovereign Mo Li. Sovereign Mo Li was also looking at Long Chen.

Sovereign Mo Li’s hand quivered ever so slightly, and the World Extermination Flame Lotus dissipated, its energy returning to the world.

“Little brother, I bet you didn’t expect to see me again, right?” Sovereign Mo Li smiled at Long Chen.

Hearing the Sovereign call Long Chen ‘little brother’, and ‘again’, everyone was dumbfounded. They knew each other?

Just seeing a Sovereign made them incomparably emotional. Sovereigns were legendary existences. But this Sovereign Mo Li not only spoke to Long Chen but also called him brother, and he even said that they had met before? Just what kind of situation was that?

“Boss really is the boss. He didn’t even tell us about such an amazing thing! I could have bragged about this for a lifetime.” Amongst the crowd, Guo Ran felt enough admiration for Long Chen as to prostrate himself toward him.

Yu Xiaoyun and the others’ expressions changed upon hearing the Sovereign speak to Long Chen like this. They had a bad feeling.

Someone who could receive such a close appellation from a Sovereign could not possibly be a traitor of the Martial Heaven Continent. Just this one call of brother was enough to shatter their rumors.

“I really didn’t expect you to appear. I even thought that some supreme expert had come to beat me up. I almost pissed myself.” Long Chen bitterly smiled. He truly had been frightened just now. If a Sovereign wished to target him, then not even ten thousand lives would be enough.

There was a supreme existence in this world called Sovereign. No one could resist the Sovereigns.

Beitang Rushuang stealthily glanced at Long Chen and sighed. This fellow really was a monster. Even when talking to a Sovereign, he spoke so sloppily.

“Your guts are quite big. You didn’t explain yourself so you could kill everyone against you? Don’t you think that’s a bit too vicious?” asked Sovereign Mo Li.

Qu Jianying and the others’ expressions changed. Was Sovereign Mo Li dissatisfied with Long Chen?

Long Chen indifferently said, “I had no other choice but to be vicious if I wanted to live. I don’t have the prestige of the Sovereigns to make people unable to doubt me. I also don’t have the grand aspirations of the Sovereigns. I’m not capable of thinking for the entire continent while disregarding myself. I’m just an ordinary person who wants to live for the people I love. If others want to harm my people, then even if I have to destroy this world, even if I have to suffer eternal damnation in hell, I won’t mind. They’re the ones who want me dead, so why can’t I be vicious? Why are their lives more valuable than mine? All I want is to live in peace with the people I love, but some people refuse to let me be, so I have no other choice. When reason doesn’t work, I’m forced to kill, because... I want to live.”

Long Chen looked at the Sovereign, his voice a bit louder than he wanted it to be because he was still full of hatred and killing intent. Those feelings didn’t vanish just because of the appearance of a Sovereign.

Sovereign Mo Li smiled. “I’m not criticizing you. I’m also not criticizing anyone else. I only took action today because this was my mission, to avoid the slaughter of the Martial Heaven Continent’s core forces one time. Now that my mission is complete, I am finally free after being dead for so many years.”

“Big brother Mo Li...” Long Chen’s heart shook. Sovereign Mo Li truly no longer existed. For some reason, pain wracked his heart. So even Sovereigns would die.

Long Chen knew that Sovereign Mo Li saying that he was free meant that his spiritual seal would soon vanish. Then there would no longer be a Sovereign Mo Li.

Sovereign Mo Li’s smile widened. He patted Long Chen on the shoulder. “I’m very happy to be called big brother by you. It means you acknowledge me in your heart.”

“How could I not acknowledge you? You are a supreme existence. I’m not fit to call you brother.” Long Chen shook his head. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

That was the truth. He was full of respect for the Sovereigns, but the pride within him refused to let him call a Sovereign brother and use that as a trump card to intimidate others. That was why he had never called Mo Li brother before.

However, today, he knew that if he didn’t say it, he would never have another chance in this lifetime.

“Actually, with your status, I’m the one not fit to be called brother by you. You’ll understand in the future. Long Chen, I’m sorry, but the karma for my action today will be counted against you due to you calling me brother. I hope you won’t curse me in the future.” This time, Sovereign Mo Li didn’t speak out loud, instead talking only to him spiritually.

“What?” Long Chen’s expression changed. He suddenly felt that he had been schemed against.
