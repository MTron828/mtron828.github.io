Chapter 4535 Fantasy Spirit World? Void Spirit World?

“Why?”

When Long Chen’s mind retreated from the primal chaos space, he saw Feng You and the others staring at the sky.

Only then did he realize that at some point, slow-moving clouds had covered the sky, and they all headed in one direction.

“The Fantasy Spirit World and the Void Spirit World are about to open. Didn’t all of you enter the world of the ninth heaven for this?” Feng You looked at Long Chen curiously.

“The Fantasy Spirit World? The Void Spirit World? What are they?” Long Chen was baffled. He had no idea what she was talking about.

“You came from the outside world. Did your people not tell you anything?” Feng You stared at him in disbelief.

“They really didn’t.” Long Chen shrugged helplessly.

“Alright, let’s talk on the way.”

Feng You bade her farewell to the leader of the mixed beast race. Their language was extremely odd, and Long Chen didn’t understand it.

However, from the race leader’s solemn expression, he seemed to be imploring Feng You about something. He also pointed at Long Chen, as if telling her to learn from him. Hearing it, Feng You didn't seem too happy about it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After he finished talking to Feng You, he called Long Chen to his side. “Friend from the human race, our relationship with the human race is actually extremely bad. However, we know that you are a good person. That is why we are willing to call you our friend. Usually, outsiders and native experts will enter different worlds, but the direction is the same. It will also be beneficial for you to come with us until you arrive. Your power is average, but you are very intelligent. On the other hand, our mixed best race is strong but lacks brains. It just so happens that we can support each other on the way...”

At this point, the race leader intentionally lowered his voice. “This child Feng You is very stubborn. I’m worried about her. When the time comes, I hope you can help remind her of my words.”

Long Chen smiled. It seemed that these words had made Feng You unhappy. After all, she was the leader of their junior generation. To have her listen to an outsider’s words, she naturally felt unhappy.

No wonder this elder said that his head wasn’t very sharp. For him to say such a thing so bluntly, he was definitely lacking intelligence. There were plenty of better ways to get the same point across.

“Senior, what are you talking about? Feng You is the youngest queen of the mixed beast race. She is both powerful and intelligent. I’m the one who is hoping to learn something from her. After all, I was only able to help the mixed beast race twice due to luck and some shameless methods. If I were to rely on real power, I would be a far cry from Feng You. Hopefully, this beauty can protect me on this journey. Don’t worry, I promise to listen to her on the way,” exclaimed Long Chen, intentionally speaking loud enough for Feng You to hear.

As expected, Feng You’s displeased expression transformed into a smile after she heard that. The elder didn’t quite understand at first, but with Long Chen repeatedly winking at him, he finally got it. He just smiled and nodded.

Feng You was in a good mood upon hearing Long Chen’s praise. She then walked over and grabbed Long Chen’s hand, waving goodbye to the race leader.

In truth, Feng You’s heart was very simple, but she had her own pride. Long Chen had overshadowed her twice, and while she was deeply grateful to him, her stubborn nature persisted.

Long Chen’s appearance made her feel threatened, especially when the junior disciples of the mixed beast race praised him. She felt a bit lost when that happened, and that was why she felt displeased when the race leader instructed her to listen to Long Chen on the way.

But just who was Long Chen? How could he not see through her emotions? In just a few words, he had won over the simple Feng You, and now, she treated him as her best comrade.

“Uh, can you let go of my hand? I’m not used to walking around like this,” said Long Chen awkwardly.

Although Feng You could be considered a big beauty, she was a bit too big for him—exactly a full head taller than him. He felt unnatural having her hold his hand and lead the way.

As Feng You was in an excellent mood, she didn’t mind and just let go while still smiling happily. It seemed that Long Chen’s words left her in a really good mood.

Feng You then led the mixed beast race’s elites, which numbered only a few hundred thousand people now. However, they were all experts amongst experts, as even ordinary Doyens were deemed unqualified to participate.

“Feng You, are you not worried about the Heavenly Corrupt Sect or the desolate beast race launching a sneak attack while we’re gone?” asked Long Chen to get rid of any remaining awkwardness.

Just by hearing him say “we”, Feng You smiled. The power of that one word was just that potent, letting her feel much closer to Long Chen.

Feng You replied, “There’s nothing to worry about. The Heavenly Corrupt Sect and the desolate beast race have suffered great losses this time. But even without that, we wouldn’t be afraid of them. We have our own trump cards to protect ourselves. Although it’s not as strong as the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s trump card, if we really can’t beat them, we can always flee. Throughout history, our mixed beast race has undergone countless battles and has migrated constantly. If we didn’t have the power to protect ourselves, we would have long since been wiped out. We are simply defending this land because there aren’t that many places for us to live in this world. If we find a suitable location, we have to defend it.”

However, when she recounted the countless battles they had fought, sadness briefly flickered in her eyes. There was an undercurrent of sorrow and helplessness. After all, the mixed beast race could only survive in the cracks between other people’s existences. It was truly difficult.

Long Chen asked about their origins and found that they truly were an extremely special existence. The earliest members of their race were marginalized humans and demonic beasts who mated with each other.

Both the humans and the demonic beasts had carried out atrocities like wiping out their respective branches to the last. It was only when they had no other choice that they ultimately formed agreements and started to merge.

It could be said that the mixed beast race was a breed essentially compelled into existence by the looming threat of extinction. As they first appeared, more humans and demonic beasts started to form agreements.

Some demonic beasts with noble bloodlines could take human form and would even choose to mate with humans, giving rise to more hybrids. Feng You was precisely such an existence, possessing both the phoenix bloodline and the human race’s bloodline.

Within the mixed beast race, these bloodlines neither enjoyed favor nor faced disdain. After all, they always struggled on the brink of death, a reality that had persisted for countless years.

Both the human and the demonic beast race viewed them as an inferior species, while the other races also viewed them as mutants, resulting in not many races willing to conduct business with them.

The mixed beast race also held onto their own pride. They refused to accept charity from others, relying entirely on their own bravery and stubbornness to carve out an existence in this harsh world.

As of today, the mixed beast race might not be considered an overwhelmingly powerful force, but within the realm of the ninth heaven, an average existence would not be willing to provoke them. They were known for settling their scores, ensuring that they always repaid their grievances.

“Hahaha, is this the noble mixed beast race? What a coincidence!” At this time, a sinister voice rang out. A group of people then emerged and blocked their path.
