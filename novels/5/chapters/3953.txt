Chapter 3942 Philosopher?

Long Chen sent that person flying through the air. Fortunately, the current him had enough control over his power. Otherwise, this slap would have blown that person apart.

Even so, this slap still caused a lot of people to gasp. Dozens of experts were opening a path, making a ruckus, so everyone’s attention was drawn to this scene.

“Courting death!”

Those dozens of experts furiously surrounded Long Chen, seeming like they were going to beat him up.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, a golden-robed man with a crown on his head appeared, looking to be in his late twenties. His countenance was graced with neatly trimmed facial hair, and his piercing eyes emitted a captivating electric gleam, as if possessing the ability to peer into the depths of one's soul. He appeared unquestionably dignified.

When this man showed up, those experts around Long Chen immediately stood at attention, moving to the side.

At this moment, Long Chen could see a group of experts in silver robes standing beside this man. There were men and women among them, and all of them had powerful auras surpassing most Supremes. They were definitely true experts.

When they looked at Long Chen, they couldn’t help but show a trace of shock on their faces, seeming to be able to sense Long Chen’s powerful Blood Qi fluctuations.

Long Chen had been refining the ancestral dragon essence blood for quite some time now, so its power was mostly under his control. Yet, despite his progress, he had not reached absolute control over every trace of it. Thus, some of its aura still leaked out.

Perhaps ordinary experts were unable to sense that trace, but these Supreme heavenly geniuses instantly sensed it. Seeing a new face here, they were all startled.

At this moment, that dignified man walked over to Long Chen. His aura was fully reserved, without a trace of it leaking, a sign that his power had been condensed to the pinnacle. Upon sensing this, Long Chen’s heart shook. This person possessed extraordinary power, exuding a pressure that rivaled that of Long Aotian or Kun Tu.

Long Chen hadn’t expected to encounter such an expert as soon as he reached the capital. So, Long Chen carefully examined him, feeling that this expert’s true age was around forty to fifty years old. His cultivation base was so solid that it was most likely the result of constantly suppressing it.

Despite also being in the Immortal King realm, his aura had reached the realm of going from solid to empty. Without the sharp senses from the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, Long Chen might have misjudged his power.

The dignified man also looked at Long Chen with a trace of astonishment. He coldly said, “Is this your first time in the Vermilion Bird Empire?”

Long Chen frowned. Although this man’s words couldn’t count as rude, he gave off such a haughty feeling that this simple question sounded like an interrogation.

“Is there a problem?” demanded Long Chen.

“Brazen!” One of the Supreme experts beside the dignified man shouted, “Blind fellow, do you know who this person is?!”

“As long as he isn’t the current emperor of the Vermilion Bird Empire, he isn’t qualified to act big in front of me. Other than that, my temper isn’t good, so don’t provoke me,” responded Long Chen coldly.

“Shameful! You dare to mention the emperor-”

Pow!

Long Chen directly slapped this person in the midst of his response, causing him to let out a grunt as half of his face was turned to pulp.

The moment Long Chen attacked, the dignified man also reached out to grab Long Chen’s wrist. However, he didn’t get to grasp anything. Long Chen had swiftly slapped that man and pulled his hand back.

Now, the dignified man’s expression sank. Long Chen had actually slapped his subordinate right in front of him, and he hadn’t been able to stop him. That was a huge provocation to him.

“Report your name!” he shouted furiously. It was quite clear that after Long Chen said his name, this man would immediately challenge Long Chen to a fight.

The surrounding people instantly tensed, staring in shock at Long Chen. They didn’t know where this black-robed man got the guts to dare to cause trouble here.

Long Chen shook his head. Just what was going on? He was only looking for one person, but he hadn’t even entered the city and some trouble already found him.

Long Chen was about to say his name when the sound of stone wheels rolling across the ground drew everyone’s attention. After that, a donkey pulling a worn-out carriage slowly came over.

The one driving the carriage was a boy in his early teens. What was curious though was that this boy didn’t even look at the surrounding people. He just directly had the donkey drive right through.

When the crowd saw that carriage, they actually parted before it, not daring to stop it.

As for the young boy, he didn’t cultivate at all. He was just an ordinary person.

Upon seeing this carriage, the dignified man’s expression grew slightly ugly. After a moment of hesitation, he also moved out of the way.

As a result, that donkey pulled the carriage right past that dignified man and Long Chen.

“Martial artists really are competitive. They’ll fight for fame and profit without even knowing why they’re fighting. Even as blood dyes the land, as your bones fill the wilderness, you still fight delightedly without getting tired. Such a thing is the pinnacle of foolishness, the peak of idiocy!”

When the carriage passed by the two of them, a contemptuous old voice rang out from it, as if the speaker had absolute disdain for all the cultivators here.

That old voice was lacking any power, a sign that he was just an ordinary person. Yet, he dared to criticize all the experts here.

To Long Chen’s surprise, the dignified man didn’t reply to this criticism. However, although he didn’t say anything, his expression was dark with fury.

“A toad at the bottom of a well cannot speak of the ocean. A summer bug cannot speak of winter.” On the other hand, Long Chen directly retorted.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

His reply caused countless experts to gasp. Within their shock was also a touch of admiration.

It had to be known that the elder inside the carriage had a shocking status, and not a single person here dared to argue with him.

All of a sudden, the boy pulled on the reins, causing the donkey to stop in the street. He then glared at Long Chen furiously.

“Foolish brute! A vulgar person who only knows how to use brute force to solve problems dares to argue with a philosopher?”

A philosopher? What kind of trash is that?

Long Chen had never heard of this title before. But seeing a young boy dare to look down on him, he was immediately pissed.

He disdainfully said, “Foolish brute? The road is for all people. Just because a dumb beast comes over, why do others have to open the way for it?”

The dumb beast was naturally the donkey, but there was also an implicit curse toward the schoolboy and the elder in the carriage.

“You…!”

“What you? Don’t you know manners? If you do, why would you stop your carriage in the middle of the road and block the pedestrians? Now, you even have the nerve to criticize others? That’s like someone covered in fur saying others look like monkeys. Can you have some shame?”

“How brazen! You dare to be rude to a philosopher?! Capture him!”
