Chapter 2780 Reinforcements

Hearing that they came from the Immemorial Path, the Dragonblood warriors cheered. They hadn’t expected the indigenous people of the Immemorial Path to come reinforce them.

When they had met, Xiao Fei had been a rather cowardly teen. But he had grown up now, becoming a true man. However, what was truly shocking was their auras.

Back then, Xiao Fei could only reach the level of a rank three Celestial thanks to Long Chen’s help. However, his aura was now vast and majestic. He was actually an Emperor, and this was not something he had recently achieved. He had to have stabilized his realm in the Emperor realm a while ago because his aura was as heavy as a star.

Furthermore, thousands of experts behind Xiao Fei were also Emperors, and there were millions of Saints.

Such a powerful lineup was enough to shake the experts of the other worlds.

At this moment, Xiao Fei waved his hand, and a giant skull appeared, smashing into the armies of the other side.

That skull possessed a terrifying aura. It was the same skull that Long Chen had seen at the bottom of the Immemorial Path with the Eastern Wasteland. Now it had been taken out by Xiao Fei.

“I will return this to you!” shouted Xiao Fei.

BOOM!

The giant skull exploded, unleashing a wave of terrifying power that devoured everything within a giant radius. All the experts caught within it were turned to nothingness.

Xiao Fei’s arrival stunned everyone. The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were ecstatic to receive reinforcements, especially from people they had considered enemies.

The Immemorial Path had gone through a complete transformation after Long Chen left. It was originally a training ground that almighty experts in the past had linked to the wall of the immortal world, allowing a trace of the immortal world’s energy to leak inside of it. This resulted in its special world laws that made it the best place for experts to grow.

However, after the war, it was turned into a land of ruin. Let alone the aura of the immortal world, even the aura of the Martial Heaven Continent was almost unable to reach it. Hence, their resources became sparse.

During Long Chen’s tribulation, he had ripped open the wall of the heavens, completely transforming the Immemorial Path. By tearing open that wall, Long Chen had inadvertently bumped into the wall of the immortal world, causing its energy to enter the Immemorial Path once more. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As a result, experts began to arise within the Immemorial Path like bamboo after a spring rainfall. Their growth was even faster than the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.

Xiao Fei was the first to become an Emperor. He then managed to link together the four fragments of the Immemorial Path and became the leader of the entire world. They eventually charged underground, where after a brutal, bloody battle, they shattered the barrier there and took the skull that was like a malignant tumor in their world.

After resolving this problem, Xiao Fei began to think of ways to link up with the Martial Heaven Continent. According to Lord Heaveneye, a tribulation was about to befall the Martial Heaven Continent.

In order to repay Long Chen for his favor, Xiao Fei had spent a great deal of effort trying to form a channel, but he was unable to pierce the spatial wall.

At that time, Lord Heaveneye activated his eyes and ultimately told Xiao Fei that he needed to wait for the right time. After saying that, he reached the end of his lifespan and passed away.

Xiao Fei had been waiting for half a year. Finally, the spatial wall weakened, and that was due to the four other worlds forming their own channels.

The spatial wall then weakened more and more until it reached a critical point, and their channel instantly pierced through. After that, Xiao Fei charged through with the experts of the Immemorial Path.

“Big brother Long Chen, today, I, Xiao Fei, will protect you.”

Xiao Fei and his millions of experts charged onto the battlefield. With their addition, the pressure on the Martial Heaven Continent’s side was greatly reduced.

At this moment, the other two spatial gates also opened. Actually, two giant trees propped them open, and spiritual qi gushed into the continent.

“It’s the Spirit World’s Life God Tree and the Star Field Divine World’s Ling Xi!” exclaimed Chu Yao.

When the Spirit World’s warriors charged into the continent through the gate, their arrows also rained down on the battlefield.

Also, from Ling Xi’s side, countless Spirit race warriors flew out, attacking the other direction.

Both sides looked to be from the same race, but they were actually from different branches. The Spirit World’s warriors were all women, while the Spirit race on Ling Xi’s side had men as well as women.

Back then, the Spirit World’s Life God Tree had received the nourishment of Long Chen’s primal chaos soil, which caused it to thrum with life. Its warriors then grew stronger day by day along with it.

Luckily, both the Spirit World and the Star Field Divine World remembered the aid that Long Chen had provided them. Hence, when the world’s spatial walls weakened, they opened a gate and came to help him.

Arrows rained down. Although the wounds caused by these arrows were not lethal, the arrows would embed themselves in flesh and sprout, sucking away the target’s lifeforce. After that, those struck quickly became masses of wood, unable to fight.

All of the Immemorial Path, the Spirit World, and the Star Field Divine World’s experts had come to reinforce Long Chen and the others, and this fact reinvigorated the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. At the same time, they felt even greater admiration for Long Chen. These people had only come because of him.

The mother tree and the Life God Tree were in their true forms. At this moment, two giant trees covered practically the entire Martial Heaven Continent with their crowns.

An emerald mark then appeared on each of the Martial Heaven Continent’s expert’s foreheads and instantly healed their wounds whenever they were injured. As long as they weren’t killed in one blow, they could be said to possess undying bodies.

Since the Dragonblood warriors already had the protection of the healing warriors, with the addition of this blessing, they became even more unrestrained.

“Azure Dragon Slaughter Formation!” shouted Xia Chen.

Right away, the Dragonblood warriors moved into the shape of a long dragon, with Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the four captains as the head of the dragon. This grand formation then charged through the battlefield.

The Dragonblood Legion was like a sharp blade weaving through the battlefield. At this moment, the very world was already dyed red from the killing, and the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring had become a sea of blood. This was a battle to seize these heavens.

“Vile beings!”

The Nine-Headed Lion cursed furiously. He was blocked by Wilde, Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, and the others, while also had to be on guard against the Spirit race’s arrows. He was gradually forced away from Yun Tian’s barrier.

“We can’t stall any longer! Have the gods descend!” shouted the Nine-Headed Lion. He quickly retreated.

At the same time, Ye Ming, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord pulled back. They retreated all the way to their respective spatial gates before they formed hand seals.

“With my blood as the guide, my soul as the bridge, I ask the heavenly god to possess my body!”

The four of them shouted in unison, and blood soul energy burst forth. After that, the spatial gates shuddered and translucent figures walked out of the spatial gates.
