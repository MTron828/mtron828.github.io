Chapter 3363 Switching Sides Just Before Battle

Two people were fighting in that battle between supreme experts. One was a large man in red armor. He wore a sinisterly blood-colored helmet.

The other was a peerlessly beautiful woman in a black dress. She was so beautiful that she didn’t have a single flaw. Even every hair of her eyebrows was perfectly symmetrical.

Wielding her bone sword, she was noble yet cold, beautiful yet dangerous. Her eyes were like sapphires, containing a deep light that could draw people’s souls inside.

“Leng Yueyan!” Long Chen was shocked to see the figure that had appeared in his dreams countless times.

Leng Yueyan was definitely the most special of Long Chen’s women. He loved her but was also a bit afraid of her. It was like her love had poison in it, poison that could not be extracted.

“Leng Yueyan, your city is going to fall soon. Even if I have to use my soldiers' lives to slowly climb on top, I will still crush you. Once your city is broken, let’s see how you will protect Ming Cangyue. The two of you are one. Now that she is making her breakthrough to Nether King, your power is unstable. You are definitely dead today,” said the armored man while laughing.

His red armor was covered in teeth and scales. His helmet covered his face, and his voice was rough and unpleasant to listen to.

“If you want my life, it’ll be up to your ability,” snorted Leng Yueyan. She was still as icily aloof as before. Even in front of death, she didn’t feel the slightest fear.

Long Chen was shocked. At this moment, he sensed that Leng Yueyan was already an Immortal King. However, in the Netherworld, they weren’t called Immortal Kings but Nether Kings.

At the same time, he realized that this Tuo Ming was quite sinister. He actually chose to launch his attack while Ming Cangyue was trying to break through.

Furthermore, it seemed that he was aware that Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were once one. So when Ming Cangyue made her breakthrough, she had to borrow Leng Yueyan’s power.

As for Leng Yueyan, her aura seemed like she had just broken through to the Immortal King realm. Her realm was unstable. Furthermore, a majority of her power was being used by Ming Cangyue. Tuo Ming truly chose the right time to attack.

The battle had already progressed to this point. Clearly, Ming Cangyue could not stop now. She either succeeded or failed.

If she failed, she would die along with Leng Yueyan. Thus, the current Leng Yueyan only had one option, and that was to risk her life.

Leng Yueyan was as beautiful as ever. But her crystalline mouth now had a trace of redness. That was her blood. Her stubbornness was aggrieving.

“Let’s see just how long you can last. Once the formation is broken, you’re definitely dead.” Tuo Ming snorted and smashed his meteor hammer toward her. To face it, Leng Yueyan’s bone sword swung out. The two began to fight again and space twisted once more. Their immense power tore apart space, making it impossible for the others to see their figures. It was only possible to see the sky constantly collapsing as if the end of the world had come.

“That Tuo Ming should be a Heaven tier Immortal King, but Leng Yueyan has just broken through. She’s naturally at a disadvantage. Her aura is already starting to drop, while Tuo Ming is still at full power. She can’t last much longer.” Long Chen was worried. Their battle wasn’t something that he could interfere with at his current cultivation base. He would only cause trouble for her.

The most worrying thing was that Tuo Ming had far too many people. They outnumbered Leng Yueyan’s side by over ten times. The formation would probably be broken even before Leng Yueyan was defeated.

Leng Yueyan was so suppressed. The reason that she was still able to fight back was definitely connected to this city. If the city was broken into, everything would be over.

“What are you standing around like this for?! Hurry up and attack!” Just then, a furious roar rang out. An Earth tier Immortal King shouted at Long Chen and his troop.

The Immortal King that Long Chen had intimidated was actually this Immortal King’s subordinate. Long Chen now had a group of experts just blindly following his orders.

However, Long Chen was stunned by Leng Yueyan and stopped moving. As they didn’t dare to make any rash movements, they also stopped.

“This… this senior ordered us to listen to his directions,” said the Immortal King who had been struck by Long Chen. He immediately cleared himself of wrongdoing and blamed Long Chen.

That Earth tier Immortal King was enraged. Seeing that Long Chen was only a Four Peak brat, he felt that his subordinate had gone stupid. He called this brat senior?

The Earth tier Immortal King shouted, “Brat, you-”

Just as he shouted again, Long Chen slapped him in the face. This Earth tier Immortal King was a general and so he didn’t enter the battle personally. As a result, since he wasn’t in his combat-ready state, he was sent flying, hacking up blood and teeth.

This one slap stunned everyone on the battlefield, especially Tuo Ming’s people. They stared in shock at Long Chen, and the pace of the battle slowed down.

Those experts in red armor were dumbfounded. Before they could recover from their shock, Long Chen pointed at the Earth tier Immortal King and cursed, “Useless thing, you haven’t managed to break into the city after all this time! Do we need trash like you? Just kill yourself. Stop embarrassing yourself here. If master relied on trash like you to achieve anything, it would be too late for anything. All of you, scram. I’m going to show you what true power is, you trash. I’ll show you what the expression blasting through rotting wood is.”

Long Chen flew into the air. After that, a flame lotus appeared in his hand, and a sacred chanting filled the air. As the scripture rang out, the wind and clouds changed color. The world was dyed red.

Countless flame runes filled this place and surged toward Long Chen’s flame lotus.

As for the Earth tier Immortal King, just as he was preparing to kill Long Chen, he was stunned by this scene.

“When did master raise such a terrifying expert?” That Earth tier Immortal King felt chills when he sensed that terrifying pressure. Other than Tuo Ming himself, he had never seen anyone capable of unleashing such power.

The flames rose. The flame lotus filled the world with its light, growing bigger and bigger…

The bigger it grew, the greater its power. Tuo Ming’s subordinates hastily retreated when they saw this.

Even the Earth tier Immortal King was terrified by that huge flame lotus. The power contained within this one move was astonishing.

When the flame lotus reached a certain size, black threads appeared. Those weren’t actually threads but fine spatial cracks. Even space was unable to endure this power.

“Good. The Nirvana Scripture still works in the Netherworld.”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Long Chen smiled sinisterly. He suddenly turned toward the red-armored army that was staring in shock and anticipation.
