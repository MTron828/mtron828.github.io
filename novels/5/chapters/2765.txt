Chapter 2754 The Secret Behind a Sovereign’s Power

BOOM!

The Corrupt Heaven Sword slashed onto Evilmoon. This was a heaven-shaking collision, and divine light exploded out of both of these evil weapons.

Meng Qi and the others had long since retreated far away, and yet the resulting qi waves were still suffocating. The evil qi of both weapons in particular caused stabbing pain in their souls.

It was as if countless resentful spirits were wailing. This sword and saber had devoured the lives of far too many lifeforms, and their resentment had infected both of them.

At this moment, the Sovereign might raged throughout heaven and earth. This was the might that exceeded the ten thousand Daos of the world, the might that suppressed all the laws of the world.

Hence, the Dragonblood warriors’ hearts shuddered. Ye Ming was a true Sovereign, so even the laws that he controlled had gone through a qualitative change. It was no wonder there was a saying that Sovereigns stood at the peak of the martial path.

A Sovereign simply stood on another level. It was a level others couldn’t touch.

Qi waves then blew through the air, unleashing sharp astral winds that tore at the void like millions of sharp blades.

“Boss is fine!” Guo Ran cried out excitedly. The twisting space made it difficult for them to see what was going on inside. Using spiritual perception was an even worse idea. However, Guo Ran’s armor allowed him to see through the twisting space.

At this moment, stars revolved around Long Chen’s back, and black qi gushed out of Evilmoon, blocking Ye Ming’s attack. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Everyone from the Martial Heaven Continent was heartened to see that Long Chen was capable of blocking a Sovereign’s attack.

As the two divine items clashed, cracking sounds rang out, and it was transmitted throughout the entire world.

“A Sovereign’s power? It’s only on this level.”

Long Chen had 108,000 stars giving him an unending source of energy. Evilmoon received that energy and was finally capable of unleashing its full power.

“I really didn’t expect you to have such power.” Ye Ming looked at Long Chen coldly. He had launched this attack as soon as he became a Sovereign, thinking that he could crush the Martial Heaven Continent instantly.

However, unexpectedly, Long Chen had gained a completely different kind of power. His Sovereign power, which was capable of suppressing all other Daos, was unable to suppress Long Chen’s power.

“A Sovereign’s power has transcended the restrictions of the laws of the mortal world, reaching another level. This kind of power should be considered on the same level as an immortal or god. It comes from this world yet exceeds this world’s power. Only now do I realize that I long since had this kind of power but never knew about it.” Long Chen smiled faintly.

Perhaps he really should thank the Heaven Executioner. If the Heaven Executioner hadn’t crushed one of his stars, his star diagram would still be static, and he wouldn’t possess this kind of astral power.

Before his star diagram awakened, his astral power was limited by the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent. Now, there was nothing capable of restricting his astral power.

Long Chen sighed inside. If he had comprehended this principle half a year ago and abandoned one of his stars back then, he would have immediately gained this astral power and destroyed all his enemies.

“What nonsense. A Sovereign’s power is the result of an entire world’s laws circulating to the peak within them. It then transcends that peak. This requires using up the karmic luck that an entire world has accumulated for tens of thousands of years. You had this kind of power a long time ago? Do you think others are idiots to believe that? You think this strange new power of yours is enough to contend against me? You really are too naive!”

Ye Ming’s Sovereign crown suddenly unleashed divine light onto him. After that, he pushed his sword forward and the void exploded.

Long Chen was forced back several steps, every step causing the void to explode. With a final push, Ye Ming knocked him back into the distance. “Today, I’ll show you what absolute power is.”

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and sneered, “You’re angry. Your anger stems from the unease in your heart. Although I don’t know how you became a Sovereign, I know it was a trick. That’s the only way you could have become a Sovereign before everyone else, and that’s the only way for you to strike in advance and grab all the benefits first. But the path of cultivation has no shortcuts. Anyone who takes a shortcut will pay a painful price.”

“Shut up!” Ye Ming roared furiously. Just as Long Chen said, he had taken a shortcut. He had sacrificed the entire Corrupt path and its millions and millions of lives, gathering the karmic luck of two worlds in order to break through to the Sovereign realm as quickly as possible.

It was fast, but his Sovereign power had some flaws. This was the price he had paid, but he was willing to do so.

That was because if he waited until everyone else also became a Sovereign, the odds of the star-field’s core landing in his hands would be extremely low. When it came to its foundation, the Resentful Death City was the weakest of the various worlds.

In his eyes, the Martial Heaven Continent was a plump piece of meat that no one could resist. His only concern was to feast on it before the divine families, the Blood race, the demonic beast race, and the others.

BOOM! Ye Ming slashed his sword at Long Chen who swung Evilmoon. This time, both of them were blown back. Long Chen smashed into the ground, leaving a giant hole. As for Ye Ming, the space behind him exploded, and he was almost sucked into a spatial crack.

The earth shuddered and Long Chen shot out like a bolt of lightning. This time, he was the one attacking.

Ye Ming was startled. Long Chen wasn’t injured in the slightest from their previous exchange. Hence, he raised his sword again.

BOOM!

Both of them were blown back once more, but Ye Ming’s expression changed. He was almost sucked into the chaotic flow of space. The laws inside there were completely different from this world. Hence, even if his cultivation base was at Heaven Merging, he would still be ground to dust. Long Chen was trying to force him inside.

“Heaven Earth Net!” Ye Ming formed hand seals, causing a giant net to appear behind him and latch onto the world. He then smashed into a spatial crack but wasn’t sucked inside. The net pulled him out. Borrowing that rebound force, he shot toward Long Chen, his sword piercing for Long Chen’s chest.

Holding Evilmoon at a slant, Long Chen caused Ye Ming’s sword to slide off. At the same time, his left hand slapped Ye Ming’s face.

The right half of Ye Ming’s face exploded, and it was possible to see bone through the mangled mess. He flew back with a grunt.

“Even a Sovereign can still be slapped in the face just like before?” Guo Ran, Mo Nian, and the others’ jaws dropped.
