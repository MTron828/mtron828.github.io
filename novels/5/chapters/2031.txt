“Long Chen, stop!”

Those experts atop the divine pillars roared at Long Chen. Their practically cheating method of absorbing the Grand Dao energy was being disrupted.

Long Chen ignored them, cutting down the divine pillars one by one. Every time a pillar fell, a whirlpool would cease, and the Grand Dao energy in the air would grow denser.

The experts rushing over were so excited that they shouted. This mad bout of Long Chen’s was benefiting them.

“Long Chen, I’ll go all-out against you!” One of the Xuan Beasts suddenly roared, transforming into an azure roc that attacked Long Chen. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Scram!”

Long Chen shouted, slashing Evilmoon. The Xuan Beast’s sharp claws were severed, and he tumbled back, screaming.

“Long Chen, don’t go too far! We already paid the price for safety. Why would you attack us? You’re going against your own word,” shouted Di Feng.

“You want to play word games with me? What does cutting down Pill Valley’s pillars have to do with you? Do they belong to you? Why don’t you ask all the people around whether or not cutting down these pillars counts as attacking you?” sneered Long Chen.

“Nope, it doesn’t count, definitely not!”

Those experts shouted collectively. What kind of joke was that? The more Long Chen destroyed those divine pillars, the more fairly the Grand Dao energy would be spread to them.

Even the people from the ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, and the ancient family alliance stood beside Long Chen. Or perhaps more accurately they were standing on the side of what benefited them the most.

“I’m going to enter the Brahma Divine Palace, but these pillars are blocking my way, so naturally I have to cut them down. If you try to stop me, you’ll be my enemy, so we can face each other with blades!”

Long Chen once more swung Evilmoon, cutting down the divine pillars one by one, and making the experts on top of them furious.

They wanted to attack Long Chen, but that was limited to those who were still on the pillars. Those who had lost the pillars had lost their reason to attack. The people on the pillars were hesitating about whether or not they should fight when Long Chen cut down their pillars, not giving them a chance to ponder.

“Long Chen, you bastard, it hurts!” Evilmoon roared. The impact of each strike against these divine pillars was endured by it.

“Just endure it. It wasn’t easy to make up such an excuse. We can’t give it up.”

Long Chen continued to attack. Actually, each attack brought with it a backlash that caused his hand to bleed, but he gritted his teeth and endured it.

When the final pillar was cut down, the Grand Dao energy had reached an unprecedented density. All the disciples unleashed their manifestations, quickly absorbing that energy.

“Long Chen, just wait!” Within the crowd, Leng Wufeng glared at Long Chen. He had been disturbed at a critical moment. He had felt that he was just the slightest bit off from fully awakening his manifestation.

It wasn’t just Leng Wufeng. The others who had been on the pillars weren’t looking at Long Chen in a friendly manner either.

Amongst those experts, Long Chen also saw the dual sword wielding Lu Zichuan. It seemed that he had long since joined Pill Valley, or he wouldn’t be standing there.

As for Di Feng, Xie Luo, Yan Wei, and the others, there was even less to be said. They had long since wanted to tear Long Chen to pieces.

“Fine, I admit that I like seeing you so irritated without being able to do anything to me,” chortled Long Chen.

He knew that these people wouldn’t attack, at least not right now. They had all reached critical moments, being only one step from fully awakening their manifestations. As long as they weren’t fools, they would endure.

Long Chen was about to leave when Evilmoon’s furious roar rang out in his head. “Hurry and gather those pillars! Those are my compensation!”

Long Chen was startled, but he didn’t ask any questions. He waved his hand, sucking the divine pillars into the primal chaos space.

Di Feng and the others had yet to recover from their fury when they saw Long Chen taking the pillars.

“What are you looking at me for? Did those pillars belong to you? What does taking Pill Valley’s things have to do with you?” Long Chen didn’t give them a chance to say anything. He directly flew toward the palace.

Evilmoon vanished from his hand, reappearing in the primal chaos space and stabbing into the stone pillar. The pillar reacted by lighting up, trying to force Evilmoon away, but it immediately dimmed back down. Evilmoon was surrounded by black qi, and its two dragon marks lit up. It began absorbing the energy of the divine pillar.

“Evilmoon, since those are useful to you, it wasn’t a waste for me to spend so much effort helping you cut them down,” said Long Chen.

“Shut up. I was the one who noticed that I could absorb a portion of the divine energy inside the pillars,” said Evilmoon disdainfully.

Cutting down these divine pillars had caused it to yelp in pain. It didn’t have a physical body, but as an item-spirit, it could still feel pain. Only after enduring that pain did it suddenly realize that it could absorb a portion of the energy within the divine pillars.

That portion was perhaps just ten percent. The other ninety percent wasn’t absorbable. Expelling that useless portion of energy was troublesome, but it was worth it for the remaining ten percent.

“Little Heaven, come and absorb it as well. I’ll teach you how to do it.” Evilmoon actually called out to the Heaven Flipping Brick, teaching it how to absorb the energy. Little Heaven was actually quite afraid of Evilmoon, but Evilmoon was sharing this energy with it.

Long Chen would not use the Heaven Flipping Seal unless he had no other choice right now. Each time he used it, it would use up all its energy, and then it would have to slowly accumulate energy again. He normally only used it as a life-preserving talisman.

The shocking thing was that even after not using it for so long, the Heaven Flipping Seal’s power was still rising. It seemed that it could continue accumulating energy forever. Long Chen never managed to get a grasp of where its limit was.

With Evilmoon’s instructions, it began absorbing the divine pillar’s energy with it. However, amongst those teachings were a few curses about how stupid it was. However, the Heaven Flipping Seal was used to it. Although Evilmoon was fierce, at least it shared the good stuff with it.

Evilmoon and the Heaven Flipping Seal focused on absorbing the energy of the divine pillars. As for Long Chen, he was now close to the palace. However, there seemed to be some spatial law that kept him far away from it. He was still flying through the air.

Di Feng and the others felt an urge to charge toward the palace as well. After all, that was clearly where the apex inheritance of the Brahma secret realm lay.

“Should we go?” wondered one person.

However, Di Feng shook his head, “That ultimate inheritance definitely can’t belong to us. We can’t go.”

Any idiot would know that a true inheritance like this couldn’t be left for an outsider. Since Pill Valley dared to let them absorb the Grand Dao energy here, that meant that they weren’t afraid of them noticing this palace.

“Long Chen is surely courting death. Only the divine daughter Yu Qingxuan is qualified to enter this palace. Even the valley master himself couldn’t enter. If Long Chen really enters, he will be eaten alive by the palace,” said one of Pill Valley’s experts.

This expert’s combat power wasn’t especially high, but his alchemy arts were amazing, so he was greatly valued by Pill Valley. There weren’t many people on Pill Valley’s side that had actually been qualified to come here. It was unknown if it was because Pill Valley was so generous that they were leaving more opportunities to their allies, or whether they simply didn’t have the talented people to send.

When Long Chen approached the first stair leading up to the palace, two giant stone statues sprang to life. They were three thousand meter monsters, and when they opened their mouths, runes shot out, transforming into runic swords that slashed towards Long Chen.

Despite doing his best to dodge, one of those swords pierced right through his shoulder, causing blood to spray.

“Hahaha, do you see? That was just a warning. If Long Chen dares to force his way through, he’ll definitely die,” said that disciple from Pill Valley.

“Hopefully, he doesn’t. Long Chen has to die by my hands,” said Xiong Tianba.

“Hmph, you’ve already lost to him and aren’t qualified to fight him again. Long Chen’s head is fated to belong to me, Leng Wufeng,” sneered Leng Wufeng.

Xiong Tianba’s expression sank, but before he could speak, Long Chen had charged back onto the stair, and this time, he managed to avoid the runic swords and smash into the runic gate of the palace.

The runic gate had not been visible before. Only once Long Chen got close did it reveal itself. Long Chen smashed into it and was blown back, as well as struck by a dozen of the runic swords.

Long Chen let out a shout and took out a rod, smashing one of the stone monsters. However, it merely shuddered for a moment and then blew Long Chen back.

The void shook intensely, and the whole runic formation grew sluggish for a moment. Even the runic swords vanished.

“There is a way!”

Long Chen smiled, and the power of the azure dragon circulated within him. He smashed one of the stone monsters once more.
