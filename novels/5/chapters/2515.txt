Chapter 2505 Heaven-Defying Karmic Luck

BOOM! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A blood-colored battle armor smashed into the ground, and a wave of blood-colored light blasted away the surrounding Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders. It was truly a mighty entrance.

In his new suit, Guo Ran no longer looked the same. His battle armor was now bigger and had spikes on the helmet, shoulder, and elbow.

After landing on the ground, Guo Ran remained kneeling there. He had his head lowered, as if waiting for something.

As expected, countless bombs began to fall from the sky, blasting apart the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders.

As the bombs fell, their corpses flew through their air. Amidst their broken fragments, Guo Ran slowly rose. With a wave of his hand, he sent one of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders flying. Although he was wearing armor, his movements appeared particularly natural and graceful.

“This poser act gets a full mark.” Mo Nian raised his thumb at Guo Ran.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, a pair of wings split the void. Cloud charged in as well, her body even larger than before. Her wings created an opening within the sea of spiders.

After charging in, Cloud immediately transformed into her human form, appearing like a maiden. Ignoring the Dragonblood warriors that had been on her back, she went over to hug Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen!” Despite being the future leader of the Xuan Beasts, Cloud was still as pure-hearted as ever, and like a child in front of Long Chen.

At this moment, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, Liu Ruyan, and the others also walked over. They had all managed to advance to the fourth step of Netherpassage. Their auras were no longer the same.

“Boss.”

Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, Xia Chen, and the others took out their weapons, their gazes sharp.

The Dragonblood warriors were unleashing a whirlwind of killing intent. During this time, they had definitely not been slacking off. They had to have endured quite a few battles for their killing intent to remain so sharp.

“Assemble the formation!” As soon as they all arrived, Xia Chen gave orders. The Dragonblood warriors instantly entered one of their battle formations, and rays of Sword Qi began to fly through the air, killing the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders.

“Damn, did they all get completely reborn?” Mo Nian was shocked. The Dragonblood warriors were slaughtering the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders easily.

Although they were within Long Chen’s flame domain, weakening their defenses, their attacks were incredibly sharp. Upon reaching the fourth step of Netherpassage, the Dragonblood warriors were completely different from before.

“Long Chen, how did you get trapped here?” asked Meng Qi.

“It’s hard to explain. You came from outside, so how many of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders are there?” asked Long Chen.

“Everything within ten million miles has been filled with these spiders. This entire world is full of them. We also saw more of them flying over here. It seems as if the entire Star Field Divine World’s Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders are being drawn over here. This place is the center. If it wasn’t for Cloud’s power to break the void, it would have been difficult to charge through to this place. How did you get trapped here?” asked Tang Wan-er.

“I’ll explain it all later. Tell me, did you encounter any troubles after leaving the life and death spring? What about the others?” asked Long Chen.

Meng Qi said, “We continued to be sneak attacked a few times while advancing, but they were pretty weak. After a few of us finished our advancements, we stood guard and took turns. After completely wiping out the groups that continued to cause trouble for us, they eventually stopped. The sea demon race arrived at that time, and Gu Yang and the others spent the better part of a day fighting that fellow from the Six Horn Sea Serpent race. However, he was too powerful, and he managed to get away. Gu Yang and the others also didn’t dare to get too far from the life and death spring, so they let him go. After we all finished advancing, according to your instructions, we left without leaving anyone to guard the spring. We had Guo Ran lead the way, and we discovered seven divine ore deposits, two secret abodes, and a training area that allowed the Dragonblood warriors to once more strengthen their physical bodies. We obtained five divine arts and were capable of cracking two of them. One of them is the Wind God’s Incantation that Tang Wan-er has already started to train in. Another was an ancient text on swordplay. It was too difficult for anyone else to comprehend, so we left it to Yue Zifeng. Other than those things, we killed nine thirteenth rank beasts, obtained twelve of their young, five housepet eggs…”

As Meng Qi explained their gains, Long Chen and Mo Nian were stunned. Mo Nian’s eyes almost popped out of his head.

“Is this really true? How can your luck be so good?” demanded Mo Nian.

When Meng Qi began to take out some of the young of the beasts that they had killed, their terrifying auras made it so that Mo Nian had no choice but to believe it.

“Hahaha, it’s all thanks to me. With my karmic luck, not finding all these amazing treasures would have been difficult. It just so happens I needed several of those divine materials. It allowed me to strengthen my armor again. Hehe, although these additions are just temporary, my combat power has risen a great deal.” Guo Ran smiled proudly.

Guo Ran had truly taken the spotlight this time. He had led them to huge gains.

There were four times when killing the thirteenth rank beasts that they arrived at the perfect time. One of them had just laid an egg and was extremely weak. There was another one whose lifespan had almost reached an end. As everyone else was fighting it, Guo Ran killed it in one blow, shocking everyone.

That was because at that time, Guo Ran had made additions to his armor, and while he had said that he could defeat a thirteenth rank beast on his own, they hadn’t quite believed it until he had killed it in one blow.

It was only later that they realized the beast’s old age. Guo Ran’s attack had just happened to exhaust the last dregs of its energy.

As for the other two beasts, it was rather funny, but they had stolen them. Those beasts had been about to be killed by others when the Dragonblood Legion arrived.

There had been a group of fifty thousand Corrupt experts attacking one thirteenth rank beast. They had underestimated its abilities, and thousands of them had been killed before they barely managed to give it a severe injury. Just as they had been about to settle things, the Dragonblood Legion had arrived.

Upon seeing that they were from the Corrupt path, the Dragonblood Legion had directly started a slaughter. The Corrupt experts had tried to resist so that they could still bring the beast’s corpse away with them.

However, despite the beast’s injured state, it was still putting up a fight. It was impossible to put it away when it wasn’t dead. The Corrupt experts had wanted to endure, but the Dragonblood Legion was too fierce. In just the first exchange, they scattered. In the end, over ten thousand of them were killed while the rest fled. The Dragonblood Legion obtained a huge profit.

Another beast was the same, only the victim this time was the sea demon race. However, they were smart and had used poison. That beast was powerful but unable to stop them from poisoning it repeatedly. In the end, it lost its ability to resist.

Just as the sea demon race was about to reap their harvest, Guo Ran led the Dragonblood Legion over. Seeing this scene and with their previous experience, they immediately transformed into a pack of bandits, slaughtering tens of thousands of sea demons. By the time that fight was over, the beast was already poisoned to death.

Hearing Guo Ran’s excited explanation about all this left Long Chen and Mo Nian speechless. This karmic luck was truly monstrous. Good things were just running into his lap.

Before this, Mo Nian hadn’t been too much of a believer in karmic luck. But Guo Ran’s ability proved it.

However, in this particular case, it was far too conspicuous. Although other heavenly geniuses had good karmic luck, it definitely wasn’t so heaven-defying.

Meng Qi and the others had concluded that this luck was most likely the sum of all of their karmic luck. If one person’s karmic luck could be so heaven-defying, then it would have reached the level of affecting the Heavenly Daos.

The other possibility was perhaps that Guo Ran’s power was so bad that even the heavens pitied him and blessed him with good things to make up for it. Once he was stronger, perhaps he would no longer be so blessed.

Of course, when it came to karmic luck, there was no way to conclude anything precisely. They could only guess as only the heavens knew the truth.

There was one thing that could be confirmed though. Here in the Star Field Divine World, Guo Ran’s karmic luck was truly frightening.

“Alright, since we’re all gathered now, let’s think of a way of killing all these Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders,” said Long Chen.

Thanks to their arrival, Long Chen now knew that these Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders were coming from all over the Star Field Divine World. They hadn’t mistakenly barged into their territory.

In other words, no matter where they went, they would have to face the spiders’ attacks. If they wanted to stop them from being a hindrance, they had to kill them all.

“Meng Qi, I have something good for you.” Long Chen suddenly thought of the Void Mirror he had obtained on the Ghost Ship. He took out the crystalline mirror and circulated his Spiritual Strength.

As a result, a beam of light shot through the void. It started off the size of a palm but quickly grew, blasting apart any Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders that it touched. A large hole was then left in the void.

That gap in the spiders allowed them to see that it really was as Meng Qi had said. The Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders had completely surrounded this place. The gap was thousands of miles deep, but the only thing that could be seen was the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders. The gap was instantly filled.

Mo Nian was stunned by their numbers but also by Long Chen’s mirror. Its power was terrifying.

“What a beautiful and powerful mirror.” Meng Qi covered her mouth. She had already realized that this was a terrifying soul item.

“It’s been years since I’ve given you a nice gift. This Void Mirror is something I obtained on the Ghost Ship. I hope you like it.” Long Chen smiled and pressed it into Meng Qi’s hand.
