Chapter 3903 Weng Tianyao Attacks

This sword had sucked away all the metal energy of the world, emitting an incredibly ancient aura. It was as though a dormant beast had been roused from slumber, and this sharp aura was the fearsome fangs of this beast. With each swing, it effortlessly cleaved through the sky, shattering the very foundations of the ten thousand Daos.

“I refuse to believe a little Immortal King can shake an immemorial devil corpse!”

As Shi Yang slammed his hands together, the bat-like wings on his back lit up, folding defensively in front of him.

But everything he did was useless. When the golden sword fell, it still sliced through his wings, his blood spraying through the air. As the gigantic wings fell to the ground, most of the black runes on them shattered, dissipating into heaven and earth.

As for his body, it tumbled back into the distance. With a final stamp in the air, a long line of ripples appeared beneath his feet.

After he had stabilized himself, people saw his current appearance and were stunned. As half of those wings had been severed, the shortened wings didn’t match the rest of his body, looking almost comical.

To their surprise, there was also a line of blood on his head. Bai Shishi’s Sword Qi hadn’t just severed his wings but also harmed his body.

However, after passing through his defense, her Sword Qi was clearly weakened and unable to cause a substantial injury.

“What a pity!”

Seeing this scene, Guo Ran and Xia Chen both felt a wave of regret. Bai Shishi had such a terrifying power, but they had wasted this chance.

If they had worked together, with her terrifying offensive power, they would have had a large chance of killing Shi Yang.

Shi Yang’s corpse was too powerful, exceeding the scope of their understanding. Although he was unable to unleash this corpse’s divine abilities, just its physical body wasn’t something that they could deal with.

“Hahaha, unexpected, how unexpected! Someone could actually sever my wings! How shocking!” Shi Yang looked at his severed wings in shock. However, he then clapped and praised her. “But so what? No one in the three thousand worlds can stop me.”

“This attack severed your wings, and the next one will cut off your head!” Bai Shishi raised her sword again.

Shi Yang sneered disdainfully, “The attack just now sucked away almost this entire world’s metal energy. Where are you going to get more energy? Furthermore, did you think that severing my wings would weaken me? How naive.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Shi Yang then formed hand seals, and black qi swirled out of his severed wings. In front of everyone’s stunned gazes, his wings quickly regrew. He practically recovered in an instant.

Everyone was dumbfounded by this. How could this be? How did Shi Yang possess such a terrifying recovery ability? This was an immemorial devil corpse!

“My Corpse Devil Dao’s inheritance isn’t something trash like you can imagine. Having used primal chaos qi to fully merge with this body, even if I can’t activate its divine abilities, just its physical body alone is enough to crush you.”

Shi Yang laughed and flapped his recovered wings, charging forward with brute force.

In response, Bai Shishi furiously raised her sword again. But this time, Guo Ran shouted, “Don’t be brash! This fellow definitely has a weakness! Only a well-timed attack can kill him, otherwise, you’re just wasting energy!”

None of them understood the Corpse Devil Dao, and in particular, this was an immemorial devil corpse. They had to find its weak spot first before attacking.

“Who are you calling brash?!” raged Bai Shishi.

Guo Ran: “...”

Bai Xiaole said, “Ignore her. Her head sometimes gets muddled. When that happens, she won’t listen to anyone, not even her father and mother. Only boss is an exception.”

After hearing this, an understanding expression appeared on their faces. At this time, the Pill Fairy moved forward. She was more cool-headed than Bai Shishi, so her sword merely danced, unleashing a net of flying rainbows that interrupted Shi Yang’s assault.

Her flying rainbows were made of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, capable of locking down the space around Shi Yang.

Facing this obstacle, Shi Yang’s claws tore through the void and the flames. But this net of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame still caused his speed to plummet. It was like he was stuck in a swamp where all movements became difficult.

Even so, Shi Yang furiously pushed through, using his wings as blades. He then stamped through the air, reaching for the Pill Fairy with his claws.

However, a sword struck Shi Yang’s claws at this moment, sending sparks flying in the air alongside Shi Yang. Bai Shishi had joined forces with the Pill Fairy.

“Thank you for your help, big sister.” Seeing her come to her aid, the Pill Fairy smiled gratefully.

“You’re the big sister,“ replied Bai Shishi. After saying this, she suddenly blushed, feeling embarrassed and vexed. With one sentence, she had set their status.

The embarrassed Bai Shishi couldn’t even look at others. With nowhere else to vent, she turned her wrath on Shi Yang, her sword dancing through the air.

On the other hand, the Pill Fairy was flabbergasted, not understanding what Bai Shishi’s words meant. Bai Shishi’s expression suddenly grew odd after saying that, and she was attacking Shi Yang like he was the murderer of her father.

Also, the Pill Fairy noticed all the people around Long Chen staring at her with complicated emotions. It was like they knew her.

However, she didn’t have time to ask questions. She also shot after Shi Yang, joining forces with Bai Shishi.

Even with both of them working together, Shi Yang was just too powerful. He was constantly getting closer to Long Chen. As the two of them were unable to stop him, Guo Ran and Bai Xiaole decided to join the fray.

Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox would join forces to attack. But after every attack, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox wanted to curse furiously.

It was weakened gravely, unable to even unleash its own power due to the limitations of Bai Xiaole’s cultivation base and skills.

Fortunately, its physical body was also terrifying. Just by relying on that, it could clash with Shi Yang directly. Even if it couldn’t beat Shi Yang, it wasn’t afraid of being injured.

With their combined might, Shi Yang was unable to press on and harm Long Chen, so he was incensed. For him, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox was the greatest hindrance. Seeing his fury though, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox seemed to feel much better and worked even harder at stopping Shi Yang. The unhappier Shi Yang was, the happier it was.

Seeing them all join forces to stop Shi Yang, the surrounding experts saw their chance. Hence, they collapsed on the Dragonblood Legion once more, starting another chaotic battle.

“Bastards! It’s useless even if you stop me! Others will still eliminate Long Chen!” roared Shi Yang.

Perhaps his mouth was prophetic. As soon as he said this, thunder shook the world. With the lightning weaving together, it was like a heavenly tribulation was descending.

Within this lightning, they saw a streak of lightning shooting toward Long Chen. From within the Dragonblood Legion, Jiang Lei’s expression changed.

“Watch out! That’s Weng Tianyao!”

“I, Weng Tianyao, will kill you today, Long Chen!”

A thunderous roar reverberated. Even before his voice spread, a lightning-clad figure already appeared in front of the Dragonblood Legion with incomparable speed.

However, just as he reached them, a black meteor fell from the heavens and perfectly struck Weng Tianyao.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, the sea of lightning was blown apart. The world darkened as an enormous figure covered the sky.
