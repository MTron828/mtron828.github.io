Chapter 3954 Mediocre?

“You little bastard, you have big guts to defy my will!”

Inside a glorious palace decked in splendor, a square-faced middle-aged man sat atop the dragon throne, radiating an aura of dignity and prestige, but there was now a hint of anger on his face.

His aura was strong like the sea, with a natural ruler qi. But despite displaying an electric gaze, his complexion was gloomy.

On both of his sides, there were dozens of old experts wearing golden robes, all having white hair. But despite their age, the auras that they gave off were very frightening.

The middle-aged man was precisely the current emperor of the Vermilion Bird Empire, Yu Xiaoyun. Atop his dragon throne was a giant sign: Royal Family Hall.

The Royal Family Hall was only opened to judge matters relating to the emperor’s family, and those who could enter this hall were the highest, noblest existences within the royal family. So, these elders were mostly cousins and relatives of the emperor.

To put it frankly, this hall was only opened when a prince or princess committed a grave taboo. The elders would then decide what to do with them jointly here.

“Your majesty, calm yourself. I’ve already asked around. This Long Chen’s origins are not ordinary, moreover, it’s only natural for a youngster to feel prideful and arrogant.”

There were two spots beside the dragon throne and two beautiful women were sitting there. One of them looked somewhat similar to Yu Qingxuan. She was Yu Qingxuan’s mother, and she was the one speaking.

“Hmph, youngsters don’t know how high the heavens are. I want to see just what skill he has to dare speak so arrogantly to me,” snorted Yu Xiaoyun.

Hearing this, Yu Qingxuan’s mother exchanged a glance with the other woman. There seemed to be a teasing expression in their eyes. Now, there would be something interesting to watch.

“Long Chen has arrived!”

After the eunuch at the door shouted, the people in the room instantly turned to see a black-robed man slowly walk in.

This time, there was no need for anyone to say anything to him. Long Chen had already put away the Minghong Saber, after all, he had come to propose. Carrying a saber while doing so was a bit improper.

Even so, as soon as Long Chen walked in, the atmosphere in the room became tense. All of their gazes swept over his body like sharp blades, as if they were trying to see through him.

Ignoring these gazes, Long Chen looked around and saw that the hall was very large. Yu Xiaoyun was seated atop the dragon throne, looking down from high above and coldly watching as Long Chen walked in.

As others sized Long Chen up, he also did the same to them. But then, randomly looking around like this in the presence of the emperor was a very rude conduct. A prince or princess who did such a thing would be struck by the rod twenty times.

However, Long Chen did not seem to care. One reason was because he didn’t know, and the other reason was that even if he did know, he still had to do the same. Otherwise, how would he show his power to them? How would they talk in a bit?

When Long Chen looked at Yu Xiaoyun, his tense heart instantly relaxed a great deal. This Yu Xiaoyun was completely different from the Yu Xiaoyun on the Martial Heaven Continent, be it his look or his aura.

After that, Long Chen looked at the woman beside the emperor, instantly recognizing her to be Yu Qingxuan’s mother.

“Junior Long Chen greets mother-in-law. I am indebted to you just for allowing me to meet you. In my hurry to come here, I did not prepare a good gift. I truly apologize.” Long Chen actually ignored Yu Xiaoyun and first bowed to Yu Qingxuan’s mother.

Yu Qingxuan’s mother smiled and nodded to him, her expression very friendly. However, she didn’t speak as it wasn’t her time to.

“You are not just lacking in manners, it looks like you have no manners at all. Don’t you know that there is a proper order of etiquette? Are you not even able to differentiate the hierarchy here?” said an elder.

It was clearly a lack of respect to not kowtow to the emperor and instead greet the empress first. Such an offense could result in a severe punishment.

Only then did Long Chen look at Yu Xiaoyun, who was also looking straight at him. As they stared at each other, the atmosphere in the palace seemed to freeze.

Long Chen was patient. He stared at Yu Xiaoyun and Yu Xiaoyun stared at him darkly, both not saying a word to each other.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The silence lasted a full hour before Yu Xiaoyun finally shouted, “What a rude brat! How dare you not pay respect to me? Do you think that I am not worth it?”

“I, Long Chen, will only kneel to my father and mother. Not even heaven and earth can make me kneel. Well, since you’ve spoken, it means that you’ve agreed. Alright, father-in-law, accept your son-in-law’s respect.” Long Chen started to kneel.

“Stop! When did I agree to this?!” raged Yu Xiaoyun. He waved his hand, and before Long Chen could fully kneel, a wave of power crashed into him.

As a result, Long Chen was forced back three steps before he could stabilize his swaying body, causing his heart to shake. Yu Xiaoyun was truly powerful.

That power was not just strong; it was a mix of soft and hard energy. Considering Long Chen’s current strength, someone who could silently push him like this was definitely an absolutely terrifying existence.

As for the others in the hall, seeing Long Chen able to stabilize himself in three steps, they were all shocked, including Yu Xiaoyun.

Considering Yu Xiaoyun’s power, under normal circumstances when Long Chen was caught off-guard, he should have been directly blown outside the palace.

Moreover, even if Long Chen was prepared and unleashed his full power to resist, the earth shouldn't be able to endure that power, and the protective formation would activate.

However, Long Chen simply retreated three steps. Let alone damaging the ground, he didn’t even damage the carpet, which meant that Yu Xiaoyun’s power was dispelled within Long Chen’s body, not dispersed beneath his feet. Thus, everyone looked at Long Chen with a new level of respect.

“What? Your majesty, are you going back on your word? I don’t think that matches your status, no?” Long Chen smiled slightly.

When Long Chen said this, Yu Qingxuan’s mother smiled. She thought that Long Chen was quite crafty, grasping this chance to be absolutely shameless. His face was truly thick.

“What nonsense. To kneel to me is to greet the emperor of the Vermilion Bird Empire. Now that you have entered the Vermilion Bird Empire, you must abide by the empire’s laws. As the ninety-fifth generation’s emperor, am I not worthy of this?” demanded Yu Xiaoyun coldly. He didn’t particularly care about this etiquette, but Long Chen’s expression greatly displeased him.

Long Chen shrugged indifferently. “Ninety-fifth generation, ninety-eighth generation, what does it matter to me? I only offer my respects to you because you are my father-in-law.”

“What shamelessness! Your cultivation base is average, and your looks are mediocre. What qualifications do you have to marry my most beloved daughter?!” barked Yu Xiaoyun.

“My looks are mediocre? Have you ever looked in the mirror? Even with your looks, you could marry my peerlessly beautiful mother-in-law. So what right do you have to say such a thing to me?” demanded Long Chen angrily while looking at Yu Qingxuan’s mother.

At that moment, the entire Royal Family Hall fell deathly silent. All those imperial experts were struck as dumb as wooden chickens.
