Chapter 2864 Bloodline Spirit Weapon

“A sword cultivator!”

Startled cries rang out. For Long Chen to be able to shatter weapons on the same level so easily, he could only be a legendary sword cultivator.

Sword cultivators were inconceivable existences even within the immortal world, said to possess the greatest offensive power.

When those three were killed, the other disciples felt the chill. No one had expected Long Chen to be a terrifying sword cultivator.

The High Firmament Academy had a Sword Dao Institute. But sword cultivators were too rare, so the number of the old and young members of the Sword Dao Institute together was only a few hundred.

Furthermore, sword cultivators were usually aloof and kept a distance away from the rest of the crowd. Sometimes the disciples of the Sword Dao Institute wouldn’t step outside for years or even decades.

However, their position was definitely extremely high. It was said that they received practically whatever resources that they wanted.

If Long Chen was a sword cultivator, he should have directly joined the Sword Dao Institute. Why had he run to the God Institute which was practically destitute in comparison?

However, they didn’t have time to think too much. Long Chen was sweeping through their midst like a phantom. As soon as he killed three people, he swept out his sword, a sharp light coming out of it. That was sword-light, a power that only sword cultivators could unleash. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

One disciple was unable to dodge in time, but he also didn’t dare to face Long Chen head-on. In a rush, he took out a shield. With a light sound, half of that shield fell to the ground, and then half of that disciple’s body fell along with it. Long Chen’s sword had sliced him in two along with his shield.

“Don’t be afraid! Sword cultivators have weak bodies! One heavy blow and he’ll die!” shouted another disciple. The fatal weakness of sword cultivators was just as well known as their terrifying offensive power.

BOOM!

That disciple hadn’t even finished speaking before a giant hammer struck Long Chen in the back. However, without turning back, Long Chen smashed his fist behind him. The hammer was sent flying, while the attacker’s arms were broken. He hacked up blood.

“What…?”

Now everyone was dumbfounded. How could a sword cultivator also possess such a powerful physical body? Was he a sword cultivator or not?

In an instant, eight people were killed by Long Chen, and their corpses were tossed into the lava. The others began to run.

All of a sudden, a blood-colored saber whistled toward Long Chen, and he raised his sword to block. As a result, sparks flew and the entire cave shuddered.

Chu Kuang had finally joined in. His saber’s runes shone brightly. This was a powerful weapon.

“Long Chen, be careful! It’s a spirit weapon!” warned Luo Ning.

Spirit weapons. They were extremely precious and possessed terrifying destructive power. Normal people weren’t qualified to possess them.

Their name came due to them possessing their own spirituality. Only experts who had ignited their divine flames could activate that spirituality. But somehow, Chu Kuang was also capable of it.

“Long Chen, although your power has somewhat exceeded my expectations, remember my words. No matter how strong you are, it’s not enough in front of me.” Chu Kuang pressed down with his saber, his aura growing.

“How interesting. It seems that you are very confident. I feel like I’ve seen through your power, but you feel like you’ve seen through me as well. However, my confidence is real, while yours is fake. So today, you’re the one who’s going to lose.” Long Chen remained indifferent even as he received Chu Kuang’s increasing power.

Chu Kuang sneered, “I don’t even know how many confident idiots like you that I’ve killed. I like your expressions the most just as you realize that you’re about to die.”

“Are you talking about yourself? If you really were confident, you wouldn't conceal your power. Your Chu family really is trash. You were only able to rise again due to betraying your master. After rising, in order to conceal what you had done, you completely devoured the entire bloodline of your master. Did you think that eating up an honorable family tree would cover up your beast-like actions? The blood of despicable animals flows within your Chu family. Just your gaze is enough for me to see your sinisterness, your despicableness, your craftiness, as well as the cowardice and inferiority you feel deep in your heart. For you to be able to so unashamedly say such big words at this time really is amazing. You managed to train your facial skin into such a thick wall,” mocked Long Chen.

Luo Ning and Luo Bing were startled. Long Chen was aware of the history of the Chu family that they had done their best to cover up.

It had to be known that the Luo family’s people all knew the Chu family’s history in order to understand the deep enmity that lay between them.

However, very few outsiders were aware of the Chu family’s matters. After all, the Chu family had long since erased any history that didn’t show them in a good light.

What they didn’t know was just the number of historical texts that Long Chen had read. The Chu family’s history wasn’t his main reading topic. He only learned about them from the history of the Ying Prefecture’s Luo family.

Some fragmentary comments also taught him about the despicable things that the Chu family had done. On the other hand, Long Chen couldn’t find anything like that in the Luo family’s history

This showed just how strict the Luo family’s teachings were. They didn’t do things that couldn’t be revealed to others. The fact that they disdained beautifying their own history gave Long Chen a good feeling about the Luo family.

Although his mother came from the Luo family, he wouldn’t automatically be on their side just because of it. Just like how he was surnamed Long and detested the Long family, he had his own principles.

“What drivel! You dare to blaspheme my Chu family? I will turn you to dust!” Long Chen’s words seemed to have touched one of Chu Kuang’s nerves. At this moment, his eyes turned red, while centipede-like lines appeared around his eyes and spread throughout his face.

His Blood Qi erupted like a wild beast had awakened. Also, his saber rumbled intensely as if it had been woken up as well.

An overwhelming power then poured out of his saber. Upon seeing this, Long Chen’s heart shook, and he twisted his sword to force the saber aside. A ray of light then shot out of the saber toward some of the disciples.

That sharp saber-light tore through those disciples in an instant, killing them. It then struck the wall, leaving a deep cut in it, making fragments of stone rain down.

Luo Ning and Luo Bing were both shocked by what they saw. Luo Bing cried out, “Long Chen, be careful! He possesses the Chu family’s bloodline divine ability! His spirit weapon is a bloodline spirit weapon. Combined, he can unleash unlimited power!”

Just at this moment, the lava behind Long Chen exploded, and a fiery heat washed over everyone.

“It’s finally drawn out!” Long Chen was delighted. A Heavenly Flame seed was about to show itself.
