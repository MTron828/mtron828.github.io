Chapter 4405 Please Be Quiet

Hundreds of humanoid experts with black wings on their backs were using their bows to fight on the battlefield, emitting an earthly aura as they fought. Among them were both men and women, young and old. Three Eternal experts were leading the charge, strategically retreating while fighting to prevent their foes from encircling them.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, the opposing forces were overwhelming in number, rapidly closing in for an imminent encirclement. Once surrounded, there would be no escape.

“I will use the Earth Spirit Blood Ignition to stop them. Run away!” shouted one of those Eternal experts.

“No, I will do it. You are the only one who can lead everyone out!” shouted the other two Eternal experts.

“Shut up! Now isn’t the time to show off your spirit of sacrifice! I am the only one capable of stopping them! You two aren’t strong enough. Hurry up, or everyone will die like this!” roared that Eternal expert. The ground beneath his feet suddenly withered, and his aura doubled in intensity.

Seeing him so decisive, the other two Eternal experts were overcome with pain and sorrow. The use of this divine ability would enhance his strength, yet once his core energy depleted, he would face inevitable death.

The other bow-wielding lifeforms were filled with fury and hatred, but there were just too many enemies for them to kill.

“Run!” The other two Eternal experts directly roared with fury and split their group in two, attacking the blockade from two different directions.

“You want to leave? Keep dreaming. Tell us Ye Ling’s whereabouts and we’ll spare your life. Otherwise, we’ll make you live a life worse than death.”

Just then, the void exploded. As dozens of Eternal experts appeared at once, their only path of retreat was sealed shut.

With the addition of the new Eternal experts on the battlefield, the encirclement was complete.

“It’s over…” The Eternal expert who had ignited his essence blood instantly turned pale with despair. He stopped igniting his blood.

Igniting his blood did double his combat power, allowing him to temporarily hold back the nine Eternal experts for everyone to get away.

However, in the blink of an eye, dozens of strong reinforcements appeared, so he completely despaired and gave up.

Wielding a giant warhammer in his hand, a large Eternal lifeform with two golden horns on his head shouted coldly, “Where is Ye Ling!? I’ll spare your lives if you tell me!”

“You want us to sell out our Saint? Keep dreaming! Our Earth Spirit race will never produce any traitors!” shouted the Eternal experts of the Earth Spirit race. They suddenly put away their bows, and their auras grew unstable.

“They’re self-detonating!”

Shocked and enraged, the horned Eternal expert wanted to stop them, but he didn’t dare to.

After all, the three of them were self-detonating at the same time. As they would rather die than submit, if the horned Eternal expert were to attack now, he would likely be unable to stop their detonation and be badly injured instead.

Suddenly, the void exploded, and three streaks of seven-color divine light shot out, piercing their chests. As a result, the three of them ceased inflating and shrank back down, their self-detonations abruptly interrupted.

The horned lifeform was delighted that someone had managed to stop them. On the other hand, the three Eternal experts of the Earth Spirit race were confused. They had no time to consider this change or even wonder why this person had interrupted their final struggles without causing them substantial wounds. All of a sudden, they raised their bows toward their own people.

If their self-detonation was interrupted, fine. However, they had to prevent the ones with weaker cultivation bases from being captured alive. It was the only way to protect their secrets.

“Race leader Hao Feng, don’t be rash! The Earth Mound race is here to assist you!”

Just then, an excited voice rang out, and a gust of wind blew through this world, raising a wave of dust. They saw a long-haired man in black robes.

A spherical lifeform then jumped off this man’s shoulder and instantly became a three-foot-long sphere.

This black-robed man was naturally Long Chen. While rushing over here, he had used his Seven Peak Swords to interrupt their self-detonations without harming their core.

Hao Feng was startled to see Bally, but then he shouted with exasperation, “Earth Mound race? What are you doing?! Run!”

The Earth Mound race was not powerful. They did have a special skill when it came to running for their lives, but that was all. Coming here now was no different from sending itself to its death.

“Race leader Hao Feng, don’t be afraid! My Earth Mound race has found a powerful helper that can guarantee everyone's safety!” shouted Bally confidently.

“Who are you?”

Upon seeing Long Chen, the experts on the battlefield were dumbfounded. Long Chen had not unleashed his aura, but his cultivation base was clearly only in the World King realm. However, the way he arrived was startling, leaving everyone feeling that he was unfathomable.

Long Chen simply raised his hand and threw his Seven Peak Sword. It instantly crossed hundreds of miles to pierce that person’s head.

Not expecting Long Chen to suddenly attack, by the time the Eternal expert reacted, he was already dead.

Long Chen’s seven-color Supreme Blood had not fully recovered yet, leaving him unable to use the blood ignition technique again. However, it could still use a sneak attack like this.

“Shhh.”

Long Chen raised his finger and pressed it against his lips.

“My little sister is sleeping. Please be quiet. If you wake her up, don’t blame me for being ruthless and killing you all.”

“Courting death!”

Seeing Long Chen kill one of them so casually and then act this way, the rest of the Eternal experts were fully incensed. Immediately, dozens of Eternal experts shot at Long Chen under the lead of the horned lifeform.

“How foolish.” Long Chen held Little Crane in his left hand. Doing his best not to disturb her, he simply summoned a snow-white flame lotus in his right hand.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

BOOM!

The flame lotus shot out and exploded amongst the enemy’s ranks, its icy flames devouring all of them.

Other than the Eternal experts, the weaklings were wiped out. Even the surviving Eternal experts were covered in burning frost, and they couldn’t help but let out screams of terror.

“A good chance!”

The elder called Hao Feng immediately raised his bow, and his arrow pierced the chest of the horned lifeform who was trying to fend off the flames.

The other experts of the Earth Spirit race also took this chance to unleash a torrent of arrows at the opposing Eternal experts.

Those Eternal experts shouted in fright and fled for their lives. Unfortunately, the weaker experts of the Earth Spirit race were unable to inflict fatal wounds on them.

Only a few dozen of them were killed by arrows, and the rest fled miserably, still burning.

Watching them flee, Hao Feng didn’t chase after them and directly came to Long Chen’s side.

“Thank you for saving us. My Earth Spirit race will never forget this.”
