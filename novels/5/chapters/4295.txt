Chapter 4284 Black-Hearted Old Ghost, the Immoral Daoist

Mo Nian’s arrow shot straight through the crack in the gate.0

Buzz.0

The arrow was instantly blasted apart by some terrifying astral wind, but just as the arrow was destroyed, an object like a pine needle went through the crack.0

“AH! Damn human race brat!”0

A furious roar came from the other side of the gate. It was unknown what Mo Nian had done to enrage that lifeform.1

Despite them not knowing about it, people were still amazed that Mo Nian managed to attack that lifeform through the gate.0

“Senior, what about me? Maybe you should test me too! You can’t leave all the good things to Long Chen!” Mo Nian cupped his fists to Feng Xinyue.0

Feng Xinyue looked at him and shook her head. “Child, you like showing off too much and aren’t steady enough. It will be difficult for you to be a leader.”0

“What? I’m actually very steady as a person! At least, I’m steadier than Long Chen! Just look, I only have a single fiancee! I have never gone around picking up more flowers like Long Chen!” Mo Nian patted his chest proudly.0

“That’s because you don’t have the ability. Only Liu Zongying doesn’t dislike you, so don’t act like you’re some holy man,” raged Tang Wan-er. “On the Martial Heaven Continent, didn’t you try to seduce Ye Lingshan? Did you forget the message she gave you? ‘As long as you’re well, it’s like spring thunder.’ Are you really that oblivious about yourself?”11

“Fuck, that fellow really isn’t a good brother! He even told you about this?!” Mo Nian was instantly embarrassed.1

“You have the wicked heart, and the wicked guts, but not the wicked abilities. And you dare to critique our Long Chen? As I see it, you’re a bad influence. I’m going to tell Long Chen to sever ties with you,” declared Tang Wan-er ruthlessly.3

Seeing Mo Nian being playfully humiliated by Tang Wan-er’s sharp words, Meng Qi and the rest burst into laughter. However, deep down, they all knew that Mo Nian was just joking. After all, his bond with Long Chen was akin to that of true brothers. Only Tang Wan-er was taking it too seriously.1

Feng Xinyue said, “In truth, your talent is not inferior to that of Long Chen, and your character isn’t that bad. However, you are lacking Long Chen’s daring and charisma. Still, it can’t be blamed on you. Considering that you are following that Immoral Daoist, it’s natural for you to inherit his legacy. The Immoral Daoist never accepts suffering a loss. In fact, in his opinion, as long as he isn’t getting an advantage, it counts as suffering a loss. But focusing so much on immediate profit affects one’s ability to see further and isn’t favorable in the long run.”0

“You’re right, you’re absolutely right! That old fellow, he’s far too short-sighted and unscrupulous! He’s a petty little cheater, a shameless hoodlum!” Mo Nian nodded vigorously.1

Hearing this, everyone was startled. Everyone knew that a master had to be respected, but Mo Nian actually spoke about his master this way? Wasn’t that too unfilial?0

“However, you should not provoke your master. He has many abilities that he has not shared with you yet,” advised Feng Xinyue.0

“He has more abilities?” Mo Nian was surprised.0

“Do you think he only knows how to run and rob graves? I know your master all too well. His power is very shocking, so you should learn more from him. I’ve watched your way of fighting, so I know that he hasn’t imparted a single one of Limitless Palace’s peak techniques to you,” said Feng Xinyue.0

Mo Nian raged, “That black-hearted old ghost! I’ve handed over so many treasures to him, and he didn’t even give me anything!”2

In reality, the Immoral Daoist had assured Mo Nian that he had imparted his complete legacy to him. However, this entire legacy was only about graverobbing and fleeing, nothing more.1

As a result, Mo Nian’s current accomplishments in combat were all thanks to his own efforts. He could be said to have finished his apprenticeship and started making a living for himself. But whenever he encountered the Immoral Daoist, he would be plundered of all his new treasures.1

The Immoral Daoist even shamelessly said that those were tuition fees, saying that it was a tradition of the Limitless Palace, an investment for the future.0

Thinking of how many times he had been robbed in vain, Mo Nian was furious. It would be one thing if Mo Nian hadn’t even given him anything, but to take all his treasures and teach him nothing? Now, Mo Nian felt like he was on the brink of exploding.0

“Senior, what is behind this gate?” asked Mo Nian.0

“This gate leads to another planar world. Other than the human race, the world has experts from all other races,” said Feng Xinyue.0

“It doesn’t have the human race? Are you saying…”0

“Yes. In that world, the human race has been exterminated. Thankfully, Long Chen has stopped the gate from opening, essentially granting the human race a year to prepare. Around one year from now, the primal chaos qi and the laws of both worlds will reach an equilibrium, and it will be possible to push the gate open. When that time comes, the human race will be facing the terrifying experts of the various races. I should note that these are experts who were born and grew up in a world with complete laws and bountiful primal chaos qi. They have an immense advantage over us. In the same realm, they have absolute superiority. Even so, Long Chen has bought us one year, so everyone should cherish this chance and cultivate hard. Otherwise, when the gate opens, the human race will simply be slaughtered,” warned Feng Xinyue.1

“Zhiqiu.”0

Just then, a voice rang out. As they heard the voice, a chilling sensation gripped everyone's souls, making them feel as though they were on the brink of freezing.4

Ye Zhiqiu trembled. She then turned to Meng Qi and the others sadly. “My master is calling me.”0𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Good sister. Go. We’ll see each other soon,” consoled Meng Qi.0

Ye Zhiqiu nodded and waved goodbye. After that, she flew off in a certain direction.0

“Little Yu.” 0

Ye Wusheng looked at Dong Mingyu and called her as well. Dong Mingyu hesitantly walked out. She wanted to stay, but in the end, she still said tearful goodbyes to Meng Qi and the others.0

The Shadow Sect’s disciples didn’t say a word and just went to Ye Wusheng’s side. No one saw what Ye Wusheng did, but all of them suddenly vanished into thin air.0

Everyone had just reunited, but they had to separate again. Although they knew that Long Chen was fine, they were still sad.0

“Big Sister, we have to leave too. With primal chaos qi filling this world, our Undying Willow race’s altar can be activated. We need to advance to the World King realm there,” said Liu Ruyan to Chu Yao.0

Chu Yao nodded. Both Meng Qi and Chu Yao had tears in their eyes, feeling helpless. Long Chen had risked everything to secure this precious year for the human race. They couldn’t waste it.0

In the end, they tearfully left. Liu Ruyan led the Undying race’s experts away, and Meng Qi also helplessly bid farewell to Tang Wan-er, Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, and the others. She implored Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan to look after Long Chen before leaving with Cloud.0

“Brothers, let us meet again. First, I’m going to settle things with that old ghost. I’ll force him to hand over his top techniques. Just wait, next time I’m back, it will be the return of the king! The four seas will submit! I won’t let Long Chen stand out by himself!” Mo Nian also swiftly left.2

Just then, a thunderous shout rang out.0

“Wilde, it’s time to return home and eat meat!”0

“No! I’m not leaving! I want to be with Brother Long!” Wilde immediately shouted back.0

Another group of giants had appeared in the distance, their heaven-shaking Blood Qi suffocating everyone present. Every single one of their steps made the world shake.0

“Wilde, be obedient. Once you mature, it will be time for us to marry and have children!”4

A gentle, affectionate voice rang out. As Guo Ran and the others traced the voice's origin, their jaws fell open in astonishment.0

“God damn!”
