Chapter 3574

When this dragon cry rang out, all the devil beasts quivered and froze. It was like they had become fools.

The dragon cry resounded throughout heaven and earth, like thunder exploding in people’s minds. Let alone the devil beasts, even Tu Hu and the others froze for a moment, their heads blank. They temporarily lost their minds.

Golden flames burned around Long Chen. Within those flames was a golden dragon coiling around him. It was just like an ancient dragon god had descended, a dragon god whose divine might made all ten thousand beasts submit.

This was Long Chen’s first time igniting his essence blood to activate his dragon might. Seeing that the devil beasts were frozen, Long Chen shouted, “Attack!”

His voice drew everyone out of their stupor, and they quickly took out their crossbows, unleashing sharp arrows aimed right at the vitals of those late stage World King devil beasts.

Arrows shot through their eyes, noses, ears, and other places where their defenses were weakest.

During normal times, those devil beasts would use divine abilities to cover up those weaknesses. But today, under the dragon might, they were in a sluggish state and unable to defend themselves. Thus, those arrows pierced right into them.

Those arrows then all exploded. After stabbing into their heads, the explosions most certainly took their lives, even if they were late stage World King devil beasts.

Countless devil beasts fell to the ground without even a grunt. After a wave of arrows, tens of thousands of them were slain.

These were the elites of the devil beasts’ army. With their elites dead, the entire army became like a tiger with no fangs, an eagle with no claws. They were no longer any threat.

“Kill!”

At this moment, hundreds of thousands of experts within Clear Rain City attacked. Hundreds of battleships came out. Without the threat of the late stage World King devil beasts, their battleships could freely slaughter these devil beasts.

Those devil beasts only woke up from the effect of the dragon might at this time. It was like they had woken up from a nightmare to see another nightmare. All their leaders were dead, so they panicked and began to flee in every direction.

Before fleeing, they were in the proper rank and file that the Luo clan had told them to get into. Now that they fled, they were like headless flies randomly crashing into each other.

With their giant bodies, they repeatedly crashed into each other in the narrow space, not even knowing which direction to go anymore. Quite a few of them actually ended up running toward Clear River City.

Tu Hu and the others then led the army to slaughter them. The devil beasts had lost their commanders and were in a chaotic state. In just a moment, corpses filled the ground.

Long Chen retracted his dragon might with a smile. This was his first time since coming to the immortal world that he used his dragon might to beat his enemies.

This dragon might had always been a rather useless ability. Against higher intelligence beasts, it didn’t have much effect. Against brainless beasts, especially insects and other strange beasts, the dragon might had almost no effect at all.

It was only against those beasts that weren’t too intelligent and weren’t too dumb that its maximum potential could be seen.

However, Long Chen wasn’t a true dragon. Only by igniting his dragon blood could he unleash the full-power dragon might. Today, Long Chen had finally tasted this power, and its effect was even better than he had imagined.

Even late stage World King devil beasts were unable to recover from the effects of the dragon might within half a breath’s time. In that moment, they lost any ability to move or defend. Half a breath’s time was more than enough to decide life and death.

Battleships weaved through the battlefield, and countless armored experts slaughtered their enemies, displaying shocking killing power. Their armors contained killing moves in every single spot. They could unleash astonishing power with their armors on.

It was a magnificent sight. This battle only lasted half an incense stick’s worth of time before coming to an end. Other than a small number of devil beasts fleeing in the chaos, the rest were all slain.

It went without saying that the Alldevil Star-Field’s experts were very familiar with the weaknesses of the devil beasts. They were always launching mortal blows with high efficiency.

Furthermore, there were people specialized in cleaning up the battlefield. With the battle over and the battlefield cleaned up, the speed at which things concluded truly made people click their tongues in amazement.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you really are amazing. So senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran really was telling the truth. You are a truly unrivaled existence.” Once they were back in the city, Tu Hu and the others looked worshipfully at Long Chen.

This unbeatable battle to them was easily settled by Long Chen. Furthermore, they didn’t lose a single fighter. Even now when they looked outside of Clear Rain City and didn’t see a sign of that devil beast army, they couldn’t quite believe it. It still felt like they were dreaming.

Tu Hu was one of Guo Ran’s worshippers. It could be said that he prostrated himself toward Guo Ran in worship. But every time, Guo Ran would say that his boss was the real heavenly genius of the world and that he couldn’t even reach a tenth of his boss’s glory. At that time, Tu Hu and the others hadn’t quite believed it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the dragon might that Long Chen displayed this time had completely suppressed the army of late stage World King devil beasts. That gave the human experts time to completely wipe out their elites. As the battle was won in less than an incense stick’s worth of time, they finally understood that Guo Ran had not been exaggerating.

At the same time, they understood that perhaps only an expert like Long Chen could make a heavenly genius like Guo Ran call him boss.

Now, when they looked at Long Chen, it was like they were looking at a god. Even the city lord, a late stage World King, was full of gratitude toward him.

After the devil beasts surrounding the city were killed, it was like the entire world had brightened. A heavy weight fell off of their hearts. That moving feeling simply could not be expressed with words.

“There are no words that can express my gratitude. Everyone in the Clear Rain City will forever remember this favor,” promised the city lord.

Long Chen smiled. “You’re too courteous. As fellow members of the human race, we naturally must be united against our enemies. Speaking of which, I have a presumptuous request. Those devil beasts…”

The city lord clapped his forehead and apologetically said, “I’m sorry, I completely forgot about this matter. I’ve dealt with the devil beasts’ corpses. Those are your battle spoils-”

Long Chen hastily waved his hand. “No, no, you misunderstand. I don’t need anything from the devil beasts other than their flesh and blood. Once you’ve split up those devil beasts, if you don’t need the flesh and blood, help me gather them. Don’t throw them away.”

“How can we do that? These are all your battle spoils. You saved us from a crisis. If we take your battle spoils, won’t others mock us?” said the city lord. The people that had been in charge of cleaning up the battlefield also came forward now.

“Everything else really is useless for me. I just want their flesh and blood. I’ll ask seniors to help me deal with it. I’ll come back for it later. Other than that, Clear Rain City cannot be careless. The other side might very well return. Prepare your defenses,” said Long Chen. He then turned to Tu Hu. “Brother Tu Hu, let’s go. Bring me to the illustrious and famous Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.”

“Alright!”

Tu Hu was delighted and invited Long Chen onto a battleship. In front of Clear Rain City’s countless experts, they flew off.
