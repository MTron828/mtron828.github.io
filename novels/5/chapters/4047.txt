Chapter 4036 Exploding Killing Intent

“I really am shocked that you could kill Liao Bencang. Unfortunately, you are unable to escape Hall Master Enpuda’s plot.” Dongfang Zichu shook his head at Long Chen.

“What?!” Both friends and foes stared in shock. Long Chen had killed Liao Bencang? The master of the Nine Underworld Hall, that Liao Bencang? He was an absolutely terrifying expert. Even though his realm was only at the peak of the World King realm, only a few three-flower Earth Venerates were a match for him.

Just defeating him alone was as difficult as ascending the heavens. As for actually killing him? No, they couldn’t believe their ears.

Long Chen didn’t reply. In his fury, he no longer wished to speak. Instead, he was silently accumulating power and recovering.

Long Chen had killed Liao Bencang, but the one to make sure that he stayed dead was Enpuda, or perhaps it should be more appropriate to say that it was Enpuda and Dongfang Zichu.

It was very clear that this plan was Enpuda and Dongfang Zichu’s arrangement. Also, they were pushing the blame of Liao Bencang’s death on Long Chen by saying this.

However, Long Chen didn’t mind as he didn’t bother quibbling. He also knew that Enpuda and Dongfang Zichu were not attacking yet because they were waiting for the two gates to open.

It just happened that Long Chen also needed to wait for his energy to recover. Time was favorable to him, but it was also favorable to his enemies.

While waiting, Long Chen’s murderous gaze was locked onto Dongfang Zichu, and the latter actually felt a slight chill from it.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, he still indifferently said, “Originally, I felt that making such a huge plan was making a mountain out of a molehill. However, it seems that the one to understand you the best is Hall Master Enpuda. By killing Liao Bencang, you ruined the equilibrium of the Netherworld’s gate. As a result, all that energy was absorbed by the hell gate here. You have quickened the opening of the hell gate. When this gate opens, my beloved disciple will forever leave this world. Just thinking about it hurts my heart. After all, I was the one who raised Qingxuan-”

“Shut your fucking mouth!”

Long Chen unleashed a heaven-shaking roar. It was evident that Dongfang Zichu purposely brought up Yu Qingxuan to provoke him. In an instant, Long Chen's demeanor shifted, resembling that of a wild and untamed beast

“Hahaha, there’s no need to be so angry. Do you know? Qingxuan’s life was destined to be bitter. When she was born, she carried the rune of the flower of hell on the sole of her foot. Do you know what that means? I’ll tell you. It is the mark of the Nether Emperor’s woman. Do you know who the Nether Emperor is? That is a supreme existence of the Netherworld. In front of him, we aren’t even ants. At most, we can be considered specks of dust. I cultivate the Blazing Heaven Art, and I can seal the hell flower. While it wouldn’t be sealed completely, it would extend the time required for the hell flower to bloom. When His Majesty Yu Xiaoyun came to find me, he promised me many benefits, including a drop of incomparably precious immemorial Vermilion Bird essence blood. But no matter how precious that essence blood was, it cannot compare to the benefits that Master Yan Xu promised me. As a result, I accepted his gifts, as well as Master Yan Xu’s promise. But I didn’t act according to the agreement. I didn’t seal the hell flower and used its characteristics to help her cultivate faster, raising her realm, gathering all kinds of flame energy to awaken her core flame, and letting her obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame as quickly as possible. That way, I could complete my mission this fast,” explained Dongfang Zichu casually.

“Dongfang Zichu, you petty little person!” roared Yu Xiaoyun furiously.

“Petty little person? I suppose. In the cultivation world, who doesn’t exist for profit? In the Heavenly Flame World, my mission should have been complete. However, Long Chen appeared midway and killed Yan Hong. Back then, I had no way to contact Master Yan Xu. I then waited and waited, and just a month ago, I received word that I could hand Qingxuan over. At this time, Hall Master Enpuda found me and told me about the situation in the Vermilion Bird Empire. Then we came up with such a plan. Just like Hall Master Enpuda, I like to be sure and prepared for my affairs. Last time, although it was an unexpected accident, Master Yan Xu was definitely unhappy with it. Therefore, this time, I opened the Yan Xu Gate here, and you are present as well. All enmities and grudges can be settled now. That way, master Yan Xu’s rage won’t be cast on me. It really is a double win,” said Dongfang Zichu with a smile.

“Master, I always viewed you just like a father. I memorized all your teachings. Can you tell me that this is all a lie, that this world isn’t so cruel?” Yu Qingxuan suddenly looked at Dongfang Zichu beseechingly.

In Yu Qingxuan’s heart, Dongfang Zichu was a kind and gentle master, always treating her well and looking after her. Because her mother and father weren’t by her side, she had viewed him as her father.

However, today, this respected master of hers had become a devil who lied about everything to her. He used her, offering her to Yan Xu. She felt like she had suddenly descended into a nightmare. Her face was streaked with tears. It appeared incredibly pitiable, incredibly powerless.

Just looking at her crying like that cut Long Chen’s heart in pieces. He knew that in this world, the most painful thing was not the pain of the physical body, nor was it the pain of the soul. It was the pain of betrayal, especially the betrayal of the person that you trusted the most. It was enough to make people wish to die.

Long Chen clenched his teeth so hard that they creaked. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to share the burden of Yu Qingxuan’s pain. Thus, Long Chen’s hatred for Dongfang Zichu deepened.

Showing no hint of guilt, Dongfang Zichu disdainfully smiled. “As master and disciple, I’ll give you another lesson: if you are tricked, it only means that you are foolish. Other than that, crying is the display of the foolish and weak. Emotions are the most useless things in this world. If you want to get stronger, you have to use any means necessary, and you have to stop at nothing. From the day that your father and mother sent you to me, you already became my stepping stone to higher realms-”

“That’s enough!” Long Chen roared, interrupting Dongfang Zichu. “The reason people are better than animals is because they have emotions. Someone as foolish as you is a sect master? You have the face to give teachings when you are so shameless? Can it be that when your father and mother birthed you, it was just for copulation? Is that why they birthed such a cold-blooded snake?”

However, Dongfang Zichu didn’t get angry at all. He still smiled. “Keep cursing me if you please. You won’t get another chance to in a bit. You have already died, so I have no anger for you, only sympathy.”

“Sympathy? No, I will teach you what fear is, what the price of harming my woman is!”

Long Chen turned to the tear-streaked Yu Qingxuan and gently wiped away those tears. “Don’t worry. Even if this world betrays you, I am still here. I am willing to fight this entire world for you.”

Dongfang Zichu sneered, indifferently saying, “When a man is about to die, they talk softly. When a bird is about to die, they cry out mournfully-”

“You are the one about to die, but so what?” Long Chen suddenly let go of Yu Qingxuan and walked toward Dongfang Zichu. Every step he took caused the void to quiver. As golden dragon scales slowly appeared on his body, his aura crazily grew.

In an awe-inspiring display, a majestic dragon's roar resounded throughout heaven and earth. Long Chen's hand then reached back to grasp the hilt of his saber, exuding a terrifying killing intent that made even the heavens tremble in fear.

“Dongfang Zichu, today, either you die or I die.”

In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Chen shot toward Dongfang Zichu like a grim reaper.
