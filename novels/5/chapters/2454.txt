Chapter 2444 Violent Lightning Devours the Heavens

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen’s heart thumped. Considering the distance, he knew that even at full speed, it would take six hours for him to reach the location of the distress signal. However, the map had shown him a giant spatial crack on the way, requiring him to go around it. That would add another two hours at least.

This urgent distress signal meant that everything was hanging by a thread. There was no time.

“Great prophet, my friends are in trouble. I must leave.” Long Chen started off, lightning wings appearing on his back.

“Where do you want to go? Perhaps I can use the power of the Spirit God to send you on your way,” said the prophet upon seeing his rush.

Delighted, Long Chen spread his hand, causing his Spiritual Strength to condense into a translucent map. “I want to go there.”

Long Chen pointed. He could only give a general location, as Guo Ran and Xia Chen had sacrificed some precision in order for the compass to sense even further.

“No problem.” The prophet smiled. A leaf fell from the sky and enveloped Long Chen. He vanished.

After Long Chen was gone, the prophet turned solemn. He shouted to the Luo Spirit race’s experts, ”Gather everyone and prepare for battle. Our chance to reclaim the mother tree has finally arrived!”

The Luo Spirit race’s disciples let out a heaven-shaking cheer, a raging battle intent soaring out of them. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

…

The leaf on Long Chen’s body crumbled, and he flew out, finding himself on top of a large mountain.

Taking out the compass, he shot out in the direction it indicated. In just a few seconds, he heard rumbling ahead. After going around a final mountain, he saw tens of thousands of people fighting.

A squad of the Dragonblood warriors was currently leading the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples in a battle against the ancient family alliance and the Corrupt path’s experts.

The Dragonblood warriors attempted to charge out of their encirclement with the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples, but they were unable to get through. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples were occasionally cut down one by one.

“Bastards, come at me if you have the guts!” roared one of the squad leaders of the Dragonblood Legion. Their enemies were intentionally avoiding the Dragonblood warriors to kill the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples. They did their best to avoid fighting them directly.

The Martial Heaven Alliance’s side was at an instant disadvantage considering the numbers advantage their enemies had. In just the first clash, thousands of them had died.

The first loss fractured their morale, and the Dragonblood warriors were unable to recover.

Once the rest of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples were killed, the Dragonblood warriors would be surrounded by a hundred thousand people and ground down.

“Ancient family alliance, you really have big guts.”

Just at this moment, a cold voice rang out that made the ancient family alliance and the Corrupt path’s disciples feel like they had been dropped into an icehouse.

“It’s boss!” The Dragonblood warriors were all ecstatic to hear that voice.

“Endless Lightning Domain, Violent Lightning Devours the Heavens!”

Long Chen clapped his hands together, and a sea of lightning spread throughout the battlefield, completely sealing it. This place became a lightning hell filled with the air of annihilation.

“Kill them all!” shouted Long Chen. After setting up the lightning domain, he personally joined the fray with Evilmoon in hand.

“Run! Long Chen’s here!” The Corrupt path and the ancient family alliance’s experts began to flee.

However, Long Chen’s rage meant that they didn’t have the slightest chance to escape. When they tried to flee through the lightning domain, they were annihilated.

That wasn’t enough to quench his fury. He was personally hacking them apart with his saber, with no one being able to stop him.

If it was just the Corrupt path attacking, he wouldn’t be so furious. After all, they were fated enemies. Such a thing could not be avoided.

However, the ancient family alliance had no excuse to attack them. Even if they were no longer allies, they should not be killing each other with the dark era descending.

Long Chen’s grievance was with Di Feng, and it was a personal one. He had not taken out his anger on the ancient family alliance. But the ancient family alliance had not just attacked the Martial Heaven Alliance now, they had even joined forces with the Corrupt path.

The biggest slap in Long Chen’s face was that he had told his side not to take out their anger on the ancient family alliance just because of him. As long as the other side didn’t press them, then they shouldn’t provoke them.

As a result, it was the ancient family alliance’s people that first attacked them, and in an incredibly vicious manner without the slightest hint of mercy.

This lightning domain had completely locked down this area. Lei Long was standing guard within it with tens of thousands of split bodies. No one could escape.

As for Long Chen himself, he was like a tiger trapped with a group of sheep. Even screams of terror could not stop his blade.

With Long Chen’s addition to the battlefield, the ancient family alliance and the Corrupt path’s disciples were terrified out of their minds. With the arrival of a devil king, they sank into profound despair.

They hadn’t expected Long Chen to arrive so quickly. Their minds were blank, as they all knew that no one could save them.

As for the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side, they were reinvigorated and pounced on their enemies.

“No!”

“AH!”

“Don’t kill me! We’re innocent! We had to listen to orders-!”

“I’ll tell you what’s happening! There are-”

No matter what they said, the ancient family alliance and the Corrupt path’s experts were cut down without hesitation.

The Corrupt path’s experts crazily fought back, but their fierce faces were a facade to cover up the terror in their hearts.

With Long Chen present, the Dragonblood warriors were free to fight as they wished. Fighting for themselves, their enemies fell in swathes.

As for the ancient family alliance’s experts, they weren’t as bloody as the Corrupt path. As they fought back, they pleaded for mercy.

“Idiots! Did you ever think about letting us off? Did you think about our families? Die!”

The only reply to their pleading was a butcher’s blade filled with anger. The battlefield was in chaos now, with everyone trying to avoid Long Chen, but still being unable to escape. Some who were further away from him thought that they would be temporarily safe, only for a lightning arrow to pierce them from behind.

The people fleeing had been killed, and no one else was trying. Lei Long had nothing else to do but to attack. It didn’t want to injure any allies, so it only attacked those who were close to the edges.

“Hahaha, what’s so amazing about you, Long Chen?! I really look down on you! Can you kill me twice?” One of the ancient family alliance’s disciples laughed crazily. It seemed that he had gone insane. Without any hope, he began to publicly provoke Long Chen.

His laughter didn’t manage to draw Long Chen’s attention before he was killed by one of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples.

“You want to kill me? Keep dreaming! You’ll never be able to achieve that in your lifetimes! I curse you all to die here!” Another one of the ancient family alliance’s disciples suddenly chose to kill himself.

The ancient family alliance’s disciples were the first to be eliminated. Now, only thousands of the Corrupt experts were left. Although knowing that they were going to die, they wanted to drag down a few more of their enemies with them.

In order to avoid unnecessary deaths, Long Chen ordered the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples to retreat to the edge of the lightning domain. The five hundred Dragonblood warriors were cleaning up the survivors.

There was no suspense. The Dragonblood warriors formed a killing formation and slaughtered them.

The Corrupt experts were unwilling to be killed for nothing, and they tried to charge past to the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples.

However, before they could reach them, they were killed by lightning arrows. In just a few breaths’ time, the remaining Corrupt experts were slaughtered. This battle ended without a single fish managing to escape the net.

This battle had been extremely fierce, and the Corrupt path experts in particular had been vicious. The Martial Heaven Alliance had lost thirteen thousand disciples. If Long Chen hadn’t arrived in time, they would have been wiped out.

Although the Dragonblood warriors might have managed to band together in the end and charge out, as the leader of this group, having all their comrades be killed while they escaped by themselves would have been a stain that they would never be able to wash away.

Even after victory, the Dragonblood warriors weren’t happy. They still felt immense hatred and guilt.

“Sorry, boss. We were suddenly attacked with no warning,” said the leader of this group. They had been entrusted by Long Chen to protect everyone.

Long Chen shook his head and patted the squad leader’s shoulder comfortingly. “It’s not your fault.”

Long Chen turned back to the surviving disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance. His gaze swept through them coldly.

“You can come out and kill yourself. I will protect your family in your stead.”
