Chapter 4654 Six Daos Heavenly Eye

“Boss, what am I supposed to do?!”

Bai Xiaole’s head was blank. Long Chen said that he was the only one who could save everyone, but he was filled with too much fear to think of anything.

“You really are a fool. How did I end up with someone like you?” Just then, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s voice rang out in Bai Xiaole’s mind.

The next moment, the image of a fox appeared behind Bai Xiaole, its violet pupils flickering with a demonic light and its nine tails burning like flames. It was as if the world twisted around its tails.

“No inside, no outside; no self, no other—Six Daos Heavenly Eye!”

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox roared and clapped its hands together, while Bai Xiaole simultaneously formed hand seals alongside it. In perfect synchrony, man and beast shouted in unison as six petals manifested within their eyes.

This was the specific mark of the Six Daos Heavenly Eye. As they invoked this divine ability, Bai Xiaole's pupils transformed into a purple hue, while the eyes of the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox shifted into a combination of black, white, and violet. Together, their gazes converged and overlapped, symbolizing the fusion of their powers.

“Heavenly Mirror!” the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox shouted. Following that, Bai Xiaole’s hand seals changed, and a giant mirror appeared in the sky.

The mirror covered the very heavens, but it was as thin as a cicada’s wing with six marks on top of it.

It looked unbearably fragile, like it would shatter with the slightest touch. Furthermore, it gave off no aura or pressure whatsoever. Witnessing Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox combine their efforts to produce such a thing, the others were worried. Could this fragile mirror possibly block the Sovereign clan expert’s peerless divine ability?

However, there was nothing they could do other than believe in Bai Xiaole. Watching this from a distance, Long Chen simply smiled.

BOOM!

The lightning sphere smashed into the mirror, crushing it. However, it also created a strange ripple.

“Shift!”

Just then, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox shouted and suddenly formed seals with its claws.

The Dragonblood warriors fighting the Sovereign clan expert felt a force pull them from the battle.

Following that, a shocking scene occurred. After going through the mirror, the enormous sphere shrank in size to that of a mere fist before being redirected back toward the Sovereign clan expert.

BOOM!

Upon impact, the lightning sphere detonated with an explosion of lightning runes resembling a star exploding. The overwhelming force threatened to rend the Dragonblood warriors asunder, sending them hurtling through the air, their bodies drenched in blood.

The Dragonblood warriors were stunned. The power of that attack was even greater than they had imagined. If it weren’t for Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox, there would no longer be a Dragonblood Legion after this attack.

“Absorb the lightning runes!”

After a moment of shock, everyone quickly reacted and started absorbing the lightning runes with all their might. This was the purest essence of the heavenly tribulation plus the will of the Sovereign clan expert. Hence, they quickly absorbed it before it could fade back into heaven and earth.

Just then, a dragon tail lashed through the air like a heavenly whip, giving the Dragonblood warriors no chance to breathe. However, just as it surged toward them, Yue Zifeng emerged, his hair and robes billowing in the turbulent wind.

“I walked through mountains of corpses and seas of blood, transcending the shackles of heaven and earth.

“From the mortal to the immortal, no one could halt my advance.

“From weak to strong, no obstacles could bar my path.

“In the realm of dust and ashes, across the sea of sorrow, through the nine heavens and ten lands, there is nothing I cannot cut. Say my name loud and clear! Wavecutter!”

BOOM!

Yue Zifeng’s attack actually severed the enormous dragon tail, shocking everyone. The severed tail then exploded, transforming into lightning runes.

This sword blow could indeed make ghosts sob and gods weep. Its impact left a huge crack in the very void, which lingered for a long time.

“Heavens!”

The onlookers almost died from shock when they saw that. This scene had far surpassed their understanding.

“Boss Zifeng, good job!” the Dragonblood warriors cheered excitedly. When Yue Zifeng severed the dragon tail, they clearly felt the aura of the heavenly tribulation plummet.

“Attack!”

The Dragonblood warriors were reinvigorated as they charged toward the tribulation clouds once again. They attacked the giant lightning dragon manifestation within it, devouring its lightning essence.

The Dragonblood warriors were indeed like ants in front of this enormous dragon. However, with unity and determination, they understood that even ants could topple an elephant given enough numbers.

The Dragonblood warriors ripped off the enormous dragon scales on its body, absorbing their energy. As the thunderforce surged through their veins, they sensed their dragon blood boiling within them. Their bodies were like furnaces, tirelessly refining the dragon blood with each passing moment. This was the only way to achieve a perfect merger with this blood.

The Dragonblood Legion relentlessly pressed on, leaving the dragon no opportunity to unleash its divine abilities. Whenever the dragon attempted to gather energy, Yue Zifeng swiftly launched an attack, disrupting its attempts without fail.

Although Yue Zifeng’s energy had mostly gone into that one blow, by cooperating with everyone, he could always interrupt the dragon’s divine abilities.

Bai Xiaole had just made a huge contribution but had no time to celebrate it. He was miserably acting like the Dragonblood warriors, tearing at the dragon scales. Perched on his shoulder, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox observed everything, serving as Bai Xiaole's silent witness to his actions—a form of punishment for Bai Xiaole.

Meanwhile, on the outer edges of the battlefield, countless lightning dragons roamed around. These were Lei Linger’s split bodies. She wasn’t going to fight with the Dragonblood warriors for the meat, but she didn’t want to let off any leftovers. After all, the lightning runes on the outer edges would vanish after some time. This kind of waste was unacceptable to Lei Linger.

As time wore on, finally, the dragon reached its limit and exploded. By this time, the Dragonblood warriors had reached a state of full satisfaction, unable to absorb any more energy.

Hence, Lei Linger completely devoured the final lightning runes, ending the tribulation. With its conclusion, the auras of the Dragonblood warriors suddenly grew explosively, reaching an unprecedented level before stabilizing.

An overwhelming power coursed through their veins. With a mere clench of their fists, they could feel the energy surging within them

“Hahaha, we’re finally Divine Venerates!”
