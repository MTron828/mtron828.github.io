Chapter 4735 Utmost Arrogance

“Call out your dean!”

Enraged people surrounded the gates of the High Firmament Academy, looking as if someone had just robbed their ancestral graves. They even seemed like they would start biting people in a bit.

“Sorry, but Dean Long Chen is busy. If you want to see him, you’ll have to make an appointment first. After going through an audit, we will make the arrangements if possible.”

By now, the guards had grown accustomed to such outbursts. Having experienced similar scenes multiple times, they could handle the rude guests with ease.

After all, their confidence had reached its peak after witnessing Long Chen’s prowess against the Lifehunter race experts. Thus, the absence of the higher-ups didn’t faze them at all. From top to bottom, the High Firmament Academy was really thriving.

With the senior generation having laid the foundation, it was now up to the juniors to take on more responsibilities. Most of the crucial tasks within the academy were now entrusted to the younger generation.

A breath of fresh air filled the entire academy. With a supreme expert like Long Chen at its helm, the High Firmament Academy was more confident than ever.

Even in the face of the crowd gathered at the gates, the academy refused to cower. They held their ground even against Sage Kings, insisting that they had to follow the rules.

In the past, such a thing would have been unthinkable. However, under Long Chen's leadership, the disciples of the academy were brimming with pride and confidence.

Before this, the academy’s seniors had always been in charge of receiving visitors. With age often came wisdom and stability, and they weren’t so easily angered. However, after dealing with the Long clan’s people, Long Chen felt the need to keep up with the times, so he replaced the seniors with the juniors.

Long Chen directly announced that the High Firmament Academy would treat its guests well if they were good guests. Otherwise, there was no need to give them any face. The bad guests would be directly told to leave, and if they refused to leave, someone would make them.

As these unwelcome guests tried to stir up trouble, the disciples tasked with handling them remained calm. In fact, they actually felt a bit of sympathy for these troublemakers, knowing that their arrogance would soon lead to their downfall. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What are your intentions?! Hiding away and refusing to show your face?! You cause chaos and then pretend to be innocent?!” bellowed a Sage King in frustration.

Just the day before, Long Chen’s conversation with the young disciples had spread throughout the world. As a result, many factions instantly calmed down, feeling like he was right, and they could decide once the ninth heaven opened.

They now realized they couldn’t just believe what these recruiters were intentionally showing them; they had to see things for themselves. Other than that, Long Chen had also said that the High Firmament Academy had a domain in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Should they find themselves without a place in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, they could seek refuge in the academy until they secured a position elsewhere. They didn’t need to worry about the other factions devouring them or being attacked by devil creatures.

Long Chen’s promise was taken as gospel. Even without his status as the High Firmament Academy’s dean, his name alone was a golden signboard.

As a result, countless factions started to look at the recruiters with a sense of detachment, showing no urgency in their decision-making. This incensed the recruiters who had laid the groundwork for recruitment. Just as they were about to reap the harvests, Long Chen smashed everything apart, so how could they not hold a grudge against him?

“There’s no need to talk so loudly. After all, we’re all youngsters. Our ears still work. We’d hear you if you spoke at a normal volume. Our dean has asked you to talk more calmly instead of being so emotional. Shouting and roaring only shows that you lack upbringing. Others would laugh at you,” answered a disciple indifferently.

“You... you little brat, you dare to act arrogant here?!” That Sage King almost fainted from rage. How could a little disciple dare to mock him like this?

“Sir’s words are lacking. Dean Long Chen has said that the academy belongs to every single one of us, and there is no difference in status between us. Whether it is the dean or the part-time workers, we all have the same status and are working together to create a cultured and civilized environment of peace. As a Sage King, you’ve lived for countless years, but in this regard, you cannot compare to us little brats, let alone our dean. With this level of magnanimity and vision, how can you face Dean Long Chen? You’ll just suffer. I’m not trying to insult you, but are you actually a masochist?” explained that disciple indifferently.

It went without saying that the people Long Chen had picked out to receive guests were good at their job. This disciple might not be strong, but his tongue was sharp, capable of cursing people without a single curse word. Hearing his explanation, this Sage King couldn’t retort at all.

“You’re courting death!” However, the elder’s embarrassment quickly turned into rage.

Just as he was about to attack, the disciple fearlessly said, “I’d advise you not to attack me. Although I’d definitely die, our dean will definitely take your life as revenge. It’ll be a life for a life. If I can use my life to drag down a lofty Sage King, no matter how you look at it, I’m profiting. However, I have a different opinion. I’m only thirty-seven this year. I’m a strapping young man, and following Dean Long Chen means that my future is limitless. As for you, you’re an old fogey at the end of his years. I feel like I’ll be losing out if I have to die with you, so I don’t want to. I think that you don’t want to die either, so don’t be so emotional. Think it through before you act.”

“You...”

The Sage King was quivering with rage. He almost attacked this disciple, but of course he only wanted to scare this brat. As long as the disciple ran off in fright, this matter would be over, and the Sage King would regain some face.

However, he was now caught between a rock and a hard place. If he didn’t attack, it would show that he was afraid. But if he did attack, well, he really didn’t dare to kill this disciple.

Many experts gathered here to speak to Long Chen about this matter, and now the elder regretted standing out amongst them. If he had known this would happen, he would have hidden in the back.

Nevertheless, he knew it was too late to back down. Observing the disciple’s indifferent expression, he sensed a silent smirk lurking behind it, and it stoked his anger even further. His hand moved instinctively toward the disciple’s throat.

In that instant, he had a revelation. He didn't necessarily have to kill this disciple; a lesson would suffice to preserve his dignity.

Just as he attacked, the disciple finally revealed a hint of panic. Facing a Sage King, it would be dishonest to claim he wasn't nervous. After all, he had only one life, and once lost, it was gone forever. He immediately turned to flee.

However, he found the space twisting around him, pulling him toward the Sage King. The power disparity was too immense, and he didn’t even have a chance to run.

“Old fogey, you’ll regret it!” roared the disciple.

The other disciples of the academy took out their weapons, but they found their attacks futile against this elder’s protective divine light.

Just as the elder’s hand was about to grab the disciple’s throat, Sword Qi shot out, piercing through his protective divine light and cutting his hand. Blood spurted forth in a violent spray.
