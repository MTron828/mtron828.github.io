Chapter 4791 Strange Woman

Everyone looked over and saw a white-robed woman in the distance. She wore a white headscarf but left her arms bare, while her feet bore bloodstains from the rubble and thorns on the ground.

With her skin that was as white as jade, her eyes that were reminiscent of peach blossoms, and the immortal qi swirling around her, she seemed like a fairy walking out of the depths of an ancient forest.

Her cultivation base was completely hidden. Though surrounded by immortal qi, she didn’t seem like someone who knew about cultivation. Every step she took on the rocky ground revealed cuts on her skin, causing her feet to tremble with each movement. It was clear that she was suffering.

However, even through that pain, she was still smiling. She was like a holy mirror that made everyone feel ashamed of their flaws. Her beauty was simply holy. Even for Long Chen, it was his first time seeing such a person.

“This woman is rather odd. I can’t see through her cultivation base,” said Long Zhantian.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Even his father was unable to see through her cultivation base? That was absolutely shocking, but whatever her identity was, her words irritated him.

“It seems that you don’t know me. I am not a businessman who’s willing to haggle,” answered Long Chen.

Guo Ran and the others couldn’t turn their eyes away from her, and even Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan were staring at her in shock.

The woman pleaded for mercy for the people, yet she clearly had just arrived and had no idea who was in the right or wrong, who was the good person and who was the bad person. This lack of discernment drew their dislike.

However, for some reason, no one was able to feel angry toward her. They even felt that going against her was a kind of blasphemy. Hence, the moment Long Chen spoke to her in that tone, everyone somehow felt like he was going too far.

Long Chen had always been resolute in his decisions, but there seemed to be a subtle shift in his demeanor because of this woman. If she had some kind of special ability to change people’s minds, that really would be terrifying.

Undeterred by Long Chen's demeanor, the woman continued to smile. Her smile seemed capable of dispelling all worries and vexations in the world. Long Chen's heart quivered, inexplicably affected by her smile. It was as if he had fallen under a spell, lost in its enchantment.

He hastily focused himself, maintaining his composure, yet some kind of emotion was brewing deep within his soul.

This woman looked at Long Chen deeply. “I know you aren’t a businessman. You neither like haggling nor interested in considering any pros and cons I might tell you. You are someone who likes to repay kindness, as well as enmity...”

Every word she spoke flowed like gentle water, captivating the experts around. Regardless of their status or cultivation level, they were all drawn to her voice, longing to hear more of her enchanting words.

However, Long Chen waved his hand dismissively and interrupted her. “Stop. I’m not interested in what you’re saying. These people wanted my life. Showing them mercy is already more than what they deserve. I want them to kowtow and learn from their mistakes, serving as a warning to others who dare to attack me without cause. These foolish idiots must be taught that I am not prey—I have fangs.”

The woman nodded. “I understand. That is entirely reasonable. Normally, I wouldn’t interfere. However, I bear a great responsibility, so I have no choice but to lower my own status. If you can understand my predicament, I would be endlessly grateful.”

After saying that, she directly knelt down. Long Chen immediately waved his hand, causing a powerful force to wrap around her to force her to stop.

However, he was shocked to find his power simply vanished upon contact with her, like a clay ox falling into the ocean.

The woman kowtowed in front of Long Chen, and he could only watch as she did so. Her action fueled his rage, causing his expression to darken.

“Are you threatening me? If I empathize with you, who will empathize with me? Just to enter the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, I have to deal with countless people trying to kill me. Did they show any empathy toward me?!” Long Chen's voice thundered, resonating like a tempest shaking the world.

Feeling Long Chen’s rage, the woman looked ashamed and bowed toward Long Chen again.

She softly said, “Sorry.”

“Sorry?! If one sorry could make my dead brothers from the Martial Heaven Continent come back to life, I’ll kowtow to you ten thousand times! No, I’ll kowtow to you for a lifetime! How’s that?!” Long Chen’s voice quivered when thinking of his fallen brothers.

The final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent had been a ferocious slaughter where reason and logic held no sway. Why hadn’t this woman intervened then?

Long Chen’s face contorted, looking like a wounded wild beast. The woman looked at him with no fear and anger, only profound pity and sympathy. A tear trickled down her cheek.

“I’m sorry to have offended you,” she murmured softly, bowing deeply to Long Chen before turning to depart. One tear after another slid down her cheek, landing on the ground. She seemed to be suffering to the point that she couldn’t back her tears.

As she walked away, her footsteps left a trail of blood and tears. Everyone watched in silence, witnessing her solitary departure, her figure appearing so lonely, so pitiful.

Long Chen stared at her, his thoughts scattered. For some reason, when she started crying, it felt as though his own resentment and hatred were being released. In an instant, his turbulent emotions subsided. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Dean Long Chen, the truth is that we...”

Just then, someone tried to speak. If he really refused, they would kowtow to him. After all, staying alive was more important, but they wanted to see Long Chen’s response first.

Long Chen’s response was a single cold word.

“Scram!”

Hearing it, these people immediately flew off. Long Chen took a deep breath and looked at his father with a bitter smile. “Looks like I lost in the end.”

Although Long Chen disliked this woman’s actions, she had won. He really had no way to make things hard on these people.

“It’s not embarrassing to lose to her,” replied Long Zhantian with a slight smile.

“Dad, what did you notice about her?” asked Long Chen in surprise.
