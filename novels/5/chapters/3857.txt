Chapter 3846 Superficial

Long Aotian was sent flying by a slap from Long Chen. But just as he was about to crash into the bronze cauldron, his hair stood on end. A terrifying sensation of death filled his heart.

Long Aotian was stunned by this feeling. Ever since the Long clan’s patriarchs awakened his Spirit Blood, he had never felt such a terrifying threat. His intuition told him that if he struck this cauldron, he would without a doubt die.

Before this, he had only been focused on Long Chen, so he hadn’t been paying attention to this bronze cauldron. Only now did he realize that it was something extraordinary.

Vines twisted in the air, forming a net in front of the cauldron and Long Aotian crashed into it. The net only quivered, and he bounced off.

“Flame energy, Vermilion Bird Dance!” Being slapped by Long Chen, Long Aotian was enraged. When the totem of the Vermilion Bird appeared on his fist, flames rose. The bird cry of the immemorial Vermilion Bird could vaguely be heard stretching to the present from eons ago. That sound could pierce clouds and shatter rocks. It directly penetrated people to their souls.

“So what if you have the power of the five elements? I only need one power to break it. No matter how strong the seven-color Supreme Blood is, it doesn’t belong to you. Even if you do your utmost, how much can you control? Even though you stole my Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, you were still defeated and will continue to be defeated by me.”

Seven stars flowed on top of Long Chen’s fist. Long Chen felt carefree in a way that he had never felt before.

After comprehending this technique, it no longer felt like he had endless energy to use. Instead, it felt like he was capable of concentrating all of that energy into one spot and detonating it.

Long Chen didn’t retreat in the slightest against Long Aotian. It didn’t matter whether it was metal energy or flame energy. He would defeat it all with a single fist.

Flame runes danced, shooting out in every direction like a glorious firework. The light was dazzling, but it was accompanied by a terrifying heat that turned this world into a burning stove.

On the other hand, the power of Long Chen’s fist shook heaven and earth. This technique that he had learned from the nine star heirs showed Long Chen that if he wanted to use the full power of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he needed to use the accompanying Battle Skills.

Previously, he was like a beggar sitting on top of a mountain of gold. He had immense power but no way to unleash it all. But now, all of his power came bursting out of his fist. That feeling of being able to destroy even heaven and earth set his blood ablaze. His battle intent was erupting.

Long Aotian’s flame fist was blown apart. The clash of their fists was like two stars crashing together, and an aura of annihilation shook people’s hearts.

As astral winds raged, those coffins floating in the air were being affected by their power. They were beginning to shake. However, everyone was paying attention to the fight, and no one took note of some indescribable aura slowly leaking from the cracks in the coffins.

“Water energy, Black Tortoise Attack!”

“Wood energy, Azure Dragon Stab!”

“Earth energy, Qilin Explosion!”

Long Aotian’s fists repeatedly struck, and the runes on his fists repeatedly changed. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, all five elemental energies appeared. Every power was a peak law that could destroy the heavens.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, no matter what energy he used, Long Chen faced him with a single fist. The full power of the Seven Star Battle Armor was in his fist. Whatever force he met, he destroyed with a single fist.

At this moment, Long Chen realized that he had barely grasped the tiniest superficial hair of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s body. Before this, he couldn’t count as having grasped anything at all.

This relaxing feeling of having all of his power be unleashed as he pleased gave him unprecedented satisfaction. As time passed, he grew more and more familiar with this new technique. The somewhat shaky feeling gradually passed. Now, his movements were efficient and graceful.

Both of their fists and feet began to meet. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth energies raged, and every collision caused the world to shake. People felt like their insides were being compressed, as if a hand of the five elements was squeezing them, making them feel like they would vomit blood.

Long Chen and Long Aotian’s fight caused a giant space to become a zone of death. Spatial cracks filled this region. Let alone people, even divine items would probably be crushed if they entered this region.

People could only hide in the distance, pressing against the stone walls. They couldn’t retreat any further, but the suffocating astral winds felt like blades across their faces.

It had to be known that everyone here was a Supreme heavenly genius. Within their individual factions, they were the top experts, capable of looking down on all others in the same realm.

However, here, they were stunned to find that the battle between Long Chen and Long Aotian was something that they couldn’t get close to. If they tried to force their way through, they might be directly smashed apart by those astral winds before even getting close.

“Is the difference really so great?” One of the Sacred Pill Hall’s Supreme experts couldn’t help muttering to himself as he watched their intense fight.

They couldn’t help looking toward Yin Changsheng. They saw that he and the others were also staring at Long Chen and Long Aotian in shock.

“Boss really is the boss. He has never disappointed us. Hehe, our worries were for nothing.” Guo Ran had previously been nervous. Long Aotian’s power was truly terrifying. His power to control the five elements, with every single one of those elemental forces being at a level that could cause despair, caused Guo Ran to feel worried for Long Chen for the first time.

However, now watching Long Chen clearly suppress Long Aotian, Guo Ran was delighted. He wished for Long Chen to directly kill Long Aotian with a punch.

“Have you not noticed that Long Aotian’s five element energy is starting to grow more fluid? It was rusty at first, but now the speed at which he moves through them has increased a great deal. The spatial pressure has also increased,” said Xia Chen, still worried.

Hearing this, Guo Ran noticed a huge mass of cracks around every single one of Long Aotian’s attacks. Their range was greater than before.

“You mean he’s using boss as a sparring partner to get used to his new power?!” Guo Ran exclaimed.

Xia Chen nodded, his brow furrowed. Long Aotian was truly terrifying. Or perhaps it should be said that Long Chen’s seven-color Supreme Blood was what was terrifying.

Thinking of how this seven-color Supreme Blood should belong to Long Chen, Guo Ran and the others were incensed. If Long Chen hadn’t had his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone taken, just how lofty his position would he be in the immortal world?

“You don’t need to worry. Although Long Aotian is powerful, have you not noticed that Long Chen’s energy is also flowing more fluidly now? It’s not as stiff as at the beginning. Long Chen is in the midst of figuring out his new technique, and he is using Long Aotian as a training partner as well. In truth, neither of them is going all-out just yet. Mo Nian, do you agree?” Yue Xiaoqian looked at Mo Nian.

“Cough, most likely.” Mo Nian coughed a bit. In truth, his attention wasn’t on Long Chen and Long Aotian. He understood Long Chen’s power far too well.

“Mo Nian, what are you thinking?” Seeing his distracted appearance, Guo Ran couldn’t help asking.

“Shh.”

Mo Nian’s gaze roved around before landing on those coffins. He secretly transmitted, “Whatever is inside those coffins is priceless. While everyone’s attention is on Long Chen and Long Aotian, we must grab the coffins. Xia Chen, I just thought of a method. Let’s try it.”

Mo Nian silently took out a small black case. This case was shockingly a palm-sized coffin.
