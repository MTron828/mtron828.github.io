Chapter 2451 Death Substitute Talisman

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen had been waiting precisely for this moment. His goal wasn’t to defeat the Six Horn Sea Serpent but to kill him.

Although they might sound similar, there was an immense difference between them. Beating him required being just one level stronger. But killing him was much more difficult, because no one who was beaten would silently sit there waiting to die instead of fleeing.

In order to kill an expert on this level, Long Chen had to first exhaust all their trump cards and energy before an opportunity would present itself.

Now, that chance had come. Using the Celestial Lightning Body Blink, Long Chen appeared in front of him and unleashed a full-power slash.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent took out his tortoise shell once more. However, in its damaged state, it was no longer able to block Long Chen. It shattered.

Nonetheless, it still managed to win him a chance to breathe. He hastily retreated, trying to get between two squads of the Dragonblood warriors.

However, the Dragonblood warriors were prepared. They once more combined forces and attacked, their goal not being to kill him but merely to block him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Suddenly, the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s body transformed. He returned to his original form, that of a giant sea serpent.

Two rays of Sword Qi landed on his body, tearing through his defenses and leaving two giant wounds.

However, in his true form, those giant cuts were still acceptable. He charged through, unleashing a wave of power as he passed to knock the Dragonblood warriors back. With him putting everything on the line and using his full power, the Dragonblood warriors were unable to prevent him from getting past. But they did delay him.

In that instant, Long Chen caught up to him from behind, a giant saber-image condensing in the air.

“Long Chen, you’ll regret it if you kill me!” shouted the Six Horn Sea Serpent as he fled. Even in his true form, he wasn’t faster than Long Chen. Seeing Long Chen’s saber about to fall on him, he cried out, panicked.

Long Chen ignored him. Talking with such a brainless person was a waste of time. He continued to accumulate power, wanting to kill him with this final blow.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent had exhausted enough of his power for Long Chen to kill him. There was no way the former could maintain his peak form in this state.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Long Chen’s response to his threat was to slash down the attack that he had been condensing.

“Long Chen, you bastard!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent cried out furiously, his voice hoarse. It almost sounded like he was wailing.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent suddenly took out a strange bone. It was like a mountain and sparkled like jade, but it was also filled with a violent and bloodthirsty aura.

“Long Chen, you’ve made me use up my Six Horn Sea Serpent race’s divine bone. Just wait, I swear that I will avenge this enmity!” roared the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

Long Chen’s attack landed on the strange bone. He had expected it to be an incredibly tough shield, but he was confident in his attack. Unexpectedly though, the bone instantly exploded.

Evilmoon slashed through the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s body with almost no resistance at all.

Cheers started to ring out, but that cheering fell silent a moment later. No blood splashed. The Six Horn Sea Serpent’s aura also didn’t vanish.

“What?”

“A Death Substitution Talisman? I didn’t expect the sea demon race to possess such an object.” Long Chen narrowed his eyes.

This kind of Death Substitution Talisman wasn’t a divine talisman. It was more like witchcraft.

This kind of witchcraft had long since vanished from the Martial Heaven Continent. No one knew how to use these techniques. It was said it had been part of the human race’s techniques, and this talisman allowed them to control a puppet to take their place at a critical moment.

Such witchcraft was extremely mysterious. When the puppet died, the master would enter a temporary state of being in the void. In that state, they could not be attacked. It was as if in that moment, they were no longer part of the world or even time and space. It was inexplicable.

The instant that Long Chen’s attack shattered the bone, the Six Horn Sea Serpent had vanished from his lock.

Despite seeing him right there, he was no longer present. For a certain amount of time, Long Chen couldn’t touch him.

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder, looking at him without any sign of discouragement. Instead, he had a faint smile. “Ah, based on your painful expression, it seems that this Death Substitution Talisman is your final life preserving trump card? Ah, how regretful. Such a divine object is probably one of a kind. Another one will not be born in this world. Such a treasure could probably protect the user’s life even against an Emperor. Wow, you actually wasted such a thing on me.”

“Shut up!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent went crazy upon seeing Long Chen’s pitying expression. If he hadn’t taken out this bone, he would have died just now.

However, Long Chen’s guess was correct. This was the only Death Substitution Talisman amongst the sea demon race, and it had been passed down for an unknown number of generations.

The sea demon race had only allowed him to take it because he was entering the Star Field Divine World. This was a priceless treasure that could protect his life no matter what kind of terrifying opponent he ran into.

This treasure was something that would allow him to enter some dangerous areas in search of treasure. Even if things took a bad turn, he would still be able to protect his life. But now, that plan was ruined.

He had actually used this one of a kind treasure not on some supreme expert, but on someone within the same generation as him.

“Long Chen, you destroyed my tortoise shell and wasted my precious substitute bone. I’ll make you pay for this. I can’t kill you, but I can kill all the ants beneath you. Just wait!”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent began to fade away until he vanished without a trace.

Long Chen shook his head and sighed. In the end, he had failed to kill him.

Geniuses like the Six Horn Sea Serpent had the karmic luck of an entire race concentrated on them. They also had priceless treasures that made killing them extremely difficult. Despite knowing all this already, Long Chen couldn’t help being disappointed.

“It’s fine. I’ll use your snake skin to make some boots for myself. I refuse to believe you have another treasure like that.” Long Chen put away Evilmoon and calmed his emotions. Looking back at the battlefield, he saw that all the sea demons had fled.

“Boss, the sea demons had three hundred thousand experts here. We killed one hundred and seventy thousand. The rest fled. On our side, over ten thousand people died,” reported a Dragonblood warrior.

Long Chen nodded. To only lose ten thousand while killing one hundred and seventy thousand was an amazing combat achievement.

A portion of that was thanks to Lei Long. Lei Long was their bane and had greatly weakened them, not to mention lowering their morale.

There were now six squads gathered, five from the Martial Heaven Continent and one from the Xuan Beasts. That was a powerful force.

“Boss, that fellow escaped. The other groups are now probably in danger,” said one Dragonblood warrior. If one squad were to encounter him alone, they would probably be wiped out.

“This place isn’t the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, so it probably will take a while for him to recover. As long as we use this time to gather the squads so that each group has a captain level combatant, we’ll still be able to fight upon encountering someone like him. Let’s link our compasses and transmit the news. In the future, if you encounter any sea demons, don’t waste any words. If the situation is suitable, just directly kill them,” said Long Chen. They linked up six compasses, allowing them to reach even further.

“Boss, boss Guo Ran has reached back to us, asking if we want to meet up with him. He’s about half a day’s travel from us and has two squads,” reported a squad leader.

“That’s a good idea. If we’re so close, we can even pass a bit of the map to him. He can link up everyone and transmit the map bit by bit,” said Long Chen.

Guo Ran was with Xia Chen. The main goal right now was to pass the map to everyone.

Long Chen gave the orders, and everyone got to work. Transmitting all this information didn’t just require multiple compasses, but it also required the power of their dragon blood. Some of the Dragonblood warriors took charge of that, while the others cleaned up the battlefield.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, what do you want to do with these corpses?”

The Neidans within the sea demons were valuable, but the actual corpses weren’t so useful. But just tossing them aside would be wasteful.

“I’ll take the corpses.” Long Chen sent them into the primal chaos space. This meat was probably too low level for Wilde, and if he didn’t want them, he could use them as fertilizer.

An incense stick’s worth of time later, the work was done. They had also received word back from Guo Ran that they had received the map.

“Boss, let’s go. We found a potential treasure house. The sea demons came over here precisely for it,” said one of the Dragonblood warriors.
