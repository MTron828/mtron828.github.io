Chapter 3878 The Transformed Xia Chen

These newcomers all had a divine radiance shining behind their heads. At this moment, the might of the Heavenly Daos crashed down. They were all experts who had condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown.

Clearly, these experts had been in other treasure lands. After condensing Heavenly Dao Crowns and gathering all the treasures there, they rushed over to this place to fight for more primal chaos qi.

When they saw the endless primal chaos qi gushing out of this place, their eyes reddened. In particular, the sight of the golden dragon scale encircled by the big eighteen immemorial dragon kings evoked a profound emotion within them. Greed glimmered in their eyes, igniting the insatiable hunger for boundless power.

“Kill!”

Hundreds of them were from different races. But without hesitation, they charged at the golden dragon scale together.

These people were originally already powerful, and now that they had condensed Heavenly Dao Crowns, their confidence naturally inflated. That golden dragon scale made them directly ignore the eighteen dragon king corpses and rush straight at Long Chen. If they were going to fight over something, they would fight over the best.

“This is the most critical juncture. The first batch of experts that have condensed Heavenly Dao Crowns has shown up, and more and more of them will be appearing. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like boss will be coming out of seclusion any time soon, so we have to prepare for a long-term fight. Remember, every bit of our power counts. Don’t waste your energy!” reminded Xia Chen.

“Don’t worry, I won’t waste energy just to show off.” Guo Ran laughed valiantly while feeling slightly guilty inside. If it weren’t for Xia Chen’s reminder, he would have immediately charged out for a glorious display.

“I’m going.” Xia Chen had runes flow around his hands. The next moment, his figure swayed and he vanished.

When he reappeared, he was in front of a large lifeform, and he sent a single palm at it.

“Those who block me will die!” shouted it. Confronted by a feeble scholar from the human race, the large lifeform unleashed a seemingly simple punch, yet it radiated an awe-inspiring brilliance of golden light. Unexpectedly, this lifeform was a metal energy cultivator.

BOOM!

Xia Chen’s palm met his fist just like that. Upon contact, a mesmerizing display unfolded—a cascade of golden dragon scales materialized upon Xia Chen's arm, and each intricately adorned scale bore a mystical golden rune. Amidst a heaven-shaking sound, that large lifeform shattered into pieces and fell to the ground like a broken statue.

“With such weak control, how dare you boast so loudly?” Xia Chen sneered. After that, he shouted, “All those who approach the golden dragon scale will be killed without exception!”

After killing that lifeform, Xia Chen vanished and reappeared in front of another lifeform, which was then blasted apart by another single punch.

Xia Chen was like a phantom, coming and going without a trace. Every single one of his attacks killed a powerful expert.

In just a short moment, seven powerful lifeforms were slain. It had to be known that these were terrifying existences that had condensed Heavenly Dao Crowns, but Xia Chen was killing them one after another.

“Damn, he’s unrivaled!”

Guo Ran had just killed two powerful lifeforms with his battle sabers. Eyeing Xia Chen’s clean movements, he was amazed.

The current Xia Chen was using the dragon scales covering his body as a vector. With his essence, qi, and spirit controlling his blood, he could use his blood as ink to directly inscribe talismans on his scales.

As a result, any talisman that he could control could be freely inscribed on his dragon scales. For example, when he had fought that metal energy cultivator, his arm had been backed by metal energy talismans. With them, Xia Chen crushed his enemy using his own metal power. Supported by his dragon blood, he was no longer afraid of close-range combat.

The next six lifeforms were also killed with different talismans depending on Xia Chen’s desires. He directly picked the best talismans to beat them with. As a result, those experts didn’t even have a chance to do anything before they were slain.

“Die!” With a thunderous roar, Guo Ran resolutely put away his sabers, opting instead for a devastating punch. As the void shattered, a torrential qi wave mercilessly obliterated the closest dozen experts. It was the power of his Supreme Bone that fueled this great display of might.

“I already told you to save your energy! Even more terrifying experts might come soon!” scolded Xia Chen angrily.

Hearing this, Guo Ran instantly blushed. After seeing how powerful Xia Chen was, he also wanted to erupt a bit and ended up forgetting Xia Chen’s reminder.

“I’m intimidating them with power so they will go somewhere else! Otherwise, if we have to kill every single person who comes, we’ll exhaust ourselves!” transmitted Guo Ran. Although he was quibbling, this was also reasonable.

After this attack, the charging lifeforms fell back, their momentum stopped. The greed that had clouded their heads was cleared up.

“There are so many treasure lands around, yet you just have to send yourselves to your deaths. Why bother?” Guo Ran’s words reverberated, instilling a sense of dread into their hearts. After scaring them, Guo Ran shook his head in pity.

With that reminder, these experts looked toward the other dragon kings, hesitating. Clearly, Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s immense power had shaken them.

No matter how amazing the treasure was, they had to be alive in order to enjoy it. After all, even if hundreds of them stood united, they might not fare well against Guo Ran and Xia Chen. If things went badly, they might even be killed one by one.

The problem was that they all came for one particular treasure land, but they weren’t from the same power, their hearts not united. So, even if they went all-out, their lack of cooperation would not give them much advantage.

“Everyone, don’t fall for his plan! They’re stalling! If we keep waiting, others will come, and the benefits will all go to them!” shouted a devil lifeform. He was at least a bit smart.

“You think we’re stalling? How laughable. Since you’re so smart, why don’t you come over? What? You want to instill others to fight while you benefit from the rear? Come, as long as you dare to take the lead, I’ll believe what you just said,” challenged Guo Ran disdainfully.

All eyes turned toward that devil expert. Bristled with indignation, that devil expert was unable to even retort.

If he took the lead, Xia Chen and Guo Ran would instantly kill him. Even one of them would be enough to easily wipe him out, let alone their combined forces.

“Hmph, treacherous human race. Let’s see how long you can last. I’ll put you in your place later.”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lacking the audacity to take the lead, the devil expert swiftly set his sights on a nearby dragon corpse and charged toward it. He knew that there weren’t that many experts there.

Once the devil lifeform left, the others also found their own targets. After all, although they had condensed Heavenly Dao Crowns, they could strengthen their crowns even further by absorbing more primal chaos qi.

However, before they could catch their breath, the world erupted with a deafening rumble once again. From every direction, a swarm of experts emerged, converging upon them with relentless force. Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s expressions changed, their initial alarm escalating as they realized the number of opponents had multiplied tenfold.

“We can’t fight them all. It seems that we need to switch to your tactic. You take the front; I’ll take the rear.” Xia Chen took a deep breath, and runes flowed on top of his dragon scales. After that, he exchanged a glance with Guo Ran, and they both nodded. They actually charged at those terrifying lifeforms.

Ninety-nine talismans swirled around Xia Chen’s hands, weaving together to create a colossal lotus. In the blink of an eye, flames surged from the runes adorning his dragon scales, coursing into the center of the lotus. Instantaneously, the lotus blazed into a raging inferno that gave off an apocalyptic aura.

“I’ll try boss’s trump card, the World Extermination Flame Lotus!” With a resounding shout, Xia Chen unleashed this giant flame lotus upon the onslaught of approaching experts.
