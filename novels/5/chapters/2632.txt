Chapter 2621 Does Your Face Not Hurt?

In the face of the dragon woman’s questioning, Evilmoon coldly snorted, “Long Chen is a true son of the heavens, the heir of the true dragon. Do you really think that the dragon scale was a masterless item? What a joke. It was a gift specifically left to Long Chen by a mysterious existence. Long Chen could obtain the approval of a true dragon, so of course he can obtain my approval. As for you? Despite being the emperor of the black dragon race, you associate yourself with these fish. You’ve practically lost all the face of the dragon race.”

When did he become the true son of the heavens? Long Chen was surprised to hear such nonsense come from Evilmoon’s mouth. When did Evilmoon become so shameless as to raise his status to cover up its own embarrassment?

When Evilmoon was done, the dragon woman was trembling with rage. After that, black dragon marks appeared in her eyes, and her aura grew increasingly frightening.

“Girl, as fellow members of the dragon race, I’d advise you not to try using your divine ability. The current you have yet to reach the necessary realm to use it. You will destroy your own foundation. Even if you do use it, you won’t be able to kill Long Chen. Do you think that everyone else here is powerless?” sneered Evilmoon.

Evilmoon could see through her actions. It knew that she wanted to use one of her terrifying divine abilities, but that was meaningless. Even if she was able to defeat Long Chen, there was still the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the others present. If she wanted to kill Long Chen, it would only be an idiot’s dream.

At that time, she would have failed to kill Long Chen and then also suffered a backlash. If that harmed her foundation, it would be too late for regret.

Right now, the dragon woman trembled from rage. However, she had no choice but to admit that Evilmoon was correct. She couldn’t kill Long Chen nor could she take his essence blood. Furthermore, the price of using this divine ability was immense.

For a moment, she could only tremble. Now that things had reached this point, it was difficult for her to stop. Leaving just like this? She was unwilling as she couldn’t lose that much face.

She had confidence that her divine ability could defeat Long Chen. But defeating and killing someone were two different concepts. In the end, she would have gained nothing. The suffocating feeling of having power but not daring to use it almost drove her insane.

“Dragon lady, this was a misunderstanding. Since we’re all living on the Martial Heaven Continent, it’s not good for us to fight amongst ourselves. In this time when we’re surrounded by powerful enemies, it would be better for everyone to set our differences aside. We can sit down and peacefully discuss things, don’t you think?” At this moment, Long Aotian finally spoke up.

This was equivalent to giving the dragon woman a chance to step down. However, she still said, “There is nothing to discuss. I waited tens of thousands of years for the azure dragon essence blood, so Long Chen must split half of it with me. But today, I’ll give face to the divine families and temporarily leave things like this for today.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She then turned to Long Chen. “However, don’t think that this matter is over. When I ascend into a dragon king, I’ll fight with you once more. The winner is king. I don’t care if you’re the son of the heavens or the true dragon’s heir, I will still take your essence blood. What is mine belongs to me, and no one can take it.”

“Long Chen, you really are an unlucky star. Wherever you go, you find enemies. Don’t you think you should reflect upon yourself?” said Ye Liangchen sinisterly.

“Does your face not hurt?” Long Chen turned to Ye Liangchen and looked at him curiously.

Everyone fell deathly silent and looked at Ye Liangchen oddly. When Long Chen and the others had returned from the Star Field Divine World, Ye Liangchen had chosen to attack him, even saying that he would defeat Long Chen in an instant. As a result, he had yet to even finish speaking before he was sent flying by a slap from Long Chen.

Asking him if his face didn’t hurt? Everyone immediately thought of that resounding slap.

Standing beside Ye Liangchen, Feng Fei almost laughed. This response from Long Chen was truly perfect. Ye Liangchen’s tongue might be vicious, but it seemed that he couldn’t match Long Chen.

As a result, Ye Liangchen turned ashen. He unsheathed his sword and pointed it at Long Chen. “Long Chen, last time I was merely careless! Do you really think that you’re qualified to fight me?!”

Long Chen had picked at his wound in front of all the top experts of the Martial Heaven Continent, almost driving Ye Liangchen crazy.

Although Ye Liangchen was infuriated, Long Chen was indifferent. His scales vanished and he returned to his normal state, faintly smiling. “Is your head not good, or are your ears broken? I asked you if your face hurt because I care about you. After all, the raging astral winds and flying dust can easily irritate a person’s face. Why did you suddenly go berserk? Did you think of some bad memories?”

Everyone looked at Long Chen speechlessly. It would be strange if anyone believed him.

However, Ye Liangchen definitely deserved it. Why would he have to provoke Long Chen like he had nothing else to do? Wasn’t that asking to be slapped?

Despite that, many people were also worried about this exchange. After all, the Martial Heaven Continent had recently resumed working with the divine families. If their relationship was fractured once more, there probably wouldn’t be time to repair things.

Therefore, people looked from Ye Liangchen to Long Chen. They almost knelt and begged the two of them to stop messing around and calmly face their common enemies. If they had this much energy, why didn’t they burn it off by killing some extra invaders?

As though he could hear their thoughts, Long Aotian suddenly said, “We came here to welcome the original devil race back to the Martial Heaven Continent. Let us work together. Hopefully, everyone here can unite against our common enemy. We will protect the Martial Heaven Continent and our families from the pain of war.”

After saying that, Long Aotian walked back onto the chariot, followed by Feng Fei and Jiang Wuchen. As for Ye Liangchen, although he gnashed his teeth, he also put away his sword and entered the chariot. After that, the chariot whistled away, vanishing.

Looking at this scene, Long Chen shrugged, acting innocent. Everyone had seen how they had provoked him first. It had nothing to do with him.

Right now, the divine families had expressed their attitude, having welcomed the original devil race back. Therefore, those still harboring suspicions were forced to keep their mouths shut when it came to the original devil race.

As for those who supported Long Chen, they felt even more confident in him. If even the divine families supported him, then there should be no problem with the original devil race.

The original devil race was formally accepted. However, they currently couldn’t stay for a long period because the Skyscraping World’s aura had yet to fully permeate the Martial Heaven Continent. This bit of rejection from the laws of the continent wasn’t favorable to the original devil race’s cultivation.

However, once the Skyscraping World’s aura was fully integrated with the Martial Heaven Continent, the original devil race would be able to unleash their full potential on the battlefield.

Everyone slowly scattered. In the end, only a few selected members were invited by Long Chen to the Skyscraping World. After that, Yue Xihan personally welcomed the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, the Music Master, Qu Jianying, the old man, Li Tianxuan, and the others.
