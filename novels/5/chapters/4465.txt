Chapter 4454 Who Dares to Fight Me?

“Dodge!”

The nether dragon race’s experts were shocked to see Long Chen grab Netherdragon Tianzhao and use him as a whip. They hesitated to block the attack directly, fearing they might injure Netherdragon Tianzhao.

As a result, the nether dragon race’s experts scattered with this one move.

Long Chen abruptly pulled, causing Netherdragon Tianzhao’s head to swing toward him. Seizing the moment, Long Chen delivered a powerful fist, aiming squarely at him.

BOOM!

Long Chen thought that this attack would blow up Netherdragon Tianzhao’s head. However, the Doyen rune on his forehead suddenly blazed with light. Long Chen’s arm went numb, and the dragon scales on his fist shattered.

At the same time, the terrifying will of the Heavenly Daos charged into his mind. It felt like the heavens were rejecting him.

“Fuck off!” Long Chen roared. An invisible sword then shot out of his forehead and pierced the void.

What he just shot out was the will of the Heavenly Daos. As Long Chen attempted to strike down Netherdragon Tianzhao, the will of the Heavenly Daos intervened, seeking to aid Netherdragon Tianzhao in killing him.

However, Long Chen’s will was exceptionally formidable. The will of the Heavenly Daos encountered immediate rejection as soon as it tried to invade his soul.

Long Chen was startled and enraged. When this will attacked him, Long Chen sensed the scent of death. If he had reacted any slower, he might have been killed.

This incensed him to no end. It was like having a fair fight with someone, only to have the referee sneak attack him at the critical moment. This blatant partiality was so enraging that he couldn’t describe it with words.

“So in the end, being Sage King means dogshit! What chosen of the Heavenly Daos—I spit on you! Starting today, I, Long Chen, am going to defy the heavens in everything! If gods block me, I’ll slay gods. If immortals block me, I will kill immortals!” Long Chen roared with fury and shot after Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s guts were completely broken. Even he had not expected his Doyen mark to save him at that critical moment.

It could save him once, but not twice. It instantly went dark after unleashing its divine light.

“Save me!” Netherdragon Tianzhao cried out in terror. He had managed to escape Long Chen’s devil claws thanks to the attack from this Doyen mark. However, as he saw Long Chen coming at him again, his soul almost fled in terror.

“Protect the young master at all costs!” shouted the nether dragon race’s experts as they formed a human wall—no, a dragon wall in front of Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Warriors of the various races, are you planning on just watching as the despicable humans act arrogantly? As the vice race leader of the nether dragon race, I request all of you to fight together with us against Long Chen! We definitely will not let the human race stand above our heads and shit on us! As long as you help us, the nether dragon race will remember this favor. In the future, we will definitely repay you!” shouted an elder of the nether dragon race.

“All budding Doyens, this is your best chance to form a friendship with my nether dragon race! By aiding us now, not only will you receive the support of the nether dragon race, but the young master will also assist you in awakening as Doyens!” shouted another expert.

Although the nether dragon race had over ten thousand Eternal experts, in front of the crazed Long Chen, they felt no confidence at all.

Countless experts were moved by this offer. The experts of various worlds comprised at least eighty percent of the experts here, and their sentiments toward humans were far from favorable. In fact, many could be deemed outright hostile.

Killing a genius of the human race was crucial for them. Not only would it eliminate a potential future threat, but it would also establish an amicable relationship with the nether dragon race. There was only upside in helping the latter.

“Long Chen is already exhausted and can’t last much longer! As long as he is slain, the treasure that looks like the Heaven Earth Cauldron will go to everyone!” shouted another expert from the nether dragon race. As soon as the spectators heard this, greed instantly appeared in their eyes.

The Heaven Earth Cauldron—one of the primal chaos era’s ten great divine items—was an unmatched divine weapon. Anyone who controlled it would be the future master of the world.

While there were doubts about whether the bronze cauldron in Long Chen’s possession was genuinely the Heaven Earth Cauldron, its capability to annihilate a Saint weapon with a Saint’s soul made it apparent that it was no ordinary item. If fortune favored them, it could indeed turn out to be the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

“Killing an exhausted Sage King would be an unfair contest. I would rather experience the skills of the human race’s heavenly geniuses.” At this moment, a budding Doyen actually chose to go after the Dragonblood Legion.

Following that, many other budding Doyens also shot toward the Dragonblood Legion, and one of them even shouted, “Those two pretty girls are mine! Don’t blame me for being rude if anyone fights over them with me!”

Hearing this, Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan were enraged, particularly Bai Shishi. Icy killing intent filled her eyes.

“Fuck! Brothers, kill them all!” roared Guo Ran. These idiots really did view them as weaklings. They wanted to fight over Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan? That was the greatest insult to Guo Ran and the others.

“Kill!”

When the fury of the Dragonblood Legion erupted, their battle cries shook the heavens. Guo Ran took the vanguard, his battle armor shining as he slashed his saber.

BOOM!

One of the closest budding Doyens was directly sent flying by this one blow. “If you have guts, let’s fight to the death! Whoever runs first calls the other daddy!”

Just like that, Guo Ran left the formation of the Dragonblood Legion and dove into the crowd of budding Doyens.

Those budding Doyens were incensed. Guo Ran had actually charged into their midst? He was completely looking down on them. Hence, over ten of them immediately attacked him at the same time.

However, they were shocked to find that when their attacks landed on his armor, an immortal character appeared on his chest and front.

Block—this immortal character radiated like a sun, effortlessly absorbing all of their attacks.

“Die!”

Guo Ran raised his saber, and in response, the Block character dimmed. With a furious roar, Guo Ran swung his saber downward.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

BOOM!

A budding Doyen instantly had a bad feeling and tried to run, only to find that he was locked down. He could only roar and block with all his power but was wiped out of existence along with his weapon.

Most terrifying of all, Guo Ran’s saber continued, unleashing a tempest that blew away the surrounding budding Doyens.

Seeing this scene, all those experts were taken aback. Long Chen’s subordinates weren’t as easy to bully as they had expected.

“Who dares to fight me?!”

Guo Ran raised his head and roared. With his armor aglow, he shot deeper into their midst, resembling an invincible battle god.
