Chapter 1947: 1947

Wilde’s return lifted a weight from Long Chen’s heart . After a thorough examination of Wilde’s body, Long Chen found that Wilde was truly a monster . His body was even a bit tougher than Long Chen’s .

It had to be known that Long Chen’s body had been reconstructed by the azure dragon essence blood . It had finally finished the reconstruction, bringing him to an unprecedented power level . But Wilde’s physical body was even stronger than his .

As for the bone club, Wilde adored it . The curious thing was that despite not knowing any magical arts, Wilde could transform the bone club’s size according to his will . Wilde finally had a weapon that he loved .

The Dragonblood Legion celebrated Wilde’s return for three days with a feast . Once the celebration was over, Guo Ran took Long Chen away for a private chat .

“Boss, there’s several times more Scarlet Blood Essence Gold than we expected . Do you want to sell some of the ore for money?” asked Guo Ran . Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Are we lacking money?”

Guo Ran nodded . “Yes . I’ve finished the estimates you asked me to do . Creating a perfect armor and weapon set on the divine item level for twelve thousand people will require a shocking amount of supplementary material . I feel like I might have bragged a bit harder than I could . Creating divine items takes a long time, and we lack the foundation for that . ”

Guo Ran was speaking the truth . Divine items were not so easy to create . Even if Guo Ran had the ability, the cost would be enough to make someone crazy .

Guo Ran had only made an initial calculation, and there were many other things that hadn’t been factored in yet . Hence, he was already feeling like this wasn’t possible .

That was why Guo Ran wanted to sell some of the Scarlet Blood Essence Gold . However, he didn’t know the market price of it, so he would need to calculate how much could be sold and for how much profit before taking the next step .

“We can’t sell the Scarlet Blood Essence Gold . We don’t just need to outfit ourselves, but we also need to equip the original devil race, our allies . Speaking of which, is the original devil race’s equipment capable of refining the ore?”

“The original devil race’s foundation is extremely amazing . Their equipment is marvelous, and although it’s been set aside for countless years, all of it is undamaged . The race leader has already ordered some Forging Masters to begin studying the techniques for forging divine items . They have their own forging arts, and those Forging Masters were previously capable of creating Ancestral items . All they need is some practice and they should be capable of using the special crafting methods of the original devil race to create divine items . ” Guo Ran was filled with praise for the original devil race’s techniques and tools . They were truly worthy of an existence that had survived for eons . Although they had declined, their inheritance had not been severed .

“In other words, we have the skills, the equipment, the people, and can get any materials . We’re just lacking money?”

“Yes, that’s about right . Crafting divine items requires some auxiliary materials . Buying those materials is possible, but it requires a shocking amount of money,” said Guo Ran gravely .

“How much money do you estimate?”

“Even in the best-case scenario, we would need this much . ” Guo Ran raised five fingers .

“Fifty billion spirit crystals?” Despite being prepared for that number, Long Chen was still shocked .

“Boss, it’s five hundred billion spirit crystals, and that’s a conservative estimate . Once we really start crafting, that number might get broken through in an instant . ” Guo Ran bitterly smiled .

Five hundred billion spirit crystals . Guo Ran didn’t even dare to imagine just how much money that really was . This was the lowest estimate for creating twelve thousand sets of armor and weapons on the divine item level . This number was only so low because they had the Scarlet Blood Essence Gold .

Long Chen sucked in a cold gasp of air . It had to be known that the entire reconstruction of the Xuantian Dao Sect had cost under ten billion spirit crystals .

Creating these divine items would be equivalent to building fifty Xuantian Dao Sects . The current Xuantian Dao Sect was number one in the Eastern Xuan Region and possessed the strongest foundation . It was a foundation that Long Chen had created with money .

At that time, to reconstruct the sect, he had been rushing everywhere, getting a lot of spirit crystals from the Huayun Sect and the Corrupt path, as well as the money that the Xuantian Dao Sect possessed itself, and only then had they managed to finish the construction . However, now they needed five hundred billion spirit crystals .

“The Dragonblood warriors need these divine items . No matter how much money it takes, we need to do it . People like Huo Lieyun, True Immortal Jiaoqi, Xie Luo, Di Feng, and the others have top grade divine items . If they charged into the Dragonblood Legion in their current state, there would be heavy losses . I’ll think of something for the money issues . Has the refinement of the Scarlet Blood Essence Gold already started?”

“We started the refinement the day after we found the ore,” said Guo Ran . After all, even if Long Chen wanted to sell it, they could sell the already refined Scarlet Blood Essence Gold for even more money .

The original devil race had a great deal of manpower, and the equipment was readily available . Using it was very convenient, so they were very efficient .

“Alright, keep an eye on things . Do your best to extract as much Scarlet Blood Essence Gold as you can . As for the other requirements, give me a list . ”

A while later, Long Chen received a list with hundreds of divine materials that they needed .

Creating a divine item required many materials . Long Chen didn’t know anything about this regard, so he simply put the list away .

He gathered everyone up, making them go into seclusion . They had to raise their cultivation bases to the first Heavenstage so that they could truly control their world energy .

The Dragonblood warriors’ confidence which had risen thanks to advancing to the Life Star realm had been suppressed by the Golden Eye Berserk Ape . That was even better for their cultivation .

After arranging this, Long Chen said goodbye to Yue Xihan, once more entering the Martial Heaven Continent from the original devil race’s transportation formation .

“Fuck, I’m finally back . Pill Valley, come at me!” Smelling the familiar scent of the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen smiled .

He rushed off . The first place he wanted to go was the Eastern Xuan Region . This time, he had no disguise . He swaggered into the Eastern Xuan City brazenly .

When he arrived, he caused a clamor . Countless experts fled as if fleeing from a demon .

Long Chen ignored them and walked directly into the Huayun Pavilion in the city . Within the pavilion, he saw Zheng Wenlong .

“Brother Long, for you to see me urgently, it seems you have some big business for me . ” Zheng Wenlong laughed .

“I’m sure brother Wenlong is a busy man . Each blink of an eye probably represents hundreds of thousands of spirit crystals to you . If I didn’t have something big for you, how could I waste your time?” Long Chen also laughed .

“My Huayun Sect is just a little business that invests its capital to make interest . But brother Long is an empty-handed wolf with no capital . So tell me, what kind of stolen goods do you want me to get rid of this time?” Zheng Wenlong poured a cup of tea for Long Chen before sitting down .

Long Chen received the cup with a bitter smile . “The pillar that the Huayun Sect is grooming is still drinking the same tea as back then? No wonder it’s said that the richer someone is, the stingier they are . ”

This tea was the same tea that Zheng Wenlong had used back in the Eastern Wasteland . This kind of tea no longer suited Zheng Wenlong’s high status .

“Haha, isn’t this called not forgetting my original heart? Back then, we both had to bitterly save up everything that snowballed us into our current levels . Don’t look at my high status and think that life is easy for me now . The pressure is immense . Pill Valley in particular has been pressing on us lately, making our business more difficult to carry out . Brother Long, hurry and give me some new business, or I’ll starve,” said Zheng Wenlong .

“Ha, I find that you business people really like to talk about being poor the richer you get . Look at me, I never cried that I was poor, not because I didn’t want to cry, but because I didn’t have the energy to cry,” said Long Chen .

Zheng Wenlong laughed . “Alright, then when it comes to crying about being poor, I’m not your match . Let’s circle back to the main topic . What business do you have for me this time?”

“I’m lacking money and a great deal of it . So I want to sell some things to you . ”

“Lacking money is no problem, as long as you have good products . ”

The current Zheng Wenlong had a high position . Hua Mingxiong had followed Ma Ruyun’s suggestion and given Zheng Wenlong even more authority .

“Let’s eat while we talk about it . ” Long Chen took out a large baking tray and put strips of fish meat on top of it . As a result, popping sounds rang out as the oil boiled, and a fragrant scent filled the air .

“Haha, brother Long’s cooking definitely isn’t ordinary . It seems my mouth will be blessed . ” Zheng Wenlong knew that with Long Chen’s character, he wouldn’t bring out something unless it was good .

When the fish was ready, he took a bite of it . Fragrance erupted, and it dissolved in his mouth . He felt all his pores open and his blood quicken . Some kind of energy merged into his blood .

“This is...!”

“Eat some more and you’ll be able to guess . ” Long Chen also took a piece of fish for himself .

Zheng Wenlong took some more bites, his expression gradually changing . “This is... Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish! For it to be this big, it has to be a fish king level... you actually ate it like this?!”

The Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish was the most precious ancient spiritual lifeform . Their blood could stimulate a person’s Spirit Blood, awakening their hidden potential . Their value was inestimable .

However, if this fish was cooked, it would lose eighty percent of its energy, so Zheng Wenlong was staring at Long Chen in disbelief .

“This is the only way to not bring down your new status . ” Long Chen smiled .

“You actually ate such a precious natural treasure? I’m afraid of facing karmic retribution . ” Zheng Wenlong bitterly smiled, but since the fish had been cooked, he ate some more .

“Brother Wenlong, one of the things I came with today is the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish . Do you feel like selling them would be profitable?”
