Chapter 2300 Peng Wanshan

Translator: BornToBe

Unexpectedly, the eighth legion guarding the outside of the Yin Yang World had been replaced by the seventh legion. It was no wonder the Righteous path was being bullied, while the divine families just watched.

The commander of the seventh legion was Ye Benchang. He and Long Chen already had significant enmity toward each other. As the one in charge of that region, it would be a miracle if Ye Benchang didn’t try to cause trouble for him and the Righteous path.

“The current Righteous path is being pressured from all sides. Their share of the battlefields is shrinking, and some of their disciples have died. One of them caused quite a stir. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s Wang Zhen was killed by one of the Xuan Beasts’ experts,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

“What?!”

Everyone was infuriated. Wang Zhen was one of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s core disciples. He was a very rare insect cultivator with immense power. He had once fought alongside the Dragonblood warriors. As a result, Everyone’s killing intent soared.

“That matter resulted in Ye Lingshan immediately declaring war on the Xuan Beasts. The Martial Heaven Alliance went on an all-out assault. Both sides lost people, but due to their overwhelming numbers, the Martial Heaven Alliance suppressed the Xuan Beasts. However, just as the latter began to be forced back, Pill Valley, the Corrupt path, the ancient races, the ancient family alliance, the Dongfang family, and other powers arrived to stand by their side. As for the Nangong family, the Beitang family, and the Ximen family, they stood beside Ye Lingshan. Both sides were about to start a war, and only then did the divine families interfere. The Heavenly Dragon Legion descended and split apart the two sides. Due to casualties appearing on both sides, they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled. The Righteous path’s morale has dropped because you haven’t appeared in a long time. Everyone thinks that you failed and that the Martial Heaven Alliance’s situation is unstable,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

Yue Xiaoqian had been forced to just watch as all this occurred. She was a member of the original devil race, so if she suddenly appeared, it would draw too much suspicion. Furthermore, amongst all the original devil race’s disciples, she was the only one capable of using the Profound Spirit Dao Scripture, and thus the only one capable of concealing her identity from the continent’s experts. The other disciples of the original devil race could be recognized.

That was why even though Ye Lingshan and the Righteous path had fallen into such a critical state, Yue Xiaoqian hadn’t dared to rashly take action. If things went badly, it would be adding oil to the fire.

“I thought that I was skilled at courting death. Who would have thought that this world has people even more skilled than me in that regard?” A vein throbbed on Long Chen’s forehead. “We’re going. Xiaoqian, you come with us this time.”

They activated the transportation formation to return to the Wild World. The Wild World was in the same state as when they had left. The original devil race was excavating many precious ores, and their elite warriors were guarding the spatial portals to exterminate any of the devil race’s experts that arrived.

Xia Chen then activated the transportation formation within the Wild World. Divine light enveloped everyone, and they appeared within the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory.

However, when they arrived, they found that things were chaotic. Countless Xuan Beasts were attacking.

The grand formation had already been broken. Powerful Xuan Beasts poured in like a tide. They were all Netherpassage experts, and they were also Empyreans.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory was badly damaged. The ground was littered with corpses, many of them belong to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Que Yuzhu was leading her experts at the core of the formation. Only this core area was able to remain whole, but even it was on the verge of crumbling.

“Hahaha, Que Yuzhu, this is the result of not adapting to change. You wanted to rely on a little human whose fur hasn’t even grown in? Did you think that would allow you to rest at ease? Now, Long Chen and his Dragonblood Legion are dead, so your Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race can go with them to hell. Space has been locked here, and it’s impossible to send requests for help. You’re trapped. Do you regret your actions now? If you surrender, I can give you a path to life.” One of the Peng race’s experts stood in the air, directing the attack of the Xuan Beasts.

“Peng Wanshan, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race will not bend our spines even in death!” shouted Que Yuzhu.

“Oh? Then I’ll just break them instead. Kill them all! They can’t last much longer,” sneered that expert.

Peng Wanli was the leader of the Peng race and the Xuan Beasts, while this person was Peng Wanli’s brother, Peng Wanshan. He was a well-known member of the Xuan Beasts with an extremely high status. His position was second only to Peng Wanli.

“What a good idea.” Just at this moment, a sinister voice rang out. It was like a devil had been summoned, and killing intent turned the air cold.

“Long Chen!”

Que Yuzhu and the others cried out in relief and delight. Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion hadn’t died.

Furthermore, their auras had clearly grown, and their Yuan Spirits had broken through to the next level. They could undergo their tribulation at any time to become true Netherpassage experts.

Everyone from the Dragonblood Legion had actually succeeded. Heaven-shaking cheers came from the experts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

On the other side, Peng Wanshan and the other experts of the Xuan Beasts were badly shocked. However, Peng Wanshan suddenly laughed. “Hahaha, excellent, you came at the perfect time. You haven’t even undergone your tribulations, yet you dared to come? Then today, the brilliance of the Dragonblood Legion and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race can die here.”

Peng Wanshan’s initial shock quickly turned to excitement. In his eyes, Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion had yet to become Netherpassage experts. They had basically thrown themselves into their net.

“Then we’ll see if you have that ability.” Long Chen suddenly sneered. He charged forward into their midst.

“Long Chen, do you think you’re still unrivaled? You’re just a piece of trash now!” A spotted tiger unleashed a powerful claw at him. His manifestation rumbled behind him. He was an Empyrean who had awakened his manifestation and had now advanced into the Netherpassage realm.

Xuan Beasts that successfully advanced to the Netherpassage realm had their bodies grow stronger, and their bloodline divine abilities took another step forward.

Long Chen didn’t directly receive this attack. Lightning wings appeared on his back, and he turned into a streak of light, narrowly avoiding the claw.

The tiger roared angrily and opened his mouth. Terrifying ripples began to form.

However, before he could unleash his next attack, a transparent crescent moon blade stabbed through his jaw and came out of the top of his head. His giant body shuddered and then fell to the ground.

He didn’t move again. He was killed by a tiny crescent moon blade.

“Hehe, big sister Leng Yueyan is great. I really love her.” Tang Wan-er was smiling excitedly. The crescent moon blade came flying back to her. She had just killed a Netherpassage Empyrean with an awakened manifestation in just one easy blow. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Endless Falling Wood, Earthen Thorns Piece the Sky.”

Chu Yao waved her staff. The earth exploded and countless wooden staves flew out.

Chu Yao felt like the entire earth’s life energy was hers to command. She felt unlimited power.

As the wooden staves flew through the air, the Xuan Beasts that were pouncing upon Long Chen were forced back. They let out miserable cries when those staves pierced their bodies.

Chu Yao’s attack range encompassed the entire battlefield. Twisting wooden staves covered everything, forming a giant defensive domain.

Everyone was amazed by Chu Yao’s range. In the past, Chu Yao had also been skilled in wide-area attacks. But due to how widely spread her attacks were, they were lacking sharpness and unable to pose a fatal threat to true experts. Most of the time, they would be able to dodge or flee.

However, with the wooden staff, Chu Yao’s wood spirit energy had become more vigorous. Even the earth was supporting her, giving her attacks an extra sharpness. They struck like lightning.

Even Chu Yao herself was shocked. The staff that Leng Yueyan had given her was a priceless treasure.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, Long Chen unleashed his own powerful attack. His divine ring had appeared behind him, and dragon scales were covering his body. However, dozens of the Xuan Beasts’ awakened Empyreans joined forces to stop him. He was unable to get past them.

“Haha, Long Chen, do you think everyone is still stuck in the Life Star realm? You’re no different than trash right now. Do you really think you can charge in and kill me? Are you trying to make me laugh to death?” Peng Wanshan sneered from behind those experts. He clasped his hands behind him, seemingly having no intention of fighting.

So what if Long Chen was powerful? There were over a hundred of the Xuan Beasts’ young geniuses who had awakened their manifestations here. Even if Long Chen could fight ten, could he fight a hundred?

Although Chu Yao and Tang Wan-er’s attacks had been surprising, they were just some minor surprises. They were unable to change the entire board.

By charging into their midst, in Peng Wanshan’s eyes, Long Chen had trapped himself. He couldn’t escape his palm. Hence, Peng Wanshan felt no fear.

“You’re wrong. I didn’t come to kill you, but to smash your spine apart.”

Killing intent raged in Long Chen’s eyes, and a certain object appeared in his hand. With a powerful toss, it became a ray of light smashing through their midst.
