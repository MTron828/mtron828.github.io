Chapter 2596 Revealing What is Hidden

“Greetings, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!”

Long Chen had just arrived when disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance ran over to greet him.

Therefore, Long Chen nodded to them. “Has there been any activity here?”

A disciple answered, “Reporting to senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, the other world’s aura is constantly infecting the Martial Heaven Continent. However, the size of this entrance has not grown. Most likely, it has been suppressed by the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent, but there is no way to say for certain, so we are currently paying close attention to it.”

The gate between Resentful Death City and the Corrupt God Cemetery had been inadvertently opened by Mo Nian. As a result, the aura of Resentful Death City was entering the Martial Heaven Continent through the Corrupt God Cemetery.

However, it was unable to spread after reaching a limit of ten thousand miles from the exit, similar to the Yin Yang world. Hence, that disciple’s assumptions were most likely correct. It must be suppressed by the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent.

Nevertheless, once the aura of Resentful Death City grew to a certain density, it would be able to spread further, and then the resentful spirits inside would be able to enter the Martial Heaven Continent freely. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, hair-raising roars occasionally rang out from the other side of the portal. It was like devils howling.

“Stand guard over this place. I’m going inside to take a look,” said Long Chen.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen! You can’t go inside!” The disciple cried out, but Long Chen had entered the portal. It was too late to stop him.

When he entered this time, he found that its aura was completely different from before. There was now a trace of life within the aura of death and decay.

As soon as he was inside, he saw countless corpses littering the ground. Their bodies and clothes were rotting, and yet their bodies moved when he arrived. They were resentful spirits.

“The Corrupt path’s people?” Long Chen was surprised. These resentful spirits were not the ones that Mo Nian had seen. These were the Corrupt path’s experts based on their robes.

Mo Nian hadn’t seen a single resentful spirit of the Corrupt path within Resentful Death City. However, all Long Chen saw were those belonging to the Corrupt path.

After that, Long Chen saw burial mounds on the ground that had been recently excavated. These experts must have been buried there previously.

The closest one of them attacked Long Chen with a sword, but he was blown back by a palm from Long Chen.

“Oh?”

Long Chen was surprised that the resentful spirit survived his attack. Its body was extremely tough.

“Their bodies were turned into puppets through special methods that allow them to unleash even greater power than when they were alive.” Long Chen quickly saw through some clues.

After that, he waved his hand, sending out a torrent of lightning. As a result, those resentful spirits wailed, white smoke emitting from their bodies. In just a breath of time, they turned into true corpses.

Clapping suddenly rang out, and a figure slowly appeared from within a mass of black qi, looking like a specter in the night. It was Ye Ming.

Ye Ming praised, “You are probably the only one to ever be able to control heavenly punishment lightning. Even a Sovereign was unable to do such a thing. Admirable.”

“If you really admire me, you’d bring out your real body instead of this clone. What, are you afraid that I’ll slaughter you?” said Long Chen indifferently.

This Ye Ming was not his true self. He looked like a reflection within the darkness, and his figure was swaying unsteadily.

Ye Ming smiled, nodding. “You are correct. I’m truly afraid of you slaughtering me.”

“You’re so modest?” asked Long Chen, surprised.

Ye Ming shook his head. “This isn’t modesty but the truth. I don’t like it, but I have to admit that my current self is not a match for you. In the Star Field Divine World, just as I was about to reach unstoppable heights, you still ruined everything. Because of it, I have to admit that you are comparable to a Sovereign, as even Yun Tian didn’t give me the same sense of danger as you. However, don’t forget, I’m the seventh generation Corrupt God. I underwent nirvanic rebirth just for today and have waited tens of thousands of years. All the karma has been arranged. Although there have been some unexpected events, it does not affect the final result. The Martial Heaven Continent will definitely be destroyed, so all your efforts, all your struggles are useless.”

“You came out to see me just to say these empty words?” Long Chen looked at Ye Ming, a sharp light appearing in his eyes. He seemed to be able to see through Ye Ming’s heart.

“I’m telling you this so that you’re prepared. Work hard on your cultivation, and don’t die to someone else before I come out of seclusion. After all, you are the enemy that I appreciate the most. I hope that you die to my hands.” Ye Ming smiled.

“But what if I want to kill you right now?” Long Chen shrugged helplessly.

“Hahahaha… If you want to die a bit sooner, I won’t stop you. At the end of the Corrupt God Cemetery is Resentful Death City. That’s my battlefield. Come. If I kill you now, I won’t need to worry about someone else getting a headstart on me.” Ye Ming laughed, vanishing into the darkness.

His laughter continued to ring out. At the next second, the resentful spirits in the Corrupt God Cemetery suddenly parted, leaving a path for him.

Long Chen smiled and followed that path, going deeper into the Corrupt God Cemetery.

“Are you crazy? Aren’t you sending yourself to your death?” demanded Evilmoon.

Long Chen responded, “Through several interactions, I’ve gotten a deeper understanding of Ye Ming. He’s a schemer, so everything he says is a lie to further his goals. He said those things because he wanted to scare me off, but in truth, he doesn’t want me to enter. There is definitely some secret in there.”

“How do you know that he didn’t predict your line of thought and was baiting you intentionally?”

“There is nothing guaranteed in life. In any case, I trust my vision and intuition. Ye Ming always thinks of himself as clever. His schemes look superior, but they always lack some maturity. As someone who underwent nirvanic rebirth, he has his memories from his last life, and the arrogance from that life has continued in this era as well. That means his character is essentially fixed and will not change. He treats everyone around him like a chess piece, and he has no counselors. If anyone questioned his decisions, he would kill them. Evilmoon, why don’t you tell me if you ever listened to the opinions of your subordinates?” said Long Chen.

Evilmoon was silent. Back then, he had made decisions by himself, and Ye Ming was the same.

Long Chen quickly flew by the countless resentful spirits. They had been buried in the Corrupt God Cemetery since the ancient era and then had been turned into resentful spirits by the aura of Resentful Death City.

Nevertheless, they at least possessed a certain level of will as they listened to Ye Ming’s orders. Their eyes had long since withered, leaving deep empty eye sockets that stared at Long Chen. If it was anyone else, they would probably be scared off.

However, Long Chen charged through them without even looking at them. Just as Mo Nian had said, the coffins here had vanished.

When Long Chen reached the channel, he heard countless roars coming from the other side. They were like thunder in his ears.

“That’s definitely from an existence above Netherpassage, and more than one at that. Long Chen, if you go in, you might not be leaving alive,” said Evilmoon. Ye Ming might just cut off the path back, trapping them in Resentful Death City.

“It’s fine. I’ll run if I see something wrong.” Long Chen clenched his fists. In his hand was a bronze fragment.

This was a fragment of the Eastern Wasteland Bell. Although it was just a fragment, it had absorbed the Source Qi of the Ye family’s counterfeit Eastern Wasteland Bell.

With it, no matter what kind of domain Ye Ming tried to set up, Long Chen would be able to break it. This was his trump card for entering this place.

The aura of death grew stronger. But when Long Chen reached the end of the passageway, he suddenly laughed.

“Ye Ming, I just knew you were scheming to scare me off. So there’s still a Sovereign seal here.”

From the channel, Long Chen saw a barrier separating Resentful Death City and the Corrupt God Cemetery. He was looking through the Sovereign seal.

Countless resentful spirits within Resentful Death City were roaring at the Sovereign seal, but they didn’t dare to approach it.

When Long Chen got closer, he saw a thick layer of dust on the ground on the other side of the exit. It seemed like the remnants of resentful spirits that had tried to charge through.

After that, Long Chen looked up. The barrier had a giant Sovereign character embedded in it, looking like it was made of fresh blood.

This was a seal made with the blood of a sovereign, something that possessed the power to transcend time and space. Thanks to it, even though the Sovereigns were already gone, their work continued to protect the continent.

When Long Chen got closer to the Sovereign seal, it suddenly lit up and enveloped Long Chen in a beam of light.
