Chapter 3433 Repaying Kindness with Enmity?

Lei Yuner was startled by her race leader’s order. She didn’t know what had happened, but she didn’t believe his words. Before this, the race leader had clearly been in full support of her action.

“No! I refuse!” Lei Yuner’s stubborn nature flared. Ignoring his words, she stood by Long Chen’s side.

However, just at that moment, a lightning spear pierced her chest. Lei Yuner couldn’t believe it.

That was because the one that stabbed her was Long Chen. She then looked at Long Chen. Feeling the pain in her chest, feeling her life rapidly flowing away, her voice quivered.

“Why? Don’t you want to have children with me?”

“Sorry, but I never wanted to have children with you. I was only using you. Due to helping me enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, I’ll leave you with an intact corpse,” said Long Chen frostily.

Lei Yuner coughed up blood. With a swing of Long Chen's spear, she was sent flying out of the heavenly tribulation.

The leader of the Lightning Falcon race was shocked and enraged by this turn of events. “Long Chen, you bastard, how dare you repay her kindness this way?! Just wait, I will tear you into a million pieces!”

He immediately moved to catch Lei Yuner’s body. Her aura had vanished, and even her spiritual fluctuations were gone. Seeing this, he coughed up blood from the torrent of emotions.

“Quick, use the bloodline soul summoning art! Try to save her!” shouted an elder of the Lightning Falcon race.

This elder was the previous leader of the Lightning Falcon race. He was extremely old, but he was still recognized as someone of great virtue and prestige. Now, hundreds of thousands of experts of the Lightning Falcon race used their bloodline power to activate a secret art, trying to save Lei Yuner’s life.

On the other hand, the hall master only glanced at Lei Yuner once before ignoring their efforts. With his Spiritual Strength, he could easily tell that the flame of her soul in her head was gone. She was already dead, so their efforts were futile.

“Bastard, I’ll avenge Yuner!” The race leader even began to weep. He was aware of just how dismal their chances of saving her were.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Yuner isn’t dead. Her soul has been sealed inside her Dantian with thunderforce. Long Chen wouldn’t kill her. He is probably trying to sever any connection we have with him so that we aren’t implicated.” The elder’s voice rang out in the race leader’s mind after he roared. This was a bloodline communication that could only be heard by those of the same race.

The race leader was startled. After that, he hastily checked her Dantian and found that there really was a layer of thunderforce around her Dantian. Through that lightning seal, he could vaguely sense her spiritual fluctuations.

“Don’t let other people notice anything strange. Keep acting angry,” urged the elder.

As the Lightning Falcon race did all they could for Lei Yuner, the eighth prince, Wu Ying, and the others surrounded Long Chen.

However, their expressions were rather grave now. After leaving the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, the heavenly tribulation became explosive, like a sheep that had become a wild tiger. Despite the lightning swords being the same, they were several times sharper than before.

Even they were having trouble dealing with these black lightning swords. They didn’t dare to be careless.

On the other hand, Long Chen simply stood there and allowed the lightning swords to strike his body. They shattered on contact with his body, transforming into black runes that were absorbed by his body.

“Attack!”

The eighth prince roared. His Blood Qi raged as his golden spear pierced toward Long Chen. He started off immediately with one of his strongest attacks.

BOOM!

Long Chen also unleashed his lightning spear. When the two collided, a large expert with golden bull horns on his head also attacked with a vajra scepter. This was the heavenly genius from the Golden Barbarian Bull race.

Long Chen shoved his spear back, blocking the vajra scepter. After that, he twisted his body to dodge a water-thorn that blew right past his cheek and cut off a strand of his hair. Just the sharp wind as it blew by left a bloody cut on Long Chen’s cheek.

It was a silent attack with a perfect angle, the epitome of its kind of attack. It came from the Water Mallard race’s Wu Ying.

“Ah, the flavor of true dragon essence blood really isn’t bad. Now that you’ve killed that slut of the Lightning Falcon race, big sis is starting to like you.” Wu Ying licked the blood on her water-thorn excitedly.

Just from that trace of blood, she sensed a powerful true dragon aura, and that was an irresistible allure.

As Long Chen was pressed back by their attacks, he condensed a lightning spear and shield to fight.

These people’s weapons were divine items with amazing backgrounds. On the other hand, Long Chen didn’t have a suitable weapon.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the tribulation clouds changed and the gates that had been destroyed by Long Chen now returned.

However, this time, only two gates appeared. When they opened, countless lifeforms with sharp claws and covered in black qi came pouring out.

“The black sea’s fiend spirits. As expected, you’ve come.” Long Chen instantly recognized them. These were the fiend spirits that he had encountered in the Netherworld when he was forced to flee into the black sea.

Their numbers were what was truly astonishing. If the ancient corpses before had to be counted in the tens of thousands, these fiend spirits were in the hundreds of millions.

They were like two giant waterfalls pouring out of the sky, charging at them sinisterly.

The eighth prince and the others’ expressions instantly changed. They had thought that the black swords were the final wave, but now there was another.

Those fiend spirits were especially sinister. Looking at them, even World Kings felt cold sweat soaking their backs. They were like ghouls from the depths of hell. They were truly terrifying.

“Kill him!”

The eighth prince finally realized that something was wrong. Before this, they had been able to leave the heavenly tribulation. But now that these fiend spirits appeared, their path out was cut off. He felt uneasy.

The others also felt that something was off. These fiend spirits were endless, and their auras were equivalent to a peak Immortal King. As time passed, they would also be slain by them.

“End the battle quickly!”

This time, it was Wu Ying who attacked first. Water Qi erupted out of her body, and she instantly split into eight clones and attacked Long Chen.

“Well said. Let us end this battle quickly.”

Long Chen sneered. He suddenly extended his hand.

“Saber, come!”

Following his shout, countless saber wielders outside the tribulation were shocked to find their sabers quivering in their sheaths.
