Chapter 3290 Devil Eye Water Lily

That huge dragon flew out all too suddenly, making everyone jump.

“Don’t move!”

Just as they were preparing to fight back, Long Chen stopped them. They knelt down, not moving. The black dragon simply soared into the air and vanished.

Fortunately, the black dragon didn’t notice them. It was most likely going back to the Vile Dragon Valley to hunt.

Everything returned to calm once it was gone. Their hearts settled. Just now, they had almost wet themselves in fear.

Once everything was alright, Long Chen looked down the hole. This time, even he jumped in shock.

There was a giant space inside. It was like a palace. This space was the giant, dead lifeform’s skull cavity.

Also, there was a giant crystal inside, which emitted a gentle light that illuminated this otherwise dark space.

“It’s a devil core!”

Long Chen recognized this light. This devil core belonged to this lifeform. Although the devil energy inside it had long since vanished, its light had yet to extinguish.

There were actually thousands of black dragons surrounding the devil crystal. Long Chen’s guess that this was the black dragon’s nest was correct. But he hadn’t guessed that there would be so many black dragons here.

“There really are dragon eggs! Boss…!”

Bai Xiaole’s gaze instantly fell on over ten large dragon eggs placed together behind one of those dragons.

These eggs were actually white. The moment Bai Xiaole saw them, he grew excited.

The dragons that they had encountered in Vile Dragon Valley might have reached the fifth tier, equivalent to the human race’s Immortal King realm, but then they should only be classified as Mortal tier Immortal Kings. They didn’t even have divine abilities.

However, these black dragons were different. Just their dragon might was enough to suppress those vile dragons. Their tier was definitely far above the vile dragons’. To use the human race’s classifications, they had to be at the Spirit tier or above.

Bai Xiaole looked at Long Chen but found that Long Chen’s eyes were shining. He was staring at a blood pool beside the devil crystal. There was a giant flower growing there.

For the black blood pool to have given birth to a flower as white as jade, it was quite conspicuous. There were nine petals, and it was vaguely possible to see nine differently-colored designs moving across the nine petals. The center of the flower looked like a single eye.

“Devil Eye Water Lily!”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen’s heart pounded. He actually came across the Devil Eye Water Lily at a place like this. That was a terrifying existence on the same level as the Undying Willow. It was a lifeform of the Undying World, and it had actually appeared here.

“Nine petals, nine colors of reincarnation. Also, the devil eye has already formed. According to human standards, it has entered the Immortal King realm. We can’t beat it!”

Only once Long Chen arrived in the immortal world did he learn just how terrifying the Undying Willow race was. As for this Devil Eye Water Lily, it was equally as famous as the Undying Willow race.

If he were to compare it to Liu Ruyan, then if Liu Ruyan was a major realm above him, he would have almost no hope of victory against her. But if she was two major realms above him, then no matter what, he wouldn’t challenge her.

However, the Devil Eye Water Lily in front of him was the main ingredient for refining the Violet Tower Pill. He had to obtain it.

“Could it be like Liu Ruyan? It was sent here by someone to grow? Then this terrifying corpse’s energy…” Long Chen suddenly had a thought that made his heart go wild.

If his guess was correct, then this Devil Eye Water Lily had been planted here just to absorb the energy of the ancient corpse.

Either that, or it was one of the guards arranged for this place to prevent anyone from rebuilding the branch academy.

If it was the latter, then that would be a big problem. With the Devil Eye Water Lily’s terrifying might, it even possessed the power to fight a World King. Long Chen would definitely die in a fight against it.

Long Chen wrestled with his greed. Fight? He definitely couldn’t win. Don’t fight? His disease would kill him.

Once he reached the Divine Lord realm, he could condense the Violet Tower Star. If he missed this chance, who knew when he would get another?

Furthermore, it seemed that the corpse’s nutrients had essentially been sucked dry. Who knew whether this lily would finish eating and then simply leave? He might never find it again.

“Boss, what do you think? Aren’t there so many dragon eggs? Are we doing this or not?” asked Bai Xiaole. He greatly desired those dragon eggs. Right now, he wasn’t afraid of anything and was willing to risk his life for those dragon eggs.

“It seems a bit dangerous!” Long Chen was truly conflicted.

“Didn’t you say that dragon eggs were a must-have just before?” asked Bai Xiaole unhappily. How could his boss eat his words now?

Bai Shishi glared at Bai Xiaole. This place was far too dangerous. One mistake, and they would be wiped out. They couldn’t throw their lives away just for some treasures.

What they didn’t know was that Long Chen didn’t even care about the dragon eggs any longer, nor did he even care about the threat of these black dragons. All his attention was on the Devil Eye Water Lily.

The atmosphere grew tense, and everyone was looking at Long Chen. Jiang Yuhe and the others practically had pleading expressions as they looked at Long Chen. As long as Long Chen agreed to leave, they would be willing to kowtow in thanks to him. They all hoped that he would stop. Even after living for so many years, none of them had ever gone through something as terrifying as they had on this journey.

“We have to. We’ll risk it all.” Long Chen made up his mind. Bai Xiaole was delighted, while Jiang Yuhe and the others almost wept.

“Everyone, listen to my instructions. We must work together. Bai Shishi and I will target the water lily. When we disturb it, we’ll definitely draw the attention of all the dragons. Bai Xiaole, you take advantage of that chaos to steal the dragon eggs. After that, all of you will need to work together to subdue one of the black dragons, putting it under Bai Xiaole’s control as fast as possible. Then we’ll run,” said Long Chen.

“The water lily?”

Everyone was startled. Long Chen was actually targeting the water lily? They had all seen it, but they didn’t notice anything special about it.

“After this, each of your four major powers will be given a black dragon egg. Of course, if you’re unwilling, you can run now. You’ll need to go fast to avoid being implicated when we make our move.” Long Chen looked at the four leaders.

The four of them had mournful expressions. Just how could they refuse? They had long since lost their sense of direction in this dark place. Without Long Chen leading the way, it was unknown whether or not they could even get out of this abyss. They were fully bound to Long Chen. 

As for the black dragon eggs, they might be even more precious than the Spirit King Pills. However, they didn’t dare to even want one. They only wanted to leave alive. Once they returned to the Zhaoming Ancient City alive, it would count as a win.

“Let’s go. We’ll enter through the mouth.” With everyone working together, Long Chen led them sneaking toward the devil dragons’ nest.
