Chapter 2516 The Secret Beneath the Tree

The Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps and the long-tailed poison dragons were blasted to pieces and then burned to ash by the wave of fire.

The Daynight Furnace lit up, enveloping the Pill fairy. Its runes shone and it began to rapidly spin. The Pill Fairy also began to chant, activating the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture to block Long Chen’s flames.

BOOM!

Even the Daynight Furnace that had its full power unleashed was unable to endure the wave of fire and was sent flying. The Pill Fairy coughed up a mouthful of blood, and her chanting was cut off. She was sent tumbling back along with the Daynight Furnace.

“Why?! Why can’t I control these flames even with the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture? Do they only recognize one master? But that’s impossible!” The Pill Fairy was completely bewildered as she flew back.

Based on the records of the Nirvana Scripture, other than the core flames of a person, no one could leave their own mark on other flames. Even the Nirvana Scripture was limited by this. It could summon the power of all flames, but that was only summoning, not a spiritual imprint.

After those flames were unleashed, they wouldn’t have a mark on them. Therefore, it should have been possible to use the Nirvana Scripture to control them again. However, those flames ignored her. It was as if they were still under Long Chen’s control. Or perhaps they only recognized Long Chen’s Nirvana Scripture and not hers.

Filled with questions, the Pill Fairy vanished from view along with the Daynight Furnace.

Yun Tian’s sword flashed. As the wave of flames whistled toward him, he slashed his sword, causing the wave to part and pass by him.

The whistling flames let out an ear-piercing sound when they struck his sword. His body was slowly pushed back.

“What a powerful attack. Even my Sovereign Sword Wind Runner can’t block it.” Yun Tian nodded in praise. This attack was even stronger than he had expected.

This was only the result of being on the outer edge. If struck head-on, there wouldn’t be the slightest trace of him left.

Suddenly, he heard explosions not that far away from him. Following the sound, he saw a giant sphere had been exposed underground. The rock-like sphere was covered by wooden stakes.

The layers of rock and wood were being rapidly stripped away. Yun Tian was startled. This was the defense of the Dragonblood Legion. They had clearly hidden underground, so why had they suddenly run out again?

Yun Tian then realized that Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus had stripped off all the earth covering them, resulting in them becoming exposed.

The sphere was constantly exploding and shrinking. It seemed that there were only a few more layers before it was broken. Startled cries rang out from within.

Yun Tian appeared in front of them, helping the Dragonblood Legion block a portion of the flames. Guo Ran and the others sighed with relief.

“That bastard Long Chen, why didn’t he warn us? Is he trying to kill us?!” raged Mo Nian.

When the most powerful wave of flames had passed and there were only a few remnant flames hanging in the air, the Dragonblood warriors finally came out of their defense.

As soon as they walked out, they felt like they were on a stove. The ground had been leveled and looked like it had been turned to red-hot steel.

Looking around, they didn’t see any trace of the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps or the poison dragons.

Everything had been flattened, and the earth looked like mixed metal. Within this barren land, there was only a single towering tree remaining.

This tree was covered in fire all the way to its crown that extended into the cosmos. However, curiously, despite the tree burning, no branches or dust rained down. It was as if the flames were not burning its body but an outer layer on top of it.

Suddenly, the earth split open and a dwarf crawled out. When he looked around, he laughed. “The heavens are helping me! They’ve actually refined all the immortal gold for me.”

Zhao Ritian slammed his hands on the ground, and the metal land began to surge toward him. The land had been melted by Long Chen’s flames, so the impurities were incinerated, leaving only the strongest immortal and divine ores which had melted.

The ground was filled with countless ores. The reason Zhao Ritian was able to fight for so long was because he was drawing out the energy of those ores for himself.

However, now all those ores had been fully exposed and purified for him. He could absorb them thousands of times faster than his original speed.

The metal ground began to turn dark. As for Zhao Ritian’s aura, it instantly soared, almost reaching its peak.

“Go ahead and absorb it all. Once you’re done, we’ll take it from you.” Guo Ran glared.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion caused everyone to jump.

“Ye Ming didn’t die?!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Everyone hastily flew over to see a giant hole. The altar was still intact within that hole.

The most shocked though were Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan because they saw that the altar was embedded on a giant root like a malignant tumor.

Now that a huge hole had been blasted open by Long Chen, they were able to see the truth. There were countless roots revealed, and cocoons were hanging from them. It was possible to see figures within the cocoons, looking like they were sleeping.

There was a tube connected to their backs, and everyone could see drops of liquid slowly entering their bodies.

“What is going on?!” Guo Ran shivered.

“It’s a reincarnation art most likely. The Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse was left out as bait, but the true goal was to have his subordinates absorb the tree’s nutrients to revive. What a frightening race. They can also be classified as an undying race. The corpses outside were just to hide the true secret here,” said Mo Nian.

It seemed that Ye Ming’s true goal was the lifeforms here. If it hadn’t been for Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus, this secret would have still been unknown to them.

As for the explosions ringing out, they were coming from Long Chen fighting Ye Ming. Yun Tian immediately joined in.

BOOM!

Long Chen and Ye Ming exchanged blows and retreated at the same time. Seeing Yun Tian coming over, Ye Ming entered the barrier of the altar once more.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, I told you that you were wasting your energy. Now, do you believe it? This altar is linked to the tree’s life, and this tree is the core of this world. Don’t underestimate it just because it looks withered. Its core energy is something even ten experts above Netherpassage wouldn’t be able to shake.” Ye Ming laughed as if victory was already within his grasp.

In truth, even Ye Ming had just become aware of how much life energy still remained within the tree. He really had been afraid that Long Chen’s attack would be able to destroy the altar.

Long Chen’s attack had pushed the altar to its limit. However, just as it was about to crumble, it automatically absorbed the tree’s life energy to block it.

Ye Ming was delighted. The remnant life energy within the tree made it so that he didn’t have to worry about anyone breaking the altar.

He had only come out of its protection to test if Long Chen had weakened after unleashing such a big move, however, he found that Long Chen’s power hadn’t dropped. There was no way to take advantage of him.

That was why he immediately hid within his turtle shell once more upon seeing Yun Tian coming.

“Now it’s troublesome. There’s no way to calculate how many lifeforms are hidden beneath the roots. Those aren’t dead spirits. Once they’re revived, they’ll be true warriors. Big brother Yun Tian, do you have a way to handle them?” asked Long Chen.

Yun Tian shook his head. “I was supposed to be the prophesied son with the solution to this problem, but now it’s you. The only one who can solve this predicament is you.”

Long Chen now recalled how the Luo Spirit race had given him the bone tile. At that moment, his position with Yun Tian had been switched. This battlefield should have been led by Yun Tian, but one miscalculation had caused everything to change.

“Alright, I only have one more option. Protect me.”

Long Chen suddenly sat in the air and began to form hand seals. The ball of karmic hell flames within the primal chaos space began to rage.

Long Chen’s divine ring lit up. The position relating to the Divine Gate Star blazed with light.

Suddenly, the flames on the altar that had almost been extinguished began to explode and burn more intensely than ever.

Ye Ming was startled. He shouted to Feng Fei, Zhao Ritian, and the Pill Fairy who were flying back. “Quick! Kill Long Chen!”
