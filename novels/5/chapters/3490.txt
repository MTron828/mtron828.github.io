Chapter 3479 Brother and Sister of the Bai Clan

Standing on the deck, Long Chen felt the sea breeze blow, and his clothes flapped loudly. The giant ship was moving rapidly, but on this endless sea, he was unable to sense its speed.

Long Chen looked at the distant morning sun. Ever since coming to the immortal world, it was his first time feeling the sea breeze. Although the Heavenly Swell Domain had a sea as well, it was the devil sea, a sea of death. So the water was flat.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the other hand, this place was a true sea, filled with life. Flowing across the vast sea, Long Chen felt himself to be so small.

This wasn’t in terms of power but mind. It was a strange feeling. Looking at this endless sea, others might feel fear, but he very much enjoyed it.

Only by feeling just how small he was did he feel like an ordinary commoner. Sometimes living like a regular, ordinary person was real life.

Sometimes Long Chen thought about whether he could live a normal, tranquil life. He would rather not have his current cultivation base and simply accompany his lovers through a peaceful life.

Regretfully, he wasn’t the sea but a raging river; he could not stop. Perhaps that only proved that he wasn’t strong enough.

“Big brother Long Chen!”

Suddenly, a sweet voice drew him out of his stupor. Bai Rui had come. This was already their third day on the ship, and everyone was familiar with each other now. She kept calling him big brother Long Chen the entire time, just like her own big brother.

Seeing this brother and sister come over, Long Chen smiled. “Little Rui, be careful. This is the lower level, and there’s no formation to protect you. You might get chills from the wind.”

There were all sorts of formations on this giant ship. It was unknown if it was intentional or what, but on the low level, the sea breeze was extremely chilly. Even ordinary cultivators would be chilled. Considering Bai Rui’s weak constitution, she was unable to endure even a single day.

“Hehe, I’m not afraid. With big brother Long Chen’s medicinal pill, I’m no longer afraid of the cold!” declared Bai Rui with a giggle.

On that day, seeing her suffer, Long Chen had given her a medicinal pill that gave her a natural resistance to the cold. Now, after seeing that Long Chen was just standing on the deck, she came over with Bai Fang.

Long Chen felt great sympathy for these two. According to Bai Fang, they were once a noble family, but their enemies had massacred them, and their family was destroyed. Of over three thousand people, only the two of them had managed to escape.

Seeing the mournful gaze in their eyes, Long Chen didn’t doubt their words. While fleeing, they hadn’t even had time to gather up any of their family’s treasures.

The two of them had sold off everything they had on them in order to pay for two tickets for the ship. Now, they didn’t even have a single immortal king crystal.

Moreover, the two of them didn’t have much experience out in the world. If it hadn’t been for Long Chen stopping them, they might have casually said their origins in front of everyone.

To others, the Violet Flame Heaven was a place for them to chase their dreams. But to the two of them, it was somewhere they were fleeing to in order to escape their enemies.

After learning about their dismal state, Long Chen grew more amiable toward them, delighting the two of them. Long Chen was someone who didn’t even fear an Immortal King, so he was definitely a peak expert. To be able to make friends with such an expert was an unimaginable fortune for them in their current state.

Just as they were talking, Long Chen suddenly frowned and looked up. He saw someone staring at them from the middle level, either intentionally or unintentionally.

That person pretended that his gaze was simply roving around, and he turned his head in the other direction.

“What is it, big brother Long Chen?” asked Bai Rui, seeing Long Chen’s somewhat odd expression.

“It’s nothing, let’s go back. This place is cold.” Long Chen shook his head and brought the two of them back to their little space.

Although the interior was also cold, it was at least a bit better than the outside. At this time, the blaze of everyone’s excitement had almost been blown out by these cold winds.

Many people were shivering already. This wind was odd and was able to chill them down to their bones. It was like they were in the depths of the sea. Most terrifying of all, this cold breeze seemed to also be able to blow away their Yuan Spirits. Some of the Four Peak disciples felt that in particular.

Furthermore, the most infuriating thing was that the people on the middle level were all having a pleasant time, without the slightest breeze. Now, the people on the lower level even suspected that the Soaring Dragon Company had done this on purpose.

However, they were already on their ship, so they could only listen to the Soaring Dragon Company. They didn’t dare to say anything or unleash their wrath. They could only endure.

Long Chen returned to his space and found that there were a few foreign faces now. They were all Immortal Kings.

Bai Fang also took note of them. Long Chen clearly felt Bai Fang tense up, but he was worried about affecting his little sister, so he acted like he hadn’t seen anything.

“Everyone, this place is the low level, and our Soaring Dragon Company has no duty to activate the formation for you. However, considering your weak constitutions, we are going to give you some special care. The company has decided to activate the formation for you.” Suddenly, a group of experts in lavish clothes walked in, with their leader speaking.

Long Chen eyed that person and sneered. It was the same fellow who had conned Long Chen out of his middle level ticket. He was back. However, Long Chen didn’t immediately do anything. He wanted to see just how shady the Soaring Dragon Company was.

Cheers rang out in the cabin when they heard that the formation would be activated.

However, that man sneered, “But don’t get happy too early. Activating the formation requires a huge number of immortal king crystals. Those immortal king crystals should be paid by you, but my Soaring Dragon Company pities you, so we have decided to help you pay the majority. All of you need to only pay a single immortal king crystal each.”

A hissing sound rang out. It seemed that they wanted more money.

However, those on the low level were all essentially broke. Every immortal king crystal was incomparably precious to them. As for Bai Fang and Bai Rui, their pockets were empty. They were unable to take out an immortal king crystal.

For the others, every single immortal king crystal was being saved for emergencies. What if when they arrived at the Violet Flame Heaven, they didn’t even have a single bit of money? Then they would become beggars.

“Don’t blame me for not warning you. Right now, we are still on the outer edge. Once we enter the deep sea region, especially when crossing the fiend devil sea, the feeling of cold will be a hundred times stronger. Let alone some Four Peak rookies, even Immortal Kings will freeze. Don’t worry, you won’t freeze to death. But your realm might fall and your foundation could be harmed. Hehe, but if you want to risk your life to save money, that’s up to you. Just pretend I didn’t say anything.”

Hearing that it would be a hundred times worse later, everyone was scared. In the end, they could only accept this and take out immortal king crystals.

Long Chen sneered inside. There were millions of experts here. The Soaring Dragon Company was truly a group of scammers. What kind of broken formation required millions of immortal king crystals?

It wasn’t just Long Chen who understood this. However, there was nothing they could do. The price of one immortal king crystal was at least somewhat bearable for them.

Long Chen paid for Bai Fang and Bai Rui. He had Bai Fang hand them over because he was afraid that he would kill that irritating Immortal King if they were face to face. It still wasn’t the time for him to repay his debt.

As expected, money could make even ghosts work. When the formation was activated, the cold breeze instantly vanished. Everything warmed up and everyone was excited. They now felt very comfortable.

“Brother Long, I have something to discuss with you.” Bai Fang suddenly began talking spiritually with Long Chen.

“Speak,” said Long Chen.

“I have a priceless treasure in my hands, but others might have set their sights on it. I beg you to protect our lives. I am willing to give this treasure to you,” said Bai Fang.
