Chapter 3870 Bloodline Summoning

When Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength entered the dragon scale, it was like ice falling into a burning-hot piece of metal. White smoke came out.

Sharp pain directly struck Long Chen’s soul. This was even more painful than his soul igniting. Long Chen’s pain tolerance was already at a high level, yet this pain made his face twist.

“Senior, what’s going on? Why is it rejecting my spiritual brand?” asked Long Chen while clenching his teeth in pain.

“It has been off my body for too long, so it has its own consciousness now. Originally, it was not in this world. This dragon burial land attracted it, and it broke through space to come here to cultivate. By absorbing the energy of these dragon corpses, it protects its divinity and has now evolved. It is using the primal chaos qi and dragon blood energy here to cultivate. Maybe within an additional twenty or thirty thousand years, it will escape its limitations as a dragon scale, becoming a dragon spirit and creating its own cultivation path,” said the dragon expert.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This dragon scale was originally a part of it, but after so many years, it came to possess its own life. In order to protect its divinity, it produced its own consciousness and began to use the laws of heaven and earth to protect itself.

It could be said that the current dragon scale was its own independent body. This matter had slightly exceeded the dragon expert’s expectations.

“Fortunately, it can recognize my fluctuations. It isn’t rejecting you or attacking. That is a good phenomenon. Just keep trying. You’ll succeed sooner or later. In any case, you have powerful Spiritual Strength,” consoled the dragon expert.

However, no matter how powerful Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was, this process was still painful. This soul-burning pain was not something an ordinary person could endure. However, Long Chen had no other choice but to keep unleashing his Spiritual Strength.

An hour later, a humanoid figure gradually appeared on the dragon scale. That figure was Long Chen.

However, this mark was very light. Without paying attention, it wouldn’t be noticed. The good thing was that after it appeared, Long Chen finally had a spot to focus his Spiritual Strength on. It was starting to gather.

When Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was exhausted to the point of only having ten percent left, when his concentration was plummeting and his head grew dizzy, there was finally a reaction. Just as he felt incredibly weak, a dragon scale mark appeared in his mind, and in that instant, he felt spiritually connected to the dragon scale.

“Success!”

Long Chen was revitalized. He had almost been unable to endure this. Due to his Spiritual Strength being so badly exhausted, his spirit was no longer as powerful. He even felt like he was about to fall.

“Success? It’s too early. First, hide inside the dragon scale and recover,” said the dragon expert.

After having his spiritual mark on it, it was like a treasure that had acknowledged him as master. He easily passed through its protective light.

“Heavens! What dense primal chaos qi!” Once he was on the dragon scale, Long Chen cried out excitedly.

He had experienced running into primal chaos qi multiple times. Even in the primal chaos space, the primal chaos qi was now incredibly dense. Just by extending a hand, he could touch the primal chaos mist.

However, here, rather than mist, it was like he was immersed in water. The primal chaos qi was in liquid form. Standing here, he didn’t even need to absorb it. The primal chaos qi was squeezing into his body.

“Don’t randomly shout. Your time is precious. Hurry and recover your Spiritual Strength with the primal chaos qi. Then summon your Dragonblood Legion to absorb the dragon blood,” said the dragon expert. “That little fellow with the ghost fox evil dragon’s inheritance also came here, but he didn’t have the ability to approach my dragon scale. That’s why he went to absorb the essence blood of that golden dragon. Once he finishes, he’ll definitely come here. He can’t take my dragon scale, but he might ruin things for you, so hurry up.”

Long Chen didn’t tarry. He summoned his divine ring and sucked in the primal chaos qi. In less than an incense stick’s worth of time, his almost completely exhausted Spiritual Strength was fully recovered.

It wasn’t just recovered to its previous state, but it was now even stronger and purer. Long Chen’s divine sense could stretch even further, and he felt closer to heaven and earth.

Long Chen then took out a tablet and injected his Spiritual Strength inside. Countless runes lit up on it.

“What are you doing?” asked the dragon expert.

“I’m summoning my brothers. Isn’t that what you said?” Long Chen was dumbfounded.

“Fool! This tablet will only reach the Dragonblood warriors in Clear Sky City. What about the other Dragonblood warriors?”

“Uh…?” Long Chen was still dumbfounded, but he quickly thought of something. He cried out, “Senior, do you have a way to summon them?!”

“Of course. All the members of your Dragonblood Legion cultivate the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. Use the power of the dragon scale to unleash a bloodline summons. As long as the Dragonblood warriors are within the three thousand worlds, no matter what corner they are in, they will definitely sense it. I will transmit the summoning mnemonic right now. Memorize it.” The dragon expert quickly taught Long Chen a set of very strange syllables.

Long Chen focused intently on it. After a moment of reflection, all those syllables came out in a roar.

A majestic dragon roar then pierced through heaven and earth, and a golden ripple spread in every direction, crossing mountains and charging past rivers.

This roar was like a spiritual summon. Formless energy was spreading throughout every corner of the three thousand worlds. It didn’t matter if they were at the peak of a mountain or deep underground, or even in seclusion behind powerful formations, all the Dragonblood warriors opened their eyes at the same time. They then rose and began flying toward one place.

This dragon roar hung in the air for a long time. At this time, Long Chen felt like a dragon god in control of heaven and earth. He even sensed that countless Dragonblood warriors had heard his summons and were flying toward him. He felt like he was overlooking this entire world.

Long Chen grew emotional and his eyes reddened. His brothers were finally going to reunite with him. He missed them so much.

“Senior, can I absorb the essence blood now?” asked Long Chen. He was itching to start.

“No, not yet.”

“Why not?”

“You must wait until your Dragonblood warriors arrive. Once there are people protecting you, you can start absorbing the dragon blood. After all, the huge disturbance will draw countless experts over. Without others to protect you, you will definitely die,” said the dragon expert.

“How big of a disturbance?” asked Long Chen in shock.

“Let me put it to you this way. Beneath the dragon scale is the primal chaos source. Once you start absorbing the dragon blood, the primal chaos source will erupt. This amount of primal chaos qi will look like a child’s peeing in comparison to that eruption. They are completely incomparable. At that time, all the experts in the three thousand worlds will charge over like madmen. Whether it is the natives or the foreigners, they will come. As for you, you will be in a weak state and unable to retaliate. Without anyone to protect you, you will definitely die,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen’s heart sank. If that was the case, was he not becoming enemies with the entire world?

“Boss!”

Just then, two quivering voices rang out. Long Chen saw two muscular men shooting toward him like shooting stars. The earth constantly quivered, as if excited by their arrival.

Long Chen was incomparably moved when he saw them. His eyes teared up. These two were Li Qi and Song Mingyuan.
