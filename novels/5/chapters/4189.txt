Chapter 4178: Auction Chips

These pictures were embedded within refined crystals, with runes flowing on top of them, sealing the ancient pictures inside. They seemed to come from various sources like bone books and beast hides, and each of them portrayed a bronze cauldron.

Most of these pictures could be split into two depictions. One of those two was the cauldron in Long Chen’s hand, but there was a completely different set of runes in the others.

“Not good! The Heaven Earth Cauldron is made of the Earth Cauldron and Heaven Cauldron, and their runes are completely different!” Long Chen looked at the fake that Xia Chen and Guo Ran had just made, feeling dumbfounded.

If the Heaven Cauldron had completely different runes, how was he supposed to sell it afterward? This was different from his plan. He couldn’t con people like this.

“Everyone, take a look. Amongst these pictures, there are two types of cauldrons. They should be quite trustworthy. However, Long Chen’s Heaven Earth Cauldron only matches one of them. Thus, our Soaring Dragon Company does not dare to arrogantly declare anything. We can only say that this cauldron is not a fake item. But whether or not it is the true Heaven Earth Cauldron cannot be said,” said the head appraiser.

When these pictures were revealed, the experts present were befuddled. The Soaring Dragon Company didn’t dare to guarantee the veracity of this item because they were afraid of the responsibility.

However, their meaning was very clear now. This item was definitely something ancient; there was nothing faking it. But whether or not it was the Heaven Earth Cauldron, they refused to say. It would be up to each individual’s own opinion.

With this, everyone was conflicted. Looking at this cauldron, they felt that it really might be the real deal.

“Long Chen, how are you selling this cauldron? What do we trade for it?” asked someone.

“If I don’t know whether it’s real or not, how am I supposed to sell it?” Long Chen frowned.

.

“We don’t know if it’s real or not either! It’s a gamble. Gambling is dangerous. Whether you win or not is partly luck and partly your own vision. So, why don’t you just declare a price? If it’s acceptable, we’ll be willing to take a gamble. However, if you ask for a lion’s bite, then we’re not foolish enough to risk it all considering that we can’t know the authenticity of it. Other than that, let me just say that this thing is a hot potato. If you have the ability to keep it, then that’s one thing. If you don’t have though, then hehe, don’t lose your money and life together.” A sinister voice came from the room emitting devil qi.

“Tch, you’re threatening me? Did you think that I’m a coward?” Long Chen sneered. “Given my temper, I’d refuse to sell it and see just what you could say. However, a person like you can’t represent everyone. Many people want to sincerely buy it, and I can’t punish them all just because of you alone. I can’t waste their time for nothing. This bronze cauldron’s origins are unclear, and the crafty fellows from the Soaring Dragon Company never tell the truth. Who knows whether they are secretly planning on buying it for themselves?”

“Long Chen, don’t slander others!” shouted the innate Heaven Venerate who had been Long Chen’s liaison.

“Alright, well, I won’t bother arguing with you. Let’s put it this way: I cannot say whether or not this is the true Heaven Earth Cauldron. However, it has once struck an Eternal divine weapon, and I’m sure most people have heard of it. Thus, it is at least a top grade Eternal divine weapon. I won’t be greedy. You can trade for it with either Eternal divine weapons or corpses of Eternal experts. However, the corpses can’t belong to the human race, Spirit race, or other kind races,” said Long Chen.

“Corpses?!”

An uproar exploded. What did Long Chen want Eternal corpses for?

“One for one?” asked someone.

“Can you use your brain? At least one for three. If you don’t even have three, don’t even offer,” sneered Long Chen.

“One for three? Are you joking? Inheritances with tens of millions of years of history don’t even have a single Eternal divine weapon! But you dare ask for three?!”

“If you want to trade, then trade. If you don’t, then scram. This is an auction, not a charity. If you don’t have the money, then don’t speak. Did you spend everything on this room?” retorted Long Chen.

That person didn’t reveal himself. He was in a private room and was also an innate Heaven Venerate.

“You…!” Long Chen was clearly not placing him in his eyes.

“Silence. This is my treasure, and what I say counts. I’m rather direct, so don’t waste your time. I’ll only give you one chance to buy it. I want either three Eternal divine weapons or three perfectly intact Eternal corpses. In my opinion, Eternal corpses and Eternal divine weapons are of equal value. This bronze cauldron suspected to be the Heaven Earth Cauldron is now on auction! Don’t miss this chance, because once you miss it, you won’t get another! The auction starts now!” shouted Long Chen.

However, everyone was deathly silent, and no one declared a bid. The Soaring Dragon Company’s people sneered inside. Without proper preparation, starting off with such a high bid would naturally chill the enthusiasm of the crowd.

They were actually hoping for Long Chen to be unable to sell the cauldron. That way, they wouldn’t have to pay him his commission fee.

In truth, they weren’t really planning on paying that fee in the first place. Moreover, Long Chen had intentionally ruined their auction. According to the agreement, Long Chen actually owed them some compensation.

Seeing the cold crowd, Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit anxious. He directly said, “I’ll count to three. After that, I’ll be taking the Heaven Earth Cauldron away. One…”

“Two…”

Long Chen didn’t give them any time to hesitate. He directly counted to two, so quickly like he didn’t want anyone to bid.

As a result, quite a few people panicked. They seemed to realize something, and just as Long Chen was about to count to three, someone made a bid.

“Three Eternal demonic beast corpses!”

This shout came from a devil expert. So, upon hearing this, the expressions of quite a few demonic beast experts sank.

Eternal demonic beast corpses were absolute treasures, but that devil expert actually had three of their corpses? These demonic beast experts suddenly had an ugly thought.

The demonic beast race and the devil race’s relationship was never friendly. Thus, this bid instantly drew out their hatred.

“There’s nothing to be surprised about. We gathered these corpses on immemorial battlefields. It’s not like we killed them,” sneered that devil expert in front of their furious gazes.

Despite his mocking tone, many could discern his underlying nervousness. His explanation revealed his desire to divert their attention from the matter.

He was in a private room and didn’t expose his face, so no one would know who it was. But to make such an explanation, it seemed even he was extremely cautious about such a matter.

Long Chen simply ignored it. It didn’t matter where the corpses came from. He would accept them all.

“Excellent. Room seven has bid! Three Eternal demonic corpses going once!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Long Chen’s gaze swept over the crowd, and he quickly shouted, “Three Eternal demonic corpses going twice!”

“Three Eternal demonic corpses going-!”

Long Chen was about to smash his hammer down when someone coldly said, “Four Eternal devil corpses.”
