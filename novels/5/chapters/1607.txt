Chapter 1602 Both Sides Profiting

Translator: BornToBe

A pillar of white water was pouring into Long Chen’s primal chaos space. It rained down on the World Trees. During this time, the World Trees had grown to twelve thousand meters.

However, the larger they were, the slower they grew. After reaching twelve thousand meters, if he didn’t focus on circulating the primal chaos bead, he wouldn’t be able to sense them growing at all.

At this size, the World Trees were able to provide him with a huge amount of life energy. The entire primal chaos space was filled with them. The World Trees were able to give him enough life energy that he wasn’t afraid of being injured at all.

However, this was far from their limit. Their limit was several times this height.

The larger the World Trees grew, the more life energy they contained. However, that also meant it would take more energy for them to grow. Long Chen estimated that if he spent day and night circulating the primal chaos bead, he would be able to nourish the World Trees to their limit in around ten years.

If he didn’t intentionally circulate the primal chaos bead, then it would take a thousand years. However, Long Chen didn’t have even a year to focus on doing this. He couldn’t even squeeze out a month. He had no time to focus on nourishing the World Trees.

However, the white water was able to nourish them, allowing them to rapidly grow. In just a few breaths’ time, they reached fifteen thousand meters.

Long Chen was delighted. There was no way for him to directly absorb this white water, but seeing that the World Trees could absorb it, it meant that this white water was a priceless treasure to him.

As Long Chen crazily absorbed the white water, the woman’s eyes grew larger, and she covered her mouth.

This white water here could not be directly absorbed. She had managed to obtain a special flying boat that could enter the water and collect it. However, its gathering speed was measured in drops.

She had already been here for a while and only managed to gather a dozen bottles of it. In truth, offering Long Chen a bottle just now had been extremely generous of her.

“Hey, if you're so amazing, can you get me some too?” asked the woman.

“No problem.”

Long Chen smiled. In any case, this water didn’t belong to him, and this woman wasn’t bad. Although she had mocked him before, her offer to give him a bottle of it was a rare show of kindness in the cultivation world.

Suddenly, the world rumbled. A sensation of danger filled Long Chen’s heart.

The woman’s expression also changed. She looked around, terrified. The nine lakes were all trembling as a terrifying pressure descended.

Long Chen hastily stopped absorbing the water. Once he stopped, the pressure slowly faded.

“I’ve reached the limit? It won’t let me take any more?” wondered Long Chen.

He looked at the World Trees inside the primal chaos space. They had grown to twenty-four thousand meters.

“How could this be? It doesn’t let others take too much?” asked the woman.

“I don’t know either. When I was taking the black water, I ran into the same thing,” said Long Chen.

“You even took the death spirit water?” exclaimed the woman.

Only now did Long Chen learn that the black water was called death spirit water.

“Didn’t you want this black water? Take out a storage device and I’ll give you some,” said Long Chen.

The white water had rained down on the primal chaos space. It was quickly absorbed by the soil. Now the only bits remaining were some droplets on the leaves of the World Trees.

“Here, here!” The woman hastily gave Long Chen a translucent bottle. Looking at this bottle, Long Chen was dumbfounded. It was only the size of a fist. It was so small that he looked at her curiously.

“This bottle is made of special material. Other storage devices wouldn’t be able to bring this life spirit water out of the Netherworld,” she said helplessly.

Alright then. Long Chen took the bottles she gave him into the primal chaos space. Just the droplets on a single leaf were enough to fill them completely.

He handed over a hundred bottles back to the woman. She immediately smiled brightly.

“Thank you! Although you look very fierce and not like a good person, your heart’s not bad,” thanked the woman as she gently caressed the bottles.

“If you removed the first half, I’d feel more moved,” said Long Chen speechlessly.

“Hehe, who asked you to look so fierce? You look like such a bad person! Come have a seat on my flying boat.” The woman brought Long Chen onto the flying boat. Its interior was not bad, but what made Long Chen curious was that while its exterior was similar to the flying boats of the Martial Heaven Continent, its interior was completely different. The shape and designs of the interior were things he had never seen before.

The control panel in particular was covered in various characters that he didn’t recognize at all.

He sat down on a soft chair. There was a tea set in front of him, and the woman sat on the other side of the table, facing him. She was still holding the small bottles with a satisfied smile.

“Hehe, this time I have really profited. I spent all my savings to rent this flying boat, but this life spirit water is enough to get a huge return on that investment. It’ll be enough for my tuition,” laughed the woman.

“Your tuition?” asked Long Chen.

“Ah, just don’t ask about that. I’m not from the same plane as you, and you wouldn’t understand my explanation either way. Fortunately, this flying boat had some special functions, allowing me to communicate with you. Otherwise, we wouldn’t even be able to understand what the other was saying. Speaking of which, what kind of ancient place do you come from? Based on what the flying boat says, your language is extremely old. Theoretically, no one in existence should still be using such a language,” said the woman curiously.

“It’s hard for me to answer that question. I don’t even know how to describe where I live. Even if I said the name, you wouldn’t recognize it. I don’t even know what a star-field is,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen was sure that he was a frog at the bottom of a well now. The world was far larger than he had imagined. The Martial Heaven Continent was just a speck of dust within the cosmos.

“That’s too bad. Once we leave, we’ll probably never see each other again. Originally, I was hoping to repay you for this favor once I finished my studies!” said the woman sadly.

“It’s fine, I’m not in the habit of forcing people to repay me favors. How fast can this flying boat of yours cross the lakes?” asked Long Chen.

“Pretty fast. A single lake should only take a dozen breaths,” said the woman.

A dozen breaths? Long Chen was shocked. It seemed this flying boat really was something good.

“Do you want to get more life spirit water?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course I want to, but it can only be taken out with these special bottles. My bottles are already full.”

“As long as you want it, we can cooperate. My guess is that the life spirit water and death spirit water must be balanced to maintain an equilibrium between life and death. Just taking one breaks the equilibrium and touches the rules here. However, if we take both continuously, we should be able to get more. If you’re willing to test it, you bring your flying boat and I bring my abilities, and I guarantee your profits will increase by at least ten thousand times.”

“Ten thousand times? Are you sure you’re not conning me?” asked the woman suspiciously.

“I do con people often, but I wouldn’t con a child like you. Don’t worry about it.”

“Alright, I’ll trust you. In any case, this doesn’t have any drawbacks for me,” said the woman, sending the boat back toward the black lake.

What startled Long Chen was that the flying boat’s speed seemed very slow, but it seemed to break through space. They reached the red lake in just a moment.

Furthermore, even when going through the blue lake, the terrifying Ice Qi was completely blocked by the flying boat.

Long Chen sighed inside. The world was truly large. Just this flying boat was incomprehensible to him. If he could let Guo Ran take a look at this flying boat, he would go crazy.

For Long Chen though, he was more interested in this woman. Her cultivation base revealed fluctuations similar to a Yuan Spirit but also a bit different.

However, the two of them weren’t friends, so it wasn’t convenient for him to ask her what her origin was.

They quickly arrived at the edge of the black lake. “My flying boat can easily go through the other regions, but the only exception is this black lake. My flying boat can’t be touched by this death spirit water,” said the woman.

Long Chen nodded. He took out his black little boat and began to collect the black water again. He also didn’t extract too much at once. Instead, he collected it slowly as a test. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

As expected, his guess was correct. After gathering the life spirit water, he was able to gather more of the death spirit water.

With this confidence, he continued gathering more. It wasn’t long before the world began to rumble once more. Long Chen immediately stopped.

He returned to the white region with the woman’s boat and gathered the life spirit water.

After ten trips, Long Chen’s World Trees had reached their limit. They were a true, towering forest now.

As for the black soil, there was now a giant black lake inside it. That was all death spirit water.

Long Chen didn’t disappoint the woman. He pasted the spatial runes within the primal chaos space onto her special bottles, increasing their interior space. They could now hold tens of thousands of times more life spirit water than before.

The woman almost went crazy with joy. After gathering so much life spirit water, she hesitated and then suddenly asked, “I know somewhere that will definitely have treasures. Are you interested?”
