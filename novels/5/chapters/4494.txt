Chapter 4483 Terrifying Saint Talisman

"Blocking an Eternal divine weapon barehanded?!”

Seeing this scene, even Long Chen couldn’t help but jump in shock. This little fellow Xia Chen was being a bit too arrogant, no? He could easily lose his life like this.

BANG!

Just then, the hatchet-wielding Doyen slammed one of his weapons onto Xia Chen’s palm, causing the entire world to tremble from his explosive power.

To everyone’s surprise, Xia Chen’s palm remained unscathed. A talisman affixed to his palm, exuding a sacred aura.

“The aura of a Saint?!”

Long Chen suddenly realized that this talisman had to be crafted with Saint essence blood. It was no wonder that Xia Chen dared to be so arrogant.

Blood sprayed out of the hatchet-wielding Doyen, and he trembled from the impact.

He had never imagined that Xia Chen would possess such terrifying power. The backlash almost killed him in an instant. Even though he survived, his arm was numb, and his insides were shaken.

Seeing him vomit blood while he was the one attacking, both friends and foes were astounded. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

“You’re going to kill me? How are you going to do that? How about I kill you instead?”

Xia Chen pushed the hatchet aside slowly with his right hand and raised his left hand. After that, a talisman moved from his left palm to his opponent’s chest.

Suddenly, Xia Chen’s left hand lit up, and a beam of light pierced straight through that Doyen’s chest.

It not only pierced through him but also left a giant hole in the void. With spatial blades swirling within it, the giant hole looked like a gaping maw.

Xia Chen’s attack was absolutely terrifying, leaving that powerful Doyen with no chance to resist, slaying him swiftly in two moves.

“What a shame. He got to show off instead of me. He did tell me that he had just finished his two Saint talismans yesterday and was looking for a chance to test their power,” sighed Guo Ran.

“Xia Chen really is a genius to have come up with Saint talismans so quickly. Although there’s still a difference in power compared to the attacks of a real Saint, below the Saint level, perhaps no one can block these talismans,” said Long Chen.

Xia Chen was truly brilliant. He had made these Saint talismans by studying the runes on the corpses of Saints, without anyone teaching him the process. He had come up with it based on his own intellect, showcasing a monstrous talent in this field.

After gathering his opponent’s hatchets, Xia Chen returned to his spot behind Long Chen as if nothing had happened.

“Hey, there must be more of you who want to challenge us, right? Come, I’m the weakest of everyone here, so just challenge me! If you miss this chance, you won’t get another…!” After Xia Chen managed to show off so brilliantly, Guo Ran was unwilling to leave things as they were and immediately started shouting.

However, this provocation wasn’t very effective. These experts were still in shock because of Xia Chen’s terrifying attack.

In one blow, a powerful Doyen met his demise. Hence, they thought that if Xia Chen wanted to kill them, he could just do it without a problem. However, they didn’t know that… Xia Chen had only made two Saint talismans, and he had just used them.

Despite maintaining a calm expression, Xia Chen was screaming inside. These two Saint talismans were still in the prototype stage, and he wasn’t certain of the full extent of their power.

The purpose of this duel was to test the practicality of these two talismans. Having not expected the two prototypes to possess such terrifying power, Xia Chen immediately wanted to go into seclusion and perfect these talismans.

“Hey, what are you waiting for? Weren’t you shouting about fighting just before? What happened to your pride and arrogance? Were they all fake? Are you afraid? How about I tie one hand behind my back? If that’s still not enough, you can come at me together!” Guo Ran continued to provoke them.

These people were furious, but the sight of Xia Chen slaying that Doyen had been seared into their minds, terrifying them so much that they didn’t dare to fight.

“Hmph, what’s the point of being so arrogant? Once my race’s number one genius comes out of seclusion, you’ll only be able to flee for your lives!” snorted one person.

“That’s right, Long Chen, just you wait! Soon the real experts will come to find you! Don’t keep cowering like a tortoise!” Numerous shouts rang out as they mentioned several names, but no one had ever heard of these names before.

Seeing them resort to just shouts, Long Chen and the others knew that the battle was over today. These people were too afraid to fight themselves.

Long Chen coldly replied, “The High Firmament Academy is a pure land that doesn’t like bad guests crowding it. I’ll count to three, and if you don’t scram, don’t blame me for slaughtering you all. One!”

BOOM!

The instant Long Chen started counting, countless experts scattered like birds. Some heavenly geniuses didn’t even bother taking their tents, and before Long Chen could count to two, they were all gone.

They all knew his ruthlessness. If they didn’t run, that would give Long Chen an excuse to kill them, and not one of them would survive then.

“What trash. These people need to be put in their place,” sneered the Dragonblood warriors.

“Long Chen, what are you smiling about?” Bai Shishi suddenly saw Long Chen smiling strangely.

“Hehe, it’s nothing,” chuckled Long Chen.

“Keep acting mysterious. I’m not talking to you.” Bai Shishi snorted and turned away.

Long Chen was smiling because he had just seen a new fruit condense on the Heavenly Dao Tree. Furthermore, it had two stars on it.

In other words, his guess was correct. There were huge differences between Heavenly Doyens.

The hatchet-wielding Doyen stood out as a powerful expert among the Doyens today, causing Long Chen to order Xia Chen to eliminate him. Xia Chen successfully carried out his mission, using two Saint talismans to slay the powerful Doyen. Consequently, Long Chen acquired a two-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit.

The matter of the Heavenly Doyen Fruit couldn’t be spread, as it carried huge implications and potentially some karma. Hence, Long Chen had to deal with it personally.

Returning to the academy, the academy’s disciples unleashed heaven-shaking cheers, gathering to welcome them back. Xia Chen and the others’ display had been the greatest show for them.

Furthermore, upon their return, Long Chen and the others were astonished to see formidable Doyens and numerous budding Doyens among the academy’s disciples.

Long Chen nodded inside. As expected, the academy’s foundation was truly shocking. They actually also had the ability to create Doyens.

When they got to their residence, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole went to see Bai Letian. One reason was to pay respects to their grandfather, while another was to probe his attitude. Did he have any new instructions for them?

Long Chen had actually been planning on seeing Bai Letian himself. However, he had a pressing matter to deal with now, so he couldn’t do so. As he returned to his own room, he waited a moment, and someone soon knocked on his door.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you were looking for me?” The person who had come to see him was Mu Qingyun.

Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the others had also returned to the academy. Long Chen had called Mu Qingyun over.

“Yes. I have something important that I need your help with today. Don’t tell anyone about this matter,” said Long Chen solemnly.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Mu Qingyun hastily nodded. As she had absolute trust in Long Chen, she would do whatever he told her to do.

Long Chen had Mu Qingyun consume a one-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit and paid close attention to her. Once she consumed it, her aura rapidly changed, and three days later, she had awakened as a Doyen. She now had a feeling like she was the master of this world.

“Here’s another one.”

Long Chen then passed the two-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit to her. He was full of anticipation.
