Chapter 3953 Beating Up Eunuch Wei

Long Chen hadn’t expected Eunuch Wei to suddenly appear here. But upon looking at the sinister smile hanging on his face, Long Chen knew that he was up to no good.

To his surprise, the princes and princesses all stood up when this eunuch appeared. It seemed that his status was not something that they could disrespect.

Long Chen hadn’t expected a single eunuch to possess such prestige. It seemed that he had underestimated him.

Eunuch Wei’s arrival startled everyone. Why would the emperor wish to see Long Chen? Just what kind of background did he have?

The Vermilion Bird Empire’s emperor was not an existence that just anyone could see. However, Long Chen was specifically named to see him? Because of this, countless people began to make guesses about his background.

At this moment, Eunuch Wei strode purposefully toward Long Chen, his smile revealing a malevolent glint in his eyes. Trailing behind him was a group of Supreme Divine Venerates.

However, they all stared at Long Chen coldly, their gazes exuding an innate arrogance. Even in front of the princes and princesses, their faces were icy, not even looking at them.

“Long Chen, I’ve waited a long time for you. You’ve finally appeared. Ah, I’ve reported your matter to his majesty, so shouldn’t you thank me? Hahaha!” Eunuch Wei laughed, feeling very pleased with himself.

Clearly, he had told the emperor about Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan. Moreover, he had definitely embellished the narrative with unfavorable details, designed to cast Long Chen in a negative light.

He knew that Long Chen would come here, so he had long since set up eyes around the city. In truth, the moment Long Chen appeared outside the capital and clashed with the crown prince, someone already went to report Long Chen’s arrival to him.

The reason Eunuch Wei only arrived now was because he had gone to see the emperor first. After he got to meet the emperor, he wasted no time in divulging the news of Long Chen's presence. By skillfully interjecting some extra details, he managed to bring an imperial summons for Long Chen.

Hence, he was exceptionally pleased with himself now, thinking that he had already won. Now, he was just waiting to see how Long Chen would be executed.

“Oh, Eunuch Wei, why are you smiling so brilliantly? What happened? Have you been short of money lately that you were forced to work as a prostitute?” Long Chen smiled.

Upon hearing Long Chen’s words, everyone jumped in shock. Eunuch Wei was one of the emperor’s personal servants. Did Long Chen not want his life anymore?

As anticipated, a cold expression replaced Eunuch Wei's smile, and a flicker of murderous intent glimmered in his eyes. “Let me see just how long you can act this arrogant. You should know your place and obey the rules.”

“Well, you won’t get to live to see how long I can be arrogant,” said Long Chen lightly.

Eunuch Wei smiled sinisterly. “There is no Xia Guhong to protect you now. Without his support, your status is even lower than a dog’s, but you still dare to come to the Vermilion Bird Empire to propose? Why don’t you take a piss first and look at your own reflection there? Do you think that princess Qingxuan is someone that you can touch?”

“Princess Qingxuan?!”

The crowd was startled. This black-robed man had come to propose to princess Qingxuan? It had to be known that princess Qingxuan was said to have inherited the Vermilion Bird Empire’s strongest Jiuli bloodline. Was this little fellow crazy?

As for Yu Qianxue who had wanted to wager with Long Chen, she was startled. So Long Chen’s target was actually Yu Qingxuan. Thinking of how he had rejected her wager, she was angry.

“Take a piss and look at my reflection? I really haven’t done that before. Can you give me a demonstration? I wonder… did your respected-self piss while standing or squatting?” Long Chen’s smile didn’t even twitch in front of Eunuch Wei’s mocking.

At this moment, everyone fell deathly silent. Even the Divine Venerates accompanying Eunuch Wei were struck with astonishment as their gaze fixated upon Long Chen, their expressions a mix of disbelief and incredulity.

Long Chen’s words had just touched upon a major taboo for any eunuch. It was the greatest insult for them.

As expected, Eunuch Wei’s face twisted with fury. “You little brute! You-!”

Before Eunuch Wei could finish, Long Chen already swung out his hand.

In one breath, Long Chen had slapped Eunuch Wei thirty-six times in the face. After he finished, before those Divine Venerates could even react, Long Chen was holding Eunuch Wei’s throat, lifting him into the air.

Eunuch Wei's hairless face, once plump with a healthy layer of fat, now bore the marks of repeated blows. It had swelled to three times its normal size, resembling nothing short of a grotesque pig's head.

“Stop!”

It was only now that those Divine Venerates recovered from their shock. They had never dreamed that a little Immortal King would dare to strike someone here, so they brandished their weapons.

However, Long Chen didn’t even look at those weapons. Instead, he icily stared at Eunuch Wei. “Do you want to try cursing me again?”

Although Eunuch Wei was shocked and enraged, he couldn’t unleash any power as his throat was caught. In that one moment of carelessness, his life was caught in Long Chen’s grasp.

“Release Eunuch Wei, or don’t blame us for being merciless!” shouted one Divine Venerate.

“If you dare to attack me, I will crush this white-skinned pig. If you don’t believe me, try it. Boss Long San never submits to threats,” said Long Chen coldly.

“You…!”

They had never seen someone so arrogant in this lifetime. This guy was practically lawless.

“Oh really? What if I were to demand that you let him go?”

Suddenly, the void quivered and a voice came from a great distance, shaking the world, invading people’s souls with its unquestionable might.

As soon as that voice rang out, everyone present, be it the princes and princesses, scholars or commoners, all knelt on the ground.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This voice spread far and wide with immense divine might, shaking the entire Vermilion Bird City.

“Your majesty, this person is too arrogant! He looks down on your dignity and laws, and he even wishes to lay his hand on the princess! He deserves to be killed!” Eunuch Wei immediately shouted when he heard this voice.

As a result, Long Chen slapped him thirty-six times again. Now, his swollen face split open and bled, looking like it was on the verge of exploding.

“I told you, Boss Long San doesn’t submit to threats, not from anyone. Try it again.” Long Chen looked at the almost crippled Eunuch Wei in his hand.

“Brat, you’ve got guts!”

As this roar rang throughout the city, the entire city began to quiver.

“You’re right, my guts have always been big. Otherwise, how would I dare to come to the Vermilion Bird Empire by myself to take a wife?” Long Chen shrugged in front of this imperial rage.

“Brat, come see me now!” A roar once more rang out.

Long Chen simply tossed Eunuch Wei to the ground, eliciting a pained grunt from him. As Eunuch Wei attempted to rise, Long Chen ruthlessly stomped a foot on his head, causing the very bricks beneath them to shatter and explode. As a result, Eunuch Wei's head was mercilessly driven into the ground, leaving a big imprint.

However, acting as if he had done nothing at all, Long Chen swaggered away.

All the experts then looked from the unconscious Eunuch Wei whose head was in the ground, to that arrogant figure that was walking away from them, feeling supremely dumbfounded.

“Just where does this fellow come from?”
