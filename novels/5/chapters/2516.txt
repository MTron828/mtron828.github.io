Chapter 2506 Wilde’s Terrifying Power

“A divine treasure like this is a waste in my hands,” said Meng Qi, not daring to accept.

“Big sister, you have to take it. You have the strongest soul energy. This Void Mirror is perfect for you,” urged Tang Wan-er.

Only then did Meng Qi take the Void Mirror. Its crystals emitted divine light that illuminated her already peerless looks. It felt as if this mirror had been made for her. They both set off each other’s beauty.

“Wan-er, I have something good for you too.” Long Chen took out a divine bone.

“What’s this? It’s trying to merge into my body.” Tang Wan-er jumped when she touched it. The divine bone was starting to merge with her.

“This is a divine bone. When you merge with it, you will develop a Spirit Bone. It is said that the Spirit Root, Spirit Blood, and Spirit Bone are requirements for becoming a Sovereign. If lady Wan-er one day becomes Sovereign Wan-er, remember to look after this junior brother.” Long Chen smiled.

“A divine bone?” Everyone was shocked. An item that could create a Spirit Bone was a treasure on the heaven-defying level.

“Long Chen, I…” Wan-er’s hand trembled, her eyes reddening. Long Chen was actually giving such a precious divine bone to her.

Long Chen rubbed her head. “This one is for you. You’re the only one capable of using the wind attribute divine bone.”

When Long Chen had obtained the wind divine bone, the first thing he had thought of was the cute and vexatious Tang Wan-er. In truth, he felt quite guilty toward her because Tang Wan-er was the kind of girl who liked to live freely and vivaciously. But by being with him, other than acting a bit petty occasionally, she never complained.

“You can’t fully merge with it now. It is said it can only merge with someone above the Netherpassage realm. But you can try to commune with it for now as a foundation for the merger,” said Long Chen.

“Wilde!” Long Chen now called Wilde. Curiously, he hadn’t seen Wilde this entire time.

“Big brother Long Chen!” Suddenly, a rough voice rang out from the distance. Long Chen saw Wilde running over while carrying two corpses of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders. One of them had several teeth marks on it.

Crunching sounds rang out from Wilde’s mouth. Seeing that he even dared to eat the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders, Mo Nian shivered. Their armor was something that even divine items had difficulty piercing, but Wilde was eating them easily.

Furthermore, it seemed that their poison and disgusting aura of decay were nothing to Wilde. He was happy eating them as if they were meat buns. Even Long Chen felt his stomach heaving. This child’s teeth and stomach were also heaven-defying.

“Can you really eat these?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, they’re delicious! They’re full of energy.” In just a few bites, Wilde stuffed those two corpses into his stomach. “Did you call for me?”

Long Chen felt speechless inside. Wilde really wasn’t picky about food. Even something with poison that could kill Netherpassage experts could be eaten. The Barbarian race was truly mystical.

Guo Ran and the others had given Wilde the corpses of the beasts that they had slain on the way. Wilde’s body hadn’t changed too much, but there were now some golden spots all over it. The two horns on his head in particular looked as if they were made of gold. Wilde’s body seemed to contain a terrifying beast within.

Wilde’s arms were thicker than a normal person’s waist. His skin had a shine to it like dragonhide.

As the other Dragonblood warriors slaughtered the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders, he was the only one who dared to run aside and consume their corpses. No matter how they tried to bite him, they were unable to pierce his skin. He liked that. He could just sit there and reach out for food.

Long Chen had originally thought that with the dragon king’s essence blood, his physical body would have surpassed Wilde’s power, but he knew that without his Azure Dragon Battle Armor, he wouldn’t dare to let the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders attack him like that.

Thinking about how terrifying Wilde had become, it truly made a person envious. Without needing to comprehend the Heavenly Daos or bitterly cultivate, without needing to train in magical arts, Wilde simply ate and slept. Just like that, he constantly grew stronger. Guo Ran in particular was envious.

Guo Ran also didn’t like cultivating, but he didn’t have Wilde’s fate. With the Dragonblood Legion’s cultivation speed soaring, he had to follow. It was unknown how bitter that was. He dreamed of having Wilde’s ability.

“Wilde, you’ve lost your bone club. I’ll give you a new weapon,” said Long Chen.

“Really? Great!” Wilde exclaimed in delight. After his bone club was broken, he hadn’t found a suitable weapon.

Guo Ran had made a new club for Wilde after his bone club was broken, but upon encountering a thirteenth rank beast, Wilde’s club ended up shattering.

After that, Guo Ran and Xia Chen hadn’t had time to create a better weapon for him, so Wilde had been empty-handed since, which wasn’t very convenient for fighting.

“Mo Nian, take out the door bolt for Wilde,” said Long Chen. He was referring to the door bolt that the two of them had worked together to take off in the Netherworld.

“What? That’s clearly mine. How did it become a gift from you? Can you have some sense of shame?” Mo Nian rolled his eyes. Mo Nian turned to talk to Wilde directly. “Brother, remember, this door bolt is bone. I’m the one giving it to you. But it’s very heavy, so you have to be prepared. Once it’s taken out, it might not be possible to put it away again.”

Last time, taking the door bolt had almost shattered his astral space. Mo Nian had cursed Long Chen after that.

This door bolt had remained in his astral space ever since. He was unable to use it. The Heaven Seizing Sun Hunting Bow was also unable to absorb its energy.

Now that Long Chen wanted to send it to Wilde, he was actually quite happy to get rid of it.

“Heavy? The heavier the better!” exclaimed Wilde.

“You’re the one who said that, so be prepared. I’m going to take it out. I can’t control it, so everyone else should back up.” Mo Nian formed hand seals. His manifestation shuddered and the void rumbled. A giant door bolt suddenly appeared in the air.

The entire world shuddered and rumbled. It was as if the world could not bear its weight.

“Prepare yourself! I’m going to drop it!” shouted Mo Nian, his voice strained.

This thing was so heavy that even tossing it out of his astral space took a toll.

Mo Nian’s manifestation flickered, and the black door bolt suddenly fell toward Wilde.

The door bolt smashed toward him. Massive spatial ripples came pouring off of it as it fell.

Wilde immediately shouted and grew larger. He then grabbed the door bolt.

BOOM!

The earth crumbled. Wilde and the door bolt vanished from sight within a bottomless hole. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I said it was too heavy. Now it has sunk to the bottom of the earth,” sighed Mo Nian.

“Just watch,” said Long Chen, confident in Wilde.

Suddenly, a roar came from down below. The earth started shaking, and the door bolt slowly started to come back out of the ground.

Following the door bolt was a golden giant.

Wilde had transformed into a giant who looked to be made of gold. His giant body caused the earth to shudder with every step.

Wilde suddenly let out an immense roar. The door bolt reacted, and black qi surged out of it. Nether Qi infected this world.

The Nether Qi infected the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders in the sky, and they began to fall like hail, dead.

“Wilde actually activated the door bolt’s runes? How is that possible?” Long Chen and Mo Nian were both shocked.

This door bolt was completely incomprehensible to the two of them. They were unable to comprehend its runes, let alone activate them.

Who would have thought that the large oaf Wilde would be able to activate the door bolt’s runes and unleash Nether Qi?

“Wilde, release all your anger and swat these spiders to death!” shouted Long Chen.

This current state of Wilde’s was a kind of berserk state. The angrier he became, the stronger he grew.

Hearing Long Chen’s instructions, Wilde swung the door bolt. As a result, a huge ripple spread through the void. Any of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders touched by the door bolt were blasted to bits.

Black qi surged out, killing any of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders that it touched.

Theoretically, Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders that lived within tombs already possessed the aura of death and decay. They should have a certain resistance to Nether Qi. But that black qi instantly killed them.

Wilde swung the door bolt several times, and countless Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders fell from the sky. Long Chen ordered everyone to gather them. Those corpses were good things to both him and Wilde.

Despite the absolute slaughter, the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders continued to fill the gaps that Wilde created. They charged forward, completely unafraid of death.

Suddenly, light came from the sky. Wilde had killed so many of them that he finally thinned them out. The number being killed had far exceeded the number charging over.

It was unknown how many of their corpses that the Dragonblood Legion had gathered. Long Chen had piled up a ten thousand mile mountain of corpses by him.

Just at this moment, Wilde’s body suddenly shrank. His weary voice rang out. “Brother Long, I can’t hold on any longer.”
