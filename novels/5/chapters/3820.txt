Chapter 3809 Secure In One’s Backing

Long Chen grabbed the junior city lord and dragged him to the city gates. He completely ignored the formation that had condensed millions of arrows on the walls, knowing that the people within the city would not dare to attack him.

He estimated that this matter was caused by the Sacred Pill Hall using this foolish fellow. They borrowed his authority in an attempt to stop Long Chen.

It was because this junior city lord was clearly an idiot. It was easy to manipulate him.

Just as Long Chen anticipated, Silver Moon City’s experts cowered behind their formation, not daring to attack. They were afraid of him using the junior city lord as a shield.

The next moment, the immense divine light on the city walls dissipated, and the closed gates were revealed. Long Chen walked in just like that, dragging the junior city lord. He held him by the neck as he walked in and was instantly surrounded by countless experts wearing Silver Moon City’s robes.

“Release me now! If you dare to treat me like this, I’ll make you die a miserable death!” shouted the junior city lord furiously.

Regretfully, with his neck being held, he wasn’t able to get much air, so what came out was a sharp and thin voice, like a eunuch cursing in the streets. It lacked any dignity at all. It was even comical.

“Xia Chen!”

Long Chen turned the junior city lord’s face to Xia Chen, and Xia Chen didn’t hesitate. He directly slapped him a dozen times.

After these slaps, his wounds that had just started to recover split open again. His face swelled badly.

Long Chen had Xia Chen slap him because Xia Chen’s physical strength was low. Someone else might accidentally kill him with a slap.

“Keep talking like that, and I’ll keep slapping!” Xia Chen took out a handkerchief and wiped the blood off of his hands.

“If you have guts, then just try to kill me! If you kill me, don’t even think about leaving this city alive!” shouted the junior city lord. He was actually quite tough, even daring to threaten them at this time.

Xia Chen once more slapped him in the face repeatedly. Even with his good temper, he was getting angry. He had the urge to kill this idiot with his slaps.

This fellow thought that his status as the junior city lord would make others not dare to touch him. He had no idea he was already in the hands of the death god.

“Release the city lord’s son, or you’ll die a miserable death!”

When Long Chen and the others walked in, the formation closed behind them. They were instantly trapped in a cage.

“Do you not have other phrases? I’ve gotten tired of hearing the same old thing over and over again. If I were to die, why would I care about how miserable it is? However, I guarantee that if you tried, your entire Silver Moon City would accompany me in death,” said Long Chen.

His voice spread far and wide, shaking heaven and earth. It contained his domineeringness and confidence. Even though they didn’t know Long Chen, they didn’t dare to question his words.

All the experts within Silver Moon City were startled, frightened by Long Chen’s might. They didn’t know what to do.

“Who do you think you are? In front of me, Yin Changsheng, you are nothing more than a coward who can only run.”

Just then, a shout came from inside the city. Yin Changsheng came flying out with a large group of the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts.

Yin Changsheng had clearly just received word and gone through multiple transportations to arrive here. There was still some spatial energy lingering around him. Unfortunately, he was too late. Long Chen was already in the city.

“Wow, the rich moneybags who gives away money is here? Last time, you already gave me this elegant belt. What are you going to give me this time?” Mo Nian laughed sinisterly. He eyed Yin Changsheng up and down.

Yin Changsheng was enraged when he saw Mo Nian. His belt, which was on the level of a World Domain divine item, had been taken by Mo Nian. That was a huge humiliation for him. At this moment, flames almost burst out of his eyes, and he pointed his spear right at Mo Nian, his aura growing wildly.

“Long Chen, I didn’t think that you’d be hiding here. We finally meet again. Let me see where you will run this time.”

A long-haired woman in skintight clothes and with a sword on her back descended from the sky. It was the Nine Underworld Hall’s peak expert, the Nine Underworld Luocha. She had also come.

When she appeared, a chilly killing intent instantly caused countless people to have goosebumps. Their souls also felt a sharp pain. This was the opposite of an assassin’s usual concealed aura. The Nine Underworld Luocha was like a god of slaughter, delighting in taking other people’s lives in the most violent way.

There was a large shadowy figure behind her that swayed with the wind. It was like the banner of a devil, yet also like the scythe of the death god dancing.

After advancing to the Immortal King realm, the Nine Underworld Luocha’s aura had completely changed. It was even more sinister and violent, an aura that seemed to live for slaughter.

When Long Chen saw her, his heart quivered. After passing this tribulation, the Nine Underworld Luocha had completely transformed. Her power had increased by an unknown amount.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Fortunately, Long Chen had the dragon expert’s assistance in his tribulation. Otherwise, his power would have been thrown behind hers by a great deal.

The Nine Underworld Hall’s disciples all gathered behind her when she arrived.

“What are you talking about? Is your memory so bad? Do you not remember how I beat you until you knelt and begged for mercy in the Darklight Heaven?” sneered Long Chen.

Although the Nine underworld Luocha was terrifying, the current Long Chen had fully activated all seven stars, and his meridians had made huge improvements. He was no longer the old Long Chen. He was unafraid of anyone.

“Damn bastard, that was just my carelessness! A minor victory lets you be so pleased? Are you going to brag about it for the rest of your life? If you’re a man, come out of the city with me, and we’ll decide who is stronger right now!” The Nine Underworld Luocha’s gaze instantly grew icy and dark. She hated Long Chen to the point of not wanting to wait another second.

“Decide who’s stronger? Sorry, this chance can’t be given to you. Otherwise, your fool master will once more start bragging.”

Suddenly, a soft voice rang out and the black-robed Ji Wuming appeared. Countless people cried out in shock. Even within this crowd of powerful experts, not one person noticed where he had come from.

“Long Chen, not bad! I feel like I have quite a few great enemies, but your enemies are all so powerful!” Mo Nian chortled as he eyed the Nine Underworld Luocha and Ji Wuming. After that, his own battle intent ignited. This fellow was also a war-like man.

“This is nothing. You’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Long Chen, also growing excited as he saw his enemies appearing one by one.

“Release me, or you’ll regret coming to this world!” Suddenly, the junior city lord in Long Chen’s hand woke up. He had been knocked unconscious by Xia Chen’s slaps and now began to roar again.

Xia Chen looked at him. This idiot was truly a pain in the neck. Xia Chen then raised his hand to slap him again when Long Chen suddenly released him. But then, the Minghong Saber appeared in his hand.

BOOM!

All of Silver Moon City quivered. His saber slashed down, knocking back a figure.

This figure was a middle-aged man looking to be in his forties. As soon as he appeared, the junior city lord cried out excitedly.

“Now you’re definitely dead! Dad, quickly kill them!”
