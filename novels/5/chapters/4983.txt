The clan leader suddenly lost all restraint, and the situation spiraled out of control. Everyone from the Long clan looked like they wanted to kill Long Chen.

“Who told you about the Jiuli Tower?!” shouted Long Yaoting, jumping to his feet as well.

“Keep acting. Little black dwarf, come any closer, and I’ll slap you,” taunted Long Chen, pointing at Long Yaoting threateningly.

Once more, Long Qianxue almost lost her cool. In all her years, she had never heard anyone call Long Yaoting such a thing. Every single word was taboo to Long Yaoting, hitting right on the mark.

“Fine, as I see it, you must want to die, so I’ll help you out!” Long Yaoting roared. A chain suddenly appeared in his hand, shooting toward Long Chen like a serpent.

The moment the chain was about to coil around Long Chen, a bronze cauldron appeared in front of him, intercepting the chain with a loud clang.

BOOOOM!

An explosion rocked the palace. The chains shattered into pieces, and the force of the blast demolished the palace. Everyone within the palace was sent flying.

The once majestic building crumbled into a pile of ruins. Covered in dust, those emerging from the rubble were shocked and enraged at the destruction of their hall.

However, amidst the chaos, the clan leader and the three Heavenly Saints had wide eyes filled with disbelief.

“That was…”

Although it had happened quickly, they had clearly seen the distinct form of the bronze cauldron. The sight left their hearts pounding uncontrollably.

“Fuck, come at me! I don’t mind dragging all of you down with me! Even if I can’t do it myself, once my father comes, none of you will get out alive either!” Long Chen emerged from the rubble, with Evilmoon in his hand. Just now, Long Yaoting’s sneak attack had enraged him deeply. It had been a perfect chance, but Long Chen hadn’t managed to strike him.

“Come!” Long Chen shouted and pointed Evilmoon at Long Yaoting.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just then, the entire Long clan quivered. A wailing screech rang throughout the Heavenly Desolation Domain. The destruction of the palace had triggered the alarm.

Countless experts came running over from all directions. The clan leader raised his hand, conjuring a barrier that shielded them from view. He instructed an elder, “Go and calm everyone outside.”

The elder immediately walked out of the barrier, shouting, “This is the assembly grounds! Approaching is forbidden! Everyone, go back to what you were doing!”

First, the clan leader stopped them from approaching, then he stationed guards to reinforce the barrier and prevent anyone else from getting close.

“What? Do you want to kill me for my treasures? Hahaha, come and try it!” Long Chen raised his head and laughed fearlessly.

“Do you really possess the Heaven Earth Cauldron?” Long Qianxue stared at Long Chen in disbelief.

The Long clan had heard rumors that Long Chen possessed one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

When they first heard this rumor, their reaction was to scoff. How could it be? One of the Primal Chaos Divine Items, which were legendary artifacts capable of shaking the very foundation of the world, in the hands of some young brat?

Each of the ten great Primal Chaos Divine Items was an existence of immense power, capable of instantly killing anyone below the Emperor realm just by their karma alone.

Even a powerful Emperor divine weapon, if not in the hands of a true Emperor, required the backing of an entire race to wield safely. The karma associated with such artifacts needed to be shared collectively among the people of that race. Even then, it could still be very dangerous. If the race did not have enough people or was lacking in karmic luck, it could lead to catastrophic consequences for the entire community.

Thus, the Long clan refused to believe that Long Chen could possess the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Moreover, the rumors merely hinted at it being “suspected to be” the Heaven Earth Cauldron, further diminishing its credibility.

Adding to their skepticism was the story of Long Chen allegedly auctioning off the Heaven Earth Cauldron and duping the Dragon Soaring Trading Company. The Long clan had laughed when they heard that. Who in their right mind would believe such a preposterous tale?

However, they could no longer laugh now. The cauldron’s appearance matched the descriptions from ancient legends. Furthermore, Long Yaoting’s chain was an extremely powerful divine weapon. For it to instantly explode upon contact, other than the Heaven Earth Cauldron, what else could it be?

This was indeed the true Heaven Earth Cauldron, one of the ten great primal chaos divine items. The implications of this revelation were profound and potentially disastrous for the Long clan if news of it spread.

“Everyone, seal your soul! Qihua, Yaoting, Qianhua, and Heaven Overseer, stay. Everyone else, leave!” ordered the clan leader.

This soul-sealing technique would embed the memory deep within their minds, allowing it to fade naturally without affecting their cultivation. Erasing the memory forcibly could damage their souls, so this method was chosen to prevent any leaks about the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

To execute the soul-sealing, everyone formed specific hand seals and condensed a rune on their forehead. This rune symbolized the sealed memory. One by one, they sent their sealed runes to the clan leader, and he meticulously inspected each rune to ensure the memory of the Heaven Earth Cauldron was securely sealed. Only after verifying each seal did he permit them to leave, knowing that their memories of the cauldron would remain hidden from prying eyes.

This matter was too big, so big that even the Long clan found it overwhelming. As a result, they had no choice but to be prudent. The clan leader had even sent out his trusted aide; he didn’t dare to trust anyone else so easily.

After everyone was sent off, it was just the clan leader, the three Heavenly Saints, the Heaven Overseer, and Long Chen present.

Long Chen sat down on a large boulder amidst the debris, originally a piece of the gate.

“So what now? Kill me to keep this information secret and prevent any slips?”

Their attitudes had shifted. The existence of the Heaven Earth Cauldron changed everything; now they treated him with seriousness.

The clan leader looked at the Heaven Overseer, but the latter stared into the distance apathetically. Clearly, the clan leader wanted the Heaven Overseer to say something to relieve the tension, but the latter feigned ignorance, unwilling to clean up their mess once more.

Since the Heaven Overseer refused to speak, the clan leader finally said, “I feel like we can have an open conversation right now.”
