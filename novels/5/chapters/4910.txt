Chapter 4899 Once More Seeing the Heavenly Eye

A powerful pulling force drew Long Chen into the violet crystal, giving him no chance to resist, and in the blink of an eye, he found himself in a violet world.

The ground was flat like a mirror, and the sky was deep blue, with a few clouds floating through—calm and peaceful. It was a world that could make him forget all his troubles.

“Welcome, friend.” A gentle voice rang out behind him.

Long Chen turned over to see a white-robed middle-aged man standing there. However, he was startled when he saw the man’s face. This handsome and scholarly man had an eye that resembled an amethyst. Within that eye, six divine runes flowed, making it seem as though one could see the workings of heaven and earth through it.

“Six Dao... Heavenly Eye!”

Long Chen hadn’t expected to encounter another expert of the Heavenly Eye race. However, this scholarly man only had that one eye. The other eye was gone, leaving his eye socket sunken in.

“My apologies. I hope I didn’t scare you,” said the scholarly man as he smiled apologetically.

“Senior is too courteous. Just what is going on?” asked Long Chen.

“Back in my day, there was a chaotic battle between the ten thousand races, and almost every race joined forces against the human race. At that time, the Jiuli, violet blood, Heavenly Eye, and other leaders of the human race launched a crazy assault. While I was fighting these eight, I realized I was too weak and unable to beat them. Hence, I had no choice but to detonate one of my Heavenly Eyes to kill them.”

“Too weak...”

Long Chen felt a chill to hear that. If the Earth Cauldron hadn’t told him just how powerful those corpses were, he would have believed this middle-aged man’s words.

The man continued, “However, I could only crush their bodies, not their souls and wills. Their bodies still have their bloodline runes within them. If I did not seal them, they could possess other experts and be reborn. Thus, I used my other Heavenly Eye to seal myself with them. In any case, I was just too weak. Pulling them into an eternal slumber at least ensures that I didn’t lose face for the Heavenly Eye race.”

Long Chen stared at this man, not sensing any anger or regret emanating from him. He seemed like a kind person. When he spoke of his weakness, it didn’t sound like self-mockery or false humility; he genuinely felt this way.

“Senior, do you feel hate?” asked Long Chen rather suddenly.

The middle-aged man was taken aback. After staring at Long Chen for a bit, he seemed to understand his meaning and nodded. “At first, I did... but I stopped caring about it after a while. Do you see the clouds in this sky?”

Long Chen nodded. The moment he arrived here, he saw this vast sky. Those few clouds were quite conspicuous.

The man sighed, “When I used all my power to seal them, my world became covered in black clouds—the manifestation of my hatred. I hated them for ruining this world, for ruining my peaceful life, for slaying countless people. I hated them for making me leave my respected master and my cherished family. When I died, they were definitely filled with pain...”

The man’s voice was heavy as he was lost in distant memories. He then looked up at the clouds in the sky. “As time passed, those black clouds faded, and I no longer felt such hatred. I no longer had the energy to hate. Now, my world only has those four clouds left, which are the love in my heart.”

He then pointed at one of them, smiling warmly. “She is my wife, the warmest, most beautiful woman I know... a foolish woman who somehow fell in love with me and gave me everything. I was willing to give her my everything as well. From the moment I saw her, I swore I would make her the most blessed woman in the world.

“Those three smaller clouds are our children. I felt incredibly blessed when they were born... the symbols of our love. I swore not to let anyone harm them. However... I was unable to protect the ones I wanted to protect. How sad must they be when they hear the news of my demise? I can’t even bring myself to imagine what their tortured faces look like...”

Long Chen’s heart tightened as incomparable pain assaulted it. That was also the sight he feared the most. He didn’t dare to imagine just how much pain his loved ones would feel if he fell in combat.

“I felt hate. I hated these animals for their brutality, and I also hated myself for my powerlessness. Yet, as time passed, I could no longer keep those things in my heart. I forgot about the scenes of my battle. I forgot the names of the brothers who fought alongside me. I can’t even remember who my master was. Now... all I can remember is them, my family. I want to hate, but I don’t have the energy to do so. I’m afraid that my hatred would make me forget the most important people in my heart,” continued the man. When he looked at those four clouds in the sky, his eyes filled with emotion. Those four clouds were the most important things to him.

Long Chen solemnly remarked, “Senior, you don’t need to hate anymore. When I go out, I will avenge you. That way, you can release the seal and search for your loved ones.”

Long Chen felt immense sympathy for this man’s pain, and he swore to eliminate those corpses so that he could be free. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, Long Chen didn’t know whether his wife and children still existed. If they had reincarnated and his wife had married someone else, what would happen?

He didn’t dare to even bring up such a possibility. For him, that thought would be more painful than death. After so many years, this was perhaps the only thing keeping him going.

The man said, “Thank you, my young friend. However, because my power is inferior to theirs, in order to seal them, I gave up my chance to reincarnate.”

“That’s...” Long Chen felt another burst of sadness. Now, he had no idea how to comfort him.

“Don’t feel bad. As a warrior of the Heavenly Eye race, I didn’t lose the dignity of the Heavenly Eye race. As a husband, I was able to protect my wife. As a father, I didn’t bring shame to my children. That is enough. I’m satisfied.” The middle-aged man smiled at Long Chen.

Long Chen’s heart filled with grief. He detested war, but some people always created conflict. They would never understand just how much pain they brought to others with their battles.

It seemed as if witnessing others in pain brought them joy. Could it be that the lifeforms in this world truly lacked respect or gratitude?

BOOM!

Just then, the violet world shuddered, and the middle-aged man said, “Their assault has started.”
