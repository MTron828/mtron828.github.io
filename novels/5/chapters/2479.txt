Chapter 2469 The Secrets of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest

Translator: BornToBe

An evil aura exploded. The sharp blade brought with it an aura of death. However, this blade was not solid. It was a spiritual attack.

BOOM!

The blade fell and Long Chen’s soul shook. A wave of dizziness almost overwhelmed him.

Fortunately, his Spiritual Strength had grown stronger with the advancement of his cultivation base. Despite being caught off guard, the attack was quickly erased once it entered his mind-sea.

Long Chen slashed Evilmoon in the air in front of him but didn’t hit anything. He also didn’t see anything.

“Is there a ghost?” asked Long Chen.

“What ghost? This is the resentful spirit of the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps. Their souls were bound here upon dying and remained for tens of thousands of years. They’ll naturally attack when they encounter living creatures. But their Spiritual Strength is famous for how crap it is, so it’s no danger to you. Continue onward,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen sent his Spiritual Strength out to keep an eye on the surroundings. Although this attack hadn’t been fatal, it didn’t feel good.

No wonder the divine families’ ordinary disciples were not allowed inside. With the spacetime channel being such a barrier, along with the attacks of the resentful spirits here, even the Dragonblood warriors probably couldn’t enter.

Another black figure quickly attacked Long Chen as he advanced. This time, he saw it clearly. It was a strange lifeform in black armor attacking with a saber.

With his guard up, Long Chen easily summoned a spiritual shield. The black figure smashed into the shield and exploded, vanishing without a trace.

“Curious, why don’t I see their actual corpses?” asked Long Chen.

“Do you know the origin of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest?” asked Evilmoon. It also seemed curious.

“No.”

“Alright, I forgot that the Martial Heaven Continent has lost many inheritances after multiple tribulations. Let me put it to you this way. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest is formed of countless dragon bones. A dragon king will always create a Ten Thousand Dragon Nest after being born, and the foundation of this nest is the dragon king’s blood bone. The dragon king will then constantly beat powerful opponents and use their bones for the nest. This nest is no ordinary construction. It is the result of the dragon race’s divine abilities. In other words, this nest can be considered to be alive. It will constantly absorb the corpses of other experts to strengthen itself. Furthermore, it is the strongest trump card of the dragon king. It can be likened to a divine item created by a human. This divine item might be weak at the start, but as time passes, it will constantly be strengthened. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest is also a great source of energy for the dragon king. It is capable of offense and defense. In my battle against Yun Shang, if I had had my Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, I wouldn’t have been beaten so miserably,” said Evilmoon hatefully.

Long Chen was startled. So Evilmoon had also reached the level of a dragon king. No wonder it had such an understanding of this nest.

“Then that means that the corpses were absorbed by the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest? Does that mean that the dragon king is still alive?” probed Long Chen.

“That is impossible to say. Even if the dragon king is dead, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest would continue to act according to its natural functions. For example, even if a human dies, their astral space can remain and become a minor world. That minor world will simply not possess a master. It’s still too early to say anything for sure. You should go check the core. If your luck is good, you might be able to find a treasure.”

BOOM!

Long Chen was attacked once more, but this time Long Chen didn’t wait to be struck, instead striking first with a spiritual sword.

It was precisely as Evilmoon said. These resentful souls were not strong enough to pose any threat to him.

“The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest is something only powerful members of the dragon race are qualified to enter. They can absorb its energy to cultivate and benefit from the dragon king. It is also the crux of a dragon king’s breakthrough. Once the dragon nest has reached a certain level, the dragon king can attempt to break through the next barrier to a higher realm. Based on the aura of this nest, it has reached the middle level, but it’s a far cry from my Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Despite that, there is definitely something good at the core. The main question is whether or not it still remains or if someone else got to it first,” said Evilmoon with anticipation.

Long Chen followed the passageway he was in. The path suddenly became spacious up ahead, and there was an ancient forest.

“Did I end up transported out?” Long Chen was startled. He had felt like he had sensed some spatial fluctuations just now.

This ancient forest extended further than he could see. The aura was also completely different from the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

“No. This is one of the nest’s spatial worlds. A dragon can cultivate here. There are countless spaces like this, each connected to multiple entrances like a maze. There is only one main path that the dragon king goes through, and that path cannot be entered by others. I’ve chosen the next most direct path for you, so don’t waste time. Before entering, I saw several entrances that showed signs that others had entered,” urged Evilmoon.

Long Chen continued onward according to Evilmoon’s directions. After half an incense stick’s worth of time, he saw a battlefield.

There were countless corpses littering the ground. He saw a dozen dragon skeletons that looked a bit off, looking somewhat like tigers instead of dragons. Their mouths were long, and it was impossible to guess what their original forms were like.

Other than those skeletons, there were thousands of black corpses. Long Chen finally saw what the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps looked like.

They were like humans but covered in black scales. Their scales had runes on them, but they were now faint and powerless.

Their foreheads were a bit wide, and they had two canine teeth. Their bodies were thin, and their eyes had vanished. An aura of decay and darkness still came from them.

Examining the battlefield, Long Chen didn’t find anything useful. Rather than wasting more time here, he continued onward.

“These spaces were given to certain experts amongst the dragon race with a set level of status. The one who lived here belonged to the dragon cat race. They aren’t especially powerful, but they are quick as lightning and possess a powerful domain divine ability. That was why they were able to slay so many of the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps. Using the terms of your Martial Heaven Continent, they are above the Netherpassage realm,” said Evilmoon.

“Above the Netherpassage realm.” Long Chen was shaken inside.

As he continued onward, Evilmoon said, “The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest can be considered to be a bit similar to your Dantian. You have 108,000 astral spaces, while the dragon nest also has countless spaces for dragons to cultivate. If the dragon nest was allowed to limitlessly grow, it would give birth to its own cosmos. Just how terrifying would it be if it possessed the power of an entire cosmos? Long Chen, I’m telling you this because I don’t understand your Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but I’m sure it is a heaven-defying cultivation technique. If I compare it to the dragon nest, I’d have to say that your Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is even more terrifying. Now I understand why you are always plagued with setbacks and bad luck. You were originally just an ordinary person in the mortal world, but your fate was changed by the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Even now, I cannot see your golden fate lines, nor do I dare to use any of my evil dragon race’s oracle techniques to predict your future. Even my own fate became impossible to predict at some point. Moreover, my past is now sealed within my memories. This is why Yun Shang was waiting for you, why Mo Li called you brother. My guess is that due to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, they have bet everything on you. You are not infected by the karma of the Sovereigns. Your future will only grow more difficult, so I have to warn you not to restrict yourself.”

The words that Evilmoon spoke were very simple, but it also kept a few words back. Long Chen could understand what it was saying.

“Don’t worry, if I see an opportunity to get stronger, I’ll grasp it with my full power. No one will be able to stop me.” Long Chen took a deep breath and nodded. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Good. Then go left,” said Evilmoon.

They very quickly appeared within a twisting space. Long Chen stepped inside, and the passageway appeared once more. Long Chen sped down it, going through over ten of those spatial worlds.

Every one of those spatial worlds was filled with skeletons and corpses. Whatever battle had gone down here had been intense.

The further he went, the stronger the aura of the dragon race’s experts was. The remnant laws also grew clearer. Upon entering one of the worlds, he heard the roars and shrieks of the dragons and Heaven Swallowing Black Armor Corps. It was as if the battle from back then was being reenacted in the present.

During normal times, Long Chen would take a pause to feel just how terrifying the battle from back then was, but now Evilmoon was urging him to race through.

Eventually, Long Chen couldn’t even remember how many of the spatial worlds he had passed. Even his sense of direction had grown muddled. He was relying entirely on Evilmoon to lead the way.

Suddenly, the space ahead of him shuddered. A dark world appeared. As soon as he entered, Long Chen’s hair stood on end.

This world was filled with death and the aura of rot. It felt like just taking a breath could make a person age.

Long Chen was about to ask Evilmoon which direction to go when the void above him twisted. A figure appeared, and when he saw that figure, Long Chen immediately shot toward it like an arrow, slashing Evilmoon.
