Chapter 4778 Slaying Yue Wuxu

Long Chen had been separated from his biological parents as a baby, a fact that filled him with longing and pity toward them. After all, he understood that nothing could compare to the grief of a parent losing a child.

For Long Chen, his parents were his reverse scale, and outsiders were not qualified to judge them. Thus, when the Earth Saint of the Celestial race dared to claim he would teach Long Chen a lesson in place of his parents, it was an egregious insult to them, insinuating that they had failed in raising him properly.

With that statement, the Earth Saint had fully provoked Long Chen. Long Chen’s killing intent exploded, surpassing the one he had for Yue Wuxu.

In a distant space, a Sage King of the Long clan looked at the Heaven Overseer urgently. “Even an Earth Saint is attacking him! Heaven Overseer, are you really not planning on doing anything?!”

Long Chen had crushed Yue Wuxu with brute power and even slain a Mortal Saint, displaying amazing talent. Even those who were hostile toward Long Zhantian had to admit that Long Chen was absolutely terrifying. Such an existence had a limitless future, so if the Long clan could draw him in, that would be amazing.

The Heaven Overseer remained silent and continued to watch. As he did, his gaze slowly grew solemn.

“This killing intent...”

“To be so vicious at such a young age, I’ll teach a little baby like you what true power is!” The Earth Saint snorted disdainfully before unleashing a forceful palm strike toward Long Chen.

The palm strike seemed strangely fast and slow at the same time, encapsulating all the space around Long Chen. There was no escape, nowhere for Long Chen to evade or flee.

“No way! An Earth Saint is attacking a Divine Venerate disciple?!”

Countless experts had been completely won over by Long Chen’s grandeur. The youngsters in particular felt utmost scorn and indignation that an Earth Saint was personally attacking Long Chen. If they weren’t afraid of the Celestial race’s abuse, they would have long since started cursing them.

“When an Earth Saint fights, the laws of heaven and earth fall under their command. Long Chen is unable to move under this pressure. Is no one from the Heavenly Desolation Long clan going to do anything?! Are they going to watch as their disciple is bullied like this?”

Seeing an Earth Saint attack Long Chen, even the senior generation couldn’t help but grumble. If Long Chen were their disciple, they would definitely go all-out to protect him. After all, the young blood represented the future of the clan.

“Hahaha, now let’s see how you die!” Yue Wuxu laughed arrogantly, his retreat halted as he wanted to witness Long Chen's death up close.

The Earth Saint’s palm crashed down with such pressure that even the distant Divine Venerates felt their bones groan in protest. They shuddered at the thought of the overwhelming force bearing down on Long Chen. If they were in his place, they knew they would have been pulverized long before.

However, to their astonishment, Long Chen didn’t even move a single muscle. In front of this attack, he still stood with Evilmoon on his shoulder.

“Could he not move an inch under this pressure?!”

A native senior expert couldn’t help sighing. “That would be very normal. After all, I don’t even know how much stronger he is compared to a Mortal Saint. An Earth Saint is said to have touched the laws of the Heavenly Daos, and the power they command is beyond our comprehension. As for Long Chen... It’s a pity.”

In their eyes, no matter how strong a Divine Venerate was, they wouldn’t have the slightest ability to resist in front of an Earth Saint.

However, the Dragonblood warriors just coldly stared at this Earth Saint, still having no intention of joining in. The onlookers simply thought that they were terrified by the Earth Saint’s pressure, unaware that none of the Dragonblood warriors were worried for Long Chen.

As the Earth Saint's palm descended upon Long Chen's chest, his attack underwent a sudden transformation. His hand morphed into a claw, aiming directly for Long Chen's throat. He had originally been planning on killing Long Chen, but seeing that Long Chen lacked the ability to resist, he changed his plans, wanting to capture him alive.

Just as his hand was about to touch Long Chen’s throat, Long Chen’s left hand sliced through the air in a strange yet mesmerizing arc.

Time seemed to come to a standstill as the movements of the Celestial race's Earth Saint appeared to slow down. Despite initiating his attack second, Long Chen's palm landed squarely on the elder's face with remarkable precision.

A deafening explosion, akin to thunder, erupted as blood light burst forth from the elder's face. Long Chen’s palm forcibly shattered his protective divine light and continued to crush his face.

“What?!”

Jaws dropped and eyes widened in disbelief as the Earth Saint was sent hurtling through the air. The sheer audacity and precision of Long Chen’s counterattack left onlookers stunned, their minds struggling to process the swift turn of events.

Even the Heaven Overseer jumped. The reason he hadn’t responded to that person’s question before was because he wanted to see if Long Chen had the ability to fight an Earth Saint. That was why he refrained from intervening.

Seeing Long Chen not moving, the Heaven Overseer assumed that Long Chen was going to block that palm or use his saber. He would definitely attack in order to resolve the dangerous situation. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, the Heaven Overseer had not expected a face slap. When it succeeded, even he was dumbfounded. The Sage Kings behind him stared dumbstruck like wooden chickens.

This face slap was incredibly resounding. It seemed to echo in people’s ears, deafening them, but their vision was not affected. They clearly saw the Earth Saint flying back, his face covered in blood.

“Can Long Chen really defy the heavens?”

“Are my eyes not functioning correctly? Did I really see that?”

Countless experts started to doubt their own existence. Long Chen was still standing there with Evilmoon on his shoulder, not moving at all. If it weren’t for his raised left hand, people still wouldn’t dare to believe that this slap was unleashed by him.

“You bastard!”

At this moment, the Earth Saint recovered, but he no longer appeared calm, his face twisting with fury.

He, a grand Earth Saint, had been slapped in the face by a Divine Venerate. For him, this humiliation was worse than death.

Just then, Yue Wuxu seemed to sense something and didn’t dare to keep watching. With a flash, he shot back, and the Earth Saint shot forward.

Yue Wuxu had just moved when Long Chen propelled Evilmoon forward with lightning speed. The movement was too swift for anyone to follow, but suddenly, Evilmoon was impaling Yue Wuxu through the chest. He was then drawn back to Long Chen's grasp.

“Release him! Otherwise—” the Earth Saint bellowed, his warning cut short by a deafening explosion.

With a tremor in his hand, Long Chen's palm quivered, and before the horrified eyes of the onlookers, Yue Wuxu exploded into bits. In an instant, a generation’s heavenly genius met his end.
