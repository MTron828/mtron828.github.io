Chapter 3488

The dagger passed through Qi Hong’s head. His face still had its terrified, unwilling, and perplexed expression.

Just before his death, he had assumed that there was no way Long Chen could break free from this formation. The Treasure Gathering Bowl was condensed from faith energy, and it also had the combined power of thirty-six World Kings. Unless Long Chen’s power was many times greater than those thirty-six World Kings, he would be a bird caught in a cage.

For Long Chen to suddenly break out of that cage effortlessly, even in death, Qi Hong felt unwilling.

Qi Hong’s corpse slowly fell to the ground. Long Chen then shattered his soul and saw a palm-sized piece of beautiful jade in his memories.

This jade had a beautiful snowflake mark twinkling within it, and it actually pulsed like a snow-white flame.

This was precisely the treasure that Bai Fang had mentioned, the Ice Soul. After obtaining it, Long Chen realized what a heaven-defying treasure it was.

This was one of the top ten Heavenly Flames. It was the ice flame that was ranked even above the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, the Ice Soul.

Bai Fang didn’t know that this treasure was precisely the legendary rank eight Heavenly Flame, the Ice Soul. This Ice Soul Divine Jade was of unknown origins. Due to how long it had been, even the Bai family did not know how their ancestors had obtained it.

The Bai family was originally a glorious and enormous existence thousands of generations ago. Later on, their family declined, gradually shrinking into a small noble family that barely made a living for themselves.

Their fallen family only had this one treasure. Although they didn’t know what it was used for, they knew that it was the most ancient thing in their treasure chamber, thus they particularly cherished it.

However, it was because of this that the Bai family ended up drawing killers in the night. Their family was wiped out, with only Bai Fang and Bai Rui escaping.

Furthermore, the one to harm the Bai family was connected to the Qi Song from the ship. The perpetrator had mentioned the Bai family to Qi Song, telling him that they had a heaven-shaking treasure, and that Qi Song had to take note of them if he encountered them.

In truth, that person didn’t even know what kind of treasure the Bai family had. They had searched through the entire Shoreside Star-Field without finding Bai Fang and Bai Rui. Afraid of leaving behind a disaster, they intentionally spread words that the two of them had a treasure.

This matter was so coincidental. The two of them really had been holding a treasure, and Qi Song had set his sights on them. Qi Song himself didn’t know that this treasure was so heaven-defying. He had thought that it was nothing more than an ordinary treasure.

Afterward, he told Qi He about this matter, and Qi He informed Qi Hong. However, Qi Hong didn’t treat it seriously back then, telling them to deal with it themselves, only to cause Long Chen to come out.

Thereafter, Qi Hong considered how he could get that treasure from Bai Fang’s hands. When he saw the Ice Soul Divine Jade, he almost died from shock. As an experienced businessman, he instantly recognized it to be a priceless treasure.

Although he didn’t know what exactly it was used for, for it to have the name of the rank eight Heavenly Flame as part of it, it was definitely priceless.

However, Bai Fang had managed to make one smart play. This Ice Soul Divine Jade could not be activated without a special method. It was like there was endless energy locked inside, and only Bai Fang knew the activation method.

As Bai Fang had passed that method to Long Chen and died, Qi Hong immediately used a secret technique to send the treasure to his senior, Yu Shu. The Ice Soul Divine Jade was no longer on his body.

Long Chen suddenly turned to the leader of these World Kings. He coldly asked, “Who is Yu Shu?”

His response was an attack from thirty-six World Kings. Thirty-six rays of divine light then shot toward Long Chen once more.

“Since you refuse to answer, you can die! Huo Linger, Lei Linger, kill them all! Don’t leave a single one alive.”

Long Chen’s face was dark. He couldn’t be bothered to waste words with this group. He had to quickly reclaim the Ice Soul Divine Jade. Otherwise, if it landed in the hands of the Soaring Dragon Company’s higher-ups, there would be no getting it back.

Bai Fang had entrusted Long Chen with getting back the Ice Soul Divine Jade. That was a treasure he had originally been planning to give to Long Chen, but it had been conned away by Qi Hong. At that moment, he was filled with hatred and regret, hatred for his own foolishness. Even in death, his resentful will remained. If Long Chen couldn’t reclaim the Ice Soul Divine Jade, Bai Fang wouldn’t be able to rest in peace.

“Lightning Flames Destroy the Heavens!”

Lei Linger and Huo Linger appeared, shouting together. After that, a lightning dragon and a flame dragon twisted together, smashing into those thirty-six chains. Flame and lightning runes raged throughout the world. It was like a firework lighting up heaven and earth, looking glorious.

However, behind this firework was endless destructive power. The Treasure Gathering Bowls within their hands exploded.

Perhaps those Treasure Gathering Bowls could resist the flame energy, but Lei Linger possessed the power of heavenly tribulation and directly shattered them. Faith divine items appeared incredibly weak in front of the power of heavenly tribulation.

“What?!”

Those World Kings were stupefied. Just then, Lei Linger and Huo Linger reached them. One carried the World Extermination Lightning Radiance, while the other carried the World Extermination Flame Lotus. These two ultimate moves were unleashed like they cost nothing.

With their Treasure Gathering Bowls destroyed, those World Kings had yet to take out new weapons when they were devoured by the lightning and flames. They exploded one after another.

BOOM!

Just then, Long Chen’s Minghong Saber clashed with the saber of the lead elder. Saber cries rang out, shaking the heavens. Long Chen then narrowed his eyes.

This was a second Heavenstage World King. Just as Bai Letian had told him, amongst World Kings, a single increase in Heavenstage led to huge differences in combat power. A second Heavenstage World King was several times stronger than a first Heavenstage World King.

This second Heavenstage World King was shocked. A little Divine Lord like Long Chen was actually capable of receiving his attack.

“Who are you?!” roared this World King. Long Chen had such talent and power. He must have come from some powerful background.

“You group of animals, do you think you’re qualified to ask my name?” Long Chen roared back, beginning to unleash a torrent of attacks with his saber.

The two of them exchanged over ten blows in one breath. In the end, that World King was unable to beat Long Chen and was forced back five steps.

Just as he stabilized himself to receive Long Chen’s next blow, a lightning blade and a flame blade stabbed through his back.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber then stabbed him through the head. While reading his soul, Long Chen waved his hand. After that, the tablet on the World King’s waist fell into Long Chen’s hand.

Long Chen pulled back Lei Linger and Huo Linger. At this moment, the tablet in his hand lit up, and he was enveloped with divine energy. Space shuddered and he vanished.

Of the original thirty-six World Kings, only seven remained. They were all pale, their eyes full of fear.

“Not good! He’s going to the headquarters in the Evergreen Prefecture!” shouted a World King. They also activated their tablets, vanishing.

The battle here ended just like that. As a result, the experts watching in the distance were struck as dumb as wooden chickens. Looking at the completely deformed terrain as well as the corpses of the World Kings, they were unable to say a single word for a long time.
