Chapter 3709 Xia Chen vs. He Changtian

“Xia Chen, you little cheater!”

Guo Ran cried out miserably. Xia Chen had actually done rock, while Guo Ran and Long Chen had scissors. So, Xia Chen won in one round.

He had agreed with Guo Ran for their moves beforehand. But he actually lied. In that situation, Xia Chen naturally won.

Xia Chen instantly radiated a lively vigor after winning. His battle will soared. Although he looked like a weak scholar, once he entered his combat state, he was like a tiger coming out of its den. His killing intent instantly covered the world, and the air around him completely changed.

“I, Xia Chen, challenge He Changtian to a battle today. All heroes beneath the heavens will bear witness. Today’s battle will decide who is stronger and who dies. No one may interfere in our battle. He Changtian, if you’re afraid of death, you can still run away at this time. But once we start fighting, there will be no end until one of us is dead. Don’t say that I didn’t warn you.”

Xia Chen stood in the air, looking at He Changtian coldly. Even without a weapon, even without battle armor, just standing there, he gave off the air of a powerful expert. His powerful confidence in particular moved the other experts present.

After all, Long Chen had some reputation, but when it came to Guo Ran and Xia Chen, outside of their respective star-fields, their fame had yet to spread. Thus, people didn’t recognize them. They hadn’t even heard of their names.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran didn’t seem to possess any air of an expert while standing beside Long Chen. That made it easy for others to neglect their existence.

It was only when Xia Chen stepped forward that his powerful aura was revealed, shaking people’s hearts. Only then did they understand that this seemingly weak man was a true expert who had killed his way out of the battlefield.

He Changtian sneered in response to Xia Chen’s challenge. “A nameless soldier is all you are. You dare to challenge this prince? I challenged all three of you together, but you just have to send yourselves to your deaths one by one. Fine, then today I’ll show you what true power is. I’ll show you that the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire can’t be provoked by the likes of you. As for the matters between the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire and the Vermilion Bird Empire, they aren’t things that the likes of you can stick your hands into.”

He Changtian’s words were clearly for everyone to hear. He was saying that the current Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire was no longer the old Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

Upon hearing his statement, everyone’s heart shook. The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire was fully set on establishing their might. Could it be that they really had grown to the point of being able to challenge the Vermilion Bird Empire? Perhaps the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s challenge to the Vermilion Bird Empire wasn’t as simple as it appeared on the surface.

“Alright, since you’ve agreed, let’s not waste any more words. All the heavenly geniuses present, give us some face and retreat a bit. I’m not afraid of wounding you. But you might get splattered with some blood,” said Xia Chen.

The spectators laughed. Some of them gave him face and retreated. But some extremely conceited people completely ignored him and continued to stand where they were.

Long Chen brought Yu Qingxuan, Guo Ran, and the others back. Yin Ting secretly said, “Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, this junior brother won’t be in danger, right? That hateful He Changtian is a Supreme expert.”

“Don’t worry about it. No one from my Dragonblood Legion is a weakling,” said Guo Ran, taking the initiative before Long Chen even said anything. His eyes suddenly brightened when he looked at Yin Ting. “Oh, miss, you’re very beautiful. Do you have a Dao-companion- Aiya!”

“Have some shame!” Long Chen clapped Guo Ran on the back of his head angrily. This fellow didn’t have any propriety with his words.

“What are you talking about? Seeing how much she cares about Xia Chen, I was thinking about helping the two of them bond. What’s wrong with that?” exclaimed Guo Ran, feeling aggrieved.

“Hehe, I already have someone in my heart,” laughed Yin Ting.

“Alright, then you won’t have that blessing. What a pity.” Guo Ran shrugged helplessly.

Just then, He Changtian waved his hand, and a flame spear appeared in it. In an instant, the temperature of the air shot up. The intense flames caused the world to twist.

“Take out your weapon. Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance.” He Changtian pointed his spear at Xia Chen.

More and more people appeared in the surroundings. Long Chen saw Ji Wuming and the Nine Underworld Luocha among them, along with many experts with Supreme auras. All of them had powerful auras and gave off immense pressure.

“I have no weapon, nor do I need one. Go ahead and attack. I’d advise you not to waste time with probing blows or hold back your trump cards. Otherwise, your death would be very tragic,” said Xia Chen indifferently, clasping his hands behind his back.

These words startled countless people. They were unable to sense any Supreme aura or a powerful Blood Qi from his body. In fact, they couldn’t even sense a powerful Spiritual Strength. They had no idea where his confidence came from.

However, that chilling killing intent and the sense of danger he gave off were real. They were unable to understand this.

“Then you can just die!”

He Changtian roared furiously. After that, his manifestation burst into appearance behind him, and endless flames erupted. There was an ancient beast within his manifestation.

This beast roared, shaking the void and turning the sky red. This one roar actually summoned all the flame energy of heaven and earth out. It then rushed toward He Changtian.

“The Heavenly Ruler Seal Wild Lion. So that’s the case! The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s faith symbol is the Heavenly Ruler Seal Wild Lion!” Long Chen came to a sudden understanding.

The Heavenly Ruler Seal Wild Lion was a flame divine beast from ancient times. It had square feet which left footprints that were like a king’s seal. Those footprints could burn for hundreds of years without extinguishing.

However, despite being a flame divine beast, its own flame wasn’t very powerful. This beast relied on devouring other flames to cultivate and strengthen itself. Thus, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Flame was merely ranked sixty-third on the Heavenly Flame Ranking.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Its strong point was its devouring power and the power to merge other flames. Of course, when it came to devouring power, it was a far cry from being able to compare to the Yan Xu Flame. 

No matter how the Heavenly Ruler Seal Flame was strengthened, it would never be able to devour the flames in the top ten of the Heavenly Flame Ranking. It was fated that it would never be able to squeeze into the top ten in its entire lifetime.

Despite that, others would not dare to underestimate this flame. When He Changtian’s manifestation appeared, his armor also blazed with light, and countless runes lit up. As every scale let out a bestial roar, violent power erupted.

After that, He Changtian raised his spear and shook the flames of the world, which converged into his spear and then pierced toward Xia Chen. This spear exuded the breathtaking roars of ten thousand beasts!
