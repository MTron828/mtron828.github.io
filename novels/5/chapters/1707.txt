Chapter 1702 I’m a Clairvoyant

Translator: BornToBe

“Guo Ran!”

Seeing Guo Ran charge into the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils on his own, all the Dao Sect’s disciples let out startled cries. Even the Dragonblood warriors jumped in fright.

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were so strong that even Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan, and the others working together found it difficult to hold back their charge. They had forcibly formed a defensive line to keep them from charging past.

If a large number of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils charged through, then even the Dragonblood warriors would start dying, and if they reached the Dao Sect’s disciples? It would be like a tiger was let loose amongst a flock of sheep. That was why Meng Qi and the others had formed a line to keep them back.

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils crashed against their defensive line like angry waves. The pressure on them was immense. Only a small portion of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils managed to get by and reach the Dragonblood warriors.

The number of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils that reached the Dragonblood warriors was low enough that with their skillful cooperation, they were able to kill them quickly.

This moment showed the Dragonblood warriors’ truly terrifying aspect. They used the smallest price to kill the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, exchanging injuries for lives. That ruthlessness shook the hearts of the Dao Sect’s disciples.

Even if they were injured, the healing experts would quickly use a healing art on them, instantly healing them.

Hua Shiyu, Mu Qingxuan, Zhao Ziyan, Wang Zhen, and the other Empyreans formed another defensive line behind the Dragonblood Legion. They were also top geniuses with their own pride. Even in death, they were unwilling to be the useless cowards everyone else was defending.

Without Hua Shiyu’s orders, the stronger rank nine Celestials also came forward. They launched long-range attacks, alleviating some of the pressure on the warriors ahead of them. Although the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were very powerful, they were unable to break through their defenses.

However, at this time, Guo Ran flew forward on his own, shocking everyone. If he was caught in the midst of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, then no matter how many lives he had, it wouldn’t be enough.

“I swept through the four seas-”

“Shut up! Will you die if you don’t pose? Get to work!”

Guo Ran had just cleared his throat and started chanting his trademark phrase when he was cursed by Long Chen. He forcibly swallowed the following lines.

Long Chen was still fighting intensely against the long-haired man in the sky. A black saber and white bone spear repeatedly clashed. Their battle was exceptionally fierce, but Long Chen was still keeping an eye on the battlefield.

“Yes, boss!”

Guo Ran didn’t tarry. He suddenly spread his wings and put away his sabers. Six holes appeared on his wings. At the same time, a one-inch hole appeared on the armor on his palms and soles.

From those ten holes, jets of black water shot out. As Guo Ran flew through the air, a rain of black water fell.

“AHH!”

When the black water landed on the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, they let out mournful cries. Each drop corroded a large hole in their bodies.

It was like they were snowmen meeting boiling rain. Giant holes instantly appeared in them.

“What is this... AH!!!”

The black rain made the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils roar with pain. The black water was especially effective when it landed on their heads. That would almost instantly kill them.

Guo Ran flew back and forth, releasing the black rain. The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils quickly collapsed, and this scene stunned everyone. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Heavens, boss Guo Ran still had such a terrifying trump card? But he managed to hold it all the way until now... that’s out of character,” said one Dragonblood warrior.

Just what was this black water? How could it be so terrifying that even the bone swords of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils would corrode upon contact?

In the end, the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils corroded into nothing, leaving behind only a fist-sized bone from their heads. It was a strange kind of crystal core.

“Devil cores!”

Startled cries rang out. High ranking experts of the devil race would concentrate their live’s cultivation into a devil core, similar to a Magical Beast’s crystal core.

This kind of devil core was extremely valuable. It could be used in formations. Due to their special internal structure, they would automatically absorb energy from the air to support the formation, reducing the need for spending spiritual stones on maintaining it. They were priceless treasures that could keep a formation activated forever.

The bodies of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils weren’t able to resist the black water, but these devil cores weren’t harmed. They were preserved in perfect condition.

“Big sister Chu Yao, help me gather these devil cores. Those are treasures!” shouted Guo Ran as he sprayed more black water. The pressure on the others instantly lessened from his attack.

“Let me. That black water is toxic, and you shouldn’t touch it so easily. That bastard Guo Ran, he knew that if he told me to do it directly, I’d ignore him, so he asked you to. How loathsome.”

Chu Yao was just about to gather the devil cores when Liu Ruyan stopped her. The black water had touched everything, and that death qi would definitely harm Chu Yao if she used her wood energy to touch it.

As for Liu Ruyan, she was an Undying Willow and possessed a great resistance to this kind of death energy. When Long Chen’s black soil had annihilated other tree-demons, it hadn’t been able to kill her.

Countless roots silently came out of the ground and wrapped around the devil cores like tentacles, pulling them away.

“Boss Guo Ran is mighty! He’s first place!” shouted a Dragonblood warrior.

“He has seven kill points, with each one representing one trillion. Since each Empyrean Winged Blood Devil is worth one hundred million points, he has already killed almost seventy thousand of them.” Meng Qi sighed emotionally.

“Long Chen and Guo Ran are both scoundrels. They had such a powerful move but didn’t tell us. It really was frightening just now,” said Tang Wan-er hatefully.

There had been so many Empyrean Winged Blood Devils that it had caused despair. Yet, as soon as Guo Ran unleashed this black water, killing them felt easier than breathing. However, neither of them had told the others about this trump card, making Tang Wan-er worry for nothing.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, the long-haired man smashed into the ground like a shooting star.

Long Chen quickly followed him, slashing with his saber. The long-haired man was forced back once more.

“You should worry about yourself.” Long Chen lazily smiled at the long-haired man.

In their battle, the two of them had fought evenly. It went without saying that this long-haired man’s combat power was truly terrifying. However, he was unable to suppress Long Chen.

Seeing Guo Ran unleash a trump card that annihilated the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, the long-haired man had tried to fly toward Guo Ran, but he had been blocked by Long Chen.

“Bastard, you’re really provoking me!” The long-haired man suddenly roared. Divine light came from his head, covering his entire body. As he spread his wings, space tore apart and he vanished. He was using the previous ability he had used, something similar to teleportation. He was moving within space without anyone being able to track him.

Long Chen sneered and suddenly slashed Evilmoon behind him. Just as he slashed his saber, a figure appeared. It was the long-haired man that had just vanished.

It was like Long Chen had long since known his location and was welcoming him. The long-haired man was shocked. His hasty block resulted in him coughing up blood and miserably flying back.

“Impossible! The Heavenly Wing Space Tear divine ability has no flaws! How could you tell where I would appear?!” raged the long-haired man.

“Sorry to tell you this, but I’m a clairvoyant. I know the heavens, I know the earth, and I know everything in between. As soon as you clench your butt, I know what kind of fart you’re about to release. So everything about you is within my control. I couldn’t control when you were born, but I can control when you’ll die. It’s just up to my mood,” said Long Chen lightly.

“Bullshit!” The long-haired man spread his heavenly wings and vanished once more. Long Chen sneered and slashed his saber to the left, a bit ahead of him.

Space tore open in front of his saber, revealing the long-haired man. Half his arm was now gone, and blood covered his upper body.

This time, the saber had struck him while he was traveling through space, and it destroyed the space where he was going. If he hadn’t been strong enough, he would have been cut in two by this attack.

“Now do you believe it? Each of your movements, each of your actions is within my control. In front of me, you have no chance,” said Long Chen indifferently, pointing Evilmoon at him.

The long-haired man was caught between shock and rage. He was confident in his divine ability, but Long Chen was actually able to track him. He found it inconceivable.

“Long Chen, your bragging ability is unrivaled. Your face doesn’t even turn red. I have to admire how shameless you are. And this fellow really is an idiot. Does he not notice the black energy enveloping this space?” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen, a clairvoyant? That was naturally nonsense. He had stealthily spread the Black Illusion Dragon Flame’s energy throughout the space. This underground world was already full of darkness and ferocity, similar to the Black Illusion Dragon Flame. With how stealthy and how weak he spread it, the long-haired man hadn’t noticed it at all.

Every spatial fluctuation within this space was easily sensed by Long Chen thanks to this. That was the only reason he was able to track the long-haired man.

However, the long-haired man had no idea, so he was simply stunned by Long Chen’s words. As for Long Chen, he didn’t act lazy. He once more attacked.

The long-haired man was repeatedly forced back by Long Chen’s attacks. He was a bit timid and suppressed now.

In the sky, Long Chen had suppressed the long-haired man, while down below, Guo Ran was suppressing the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils. A shocking reversal had occurred on the battlefield.
