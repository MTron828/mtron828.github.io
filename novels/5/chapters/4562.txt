Chapter 4551 If You Don’t Like It, Fight

“Big Brother Long Chen, our eyes were blind before, and we deserve a thousand deaths for offending you. Please forgive us for our ignorance. You are a true expert.” After one of them spoke, all the top experts of the mixed beast race knelt on one knee toward Long Chen, their left hands over their chests. This was a custom reserved only for those whom the mixed beast race respected.

“What are you doing? Get up!” Seeing this scene, Long Chen instantly felt embarrassed.

When they looked at him with some disdain and even hostility, they were only concerned that some weak chicken was influencing Feng You. If Feng You got into a relationship with some weak-ass coward and a child was born between them, it could jeopardize the future of the mixed beast race.

As they were all thinking about their race’s future, Long Chen couldn’t blame them. After all, he had experienced challenges hundreds of times worse than theirs.

Furthermore, despite their cold treatment of him, when the battle commenced, especially when he appeared to be in danger, they risked their lives to protect him. This single gesture was enough for Long Chen to not harbor the slightest anger toward them.

After they saw Long Chen kill two terrifying experts, although there were also tricks involved, it was enough to win them over.

The mixed beast race’s experts were comparatively simple. They respected the strong. As long as you were strong enough, they would respect you.

“We’re all brothers fighting alongside each other on the battlefield. There’s no need for propriety. Come, I have more of those explosives. Each person can get one.” Long Chen actually started to hand out bombs like candies.

Feng You was by Long Chen’s side. Watching him distribute those bombs, she was also full of curiosity as to how something so small could have such power. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Feng You picked up one of those bombs for herself. She then tapped it with a finger, and the runes on the bomb suddenly lit up.

“Fuck!”

Long Chen instantly turned green and slapped Feng You’s hand. The bomb then went flying out of her hand.

BOOM!

The bomb obliterated the crowd beside them, emptying that large area and causing a rain of blood to fall.

Feng You covered her mouth, full of shock. As for the mixed beast race’s experts who had just gotten a bomb, they were all pale with fright.

It was fortunate that Long Chen had reacted fast enough, or the mixed beast race would have gone to their next reincarnation cycle. It would have been a freaking dumb way to die.

Feng You awkwardly stuck her head out, shrugging apologetically. “I’m sorry...”

Before Long Chen could even say anything, countless sharp gazes turned toward them, and icy killing intent locked onto them.

“Damn beast race, are you provoking the Blood race?!” A large group of experts turned toward the mixed beast race, gritting their teeth furiously.

The faction beside their territory was the Blood race. During their fight, the Blood race had simply watched, so they knew that the mixed beast race wasn’t a pushover. When the mixed beast race took over the Blood Gauze Sect’s territory, the Blood race intentionally pulled back a bit to show that they didn’t want any trouble.

The mixed beast race then entered a state of recuperation to show that they weren’t planning on fighting either, which caused the Blood race to relax.

Unfortunately, in their relaxed state, Feng You’s bomb produced a devastating result.

Caught completely off guard, hundreds of thousands of their experts were blasted apart. Furthermore, numerous experts were left injured in the aftermath.

“Sorry, it was an—!”

Feng You hastily apologized, but Long Chen suddenly stopped her. Pointing at the Blood race’s leader, he scolded, “Youngsters shouldn’t be too arrogant. So what if we bombed you? If you don’t like it, come fight!”

Long Chen took out even more bombs. Seeing that, the other members of the mixed beast race mimicked his throwing posture.

However, even though they were in throwing postures, their expressions were even more nervous than those from the Blood race. After all, they didn’t know how to activate these bombs, so they just focused on them to throw them at a moment’s notice.

“You...!” The Blood race’s experts seethed with anger. While they were stronger than the Blood Gauze Sect and their top experts were unafraid of those bombs, that didn’t mean that the rest weren’t.

Just three of those bombs could annihilate ninety-nine percent of their people. In the end, only a few of them would remain.

Furthermore, Feng You’s terrifying combat power and Long Chen’s strange techniques also frightened them. If they could, they didn’t want to fight.

“You? What you? Either fight or scram, your choice!” sneered Long Chen as he raised the bombs.

“You... you’re going too far!” roared one of the Blood race’s top experts.

“So what? I like it when you look like you want to kill me but can’t do shit to me!” Long Chen looked like he really needed a beating, driving the Blood race’s experts almost insane.

The Blood race’s experts quivered with rage, but they were also helpless. Seeing this scene, Feng You almost burst into laughter. She had never seen someone as interesting as Long Chen.

“Alright, count yourselves vicious! Just you wait! This debt will be settled later!” After saying that, the leader of the Blood race brought his people back.

“Hold it!” shouted Long Chen.

“What do you want?”

“Are you stupid or deaf? Did you not understand? I told you to fight or scram. Scram, understand?” Long Chen pointed to the rear.

“You...!” The Blood race’s experts were incensed. Now he wanted them to hand over their territory? Long Chen was being an intolerable bully.

“Oh? Little nephews, do you know what these things in uncle’s hands are? Should I release two more so that you learn your lesson?” Long Chen waved those bombs with a sinister smile.

In front of countless stunned gazes, Long Chen simply took over the Blood race’s territory. They were now one step closer to the gate.

Now, the mixed beast race’s experts looked at him as if he were a god. He had taken over a territory so effortlessly, a feat they had never dared to dream of. Just then, a jade plate on Long Chen’s waist started to flash, filling him with joy.
