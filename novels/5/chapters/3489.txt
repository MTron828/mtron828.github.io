Chapter 3478 Target, Violet Flame Heaven

BANG!

That bald man smashed into the wall. Although he had a sturdy body, he was like dough smashing into the wall. His body was completely deformed.

The bald man then slid down with a creaking sound, and his blood stained the wall. For a moment, everyone was struck dumb.

This was a powerful Immortal King whose appearance was as ominous as a fiend. No one had dared to provoke him. Thus, when they saw the more refined-looking Long Chen send him flying with a slap, all their jaws dropped.

Long Chen had been holding back a belly full of fire. This fellow was the most arrogant one here, occupying an area of several square meters just for himself. If Long Chen didn’t put him in his place, he wouldn’t be Long Chen.

That bald man slid down. Half of his face was swollen like a pig’s, while the other half was caved in. The handprint was still clear, looking both bizarre and funny.

However, no one laughed. They were all staring in shock from Long Chen to that bald man. They all knew that both of them were very tyrannical existences.

That bald man suddenly coughed up blood and slowly stood, flames almost bursting out of his eyes. It was such a frightening sight that the others around him fled.

“If you want to die, then come.” Long Chen didn’t even look at him. He took out a blanket and sat lotus-style where the bald man had been sitting.

Shocking everyone, that bald man just looked at Long Chen and found a new place for himself. In the end, he didn’t dare to attack.

He chose a new place, and the people there hastily squeezed to the sides to make room for him. Although his space was now a bit smaller, it was more than enough for him.

Clearly, he was afraid of causing trouble for Long Chen. Long Chen had long since seen that this person was a fake.

He was nothing more than a Spirit tier Immortal King, and a very ordinary one at that. Such a figure could be killed in droves with a single slap from Long Chen, but this fellow wanted to show off here? Long Chen had given him a simple slap just as a warning. If he dared to retaliate, Long Chen wouldn’t be so courteous.

Entering just behind Long Chen was a brother-and-sister pair. The little sister was shaking. It seemed that she had never seen such a thing before.

“If you want to sit, then sit. I don’t need this much space for myself.” Long Chen smiled slightly at this frightened little girl.

“Then many thanks.” The big brother hesitated but ultimately brought his little sister over to sit beside Long Chen.

There were two of them, and the surroundings were packed. So, it was difficult for them to find a good spot. Since they didn’t want to separate and Long Chen had invited them, they directly sat.

Seeing that Long Chen was not rejecting people from his space, the others coming in all brazenly walked over to his side, first thanking Long Chen before sitting.

This level gradually returned to its noisy state. People once more began to chat, and many people that didn’t know each other introduced themselves. All of them were excited.

Through listening to their conversations, Long Chen learned that less than half of these people came from this locality. The majority were from other star-fields.

They had spent their life’s savings to buy a ticket to the Violet Flame Heaven. Moreover, it wasn’t just a ticket but a chance that they dreamed of, a new cultivation world that they had only heard of in legends.

The majority of the people here had good talents, but they didn’t have much confidence in their eyes.

To put it frankly, they were all poor people. Many of them had used up almost their entire family savings to buy the ticket. Some people were carrying the hopes of their entire families. To sum it up, they were full of hope and anticipation for the future.

Seeing their excited expressions, Long Chen sighed inside. The stronger the place, the harsher the competition. Although there would be more opportunities, there would also be more cruel pitfalls that devoured people without leaving a trace.

Unable to achieve their dreams in the Darklight Heaven, they thought that they could grasp an opportunity to soar in the Violet Flame Heaven? That wasn’t realistic.

However, seeing their hopeful expressions toward the future, Long Chen was also affected. Wasn’t life simply this way? You could choose to change your life, or you could choose to not change it at all.

If you lived a calm and peaceful life with no excitement all the way until you were old, what would be the point?

Long Chen suddenly smiled as he felt like he had gotten old. Even the viewpoint from which he looked at things was not the same as these people.

“Big brother, where are you from?” Long Chen was surprised that the little sister of the brother-sister pair would take the initiative to speak to him.

“Little Rui!”

Her big brother jumped in horror, glaring at her. It was very rude to ask for someone’s origins as soon as they met. Many experts would have a bad reaction to this.

He hastily said to Long Chen, “Brother, my apologies. This little sister of mine doesn’t know manners. Please don’t take offense.”

Long Chen smiled slightly. “It’s fine. I heard that the journey is quite long. We can chat to pass the time. I came from a very far-off place. You wouldn’t know it even if I told you. I suppose that you two must be from the Shoreside Star-Field?”

“Oh? Big brother, how did you know?” Little Rui stared at Long Chen with her eyes wide open.

This Little Rui might not look particularly beautiful, but she did have a warm and sweet air to her. She was still innocent and didn’t have any scheming inside her at all. Hence, Long Chen couldn’t help but have a good feeling toward her.

“You guys have the particular aura of the laws of the Shoreside Star-Field. It’s very easy to recognize,” explained Long Chen.

The Shoreside Star-Field’s native experts consumed medicinal pills that were mostly refined out of the demonic beasts from the bottom of the sea. As an alchemist, it was very easy for Long Chen to distinguish this.

“You’re right, we are native to this place. Ah, my apologies, this junior brother is Bai Fang, and this junior sister is Bai Rui. May I ask for brother’s name?” Only then did Bai Fang notice that he hadn’t introduced himself.

“I am Long Chen.” Long Chen didn’t conceal his name. In any case, no one here knew him.

“I didn’t think that big brother Long Chen was so amazing. Plus, you’re very nice and friendly! You look really good when you smile!” said Bai Rui, seemingly not afraid of him at all.

Long Chen was speechless. It seemed that his random smile, when he was thinking about how old he had gotten, had caused this girl to no longer fear him.

As time passed, more and more people came in, so this place became more and more packed. Occasionally, someone from the ship would come in and shout at them.

They said that there was still space in the middle level, so if anyone didn’t want to stay packed here, they could pay the difference for a better room.

When Long Chen saw that the person shouting was the one who had stopped him, his anger once more flared. This bastard, was he intentionally trying to anger him?

After a few hours, the ship began to quiver slightly, and a cheer rang out.

“We’re setting off!”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The giant ship slowly began to move, braving the winds and waves, pushing forward with ever-increasing speed. The land quickly vanished from Long Chen’s vision.

A slight smile appeared on his lips. Violet Flame Heaven, Boss Long San is coming. Are you prepared?
