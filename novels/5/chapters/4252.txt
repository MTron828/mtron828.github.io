Chapter 4241: Terrifying Lian Yuying

“What?!”

After receiving this message from Mo Nian, Long Chen’s heart couldn’t help but tremble.

“I underestimated this formation. This Sage King Prefecture is actually only the eye of the formation, and the entire formation might be spread throughout the entire Nirvana Overflow Heaven. This should be considered a heavenly grand formation, one linked to the other domains and even the Netherworld. Look at my crystal coffin, it is an Eternal divine weapon, but it was unable to shake the pillar of light in the slightest. Furthermore, the backlash was so intense that it damaged it. After all, our realms aren’t high enough to draw out the true power of Eternal divine weapons. Even if no one was stopping us, we wouldn’t be able to rattle this grand formation,” transmitted Mo Nian.

He was still in a fight with Yan Wuji and had already put away the crystal coffin after failing. The fact that it was damaged aggrieved him to death.

He hadn’t expected this grand formation to be this terrifying. Even an Eternal divine weapon was damaged from striking it.

Long Chen was also stunned by this. An Eternal divine weapon was powerless against the formation? Then it was impossible to break, unless they had an Eternal expert using an Eternal divine weapon.

“Must I use the Heaven Earth Cauldron?”

Long Chen muttered to himself inside. But if he did use the Heaven Earth Cauldron, there would be no going back. One of the ten primal chaos divine items would be fully exposed, and he might not be able to leave the Sage King Prefecture alive.

Just as Long Chen was struggling with this, a voice reached him. “Big brother Long Chen, let me try it.”

It was Dong Mingyu. Long Chen instantly thought of the mysterious dagger that he had dragged out of the Nether River.

“No, your defenses aren’t strong enough. You might not be able to endure the formation’s backlash. Give me the dagger,” said Long Chen.

Suddenly, the space beside Long Chen quivered, shocking Long Chen. With a random swipe of his hand, a dagger appeared in his grasp.

Long Chen was shocked. It seemed that Dong Mingyu was right beside him, but he was unable to sense her at all.

Dong Mingyu had originally been with Meng Qi, Yu Qingxuan, Tang Wan-er, and the others, helping Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan. However, at some point, she had arrived beside him, and he himself hadn’t even noticed it.

Even so, he wasn’t the only one. Even the Ghost Dao lifeform and Ye Wuchen had not noticed it. Dong Mingyu’s skill in concealing herself had truly grown to a terrifying realm.

Once again, a dragon claw sliced through the void, colliding head-on with the Ghost Dao lifeform's claw. This time, sparks ignited, and an unexpected metallic ringing reverberated through the air.

In this clash, it seemed that Long Chen was at a disadvantage, as he shot back toward the pillar of light. Furthermore, his momentum was even greater than when Ye Wuchen had been sent smashing into it.

In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Chen smashed into that light pillar. Seeing this scene, Ye Wuchen smiled vengefully. Only he knew just how terrifying the backlash was.

Just then, Long Chen’s body suddenly became covered in dragon scales, and a pitch-black dagger appeared in his hand, stabbing toward the light pillar.

BANG!

Black light stabbed into the pillar, rending it as if it were mere paper. The once seemingly impervious pillar of light, which neither Ye Wuchen nor Mo Nian had been able to break, now appeared incredibly weak in front of this black dagger.

The next moment, Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. His wings then blazed like a sun, and he shot back with his absolute greatest speed. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

BOOM!

The pillar of light exploded like a volcano that had been accumulating power for billions of years, unleashing all of it through a tiny hole. The released power surged uncontrollably, running rampant in all directions.

Moreover, the moment Long Chen attacked the light pillar, the dark domain lord came flooding out of it, its enormous body akin to a meteor falling from beyond the heavens.

Long Chen dodged as quickly as possible, barely avoiding being crushed by the dark domain lord. Just the wind from its falling body cut his face.

Seeing that enormous body flying toward him, the Ghost Dao lifeform panicked. He then transformed into a wisp of smoke, vanishing from heaven and earth. He had just vanished when the dark domain lord crushed the space where he had just been.

The Ghost Dao lifeform managed to avoid it, but the experts behind him weren’t as lucky. Countless experts were crushed to dust by the dark domain lord’s enormous body.

The enormous body ran through over half of the martial stage, and the Blood and devil race’s experts were the most unlucky, their troops being cut in two by it.

BOOM!

The dark domain lord then smashed into the barrier around the martial stage, unleashing such a loud booming noise that countless people covered their ears, blood pouring out from between their fingers. They could no longer hear the slightest thing after that.

The dark domain lord seemed to be struck dizzy by that impact and then looked around in confusion. Suddenly, it let out a heaven-shaking roar and started a slaughter.

This dark domain lord’s giant body was like an unstoppable vajra. It pounded its arms into the ground, leaving countless experts with no room to evade, resulting in their immediate death.

Seeing this scene, countless people panicked. That was an existence on par with innate Heaven Venerates, and not just any, but the cream of the crop. It was clear that ordinary individuals stood no chance against such a formidable force.

“Long Chen, you goddamn bastard, you’re trying to get us all killed!”

Curses rang out as people fled. After all, the dark domain lord didn’t seem to care about anything. Its eyes were scarlet, looking insane as it pursued everyone.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the dark domain lord quivered. An enormous black lily had appeared in front of it, and its lily leaves rapidly covered it.

The dark domain lord was absolutely enormous, but in front of the heaven-shrouding lily leaves, it still appeared small. It was instantly covered.

The dark domain lord roared, its sharp claws tearing through the lily leaves. However, before it could escape, more leaves covered up the opening. They were like layers of silk firmly wrapping it.

More and more layers quickly covered the dark domain lord. In the blink of an eye, eighteen layers had firmly surrounded it. At first, the dark domain lord had been crazily struggling and occasionally tearing through the bindings, but after the tenth one, it could only wiggle inside of its prison, unable to tear through its bindings. By the eighteenth one, it seemed fully sealed, unable to even move.

Just then, they heard a strange sound, akin to a beast gulping down water. It was a sound that made people’s hair stand on end.

The next moment, the lily leaves slowly opened, one layer at a time. When all the leaves were gone, people saw that the dark domain lord was no more, and a pile of bones clattered to the ground. This sight sent shivers through their spines, as they stared in horror at that enormous lily.

The lily then vanished, transforming into a woman. She was the Devil Eye Water Lily’s princess, Lian Wuying.

Lian Wuying still had some blood at the corner of her mouth, and her aura had grown even more terrifying. With a devilish light flickering in her eyes, she smiled, radiating sheer bloodlust from her smile.

“This farce has gone on long enough. All subordinates of the Undying race, kill Long Chen and everyone connected to him!”

After Lian Wuying gave the order, millions and millions of the Undying race’s experts flooded toward Long Chen.
