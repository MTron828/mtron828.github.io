Chapter 4582 Wake Up! Stop Sleeping!

After leaving the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, Long Chen didn’t head in the direction of the Sovereign clan’s ancestral scale. Instead, he went to the left, toward another dragon nest.

Through questioning a group of the Netherdragon race’s experts, he learned that their dragon nest was seventeen nests away from the white dragon race’s nest.

At the same time, he also gained a general understanding of the dragon cemetery’s setup. This dragon cemetery was originally a supreme Ten Thousand Dragon Nest made of tens of thousands of Ten Thousand Dragon Nests.

The dragon cemetery, a sacred burial ground for dragons, bore witness to the passage of time. The outer regions that were once vibrant with life now lay barren, their nests depleted of core energy and became dead nests.

However, the nests in the core region remained intact and brimming with vitality. Here lay ninety-nine nests made by the main pillars of the dragon race, and they were all extremely powerful.

Among these ninety-nine dragon races were the white dragon race and the Netherdragon race. They encircled one giant Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, the domain of the Sovereign clan.

Throughout the ages, only a very few people had ever managed to enter the Sovereign clan’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Legend had it that it was futile to subdue their ancestral scale, and those who tried to force their way through would be annihilated by the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest’s laws.

That was why there was no one in the Sovereign clan’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, and everyone was working on communing with their own race’s ancestral scale. Hence, Long Chen was in no rush to go there. Every Ten Thousand Dragon Nest led to the Sovereign clan’s nest in the end, so Long Chen simply treated this as taking a detour.

Long Chen passed one nest after another. Some of the ancestral scales had awoken, but some were still in slumber.

Long Chen also faced a great deal of vigilance on his way as he passed through the nests. Some dragon experts refused to allow him through, only to be sent flying with a slap.

As their peak experts were working on awakening their ancestral scales, no one could stop Long Chen. The weaker ones couldn’t possibly beat him, so they could only let him through.

Long Chen quickly reached another Ten Thousand Dragon Nest with black qi swirling around it. The aura of the Netherworld filled this place.

Without hesitation, Long Chen swaggered in brazenly. This dragon nest was different from the others. It was shrouded in a thick mist that obscured his vision.

When Long Chen reached the core, he was startled to find that this place was packed to the brim with experts of the Netherdragon race. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At the very least, there were several million of them here. They sat on the ground, their Blood Qi swirling around them. He could see specks of divine light rising out of them and flowing toward the core.

When Long Chen arrived, these people didn’t even look at him as they all focused on this ceremony.

Long Chen walked over and saw a giant black dragon scale floating at the core. Its formidable presence sent shivers down the spines of those present, resonating with an ancient ferocity that seemed to transcend time and space.

As it was absorbing the Blood Qi of all the Netherdragon experts here, the black dragon scale radiated with countless shining runes, while specks of mist emanated from its surface.

This mist then coalesced into a viscous black liquid, slowly dripping down the scale before landing upon a black-haired man seated beneath it. Upon contact, the liquid caused ripples and runes to appear around him. At that moment, a distinct dragon head mark materialized on his forehead, while nine stars flickered in the space behind him.

“Netherdragon Tianzhao!”

Long Chen was startled to see this man—the same Netherdragon Tianzhao whom Long Chen had almost slain before.

However, his aura had completely transformed, and there were nine stars behind his head.

“Is he trying to become a nine-star Heavenly Doyen?”

Long Chen jumped in shock upon seeing those stars. Now, Netherdragon Tianzhao possessed a supreme divine pressure around him and overflowing Blood Qi; his aura had transcended all others.

“This is... the Nether Emperor’s aura.”

Long Chen suddenly realized what he was sensing. Back then, this fellow had sacrificed himself to the Nether Emperor, and now, he had managed to obtain the power of the Nether Emperor.

Seeing the drops of liquid from the black dragon scale landing on Netherdragon Tianzhao, Long Chen knew that he had only managed to reach this step thanks to the Nether Emperor’s power. Netherdragon Tianzhao had started the process of subduing the ancestral scale, perhaps already on the verge of succeeding.

“I have to stop him!”

Long Chen’s heart pounded because Netherdragon Tianzhao had the power of the Nether Emperor. If he were to also obtain the power of this ancestral scale, who in the world could stop him?

Long Chen didn’t conceal his aura and just walked right over to the ancestral scale. All these experts had their eyes closed and didn’t pay any attention to him.

Once he got closer to the dragon scale, the ancestral scale quivered as it sensed his killing intent.

If he were to proceed any further, the ancestral scale would give off a warning. As this ancestral scale was merging with Netherdragon Tianzhao, they were on the same side. Long Chen couldn’t find a way to sneak attack him.

“Whatever.”

Long Chen gritted his teeth and gave up any thought of killing Netherdragon Tianzhao. He then started walking toward Netherdragon Tianzhao, and this time, the ancestral scale didn’t react.

Long Chen realized that with the help of the ancestral white dragon, his primal bloodline had been activated, allowing him to resonate with the Netherdragon race’s ancestral scale without encountering any rejection.

However, this ancestral scale didn’t condone his killing intent toward Netherdragon Tianzhao. It naturally wouldn’t let Long Chen kill its predecessor. If Long Chen had continued to harbor that killing intent, it might have even attacked him or alerted Netherdragon Tianzhao.

After giving up on killing Netherdragon Tianzhao, Long Chen could brazenly walk right over. There were fewer people near Netherdragon Tianzhao, but they were all incredibly strong.

To Long Chen’s surprise, the outer ring around Netherdragon Tianzhao had dozens of seven-star Heavenly Doyens. With so many experts protecting him, no wonder he dared to so brazenly absorb the power of the ancestral scale.

When Long Chen passed by one of those experts, the latter’s eyes suddenly flew open. His senses were so sharp that even in a meditative state, he still sensed Long Chen.

When he saw Long Chen, he was both shocked and enraged. He reached for his weapon, and a chilling aura of killing intent surrounded Long Chen.

However, Long Chen remained calm and composed in the face of this hostility. He gestured to the enraged individual, indicating that he harbored no ill intentions. With a silent gesture, he motioned for the person to remain quiet and not disturb Netherdragon Tianzhao.

That expert furrowed his brow, maintaining his defensive stance but refraining from making any rash moves. After all, Netherdragon Tianzhao was in a critical moment. If he was disturbed, it might stop this merger.

Long Chen stayed still and then gestured a few times to the expert to indicate that he was here to help.

After that, Long Chen walked toward Nehterdragon Tianzhao once more. While that expert was startled, he didn’t dare to attack or make a sound, only gesturing for Long Chen to step back. Otherwise, he would kill him.

However, Long Chen ignored him and walked right up to Netherdragon Tianzhao. He then raised his hand, and in front of that expert’s horrified gaze, he slapped Netherdragon Tianzhao in the face.

“Hey, wake up! Stop sleeping!”

Pow!

An explosive sound resounded throughout the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.
