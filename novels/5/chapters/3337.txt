Chapter 3326 Fearless

“You want to kill me? Just with that little fish behind you? Are you trying to make me laugh to death? Let alone you with your slightest trace of the Kun’s bloodline, even if you had the Kunpeng’s bloodline, do you think that I’d be afraid?”

While facing Kun Wu’s attack, Long Chen’s hot blood surged. Kun Wu’s power provoked his battle intent. Fighting true experts set his blood ablaze.

BOOM!

A fearless expert only attacked. There was no retreat, especially not in the very first clash. If someone dodged the very first slash, they would clearly appear weaker, a silent admittance of having a weaker aura. That would only create an opening for killing blows to fall upon them.

In a battle between true experts, it was always a clash of power against power. There weren’t many tricks to be used. Those kinds of tricks were always games played by the strong against the weak, allowing them to beat their enemies with the least amount of effort.

At this moment, two sabers collided, shaking the heavens. The stars rocked and the land quaked. Countless cracks spread in every direction.

“Activate the city’s grand formation!” shouted an Immortal King. This terrifying power might even destroy the capital city.

This one attack caused heaven and earth to collapse. Some weaker experts directly fled back to the city. Only the Immortal Kings and some powerful heavenly geniuses continued to watch from just outside the barrier.

Strange sounds came from space as the two sabers clashed. Two immense forces fought against each other. Space cracked, as if it might shatter.

BOOM!

Kun Wu’s body quivered, and he was forced back a step. With that one step, the ground beneath his foot collapsed into a giant hole.

Everyone was shocked by this. Kun Wu had summoned his Great Kun manifestation and activated his ancient bloodline, but he was still suppressed by Long Chen. Just how powerful was Long Chen?

“The power of the Great Kun? It’s only at this level. Compared to my dragon blood, you are greatly lacking. Someone with such an impure bloodline also dares to be arrogant?” Long Chen continued to press down on Kun Wu. Endless power surged out of him. With the support of Heavenly Dao energy, Long Chen had leaped to a level that even he hadn’t dared to imagine. It felt like he had limitless power.

“Bullshit!”

Kun Wu was enraged and shocked. With his Great Kun bloodline activated, his current power was even comparable to a Spirit tier Immortal King. But he was still suppressed.

“A beast really is a beast. Other than spouting crap from your mouth, do you have no other ability?” Long Chen sneered and suddenly pressed down. As the ancient runes on his bone saber lit up, devil qi erupted.

Kun Wu instantly felt like his arms were about to break. He almost coughed up blood.

In all his life, Kun Wu had never experienced such a terrifying power. His Great Kun bloodline was unable to bear a single blow in front of Long Chen.

Kun Wu was forced further and further back. With every step back he took, the earth beneath him collapsed.

Just as Kun Wu was forced further and further back, a spear erupting with devil qi stabbed toward Long Chen’s back.

Mo Yan had joined in. Devil qi was erupting out of his spatial gate, causing his aura to grow several times stronger. The Ten Thousand Devil Diagram on his wings had also changed color.

Mo Yan had been unable to unleash his full power as there wasn’t enough devil qi in the immortal world for him to use. But all the devil qi pouring out his spatial gate finally allowed him to fight at full power. So, right at the start, he launched a killing blow. His spear was like a fiend’s fang, and even laws were corroded by it.

“Does your face not hurt?”

Long Chen shoved his saber forward, pushing Kun Wu back, and then swung his saber in a strange arc behind him. He didn’t even look back. It was like he had an eye on the back of his head. His saber perfectly struck Mo Yan’s spear.

Mo Yan grunted. After that, his sleeves exploded and blood leaked out of his mouth. He was sent flying.

“Despicable!”

Mo Yan was enraged. Long Chen’s blow contained Kun Wu’s power within it as well. Hence, Mo Yan had essentially received a blow from Long Chen and Kun Wu at the same time.

This one attack shattered his insides. If it weren’t for the support of all this devil qi, allowing him to dispel a bit of this power into the air, that attack could have killed him.

Long Chen was truly sinister. Now, Mo Yan even suspected that Long Chen had planned to suppress Kun Wu and absorb his power from the start, just so that he could kill the next unsuspecting attacker. As for Mo Yan, he was the unlucky one to fall for it.

Fortunately, he had plenty of devil qi. Otherwise, he would already be dead. That enraged him but also made him feel fear.

Mo Yan cursed Long Chen for being despicable, but Long Chen sighed inside regretfully. Mo Yan’s power had surpassed his expectations slightly. He had thought that this would be enough to kill him, and then it would be a perfect display.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Just then, more attacks rained down upon him. The Netherworld’s expert also came charging over. Just like Mo Yan, the Nethergate’s spatial gate behind him provided him with endless death qi, causing his aura to be far stronger than before. He was like an entirely different person.

“Long Chen, if you have guts, receive this attack!” shouted the Netherworld expert.

He had a pitch-black rod in his hand, and it was covered in strange marks. Death qi overflowed out of it. Just looking at it terrified others. This was a King item from the Netherworld.

The rod smashed down, shattering the void. Its power completely sealed all paths of retreat, forcing Long Chen to receive it directly.

Normally, Long Chen wouldn’t be afraid of receiving such an attack. However, the other experts were also joining in and attacking. If he were to receive this attack directly, then the killing attacks of the others would land at the same time. Against so many attacks from these powerful experts, even he would be killed.

“How childish.” Long Chen sneered. Did they take him for a fool? They were playing such a simple game with him?

With the endless death qi locking him down, Long Chen snorted. Lightning wings spread on his back, and he suddenly shot toward one of the other experts.

The Netherworld’s expert was shocked. Long Chen was able to ignore his lock? To do that at this point, Long Chen’s mental energy had to be several times greater than his.

Long Chen didn’t give them a chance to surround him. He charged toward a lifeform covered in black scales and slashed his saber.

That expert’s expression changed. Amongst all of them, Long Chen just had to choose him. Just then, Long Chen’s mental lock fell upon him. He didn’t dare to flee.

So, he smashed his weapon at Long Chen, only for his expression to freeze as soon as their weapons collided. From the start, he hadn’t been planning on fighting Long Chen directly. He had been planning on using Long Chen’s power to fly back and escape his attack range.

However, when their weapons collided, his weapon actually stuck to Long Chen’s bone saber like glue.

Just as his plan failed, before he could react, Long Chen’s left hand punched through his head, blasting his head apart and killing him.
