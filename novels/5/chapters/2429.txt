Chapter 2419 Something Wrong With the Brain

Translator: BornToBe

“Killing people.”

The ancient family alliance’s experts began to curse at him, infuriated by Long Chen’s attitude.

“Long Chen, what are you trying to do? You came to the headquarters of the ancient family alliance to kill people?!”

“What an absolute tyrant?! When did the ancient family alliance provoke you?!”

“Do you really think no one can handle you? Senior Feng Fei is here right now, and you still dare to act so arrogant?”

Di Long waved his hand, causing them to shut their mouths. “Long Chen, I don’t know how my ancient family alliance has offended you, but please tell me. If we really did something wrong, I will immediately apologize. But if you came here just to cause trouble, then although we are weaker, we will not allow anyone to humiliate us.”

“Hahahaha!” Long Chen laughed as if he had heard the world’s funniest joke.

“What are you laughing at?” demanded Di Long.

Long Chen stopped laughing and looked at the father-son duo. “I’m laughing at how interesting you are. You are actually playing such a childish game with me. You want to use someone else’s blade to kill me?”

“What nonsense are you spouting? If you have something to say, say it directly!” shouted Di Feng coldly.

Long Chen lazily said, “You launched a sneak attack on the Mo family and laid down a trap for me. If you killed me with that trap, then good. If you didn’t, then you would draw me here and act innocent so that someone else would help you? Not bad, not bad. Very interesting.”

Di Feng’s expression sank. “Long Chen, you’re too arrogant! If the ancient family alliance wishes to deal with you, then I am enough on my own! Do you think I’m afraid of you!?”

“Feng-er, don’t waste words with him. He’s just trying to cause trouble.” Di Long said, “Long Chen, if you want revenge, you should just do it directly. Don’t make up such immature excuses. Today, we’ll show you that the spine of the ancient family alliance will not bend to anyone.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Di Long turned to Feng Fei and apologized. “I am truly sorry senior Feng Fei. You only just came, but I have failed as a host. This is a personal problem of my ancient family alliance, so I will have to ask you not to interfere. Even if every person within the ancient family alliance must fight to the death, we will not accept other people’s insults.”

Feng Fei frowned. She looked at Long Chen and coldly said, “Long Chen, can you not cause trouble? The Martial Heaven Continent is starting to enter the dark era. Is there a point in killing our own people?”

Long Chen looked at Feng Fei and shook his head. He sighed, “Although I know that a conflict with you is precisely what these two want, I have to say that you really irritate me. Did you get water in your head? Without even determining the truth, you call me someone who stirs up trouble and kills allies? Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with your brain?”

Long Chen was angry. This Feng Fei was really stupid. Di Long and Di Feng were putting on a show for her to see, and it seemed that she didn’t notice at all.

He had originally been hoping to explain things to her, but now he didn’t even have a desire to try.

Long Chen understood their plan now. They had attacked the Mo family to draw him out. As for their killing formation, they didn’t have much hope for that. If it failed, that would definitely infuriate Long Chen and draw him over here.

He didn’t know why Feng Fei was here, but it definitely wasn’t a coincidence. The Di family definitely didn’t have the power to invite her here. Most likely, the Ye family was behind it.

With Feng Fei visiting, the Di family would definitely go all-out to receive her and give her a good impression. Perhaps that included some rumors about Long Chen that created lots of hostility toward him.

Although he didn’t know the exact course of events, he found this general plan to be not bad. Feng Fei was incredibly powerful, but as someone from the divine families, she had been respected from a young age, so no one would dare to use schemes like this against her.

As a result, such a simple plot had worked wonders on her. She was directly against Long Chen.

“Brazen Long Chen, you dare to disrespect senior Feng Fei?!” In the distance, Feng Fei’s attendants cursed at him. They had followed her for many years and had never witnessed someone be so rude to her. He even called her a brainless woman.

“Senior Feng Fei, as long as you give the word, I will immediately kill him for you!” Feng Fei’s attendants had taken out their swords.

“What? If you have an illness, you should accept it instead of killing people who bring it up,” sneered Long Chen. “Did I say something wrong? This is such a clear trap, yet Feng Fei has jumped into it to be used by them. If that doesn’t mean that there’s a problem with her brain, what does it mean?”

“Long Chen!” Di Feng shouted. “You can insult me, but you can’t insult senior Feng Fei! Immediately kowtow and apologize!”

“Kowtow and apologize? I’ve never seen such a thing before. Why don’t you teach me how by doing it yourself?” sneered Long Chen.

“You…!” Di Feng gasped, not knowing how to respond.

Feng Fei stepped forward. “Are you forcing me to kill you? Just your disrespect toward me is enough to give me countless reasons to kill you. The Long family wouldn’t be able to protect you.”

“My disrespect to you?” Long Chen had an inconceivable expression on his face. “Why would I have to respect you at all? Respect must be mutual. You don’t respect me, so why should I respect you? Are you a Sovereign? Well, not even a Sovereign forced everyone to respect them. Do you think you’re someone even above the Sovereign?”

The more he spoke, the more Long Chen felt that this term, disrespect, was incredibly laughable and nauseating.

“Long Chen, you’ve antagonized me multiple times now. If I keep being accommodating to you, you’ll think that I’m afraid of you. Come, I’ll give you a chance. Use your full power so I can see if you can last even ten exchanges against me.” Feng Fei was finally enraged. Her eyes were icy. His aura began to unfurl, filling the air with an invisible pressure.

Feng Fei hadn’t even fully unleashed her aura. This was just her aura starting to leak out from her anger, but the pressure she gave off was not at all inferior to any fourth step Netherpassage expert. Once her full power was unleashed, just how terrifying would she be?

Di Long and Di Feng exchanged a glance. They were both shocked at how powerful Feng Fei was. But within that shock was also some delight. Things were going much smoother than they had anticipated. They had arranged many backup plans that they no longer needed.

“Give it up and put away your intimidating aura. Even if you are powerful, you don’t really intend to kill me, so it’s meaningless. If you just want to teach me a lesson, then let’s skip it. I’m specialized in killing people. As for exchanging blows, I don’t have the time nor energy to waste on that.” Long Chen shook his head.

Although Feng Fei was enraged, Long Chen didn’t sense much killing intent. She just wanted to defeat him to vent.

Precisely due to that, Long Chen didn’t care to fight with her. His specialty wasn’t in exchanging blows but in killing.

“If you’re afraid, then you’re afraid. Making up some grand lie to cover up your cowardice is shameless. Since you’ve admitted you’re not a match for senior Feng Fei, kneel and apologize. Senior Feng Fei is magnanimous and will definitely let you off,” said one of Feng Fei’s attendants disdainfully.

“I’ve heard that Long Chen is domineering and arrogant, but this is it?”

“Rumors are just rumors. His true face has been shown today.”

“He likes to provoke senior Feng Fei, but once she’s mad, he doesn’t even dare to let out a fart. What kind of crap is this?”

“This is the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one expert of the junior generation? Trash.”

The ancient family alliance’s experts began to add in their own taunts, doing their best to anger Long Chen.

Suddenly, a pill furnace appeared behind Long Chen’s back. Its runes lit up, and a strange fluctuation spread.

“Long Chen, you!” Feng Fei jumped. She recognized that pill furnace to be a demon furnace.

The experts who had just mocked Long Chen suddenly felt something pounding in their heads. Following that, their heads exploded.

In an instant, hundreds of the ancient family alliance’s experts were slain. They died without even understanding how they died. As a result, an uproar exploded amongst the ancient family alliance’s experts.

“A group of ants dares to make a racket? You should quiet down.” The Demon Moon Furnace’s runes were emitting a bewitching light that illuminated Long Chen. That light was sinister and frightening.

Both Di Long and Di Feng were shocked. They had no idea that Long Chen possessed such a terrifying move. No one, including Feng Fei, had been able to stop it.

“Breaking open the demon heart to consume a person. I didn’t think that you had merged your soul with a demonic weapon. No wonder you’re so arrogant. Fine, since you have such a powerful demonic weapon, you should be qualified to have a battle with me.” After a moment of shock, battle intent rose within Feng Fei. The appearance of the Demon Moon Furnace made her want to fight Long Chen even more.
