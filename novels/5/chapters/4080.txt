Chapter 4069 Demon Tide

While sailing on the heavenly river, there was no wind or waves. Hence, for there to be wind now, there must be a landmass a day’s travel away.

Everyone was excited to set foot onto the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, a world on an even higher level than the Violet Flame Heaven.

However, this also meant that there were more dangers there. This higher level referred to the fact that the laws of the Heavenly Daos were more complete there, along with more intact inheritances.

Based on it, the Violet Flame Heaven was more intact than the Darklight Heaven, and the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was even more well preserved than the Violet Flame Heaven. Here, countless ancient inheritances had been fully preserved through the ancient battles.

However, the stronger the world, the greater the competition. As the fighting got even more intense, the outcome was also crueler. Many heavenly geniuses that had crossed heavens to come here silently fell within this competition, becoming other people’s stepping stones.

In order to survive within this cruel world, you needed to obey a few laws of survival or had some trump cards that would allow you to adapt to this new environment.

When it came to the heavenly geniuses that came from outside this heaven, perhaps they did have the ability to compete with the native heavenly geniuses, but they didn’t have the sufficient backgrounds.

As for the natives, they were naturally arrogant and looked down on any outsiders. They viewed the latter as frogs at the bottom of a well who had not seen the world.

Thus, it was very difficult for outsiders to integrate themselves into this place. Even if they tried to seek shelter at some sects, those sects would keep a close eye on them and conduct a thorough investigation, not trusting the outsiders fully.

Unless you were willing to have a slave mark placed on you, it was difficult to get anyone to accept you. But heavenly geniuses were heavenly geniuses, and to become someone else’s slave was unacceptable to them.

Of course, it couldn’t be blamed on the sects for not trusting outsiders. After all, the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was different from the Violet Flame Heaven. In the Violet Flame Heaven, although there were many other races, the majority of cultivators were still human. Only a small portion were demonic beasts, and there were even less of other races.

On the other hand, in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, humans were only twenty percent of all cultivators, occupying only ten percent of the total territory.

The Nirvana Overflow Heaven was truly a land of ten thousand races. All the human race, demonic beast race, devil race, Blood race, Spirit race, Charm race, Netherworld race, and others had inheritances here.

Furthermore, some of their cultivation lands were forbidden for the human race. In fact, if someone were to act wrongly, it might even cause a war between two races.

In any case, in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, you needed to be wary of the human race and also the other races. It was truly a place of opportunity and danger.

With that in mind, the Nirvana Overflow Heaven had a lot of wild lands from the primal chaos era, which always drew countless adventurers. As a result, countless experts died within them every year. But in the same vein, countless treasures were also brought out of that place each year.

If the Violet Flame Heaven had been ninety percent explored, then the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was a wilderness. People had only explored ten to twenty percent of it.

According to reason, considering how many experts were within the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, the exploration of these lands should be completed very quickly.

However, the relationships between various powers within were rather complex. Many places were occupied by powerful immemorial races. But they themselves didn’t explore parts of their land, and they refused to allow others to do so.

Only a small portion of the masterless lands drew adventurers in, as they took the risk of venturing through them. But due to special restrictions from the laws of the Heavenly Daos, many of those areas could not be entered. People could only explore the outer edges.

Thus, when the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was mentioned, all the Violet Flame Heaven’s experts wanted to go there but also didn’t dare to.

With the Ghost Ship about to land, they were about to arrive in a wild land of legends. Countless dangers and treasures awaited them, filling them with adrenaline.

“Boss, should we switch ships? It would be showing off too much to use a Ghost Ship. If the news from the Violet Flame Heaven reaches this place before us, we’ll be exposed,” said Xia Chen.

Long Chen nodded. “It would be good to be low-key for a while. Theoretically, the news from the Violet Flame Heaven wouldn’t travel here so quickly. I heard that going from the Violet Flame Heaven to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven from the heavenly river normally takes at least half a year. But we only took two months. So, in terms of the information leaking, we shouldn’t have to worry about it for now. However, the Nirvana Overflow Heaven has too many immemorial races, many of whom don’t have a good relationship with the human race. Thus, we'll be low-key first to figure out the situation here. Let’s not instantly become the center of attention.”

After all, the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was not the Violet Flame Heaven. Without any helpers to support them, being more reserved was a must.

“Boss, now that we’re in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, shouldn’t you lead us through the ancient wild lands? Let’s find some treasures!” said Guo Ran.

“When it comes to that, it would be best if we wait until we find Mo Nian. As for me, I’ll give up on that. With my bad luck, I kept brushing against death whenever I went somewhere like that. Don’t come with me, and it’ll be safer for you,” said Long Chen with a bitter smile.

Last time, in the three thousand worlds, if it hadn’t been for the elder of the Heavenly Eye race taking action, they would have all died in the underground tomb.

Thinking back, those terrifying immemorial corpses were probably at the level of Heaven Venerates. They weren’t existences that Long Chen and the others could currently deal with.

That feeling of powerlessness wasn’t something that Long Chen wanted to experience again. After all, he couldn’t rely on luck to live. He had to have the ability to protect himself before he started running around.

Upon mentioning Mo Nian, Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s eyes lit up. They had agreed to go big with Mo Nian once they all arrived in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

Just who was Mo Nian? An absolute master at getting rich quickly! If they followed him, they would definitely make huge gains.

Suddenly, they vaguely heard a rumbling sound far in the distance, startling them.

“What is that? It's the aura of the demon race,” said Xia Chen. He then looked at the source of the sound but didn’t see anything.

As the Ghost Ship crossed the water rapidly, the demonic qi in the air grew stronger and stronger. Just like that, the rumbling noises also grew louder.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s a sea demon tide! The sea demons are attacking the land,” said Long Chen. He had experienced this kind of tides before.

Trillions of sea demons were charging toward the land, causing huge waves to rise out of the water. This water contained the power of the sea demons, so the waves alone were equivalent to a divine art unleashed by a peak expert, capable of destroying the human race’s defenses.

After the waves, there came the sea demons. They would slaughter anyone they saw, painting the land with a bloody and terrifying scene. Unexpectedly, Long Chen and the others ended up encountering such a thing as soon as they arrived in this place.

“Let’s take a look. If the sea demons are attacking a human settlement, we’ll help. If it’s another race, we’ll decide whether or not to help when we see them,” said Long Chen.

The Ghost Ship sped across the water, and they quickly saw land up ahead. The land was covered in sea demons that were charging forward.

At this moment, rays of divine light blew through their ranks, blasting them apart. Yu Qingxuan cried out, “It’s the human race’s magical arts!”

“Then we’re going to help!”

Long Chen nodded. He could see that these attacks contained the fluctuations of the soul, so they should be from the human race.

“Alright!”

Xia Chen cried out excitedly and sent the Ghost Ship flying straight toward the sea demons.
