Chapter 4039 Four Forms Superimposed

BOOM!

A giant cross-shaped slash pierced through the earth. Before the enemies could recover from their shock after seeing Dong Mingyu’s attacks, they were struck by that cross.

Guo Ran’s timing was impeccable. He had stored up energy silently, and when he finally unleashed his stored power, it caught his enemies off guard, leaving them with no chance to defend themselves.

The sheer force of his attack caused the earth to collapse beneath their feet, and a tremendous wave of earth soared into the air, making the entire capital tremble. The experts within the city were all shaken by the immense display of power.

Hundreds of three-flower Earth Venerates were struck by his attack. Caught off guard, the majority didn’t even have time to summon any defenses. At the center of the cross, a hundred experts were slain. There were also many whose physical bodies crumbled, leaving behind only their Yuan Spirits.

“What a despicable sneak attack! You goddamn bastards!” roared one of those Yuan Spirits.

BOOM!

He had just roared when a talisman flew out and detonated his Yuan Spirit.

Consequently, screams filled the air as the talisman detonated, shattering into golden fragments that rained down upon the battlefield. Upon contact with any Yuan Spirit, the fragments elicited agonizing cries, and black smoke emanated from them

“Kill!”

Equipped to his teeth, Guo Ran took the vanguard position, leading the attack on those Earth Venerates.

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors also roared, summoning their Dragon Blood Battle Armor and attacking. When they charged over, dragon cries echoed each other with overflowing killing intent.

Even against three-flower Earth Venerates, the Dragonblood warriors showed no fear. They directly went into their killing formation.

“Great immemorial lightning beast, please enjoy your offerings-!”

Weng Taibei formed hand seals, summoning the immemorial lightning beast. As soon as the beast materialized, it wasted no time and immediately opened its colossal maw, releasing a lightning sword with a thunderous crackle.

However, to everyone’s astonishment, the lightning sword pierced Weng Taibei through the back. His eyes widened like saucers, filled with disbelief as he turned to look back at the source of the attack.

The immemorial lightning beast then transformed into a lightning dragon. With a strike of its claws, Weng Taibei’s body exploded.

That was no immemorial lightning beast but Lei Linger. She had long since absorbed the lightning beast and gained all its power.

After killing Weng Taibei, Lei Linger roared and attacked the other ancient beasts. At this moment, the experts of the various empires had also summoned their immemorial heroic spirits.

In the form of a giant lightning beast, Lei Linger tore through their ranks. As a result, chaos reigned. Both friends and foes stared at the scene before them in dumbfounded silence, not knowing what was going on.

Lei Linger was incredibly powerful and possessed an immemorial aura now. Like an ancient divine beast, she was unstoppable. With a swing of her tail, one of her opponents was directly blasted apart.

On her own, Lei Linger was crushing multiple immemorial beasts. This sudden change left the other side completely flabbergasted.

At this time, Long Chen caught up to Dongfang Zichu and directly unleashed his full power. As the Minghong Saber tore through the heavens, terrifying killing intent locked onto Dongfang Zichu. This was a person that Long Chen hated to the bone. After all, he was the one who had hurt Yu Qingxuan.

In front of Long Chen’s attack, Dongfang Zichu’s indifferent expression instantly became serious. After that, a statue appeared behind him. What no one had expected was that Dongfang Zichu was actually a god cultivator.

Moreover, the scale of his faith energy appeared to be on par with that of Enpuda, and it flooded this space.

“It doesn’t matter how strong you are. You will only be able to watch as your beloved woman dies a miserable death.” Dongfang Zichu slowly raised his sword. Faith energy then poured into his sword, unleashing a brilliant divine light.

“Your mouth really is hateful!” Long Chen slashed the Minghong Saber down.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, Long Chen was sent flying, tumbling through the air.

Startled cries rang out from the experts of the Vermilion Bird Empire. Dongfang Zichu was so powerful that Long Chen was actually at an immense disadvantage.

Yu Qingxuan felt the worst. She wanted to call Long Chen back, but she knew that no one could change what Long Chen had decided.

Even if she did call out to him, she knew that he wouldn’t stop. Instead, it would only disturb his Dao-heart.

Yu Xiaoyun was panicking as even he was deceived. He had always thought that Dongfang Zichu was an immortal cultivator, never suspecting that the latter possessed such awe-inspiring and terrifying faith energy.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Dongfang Zichu was about to sneer at Long Chen when unexpectedly, Long Chen spun through the air and came charging back, his second attack slashing down. Furthermore, this attack contained the divine might of the previous attack.

BOOM!

Long Chen was once more blown back. But this time, Dongfang Zichu was also forced back a few steps before managing to stabilize himself, causing his expression to change.

He saw that Long Chen’s saber had divine might circling it, and vast energy poured into it repeatedly.

This time, Dongfang Zichu didn’t wait and attacked first. He could see that with every blow, Long Chen’s saber was accumulating the power of the previous attack. If he simply allowed Long Chen to continue, the consequences would be terrible.

BOOM!

The clash of sword and saber resounded with a metallic ring as both Long Chen and Dongfang Zichu were blown back. Despite being the aggressor this time, Dongfang Zichu was unable to halt Long Chen's momentum.

Long Chen’s saber crazily flickered, and he stood in the sky, pointing his saber at the dome of the heavens. At the same time, Long Chen’s golden dragon scales were shining, its light flowing into the Minghong Saber.

The next moment, the Minghong Saber rumbled and cracks weaved through the sky. Even before the saber slashed down, an ear-piercing sound already shook people’s souls.

“Suppressing the laws of the Heavenly Daos? How does he possess such power?!” Yu Xiaoyun and the others were stunned. This was a power that only Heaven Venerates should possess.

“Split the Heavens 4!”

Long Chen let out a roar. When the saber finally fell, it was vaguely possible to see a giant figure holding a saber up above the dome of the heavens. The giant then followed Long Chen’s actions, slashing the saber down on Dongfang Zichu.

Seeing such power, Dongfang Zichu was completely terrified and roared.

BOOM!

The millions of statues behind Dongfang Zichu exploded, yet they weren’t destroyed by the impact. No, Dongfang Zichu had detonated them himself.

As they exploded, their faith energy poured into his sword, infusing it with immense power. Dongfang Zichu's ruthlessness was evident—he was willing to sacrifice the very foundation of his strength by destroying his own statues to extract every ounce of power available. It was a costly loss, but he resorted to such extreme measures to counter Long Chen's formidable attack.

The heavenly saber slashed down. In front of countless horrified gazes, it struck Dongfang Zichu’s sword which was filled with his faith energy.
