Chapter 4119: Linglong World

“Long Chen, now we have our own home!”

The dark domain lord had been slain. At least, temporarily, another dark domain lord would not appear here. Now, the only ones left in this world were Yu Qingxuan and Long Chen, so Yu Qingxuan couldn’t help but hug Long Chen excitedly.

With this world in their possession, they were no longer homeless loafers. This world gave them a powerful sense of belonging.

“This world still doesn’t have a name. Why don’t you come up with something?” said Long Chen, smiling at how excited Yu Qingxuan was. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“No, the name that I came up with isn’t good. You do it,” said Yu Qingxuan, blushing slightly. Crafting names wasn’t exactly her forte.

“Me? Alright, then how about the Darkwind World?” said Long Chen after a moment’s thought.

Seeing that Long Chen could only come up with such a name after thinking for so long, Yu Qingxuan couldn’t help laughing. “Are you planning on turning this place into a bandit nest for your plunder?”

“I feel like it’s a good name.” Long Chen smiled.

“Definitely not! If you want my suggestion, well, my life flower is the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid, the Linglong Flower. I can lend you the Linglong name,” laughed Yu Qingxuan.

When Yu Qingxuan mentioned this flower, Long Chen’s heart shook. On the Martial Heaven Continent, he had encountered this Jewel Blood Jade Orchid in the Skywood Divine Palace’s Jade Lake Pageant.

At the time, he had even narrated a deep love story. The Jewel Blood Jade Orchid was a symbol of unwavering love and one of eight precious treasures from ancient times. At that time, Yu Qingxuan had asked Long Chen for the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid, and he had given it to her.

Later on, in the battle that destroyed the Martial Heaven Continent, Yu Qingxuan sacrificed herself to save him. At that moment, the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid appeared once more.

Also, in the High Firmament Academy’s Pill Institute, Long Chen had seen a worn-down statue with the design of the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid on it. Now that Yu Qingxuan brought it up, he instantly had a feeling that this was no coincidence.

“Long Chen, what is it? You don’t like it? I just came up with something random, you can pick something else,” said Yu Qingxuan when she saw Long Chen’s odd expression.

“No, I like this name a lot. The Linglong World. Doesn’t it sound like a world carved of beautiful jade? It makes people feel particularly close to it. Also, this world isn’t that large. The Linglong World… this name fits,” said Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan smiled. Like a small child, she said, “Long Chen, tell me, since we have our own world, just how great would it be if we could live carefree lives here and distance ourselves from all the fighting?”

Yu Qingxuan looked at the world around her. Although it was still a bit desolate, in her eyes, she seemed able to see thriving forests and babbling creeks. She was already thinking of the future.

Long Chen didn’t reply. He simply looked at this world, his arm wrapping around Yu Qingxuan’s waist. This place was an oasis, a wonderland outside the rest of the world.

However, how could this world truly be such a wonderland? No oasis could escape the fact that it was part of the world. If they denied this fact, they would only be deceiving themselves with such a lie.

When the nine heavens descended into chaos once more, nowhere would be safe. When the nest was flipped, would there be any eggs left?

However, Long Chen didn’t want to tell Yu Qingxuan about his thoughts. Even if it was just a dream, he didn’t mind her being lost in it for now. After all, people needed dreams; only then could they live a bit happier. As for whether or not they could actually manifest the dreams, that was a separate matter.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan sat atop the peak of a mountain, leaning against each other comfortably. While talking, their laughter echoed through the air as they gazed ahead with boundless optimism for the future. As time passed, the weariness overcame Yu Qingxuan, and she drifted into a peaceful slumber, her head finding a restful haven on Long Chen's shoulder.

Upon looking at the beauty in his embrace and the sweet smile on her face, she seemed like a child who had fallen asleep from playing. Long Chen was moved by her pure and innocent demeanor, feeling a blend of affection and worry.

“Senior, tell me, why is living a simple life so difficult?”

“Do you really want a simple life?” asked the dragon expert.

“Of course. As long as I can be with my brothers and lovers, living a peaceful life away from all the struggles and killing, I really wouldn’t mind.” Long Chen looked at the sleeping Yu Qingxuan. He was sorry that he couldn’t provide such a world for her.

Yu Qingxuan had abandoned her parents and family, all to follow him into this chaotic world. Long Chen didn’t want her to live such a hard life.

“Perhaps it’s not so simple,” said the dragon expert.

“Oh?”

“Long Chen, I’m going to talk a bit frankly. Don’t get angry.”

“Please, go ahead!”

“Your human race only has one desire when they’re hungry. But after they’re no longer hungry, they have countless desires.”

Long Chen was startled. These seemingly simple words seemed to contain a lot of hidden meanings, drawing Long Chen to ponder about them.

“In truth, it’s not just the human race. Almost all races have desires, and they are never willing to accept just what they have. However, amongst all the races, your human race’s desires are the most intense. After satiating their hunger, they want warm clothes, and then they want a home, and then they want a bigger room, and then they want servants, and then they want to stand above all others, and then they want to live forever. But the most hateful thing is that once your human race really reaches the realm of living forever, they think about how to flashily court death. The nine heavens and ten lands have been reduced to their current state, practically half-crippled. And to tell the truth, there is no mistaking the contributions of your human race in that regard.”

The dragon expert’s tone was rather complex. It contained anger, as well as contempt and a trace of sympathy.

“In truth, I don’t like the human race either. As a member of the human race, I both love and hate the human race, and I also learn to fear and respect them. I am a member of the human race, but I cannot understand the human race. In fact, sometimes I can’t even understand myself,” said Long Chen, sighing.

“But you always have respect and gratitude in your heart. That is your firm belief. That is why I helped you. I had actually long since lost hope for the human race, but I found that hope in you. Thus, I have placed all my bets on you. If you want absolute freedom, then don’t slack off. Continue onward until you reach the peak of this world. See through the riddles, and rebuild this world’s laws. If you succeed, you will have everything you want. Now is not the time for you to be sighing. If you get lazy now, all your dreams will remain dreams.”

Long Chen nodded. “Don’t worry, I’m not someone who gives up so easily. My fate will only be controlled by me.”

With the dragon expert’s encouragement, Long Chen felt his confidence swelling. If the dragon expert trusted him, why wouldn’t he trust himself?

“Good. Then you can start risking your life.”

“What?” asked a startled Long Chen.

“Have you forgotten? Your foundation isn’t the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. It’s the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. It’s time for you to try condensing your improved Seven Star Battle Armor.”

“The true Seven Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen’s blood instantly ignited with excitement upon thinking of his real strongest trump card. He had actually forgotten about it.
