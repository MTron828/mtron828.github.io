Chapter 3648 Sending Coffins

The Heavenly Talisman Star-Field’s Hidden Dragon Prefecture was a sea domain, and millions of islands were scattered about like stars in the sky there. The water was calm, with dense immortal qi and mist that covered the sea in a mysterious haze.

The smaller islands were around a hundred miles long, while the bigger ones were millions and millions of miles wide. They were almost the same size as the Heavenly Swell Domain.

This sea domain was called the Hidden Dragon Prefecture. The legend was that in the desolate era, it was a dragon pool. In other words, a place where dragons roamed. There was once a dragon nest beneath the islands, and in the desolate era, the dragon race occupied this territory.

Later on, the dragon race disappeared and the human race became the master of this region. The human race and the dragon race were comparatively closer compared to the devil race, so the human race easily adapted to this place.

In the Hidden Dragon Prefecture, they would carry out a major ceremony every year, offering sacrifices to the dragon race’s heroic spirits for their blessing. It was said that Hidden Dragon Prefecture was protected by the dragon race’s ancestral soul. As long as this ceremony didn’t cease, the ancestral soul would not fade away. It could continue to protect the human race generation after generation.

No one had seen the dragon soul before, but one thing was a fact. Hidden Dragon Prefecture had never been attacked by any devil beasts or sea demons. It was unknown if it was due to the dragon soul or because this was the ancestral land of the dragon race, causing some lingering dragon might to drive them away. In any case, this was a comparatively peaceful land.

It was precisely due to this that Hidden Dragon Prefecture’s biggest island was even larger than an average domain. Countless cultivators gathered here.

Hidden Dragon Prefecture had one island in particular that was called Hidden Dragon Island. In terms of surface area, it could only rank number three. But it was the island with the most flourishing populace. This was where the spiritual qi of the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field was densest.

The island was covered in cities and sects and had too many cultivators to count. The Spirit Rune Pavilion was located in the northwest region of Hidden Dragon Island.

At this moment, countless people were coming and going through the gates of the Spirit Rune Pavilion. It was a day of celebration.

Today was the formal award ceremony for Gongsun Xuan becoming a Heavenly Talisman Master. This was a major affair for the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field.

According to the rules, a month after announcing it to the world, a good day would be chosen to carry out the award ceremony.

That was because a Heavenly Talisman Master was capable of solving an ancient talisman and creating their own talisman. That was a major progression for the entire world of talismans and runes. A Heavenly Talisman Master was both a symbol of status and power, as well as a kind of responsibility.

The other matter was that Gongsun Xuan’s granddaughter, Gongsun Ziyi, was marrying the Bloodkill Hall’s number one heavenly genius, Ji Wuying.

That news was very unexpected. Just what was going on? Just as she was going to marry Xia Chen, she suddenly chose to marry someone else?

Even if Xia Chen had betrayed the Spirit Rune Pavilion and broken things off with her, could she walk out of that shadow so quickly? Xia Chen hadn’t even been found yet, so just what were they doing?

While people didn’t understand, they pretended as if there was nothing strange about it and came to congratulate them.

When it came to this matter, understanding didn’t matter. Their only goal was to form a good relationship with the Spirit Rune Pavilion. Thus, they could simply act as if they had heard nothing about this.

However, there was this one rumor. Since they were unable to capture Xia Chen, perhaps Gongsun Xuan was using Gongsun Ziyi’s marriage as an attempt to lure him out.

That was a loathsome method, filled with a despicable flavor. But the main thing was, would Xia Chen really fall for such a thing?

Anyone with a brain wouldn’t fall for such a thing. They had obviously set up a trap just for him.

However, lately, people had been hearing another name. It was the High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean, the one who had repeatedly plundered the Soaring Dragon Company, the one who had slain countless lifeforms in the Chaotic Star Sea, and the one who had killed Yan Xu’s son. He was the vicious man known as Long Chen.

Although they didn’t know much about Long Chen, they had all heard of these matters. The rumors said that he was a crazy man who dared to do anything.

Xia Chen might be able to endure, but it was different now that Long Chen had arrived. So many people had come to congratulate the Spirit Rune Pavilion. But to be honest, they also wanted to see if this person known as Long Chen would dare to show up.

“Congratulations, congratulations!”

At the front of the palace was a group of elders. The leaders were the five Heavenly Talisman Masters of this star-field.

“Haha, it’s all thanks to standing on the shoulders of seniors. We are all making small improvements compared to the blessings that our ancestors gave us. Of course, the pointers from you five were also part of it! Come, come in!”

A tall and rather pudgy elder smiled and courteously invited them in. This was the pavilion master, Gongsun Xuan. His eyes were small, making it seem like his eyes were squeezed shut all the time, as if he was always smiling.

However, his smile was rather fake, just for the public to see. As he greeted his guests, he also eyed the surroundings.

Music began to play at this time. After that, a woman with a phoenix crown and red cape walked in with a black-robed man. He was the Bloodkill Hall’s number one genius, Ji Wuying.

He currently had a light smile and gazed in a certain direction. A sinister light also appeared in his eyes.

The void he was looking at rumbled, and a ray of light shot over from the distance. Because of the commotion, everyone was startled and hastily looked over.

“Xia Chen… he really came.”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

They saw three figures. The people didn’t recognize the other two, but they instantly recognized Xia Chen.

“Dear fiancée, for your marriage, I don’t bring much. But I hope you won’t mind this little gift!” Xia Chen was glaring at the dressed-up Gongsun Ziyi. Flames almost burst out of his eyes.

He then waved his hand, causing three coffins to fall in front of the palace. Everyone was shocked. To send coffins during a wedding, it seemed that there would be no end until death.

Gongsun Ziyi slowly raised her veil, revealing a beautiful face. But despite being beautiful, her slightly high nose and thin lips did not give off a friendly feeling.

Looking at her face, Long Chen only saw a woman who would use any means necessary for her goals, a woman who was so selfish that she could only ever love herself.

Long Chen couldn’t help sighing inside. Xia Chen, this fool, was completely immersed in runes, talismans, and formations. He had astounding talent in this regard, and yet his eyes couldn’t see people clearly. He was actually tricked by such a woman.

The three of them had just arrived when the grand formation was activated. Now, the entire Spirit Rune Pavilion was covered in a barrier, and all the guests were locked inside.

“Xia Chen, I really admire you. How meticulous! There are three of you, and you brought three coffins. Not too few and not too many! Are you hoping that I will leave you an intact corpse?” sneered Gongsun Ziyi. That sneer didn’t contain the slightest emotion.

“No, these three coffins are for your family.” Guo Ran shouted and his voice suddenly changed, becoming a thunderous roar. “Anyone who doesn’t want to die should back up! Today, us three brothers are starting a slaughter!”
