Chapter 4378 Undying Body

The red-haired monster had been about to pull its head out of the barrier when the combined force of lightning and flames ruthlessly smashed into it, targeting its head.

BOOM!

No one knew whether the red-haired monster's long seclusion had dulled its reactions or it simply underestimated Long Chen’s ability to counterattack. Regardless, Long Chen’s attack solidly slammed into the monster’s head.

In a loud explosion, the monster’s face was reduced to a pulp. Its heaven-shaking roar reverberated through the air.

Long Chen’s lightning flame attack was incredibly terrifying. If unleashed upon a group of Eternal experts, the number of casualties would be crazy.

However, this red-haired monster only suffered a smashed face. While it wasn’t fatal, this significant injury left it dazed.

BOOM!

Long Chen took that chance to strike the barrier with his fist. After shattering it, he instantly regained his freedom.

“Die!” The red-haired monster roared, its face looking like a fish crushed by a brick, totally wince-inducing. As it slammed its hands in front of its chest, a radiant glow enveloped it. Feeling instant goosebumps, Long Chen found himself locked down by some kind of energy.

The overwhelming devil qi in the sky suddenly retracted back into the monster. Following that, the fabric around its chest exploded, revealing a bony framework and a protrusion on its chest that looked like a horn. That horn lit up and pointed at Long Chen.

“Guo Ran!” Long Chen shouted. Having been prepared, Guo Ran directly appeared in front of Long Chen, crossing his sabers in front of him. After that, all the Dragonblood warriors summoned their manifestations.

When Long Chen activated his Dragon King Battle Armor, a majestic dragon cry rang out. He pressed his hands on Guo Ran’s back, pouring the power of his dragon blood into Guo Ran without the slightest restraint.

“Yama Heaven Piercer!” With a resounding devilish roar, a ray of ominous light pierced through the world and toward Long Chen.

As this attack unfolded, an eerie silence engulfed heaven and earth. All sound dissipated, replaced by a pungent smell of death that assaulted people's senses.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!” Guo Ran also roared. His battle armor had absorbed the power of over five thousand Dragonblood warriors and combined it into one attack.

BOOM!

The moment the two attacks collided, pure darkness enveloped the world, leaving only a speck of light within the chaotic vortex. However, all of a sudden, that faint light intensified until it radiated the entire world.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The earth was torn asunder, and the void itself was cleaved in two. Long Chen and his companions quivered as an irresistible power swept through them. Long Chen could even hear his bones creaking.

The impact sent Guo Ran and the others tumbling back like tumbleweeds. In the face of this shockwave, Xia Chen, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yu Qingxuan, and Bai Shishi's defenses were as fragile as paper.

As they were sent flying, they saw a figure standing there like a boulder, steadfastly enduring that terrifying shockwave.

Behind Long Chen, a pair of enormous wings unfurled. These were not his Kunpeng wings; one was a flame wing, and the other, a lightning wing.

They were Huo Linger and Lei Linger. Only by combining all their efforts could Long Chen manage to remain stable and endure the overwhelming shockwave.

Long Chen couldn’t afford to retreat, as he was blocking the majority of the pressure so that the Dragonblood warriors could retreat safely.

The red-haired monster’s attack was absolutely terrifying, reaching levels of terror beyond their wildest imagination. However, Long Chen and the Dragonblood warriors’ combined attack was also incredibly powerful, resulting in a deadlock where both forces were evenly matched.

The red-haired monster was also knocked back by the shockwave, spewing forth a mouthful of blood. Their collective might had inflicted it with some real injury. Before it could recover from its shock, a bronze cauldron smashed through the air, striking its head.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, its head was pulverized into pulp by the bronze cauldron. The experts from the humanless world were so terrified by this gruesome sight that their souls nearly departed from their bodies.

Long Chen was holding the bronze cauldron, his face pale as paper. His lightning and flame wings were gone, as this attack had used up all of Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s power. However, he managed to endure the shockwave and break apart the red-haired monster’s head.

However, after succeeding, Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit happy. Instead, his expression became grim, and he swiftly turned to run.

“RUN!”

Guo Ran and the others were just about to cheer, thinking that they had won when they heard Long Chen’s shout. After the briefest pause from shock, they hastily fled.

“Damn brats of the human race, where do you think you’re going?!”

That red-haired monster’s head was gone, but it remained alive; its aura didn’t even fluctuate. Its voice emanated from its body, accompanied by an overwhelming surge of killing intent. Despite being headless, it relentlessly pursued Long Chen and the others.

“Is he a monster?!” Guo Ran shouted in terror. The fact that losing its head had no impact on its combat prowess left them astonished. What kind of monstrosity was it?

Long Chen’s bronze cauldron suddenly lit up, and a ray of divine light shot toward the red-haired monster.

Startled, the red-haired monster hurriedly evaded the incoming attack.

BANG!

However, that divine light only caused some dust to rise when it struck the ground. It had no power at all.

Of course it had no power. Long Chen had no way to actually use the Earth Cauldron. The only thing he could do was smash people with it.

This attack was simply a bluff and contained no power at all. However, after having its head blown apart by the Earth Cauldron, that monster was so scared of it. As a result, it fell for the bluff.

Long Chen and his companions then took the chance to run. The red-haired monster, realizing it had been tricked, grew incensed. It seemed to teleport, catching up to them in just a few breaths.

Buzz.

Long Chen raised the Earth Cauldron once again, unleashing a ray of golden light at the red-haired monster. It fell for it again and dodged.

“Idiot, what are you dodging for? How useless!” Long Chen cursed the red-haired monster as he fled.

The red-haired monster was incensed, but it couldn’t help feeling suspicious. It thought that Long Chen really did have an even stronger attack up his sleeve.

Perhaps the previous two times were a test. If it didn’t dodge, that terrifying attack would really strike him. Otherwise, why else would Long Chen act so exasperated?

After that, the red-haired monster ended up getting close and being scared away by Long Chen multiple times. Every time it dodged, Long Chen would curse it.

However, after falling for it several times, the red-haired monster grew suspicious once more. Was it really just a bluff?

This time, when Long Chen raised the Earth Cauldron and unleashed a ray of divine light, the red-haired monster didn’t dodge. It directly charged into it.

As expected, divine light was still fake. It snorted, “Crafty human, it’s time for you to die!”

An enormous claw suddenly crashed down toward them from the heavens.

However, out of nowhere, a streak of Sword Qi pierced the monster’s hand, cutting off its attack. Yue Zifeng had used this opportunity to attack.

“Zifeng, good job!” Long Chen shouted excitedly. Yue Zifeng’s attack was timed perfectly.

BOOM!

In that critical moment, a gate materialized before them, and they swiftly charged through it, entering Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

“Damn things, do you think you can get away?!”

The red-haired monster pursued them relentlessly, launching a deadly fist toward them. It seemed that it would not stop until they were dead.

BOOM!

In the midst of its attack, a black dragon claw pierced through the dome of the heavens, intercepting its fist mid-air.

“The Nirvana Overflow Heaven is not a place where you can run rampant.”

The palace master’s domineering voice resounded throughout the sky.
