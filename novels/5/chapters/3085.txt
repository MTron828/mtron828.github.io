Chapter 3074 Triggering Everyone’s Rage

Everyone was silent as they stared at the elder. The Dao discussion stage had its own will? They had never heard of such a thing.

In their memory, the Dao discussion stage was nothing more than a tool used for this exam. It never communicated with others like this, so it was absolutely shocking. Just how was Long Chen able to summon its spirit?

Long Chen had found it a bit curious that this elder was so shocked when he started to translate the tablet. He even seemed anxious, but that wasn’t enough for Long Chen to suspect him.

The real problem came when he translated the tablet’s characters so shockingly smoothly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When Long Chen was kicked down, he could sense the Dao discussion stage’s anger. He hadn’t known that the Dao discussion stage didn’t interact with the outside world. It was only when he saw everyone’s shocked gazes that he realized this.

That elder was sweating and panicking. But putting on a calm expression, he said, “The flame domain’s evil dragons’ sharp claws and teeth tore through the void.”

“Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed. “As expected, you can’t read second generation immortal characters. You probably can’t even read third generation characters. This line that you translated should be translated as the evil dragons’ eyes were like a curse from hell. Only when they’re linked to the next line would they be translated differently as you said. You don’t know how to translate these characters, and you simply memorized the translated text that someone gave you beforehand. If you had translated it without such an act, I wouldn’t have noticed. But you used your finger to point at the characters you were translating. Although I don’t recognize all these characters, I recognize third generation characters. The way that you were pointing and the speed that you were translating were completely off.”

An uproar exploded, whether it was from the experts watching or the other instructors on the stage. They stared in fury at the elder. However, they were scared by his status and didn’t say anything yet.

“Absolute nonsense! I… I just misread it and translated both lines together!” said the elder.

“Idiot, you really are guilty. Why don’t you look at the line that the Dao discussion stage senior has asked you to translate? Was it that line I mentioned?” said Long Chen.

People turned and looked at the tablet again. They found that it wasn’t the third section’s fifth line that was illuminated. Second generation Jiuli immortal characters were so complex that they wouldn’t have even noticed that they were different.

However, when they compared the lines closely, they quickly found that these weren’t the same line at all.

“Fool, you can’t translate. Based on what you memorized, you simply picked out the part most likely to be the third section, fifth line. You wanted to test your luck and see if you could guess right. But you didn’t even look at the immortal characters right in front of you. Well, even if you looked, it would have been useless. Idiot, do you confess now?” sneered Long Chen.

Without waiting for a response, Long Chen announced, “Everyone, do you see? This so-called Nine Prefecture Convention is a huge joke. Some people are choosing their own athletes and referees, treating all the heroes of the nine prefectures as dancing monkeys. They dare to openly cheat in the Dao discussion convention. They are giving your money to the people that they’ve picked. Don’t you think the Nine Prefecture Convention should give everyone an explanation?”

Countless people were enraged. Although they disliked Long Chen, this flagrant cheating was far more insulting.

The elder in charge of the Dao discussion convention hastily said, “My Silver Moon City will definitely give everyone an explanation for this matter! Everyone, please…”

However, before he finished speaking, the stage quivered. That cheating elder on the divine pillar suddenly exploded.

“This is…”

Everyone was stunned. The elder had actually been killed by the Dao discussion stage.

“The Dao discussion senior may have executed the cheater, but that doesn’t mean that this matter is over. I heard that the Martial Dao convention is just as bad. Although it looks as if you’re drawing lots, they’ve actually rigged it behind the scenes, making sure to block everyone who can threaten them outside of the top hundred, so that some people can’t obtain any rewards. They keep those rewards for their own people. A group of pigs are sharing the spoils of the hard workers of the nine prefectures. Hmph, the Nine Prefecture Convention is truly rotten to the core. Friends, let’s all just leave. Don’t let others treat you as fools,” said Long Chen. He actually stood up on the pillar.

“The Nine Prefecture Convention must give us a satisfactory explanation!”

“Silver Moon City, you’ve betrayed our trust! This is completely intolerable!”

“Boss Long San, I’ll support you this time. What kind of garbage convention is this? Treating us like stepping stones? Fuck off!”

Long Chen’s words caused an uproar. After all, ninety-nine percent of the people present were victims. Before this, they had simply thought that their power was inferior, and since they had gambled, they had to be willing to pay up.

Only a very small number of powers managed to consistently get the rewards. As for the dirty tricks of the Nine Prefecture Convention, if the tricks were beneficial to them, they naturally wouldn’t say anything.

Also, some powers clearly knew that there were dark secrets, but they didn’t dare to say it and could only thicken their face and come.

However, even then, it was only the higher-ups that were aware of this, not the disciples. They had come here with hopes of gaining fame and obtaining a reward that they didn’t even dare to dream of obtaining. But now they found that it was all a con. The higher-ups were treating them like monkeys. How could this be acceptable? The crowd was even more enraged than when they had been cursing Long Chen.

“Calm down! Calm down! We will definitely give everyone a satisfactory response! I guarantee it!”

The elder overseeing things stood in the sky and shouted, also panicking. He had never seen such a thing. This was too big of a ruckus.

“An explanation? What kind of explanation? Killing a few meaningless scapegoats to tell everyone that the chief offenders are now gone? Appeasing everyone with some meaningless compensation? After obtaining everyone’s trust, you’ll discuss how to cheat next time without getting caught?” sneered Long Chen.

The elder’s expression sank. He glared at Long Chen who then said, “What, are you trying to scare me? Boss Long San isn’t afraid of heaven or earth, let alone you. I’m not ashamed to say that I stopped playing such games years ago. You might be able to cut off my head, but you can’t make me lower my head.”

Seeing Long Chen going directly against the overseeing elder, quite a few people actually cheered for him. They were standing on his side. At this time, they no longer felt him to be so offensively arrogant.

“Then what do you want?” demanded the elder coldly, a trace of killing intent leaking out of his eyes.
