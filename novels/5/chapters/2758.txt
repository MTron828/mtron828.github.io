Chapter 2747 Elder Long’s Death

Long Chen killed the Deputy Elder effortlessly, and no one managed to react before the latter was already dead.

Everyone’s expression changed. Only now did they realize that this place was now full of thunderforce. They were already within Lei Linger’s lightning domain.

That attack had come from Lei Linger. She didn’t even need to move in order to kill the Deputy Elder.

Within her domain, amongst the mid Heaven Merging realm and below, only a few people were capable of escaping her killing blow.

“Senior, please accept my kowtow.”

Considering that Elder Long was the one who had saved him, Long Chen was filled with gratitude. However, before he could pay his respects, Elder Long stopped him.

“Child, from the moment I laid eyes on you, I recognized who you were. You are just like your father. You’re both incredibly stubborn, refusing to lower your heads to anyone. I knew that you would come for revenge. I waited a long time, and now I’m finally free. I can rejoin my family.” Elder Long patted Long Chen’s shoulder.

“Senior, you…”

Elder Long smiled at Long Chen and then pointed to the divine families’ experts. “My family in the generation above is already dead. My seven sons died and my wife passed away in grief. As for me, the only reason I waited to this day is to personally witness Long Zhantian’s son return for his vengeance.”

“Long Qiyao, you are a traitor!” roared one of the Saints of the divine families, enraged.

“A traitor? I suppose.” Elder Long indifferently nodded. “Back then, Long Zhantian saved my life on the battlefield. The reason I saved Long Chen was partially to return Long Zhantian’s favor. Other than that, Long Zhantian was an unrivaled hero. If his son died to such petty little people, it would be far too unjust. Perhaps you are unaware of it, but while Long Zhantian was a coarse and rough person, causing many people to think of him as nothing more than a brute, he was far more intelligent and scrupulous than people gave him credit for. He naturally entered a rage when he learned that his son had been harmed, but once you suppressed him, he grew cool-headed. He realized that his son had probably yet to be killed. However, he knew that afterward, you would definitely treat his son as a hostage to be used against him, so he sent me a spiritual message asking me to save his son. I did it. Now, I have nothing else tying me to this world. I have accomplished my promise to Long Zhantian, so I can leave now.”

“Senior, why must you do this?” asked Long Chen, his voice quivering slightly.

“Child, there are some things that you do not, and cannot, understand. When a person loses all their belief, every living day is a pain. I was originally planning on personally watching your vengeance, but in the end, I am still a member of the divine families. Although I detest this family full of darkness, cold-bloodedness, hypocrisy, and heartlessness, I’m unable to watch this with any joy. However, even if I don’t watch… I… know… the result.” Just like that, Elder Long closed his eyes, his aura dissipating.

Shocked, Long Chen hastily grabbed him, only to find that the fire of his soul had extinguished. This was not a suicide. He simply naturally died. When the last thing sustaining him disappeared, his spirit crumbled.

Seeing his old face, thinking of the care he had shown him during this time, thinking of how he had saved him and lost everything in return, Long Chen couldn’t stop tears from flowing out of his eyes.

If Elder Long had been on the battlefield back then, it meant that he and his father were enemies at that time. But even while being enemies, when Long Zhantian realized the crisis, he reached out to Elder Long, and Elder Long agreed without hesitation. Moreover, even after paying such a painful price, he had never regretted it.

“Why…!”

Long Chen suddenly let out a roar, causing the heavens to change color. This roar emitted endless resentment.

It contained the power of his stars, the resentment in his heart. Hence, every expert present was shaken. Those with weaker cultivation bases even coughed up blood.

Why was it that good people always had terrible fates? Why was it that bad people always got away lightly? Elder Long had lived such a bitter life all these years, but every bad person he saw before him was living happily. This world was too unfair.

Long Chen hugged Elder Long. He didn’t feel such deep emotions for him necessarily, as they didn’t have a close bloodline connection. But Elder Long had essentially sacrificed his entire family for a promise, not regretting it even in death. This was a real man.

After that, Long Chen carefully put Elder Long’s body away and wiped away his tears. He looked around and noticed that more people had come.

Feng Fei, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen had arrived. They had also been in seclusion.

Every single one of them had powerful auras, having advanced to the Saint realm. Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen both glared at him sharply. They clearly thought that this was their best chance to kill Long Chen.

Only Feng Fei looked at him with a complicated expression. She still had a sense of right and wrong. In this aspect, she was a hundred times stronger than Zhao Ritian, Ye Liangchen, Jiang Wuchen, and Long Aotian.

Regretfully, her sense of right and wrong didn’t matter. Long Chen was now the mortal enemy of the divine families. Furthermore, the divine families’ position was now fully clear. She also understood their mission of seizing the heavens.

The current her no longer had the luxury of standing on the side of the right. Unlike during the tribulation, she had to stand on the side of the divine families. There was no right or wrong, only what was beneficial to the divine families. Anything else was a betrayal.

“Long Chen, what do you want?!” demanded Long Aotian.

At this moment, Long Chen was ignoring them all. He turned to the Lord Saint, who was still pierced by Lei Linger’s lightning spear, not daring to move.

Any strange movement and Lei Linger would instantly kill him. Hence, when Long Chen stood in front of him, he finally felt fear. He could sense Long Chen’s determination to kill him.

“Long Chen, don’t kill me. I can tell you how to find your parents!” said the Lord Saint.

Their leader, the grand Lord Saint, was actually begging an enemy. The divine families’ experts’ expressions changed. This was a huge humiliation to them.

Long Chen sneered, “You’re finally afraid of dying? If you’re afraid, why did you court death? Someone who courts death always thinks that they won’t die. That’s why you acted so fearlessly. Do you know why I came here? Today, I’ll announce the judgment to your trial here, the place where you committed your sins, where my father and mother’s blood flowed.”

In front of countless experts, a lightning sword appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and he slashed it at the Lord Saint’s neck.
