Chapter 4276: Terrifying Palace Master

The palace master was surrounded by eight half-step Eternals. Among them, an elder from the Blood race had the grim misfortune of having one of their arms brutally torn from their body.

However, just as the palace master ripped off that Blood expert’s arm, a sword silently appeared, stabbing through his back and out his chest.

“Shadow Assassin!”

Long Chen seethed with fury. The attacker was a half-step Eternal Shadow Assassin, a foe so formidable that not even the palace master could avoid their attack. Long Chen felt like his heart was no longer beating, the sudden turn of events leaving him in shock.

The palace master then looked down at the sword piercing his body and slowly turned back. A ferocious smile spread across his face.

The Shadow Assassin was a seemingly wizened elder. When he saw the palace master smiling at him, his hair stood on end, and he felt like a devil had set its sights on him.

He tried to pull but was shocked to find that his sword seemed to have taken root inside the palace master’s body. He couldn’t pull it out.

The palace master suddenly let out a furious roar, and that sword exploded out of his body along with fresh blood.

The Shadow Assassin met its demise as it was skewered by its own sword, resulting in a detonation. While the Shadow race held formidable offensive abilities, their defenses were notably weak. His Yuan Spirit then transformed into a streak of light, flying away.

However, he had barely gotten anywhere when his Yuan Spirit was smacked apart by a palm from the palace master. Just like that, another half-step Eternal was slain.

The palace master had killed two half-step Eternals already, terrifying countless people. As for the wound on his chest, it was healing rapidly, and in just a moment, it was like nothing had even happened. A wound caused by an Eternal divine weapon held by a half-step Eternal was gone just like that.

All the experts attacking the palace master were horrified. They had never seen such a terrifying existence before.

“The sweeping elder ordered me not to pick fights with others. However, if someone is to attack me, I’m allowed to fight back without restraint. Hehe, after so many years, my chance has finally come!”

The palace master looked quite frightening. His smile was terrifying, and his eyes were filled with a bloodthirsty light.

He was like a devil god that had been sealed for countless years and was finally free from that seal. It was as if he wanted to slaughter the entire world.

The palace master shot into motion, sending a claw that tore through the void and enveloped all seven half-step Eternals in the air.

BOOM!

A ripple of death then spread in every direction, gradually weakening as it expanded. However, even in its weakest state, it could still transform into a terrifying astral wind that sent countless experts flying.

The earth was constantly caving in. As most experts were unable to fly, they could only sink into the abyss after being overtaken by the collapsing ground.

“Run! Run faster!”

Guo Ran shouted in fright. Looking back and seeing countless experts falling into that collapsed space, he felt a chill.

Battles between half-step Eternals were absolutely terrifying; they were like ants in comparison. One slip and they would be crushed to death.

Long Chen finally understood why Bai Zhantang had said that they couldn’t rely on the palace master. This fellow was battle-crazed, so once he started fighting, he didn’t care about other people’s life and death.

Even one against seven, the palace master was forcing his enemies back. There was no need to worry about him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, there was a loud explosion and the world descended into darkness. The direction of that sound was the sunken Sage King Prefecture.

Within the darkness, a speck of light rose like a shooting star. It hung in the air for a breath’s time, and runes began to rapidly flash around it.

“That’s the karmic luck bead!”

A startled cry rang out. This light had the exact same appearance as the karmic luck bead on the martial stage.

“This is the true karmic luck bead! Now that the Sage King Convention is over, a new Sage King is about to be crowned!”

This phenomenon was recorded in history. After the Sage King Convention ended, the winner would be bestowed with the karmic luck bead, becoming the Sage King.

Suddenly, the karmic luck bead shot toward Long Chen’s side. Seeing this, countless experts roared in fury and tried to stop it.

However, the laws of heaven and earth were in chaos, so they couldn’t jump that high. They could only watch as the karmic luck bead flew over all of their heads.

Suddenly, a half-step Eternal shot out to reach the karmic luck bead. He was an expert of the human race, but he was wearing a mask and concealing his aura.

And the moment his hand touched it, his arm exploded. The karmic luck bead could not be stopped.

Upon seeing this scene, countless experts’ hearts shattered. If not even a half-step Eternal expert could stop the karmic luck bead, then there was no stopping it from reaching the true Sage King.

The karmic luck bead then came to a stop above Long Chen’s head and slowly fell into his body.

Long Chen felt his body quiver as a strange energy flowed through his body. At that moment, Long Chen’s divine sense stretched out limitlessly, instantly encapsulating the nine heavens and ten lands and all worlds within them.

However, this state only lasted for a fleeting moment, leaving Long Chen with the sensation of being in a dream. Oddly, this dream carried an eerie sense of déjà vu, as if he had encountered something similar in the past, yet he was equally certain that he had never come remotely close to such an experience before.

Following that, countless dense runes appeared on top of Long Chen’s body, radiating a brilliant glow. They bore a striking resemblance to the runes that the Dragonblood Legion and the others had obtained back when the karmic luck bead first exploded.

“Quick, kill Long Chen! As long as he is slain, we can get the Sage King runes!” shouted Ye Wuchen.

Following that shout, people went insane as they charged at Long Chen. Although the Sage King martial stage was already gone, the laws of the martial stage persisted. Otherwise, the Sage King karmic luck bead wouldn’t be sent to Long Chen.

In other words, Long Chen had obtained the recognition of the martial stage, and that was why it chose him to be the Sage King.

Countless heavenly geniuses went crazy because of it. They were envious, but most importantly, if they could kill Long Chen, the karmic luck bead should choose a new master. Then they would have a chance as well. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

BOOM!

Suddenly, the space in front of Long Chen exploded, and a masked elder with an Eternal spear attacked Long Chen.

“Bastard, you don’t dare to reveal your face? Why don’t you show yourself if you have the guts!?” cursed Mo Nian when he found that another half-step Eternal expert was present.

This person seemed to be from the human race. Was he assisting enemy races to kill the human race’s Sage King? It enraged countless people.

Mo Nian shot in front of Long Chen, intercepting the elder’s attack with his bow. As a result, his bow bent, and Mo Nian felt an immense force pour into him, threatening to explode inside of him.

Long Chen suddenly pressed a hand on Mo Nian’s back and sucked away half of that explosive power, causing the two of them to cough up blood at the same time. Both of them had joined forces to receive the attack of a half-step Eternal, but they were injured by it.

Showing no mercy, the masked elder sent another slash of his blade over.

Suddenly, a ray of Sword Qi shot toward the masked elder, causing him to be startled and hastily switch to defend.

BANG!

He managed to shatter the Sword Qi, but a streak of it grazed his face, leaving a bloody line from his forehead to his mouth. His mask then slipped off, revealing a panicked face.
