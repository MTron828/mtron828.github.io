Chapter 3902 Unbeatable Shi Yang

BOOM!

The earth quivered as the sharp claws tore through its surface, leaving behind a trail of destruction. In an instant, giant cracks spread like a spider's web, fracturing the once undisturbed land.

At this moment, a figure wrapped in black qi appeared before their eyes. With wings resembling those of a bat and the devil qi that overflowed out of them, his existence shook the ten thousand Daos.

“Shi Yang!”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen's hearts quivered with a mixture of fear and disbelief as they looked at Shi Yang. The body of an immemorial winged devil that he possessed now had a devil qi swirling around it. It seemed that he had taken full control of this corpse.

Shi Yang’s claws tore through the void as quickly as lightning, not giving Bai Xiaole or the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox any chance to react.

However, this attack still missed. Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox vanished right before the attack landed.

“Golden horn winged devil race? Who do you think you are? In front of my Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox race, you can only prostate beneath our feet.” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox appeared in the distance with Bai Xiaole, glaring at Shi Yang furiously.

However, Shi Yang ignored it and just looked at Long Chen. A sinister smile appeared on his face.

“Long Chen, your death is at hand!”

Shi Yang’s wings shook, causing a surge of black qi to come out from his body. He then shot toward the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses like a black meteor.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

As Guo Ran cried out, all the Dragonblood warriors ignited their power in perfect synchrony, their energy surging. With the support of their collective power, Guo Ran crossed his sabers and unleashed a dual saber strike at Shi Yang’s head.

BOOM!

The strike blew Shi Yang’s body back, leaving an immense cross-shaped hole in the void. Within that ruined space, fragments of spacetime swirled and flew about. Everyone who saw this scene was flabbergasted by the world-destroying power of all the Dragonblood warriors.

“Boss Guo Ran is mighty!”

Seeing Guo Ran manage to blow away the indomitable Shi Yang, Bai Xiaole cheered.

However, his cheers quickly turned silent. Within that ruined space, black qi gushed out once again, and Shi Yang flew out of it.

Everyone could see black blood leaking out of the giant cross-shaped mark on his chest. That attack had struck him directly.

However, that was all. This mark was no more than an inch deep.

“What a terrifying physical body!”

Startled cries rang out. Against all expectations, Shi Yang had used his physical body to withstand this devastating strike, emerging with only the slightest trace of injuries. His physical body must be countless times stronger than World Domain divine items.

“Interesting. You can actually damage this body. But so what? The immemorial winged devil’s body is unimaginably powerful. Now that it has been nourished by primal chaos qi, I’m in full control of it. Even if you exhaust yourselves hitting me, you can’t kill me,” Shi Yang laughed sinisterly. He once more shot toward them.

“How arrogant! Then let me experience the power of your so-called immemorial devil corpse.”

As a cold and clear voice rang out, golden light fell from the sky, accompanied by a golden sword that slashed through the air. Bai Shishi had come.

A golden lotus unfurled behind her, enveloping her in its divine radiance. With her special Heavenly Dao Crown, she appeared like a golden war goddess.

Also, the golden sword that she was wielding was precisely the one that Long Chen had daringly stolen from the Ghost Ship.

As this sword’s ancient runes lit up, all the metal energy of the world seemed to merge into it.

BOOM!

In front of this gleaming sword, Shi Yang raised his fierce claws. As the two formidable forces met, a magnificent burst of divine light erupted, resembling the explosion of the sun.

Both Bai Shishi and Shi Yang retreated at the same time, being evenly matched in this exchange.

“Corpse Devil Spirit Awakening! Devil Blood Ignition!”

With a disdainful snort, Shi Yang formed hand seals swiftly, unleashing countless strange runes that manifested across his body. These eerie runes then writhed akin to a swarm of restless maggots, which imbued him with an unprecedented concentration of corpse devil qi.

BOOM!

Shi Yang once more attacked, his claws dancing through the air. Facing these attacks, Bai Shishi swung her sword, and with an explosive sound, she tumbled back. She was actually unable to stop the current Shi Yang.

“Don’t fight him directly! His corpse came from a heavenly tomb! It was a king of the immemorial era, and it might have been an existence above a Divine Venerate in its life. However, although he can control this corpse, the amount of power he can control is definitely limited! We can search for a weak point and an opportunity to counterattack!” shouted Xia Chen. Having been in the heavenly tomb, he was clearer than anyone on just how terrifying this corpse was.

“An opportunity to counterattack? How laughable. This corpse has no weaknesses.” Shi Yang laughed and chased after Bai Shishi.

“Heavenly Rainbow Flying Star!”

Just as Shi Yang lunged toward Bai Shishi, the Pill Fairy gracefully descended from above, enveloped in rainbow flames that danced around her. She was like a rainbow flying through the world.

BOOM!

Upon sensing her, Shi Yang’s wings slammed down around him. Those wings were like a shield, blocking the Pill Fairy’s attack. Hence, when the rainbow flames blasted him, he was merely knocked back several steps.

However, even as Shi Yang retracted his wings, the vibrant rainbow flames persisted, stubbornly burning on. The intense flame energy clung fiercely to his wings, refusing to be extinguished.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Flame really is powerful. But this golden horn winged devil was a master of flame energy. Your flames are unable to harm me.” Shi Yang laughed. Even as his wings burned, he ignored it and shot straight at Long Chen.

“Fuck, I’m really pissed by your arrogance!” Filled with fury, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox let out a roar and suddenly appeared in front of Shi Yang. Its nine majestic tails blazed with an ethereal light, while its razor-sharp claws descended swiftly with unwavering precision.

As their claws collided, a shower of sparks erupted, illuminating the space between them. The forceful impact then reverberated, causing a powerful shockwave that sent the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox flying backward.

“If I wasn’t limited by that brat, do you think you could receive three blows from me?!” Driven back by the forceful blow, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox seethed with increased fury, yet it found itself unable to do a thing.

“Trash. Even if you all come at me together, you won’t be able to stop me from killing Long Chen,” Shi Yang sneered arrogantly.

Provoked by this arrogant declaration, Bai Shishi’s anger flared. She then pointed her sword at the sky, and a ray of Sword Qi soared into the dome of the heavens.

The next moment, the earth split open, and a dazzling golden light erupted from the depths, flowing into her sword.

As this light was absorbed, the ray of Sword Qi grew larger, exuding a sharp aura that stabbed people’s souls.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Heaven Splitting Slash!”

At this moment, Bai Shishi’s eyes were filled with golden light. With a cold shout, her sword slashed down.

The void let out a tearing sound as this sword broke all shackles of heaven and earth. Upon facing such a terrifying attack, Shi Yang’s expression finally changed.
