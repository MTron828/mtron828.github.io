Chapter 3593

The aura of Guo Ran’s attack was identical to the first form of Split the Heavens. Furthermore, that aura was just like Long Chen’s when he used it.

Long Chen was stunned. He had tried to teach Guo Ran the core technique of the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect. In fact, he had tried to teach the others as well.

Long Chen hadn’t hoped for them to learn the ninth form of Split the Heavens but just the principles behind it, that kind of unrivaled will. That was of great importance to an expert. The nine forms of Split the Heavens could be markers for their cultivation.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, the Dragonblood warriors were very close to the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s disciples. They often drank together and exchanged pointers. They had almost no secrets between them. Thus, Guo Ran and the others might not be able to use the nine forms of Split the Heavens, but they had a great understanding of this technique.

What Long Chen hadn’t expected was for Guo Ran to be able to unleash Split the Heavens in the immortal world. With the support of the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, the power of this attack even shocked Long Chen.

When this saber fell, it pierced through heaven and earth, and the barrier was cleanly cut through. This imposing aura that could even slay gods was the essence of Split the Heavens. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wang Zixu was horrified. Even before Guo Ran’s saber fell, that terrifying aura completely locked him down. Heaven and earth froze around him. In that instant, there was nowhere for him to go. If he wanted to live, he could only face it with all his power.

Guo Ran had compressed all of his power into this attack. Clearly, this attack would truly decide victory or defeat, life or death. This was a saber that did not care about anything else, either you die or I die.

“Heaven Howling Wrath, Heavenly God Slash!”

Wang Zixu roared along with the Heaven Howling Battle Armor. After that, countless runes lit up, their light flooding into his saber. A giant illusory saber-image then appeared to face Guo Ran’s saber. It was another heaven-piercing saber that stretched into the clouds.

BOOM!

The two divine weapons slashed at each other in front of countless gazes. As a result, the heaven-shaking explosion from the collision made others feel like a sun had exploded in the middle of the martial stage. The blinding light stabbed their eyes painfully.

Terrifying astral winds then unfurled. Without hesitation, people summoned their battle armors. They had just put them on when they were blasted away by those astral winds.

The spectator stands were as weak as paper in front of these terrifying astral winds and were blown to bits.

Only Long Chen and Xue Yifan remained in their original locations. The others had been blown far into the distance.

When the astral winds weakened and the divine light faded, people saw that the martial stage had been destroyed. It no longer had its original form. The defensive barrier on top of it was gone without a trace.

People then looked at Guo Ran. The runes on his black armor were gone. This attack had exhausted all of its power.

Not too far in front of Guo Ran, in a small crack of the shattered martial stage, Wang Zixu was hacking up blood. His battle armor was gone, and half of his body was destroyed. He was staring in shock. His only remaining hand pushed him backward.

He no longer had any of his former arrogance. His whole body was quivering, and blood continued to gush out of his body.

“He lost! Wang Zixu actually lost!” People couldn’t believe their eyes.

Wang Zixu was the head of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes. He had also inherited his family’s strongest Heaven Howling Battle Armor. His power was unimaginable, but he actually lost to Guo Ran.

“The head of the four heroes lost to the bottom of the four heroes.”

“Furthermore… it was in one move…”

Countless disciples’ voices quivered. Some people who had looked down on Guo Ran before and provoked him now felt terror.

Xie Liuer and Leng Hui were also terrified. Although they were conceited, they knew that their power was truly inferior to Wang Zixu’s.

But the powerful Wang Zixu was defeated in one move by Guo Ran, his battle armor destroyed and his body on the verge of death. They looked at Guo Ran and then at the calm dean. After that, they looked at Long Chen who still had his hands clasped behind his back, his face like a bottomless well. Their hearts thudded. The heavens of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College were about to change.

Upon thinking of how they had constantly opposed and suppressed Guo Ran’s development, cold sweat dripped down their backs.

The sound of metal boots stepping on the martial stage rang out. It was like thunder striking people’s hearts. Guo Ran walked over to Wang Zixu with his saber.

“You… don’t come here… Grandpa… save me!”

Wang Zixu cried out in terror. His voice already contained a sobbing tone as he hastily looked to his family members for aid.

“Stop!”

A figure flew through the air, rushing at Guo Ran. It was a late stage World King in golden armor who came to save Wang Zixu.

Although Guo Ran had defeated Wang Zixu with that attack, his armor’s runes had dimmed. He had clearly used up all his energy and could not stop the attack of a late stage World King.

Furthermore, based on this elder’s speed and manner, it seemed that he was planning on killing Guo Ran. Hence, Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the others cried out in shock. They wanted to go help Guo Ran, but they were too far. They couldn’t make it.

However, that late stage World King had just approached the martial stage when a flame sword slashed down. His body along with his battle armor was cleanly cut in half. The next moment, the ruined battle armor fell to the ground along with a charred corpse.

Just like that, a late stage World King was slain. Only at this time did people look up in the sky to see a beautiful woman with a flame sword in her hand. Flames continued to gush out of her body.

“This is a life-and-death match. Did you take this to be a joke? Of course, if anyone else is tired of living, then come interfere. Let’s see if your neck is tougher, or if Huo Linger’s True Fire Sword is harder,” said Long Chen coldly.

Huo Linger stood there, flames weaving beneath her feet. She was truly like a flame goddess. After absorbing the Yan Xu Flame, Huo Linger with the True Fire Sword was not much weaker than Long Chen.

People stared at Huo Linger in horror. They had never seen a flame spirit before and had no idea who this beautiful young woman with raging flames around her was. However, based on Long Chen’s tone, she was clearly their companion.

People were more shocked than ever. Guo Ran was already terrifying enough, but Guo Ran’s boss was even stronger than him. Not only that, this flame maiden had also appeared, killing the Wang family’s late stage World King without the slightest effort.

“Guo Ran, I’m begging you, let me off. We are from the same sect. Spare my life…” What no one had expected was that since Wang Zixu couldn’t flee and no one was coming to save him, he actually knelt on the ground, kowtowing like a bird pecking for food.

Guo Ran’s armor was retracted, revealing his face. He then looked at Wang Zixu fiercely.

After that, a lone black saber stabbed through Wang Zixu’s chest and out his back.
