Chapter 2785 Heaven-Shaking Sword

Ye Ming was no longer the old Ye Ming. The god had killed his soul and taken complete control of his body.

At this moment, the divine energy fluctuations from Ye Ming caused space to fracture, and the High Priest and the others couldn’t even approach him. They were on two completely different levels.

This god that possessed Ye Ming disliked the interference of his will, his blood, and his soul, so he directly killed Ye Ming. Now his divine energy circulated without anything inhibiting it.

Ye Ming’s expression was icy, and he began walking toward Long Chen step by step. Everyone charged over to stop him, only for a spatial pressure to knock them back.

“How can this be happening? This is completely different from the past dark eras. Even gods have descended to the lower plane to fight!” Ma Ruyun’s expression completely changed. This battle had far surpassed his expectations.

For a single star-field’s core, they were sacrificing so many lifeforms? Was that really worth it? Or did it mean that they had some ulterior motive?

Ye Ming’s gaze swept across Yun Tian, Mo Nian, Gu Yang, and the others. The latter kept trying to charge through, but the pressure of his divine energy did not allow it.

Even the Life God Tree and the mother tree’s energy was unable to approach Ye Ming. His divine energy blocked off everything, so people could only watch.

At this moment, Yun Tian’s barrier began to crack under the pressure of divine energy. Yun Tian’s body also cracked like porcelain.

“No!” Mo Nian and the others howled furiously. Yun Tian was linked to this barrier, so if it broke, Yun Tian would die. However, no one was able to get past Ye Ming’s divine energy.

“You can stop now.” Suddenly, a figure with a sword on his back appeared in front of Ye Ming. When that person appeared, Yue Zifeng let out a startled cry.

It was Yue Zifeng’s master, the Heavenly Sword Gate’s new sect master, Ling Yunzi. Despite the thrumming divine energy, he managed to stand before Ye Ming. It seemed that he was outside the scope of the divine Dao.

“I didn’t expect an heir to the Sword God’s will to appear in this kind of low level place. Not bad, it’s actually the Annihilation Sword Dao,” said Ye Ming with a look of slight astonishment.

The fact that Ling Yunzi had comprehended the Annihilation Sword Dao was instantly seen through by Ye Ming. He truly stood at an even higher level.

However, Ling Yunzi’s expression didn’t twitch at all. Despite being seen through, he calmly said to Yue Zifeng, “Watch closely. This is your master’s final lesson to you. No matter what kind of opponent you’re facing, as long as your heart comes out of its sheath, there is no one that you cannot cut down, even a god!”

Ling Yunzi’s sword came out of its sheath like a bolt of lightning. He didn’t hesitate at all. A brilliant sword-light then illuminated the sky as he slashed his sword at Ye Ming. Even if his opponent was a god, Ling Yunzi was so confident.

“Not knowing your own power.” Ye Ming snorted and waved his hand. The power of a divine Dao transformed into a sharp sword slashing toward Ling Yunzi.

BOOM!

At this moment, divine light exploded and Ye Ming’s sword was hacked in two. As the sword-light fell, everything came to a stop.

Ling Yunzi held his sword, pointing it to the ground at an angle. As for Ye Ming, he stared in astonishment.

A thin line slowly grew from the top of Ye Ming’s head all the way to his throat. Everyone was stunned. Ling Yunzi had not just broken Ye Ming’s attack but had split his head. That was a god he was fighting, a true god!

Even the High Priest and Ma Ruyun were dumbfounded. This sword had surpassed the power of a divine Dao. It had reached an incomprehensible level.

The world was deathly silent as if time had stopped. Ling Yunzi and Ye Ming continued to stare at each other.

Finally, it was Ye Ming who sighed in admiration. “What a powerful sword. If it was my true body here, I really might have been killed. Too bad though, this is just a spiritual body of mine. Your annihilation will would only have maximum effect on a true body.”

“It really is regretful.” Ling Yunzi shook his head, sighing.

“It seems that the person you are all protecting is this world’s son of the heavens. You should be his companion Dao-protector, right? For even the Dao-protector to be so powerful, it seems that this era’s heavenly son is incredible. Our luck is really good. Such a strong son of the heavens can be refined into a human pill of incalculable value,” said Ye Ming, glancing toward Long Chen.

Suddenly, Ye Ming’s divine energy surged. After that, countless runes appeared, and the wound to his head slowly healed. No more blood flowed.

“I should warn you, if you can’t kill him, then you and everyone behind you… will meet a terrible end.”

Ling Yunzi’s sword began to dissipate. Then his hand, arm, and body began to scatter.

“Master…”

Yue Zifeng wept. Just now, he had been delighted by Ling Yunzi’s attack, thinking that his master had really managed to slay a god. But it was his master who died.

“Although your attack is sharp, breaking the power of my divine Dao and injuring my body, a sword cultivator’s defensive power is too weak to endure the backlash of my divine power. You slashed me once, and in exchange you’re dying. Hmph, sword cultivators are all like this,” sneered Ye Ming. He began walking forward again as Ling Yunzi’s body fully dissipated.

“Master…!” Yue Zifeng cried out. All his life, he had been a solitary character, but he viewed Ling Yunzi as his father. He couldn’t accept this result.

“Zifeng, master has returned to heaven and earth. Remember, when the sword is in your heart, your master will always be beside you…” Just as Yue Zifeng howled in grief, a message rang out in his mind.

“I’ll kill you!” Hearing his master’s final words, Yue Zifeng was unable to contain the pain, and his sword suddenly came out of its sheath, tearing the void apart. From the side, Mo Nian and the others cried out but were unable to stop him.

As the domain of divine power was split open, Yue Zifeng charged through, ignoring the power of divine Dao just like Ling Yunzi to slash Ye Ming.

“Hmph, although you have sword will, you haven’t comprehended a specific law of the Sword Dao. Such an unrefined power is far lacking compared to your master.” Ye Ming sneered and waved his hand. After that, astral winds blew and destroyed Yue Zifeng’s sword into countless pieces that pierced through his body. If it weren’t for the special clothes that Guo Ran and Xia Chen had made for him, he might have died. In any case, he was covered in blood from having the fragments of his own sword pierce him.

“I’ll kill you!” Even with no sword, even with his body covered in blood, Yue Zifeng used his fingers as a sword, attacking again.

“You’re in so much pain. I’ll be a good person and send you to see your master.” Ye Ming once more condensed a sword, slashing it at Yue Zifeng.

“Zifeng!” The Dragonblood warriors cried out. If this sword landed, not even ten lives would be enough for Yue Zifeng to survive.

Blood splashed. However, everyone was shocked to see Yue Zifeng’s fingers pierce Ye Ming’s chest. As for Ye Ming’s sword, it was caught by a sword made of white flames.

A peerlessly beautiful woman in a white dress had appeared, blocking Ye Ming’s divine sword.
