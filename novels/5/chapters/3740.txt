Chapter 3729 Start

Long Chen had been too focused. It was only when Xia Guhong’s warning exploded in his ear that he pulled back his vision. When he did, he suddenly felt an immense pain in his eye.

He was also shocked to find that countless cracks had covered his eyeball. It was on the verge of exploding. As for the sudden pain, it was so much that even Long Chen couldn’t hold back a painful grunt. He hastily held his eye with his hand.

A burst of terror filled Long Chen’s heart. This was all thanks to Xia Guhong’s warning. Without it, this eye of his would have been lost.

Long Chen had expected to sense some pain while he was looking. But somehow, he ended up inflicting himself with such a wound without realizing it.

Long Chen quickly stopped the blood and put on the eyepatch that Bai Xiaole’s mother had given him.

“It’s too bad. I didn’t get to see the most important part.”

Long Chen was a bit vexed. He didn’t get to see the person wielding that net or what those huge figures were.

“If you saw that part, it wouldn’t be just your eye. You would have lost your life. The karma involved in the secrets of the nine heavens that involve all life is not something that you can endure,” said Xia Guhong.

His meaning was that just being capable of seeing a bit was incredible. If Long Chen had seen the real secret, he would have died.

Countless experts were staring at Long Chen in shock. They all noticed the abnormalities in him.

“Did he… did he just look at the immemorial secrets?”

“He didn’t die after that? But it does seem like he paid a terrifying price.”

“I wonder what secret he saw.”

“Who cares? We’ll force it out of him when the time comes.”

After a moment of shock, people started to get greedy. Countless heavenly geniuses eyed Long Chen like prey, wanting to know what he had seen.

Long Chen had directly received the karma by looking into those secrets. Once he narrated what he saw, the karma would no longer be as terrible. As long as they could capture him and force him to answer, or do a direct soulsearch, they would know what he had seen.

Whether it was the younger disciples or the elders who had come to protect them, they were all filled with curiosity as to what had happened within that black world. What kind of existence could unleash a roar that would shatter the laws of their world even from another spacetime?

“Hehe, boss, it looks like you’ve become everyone’s target,” said Guo Ran with a sinister smile when he saw those people’s greedy gazes.

“Good intentions can’t advise a ghost about to die. If people want to die, it’s impossible to stop them. What we need to do is send them to another world to repent,” said Long Chen while consuming a medicinal pill indifferently.

Just then, a ray of light appeared within the three thousand worlds. When the darkness receded, the holy lotus once more appeared. The Grand Dao Flower had returned to its original appearance.

As the divine light of the Grand Dao Flower illuminated the world once again, it thrummed with vitality. The corpses and blood were gone. It was as if time was a miraculous hand cleansing the world of its scars. The passage of time made it as if nothing had ever happened. The world was thriving once more.

It was like everything that they had just seen was nothing more than a nightmare. But although the Grand Dao Flower was back, that sight still shook countless people.

Those arrogant heavenly geniuses that were barely containing their anticipation for this moment all felt cold. Their blazing enthusiasm was dampened. It seemed that the three thousand worlds were not as beautiful as they had imagined.

It had to be known that what they had just seen was no nightmare. It had really happened. It might even have happened inside the three thousand worlds and been recorded by the Grand Dao Flower.

Although they had seen nothing more than a flash of that battlefield, it was still incredibly terrifying. The experts of that era were incredible. Any random one of them could wipe them out.

They finally understood why in that era, the human race stood at the peak of the ten thousand races. That era of the human race would never be surpassed.

As the Grand Dao Flower slowly revolved, the originally bustling Violet Flame Heaven Capital was deathly silent. No one said a word. It took several breaths for people to gradually recover from their shock.

“Our human race actually had such a glorious era.” Someone from the human race couldn’t help sighing emotionally. He was full of reverence and worship for those predecessors.

“What glory? In the end, you still became our food. You only survived by wagging your tails pitifully,” sneered a devil expert.

“No matter how glorious your human race’s history was, don’t forget that in the primal chaos era, your human race was nothing more than a pack of inferior servants.”

“The human race is truly a pack of fools that forget things as soon as they’re out of sight. There’s no point in reasoning with you. The most effective thing on you is always the whip and the blade. If you don’t listen, get whipped. If you still don’t listen, then you can simply be killed.”

All the other races mocked them. That was because in that scene, they had seen their own predecessors being killed by the human race despite their overwhelming number advantage. They hadn’t expected the human race to be that powerful at that time.

“You trash, who do you think you are? The human race’s predecessors were so glorious. As their descendants, we naturally can continue that glory!” Guo Ran furiously pointed at those arrogant races.

“Continue that glory? What a joke. Your human race has continuously suppressed and killed your own people for countless years. There’s no need for us to even do anything. You’ll just kill yourselves. Even before we came, we saw your foolish human race attacking and tearing down each other. A race that has zero unity actually wishes to inherit their former glory? Are you trying to make us laugh to death?”

Countless races laughed. Only the human race’s experts were enraged yet helpless to do anything about it. That was because the human race truly never had any unity. That person’s words struck them right where it hurt, leaving them with no room to retaliate.

The human race naturally also knew that they should be united. But there was no way for them to do so. The heart of humans was always the most difficult thing to understand in this world. It could even be considered more difficult to understand than the Heavenly Daos.

In the human race’s history, countless heroes had appeared. But none of them was capable of uniting the human race. Although these words were hard to hear, they were unquestionably fact.

“It might not be possible to make you laugh to death, but I feel like we can always try killing you,” said Guo Ran furiously. He wanted to kill them right here and now.

The eighteen Dragonblood warriors were already holding their weapons. As long as Guo Ran made a move, they would directly start a slaughter.

The Dragonblood warriors had endured countless hardships, but this had tempered their fearless, unyielding wills. They were still sharp divine blades, and they might even be sharper than before.

“Idiots of the human race, listen well. Don’t let me see you in the three thousand worlds, or I’ll kill every one of you that I see!” roared an arrogant expert of the demonic beast race.

The other races shouted as well, provoking them. Other than the Spirit race, almost all the other races were starting to provoke the human race.

The human race’s experts were enraged but also shocked. Were they asking to repeat the scene that they had just seen? Was a battle between ten thousand races about to erupt again?

Suddenly, the gate quivered and countless specks of light flew out. When that light touched people, they involuntarily flew toward the gate.

“It’s starting, hahaha!”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

People cried out excitedly as they flew over. One speck of light then landed on Guo Ran, and he was also pulled toward the gate.

“Ha, you little bastard, I’ve long since found you displeasing!” It just so happened that Guo Ran crossed paths with that demonic beast that had just mocked the human race. Guo Ran then smashed his fist toward him.

Just like that, this arrogant expert was blown apart.

“Courting death!”

This one punch instantly ignited the rage in every demonic beast present. They directly charged over at him. At this moment, Long Chen’s body also quivered and a strange pull sucked him toward the gate. In that instant, Long Chen’s blood started boiling excitedly
