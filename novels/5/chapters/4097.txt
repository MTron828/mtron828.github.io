Chapter 4086 Nirvana Divine Rune

“That… that’s a bit inappropriate!” This sudden change left the guild master stuttering, well just a bit.

It had to be known that the Sacred Pill Hall’s secret arts were unique, and they were only transmitted to the most devout followers of the Sacred Pill Hall. These techniques were what allowed them to refine pills easily in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

Over countless years, the Huayun Trading Company and other powers had longed to learn those secret arts. That was the only way they could break the Sacred Pill Hall’s monopoly on the pill market.

The price of the Sacred Pill Hall’s pills was incredibly high. However, no matter how high they raised the price, the demand never slowed down. As for the Soaring Dragon Company, they were an even bigger scammer and actually used auctions to sell these medicinal pills.

During their auctions, the Soaring Dragon Company’s own people would make bids to drive the price up. Unless it reached their ideal price, they wouldn’t sell the pills.

It could be said that the Soaring Dragon Company and the Sacred Pill Hall had gone too far in many ways, but there was no way around it. Unless all those cultivators suddenly stopped requiring medicinal pills, they had to let themselves be ripped off.

As a result, countless human experts sorrowfully said that the reason the human race was bullied to this extent was largely thanks to the Sacred Pill Hall’s contributions.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If the Sacred Pill Hall wanted to make money, that wasn’t a problem, but they couldn’t be too evil. Roping in believers was also no problem, but it couldn’t be done while harming the entire human race just for the development of Lord Brahma’s followers.

The Sacred Pill Hall prioritized selling to Lord Brahma’s followers. This was why Lord Brahma alone could occupy the majority of the human race’s powers.

Hence, at this moment, if Yu Qingxuan could pass the secret arts to the Huayun Trading Company and they became capable of refining medicinal pills containing the laws of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, then the human race’s entire structure would change.

The guild master was still filled with disbelief. Long Chen smiled and said, “There’s nothing inappropriate about it. I really look down on the Sacred Pill Hall and Soaring Dragon Company’s actions, so I won’t ask for anything in exchange. As long as they’re unhappy, I’m happy.”

Seeing that Long Chen was serious, the guild master immediately gathered the core alchemy Elders of the Huayun Trading Company.

Yu Qingxuan directly shared the alchemy arts that Dongfang Zichu had taught her. As for what aspect of her technique was the main crux to being able to refine pills in this heaven, she was unaware of it. They would need to search for it themselves.

However, Yu Qingxuan’s alchemy arts were vast, so these Elders would need some time to digest her extensive skills.

But then, the Huayun Trading Company had plenty of people in it, so such a thing was not difficult for them. After Yu Qingxuan shared her alchemy arts with them, the Elders immediately set off to secretly gather alchemy masters.

If they could resolve the problem of medicinal pills, many human forces would not be forced to submit to the Sacred Pill Hall or Soaring Dragon Company. Then the Huayun Trading Company would be able to wrest away some of their market dominance. As a result, there would probably be some changes in regard to those powers that only joined Lord Brahma for medicinal pills.

In order to allow these alchemists to comprehend the essence of her techniques faster, Yu Qingxuan even specifically explained some of the more profound aspects, adding her annotations and interpretations. Seven days passed just like that.

Finally, thanks to everyone’s efforts, they found the crucial aspect of it—when Yu Qingxuan refined pills, she condensed a divine rune.

Yu Qingxuan said that this rune was something Dongfang Zichu taught her after she had obtained the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

Furthermore, many of the pills that she had refined were taken by Dongfang Zichu. In truth, by that time, Yu Qingxuan’s skill in alchemy had far surpassed Dongfang Zichu’s.

This rune that Dongfang Zichu taught Yu Qingxuan was called the nirvana divine rune, and it stemmed from the original Nirvana Scripture.

He didn’t tell Yu Qingxuan because he didn’t want her to know certain secrets. Actually, just transmitting the nirvana divine rune to her was already a taboo.

However, in order to obtain those pills, he had no choice but to take that risk. In any case, Yu Qingxuan’s life and death was under his control, so he didn’t have that many misgivings about doing so.

But never in his dreams would he have thought that this action of his would cause endless trouble for Lord Brahma.

Once they found the nirvana divine rune, these alchemists immediately got to work. The first few volumes of the Nirvana Scripture were no secret, so many alchemists had a chance to read them.

Anyway, the nirvana divine rune was something only those who had trained in the Nirvana Scripture could condense. Fortunately, many amongst them had learned the Nirvana Scripture, and so they quickly condensed the nirvana divine rune.

When refining pills, by adding the nirvana divine rune to the pill furnace, the energy of the Heavenly Daos no longer showed any rejection at all. When the refinement was complete, even the guild master couldn’t help jumping excitedly.

“The pill condensed! It really did condense! And the medicinal energy is the exact same as the Sacred Pill Hall’s!” The alchemists cheered, and some were so emotional that they cried.

“The human race now has hope for rising. With these medicinal pills, the human race’s overall power will quickly rise. We will no longer be bullied and slaughtered by others!” shouted one alchemist.

Long Chen was also moved. For these alchemists to be thinking of other people, of the entire human race first, it was truly rare. Most would be thinking about making more money or beating their competitors. This kind of aspiration, this kind of heart, it was something that those businessmen who only thought of money could not compare to. The Huayun Trading Company truly was a pure land in the business world.

The alchemists repeatedly thanked Yu Qingxuan and Long Chen. Now that they had the nirvana divine rune, they started gathering and raising alchemists in large numbers.

As for the matter of keeping it secret, Long Chen didn’t have to worry about it. The Huayun Trading Company was always meticulous. The alchemists that they recruited and trained were fervent followers of the Wealth God, so they were definitely trustworthy.

The guild master expressed that he would immediately report this to the higher-ups, and the profits from the medicinal pills would quickly come down to them.

However, he also apologetically said that at the start, the medicinal pills might not make much money. After all, these medicinal pills were a must-have for the human race’s development, and the Huayun Trading Company wouldn’t use them to make such a huge profit. They had their own bottom line.

Long Chen replied that it was fine. The money was a minor matter. As long as it made the Soaring Dragon Company and the Sacred Pill Hall unhappy, he was happy. That was a typical case of someone with money not minding spending a lot for happiness.

Having collaborated for so long, both in the mortal world and in the immortal world, Long Chen was indebted to the Huayun Trading Company. Although it was called a joint collaboration, Long Chen was still very grateful to them.

Long Chen didn’t participate in the rest of this matter, so Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan left the alchemy room. When they did, they found that there were now hundreds of barriers set up in the surroundings. From this, it could be seen just how importantly the Huayun Trading Company viewed this matter.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan then took this chance to stroll around, holding hands. It was their first time getting a break since arriving in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, and this rare moment of peace was spent roaming the Huayun Trading Company’s flower garden.

This place was only for the people of Huayun Trading Company; its scenery was beautiful and peaceful. It was a place for their disciples to rest and relax.

Many people waved and greeted Long Chen when they arrived, but then made their excuses to leave, letting the two of them enjoy this place to themselves. That made Long Chen feel a bit embarrassed.

After a while, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan arrived at a small lake. Just as they took out chairs to sit in, Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He then pointed at a large tree, and in response, a gust of wind swept through the area.
