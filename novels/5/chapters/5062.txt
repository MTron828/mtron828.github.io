Chapter 5051 A Grudge Against a Common Enemy


When that middle-aged woman turned to look at Long Chen, his concealed dragon blood started rapidly circulating. Long Chen felt like he was being seen through.

“As expected.” The middle-aged woman nodded. “Let’s go together.”

She walked into their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, along with the rest of the white dragon race’s experts.

While Long Chen was still hesitating, Bai Yingxue appeared beside him and whispered, “Come on. Don’t worry, we won’t harm you.”

Long Chen smiled bitterly and said, “I know you won’t harm me. But I’m worried I’ll harm you!”

Long Chen’s goal was to muddle his way into the Glacial Heaven Domain. If the Brahma Pill Valley discovered he had snuck in with the white dragon race, they would undoubtedly cause trouble for them. He didn't want to be the reason for their problems.

“Come on. I have things I wish to speak with you about,” said the middle-aged woman from a distance.

Hearing that, Long Chen stopped hesitating and entered the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest with Bai Yingxue. Once they were inside, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest slowly started flying off.

Inside, Long Chen noticed that the white dragon disciples numbered in the millions. Countless eyes peered at him from many openings.

Fortunately, those gazes were only curious, not hostile. When Long Chen reached the heart of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, he saw a large immortal cave.

Everyone else retreated once they arrived here, and even Bai Yingxue stopped.

“You two can come in together!” The woman’s voice rang out from inside.

Only then did Bai Yingxue walk in with Long Chen. Once inside, it felt as though a barrier had closed behind them, cutting off the immortal cave from the outside world.

The immortal cave was extremely spacious yet simple. Aside from the core region having a refined pagoda, the rest was empty.

Upon reaching the pagoda, Long Chen realized that it offered a view of everything outside the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. The nest was slowly flying through the air, passing by mountains and rivers. It was so stable that, without the view, it wouldn’t have felt like they were flying.

Compared to Long Chen’s flying boat, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was much more comfortable. Long Chen sighed inside. Back then, he had gathered quite a few Ten Thousand Dragon Nests, but he had tossed them all into the primal chaos space to be devoured.

Just its comfortable way of flying and its domineering air that scared away countless threats was enough to make it enticing. If Long Chen could control a Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, he wouldn’t have had to endure those nonsensical things.

“Sit!” the middle-aged woman commanded.

She was seated on the pagoda. When she waved her hand, a straw mat landed in front of Long Chen.

Long Chen and Bai Yingxue came here together, but there was only one mat. Seeing this, Long Chen hastily said, “Junior will stand to hear Senior’s instructions!”

Smiling slightly, the middle-aged woman said, “Sit. The youngest dean of the High Firmament Academy is qualified to sit as equals with me.”

It seemed that she knew his background. Long Chen awkwardly looked at Bai Yingxue. She smiled and pushed him lightly, indicating he could sit without worry.

Long Chen sat, but in front of such a terrifying expert, Long Chen didn’t dare to be the slightest bit rude. He sat perfectly upright to avoid seeming disrespectful.

“As the dean of the High Firmament Academy, you’ve actually run over to the Glacial Heaven Domain. Are you planning on causing a fuss in the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain?” asked the middle-aged woman.

“Yes, that’s why I don’t want to join your group. Otherwise, in the future…” Long Chen said, speaking truthfully.

“It’s fine. I am leading half the white dragon race’s disciples to the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain to put everything on the table against the Brahma Pill Valley,” interjected the middle-aged woman.

Long Chen was startled. “Please forgive this junior’s ignorance, but what does that mean?”

Long Chen truly didn’t understand. If they were invited by the Brahma Pill Valley, they should be considered guests and have a decent relationship with the Brahma Pill Valley. What did it mean to put everything on the table?

The middle-aged woman didn’t directly reply. Instead, she said, “First, let me introduce myself. I am the white dragon race’s Dragon Guard’s captain, Bai Yingxuan.”

Long Chen was startled. How could a random guard captain be so terrifying? The white dragon race’s power must be astonishing.

Long Chen hastily cupped his fists and said, “Apologies for my rudeness.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As if seeing through his thoughts, Bai Yingxue added, “Our white dragon race doesn’t like fighting, but we need the power to protect ourselves. Our race’s strongest elite force is called the Dragon Guard, and the position of the Dragon Guards captain is second only to the race leader.”

Only then did Long Chen realize that this position was not of some small squad. That was close. He had almost pissed himself. If a small squad captain already possessed this level of force, then the Brahma Pill Valley would have to flee as soon as they saw the white dragon race.

Long Chen hastily cupped his fists again. “Apologies for my rudeness again.”

In response, Bai Yingxuan smiled slightly. “Dean Long Chen, you don’t need to be so courteous. You possess Sovereign blood, the highest bloodline of the dragon race. To put it frankly, we are one family. Additionally, the white dragon race has been constantly targeted by Brahma Pill Valley recently. We are also being pressured by other dragon races. Due to this, we can be considered united against a common enemy.”

“You have enmity with the Brahma Pill Valley?” Long Chen hadn’t expected such a revelation.

Bai Yingxuan nodded and then told him a secret. The Brahma Pill Valley wasn’t just the overlord of the human race; their influence extended across numerous races. From the devil and demon races to the blood, Spirit, Nether, and Underworld races, none could evade their grasp.

Even the dragon race was no exception. When the Sovereign Emperor Heaven was sealed off, the Brahma Pill Valley’s sights fell on the dragon race. They offered a myriad of pills tailored to each race’s talents and cultivation styles, tempting the dragons to join their cause.

However, the proud and powerful dragon clans refused to abandon their ancient cultivation methods. They scorned the offerings of the humans.

On the other hand, some weaker dragon races couldn’t resist the bait. Under the guise of experimentation, they forged alliances with the Brahma Pill Valley. Consequently, aided by the Valley’s medicinal pills, these weaker dragon races experienced astonishing growth in power.

Witnessing their soaring advancements, other dragon races were tempted. More and more of them started to lean toward the Brahma Pill Valley, and some of their disciples even pledged allegiance to Lord Brahma.

“Our dragon race’s greatest faith lies solely with the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign. From our perspective, the actions of the Brahma Pill Valley amount to a blatant provocation against the entire dragon race. This is utterly egregious and cannot be tolerated,” declared Bai Yingxuan, her face turning frosty. Killing intent filled her eyes.
