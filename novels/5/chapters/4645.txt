When the Dragonblood Legion approached the gate of the Void Spirit World, some groups of people tried to block them, among them the Celestial race. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

Back then, countless elites stood in front of the gate, and the Dragonblood Legion couldn't maintain a low profile, especially given their affiliation with the prestigious High Firmament Academy, the number one academy in the world.

In Long Chen‚Äôs absence, they exercised caution to avoid provoking anyone. To minimize attention, members of the Dragonblood Legion, along with those from the High Firmament Academy, Battle God Palace, and Starry River Sect, decided to split up.

The High Firmament Academy‚Äôs fame had soared not only due to its title as the world‚Äôs number one academy but also because of Long Chen‚Äôs presence. Consequently, countless experts were actively seeking him out, and they wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to target the Dragonblood Legion.

Despite doing their best to maintain a low profile, they couldn‚Äôt avoid others provoking them.

Some factions that thought themselves powerful directly challenged the Dragonblood Legion upon seeing them. While the Dragonblood Legion was trying to remain low-key, they refused to be bullied.

Quite a few scuffles occurred, some bigger than others, resulting in the Dragonblood Legion slaying many people who didn‚Äôt know how high the heavens were.

After they arrived in the Void Spirit World, they clashed with a branch of the Celestial race, and a bloody battle occurred.

The Dragonblood Legion was ruthless and directly crushed this small group of thousands of experts, provoking a calamity for themselves. After all, the Celestial race was an enormous existence, and they had numerous powerful allies as well.

Afterward, the Celestial race started to look everywhere for the Dragonblood Legion. Fortunately, with a formation master like Xia Chen present, they could always break through the encirclement of their enemies. No one could make them stay behind.

Even so, Guo Ran and the others became familiar with the Celestial race‚Äôs terrifying power. As for the very start of their enmity, it stemmed from this group of the Spirit race. Guo Ran and the others happened to witness the Celestial race taking advantage of the Spirit race.

Surrounded by a special immortal spiritual qi and possessing exceptional beauty, these women from the Spirit race attracted the attention of a branch of the Celestial race. These women had no experience in this world and didn‚Äôt understand other people‚Äôs sinister intentions.

With just a few questions, the Celestial race learned that these women numbered only just over a thousand people. Furthermore, they didn‚Äôt have any helpers. Seizing the opportunity, the Celestial race exposed their cruel side and captured them.

These women were actually quite powerful, each of them on par with a five-star Doyen. However, they were severely outnumbered. Over ten of them were killed in the fight, and the rest were all captured alive.

After that, this group of the Celestial race started to brazenly humiliate them in front of everyone else, and the Dragonblood Legion happened to pass by.

Seeing this scene, the Dragonblood warriors couldn‚Äôt stand still, their killing intent exploded. They took out their weapons and slaughtered the disgusting Celestial race‚Äôs experts, not leaving a single one alive.

At first, they thought the matter was settled because they left no survivors. Unbeknownst to them, one of the sneaky Celestial race‚Äôs experts had escaped without hesitation during the initial clash, unnoticed by any of the Dragonblood warriors.

This person spread the word to the rest of the Celestial race, solidifying the enmity between the Dragonblood Legion and the Celestial race.

To make matters worse, the Celestial race spread slander, accusing the Dragonblood Legion of lusting after the Spirit race's women and intentionally attacking the Celestial race when they coincidentally encountered them.

Under the banner of killing villains to save the Spirit race‚Äôs women, the Celestial race gathered their people and allies and surrounded the Dragonblood Legion.

As a result, the Dragonblood Legion had to flee like mice in the streets. At that moment, Guo Ran and the others almost exploded with fury, but there was nothing they could do. Naturally, the other side gave them no chance to argue.

Fortunately, Long Chen had found them in time. If he were to arrive any later, all of his brothers would have been killed by these Flame Evil Spirits.

Having just fought an immense battle, all the Dragonblood warriors were injured, and Yue Zifeng was unconscious. Bai Xiaole and Bai Shishi were also exhausted and wounded, with Bai Shishi's core energy particularly damaged in the fight. The golden light in her eyes had dimmed.

‚ÄúCelestial race, just you wait.‚Äù Long Chen clenched his teeth. Regretfully, by the time he arrived, most of the Celestial race had already left, leaving behind only a few stragglers.

‚ÄúLong Chen, it was our fault. We implicated Guo Ran and the rest of you. I hope you won‚Äôt blame them. Just blame us,‚Äù said that woman of the Spirit race.

Long Chen smiled at her. ‚ÄúMiss, you‚Äôre too courteous. We have a very close relationship with the Spirit race. Your affairs are our affairs.‚Äù

Hearing that, the woman was very moved. Long Chen also asked them a few questions, and she quickly explained that they were from the Sublime Spirit race.

It was no wonder that they were so beautiful and had such bountiful immortal spiritual qi. The Sublime Spirit race was on average even more beautiful and graceful than the rest of the Spirit race.

For the Celestial race‚Äôs people to be so brutish toward these pure-hearted women, they were no better than animals.

Although Long Chen had not encountered the Celestial race before today, just based on their gesture toward these women of the Sublime Spirit race, Long Chen had come to a conclusion as to what kind of people they were.

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù Long Chen came to Bai Shishi‚Äôs side. He then took out a golden pill and fed it to her. It was a metal attribute Saint pill that he had just asked the Earth Cauldron to refine.

Bai Shishi consumed this pill and smiled sweetly, not saying anything. The way Long Chen looked at her filled her with so much warmth that it made her feel like all the bitterness she had experienced was worth it, no matter how bitter. After all, only one person in this world could look at her like that and love her from the depths of his soul and heart.

Long Chen meticulously examined everyone‚Äôs injuries. In the end, he was relieved to find that Guo Ran was really an outstanding commander. Despite the fierce battle they endured, not a single member of the Dragonblood Legion had fallen.

Long Chen‚Äôs arrival also filled them with confidence, and they could all focus on healing with him here. As long as Long Chen was present, even if the heavens collapsed, he would hold them up.

While everyone was recovering, Long Chen came to Yu Qingxuan‚Äôs side. When he looked into the distance, his heart suddenly stopped beating for a bit.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs...‚Äù
