Chapter 2908 Despicable and Shameless

“Mu Qingyun, are you not going to kneel?”

A strange light flowed within Devil Eye Yang Fang’s eyes. When he spoke, Mu Qingyun’s body quivered. Her eyes lost their luster, as if her soul had been taken.

“Yang Fang cultivates eye techniques. Mu Qingyun’s injuries are too severe, so she is instantly taken in!”

Devil Eye Yang Fang was an extremely nefarious existence amongst the outer academy’s disciples. Many people felt fear when his name was mentioned.

His eye technique was able to control people’s souls, and he had even more terrifying eye techniques. Therefore, not many people dared to provoke him.

He was quite famous, but only a few people had ever seen his techniques. Hence, seeing Mu Qingyun instantly fall under his control with just a glance, they were shocked.

“Despicable! Mu Qingyun is severely injured and exhausted! Otherwise, with her Sword Dao will, how could she be so easily captured by his technique? Yang Fang really is in the same pack as Chu Kuang!”

Yang Fang’s sudden move truly was taking advantage of her state. It was not the action of a strong and courageous person but the action of a coward.

“Senior apprentice-sister Qingyun!”

The disciple supporting Mu Qingyun cried out in a panic, but she didn’t seem to hear. Her whole body was shaking.

“Kneel!”

Devil Eye Yang Fang shouted, causing her shaking to get even worse. She was under the control of his eye technique, but her will continued to resist.

Seeing Chu Kuang and the others just standing to the side, Luo Bing suddenly shouted, “Chu Kuang is so insidious! He doesn’t just want victory, but he also wants to humiliate the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples and shatter their confidence. He wants them to be broken for the rest of their lives. Then he’ll use them to infuriate Long Chen, while Tang Yaochen hides at the back. Look, he is silently forming hand seals. There are runic fluctuations spreading across the land. He’s setting up a trap. The Unfettered Alliance’s disciples have now become bait for Long Chen.”

Hearing that, Luo Ning was startled and hastily looked at Tang Yaochen. Just as Luo Bing said, his wide sleeves were quivering slightly. He was definitely secretly forming hand seals.

There were occasionally faint runes appearing in the surroundings, and everyone was focused on the battle. If it hadn’t been for Luo Bing’s reminder, no one would have noticed.

After spotting this, they looked at Long Chen who was running back. He was on the verge of reaching the battlefield again, and they felt a chill.

Although they all detested Chu Kuang, they had no choice but to admit that he was truly crafty. He was like a viper that devoured its prey whole. This scheming heart was frightening.

At this moment, Yang Fang’s eyes flickered. Mu Qingyun had fallen into his illusions but was still resisting his orders, infuriating him.

He shouted several times, but Mu Qinguyn didn’t kneel. Her knees didn’t bend.

Suddenly, Yang Fang’s gaze changed. His voice became soft. “Tell me, who’s the person you like the most?”

“I don’t have someone that I like. I worship my brother San the most,” answered Mu Qingyun.

The light in Yang Fang’s eyes intensified. “Your brother San wants you to take off your clothes. Quick, take off your clothes.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The experts outside were enraged at this shamelessness. If Mu Qingyun did this, then once she recovered and realized what she had done, would she even want to live any longer? It was more malicious than killing a person. Right now, even the head judge’s expression changed, and a vein pulsed on his head. Dense killing intent radiated from his eyes.

“Senior sister Qingyun you can’t…!” The disciple propping Mu Qingyun cried out, but just at that moment, she fainted and collapsed.

Mu Qingyun’s eyes were lifeless, and she appeared bashful. It was unknown if that was the reservation of a young woman or her will to resist, but she didn’t move her hands.

“Quickly, take them off. Your brother San is waiting…” Yang Fang’s voice was full of enticement. It was a voice that gave people chills.

Finally, Mu Qingyun’s hands reached toward her chest. Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu cried out, screaming for her to stop. However, she didn’t hear. They wanted to charge over, but Gu Fei sent them flying once again.

Yang Fang grew excited, and he formed hand seals, pressing her. “Quickly, quickly, you’ve almost done it! You-”

“DIE!”

A voice rang out like a celestial god’s furious roar, shaking the very heavens. This furious roar contained a supreme will.

As a result, Yang Fang’s head exploded, and this made Chu Kuang and the others jump in shock.

As Devil Eye Yang Fang’s headless corpse fell to the ground, blood flowed out of his neck.

“It’s Long Chen!”

The experts outside cheered. That roar had come from Long Chen. He had finally reached the battlefield.

Long Chen was extremely anxious about everything that he was seeing after he was schemed against. However, his thunderforce wasn’t strong enough to allow him to fly, so he could only run. And when he saw Devil Eye Yang Fang’s attempt to humiliate Mu Qingyun like this, his fury soared.

As soon as he was close enough, he gathered his Spiritual Strength for a roar, directly striking Devil Eye Yang Fang. If the latter hadn’t been concentrating all of his Spiritual Strength on Mu Qingyun, this roar would only have injured him.

However, with his Spiritual Strength scattered, this roar instantly threw his eye technique into chaos, and the explosion of Spiritual Strength destroyed his head, ending his life.

While some people were shocked, the experts outside cheered. This Devil Eye Yang Fang deserved death, so they were all delighted by this.

Even the head judge sighed with relief inside. If Long Chen hadn’t stopped Yang Fang, then even if the head judge had to take on the infamy of being a rule breaker, he would still have crushed Yang Fang. Worst case, he would simply give up his head judge position.

After Devil Eye Yang Fang was killed, Long Chen shot out like a lightning bolt. At this moment, the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples that were still fighting instantly found their pillar, and their morale soared.

“Long Chen, don’t enter the battlefield! They’ve set up a trap!” Luo Ning shouted, but it was meaningless. The people in the competition couldn’t hear the ones outside.

Long Chen was already charging into the battlefield. As soon as he reached them, countless runes lit throughout the battlefield. Rays of light then converged on Long Chen.

“Scram.” At the rear of the crowd, Tang Yaochen smiled coldly. He rapidly formed hand seals.
