Chapter 1109 Heaven Defying Luck

Translator: BornToBe

“Senior, my name is Meng Qi,” answered Meng Qi. She was extremely uneasy in the face of this legendary existence.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow was said to have disappeared in ancient times. Nowadays, it was almost impossible to see one.

If it wanted to kill the two of them, there would be no doubt as to the conclusion. So she was naturally uneasy.

However, Long Chen wasn’t nervous. He held Meng Qi’s hand, giving her a bit of comfort. From the start, Long Chen hadn’t been able to sense the slightest killing intent from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow. Perhaps it was worried about the true dragon blood flowing through his veins.

A lost species from the immortal era like the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow had its own inheritance, and its intelligence was not low.

“You’re not a bad human. I can give one of my children to you,” said the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow.

What? Long Chen and Meng Qi were both startled, unable to believe their own ears.

“Yes, I can give one of my children to you. I hope you’ll treat it well,” repeated the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow.

“Senior, I...” Meng Qi was still in disbelief. What mother simply gave away her children?

“I have my own reason for it. Right now, I don’t have the ability to raise both of them. Three hundred years ago, I went through a fierce battle. The children’s father died in battle, and I also received heavy injuries. I fled here and gave birth to them.

“Although my injury gradually recovered during this time, I also have to feed them my essence blood to incubate them. Now I’m stuck. Unless I give up my life, I only have enough essence blood for one child. If I go too far, I’ll die, and the surrounding beasts will immediately devour my children.

“I can’t die, but only one of my children can survive. As a mother, I was never able to make the choice. Now I’ve reached my limit. If I still don’t decide, both of them will die.” The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow looked at the two huge eggs. Its voice was quiet and seeped with sadness.

For a mother to abandon one of her children, whether it was a human or a Magical Beast, it was always a painful choice. Meng Qi’s tears streamed down. She formed a natural resonance with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow and understood its grief and pain.

“Senior, I can stay here and use my Spiritual Strength to help you incubate them. I have secret arts only a Beast Tamer knows that can help them hatch faster,” said Meng Qi.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow looked at Meng Qi. “You’re a good child. Thank you for your kindness. Perhaps this is simply destiny foreordained by this world. Just as I was preparing to abandon a child, you came. Or perhaps this is the guidance of the ancestors.

“However, having both of them stay by my side isn’t necessarily a good thing, and giving one to you isn’t necessarily a bad thing either. The Heavenly Daos are always unclear, making the future unknown. I trust you will treat my child kindly, so come, pick one. Their fates will now drift apart, and as for whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, it will be up the will of the heavens. Choose.”

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow had Meng Qi choose herself, but Meng Qi was now in a tough spot. How was she supposed to take away a mother’s child right in front of her?

“Long Chen...” Meng Qi looked toward Long Chen.

Long Chen sighed, “Foolish girl, what’s so difficult about this? Even senior has said that this is destiny. If we didn’t come, one of them would have died anyway. You’re helping our senior, and there’s no need for you to be apologetic. With your talent and abilities, whichever one stays by your side will grow limitlessly. Most importantly, considering your kind nature, you’ll definitely treat it as your most trusted companion. This is also why senior is willing to give its child to you.”

Of course, these principles were understood by all parties. But when the choice was given to her, she found herself unable to decide. Meng Qi looked from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow to Long Chen. Both of them looked at her with encouraging eyes.

Meng Qi made her determination. “I’ll let them decide. Let’s see which one of them wants to go with me.”

Meng Qi touched her forehead, and two runes slowly flew out. They landed on the two huge eggs. These were Meng Qi’s spiritual seals.

When they landed on the eggs, one of the runes quickly brightened slightly. Meng Qi smiled. This egg had formed a slight resonance with her spirit.

As for the other egg, there was no reaction. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow said, “As expected, it really was the will of the heavens. That was the one I was about to abandon. Maybe it feels that I was too cruel.”

Its voice was full of sorrow, making Meng Qi feel sour. She didn’t know what to say.

Suddenly, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow shot into the sky, instantly disappearing amongst the clouds. Then multicolored light bloomed, and a huge figure appeared in the sky.

A terrifying pressure spread throughout the land. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow had revealed its true body.

Its whole body was covered in multicolored wings that shone brightly in the sunlight. The flap of its wings caused space to crumble, as if heaven and earth could not bear its existence. Long Chen and Meng Qi both looked at it in shock. This aura was absolutely terrifying. As expected, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s name was well-deserved.

Its entire body began to shine, and then a drop of blood slowly fell from its forehead.

That drop of blood contained boundless flickering runes. Bright light came from it, and there was even a blazing divine flame within it.

The drop of blood landed on the egg Meng Qi had chosen. Runes lit up on the egg, and the blood was quickly absorbed. In the end, the blood disappeared and it was like nothing had happened at all.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s aura had clearly dropped slightly now. It returned to the nest and shrank again.

“This is the final thing I can do as a mother for my child.” It looked at the egg. That drop of blood was the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s inheritance essence blood. Once it hatched, it would automatically awaken its innate abilities as its power increased.

But bringing out this inheritance essence blood was extremely taxing. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow looked dimmer and fainter than before.

“In truth, taking away my child isn’t necessarily a blessing for you. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is viewed as traitors of the Xuan Beast races. We are hunted down by the Xuan Beasts, and so this might bring a calamity to you in the future. Take care of yourselves,” said the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow.

“The Xuan Beasts? The ancestors of the ancient races?” Long Chen was surprised. The Xuan Beasts still existed?

“Correct. There are tens of thousands of Xuan Beast races, and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is one of them. It’s just that... well, nevermind. These secrets aren’t suitable for you to learn. In any case, I’ve entrusted my child to you. I hope you’ll treat it well.” The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow had said that last sentence several times now, but as a mother, this was its request.

“Don’t worry, senior. As long as I, Long Chen, live, no one can bully my companions.” Long Chen patted his chest confidently.

“Yes, this is the style a descendant of the true dragons should possess. But you should be careful. As your cultivation base increases, the chances of you being hunted down will increase, and not because of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow. You should know that true dragon blood is something that can cause greed in countless people.

“Alright, just now I released my aura. To be safe, I have to switch locations. Take care of my child. You should leave quickly as well, because this place is no longer safe. Good luck. Don’t hate me for being long-winded, but... please just look after my child. Thank you!”

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow opened its mouth, and the one huge egg rapidly shrank and entered its mouth. With a flap of its wings, it completely disappeared. There was no way to even tell in which direction it had flown.

“Quick, put it into your spiritual space. This place isn’t secure,” said Long Chen.

Meng Qi nodded. This time, the egg easily entered her spiritual space. But Meng Qi didn’t reveal the slightest happiness. Instead, she felt a heavy burden.

Once they put away the egg, the two of them quickly left the nest. But Long Chen still decided to continue searching for more ninth rank Magical Beasts for Meng Qi in order to fill up her spiritual spaces.

On the next day, just as the two of them were searching for a final housepet, Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He had Meng Qi summon the Phantom Storm Leopard.

They had the Phantom Storm Leopard devour them into its stomach and then had it slowly approach the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s nest. Through its eyes, Meng Qi could see everything happening outside and relay it to Long Chen.

Right now, they saw two huge figures shooting through the sky. Their speed was absolutely shocking.

Wherever those two figures went, their pressure caused all Magical Beasts to kneel motionless on the ground. The Phantom Storm Leopard also knelt as it looked at them.

“Tenth rank Magical Beasts? Or Xuan Beasts? Are they the enemies of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow?” Long Chen was shocked.

One of the huge beasts was a tiger with wings, while the other was a two-headed python. They arrived in front of the nest and actually transformed into human form.

One retained its wings, while one still had two heads, appearing extremely bizarre. The winged person looked at the nest, smelled the air, and said, “It’s definitely the aura of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow. It’s been gone for about a day, and there’s also the aura of the human race.”

Meng Qi and Long Chen were both shocked. It actually smelled humans? It then looked around, closed its eyes and sensed, before pointing in a certain direction. “It went that way. We’re chasing!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The two of them flew back into the air and reverted to their huge forms. They were just about to leave, when the winged tiger suddenly looked back at the Phantom Storm Leopard hiding in the dark. Long Chen and Meng Qi’s hair stood on end.

“Two human cultivators?” The winged tiger sent a claw toward the Phantom Storm Leopard, causing Long Chen’s expression to completely change.
