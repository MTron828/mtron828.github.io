Chapter 2826 Declining to Join

“According to true power, our people would at least occupy seventy percent of the human rankings. However, the other side possesses stronger individuals, and those bastards are absolutely despicable. They use people that are higher ranked to squeeze us out. Let me give you an example so that you understand: one of our members managed to get to the fifty-sixth rank. Then they used someone in the twenties to challenge us, resulting in us losing. The challenger fell to rank fifty-sixth, while his own position became empty, leaving it to others to fight for it. As a result, they control many of the spots in the divine rankings. It’s difficult for us to get on the rankings consistently, so right now, we only occupy a tenth of the spots on it,” explained Mu Qingyun angrily.

“Does the God Institute not care about such a giant loophole?” asked Long Chen.

“This loophole has been present for countless years. It’s been abused and reported countless times. But the God Institute has never said anything about it,” sighed Mu Qingyun.

“So are there two factions right now?”

“Yes. They call themselves the Prime Glory Alliance. Their leader is ranked one of the human rankings, Chu Kuang,” said Mu Qingyun.

Long Chen shook his head and scoffed, “Was that name made by an idiot? In my world, anyone named this ended up having a terrible end. What was up with his parents? Was he born in the wild?”

Mu Qingyun laughed and said, “Brother Long really is interesting. Chu Kuang is just like his name. He lives up to the Kuang in his name, so he is wild and arrogant. With his family background, he does whatever he wants. It’s extremely irritating.”

“Does the God Institute not do anything? Is his father the institute head?” asked Long Chen curiously.

“No, that’s not it. Although his background is powerful, in the God Institute, he still has to follow the rules. When I say that he is wild and arrogant, it is still within the limits of the rules. He bullies and suppresses others, but none of the rules of the God Institute can catch him. The Chu family also has connections amongst the higher-ups. Those connections make him unbridled, and his subordinates are the same. They’re all loathsome,” said Mu Qingyun hatefully.

“Chu Kuang is the worst though. When our big sister Qingyun first came, he envied her beauty-” interjected Zhong Ling.

“Zhong Ling, don’t spout nonsense,” scolded Mu Qingyun, blushing slightly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“How is it nonsense? Chu Kuang is the one who tried to pursue you, and then when he failed, he started to threaten you before constantly finding trouble for you. Third brother, tell me, don’t you think that this Chu Kuang is an absolute bastard?” demanded Zhong Ling righteously.

Long Chen nodded. “A great woman can be pursued, but when you fail, you must admit defeat. Did this Chu Kuang read so few books that he doesn’t even understand this principle? His actions are like a child who didn’t get what he wanted. How shameless.”

Just his name and Zhong Ling’s description of what he had done were enough for Long Chen to know what kind of person he was. Although the story was most likely biased, Long Chen’s own judgment was rarely wrong.

“Exactly! That bastard is precisely a bastard, the scum of humanity, a degenerate… But his talent for cultivation is truly high. We can’t beat him…” After cursing a while, Zhong Ling deflated slightly.

After all, he was the existence ranked first one the human rankings. Mu Qingyun had challenged him many times and was always defeated. She also had to endure his dirty mouth during those times.

“Let’s not talk about those things. Today is a celebration for brother Long. Don’t bring up those vexing things. Drink some more wine.” Mu Qingyun took a breath and expelled those thoughts.

Just as they drank more, Zhong Ling suddenly said, “Third brother, you’re so amazing. If your mortal qi is expelled, I feel like you’d have the power to fight Chu Kuang. Why don’t you join our Unfettered Alliance and help us beat the Prime Glory Alliance? Otherwise, even if you’re just a teacher, they’ll still keep making things hard on you. But together, we’ll be able to beat them.”

Everyone’s gaze fell on Long Chen, their eyes full of expectation.

Long Chen smiled. This girl looked so innocent, but she was a little minx. She was actually pulling him in at this time.

However, he shook his head. “My apologies. To tell the truth, fighting on this level really doesn’t interest me in the slightest. It might sound bad, but your fighting to me looks like children playing house. It’s far too childish in my eyes. I have my own important mission here at the High Firmament Academy, and I’m doing my best to increase my power as fast as possible to face future crises. I’ve already failed once. I don’t want to fail a second time. So I truly apologize. I don’t want to be drawn into this game of yours.”

Zhong Ling was instantly disappointed. Even her eyes reddened. She had thought that Long Chen would definitely join.

At this moment, the atmosphere around their table became awkward. Fortunately, there was a master like Mu Qingyun who said, “That’s fine. Even if you don’t join us, we still have the same enemies. There are many areas we can work together in. Furthermore, now that you’re an instructor, with our relationship, we’ll definitely have priority in your lessons.”

“That’s right! Even if you don’t join us, we’ll still be friends. Third brother, when you’re teaching us, don’t hold back!” exclaimed Zhong Ling.

Long Chen smiled. Drinking some wine, he said, “All of you are quite talented. But you’re all greenhouse flowers. It’s not just you. All the disciples that I’ve seen in this academy are the same. Your experiences decide your power. Do you really want to become strong?”

“Of course we want to become strong!” Zhong Ling clenched her little fists.

“Why do you want to become stronger?” asked Long Chen solemnly.

“I don’t want to be bullied.”

“Then how great is your motivation?”

“I’ll do whatever it takes!” said Zhong Ling.

“Alright then.” Long Chen sighed.

“Third brother, what is it? Did I answer wrong?” asked Zhong Ling worriedly.

“Every person has their own answers. There is no right or wrong. Perhaps one day you will experience true pain, then you will understand why you cultivate.” Long Chen looked out the window, pain in his eyes.

When he looked at Zhong Ling and the others, it felt like he was seeing himself in his youth. Perhaps the price for getting stronger was to lose everything that you had.

Three days later, accompanied by Mu Qingyun and the others, Long Chen headed toward the God Institute’s main palace for the official ceremony of his new position.

As soon as he appeared, countless sharp gazes fell toward him. They were like blades trying to stab through him.
