Chapter 4964 Killing Long Qingyun

When Long Ziwei and Long Qingyun appeared on the martial stage, everyone was shocked to see that Long Qingyun was in peak condition, while Long Ziwei’s wounds had yet to heal.

“What’s going on?”

“What is Long Ziwei up to?”

“He should have enough time to heal from the last battle.”

“Did he just give up because he realized he stood no chance?”

Countless confused voices rang through the air. People were unable to comprehend what they were seeing.

Upon seeing Long Ziwei’s condition, Long Qingyun laughed after a moment of surprise.

“What? After becoming his dog, did your master not help you heal?”

Long Qingyun’s words were indeed toxic, each one like a poison arrow aimed at Long Ziwei.

Long Ziwei’s face turned frosty. Previously, he had still been the slightest bit hesitant, but that hesitation now vanished without a trace, thanks to Long Qingyun’s venomous words.

Long Ziwei’s Heavenly Fate Ring emerged behind him, and his Blood Qi ignited. Seeing the flames burning around him, the crowd let out startled cries. Long Ziwei was resorting to the most barbaric method of burning his essence blood for power.

“Die!”

Roaring, Long Ziwei swung his saber with full force, seemingly determined to decide victory or defeat with a single stroke. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Qingyun had initially suspected Long Ziwei of devising a trick to defeat him after their previous encounter. However, Long Ziwei had instead chosen to ignite his essence blood and unleash an all-out attack.

BOOM!

Their weapons clashed with a resounding impact, shaking the entire martial stage. A tiny nick appeared on Long Ziwei’s saber where it met his opponent’s weapon, and he was sent flying backward.

Sighs and murmurs filled the air. Long Ziwei had not fully recovered, and he was also at a disadvantage with his weapon. It seemed that the disparity in their strength was stark, evident from the very first exchange.

“Is this all the power you have? Then you can die!” Long Qingyun sneered and stamped on the ground, chasing after Long Ziwei like a bolt of lightning.

Long Qingyun was indeed powerful. His speed was astonishing, and he launched a decisive strike, leaving Long Ziwei no room to evade or counterattack.

Just as Long Qingyun’s weapon neared Long Ziwei’s chest, Long Ziwei’s saber surged toward Long Qingyun’s head without hesitation.

“What?!”

Gasps erupted among the spectators. Was Long Ziwei giving up on life? He was clearly launching a suicide attack.

Long Qingyun, taken aback by this unexpected move, realized that while his weapon would strike Long Ziwei first, he couldn’t evade the impending deathblow from Long Ziwei.

Forced to react swiftly, Long Qingyun altered his attack trajectory by twisting his saber, aiming to deflect Long Ziwei’s incoming strike.

BOOM!

Their weapons collided—Long Qingyun’s strike was forceful, while Long Ziwei’s was a desperate last-minute block. Long Qingyun grunted as he was pushed back, each step he retreated causing the martial stage to tremble.

At that moment, eight wings sprang from Long Ziwei’s back. Alongside them, a fin-like wing emerged, adorned with blazing runes.

These runes, originating from all nine wings, streamed into Long Ziwei’s arms. As the runes transferred, the wings swiftly withered and faded away.

Seeing that, Long Zaiye shouted, “Qingyun, watch out!”

However, Long Ziwei’s saber already hurtled toward Long Qingyun. This one attack harnessed the full power of his body, representing the pinnacle of his power.

“Devil Dragon Weeps Blood, Nine Wings Slash the Heavens!” Long Ziwei bellowed, unleashing his saber with unbridled ferocity and determination.

In the midst of flying back, Long Qingyun was horrified. He had never seen such a terrifying attack before. With a roar, he concentrated all his power into his saber.

BOOM!

The martial stage sank. People saw Long Ziwei’s saber explode, transforming into millions of fragments flying through the air. Countless runes exploded within the twisting space.

A weapon came flying out of that twisting space, spinning wildly before falling into a corner of the martial stage with a thud.

“That’s...”

Pupils shrank. That was Long Qingyun’s divine weapon. It had flown out without its master.

Long Ziwei slowly emerged, covered in blood and swaying, as if on the verge of collapse. His aura was also unstable.

The surroundings fell into deathly silence as the twisting space gradually settled. Long Qingyun never reappeared; only a dispersing cloud of blood mist remained.

“You bastard! How dare you be so heavy-handed?!” A furious roar split the silence. Like a phantom, a figure materialized on the martial stage. He seized Long Ziwei by the throat, lifting him effortlessly into the air.

This figure was none other than Long Zaiye, who was consumed by raging killing intent. Long Qingyun was his great-great-great-grandson, which was why Long Zaiye was willing to sacrifice his heaven vein power to increase Long Qingyun’s realm. His goal had been to test out Long Chen, but unexpectedly, Long Qingyun was slain by Long Ziwei.

In a state of complete fury, Long Zaiye was determined to kill Long Ziwei to avenge Long Qingyun. Long Ziwei was already completely powerless to resist. Just as Long Zaiye was about to kill him, an uproar exploded in the crowd.

Suddenly, Long Zaiye felt a cold sensation at the back of his head. A sinister black saber was pressed against his skull.

“If you dare to kill him, I’ll reunite you with Long Qingyun!” Long Chen’s voice was icy, like that of a death god from hell.

The spectators gasped in shock, their hands covering their mouths in disbelief. When Long Zaiye shot after Long Ziwei, they barely managed to see his movements. Yet, none of them had seen how Long Chen appeared behind Long Zaiye.

“Boss, kill him! Even if it costs me my life, it’s worth it!” Long Ziwei shouted, his life now hanging in the balance, yet he displayed no hint of fear.

Everyone remained frozen, too shocked and frightened to even react. The scene unfolding before them was beyond anything they had ever imagined.

“Do you think you can kill me?” sneered Long Zaiye.

“Why don’t you try to find out?” asked Long Chen lightly.

Long Zaiye didn’t dare to move rashly, and Long Chen remained still. Everyone was frozen in place, the tension palpable.

“Long Chen, aren’t you going too far?” A voice broke the silence.

A middle-aged man with a sword on his back walked in. His mere presence caused a ripple of shock among the Long clan’s disciples.

“The first Heavenly Saint!”
