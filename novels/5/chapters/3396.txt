Chapter 3385 Waited a Long Time For You

Long Chen sat on the shoulder of the leader of the Nether Blood Giants. They sped across the land. When they encountered the black sea, they simply ran across the surface of the water without a care.

“Are you not afraid of the fiend spirits beneath the sea?” asked Long Chen curiously.

“They don’t dare to bite us. With the Heavenly King behind us, as long as we don’t attack them, they won’t provoke us,” said the leader with a smile. They were all delighted that Long Chen was coming with them. They were very courteous to him.

“Is your Heavenly King really so powerful?” asked Long Chen, feeling surprised. It seemed that the Heavenly King was even more frightening than he had anticipated.

The leader proudly said, “The Heavenly King is from a noble desolate species, and he possesses an undying indestructible body. He was sealed in a Netherpassage world in his youth precisely because he couldn’t even be killed. They could only use this method to seal him forever. But they didn’t expect that the Heavenly King’s power would continue to grow over time. However, being trapped in the Netherpassage world, he couldn’t unleash his power. Then you lifted the seal. Although it was just one of the 108,000 seals on him, he finally had a way to unleash his power. Targeting that broken seal, he charged out of his prison. The Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race can be said to be the emperor race of our Nether race. Now we are regrouping, preparing to fight against the Underworld race. You’ve also seen how we won’t leave those of the Underworld race alive.”

Hearing that, Long Chen understood why they would follow the so-called Heavenly King. It seemed that they were all on the same side.

Ming Cangyue had told him that the Underworld and Nether races were constantly at odds with each other. There was no way to resolve the enmity between the two sides.

Perhaps it was precisely due to this that she had warned him not to join the Heavenly King’s forces. That was to avoid being drawn into the war between the two sides.

The Nether race and the Underworld race fought their own battle, while the Nethergod race didn’t interfere. It had been so for countless years. Ming Cangyue was profoundly aware of just how terrifying the foundations of those two races were.

As they rushed across the land, Long Chen spotted many cities. In some of those cities, experts noticed them running by and bowed to them in greeting. Moreover, those experts weren’t afraid. They didn’t even activate the grand formation.

However, when they spotted Long Chen sitting on the shoulder of the leader of the Nether Blood Giants, those experts were all shocked. 

Long Chen saw countless ancient cities on the way, but he saw far more areas of wilderness.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Long Chen asked about it, the leader told him that the region they were in was considered wilderness.

It was said that a terrifying battle had been fought in ancient times, and it had shattered the laws of the Heavenly Daos in the Netherworld. No lifeforms appeared in that region for millions and millions of years.

It was only in the past few hundred years that the Netherworld’s self-recovery ability started to return those crumbled laws back to their previous state. Hence, this wilderness could now be cleared and reclaimed.

Even so, true experts didn’t care about this wilderness. In the process of the Heavenly Daos repairing themselves, the laws of the Netherworld in this region were no longer as complete. 

Moreover, just like clearing wilderness, it took time and energy to take over these regions. Only rogue cultivators with no foundations would run over here to gnaw on what little bones remained. As for true experts, they were at the core, fighting for territory. The core region’s laws were complete and more suitable for cultivation.

Whether it was the Nethergod race, or the Underworld and Nether races, unless they had something to do in this place, they wouldn’t run over to the wilderness.

As for the Nether Blood Giants, they had come so far because they were wiping out the Underworld race. They wanted to create a world devoid of their existence. This was the mission that the Heavenly King had given them. The Heavenly King wanted to create a holy place for those that were hunted down and persecuted by the Underworld race, a place for them to peacefully rest.

This particular group was nothing more than one branch of millions of squads. The other squads were still working in other regions. The core region had essentially been cleaned up, and now they were simply dealing with leftovers at the edges here.

After rushing for a full day, Long Chen saw a giant city up ahead. Here, he felt like he had entered the world of giants. He was as tiny as an ant.

This giant city was packed with Nether Blood Giants. After entering the city, an elder of their race with a golden crown quickly came out.

Despite being mentally prepared, Long Chen’s heart still skipped a beat. This person’s aura was actually somewhat similar to Enpuda. It went without saying that he was also an expert on the level of a World King.

Moreover, this expert actually greeted Long Chen in a very friendly manner. Through his introduction, Long Chen learned that he was the leader of this Nether Blood Giant tribe.

That shocked Long Chen. Just the tribe leader of a random branch was already on the level of a World King? That was astonishing.

It was no wonder that the three-eyed fellow that appeared in the Chu family’s territory had told Long Chen to come to the Netherworld with him and join the side of the Heavenly King.

This World King was also extremely reverent toward the Heavenly King. From this, it could be seen just how high the Heavenly King’s position was.

After saying a few courteous words, that tribe leader gave some orders, and over ten people came to escort Long Chen.

Those people all had auras even more terrifying than the leader of Nether Blood Giants that had found Long Chen. From their tone, it seemed that they were afraid of some accident occurring, so they came to protect him.

This world had essentially been taken over by the Nether race, but they were still so cautious. It could be seen just how important they viewed Long Chen to be.

This new group then set out of the city. The black sea appeared before them again, stretching far beyond the horizon. But this time, they didn’t directly run across and obediently crossed with a giant ship.

When Long Chen asked about this, he was told that this sea region was considered a special domain. There was a terrifying existence beneath it. In order to express their reverence toward it, they didn’t randomly run across this region. They used ships.

On the way, Long Chen found that the world here was truly different from Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s territories. Although Long Chen didn’t understand the laws of the Netherworld, he could sense that the aura of the Netherworld had increased in density by dozens of times.

Based on that, he hypothesized that this place could be considered the core of a star-field. It was no wonder that the place Leng Yueyan was at was considered wilderness and not cared about by true experts. The difference was truly stark.

The ship had no sail or runes supporting it. They crossed the sea by relying on the paddling of two Nether Blood Giants. But they were like an arrow shot from a bow, shooting across the sea even faster than their speed before.

They spent two whole days paddling before seeing the other shore. Once they were on land, the Nether Blood Giants made hand seals. After that, runes glowed on their bodies, and they suddenly shrank until they were only slightly taller than Long Chen.

However, once they shrank, the power of their Blood Qi was mostly sealed. This form was most likely not suited to combat.

They escorted Long Chen to a place where countless lifeforms were gathered. The lifeforms stretched far beyond their vision. But at the front of this group was a tall muscular man with overflowing Blood Qi and a bald head.

“Long Chen, I’ve waited a long time for you.”

The large man opened his mouth. As soon as he spoke, space quivered as if the entire star-field reverberated with his voice. He was the ruler of this world, the one who looked down on all others. His words could not be defied.
