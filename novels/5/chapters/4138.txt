Chapter 4127: Leaked Information

“What is it?” Long Chen also sensed something wrong.

“Boss, did you not receive word from the Huayun Trading Company?” asked Xia Chen.

“Damn, I’m not wearing it!” Only then did Long Chen remember. Since they were cut off from the rest of the world in the Silver Moon World, he had placed the communication tablet in the primal chaos space.

In the Linglong World, he naturally wasn’t wearing it then, as he didn’t want it to be broken. But with this reminder, he immediately took it out.

As soon as he did, the tablet flashed three times. The light was red, showing that it was urgent.

“So that’s the case. The information from the Violet Flame Heaven has reached the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, so the matter of the Heaven Earth Cauldron has been leaked. The Soaring Dragon Company has also spread the information that I have the Earth Cauldron far and wide in order to get me killed.” Long Chen instantly understood.

No wonder so many people were staring at him. They wanted to kill him for his treasures.

However, with the Sage King Convention about to start, the major powers didn’t dare to make any large moves, afraid of drawing heavenly retribution. Otherwise, Long Chen would have long since been attacked.

The main reason they didn’t attack yet was because they didn’t have a good opportunity. If Long Chen wasn’t in the city, perhaps some people would no longer hold back.

“Gather our brothers. We’ll have to stick together for now,” said Long Chen.

Xia Chen nodded and sent messages to call Guo Ran and the others back. After all, the Heaven Earth Cauldron was one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, an existence that drove countless people mad. Now that the news had leaked, they would have to be a bit more careful.

However, based on the current situation, it seemed that the information was not publicly available yet, as only a small portion of the people in the crowd were staring at Long Chen.

Based on Long Chen’s estimation, the ones observing him must be from forces with high level information networks, possibly even ties with the Soaring Dragon Company, so they were the first to learn of this.

Even so, Long Chen had long since been prepared for this. After all, paper could not contain fire—this information was bound to surface sooner or later. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, now that this day had come, Long Chen truly did feel a bit apprehensive. After all, the Heaven Earth Cauldron would draw the attention of countless powerful experts, causing him to not have any peaceful days in the future.

They stayed for two days outside the border of the Sage King Star-Field. But after going through seven cities, they formally entered the Sage King Star-Field.

This star-field was named after the Sage King Convention, and the winner of every convention would be crowned Sage King.

The heavenly genius crowned Sage King would be blessed by the karmic luck of the nine heavens and ten lands. With it, becoming an Eternal expert was nothing more than a matter of time because they would never encounter any bottleneck before the Eternal realm.

It could be said that the person to gain the title of Sage King would be able to soar through the heavens. However, for the absolute majority, it was nothing more than an unattainable dream. After all, the Sage King Convention would draw out all the heavenly geniuses of the nine heavens and ten lands.

For those heavenly geniuses, the reason they had their accomplishments was thirty percent talent and hard work, sixty percent the support of their backers, and ten percent luck. Of course, reincarnating within a powerful faction was also part of one’s power.

For those enormous powers, compared to the addition of one Eternal expert, it was the karmic luck that the Sage King Convention brought that was important.

Although an Eternal expert could maintain a family’s prosperity, it was actually inferior to the karmic luck that would support the family.

After all, a supreme power had countless people inside of it, and it had countless heavenly geniuses, all with immense power and talent. They all had a hope of becoming Eternal experts.

As for something like karmic luck, it could not simply be created. Thus, countless sects and families would send their strongest heavenly geniuses to the Sage King Convention to fight for the title of Sage King. This was a matter that related to the future of any race, so no one treated it lightly.

When Long Chen and the others arrived at the Sage King Star-Field, they found that they couldn’t be counted as having arrived early. After all, many ancient cities were already full of people.

Experts were as common as dogs here, and heavenly geniuses strolled around in every street. Even some of the abandoned cities were flourishing once more with the opening of the Sage King Convention.

Long Chen arrived in a human settlement called Night Rain City, and it was already occupied by countless other races.

As soon as he stepped out of the transportation formation, he saw the devil race, Blood race, Spirit race, Magic race, demon race, and dozens of other races, with the majority in the Immortal King realm. They had clearly all come for the Sage King Convention.

“Long Chen, if you’re smart, you’ll hand over the Heaven Earth Cauldron right now, or you will definitely die!” They had yet to even walk off of the transportation formation when a large man blocked their path.

This large fellow had horns on his head and bone spurs coming out of his back. They didn’t recognize what race he was from, but his Blood Qi was shocking and his copper eyes were filled with brutality.

His shout was like a bell, instantly drawing the attention of countless people.

“What did he say?”

“The Heaven Earth Cauldron?”

“What is the Heaven Earth Cauldron?”

“Are they talking about the Heaven Earth Cauldron that is one of the ten great primal chaos divine items?”

“What kind of joke is that? That’s just a story. There is no actual Heaven Earth Cauldron.

“Even if it really existed, how could it be in the hands of an Immortal King? Is this fellow crazy?”

This shout bewildered countless people, so it was followed by many questioning whispers. Also, the majority of these people did not recognize Long Chen and had not heard anything about the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

“Where did this idiot come from? If you don’t want to die, scram!” Long Chen frowned. This fellow had to have something wrong with his brain.

Everyone else who knew of this information hadn’t made a move. Even if they wanted to kill him for the Earth Cauldron, they would do it secretly.

On the other hand, this person shouted it as if afraid others wouldn’t know he was killing people for their treasures. Was he an idiot?

“Hmph, you don’t deny it! Then it must be true! The information that I spent three hundred world king crystals on was worth it. Brat, I’ll give you two options right now. Hand over the Heaven Earth Cauldron or die!” announced the large man.

“He paid three hundred world king crystals?!”

Countless people gasped upon hearing this. This fellow’s head must have rotted. What information was worth so much money? That was clearly a scam!

Long Chen nodded. He was now sure that this person was an idiot. A normal person wouldn’t openly rob him.

“What race are you from?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“What, you want to know my background?” he sneered.

Long Chen shook his head. “No. The main thing is to make sure your race knows where to retrieve your corpse.”

After Long Chen said this, a Dragonblood warrior behind him unsheathed his sword and hacked it down at the large man like a bolt of lightning.
