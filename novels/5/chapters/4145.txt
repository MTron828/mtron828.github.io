Chapter 4134 Guo Ran vs. Triple Supreme

“Courting death!”

The leader of the devil experts was in the midst of piously kowtowing to the Great Desolate Winged Devil and didn’t like to be disturbed. So, he was taken aback by Long Chen’s rudeness.

“Master, there’s no need for you to be angry. I’ll kill this group of ignorant humans for you.” Another devil expert stood and turned to Long Chen.

Suddenly, he moved. But at the same instant, a golden arrow shot over.

BOOM!

That devil expert grunted and tumbled back, a golden arrow in his grasp. He then stabbed it into the ground to stabilize himself, leaving a white line on the ground with sparks flying everywhere. Its ear-piercing sound made people wince.

“A Triple Supreme!”

Long Chen and the others were startled to see three-colored divine radiance flowing around that person’s body. His essence, qi, and spirit had merged into one, a sign that he was a true Supreme.

Guo Ran also jumped in shock. He had thought that his arrow would have been able to easily kill this person, but unexpectedly, the latter was so powerful.

The most shocking thing though was that this powerful Triple Supreme actually called that other person ‘master’. This fellow’s origins were probably absolutely shocking.

“Long Chen, be careful. That fellow is very likely an expert of the legendary Gold Horn Blood Devil race,” transmitted Xu Changchuan.

Hearing this, Long Chen examined these devil experts more closely. Their outer appearance was similar to humans, save for the presence of a bone shell on their backs, reminiscent of a tortoise's carapace, and a strange single horn protruding from the tops of their heads.

Long Chen had seen devil races and beast races. Usually, their horns always pointed toward the heavens, but these devil experts’ horns pointed straight forward, and they only had one horn each with a spiral pattern on it like a conch’s shell.

Furthermore, their horns were not golden but white, looking almost like ornaments. So, it was unclear why they were called the Gold Horn Blood Devil race.

The devil expert who had been blown back by Guo Ran’s arrow stood up slowly, showing a partially ground-down golden arrow in his hand.

Apparently, the ground here was even harder than immortal metal, and Guo Ran’s arrow had been ground down by it, causing him to jump.

“Damn human race, you really are despicable. A sneak attack? Die!” The devil expert suddenly unleashed his Blood Qi, charging at Guo Ran like a bolt of lightning.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Tch, then I’ll show you an open attack!” Guo Ran sneered and extended his hand, summoning a bow with thousands of multicolored runes flowing on top of it. It was a weapon that Long Chen and the others had never seen before.

It had to be known that Guo Ran had always been a user of crossbows, with no prior history of using bows. Thus, no one had expected him to secretly create a bow.

The bow automatically drew itself back, and a golden arrow appeared in the air, shooting out almost as soon as the bow appeared. It was incomparably fast.

Facing it, the Gold Horn Blood Devil race’s Supreme took out a blood-red sword and swung it at Guo Ran’s arrow.

BOOM!

An intense explosion caused huge waves of flames to spread around. This time, Guo Ran had shot an exploding arrow, and the Gold Horn Blood Devil expert was sent flying back by it.

Suddenly, Guo Ran’s bow drew back once more. But this time, Long Chen and the others saw it clearly. At some point, a small metal hand had appeared out of Guo Ran’s chest.

It was this metal hand that pulled back the bowstring, so Guo Ran only needed to extend his own arm and that would automatically draw back the bowstring.

Furthermore, when he extended his arm straight like that, his entire arm became covered in a marked scale. It seemed that he was measuring something before shooting.

With this mechanism, Guo Ran possessed the ability to launch an arrow in a mere fraction of the time it took to blink—an astonishing speed that left observers unable to see the arrow clearly.

The Gold Horn Blood Devil expert had just been blown back and yet to recover when Guo Ran’s second arrow struck him. Again, he was sent tumbling back.

Guo Ran slowly raised his bow and blew on it lightly. After that, he spun the bow in his hand confidently and put it away.

Guo Ran had gained the upper hand with these two exchanges. If he were to relentlessly pursue that Supreme without giving him any chance to breathe, it might not guarantee an absolute kill, but he would certainly inflict further misery and torment upon that Supreme.

In truth, Guo Ran did want to chase, but he was too aggrieved by the cost. This bow was one of his new inventions and was still a prototype. If he used it too much, it might get damaged.

Also, those arrows were meticulously forged and required a great deal of effort to make, yet he might not be able to kill his enemy with just them. Therefore, instead of wasting so much energy and effort, executing a suave retreat after showcasing his prowess was his King Dao.

At this moment, along with a devilish roar, devil qi erupted out of the devil expert’s body, and his eyes blazed with killing intent. He was about to charge at Guo Ran when he saw that Guo Ran had put away his bow and was ignoring him, causing him to quiver with rage. Now, he didn’t know whether he should attack him or stop.

Guo Ran was clearly saying that the winner had been determined, so there was no need to keep fighting. To put it frankly, he was saying that this devil expert wasn’t a match for him.

So, if the devil expert were to attack again, it would be as if he was refusing to accept his defeat honorably. And if he couldn’t win in a convincing way, it would definitely lose more face for the Gold Horn Blood Devil race.

“Come back. The human race is capable of doing shameful things, and with the Devil Saint’s pressure here, your power is limited. He only relied on some mechanisms that weren’t affected by the pressure. Outside of this place, his body of broken metal won’t last three exchanges against you,” said their leader.

Guo Ran had truly managed to shock everyone by forcing back this Supreme heavenly genius with two arrows. However, this explanation caused all the surrounding experts to realize the truth. It seemed that this armored oddity had only relied on cheap tricks.

“Tch, a loss is a loss. Are you trying to find excuses for yourselves? The Gold Horn Blood Devil race really is shameful,” sneered Guo Ran.

Although it was true that the pressure here didn’t affect Guo Ran that much, being exposed like this irritated him.

His sneer enraged this group of devil experts. However, Guo Ran wasn’t afraid. After all, the human race and the devil race were already opposing forces, and the enmity of countless years had been engraved into the depths of their soul. So, who cared about their little anger?

“Inferior human race, leave this place. The Great Desolate Devil Saint doesn’t need your reverence. If you take another step, it will be a declaration of war against my devil race,” shouted their leader.

They could tell that Long Chen and the others weren't so easy to provoke. However, as this corpse was a senior of their devil race, they did not wish others to get close to it, especially not anyone from the human race.

“Then a declaration of war it is.”

Long Chen indifferently stepped forward, causing the devil experts’ eyes to instantly turn scarlet.
