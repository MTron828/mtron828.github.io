Chapter 4317: Shocking Wealth

Without hesitation, Long Chen carried the two of them and flew for a whole day and night at top speed. This humanless world was truly enormous. With Long Chen’s top speed, he had crossed an unimaginable distance after an entire day and night flying, but they hadn’t reached their destination yet.

“We’re close! But let’s rest first. The closer we get, the more we have to stay calm,” said Long Chen.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen nodded, both feeling incredibly excited as they wanted to immediately start going through the treasures. Their hearts were pounding rapidly, so they had to cool off first.

Xia Chen then set up a formation, and they rested for two days. After all, flying at full speed for a day and night had worn Long Chen out.

Once Long Chen had mostly recovered, the three of them slowly snuck their way toward their target, which ended up being an unremarkable mountain valley that was badly damaged. It was most likely the ruins of another sect.

Xia Chen used a formation to keep an eye on the surroundings. After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, they didn’t notice anything off, so they slowly snuck their way underground.

As expected, there were fluctuations coming from deep below, and there was also some kind of formation. The three of them paused for a moment just to be safe before continuing onward.

The three of them kept a close eye on the surroundings as they went down. If they felt the slightest disturbance, they would instantly retreat.

Once they were a thousand miles underground, they finally found an underground cavern. However, this was no historical relic… but a tomb.

With Xia Chen present, they easily opened the gate to the tomb.

“This isn’t actually a tomb. Tombs aren’t arranged this way,” said Guo Ran.

After following Mo Nian once, he and Xia Chen had a certain understanding of tombs. This place’s fengshui arrangement was completely different from that of tombs.

“The formation here is not a defensive one. It is an ordinary formation used for blocking the erosion of time. Furthermore, the person to set it up did it very sloppily,” said Xia Chen curiously.

Even after this, the three of them were still very careful. They slowly went deeper into the cavern and saw a gate up ahead.

As they passed through this gate, even Long Chen was constantly swallowing from nervousness.

Beyond the gate, they found a hall almost packed full of primal chaos spirit stones. Upon seeing this, Long Chen’s head buzzed and his mind went blank.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were no better. Xia Chen’s formation disc almost clattered to the ground.

“Am I dreaming?” Guo Ran pinched his own face. It was only when he got a large bruise that he believed it wasn’t a dream.

There was a mountain of primal chaos spirit stones. However, they were mixed, with the high grade, middle grade, and low grade all together.

“Wait, there’s more!” Xia Chen barely managed to draw his eyes away from the mountain of spirit stones. He found that there was another room behind this one.

The three of them then rushed over to the next room, only to find that it was packed with all kinds of divine materials.

“Heavens! We are damn rich now!” Guo Ran almost wept this time.

These divine materials had been refined to their utmost purity, and in comparison, the materials that the three of them had gathered so far were trash. After all, these divine materials could be directly turned into divine weapons without any further refinement.

“There’s still more!”

The three of them squeezed past the divine materials to find a room with foot-long white spheres of light within it.

Within these radiant spheres lay white bones that were etched with densely packed characters. Surprisingly, these were all bone books, and they represented a genuine treasure trove of knowledge.

These were bone books carved with the bones of Eternal lifeforms. And in order to maintain their divine nature, they were sealed in divine stone.

Although Long Chen had also obtained some secret tomes, with some bone books amongst them, he had never seen bone books sealed in divine stone before. Moreover, there were thousands of pieces of divine stone scattered throughout this room like tiny moons.

“There’s someone there!”

All of a sudden, Long Chen’s expression changed. The Seven Peak Sword then appeared in his hand, and he shot in a certain direction.

There was a very well-concealed figure there, giving off no aura at all. If Long Chen hadn’t noticed the corner of his sleeve, he wouldn’t have sensed the latter’s presence at all.

However, Long Chen’s expression abruptly changed just as his sword was about to reach the figure, and he withdrew his attack with full power. A qi wave then blew away the surrounding divine stones, revealing an elderly figure.

The individual was a human dressed in somber gray robes. His eyes appeared devoid of life, and they seemed to contain an enduring sense of regret and reluctance. It was, in fact, a lifeless corpse.

“He’s dead?”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran jumped in shock. They then walked over to the corpse carefully, bewildered.

“This is an Eternal expert, and he’s been dead for countless years,” said Long Chen.

“But there’s no wound,” said Xia Chen.

“He killed himself.”

“Suicide?!”

Long Chen slowly reached out and touched the corpse. The corpse was holding a white bone.

Long Chen then grabbed the bone and pulled lightly, extracting it from the corpse’s hold.

Following that, Long Chen deciphered the characters written on it: “They’re all dead, and my sins cannot be forgiven. The human race met its demise through its own hands. Greed, the greatest weakness of the human race. In the end, I am left with nothing. How pathetic… how lamentable… how laughable.”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were dumbfounded. “Who is this person?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“He’s probably one of the traitors. He betrayed the human race for everything in this treasury and helped the other races annihilate his own. He must have had some agreement with the other races, but the latter didn’t abide by it, slaughtering the entire human race. These traitors made this place into the humanless world. Pathetic, lamentable, laughable… What an apt assessment. It seems that he is laughing at himself. They destroyed themselves due to their greed,” sighed Long Chen.

“Are they really so stupid? Why would they collude with other races?” Xia Chen was speechless.

“We can just make a brazen assumption. In that era, the Ten Thousand Spirit World’s people were unified, and the ten thousand races pledged allegiance to the human race. When the human race had no other enemies, what would they do?” asked Long Chen.

“Fight amongst themselves,” answered Xia Chen without hesitation.

“If they were fighting amongst themselves, there had to be at least two sides. If the two factions were equally powerful, then whoever joined with the other races would have a huge advantage. Following that, the human race fought amongst themselves to the point of being gravely wounded, and the other races joined forces to wipe them out in one go, taking command of this world. We don’t have any proof, but based on what we’ve seen, this scenario should be quite close to what happened. Two human factions: one was destroyed, and traitors like this one gathered so many treasures as a result. They definitely betrayed the human race because of greed, so his final words really were accurate,” said Long Chen.

“This person probably fled here and didn’t dare to leave. Filled with remorse and shame, he killed himself. Ugh, how pitiful!” Xia Chen also couldn’t help sighing.

“Well, at least, he kept these treasures safe,” said Guo Ran scornfully. He didn’t feel much emotion for this person and the story. In his eyes, there were only the treasures.

The three of them continued to check the surroundings. Other than this one corpse, there was nothing else, so they directly took all the treasures and returned to the surface. After Xia Chen activated a formation disc, they vanished without a trace.
