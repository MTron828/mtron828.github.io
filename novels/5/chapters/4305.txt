Chapter 4294 Wasted Effort

The patriarch’s expression changed, but he didn’t reply.0

Long Zhantian lightly said, “Back then, I told you that you were harming yourselves with your foolishness. My son Long Chen has taken back what is his, so it’s time to return what is mine as well.”0

“Chen-er, help me out!”0

Long Zhantian pressed a finger to Long Chen’s forehead, and a weak seven-color Supreme Blood aura entered his mind-sea.0

Long Chen instantly sensed something and teleported away.0

BOOM!0

An underground room in the Long clan was blown open, revealing thousands of crystal bottles. These crystal bottles were all full of seven-color blood, their seven-color light illuminating the Arrogant Dragon Prefecture.0

All of this came from Long Zhantian. Moreover, every crystal bottle had powerful runes carved on them, functioning as miniature formations that absorbed the primal chaos qi of heaven and earth to nourish the blood within.0

When the patriarch saw that blood, his gaze instantly changed to one of fury and resentment. It had to be known that after extracting the Supreme Blood, the Long clan had put in an immense investment in order to create those primal chaos spirit gathering formations. 0

Furthermore, they ended up owing a great deal of debt as they gathered primal chaos qi to nourish this blood. Their goal was to nourish this Supreme Blood until they could become seeds. Now, these seeds had already started to flourish. By planting these Supreme Blood seeds into their most outstanding geniuses, they would be able to create an army of heavenly geniuses possessing seven-color Supreme blood.6

If these seven-color Supreme Blood seeds managed to germinate within other people’s bodies, who knew what kind of unimaginable height they could grow to?0

It could be said that the Long clan was an empty shell at this time. In order to grow the blood seeds, they invested a shocking amount and almost went bankrupt after doing so. After all, this was related to the future of the Long clan. With the nourishing of this seven-color Supreme Blood and Long Aotian, the Long clan was now heavily in debt. 0

When Long Aotian was crippled, some people even suggested giving him the matured blood seeds to absorb. However, others were opposed to it. Even if Long Aotian did come to possess this seven-color Supreme Blood, so what? His Spirit Bone and Spirit Root were already gone, so his future would still be extremely limited. He would be inferior to even ordinary heavenly geniuses.0

Furthermore, who knew just how many blood seeds would be required for Long Aotian to regain control of seven-color Supreme Blood? Based on Long Aotian’s previous power, to fully recover would require at least hundreds of these blood seeds, and that was a conservative estimate.0

Hundreds of blood seeds could produce hundreds of peak experts. Sacrificing that for a single Long Aotian when there was no guarantee of success? It was not worth it.0

This also gave the Long clan another headache. These blood seeds had to be given to their top geniuses, as that would be spending their money efficiently. However, their top geniuses had been nearly annihilated by Long Chen during the Sage King Convention, and using these blood seeds on second-rate disciples would be a waste of their investment. Thus, the only option would be to wait for their next batch of disciples to grow up. 0

However, this world was currently filled with primal chaos qi, and other forces were rapidly growing thanks to this new influx of energy. If the Long clan waited for the next generation to grow up, they would completely miss this chance.0

If they simply waited like that, they would be left behind as others rapidly grew. The Long clan was still busy racking their brains for solutions, but none seemed to be good enough.0

Now, Long Chen had come while they were still thinking of a solution, forcing them to hand over Long Zhantian and even these blood seeds. With this, all their plans turned to ash, and all their investments were taken. Everything had been a wasted effort.0

Upon looking at those floating crystal bottles, the expressions of the Long clan’s experts twisted. They felt regret and unwillingness. They had the urge to charge forward and grab them, but they didn’t dare to.0

“Thank you, Long clan, for looking after my essence blood.”1

Long Zhantian waved his hand, and those crystal bottles instantly vanished, startling Long Chen. Those crystal bottles had formations carved into them, while his father was only in the Divine Flame realm. However, he was actually capable of easily collecting them.0

Long Chen was pleasantly surprised by this discovery. It seemed that his father was stronger than he had expected. Even in his terrible condition, he still had some ability to resist.0

“I came from the Long clan and was almost destroyed by the Long clan. My son was about to destroy the Long clan, but I stopped it. Taking everything into consideration, we can call it even. Starting now, us father and son will no longer have the slightest connection to the Long clan. If the Long clan dares to harm us once more, it will be the day of your destruction,” said Long Zhantian coldly, looking at Long Tianyao.0

Only then did Long Chen understand that his father cared even more about inheritances than him. Even after the Long clan had treated him like this, he was unwilling to destroy them. If it was up to Long Chen instead, the Long clan would have been wiped out.0

The patriarch didn’t say a word. The Long clan had indeed suffered a devastating loss. All their endeavors had amounted to nothing, and their aspirations had crumbled into dust.0

However, Long Chen was still full of hatred for the Long clan and wanted to tear them apart. Yet, out of respect for his father's wishes, he reluctantly agreed.13

Long Chen had examined the blood seeds in those crystal bottles. After being nourished by primal chaos qi, every single one of them was extremely powerful.0

If his father were to absorb them all, it would be equivalent to him starting to absorb primal chaos qi right from the Divine Flame realm. His foundation would be far more solid than anyone else in this era. He would basically have the treatment of the heavenly geniuses from the primal chaos era, so this could be considered profiting from disaster.0

This seven-color Supreme Blood was essentially undergoing cultivation with the support of the formation. In other words, it would be like Long Zhantian had thousands of clones cultivating for him, and his cultivation base would definitely soar after absorbing them. It would be like he had cultivated for thousands of years. As for what realm he would reach in the end, it was impossible to tell. But it would probably be at least the Heaven Venerate realm. 2

After thinking of that, Long Chen felt much better inside. The heavens had finally opened their eyes, and his father’s years of suffering weren’t in vain.0Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t be too pleased. The gate has been opened, and the Long clan is ultimately an Eternal clan, part of the Heavenly Divinity race. Even a dying camel is stronger than a horse. When the time comes, don’t come begging the Long clan for help, otherwise…!” shouted an elder of the Long clan.1

“Don’t worry, we will never ask the Long clan for anything. Let us separate here. Everyone is on their own now. Chen-er, let’s go.”0

After saying that, Long Zhantian patted Long Chen’s shoulder and smiled. The two of them then burst into laughter at the same time and started walking away together.0

Only then did the palace master put away the High Firmament Divine Sword, leaving along with them. The Long clan was now in ruins. Seeing the scene around them, everyone was silent and some people were crying.0

“What are you crying about?! I’m not dead yet!” shouted the patriarch furiously.0

“Reporting! Patriarch, Long Aotian has passed out! Please save him!” A maid suddenly came running over. She was in charge of looking after Long Aotian.0

“Save him?! Toss him into the mountains to feed the wild dogs!” roared the patriarch.8

“What?!” The maid looked at him in disbelief.0

The patriarch and the other experts ignored her and began to vanish one by one, leaving that panicked maid standing there helplessly.
