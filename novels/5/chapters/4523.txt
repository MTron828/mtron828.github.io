Chapter 4512 Earth Energy

Although the Earth Cauldron taught Long Chen a simple technique, just condensing this rune took all of his power.

This was the epitome of complexity returning to simplicity—the more profound the technique, the more simple it was. When the rune on Long Chen’s palm merged with the one on the Earth Cauldron, it formed an endless cycle of energy. Seeing this scene, how could Long Chen not understand?𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This was the Earth Cauldron, one half of the Heaven Earth Cauldron that represented the softer aspect, while the Heaven Cauldron embodied the supreme Yang existence. At this moment, the rune on Long Chen’s arm controlled all of his wild and explosive power.

This power encompassed his bloodline power, the astral energy of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, and even the core energies of Huo Linger and Lei Linger. All these powers could be considered supreme Yang energies, and this rune had the ability to draw all of them out. If he could detonate all of them at once, the resulting force could directly slay Saints. Thinking of this, Long Chen saw a new world before him.

However, the rune on Long Chen’s hand was not under his control, as if there was a mysterious energy communing with it.

Long Chen thought that the Earth Cauldron was controlling it, so he didn’t really take note of this. Little did he know that another kind of energy was silently awakening inside of him.

When this supreme Yang power erupted from Long Chen, the Earth Cauldron’s supreme Yin energy merged with it to form a powerful spatial domain.

As this domain enveloped the blood-colored spirit mushroom, Long Chen shook as he actually felt a resonance with the mushroom.

“No wonder it is called the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom. It is a priceless treasure. Through it, one can fathom the universal power of heaven and earth,” remarked Long Chen.

Endless runes surrounded the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom, embodying the connection between Yin and Yang, gentleness and hardness. It was a manifestation of a Grand Dao. If someone grasped its profundities, they could turn into an unimaginable existence.

These profundities were of paramount importance not only in cultivation but also in all other aspects of life, whether it was refining pills or forging items.

Under the Earth Cauldron’s control, the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom slowly rose. Long Chen was shocked to see that despite being three feet tall, it had two roots that extended for hundreds of miles.

Those two roots also bore countless root branches, thinner than hair. Seeing this, Long Chen blessed his fortune that the Earth Cauldron was here. Had he dug it out with a shovel, it would have instantly died. Long Chen carefully sent it into the primal chaos space.

When it left the soil, its blood color rapidly faded, causing Long Chen to jump.

“Don’t worry. It is still young and will die as soon as it leaves its spirit land. But we have enough time before that happens,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen didn’t dare to tarry and hastily found an empty place for it in the primal chaos space. After digging a deep hole, he carefully placed the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom inside.

Once it took root in the primal chaos space’s soil, its blood color quickly returned, and the Heaven Earth Qi around it also came back. Actually, its aura was even stronger than before, proving that this place was even more suitable for it.

Long Chen finally sighed with relief. He found that at some point, his back had started sweating.

“Is there a need to be so nervous?” asked the Earth Cauldron with a teasing tone.

Long Chen smiled bitterly. “Senior, you don’t know this thing about me. Ever since I set foot into the cultivation world, I’ve been bound by terrible luck. I’m not afraid of using power to win things, but to use luck to fight over them… I really have no confidence in that regard.”

Long Chen sighed inside as he had faced all kinds of trouble and misfortune. After entering the immortal world, his terrible luck had improved quite a bit thanks to his status as the Sage King.

Before that though, if he wanted to obtain such a priceless treasure, he would have to snatch it from someone else who had stumbled upon it by chance. There was no way for him to run into it himself.

Thus, even with the Earth Cauldron’s help, Long Chen still felt nervous about gathering the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom. He thought that perhaps the heavens would give him a devastating blow at any moment, so failing at a critical moment wouldn’t be strange.

“Actually, having bad luck isn’t necessarily bad. At the very least, it has tempered your confidence. If you instead relied on luck for everything, you would be entrusting your future to luck. Such a person cannot go far. The heavens are no longer the original heavens; what it bestows can be taken away at any time. Luck can vanish with a single breath, but power is constant. Even the heavens cannot take it away. If one wants to go far in the future, they cannot depend on luck,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen nodded. He had long since experienced what the Earth Cauldron was saying. Although he did occasionally grumble about his bad luck, deep inside, he vaguely felt that it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.

Those who thought they were the favored sons of the heavens often fell because of their overconfidence. They thought that the heavens would always look after them. If they hadn’t had such blind confidence, perhaps they wouldn’t have died. Relying on luck was essentially gambling with life.

In any case, Long Chen was used to his bad luck after dealing with it for so many years. If he couldn’t find something through luck, he could buy it. If he couldn’t buy it, he could scam it. If he couldn’t scam it, he could seize it through force. As long as he was strong enough, he didn’t think that luck was that important.

For example, this time, he was lucky enough to find the Jade Bone Violet Heart Bamboo and the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom. However, had he not been strong enough to place the slave mark on the black ape, it would have been impossible for him to come here.

Without absolute power, he would only be able to stare at the treasure or face the wrath of the other black ape. Thus, while it appeared as if he was lucky this time, it was also a manifestation of his power.

After taking the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom, Long Chen saw a hole in the ground below it. More Heaven Earth Qi came from below, so Long Chen couldn’t help but take a peek.

He found that there was a spirit pool deep below, and it had two openings.

“This is the Heaven Earth Spirit Spring. It is extremely rare, and its existence is what allowed the birth of the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen couldn’t help but sigh in awe at the marvels of the world. While tempted to collect some of the liquid for further study, the Earth Cauldron cautioned against it.

“If you touch the water, it will lose its balance and instantly dry up. It will never appear here again. You’ve already obtained a priceless treasure, so by no means should you destroy the precious land that produced it. Otherwise, karma will take its toll. Those who commit such acts are far from fortune and close to calamity,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen nodded. He had just been curious. He then continued on and plucked a few more rare medicinal ingredients. After that, he left with the black ape.

They traveled for several hours before the black ape suddenly stopped. Long Chen knew that this was the territory of another terrifying devil beast. Hence, he hastily concealed his aura and snuck his way over.
