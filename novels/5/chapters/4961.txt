The two golden bulls crashed forward with incredible force. Both were Earth Saint creatures, while the chariot itself was a treasure on par with a Heaven Saint divine weapon. As a result, their powerful pressure rendered Fang Liude and the others immobile, and they could only watch as the bulls barreled toward them. The impending impact seemed enough to flatten the entire land.

“Bring them somewhere else,” said Long Chen to Gui Jiu.

Gui Jiu almost leaped in excitement. He immediately waved his hand and summoned a water screen that enveloped Fang Liude and the others.

Once Fang Liude and the others were relieved of the pressure, they almost collapsed to the ground.

From the edge of the mountain valley, where they had first spotted the Six Horn Sea Serpent, they could see everything. This was the best place to watch the battle unfold.

The golden bulls accelerated, their auras growing stronger. They were like a shooting star crashing toward Long Chen.

Seeing this scene, Fang Liude and the others tensed up. This level of power exceeded their understanding. Yet, Long Chen hadn’t even released his aura. Astral winds blew back his black hair, and his robes flapped loudly. Compared to those giant golden bulls, Long Chen appeared completely minuscule.

“This is great!” shouted Gui Jiu.

Compared to Fang Liude and the others, who were extremely nervous, Gui Jiu was incredibly excited. He almost cheered.

“Are you not planning on helping Long Chen?!” asked Yu Ying as she glared at Gui Jiu angrily, thinking he was delighting in Long Chen’s misfortune.

“Do you not know who Long Chen is? Me, help him in battle?” Gui Jiu’s jaw dropped, and he stared at Yu Ying in disbelief.

“Who… Who is he?” Now it was Yu Ying’s turn to ask. They also wanted to know who exactly Long Chen was. Such an expert couldn’t possibly be a nameless figure.

Although Fang Liude and his companions had never seen anyone from the Heaven Rankings before, they always remembered the names of those heavenly geniuses. However, they had never heard of Long Chen’s name.

“He is—”

Gui Jiu was about to explain, but seeing the golden bulls’ auras growing, he hastily said, “I’ll tell you later. Let’s watch first. If we miss this fight, we’ll regret it for a lifetime.”

At that moment, the golden bulls reached their peak speed and power. Just as they were about to strike Long Chen, they veered to the left and right, causing the golden chariot to hurtle directly toward him.

The golden chariot possessed enough power to destroy an entire world. Yet, Long Chen still stood there calmly. Fang Liude and the others couldn’t bear to watch this, afraid of witnessing the sight of Long Chen being blasted apart. They firmly closed their eyes.

BOOM!

The ground quivered ever so slightly, but the devastating sight of the world collapsing didn’t appear. Not even raging astral winds formed as a result of the clash.

“Wow!” Gui Jiu sucked in a cold gasp of air.

Fang Liude and the others opened their eyes only to see Long Chen standing with one arm in front of him, blocking the golden chariot with ease. Not even the ground beneath his feet had cracked.

Despite their average strength, Fang Liude and his companions could see that Long Chen had withstood the full force of the golden chariot, with only a little of it leaking out.

This sight sent chills down their spines. For Long Chen to endure such terrifying power with his body, to what level had he trained his constitution?

Long Chen pushed aside the chariot and nodded. “Proud, but not hot-tempered. Domineering, but not overbearing. You are strong, but you don’t bully the weak. I didn’t know that the Long clan had someone like you. Not bad. Just based on this, you can keep your life.”

Long Chen saw through everything. This person attacked first but didn’t immediately start accumulating power, giving Gui Jiu and the others time to escape. Furthermore, though his attack appeared mighty, he had been holding back, clearly not intending to take Long Chen’s life. These points alone earned Long Chen’s respect for him.

Amidst the wild laughter, a group of people walked out of the chariot. Among them were seven people: one man and six women. The man sported neatly combed blonde hair and held a long-handled saber, exuding the aura of a formidable general.

His complexion was fair and unblemished. His robes were typical of the Long clan’s disciples, yet his attire differed in color—it gleamed golden, with violet-gold silk embroidering the edges, presenting an aura of luxury.

Emblazoned in black silk upon his robes were two large characters: “Heaven Ten.” The Heaven Rankings were completely different from the Earth Rankings; its experts all bore a “Heaven” character on their attire, signifying their illustrious status.

The number on his robes signified his ranking. Moreover, wearing such robes was the coveted dream of countless Long clan disciples, as only the top ten on the Heaven Rankings were privileged with their own special attire.

The other six women also donned robes bearing the “Heaven” character, yet beneath it lay more numbers: three hundred forty-five, four hundred sixty-three… One even held the rank of four hundred and ninety-nine.

It seemed that the one ranked four hundred and ninety-nine was on the verge of falling from the Heaven Rankings. She was in quite a predicament.

This man was Long Ziwei, the Long clan’s rank ten of the Heaven Rankings. He was renowned within the clan, idolized by many and desired by countless women.

Surrounded by his female companions from the Heaven Rankings, Long Ziwei lifted his head and chuckled.

Long Ziwei said, “I was only escorting my junior apprentice-sisters to hunt some Heaven Saint sea demons in the devil sea, but then I received word that someone named Long Chen had slain disciples of my Long clan. I hurried here to be the first to confront you. I wondered if you truly were the Long Chen I had heard of, and it seems my luck is on point. Indeed, it is you.”

Long Chen shook his head. “It’s too early to say whether or not you’re lucky.”

One of the women looked at Long Chen curiously and asked, “Are you really Saint Emperor Zhantian’s son?”

Before Long Chen could reply, another woman continued, “They do look a bit similar, but he looks weak. We’ll need to take a second look.”

“Hey, are you saying this because you’re worried about senior apprentice-brother Ziwei getting jealous?” teased another woman.

Hearing their conversation, Fang Liude and the others felt like they had been struck by a bolt of lightning. Long Chen was Saint Emperor Zhantian’s son? They hadn’t even known about Long Chen’s existence, and they had accidentally run into him.

“Fuck, he really does look similar to Saint Emperor Zhantian! Why didn’t I think of that?!” Fang Liude slapped his leg.

“No wonder I thought he looked somewhat familiar. So he’s Saint Emperor Zhantian’s son.” Yu Ying stared blankly.

Just as the six women laughed and teased each other, Long Ziwei walked over to Long Chen. Seeing this tense scene, everyone fell silent.

Looking at Long Chen gloomily, Long Ziwei said, “Since your identity is confirmed, let’s start. Today, I am going to kill you.”
