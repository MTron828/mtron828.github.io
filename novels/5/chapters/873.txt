Chapter 874 Destroyed Butt

Translator: BornToBe

Just as Yu Changhao was spinning through the air, he had an extremely bad feeling. He instantly spread his wings and shot forward. At the same time, his golden armor completely covered his body.

Regretfully, Yu Changhao still wasn’t as fast as Long Chen. Long Chen’s broadsword stabbed right into Yu Changhao’s butt. The cringing sound of bones breaking rang out.

“AHH!” A heart-rending cry resounded throughout the air. Through that miserable shriek, it was possible for everyone to feel the unbearable pain the person must be going through.

Although Yu Changhao had activated his golden armor to protect himself, he had only just put it on for an instant. It hadn’t been able to fully release its power, and so it had only blocked a portion of Long Chen’s attack.

Long Chen’s attack had stabbed right into Yu Changhao’s tailbone. There was a dense gathering of nerves there.

Yu Changhao was a peak expert. Even if he died, he wouldn’t let out such a miserable shriek. It was too embarrassing. But now he was just in too much pain to hold back. It was instinct.

Following his shriek, everyone felt a chill in their bones. They didn’t have any thoughts of laughing. Instead, they felt profound sympathy for him. These people were all experts, and they were aware of what parts of the body could elicit the most pain. They felt a chill in their own tailbones. All their hair stood on end.

Due to trying to avoid Long Chen’s attack and failing, Yu Changhao shot into the mountain like a cannonball. The ground crumbled as a huge hole appeared.

“It failed? But that’s also good. If this broadsword ended up contaminated with crap, it would be irritating to use,” muttered Long Chen to himself.

Suddenly, the ground began to quiver. The ground exploded and a figure soared into the sky. That figure was Yu Changhao.

His eyes were completely red now, looking like they might spit flames. His fury had reached a peak. He even felt like he might explode.

Pain, humiliation, and fury! All those negative emotions resounded within his mind. Just now, he had been in enough pain to want to die. Although his injury had recovered, that pain seemed to linger.

“Heaven Splitting Wings!”

Yu Changhao roared and his wings opened. A vast aura erupted, one that caused the world to shake.

Blinding golden light erupted. A pair of heaven-splitting wings appeared in the sky. Those wings were several miles long and seemed like two flying blades.

But those flying blades were formed of golden runes. Divine light circulated. As soon as those wings appeared, the world became filled with the aura of death.

“Die!” Yu Changhao formed hand seals, controlling the huge wings to attack Long Chen. They slashed toward him, and small black lines appeared in the sky where they passed.

“Heavens, the void is being torn apart!” cried people. They finally understood how terrifying Yu Changhao was.

Previously, Yu Changhao had been slapped an unknown number of times in the face by Long Chen. In the end, his butt had almost been completely destroyed. His status as a peak expert had greatly fallen in their hearts.

But now that he released this attack, they realized just how terrifying he was. They also admired his restraint. He had held back such a trump card for this moment.

“This attack will determine the victor. It’s one of the Feather race’s inherited divine abilities. Up until now, no one in the same realm had been able to receive this attack. Long Chen’s definitely dead!” said an ancient race expert.

In truth, Yu Changhao hadn’t been planning on using this kind of divine ability to kill Long Chen. This divine ability came at a price. It would exhaust the core runes in his blood.

Right now, he was at the peak of Xiantian. He had to maintain the purity of his blood so that he could advance perfectly to Sea Expansion.

If he used too much of the energy of his core runes because he unleashed such huge moves, it would cause his bloodline quality to drop. If he couldn’t restore it by the time the spiritual qi eruption occurred, he would miss that incredibly rare opportunity. That was unacceptable.

So even though he had been humiliated before, he hadn’t used this move. But now, he was truly unable to suppress his fury. All he wanted to do was kill Long Chen. To kill Long Chen, he didn’t care what he had to do.

Seeing those two huge golden wings slashing toward him like two divine blades, Long Chen’s hair stood on end. This attack was definitely terrifying. If he wasn’t careful, he could be killed.

Long Chen took a deep breath. Four stars appeared in his eyes, and he raised his broadsword.

A huge sword-image soared into the sky, and it possessed an imposing aura. It was like a god’s blade that was filled with a will that desired to shatter the world.

“Split the Heavens 2!” Long Chen shouted inside. His broadsword slashed toward the wings.

BOOM!

The two forces crashed together. In that instant, the world seemed to become still. It was silent. But in the next instant, a huge explosive sound erupted. Heaven and earth trembled, and the coffins on the mountain were sent flying.

“Not good!”

“Run!”

“Ahh!”

Miserable screams rang out along with the sound of bodies exploding. There were too many coffins at the peak of the mountain. They shot out like cannonballs, and many people were unable to dodge them. They were blown to bits.

Half of this huge mountain collapsed from this attack. Even the formation here hadn’t been able to stop it.

Just as everyone was feeling appalled, a majestic aura erupted. That aura was full of evil.

“Hahahaha! The Corrupt Dragon Bone Claw is mine! Long Chen, hand over your life!”

Xue You had been trying to subdue the Corrupt Dragon Bone Claw this entire time. He now laughed, his voice full of delight. His gaze landed on Long Chen in the air.

At this time, Long Chen and Yu Changhao’s hair was in disarray, and their auras were a bit unsteady. That exchange had been too intense. It had not only exhausted a great deal of their energy, but it had also caused a backlash that had injured them.

Long Chen was shocked. He had underestimated Yu Changhao before. Just now, he had used his strongest move but had still gone even with him. It was obvious that if he had fought him when the Immemorial Path had just opened, he would have been killed.

Now Xue You was holding a three-foot-long bone claw and smiling sinisterly at him. He knew he was about to join in.

“Hahaha, if you want to fight, then come. When have I ever been afraid of anyone?” Long Chen suddenly let out a burst of heaven-shaking laughter.

The Righteous experts, Corrupt experts, and ancient race experts were all shocked. Now two peak experts were about to attack him, but he still didn’t have the slightest intention of running? To fight one versus two against them, he was incredibly domineering.

But there were also quite a few people who thought he was an idiot. He knew how to show off, but showing off now would come at a price. And that would be an extremely miserable price.

“Haha, I’ll let you taste the power of my new weapon!”

Xue You laughed, and the bone claw in his hand shot straight toward Long Chen. On the way, it suddenly grew larger, becoming three hundred meters long.

Long Chen held his broadsword with both hands and slashed it on the bone claw. He also wanted to see just how strong this bone claw was.

BOOM! Long Chen’s attack didn’t even leave a mark on the bone claw.

“How hard!” The bone claw was fine, but Long Chen felt a burst of pain in both of his arms.

The bone claw was stopped by Long Chen. But then it suddenly began to close, wanting to crush Long Chen in its grasp. Its nimbleness was comparable to a human hand, startling Long Chen.

The bone claw snapped shut. But Long Chen had already used the Lightning Body Blink to escape. Although he had escaped, the ear-piercing sound from when the bone claw had snapped shut caused Long Chen to jump in fright. If he had been caught, then even if he didn’t immediately die, his bones would have definitely been crushed.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, let’s see just how you will run today! Once I put you away, I’ll then handle Leng Yueyan. With this Evil Dragon Bone Claw, I don’t need to worry about her!” Xue You was full of excitement. His laughter was also full of confidence.

“Brother Changhao, you don’t need to have any misgivings. This bastard is extremely slippery. If we’re not careful, he’ll get away. How about we work together to kill him?” asked Xue You.

Xue You knew Yu Changhao was powerful. With him present, Long Chen would find it difficult to flee. Xue You needed a helper like him, as his own speed wasn’t a match for Long Chen’s.

Now he could have Long Chen killed, and furthermore, it would count as cooperating. Perhaps in the future, they would be able to cooperate once more when he handled Leng Yueyan.

Although he had the Evil Dragon Bone Claw, in truth, Xue You was still traumatized by Leng Yueyan. Just the bone claw didn’t give him one hundred percent assurance, and so he wanted to form an alliance with Yu Changhao. Then his confidence would increase a bit.

However, he had no thoughts of subduing Leng Yueyan. In his eyes, Leng Yueyan wasn’t a woman. No, she wasn’t even human. She was a fiend, a fiend that might take his life at any moment.

“Alright, let’s work together to slaughter this brute!” Yu Changhao no longer had any assurance of being able to kill Long Chen now that his strongest move had been blocked by him. He was too powerful, and his chances of killing Long Chen on his own were too low. Cooperating with Xue You was his best option.

“Hahaha, good. All Corrupt experts, listen to my orders! Capture that woman! Once I kill Long Chen, I want to properly enjoy her!”

Xue You’s orders caused the Corrupt experts to smile wretchedly. They took out their weapons and charged toward the distant Yue Xiaoqian.
