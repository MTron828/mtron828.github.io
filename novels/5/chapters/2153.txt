Chapter 2143 Yue Xihan’s Advice

“Then the person in charge of this pasture...?” Long Chen’s heart pounded.

“Correct, it’s the devil race. They probably released these Magical Beasts into this world and will come to slaughter them every now and then. I’ve investigated the two channels. They were activated once thirty thousand years ago. Based on a few marks, I’ve also come to a hypothesis that there was a large battle at that time, but due to how much time has passed, those marks are too vague to confirm anything. But from the blood phoenix king’s corpse, it is possible to determine that the Magical Beasts here have been modified by someone. They are like livestock, and once they’ve grown fat and numerous enough, the devil race will slaughter them. Through this slaughter, they can strengthen their Devil Qi. The flesh and souls of all creatures are their best supplements. That’s why the devil race is like a pack of locusts. Wherever they go, death follows. Through various indications, it’s possible to conclude that we’ve accidentally barged into one of the devil race’s pastures,” said Yue Xihan.

“If it’s a pasture, then why did different races amongst the devil race come here?” asked Long Chen.

“Most likely, this world has been lost or forgotten. The devil race probably only noticed it again recently. To them, this is a masterless piece of fat meat, so they all want to take a bite or take possession of it. It’s a pity many of the original devil race’s resources have been destroyed by the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent. They’ve attacked the Skyscraping World several times, almost destroying it and making us lose many inheritances. We might be able to understand more otherwise.” Yue Xihan sighed.

“I don’t understand. Why does the Martial Heaven Continent want you dead? You’re clearly capable of suppressing the devil race. You should be allied with the Martial Heaven Continent.” Long Chen couldn’t help asking this question.

“This relates to the experts on a higher level. Once you reach that level, I will naturally tell you, or perhaps you will know by then without me saying anything. Telling you now is meaningless and will only rattle your Dao-heart,” said Yue Xihan.

Long Chen sighed helplessly. It seemed that the Martial Heaven Continent was even more complicated than he knew. There were countless secrets hidden in its depths.

“Alright, then if this Wild World is a pasture, then is the Martial Heaven Continent also a pasture for the devil race?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“Not just the devil race.”

Yue Xihan left, leaving behind Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian. It seemed she didn’t want to say too much.

Yue Xiaoqian said, “Long Chen, don’t blame my mother. She definitely has a reason why she isn’t telling you. Some things can cause unpredictable karma if spoken about. She does this to keep you safe.”

“Of course. I know my mother-in-law is looking out for me.” Long Chen smiled.

“Your skin is really thick. Who agreed to marry you?” demanded Yue Xiaoqian, blushing.

Long Chen arrogantly laughed, making Yue Xiaoqian blush even harder. Her heart had long since been given to Long Chen. However, her skin wasn’t as thick as his, and the slightest teasing got good results.

Long Chen knew that Yue Xiaoqian had to focus on upgrading her divine seal right now. With every fight, the original devil race was benefiting immensely from slaying the devils. The devil cores were upgrading the power of their divine seals, making their power against the devil race even greater. The more they fought, the stronger they would become.

Regretfully, while they were the bane of the devil race, they wouldn’t have that kind of advantage against opponents that weren’t from the devil race. For example, the human race.

After Yue Xiaoqian left, Long Chen extracted the blood phoenix king’s crystal core, blood, and bones. Those were all treasures.

He extracted everything useful from the Magical Beasts that had died in battle. Wilde only needed the meat.

Many parts of twelfth rank Magical Beasts were treasures that couldn’t be bought with money. Hence, it could be said that a huge amount of wealth had fallen into Long Chen’s pocket this time.

Day after day passed. Long Chen was refining Life Star Pills all day for the future. He didn’t just need to refine them for himself but also the Dragonblood Legion. It was all in preparation for the qi flow eruption.

Half a month later, five eruptions occurred from the channels to the devil race. There were three small skirmishes and two immense battles. One of them was an even greater invasion than the last time.

However, they were all annihilated by the original devil race. That was because their power had risen crazily, and their divine seals were much stronger.

In order to lessen the pressure, they would occasionally activate the formation, transporting a group of devils to the territory of Magical Beasts. That was like throwing water into boiling oil.

The Magical Beasts went crazy, annihilating the devils. The drake king said that with the devils constantly invading, there were fewer fights amongst the Magical Beasts. They now had devils to kill if they were bored.

Seeing that everything was under control, Long Chen went over to the drake king. He asked it to look after the original devil race and gave it a pill.

This pill was made of his own essence blood. It was a Spirit Awakening Pill that could raise the intelligence of the drake king. Hopefully, that would allow the drake king to awaken some of its talent and advance to the thirteenth rank.

Even Magical Beasts needed to comprehend the Heavenly Daos to cultivate to their peak. Doing that required a certain amount of intelligence.

Humans were the most spiritual of all beings, making them closest to the Heavenly Daos. Whether it wanted to become a true dragon or simply break through, being able to transform into human form would definitely help.

This selfless gesture from Long Chen made it even more grateful, and as its intelligence grew, it became even more thankful. It promised not to let anything happen to the original devil race.

Long Chen then told Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, and the others to work hard during this time. Xia Chen especially had to spend the remaining two months preparing for the qi flow eruption.

When the qi flow eruption occurred, there would definitely be a competition with countless experts, including those ancient powers. Perhaps there would be a bloody battle. It would all be up to each side’s power.

“Xiaoqian, do you want to go back with me this time?” asked Long Chen. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Long Chen wanted to return to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. There was the drake king here, so everything was under control. Now he was getting a bit worried about that side.

After all, with how the Mechanism Sect had sneak attacked there before, it was telling everyone that if they wanted to find trouble for Long Chen, they could attack the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

“I’m listening to my mom. Before the devil race invades the continent, I have to upgrade my devil seal. That’s the only way I can help you in the future. Mom also said...” Yue Xiaoqian hugged Long Chen, leaning her head against him.

“Said what?” asked Long Chen, holding on to her tightly. Her fragrance was bewitching.

Yue Xiaoqian smiled mischievously. “My mom said that all your women are so strong and are of great assistance to you. If I don’t have this little bit of power, I won’t be loved as much.”

“Nonsense, I love you from my heart. If it weren’t for you, I would have been killed by that Yin Luo in the Jiuli secret realm. You were my savior. If I didn’t give my heart to a beauty like you, I would be letting down the fate that drew us together.” Long Chen kissed Yue Xiaoqian’s forehead.

Yue Xiaoqian wrinkled her nose cutely and glared at him. “Bad person. So it was all based on looks?”

Long Chen laughed. “Of course. Isn’t everything like that? After being saved, if they weren’t good looking but still wanted your heart, you have to immediately say, ‘Miss, I cannot, for if I were to marry you, it would taint your act of chivalry. It would be like I needed saving from you because I wanted to force you into marrying me. Wouldn’t that make everyone look down on us?’ But if they were a beauty, then it’d be different. You would immediately say, ‘For you to love me like this, I have a responsibility to return your love. If I didn’t, wouldn’t I be worse than a dog? I will spend this life of mine to protect you for a lifetime.’”

The sanctimonious yet realistic way that Long Chen acted made Yue Xiaoqian laugh. “I like seeing you seriously talk nonsense.”

After talking a bit more, and confirming that Yue Xiaoqian truly wanted to stay behind and wasn’t testing his sincerity toward her, Long Chen left.

Among all his women, only Tang Wan-er was actually difficult to handle. She played many tricks that made Long Chen feel cautious. Fortunately, if it was just Tang Wan-er, he could handle it.

To be careful, Long Chen stealthily left the Skyscraping World, covering up not just his aura but also his appearance. He made several loops and confirmed that there was nothing questionable before leaving.

He flew for about an incense stick’s worth of time over the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring before encountering two experts wearing the robes of the ancient family alliance.

From a distance, he saw that they were Empyreans and most likely searching for the location of the qi flow eruption. The entire continent was currently searching and hoping to find it ahead of time so they could get an advantage.

Long Chen ignored them, continuing to fly toward the Central Plains. However, while he ignored them, the two of them suddenly turned back to chase him.

“Hold it!”

Both of them shouted, blocking Long Chen in the sky in a very unfriendly manner.
