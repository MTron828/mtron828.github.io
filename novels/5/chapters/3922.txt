Chapter 3911 Little Snow Annihilates Qilin

“Little Snow!”

When Meng Qi saw this snow-white wolf with a clump of fiery-red fur on its forehead, she cried out emotionally.

Little Snow was no longer the old Little Snow. Now, its body was larger than a mountain, and it possessed a supreme might. It was a wolf god that stood above all others, possessing an emperor qi that looked down on the nine heavens.

Millions and millions of wind blades flowed around it like ripples, and the laws of the wind element gathered around it, prostrating themselves.

At this moment, Little Snow raised its head and roared, letting out a sound filled with ruler qi, as well as many emotions.

“Little Snow! It really is Little Snow!”

All the Dragonblood warriors instantly thought of Little Snow when they saw its snow-white body. However, that supreme emperor qi made them doubt this thought. They couldn’t be sure.

Yet, Little Snow’s responding cry confirmed it for them. This giant terrifying snow wolf was Little Snow. Little Snow was back!

Little Snow’s claw was still pressing down on the flame qilin who was howling furiously, flames gushing out of its body. Although the earth was being ravaged by its struggle, it was unable to escape.

However, Little Snow was ignoring that flame qilin and instead just fixed its gaze on the coffin, a sense of warmth radiating from its eyes.

“Moon Howling Heavenly Wolf? This is your boss’s companion?”

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox looked at Little Snow and its pupils shrank in shock.

“I don’t know.” Bai Xiaole shook his head, unaware of Little Snow’s existence.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth quivered and Little Snow’s giant body slowly rose. The flame qilin was growing bigger.

“It's igniting its core runes!” exclaimed Meng Qi as a warning to Little Snow. She knew that the flame qilin was powerless to resist while it was being suppressed like this, so it actually ignited its core runes just to escape.

Only then did Little Snow shift its attention away from Long Chen. Upon looking down on the expanding flame qilin beneath its foot, the warmth in Little Snow’s eyes instantly vanished, replaced with icy killing intent instead. Little Snow suddenly bit down on the flame qilin’s head.

The flame qilin let out a thunderous roar, fiercely resisting with all its strength. Berserk flames then erupted from its body, unleashing a scorching inferno that caused even heaven and earth to melt under its terrifying heat. However, Little Snow seemed immune to its flame energy. These flames weren’t even able to scorch its white fur.

Suddenly, a blood-colored moon materialized behind Little Snow. When this moon appeared, the world thrummed with a murderous aura. After that, the wind element energy around Little Snow grew active, sending astral winds raging.

As a giant whirlpool appeared in Little Snow’s mouth, all the world’s wind energy was sucked into it, and the flame qilin’s terrifying power was gradually compressed. As a result, its body stopped inflating and began to shrink.

The flame qilin suddenly roared in terror as it found that it couldn’t move. All its flame energy was sealed by some mysterious force.

After that, Little Snow’s body shook. The wind energy inside of its mouth shot along with the flame qilin. People only saw a sphere of flame and wind energy shoot out into the distance.

“Not good!”

Startled cries rang out. This sphere was headed directly to where the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts were gathered, so they fled for their lives.

BOOM!

That giant wind and flame sphere exploded just like that. The sphere, with the flame qilin at its core, was like a bomb. Terrifying flames borrowed the power of the wind to spread far and wide.

As an enormous space was devoured by the flames, the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts didn’t even get a chance to make a grunt. The impact simply blasted them away, not even leaving their bones behind.

Seeing so many of the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts killed in that one attack, everyone’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

Rather than saying that these people were killed by Little Snow, it would be more accurate to say that they had died to the flame qilin’s self-detonation.

Little Snow had controlled the flame qilin, using its wind energy as the detonator to turn it into a bomb.

As a result, this attack killed the flame qilin along with countless disciples of the Sacred Pill Hall. It could be said to be the most terrifying attack to occur ever since the battle started.

Flames still burned, scorching heaven and earth, and countless experts were slain. This scene left people stunned.

They then looked at Little Snow and saw a blood moon hanging high in the air. Beneath it was a snow wolf looking arrogantly down on all life. That scene was unforgettable.

“Good, very good! Hahaha!” Unexpectedly though, after the flame qilin was slain, Yin Changsheng actually laughed as if he was excited. That laugh made others think that he had officially gone insane.

However, only Mo Nian grew even more vigilant. After the flame qilin was slain, Yin Changsheng’s aura actually changed, growing even more dangerous.

Yin Changsheng’s aura began to climb as though endless power was being injected into his body. The power of his domain grew, its range widening, and the figure behind him also grew more solid.

“He…!” Xia Chen and the others stared at Yin Changsheng in shock.

“I really have to thank you. You must not know, my family has a secret agreement with the flame qilin race. When I was born, I was forced into a spiritual contract with this flame qilin. I had endless talent, but this dumb beast kept slowing me down. Although most of my energy was sucked away by it, in all these years, this idiot never awakened the qilin’s divine abilities. Hehe, now that you’ve killed it, all of the power that it absorbed is coming back to me! I no longer need such a useless companion, hahaha!”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yin Changsheng's laughter echoed, resonating with the rumbling of his manifestation and domain. As his aura swelled without bounds, transcending any limits, cracks began to appear in the void.

“Now, let’s see if you can run again!” Yin Changsheng smiled sinisterly and attacked Mo Nian with his spear.
