Chapter 2084 Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill

“Ah, I’m sorry, you’re too late. Again, we simply cannot be together that way...,” said Long Chen helplessly.

“Shut up! If you keep talking nonsense like that, I’ll really beat you!” Beitang Rushuang raised a fist.

Long Chen laughed and accepted the Heavenly Spirit Water. Looking at it, he was a bit emotional.

This Heavenly Spirit Water didn’t have any use on him. But it would be very effective at healing the wounds of the Moon and Star Refining Furnace.

“Let’s go. I’ll treat you to fish,” said Long Chen.

“Fish again?”

“If you don’t want fish, I can treat you to dirt.”

“Bastard.”

...

The three didn’t go eat fish and found a secluded place to drink tea instead. Beitang Rushuang’s hostility toward Nangong Zuiyue had clearly lessened, to the point where at the very least, the two could talk normally to each other.

“Long Chen, I won’t lie to you. I had a goal in getting close to you- ah, but don’t even mention anything about romance again!” warned Beitang Rushuang.

Perhaps Beitang Rushuang had never met someone as shameless as Long Chen. She had no way to deal with him.

“To make a long story short, I want to hear everything about Sovereign Yun Shang. Last time, our conversation on that topic was cut short. This time, if it’s not too much, I hope you can go into greater detail,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“It’s true. Everything about the Sovereigns is shrouded in mystery. Everyone is curious about them. Even I want to know,” added Nangong Zuiyue.

“You want to know everything I know about Sovereign Yun Shang? Why didn’t you say so sooner? There’s nothing for me to hide.”

Long Chen directly told them about the battlefield in the Spirit World where he had obtained Evilmoon. He told them about how Sovereign Yun Shang had sealed Evilmoon and given it to him.

“That black blade of yours was a gift that Sovereign Yun Shang left for you? Then doesn’t that mean you will be the future Sovereign?” exclaimed Beitang Rushuang.

“Yes, I also think so. I shall be the next Sovereign, the one to summon rains and wind, to soar through the heavens, to dominate the continent, to be surrounded by beauties...” Long Chen nodded.

“Ah, now that you say this, I feel like you probably aren’t fit to be a Sovereign.” Beitang Rushuang’s shock and amazement instantly transformed into disdain. Long Chen, a Sovereign? She refused to believe it.

They weren’t alike at all. Long Chen didn’t have any of the mannerisms of the Sovereigns. Furthermore, what Sovereign had such a scoundrel mouth?

“If I start talking properly now, will it be in time to become a Sovereign?” asked Long Chen nervously.

A chuckle escaped Beitang Rushuang. “Stop making me laugh. If I laugh, I’ll get wrinkles.” Long Chen’s nervous expression was just too odd.

Nangong Zuiyue shook her head. “Sovereign Yun Shang was the first generation Sovereign. He was able to see through spacetime, into the future. For him to leave Evilmoon to you must have some deeper meaning. However, the fact that he left two things, but one was taken by Leng Yueyan doesn’t make sense.”

Long Chen didn’t say much regarding Leng Yueyan. As for the Corrupt path, ever since she had escaped her execution, they had not mentioned her ever again. It was like she was a taboo. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Leng Yueyan seemed to have vanished from the continent. No one knew what she was up to.

“Long Chen, you’re very close to Leng Yueyan, correct?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“Ah... how do I put this? I suppose we are very... close.” Long Chen suddenly thought of how Leng Yueyan had taken his first time.

He suddenly missed her. He didn’t know how she was right now. How was her fight with her true body?

“Long Chen, thank you. Through your soul, we saw the Sovereign. We can now die with no regrets,” said Nangong Zuiyue, extremely grateful.

Just now, Long Chen had opened his soul to them, allowing them to see Sovereign Yun Shang from his memories.

That was an opportunity that they had never expected. Having been allowed to see the true appearance of a Sovereign, they confirmed that the Sovereigns were truly transcendent figures just like the legends said.

The charisma that Sovereign Yun Shang had possessed was even greater than the legends. Every word he said, every move he made contained the ability to make them devote their lives to him. In this world, there was a certain style, a certain heroism, a certain conviction, and when all of them were together, they were bestowed the title of Sovereign.

After thanking Long Chen, Nangong Zuiyue left. She said that having borne witness to a Sovereign, she had to focus her thoughts. She might be near a breakthrough.

Beitang Rushuang also said the same thing. Watching them leave, Long Chen was a bit dumbfounded. Could seeing a Sovereign really cause a comprehension breakthrough? How come he hadn’t felt anything then? He hadn’t had any comprehension advancements even after flipping the Sovereign’s chessboard. Was he an idiot?

Since the two of them had gone, Long Chen asked for another alchemy room for himself. However, he wasn’t refining pills but medicinal powder.

He then slowly merged the medicinal powder with the drop of Heavenly Spirit Water.

The Heavenly Spirit Water was originally transparent, but with the addition of the powders, it turned milky white. Then countless granules began to appear in it, clashing with each other.

Long Chen dripped this concoction into the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. The drop instantly dissolved and was absorbed by the furnace.

“It really is magical. It can’t be treated with common sense.”

The Heavenly Spirit Water was instantly absorbed. The furnace shook slightly, and an air of life whirled around it for a moment before it once more fell into slumber.

“It’s too bad there was so little of the Heavenly Spirit Water. If I had a dozen drops, it might have been enough to wake up the furnace. But this isn’t bad. At the very least, it has drastically shortened the time it will take for the furnace to wake up. The money was well spent.” Long Chen smiled, sensing the slight air of life within the furnace with a gratified smile.

The third day’s auction would actually be taking place three days from now. Then the auctions would come to an end, and the true point of this gathering would begin.

It could be said that Long Chen had come early. He hadn’t really been paying attention, and so he had taken this registration time as the time that the gathering actually started.

Currently, many experts were still slowly trickling over. Long Chen found it curious that Ye Lingshan hadn’t come yet. She should have come right at the start.

However, perhaps she was busy solidifying her awakened manifestation. Doing her best to increase her power so she could stand tall amongst these monsters wasn’t a bad idea.

Ye Lingshan wasn’t present, and neither was the Pill Fairy. Many other experts also hadn’t come. He didn’t know if they weren’t coming or if they were waiting for the real start.

“Well, it doesn’t matter. Let’s refine a few eleventh tier pills first.”

Taking advantage of his leisure time, he started refining more pills. According to reason, he should be refining the sixth star’s pill, the Nethergate Pill. However, he lacked one of its main ingredients: the Heavenly Nether Vermillion Fruit. He had asked Zheng Wenlong to help him look for it, but Zheng Wenlong had never even heard of it. For even Zheng Wenlong to not know of it, it probably didn’t exist on the Martial Heaven Continent.

With these ancient powers coming out, Long Chen could only hope that one of them would have it. However, right now he couldn’t openly ask for it. He could only wait and see.

“The majority of the ingredients I have are just secondary ingredients. Other than the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill, the only thing I can refine is the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill.” Long Chen found another pill he could refine amongst the countless pill formulas in his head.

Eleventh tier pills required far too many ingredients. Some required over a thousand.

Furthermore, Long Chen only had some of the plant ingredients. Other ingredients included spirit beast essence blood, crystal cores, precious ores, and other mystical objects.

Before he obtained the formulas, he hadn’t thought about gathering those things. Once he had, he found that it was useless to know, because he didn’t have the ability to gather them.

Long Chen had already given a list to Zheng Wenlong of things to help him gather, but odds were that he would have to find ways to gather them himself.

The Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill was one of three eleventh tier pills that used the least ingredients. It only required a hundred pistils from different precious medicines. It just so happened that Long Chen had them all.

With his experience refining the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill, things went much smoother. Long Chen also found that the Moon and Star Refining Furnace was helping him more. He was refining the ingredients into powders much faster, and the quality had clearly improved slightly.

“Excellent, the Heavenly Spirit Water is truly a magical existence. It’s already having a slight effect.”

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace had clearly recovered slightly from the Heavenly Spirit Water’s nourishment. Although it couldn’t consciously help him, some of its natural abilities were restored.

After refining the powders, Long Chen started refining the pill. However, this time, he wasn’t going all-out like last time. He held back slightly, prepared for any accidents.

The first furnace of pills was quickly finished. There were nine pills, three of them high grade and the rest middle grade. Long Chen nodded. This result surpassed his expectations.

If he wanted to refine a top grade eleventh tier pill, then with his current ability, he could refine only one pill at a time. However, if he wasn’t going for a top grade pill, he could refine nine pills at once with less risk.

Long Chen consumed one of the pills. He felt his blood quicken and then rumbling rang out. Flowers began to bloom within his essence blood.

Flowers also appeared on the exterior of his body. The hundred flowers lingered, and Dao runes appeared on their petals. Long Chen suddenly let out a pleasantly surprised cry. “So that’s the case!”
