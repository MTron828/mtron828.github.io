Chapter 4228 Qualified to Be My Enemy

The sword appeared behind Long Chen, yet he swung his saber to the right in front of him.

BOOM!

The void collapsed, and a burst of blood exploded as a figure shot away.

“Want to run? Try again in your next life!” Long Chen snorted. This assassin was truly skillful. The attack toward Long Chen’s back was nothing more than a shadow to trick his senses. But as soon as this trick was seen through, the assassin fled.

However, he didn’t manage to fully dodge Long Chen’s counterattack, so half of his body was destroyed.

The next moment, Kunpeng wings spread on Long Chen’s back, and he vanished instantaneously.

Just as Long Chen vanished, a blood-soaked figure appeared and hacked his sword down.

BOOM!

His sword struck the Minghong Saber, forcing Long Chen to reappear. At this time, the Shadow race’s assassin couldn’t bother with concealing himself and could only fight with all his power.

Crack.

The Shadow Assassin’s sword shattered as the Minghong Saber slashed down, cleaving that Shadow Assassin in two.

To everyone’s surprise, a Shadow Assassin fell to Long Chen’s saber just like that, without having a chance to escape.

At first, when everyone saw that Long Chen was being targeted by the Shadow Assassins, most of the people simply thought that Long Chen’s death was inevitable because these assassins were simply too terrifying.

However, they didn’t even have a chance to display their amazing assassination arts before being slain by Long Chen. Most shocking of all, once this person was slain, people saw three kinds of divine light dissipate from his body. In other words, that assassin had been a Triple Supreme.

All of a sudden, Long Chen’s body quivered, and he shot into the sky. Eight swords then pierced the space where he had stood just moments before.

Those eight swords appeared without any warning at all, attacking him from eight different angles. If he had been the slightest bit slower, he’d have eight new holes in his body.

Suddenly, Long Chen stamped on the air and shot back. As if he had struck the ceiling of the heavens, he bounced back with even greater speed.

This kind of rapid turning and acceleration was practically a defiance of the common knowledge in the cultivation world. Perhaps even a Triple Supreme would be crushed by their own force under this level of acceleration.

However, Long Chen didn’t give them a chance to be too surprised. His saber descended, reciprocating the simultaneous attack of all eight assailants.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

His strike was focused yet seemed effortless, presenting a paradoxical combination of a complex technique honed to perfection and a seemingly haphazard, unskilled slash.

The next moment, a giant crescent fang slashed into the martial stage, annihilating the dark creatures in the surroundings. Those eight Shadow Assassins also vanished.

When the martial stage split open, countless fragments flew through the air and struck many dark creatures, killing them and effectively clearing a giant area of the martial stage.

Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings flapped once more, seemingly teleporting him thousands of miles away.

The Minghong Saber slashed down, tearing through space with a ferocious strike. A crimson mist then burst forth, and people vaguely saw fragments of a shattered sword. However, the master of that sword remained invisible, leaving them guessing whether the owner of this sword had met a terrible end.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Without a break, Long Chen’s figure vanished again, and when he reappeared, he slashed his saber to a new spot.

As a result, another clump of blood mist erupted, signifying that another expert of the Shadow race had been slain.

Seeing this scene, all the experts watching were stunned. The Shadow race’s innate concealing talent was actually ineffective in front of Long Chen.

Even innate Heaven Venerates were unable to sense Shadow Assassins, but Long Chen could accurately find them and launch a killing blow at them in the blink of an eye. These assassins that terrified countless people didn’t even have the ability to fight back in front of Long Chen.

“Just who is the assassin exactly?” Stunned expressions could be seen all over. These assassins were now the prey.

Every time Long Chen’s saber slashed down, another Shadow Assassin was slain. By the seventeenth one, everyone was convinced that none of the assassins could withstand his saber.

“Minghong Saber, you really are amazing. You already have such power at the half-step Eternal realm.” Long Chen looked at the Minghong Saber excitedly. The current Minghong Saber could truly be considered a half-step Eternal divine weapon. Long Chen’s power could flow through and extend out of it. He could use it as his eyes, and it would grant him a perspective that allowed him to capture the flow of the Heavenly Daos.

In truth, the Shadow Assassins had exerted their full effort in attacking, defending, and fleeing. However, they were locked down by the Minghong Saber, and Long Chen didn’t need to bother even thinking about how to counter them. This was the result of simply being stronger.

In fact, the Minghong Saber was even able to sense the weaknesses of his targets. Those weaknesses were things that even Long Chen might not notice.

From the outside, these assassins were like fools who just stood there as Long Chen killed them. In truth, they had done everything they could, but it was all useless. The Minghong Saber could always find their mortal weakness and slay them in one blow.

The Minghong Saber continuously got stronger, and Long Chen’s synergy with it grew in tandem. Through the Minghong Saber, Long Chen felt like he was seeing a vast and boundless world.

These Shadow Assassins had top grade World Domain divine items. But even then, they were unable to endure the blow from the half-step Eternal Minghong Saber.

As Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings repeatedly quivered, his speed continued to climb, to the point that he seemed to teleport. Like a phantom, he appeared throughout every corner of the battlefield. Every time he appeared, a Shadow Assassin was slain.

With another flash, Long Chen’s saber pierced through the air, forcing a Shadow Assassin out of the void. The Minghong Saber accurately pierced through his back and out his chest.

People finally saw a complete Shadow Assassin, as this one wasn’t blown up into blood mist like the others. This Shadow Assassin was skinny, and with his long hands and feet, he almost looked like a monkey. For many people, this was their first time seeing the appearance of a Shadow Assassin.

His pitch-black eyes were now full of terror. It seemed as if he was trying to struggle, but he couldn’t move.

“If you wanted to attack, you should have come at me directly. Sending a bunch of scapegoats to test me? You’ve already lost your qualifications to be my enemy like this.”

Long Chen looked in a certain direction and sneered.

With a quiver of the Minghong Saber, that Shadow Assassin exploded.
