Chapter 4824 Square Heaven Seal

Devil Fall City was unimaginably large, and what they could see with their eyes was only the tip of the iceberg. Even though the transportation formation was miles away from the city, they were unable to see the whole city.

When Long Chen and Mo Nian walked off the transportation formation, they were gently pushed aside by a subtle force as another group of people arrived. The transportation formation continued to flash intermittently, bringing in one large group after another. Devil Fall City was bustling with activity, with multiple groups of beings arriving and departing in rapid succession, making the city bustling and dynamic with constant movement.

These newcomers were mostly like Long Chen, staring at the city in wonder. Devil Fall City completely stunned them.

The giant city reached far into the clouds, like a giant seal stamped onto the ground. When Long Chen’s gaze shifted from the top to the bottom of the city, he couldn’t help gasping.

Below the city, an enormous head was partially submerged in the ground, with one half buried beneath the earth and the other half protruding into the city. The sheer scale of the head was so immense that its full form remained unseen, and the two giant city gates were its eye sockets.

Even with Long Chen’s guts, this sight still made his heart quiver as he stared in disbelief.

“Is it... is it still alive?!”

“Of course. Otherwise, there would be no need for the Square Heaven Seal to suppress it. The Square Heaven Seal is an exceedingly terrifying divine weapon. If it weren't for the seal containing this devil's head, I would truly be tempted to attempt stealing it,” Mo Nian declared, his eyes filled with determination.

The Square Heaven Seal was the city and also a divine weapon with a shocking origin. Legend had it that its true history was so ancient that its origins were nearly untraceable. However, the rumors suggested it was the core divine weapon of a formidable almighty expert from the primal chaos era.

In the primal chaos battle, the Square Heaven Seal and its master fought a devil from beyond the heavens and ended up sacrificing themselves to bring it down. However, that devil was absolutely terrifying, and even though it was reduced to just a head, its soul essence persisted. If it was given a chance, it could still revive.

The conflict between the Square Heaven Seal and the devil had persisted from the primal chaos era to the present day, with no definitive victor emerging. The Square Heaven Seal remained vigilant, as the devil had yet to be fully eradicated. Long Chen gazed at the eye sockets, feeling immense bloodthirst and a terrifying desire for vengeance.

“Devil Fall City is also called Square Heaven Devil Fall City. This place is forbidden to the devil race. Anyone with the devil race’s blood in them will be annihilated by the Square Heaven Seal as soon as they get close to the city. Come on, you’ll see something even more shocking later,” said Mo Nian.

There was a sea of people around them, and it was hard for them to stay in one spot. They were forced to follow the flow of the crowd and gradually approached the city gates.

There were two gates. One gate allowed people to go in and out, but the other gate was only for people coming in. Furthermore, there was a long line there, but Mo Nian chose to line up there.

“Why not the other gate?” asked Long Chen.

“I can take that gate, but you can’t,” answered Mo Nian, his voice tinged with arrogance.

“And what does that mean?”

“Only handsome people can go through that gate. With my amazing looks, it’s naturally no problem for me. But you... well, you aren’t bad, but you still haven’t reached the necessary level,” replied Mo Nian solemnly.

Long Chen rolled his eyes. Just as he was about to scoff at Mo Nian, he heard giggling to the side. Long Chen then turned around to see two women with bows on their backs.

Both of these women were slender and tall, dressed in skintight clothing that accentuated their figures. They stood directly behind Long Chen and Mo Nian. However, with his attention occupied by the grandness of Devil Fall City, he hadn’t taken any note of these two beautiful women.

Although the two women were concealing it, they still gave off intense Doyen fluctuations. Long Chen discerned that they were at least seven star Doyens, although he couldn't pinpoint their exact rank.

Furthermore, their pupils were different from most people. Their pupils had a faint cross mark in them. It was a kind of pupil art. Long Chen had seen people use such a thing before. This kind of pupil art was to increase the precision of one’s aim. It seemed both of them were master archers.

Upon noticing Long Chen and Mo Nian turning their attention toward them, the two women showed no signs of shyness. One of them spoke up boldly, saying, “Friend, don’t pay attention to this brother’s nonsense. You're much more handsome than him. Yes, at the very least, we two sisters think so.”

Long Chen burst into laughter at the women's candidness, appreciating their straightforward approach. Their lack of reservation made the interaction feel refreshing.

“Hey, what are you talking about? I’m clearly much more handsome! I'll walk right through that gate to prove it! Want to bet on it? We’ll see if my looks let me pass through or not!” sputtered Mo Nian.

One of the women chuckled in response. “Do you think this is my first time here? I'm also escorting someone.”

She then turned to Long Chen and explained, “In order to go through that gate, you need a registered tablet. Newcomers have to go get a Devil Fall tablet before they can go through that gate. It has nothing to do with looks.”

Finally grasping the situation, Long Chen glanced at Mo Nian, who appeared to be feigning innocence and gazing up at the sky as if he hadn't heard the explanation.

Turning back to the woman, Long Chen retorted with a smirk, “No, it's definitely related to one's appearance. Only someone with thick skin could say something so shameless.”

The two women instantly laughed, causing Mo Nian to snap. “I was just joking! Why’d you have to expose me?”

“Who asked you to say that you were more handsome than him? Did your mother not teach you to be honest?” teased one of the women. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mo Nian was speechless. For a moment, he didn’t know what to retort. Not wanting Mo Nian to feel too embarrassed, Long Chen said, “We’re good brothers, so it’s normal for us to joke around. Let us introduce ourselves. I am Long Chen, and this is Mo Nian.”

“I am Yu Tong, and this is my little sister Yu Fei. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” The straightforward woman smiled and extended a slender hand to Long Chen.

Long Chen was taken aback by the woman's eagerness to shake hands, finding it unexpectedly intimate. Hence, Long Chen only held her hand lightly, maintaining a respectful distance. It was a rare form of handshake where the hands appeared to be held but without actual contact.

Etiquette dictated that when shaking a woman's hand, one should lightly grasp her fingertips as a gesture of courtesy and respect, not holding the entire hand to prevent any form of impropriety. However, the woman held Long Chen’s entire hand. When both their hands met, a warm flame rose on Yu Tong’s palm. Long Chen was surprised. She was a bit too frank, no?

Following the handshake, the woman seemed delighted and unexpectedly grasped both of Long Chen's arms, catching him off guard with her exuberance.

“We’ll be one family in the future!” she said excitedly.

Mo Nian’s jaw dropped in disbelief.

“What the fuck?! How did you do that, bro?”
