This kind of tribulation existed only in legends. However, back outside the Eastern Xuan City, countless experts had managed to witness this legendary lightning.

At that time, it had been Ye Qingkuang who had summoned his tribulation and been killed by Long Chen. At that time, Long Chen had provoked the heavens, inciting this five-colored lightning to descend.

This kind of lightning could no longer be called heavenly tribulation. It was heavenly punishment. Heavenly tribulation was just a trial, but heavenly punishment was to kill.

“Long Chen has angered the heavens!”

“This lightning tribulation, it’s so powerful!”

Tu Qianshang couldn’t help clenching his fists upon seeing so many lightning beasts descending from the sky.

“Little brats, look well. See how Long Chen doesn’t even blink in the face of the heavens’ fury? Then look at yourselves. I hit you a few times with a stick, and you flee like rabbits. Aren’t you all cowards?” The old man shook his cane at Bao Buping and the others.

“Hmph, his tribulation will end in just a bit. But you come to find trouble with us all day long. Does bullying the little fellow make you seem strong? If you have the ability, then let’s fight once we reach the Netherpassage realm as well!” said Bao Buping.

“Little brat, good. So you dare to have a tough mouth. Then all of you, just wait,” snorted the old man.

“Reporting, it was just Bao Buping. It has nothing to do with us.” The other disciples hastily raised their hands to express their innocence.

“So you don’t even have the daring to have a tough mouth? You’re even more cowardly. Just wait!” shouted the old man.

This time, all the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples wilted like flowers that had met a night’s frost.

Qu Jianying and the others shook their heads. If he acted so powerful, then his disciples would be living under his shadow. Just how would they grow? The way that the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect raised its disciples was truly unique.

The five-colored lightning beasts were still roaring in the sky, being in the phase of accumulating energy. At this moment, the four Fate Princes charged at Long Chen, but they were blocked by the lightning drakes.

As for True Immortal Jiaoqi and the others, they were ‘unfortunately’ one step slower.

Before they could do anything else, the thousands of beasts in the sky roared and smashed down like meteorites. It was like a barrier had broken.

“This isn’t five-colored peak lightning! That lightning contains different energy!” Amongst the crowd, Hu Feng suddenly let out a shocked cry.

BOOM!

The first lightning beast smashed into the Heavenly Fate Platform. A large hole actually appeared, and countless cracks spread. The incomparably tough Heavenly Fate Platform was actually unable to endure.

One giant dragon turtle had appeared. It was a dirt-yellow color, and when it opened its mouth, a giant earth-colored sphere shot at Long Chen. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Chen finally had to move, dodging the attack. As a result, it shot past him, leaving a deep gorge on Heavenly Fate Island.

“This is...” Jaws dropped. This attack possessed the power to annihilate an ordinary Netherpassage expert of the first step. How could a Soul Transformation disciple attacking the Life Star realm cause such a terrifying tribulation?

The most shocking thing of all was that the dragon turtle actually used earth energy.

“How can a lightning beast’s attack contain the earth element’s energy within it? That’s impossible!” People felt like they were going crazy. That earth element attack toppled their understanding of heavenly tribulation.

“This is five elements divine lightning. The divine lightning contains the energy of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They can be called lightning metal energy, lightning wood energy, etc. Their destructive power is truly shocking.” Daoist Heavenly Feather suddenly spoke, “However, none of those is the important point...”

“Then what is the important point?”

Daoist Heavenly Feather smiled faintly but didn’t reply.

More and more lightning beasts descended, attacking Long Chen. There were various forms: dragons, phoenixes, elephants, and even one in the form of a giant tree. That giant tree unleashed rays of divine light that were like swords.

The lightning drakes roared and formed a giant barrier in front of Long Chen as they attacked these divine lightning beasts. However, while they had been capable of devouring the Ancient Heroic Spirits easily, these divine lightning beasts were fighting back, so it was much more difficult to eat them.

As they tore at the divine lightning beasts’ bodies, they devoured their energy. They were shocked to find that as they devoured them, their own energy rapidly grew.

“Kill them!” The lightning drakes went wild with ecstasy. In their eyes, these divine lightning beasts had transformed into giant pieces of succulent meat that they couldn’t resist.

As for Lei Long, it was also forced to participate in the battle. These lightning beasts were also very beneficial to it as they were no longer little seeds. They might not be rich pieces of meat, but they were at least appetizers.

Long Chen was protected behind them. The divine lightning beasts were unable to reach him.

However, True Immortal Jiaoqi and the others were thrown into disorder. These divine lightning beasts possessed the power to kill Netherpassage experts, and there was an endless number of them. These experts were forced to focus on them.

All of Heavenly Fate Island shook intensely. Their power was terrifying. The earth element divine lightning beasts in particular caused immense damage to the Heavenly Fate Platform. It looked like it might shatter at any moment.

The Unfettered Allseer’s old face was twitching. Now he regretted things. He had brought a wolf to his house and couldn’t chase it away. His face was green, but there was nothing he could do.

Long Chen’s tribulation was too terrifying. If he touched it, he would be sensed by the Heavenly Daos. Moreover, he wasn’t a Life Star disciple. If a Netherpassage expert were to suddenly enter, it would be like throwing oil into a stove. He would definitely die.

As for Life Star disciples, the only ones capable of enduring this terrifying tribulation were the ones that had already entered. Anyone else would die.

Perhaps the only one capable of tipping the scales was Zi Yan. However, Zi Yan was still calmly watching. Unfettered Allseer had tried reaching out to her several times, but she hadn’t responded.

He even secretly invited Hu Feng to go, but Hu Feng responded with silence, angering him.

He begged the heavens for help, but no help came. He begged the earth, but he got no response. Now that things had developed to this point, the only hope was for the four Fate Princes and the others to kill Long Chen.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen isn’t attacking. If he attacked them, he should be able to heavily injure them. Why isn’t he doing anything?” whispered one of the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

They could see that True Immortal Jiaoqi and the others were finding it difficult to handle the divine lightning beasts. As for Long Chen, he was just standing there, with no intention of attacking.

True Immortal Jiaoqi and the others hadn’t gone all-out yet, nor could they, as their trump cards would be exposed in front of Long Chen and the others. No one was so foolish as to do that. Some trump cards would be useless as long as their opponents knew about them. It was only when their opponents didn’t know about them would the trump cards have the most effect. This difference was especially important at their level, when the difference between them was so little that the slightest bit could decide victory or defeat.

Other than casually slapping True Immortal Jiaoqi’s face, Long Chen hadn’t attacked them. Others were unable to understand what he was thinking.

“You don’t understand just how terrifying this lightning tribulation is. Long Chen has to preserve his peak state to handle the last phases of the tribulation,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather. She actually answered that ordinary disciple.

“You mean... this isn’t the final wave?” asked the disciple.

“Of course not. Even someone as powerful as Long Chen will only have a slim chance of surviving this tribulation. If Long Chen isn’t attacking, it’s because he doesn’t dare to. Each bit of power can influence the final result. Long Chen won’t waste his energy killing them. Besides, True Immortal Jiaoqi and the others are capable of leaving if they sense danger because the tribulation is locked onto Long Chen. As long as they flee its range, the tribulation won’t bother them. As Empyreans, they are favored by the heavens. So ignoring whether or not Long Chen could kill them, if he tried, he would still end up dying to his own tribulation,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

People were shocked to hear this. Originally, they had felt that this would be the final wave. There had already been several waves, and the tribulation had already strengthened immensely. Did none of that matter?

“Master, Long Chen...” Ye Zhiqiu bit her lip.

“Foolish child, don’t try to deceive yourself. Do you think if I said he could pass, he would pass? Just keep watching.” Daoist Heavenly Feather held Ye Zhiqiu’s hand, shaking it.

After an hour, a streak of lightning lit up in the sky. It followed the same path as the first streak of lightning that had marked the start of the tribulation. Now that it was lighting up again, it formed a giant lightning gate. A terrifying apocalyptic pressure descended.

“Now is the real start.” Long Chen looked up and took a deep breath. Battle intent raged in his eyes as he looked at the lightning gate that was about the same size as all of Heavenly Fate Island.
