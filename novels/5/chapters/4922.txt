Chapter 4911: Restrained Fury

The devil corpse’s wings shook, blasting Long Chen, Mo Nian, the devil expert, and even the masked expert away. Both Mo Nian and the devil expert hacked up blood. Blood also dripped down the masked man’s silver mask

“Fools, you vainly tried to touch my ancestor’s remains! Just keep dreaming! You damn human bastards, all that awaits you all is death!” The devil expert laughed sinisterly even as he hacked up blood.

BOOM!

The devil corpse’s wings flapped, sending wild qi waves in every direction. Long Chen and the others didn’t even have a chance to stabilize their bodies before they were blasted away once again.

After the devil corpse went out of control, it started to regain its sense of self. All the runes binding it were exploding one by one, completely destroyed.

The devil runes on its surface started to glow intensely, almost burning with power. The potent Emperor’s might surged forth, evident in the Emperor fluctuations emanating from it.

As these fluctuations swept past Long Chen and the others, he shuddered, his soul quivering under immense pressure. It was as though the weight of an entire cosmos was bearing down on him, threatening to engulf him in its overwhelming force. He felt as though he might explode at any moment.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“How hateful. If it weren’t for their disturbance, this devil corpse would have been my puppet!” Mo Nian cursed furiously, staring at the devil corpse resentfully.

“You fools, you ruined everything!” The masked man also roared in response to Mo Nian’s curse, brimming with resentment. Just like Mo Nian, he wanted to control this corpse.

However, he had the right to feel more bitter than Mo Nian. After all, three generations of his family had worked hard to create today’s chance, but now, all those efforts had been in vain.

“Hahaha!” The devil expert raised his head and laughed in an insane manner. “When my ancestor revives, the first thing he’ll do is slaughter all of you dirty humans! Your blood will run like rivers!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the devil corpse turned and stamped on the ground, its enormous body vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Long Chen’s heart sank. “That direction…”

Mo Nian clenched his teeth. “It’s the exit of Heaven Screen Mountain…”

Long Chen took a deep breath and did his best to calm himself down. He said, “The devil corpse is out of control, so its number one priority is to go to Devil Fall City and get its head. We have to go and see if there’s still any chance for us to help.”

Mo Nian nodded. That was the only thing they could do. As he hadn’t held up his end of the bargain, he was incredibly depressed. In all his years, it was his first time feeling so useless.

Long Chen and Mo Nian instantly shot off. Seeing them fly away, the masked man shouted, “Remember, it’s all your fault! If the devil corpse kills anyone, the blood is on you.”

“Fuck you!” Mo Nian cursed furiously. Even now, this fellow was trying to push the responsibility onto them.

This fellow’s number one goal had been to use the devil corpse to slaughter people, yet he dared to blame them? Mo Nian felt unprecedented killing intent rising in him.

Long Chen grasped Mo Nian’s arm firmly, signaling that now wasn’t the time to dwell on the masked man. With a cold tone, Long Chen issued a stern warning, “Listen well. If someone does die because of the devil corpse, it doesn’t matter whether you flee to heaven or hell, I will find you and kill you. No one can protect you.”

The two of them then rushed off. Following that, they heard a scream from the devil expert. Most likely, the masked man was taking out his wrath on him. The masked man seemed to have been concealing his power. Once the two of them left, he immediately dealt a serious wound to the devil expert.

The devil expert’s aura quickly vanished into the distance, and when Long Chen and Mo Nian looked back, the masked man was also gone. They didn’t know if he had gone off to pursue the devil expert or somewhere else.

“That masked man isn’t ordinary. He’s incredibly sinister to be able to even con me,” grumbled Mo Nian.

“It doesn’t count as a con. He had three generations of his family helping him. They made their move countless years ago, so don’t bother too much about it. What we need to do is think of a way to deal with the devil corpse,” replied Long Chen solemnly.

Mo Nian gritted his teeth and fell silent. What should have been a sure thing had been ruined. He had long since lost his cool and couldn’t think of any good methods.

Long Chen was the same. Things were progressing to the worst-case scenario—the worst case that could not be worse. No matter how Long Chen tried to think of something, he ended up with a blank mind.

Both of them knew there was no way they could catch up to the corpse. Once the corpse escaped Heaven Screen Mountain, it would immediately charge over to Devil Fall City to merge with its head.

The Square Heaven Seal had been infected by devil qi and could no longer suppress the devil head. Once they merged, a calamity would befall the city, and perhaps the entire human race would have to face a great tribulation.

Even though the two of them were peak heavenly geniuses, they both felt useless, so they remained silent as they chased. As the surrounding spatial fluctuations weren't that intense anymore, Long Chen took out a formation disc.

The two of them didn’t follow the devil corpse directly. Instead, they flew perpendicular to its path, avoiding the chaotic fluctuations it left in its wake. Only after putting some distance between themselves and the devil corpse were they able to activate a transportation formation.

The transportation formation also couldn’t chase straight after it, so they had to go around. If they ended up on the same path as the corpse, the transportation would fail, and they might get sucked into the chaotic flow of space. Who knew where they would end up then?

Long Chen and Mo Nian quickly carried out one transportation after another. While Long Chen carried out the transportations, Mo Nian calculated the exact landing spots. After dozens of consecutive transportations, the two of them were left dazed by the powerful spatial force. However, the heaven screen had reappeared before them.

Both of their hearts tightened as they rushed forward and saw the exit. Originally, they were holding onto a trace of hope that they had gotten here first. However, when they saw a giant hole in the heaven screen, they knew they were one step too late. The devil corpse had charged out before them.

The barrier had lost all significance after being smashed by the devil corpse. The giant hole left behind still bore traces of devil qi, corroding its protective power. The boundary between the laws governing the inside and outside world was blurring. It wouldn’t be long before this place became accessible to anyone, allowing free entry and exit.

When Long Chen and Mo Nian rushed out of the barrier, Long Chen’s eyes suddenly brightened. “It has just run out! Quick, chase!”

BOOM!

Just then, they heard an immense explosion and saw a giant violet-gold seal fill the sky. Violet gold light descended, trapping the devil corpse.

“It’s Big Brother Wujiang!”

Long Chen and Mo Nian cried out excitedly and immediately rushed over in that direction.
