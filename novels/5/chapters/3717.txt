Chapter 3706 Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire

Long Chen decided to just put away the rest of the wares and go with Yu Qingxuan. He wanted to call over Guo Ran and Xia Chen, but he had no idea where they had run off to.

Pushing through the crowd, Long Chen quickly saw several female disciples of the Vermilion Bird Empire surrounded by a group of people.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s people.” Yu Qingxuan’s expression changed slightly.

“What kind of people are they?” asked Long Chen.

“An empire that’s not very powerful, and while our relationship with them isn’t good, we don’t have much enmity. However, for some reason, they’ve started targeting us in the last few years. I just returned to the Vermilion Bird Empire, so I’m not too clear on many of the empire’s matters. I can recognize what empire they’re from due to their robes and tablets,” said Yu Qingxuan.

“Then what do you want to do? Do you want to fight?” asked Long Chen.

“I don’t know. I have never dealt with something like this. Sorry, it would be better if Eunuch Wei was here,” said Yu Qingxuan. Eunuch Wei wasn’t completely useless.

“I don’t mind how you deal with it. But as long as anyone dares to be the slightest bit rude to you, I won’t be courteous either,” said Long Chen, saying the ugly words first to avoid being blamed when a fight occurred.

Long Chen would only have one way to deal with such a matter, and that was to fight, fight until the other side was searching the ground for their teeth, fight until the other side was on the ground begging for mercy.

“Haha, the girls of the Vermilion Bird Empire are up to par. What? Are you not going to give us any face after inviting you to some wine?” A fair-faced man with a folded fan in his hand and a crown on his head smiled at the disciples that they had surrounded. His gaze was completely lecherous.

He wore extravagant robes and had a golden tablet on his waist. It seemed that his status was extraordinary. He had dozens of experts by his side, all of them peak Divine Lords with powerful auras.

Having surrounded a few female disciples of the Vermilion Bird Empire, these perverts were examining them in a completely unrestrained fashion. Their gazes were extremely provoking.

Because of the commotion, quite a few people had come to see what was happening. As for others, they put away their wares and hid in the distance. The people from these empires couldn’t be provoked.

“With this kind of morality, how will you represent the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire? For you to be so overbearing, are you not placing our Vermilion Bird Empire in your eyes?” One of the women from the Vermilion Bird Empire coldly replied.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan had arrived and spotted them in the distance. The speaking woman was Yin Ting. She was also the one to ask him to teach them how to haggle.

Yin Ting was naturally lively, and her eloquence wasn’t bad. She instantly accused these people of provoking the Vermilion bird Empire.

“No, no. The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire has a good relationship with the Vermilion Bird Empire. With such a close relationship, why would we not place the Vermilion Bird Empire in our eyes? Since our empires are so friendly, we should forge a stronger bond, don’t you think? We can drink and talk. Don’t you think that’s suitable?” The crowned man laughed, the very picture of a hedonistic young master.

Although he said that the relationship between both empires was good, his eyes were full of disdain for them. He had clearly come to cause trouble.

Yin Ting sneered, “Drinking wine naturally doesn’t count for anything. However, people should know themselves. Are you not aware that your appearance is such that not even your grandmother would kiss you? I’m disgusted just looking at you. If we were to drink wine, I wouldn’t even have time to spit it out before vomiting. If you don’t want trouble, then get away from us. Our princess is right nearby.”

“Your princess? That wild princess of unclear origins? What a joke. Even if she personally came, I wouldn’t place her in my eyes,” sneered the crowned man disdainfully.

“Impudent!”

“So what? What can you do? Are you going to personally try to kill me?” asked the crowned man as if taunting her.

The other experts of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire also laughed and tightened their enclosure. They didn’t take out weapons, nor did they leak any killing intent, but they were intentionally getting closer to the girls, leaving them nowhere to escape.

If they didn’t attack, Yin Ting and the other girls also couldn’t attack. If they did, it would become a diplomatic issue between both empires, and they were unable to take responsibility for such a matter.

Despite that, as they were women, having these men get so close to them was naturally making them uncomfortable. Yin Ting was enraged. She had the urge to slaughter all of them, but she didn’t dare to. She was simply waiting for Yu Qingxuan to arrive.

“Killing you would be up to my mood. But if you ask for a beating so badly, we’ll see if I settle for just a beating.” Just then, an arrogant and domineering voice rang out.

Hearing this, Yin Ting and the others were delighted. They instantly recognized Long Chen’s voice. As expected, just as they heard him, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan walked in shoulder to shoulder.

“Oh? Is this the princess that the Vermilion Bird Empire suddenly produced? I heard that no one knows where you came from. It caused quite the ruckus in the Vermilion Bird Empire!” The crowned man’s eyes brightened when he saw Yu Qingxuan, and he laughed delightedly. He completely ignored Long Chen.

“My Vermilion Bird Empire doesn’t want trouble, but we’re not afraid of trouble. Have your people leave, otherwise…” demanded Yu Qingxuan.

“Otherwise what?” sneered the crowned man. His gaze brazenly roved around Yu Qingxuan’s body.

Pow!

Suddenly, Long Chen’s palm slapped his face, unleashing an explosive sound. That crowned man was directly blown apart into blood mist. Even his Yuan Spirit was blasted apart, let alone his body.

Everyone was shocked. The other experts of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire were completely dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

“Long Chen, you…!”

Even Yu Qingxuan jumped in shock. Long Chen had said that if they continued to cause trouble, he would give them a beating. But they couldn’t be killed because this matter related to the diplomatic relationship between the two empires. Hence, no rash moves could be made.

However, Long Chen had directly slain their leader, stunning Yu Qingxuan.

“Sorry… It seems that I went a bit too hard.” Long Chen looked at his own hand as well as the scattered blood mist. He was embarrassed.

In truth, the moment the crowned man’s gaze roved around Yu Qingxuan’s body like that, Long Chen’s fury exploded. How could he possibly restrain his power like that?

“You… you… you dared to kill our young master Peng Ao!? Are you trying to start a war between our empires?!” shouted one of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s people.

Long Chen waved his hand. This time, his hand didn’t strike anything, and an arrow already pierced through that person’s head.

“You dare to wave your claws in front of my boss? Are you tired of living?”

Just then, Guo Ran and Xia Chen came over. Guo Ran fearlessly looked over the crowd, appearing as if he thought himself completely unrivaled.
