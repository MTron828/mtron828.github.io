Chapter 3972 Despicably Shameless

“You want to play schemes?!”

The other Long Chen roared, but it was too late for him to dodge. Long Chen had long since prepared this and didn’t give him any chance to do as he wished.

BOOM!

As the bronze cauldron slammed down, flames and lightning weaved into a barrier around its mouth, trapping the other Long Chen inside the bronze cauldron.

“Long Chen, you are despicable and shameless!” The other Long Chen roared from within the bronze cauldron. He then tried to charge out of the cauldron, but it didn’t budge in the slightest. Even with all his power, he was unable to cause a ripple in the cauldron.

“Hehe, no, no, this isn’t called shamelessness. It is returning to my true self. Isn’t that what you just taught me? A person should live happily and as they please, right? Isn’t that what you said? Why are you so hypocritical?” laughed Long Chen.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the bronze cauldron flipped over. Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s power erupted as they kept the seal on.

“You wish to seal me?! Keep dreaming!”

BOOM!

With a crazed roar, a powerful explosion erupted and the seal composed of Huo Linger and Lei Linger’s power cracked, almost breaking.

It had to be known that Long Chen had been planning this for several days. In order to be sure of success, he had had the two of them accumulate all their power. They didn’t hold back in the slightest. However, the other Long Chen was just too powerful. Even all their powers combined were unable to contain him for long.

BOOM!

Just then, the cauldron’s lid slammed shut, sealing the cauldron for good. Most cauldrons didn’t have a lid, but this bronze cauldron did.

When the lid slammed shut, a furious roar came from within the cauldron. “Long Chen, just you wait! Next time, I won’t waste words with you! I will directly take control of that body! Just you wait!”

“You are so boring. When I am bright and kind, you call me fake. When I am sinister and treacherous, you call me despicably shameless. You say that you are the true me, but I don’t believe it. We are two sides of the same person. Time will prove everything.”

“This cauldron isn’t something that you can control! You cannot seal me forever! It won’t be long before I’m out, and when I do, I will properly settle this debt with you!” roared the other Long Chen.

“Calm yourself. I wasn’t planning on sealing you forever anyway. Even so, you can be a thief for a thousand days in a row, but you can’t be on guard against a thief for a thousand days in a row. If I’m always on guard against you, it would be too tiring. It just so happens that I could use a vacation. I’ll relax, and once I’m in top condition, we can fight once more.” Long Chen smiled brightly.

“Just you wait! You will pay a price for your foolishness!” The other Long Chen roared and then fell silent.

Long Chen examined the bronze cauldron. The lid fit seamlessly without the slightest gap anywhere, but he could still sense dark energy slowly oozing out from between the lid and the cauldron.

Long Chen knew that this was his heart-devil’s power. Just as his heart-devil said, although Long Chen had sealed him inside the cauldron, Long Chen could not truly control it, so this could not be a perfect seal.

The heart-devil’s power was constantly escaping. Sooner or later, he would escape.

However, that was a matter for the future. At least, in the near future, he wouldn’t have to worry about his heart-devil causing trouble. It could be said that this plan had gone off perfectly.

When Huo Linger and Lei Linger returned to the primal chaos space, Long Chen’s heart shook. In that brief moment, their cores were badly damaged by the attack of his heart-devil.

That shocked him. It had to be known that he hadn’t given his heart-devil any time to accumulate power. In other words, that had been nothing more than an ordinary attack.

However, even such an ordinary attack could damage Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s cores. That was something that Long Chen was not capable of.

Fortunately, he had won by outsmarting his heart-devil. If they were to truly fight, even with the dragon race’s divine abilities, Long Chen really would have no assurance in beating him.

“Fuck, why does he grow so quickly? He doesn’t even have to do anything, but his power keeps climbing! That’s so unfair!” cursed Long Chen.

Even so, having resolved the danger of his heart-devil allowed Long Chen to relax temporarily. Within this endless darkness, he felt an indescribable peace as if the darkness was his home. Here, his heart was at peace.

“Not bad. You’ve temporarily dealt with your heart-devil. Now, you can peacefully focus on researching the Seven Star Battle Armor without worrying about him taking control when you are weakened.” The dragon expert’s voice rang out in his mind.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Senior, I’ve already thought of hundreds of possibilities. Can I try condensing a new Seven Star Battle Armor now?” asked Long Chen, excited to hear the dragon expert’s opinion.

Long Chen had been itching to start testing the new Seven Star Battle Armor, but the dragon expert hadn’t said anything all this time, so he hadn’t dared to mess around.

“Your current power is not enough. My suggestion is that you wait until you reach three thousand dragon power before condensing the Seven Star Battle Armor. That way, the risk will be at its lowest. You know what kind of luck you have. You can’t hope to live off of luck, so you must make progress slowly and steadily.”

“What is three thousand dragon power?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s a power measuring scale of the dragon race, and some ancient inheritances continue to use this standard. There is such a standard in the Vermilion Bird Empire as well. When you have time, you can go test yourself and you’ll know,” said the dragon expert.

After saying that, the dragon expert fell silent. Long Chen tried asking several questions, but there was no response. It was as if it had cut off their connection.

Long Chen didn’t mind this. In any case, he had resolved the greatest crisis right now, so he felt much more relaxed.

He took out a bed, and just like that, started sleeping in the little black room. The days that he had to live with a heart devil were very tough. It was a constant strain on his mind, a constant pressure on his spirit. He had to be constantly wary of his heart-devil influencing him. Thus, it had been a long time since he had properly slept, without the constant fear of being invaded by his heart-devil in his dreams.

With his heart-devil sealed, he could finally sleep in peace. He entered a land of dreams as soon as his head hit the pillow.

Inside the palace, Yu Xiaoyun and the others didn’t see the heart-devil. It was only when Long Chen put away the heart-devil that the mirror revealed the situation in the little black room. At that time, Long Chen was already sleeping peacefully.

The three of them stared at each other, not knowing what had just happened. But Long Chen was sleeping peacefully in the little black room now, looking so sweet and peaceful.

Long Chen then slept for three days and nights. In his dreams, he was in the Martial Heaven Continent. He saw his father, his mother, and his little sister. His whole family ate together. After that, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, Zi Yan, Liu Ruyan, and the others joined them as well.

Long Chen was so excited that he switched out the table for an even bigger one. Just as they sat down, a gate opened and divine light spilled forth, illuminating two figures. Although he couldn’t see their faces, Long Chen still cried out, “Dad, Mom!”

A pair of warm hands caressed his cheeks. Long Chen then wept, holding onto those hands.

“Mom, do you know how much your child misses you? I always see you in my dreams. But when I wake up, you’re gone. Can you not leave me this time?”

All of a sudden, Long Chen woke up, only to be greeted by an intense brightness that rendered him unable to pry his eyes open. As his vision gradually cleared, he was disappointed to not see his parents, but Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin.

So, the bright light in his dream came from the opening of the little black room, its intense light illuminating his face. Ultimately, dreams were nothing more than illusions, destined to be shattered as one inevitably woke from their slumber.
