Chapter 3502

The Starry River Palace was located in the Violet Flame Heaven. It was once a glorious major sect, but all that remained was ruins.

However, the name of the Starry River of the Sky Art still drew countless people over. In the immortal world, the Starry River of the Sky Art was no secret. Many ancient sects had records of it.

Even so, the Starry River of the Sky Art had many versions, and they were essentially all incomplete. Many had the start but no end. After cultivating it to a certain extent, there was no continuing it.

The High Firmament Academy had the most complete Starry River of the Sky Art, but Long Chen had looked over it and found many areas that didn’t match. There was no way to link them all together.

For this matter, he had gone to ask Bai Letian, only to learn that the Starry River of the Sky Art was extremely mysterious, and only portions of it had appeared in the world. Thus, no one had a full version.

As for the different versions of the Starry River of the Sky Art in the hands of the major forces, in truth, they were also true versions. But their opinions differed, and no one could say which version was definitely right or definitely wrong.

As long as someone was capable of cultivating it, then it proved that this cultivation technique was correct. As for their future path, they would need to comprehend it themselves. If they couldn’t comprehend it, they could only switch cultivation techniques.

However, switching their cultivation technique would use up a huge amount of time and effort. It could even cause problems in their foundation. Thus, the academy did not encourage disciples to cultivate the Starry River of the Sky Art.

Furthermore, the Starry River of the Sky Art was too domineering, and it was like walking along the edge of a sword. There were countless dangers, and the majority of those who cultivated it didn’t have good endings.

Those who managed to cultivate it did benefit at the start, but by the middle or end, their paths were severed. They were unable to continue any longer. Ultimately, they could only go back and choose a new cultivation technique.

Thus, the academy treated the Starry River of the Sky Art as taboo. After all, cultivating it was far too dangerous and didn’t bring many benefits. It wasn’t worth it.

However, Long Chen had been in the ruins of the Starry River Sect, so he knew that the Starry River of the Sky Art was related to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. The Starry River Sage had created an entirely new path with this cultivation technique.

The Starry River Sect was founded by the Starry River Sage’s greatest disciple, Li Xinghe. Furthermore, this Starry River Palace was also a place for cultivating the Starry River of the Sky Art. It hooked Long Chen’s curiosity.

When he arrived at the ruins of the Starry River Palace, Long Chen found that this place wasn’t as empty as he had expected. People were coming and going, and there were always more people entering. It seemed that Long Chen wasn’t the only one drawn over here by its reputation.

Furthermore, it wasn’t just the human race. There were other lifeforms as well. However, they didn’t seem too friendly. They always looked at humans with sideways glances.

This place was no longer the Yu Prefecture. It was once more a lawless place, so fights often erupted here. People had long since grown accustomed to it.

When Long Chen entered the ruins, he finally saw an intact building. Moreover, this building had a statue. When he saw it, he instantly recognized it to be the Starry River Sage.

There were words carved into the base of the statue. It seemed that there was a formation protecting the words, making it impossible to see what was written.

There were also nine stone steps in front of the statue. There were many experts here, pointing at the steps and discussing things.

Long Chen’s arrival didn’t draw any attention. Everyone’s attention was on the stone steps.

When Long Chen got close, he found that every step was carved with characters. There were also some fragmentary star diagrams.

Quite a few experts were sitting before the stone steps, meditating on those characters and diagrams.

“Second generation Jiuli immortal characters?”

Long Chen was surprised when he saw those characters. He didn’t even fully recognize third generation Jiuli immortal characters, let alone second generation ones. However, from their auras, Long Chen could guess what they meant.

“Human, get further away. I don’t like your scent.”

Long Chen had just gotten close to the stone steps when a horned lifeform looked at Long Chen with disgust.

Long Chen’s response was a slap in the face, and this unlucky lifeform smashed into the distant ruins, causing dust to explode. Everyone was startled.

That lifeform possessed a startling Blood Qi and was very tyrannical. Although it wasn’t to the point that everyone was afraid of him, no one wished to provoke him.

“What is an animal here for? What are you pretending to comprehend? As if you could understand anything,” sneered Long Chen disdainfully.

“Damn human race, you are courting death!”

That lifeform was enraged. He came flying out of the ruins, just about to fight to the death with Long Chen, when Long Chen kicked a fist-sized rock at him.

BOOM!

The rock smashed into his teeth and entered his mouth. He passed out.

“Brat, are you provoking my demonic beast race?” A large and muscular expert came out of the crowd, glaring at Long Chen. By calling that person an animal, Long Chen was essentially insulting the entire demonic beast race. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

That person’s Blood Qi unfurled and his body rumbled. It was like there was a volcano within him containing endless power.

However, this lifeform had no particular marks on him to show which race he was from. Based on the pressure that he exuded though, he definitely wasn’t a good character to provoke.

“I really dislike hearing that. If you feel like I’m provoking you, then just attack. Don’t be so wishy-washy. Boss Long San has seen plenty of demons, devils, and ghosts before. If you want to fight, then come at me. Don’t waste your saliva.” Long Chen didn’t even glance at that person, instead walking to the steps.

“Don’t-!” When people saw him raise his foot to climb the step, they cried out.

The runes on the step beneath Long Chen’s feet suddenly lit up. As a result, Long Chen felt an immense force rise out from below, and a certain star amongst his 108,000 stars was quivering.

Long Chen instantly felt like some power above the heavens was quivering with it. When that energy quivered, the air grew tranquil. The other experts present all stared in shock at Long Chen.

It had to be known that everyone else who stepped onto the stairs would be blasted off, blood pouring out of their seven orifices. Some people were even directly killed. Thus, some people kindly warned him not to when they saw him try.

Following that, Long Chen stepped onto the second stair, and it lit up. This time, Long Chen took note of three stars quivering amongst the 108,000 stars. Furthermore, above the nine heavens, he sensed three stars in some area sensing him.

Long Chen then stepped onto the next stair. This time, nine stars lit up in his body. At the same time, from a distant star-field, he sensed nine different locations resonating with him.

Long Chen continued all the way to the ninth stair. In front of countless dumbfounded gazes, a starry diagram appeared up in the sky, illuminating all the ruins.

“This is…!”

Everyone was shocked, staring in disbelief at that star diagram. Someone then cried out emotionally.

“I understand, I understand! This is the legendary manifestation, Starry River Hangs in the Sky!”

When that person said this, countless people almost exploded with excitement.
