Chapter 3472 Preparing to Leave

It didn’t matter what kind of storm came, the sun would always rise the next day. That warm and peaceful light seemed to be the greatest medicine for everyone.

Sunlight was called the blessing of the heavens. It was a selfless gift. As long as you wanted it, you could have it.

Long Chen lay on a barren hill. Ignoring the dust on the ground, he languidly soaked in the sun.

“Long Chen, you really are the same as on the Martial Heaven Continent. Fortunately, the immortal world is big enough, otherwise, there might not be enough for you to play with.” Zheng Wenlong sat down beside Long Chen, sighing emotionally.

He felt like the celebration of the seventh branch academy’s reconstruction had just happened yesterday. So when he saw the wreckage, he almost didn’t dare to believe his eyes.

“Life exists in playing around. If I didn’t play around, it would be a waste of life. It’s just like your business. Aren’t you playing around with making money? But this time, don’t worry, I have as much money and treasures as you need. You just need to help me gather everything.” Long Chen still had his eyes closed and was enjoying the sun.

The crisis at the seventh branch academy had been settled. The devil sea had calmed, the passage to the devil world was gone, and the gate to the Undying World was also closed. The Heavenly Swell Domain had returned to its normal appearance.

It was now a clear day after the storm. Although rebuilding the seventh branch academy would take quite a bit of manpower and materials, Long Chen wasn’t lacking money.

“Alright, then let’s continue playing around. I really must thank you. Quite a few powers inside the Integral Heaven Star-Field have reached out to us to purchase vast quantities of medicinal pills. Furthermore, all that business is counted as mine. My authority is also rising within the Huayun Trading Company. You don’t need to worry about the academy’s reconstruction,” said Zheng Wenlong.

Long Chen nodded. After a moment’s thought, he handed Zheng Wenlong all the Wood Foundation Divine Fruit.

Zheng Wenlong jumped in shock. These Wood Foundation Divine Fruit went from the second generation all the way to the ninth generation. There was no way to calculate their value.

With this, Zheng Wenlong also knew where the problem lay. He was moved. Long Chen had essentially shared a heaven-shaking secret with him by giving him this fruit.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Zheng Wenlong put the fruit away and immediately set off. Once he was gone, Long Chen continued to lie on the ground. He grew lazier and lazier as he basked in the sunlight until he actually fell asleep.

Suddenly, Long Chen smiled. He didn’t open his eyes, but he could smell a nice fragrance. He already knew who had come.

“It’s good for people to soak in some sunlight. Are you afraid of tanning?” Long Chen opened one eye and saw Bai Shishi sitting beside him under a paper parasol.

Today’s Bai Shishi was wearing a rare white dress. She looked like a hibiscus just breaking out of the water, holy and sacred. There was a natural beauty within that simplicity.

“You’re already dark enough. Whether or not you tan, it makes no difference. I just don’t like the sunlight.” Bai Shishi took out an elegant beast hide pad for herself to sit on. She didn’t just lay on the dirty ground like Long Chen.

“Sunlight is the most selfless thing. She is never stingy with her warmth. However, no matter how bright the sunlight is, it cannot shine on the shadows in the dark. Sometimes we must be the ones to change our angle and allow the sunlight to enter- aiya!” Long Chen suddenly felt a sharp pain in his waist.

“Are you cursing me for having a dark inside?” Bai Shishi glared at him.

“What? Can you be a bit reasonable? I was talking about us. It’s not like I directly pointed at you,” said Long Chen, irritably aggrieved.

Seeing his angry state, Bai Shishi suddenly chuckled. Her pearly white teeth were revealed, making her appear even more beautiful.

Long Chen’s heart was moved. Bai Shishi was already very beautiful, but this laugh made even Long Chen’s previous vexation vanish in an instant. Beauty could easily make a person forget all their vexations.

Long Chen hastily turned his face away from her. Bai Shishi couldn’t help asking, “Did you get a guilty conscience?”

“What guilty conscience? Don’t use your beauty to seduce me! Let me tell you, boss San won’t fall for the carrot or stick, but I will fall for this,” said Long Chen.

Bai Shishi laughed. He had sounded so righteous until he exposed his true character at the end, furthermore, he exposed it so frankly.

Using beauty to seduce someone? That was far beneath Bai Shishi, but Long Chen somehow made it sound as if he was praising her beauty.

Although Bai Shishi was naturally beautiful, she didn’t particularly care about other people’s praise toward her looks. It was only Long Chen’s praise that she liked to hear.

“Do you know? I’m a bit angry,” said Bai Shishi.

“What are you angry about? Can you have some… ah, nothing.” Long Chen was about to ask if she could have some common sense, as she had been the one to pinch him, so why would she be the angry one? But that seemed to be a bit rude, so he swallowed those words.

“Of course I’m angry. You’re so powerful, but you didn’t tell me. When I think about how I… ugh, I want to die from embarrassment. You’re a swindler.”

Bai Shishi turned red. She thought of how she had held his hand before and said that even when she was stronger than him, she would do her best to listen to him. Just thinking about it vexed and embarrassed her. It was a sickening feeling.

Back then, she had just passed through her tribulation and started to merge with the inheritance of the master of the golden sword. Her power had risen to a level she herself had never dared to imagine. Hence, she had thought that in the future, she would far surpass Long Chen.

In order to avoid Long Chen feeling bad, she had intentionally said those words. She hadn’t expected that in this battle, Long Chen would reveal an even more terrifying combat power. In the end, he even slew Jia Luo, shocking everyone.

“That? Tch, what is so great about that? I really am not as strong as you. When I killed Jia Luo at the end, it was only because of that divine weapon. If you had that divine weapon, you also could have killed Jia Luo,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Long Chen, what kind of divine weapon is that? Can you show it to me?” asked Bai Shishi curiously.

“Of course. But you cannot touch its edge.” Long Chen looked around, and seeing no one else, he carefully took out the dagger.

“Why is this seemingly ordinary dagger so amazing?” Bai Shishi examined it for a long time without noticing anything extraordinary about it. She then returned it to Long Chen.

Long Chen put it away and told her how he had found it, almost dying in the process. Long Chen also didn’t know the origin of this dagger, but he knew that it was the most terrifying divine weapon that he had encountered up to now.

Jia Luo’s armor had a Divine Venerate’s blessing, and an ordinary World King was unable to even approach him in that state. But this dagger had completely ignored that armor. It could be seen just how terrifying it was.

“Long Chen, what are you thinking of doing next?” asked Bai Shishi.

“Once the academy is repaired, I might be leaving the Darklight Heaven. I need to do something important.”

An image of a mirror appeared in Long Chen’s mind. Long Chen then saw countless spots of light within the mirror, and they had auras just like his.
