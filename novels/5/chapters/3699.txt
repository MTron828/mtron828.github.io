Chapter 3688 Treasure Tree’s Clever Use

In just a short time, the primal chaos space had undergone a huge transformation. Long Chen almost didn’t recognize it.

The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree that had been on the edge of the primal chaos space had actually run over to the black soil at the very core of the primal chaos space.

Furthermore, the pile of corpses on the black soil was also gone, and the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree had gone from three feet tall to thirty feet tall.

At this moment, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree was shining brightly. Its body was translucent like it was made of colored glass, and the rainbow leaves on the crown sprinkled divine light from above. That light then transformed into a milky white halo of light around it. Due to that, the black soil even turned white from its light.

The black soil was filled with death energy. But the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree forcibly took over this black soil, forming a white land.

The giant black soil space was now split in half, half black and half white. Looking at it from above, Long Chen was shocked to find that it actually formed the symbol of the Taiji diagram.

The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree was now on opposite ends of the Heavenly Dao Tree. The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree emitted holy light, while the Heavenly Dao Tree contained the black energy of death. The two forces opposed each other, as if they were competing over who was stronger.

The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree was clearly much smaller than the Heavenly Dao Tree. However, it still managed to forcibly occupy half of the Heavenly Dao Tree’s territory, taking over its own part of the black soil.

Long Chen then stopped in front of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. Suddenly, two figures flew out from its crown. Lei Linger and Huo Linger had transformed into two small dragons.

“Big brother Long Chen, we like this tree. It’s part of our family too,” exclaimed Lei Linger.

“I feel like I’m growing as long as I stay beside it. But I can’t tell how exactly I’m growing. However, I definitely like it!” added Huo Linger excitedly.

Long Chen was startled. This Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree was also called the Seven Treasure Ingenuity Tree, the Tree of Wisdom, and the Bodhi Tree. It was an existence from the primal chaos era, a legendary divine tree. It was said that an almighty existence had turned it into their companion divine entity, placing their spiritual mark on it, which allowed them to share the same longevity as the tree. 

However, even in the legends, there wasn’t much information about the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. No one knew how to use it.

When Long Chen arrived next to the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, the divine light of the tree fell upon him and his body quivered. Bathed within this light, he felt like he was receiving a mental cleansing. A kind of energy was coursing through his body.

Long Chen felt every bit of stress leave him. This energy wasn’t very powerful, but it was constant and consistent. At the same time, a strange ripple seemed to come from the tree, and the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree’s image appeared in his mind.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s mind retreated from the primal chaos space. But what came with him was the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree.

“Boss…”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were beside Long Chen. They were in the midst of studying some runes on a piece of paper when the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree suddenly appeared, making them both jump.

When they recognized it to be the very tree that the patriarch had just given Long Chen, they were even more shocked. How did it grow so fast?

The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree emitted its rainbow light, enveloping all three of them. Guo Ran and Xia Chen instantly felt their bodies relax. A holy energy was cleansing their bodies.

All of a sudden, the runes on Guo Ran’s right arm lit up. At the same time, specks of light appeared within his body. Those were the runes that Xia Chen had placed in his body.

“I understand!”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran both cried out at the same time. When the divine light enveloped them, it was as if their heads were anointed with the cream of enlightenment. They instantly understood countless principles.

The runes on the sheet that they had been studying were the runes for Guo Ran’s arm. They had been studying them for a long time without any worthwhile accomplishments. But the two of them had experience in this regard. They were determined and always pushed through these kinds of obstacles slowly over constant study.

At this moment, the roadblock in their way instantly became simple, and the areas that they hadn’t understood grew clear. In an instant, they decided where to put several runes.

Suddenly, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree vanished, returning to the primal chaos space as if everything had been an illusion.

As a result, Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s expressions changed. They hastily began to write as fast as they could, putting down many ideas onto paper. They were afraid that their ideas would also become an illusion.

However, they quickly realized that this was no illusion. It was real. They looked at Long Chen in disbelief. The moment the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree appeared, it was as if inspiration simply gushed out of a spring. But now, everything had returned to normal.

“Boss, did you obtain a treasure this time? Don’t be stingy! Bring it out so that we can continue researching the Supreme Bone’s runes,” cried Guo Ran excitedly.

That one moment had been equivalent to almost a month of work from them. This fellow instantly got addicted to the sweet taste.

Long Chen now understood why the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree was also known as the Tree of Wisdom, a miniature version of the Heavenly Daos. The tree was a mirror reflecting the ten thousand Daos and laws.

Previously, Long Chen hadn’t felt much. He had only felt that its divine light could increase the function of his mind and make him feel very comfortable. With that, he could fully relax and enter a state of empty spirit.

But somehow, he had summoned the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. He still didn’t feel anything, but these two had a huge reaction to it.

“Boss, don’t just stare! Summon it again and let us benefit!” urged Guo Ran.

“How? It refuses to come out, so what am I supposed to do?” demanded Long Chen irritably.

At this time, Long Chen found that the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree had his spiritual mark on it. It was just like his weapon.

However, no matter how he tried to commune with it, it refused to budge. His soul could enter the primal chaos space, and the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree would continue to nourish him with its light, but he couldn’t bring it out.

“Is it maybe out of energy?”

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. Seeing that he still had a decent stock of corpses saved, he tossed them in with a thought. After that, he found that when these corpses landed in the black soil, they were all devoured in just a few breaths’ time. They transformed into an enormous amount of life energy that flooded the primal chaos space.

The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree began to absorb this life energy and continued growing. Long Chen suddenly looked at the Heavenly Dao Tree in the black soil. He patted its trunk and sighed.

“It’s been hard on you. You’ve had to do so much, and you even had your territory occupied.”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Heavenly Dao Tree was essentially working to feed the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, yet the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree just barged into its territory. That was unfair to the Heavenly Dao Tree.

However, the Heavenly Dao Tree simply stood there, silent. It seemed to be a lifeform with no consciousness and could only act instinctively.

Long Chen used up all the corpses he had, and the black soil only took two hours to absorb them all. It seemed that the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree’s power had grown.

When the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree was summoned by Long Chen once more, Guo Ran and Xia Chen cried out in excitement. They fervently jotted down their new ideas.
