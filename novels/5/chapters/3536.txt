Chapter 3525

The aura of Feng Xiang’s father erupted. In front of him, Feng Xiang was as tiny as an ant. The latter didn’t even dare to move. He could only stare in shock and terror at his father.

His father looked at him coldly. “If you weren’t my son, I would kill you right now. You fool, twice you didn’t understand my intentions. I sacrificed my face to give you an opportunity, and you wasted it. You treated it as nothing more than wind blowing past your ear. Do you know that these two opportunities were for you to form a good relationship with Long Chen? You failed twice, so how could I entrust the Dragon Blaze Prefecture to a fool like you? How could I leave the Feng family to you? If you continued offending Long Chen, let alone you, even the entire Feng family would be dragged in.”

Feng Xiang stared at his father in shock. Although Long Chen seemed a bit different from others, he had never displayed his true power. Furthermore, he didn’t give off much pressure. As a result, Feng Xiang had never felt him to be very powerful.

Long Chen looked like someone who relied on his face and mouth to con others. Hence, Feng Xiang hadn’t expected his father, a grand seventh Heavenstage World King, to be so afraid of Long Chen.

“I told you to read more, study more, but you just kept hanging out with a group of scoundrels. The way you brag and laud each other makes me turn red just by hearing it. Do you know the history of the High Firmament Academy? Do you know why the High Firmament Academy declined? Do you know why the High Firmament Academy is now down to only their main academy when their branches were once spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands? Do you know what it signifies for Long Chen to be the youngest dean of the High Firmament Academy? Do you know who the High Firmament Academy’s opponent is? You don’t know anything! Yet you think yourself infallible. You are so foolish that no medicine can cure you. After today, I will tell everyone that you have been stripped of your status as the son of the city lord. You are now expelled from the Feng family. Starting today, all of your actions have nothing to do with my Feng family,” said the city lord coldly.

“Father…!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Feng Xiang was struck dumb. He hadn’t expected his father to be so ruthless. He actually expelled him from the Feng family.

Feng Xiang then fell to the ground as if he had lost all his bones. Looking at his father, he felt like he was in a nightmare. He didn’t dare to believe this.

“Do you see? After you lose your status as the son of the city lord, you are nothing. Let alone going to other star-fields, even within the Dragon Blaze Prefecture, without the protection of the city lord mansion, you might end up a random corpse on the street at any time. Long Chen was someone who dared to cross heavens to come here. He dared to become enemies with the powerful trading company, even plundering and killing their experts. Do you dare? All you do is rely on the city lord mansion’s prestige to abuse others. Do you think that I am a blind person who can’t see all of that? How many times have I subtly warned you? But you just continue acting the same, barely even trying to cover up your actions. Do you take me for a fool? What I could give you, I can also take away from you. Don’t you think yourself as very powerful, very amazing? Fine, then your chance has come! You’ve abused quite a few people. Now that you’ve lost your position as the son of the city lord, let me see just how long you can survive,” said the city lord.

“Father, Xiang-er knows his mistakes! Father, please, give me another chance!” pleaded Feng Xiang, truly afraid.

“I didn’t give you just one chance, but unfortunately, you didn’t appreciate it. Scram. Someone come and toss Feng Xiang out! Starting today, he has no connection to my city lord mansion!”

Two World Kings immediately appeared. They looked at Feng Xiang sympathetically.

“Feng Xiang. Let’s go.”

They had previously always called him young lord. Now that he was not the son of the city lord, even the way they called him changed.

“Father, please! Don’t abandon me! I am your son!” Feng Xiang cried out and kowtowed so hard that his forehead bled.

Although he was bleeding, it was nothing more than a trick. With his cultivation base, this was clearly intentional to soften his father’s heart.

Regretfully, his father didn’t even look at him. Feng Xiang was then dragged out.

However, just as he was about to be thrown out, his father’s voice coldly rang out.

“If you are still alive in three years, I will consider letting you rejoin the Feng family. If you do die, it has nothing to do with anyone.”

“Many thanks, father! Many thanks!” Feng Xiang was delighted but that delight quickly faded.

The city lord mansion issued a public proclamation of this news. As a result, countless people were shocked, not knowing what had happened.

Everywhere within the city, Feng Xiang was a hot topic. Wherever he went, people stared at him oddly.

Those people that were normally respectful when they saw him were now staring at him differently. Although it wasn’t very exaggerated, it was still incredibly clear to Feng Xiang that they were delighting in his misfortune.

Feng Xiang clenched his teeth and vanished from the streets.

Within the city lord mansion, a beautiful woman watched Feng Xiang vanish and she sighed.

“Aren’t you being too cruel to Feng Xiang?”

“No. I am giving him his last chance. If he still doesn’t properly cherish it, then there is no saving him,” said the city lord. This woman was Feng Xiang’s mother.

“Are you really so afraid of that Long Chen?” she asked.

The city lord looked at her coldly. “A mother really can’t see so far when it comes to their children. Shut your mouth. If Feng Xiang was allowed to continue acting this way, then after the opening of the Heavenly Flame World, there might not be a Feng family any longer. If you’re not afraid, you can scram with your son. I won’t stop you.”

“You…!” Her expression sank. After that, she stormed off.

“I hereby announce that during this time, it is forbidden for anyone in the Feng family to have any dealings with Feng Xiang! Anyone who breaks this rule will be expelled from the Feng family. Remember, this includes everyone!” shouted the city lord.

“Yes!”

The city lord stood atop the mansion by himself, overlooking the giant prefecture city. His expression was solemn.

After a bit, he took out a jade tablet. Runes flowed on top of the jade and they condensed into the shape of a dragon.

From the city lord mansion, the entire Dragon Blaze Prefecture looked like a coiling dragon. But the dragon on the jade was starting to change slightly. There were some differences.

“Ever since Long Chen arrived, the fengshui of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture has started changing. It is fluctuating intensely. This is a moment of life and death, and no one can predict what will happen. One mistake and it will be an irrecoverable calamity!”

The city lord sighed as he looked at the jade. The position of the city lord mansion was precisely on the head of the dragon.

Time passed bit by bit. The Dragon Blaze Prefecture grew increasingly lively as more and more lifeforms entered the city.

However, countless bizarre lifeforms also appeared outside of the city. Many of them possessed strange auras. They clearly weren’t lifeforms of the immortal world.

After a month, in the west of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture, a crack suddenly appeared in the void. When that crack appeared, countless experts came out of seclusion.

“The Heavenly Flame World is about to descend!”

Countless eyes lying in the dark instantly opened.
