Chapter 4050 Declining a Wedding

Yu Xiaoyun furiously cursed, “You little brat! As expected, you weren’t sincere at all! You only bring out this wine now?!”

“Have you not heard that you don’t release the hawk until you’ve seen the hare? You don’t even know this?” retorted Long Chen.

“Bastard, you’re calling me a hare?!” Yu Xiaoyun turned red and glared at Long Chen.

“Cough, that was a slip of the tongue. I just meant that if I took it out sooner, it would seem like I was bribing Your Majesty. That would be a blasphemy toward Qingxuan. Instead, I use my true sincerity to win His Majesty over and then bring out the wine as a celebration. Then it’s an entirely different concept,” explained Long Chen.

“Hmph, at least you know how to talk.” Yu Xiaoyun’s anger turned into a slight smile. “And what if you were unable to win me over?”

“If I can’t win you over, I’ll trick you. If I can’t trick, I’ll steal. If I can’t steal, I’ll snatch. In any case, Qingxuan will definitely be mine,” said Long Chen fearlessly, causing Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin to laugh.

“To be able to spout such shameless words as if they’re natural and just, I have never met anyone with such a thick face,” snorted Yu Xiaoyun.

“Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty. Many people say that I lived off of this face, but you know, I just don’t like relying on face to live. So what if I’m shameless? If you don’t like it, come bite me!” Long Chen raised his fist fearlessly, looking like he needed a beating.

“You…!”

“Ah, don’t get angry. It’s just a joke. For us two brothers- No, for us two old men to drink together is a joyous occasion!” Long Chen hastily opened one of the jugs of wine and poured it into Yu Xiaoyun’s cup.

The moment Long Chen undid the seal on the wine, everyone let out a startled cry. The fiery wine scent set people’s blood ablaze. Just by smelling it, the flame energy within their body surged crazily as if it would explode.

“Could this be…?” Yu Xiaoyun’s anger was instantly dispelled by this wine.

“Of course. If it wasn’t top grade blood fire sorghum wine, how could I bring it out for my father-in-law to drink?” Long Chen was very pleased with its effect.

Long Chen knew that this was Yu Xiaoyun's favorite wine. Prior to this, the best version of this wine that Yu Xiaoyun had ever tasted was a mere third-grade, and even then, he had already hailed it as divine. As for the current blood fire sorghum wine, being the ninth grade, it was personally crafted by a supreme expert of the Wine God Palace. The mere thought of indulging in such an exquisite and rare wine was beyond anything Yu Xiaoyun could have ever dared to dream.

The wine exuded a rich, honey-like density and a captivating amber hue. Powerful flame fluctuations emanated from it, resembling the flow of molten lava. As the wine unleashed its beautiful divine light, it had a mesmerizing effect on people. Merely gazing upon it felt intoxicating, as if one could be enchanted by its mere sight.

The current Yu Xiaoyun didn’t even bother with Long Chen’s pleased expression. He directly gulped the bowl of wine, feeling like roiling lava had been poured down his throat. When it reached his stomach, it erupted like a volcano, spreading a wave of heat throughout his body. In the end, it all gathered and condensed in his head.

After drinking it, Yu Xiaoyun actually felt dizzy, like he had been sent into the clouds. At the same time, he felt like his bottleneck was loosening.

“Good wine!”

Yu Xiaoyun exclaimed delightedly. He had never experienced such fiery wine before, and the feeling of carefree bliss it brought was indescribable.

“If it’s good wine, drink some more.” Long Chen smiled and poured another bowl for him.

“Here, you drink too!” Yu Xiaoyun seemed to become much friendlier.

“I… My injuries have yet to heal…” said Long Chen hastily. He had drunk this wine before. This thing was fatal.

At that time, he had only drunk the seventh grade of the blood fire sorghum wine, and one gulp had made him collapse. If he were to drink a bowl of the top grade wine now, he’d probably pass out. Then Yu Xiaoyun would definitely laugh at him.

“Hmph, are you afraid of collapsing? How gutless! Are you fit to marry my daughter?” provoked Yu Xiaoyun disdainfully.

“Your Majesty, Long Chen is still injured. It’s not like you don’t know…” advised Jiang Huixin.

“Huixin, don’t help him speak! This brat is slippery enough. This wine is very beneficial to his wounds. If he doesn’t drink it, it’s obvious that he’s just afraid,” said Yu Xiaoyun.

Being exposed, Long Chen was displeased. He could see that this father-in-law of his was planning on showing him who was boss before he left.

“Then I’ll accompany my father-in-law today.”

Long Chen raised his bowl. In the worst case, he would simply collapse and be dragged away. In any case, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were also here. There was nothing to fear.

Long Chen fearlessly downed three bowls in a row with Yu Xiaoyun, and the intensity of their drinking left their eyes tinted blue. When they exhaled, flames spurted from their mouths, creating a breathtaking spectacle. Jiang Huixin and the others were taken aback by this sight but couldn't help bursting into laughter at the fiery display.

The blood fire sorghum wine was so strong that they only dared to take small sips. Its power was immense. Even with just the small sips, they were starting to feel a bit light-headed.

After three bowls, Yu Xiaoyun’s tongue loosened, and he patted Long Chen on the shoulder. “I really felt like you were an expert at vexing others at first. But now, I find that you’re a super expert at pissing people off.”

Long Chen was no better off than him, as there was no way for him to suppress the wine energy. He looked at Yu Xiaoyun. “We’re in the same boat. When I first saw you, I had to take a second look. You didn’t look that great. But after looking more closely, I realized that I shouldn’t have taken a second look.”

Everyone else was speechless after hearing their slurred words. No one dared to say anything, and even the old patriarch acted like he didn’t hear this.

Yu Qingxuan was also holding a jug of the blood fire sorghum wine, pouring it for her seniors. This wine was so precious and powerful that everyone only took the tiniest sips.

On the other hand, Long Chen and Yu Xiaoyun instantly drank three bowls of it. They were red in the face, and even their words were no longer clear.

Yu Xiaoyun patted Long Chen’s shoulder. “Brother, in the future… I entrust Qingxuan to you…”

“Big brother, don’t worry. Junior brother’s love for Qingxuan is beyond the sun and moon,” swore Long Chen.

“Good. Then I’m at ease. Cheers!”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The two of you should stop drinking now. You’ve even messed up your seniorities.” Jiang Huixin hastily grabbed their wine bowls. If these two kept drinking, they might do something really embarrassing.

With his wine bowl gone, Yu Xiaoyun once more patted Long Chen’s shoulder. “My dislike for you was just a dislike for anyone who wanted to take Qingxuan from my side. Qingxuan… She is a good child. She’s smart and kind… But you know, the more a child is smart and obedient, the less attention they get. By the time that I wanted to make it up to her, there was no longer a chance… I’m not fit to be a father… You little brat, you have to treat her well…”

Yu Xiaoyun actually began to sob. It was unknown if it was because he was drunk, but the words hidden in his heart were directly revealed.

“Dad…” Yu Qingxuan’s eyes reddened with emotion.

Suddenly, Yu Xiaoyun staggered. No longer able to endure the wine, he collapsed. Jiang Huixin hastily caught him and ordered people to bring him to his room to rest.

Jiang Huixin then looked from Yu Xiaoyun to all the princes and princesses. “In truth, His Majesty loves all of you. However, he is the ruler of this empire, so he could not give you the same familial love that commoners enjoy. As your father and mother, we feel very bitter about it. We see everything that you’ve done, but the burden on our shoulders does not allow us to enjoy certain things.”

Jiang Huixin also teared up. Even as an empress, she felt powerless when it came to many things.

“His Majesty doesn’t wish for Qingxuan to marry out of the family, but more than that, he wishes for Qingxuan to be happy. Since His Majesty isn’t present, let me carry out this wedding ceremony for Qingxuan!” said Jiang Huixin.

“No. I don’t want a wedding.”

Yu Qingxuan suddenly objected, startling everyone.
