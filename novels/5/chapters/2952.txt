Chapter 2941 Exceptionally Talented, a Self-Made Genius

Long Chen quickly rushed toward a large tower in the distance. As he walked, he slowly smiled disdainfully.

He could sense several pairs of eyes on him wherever he went, but when he turned around, he didn’t see anyone. That meant that these people were experts in concealing.

However, they couldn’t conceal themselves from the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s senses.

Long Chen sighed. The Chu family truly did have eyes everywhere. He had just left his immortal cave and their eyes already fell on him. They truly had immense power here. However, he wasn’t afraid. If they dared to touch him, he would directly kill them. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Originally, his hatred for the Chu family stemmed from Long Aotian’s mother. She was the one who had harmed his father, his mother, and him, forcing them to separate. Even then, Long Chen’s hatred would have been concentrated only on her, not the rest of the Chu family.

However, now Long Chen knew that the Chu family was one of Brahma’s dogs, so he no longer had any misgivings. He would kill everyone from the Chu family.

“The Divine Scripture Pavilion. Hehe.”

Long Chen arrived at the inner academy’s Divine Scripture Pavilion. However, before he even entered, he was forced out. The rule was that only Divine Flame experts and above could enter this place.

Furthermore, entering this place required a ticket. One entrance was thirty thousand immortal crystals for him, and that was thanks to his status as a Mortal-rank instructor. Unless he reached the Human-rank as an instructor, he couldn’t go in for free.

He then went to the testing place for instructors, and an Earth-rank instructor explained things to him. The latter was very polite. He said that Heaven Master Yun Yang had brought him in.

He told Long Chen that with his power, there was no need to take the exam. But there was an inflexible standard that Human-rank instructors needed to reach the Divine Flame realm first. As long as Long Chen advanced to the Divine Flame realm, he would be directly given the Human-rank instructor status plate.

Hence, Long Chen could only leave for now. He had come to the Divine Scripture Pavilion in hopes of obtaining the Nirvana Scripture. He wanted to see if it was the same as his Nirvana Scripture.

Furthermore, after he saw it, he would be able to freely use the Nirvana Scripture, which would be another trump card that he didn’t need to hide for fear of the consequences.

Unfortunately, there were still three days until he could make his breakthrough. Mu Qingyun and the others finished registering for the divine flame spirit pool as well and were in the midst of establishing the Unfettered Alliance within the inner academy.

Not wanting to laze around, Long Chen went to the Pill Institute. Fortunately, the Pill Institute didn’t care about the cultivation realm of their disciples, and Long Chen actually saw the Seven Star Elder here.

“I didn’t expect you to have come out of seclusion already.” Long Chen was surprised. Last time, a disciple had informed him that the Seven Star Elder would only be coming out around half a month from now.

“It was a failure, so I came out early. But you really are amazing. Our Pill Institute has actually produced a fighting alchemist. It’s quite the marvel.” The Seven Star Elder He Ziyu smiled. Alchemists were supposed to maintain a clear heart, focusing entirely on increasing their Spiritual Strength and mental energy. At the same time, they had to cultivate the Pill Daos. Only when the heart was at peace and the mind was bright could you refine pills.

With Long Chen’s explosive temper, he had charged his way through the God Institute and entered the inner academy. That was definitely a marvel.

“Senior, are you being sarcastic with me? This academy has far too many idiots. If you don’t slap them, they block your way. What other choice is there?” Long Chen bitterly smiled. If you had a choice, who would wish to waste time on these idiots? Long Chen had far too many more important things to do.

“What have you come to the Pill Institute for?” asked He Ziyu.

“I want to take the examination for the inner academy’s Pill Institute. If it’s possible, I also want to become an instructor here. I do dual pill and martial cultivation, as well as dual God and Immortal cultivation. With all those paths, I am lacking money. Being an instructor would be very beneficial to me and save me money,” said Long Chen.

“You wish to take the exam to be an instructor of the Pill Institute?” He Ziyu was startled, as he had never seen Long Chen refine pills. He had never heard of him refining pills in the Pill Institute either.

Ever since Long Chen had come to the Pill Institute and beaten up that instructor, he had never attended classes there. But today, he wanted to become an instructor himself? He Ziyu didn’t know if Long Chen was joking or not.

“I’ve gone to the medicinal fields, and through very normal means, bought quite a few medicinal ingredients. After that, I’m always refining at home when I have time. I feel like I’ve gotten skilled in various techniques, so I want to be an instructor. Can you open a backdoor for me? I’m hoping to finish it quickly.” Long Chen rubbed his hands, a bit embarrassed. This examination normally occurred only once a month, but he didn’t want to wait that long.

“You refine pills when you have time? That sounds quite arrogant.” He Ziyu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. If it was another disciple saying this, he’d have long since cursed them. Did Long Chen consider alchemy to be as easy as eating? He would occasionally eat a bit when he had time, and thus mastered the skill?

“I don’t know how to explain it. How about I just do this…”

Long Chen extended a hand, and five flame seeds danced on his fingers. They were like lively monkeys, going faster and faster.

This was a foundational technique of an alchemist. Only those familiar with the transformations of the flame could control the flame easily and naturally when refining pills.

Two flame changes marked the introductory level. Three marked that someone could formally start refining pills. Four was someone who was quite skilled, someone capable of taking the Mortal-rank instructor examination.

Five flame changes? It indicated that one was capable of taking the Human-rank instructor examination. Hence, He Ziyu was shocked to see it, but the real shock came afterward.

The five flame seeds got faster and faster until they started to grow chaotic. And yet, no matter how they moved, it still seemed smooth. Dozens of flame changes occurred in an instant, dazzling the eyes.

“This flame control is something even some Earth-rank instructors lack. Who did you learn from?” asked He Ziyu in shock.

“I’m simply exceptionally talented, a self-made genius,” said Long Chen humbly, putting away the flames.

He Ziyu was speechless. He definitely didn’t believe Long Chen, but everyone had their own secrets. It wasn’t his place to question this.

“Let’s go. I’ll hold the examination for you.” He Ziyu directly brought Long Chen to an examination hall. There were hundreds of tables here, and this was where the examination was normally held.

However, this time, Long Chen was the only one taking the exam, and He Ziyu was the only one overseeing it. After that, He Ziyu activated a photographic jade and several formations to prevent cheating. Everything was held according to the normal rules of the examination.

“Let’s start the examination. You have three sets of ingredients. Refine a high grade Muscle Bone Strengthening Pill within six hours and you will pass. The time starts now.” He Ziyu turned an hourglass with golden sand upside down, and the sand slowly started flowing down.
