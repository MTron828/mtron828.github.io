Chapter 4772 One Arrow to Slay Sage Kings

That Sage King had barely moved before a black light pierced through his head, bringing with it a spray of blood. He quivered and then fell limply to the ground.4

“He’s so impatient, even to reincarnate,” said Guo Ran disdainfully, holding his crossbow.4

Guo Ran’s crossbow had the essence of the Lifehunter race’s Lifehunter Divine Crossbows, and he had enhanced it with his own innovations. Hence, this seven-color divine crossbow was his strongest weapon at the moment.7

This seven-color divine crossbow was capable of harnessing seven kinds of supreme power, with over seven thousand runes supporting it. Upon unleashing its attack, it could channel tens of thousands of formations, each releasing a different energy. It was very versatile as it could be stealthy and covert or direct and forceful, even harnessing spatial energy and influencing the flow of time. 2

To strengthen it, Guo Ran had forged dozens of different arrows to use along with it. Just now, the arrow he had used was called the God Exterminating Arrow, inscribed with the blood of immemorial devils. It specialized in attacking the Yuan Spirit.3

If struck, an ordinary Sage King would be unable to resist the invasion of the devil blood, and their Yuan Spirit would instantly disperse.0

The observers didn’t know just how many tricks were behind this one arrow, and they were simply stunned by the speed of his attack. It was so fast that the Sage King hadn’t even been able to defend. However, they were unable to comprehend how a grand Sage King was unable to flee in his Yuan Spirit form after having his body destroyed.0

“What a vicious move.”0

In the distance, even the Long clan’s experts were gobsmacked. Although that Sage King wasn’t particularly powerful in their eyes, in the end, he was still a native Sage King of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. For him to be killed by a single arrow was shocking.0

“It’s probably poison. Tch

, what a lowlife trick. Something like that should never be shown in public,” said the Long clan’s Sage King who had expressed some hostility toward Long Chen.0

“How laughable. Tell me, if you were that person, would you be capable of blocking that arrow? If he was a lowlife and you were killed by him, you would be less than a lowlife. What would you be then? A trashlife?” retorted the other Sage King who had argued against him.5

“Tch, if I was the one fighting, it’d count as my loss if I even gave him a chance to shoot an arrow,” declared the reckless Sage King irritably.0

“Tch! A Sage King wants to fight a Divine Venerate disciple! Just how did you train your skin to this thickness?” 1

“What’s your problem?! Just what did Long Zhantian give you to make you so biased toward him?!” roared the reckless Sage King.0

“I just can’t handle some hypocritical people who like to invert black and white—the kind of person who’s just like Long Xihe,” responded his rival.1

“You…!”0

Just as he was about to retort, someone pulled him back and gave him a look. This Sage King then twitched his head in a certain direction. In his anger, he had forgotten that the Heaven Overseer was just right there.1

The Heaven Overseer didn’t face them, as if he wasn’t listening at all, but who knew whether or not he was secretly irritated?0

The reckless Sage King realized he had walked straight into a trap. Just as Long Xihe had been recently dismissed by the Heaven Overseer, his rival associated him with Long Xihe, aiming to subject him to the same fate.1

Clenching his teeth, the reckless Sage King was about to apologize when the Heaven Overseer interjected, “Even if you were the one fighting, your chances of victory wouldn’t be high.”0

“Senior!”0

The Sage King was stunned, realizing that the Heaven Overseer was responding to his previous statement. He had no idea how to reply.0

The Heaven Overseer didn’t say anything further and just continued to watch Long Chen and the others.0

The matter of Guo Ran killing a Sage King with one arrow stunned everyone. However, the Celestial race’s Yue Wuxu immediately shouted, “Did you see that? In an attempt to preserve the Long clan's dignity, you were only going to make Long Chen pay with his life. That was already very generous. Yet, what do you receive in return? His underlings launching sneak attacks against you! You get them wagging their tails arrogantly in your faces! You get—”0Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Shut your fucking mouth! Are you hoping to give birth through it?” Guo Ran directly interrupted his impassioned cry, pissing on his rousing speech.7

With his train of thought interrupted, Yue Wuxu stared blankly at Guo Ran. For a long time, he couldn’t comprehend what the mouth had to do with having children. What a bizarre metaphor. Yet, with a sudden realization, his anger ignited.5

Long Chen immediately took advantage of his silence to announce, “You are all fools. I can’t be bothered to waste words on you, but just so I can have a clear conscience, I will say this. The spatial gate that Yue Wuxu took out is a fake and can be broken at any time. If the Long clan’s people really came, the Celestial race wouldn’t actually fight them to the death. They’d have someone disguised as a member of the Long clan to break the spatial gate. 3

“Other than that, the Celestial race only wants to send you to your deaths while conserving their power. Once you are all dead, all they will do for you is make sure to condemn us for killing you all. Maybe they’ll even carry out a grand memorial service for you, and that will be all.”0

“A bunch of nonsense—!” sneered Yue Wuxu.0

Not giving him any chance to argue, Long Chen finally raised Evilmoon and pointed at Yue Wuxu. “Since you say it’s nonsense, prove it. How about your Celestial race takes the lead? Don’t just launch one move and run away like you did on the other side of the gate, leaving everyone else to die.”1

Those experts being incited by the Celestial race now turned to look at Yue Wuxu. Long Chen was correct. According to reason, the Celestial race had the deepest enmity with Long Chen, so they should be the ones to take the lead.5

Yue Wuxu’s expression sank. This scheme had been pulled off successfully, but unexpectedly, Long Chen reversed the tide with just a few words. Seeing all those experts looking at him, Yue Wuxu knew that he was in a tight spot.8

Previously, he had said that the Celestial race would deal with the Long clan while the others attacked Long Chen, but Long Chen had exposed his lies. Long Chen had no great relationship with the Long clan. In other words, the Celestial race’s opponents in this battle didn’t exist.0

In this situation, if the Celestial race didn’t take the lead, it would tell everyone that Long Chen was saying the truth.0

“What a joke. What do you take my Celestial race for? You think you are worth the Celestial race attacking in full force? I alone am enough! If the rest of you don’t dare to attack Long Chen, then I will take his head myself!” declared Yue Wuxu.5

While laughing, he suddenly extended a hand, and a giant sword appeared in it.
