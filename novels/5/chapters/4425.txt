Chapter 4414 Netherdragon Tianzhao

When this elder mentioned the High Firmament Academy, the atmosphere instantly tensed. For a while, no one dared to speak, so it was deathly silent.

“What absolute nonsense! Didn’t you already investigate the High Firmament Academy!? Amongst all their heavenly geniuses, there is no one known as Long Chen!” shouted one of the nether dragon race’s Eternal experts.

That elder cried out in terror, “Our informants only covered the current experts of the High Firmament Academy! Long Chen left the High Firmament Academy years ago, and no one knows when he came back. Even our eyes were unable to transmit any news about this.”

“Then just who is this Long Chen?” demanded the race leader.

“He is the greatest heavenly genius the High Firmament Academy has seen in recent years. He soared like a shooting star the very moment he joined the academy. At such a young age, he ascended to the position of dean of a branch academy, becoming the youngest dean in the history of High Firmament Academy. Based on our information, he wields the power of dragon blood and exhibits remarkable combat prowess. Moreover, he is exceptionally gifted, having successfully fused the Starry River of the Sky Art and the Seven Supreme Yang Technique through sheer force. He has forged his own unique cultivation path…”

The elder hastily informed them about all the things Long Chen had done in the Darklight Heaven. This fellow’s memory wasn’t bad. After just glancing through the information, he could already memorize it.

“This brat didn’t do anything particularly extraordinary back then, so how could he defeat young master Tianye?” asked one of the nether dragon race’s experts.

“I agree. Perhaps someone else killed young master Tianye, or Long Chen has some terrifying weapon on him. Otherwise, just based on power, I refuse to believe that a human could defeat young master Tianye,” said another Eternal expert.

They all knew of Netherdragon Tianye’s power, so they refused to believe a youngster from the human race could defeat him—someone aiming to become a Heavenly Doyen.

After all, according to that elder’s information, Long Chen wasn’t even a Supreme back then. They refused to believe a dragon blood inheritance and a new cultivation technique made from merging two incomplete techniques could allow him to defeat Netherdragon Tianye.

“Who cares? Gather all the elites of our race! We’ll raze the High Firmament Academy to the ground!” said another Eternal expert who had just arrived.

This newcomer was a youthful Eternal expert who was unaware of the current state of affairs in the outside world. Moreover, he didn’t see the stunned expressions of his seniors upon hearing the name of the High Firmament Academy.

“What do you know? Shut your mouth!” shouted an elderly Eternal expert.

Hearing this reprimand, the new Eternal expert was startled, not realizing his mistake.

“Race leader, we cannot be rash when it comes to this matter. The High Firmament Academy is viewed as the primary target of the various worlds, yet none have initiated an attack against them. It’s evident that the High Firmament Academy has extensive influence. If we declare war against them without adequate preparation, we would probably become other people’s probing blow,” cautioned that elderly Eternal expert.

The race leader was silent, his face gloomy. Indeed, the High Firmament Academy was a mysterious and frightening existence.

Its existence alone was enough to shake them. Although everyone said that the High Firmament Academy had declined, true powerhouse factions didn’t dare to believe such a claim.

When their realms were sealed off from the nine heavens, the High Firmament Academy remained the mightiest academy in the nine heavens and ten lands. No one dared to challenge its supremacy. Hence, even with the re-opening of their realms, in the face of the seemingly weakened High Firmament Academy, they were only willing to make a few probing blows. No one dared to declare a direct war.

No matter how old a tiger was, it wasn’t something a bunny could challenge. Unless that tiger had reached the point of no longer being able to move, a single breath of it could still crush the bunnies.

The race leader was incensed after hearing this information. He had not expected that the one to kill his son would be from the High Firmament Academy. Now, all the vicious words he had said in the end about wiping out Long Chen’s sect had turned into a joke.

“Race leader, why don’t we send a few half-step Saints after Long Chen to take his head?” proposed one elder.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The race leader was silent for a long time before gloomily shaking his head. “Just killing him alone is not enough to show off the nether dragon race’s might. We’ll be laughed at if that’s all we can do.”

The other experts of the nether dragon race fell silent. Just killing Long Chen wouldn't suffice to regain the face they had lost, nor would it be adequate to quench their burning rage.

However, what else could they do? They were in a tough position. They wanted to crush the High Firmament Academy, but they didn’t dare to.

Even if one day the laws of the multiple worlds merged and Saints could venture beyond their worlds, the nether dragon race wouldn’t necessarily dare to challenge the High Firmament Academy alone.

If the High Firmament Academy really had fully declined, why did no one from any of the other worlds dare to touch them?

“How much longer until Tianzhao emerges from seclusion?” asked the race leader suddenly.

“He should be able to come out in around a month. Young master Tianzhao is expected to be a true Heavenly Doyen upon his return. He’ll likely be able to sweep through all the heavenly geniuses of the world,” responded one elder with enthusiasm.

“It’s too bad our dragon pool can only accept a single person to undergo the Heavenly Doyen baptism, or young master Tianye…” Another Eternal expert let out a regretful sigh.

The nether dragon race had originally had two heavenly geniuses aiming to become Doyens. When the world gates opened, the nether dragon race activated their dragon pool to let one of them become a true Doyen.

The leader of the nether dragon race had two outstanding sons: Netherdragon Tianye, and his elder brother, Netherdragon Tianzhao. However, the latter’s talent and strength far surpassed the former.

After spending two months in the dragon pool, Netherdragon Tianzhao was set to complete his period of seclusion within another month.

Originally, Netherdragon Tianye was supposed to undergo his own baptism in the divine altar once Netherdragon Tianzhao concluded his. During this interim period, Netherdragon Tianye was supposed to wait patiently. However, as an extremely arrogant prick, he was displeased to have the best resources given to his big brother, while he had to accept the scraps later on.

As a result, he ran amok and beat quite a few of his race’s geniuses and even his elders. Seeing his idiot son displeased and knowing that he could do nothing about it, the race leader let him go out on his own. He could go kill some people to vent his anger, and then come back when the time came for his baptism.

Unexpectedly, Netherdragon Tianye received word about Ye Ling and directly went after her, wanting to claim the achievement of slaying a Saint to prove that he was stronger than his big brother. However, he lost his life in the process.

“Then we’ll let that brat live for another month. Tianzhao will be the one to take his life! Let Tianzhao confront the junior generation of the High Firmament Academy later! I want to see if the High Firmament Academy has really declined or not!”

A sinister light appeared in the race leader’s eyes, akin to the predatory gaze of a man-eating wild beast.
