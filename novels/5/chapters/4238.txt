Chapter 4227 Half-Step Eternal

“Shadow Assassins?!”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Bai Zhantang and the others were startled. Shadow Assassins were the elites of the Shadow race, natural-born assassins with terrifying killing power and unparalleled concealment abilities.

Although the human race also had assassins, when it came to fundamental talent, they were a far cry from the Shadow race.

The Shadow race’s experts could kill others without anyone being the wiser. They were also infamous because they were willing to do anything for money.

In fact, as long as the price was high enough, they were willing to help their assassination target kill the person who had commissioned the hit instead. Their loyalty could be bought by money.

From what everyone knew, the ranks of the Shadow race’s assassins could also be differentiated easily. Their main force came from their noblest bloodline, and their talent was exceptional.

Within this chaotic battlefield, they were actually able to conceal their auras, dodge the dark creatures that were everywhere, and even avoid the senses of the likes of Bai Zhantang and the others.

Bai Xiaole’s mother was only able to sense them due to possessing the Three Flower Pupils. Furthermore, she had been focused the entire time, and only then was she able to sense something wrong. By using one of her divine abilities, she finally managed to see their indistinct figures.

On the High Firmament Academy’s side, only she had noticed them. The others couldn’t even faintly sense them. However, they knew about her divine abilities, so they believed her.

“Can you use your connection with Xiaole to warn him? Maybe you can reach him through the Three Flower Pupils?” asked Bai Shishi’s mother.

“It’s no good. The martial stage’s barrier is blocking everything. Even my Three Flower Pupils are useless here,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother gravely.

“Then what else can we do? We have to warn them. In such a chaotic battle, it’s all too easy to secretly assassinate people,” said Bai Zhantang anxiously.

Shadow Assassins could not be taken lightly. Many experts had died to their hands, some of whom were way older and more powerful than them. If Long Chen and the others weren’t warned, they might very likely lose their lives.

“Perhaps Long Chen would get it if we attack the formation? After all, he should be smart enough to tell that we’re doing it as a warning,” proposed the other vice palace master.

“No need.”

The palace master spat out a few words that instantly relaxed everyone. Their palace master was practically an unparalleled existence. If he said that there was no need, then there really should be no cause for concern.

On the martial stage, Long Chen unleashed an enormous saber-image with every slash of the Minghong Saber, slaying those dark creatures rapidly.

The current Minghong Saber was incomparably sharp, its Saber Qi surging with unparalleled intensity. Its aura was crazily climbing. As Long Chen continued to kill, it entered a kind of cultivation state.

Whether Long Chen killed some lifeforms or shattered other divine weapons, the Minghong Saber would manage to gain some kind of mystical energy to strengthen itself.

Its aura was now skyrocketing, with runes flickering around it. The sensation was akin to that of a cultivator breaking through a bottleneck.

Long Chen knew that it was seeking a chance to break through, so Long Chen’s full focus was on it. Whatever it wanted, Long Chen would give it. Long Chen knew that the current Minghong Saber was merely one step away from an Eternal divine weapon.

However, this one step was vast. The Minghong Saber had tried multiple times to break through this limit but had failed every time.

Long Chen had slaughtered countless dark creatures back in the life-forbidden area. However, while the Minghong Saber had neared a crucial breakthrough point on multiple occasions, it was consistently repelled each time, unable to make that decisive leap.

Now, faced with an endless horde of dark creatures, the Minghong Saber once again readied itself for a breakthrough, undaunted by its past failures.

More and more runes were flickering and lighting up on top of the Minghong Saber. Long Chen couldn't help but feel a surge of joy as he witnessed previously dormant runes finally springing to life.

As the Minghong Saber’s aura grew explosively, a brilliant saber cry shook the heavens. It now possessed the slightest aura of an Eternal divine weapon.

However, its breakthrough was not complete. To use the human race’s words, it had become a half-step Eternal divine weapon.

Now it was truly just the slightest bit away from a true Eternal divine weapon. Just as Long Chen was overjoyed by this, a strange fluctuation came from the Minghong Saber, causing Long Chen to look in a certain direction.

When Long Chen looked in that direction, the distant Yue Zifeng also sensed something and looked toward an empty space.

“Both of them actually sensed the assassins at the same time!”

Outside the martial stage, Bai Xiaole’s mother cried out in delight. Just as the Shadow Assassins got within a certain range, Long Chen immediately sensed them.

She was surprised but also filled with delight. It seemed that her worries had been for nothing. However, what surprised her the most was that Yue Zifeng had also sensed the assassins.

It had to be known that the Shadow Assassins were after Long Chen, and Yue Zifeng was far away in the tide of dark creatures. However, they were still unable to escape his senses.

“A sword cultivator’s senses are truly shocking. No wonder it is said that sword cultivators are the bane of all assassins,” sighed Bai Xiaole’s mother.

Sword cultivators were an unfathomable existence, their power surpassing all expectations.

On the martial stage, Yue Zifeng looked at Long Chen, and Long Chen showed him a slight smile. Seeing this smile, Yue Zifeng turned as if nothing had happened and continued to teach Mu Qingyun.

Long Chen also continued to kill the dark creatures as if he hadn’t noticed anything. However, the Shadow Assassin became aware that he had been sensed, so he retreated. As he fell back, dozens of figures nearby retreated with him.

Long Chen smiled derisively. The reason he could sense them wasn’t due to his sharp spiritual perception, but due to the Minghong Saber.

The current Long Chen was completely focused on the Minghong Saber, so his own eyes were practically closed.

However, he could use the Minghong Saber to sense the world around him, which was great as well because the Minghong Saber’s sensory abilities were devoid of emotional bias. Long Chen’s own spiritual perception was focused on sensing hostility and things that wanted to harm him, but the Shadow race’s special talent was precisely to trick other people’s senses. Even the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s sharp senses were not very effective against them.

Yet, by using his saber as a mirror, Long Chen could see through their disguises. The Shadow race might be able to trick Long Chen’s senses, but they couldn’t escape the Minghong Saber’s senses.

It wasn’t that weapons had sharp senses, but simply that they viewed the world from a different angle. The Minghong Saber allowed Long Chen to see things that he would normally overlook.

The moment Long Chen sensed the first Shadow Assassin, dozens of hidden figures also appeared within his mind’s eye. Every single one of their movements was now seen clearly by him.

When the first assassin retreated, the others also followed. The next moment, Long Chen instantly learned their goal. That first person was testing Long Chen’s range.

Long Chen then continued to slash his saber, killing a mass of dark creatures. At that exact moment, a sword silently appeared behind him, piercing toward his back.

“It seems that you all want to die.”

BOOM!

Long Chen’s Minghong Saber suddenly unleashed a brilliant wave of light, akin to a sun appearing out of nowhere. The aura of an Eternal weapon radiated throughout heaven and earth.
