Chapter 4802 Merging with the Heaven Daos

Long Chen had just walked out of the meeting hall when he saw Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan waiting for him. Their concerned expressions mirrored his own, but their silent support, as they wrapped their arms around his, lifted a heavy burden from his shoulders.

Feeling their warmth and smelling their fragrance, Long Chen felt a wave of relief wash over him. The weight of his worries dissipated in an instant.

“What happened? You were so worried just now,” asked Bai Shishi, noticing the shift in Long Chen’s demeanor.

“Having two peerless beauties by my side, how could I be worried?” Long Chen chuckled.

Bai Shishi thumped Long Chen’s chest, thinking that he had been acting to trick them.

Little did she know, it was no act. It was their presence that infused him with confidence and strength. With them beside him, Long Chen felt invincible, believing there was nothing he couldn't accomplish.

With his worries swept away, he hugged their waists tightly. “I’m blessed to have you two by my side.”

“Stop messing around. Others will see!” Bai Shishi’s face was not thick enough, and she immediately pushed off Long Chen’s hand.

On the other hand, Yu Qingxuan also blushed, but she allowed Long Chen to pull her into his hold, her eyes full of love.

Even though she hadn’t awakened her memories, she felt like she was understanding Long Chen more and more. Sometimes a single move, a single look from him was enough for her to see into Long Chen’s heart clearly.

She trusted that Long Chen’s worried expression just now was real. That was why she had let Long Chen pull her into his embrace. She knew that both of them were what gave him the greatest confidence to face these challenges.

“Cough

...”

Just then, Bai Zhantang and his two wives appeared not too far away, and Bai Shishi instantly turned completely red. Seeing her mother staring at her with a knowing smile, she had the urge to find a hole to hide in.

While his two wives were smiling at the three youngsters, Bai Zhantang was staring off into the distance, acting like he didn’t see them.

“Seniors, you’ve come out so quickly!” Long Chen greeted, feeling a tad embarrassed. Being caught in an intimate moment was enough to make even someone as thick-skinned as him feel self-conscious.

Bai Shishi’s mother chuckled. “Senior? You’ve changed our title so quickly? I think I recall you calling us—”

“Mom!” Bai Shishi interrupted. She directly stamped her foot, and with a turn, she ran off, truly unable to stay here.

Seeing her daughter acting this way, Bai Shishi’s mother laughed happily. Long Chen could only awkwardly say a few words before dragging Yu Qingxuan away. Once they arrived at their temporary residence, he found that the Dragonblood warriors were already in meditation, communing with the Heavenly Daos to get accustomed to the laws of this world.

However, Long Chen didn’t see Guo Ran and Xia Chen among them, so he learned from the academy’s seniors that the two of them had gone to survey the surrounding land.

“Surveying?” Long Chen was speechless. These two had definitely gone in search of various divine ores. However, they wouldn’t go too far. After all, they were surrounded by enemies. They understood that.

With the academy’s experts protecting the surroundings, the disciples here were temporarily safe. They didn’t even need a reminder, all trying to get accustomed to the laws of this world.

At first, Bai Shishi had also been cultivating with everyone, but Yu Qingxuan had been worried about Long Chen, so she had dragged her over.

Fortunately, their timing was good. They had managed to calm Long Chen down instantly. Thanks to them, Long Chen was able to set his worries aside to focus on meditating.

Just as Long Chen sat down, someone in the distance started hacking up blood. He was someone who had followed Long Chen from the Darklight Heaven.

“Steady your mind! Don’t be distracted by illusions. Everything you see is a manifestation of your heart-devil. Ignore it. Use your heart to sense the power of heaven and earth!” shouted an elder of the academy.

That person looked as if he was struggling in a nightmare, his eyes closed tightly. However, after hearing that elder’s shout, he slowly calmed down and stopped coughing up blood.

“Heart-devil?”

Long Chen’s heart shook, and he instantly thought of his heart-devil that looked identical to him. Thinking of the pitch-black eyes, he felt a chill.

“Senior, senior...!” Long Chen called out to the Earth Cauldron. Back then, he had sealed his heart-devil in the Earth Cauldron. However, his heart-devil had escaped at some unknown point.

Even after so long, the heart-devil had not appeared again, but he always felt unsteady. Hearing this, he called out to the Earth Cauldron to learn where it had gone.

However, this time, the Earth Cauldron acted like it was sleeping, not responding to Long Chen’s call. Long Chen’s palm became covered in sweat.

If there was anyone he feared, it was his heart-devil. Despite seeming to have departed, its lingering presence still haunted him, filling him with unease.

“Senior, merging with the Heavenly Daos will awaken a heart-devil?” Long Chen asked that elder.

This elder was a Mortal Saint of the academy. He immediately bowed and humbly said, “Dean Long Chen, this process of merging with the Heavenly Daos has a definite chance of awakening a heart-devil. However, with your power, you shouldn’t have to worry about it.”

The more of an undefeated heavenly genius one was, the more confidence they had. Even if they did have a heart-devil, it would be easily suppressed and controlled. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Only people who lacked confidence or had experienced some kind of trauma would be disturbed by their heart-devils. Luckily, anyone who could enter the Sovereign Emperor Heaven had to be greater than average. Even though there were millions of people here, only a handful of people were being affected by their heart-devils.

Thus, when an existence like Long Chen asked about the heart-devil, the Mortal Saint elder felt like Long Chen was worrying about nothing.

“Long Chen...”

Yu Qingxuan noticed something wrong and held Long Chen’s hand.

“I’m fine, but I can’t be with the rest of you during this time.”

Long Chen comforted his two women and then found a secluded place for himself. He also sent word to Dean Bai Letian to take care of the Dragonblood Legion.

Summoning Huo Linger and Lei Linger to protect him during this process, he then took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes.

“Come. Let me see just how strong you’ve gotten.”
