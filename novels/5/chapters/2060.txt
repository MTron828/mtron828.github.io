A squad of Dragonblood warriors flew over to Long Chen. In truth, the construction of this place was still finishing up. Since the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race didn’t know anything about formations, it was up to the Dragonblood warriors to keep an eye on things.

Naturally, the core construction of the formation had been done by Xia Chen, but they also had to hire many craftsmen. In order to prevent anyone from intentionally sabotaging things, there had to be people patrolling while they worked.

In the Grand Han’s capital, Xia Chen had disguised himself as a high level formation master and ended up conning the Grand Han. He had not only charged them an enormous amount of money, but he had also caused a powerful barrier to appear that had allowed Long Chen to slaughter more of his enemies.

Xia Chen had conned others, but he definitely wouldn’t allow others to con him, so all the details had to be closely guarded.

“Boss!”

When the Dragonblood warriors got close, Long Chen found that they had reached the fourth Heavenstage of Life Star. He trusted that Gu Yang and the others must have reached a higher level than that.

As for himself, his cultivation base was still stuck in the same place. Just thinking about it gave him a headache. It seemed that he was doomed to be the one with the lowest cultivation base within the Dragonblood Legion.

“Has anything happened lately?” asked Long Chen.

“The construction has gone smoothly. No one has caused any trouble. A few spies appeared at the beginning, but they have been slaughtered. However...” After a moment’s hesitation, that Dragonblood warrior said, “Recently, a few people have come to challenge the Dragonblood Legion.”

Long Chen frowned. It was definitely those disciples from the ancient sects. After hearing that the Dragonblood Legion was the continent’s number one legion, they had come.

“Have you had any conflicts with them?” asked Long Chen.

“No. Captain Gu Yang told us to ignore them and focus on our work. Let the dogs bark!” laughed one of them.

Long Chen smiled. That truly was the right choice. Handling some meaningless provocations wasn’t worth delaying their cultivation.

“Dragonblood Legion, come out to fight!”

Just at this moment, a powerful shout rang out, passing through the formation. This was definitely a powerful cultivator, most likely an Empyrean who had awakened their manifestation.

“Look, it’s another one.”

“Ignore them. As long as they don’t enter our territory, let them shout. If they do enter though, just directly kill them,” said Long Chen.

After that, the Dragonblood warriors continued their patrol, while Long Chen went straight to a mountain peak.

News of Long Chen’s return quickly spread through the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Even their leader personally came to see him.

Long Chen found that the auras of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows had gone through heaven-toppling transformations. The aura of ancient beasts was finally manifesting itself.

This was all thanks to Meng Qi. She had opened the Myriad Spirit Diagram to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, allowing them to train in their lost divine abilities.

If they didn’t understand something, they could go in and receive their complete inheritance. Those lost divine abilities were finally once more within their control.

It could be said that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s power was growing with each passing day. They were originally a very powerful race, and now that they were regaining their inheritance, they only grew more terrifying.

Their leader gave Long Chen a brief explanation of what was going on within the race. They were rapidly growing stronger, and due to the qi flow of the continent swelling, hundreds of Empyreans had appeared amongst the junior generation. Although none of them had awakened their manifestations, it made them go wild with joy.

After talking to her, Long Chen returned to the Dragonblood Legion’s territory.

Most of the Dragonblood warriors were in seclusion, working hard on their cultivation. Only a portion of them were busy patrolling.

The territory of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had been sealed. Qu Jianying and the others had concealed the information that Long Chen had gone to Pill Valley from them, worried that the Dragonblood Legion would do something stupid.

That was why the warriors weren’t too emotional about Long Chen’s return. They didn’t know what he had been up to recently. To cultivators, a few months might just be a short period of seclusion.

“Scoundrel, you’re finally back. Speak, how many ladies did you seduce this time?”

Long Chen had just entered Meng Qi and the others’ residence when a tigress-like Tang Wan-er pounced on him, grabbing his neck with a frightening expression.

“How could the ladies in the outside world compare to the ones in my own home? If I were to seduce anyone, it would be the ones in my home already, right?” Long Chen chortled, holding Tang Wan-er’s waist and then slowly moving his hands down.

Tang Wan-er let out a cry, immediately releasing Long Chen and retreating, cursing, “Hmph, and you say you didn’t seduce anyone? Your methods are always scoundrel-like.”

“Haha, touching, grabbing, it’s very delightful. Don’t worry, you’ll be a bit sensitive at the start, but you’ll get used to it soon enough,” said Long Chen wickedly. Tang Wan-er was as fiery as ever, but this was also her cutest side.

“Wan-er, how many times have I told you that you’ll always be at a disadvantage fighting him?” At this time, Meng Qi and Chu Yao walked in as well.

“Come, just now I hugged Wan-er, but I can’t discriminate against you two. I’ll treat you fairly. Let’s all have a hug.” Long Chen reached out to hug Chu Yao. Chu Yao blushed, but she pulled him into a tight embrace.

After hugging Chu Yao, Long Chen turned to Meng Qi, but Meng Qi raised a hand, sternly saying, “Hold it. First, tell me what you’ve been up to lately. Why did the alliance head hide your whereabouts?”

“Could it be... he really did go out to cheat?” demanded Tang Wan-er.

“You...” Meng Qi sighed. “Why are you always thinking about such things? The alliance head ordered this place to be sealed with the excuse of focusing on the construction, but that was obviously implausible. Just based on her expression at the time, I knew something was wrong. This matter is definitely related to you, right?”

Meng Qi was very scrupulous. Although she had sensed something wrong, she hadn’t said anything to the others. She only brought it up now that Long Chen had returned.

Long Chen could only calmly explain what he had done in Pill Valley. Although he made it sound easy, Meng Qi and the others still turned pale. Long Chen was truly brazen or perhaps suicidal.

Before they could say anything, Long Chen raised his hands and regretfully said, “First, I admit my wrongs. I shouldn’t have taken this risk and made you worry. So, I will accept any punishment. If you want to take off my pants and touch whatever, it’s up to you. I won’t resist. I’ll do my best to cooperate!”

“Scoundrel!”

“Rogue!”

“Shameless!”

Meng Qi and the others were originally angry at being kept in the dark, only to blush from how shameless he was.

Meng Qi looked at Long Chen with pain in her eyes. Long Chen looked like he had gotten thinner. “You must be tired. Go take a bath. We have our own hot spring inside. There’s dense spiritual qi within. Bathing in it is very comfortable.”

Within the depths of the immortal cave was a small spring a few meters wide. Dense vapor hung in the air. Long Chen sank inside it, while Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er accompanied him with their clothes still on.

With the spring water, their curves were fully exposed. They blushed, but six beautiful hands helped to clean Long Chen.

In the end, Tang Wan-er was the first to no longer be able to endure, and she began to cry. Meng Qi and Chu Yao also had red eyes. They saw many scars on Long Chen’s body and injuries that had yet to heal. There was a remnant of Heavenly Dao energy within them. Just from these injuries, they could tell how intense that battle must have been.

There was even a long scab on the back of Long Chen’s neck. Someone had clearly tried to cut his head off from behind.

Although Long Chen had put it lightly, seeing those sinister wounds distressed them. After following Long Chen for so many years, they were well aware of his monstrous recovery abilities. They were even stronger than Heavenly Dao Recovery. However, even after all this time, he hadn’t managed to heal. That showed just how dangerous things must have been at that time.

“Wan-er, don’t cry. Here.” Long Chen drew Tang Wan-er into his embrace. As a result, due to the water and her thick garments, Long Chen ended up touching someplace very soft that he should not have touched.

Tang Wan-er shook, and she hastily pushed him away, cursing, “You scoundrel, all you know how to do is bully us.”

“It wouldn’t be fair for me to bully just one. It seems I’ll have to find some more people to bully tomorrow.” Long Chen rubbed his chin thoughtfully.

“You dare?!” raged Tang Wan-er.

“Wan-er, your heartbeat is quickening because of your anger! And your face is so red! You must be ill. Let me properly listen to your heartbeat.”

Like a big fish, Long Chen swam toward Tang Wan-er, causing her to shout while Meng Qi and Chu Yao laughed.

After a bath, Long Chen had a good sleep, and he felt refreshed after he woke up. The weariness of many days had been erased.

After getting up and freshening up, Long Chen decided to go see Guo Ran. According to Meng Qi, there was some matter in Guo Ran’s heart.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
