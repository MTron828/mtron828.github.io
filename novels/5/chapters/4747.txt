Chapter 4736 Qin Feng Terrifies

“What terrifying Sword Qi!” A startled cry echoed through the air as the Sage King's hand dripped with blood, a gaping wound threatening to sever it entirely.

Despite it being a simple Sword Qi, not the actual blade, it had cut through a Sage King’s protective divine light and even injured him. This was no ordinary feat.

“I know! It was definitely the Dragonblood Legion’s number one sword expert. He was called Yue something... right, Yue Zifeng!” exclaimed someone.

Yue Zifeng, the fourth captain of the Dragonblood Legion, was publicly acclaimed as the strongest sword cultivator. Even in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, Yue Zifeng’s name was well-known.

“How can someone like him be worthy of facing my captain? If the attack came from my captain, he would be dead already,” sneered a voice suddenly. Then, a large figure with a sword on his back appeared. Seeing him, that disciple shouted in joy, “Big Brother Qin Feng! You came just in time. These people are all so vicious!”

This person was the Dragonblood Legion’s Qin Feng, and he appeared completely different from when he had been in the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea.

In the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea, he had successfully become a nine star Heavenly Doyen. However, today, his Heavenly Doyen fluctuations were much weaker, only on the level of a five star Doyen.

“Who are you?!” asked the elder as he stared at the wound to his palm in bewildered shock.

“Qin Feng, an ordinary warrior of the Dragonblood Legion,” answered Qin Feng indifferently.

“Were you the one to attack me just now?” demanded the Sage King.

“What do you think?”

Qin Feng’s disdainful gaze was exactly the same as the disciple’s, igniting the Sage King’s fury. He roared, “A group of shameless fellows! Do you think ambushes count as true skill? If you have the guts, face me in fair combat!”

Seeing that Qin Feng was only a five star Doyen, the Sage King refused to accept that Qin Feng could have injured him. He suspected this was Long Chen’s doing.

Qin Feng shook his head. “They say a frog at the bottom of a well cannot speak of the ocean, and a summer fly cannot speak of ice. You come from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven; one would presume you’ve glimpsed this wide world. Yet, you can’t even tell who attacked you. Do you think someone like you is qualified to see our boss?”

“Bastard, go fuck yourself!” The elder roared in fury and unleashed a punch. A fierce astral wind erupted, causing qi waves to surge outward, shaking the gate of the academy.

In response, a sword came flying out of its sheath, slicing the astral wind apart with a bolt of violet lightning. An arm was severed from the elder’s body.

This turn of events left everyone stunned. They witnessed Qin Feng’s sword cleanly severing the elder’s arm.

With a twist of his wrist, Qin Feng unleashed more Sword Qi, effortlessly reducing the severed arm to pieces with three precise strokes of his sword. The blade then gracefully returned to its sheath, leaving the elder in a state of shock and fury. He clutched his shoulder where his arm once was and simply stared at Qin Feng in disbelief, forgetting to even staunch the flow of blood. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

While Qin Feng looked apathetic, he was rejoicing inside. Glancing at the unremarkable ring he had on, he smiled. Boss Guo Ran’s ring really is amazing. This time, acting like the pig to eat the tiger feels really exhilarating!

After the Dragonblood warriors all became nine star Heavenly Doyens, Long Chen didn’t want to expose their power. Thus, he had Guo Ran forge some aura-concealing rings that suppressed their Doyen aura to around the five star Doyen level.

Moreover, despite their concealed aura, their actual power remained unaffected, making it a cunning strategy. Even a Sage King was falling for it.

This Sage King was unable to believe it. How could a five star Doyen break his Sage King laws and injure him? He was completely baffled.

That sharp sword cut through his arm like a radish, and he didn’t even feel the pain at first. Just how sharp was it?

Qin Feng’s attack was so swift that even this Sage King didn’t know what kind of sword it was. He only vaguely saw a bolt of violet flash before everything was over.

“Now can we talk amicably about what you came here for,” said Qin Feng as he looked at the stunned crowd.

“You...”

The elder without an arm seethed with rage, but he was also terrified as he could not see through Qin Feng. Clenching his teeth, he said, “Alright, I’ll remember this grudge! We’ll settle this once you arrive in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven!”

As the elder concluded his speech, he noticed a sudden shift in Qin Feng's demeanor, the once amiable expression now replaced with a flash of killing intent.

A thin trickle of blood traced its way down the elder’s face as he stared in horror at Qin Feng. He raised his finger to point at Qin Feng and tried to say something, but as he opened his mouth, his body split in two from head to crotch.

“The Dragonblood Legion doesn't remember grudges. We like to settle them on the spot, and we don’t have the time or patience to wait for you.”

After saying that, Qin Feng swung his sword and pointed it at the crowd. “The Dragonblood Legion seeks no trouble, but we fear it not. Anyone who wants to cause trouble for us, step out now. I, Qin Feng, shall face all your challenges alone!”

With his sword angled menacingly toward them, Qin Feng exuded surging killing intent. The onlookers could now clearly see the unique form of his weapon. It was a fierce-looking sword with the hilt bearing dragon runes along its surface and the guard resembling two dragon teeth. The blade itself looked like layered dragon scales, its form rough and uneven. However, it possessed primal elegance that exuded a domineering feeling.

The blade’s edge glowed with a violet hue, its divine light flickering ominously, sending shivers down the spines of those nearby.

As Qin Feng aimed the sword at them, an oppressive atmosphere engulfed the crowd, leaving them with a profound sense of dread. They knew that once that sword fell, their lives would come to an end.

Even though these people came from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven and were strong in their own right, they found themselves utterly overwhelmed by Qin Feng and his formidable blade.

In the end, these experts didn’t even dare to respond and just silently left, appearing completely dejected.

“Tch, a group of cowards.”

Qin Feng sheathed his sword and returned to the depths of the academy. When he arrived at a secret room beneath a mountain, the rest of the Dragonblood Legion was waiting for him. After they all focused on Guo Ran, whose forging hammer was smashing down like a torrent.

In one breath, Guo Ran struck it down hundreds of times. At this moment, Long Chen and the others were holding their breath.

With one final strike of his hammer, a sword jumped off from the forging table, and a violet halo instantly filled the room.

“Success!”

Guo Ran let out an excited cry, followed by cheers from Long Chen and the others.
