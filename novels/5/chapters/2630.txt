Chapter 2619 Competition Between Two Dragons

Feng Fei, Jiang Wuchen, Ye Liangchen, and Long Aotian had appeared at the same time.

“Who are you?” demanded the dragon woman.

However, as soon as she said this, a flash of shock appeared in her eyes. Her guards had most likely introduced them to her.

“Long Chen stole my treasure and killed my dragon guard. I won’t make things hard on him. As long as he hands over half the essence blood, this matter can end here.” The dragon woman’s gaze swept over Long Aotian and the others, and she pointed at Long Chen.

As soon as she made this demand, everyone was stunned. She was crazy. To take Long Chen’s essence blood at this time would make his realm unstable. There was even danger of his realm regressing.

Furthermore, such a thing was exceedingly humiliating. No one would be able to accept such a thing, especially not Long Chen. This woman’s head definitely had something wrong with it.

Long Chen almost laughed from anger. Had this woman been sealed at the depths of the sea for so long that she had gotten water in her brain? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen was about to retort when Guo Ran suddenly said, “Let me answer in place for my boss. If you want essence blood, then there’s none. If you want piss and if you really need it, for the Martial Heaven Continent, my boss would be willing to give you some for free.”

The Dragonblood warriors laughed. This response was truly impressive. Since the dragon woman was so impolite, there was no need to give her face.

“Die!” The dragon woman suddenly appeared in front of Guo Ran. As the space behind her collapsed, a fist covered in black dragon scales smashed toward Guo Ran.

This fist gave a suffocating feeling to everyone present. As for Guo Ran, he seemed to have expected this response and slashed his dual sabers in front of him.

BOOM!

The void splintered, with runes flying around. The dragon woman was actually sent stumbling back.

“You only have this little ability, yet you dare be so arrogant?” sneered Guo Ran.

Although that was what he said, he was shocked inside. This casual blow from the dragon woman had almost caused him to cough up blood.

Guo Ran was crafty and had secretly borrowed the power of the Dragonblood Legion just now. He had basically been cheating, but other than the people of the Dragonblood Legion, no one else noticed.

Right now, the dragon woman was startled and infuriated. Although this was nothing more than a casual blow for her, she was a barbarian blood black dragon who specialized in power, and now she had been blocked by a human.

“Have another one of my punches!”

This time, dragon qi swirled around her arm, and she attacked once more, this time with even greater power.

BOOM!

However, a hand covered in white dragon scales caught her fist. Long Chen had appeared in front of Guo Ran.

Divine light then exploded from where the white scales touched the black scales, and their dragon qi twisted.

As a result, astral winds blew back everyone. Even the Dragonblood warriors behind Long Chen were forced back into the distance.

“Hmph, you’re nothing more than a human. Even if you absorb the true dragon’s essence blood, you’re still human. You can’t become a true dragon. The true dragon essence blood will only be able to unleash its true power in my hands, so I’ll only give you one last chance. Are you giving it to me or not?” said the dragon woman.

Her Blood Qi began to soar like a volcano was erupting, being as vast as a sea.

As for Long Chen’s Blood Qi, it was like a lake. Although it was smaller, it suppressed her in quality. Hence, her Blood Qi was being suppressed, and it made her want the true dragon essence blood even more. That was a priceless treasure to her.

“I’ll also give you one last chance. Are you fighting or fucking off? Decide now,” said Long Chen coldly.

“I gave you face, but you didn’t want it! Since that’s the case, I’ll personally take it back!” The dragon woman’s manifestation suddenly burst into existence behind her.

Her manifestation had an endless sea inside it. When it came out, the sea suddenly surged and a giant black dragon appeared, roaring at the heavens.

When the dragon roared, the sky trembled. A terrifying dragon pressure caused the experts to feel like they would be crushed.

Feeling shocked, they tried to guard against it, only to find that the dragon roar was not a true spiritual attack. It was simply a spiritual pressure that was extremely difficult to resist.

Suddenly, the sound of a zither caused the pressure to lighten. Although it was still present, these experts could endure it.

“Many thanks, Zither Fairy!”

The one who had saved them was Zi Yan, who was holding one of the five supreme divine items, the Southern Sea Zither. The disciples with weaker cultivation bases hastily thanked her and retreated.

For most experts, they were high and aloof, ignoring ordinary cultivators. They would only watch as the latter suffered. It would already be courteous if the experts didn’t add a few mocking words about their suffering.

However, whether it was Zi Yan or Long Chen, or even the experts beside Long Chen, they would never be so aloof, nor would they use other people’s weaknesses to prove their own strength.

Right now, the dragon roar grew louder and louder, while black qi swirled around the air. Long Chen’s divine ring also appeared. When the six stars inside of it were shining brightly, an azure dragon could be seen swimming on top of his dragon scales. After that, the Blood Qi within both of their bodies began to roar.

Black cracks began to spread where their scales were in contact with each other. Those cracks began to dance like a spiderweb in the wind.

“Space is unable to endure their power. Even the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent cannot repair themselves fast enough. Just what kind of power is this?!” People’s jaws dropped. The black dragon in the woman’s manifestation grew larger and larger, while the sea water also grew with it. Her aura was growing limitlessly.

“With just the power of their physical bodies, they can force aside the laws of heaven and earth. Probably only a few people in all the Martial Heaven Continent’s history are capable of doing so. It was probably rare even in the immortal era.” The High Priest nodded his head with a bit of praise.

Daoist Heavenly Feather also nodded. “The barbarian blood black dragon exists only in legend. It isn’t a lifeform of the Martial Heaven Continent. I once saw a mention of them in a damaged scroll: their blood is like silk, twisting and gathering until their power can shatter the heavens. She is most likely gathering her bloodline power at the moment but has already caused such a phenomenon.”

The High Priest shook his head. “For the barbarian blood black dragon to unleash its full power requires it to enter the thirteenth rank first. She has yet to reach that level. Despite that, she has reached this level.”

“So that’s the case. Thank you.” Daoist Heavenly Feather smiled.

Hearing their discussion amazed the other experts. Their knowledge was truly deep. Because of it, the other experts grew more shocked by the dragon woman’s origin. If she wasn’t a lifeform from the Martial Heaven Continent, then where had she come from?

Feng Fei, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen stood in the sky, watching indifferently. On the surface, it seemed that they had come to mediate things, but now they were just watching without saying anything.

“Jiang Wuchen, in terms of power, you’d probably be suppressed by this woman.” Ye Liangchen smiled with unclear implications.

Hearing this, Jiang Wuchen’s expression sank. Ye Liangchen’s words were quite insidious. Jiang Wuchen had been suppressed by Long Chen in terms of power in their last battle, and that was a kind of humiliation for him.

When Zhao Ritian was still alive, Jiang Wuchen was the strongest of the five Sovereign sprouts. That was his proudest point. But he had been suppressed by Long Chen.

This humiliation had yet to fade, and then he saw this dragon woman with equally terrifying power.

Hence, Ye Liangchen intentionally provoked him with this, making him exceptionally angry, but he couldn’t say anything in reply.

Feng Fei couldn’t just watch that go by. “Then what about you? Just how badly would you be suppressed in terms of power?”

Jiang Wuchen was Feng Fei’s big brother. Although they did not have the same mother, they were still brother and sister, so Feng Fei naturally helped Jiang Wuchen out.

Ye Liangchen indifferently said, “I don’t specialize in power.”

“Oh? Then what do you specialize in? Getting trapped by a person’s housepet? Yes, in that aspect, you really are amazing. Others are unable to replicate that ability.”

“You…!” Ye Liangchen was infuriated. He had lost all his face last time when he had been trapped by Huo Linger. Although he hadn’t appeared as wretched as Jiang Wuchen, in truth, for him to mock Jiang Wuchen was the pot calling the kettle black.

“What you? Ye Liangchen, other than a treacherous tongue, what other amazing talent do you have?” demanded Feng Fei.

The five Sovereign sprouts all had their own pride, and it was difficult for them to get along. But when it came to who was the most difficult to get along with, it would have to be Ye Liangchen.

His mouth was extremely toxic. Feng Fei hated him the most, even more than Zhao Ritian. If it weren’t for the orders from her family, she would not be here with them.

Just as Ye Liangchen’s fury soared, an explosion drew their attention. Two figures were soaring into the sky, and dragon roars were erupting like crashing waves.
