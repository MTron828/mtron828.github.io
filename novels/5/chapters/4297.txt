Chapter 4286 One Father, One Son

Feng Xinyue chose not to say anything further and instead looked at Tang Wan-er. Tang Wan-er’s expression immediately turned sour, fully aware of what her master wanted to convey.0

In the end, Tang Wan-er also left with Feng Xinyue and the disciples of the Wind Sect. At this moment, the experts of the remaining factions began to walk over.0

“Please tell Long Chen that my Crow Mountain’s Zhang family is profoundly indebted to him. In the future, as long as he says a single word, all my Crow Mountain’s thirty million experts will come. If even a single person is missing, let me, Zhang Wanming, be cleaved by lightning.” An elder cupped his fists to Guo Ran and the others.0

This elder was an innate Heaven Venerate and was covered in blood and wounds. A while ago, he had fought to protect the Dragonblood Legion in their hasty escape.0

After all, the Dragonblood Legion was protecting the three hundred elite disciples of his Zhang family who had absorbed many karmic luck runes. Even if he were to die, he had to protect them.0

It could be said that all these elders here were filled with gratitude to the Dragonblood Legion. Even if they had to die on the battlefield for Long Chen, they wouldn’t frown in the slightest.0

“Senior is too courteous. Only a hero like senior could raise such heroic sons and daughters. They were willing to fight for the Dragonblood Legion, so how could our Dragonblood Legion not do the same for them? Seniors, you should rest for now. When my boss returns, we will meet once more and have a feast with everyone,” said Guo Ran, also feeling moved.0

Since Long Chen was gone, he was placed into the solemn position of overseeing the Dragonblood Legion. Seeing so many people looking at him with gratitude and worship, Guo Ran felt like everything had been worth it.0

“Good, good! With heroes like you in this era, it is a blessing for our human race. My Snow Reflection Gate will listen to the Dragonblood Legion in the future. Although my Snow Reflection Gate is no famous power, we still have ten million disciples. We will fight for the Dragonblood Legion at any moment!” declared another sect leader.0

Despite being drenched in blood, and with one of his arms missing, he paid no heed to his wounds. With unwavering determination, he firmly declared his allegiance.0

“In the future, if Long Chen needs anything, we will walk through fire to get it for him!”0

The other factions also shouted their promises as well. All of them had helped fight for the Dragonblood Legion, and they were deeply moved by the Dragonblood Legion’s heroism.0

As the representative of the Dragonblood Legion, Guo Ran thanked all of them. Many of the heavenly geniuses who had gone to assist Long Chen also cupped their fists to the Dragonblood warriors and bid them farewell.0

They had fought alongside each other, slaughtering their way out of a sea of powerful enemies. This was really a case of heroes flocking together.0

In a bit, tens of millions of experts left with reluctant gazes. The Sage King Convention had come to a close. Yet, for them, the most significant gain this time wasn't the karmic luck runes; it was the opportunity to meet Long Chen.0

Meeting Long Chen showed them what a real hero should be like. Moreover, he had illuminated the path before them, showing them their futures. It was as if their souls had undergone a transformation, causing them to understand the true essence of cultivation. Now, they knew their future goals and were no longer lost.0

In the end, the Starry River Sect’s experts also left. They were the ones to benefit the most from Long Chen. Furthermore, they had taken Long Chen’s words to heart and strived to spread the Starry River of the Sky Art, allowing it to flourish across the nine heavens and ten lands and enabling even more people to learn of its existence.0

Now, all that remained were the Dragonblood Legion, the High Firmament Academy, and the Battle God Palace.0

“Zifeng, you’re not leaving this time, right?” asked Guo Ran.0

Yue Zifeng shook his head. “I’m not leaving. Starting today, I will be properly accompanying my fourth regiment.”0

Hearing that, the fourth regiment’s Dragonblood warriors cheered loudly.0

“Gu Yang, Mingyuan, Li Qi, are you leaving?” asked Guo Ran.0

“No. We already handled our affairs before coming. We’ve learned everything we had to learn, so we’re going to accompany boss throughout the nine heavens.” The three of them exchanged a look and laughed.0

This response invigorated the Dragonblood warriors. The Dragonblood Legion had finally reunited.0

“Hahaha, then I, the general, am going to have a meteoric rise to the top of the world!” Guo Ran laughed, more excited than anyone. “Brothers, just leave the matter of your weapons and armor to me and Xia Chen!”0𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Dragonblood warriors let out heaven-shaking cheers. This reunion had indeed been an arduous journey.0

“I welcome everyone to join us as a representative of the High Firmament Academy. Let’s go. The eighteenth branch academy has already been activated, and you will be our first guests,” said Bai Letian with a smile.0

Everyone cheered and finally left. The Dragonblood Legion, the academy’s disciples, and the Battle God Palace’s disciples were in high spirits from their victory.0

Once Bai Letian and the others departed, a group of people stared in their direction. After that, one of the elders in this group let out a heavy sigh.0

These people were the Long clan’s experts, and the one sighing was the Grand Elder. He a complex expression, marked by both regret and helplessness.0

“One father, one son. Could it truly be fate? The Seven Peak Sword originally derived from a divine ability found in Long Zhantian’s seven-color Supreme Blood. However, Long Aotian was unable to harness his own blood to condense the Seven Peak Sword despite possessing the same seven-color Supreme Blood. We had no choice but to create a separate Seven Peak Sword for him to use. However, when Long Chen reclaimed the seven-color Supreme Blood, he instantly mastered this technique. Not only that, but he even condensed a Seven Peak Spear. A Seven Peak Spear! Ugh, we can tell our Forging Masters in the clan not to waste their effort.” The Grand Elder sighed. Looking at the dejected Long Aotian, whose Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone had been extracted, the Grand Elder was filled with a sense of helplessness.0

“Grand Elder, what do we do with Long Aotian? Will you help him with the blood soul replenishment? Only you can save him,” said another elder.0

“Long Chen even refuses to give him a peaceful death. At least, for a short while, he won’t die because Long Chen wants him to experience pain. And in truth, by sparing his life, Long Chen is probing our Long clan.” The Grand Elder shook his head sadly.0

“Probing us? How?” asked the elder.0

“Long Chen possessed both power and intelligence. He intentionally spared Long Aotian, not just to make him suffer, but to see our reaction as well. After all, Long Chen is also from the Long clan. If the Long clan is smart, we should know what choice to make. Only by treating Long Zhantian kindly will we have a chance to bring Long Chen back home. That is the only option for our Long clan,” said the Grand Elder.0

“But the patriarch will not be able to accept such a result…” said the other elder hesitantly.0

“Then the Long clan will be in danger.” The Grand Elder sighed. He stared at the giant spate gate in the distance, shook his head, and left.1

As for Long Aotian, he was carried away like a dead dog. The next moment, the Long clan’s experts silently vanished into the wilderness.0

The world returned to calm, yet that terrifying gate remained, resembling a fiend’s eye. The day it opened would be a day of slaughter.
