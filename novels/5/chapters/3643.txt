Chapter 3632

Alldevil Tianye’s arm emitted a blinding light and was covered in dense runes that unleashed endless power. It was as if its power could truly destroy the entire world if it was unleashed.

“Do you see? This is the Supreme Bone. It possesses the power to control an entire world’s power. It isn’t something ants like you can comprehend.” Alldevil Tianye looked at his black arm with a proud smile.

BOOM!

Just like that, he smashed the air with his black arm. As a result, the void could not contain his power and collapsed. The wall of the world was broken, creating a black hole that sucked countless corpses, rubble, and broken fragments into it. It was a horrifying sight.

“Is this power something that ants like you can compete with?” Alldevil Tianye sneered at Long Chen like an undefeatable devil king.

“Just what kind of power is this…?”

Just as people’s killing intent was raging to avenge their seniors and their fighting spirits soared, this one move from Alldevil Tianye was like a bucket of ice over their heads. Their desire for revenge was mostly extinguished.

This was the result of a level of power that simply caused despair, a power that could not be matched or imagined. Whether it was the human race or the devil beast army, they all stopped fighting and simply stared at the two of them.

“So the immortal world also has a kind of Supreme Bone. In the mortal world, it slumbers, accumulating power. It only sprouts under the immortal world’s laws, unleashing its real power.” Long Chen eyed Alldevil Tianye’s black bone arm.

He finally understood that he had underestimated the Supreme Bone. He thought that it was just some bone of talent from the mortal world without much use.

Now that he saw Alldevil Tianye’s black bone arm, he instantly understood that the Supreme Bone would only display its true power in the immortal world.

Supreme. It was an expression of peak talent. Even though Long Chen had gone through the High Firmament Academy’s books, he had not read anything about Supreme Bones.

In other words, a Supreme Bone was related to the mysterious workings of the Heavenly Daos. It could not be recorded on paper.

Long Chen instantly thought of his own Supreme Bone that had been taken from him. Back then, he hadn’t killed Long Aotian in hopes of using the latter as bait to find his parents.

But Long Aotian was taken away by people not long after ascending. Furthermore, it was said that his entire family had moved. Thinking about it, it was likely due to his Supreme Bone. The Long family definitely didn’t dare to tarry when it came to a genius with a Supreme Bone.

“Good thing I didn’t kill him back then. Otherwise, the talent that my parents bestowed on me would have been lost. It seems that I’ll need to think of a way to take back what is mine,” muttered Long Chen.

Long Chen’s hatred for Long Aotian was at the very peak. Back then, Long Chen had almost torn him into pieces. But in order to search for his parents, Long Chen had left him alive.

Now it seemed that this decision was extremely correct. His Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone were still being nourished in Long Aotian’s body. Whatever power that had picked him up would nourish his talent, and the next time Long Chen saw Long Aotian, he would pluck the talent that they nourished.

“Are you so scared that you’re talking to yourself? Hahaha, humans are simply an inferior race. In front of absolute power, you can only kneel on the ground and beg for mercy. Well, go ahead and beg. I want to see just how wretched the human race is.” Seeing Long Chen muttering to himself as he eyed his black arm, Alldevil Tianye laughed.

It seemed as if he had absolute control now, and he coldly overlooked the entire battlefield. He was in no rush. It seemed that he was enjoying people’s expressions of despair.

People truly were terrified and felt despair. They didn’t know what a Supreme Bone was, but as experts, they could clearly sense that Alldevil Tianye possessed a violent power as vast as a sea. This kind of power could destroy the entire world, and they were no different than ants in front of Alldevil Tianye.

In front of this absolute power, any schemes and plans were nonsense. There was nothing that smarts could do. The only thing that they could do was wait for death.

“Everyone, start secretly recovering your energy. Prepare for the final battle,” Guo Ran transmitted orders to everyone.

“Is there a need for this?” Leng Hui bitterly smiled. In his opinion, everything was already over.

“What bullshit are you spouting? My boss is unrivaled. I told you to recover, so focus on recovering. We still need to avenge the dean and the others, right?” Guo Ran glared at him.

Hence, everyone started secretly recovering their energy. They could only place all their hopes on Long Chen now.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Standing in the air, Long Chen looked at Alldevil Tianye. In front of his provocation, Long Chen calmly said, “You fought me for so long because you were storing up energy to activate this Supreme Bone?”

“Correct. The Supreme Bone can normally only be summoned at the Devil King realm. My realm isn’t high enough. Hence, if I want to activate it, I must push myself to the very limit before I can awaken it. The Supreme Bone’s power is something that you cannot imagine. Even I, if I were to directly summon its power, would be directly blasted apart simply due to how powerful it is. Now do you understand the difference between us?” asked Alldevil Tianye.

These words pushed people further into despair. Even someone as powerful as Alldevil Tianye would need to raise the power of his physical body to the very peak before he could control this power. Then just how terrifying would it be once its power was unleashed?

Long Chen rested the Minghong Saber on his shoulder. That one action caused Guo Ran’s blood to blaze excitedly. “Watch closely! Boss is about to go all-out!”

“You mean that… boss Long Chen still isn’t fighting all-out?” Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others were astonished.

“Isn’t that nonsense? If Alldevil Tianye wasn’t going all-out, how could boss have used up all his power? Just remember this. In this world, there is no one that can defeat boss within the same realm!” declared Guo Ran proudly. He had even more confidence in Long Chen than Long Chen himself.

Long Chen took a few steps forward. It was like he was leisurely walking through his own courtyard. No one knew what he was thinking.

As he walked, he said, “That means that your way of thinking is the same as mine. I also have a kind of power that I can’t fully control. I only dare to use it once the warm-up is over. Otherwise, even before I kill my enemies, my own body will be unable to endure it. In truth, I really hate myself for not being able to finish my warm-up sooner. Otherwise, you would already be one of the souls killed by my saber, and those seniors wouldn’t have had to die. Well, saying that is meaningless. Right now, all I can do is use your life as an offering to their spirits. Prepare yourself. I’m coming!”

Long Chen’s speed suddenly accelerated. He was like a bolt of lightning shooting at Alldevil Tianye. At this moment, his Minghong Saber rumbled and nine hundred and ninety-nine stars lit up on its blade as brightly as the suns.
