Chapter 2180 What is Wildly Arrogant

Dongfang Yuyang and the others slowly approached. However, they were intentionally going slow. None of them wanted to be the first, so they maintained a steady speed.

“You insignificant character, die!” Seeing Dongfang Yuyang and the others approaching, Shi Lingfeng roared. Even after fighting Guo Ran for so long, he was unable to do anything to him.

A giant image appeared behind him. As a result, Guo Ran instantly felt an immense feeling of danger.

Guo Ran raised both sabers in front of him and activated his full defensive power, but he was still sent flying by Shi Lingfeng’s punch. He coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Shi Lingfeng had summoned some kind of power that was able to injure Guo Ran through his armor. But what shocked Guo Ran more was that this foreign energy was suppressing his Blood Qi.

“The Stone Emperor’s spirit? He actually summoned it!”

This power, this was not Sovereign might, it was Emperor might. There was no mistake. Shi Lingfeng was actually using the power that Shi Changsheng had left behind.

“Die!”

Shi Lingfeng unleashed a second punch, the air of an Emperor fully erupting. However, this world-shaking attack was easily dodged by Guo Ran.

Standing in the sky, Guo Ran nodded. “Yes, not bad. Now you finally are showing some skill. You’re qualified to exchange blows against boss. Work hard. I look favorably upon you.”

Guo Ran turned and fled. Shi Lingfeng’s Emperor might was affecting the circulation of his Blood Qi. In that kind of state, Guo Ran couldn’t fight him. In any case, he had finished showing off. It was time to pack it in before he was exposed.

“Boss, save me!” Guo Ran transmitted to Long Chen.

Actually, Long Chen was already moving before Guo Ran even spoke.

“Split the Heavens 8!” Long Chen swung Evilmoon.

“The same old move? Die!” Shi Lingfeng sneered, and his Emperor might crashed down upon Long Chen as he smashed a fist.

When the aura of an Emperor was added to Shi Lingfeng’s attack, it shook the very stars. Many people thought that this attack would be enough to take Long Chen’s life.

Evilmoon’s two dragon marks lit up, and a ferocious aura erupted out of it. Shi Lingfeng’s fist crumbled. The immense power cut apart his arm.

Evilmoon rumbled, leaving a dragon cry in the air that squeezed people’s souls.

Shi Lingfeng let out a pained groan as he flew back. Even with his Emperor might, he was defeated.

Before he could recover, Shi Lingfeng’s body, which was tougher than a divine item, was cut in two by a second strike from Long Chen’s saber. His golden blood flew.

“Heavens!”

Both the senior generation and the junior generation stared in shock at Long Chen. How was it that today’s Long Chen was so terrifying?

“His divine item is finally awake? Hehe, finally, this is the Long Chen that I know.” Mo Nian nodded, seeing the air coming from Evilmoon.

Last time, because Long Chen hadn’t had a divine item working with him, they hadn’t been able to keep Kun Pengzi behind. Now Long Chen had leaped in power.

Long Chen sliced apart Shi Lingfeng’s arm with his first attack, cut him in two with his second, and then his third attack came, his movements flowing smoothly like water. His third saber was right in front of Shi Lingfeng’s head in an instant.

“No!” The Stone race’s experts charged over, but they were too far away to help.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber stabbed into Shi Lingfeng’s forehead. However, at that exact moment, the crystals shining on Shi Lingfeng’s body went dim, and all their power gathered into a shield in front of Long Chen’s saber. A powerful explosion occurred, and while Shi Lingfeng managed to escape alive, even the illusory image behind him was destroyed.

Long Chen snorted and caught up to him with a single step, sweeping out his saber. Shi Lingfeng’s head went flying.

“Now let’s see how you block it.” Once again, Long Chen stabbed his saber at Shi Lingfeng’s head.

Shi Lingfeng’s incredibly tough body was cut easily by the current Evilmoon. After awakening, Evilmoon had recovered its divine power.

Suddenly, a ray of light shot over from the side. Even before it arrived, Long Chen felt a sensation of mortal danger.

If he wanted to kill Shi Lingfeng, he would have to take this attack. If he blocked this attack, he would lose his chance to kill Shi Lingfeng.

Long Chen saw that the light was a silver shield, which had come from Dongfang Yuyang. He had finally taken action.

“The Dongfang family’s priceless treasure, the Star Shield. It’s a set with the Star Spear. It is said that the set was created from the metal of thousands of stars that had fallen to the land,” cried out someone who recognized the origin of that shield.

Long Chen had no choice but to give up killing Shi Lingfeng. His saber slammed into the shield, causing a huge explosion of divine light. It was like a star had exploded.

Long Chen spun from the impact, but borrowing the force of the revolution, he kicked Shi Lingfeng’s head.

Shi Lingfeng’s head transformed into a ray of light that charged toward the other experts rushing over.

His head happened to go toward the Corrupt path’s people. Tian Xiezi’s expression changed. If they stopped Shi Lingfeng’s head with a divine item, then Shi Lingfeng would be killed.

“Get out of the way!” shouted Tian Xiezi. However, that head was like a cannon, and many people were unable to dodge it. It passed through the Corrupt path’s army, killing thousands.

“Nice, well done. Be even wilder...” The old man was cheering Long Chen on from amongst the crowd, while Boss Bao and the others followed along, as if they were the ones fighting.

“Long Chen, I misjudged you. I didn’t think you were a traitor of the Martial Heaven Continent. You betrayed my trust. Today, I’ll personally take your head to give an explanation to the Martial Heaven Continent.” Dongfang Yuyang caught his shield. With the shield in his left hand and a silver spear in his right hand, he charged at Long Chen, waves of silver light filling the air.

“Give it up. When you invited me to the gathering of past and present heroes, you secretly created conflicts between me and others. Did you think I didn’t know? You pretended to be a good person while secretly plotting against me. Do you think someone like that can become a Sovereign? Do you think wearing white will cover up the darkness in your heart? The Sovereigns were all noble and upright. A hypocrite like you will never become one,” sneered Long Chen. With Evilmoon on his shoulder, his black clothes and hair danced in the wind.

“A bunch of nonsense. Do you think anyone would believe you?” Dongfang Yuyang laughed and stabbed his spear forward. Countless spear-images appeared, looking like a lotus in bloom.

Every spear-image contained immense power, and there were millions of them. People couldn’t even tell which was the real one.

“A flashy trick with no real power. It’s just as fake as you.” Long Chen let out a casual swing of his saber. The spear-images vanished, his saber having caught the real one. “I didn’t expose you before because my wings hadn’t grown yet and I didn’t want to implicate others. But now, I’ve grown up, as have my brothers. Who would bother to continue playing this game with you?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Evilmoon pushed forward, and the immense power made Dongfang Yuyang take many steps back. Every step he was forced back caused the void beneath him to crumble.

“Long Chen, you colluded with the original devil race and you still dare to talk like this? You’re too wildly arrogant! I, Ximen Tianxiong, will handle you.”

Long Chen had just forced back Dongfang Yuyang when Ximen Tianxiong arrived, a blood-colored saber in his hand emitting a ferocious aura. A tiger cry rang out.

“It’s the Ximen family’s Five Tiger Heaven Breaking Saber.” People’s hearts shook. As expected, everyone had come prepared. Even ancient inherited divine items had been brought, items that hadn’t seen the light of day in thousands of years.

“Just this is wildly arrogant? Then you haven’t seen the rest of the world. You have yet to see my wildly arrogant side!”

With just a light block, Long Chen locked Evilmoon against Ximen Tianxiong’s saber. He was able to freely control his power, going from fierce to soft as he pleased.

Evilmoon had grown much stronger after awakening, and Long Chen could control it easier as well. They no longer needed to fight while being careful about every little bit of power they used. The current Evilmoon was like a part of him, giving him a feeling of a tiger that had been given wings.

Ximen Tianxiong’s arms bulged as his power crazily grew and he pressed forward. However, Long Chen continued to block him with just one hand. All of Ximen Tianxiong’s power was unable to rattle him in the slightest.

“Do you want to know what real wild arrogance is?” Long Chen asked Ximen Tianxiong.
