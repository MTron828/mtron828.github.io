“You can’t blame me! That person actually tried to slap me in the face! Before I could even react… I was already out!” Long Chen hastily explained himself when he saw the old man shuddering with anger.

This time, it really wasn’t Long Chen’s fault. This illusion was too lifelike. The first time, someone had provoked him, cursing his mother, and it had resulted in Long Chen killing him with a punch.

Although Long Chen knew that it was just an illusion, he was instantly enraged when someone insulted the mother that he respected.

This time, he had been planning on turning a deaf ear to everything around him. As a result, one person had instantly shot up to him and tried to slap him.

Without even having a chance to think, Long Chen had slapped him back. By the time he remembered that he couldn’t fight back, he had been sent back out.

However, he was a bit guilty with his explanation because as soon as he had been sent out, he had jumped back in before the old man noticed.

As a result, that person appeared again, getting right in his face. So Long Chen had slapped him again.

Hence, he was sent out again, dumbfounded by why that person was always against him. That hesitation was then noticed by the old man. Seeing him standing there foolishly, he thought that Long Chen hadn’t entered yet.

“Can you be serious? What kind of time is it for your jokes?!” The old man grabbed Long Chen’s shoulders and shouted at him. His white hair was standing on end. He looked like he was going to explode because he thought that Long Chen was intentionally messing around now.

“Old man, I wouldn’t mind climbing a mountain of blades or jumping into boiling oil. Even if you told me to go take my blade and slaughter the divine families, I wouldn’t frown. But when it comes to this… I really can’t do it. Although I know a man can’t say that they can’t, I really can’t. I can’t hold myself back,” said Long Chen helplessly.

This trial might not be difficult for others, but it was impossible for him. Long Chen had already come to a realization. Entering this training ground was being passively drawn into the Heavens’ Wrath state. But who could endure constantly being aggrieved and having nowhere to vent, and then suddenly having some idiot come up to you and curse you?

Even if he repeatedly told himself that everything in that world was fake and an illusion, he wouldn’t care after going inside.

“Even if you can’t endure it, you have to endure. How else are you going to train in the ninth form of Split the Heavens? Teaching it to you would be killing you,” said the old man darkly.

“Don’t panic. There will always be a solution. We can slowly figure it out. I want to see how Bao Buping, Chang Hao, and the others do first,” said Long Chen, urging the old man to sit and calm down.

“I’m curious, weren’t you bullied back when you were young? Why is it that you can’t endure any grievance at all? Why is your self-control so lacking?” asked the old man.

“Wasn’t it a case of being suppressed to the point of rebelling? After being bullied enough, it became unacceptable to suffer the slightest bit. If I were to return to that time in my youth, I probably wouldn’t live past a single day. My soul is also merged with my blade, Evilmoon. I’m affected by it as well,” said Long Chen.

“You shameless bastard, you dare to blame me?!” cursed Evilmoon.

Long Chen ignored Evilmoon. Long Chen knew that his will was affected, but it was from the Pill Sovereign memories. However, mentioning the Pill Sovereign was taboo. He didn’t dare to say it, so he blamed it on Evilmoon.

Although he had never explained Evilmoon’s origin, the old man was well aware that this was a sinister divine item. The Heaven Spitting Blade’s senses told him just how terrifying it was.

The old man frowned but couldn’t think of any solution. Time passed. After two hours, Bao Buping came out. Following him was Chang Hao. The two came out at almost the exact same time.

Both of them were in frightening states. Their eyes were scarlet, and blood was leaking out of the corner of their mouths. They had bitten through their lips, and their teeth had shattered from being clenched so hard. The veins on their foreheads were bulging.

“Not bad. You’ve just barely reached the initial requirements for training in the ninth form of Split the Heavens. If you go through the training a few more times, you’ll get accustomed.” The old man nodded with some rare praise.

Bao Buping and Chang Hao were delighted to hear this. However, their expressions then grew odd when they looked at Long Chen.

“Long Chen, did you fail again?”

“Again… yes, well said.” Long Chen nodded and raised a thumb.

Just at this moment, several other bosses came out. They only lasted a few more breaths than Bao Buping and Chang Hao.

“You’ve surprised me.” The old man looked at them oddly.

It truly was unexpected. Bao Buping and Chang Hao’s display had been a bit surprising. However, the one that he had had the greatest hopes for, Long Chen, irritated him the most.

The void suddenly twisted, and the old man brought them to a barren land. The aura of the Heavenly Daos was extremely weak here. Bao Buping and Chang Hao were Empyreans, but they felt that even summoning their manifestations was extremely taxing here.

“This is another cultivation area. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet has absorbed the laws of the Heavenly Daos and diluted them for this training area. Compared to the Martial Heaven Continent, there is only one-thousandth of the Heavenly Dao energy here. This is the best place to train in the ninth form. Qifeng, you start. Activate the Heavens’ Wrath state and exchange a blow with me,” said the old man to Boss Bao. Only now did Long Chen learn Boss Bao’s full name.

Boss Bao nodded. His aura suddenly changed. A violent aura erupted, and his manifestation instantly appeared. Long Chen could clearly sense the laws of heaven and earth fluctuating.

Boss Bao’s fury was like a blazing fire that slowly ignited the Heavenly Dao energy here. It slowly spread.

After that, explosive sounds rang out from the void. Boss Bao’s hair whipped in an invisible wind. His appearance was like that of an angry lion.

The old man suddenly rapped Boss Bao in the face with his cane, twisting his entire head. He shouted, “You’re not angry enough! This isn’t enough to flow out and become one with heaven and earth!”

This strike from the old man caused Boss Bao’s fury to soar. Blazing flames spread out of his manifestation. It was as if this attack from the old man hadn’t just struck Boss Bao’s face but also the face of the Heavenly Daos. The Heavenly Daos were enraged.

“Do you see? This is the state. Have your own fury merge with the fury of the Heavenly Daos. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. A manifestation can only borrow the power of the Heavenly Daos, but that energy is limited. By drawing forth the Heavens’ Wrath, you merge with the Heavenly Daos to unleash explosive power,” said the old man.

Boss Bao suddenly roared, and his broadsword came out of its sheath. In that instant, the void let out a mournful whine.

“What a terrifying attack.” Long Chen was shocked. The power of this attack was more than ten times stronger than one of Boss Bao’s normal attacks.

The old man then switched out his cane for the Heaven Splitting Blade. An explosion erupted when their weapons met, and qi waves blew back Bao Buping and the others.

Despite trying to stay rooted, Long Chen was also blown back dozens of meters. Two long ditches were left in the ground.

“The power of this attack can match the Blood race’s Sovereign sprout…” Long Chen’s heart shook. Boss Bao’s attack was actually this terrifying.

Boss Bao was also blown back after this attack. He tried to get up, but he was powerless to stand. In the end, it was the seventh boss who helped him up. Even so, his body was constantly twitching. His face was pale. Even his eyes had dimmed. That appearance worried everyone.

The old man said, “No need to be afraid. This is the normal reaction. Qifeng, well done. You did better than I did back in the day. Perhaps this is the benefit of slowly building up a firm foundation. Due to my realm being lower, the backlash was smaller for me. But your realms are stronger, and your senses toward the Heavenly Daos are also stronger, so it is more difficult to control it the first time.

“This is the power of the Heavens’ Wrath state. It can unleash all your power. However, you have to hold back the slightest bit of power. That power is for keeping your own life, to resist the backlash of the Heavenly Dao energy. If you don’t keep that bit of energy in reserve, you will die.

“To preserve that bit of energy requires preserving your mind in this state. Qifeng, just now, you managed to keep three percent of your energy. That’s quite impressive. The backlash is rather strong for the first time. If you had only preserved one percent of your energy, you would have instantly lost consciousness. If you hadn’t kept even one percent, then because this place is the world of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, you wouldn’t have died, but you would be unconscious for up to a month. On the other hand, on the Martial Heaven Continent, you will need to hold back ninety percent of your power if you want to keep your life. The laws of the Heavenly Daos are a thousand times stronger on the continent than here. However, if you hold back ninety percent of your power, what would be the point of this attack? Its power would be less than the eighth form then. That’s why if you want to control the Heavens’ Wrath, you need to continue training here. Once you can control your emotions, you can unleash your full power.”

“I’ll try it!” Bao Buping charged out. As a result, he had only just started accumulating energy when he was knocked down by the old man.

“Brat, did you hear me? I told you that if you don’t hold back some energy you’ll be unconscious for a month. Who has the time to wait for you?” The old man cursed him furiously. He even kicked him at the end.

“All of you, come up one at a time. Long Chen, you go last. Old two, you start,” shouted the old man. The second boss thickened his face and stepped forward.
