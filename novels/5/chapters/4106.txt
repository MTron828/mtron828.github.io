Chapter 4095 Old Friend From the Academy

Xia Chen sent the flying boat toward the battlefield. As they got closer, the fluctuations grew increasingly intense.

From the distance, divine radiance shook the nine heavens, causing the very void to constantly explode. It was a shocking battle. To their surprise, they sensed not just one Heaven Venerate battling but around four or more.

“Why is this aura so familiar?” Long Chen’s heart shook once they got closer. “I’m going on ahead!”

Long Chen felt the flying boat was too slow, so his Kunpeng wings spread, and he transformed into a streak of light.

With Long Chen’s speed, he left the flying boat far behind in an instant and quickly saw four figures. When he saw one of them in particular, he couldn’t help feeling flabbergasted.

“Xu Changchuan!”

This man had once been called the number one handsome man of the High Firmament Academy. However, after the Nine Prefecture Convention, Xu Changchuan had silently vanished and never sent back word. Qin Feng even joked at the time that he had run away in anger after failing in his pursuit of Bai Shishi.

Long Chen hadn’t expected to see Xu Changchuan after so long. So the latter had actually come to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

Xu Changchuan had summoned his manifestation, wherein a resplendent full moon gleamed. Remarkably, he was personally engaged in combat against a Heaven Venerate adversary. By his side was another Heaven Venerate fighting against an opponent of the same rank.

All four of their manifestations gave off similar fluctuations, and the auras of their Blood Qi and souls were all similar. It seemed that they came from the same race

Their Blood Qis were all extremely powerful. At this time, Long Chen noticed that Xu Changchuan’s body gave off an immemorial aura. He had to be an immemorial demonic beast, or he wouldn’t possess such terrifying Blood Qi.

However, even with his immense power, he was still in the Immortal King realm after all and was outmatched by his opponent, so he had no choice but to rely on his Heaven Venerate companion to hold on.

The two of them were at a clear disadvantage and were repeatedly being pressed back. It didn’t look like they would last for much longer.

“Xu Changchuan, accept your fate. The mantle of the Fullmoon race's heir shall not belong to you!" mocked the Heaven Venerate who was targeting Xu Changchuan.

“Despicable! You aren’t afraid of me settling the bill with you once I become the successor?!” roared Xu Changchuan.

“You think that you’ll get to become the successor? Keep dreaming. In your next life, remember to know your own limits,” sneered his opponent.

BOOM!

Just then, his opponent stabbed a bone spear at him. Xu Changchuan’s bone spear then exploded, causing him to cough up blood.

“Young master!” The Heaven Venerate beside Xu Changchuan roared. He wanted to save him, but his opponent completely locked him down, preventing him from charging over.

“Time for you to die.” Xu Changchuan’s opponent laughed and stabbed his bone spear at Xu Changchuan.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Just wait. Even if I become a ghost, I won’t let you off.” Xu Changchuan could only glare resentfully at the bone spear, not closing his eyes. It was his final stubborn resistance.

The bone spear fell, yet the Heaven Venerate only saw a flash of gold before realizing that he missed. Somehow, Xu Changchuan had vanished.

On the other hand, Xu Changchuan had accepted his fate. Thus, he was shocked to find that someone had come to save him. When he saw who it was, he was even more shocked.

“Long Chen!”

“Brother Changchuan, it’s been a long time!” said Long Chen with a smile.

“You dare to interfere in the affairs of my Fullmoon race? You are courting death!” The Heaven Venerate furiously attacked Long Chen.

“In this world, is there anything that I, Long Chen, don’t dare to do?” Long Chen snorted and slashed the Minghong Saber out.

With a heaven-shaking explosion, both Long Chen and the Heaven Venerate swayed and forced back a few steps.

That Heaven Venerate’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected that a seemingly insignificant Immortal King could wield such formidable strength, matching him evenly in battle. Astonishingly, this puny Immortal King was even stronger than Xu Changchuan.

Seeing Long Chen force back the Heaven Venerate, Xu Changchuan was shocked. At the same time, he realized that his life was saved.

“Who are you?! Do you know that interfering in the affairs of my Fullmoon race will implicate your entire family?!” roared that person.

“Shut your mouth. I dislike it when others threaten me. Are you forcing me to kill you?” Long Chen’s expression grew cold.

He didn’t truly understand what was going on here, and he didn’t like being drawn into such a thing. But since he knew Xu Changchuan, he couldn’t just watch him die.

Although the two of them weren’t close, they had still fought alongside each other in the Nine Prefecture Convention. At that crucial moment, Xu Changchuan had stood by Long Chen’s side. Thus, Long Chen naturally couldn’t just watch as he was killed.

Moreover, this hateful fellow actually kept threatening him, saying that he was courting death, that his family would be destroyed. In an instant, Long Chen’s fury was ignited.

“Don’t force my boss. If you want, come at me, Guo Ran! Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

When the flying boat arrived, the Dragonblood warriors flew out, led by Guo Ran.

“This damn brat.”

Long Chen cursed inside. This fellow was too impatient, actually launching a killing blow before even figuring out what was going on here. Guo Ran was clearly afraid of Long Chen making the first move, leaving him no chance to show off.

BOOM!

The Heaven Venerate’s attention was on Long Chen, so when this attack came, his rushed attempt to block left him disadvantaged. As a result, the explosive power behind Guo Ran’s attack destroyed half his body, and he tumbled back into the distance.

In an instant, the appearance of Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion caused the tides of battle to turn. The other enemy Heaven Venerate was shocked and enraged. However, when he saw Uncle Tree on the flying boat, his pupils shrank.

Suddenly, he unleashed a fierce attack to force back his opponent and then flew off, grabbing his injured comrade on the way. After that, they directly vanished.

“Many thanks for saving my life. I will remember this.” Xu Changchuan looked at Long Chen gratefully.

Just now, it really had been dangerous. He had only been the slightest bit away from dying.

The other Heaven Venerate then came over. He hastily thanked Long Chen as well while also examining Xu Changchuan’s injuries. Seeing that they weren’t too bad, he finally relaxed.

“Let’s leave here first before talking.”

Long Chen beckoned for the two of them to get on the flying boat. After that, they sped off. Once they left, Long Chen asked, “Brother, you suddenly left without leaving a word. We were concerned.”

“I truly apologize. An urgent matter left me with no choice but to rush over here, but it was truly rude for me to not say anything,” apologized Xu Changchuan.

Long Chen knew that it must be an internal matter of the Fullmoon race, hence, he refrained from prying. After exchanging a few words, Xu Changchuan ended up falling silent, and the atmosphere became a bit awkward.

Xu Changchuan suddenly gritted his teeth and looked at Long Chen.

“Brother Long, this junior brother needs your help.”
