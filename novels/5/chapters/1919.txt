Chapter 1909 Evil Spirit Hell, Heavenly Evil Death Blow

Translator: BornToBe

“Ice Seals the Land, World of Absolute Zero.”

The most terrifying one was Ye Zhiaqiu. Her manifestation unleashed a terrifying cold wave. It was so cold that Ye Zhiqiu had to distance herself from her allies as her ice domain was too terrifying.

The surviving Life Star Empyreans were mostly injured, and some were even on the verge of death. When this terrifying Ice Qi struck them, they were powerless to resist.

They instantly transformed into ice statues. In the next instant, the statues would crack, eventually shattering into ice powder.

If they weren’t injured, these powerful Life Star Empyreans would be able to rely on their cultivation base and world energy to resist Ye Zhiqiu’s Ice Qi, but now the Ice Qi became a killing blow.

Those Life Star Empyreans shattered one by one. The mildly injured ones tried to resist, but before they could run, they were slain by Ye Zhiqiu’s ice sword. That ice sword was a precious treasure of the Divine Ice Palace.

Ye Zhiqiu was just the prelude. Yue Zifeng’s sword took the life of a Life Star Empyrean with each attack. He never missed.

The body of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow appeared in the sky, flying back and forth. Cloud targeted the Life Star Empyreans that were further away and might escape. In front of her terrifying speed, running was a joke.

Liu Ruyan and Chu Yao were in control of the entire battlefield. The body of the Undying Willow spread, and the two of them prevented this group from running.

Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Ye Lingshan, and the others pounced on the Life Star Empyreans. On the other hand, the Dragonblood warriors were bringing up the rear. The big attack had sucked up all their energy.

However, using up all their energy on that one attack had been entirely worth it. Not a scrap of their energy had been wasted. It could even be described as the winning blow.

There were less than five hundred surviving Life Star Empyreans, and with the majority of them injured, they were hunted down miserably without having time to heal.

Worst of all, the lightning drakes that Long Chen had summoned were still attacking them.

As for Long Chen himself, his black scales were still shining, and his giant lightning wings were in constant motion. His fight against Huo Lieyun, Xie Luo, and True Immortal Jiaoqi was actually growing more intense.

“I said that I could last until the sixth month of next year, but it seems you won’t even be able to last a day,” said Long Chen. His attacks made his three opponents sweat.

“You’re just bragging! I refuse to believe it!” howled True Immortal Jiaoqi as he continued to crazily fight. As a result, he was sent flying by a strike from Long Chen’s saber. Long Chen’s current power was so great that True Immortal Jiaoqi was nothing. If it weren’t for Huo Lieyun and Xie Luo fighting alongside him, then considering his foolish way of fighting in head-on clashes like this, he would have long since been killed by Long Chen.

Long Chen was actually in a rush. While these lightning drakes were coming from another world, he was the one providing the energy to keep the spatial channel open.

Maintaining that channel didn’t just require a huge amount of spiritual yuan but also the power of his Yuan Spirit. His Yuan Spirit was already feeling like it was going to tear apart. He was overdrafting his Spiritual Strength.

Lasting until the sixth month of next year was definitely a joke. He wouldn’t even be able to last half a day. His big words were just used to intimidate his enemies.

However, even if it was just a bluff, Long Chen’s power backed up his words. Lightning continued to surge throughout this world, pressuring the Life Star Empyreans. Without the interference of these lightning drakes, the sneak attack of the Dragonblood Legion wouldn’t have had such effect.

Just at this moment, the lightning channel shuddered and Long Chen’s expression twitched.

Suddenly, the lightning drakes gave up on their opponents and shot straight back to the lightning channel.

“Damnit, my Yuan Spirit is out of power. I can’t maintain the channel. The lightning field is automatically summoning the lightning drakes back!” Long Chen’s heart shook. This lightning paragon art was a kind of law and also a kind of contract. He could summon the lightning field’s energy to help him fight, but he had to maintain the channel.

As the channel ran out of energy, once it was about to collapse, it would trigger the lightning field’s laws. At that time, the lightning field would automatically keep the channel open, but only for a few seconds to draw back all the lightning energy belonging to it.

In less than a breath’s time, all the lightning filling this world vanished. The lightning channel behind Long Chen closed and vanished.

“His paragon art has reached its limit! We can still kill him!” roared Huo Lieyun. He recalled his flame giant, instead taking out a diagram. When that diagram appeared, everyone’s expressions changed.

“The Brahma Divine Diagram!”

This diagram was Pill Valley’s peerless treasure, the Brahma Divine Diagram. The void trembled around it, and a ray of divine light shot toward Long Chen.

Long Chen’s lightning wings hastily brought him away. Long Chen knew that if he was enveloped by that light, he would be drawn into the Brahma Divine Diagram.

If he was trapped inside, it would only take a few breaths’ time for Huo Lieyun, True Immortal Jiaoqi, and Xie Luo to attack the Dragonblood Legion and cause an unbearable result.

Huo Lieyun suddenly clapped his hands together. His forehead split open, and drops of essence blood flew out, transforming into lotus runes that merged into the Brahma Divine Diagram. He began to chant a scripture, and more of his essence blood flowed into it.

The Brahma Divine Diagram began shining brightly. The mountains and rivers, the sun, moon, and stars within the diagram began to quiver. Rays of divine light shot out at Long Chen.

Clearly, Huo Lieyun’s power was not at the realm of being able to control the Brahma Divine Diagram. He was forced to offer up his essence blood to activate it. That was a self-destructive method.

He no longer had any choice. If he didn’t, there would be no way to suppress Long Chen, and then their entire mission would end in failure.

The Brahma Divine Diagram erupted with divine light thanks to Huo Lieyun’s essence blood. That light crashed down on Long Chen. This time, there was nowhere to run. Huo Lieyun was forcing him into a head-on clash.

“Fuck, so he still had such a move. I can only go all-out.”

The divine light of the Brahma Divine Diagram filled the world. Long Chen had nowhere to run, so he raised Evilmoon, pointing it at the sky. A black saber-image condensed in the air, piercing the dome of the sky. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A fierce will erupted. That was a will to slice through the restrictions of heaven and earth, a will to charge through any tribulations, a will to slaughter anyone who tried to stop him, be it a man or a god.

“Split the Heavens 7!”

The black saber-image crashed down like a black river of stars, striking the Brahma Divine Diagram.

BOOM!

The entire world instantly lost all its color. Terrifying divine might exploded, and the world turned dark.

The void rumbled and shook. Fragments of spacetime clashed, unleashing giant ripples. It was like heaven and earth had been separated, turning into two separate worlds. All the experts present were sent flying.

This was a truly world-destroying exchange. Every expert was sent flying into the distance. It was unknown just how far some of them flew.

This was a blow that almost shattered the wall of this world. Long Chen and Huo Lieyun were both pale as paper, hacking up blood. Cracks had appeared all over their bodies.

The huge backlash was something that neither Evilmoon nor the Brahma Divine Diagram could block, causing their two masters to almost be killed.

Long Chen extracted the life energy inside the primal chaos bead, instantly healing. He shot toward Huo Lieyun, wanting to eliminate the latter while he was still injured. Long Chen definitely couldn’t give him another chance to activate the Brahma Divine Diagram. He was taking advantage of the primal chaos space.

Just as he moved, a giant figure appeared behind him. It was a giant qilin with an extra-long tail. Blood Qi and flames soared out of it.

It was True Immortal Jiaoqi. He had taken this form through igniting his blood soul and essence blood. After he opened his mouth, the qilin halberd actually shot out of it.

“Qilin Blood Soul attack!”

This was the strongest divine ability of the qilin-drake race and was something True Immortal Jiaoqi could only unleash by igniting his blood soul and essence blood. That was a terrifying price, but this move was also a peerless attack.

“Split the Heavens 7!” Long Chen roared again.

BOOM!

Long Chen miserably flew back, tumbling back and coughing up blood. His entire body hurt. It felt like he was about to collapse.

“Damnit, the Yin Yang Immortal Grass is out of energy!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. The first time he had activated the seventh form of Split the Heavens, his meridians had received a heavy impact. However, the next time he used it, the Yin Yang Immortal Grass had helped him bear the impact. He had learned from it.

Hence, he had borrowed the power of the root of the Yin Yang Immortal Grass in the primal chaos space for this. It had only grown to around three hundred meters, and after enduring the impact of this attack twice, it was starting to wither. That meant that he couldn’t use the seventh form of Split the Heavens again, or his meridians wouldn’t be able to bear it.

“Evil Spirit Hell, Heavenly Evil Death Blow!”

Just at this moment, a giant blood-colored figure appeared. It had a pair of bat-like wings, and it held a crescent moon blood blade in its hand, slashing it at Long Chen.

Even before its blade reached him, a terrifying air of death enveloped Long Chen. The howls of ghosts and gods could be heard. This blade was like a fiend’s tooth mercilessly slicing toward him.

Long Chen forced himself to stand and took a deep breath. Such a terrifying attack could only be blocked by the seventh form of Split the Heavens. He had no other choice. Either his meridians broke, or he died. He chose the former.

Just as Long Chen was about to force his meridians to their breaking point to activate the seventh form of Split the Heavens, a figure appeared before him. A jade-like hand stretched out, slashing a white bone sword at the crescent moon blood blade.
