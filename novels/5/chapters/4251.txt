Chapter 4240: Big Trouble

Long Chen’s voice resounded throughout the world, causing heaven and earth to change color and the ten thousand Daos to rumble. His voice contained his undefeatable will, his unquestionable domineeringness, akin to the edict of the very nine heavens, if not even greater. The ten thousand worlds quivered in response because of him.

Upon seeing this scene, the countenance of countless experts directly changed, and in particular, the seniors outside the martial stage were very taken aback.

“What a powerful will. It actually transcends heaven and earth, forcing them to obey his orders. This person’s life is tenacious.”

Among the senior generation, it was well known that the stronger a person’s will, the greater the rejection of the Heavenly Daos. It was because beneath the Heavenly Daos, all things had to obey. A person’s will could not be allowed to exceed the Heavenly Daos.

The Heavenly Daos had to be obeyed, not defied—this was the common knowledge of the cultivation world. However, Long Chen’s roar gave off the feeling of suppressing the very Heavenly Daos.

The fact that his will could reach this level of might showed just how resilient he was. After all, the Heavenly Daos definitely would not permit someone with such a will to exist, so the very fact that he was still alive showed just how tough his life was.

Only the senior generation understood just how frightening that was. On the other hand, the experts on the martial stage didn’t even notice that Long Chen’s voice had caused a change in the Heavenly Daos.

In front of that furious roar, countless people actually felt disdain. They thought that it was a clear attempt to intimidate them with an empty threat. Furthermore, this roar caused them to feel like Ye Wuchen was correct, and Long Chen was angry because he was exposed.

“Long Chen, only one of us will live after today!”

Ye Wuchen’s lively roar rang out, a sign that he had recovered from being slapped in the face by Long Chen. However, his face twisted with fury.

Long Chen’s slap was powerful, but Ye Wuchen had a layer of divine light protecting him, so he wasn’t severely injured. Of course, the power of this attack was always its humiliating aspect, driving him insane.

On the other hand, Long Chen completely ignored Ye Wuchen’s challenge. He shouted to everyone on the martial stage, “For those who trust me, there’s no need for more words, and for those who don’t trust me, more words would still be useless. I, Long Chen, am unafraid of going through mountains of corpses, seas of blood, mountains of blades, and seas of boiling oil. I will protect those whom I want to protect at any cost, and I don’t care how you view me. I will definitely break this trap to protect those I care about. Just know that I am no saint who cares about you, and I also won’t bother explaining myself to you. All I will say is that this trap will be destroyed by me, and those who block me will die!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, his wings spread, and like a bolt of lightning, he instantly appeared in front of a pillar of light. There was a dark domain lord roaring inside of it, and it was Long Chen’s target.

“You’re the one who’s going to die, you swindling idiot.”

Out of nowhere, a frigid gust of wind swept through, shrouded in an ominous black mist. In the wake of this eerie phenomenon, a phantom-like figure materialized and viciously thrust a black claw toward Long Chen. It was none other than the Ghost Dao lifeform.

This lifeform was ephemeral, as if he didn’t possess a solid body. Thus, no one knew how he had suddenly appeared here.

However, Long Chen knew that these people would not sit still while he destroyed the grand formation. As a golden light blazed on his left hand, dragon scales appeared on top of it. With a fierce determination, he also unleashed a claw attack of his own.

BOOM!

A golden dragon claw clashed with a black claw. The impact caused golden light and black mist to explode, sending a ripple that spread throughout the battlefield. The next moment, both Long Chen and that Ghost Dao lifeform let out a muffled grunt and retreated, being evenly matched in this exchange.

After that, the ripple that spread from their exchange destroyed countless dark creatures, causing a large space to instantly open on the martial stage.

“Die!”

Out of nowhere, Sword Qi came from behind Long Chen. It was Ye Wuchen.

“Despicable.” Yue Zifeng snorted coldly. While Ye Wuchen was undeniably a sword cultivator, a strong one at that, both of his attacks were nothing more than sneak attacks. Especially the last one, it was timed just after Long Chen’s clash with the Ghost Dao lifeform, exploiting the brief time when his Blood Qi was in turmoil from the impact.

Yue Zifeng would have remained silent if another expert had resorted to sneak attacks. However, the fact that Ye Wuchen, a sword cultivator, employed such underhanded tactics deeply irked him

In response, Long Chen spun through the air, his dragon claw slamming into Ye Wuchen’s sword. This unexpected maneuver elicited gasps of astonishment from everyone, as most of them had assumed that he would attempt to evade the strike. Unexpectedly, he was receiving the attack head-on, placing him at an immense disadvantage. Having just clashed with the Ghost Dao lifeform, he had yet to recover, making such a hasty confrontation a risky move.

On the other hand, Ye Wuchen was in top condition with a fully prepared attack. Were Long Chen’s actions not too reckless?

However, in front of countless shocked gazes, the clash they expected didn’t occur. Instead, there was a strange sound as Long Chen’s dragon claw changed its direction. Just as his dragon claw touched Ye Wuchen’s sword, instead of a clawing blow, it became a pulling force.

Following that, everyone saw Ye Wuchen go flying like a shooting star.

“What?!”

Everyone was startled. Unexpectedly, Long Chen’s move was a feint, and even Ye Wuchen was tricked.

Perhaps using your enemy’s power to fight them was a common sight amongst normal cultivators, but in a battle between peak experts, it was very rarely attempted, as it was simply too dangerous. The tiniest flaw could reveal a person’s intentions. And once a person saw through a feint, it would be like you were throwing your life to them.

As everyone let out startled cries, Ye Wuchen’s expression changed. He had never imagined that Long Chen’s attack could shift so quickly. At that very moment, he realized that he had been tricked and outmaneuvered.

His body was flying straight toward the light pillar, and he couldn’t stop his own momentum because Long Chen had even added to it in that exchange.

BOOM!

Ye Wuchen smashed right into the light pillar, leaving a dent, but his sword was unable to pierce through it.

As a result, Ye Wuchen coughed up blood. As for the light pillar, it quivered and then returned to its normal state. Ye Wuchen was then sent flying once more. His clothes exploded, leaving him in a wretched state.

Ye Wuchen's full-power assault had been effortlessly repelled. Astonishingly, this seemingly feeble pillar of light remained unscathed, showing no signs of damage whatsoever.

BOOM! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just then, an explosive sound rang out. Mo Nian had attacked another pillar with his crystal coffin. Surprisingly, the light pillar wasn’t even the slightest bit shaken, but his crystal coffin sustained severe cracks.

“Long Chen, this is big trouble.” Mo Nian’s expression changed when he saw this.
