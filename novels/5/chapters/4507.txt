Chapter 4496 Nine Heavenly Gates

Long Chen flew off. He could clearly sense the exit of this world thanks to the nether dragon race leader’s countless years of accumulated energy that stemmed from heaven and earth.

In order to prevent being surrounded, Long Chen rushed over at his top speed. As expected, there was a barrier around it.

The experts of this world clearly had their special means of communication, and they wanted to stop him from leaving.

BOOM!

Long Chen snorted and thrust a lightning spear right at the barrier. As the barrier exploded, Long Chen rushed through with barely a pause.

This barrier was new and made from essence blood power. Due to not having any outstanding formation masters, they needed a long time to strengthen such a barrier. By the time Long Chen arrived, it had only been partially completed and was far from reaching its full strength. Thus, Long Chen barged through effortlessly.

Through the barrier, Long Chen felt a familiar aura. This place was the Darklight Heaven, and here, he finally relaxed.

After returning to the Darklight Heaven, there was nothing to fear. Even if they were to chase him, they would be suppressed by the laws of the Heavenly Daos. And even if Long Chen couldn’t beat them, with his speed, he’d be able to easily flee.

“Even after absorbing the energy of a Saint, I still have a long way to go before I reach that level,” sighed Long Chen.

Saints were truly powerful, and Long Chen only survived their combined attack thanks to the protective prowess of the Earth Cauldron. Fortunately, these people didn’t know its abilities. If they had used divine abilities instead of divine weapons, he would have been dead now.

Today, he had made a fatal mistake—assuming that the Saint he had slain was attempting to possess him.

In truth, that was just his heart’s desire. If he hadn’t clung to that hope and had directly annihilated his target’s Yuan Spirit, those four wouldn’t have had time to react. Perhaps he would have been able to kill another Saint by capitalizing on their weakened condition. Long Chen berated his own foolishness. Was he not aware of his own luck? How could so many good things happen to him at once?

“You’re out!”

Long Chen had just passed through the world gate when he heard a familiar voice and saw a large figure.

“Palace master!”

Long Chen was surprised to see the palace master waiting for him. Yet, the most astounding revelation was that the palace master now exuded a sacred and majestic aura. He had ascended to the Saint realm.

“Excellent. Just as the sweeping elder said, opportunity does lie in crisis. It seems that I was worried for nothing. Let’s go!” The palace master patted Long Chen’s shoulder, nodding in admiration.

Long Chen was moved. It seemed that the palace master had been worried for him and came over. He probably knew what had happened to Long Chen.

“Many thanks, palace master!”

“There’s no need for such words between us. As for those little fish inside, you can ignore them for now. I just received word about manifestations appearing across various worlds—a sign that nine heavenly gates are about to open. Their strongest monsters are about to come out. Many of them are exceptionally formidable entities, capable of cross-realm combat and easily slaying Saints,” conveyed the palace master.

“Easily slay Saints?!” Long Chen couldn’t believe his ears.

With his power, he finally had the ability to fight Saints. However, he couldn’t guarantee anything, and that didn’t mean that he had the power to kill them. Yet, some people could easily slay Saints while fighting across realms? He found it hard to believe.

The palace master sighed. “This is a new era. If it weren’t for the sweeping elder, I’d have missed this era. There are far too many people like me who have been waiting for this era. The regretful thing is that I wasn’t born at the right time, and I encountered the sweeping elder too late. At most, I can only grasp the tail end of this era. However, some people have endured for millions of years and have gone through a thousand nirvanic rebirths just for this chance. These individuals might appear youthful and of a similar age to you, but each of them is a bona fide monster without exception. Every single one possesses an extraordinary background.

“Now that those legendary existences are coming out, none of you can waste any more time. Other people have waited countless years for this era, and the factions supporting them have spent generations laying the groundwork to provide them with the best starting point. In contrast, you only had twenty years to build a foundation—a far cry from the foundations established over billions of years by others. It’s not that you lack brilliance; rather, the heavens haven’t bestowed you with enough time. Against those monsters, you cannot be careless. Perhaps this is my final time being able to protect you. I came specifically this time not just due to concerns about you within that world, but also fearing you might encounter one of those formidable beings.”

When Long Chen heard this, his heart shook. Although the palace master was speaking rather vaguely, how could Long Chen not understand? He instantly saw through the crux of the matter.

The palace master had come this time not because he was worried about the nether dragon race leader or the other five Saints. It was entirely because of those new monsters.

For the palace master to be acting so carefully, it meant that if Long Chen were to encounter them, he wouldn’t be able to beat them.

Had others made such a claim, Long Chen would have dismissed it with laughter. That was because ever since the Phoenix Cry Empire, he had never encountered someone capable of surpassing him in the same realm.

This was Long Chen’s absolute confidence. No matter what kind of situation he was in, he was confident that he could get through it.

However, today, the palace master uttered a keyword that stirred worry within him. He mentioned that some of these monsters had undergone a nirvanic rebirth.

Long Chen had naturally heard of reincarnation, a phenomenon embedded in the laws of heaven and earth. However, there was an irrefutable law associated with it: the individual undergoing reincarnation would forfeit all memories of their previous life, initiating a fresh start.

For example, Yu Qingxuan. Long Chen had tested her memories countless times, but she only had memories of this lifetime. Furthermore, in her memories, he could only find a vague figure of himself and no other memories.

However, the palace master said that some people had gone through a nirvanic rebirth? Then they definitely weren’t like Yu Qingxuan. If a person could keep the memories of multiple lives, then they would have the experiences of numerous existences. Such a person would truly be a heaven-defying monster.

“Since I have the Pill Sovereign memories deep in my soul, does that mean I also went through a nirvanic rebirth? Do I have more potential to unlock?” Long Chen suddenly had a thought.

At this time, Long Chen recalled that when he was fighting the Saints and unleashing the full power of the Seven Star Battle Armor, some information had appeared in his mind.

“This is…!”

Long Chen became rapt with joy.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
