Chapter 4656 Yan Tianhua

BOOM!

As the void erupted, countless fragments of spacetime scattered in all directions. Among the chaos, they saw an enormous black python flying above them.

The presence of this python cast the whole world in darkness, painting even the tribulation clouds black.

“It’s the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race!”

“It’s enormous!”

“Its aura is a thousand times stronger than that of the other Black Rock Nine Underworld Pythons!”

Having fought the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race, the Dragonblood warriors were familiar with them. However, to their surprise, this python was a hundred times larger than its kin.

Lightning crackled as enormous tribulation clouds engulfed the world, locking onto this Black Rock Nine Underworld Python. Hence, wherever it went, the tribulation clouds would follow it.

“Heavens, what a terrifying heavenly tribulation! Perhaps only boss’s tribulation can compare to it!” The Dragonblood warriors jumped in shock upon seeing the huge tribulation clouds.

This tribulation seemed to be on an even greater scale than theirs, which meant that this person was a truly terrifying existence.

Long Chen and the others had just spotted it when it was already half past them. However, just as it was about to fly by, it suddenly paused.

“Eh?”

The Black Rock Nine Underworld Python turned to look at Long Chen.

After that, it opened its mouth and shot a black light at Long Chen, its powerful divine pressure enveloping the entire Dragonblood Legion. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Everyone, including Long Chen, felt their souls shudder. This attack triggered their sense of mortal danger.

“Heavenly Mirror!”

Before any of them could do anything, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox on Bai Xiaole’s shoulder had summoned a giant mirror.

Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox had used this move together during the tribulation. With it, they had managed to perfectly redirect the attack of the Sovereign clan expert, using his own power to kill him.

BOOM!

The Heavenly Mirror trembled as it redirected the black ray of light, causing it to veer off course. Caught off guard by the sudden attack, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was unable to adjust in time to control the direction of the attack.

The reflected black ray pierced through a distant mountain range consisting of incredibly tough blocks of stone, leaving a perfectly smooth hole in its wake. Remarkably, no dust was stirred up by the force of the attack, which shocked the onlookers.

“This bastard tried to kill us! It’s a good thing Little Nine reacted fast, otherwise...!” Xia Chen was enraged, but his face was pale. Perhaps they would have been killed just now if it hadn’t been for Little Nine.

The destructive will of the heavenly tribulation had covered up this python’s killing intent. With everyone’s attention on the tribulation, this person’s attack had arrived before they could react.

“Interesting. Remember my name. I am Yan Tianhua! Once I finish my tribulation, I’ll find you again.”

The Black Rock Nine Underworld Python flew away. He had merely paused for a moment to attack them and was now beyond their vision. However, his voice continued to echo here.

“Courting death!”

The Dragonblood warriors were enraged. This motherfucker called Yan Tianhua was too fast. It was as if some invisible force was pushing him onward, causing him to be unable to stop for long. Otherwise, he would have kept attacking.

“My heavenly tribulation!” screamed many cultivators around them.

Hearing the terrified screams, Long Chen and the others looked over. To their surprise, the people undergoing tribulations were just standing there in confusion, their tribulation clouds gone.

“What’s going on?!”

“Did he just absorb their tribulations?!” exclaimed Gu Yang.

“Was this fellow in such a rush because he’s stealing other people’s tribulations?”

“No wonder his tribulation was so terrifying! He has absorbed the tribulations of countless others already!”

Everyone was shocked. They had never heard of someone capable of absorbing other people’s heavenly tribulations.

At this moment, the experts who had yet to finish their tribulations were either weeping or cursing furiously. After all, their tribulations had disappeared, which counted as a failure to pass. In their minds, they thought they would never have the chance to enter the Divine Venerate realm anymore.

Although the Dragonblood warriors’ collective tribulation had disturbed other people’s tribulations, those people were still able to carefully continue their tribulations on the edges of the legion’s tribulation. It didn’t affect their advancement.

However, Yan Tianhua had directly taken their tribulations, along with their chance of becoming Divine Venerates. That was even more vicious than killing them right off the bat!

“Return my tribulation!”

Someone roared and shot off in Yan Tianhua’s direction. However, he was just too slow, and the thunderforce in him gradually turned cold. Once too much time passed, it would be meaningless even if he could catch up to Yan Tianhua.

“My heavenly tribulation, come back! If I can’t become a Heaven Venerate, my family will be doomed!” A young man was kneeling on the ground and weeping.

The cultivation world was just this cruel. No matter how great their talent was, no matter how strong they were, once their path was severed, they all turned to trash.

At that moment, let alone their enemies, even their friends would turn on them. In this cruel world, if someone didn’t have the power to protect themselves, everything they had would be taken away.

“No!”

Suddenly, that man raised his own hand and slammed it toward his own face to kill himself. Seeing this scene, Yu Qingxuan and the girls cried out.

Just as his hand was about to strike his head, Long Chen appeared in front of him and caught his hand.

“My family is surrounded by enemies. We’re barely hanging on, and I am my family’s only hope. If I can’t save them, I’d rather not see them die terribly while I’m powerless to do anything. Thank you for your kind intentions, but you can’t save me,” said that person. He stared at Long Chen lifelessly, having lost all hope.

“Idiot, the thunderforce in you hasn’t gone cold, which means you have around two hours. As long as you steer clear of that scoundrel’s path, you'll likely stumble upon others undergoing their own tribulations. I don’t feel like you’re a terrible person, so I’m just giving you this reminder. You should know what you need to do now!” advised Long Chen.

Hearing that, the suicidal guy suddenly felt enlightened. He then slammed his head in front of Long Chen a couple of times and then rushed off.

“Boss, your brain works fast!”

Guo Ran and the others stared at Long Chen. They had been like the others, thinking that these people were essentially crippled since that bastard had taken their tribulations.

However, Long Chen instantly thought of a solution for them. If they encountered someone undergoing a tribulation at a similar power level, they could undergo another tribulation together. Although their combined tribulation might be slightly more intense than before, it shouldn’t hinder their advancement.

“Find a place to consolidate your realms... the faster the better!” ordered Long Chen.

“Boss, what about you?” asked Guo Ran and the others.

“I’m going after that fellow. I feel like he’s brewing some scheme, so I want to see if I can reap some of that. If I can, that’ll be good. If I can’t, I’ll just smash his stupid head apart to vent.”

After saying that, Long Chen summoned his lightning wings and flew off like a shooting star.
