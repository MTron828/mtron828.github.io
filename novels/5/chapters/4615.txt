Chapter 4604 The Seventh Volume of the Nirvana Scripture

“Damn bastard!” Long Chen’s furious roar reverberated through the air. The white-robed man had detonated right in his hands, leaving Long Chen in a bad state, his left eye still bleeding.

“I was just a bit off!”

With a furious punch, he obliterated the last remaining expert of the Three Eye race. There was no longer any reason to keep him alive now that the white-robed man was no longer here.

“If it weren’t for the injury in my Purgatory Eyes, I would have been able to draw out his real body,” muttered Long Chen hatefully.

In his battle with Netherdragon Tianzhao, Long Chen had used the Purgatory Eyes to send the Emperor Blood Silk Net into the chaotic flow of space. This action had resulted in severe injuries to his Purgatory Eyes.

Although he had partially recovered in the white dragon ancestral scale’s space, the Purgatory Eyes were still in a state of healing.

Theoretically, he shouldn’t have used the Purgatory Eyes again until they were fully recovered. But in that situation, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered with that.

Regrettably, he couldn’t fully unleash the full power of the Purgatory Eyes in their state. So, in the end, he failed to drag out the true body of the white-robed man.

It was the first time Long Chen had been unable to retaliate against his enemy’s attack, and it fueled his anger. He might be able to tolerate other bastards, but suffering because of Lord Brahma’s disciple was simply intolerable.

“He had the audacity to dismiss the notion of karmic retribution as a foolish question? Just wait, I’ll show him the true meaning of karma, and who the real fool is,” Long Chen vowed with a deep breath, struggling to contain his anger.

“Your temper really is explosive,” remarked the Earth Cauldron, its tone tinged with amusement, as if teasing Long Chen.

Long Chen was startled, but then a realization dawned on him. “Senior, did you bring me here for him?”

“I can’t say. Can’t say,” replied the Earth Cauldron profoundly.

Long Chen’s anger vanished, replaced by a sense of clarity.

The Earth Cauldron didn’t say that it was leading him here for medicinal ingredients; its goal had to be beyond that. Then this white-robed man’s appearance was definitely not a coincidence.

However, if the Earth Cauldron refused to answer, Long Chen wouldn’t keep asking. He then took out the eyepatch that Bai Xiaole’s mother had given him and put it on his left eye. Once again, he became a one-eyed dragon.

Though it gave him a somewhat suspicious appearance, this eyepatch was specially made to heal injuries caused by pupil arts. As he fastened it in place, the searing pain subsided, replaced by a refreshing coolness.

Unlike medicinal pills, this eyepatch possessed a unique healing effect that surpassed conventional methods. Long Chen knew he could only wear it temporarily until his injuries fully mended.

“Senior, do you know about the Nirvana Scripture?” asked Long Chen.

“There is no one who doesn’t know of the number one flame element scripture within the nine heavens and ten lands,” remarked the Earth Cauldron.

“That fellow just now, was he chanting the seventh volume?” inquired Long Chen.

“Correct.” This time, the Earth Cauldron answered him very directly.

Long Chen nodded. He had only come into contact with the first six volumes of the Nirvana Scripture. Furthermore, when it came to the sixth volume, he basically hadn’t learned it.

That was because he only knew the scripture of the sixth volume and not the hand seals.

Although the High Firmament Academy’s collection included the first eight volumes of the Nirvana Scripture, they didn’t give the sixth to eighth volumes to just anyone to cultivate; even Long Chen was not an exception. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The sixth volume’s scripture was both challenging to pronounce and profoundly intricate, making it difficult to comprehend without a deep understanding of its meaning.

When it came to the Nirvana Scripture, every syllable had to be precise; otherwise, the flame energy drawn from the world would become unstable. Long Chen had tested using the sixth volume, only to be injured several times. He had come perilously close to killing himself in the process and had since refrained from further experimentation.

Although Long Chen had yet to master the sixth volume himself, he could still mimic its usage if someone else were to recite it.

However, the Nirvana Scripture recited by the white-robed man was unfamiliar to Long Chen. This indicated that it was not the sixth volume, and that was why Long Chen had asked about it.

“Senior, could the complete Nirvana Scripture be found here?” Long Chen suddenly jumped up.

“Why don’t you guess?”

This time, the Earth Cauldron didn’t reply directly.

“Hahaha!”

Long Chen raised his head and laughed. Although the Earth Cauldron didn’t reply, Long Chen already knew the answer.

Long Chen was filled with excitement. If he could obtain the complete Nirvana Scripture, then he would be able to control the world’s flame energy just like the white-robed man.

Long Chen’s previous outburst had been fueled not only by anger but also by jealousy. The fact that Lord Brahma’s disciple could wield a higher tier Nirvana Scripture than him was something he couldn’t stomach.

Thinking of how he could obtain the Nirvana Scripture here, Long Chen felt a new sense of determination. The white-robed man’s power allowed Long Chen to see the tip of the iceberg of the Nirvana Scripture.

“You should heal for now. Your use of Purgatory eyes also damaged that fellow’s Yuan Spirit. He’s clearly a petty person and will likely seek revenge with even greater urgency than you. You need to be cautious,” warned the Earth Cauldron.

“If we’re all injured, then if he finds me, we can have a fair fight. Even without the Nirvana Scripture, I still have the confidence to kill him,” said Long Chen confidently.

“You’re getting cocky. While you may have dragon blood strengthening you now, you don’t know how powerful the Nirvana Scripture is. If you were to encounter him now, you wouldn’t be able to properly unleash any of your power. Moreover, aside from him, do you realize how many medicine slaves he commands?” asked the Earth Cauldron.

“Oh...” Long Chen fell silent at the Earth Cauldron's question. While he held medicine slaves in contempt, he couldn't deny their terrifying capabilities.

Medicine slaves were madmen fully loyal to their masters, and they could carry out any order, no matter how extreme. Long Chen didn’t fear the white-robed man’s power even after the Earth Cauldron had cautioned him about it. However, facing a horde of medicine slaves after an exhausting battle? Such an encounter could prove fatal, even for him.

Medicine slaves? Wait... Long Chen suddenly thought of something and hastily checked the primal chaos space. He found that there weren’t that many new Heavenly Doyen Fruits.

He had just slain so many seven-star Doyens, but not a single seven-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit appeared on the tree. Long Chen quickly grasped the reason.

It seemed that medicine slaves were only quasi-Doyens created through medicinal pills. They were not truly recognized by the Heavenly Daos. Thus, when they died, the Heavenly Dao Tree didn’t generate new Heavenly Doyen Fruits.

“Fuck, here I thought you were supposed to be so amazing, but you can only make a bunch of fake Doyens. Hehehe, I can make real ones though,” sneered Long Chen.

He exited the primal chaos space and chose to listen to the Earth Cauldron’s advice, finding a place to heal. While his normal injury could be instantly healed with the primal chaos space’s life energy, the white-robed man’s assaults were infused with the power of the Nirvana Scripture, harnessing the forces of heaven and earth. Hence, the resulting injury transcended mere physical harm, as it involved the very laws and will of the world. Such a wound might last forever on someone else.

But on Long Chen, it only took six hours to fully heal. It went without saying that his constitution was truly terrifying.

After recovering, Long Chen didn’t waste any time and headed in the direction that the Earth Cauldron indicated, charging deeper into this area.
