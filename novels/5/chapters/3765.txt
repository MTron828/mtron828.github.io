Chapter 3754 The Powerful Li Chenggang

“That was spatial transportation, not a movement art.”

Long Chen was also shocked. Li Chenggang’s transportation art was even faster than Xia Chen’s talismans. There was also no warning at all.

The bamboo tile smacked the demonic beast Divine Venerate in the face out of nowhere. An explosive sound rang out. As a result, his face split open and blood sprayed out. This one attack almost blew his head apart.

Everyone’s jaws dropped. That was a Divine Venerate, and furthermore, it was a demonic beast. Just how powerful was his physical body? For his head to be almost destroyed, if it was a half-step Divine Venerate receiving this attack instead, wouldn’t he simply be killed in an instant?

Only then did people recall that the Heavenly River Nine Revolution Jade Bamboo was a treasure comparable to a World Domain divine item. This demonic beast had essentially been struck in the head by the attack of a World Domain divine item. It was understandable that he would be injured.

It was only after the bamboo tile smacked the demonic beast that Li Chenggang’s figure slowly appeared. Just like that, he stamped on the air and shot after the demonic beast like a bolt of lightning. Using the bamboo tile as a sword, he stabbed it toward the demonic beast’s head.

The demonic beast was still dazed from being struck in the head, so he had yet to fully recover when Li Chenggang’s second time came. As he didn’t dare to take it head-on, he rolled to the side.

However, a ray of divine light actually shot out of the bamboo tile just like Sword Qi. It left a bloody hole in his shoulder.

This Sword Qi then continued onward through his body and toward Seven Star City.

BOOM!

A Divine Venerate of the human race took action, shattering the Sword Qi. The immense power caused huge spatial ripples. Li Chenggang’s Sword Qi was truly immensely powerful.

Most shocking of all was that blood appeared on that human Divine Venerate’s palm. He was actually injured.

Although that person was not in his actual combat state, Li Chenggang’s attack was aimed at the demonic beast. It had already struck him and injured him before continuing onward a great distance. According to reason, most of its power should have been used up.

However, even then, this Sword Qi still injured that human Divine Venerate. Although it was a superficial wound, it still shocked countless people.

“Law power…”

Long Chen’s pupils shrank. He saw through the clues of that Sword Qi. Li Chenggang’s Sword Qi had not weakened due to the distance. This was an attack that didn’t keep up with common sense. Only an attack with the power of laws could do such a thing.

Regretfully, Long Chen recognized no more than ten second generation Jiuli immortal characters. As he didn’t recognize any of the ones on the bamboo tile, he couldn’t see through this attack.

Using his bamboo tile as a sword, Li Chenggang repeatedly slashed it, unleashing waves of Sword Qi that tore through the ground, forcing the demonic beast to repeatedly retreat. The latter howled furiously.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the demonic beast found an opportunity to recover. Scales covered his entire body, and he smashed apart Li Chenggang’s Sword Qi with a single punch.

Previously, he had been acting superior, viewing himself as far above Li Chenggang. Thus, he hadn’t entered his combat state. As a result, Li Chenggang’s continuous attacks had almost killed him.

Now he finally had a chance to summon his armor. Blood Qi erupted and a pair of wings spread on his back. He unleashed another punch.

This punch shook the heavens, suppressing the ten thousand Daos. The aura of a Divine Venerate was finally fully unleashed.

BOOM!

Li Chenggang swung his bamboo tile, and a huge explosion erupted. Li Chenggang was sent flying, and his bamboo tile bent.

“Die!”

After blasting him away, the demonic beast raised his head and roared. A giant illusory image manifested behind him. It appeared to be a serpent.

“Six Wing Soaring Serpent!”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Startled cries rang out as people recognized his identity. This demonic beast was actually a Six Wing Soaring Serpent.

When his manifestation appeared, his Blood Qi erupted like a volcano. An explosive power caused the world to change color. The next moment, astral winds shook the void, and ear-piercing soundwaves buffeted the world. It was as if the very world was about to explode because of him.

“This is the power of a Divine Venerate?! It’s absolutely terrifying!”

At this moment, he was an undefiable god. In front of him, a Divine Lord disciple was as insignificant as an ant.

Long Chen was also shaken. The power of a Divine Venerate was even greater than he had imagined. Just this explosive pressure was enough to flatten others.

After unleashing all his power, the demonic beast’s wings flapped, and he pounced on Li Chenggang. He was clearly enraged. He no longer wanted to test Li Chenggang’s skills. Now, he only wanted to kill!

Long Chen was already circulating his aura secretly and clenching the Minghong Saber. If Li Chenggang really was in danger, he would definitely save him. After all, Li Chenggang had saved Jiang Lei. Long Chen owed him a favor.

Li Chenggang snorted. Against this fully powered Divine Venerate, he suddenly tossed aside his bamboo tile and slammed his hands together. His scroll then scattered into individual tiles. Ninety-nine bamboo tiles lit up at the same time, and the characters on them shone brightly. They formed a shield in front of him.

That demonic beast’s fist smashed into the shield. Runes exploded, and the world shook. Runic fragments flew through the air. 

“He… he blocked it!”

People stared in shock at Li Chenggang with their jaws dropped. They were filled with disbelief. Li Chenggang had actually blocked a full-power attack from a Divine Venerate.

The shield fell apart. After that, the ninety-nine bamboo tiles fell to the ground, surrounding Li Chenggang. They formed a bamboo fence.

At this moment, the bamboo tiles became blank. All the characters carved on them vanished. However, the shattered characters in the air flew back, and those characters reappeared.

“You also receive one of my attacks!”

Li Chenggang shouted. Forming hand seals, the ninety-nine bamboo tiles quivered. They formed a giant arrow that shot toward the demonic beast.

When the characters on the bamboo tiles began to burn, a shocking aura filled the air. Heaven and earth lost all sound.

Upon seeing this attack, that demonic beast’s expression completely changed. He then roared and raised his arms in front of him. His wings also folded around his body tightly.

BOOM!

Divine light exploded along with his wings. He then coughed up blood and flew back. A charred scent hung in the air.

After that, the flying bamboo tiles once more gathered into the shape of a scroll. They rolled up and came to a rest on Li Chenggang’s back.

Li Chenggang’s face was slightly pale now. He bowed to Long Chen. “Dean Long Chen, let us meet again.”

“You want to leave now?! Die!”

Just then, the demonic beast Divine Venerate came flying back furiously. A mouth that could devour the very heavens snapped down upon Li Chenggang.
