Chapter 2884 One Star Top Grade Pills

“Dragon Heart Grass, Ape Scarlet Flower, Blazing Fire Chrysanthemum…”

Long Chen refined one precious medicinal ingredient after another into medicinal powder. These were ones that he had just bought. He had already planted them in the primal chaos space and obtained many new harvests of them.

More and more of the pill furnace’s runes lit up. Although the Moon and Star Refining Furnace’s item-spirit was unable to communicate that well with Long Chen, it still had its tremendous alchemy experience.

Furthermore, in the mortal world, it had worked together with Long Chen and Huo Long to refine pills constantly, so everyone was extremely familiar with each other’s spiritual fluctuations. Their movements were easy and effortless.

A furnace of pills quickly reached the final phase of refining, and it took less than half an incense stick’s worth of time. Long Chen was delighted.

Huo Long had completely devoured the power of the Heavenly Flame seed, gaining the power of the Scarlet Spirit Flame. Because the Scarlet Spirit Flame was still sprouting and hadn’t awakened its consciousness, it was very easy for Huo Long to devour it.

Furthermore, Huo Long was absorbing the energy of the companion ore every day to increase its power. It already possessed its own consciousness, so it knew to take the initiative with absorbing that energy instead of passively absorbing it.

Huo Long’s power was growing with each passing day. Its growth rate was astonishing.

For it to now refine pills with Long Chen, everything was easy. The medicinal powders no longer had so many impurities. Furthermore, the cooperation with the Moon and Star Refining Furnace was easy and familiar.

Rumbling sounds began to ring out within the pill furnace as the pills smashed around inside. Long Chen’s smile grew.

The greater the movements, the greater the quality of these pills. The pill furnace quickly returned to calm as the refinement was finished. After that, Long Chen opened the lid, and a current of warmth blew out.

Nine pills lay inside the furnace like balls of colored glass, and light flowed out of the furnace, turning the room into a wonderland.

“The immortal world’s medicinal pills are graded just like the mortal world. Low grade, middle grade, high grade, top grade, and peerless grade. However, here, top grade pills will be affected by the Heavenly Daos and branded by their mark, their blessing. If the blessing takes the form of a star, they are called pill stars. The Elders of the Pill Institute are given titles based on the pill stars that they can form, for example, the Seven Star Elder can refine a top grade pill with seven stars. As for me, I’m still unable to refine even a single star. I’m still very lacking,” Long Chen muttered to himself as he examined the pills that he had refined.

Long Chen then consumed one of these pills. It was a Mortal Ascension Pill. After a while, he felt like a volcano was exploding in his body, and the immense power surged throughout him, flowing so fast that it rumbled.

Long Chen took off his clothes. He found that beads of sweat had appeared all over him, and these small beads of sweat all had a disgusting stench.

“My mortal qi is being forced out so quickly. These top grade Mortal Ascension Pills are a thousand times more effective than the pills I refined before! Hehe, like this, I’ll be able to fully expel my mortal qi within a month and condense a divine flame seed. Chu Kuang? I know your foundation. In a month, let’s see just whose trump cards are stronger. I’ll also get a look at how deep the foundation of a family with tens of thousands of years of history is.” Long Chen clenched his fist.

“Continue!”

With his experience of the first refinement, the next refinement went even easier. After ten refinements, Long Chen could clearly feel that the power of the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had increased slightly.

Refining pills was the fastest way for a pill furnace’s item-spirit to grow. The more pills that were refined, the higher their quality and the more effective the pill furnace became.

Within a single incense stick’s worth of time, Long Chen could refine eight furnaces of pills. Once he had refined over sixty furnaces of pills, his Spiritual Strength began to run out, so he quickly refined a furnace of soul nourishing pills.

An hour later, his Spiritual Strength was fully recovered, and he continued refining. With the next furnace of pills, he was shocked to find a star image appearing on the pills.

“A one star top grade pill!”

Long Chen was delighted. He hadn’t gotten stronger, nor had Huo Long. But he had still refined a one star top grade pill. That could only mean that the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had gotten stronger.

“Based on the Pill Institute’s reward system, disciples get a ten million immortal crystal reward for refining a one star top grade pill, and they will have their name recorded in the list of geniuses.”

Long Chen hesitated but shook his head. Ten million immortal crystals was an unimaginable amount to him right now, but he didn’t urgently need money at this exact moment. He already had everything he needed to refine good pills for himself, and he didn’t want to become a fat pig to be slaughtered. Quietly growing and accumulating riches in silence was better.

Long Chen gave up the thought of that reward and calmly refined pills. He then spent a whole day refining over three thousand pills. Amongst them were over thirty that had reached the one star top grade level.

Such a crazy refinement severely taxed his mental energy. As he had a splitting headache, he quickly fell asleep.

After sleeping for half a day, Long Chen once more refined two furnaces of pills. Then he had the Moon and Star Refining Furnace and Huo Long try refining pills by themselves in the primal chaos space.

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace had accumulated a certain amount of power after so many refinements. However, this way, they needed to stop and rest after every two furnaces of pills. Furthermore, the better refinements resulted in top grade pills, but the worse ones resulted in high grade pills. There were no more one star top grade pills like when Long Chen refined with them.

However, Long Chen didn’t mind. If the Moon and Star Refining Furnace could refine pills on its own, then that could be considered its own kind of cultivation. In any case, the primal chaos space was filled with countless precious medicinal ingredients. It could refine as many as it wanted, and Long Chen could focus on what else he needed to do.

Long Chen started devouring Mortal Ascension Pills to the point that his body was almost unable to bear the amount of power. Only then did he stop. If someone else devoured as many pills as him, their body would instantly explode. But Long Chen only needed a break of a few hours before continuing.

While he rested, he ran over to the Divine Scripture Pavilion. This time, he took a look at their divine abilities and Battle Skills.

As he expected, there was a veritable sea of cultivation techniques and other abilities for the divine cultivation path. They were endless.

Long Chen was searching for a technique that looked similar to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. It would be best if the manifestation that appeared when he went all-out was similar. That way, it could cover up that he was a nine star heir, and he wouldn’t need to hold himself back when fighting.

“This is too much. I can only go bookshelf by bookshelf.” Long Chen had no way to look through them one book at a time. He could only do as he did before and look through the entire shelves. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Instructor Long Chen, that’s not a good idea. Learning so many cultivation techniques and secret arts will damage your Dao foundation and Yuan Spirit,” said a disciple who was perusing the shelves as well. All these disciples recognized him. Hearing that he wanted to attempt such a thing, this disciple turned pale and hastily tried to stop him.

“Instructor Long Chen, many of these techniques have contradictory natures. Absorbing them at the same time will result in fiercer clashing and can easily result in a heart-devil,” said another disciple.

“There’s such a thing?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, it’s absolutely true.” That disciple nodded.

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. “It seems that you two have come here quite a bit. Do you know if there’s a kind of cultivation technique that causes a large ring of light to appear when used? One that looks very flashy?”

“Yes!”

Both those disciples nodded in unison.
