Chapter 4514 Setting Up a Trap

“Seal!” Long Chen shouted. Violet qi then swirled around him and slowly condensed into a rune on his forehead.

“Success! Many thanks, senior!”

Long Chen was excited to have mastered a sealing technique from the Earth Cauldron. This time, it was really simple.

“This is a seal of the Pill Dao, not a bloodline seal, so it cannot stay in effect for long. You will need to redo the seal every three days. Furthermore, you cannot use the slightest bit of your bloodline power, or the seal will immediately shatter,” warned the Earth Cauldron.

Since Long Chen asked, the Earth Cauldron transmitted him this technique. However, this technique was primarily designed for sealing medicinal pills. While it also had an effect on sealing bloodlines, it just wasn’t as effective. It could not compare to how Xia Chen had made a talisman for himself to seal his Doyen aura.

However, this was enough for Long Chen. As long as he could seal his violet blood, Ying Tian shouldn’t be able to sense his aura. Then they would be on the same starting line for their fight.

After dealing with this, Long Chen consumed a few medicinal pills to completely conceal his aura. Now, even his spiritual fluctuations were stagnant.

Due to this, his reaction speed was dozens of times slower than normal. That was a dangerous state to be in. However, Long Chen was prepared.

Suddenly, a powerful roar shook the land, and Long Chen carefully crept forward. After finding a hidden place, he consumed another medicinal pill.

In an instant, he entered a state of slumber, and in his dream, he heard a roar that sounded like a tsunami. He felt the land shaking.

Long Chen was in a semi-unconscious state now. In this state, he was unable to pose any threat to anyone. Thus, even an assassin with the sharpest of senses couldn’t sense him.

Not far from him, a black ape was fighting a violent bear. The impact of their powerful clashes reverberated through the surroundings, shaking the world and sending debris flying, puncturing many mountains. A thick cloud of dust rose into the sky.

As long as Ying Tian was nearby, the noises here would draw his attention. In essence, Long Chen had intentionally placed himself in a precarious situation, risking his life to attract Ying Tian. In order to trick Ying Tian’s senses, he had to be in this state.

The black ape roared crazily, and the bear also shouted. Their voices shook the heavens.

In his semi-unconscious state, Long Chen patiently waited. Eventually, he sensed the slightest ripple, and his clouded mind started to focus.

As his senses sharpened, he swiftly discerned a shadowy figure lying prone atop a cliff.

That was the optimal spot to watch the ape and bear fight. Long Chen’s calculations were on target; when Ying Tian arrived, he indeed chose to watch from there.

A subtle smile crept across Long Chen’s face as he lay concealed in the grass. Peering through his cover, he maintained a clear view of the entire cliff. This was the only way to prevent himself from being sensed.

BOOM!

Finally, the bear’s superior strength prevailed, toppling the ape to the ground. Injured and triggered into a berserk state, the black ape retaliated ferociously, tearing at the bear with unrestrained fury

The bear was quickly injured and entered a berserk state as well. Two Saint-level devil beasts locked in a fierce, life-and-death struggle, unleashing chaos with blood and flesh scattering in every direction.

Atop the cliff, the translucent figure remained motionless, and Long Chen also didn’t dare to move. He simply observed the brutal confrontation unfolding below.

BOOM!

Finally, the black ape was unable to hold on anymore and was brought to the ground. Its chest tore open, and its insides spilled out. The berserk state came to an abrupt halt, leaving the black ape gasping for its last breaths.

The victorious bear, driven into a bloody frenzy, roared triumphantly and ruthlessly tore at the black ape’s throat, disregarding its final struggles.

As this horrifying scene unfolded, the translucent figure vanished. Seizing this opportune moment, Long Chen also disappeared, leaving no trace behind.

A slender and long sword stabbed the back of the bear’s head with precision. This attack was fast, accurate, and ruthless. Following the precise strike, a beam of Sword Qi shot forth, piercing through the bear’s head.

It was a perfect execution, so precise that it sparked disbelief. The translucent figure easily took the bear’s life, and it simply stiffened and fell to the ground.

Retrieving his sword from the bear’s head, the translucent figure then walked toward the black ape.

The black ape was already on death’s door, but it still roared unwillingly with its final dregs of power.

The translucent figure’s sword slowly rose, aiming at the ape’s head. Even if left alive, this ape wouldn’t live for long, as it was virtually incapacitated.

BOOM!

Just as the sword was about to pierce the ape’s head, two rays of divine light shot out of its mouth. Berserk lightning and flames instantly enveloped the translucent figure.

“What?!”

This sudden change left the figure in shock. Millions of lightning and flame runes stuck to him like glue.

Following that, he felt a gust of wind behind him, and a hand covered in tiny stars smashed into his back.

BOOM!

The starry hand directly pierced his back. Long Chen’s attack was unstoppable.

However, just as Long Chen prepared to deliver a devastating blow, eight figures materialized in front of him. Each of these figures bore a bloody hole in their chest.

Long Chen’s expression changed as he realized that his killing blow had been jointly endured by these eight clones. By dividing the impact among them, Long Chen’s attack was no longer fatal.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!” Long Chen roared with his palm still in Ying Tian’s chest.

BOOM!

The figure bound by Lei Linger and Huo Linger exploded into a mass of flesh and blood, and the other eight figures coughed out blood. Forming hand seals, they absorbed the blood mist in the sky.

“Long Chen! Count yourself vicious this time! I, Ying Tian, will remember you!” These eight figures shouted furiously, the absolute calm in Ying Tian’s voice now replaced with anger.

“Remember me? It’s too early to say that!”

A lightning sphere and flame lotus merged, swiftly engulfing the world, including those eight figures and Long Chen. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

BOOM!

A powerful explosion reverberated, shaking the world. The void collapsed, and countless Grand Dao runes scattered. Lightning and flames voraciously devoured the heavens and the earth.
