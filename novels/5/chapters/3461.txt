Chapter 3450 The Real Start

Just as Long Chen predicted, a sinister qi enveloped the land. At this moment, dried-up corpses in strange clothes began to come out of the tribulation clouds.

Those ancient corpses made Bai Xiaole cry out in shock. He instantly recognized them as the corpses he had encountered on the Ghost Ship.

Bai Zhantang and the others’ hearts shook. Those corpses had the aura of the Ghost Dao on them. It was the specific aura of lifeforms of the Ghost Dao. Unexpectedly, they had been manifested by the heavenly tribulation.

When those ancient corpses appeared, all the disciples undergoing tribulation felt a chill. That aura provoked the most primitive sense of fear within them.

Just as they descended, the lightning dragons that were swimming in the surroundings grouped together, forming a giant yurt around everyone. There was only a single opening at the top. This way, those ancient corpses would have to come through that opening.

At this time, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, Xu Zixiong, and the others charged to the top, attacking them.

Bai Shishi’s face was slightly pale. She had an innate fear of the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms. That was directly related to Bai Zhantang.

But she knew that she had to conquer this fear. Otherwise, if the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms appeared in any battles in the future, she would be seriously affected by this fear.

Seeing Bai Shishi charge up, Bai Xiaole felt that it would be too embarrassing for him to retreat. Afraid of being laughed at by others, he charged up as well.

These Ghost Dao lifeforms manifested by the Heavenly Daos actually weren’t that strong. Bai Shishi’s sword swung through the air, and those ancient corpses were cut down in droves.

Seeing Bai Shishi slaughter them so easily, Bai Xiaole’s guts also grew. He attacked those lightning ancient corpses together with everyone else.

“If you feel that you are capable, you can try it. If you feel that you can’t, then just wait at the rear and it’s fine,” said Long Chen.

Those frightened disciples instantly grew tumultuous. Seeing that Bai Shishi had charged out, it felt like they would be admitting that they couldn’t do anything if they didn’t join in.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It was as if they were about to take a swig of alcohol and someone said that they could avoid drinking it if they couldn’t. The challenge fully provoked them.

“Kill!”

Clenching their teeth, those disciples suppressed their fear and charged forward. They were ferocious, and just relying on this provocation, they completely stopped that army of ancient corpses.

“The power of these ancient corpses should be around the early Immortal King realm and is technically stronger than they are. They’ve already started overdrafting their power but are still able to endure. Long Chen is right. They really will completely transform after this tribulation,” said Bai Shishi’s mother. She saw that these disciples were all panting and covered in sweat but still roaring furiously and charging forward. “This is Long Chen’s charisma. With him present, others can forget their fear. Perhaps they have no confidence in themselves, but their confidence in Long Chen has never wavered.”

These disciples were unafraid of death. They had a new conviction, and that was that they would rather be beaten to death than be scared away.

It was this conviction that let them enter a state of forgetting even themselves. They only knew to fight all-out and forgot everything else.

However, going all-out like this, some disciples suddenly fainted in less than an incense stick’s worth of time. They had used up everything they had. There was no longer any trace of energy in their bodies.

Once they collapsed, lightning chains grabbed them and dragged them to the rear. But they were left just suspended in the air.

“No way! Even after they fainted, he won’t let them off?”

Heaven Master Yun Yang noticed that even as those fainted people were bound by the lightning chains, more lightning runes continued to merge into their bodies, forcibly tempering their bodies.

More and more disciples collapsed. But seeing that, the other disciples only grew more excited. For them to be able to endure while others couldn’t meant that they were at least a bit stronger.

However, it wasn’t long before only just over a thousand people were left fighting from the original eleven thousand. This proved that their potential was greater than others.

Luo Changwu watched excitedly. He saw that many of the Luo family’s disciples had violet marks appear in their eyes right before they collapsed. That was a sign of their bloodline awakening.

It had to be known that in all these years, every generation in the Luo family would only have a few dozen talented disciples capable of activating their bloodline power.

Now, so many people were starting to awaken their bloodline. Luo Changwu even had the urge to cry. Luo Zichuan had left the Luo family to him and Luo Changwen, so both of them felt a heavy pressure.

However, with Long Chen’s help, the Luo family was growing stronger day by day. They were growing more and more glorious, entering an unprecedented era. They all wished that Luo Zichuan could see their current state.

After another incense stick’s worth of time, only over ten experts remained. Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, Xu Zixiong, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and a few others were still capable of enduring. The rest had collapsed.

At this time, the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms had reached the mid Immortal King realm. Although Bai Shishi’s sword was as sharp as lightning, she was unable to stop all of them. Thus, everyone else was under a great deal of pressure.

In just a few breaths’ time, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, and the others exhausted all their remaining energy and fainted.

Now it was only Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Xu Zixiong, Qin Feng, and Qi Yu still enduring. Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils revolved in his eyes. But he actually looked at Xu Zixiong and shouted, “Big brother Zixiong, don’t fight any longer. I can see that you’ve reached your limit.”

Long Chen was speechless. It seemed that Bai Xiaole didn’t want to give up before Xu Zixiong. Amongst the five of them, Xu Zixiong was the weakest. If he gave up first, it would be admitting that he was inferior to Xu Zixiong. This child was actually trying to make him give up.

Xu Zixiong clenched his teeth. He was soaked in sweat and panting as he swung his rod. “I’m fine. I can endure.”

“But I can’t endure much longer…” Bai Xiaole was so anxious that he actually said exactly what he was thinking. After realizing it, he hastily shut his mouth.

As for Bai Shishi, she was continuing to cut down those Ghost Dao lifeforms. Her fear of the Ghost Dao was growing dull bit by bit. Even now, she wasn’t out of breath.

Qin Feng and Qi Yu were also still in top condition. Furthermore, due to their combat experience, they were well-suited to group battles. Their auras were not showing any signs of weakening.

Thus, it was Bai Xiaole who was the most bitter now. He had a splitting headache. That was the result of overdrafting his Spiritual Strength. He had used his pupil arts liberally in order to show off his power and had killed countless tribulation manifestations. Although it was very flashy and drew attention, it cost a great deal of energy. He could not hold on much longer.

However, the only thing keeping him going was that he didn’t want to fall before Xu Zixiong. So, he clenched his teeth and endured, trying to save as much of his Spiritual Strength as possible to outlast Xu Zixiong.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, Bai Xiaole finally couldn’t last anymore. His eyes rolled into the back of his head and he fainted.

Just after he fainted, Xu Zixiong coughed up a mouthful of blood. He was injured by one of those ancient corpses and fainted as well. There was no more than the blink of an eye between the two of them falling.

“Now it’s just the three of you. Now, we can really get started!”

Long Chen flicked his finger. A flash of fire soared into the sky and exploded amongst the tribulation clouds.

The calm tribulation clouds instantly went crazy. It was like a wild beast had been awoken. A murderous aura filled the air.
