Chapter 2618 Hostility Mounts

In the face of this forceful woman from the sea demon race, Long Chen’s originally indifferent expression grew cold. “Your thing? You’re a barbarian blood black dragon, while this reverse scale came from a true dragon. How is it yours? Even if you stood over it for tens of thousands of years, why would that matter? This remnant of the true dragon is a gift from the true dragon to the Martial Heaven Continent. How can a dragon from an outer region be qualified to touch it? Every lifeform on the Martial Heaven Continent can say that the azure dragon reverse scale belongs to them. Only you cannot.”

Long Chen had originally been planning on ignoring her, but she had gone too far. Although he had made an agreement with the divine families to ignore the sea demon race, if the sea demon race were to take the initiative to provoke him, he naturally wouldn’t care about that agreement.

Only once Long Chen said this did everyone learn that Long Chen’s Dragon Blood Battle Armor came from a true dragon’s reverse scale.

“A true dragon’s scale is something that maintains the karmic luck of a dragon vein. Doesn’t that mean that as the heir of a true dragon, Long Chen is the future son of the heavens?”

The dragon vein had chosen him. As long as he had said this, it would have elevated him to almost the same status as a Sovereign. But Long Chen had never mentioned it before. If this woman hadn’t appeared, they would still not know the origin of his dragon blood.

“Long Chen really is low-key. Or perhaps he just feels that it isn’t worth it to explain some things.”

“That’s true. At his level, he has come into contact with the secrets of the Heavenly Daos that we cannot imagine. When it comes to the matter of the original devil race, if Long Chen had to explain himself to everyone with questions, it would be a few centuries before he was done explaining. Those who trust him won’t doubt him, and he has no need to explain himself to those that don’t trust him.”

“As the leader of the Martial Heaven Continent’s army, he needs to possess a corresponding charisma and resolution. When preparing for battle, who goes around asking for everyone’s opinions and then slowly explaining things to every person with questions? How can someone fight like that? Although I also don’t understand the matter with the original devil race, I trust Long Chen. So many people chose to entrust their lives to him, so I trust that they are correct.”

“Tell the people questioning him to scram. They are only going to cause chaos when the battle starts. All they can do is shout from the back. Aren’t they relying entirely on senior apprentice-brother Long Chen’s mercy to save their lives?”

As people discussed this sudden information, the doubters were forced to shut their mouths. The blood flowing through Long Chen’s veins belonged to a true dragon, and the true dragon’s reverse scale represented the karmic luck of the Martial Heaven Continent. If the Martial Heaven Continent had chosen him, how could they question him?

The sea demon experts’ expressions twisted as they heard the discussion. But at this moment, the man from the Six Horn Sea Serpent race stepped forward and bowed to the woman first. “Dragon emperor, this person killed my little brother. Please permit me to fight and take revenge for my brother.”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent that Long Cheon had killed was this person’s little brother. No wonder they looked so similar and had similar auras.

“If you dare to attack, I will kill you with a wave of my hand. If you don’t believe it, you can come try it,” sneered Long Chen. Just standing there as the wind blew back his black robes and hair, he possessed an unspeakable domineering air.

Hearing this provocation, the man from the Six Horn Sea Serpent race stepped forward. His aura erupted, revealing that he was an expert almost on the level of a Sovereign sprout. But Long Chen was confident that he could kill this man.

The Dragonblood warriors’ blood heated up. This was their boss. He was as domineering as ever.

At the same time, the High Priest simply watched with a faint smile. He had no intention of stopping anything as if he had only come to watch a show. It was the same for Daoist Heavenly Feather and the Music Master. It was as if they were just guests.

After that, a golden trident appeared in the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s hand. It was identical to the weapon that Long Chen had destroyed before.

The other two experts behind the dragon woman also took out their weapons. They were also golden tridents.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes, and his killing intent began to rise. Today was the day that the original devil race was coming back to the Martial Heaven Continent. It just so happened that he needed to show his power and shake people so that they wouldn’t be rude to the original devil race.

It seemed that he had stunned people enough, but the sea demon race had sent a few moths to annoy him. Since this was the case, he wouldn’t mind killing them all, even if it started a war with the sea demon race.

“If you want to fight, we’ll accompany you!” Guo Ran finally couldn’t endure it any longer and stepped forward. His armor appeared around him, and he smacked his sabers together, unleashing an explosive sound.

“Let’s fight!” The Dragonblood warriors also roared, their killing intent exploded. A bloody scent filled the air.

In that instant, the experts around them jumped in shock at the Dragonblood warriors’ bloody scent. Every one of them was a warrior that had killed their way out of a mountain of corpses and seas of blood. Ever since following Long Chen, they had lost count of how many lifeforms they had killed. Hence, the killing intent from just one of them was enough to scare others, let alone when they all unleashed their killing intent at the same time. Their killing intent was enough to make others quiver.

Those who could come here were all rather powerful cultivators. If weaker ones had come, they would have directly pissed themselves.

At this moment, the dragon woman’s expression changed. Even she was stunned by the Dragonblood Legion. Having finally come out of her seal under the Martial Heaven Continent, she had managed to merge with the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent, which made her qualify to get the azure dragon reverse scale. However, when she came out, she found that it had been taken.

In her fury, she had immediately run over to find Long Chen, thinking that she and her three dragon guards would be an immense force. Actually, she had had four dragon guards, but one had been killed by Long Chen. Hence, whether it was the matter of the dragon guard or the dragon scale, she needed an explanation from Long Chen.

However, before even Long Chen himself fought, the power of the Dragonblood Legion already shook her. Although Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Liu Ruyan, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, and the others had yet to unleash their auras, she could sense a frightening feeling from them. In this situation, if a battle started, she didn’t know whether or not she would be able to protect her three dragon guards.

If they were all killed, she would be left with just herself, so her expression sank. But it was difficult to stop now that things had reached this point.

“Long Chen, you stole my dragon scale and killed my dragon guard. You must give me an explanation for these things!” shouted the dragon woman.

“First, the dragon scale wasn’t yours. Its master gave it to me. Don’t ask me for proof, because then I’ll ask for proof from you, and I don’t like wasting time on such senseless games. Second, your dragon guard chose to be enemies with me multiple times, killing quite a few disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance. I only regret not killing him sooner. You want an explanation? Then every warrior who sacrificed himself because of that idiot also demands an explanation from you. Third, today is an auspicious day. I don’t want to see blood, so don’t force me. Go back to wherever you came from. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being vicious,” responded Long Chen icily.

Today was the day that the original devil race returned to the Martial Heaven Continent, so even the likes of the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the Music Master had come. One reason was to intimidate those who harbored bad intentions, but another reason was a kind of apology. That was because they were some of the few people on the Martial Heaven Continent who knew of the secret behind the original devil race.

The original devil race had been hunted down by the continent’s experts, and now they needed to help the continent’s experts against their enemies. Although this camaraderie was thanks to Long Chen, they also needed to personally come to express their gratitude and regret to the original devil race.

However, the sea demon race had come along with a dragon woman of an unclear background to this important occasion. Having not expected such a thing, the High Priest and the others also didn’t interfere. They left it entirely to Long Chen.

“You wish to start a war with the sea demon race?” demanded the dragon woman. Her dragon qi began to circulate, and her aura slowly rose. A dragon roar came from within her.

“If your sea demon race wants a war, the Martial Heaven Continent will accompany you!” Long Chen was also infuriated. The sea demon race really refused to give him any face. If you gave an inch, they took a yard.

When the divine families had told him to ignore the sea demon race, he had agreed, allowing them to spread nonsensical rumors to give face to the sea demon race and allowing that matter to pass.

However, perhaps it was because of the appearance of this dragon woman, but the sea demon race instantly became arrogant once more, starting to threaten him.

“Everyone, all this anger isn’t good for you. Why not resolve this matter peacefully?”

Suddenly, a golden war chariot appeared in the sky, and four figures appeared. It was the divine families’ four Sovereign sprouts. The speaker was Long Aotian.
