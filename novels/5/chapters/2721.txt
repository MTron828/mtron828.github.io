Chapter 2710 The Strange Heaven Merging Pill

“This Heaven Merging Pill of mine is different from other Heaven Merging Pills. It has merged with my world energy. If others consume it, they will be rejected by that world energy, resulting in their astral space shattering. In the worst case, they’ll die,” explained Long Chen.

It was the same pill formula but a different refining method. Long Chen’s Heaven Merging Pill had his mark in it, so only he could consume it.

Its effect was strong enough that even the pill dregs could kill someone. If someone was eating the complete pill, its medicinal energy would cause their astral space to instantly explode, killing them without a doubt.

Long Chen also hadn’t expected this. When the pill condensed, all his 108,000 astral spaces sent energy into the pill furnace. Due to too many unexpected factors appearing, the refinement ended up in failure.

Other people couldn’t possibly contain the power of his astral spaces. Every single one of his astral spaces was both its own unique entity yet also connected to the others.

If it was possible to inject the power of one’s astral space into another person’s, the imbalance of power could easily cause death for them. But each person’s astral space was their own world, one that only their divine sense could enter, so other people couldn’t possibly attack them there.

However, if you were to take the initiative to draw someone else’s astral energy into your body, then that would be no different than suicide.

“What are you talking about? Tell us, what is this thing?” demanded Tang Wan-er impatiently.

“Hehe, these pill dregs can be diluted into medicinal water. You’ve all absorbed the ten thousand dragon essence blood, so you understand,” hinted Long Chen.

“No, I don’t.” Meng Qi and the others were still befuddled.

Long Chen explained, “Once the medicinal dregs are diluted, they won’t be so violent. You’ll be able to handle absorbing their power. Although it’s a failure, it still has the power of the Heaven Merging realm. You can still absorb it just like consuming a pill. Furthermore, it has my world energy inside it. My guess is that after someone absorbs it, their astral world will also change. But the details will require a test subject. Guo Ran, I believe that you volunteered? Come over here.”

Guo Ran instantly turned green, but Long Chen didn’t give him a chance to escape. When Long Chen found a small lake, he tossed the medicinal dregs inside, and the lake immediately began to boil. Countless bubbles surged out, and many of those bubbles even contained Heavenly Dao runes that exploded.

“Boss, I feel like… aiya!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Guo Ran didn’t even get to finish speaking before Long Chen tossed him in. Water splashed, and Guo Ran vanished beneath the water.

However, after falling in, nothing else happened, and there were no signs of him trying to swim up. When they looked, they saw that he had sunk to the bottom of the lake and was gesturing at them, seemingly asking for help. At first, they thought that he was just joking, until his face turned purple.

A dozen Dragonblood warriors also entered, only to plummet like stones in the water.

“What’s going on?”

After Long Chen waved his hand, Guo Ran and the others came flying out of the water. Guo Ran coughed hard, like a drowning person who had reached the shore.

“Boss, what was that? As soon as we enter the water, our cultivation base is sealed. We were no different than ordinary non-cultivators,” said a Dragonblood warrior. The other Dragonblood warriors that had entered the water nodded. As soon as they entered the water, their cultivation techniques, their Battle Skills, their status as Empyreans, and their Heavenly Dao energy were all stripped away. They felt like they were about to drown.

“That doesn’t sound right. What about the power of your dragon blood?” asked Long Chen.

“It was impossible to sense any of it. It was all stripped away,” answered that Dragonblood warrior.

Long Chen suddenly grabbed Bao Buping and tossed him into the lake. Bao Buping cursed, “Long Chen, you rogue!”

Bao Buping immediately jumped out as soon as he fell in. He was soaked and was about to continue cursing when he said, “Hm? I feel fine.”

Guo Ran and the others were dumbfounded. Why was Bao Buping completely fine?

“No, my astral space…!” Bao Buping suddenly noticed a slight change in his astral space. He wasn’t sure what the change was though.

“My astral space has gotten bigger!” suddenly exclaimed a Dragonblood warrior.

“Mine’s also bigger!” said another Dragonblood warrior.

The others who had jumped in also noticed this slight change. An astral space was the core of a cultivator. Upon reaching the Life Star realm, its foundation was formed, and unless you encountered some kind of heaven-defying opportunity, it was difficult to increase its size past a certain extent.

However, just that brief soak in the lake had allowed their astral spaces to grow. That was absolutely shocking.

“Boss, what’s going on?” asked Guo Ran.

Long Chen was silent for a moment. “This Heaven Merging Pill of mine is very odd. It has most likely absorbed too many energies during the refinement. Even I’m not clear on it. You were suppressed by the water because it has Heavenly Dao energy in it, as well as my world energy and true dragon energy. On the other hand, Bao Buping doesn’t train in the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art, so he isn’t as suppressed as you guys. Other than the Heavenly Dao suppression, he can still use his cultivation technique and such. Either way, my world energy can cause your astral spaces to grow. The water now has the power of Heaven Merging, so you can absorb it to increase your cultivation bases and grow your astral spaces. Although this refinement counts as a failure in the end, it’s extremely beneficial to us.”

Everyone was delighted to hear this, and quite a few of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples were impatient to start.

However, just as they were talking, the bubbles in the water faded. It returned to calm.

“The medicinal energy has run out. A trash pill was only able to maintain the effects for a very short time. But I’ll be refining more. I’ll trouble the alliance head to find some more suitable places for all the disciples to cultivate,” said Long Chen.

Only then did Qu Jianying recover from her shock. She had heard of the Heaven Merging Pill, but those stories never mentioned such a heaven-defying effect. Since this was the case, she no longer wanted to blame Long Chen and quickly made some arrangements.

After all, they had to find some baths for people to train. They had to separate the men and women, and it would be best if the different powers had separate places.

“Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Wan-er, I’ll need your help to refine pills this time.” Long Chen turned to them. Due to his previous failure, his Spiritual Strength was low. However, with their assistance, he would definitely succeed.
