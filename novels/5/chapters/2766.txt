Chapter 2755 Violently Beating a Sovereign

Originally, everyone had felt a deep terror for Ye Ming since he had become a Sovereign. That was because the Sovereigns had left an undefeatable impression on people’s hearts.

In their hearts, Sovereigns were undefeatable existences. No one else could stand shoulder to shoulder with them.

However, Long Chen’s slap toppled that reality. Who cared if Ye Ming was a Sovereign? He could still be slapped in the face.

“Long Chen!”

Ye Ming roared, unable to maintain the dignity of a Sovereign now that he had been slapped. His face twisted until it looked like his crotch, and he furiously charged back at Long Chen.

“Transient Life Bridge!”

The world suddenly changed following Ye Ming’s cry, and a white bone bridge appeared in the air. Ye Ming and Long Chen both shrank and appeared on that bridge.

Every bone on that bridge let out an ear-piercing wail that pierced deep into people’s hearts. This was a sound attack that could shatter souls.

Even those outside of the bridge felt the sound crashing over them like waves. It was like ghosts demanding their life, invoking the most primal fear in people.

Holding his sword with both hands, Ye Ming attacked with a physical attack in combination with the sound attack.

“How foolish. You want to attack my heart? I, Long Chen, have never known fear.” Long Chen sneered. His spiritual sea churned against the sound of ten thousand ghosts wailing.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

BOOM!

A giant saber-image tore into the sky, and the bridge instantly exploded. It was simply a manifestation, not a true body.

There was no need for flashy moves at their level. It was a direct and simple clash of power.

As a result, both Ye Ming and Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood. In their full-power exchange, both sides were injured. But they were still even.

“I’ll slaughter you.” Long Chen snorted. These repeated exchanges had allowed Long Chen to probe Ye Ming’s true power.

His expectation was on the mark. This so-called Sovereign power was something that had exceeded the power of the ten thousand Daos to form a power that did not belong to this world.

This was why the Emperors could only be suppressed by the Sovereigns. One was within the cage, while the other had transcended it.

As for Long Chen, ever since his star diagram had awakened and he gained his new astral power, his power was also no longer part of the Martial Heaven Continent. He could be considered another kind of Sovereign.

Although his cultivation base was only at the ninth Heavenstage, his power did not lose out to Ye Ming. He was now confident he could kill the latter.

With three steps, Long Chen shot left and then right, shooting through the air erratically before finally attacking Ye Ming from a strange angle.

Ye Ming slashed his sword, only to hit nothing. It was actually an afterimage.

“Die!”

Suddenly, another figure charged over, slashing his saber. Ye Ming hastily turned around, pulling back his sword.

BOOM!

At the critical moment, Ye Ming managed to block it. However, his expression changed. This attack was far too weak.

Just at that moment, a palm silently struck Ye Ming’s back. A lotus flower mark revolved in that palm.

A large hole was blasted into Ye Ming’s body. After that, Ye Ming was sent flying, his Sovereign blood sprinkling through the air.

This was a Sovereign’s blood, something that contained the highest laws of an entire world. When it was spilled, it caused the heavens to change color.

“What dogshit Sovereign? The difference between you and the five Sovereigns of the continent is miles away. With your title being so fake, I will definitely kill you today,” sneered Long Chen. He extended his arm, and Evilmoon flew back into his hand, along with a bolt of lightning.

Just now, it was Lei Linger holding Evilmoon who had pretended to be Long Chen and attacked. As for Long Chen’s true body, it had waited to launch a powerful blow.

Ye Ming’s new Sovereign power was just like a mysterious veil over him. But now that this veil had been torn off, he was still the same Ye Ming. His techniques, his reactions, his patterns, they were fundamentally the same.

For such a person to call himself a Sovereign was practically an insult to the five Sovereigns. The reason that they were Sovereigns was because they had created their own unique techniques. They had not walked the common path. They had blazed an alternate path, each of them to the peak of the martial path.

Compared to them, Ye Ming was simply trash. After tearing away the wolf mask, he was still just a sheep. This actually made Long Chen angry. The five Sovereigns had a high position in his heart. Only the five Sovereigns had ever made him feel this way.

“Long Chen, I will slaughter you!” Ye Ming roared furiously, while the bloody wound continued to burn. The flames had yet to dissipate, but Ye Ming still charged toward Long Chen, black qi swirling around his body.

Long Chen blocked Ye Ming’s sword with Evilmoon and then slapped him in the face once more. This time, blood spurted out of Ye Ming’s nose.

“Who do you think you are to call yourself a Sovereign? Fuck, using a weapon is actually bullying you.”

Just like that, Long Chen put away Evilmoon and unleashed a barrage of punches at Ye Ming instead. Ye Ming then slashed his sword, causing blood to spray out of Long Chen’s fist. However, his sword was still knocked aside.

With his sword knocked aside, Ye Ming was open. After that, Long Chen landed a kick on Ye Ming’s crotch, causing him to let out a grunt. He then involuntarily bent like a shrimp.

As a result, his long hair fluttered. Mo Nian, Guo Ran, Gu Yang, and those familiar with Long Chen all sighed inside. It was over.

As they predicted, Long Chen immediately grabbed Ye Ming’s hair and smashed his face into his knee. This motion was incredibly fluid. It was done with a grace that did not match the action. Following that, the sound of bones breaking rang out along with Long Chen’s cursing.

BANG!

“Who said you could call yourself a Sovereign?!”

“Who said you could call yourself a Sovereign?!”

With every strike, the void rumbled. It wasn’t just the sound of Ye Ming’s bones breaking now, but there was also the sound of space cracking.

Ye Ming struggled crazily. He randomly swung his sword, managing to slice through Long Chen’s scales and make him bleed. But in his current state, he was only able to cause a few superficial wounds.

With the primal chaos space’s life energy, healing superficial wounds was simple.

“You little brat, did I give you too much face? You dare to call yourself a Sovereign? Just keep acting… Keep acting… Keep acting…” Long Chen emphasized his words with his knee, and Sovereign blood kept spraying out.

Mo Nian and the others simply watched in silence. Was this really a Sovereign? In this world, was there ever a Sovereign who was so viciously beaten?

They almost couldn’t believe their eyes. But the Sovereign blood spraying out caused the Heavenly Daos to rumble. It was truly a Sovereign, not a fake.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s heart shook and a sense of danger filled him. He instinctively swung Ye Ming like a hammer behind him.
