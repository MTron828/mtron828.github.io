Chapter 2608 Negotiation

“I have heard that the legends say it is hidden beneath the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. But I’ve never managed to confirm if it is true or not,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen doubted the existence of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. What divine item was so big? That was far too exaggerated.

Furthermore, anything about the Heaven Devastating Bracelet only existed in legend. There were all kinds of wild rumors about it, and none of that information was reliable.

“The Heaven Devastating Bracelet truly exists. It is also why the human race can only intimidate but not eradicate the sea demon race. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet lays at the bottom of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. The secrets contained within are only known to the sea demon race. But now that the strongest heir of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race has been killed by you, the sea demon race has been fully provoked-,” said the Ye family’s representative.

Long Chen interrupted, “You actually have the face to bring up that matter? If it weren’t for your help, would he have been killed by me?”

The Ye family’s representative barked, “That was completely unexpected. The one who started things was Ye Ming.”

Long Chen impatiently waved his hand. “Let’s not talk about such meaningless drivel. We can be simple and concise instead of you constantly trying to blame me for crap.”

The Ye family’s representative was truly brazen to try to place blame on Long Chen once more, making it as if he was a criminal. But after being checkmated, their representative furiously sat down.

The Long Deputy Elder took over. “The sea demon race is extremely mysterious. Furthermore, they have never revealed their full power, so we also don’t know whether or not they can control the power of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. This is why we cannot be careless when it comes to them. They are the most worrisome existence for us. The sea demon race used to have some ongoing relationships with our divine families, but ever since Daoist Heavenly Feather killed one of their experts, they’ve gone silent. This is not a good premonition.”

“If they’re such a scourge, why not join forces and eradicate them now?” asked Long Chen.

“You say it so simply. Do you know how powerful they are? Do you know that they very likely have an existence that can match the Lord Venerate?” snorted the Ye family’s representative.

“Idiot, if you don’t try, how will you know whether or not they’re faking it? Did you think spouting crap here will allow you to figure out their true power? Is your head devoid of a brain?” retorted Long Chen.

“You…!”

“Stop!” The Long Deputy Elder hastily interrupted once more. “Let’s talk specifics. We still hope to placate the sea demon race before it comes to that. The divine families will discuss this with them. However, Long Chen, you might have to sacrifice a bit…”

“Sacrifice what? Do you want me to apologize to them? That is impossible.” Long Chen directly refused. He wished to wipe them out of existence, so how could he apologize to them?

“Of course you don’t need to apologize personally. All you have to do is let out rumors, allowing the sea demon race to get out of their embarrassing situation. As long as you don’t expose those rumors, it will be fine,” said the Long Deputy Elder.

Long Chen thought about it. “When it comes to the sea demon race, it is impossible for me to work together with them, because sooner or later, I will wipe them out.”

These words caused the expressions of these experts to change. That was quite the claim as not even the divine families would dare to make such a declaration.

The Long Deputy Elder said, “That is something for the future. As the sea demon race is also one of the existences living on the Martial Heaven Continent, if the Martial Heaven Continent is destroyed, they will lose their home as well. They won’t just watch as the continent is destroyed. However, we must prevent them from taking advantage. If they launch an attack while we are badly wounded from the war, the consequences will be unimaginable.”

His words were clear. If Long Chen wanted to fight the sea demon race, then no one would bother him. However, the timing was important. At the very least, now was not the time.

Long Chen shrugged. “If you ask me to take a step back when it comes to them, I’m not doing it. But I’ve never bothered with the rumors that spread through the world anyway. It’s just that if the sea demon race suddenly shows up in front of me, well, my temper isn’t very good. I’ll do what I have to do.”

Long Chen made no promises when it came to the sea demon race. If the divine families wanted to pull them in, then fine. But he wouldn’t be part of it.

If the sea demon race really thought that he was afraid of them, then Long Chen wouldn't mind teaching them a lesson. Once he slapped them to death, the divine families shouldn’t blame him.

The Long Deputy Elder bitterly smiled. This character of Long Chen’s really was tough. He refused to take a single step back.

“Elder Long, during normal times, when it comes to our personal matters, perhaps I could give you face and make a slight concession. But right now, you are representing the divine families, and I am representing the Martial Heaven Alliance. There can be nothing personal about this discussion,” said Long Chen.

The Long Deputy Elder nodded, not taking offense. “Then let us discuss Pill Valley next. They have the inheritance of gods, and while they appear to just be a pill refining and selling place, in truth, they also possess immense power. The Pill Fairy Yu Qingxuan in particular has become a divine daughter. She has received a god’s blessing and her power is unfathomable. Once she activates the light of belief, her power will reach unimaginable levels. If we wish to fight off the enemy experts, Pill Valley’s power is indispensable. So…”

“As long as they don’t provoke me, I won’t provoke them,” said Long Chen. For some reason, he felt a sharp pain when he thought of Yu Qingxuan’s beautiful and icy face.

Yu Qingxuan was originally warm and kind to everyone. Her heart was beautiful during his time at Pill Valley. Once, She had even saved Long Chen by giving him her jade plate to protect him. Back then, she had been willing to take on a calamity so that he could escape. Long Chen had never forgotten this.

However, the current Yu Qingxuan was no longer the old Yu Qingxuan. She had become cold and emotionless. Her head was only filled with the edicts of the gods as though she didn’t have her own soul. She was like a puppet, and Long Chen couldn’t save her. He could only watch as she fell into the enemy's hands.

She had fought against him multiple times since. He had hated her at those times, but afterward, he was unable to feel hatred.

If Long Chen had to hate someone for it, it would be Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight, the two gods using the belief of their believer to turn Yu Qingxuan into an emotionless puppet.

He felt powerless when it came to Yu Qingxuan. If the divine families were really able to allow Pill Valley to remain neutral with him, he naturally wouldn’t go find trouble for them.

“That’s good. Then as for the Corrupt path… Ye Ming has probably been brainwashed by the experts of the other world, becoming their puppet. The Corrupt path can essentially be wiped out of the Martial Heaven Continent,” said the Long Deputy Elder.

However, by saying essentially, he had left some room. Whether or not they were targeting the Corrupt path would be up to the higher-ups.

The Corrupt path hadn’t had any further connection with the divine families during this time, and they even hid the matter of Long Chen entering Resentful Death City. That already showed their intention. Most likely, the Corrupt path was going to aid the experts of Resentful Death City to attack the Martial Heaven Continent.

“If you’re done with your issues, let’s talk about one of my issues. Why are the divine families targeting Yun Tian? After all, he is Sovereign Yun Shang’s son. Sovereign Yun Shang was the leader of the five Sovereigns, an unrivaled hero of the continent. Why would you target his son?” Long Chen’s gaze swept across Feng Fei and the others.

“Well…” The Long Deputy Elder didn’t know how to answer.

“It’s very simple. Each generation only has enough karmic luck to permit one Sovereign to be born, and every heavenly genius is fighting for that spot. It is a survival of the fittest, so your question is laughable,” sneered Ye Liangchen.

Long Chen nodded. “This answer is satisfactory. However, Yun Tian is my brother. If anyone targets him, I will fight them. If someone kills him, I will have an undying enmity with that person. Even if the competition for the position of Sovereign is a survival of the fittest as you said, we all have our reasons.”

The divine families hadn’t given a direct reply to why they wanted to kill Yun Tian. Long Chen believed that things definitely weren’t as simple as they appeared to be on the surface.

Furthermore, Ye Liangchen’s words had also infuriated him. Since he wanted it to be a survival of the fittest, fine. Long Chen would cut off his head to show him how it was a survival of the fittest.

This brief exchange between Long Chen and Ye Liangchen caused the atmosphere that had just started to lighten to tense up once more.

After that, the Long Deputy Elder suddenly stood. “We can end this discussion here. As for guarding the various passes, the details of how many people each side will send, we can figure it out later.”

Having reached this point in the discussion, he didn’t want to go any further. Long Chen’s temper was not good. Who knew whether he would ruin the entire discussion due to one small thing?

The divine families’ Elders then dispersed. From the side, Ye Liangchen glared at Long Chen coldly before leaving with Jiang Wuchen and the others.

Long Chen also had someone sent to him to accompany him away. Once he was out of the palace, he saw that Elder Long had been waiting for him.

“How were the negotiations?” said Elder Long.

“Alright. Many thanks for your reminder. It allowed me to keep a level head during this discussion,” said Long Chen.

As he said this, all the Elders sending him off had disdainful expressions. This was called keeping a level head? He had slapped the face of an Elder and would have killed him if it wasn’t for the Lord Venerate’s interference. If that was keeping a level head, then what would he do when he lost his head? Tear down the entire palace?

Elder Long laughed. “This aspect is something that I learned from the Huayun Sect. They are the truly wise ones. They have the self-restraint to never get angry.”

Speaking of the Huayun Sect, Long Chen suddenly thought to himself that they had been very low-key during this time. It seemed that they hadn’t made any moves. That was curious.

“Long Chen, let’s go see the family head. Perhaps you can obtain some useful information there,” transmitted Elder Long.

Long Chen hesitated for a moment but then nodded. He was nervous. He was getting closer and closer to his origins. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Elder Long then led Long Chen through the Long family’s territory. Atop a tower, the sinister Heaven Executioner watched as Long Chen left.

“Hatred and killing intent that stems from the depths of his soul. How strange.” The Heaven Executioner narrowed his eyes. His fingers tapped the table as he was lost in thought.
