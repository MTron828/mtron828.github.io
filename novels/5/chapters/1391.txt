Chapter 1392 Preparing to Forge Items

Translator: BornToBe

News that Long Chen had fought against Luo Minghao and Bloodkill 9 at the same time resounded throughout the Eastern Xuan Region. Most shocking of all was that of those two heavenly geniuses, one was slain and the other was sent fleeing.

Despite being struck by the Corrupt path’s Underworld Soul Ghost Curse, Long Chen hadn’t died. Instead, he had advanced to the Jade Core realm and his power had risen explosively. He won even one against two. If Bloodkill 9 hadn’t had an Ancestral item to protect him, he wouldn’t have been able to escape his death either.

At the same time, Long Chen’s ruthlessness enraged countless sects. Their strongest Jade Core disciples had all been killed by Long Chen. They had lost a whole generation of geniuses.

They went to demand justice from Pill Valley, wanting their Pill Tower to teach the Xuantian Dao Sect a lesson. Last time when Zhuo Tianxiang had led them to the Xuantian Dao Sect and their Life Star experts had been killed, they had received a large amount of compensation that had drawn Pill Valley closer to their side.

This time, they had suffered huge losses because they had been currying favor with Pill Valley. They had to stand up for them.

However, they hadn’t expected that the Eastern Xuan Region’s Pill Tower had changed masters. The new Tower Master was from the conservative faction.

As a result, the door was slammed in the face of these experts. They didn’t even get a single pill as compensation.

Now those sects were dumbfounded. Last time, the Pill Tower had been so generous. But this time, they were a cheapskate that wouldn’t even give them a copper coin.

These experts could only clench their teeth and return to their sects. They had to accept a fact. Pill Valley had been flipped on its head.

This was because of Master Long San. The radical faction had been completely suppressed. Although the valley master had said that he would put them in their place once he came out of seclusion, they were like death-row inmates. They only quietly waited for execution. Although they knew that the valley master wouldn’t kill them, they would at least be losing a layer of their skin. They were so busy acting obedient that they didn’t have time to bother with anything else.

With Pill Valley giving in, a storm of protest erupted in the Eastern Xuan Region. The Xuantian Dao Sect was too domineering. Long Chen had killed so many people, and yet no one dared to do anything to them. Even the ancient races and the ancient family alliance didn’t make a sound, let alone try to punish the Xuantian Dao Sect.

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s attitude was obvious. They were rising, and anyone who dared to try stropping them would be viewed as mortal enemies.

Even an existence as powerful as Pill Valley had retreated, not willing to provoke the Xuantian Dao Sect. It seemed even with their power, destroying the Xuantian Dao Sect would come at a huge price.

This was especially true with how Master Long San had half-destroyed Pill Valley.

Pill Valley didn’t want to do anything, while the ancient races and ancient family alliance also didn’t want to take any risks without getting anything in return. Although they were also enormous existences, they weren’t completely united.

Right now, the Xuantian Dao Sect was like a madman. No matter who went against them, the Xuantian Dao Sect would launch the craziest, fiercest attack. With the Xuantian Tower and Reincarnation Mirror backing them, no one dared to take the risk.

Most importantly, even if they did destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect, so what? Without any benefits, there was no way to unite enough people to attack them.

Battle needed a goal, and as long as there was a goal, they could make up any other excuses as to why they had to fight. But without any profit, no one would be willing to try consuming a hard bone like the Xuantian Dao Sect. Their teeth weren’t strong enough for it.

Although the Xuantian Dao Sect had declined, they had the Reincarnation Mirror and the Xuantian Tower. This was their foundation that made it so others didn’t dare to act rashly.

As for the sects that had maintained a neutral position because of the Huayun Sect, they were rejoicing inside now. After weighing the pros and cons, they had decided to not offend anyone and just watch as things developed.

It was because they had been so cautious that they had saved a generation of their disciples. Otherwise, if they had sent people there, they would definitely have died.

The battle in front of the Xuantian Dao Sect had been recorded, and photographic jades quickly spread throughout the Eastern Xuan Region. Everyone saw how terrifying Long Chen was.

People said that as long as they didn’t encounter any powerful opponents, the Xuantian Dao Sect would become the Eastern Xuan Region’s strongest sect in less than a decade.

However, some people had their suspicions. On that day, Long Chen hadn’t come out from within the Xuantian Dao Sect, but had arrived from outside the sect.

People quickly guessed that Long Chen hadn’t been in the Xuantian Dao Sect the entire time. The Xuantian Dao Sect had simply misled them to draw their attention.

Then what had Long Chen been doing during this time? Who had helped him remove the curse? Just as these questions began to pop up, news came from the Grand Xia Ancient Nation. People said that they had seen Long Chen in the Wine God Palace.

Once this news spread, everyone came to an understanding. Considering Long Chen’s close relationship with the Wine God Palace, it was clear that he had gone to them to remove the curse.

Once they thought of this, they realized there was only one person who was capable of removing this curse, which even the Xuantian Tower couldn’t suppress. It had to have been the Wine God Palace’s High Priest.

The High Priest’s position was transcendental. His position was just as high as Pill Valley’s master. As he couldn’t personally go to the Xuantian Dao Sect to help Long Chen, Long Chen had to have gone to him.

While Long Chen was gone, Li Tianxuan had intentionally acted nervous to draw everyone’s attention. It was to cover Long Chen, while he stealthily went to the Wine God Palace.

Very quickly, the Wine God Palace also sent out word that Long Chen had been in the Wine God Palace this entire time. He had been secluded in the High Priest’s palace. As for why the High Priest would personally remove the curse for Long Chen, no one knew.

Naturally, this was all prepared by Long Chen. When he had been in the Eastern Xuan City, he had gone to the Huayun Sect and written a letter for them to give to the Wine God Palace’s Tu Qianshang.

With the Wine God Palace testifying for him, no one would suspect that he was Master Long San.

Upon returning to the Xuantian Dao Sect, Long Chen finally had a few carefree days. He truly felt the Xuantian Dao Sect to be his home now.

He passed his days with Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, and the others. After relaxing for a few days, he called Guo Ran to his room.

“Boss, do you have good stuff for me?” Guo Ran’s eyes immediately began to shine. After following Long Chen for so many years, he understood him the best.

“Are you able to use this thing?” Long Chen tossed a fiery-red crystal to Guo Ran.

“Heavens, this... this is a Divine Flame Crystal!” Guo Ran’s eyes almost popped out. His forging arts had reached an extremely high level, and he had studied many rare ores and materials. He immediately recognized the Divine Flame Crystal.

“Can you use it?”

“Yes, definitely! This Divine Flame Crystal can be used to forge Ancestral items. It just so happens that I’ve been studying how to forge Ancestral items during this time, but I just haven’t had the materials. I should be able to refine this Divine Flame Crystal into the arrowhead of a supreme exploding arrow. Its power might not be on the level of an Ancestral item’s detonation, but as long as it’s used when they don’t expect it, it should be no problem for it to kill a Life Star expert,” said Guo Ran excitedly.

“Killing Life Star experts is meaningless. I want to know if you can forge it into armor or weapons.” Long Chen shook his head. He wasn’t interested in killing Life Star experts.

“Boss, if you put it like this... just how many of them do you have?”

“First answer my question. Can you do it?” This was what Long Chen wanted to know. Could he forge Ancestral items or not?

“Yes, I definitely can do it! Boss, I can do it. How many Divine Flame Crystals do you have?!” Guo Ran’s eyes blazed with anticipation.

“Don’t worry, there’ll be enough Divine Flame Crystals for you to use. I want to equip every warrior of the Dragonblood Legion with a set of armor and a matching weapon,” said Long Chen.

“You want to equip them all?” gasped Guo Ran. The Dragonblood Legion had over thirteen thousand members. That would mean thirteen thousand sets of armor and thirteen thousand weapons, all on the Ancestral item level. That was essentially impossible.

Originally, Guo Ran had thought he would just be equipping the captain-class fighters. Giving each one of them an Ancestral item would definitely be badass. But Long Chen wanted to equip every single person. That was too crazy.

“Close your jaw, I can see your stomach. Can you do it or not?” demanded Long Chen.

“Boss, to tell the truth, although I’m a genius and incredibly smart, hardworking and dedicated, one might say a generation’s leader...”

“Get to the point,” interrupted Long Chen.

“Cough, well, I haven’t forged Ancestral items before, and these Divine Flame Crystals have fire attributes. It’s my first time coming into contact with such material. Although I’ll definitely be able to forge them, there will be a few failed creations at the start...”

Guo Ran relied on himself to comprehend the Ethereal Crafting Secret Record. It was a tome that came from the immortal era, and it was incredibly difficult to understand. Although he had managed to learn quite a bit, and he thought he was around the level to start forging Ancestral items, the Forging Dao was also a Grand Dao, and there were countless techniques. As he tested things, he would definitely waste a few materials.

The materials for Ancestral items were incredibly precious. Even wasting just a bit would make his heart bleed.

“You really say a lot of nonsense. It’s fine as long as you can forge them in the end. Here, I’ll give you one portion for now, and you practice with it. Once you succeed in mastering this, we can research other possibilities.” Long Chen tossed a spatial ring to Guo Ran.

When Guo Ran looked inside the spatial ring, he almost dropped it. There were hundreds of thousands of Divine Flame Crystals.

“Boss, I’m going into seclusion! Just wait for the good news!” Guo Ran vanished like a wisp of smoke. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen knew that with Guo Ran’s passion for forging, he would be working without caring about sleep or food. That was one of Guo Ran’s good points.

However, Long Chen didn’t have particularly high hopes this time. Ancestral items weren’t so easy to forge, but at least trying was necessary.

After Guo Ran left, Long Chen also went into seclusion. Taking out a portion of the Alldevil monster’s essence blood, he began to refine pills.
