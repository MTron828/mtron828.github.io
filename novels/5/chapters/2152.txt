Chapter 2142 Hunting Pasture

The blood phoenix king died. The drake king roared, and all the other Magical Beasts on its side also roared, like troops raising morale. They began a furious assault on the opposing Magical Beasts.

The Magical Beasts that had come with the blood phoenix king retreated after their leader perished. But the other Magical Beasts refused to let them off.

One side fled, one side chased. The battlefield quickly emptied, leaving behind only giant corpses.

“Thank you for helping me defeat it. Starting today, I am the king of this entire world.” The drake king thanked Long Chen, with newfound respect for his power.

“Boss, that technique of yours is amazing! Even that blood phoenix was crushed! Who cares about those geniuses of the ancient era? Boss can still crush them!” Guo Ran ran over, shouting excitedly.

“Don’t be stupid. With such a long cast time, do you think others will just watch me use it? It’s not as amazing as you think it is because it’s easy to interrupt. People stronger than me won’t give me a chance to use it, and people weaker than me aren’t worth me using this move,” said Long Chen.

Perhaps against a dumb Magical Beast, this technique that took so long to cast was passable. Besides, it wouldn’t have hit the blood phoenix king if Long Chen hadn’t unleashed his dragon might to restrict its movements. If a powerful move couldn’t strike its target, then it was nothing more than a flashy firework.

“Really? Even such a powerful move is useless?” Guo Ran cried his disbelief.

“Fool, there’s no undefeatable move in this world, only undefeatable people. Techniques are dead things, but people are living. If you want to live, you have to learn when to use different moves at different times for the best effects. Ah, there’s no point explaining this to you. Your path is different from ours.” Long Chen avoided saying too much since Guo Ran’s cultivation path was different from everyone else’s.

“Leave behind five hundred people here to clean up the battlefield. Everyone else, follow me back to the channels to the devil world. We have to go assist the original devil race,” shouted Long Chen.

“Are they also fighting on that side?” asked Guo Ran, startled.

Long Chen scolded, “Is your head useless for everything other than forging? There was such an intense fight over here, but they didn’t come to assist. That means that they couldn’t come.”

Long Chen brought the Dragonblood Legion over, and as expected, they saw the original devil race in a fierce clash against the devil race.

This time, several devil races had come. They had both numbers and many powerful experts.

Yue Xihan and Yue Xiaoqian were both using their divine seals to kill them, but there were too many of them. They weren’t able to kill all the devils.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Just as the original devil race was starting to be overwhelmed, chanting filled the air, followed by a shout from Long Chen. A giant flame lotus exploded amongst the devil race.

The terrifying waves devoured the battlefield. Millions of devils were incinerated, with even the stronger ones only being able to struggle for a while before being burned alive.

Long Chen had wiped out the majority of the winged devils in one attack. The original devil race’s experts cheered. Their reinforcements had finally arrived.

After unleashing that attack, Long Chen turned a bit pale. After using the World Extermination Flame Lotus twice, his spiritual yuan, his Spiritual Strength, and his Yuan Spirit were all low on power. He felt empty.

However, the tides had instantly turned. The drake king and the Dragonblood warriors also joined in, quickly annihilating the rest of the devil race.

Xia Chen was covered in sweat and finally sighed with relief. He had been in charge of the formation and making sure that the devils trying to escape didn’t get out. Things had been incredibly chaotic just now, and he had exhausted himself, but fortunately not one devil managed to escape.

Long Chen had ordered Xia Chen to make the two channels here become only one way. None of the devils that came out could go back to report what was on the other side. If they knew that this place was a trap, it would cut off one of the paths for the original devil race to get stronger, so Xia Chen’s responsibility was quite heavy.

“Boss, you’re finally back. We almost couldn’t hold on any longer.” Xia Chen smiled bitterly.

Guo Ran explained what had happened on their side, and only then did everyone realize that the battle here had been even more terrifying than the battle with the Magical Beasts.

Long Chen looked at the mountains of corpses of the devil race. He asked, “What happened? Why would so many of them appear at once?”

“The attack was extremely sudden and quick. These devils aren’t from the same race, but they all appeared at the same time. Most likely, they’ve sensed something on the other side. After all, several groups have entered, but no one’s returned, so it naturally draws suspicion. Those few races probably grouped up and discussed it, deciding to charge in together to see what’s going on. We were able to hold on at the start, but as more of the devils appeared, we started to run out of energy, weakening the power of our divine seals. It was truly dangerous,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

It was incredibly coincidental. Attacks came from both sides at the same time. Despite Long Chen coming in time, over ten thousand of the original devil race’s warriors had died. The number of devils that had come this time was dozens of times greater than in the past, and furthermore, there had been many powerful experts amongst them.

“This is no good. We cannot allow such a thing to happen again. Xia Chen, set up an instant transportation formation. If things get tight here, make it so that a portion of the devils are instantly sent away,” said Long Chen. Being able to talk spiritually with the drake king, he felt it was no problem.

The blood phoenix king was dead, and there was no Magical Beast in this world that could match it. They would all have to listen to it.

Moreover, the Magical Beasts were bloody and warlike. It was fine for these devils to be transported to them to fight.

The only reason these Magical Beasts came out to fight under its orders wasn’t because they were loyal, but because of the fierce blood flowing in their veins. They liked to fight and weren’t afraid of death. If they didn’t have a fight after a long time, they would start fighting amongst themselves. The drake king didn’t care about their deaths.

Seeing the drake king nod, Long Chen had Xia Chen quickly set it up. It wasn’t too difficult for Xia Chen because the target location wasn’t very far. It was just where some of the Magical Beasts were concentrated.

Those Magical Beasts would automatically go crazy against invaders. There was no need to have someone control them.

Other than that, Long Chen set up several other backups just in case. Although there was a supreme expert like the drake king on their side, for the often unlucky Long Chen, keeping things in reserve was always best.

Seeing Long Chen set up one backup after another, Yue Xihan sighed. When it came to stratagems like this, the original devil race was lacking. If the original devil race had a strategist like Long Chen, perhaps they could have reversed the tides a while ago and soared.

After arranging things, everyone got back to work. Long Chen asked the drake king if it wanted to slaughter the nest of the western blood phoenix race, but its response was a bit surprising. It said that it didn’t feel any hatred for the blood phoenix race.

According to it, this was life. Experts died all the time. If you surrendered, you wouldn’t be immediately killed. Magical Beasts slaughtered each other for food all the time. But they wouldn’t exterminate a whole family or race. This was a law they naturally followed.

Only then did Long Chen realize why there were so many Magical Beasts in this world. However, he still felt that something was off. Why would Magical Beasts respect this rule? Didn’t they just act on instinct?

Just as he was pondering this, Yue Xihan and Yue Xiaoqian came over to his seclusion region. Long Chen hastily went to welcome them.

“My mom wants to see the blood phoenix king’s corpse.” Yue Xiaoqian went straight to the point.

Long Chen was curious, but he simply went to an empty region and plopped out the corpse.

Yue Xihan walked over to the corpse and touched its blood. Carefully looking at it and smelling it, she said, “There really is a problem.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“What is it?” asked Long Chen.

“The blood phoenix race is an ancient species. Although they aren’t as famous as the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, they’re still an extremely powerful existence. However, its bloodline has become muddled, making it no more than a mindless Magical Beast. How can you explain that? It’s not just the blood phoenix or the golden drake. Many of the Magical Beasts in this world are actually very famous Xuan Beasts,” said Yue Xihan.

“Xuan Beasts?” This information was truly shocking to Long Chen. Most of what he knew about Magical Beasts only pertained to alchemy. He didn’t know much else.

A surprising proportion of these Magical Beasts here had reached the peak of the twelfth rank. However, due to their impure bloodlines, many of their natural abilities had been lost, and their intelligence was low.

However, if they were Xuan Beasts? Then that would be heaven-defying. The Xuan Beasts possessed terrifying innate divine abilities and intelligence on par with humans. If this many twelfth rank Xuan Beasts appeared, they would be enough to trample the Martial Heaven Continent.

“Correct. They should be Xuan Beasts. However, their bloodline has lost a few inheritance runes, causing them to lose their innate divine abilities. They will never be able to return to that ancestral level. Furthermore, I’ve checked their crystal cores. They lack a trace of spirituality making it so they cannot awaken their latent potential. Have you noticed? Many of the Magical Beasts have runes for divine abilities on their scales, horns, eyes, tails, etc. However, they are unable to use those divine abilities.”

“Now that you say that, I recall that truly is the case.” Long Chen slapped his leg. He had always found the Magical Beasts of this world to be strange. Now that Yue Xihan brought it up, he realized what it was.

“If my guess is correct, this Wild World might be a hunting pasture for the devil race,” said Yue Xihan gravely.
