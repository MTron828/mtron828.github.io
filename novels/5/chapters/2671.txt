Chapter 2660 Lei Linger

The voice was foreign, but its spiritual fluctuations were familiar. Right now, Long Chen was delighted to see that the giant lightning dragon in the primal chaos space had vanished, replaced with a delicate young lady who appeared to be fourteen or fifteen years old. She had blue eyes and blue hair, with lightning runes covering her entire body.

“You’re Lei… Linger.”

When Huo Linger had taken human form, Long Chen had changed her name from Huo Long to Huo Linger as she had gone from a flame dragon to a flame spirit.

At that time, Long Chen had decided that if one day Lei Long also achieved the same level of spirituality, he would call it Lei Batian if it transformed into a male, or Lei Linger if it transformed into a girl. Then Lei Linger and Huo Linger would be sisters.

Originally, Long Chen had thought that a manifestation of lightning would transform into a large man like a lightning god. Perhaps it was due to being influenced by Huo Linger, but the form Lei Long took was very similar to her. It was just that one was red and one was blue.

“Big brother Long Chen, I’ve finally absorbed enough lightning to complete the initial step of awakening. I now have a ten thousand lightning body and am not afraid of any kind of lightning. All their lightning techniques can be destroyed by a wave of my hand,” said Lei Linger confidently.

Just at this moment, lightning flickered in the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s hand, and it condensed into a sword filled with Devil Qi.

Previously, it had been this lightning sword that had easily swept through his clones, annihilating them. This was a technique that not even the Heavenly Daos were capable of replicating. Now, it was piercing toward Long Chen.

“Lei Linger, let them see your true power.” Long Chen didn’t turn back at the devil sword pierced toward his back. Instead, he reached back with a hand covered in lightning runes.

In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Chen caught the devil sword between his forefinger and middle finger.

“What?!”

Countless people cried out. He used two fingers to block the full-power attack of the Aldevil Heavenwalker? Was Long Chen defying the heavens?

Everyone’s jaws dropped. Just what had Long Chen gone through to become so terrifying?

“That was amazingly flashy.” Mo Nian couldn’t help sighing in admiration. This posture, this expression, this style, it had reached the pinnacle of showing off. There was no way to surpass this.

“You only have this little bit of power? What a foolish devil race.” Long Chen slowly turned around to face the shocked Alldevil Heavenwalker.

Since he was showing off, he might as well show off some more. Feeling the endless power coming from Lei Linger, Long Chen suddenly applied some pressure with his fingers.

As a result, the lightning sword was shattered by Long Chen’s two hands. After shattering, it exploded.

At this moment, a wave of lightning spread in every direction. The berserk will of the Heavenly Daos caused the world to shake.

“This sword contained the will of an entire world. It was condensed from the laws of the devil world, but the result was…”

An entire world’s power had been snapped into two by Long Chen’s fingers. They had known that Long Chen was a terrifying individual, but how could his power reach such an extent? Was this really the Long Chen they knew?

“Lei Linger, you’re incredible!” Long Chen looked at the lightning runes revolving around his fingers. In truth, the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s sword had been incredibly powerful. However, it was made of lightning. As long as it was made of lightning, it was under the domain of Lei Linger.

Although it looked like he had applied some pressure with his fingers and snapped the blade, in truth, Lei Linger had injected her energy into the sword, causing its energy balance to be thrown into disarray. Hence, this resulted in the sword crumbling. Everyone had been misled by Long Chen.

Even the master of that devil sword, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, was stunned. He didn’t understand what had just happened.

“You simply control lightning. As long as we don’t use lightning, this ability of yours will be useless,” sneered the Nine-Headed Lion. As someone who had also absorbed the lightning of the world, he had seen some clues.

Just as he finished speaking, Long Chen suddenly pounced over to him and slapped his face.

BOOM!

A lightning rune exploded in Long Chen’s palm. The Nine-Headed Lion’s face caved in, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. As he flew back, four bloody teeth flew out.

Long Chen had slapped the Nine-Headed Lion before. At that time, rather than sending him flying, it was his own hand that was hurt.

But this time, it was different. The face-slap was still a face-slap. It was the same familiar move but no longer the same flavor.

Just as Long Chen’s slap was about to land, Lei Linger condensed a lightning rune in his palm. It exploded when it struck, resulting in this shocking effect.

His face-slapping art had an almost hundred percent success rate. An important reason for this was that it didn’t contain any killing intent, making it so that others were unable to sense any threat. Unable to sense the impending danger, they couldn’t instinctively dodge or defend.

However, with Lei Linger’s cooperation, it became a killer move. Long Chen was in charge of slapping, and Lei Linger was in charge of conning.

Due to the lightning rune condensing at the very end of the slap, even if the other side did sense it, they wouldn’t have time to dodge it.

Even the Nine-Headed Lion, with his powerful tempered physical body, was injured to such an extent. If it was someone else, this slap would have been enough to blow up their head.

Long Chen was delighted by the success of his first cooperation with Lei Linger. He then turned to the Alldevil Heavenwalker, whose expression completely changed.

With a furious shout, devil qi condensed into chains that formed layers of nets. At the same time, he rapidly retreated. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He was finally frightened. Long Chen’s slap just now had made his heart sink. His physical body was not as strong as the Nine-Headed Lion. If he was the one struck by it, it would no longer be just a mental humiliation. It could potentially kill him.

As the Alldevil Heavenwalker created distance between himself and Long Chen, lightning suddenly exploded out of Long Chen as he stamped a foot on the first net. He vanished.

Just as he vanished, the dragon woman, Nine-Headed Lion, Alldevil Heavenwalker, and Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s expressions changed. They quickly formed hand seals, summoning a domain of divine energy around themselves.

BOOM!

Their domains had only just appeared when Long Chen appeared within the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s blood light. As a result, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord quickly condensed a spear that was destroyed by a punch from Long Chen. He quickly retreated, maintaining a safe distance from Long Chen.

They no longer dare to fight Long Chen in close range. They formed hand seals instead, unleashing long-range attacks on him.

Suddenly, a blue lotus appeared below Long Chen’s feet, unleashing a dream-like glow. The entire world was shrouded in a mysterious veil.

The four of their attacks struck the lotus and simply bounced off, unable to harm it at all.

“So strong!” Long Chen had flowers blooming in his heart. Lei Linger’s power was greater than he had ever imagined after taking human form. Those attacks were unable to break her defenses.

Feng Fei stared in shock at that lightning lotus. Long Chen’s power far surpassed her expectations.

“Run now!”

Just as Feng Fei was staring in shock at Long Chen’s lotus, Long Chen’s voice rang out in her head.
