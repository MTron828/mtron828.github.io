Chapter 1471 Challenging a Sect on his Own

Translator: BornToBe

The grand formation in the air shook, and countless runes gathered from it, condensing into a golden spear. It pierced down like a heavenly spear.

This was an attack that contained the full power of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s grand protective formation. It was terrifyingly powerful. Just the pressure from it made everyone’s hearts quiver.

Moreover, they were just feeling some weak shockwaves. They were unable to imagine the pressure Long Chen was under as the main target of the attack.

“The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s mouths are loathsome. Ah, whatever. I’ll be the one helping you out today.” Long Chen slashed Evilmoon, and a huge black saber-image crashed into the spear.

BOOM!

The spear exploded. Not only that, but the huge saber-image also split apart the sky. The grand formation was broken.

Cracks spread throughout the formation until it completely shattered.

“The grand formation... it... it broke...?!”

Long Chen’s shocking attack not only crushed the grand formation, but it also crushed all their hearts.

His arrival had caused an alarm to ring throughout the sect. All their experts had rushed over, only to witness a power even more terrifying than the legends. Long Chen’s power made it so none of them even dared to resist. They were all pale, filled with terror.

The vice sect master coughed up blood from the backlash of having the grand formation broken. Suddenly, his vision flashed. Long Chen had appeared in front of him and slapped him in the face.

“Your mouth is too disgusting.”

The vice sect master already had a handprint on his face from the first slap. This time, he wasn’t sent flying but was directly blown apart instead.

Long Chen swung the back of his palm in another slap, which ended up missing. His original intent had been to continuously slap the vice sect master.

He had forgotten that without the support of the grand formation, the vice sect master couldn’t endure even a slap from him. The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s people had extremely weak physical bodies.

With his physical body destroyed, the vice sect master’s Yuan Spirit flew out. He tried to flee, as there was no way he could block Long Chen.

The vice sect master was filled with regret. He had been too confident. He had never imagined that Long Chen was so terrifying.

Just as he turned to flee, Long Chen pointed a finger. A lightning arrow pierced through the Yuan Spirit.

“Nooo...” The vice sect master’s cry of despair hung in the air as his Yuan Spirit exploded. Ripples spread in the air where he died.

“He didn’t know about what Qi Yunao did?” Long Chen was surprised. He had rapidly investigated the vice sect master’s soul, and he hadn’t found any restrictions. He had quickly gone through the majority of his memories but hadn’t seen any memory of Qi Yunao attacking the Xuantian Dao Sect.

When he had killed the Corrupt dwarf, he had managed to grasp a fragment of his soul in which he had seen the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff unleashing a powerful attack, as well as Qi Yunao’s figure. Clearly, this vice sect master didn’t know the truth.

Long Chen waved his hand, and the ripples in the air faded. The vice sect master completely died.

“All members of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, I, Long Chen, have come today for revenge. If you don’t want to die, then you should hurry up and scram!” Long Chen looked coldly at the distant disciples of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect.

Long Chen began to float into the air, Dragonbone Evilmoon on his shoulder. After killing the vice sect master, he appeared indescribably imposing. He was like the reincarnation of a devil god.

“Haha, how senseless.” Dragonbone Evilmoon snorted, its voice full of disdain. It clearly found Long Chen’s actions to be incorrect.

To Dragonbone Evilmoon, there was no need to even say such a thing. Since he had decided to be decisive, then he should slaughter everything within the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, making it a land of death without even a chicken overlooked.

Yet, for Long Chen to actually warn such people, Dragonbone Evilmoon couldn’t comprehend such foolishness.

“Long Chen, are you trying to get yourself killed?”

Just as all the experts of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect were filled with terror, a voice suddenly rang out.

Two new figures appeared. One was the one Long Chen recognized, Qi Yunao. He held a violet-gold staff in his hand, and divine light circulated around his body.

That staff was composed of nine strands of wood, and its head had nine gemstones shining with divine light. Primal chaos circulated around it along with a Grand Dao.

This was the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s core divine item: the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff. It was as famous as the Xuantian Tower and the Heaven Splitting Blade.

There was also an elder beside Qi Yunao. When Long Chen saw this person, he narrowed his eyes. He also recognized this person. He was a Life Star expert, but he was not from the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect. No, he came from the Martial Heaven Alliance.

Back then, the Eastern Xuan branch of the Martial Heaven Alliance had had their vice alliance master, Deng Cang, collude with Pill Valley’s Zhuo Tianxiang. They had tried to borrow the power of all the Eastern Xuan Region’s sects to destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect.

However, Long Chen had slapped them in the face, and then the Huayun Sect’s Yue Qingshan had exposed Deng Cang and Zhuo Tianxiang’s relationship. In the end, Deng Cang had been handled by the Martial Heaven Alliance.

Afterward, the Martial Heaven Alliance had sent someone to the Xuantian Dao Sect to express their apologies and give them their reward for their contributions. They had also done the transactions for the resources the Xuantian Dao Sect had asked for with the greatest speed. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The person in charge of that was precisely this person. Long Chen recalled that his name was Luo Jinnan. He was the current vice alliance master of the Eastern Xuan region’s Martial Heaven Alliance.

For him to appear now, Long Chen immediately sensed something fishy. He coldly stared at the two of them, not saying anything.

Qi Yunao’s arrival lifted the spirits of all the disciples present.

“The sect master has finally come out of seclusion! We’re saved!”

“Please sect master, kill this brute Long Chen! But don’t give him too easy of a death!”

“Don’t forget to extract his soul. There are plenty of ways of slowly torturing him...”

The terrified disciples immediately had their morale explode. They all began to curse Long Chen, looking like they wanted to personally tear him apart piece by piece. They were no longer afraid.

“Didn’t I tell you that you were stupid? You actually wanted to let these people off? Did you think they would be grateful? What a joke,” sneered Evilmoon.

“I have no enmity with these people, so I gave them a chance to live. If they could grasp it, then fine. If they couldn’t, then I’ll simply kill them and they can’t blame me. I always keep my conscious clean,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen was not a saint, but he wasn’t a homicidal maniac either. Amongst the millions of disciples in the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, there were many idiots. But there were definitely some good people as well.

For this small portion of good people, Long Chen gave them a chance to live. As for whether those good people grasped that chance to leave or not, it was up to their luck.

In this merciless world of slaughter, he could only do so much. To be merciful on the battlefield was purely courting death. And that death would be very miserable.

Experts had to kill decisively. They couldn’t be sloppy, nor could they be soft-hearted. That was why Evilmoon found Long Chen’s actions very contemptible. But Long Chen had his own principles.

“What bullshit. It’s just a waste of time,” said Evilmoon disdainfully.

Long Chen ignored its tone. Instead, he asked, “Can you handle the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff?”

That was the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s core divine item. Everyone knew its power. Now that he saw it, he felt a bit uncertain.

“That staff is a bit decent I suppose. Perhaps I can’t handle it in my current state.” Evilmoon’s words caused Long Chen’s expression to change, but it hastily added, “Don’t start cursing. First, I’m still very weak, and two, I’m still under the Sovereign’s seal. It’s only natural I can’t beat it. But don’t panic, although I can’t beat it, holding on against it for some time won’t be a problem. This time, we’re only here to dredge up some benefits before leaving.”

After hearing the rest, Long Chen felt better. If Evilmoon couldn’t handle the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff, then today, he would have really sent himself to his death.

Now, he didn’t need to be in a rush. He calmly stared at Qi Yunao and Luo Jinnan.

“Long Chen, you are a disciple of the Righteous path, but your heart is filled with evil. You slaughter your fellow race and join sides with devils. You’ve become completely different. Don’t you think it’s time to put down your blade and face the consequences?” shouted Luo Jinnan.

Long Chen stared at Luo Jinnan and then looked at Qi Yunao. Possibilities rapidly flitted through his mind. He calmly said, “Luo Jinnan, as vice alliance master of the Eastern Xuan Region, what intentions do you have by slandering me?”

“Slander? You are a wanted criminal of not only the Corrupt path, ancient races, ancient family alliance, and the Bloodkill Hall, but you are also a wanted criminal of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Everyone has issued a death warrant for you. When everyone in this world is already your enemy, why would I need to slander you?” sneered Luo Jinnan.

“Even the Martial Heaven Alliance views me as a wanted criminal? That’s surprising. What’s the reason?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“The reason? You betrayed the continent and colluded with the Spirit World’s tree demons. You even helped those tree demons slay your fellow humans. If you just killed Corrupt experts, no one would care. But you killed people from the ancient races, and that threatens the peace of the continent. Most importantly, you even slaughtered people from the ancient family alliance mercilessly. They are a faction within the Righteous path. Now, not only are you a traitor of the Righteous path, but you are also a traitor of the entire continent. So, is this reason enough?” Luo Jinnan smiled coldly. With the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff on their side, he was fearless.

“Is it just because of this that you joined hands to destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect?” Long Chen’s voice instantly became chilly, and boundless killing intent erupted.
