Chapter 4895 Plundering Heavenly Chosen

BOOM!

Without any warning, the ground beneath Long Chen’s feet exploded, and the shockwave sent Long Chen flying.

Feeling as if he had been struck by a shooting star, Long Chen spat out a mouthful of blood. It was all too sudden for him to react at all.

At this moment, qi waves surged across the land, while a twister of dust and soil soared into the sky, directly piercing the black heavenly screen.

Even once it broke the heavenly screen, the twister’s power didn’t diminish. It unfurled, creating an even larger hole in the heavenly screen. The light of the sun actually came through the hole and illuminated Heaven Screen Mountain for the first time in forever.

Because of the twister, black soil flew through the air in giant waves. Long Chen simply stood within the waves, watching the core region, and then he saw two figures in ragged robes.

One of them was lean, while the other was muscular. The lean man had blood-red hair, looking so thin as if he were just skin and bones. It felt like without that layer of skin, he would simply fall apart.

As for the muscular man, he was covered in black fur like an ape, and his Blood Qi was like an erupting volcano.

To Long Chen’s surprise, both of them had a Heavenly Fate Disk behind them.

The two of them were actually both Heavenly Chosens. However, at this moment, they looked a bit wretched. Their robes were in tatters, and they were covered in wounds.

After a moment of shock, Long Chen chuckled sinisterly, his blood heating up. “One Blood expert and one devil expert. Hehe, interesting.”

At this moment, the two of them also took note of Long Chen, and killing intent instantly blazed in their eyes.

“I didn’t expect you to escape from Huo Qianwu. It seems that her power isn’t as great as her appearance,” said the wizened Blood expert as he stared at Long Chen darkly.

“That woman is useless, but this is good as well. If I kill you now, the Flame Divine Hall can’t say anything,” remarked the muscular devil expert with bloodlust.

“Why the chit-chat? Hand over all the treasures you got and just kill yourselves. That way, at least I’ll leave your corpses intact,” countered Long Chen lightly.

The Blood expert and devil expert couldn’t believe their ears. Did Long Chen really want to plunder them? How could an ordinary cultivator be trying to rob two Heavenly Chosens?

The Blood expert laughed, “Idiot, if it weren’t for Huo Qianwu’s stubbornness, do you think that you would have survived to enter Heaven Screen Mountain? That annoying woman demanded the right to take your head herself.”

Hearing this, Long Chen snorted, “So it seems that the two of you are very afraid of Huo Qianwu. Even when she wanted to fight me herself, the two of you didn’t dare to say anything. Did you guys not mind that both my hands are stained by the blood of your races?”

Even though Long Chen sounded confident, he was a bit uneasy inside. From their tone of speaking, it seemed that the Divine Flame Hall was plotting something in this opening of Heaven Screen Mountain.

Long Chen was mortal enemies with the devil race and the Blood race. Their enmity would not cease until one side was annihilated. But the fact that they refrained from fighting him because Huo Qianwu wanted to face him herself was baffling. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If this were true, it was highly likely that these groups had already made prior arrangements with the Flame Divine Hall. Otherwise, they wouldn’t say such a thing.

The devil race’s Heavenly Chosen furiously roared, “Shut your mouth! The fact that you escaped from Huo Qianwu’s hands only means you were lucky. That, or that girl fell for your pretty boy face. But now that you’re in our hands, all that awaits you is death!”

Our hands?

Long Chen was startled. It seemed that his initial judgment was off. He had assumed that the two of them had started fighting over some treasure, resulting in their injuries. However, it seemed that wasn’t the case. Although one of them had come first, it appeared the two of them had reached an agreement and were not hostile toward each other. They were going to face him together.

“Pretty boy face?” asked Long Chen, an odd expression covering his face. Since when had he become someone who relied on his face to flee for his life?

At this moment, the ground beneath their feet shook again. It was like something that had been buried for countless years was on the verge of coming into the light once more.

“This fellow has killed countless experts of my devil race. I can’t let you have him.” Not giving the Blood expert any chance to argue, the devil expert directly shot toward Long Chen and swung a steel rod at him.

This steel rod was as thick as a person’s thigh, with countless runes of the devil race carved into it. As soon as it showed up, devil qi exploded—what a terrifying Heaven Saint divine weapon!

“Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor!”

Long Chen didn’t dare to hold back. He directly ignited his blood and summoned his strongest Dragon Blood Battle Armor. He then swung Evilmoon down to collide with the steel rod.

The devil expert specialized in raw power and had never met someone who could match him. However, when he clashed with Long Chen, his hands went numb, and blood dripped from them. His steel rod was sent flying from his grasp.

While Long Chen also lost hold of Evilmoon, he was prepared. Having fought Huo Qianwu, he knew how terrifying a Heavenly Fate Disk was. Hence, the moment Evilmoon flew away, he spun and slapped the devil expert’s face with a hand covered in stars.

His slap sent the devil expert flying, and then Long Chen’s other hand smoothly caught Evilmoon. After that, his dragon blood erupted, and he launched Split the Heavens again.

Long Chen’s movements were incredibly smooth, completing the entire sequence without pause. Even though both of them were evenly matched in the initial clash, the devil expert was caught off-guard by Long Chen’s seamless transition into the next attack.

BOOM!

The devil expert roared and crossed his arms in front of him, summoning his Heavenly Fate Disk to be a shield for him. As a result, both he and Long Chen were blown back at the same time.

The devil expert’s expression changed as a small nick appeared in his Heavenly Fate Disk. Just as he felt a mixture of shock and anger, Long Chen once more pounced at him. With the initiative now in Long Chen’s favor and the devil expert’s Heavenly Fate Disk no longer in perfect condition, it was the best time to kill the devil expert.

BOOM!

Just as Long Chen prepared to strike, the ground collapsed beneath him, sucking him in. The devil expert and Blood expert cried out in shock as they too were swallowed by the earth.
