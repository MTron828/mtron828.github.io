Chapter 3874 Ji Wuming Retreats

This person appeared bizarrely, without any warning. Considering that Guo Ran had his Heavenly Dao Crown on, he had a high level of control over the surrounding space. But even then, he hadn’t noticed him.

“Ji Wuming!”

When Guo Ran saw the attacker clearly, he was enraged. It was the Bloodkill Hall’s number one heavenly genius, Ji Wuming.

Ji Wuming’s dagger stabbed straight toward Long Chen, and Guo Ran had no time to stop him. However, just as Ji Wuming was a few feet away from Long Chen, golden light shot out of Long Chen. The dragon scale beneath him quivered. Ji Wuming then grunted as he was blasted back by formless divine might.

“Hahahaha! You want to sneak attack my boss? Keep dreaming!” Seeing that Long Chen was safe and sound, Guo Ran laughed. Ji Wuming was unable to harm Long Chen, so Guo Ran directly attacked him.

Ji Wuming was shocked, looking at the dragon scale beneath Long Chen. He sensed a terrifying pressure from it.

BOOM!

The next moment, Guo Ran’s saber fell and Ji Wuming received it with his dagger. With an explosive sound, the space behind Ji Wuming collapsed, but his actual body didn’t shake in the slightest. He transmitted the power of Guo Ran’s attack into the space behind him.

Guo Ran was astonished. In just a short time after their last encounter, Ji Wuming’s control over spatial energy had grown to the point of him being able to control it at will. He was capable of controlling it easily without showing any openings. As a result, Guo Ran’s attack was unable to injure him.

Suddenly, Guo Ran’s heart shuddered. An intense sensation of danger swelled within him. At this moment, Ji Wuming’s dagger had somehow appeared next to his throat. It was so fast that Guo Ran didn’t have time to react.

Sparks flew and the dagger cut across his armor, emitting a scratching sound that made Guo Ran wince painfully.

The moment he had sensed danger, he summoned his battle armor. Thus, there was now a large cut in his Devil Dragon Battle Armor.

Fortunately, in his Dragon Blood Battle Armor state, the scales on his neck had managed to stop the dagger. But that chilling dagger still gave him goosebumps.

“Your reaction speed isn’t bad. But it’s still useless. Killing you is as easy as turning a hand.” Ji Wuming was slightly surprised that he hadn’t cut off Guo Ran’s head in one attack. But his tone quickly became one of disdain.

“Bullshit!”

Guo Ran shouted angrily and attacked. Seeing him attacking, Ji Wuming snorted. His dagger then swept through the air until he was holding it behind him. At the same time, a strange mark appeared on his left hand, and he slammed it at Guo Ran.

However, just then, Ji Wuming’s expression completely changed. The rune in his left hand instantly changed to a different rune.

Countless pinholes suddenly appeared on Guo Ran’s chestplate. After that, golden needles shot out, instantly piercing through Ji Wuming’s body. At this distance, he had no chance to dodge.

“Hahaha, you thought that you could-”

Guo Ran laughed. His saber attack was nothing more than a distraction to draw Ji Wuming’s attention, and his true killing blow was the mechanism on his chest. This move was very sinister. He gave Ji Wuming no chance to react. Seeing those needles piercing his opponent’s body, Guo Ran was excited. But that smile quickly stiffened.

The needles actually passed straight through Ji Wuming’s body. There was no blood. At the same time, an intense sensation of crisis instantly struck Guo Ran.

Without hesitation, Guo Ran’s wings folded around him, forming a powerful protective barrier.

The next moment, a dagger stabbed into his back. It directly struck his wings, and the immense power actually dented them. Guo Ran tumbled into the distance.

Guo Ran was shocked. His wings had multiple states to which he could switch between. When his wings folded like an armored beetle, that was their strongest defensive state.

However, even in this state, a dent was left in his wings and multiple of their runes were destroyed. Ji Wuming’s attack was simply terrifying.

Guo Ran was instantly covered in a cold sweat. Fortunately, he had condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown and had even sharper senses than before. Otherwise, he would probably have died.

“Fuck, I refuse to believe that I can’t beat you!”

Guo Ran’s battle intent was stimulated. He had just made his breakthrough, and someone was already trying to deal a blow to his new confidence? That was unacceptable.

At this moment, his battle armor lit up and golden light flowed on top of his dual sabers. He directly attacked.

Seeing this, Ji Wuming was finally a bit afraid. Having both of his attacks blocked startled him.

Previously, he didn’t view Guo Ran as any threat. It was because he knew Guo Ran’s abilities and so he didn’t place Guo Ran in his eyes.

However, he could no longer view Guo Ran so lightly. Not only was his reaction speed astonishing, but the golden needles that had shot out of his chest just now truly made Ji Wuming jump in shock. If he hadn’t absorbed some primal chaos qi recently, which caused his control over space and time to rise, he wouldn’t have been able to dodge this sinister move.

Guo Ran’s needles were all backed by runes and would explode on contact with blood. So, even someone as powerful as Ji Wuming would have a miserable death if he was struck.

As a result, he had a headache when it came to Guo Ran, whose battle armor equipped him to the teeth. As Ji Wuming couldn’t fully penetrate his defenses, it was hard to cause any substantial wounds to Guo Ran.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

On the other hand, Guo Ran had countless sinister moves up his sleeve. If Ji Wuming fell for a single one, he would not be able to survive. Seeing more and more experts coming here and fighting for the dragon corpses, he snorted. “I’ll take your life later.”

His figure swayed, and he instantly melded into nothingness. He merged into the void like water, vanishing without a trace.

As a result, Guo Ran’s attack missed. Having completely lost track of Ji Wuming, he also snorted. “Shameless things, all you know how to do is hide. If you have guts, come fight grandpa Guo! Let’s exchange thirty thousand blows!”

Guo Ran was a bit unhappy with this fight. He had just condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown and the Golden Dragon Battle Armor, so he still wasn’t fully accustomed to his current power.

Most importantly, his Devil Dragon Battle Armor was built for his previous power level. Now that his power had suddenly soared by dozens of times, it was no longer a perfect match for him. Guo Ran was not used to this. Despite all his terrifying power, he was unable to fully draw out his potential.

He cursed furiously, but Ji Wuming ignored him. He left just like that to absorb primal chaos qi from another dragon corpse, and Guo Ran didn’t dare to chase him. After all, he had to look after everyone and didn’t dare to be careless.

Although Long Chen was protected by the dragon scale, making it difficult for others to harm him, there were also Mo Nian, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, and the other members of the Dragonblood Legion. If someone sneak attacked them, that would be troublesome. He had to guard them.

After a while, rumbling rang out and black qi surged over the horizon. Within this black qi was a terrifying lifeform.

When this lifeform appeared, every expert present without exception felt an icy chill. They stared in horror at that lifeform within the black qi.
