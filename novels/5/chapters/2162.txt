Chapter 2152 An Alluring Attack

“Really? The Corrupt God Cemetery can’t be entered?” asked Mo Nian. Going there was currently his best option for getting rich quickly.

“Do you even know the origins of the Corrupt God Cemetery?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a glance and shook their heads. All they knew was that there was definitely good stuff there.

Beitang Rushuang was speechless. “You don’t even know the situation, yet you dare to set your sights on it? Your guts are too big.”

“Guts equal profits!” said Mo Nian solemnly.

“Pah. Do you even know why the Corrupt God Cemetery is called the Corrupt God Cemetery? It’s because the Corrupt God’s true corpse is buried within! No one dares to enter, not even the master of the Corrupt path,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“Isn’t it said that the Corrupt path’s supreme experts will be buried inside when they die?” asked Long Chen.

“That’s right, those old monsters of the Corrupt path were definitely buried with some good stuff. Of course, I’m not doing this for those treasures but to research history. Yes, I’m a researcher of history,” said Mo Nian. “If it’s impossible to enter, how did those corpses get in? Did they fly in by themselves?”

“You simply don’t understand. If it was anyone else, I wouldn’t bother saying anything, but fine. The people who carry the coffins into the Corrupt God Cemetery are all buried inside as well. If you want to become a funerary object as well, do as you please,” said Beitang Rushuang indifferently.

Hearing that, Long Chen and Mo Nian nodded at the same time and said in unison, “It seems that we’ll need a surefire plan.”

The two of them were still set on going to the Corrupt God Cemetery. Beitang Rushuang almost got angry, but she couldn’t be bothered to waste any more effort on these two crazy guys. When she had said that the Corrupt God’s true body was entombed there, both their eyes had lit up at the same time.

“Ah, about that, sister Rushuang...” Mo Nian put on his warmest smile.

“Don’t smile so sinisterly. If you have something to say, say it directly. Also, don’t call me sister, we’re not so close,” said Beitang Rushuang immediately.

Mo Nian’s smile stiffened. When it came to picking up girls, he was still lacking. He beckoned to Long Chen. “You handle her.”

Long Chen almost hit him for saying that. What kind of friend conned you all the time?

However, Beitang Rushuang was ignoring Mo Nian, so Long Chen said, “Ah, about that, haha, in truth, we just want to know a bit about the Corrupt God Cemetery. Can fairy Rushuang make things convenient for us?”

“Why do I have to make things convenient for you? Let me tell you, it’s very inconvenient for me right now.” Beitang Rushuang immediately started putting on the airs of an important person. This was Long Chen’s first time talking to her from such a subservient point. If she didn’t get some revenge now, when would she?

“Inconvenient? What, have your monthlies come?” Long Chen spoke randomly without thinking about it. When he realized what had come out of his mouth, he immediately tried to run.

However, Beitang Rushuang’s body suddenly twisted like a cheetah. Long Chen’s vision flashed, and before he could even tell what she was doing, her arm was wrapped around his neck.

This was an alluring move. Of course, this alluring move wasn’t something that just anyone could be blessed with.

The earth shook as Long Chen was smashed into the ground with Beitang Rushuang still clenching his neck. The earth split open, and it was vaguely possible to hear creaking sounds coming from Long Chen’s neck.

The Beitang family’s disciples standing behind Beitang Rushuang shrank back, feeling a chill around their necks. Perhaps others didn’t know about Beitang Rushuang’s moves, but they did. She wasn’t just skilled at long-range attacks; her movements in close-range combat were equally sharp.

This was one of Beitang Rushuang’s best moves. She rarely used it, but anyone she used it on would have their neck snap.

Even Long Chen, with his thick skin, felt a sharp pain from his neck as if it would be pulled off.

Mo Nian jumped in shock. He hadn’t thought that Beitang Rushuang would suddenly become so vicious. If he was struck by this move, he estimated that his head would already be off. As a result, he finally felt some sympathy for Long Chen. Even picking up girls had dangers lying within.

“Long Chen, I’ve endured you for a long time. Do you want to try repeating what you just said?” Beitang Rushuang finally gained a chance to act out against him.

The arm she was using to choke him was the arm she used for pulling back her bowstring. Her muscles were very defined even through the leather.

Long Chen twisted and turned his head, and as a result, it ended up mashed between two tough mountains. He tried to struggle, but his neck was caught, and he was unable to escape.

Beitang Rushuang was completely focused on venting by tightly clenching his neck. She forgot to take this awkward positioning into consideration.

Long Chen kicked and flailed, but Beitang Rushuang refused to allow him to turn. Suddenly, she realized that another group of people had appeared nearby, staring at her oddly. Nangong Zuiyue had arrived.

“Cough, sorry for intruding. We’ll come back another time.” Nangong Zuiyue turned and walked away.

Only then did Beitang Rushuang notice countless experts in the distance staring at her in shock and realize that Long Chen’s face was pressed against her chest.

She immediately flung Long Chen away, and he tumbled across the ground several times before being able to stand.

When he rose, people felt a chill from their spines. Long Chen’s head was now facing his back.

Cracking sounds rang out as Long Chen twisted his head back with his hands. Shaking it a few times, he realized that he had underestimated just how powerful Beitang Rushuang was.

The power she had used was an ancient, mysterious force. If she had wanted to kill him just now, without being prepared, his head might have really been wrung off.

“What are you looking at? Hurry and thank miss Beitang for her nurturing. Oh, I mean, her favor of not killing you!” Mo Nian hastily changed his words when he saw Beitang Rushuang raise her hand to her bow.

“Mo Nian, just you wait.” Long Chen nodded at Mo Nian. He had truly been conned by this fellow today. He would remember this debt.

“Many thanks for showing mercy, miss Beitang,” said Long Chen. “So, Mo Nian, let me introduce you to the peerless fairy Nangong Zuiyue who is as gentle as water.” Pointing at Mo Nian, Long Chen said, “This person is someone who likes robbing tombs and graves. If he can’t beat you, he’ll still annoy you to death. He is mister Mo Nian.”

Mo Nian knew that Long Chen wouldn’t give him a good introduction, so he immediately said, “Fairy Zuiyue, don’t listen to his nonsense. In truth, I am researching the relics of our ancient history and reviving the ancient era’s civilization. My hope is to be a pioneer who can bring back the age of immortals. Although the continent doesn’t really approve of my profession, I am confident that one day, I will be like the sun that blows away the black clouds and let the whole world cheer for me.”

“Do you see that? Rushuang, you said I was the most shameless person in the world, but I refused to accept that. Now do you understand? Just listen to this fellow’s self-introduction. Do you feel like there’s anyone who can compare to him?” Long Chen seemed to have expected Mo Nian’s words and immediately followed up.

“As expected, you’re both more shameless than the other,” said Beitang Rushuang. After encountering Mo Nian, she truly found that bestowing the title of the number one most shameless person in the world to Long Chen had been premature.

Mo Nian wanted to argue some more, but Long Chen didn’t give him a chance. He directly set up a sound barrier for the four of them to talk.

“Miss Zuiyue, I have some things I’d like your advice on. Do you know much about the Corrupt God Cemetery?” Long Chen gave up on asking Beitang Rushuang. Nangong Zuiyue was much gentler, and asking her was safer.

“The Corrupt God Cemetery? Why would you ask about it?” asked Nangong Zuiyue.

“The two of them want to go graverobbing,” interjected Beitang Rushuang. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Nangong Zuiyue looked at the two of them like they were monsters. She wasn’t quite able to wrap her mind around the concept. Rob the Corrupt God’s tomb?

“Fairy Zuiyue, don’t listen to fairy Rushuang. She’s just telling a joke. The truth is that this is all part of a study. Yes, a study to see if there are any ways to further develop ourselves,” said Mo Nian.

Nangong Zuiyue hesitated. “I know a bit, but not as much as fairy Rushuang. You should have fairy Rushuang explain it instead.”

Long Chen knew that this was because Nangong Zuiyue was more meticulous and knew that the two of them might have asked Beitang Rushuang, only to end up in the awkward scenario she had seen when she arrived. If she directly answered, it would make Beitang Rushuang unhappy.

This embodied Nangong Zuiyue’s character. Just like her spiritual yuan attribute, she didn’t like fighting or being conspicuous.

“Then may I ask fairy Rushuang for pointers? I’m listening well.” Long Chen put on a grateful and obedient expression. If he continued messing around, Beitang Rushuang might refuse to say anything, and Nangong Zuiyue would definitely not say much in consideration for her.

Beitang Rushuang almost laughed at Long Chen’s fake obedience. She said, “The Corrupt God Cemetery is the Corrupt path’s greatest support. It is the wellspring of their divine energy. But the most frightening thing is that if they used the Corrupt God’s corpse, this entire world would face a calamity.”
