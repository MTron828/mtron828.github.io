Chapter 4713 Heavenly Desolation Long Clan

The lightning net completely locked the whole area in a cage. As it contracted, some kind of ripples appeared through the void.

The ripples came from the Lifehunter experts striking the lightning net, trying to escape. Too bad that they couldn’t wake up from this nightmare.

The moment their swords touched the lightning net, wild thunderforce poured into them, turning them into exploding fireworks. In the end, not one of them survived.

Seeing that scene, Yue Zifeng sheathed his sword and just stood there indifferently.

“You can come out now. Stop hiding. If you think that you can hide in front of me, you must be dreaming,” declared Long Chen as he lazily rested Evilmoon on his shoulder.

After that, dozens of figures slowly appeared in front of everyone, shocking them.

The Lifehunter race had always been extremely mysterious. Even those who had come from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven had only heard of them but never seen them.

Even though they knew that these people weren’t after them, their phantom-like movement art and untrackable movements still gave them chills.

To say that they weren’t afraid would be a lie. Who would disregard an assassin who could approach them silently?

When those figures appeared, Yue Zifeng shook his head. “How foolish. What a waste of your final chance.”

With swift precision, Yue Zifeng’s sword manifested. His movements were a blur to onlookers, but as his blade sliced through the air, net-like cracks appeared in the void, and hundreds of figures plummeted from the sky.

More experts had been hiding in the void, refusing to believe Long Chen’s words. However, they were instantly slain by Yue Zifeng.

Those dozens of assassins that had revealed themselves all stared apathetically. The deaths of their comrades didn’t seem to affect them in the slightest.

“Stop acting. No matter how you hide it, from your spiritual fluctuations, I can sense your inner fear and your desire to live. In this world, no one can forever be the hunter or the hunted. The roles can shift in an instant. I spared you not because of mercy, but because your lives hold no value to me. Return to your superiors with a message from me.”

Long Chen’s gaze swept over them. “Tell your higher-ups that from the moment you sent someone to assassinate Luo Ning, we were already mortal enemies. You don’t need to send any more scapegoats to test me because I will soon find your headquarters. Tell your higher-ups to wash their dirty necks. I won’t make them wait for long.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen’s voice was neither loud nor domineering. It was as if he was just chatting casually.

However, in this bloody atmosphere with many corpses on the ground, such a casual tone gave the surrounding people a particularly frightening feeling.

“Scram!”

As Long Chen said this, the lightning net vanished. Those Lifehunter experts seemed to be in disbelief as they retreated.

They all vanished without saying a word, as if they were afraid of Long Chen going back on his words.

“Why would they send a group of people to test us? Are they looking down on us?” Yue Zifeng came to Long Chen’s side and frowned.

According to reason, the experts beyond the gate should have seen Long Chen’s prowess. Hence, they should have attacked seriously, not half-assing like this.

When Long Chen and Yue Zifeng first sensed the assassins of the Lifehunter race, they were particularly alarmed precisely because they understood that logic. They had thought that it would be an all-out assault.

“Who knows? Maybe there’s something wrong with their brains, or perhaps they have so many people that they want to cut down their numbers to save on food,” replied Long Chen as he shook his head. He also didn’t understand why they would do such a meaningless probing assault.

Long Chen had let those people off. So, they probably wouldn’t launch another rash attack on the High Firmament Academy in a short time. Instead, they would be preoccupied with devising a strategy to counter Long Chen’s retaliation.

“Dean Long Chen, the Heavenly Province isn’t an entity to be trifled with!” At this time, a Sage King from the crowd walked out.

“Oh? Why not?”

“The Heavenly Province’s power is top tier even in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. No one dares to provoke them. They can come and go as they please, with no one being able to track them. Most importantly, while the rest of us have families and businesses, they are like roving specters; no one knows where their headquarters are. While we have to deal with the attacks of various devil creatures and take heavy losses, they don’t seem to be affected by this. Their numbers constantly grow, and if given enough time, perhaps they will become the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s strongest force. No one within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven is willing to provoke them, as we couldn’t stay alert against them all the time. So, Dean Long Chen, you have provoked a calamity this time,” sighed that elder.

“No wonder they were so arrogant. After their numbers inflated, so did their arrogance. That’s why they dared to so brazenly come to my land.” Long Chen nodded.

“Back then, the Lifehunter race even waged war against the Violet Blood race. They suffered near annihilation, yet today it is the Violet Blood race whose fate remains shrouded in mystery, while the Lifehunter race has established the Heavenly Province and announced that they wished to challenge the violet blood race once more to wipe away the shame of their previous defeat. They must be fully prepared,” the elder proclaimed.

“You said the Violet Blood race’s fate remains shrouded in mystery, right? Does the Sovereign Emperor Heaven not have any clan from the violet blood race?” asked Long Chen.

“Well, we aren’t sure about that either. Ninety percent of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s territory is considered wilderness, and we are all suppressed into tiny areas to grow. Whether there are members of the violet blood race within the wilderness remains a mystery. But it’s unlikely for them to be completely wiped out. After all, the violet blood race is one of the strongest bloodlines of the human race. Also, the Sovereign Emperor Heaven is so enormous, with many impassable regions, so we can’t say for sure exactly how many races exist in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven,” corrected the elder.

Hearing that, Long Chen relaxed. He didn’t give a shit about the Lifehunter race. After all, he had over seven thousand brothers of the Dragonblood Legion. Together with them, Long Chen was not afraid of anyone.

“May I ask where Dean Long Chen is?”

Just then, a white-robed elder adorned with dragon marks on his sleeves and collar approached.

The Sage King's jaw dropped in astonishment at the sight of this white-robed elder.

“The Heavenly Desolation... Long clan?”
