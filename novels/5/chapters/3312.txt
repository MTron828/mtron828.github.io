Chapter 3301 Third Heavenstage of Four Peak

Just now, all his attention had been on the Devil Eye Water Lilies. But as over a hundred black dragon corpses had been tossed into the black soil, the amount of life energy they unleashed was extraordinary. Hence, although the Devil Eye Water Lilies were growing very slowly, the Wood Foundation Divine Trees showed some crazy growth.

Currently, they were three thousand miles tall and several miles thick. Also, their tree bark was now in a scale-like pattern.

He then cut off a small branch the thickness of a thumb and found that even the bone saber couldn’t cut it very easily. The hardness of this single branch was already no different than that of a Treasure item.

The greatest surprise was that every tree now had ninety-nine flower buds. That signified that they had matured and could bear fruit.

However, it was said that the Wood Foundation Divine Trees took three thousand years to flower and three thousand years to bear fruit. Moreover, the fruit would only start to mature after another three thousand years. All in all, it would take nine thousand years from the moment it flowered to the point where the fruit could be consumed.

That was what made the Wood Foundation Divine Trees so precious. Heaven Master Yun Yang’s senior apprentice-sister had obtained one of those fruits. That single fruit then merged with her wood energy and allowed her to awaken her primal bloodline.

There were also four seeds in the pit of that fruit. She had consumed one while keeping three of them. And when Long Chen asked for one, she was willing to give him one, but only one. It could be seen just how precious this fruit was.

Long Chen was delighted to see the flowers. As long as he continued to provide a steady stream of corpses into the primal chaos space, he would be able to obtain countless Wood Foundation Divine Fruit. In fact, he was even thinking about going back to the Vile Dragon Domain and clearing all of Vile Dragon Valley.

If all the vile dragons there were eliminated, that should be enough for the Wood Foundation Divine Fruit to mature. In fact, even the seed pods of the Devil Eye Water Lilies might reach maturity.

Regretfully, the Devil Eye Water Lily was different from other lifeforms. He couldn’t rip out their roots and transplant them to grow more of them. If he wanted more of them, he would need to rely on their seeds.

For now, he couldn’t return to the Vile Dragon Domain. That Devil Eye Water Lily had set its gaze on him. As long as he returned, he would definitely be discovered.

Furthermore, he had a bad feeling about the Vile Dragon Domain, so he was happy to leave it. Before advancing to at least the Divine Lord realm, he didn’t dare to face that terrifying fellow again.

Its terrifying power made him think of Liu Ruyan. The Undying Willow race was the true emperor of the Undying race, and its position was even above the Devil Eye Water Lily. He didn’t know what kind of terrifying divine abilities Liu Ruyan would awaken upon returning to the Undying Willow race’s land. He also didn’t know if this icy, vengeful woman would want to take revenge on him.

It could be said that he had experienced the terror of the Devil Eye Water Lily. Just being able to survive this time was purely thanks to luck. He shouldn’t be so hot-headed in the future.

Having used up all his corpses, all he had left were hundreds of dragon hides, eyes, and cores.

The dragon eyes were also used for refining the Violet Tower Pill, so Long Chen let them by Huo Linger’s side to dry out for the future.

The cores could be sold. They were priceless treasures. As for the hides, he felt a headache when it came to them. None of them were complete. They were full of holes because of the Devil Eye Water Lily. If they weren’t broken, then these hides could be turned into armor, and then even Treasure items would have difficulty leaving a single mark on them.

But with so many holes, their value had sharply dropped. Yet, he was also unwilling to let them be absorbed by the black soil. So, he chose to keep them for now and discuss it with Zheng Wenlong later.

His mind then exited the primal chaos space. The light sound woke up Bai Shishi who was sitting beside him. She opened her beautiful eyes and smiled.

“What? Have you profited? Your smile is so wretched.”

Long Chen was someone whose emotions were written on his face. His mood was very good with the transplant of the Devil Eye Water Lily and the flowering of the Wood Foundation Divine Trees. Even Bai Shishi could see his joy. This fellow looked to be on the verge of dancing in joy, which made Bai Shishi almost giggle. There were many times when Long Chen was just like a large child.

“Is my smile so wretched? You’re going to be smiling even more wretchedly in a bit.”

Long Chen grabbed Bai Shishi’s hand. She immediately turned red and nervously said, “Don’t mess around. It wouldn’t be good to be seen like this.”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and Xu Zixiong were all outside guarding them. If they were to look inside, she would be very embarrassed.

With Long Chen holding her hand, she felt an indescribable nervousness. But she quickly couldn’t even think about being nervous as Long Chen had placed a golden seed in her hand.

The seed still had some blood on it, and it was Long Chen’s. When he had touched this seed, it was as if there were millions of thorns on it, and it left his finger bloody.

In the primal chaos space, this seed was still an obedient child. But as soon as it was outside, it bared its fangs. Its terrifying metal energy was incredibly destructive.

Long Chen hastily put it into Bai Shishi’s hand. Curiously, it immediately went from a raging beast to a cute rabbit in her hand. It actually had such an affinity with her.

“This… this is…!”

Sensing the pulsing metal energy inside, Bai Shishi almost jumped up. She covered her mouth, unable to believe her eyes.

This tiny seed contained endless energy. Furthermore, it was the purest form of metal energy. She could simply absorb it.

“This is one of the five seeds, and it perfectly suits you. Absorb it and you will be the strongest expert amongst us. Ah, let me apologize. I might not have had enough reverence for you before. It was truly rude. I hope that you’ll look after me in the future,” said Long Chen, solemnly bowing.

Bai Shishi laughed. She stared at the golden seed in her hand happily.

“You gave me the golden sword, and now even this seed. I…” Bai Shishi was a bit embarrassed.

“Without your help, there’s no way I could have obtained the seed pod. I’d have even lost my life. We’re all a family, so there’s no need for such courtesy!” said Long Chen.

Hearing that, Bai Shishi reddened. In her ears, those words had another layer of meaning.

However, Long Chen didn’t notice the change in Bai Shishi’s emotions. He was only thinking of how Bai Shishi’s cultivation base was about to soar with this lotus and Four Peak Pills. Her metal energy would grow even stronger, and she even had the golden sword. Now, even Long Chen would stay away from her in a fight.

Suddenly, a muffled sound came from within Long Chen’s body. His aura suddenly rose. His qi, blood, essence, soul, tendons, bones, and every other attribute soared in power. Without even thinking about it, Long Chen had advanced to the third Heavenstage of the Four Peak realm.

Even Bai Shishi jumped when that happened. Long Chen’s advancement came out of nowhere.

“So if I want to digest the medicinal energy faster, I need to fight more. By stimulating my potential, the medicinal energy will be rapidly used up.”

Long Chen’s eyes brightened. He had just entered the second Heavenstage when they entered the Vile Dragon Domain. It had only been a few days, but he had reached the third Heavenstage. It was definitely related to his fight with the Devil Eye Water Lily. Hence, he instantly saw a new cultivation path for him. As expected, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was created for battle. With this, he could rapidly advance. Then his realm wouldn’t be thrown too far behind everyone else.

“Long Chen, shouldn’t we return to the academy and report our findings?” asked Bai Shishi.

“What kind of joke is that? Now that we’ve come out, if we didn’t take advantage and do something big, how could we have the face to return? Come. Brother will bring you to travel the world,” laughed Long Chen.
