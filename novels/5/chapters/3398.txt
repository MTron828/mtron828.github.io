Wu Tian laughed. Seeing Long Chen’s embarrassment, he immediately ordered people to set the table again with food and drink.

“Good brother, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Men like us should simply follow our heart’s desire instead of hiding it within the night. I like that character of yours because I have the same kind of temper. Just drink some more wine. This wine was brewed by the Dark Underworld Spirit Monkey race. It’s been in the wine cellar for thirty million years now. Back then, it was that group of monkeys that conned me. Now I’ve wiped out their entire race. Those monkeys might be hateful, but at least their winemaking ability isn’t bad. After wiping them out, I found their wine stash, and I’ve never shared it with anyone until now. Have a good taste of it. It might not have a good taste in the mouth, but it’s actually quite good for the body, especially for the current you. It will solidify your foundation and cause a noticeable improvement in your soul. Moreover, this wine contains the laws of the Netherworld. You’ve been cultivating in the Netherworld for a while, and you can already borrow a portion of the Netherworld’s Heavenly Daos’ power. So, after drinking this wine, you will grow even closer to the Netherworld’s laws. Perhaps one day you can also control the power of the Netherworld’s laws,” said Wu Tian. He personally poured more wine for Long Chen.

This time, Long Chen received it with both hands. He hadn’t expected Wu Tian to care so much about him. He was quite protective, making Long Chen feel very moved.

“Alright, then junior brother will cherish big brother’s wine.” Long Chen didn’t say any superfluous words. Just with their brief interaction, he already knew what kind of character Wu Tian had.

“Hahaha, good, good brother!” Wu Tian laughed and raised his own bowl, drinking it all.

This time, Long Chen was prepared. Although he almost choked, he was able to keep this wine down. Sensing it carefully this time, he found that the wine was like medicinal liquor. It spread throughout every inch of his body, and he felt the repulsion of the Netherworld’s laws weaken around him.

Although Leng Yueyan had helped him get accustomed to the aura of the Netherworld, that was mostly in their area. Now, he was closer to the core of the Netherworld. As he wasn’t a lifeform of the Netherworld, there was naturally a rejection. The Heavenly Daos here wouldn’t help him or allow him to use them. Just the fact that they didn’t work against him was all thanks to Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s blessing.

In this place, Long Chen could clearly feel the Heavenly Daos starting to suppress him. The laws here were different from where Leng Yueyan was. However, after drinking two bowls of wine, he felt the Heavenly Daos grow closer to him. Perhaps just as Wu Tian said, one day Long Chen might be able to control the power of the Netherworld as well.

If that really was the case, in the future, when Netherworld experts invaded the immortal world, Long Chen would have the power of both worlds to fight against them. Then wouldn’t he be able to beat those invaders like beating children?

By the time he drank his third bowl, his expression didn’t even change. Although some of the wine energy did try to surge out of him, Long Chen had plenty of experience with drinking wine. On the Martial Heaven Continent, he had always been drinking the wine of the Wine God Palace, so he had quite the capacity for liquor. However, this wine was simply truly powerful.

“Eat some food first,” said Wu Tian when he saw Long Chen starting to become overwhelmed by the wine.

The foods on the table were the greatest delicacies of the Netherworld. However, Long Chen didn’t even taste them. His mouth was full of the flavor of the wine.

“Big brother, can you tell me how you ended up trapped in that forsaken place?” asked Long Chen. After being a bit overwhelmed by this wine, he didn’t have any restraints and directly got to the point.

“Fuck, just thinking about it enrages me! My Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast is the emperor race of the Netherworld. When a battle erupted in the Netherworld, we were betrayed by a group of bastards, and their sneak attack caused us to collapse. That battle relates to the secrets of the nine heavens and ten lands, so I can’t tell you about it. The karma is truly enormous and will harm you. But in that battle, our members were captured and imprisoned. That’s because we have undying bodies. Even if our bodies and souls are erased, we will be reborn with our memories of that life. Hence, even though we were defeated, they had to imprison us, not kill us. At that time, I was very young. My cultivation base was even lower than your current realm. After being captured, I was sealed inside a plane of the Netherpassage world. I was there first, and only afterward did that plane arise. Over trillions of years, I watched as worlds were destroyed and reborn, and then destroyed and reborn again. I don’t know how many cycles I saw. That pack of fools thought that sealing me this way would stop my cultivation base from progressing, but as I witnessed the laws of the world work, despite not being able to move, I was able to use one of my divine arts. Although my cultivation speed was slow, I was still capable of cultivating. However, the seal could not be broken from inside. No matter how great my power grew, I couldn’t break free. So you really helped me out. Originally, I owed you a great debt. But since we’re brothers, we’re not going to talk about such a thing. Drink!”

Seeing that Long Chen had gotten a bit more accustomed to this wine, Wu Tian poured more wine into their bowls and drank.

“Big brother, you really are amazing. If I was trapped for so long, I’d have gone insane. Even if I didn’t go crazy, I’d definitely be consumed by killing intent and other negative emotions. There’s no way I could be like big brother,” praised Long Chen.

If Long Chen was trapped like that and one day did escape, he would go on a crazy slaughter. He would definitely be consumed by vengeance and turn into a homicidal, wild devil. There was no way he could have Wu Tian’s current suave ease.

“Do you know why I tested you in front of the city?” asked Wu Tian.

Long Chen shook his head. Wu Tian once more filled their wine bowls. When Long Chen tried to reach out to the wine pot, he was stopped by Wu Tian. He personally poured their wine.

“My Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race possesses a noble bloodline. We don’t like owing others, so I did everything to find you just to return this favor. This is my race’s pride. When you received the pressure of my will, that was my innate divine ability. It allowed me to deduce your future accomplishments. If your life wasn’t tough enough, then at most, I would only help you once. Once your heart’s desire was achieved, this favor would be returned, and we would not be brothers. If your life was not tough enough, being brothers with me would implicate you badly. To repay someone’s favor with calamity is definitely not a thing my race would do,” said Wu Tian.

“Then big brother, can you tell what realm my cultivation base can reach in the future?” asked Long Chen excitedly. If he had obtained Wu Tian’s approval from that test, then it meant that he had to have a terrifying potential for growth.

Wu Tian shook his head. “Normally, under the pressure of this divine ability, when others resist, there is a flexibility, an elasticity that allows me to judge a person’s upper cultivation limit. But you had no such thing. You resisted with pure brute power without the slightest flexibility, a determination to rather break than bend. I didn’t dare to push you any further, so I couldn’t see your future. But I really do like this character of yours. We two brothers have many similarities, just like real brothers. That destructive power deep within your soul makes me feel particularly close to you. So who cares a damn about karma? I don’t! If you die, then big brother will simply get revenge for you!”

Wu Tian smiled. He grew more and more fond of this new brother of his. It was like he regretted not meeting Long Chen earlier. He suddenly laughed. “Brother, I have a gift for you.”

Wu Tian clapped his hands, and over ten large figures walked into the palace.
