Chapter 2560 The Heavens Weep

“Old bitch, do you want to continue? Why aren’t you attacking?”

Long Chen was holding a golden foot-tall miniature human. It was Zhao Ritian.

Zhao Ritian was covered in runes. This was a formation that Xia Chen had set up to prevent him from escaping.

Seeing Long Chen covered in blood, the rest of the Dragonblood Legion immediately charged over. They then stood behind Long Chen, facing the old woman.

Just at this moment, Ye Liangchen finally escaped his restrictions. The sea of flames vanished and Huo Linger also appeared behind Long Chen.

Ye Liangchen was ashen. He had been trapped for a long time. Moreover, Huo Linger’s attacks were too difficult to deal with. Hundreds of different attacks had come at him with every blink of an eye, so he hadn’t even had a chance to breathe.

He had sensed Huo Linger’s power starting to drop and had been preparing to break free when Huo Linger suddenly released him of her own accord.

That was essentially announcing to everyone that he hadn’t been able to do anything to Huo Linger. He was actually defeated by a simple housepet of Long Chen’s.

Killing intent blazed in his eyes. However, after seeing the old woman, he didn’t say anything. That was because this old woman was the current head of the Zhao family.

The seniors of the divine families had not been intending on interfering this time. They were leaving things to the junior generation. Most likely, the Zhao family head had furiously charged over upon learning that Zhao Ritian had been captured. In her fury, she didn’t care about status or seniority.

Long Chen was now holding Zhao Ritian in front of her. A sneer appeared on his face. “Come over and test me. I’ll immediately crush Zhao Ritian. I’ve never spoken any empty threats in this lifetime. If you don’t believe it, you are welcome to try it.”

The old woman was startled, infuriated, and aggrieved to see the listless Zhao Ritian. She shouted, “Release him immediately!”

“Do you think I’m an idiot? Why would I release him?” Long Chen looked at her contemptuously. Although he didn’t know her status, based on her care for Zhao Ritian, she was definitely one of his ancestors.

The last two attacks had caused cracks to appear in Long Chen’s bones. Most terrifying of all was that this woman was capable of reflecting a portion of Long Chen’s power to further injure him.

Long Chen wasn’t afraid of anyone, but this old woman made him feel a sense of profound powerlessness. Her realm was far higher than his. Compared to the Heaven Merging sea demons he had killed, the difference was like heaven and earth.

Furthermore, her teleportation art came without the slightest warning. If it weren’t for the sharp senses of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he might not have been able to stop even the first attack.

To fight against such a terrifying opponent head-on was definitely not wise. His arrogance had not reached the point of thinking that he was unrivaled beneath the heavens.

“If something happens to Zhao Ritian, I swear that you and your people will all suffer endless torment. Even death will become extremely luxurious for you.” The old woman glared at Long Chen with rancor.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen raised his head and laughed. That laughter was filled with fury. As expected, the divine families, from top to bottom, only knew how to threaten people. It was as if they truly felt that they were gods, and any defiance was blasphemy.

“Long Chen, release me and you can still live!” shouted Zhao Ritian.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen continued to laugh, however, his wild laughter suddenly became filled with killing intent. That sharp killing intent caused the world to change color.

“Not good. This is a premonition of…”

People looked up to see that the sky had turned gloomy. Faint drops of rain were starting to fall, and the sound of the rain was like crying. A mournful feeling appeared in the air.

“The heavens weep,” Daoist Heavenly Feather muttered.

BOOM!

Long Chen clenched his hand and Zhao Ritian exploded. In that instant, the world turned dark. Time seemed to stand still.

Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, Jiang Wuchen, and Feng Fei were all dumbfounded. Long Chen really had killed Zhao Ritian.

Golden specks of light shot out like a firework. After one brilliant explosion, they faded away. Zhao Ritian’s aura had vanished without a trace.

“He died…”

Whether it was the people from Pill Valley, the ancient family alliance, the sea demon race, or the Corrupt path, allied powers like the Martial Heaven Alliance, or neutral powers, they were all stunned. They had never imagined that Long Chen would kill one of the divine families’ Sovereign sprouts.

They had assumed that Long Chen would use Zhao Ritian as a trump card to keep himself alive. He could then use him to blackmail the divine families, making them afraid of making a move on his people.

At the very least, he could make the divine families swear a poisonous oath to no longer offend him. Then both sides could leave things behind peacefully.

However, this trump card was now shattered in front of everyone.

Rain poured down and a feeling of mourning filled the world. The heavens were weeping. Legend was that these people were the children of the heavens, the ones adored above all others. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Their deaths would cause the heavens to weep. Such a thing previously only existed in legend. But now it appeared before them.

Furthermore, they could clearly sense that the weeping of the heavens had started before Long Chen killed Zhao Ritian. It had started as soon as the old woman had threatened Long Chen.

In other words, her words had set Zhao Ritian’s death in stone. The heavens had realized what would happen and started weeping.

The old woman simply stared in dumbfounded silence as the golden specks of light faded away. It was only after several breaths that she let out a mournful shriek. “I’ll make all of you pay with your lives!”

The old woman was so enraged that she went crazy. She had never dreamed that Long Chen would dare to kill Zhao Ritian.

The Dragonblood warriors summoned their manifestations. Even if they were facing a terrifying Heaven Merging expert, they didn’t feel the slightest fear.

They knew that this battle might end with all of them wiped out. But on the day that they set foot into the cultivation world, they had accepted that death would come sooner or later.

The divine families’ arrogance had long since infuriated them. Moreover, Zhao Ritian had caused the deaths of over ten Dragonblood warriors and hundreds of thousands of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples.

By the same token, this old woman didn’t care about right or wrong. She was simply trying to use her superior position to order them around. She had even used their lives to threaten Long Chen, and that was unacceptable to them.

When Long Chen crushed Zhao Ritian, all the Dragonblood warriors felt like shouting. This was their boss. Even if they had to die together, they wouldn’t endure this kind of humiliation.

“Go all-out against this bitch!”

It was unknown who shouted this amongst the Martial Heaven Alliance, but hundreds of thousands of their disciples also came to stand behind the Dragonblood Legion.

Not one of the Xuan Beasts retreated. Moreover, the Nangong family, the Beitang family, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, and the Mo Gate all stood behind the Dragonblood Legion.

Even if they were facing a supreme expert of the divine families, these juniors did not retreat in fear. They would fight to the death with Long Chen.

Of almost a million disciples, not one retreated. This scene stunned everyone.

“Do you think numbers can make it impossible for me to punish you? Since you all want to die, you can die!” shouted the old woman.

“Jianying, prepare the tablet!” shouted the old man.

Qu Jianying nodded and took out the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet. But just at this moment, Daoist Heavenly Feather stepped forward lightly, suddenly vanishing from sight.

Everyone let out startled cries upon seeing Daoist Heavenly Feather appear in front of the old woman, blocking her path.

“Han Zhiqiu, don’t meddle in other people’s business!” barked the old woman.

“Han Zhiqiu?” The Dragonblood warriors were startled and looked at Ye Zhiqiu. They had the same name?

Ye Zhiqiu was also startled. She had never heard the true name of Daoist Heavenly Feather. She had never told her.

For the old woman to state her name meant that the two of them had to know each other. This startled everyone even more. It seemed that Daoist Heavenly Feather’s status was even more mysterious than they had expected.

“No, this is not meddling. The Divine Ice Palace is a protector of the Martial Heaven Continent. We have our own mission and responsibility to protect the continent’s peace, and we will fight to the death for the continent. Although I don’t want to be enemies with you, you are bullying the juniors and trying to slaughter the pillars of the future. Since that’s the case, I can only fight to the death with you,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“Bullshit! Long Chen just killed a Sovereign sprout, bringing forth the weeping of the heavens! There is no way to wipe away his sins! You call him a pillar? Who can compare to a Sovereign sprout when it comes to being a future pillar? Long Chen despicably killed Zhao Ritian, and I want vengeance for my disciple. Scram, or I’ll kill you with them!” barked the old woman.

Daoist Heavenly Feather. “All things have karma. Although I don’t know why Long Chen killed Zhao Ritian, I believe he had his reasons. If you have the patience, we can let Long Chen tell everyone about the karma involved. Then everyone will know who is right and who is wrong. If Long Chen truly is recklessly slaughtering heavenly geniuses, I, Daoist Heavenly Feather, will be the first to kill him. How is that?”

Everyone was sweating for Daoist Heavenly Feather. She was currently facing a terrifying existence, one capable of tearing through the void to move. They were afraid the old woman would harm her.

However, it seemed from their words that the old woman was actually a bit restrained by Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“Who has that patience? All I know is that he killed Zhao Ritian, so he has to pay with his life. I don’t care about the karma between them. I want them, dead, dead, all of them dead! Do you understand now? Get out of the way!” shouted the old woman. At some point, her face and hands became covered in black spots that were like tiny eyes. It was like devils were staring out of her.

Daoist Heavenly Feather shook her head and sighed. She extended a hand.

“Zhiqiu, hand over your sword.”
