Chapter 3322 Mo Yan Retreats?

“Does this fellow not know how to hold back?!” Seeing Long Chen recklessly absorbing all those rainbow hydrangeas, Bai Shishi was speechless. Was he intentionally making a target of himself? It was far too early.

As Long Chen’s sea of flowers continued to grow, no one was willing to just watch as he did this. He was practically cheating.

Actually, Long Chen had his own secret troubles with absorbing these rainbow hydrangeas so brazenly. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had said that he had no destiny with the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, which made it difficult for him to obtain.

If he wanted to obtain it, he had to do something shocking, something big. Otherwise, all his work would be for nothing. Even if he had to make a target of himself, there was nothing else he could do.

“Despicable human race, if I wasn’t restricted by the laws here, would you be able to receive a single blow from me?!” roared Mo Yan furiously. He seemed to have gone insane.

The spatial gate behind him had been fully opened and devil qi gushed out of it. He needed enough devil qi from it in order to unleash his power.

From his tone, it seemed that he was unable to unleash much of his power due to the suppression of the laws here, which was why he was so suffocated.

“Tch, so you’re going to make excuses for yourself after saying so many big words? You can’t take them back. You’re going to blame everyone but yourself? I really look down on you,” Long Chen curled his lips disdainfully.

“If you have guts, then come fight me in the devil world!” roared Mo Yan.

“Since you dared to come to the immortal world so arrogantly, I don’t believe that you didn’t come prepared. What, after being slapped in the face, you have to find excuses for yourself? Is one of those excuses something like you’re constipated?” asked Long Chen disdainfully.

“You’re really pissing me off!” Mo Yan raised his head and roared. His furious appearance shocked people. Even the spectators were stunned by this reaction. A heavenly genius from the Mo Ke race, possessing the devil race’s imperial bloodline, was actually angered to this extent.

“Keep acting. You’re roaring so much but not attacking. Isn’t that because you want more of the devil world’s aura to enter the immortal world? At that time, you’ll be able to unleash a bit more power. But do you really think that you would be able to beat me then? It’s a nice plan. By stalling for time, you can accumulate more power, and the more rainbow hydrangeas that I absorb, the more others will grow impatient. Then you can attack me together, saving yourself quite some effort. When the Heavenly Rainbow Flame appears, you can unleash your surprising new power. That’s the real competition. Little fellow, your scheming isn’t bad.” Long Chen smiled indifferently.

When Long Chen said this, everyone was shocked. Long Chen’s vision was quite sharp. It truly seemed that this was the most advantageous plan for Mo Yan.

If that really was the case, then it meant that Mo Yan was regretting being the first one to challenge Long Chen. Now, he was caught in a tough situation.

Although he appeared wild with fury, he hadn’t lost his mind. His ultimate goal was still the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, so he didn’t want to fully reveal all his trump cards right now. If he did, he would be lacking the power to compete for the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. Then he would have helped others for no reason. Even if he did kill Long Chen, it wouldn’t be worth it.

Everyone then looked at Long Chen with approval. Even some old foxes that had lived for countless years were unable to so quickly see through the truth.

Within a battle of this scale, Long Chen was able to maintain absolute calmness and deduce the truth smartly. Just this one point was something not many people were capable of.

However, the truth was that they had overestimated him. How could Long Chen even have the desire to analyze this? It was simply that he had experienced the schemes and treachery of so many people that he instantly knew Mo Yan was faking his anger, and why he would do such a thing. It was simply experience.

At the same time as they felt admiration for Long Chen, they were even more shocked inside. If Long Chen’s words were true, then that entire battle just now could only be considered probing blows.

Mo Yan had found that his expectations were wrong, and defeating Long Chen was not going to be as simple as he thought. That was why he was playing around with such a scheme.

In other words, it meant that Mo Yan’s true trump cards hadn’t appeared yet. He wanted to borrow everyone’s power to beat Long Chen while he conserved his power.

Even a battle of this level was still not their full power. That made people’s jaws drop, especially those heavenly geniuses who had given up after being repeatedly blasted out of the barrier by the qi waves of their battle. They had an urge to simply kill themselves. The difference between them and Long Chen was even greater than they had imagined.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Mo Yan stopped his roaring, and icy killing intent burned in his eyes. He was going crazy with rage. All his thoughts were read by Long Chen, making him appear as foolish as a child.

“What are you looking at me for? Come at me if you want. Have you forgotten how I slapped your face just now? If you’re a man, come for revenge!” Long Chen sloppily looked at Mo Yan, the very picture of someone who needed a beating.

“Mo Yan, you wouldn’t really be afraid, right? Didn’t you say that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would belong to your devil race? What? Are you going to give up after being slapped? Hehe, I suppose that’s interesting as well. The great Mo Ke race is actually just a scary paper tiger,” laughed the Netherworld expert that had opened his own spatial gate. He made sure to throw stones at Mo Yan while he was down.

“What a slap in the face. The Mo Ke race is no more than this. You should just leave. Leave your vengeance against him to me. I won’t need your Mo Ke race to return the favor either,” said Kun Wu of the Feather race, also intentionally provoking Mo Yan.

“The Mo Ke race’s face has been lost by you. You’re still hesitating at such a time? Are you sure that you have the blood of the Mo Ke race in your veins?” said another expert. This one was humanoid but had a pair of golden eyes that blazed like suns. When he closed and opened them, lightning flickered. This was a terrifying lifeform of unknown origins.

All of these lifeforms possessed their own powerful origins, and they weren’t afraid of the Mo Ke race. Thus, they all started mocking Mo Yan.

Mo Yan laughed furiously. “Are you trying to scheme against me? Once I kill Long Chen, you’ll all benefit. Did you think that your little tricks would work against me? You’re too naive.”

“Whether or not we’re naive isn’t the point. The main thing is that you really are gutless. After being slapped by a human, you’re not even fighting back. Hopefully, this matter doesn’t reach the Mo Ke race’s ears, or they might just slaughter you for the race’s honor,” mocked someone.

“Hahaha, the more you mock me, the more I know not to fall for it. Today, I’m not going to fight. If you want to just watch, then I’ll watch too. You can just let Long Chen absorb the rainbow hydrangeas! We’ll see just who is afraid of who!” Mo Yan actually retreated from the battle. He then sat on top of the devil world’s spatial gate, seemingly intent on not fighting. Now it was a competition to see who would run out of patience first. Everyone was left dumbfounded.
