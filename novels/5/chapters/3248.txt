Chapter 3237 Bone Blade Flame Devil

This lifeform was three hundred meters tall and had a pair of bull horns. Its head was a cross between a horse and a donkey, and it had four limbs and a long tail.

Moreover, its body was wrapped in flames, and those flames ignited this world, turning the Chu family’s land into a sea of fire.

It let out a heaven-shaking roar, which shook the world and tore the earth asunder. The power of a King shook people’s souls.

“Changwu, bring Long Chen away! I’ll buy you some time!” shouted Luo Changwen. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Just a single Chu Yingxiong was already hard enough for them to deal with. With the addition of this terrifying lifeform, they could only flee.

“Do you think you can get away? You should know that this is a gift I prepared for Luo Zichuan. Since he hasn’t come, I’ll give it to you instead.” Chu Yingxiong laughed.

BOOM!

Finally, Long Chen was unable to hold on. The flame chains shattered and the pill furnace returned to Chu Yingxiong’s grasp. From start to end, the primal chaos space refused to help Long Chen.

“Long Chen, run away to the High Firmament Academy. I’ll stall for you,” said Luo Changwen to Long Chen when he retreated to their side.

“That is a lifeform from hell. It’s not human, so there’s nothing to fear. The most important thing is for everyone to work together and kill Chu Yingxiong.” Long Chen eyed that giant lifeform. He recognized it as a Bone Blade Flame Devil from the Netherworld.

In his days with Ming Cangyue in the Netherworld, due to their bodies being one, their souls touched, Long Chen knew quite a few secrets of the Netherworld.

This Bone Blade Flame Devil was a lifeform from the Netherworld. But upon entering the immortal world, it would be suppressed by the laws here. Although it could control flame energy, it slanted more toward power. Its flame energy was terrifying, but it didn’t know how to use it much. Hence, it couldn’t count as a terrifying existence to Long Chen. The most thorny opponent here was still Chu Yingxiong.

Just then, Chu Yingxiong retreated with the pill furnace, hiding behind the Bone Blade Flame Devil. He then pressed his hand against the altar, and one lifeform after another came out of the gate.

“Fuck…”

When Long Chen saw eight different lifeforms from the Netherworld appear out of the gate, his scalp turned numb.

A single Netherworld creature at the Immortal King realm could still be slain with technique. But eight? What kind of technique could be used against them?

“In order to kill Long Chen and wipe out the Luo family, my Chu family has worked hard. We’ve exhausted all the resources we had accumulated for so long. Adding on the resources from the Bloodkill Hall, you can die happily.” Chu Yingxiong laughed, feeling very pleased. “No matter what scheme you have, no matter what technique Luo Zichuan has, it’s all useless. After killing you, I’ll send these lifeforms to destroy the Luo family and everyone inside it.”

Long Chen cursed his luck. This was crazy. There was no other way, so at this moment, the Three Flower Pupil appeared in his left eye. He needed to use the power of the Purgatory Eyes again. In the worst case, he would become a one-eyed person for a few more months.

“Hahaha, patiently await your deaths!” laughed Chu Yingxiong.

Just then, the gate rumbled as if a hammer had struck it. Chu Yingxiong’s laughter was cut off, and he was stunned. This altar should have summoned only eight of those lifeforms.

In truth, of the five altars, four were fake. When the other altars were broken, their energy flowed into this final altar.

This was the trap that Chu Yingxiong had set up. If the Luo family noticed something and suddenly attacked, they would break the altars. It went without saying that his planning was very meticulous. He always had backup plans.

However, according to the Bloodkill Hall, these ancient altars were a kind of contractual summons. They only had eight contractual runes, meaning they could only summon eight lifeforms from the Netherworld.

This contract was like hiring mercenaries. After paying them with their sacrifices, those mercenaries would have to help them out.

This contract also had a time limit. After two hours, the contract would end, and they would be pulled back into the Netherworld.

However, all eight of them had appeared. Why was another lifeform striking the spatial gate?

BOOM!

The spatial gate exploded. After that, a pair of giant hands clawed at the void, tearing the sky apart. A humanoid lifeform with a pair of giant wings then appeared.

This lifeform was far larger than the Bone Blade Flame Devils, which only reached its knees. Its body was covered by scales, and there was a vertical eye on its forehead.

A terrifying aura instantly crashed down on everyone. The Bone Blade Flame Devils were previously roaring arrogantly, but as soon as this lifeform appeared, they didn’t dare to move. They even began to quiver.

Chu Yingxiong was delighted. He hadn’t expected such a surprise. He had actually summoned such a terrifying lifeform.

“Kill them!” shouted Chu Yingxiong.

However, the Bone Blade Flame Devils simply quivered and knelt on the ground.

As for that final lifeform, it didn’t even look at Chu Yingxiong. Instead, its gaze turned toward Long Chen.

“You are Long Chen?”

This lifeform actually spat out human words. Its voice was loud, like a divine drum being struck. It was so loud it felt like people’s souls would scatter.

Luo Changwu, Luo Changwen, and the others jumped in shock. This lifeform from the Netherworld actually recognized Long Chen?

Even Long Chen himself was shocked. He nodded.

“Yes. I am Long Chen.”

“Good. The Heavenly King mentioned your name before. He had received a favor from you, so he asked us not to make things hard on you. I didn’t expect to run into you here though. What a surprise.” The giant lifeform actually sat down and grabbed one of the quivering Bone Blade Flame Devils. It bit off half of its head.

That Bone Blade Flame Devil continued to quiver, but curiously, it didn’t even dare to make a sound.

Only a crunching sound rang out as the giant lifeform bit into the rest of the head. It was like he was eating a carrot. Luo Changwu, Luo Changwen, and the others felt a chill. They had never seen such a terrifying lifeform before.

Even now, the other Bone Blade Flame Devils didn’t run. They continued to kneel, as if simply waiting to be eaten.

The lifeform looked at Long Chen curiously. “No one can defy the Heavenly King’s orders. But I’m curious, how did a weak fellow like you end up doing a favor for the Heavenly King?

Heavenly King? Long Chen had no idea who that was. But suddenly, a memory flashed in his head, and he shook.

“Is it that thing?”
