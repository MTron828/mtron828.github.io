Chapter 3051 The Rainbow Crane Race’s Gift

Upon hearing this, Heaven Master Yun Yang and the others’ expressions changed. Long Chen, Xu Changchuan, and Bai Shishi were their main force in the Nine Prefecture Convention. They could not be fighting amongst themselves.

“I’m not interested.” Long Chen shook his head.

“As an expert, you must face challenges. If you’re such a coward, how are you qualified to pursue fairy Shishi?” demanded Xu Changchuan.

Long Chen scoffed. “How laughable. Who said that I’m pursuing Bai Shishi? And does pursuing someone require qualifications? Well, whatever. I won’t argue with a child. I’ve grown past that competitive age. It would be best if you didn’t provoke me because I’m very busy.”

Long Chen waved his hand, and ignoring everyone else, he lowered his head and started sweeping once more.

“Are you looking down on me?!” shouted Xu Changchuang.

Long Chen didn’t raise his head or even look at him. He just continued sweeping with his head down. Seeing this, Xu Changchuan clenched his fists, and his manifestation quivered.

However, he had his own pride. If Long Chen didn’t want to fight with him, he wouldn’t force it.

“Long Chen, there will be a battle between us sooner or later. Just wait.” He snorted and left.

Watching him leave, Heaven Master Yun Yang sighed. He also led his group away. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Everyone else was gone, but Long Chen continued slowly sweeping. When the leaves were piled together, a light breeze blew by, scattering the leaves. All his previous efforts were wasted.

Long Chen stared for a moment before a smile slowly came across his face. Just at this moment, the sweeping elder returned.

“How do you feel?” he asked.

Long Chen gratefully said, “Many thanks for your pointers, senior. I feel excellent. To not judge based on results, to not decide success or failure… The Heavenly Daos are fair. As long as you work hard, you will definitely have gains. However, sometimes those gains are visible, and sometimes they’re not. I also understand that what I see before me is not necessarily true. Just because I can’t see something doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. A single broom could sweep away the dust in front of me and let me see a new world. I will remember the kindness of this pointer.”

Having his progress interrupted midway had infuriated him. It felt like all his work was for nothing. That feeling was terrible.

However, now he had a new feeling. Even if something ultimately failed, it didn’t mean that there were no gains.

Long Chen’s mental state had been enlightened to a far wider view, so the shadow of his defeat on the Martial Heaven Continent also dissipated. He finally walked free from that shadow.

In that battle, many people had died and the Martial Heaven Continent itself was destroyed. But ultimately, most of them lived. He had accomplished what the Martial Heaven Continent entrusted to him.

Furthermore, through that battle, he also recognized the areas he was lacking in. Thus, in life, there were also gains and losses. If you gained something, you also lost something. In the same vein, if you lost something, you also gained something. If you spent all day mired in thoughts of what you lost, that would be the greatest foolishness.

“A pointer? No, this is no pointer. That is because if right and wrong cannot be determined, who would be so presumptuous as to talk about pointers?”

The elder shook his head. He received his broom back and once more started sweeping.

“Right and wrong, good and evil, is there a line separating them? If there is, who decides that? Is that person definitely right? Did that person make that line with a bias toward themself and their own actions? If there are rules, then there will be holes. If there are no rules, then chaos reigns. Where did everything come from then? Life, the Daos, the laws of the world? Perhaps only the ruler could say. Have you thought about being the ruler?”

“Senior…”

Long Chen was startled. The elder’s words seemed to contain some mystery behind them. It was as if he was passing on something to Long Chen. But after he said this, he vanished.

It was as if he was speaking to both Long Chen and himself, befuddling Long Chen.

His words seemed to relate to an even higher level secret. Long Chen didn’t know if this counted as a subtle warning.

After pondering it for a long time, he was still unable to figure out the elder’s intentions. According to the elder, there was no such thing as right or wrong in this world. There were only different viewpoints.

“Big brother Long Chen…”

Just as Long Chen was in thought, a young voice rang out and woke him from his stupor. Rainbow light flew around him. At this moment, a rainbow crane appeared in front of him.

The rainbow crane then transformed into a young girl. Her beautiful eyes were like stars in the night sky. Seeing Long Chen, she smiled so excitedly that her eyes became crescent moons.

“Big brother, I came to find you!” This girl was a transformation of the rainbow crane. He had seen her before at the gates to the inner academy. It was the girl who called him a good person.

However, today, it was just her. Her companions weren’t there, so she immediately hugged him.

Long Chen’s inner heart was originally a bit heavy due to the elder’s final words. However, this girl’s smile infected him. Something beautiful could make a person forget all their vexations.

The girl grew even happier when Long Chen hugged back. Hearing her tinkling laughter, Long Chen felt his entire body relax.

“Big brother, let me tell you, that grandpa is really amazing!” The girl whispered into Long Chen’s ear.

“The sweeping grandpa?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes! Our rainbow crane race lives a long time. From the time when I was born until now, I already saw three generations of deans leave. But that sweeping grandpa has seen nine generations of our race. When our first generation patriarch arrived here, that grandpa was already sweeping the ground,” whispered the girl as if she didn’t want anyone else to hear.

Long Chen was shocked. Although he had felt this sweeping elder to not be ordinary, he had never expected him to have lived for so long. The elder was practically a living fossil.

This girl had seen three generations of deans. But the sweeping elder had seen nine generations of the rainbow crane race? Long Chen didn’t dare to even think of how old this sweeping elder was.

“Ah… My mom is calling me back. It’s over. I definitely said too much…” The girl’s expression suddenly fell.

Long Chen didn’t know what had happened. He also didn’t know how to console her, so he just looked at her.

She suddenly extended a hand, and a feather appeared. It was black and white, and yet rainbow light shone around it.

“My mom told me to give this to you. She said it might be useful to you. Big brother, I have to go. Next time, I’ll come to find you to play!” The girl reluctantly waved goodbye to Long Chen. She transformed back into a rainbow crane and flew away.

“Original true feather!”

When Long Chen looked at the feather she had left in his hand, his whole body shook.
