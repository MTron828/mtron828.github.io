Chapter 3372 Easily Subdued

At this moment, Tuo Ming realized that he had fallen completely for Long Chen’s scheme. When Long Chen invited them to a one-against-one, it was to con one of them to death before facing the last one.

He felt immense regret at this moment. He had actually thought himself smart, thinking that Long Chen had no way out and could only come up with such a desperate plan to leave both sides with nothing. He had even wanted to con Long Chen.

The arrows rained down. Even their armor was useless to protect them from these sharp arrows. The arrows could pierce the bodies of several experts before running out of energy.

“Attack the city!”

Tuo Ming quickly shouted. He knew that if he retreated now, they would only be live targets for these archers. Furthermore, once they retreated, the army within the city would also flood out.

Once they retreated, their morale would plummet and they would be disorganized. Without the will to fight, they would collapse rapidly. Only a small portion of them would survive. If that was the case, it was better to go all-out and attack the city.

He believed that the city’s grand formation had only recovered to at most fifty percent power after two days of recovery. With so many people attacking, it would definitely fall in less than an incense stick’s worth of time. They had more people. Even if he had to use all their lives, he would still have a shot at victory.

“Kill!”

Tuo Ming roared and charged at the city. His target was the grand formation. Once the formation was broken, his people would flood the city, and the arrows would no longer have a use. If he broke into the city, he would win.

BOOM!

Two bone swords crossed, sealing the world around him. After that, two slender figures appeared, blocking his path. In a clash of three gods, Tuo Ming was sent flying.

“This battlefield will be your burial ground,” snorted Leng Yueyan. Like a flicker of black lightning, she shot at Tuo Ming. Her sharp sword slashed toward his head.

Tuo Ming was shocked. Combined, both of them were incredibly powerful. He suddenly had a bad feeling.

Just as he was about to block Leng Yueyan’s sword, his expression completely changed. He felt a cold chill in his ribs. Ming Cangyue had silently appeared to his left like a flitting butterfly, her bone sword piercing his side like a fiend’s fang.

The two of them cooperated seamlessly. Feeling shocked, Tuo Ming raised his arm. Then a circular shield appeared on it. At the same time, the spear in his right hand smashed toward Leng Yueyan.

He managed to stop Ming Cangyue’s bone sword from further wounding him. But Leng Yueyan’s sword slashed his neck, leaving a large opening in his blood-colored armor. His fresh blood flowed out. If it hadn’t been for his armor, his head might have flown off.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“How can you be so distracted? You are playing with your life,” sneered Leng Yueyan. She and Ming Cangyue were both two separate beings and one whole existence. They could share their thoughts. When one person attacked, the other instantly knew how to cooperate perfectly. Their combination was flawless.

Tuo Ming had actually launched a forceful attack on them without even realizing this. He viewed them as twins, without being aware that they were far more terrifying than he gave them credit for.

Bone swords whistled through the air. The chilling sharpness coming from them made Tuo Ming roar as he was forced back over and over again. He was stabbed several times and left bleeding. If it weren’t for his armor possessing a powerful self-recovery ability, he would probably have been turned into a sieve by the two of them.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were like black butterflies flitting through the air with their black dresses and hair swirling around them. Their beauty possessed a fatal threat. Tuo Ming didn’t even have the ability to counterattack.

As for the battle for the city, it was chaotic. Just as Tuo Ming’s subordinates charged the city, countless archers on the walls appeared like phantoms. Cold arrowtips pointed at Tuo Ming’s people.

“Fire!”

Following an order, hundreds of thousands of archers shot their arrows at the same time. They were like bolts of lightning raining down on the attackers, which then collapsed in droves.

Seeing these archers shooting rapidly as if the arrows were free, Long Chen was moved. The Longbow race truly had refined archery arts.

Even an ordinary member of the Longbow race possessed terrifying killing power. It was as if they lived for archery. The runes on their arms automatically activated, giving every arrow incredible sharpness. They all aimed at the vitals of the Immortal Kings. Even on this chaotic battlefield, they were like falcons eyeing their prey. They were frighteningly accurate.

After a single wave of arrows, hundreds of thousands of Immortal Kings were slain. Spirit tier and below Immortal Kings were nothing more than targets. As for those beneath the Immortal King level, they were simply ants. These archers couldn’t even bother to shoot them, considering it a waste of an arrow.

The invaders managed to reach a distance not too far from the walls. But they were unable to advance past the rain of arrows. After failing three times, their corpses littered the ground and they were finally too afraid to try again.

Most terrifying of all was that they had had nine Earth tier Immortal Kings. But after those three waves, those nine Earth tier Immortal Kings had been reduced to seven. Two had been killed simply by those arrows.

They had no idea where those arrows came from. They also didn’t know where the archers were hidden. They were in complete chaos.

Seeing that Changgong Hao had killed two Earth tier Immortal Kings, Long Chen felt a burning sensation inside. He would have to raise a group of divine archers in the Dragonblood Legion. This kind of killing power was simply terrifying.

After seeing the enemy in chaos, Long Chen returned his focus to the sky. But space was too twisted in that battlefield for him to even see what was going on. However, he could hear Tuo Ming’s furious roars.

Long Chen walked to the city gates and shouted, “You fools, why are you still resisting? You are lucky enough to keep your life. Shouldn’t you be grateful? As long as you stop fighting and join us, I, Boss Long San, swear on my soul that not a single hair on your head will be harmed. Just who do you want to follow? Of your two bosses, one is already dead, and Tuo Ming will only last a few more minutes before being killed. Are you selling your lives for them? Can they see your heroism?”

Long Chen’s voice resounded throughout the battlefield. It was like an alarm waking them up from a stupor. If both of them died, why would they need to throw their lives away?

“Don’t listen to him! Attack-!” Tuo Ming’s furious roar rang out, only for the distraction to result in him being injured. The sound of him coughing up blood rang out.

It would have been better for him not to say anything. Now that he did, it proved that he was at an absolute disadvantage. At this moment, Long Chen waved his hand, and those archers stopped shooting.

“It just so happens that we need new talents to join us. Thus, I’ll give you a chance. I won’t force you to reply right now. You don’t need to do anything at all, and you can just stand there. If you surrendered now, it would be a betrayal, so why don’t we simply gamble? If Tuo Ming’s head doesn’t fall within an incense stick’s worth of time, I’ll directly let all of you leave safely. If Tuo Ming dies, you join us. Do you accept?” shouted Long Chen.

Hearing this, those people lost all their backbone and simply stared at each other, not knowing what to do. They looked up at the sky, neither accepting nor declining.

Long Chen smiled. Everything was going according to his predictions. Time passed bit by bit.

Suddenly, a head in a helmet fell from the sky and smashed into the ground in front of them. Looking at that head, Long Chen’s smile widened.
