Chapter 4490 Lifehunter Life Death, Verdict of the Heavenly Daos

It was the very blood that the sinister sword had extracted from Long Chen. The violet blood gleamed, casting a hue of violet across the sky. All of a sudden, Long Chen’s heart shook, as if some invisible judge was appraising him. At that moment, Long Chen grasped the Lifehunter expert’s intention.

“Lifehunter Life Death, Verdict of the Heavenly Daos!”

A strange mark appeared on the Lifehunter expert’s forehead. Following that, an ethereal structure appeared between Long Chen and the Lifehunter expert. Beside this construct, a pair of translucent hands slowly tallied the marks of a ruler. Below their feet, a giant set of scales emerged, with Long Chen and the Lifehunter expert positioned on opposite sides.

Long Chen and the Lifehunter expert were restrained by the translucent hands manipulating the scales. It was as if it was measuring their weight.

Suddenly, those hands came to a stop. The Lifehunter expert was brimming with animosity and calmly awaited the result.

He was staking his life, unleashing the Lifehunter race’s strongest trump card.

The Lifehunter race possessed a unique cultivation method, part of which involved increasing the weight of one’s life.

However, invoking the verdict of the Heavenly Daos was considered a taboo technique. Once deployed, there was no going back.

While the Lifehunter race possessed a unique method to enhance the weight of their lives, providing them a considerable advantage in this aspect, there were no absolutes in the world. This was due to the inherent diversity of individuals’ lives. If the Lifehunter experts encountered some people with powerful fates, they would definitely die upon using this divine ability on them.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The weighing process had started. Whose life was more valuable? Whose life was worth less?

While Long Chen didn’t understand this strange technique, he instantly sensed where its strangeness originated from. At first, Long Chen had an uneasy feeling. However, when those hands stopped, Long Chen instantly felt at peace.

For some reason, Long Chen felt incomparably close to these emotionless hands.

Long Chen could sense that these hands were fair, absolutely just. Compared to the Heavenly Daos, they were far more righteous.

Buzz.

Finally, those hands stopped measuring, and the scales blazed with divine light. The Lifehunter expert’s heart plummeted as the moment of life and death approached. Whose side would the scales lean to?

However, when the hands left the scales, instead of tilting in one direction, the scales unexpectedly cracked open, revealing enormous fissures.

“What’s going on?!” the Lifehunter expert shouted in shock. Such a scenario had never been documented in the annals of the Lifehunter race.

BOOM!

The scales exploded, and an enigmatic force reduced the Lifehunter expert’s body and soul to dust.

The Lifehunter expert was dead, wiped out of existence by some mysterious power. One could say that he was destroyed alongside his scales.

Long Chen stood there blankly, still processing what had just happened. Somehow, everything was over before he could grasp the situation.

After the scales were gone, the pair of hands slowly retreated into the heavens, and the world reverted to its original state.

At this moment, Long Chen realized that when the scales and hands materialized, the two of them had been drawn into a strange space, separate from the reality he knew.

Hence, when the scales vanished, Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed, and he hastily checked the primal chaos space.

“Hahaha, even in strange spaces, the Heavenly Dao Tree still works!”

Long Chen saw a completely new Heavenly Doyen Fruit on the Heavenly Dao Tree and laughed crazily.

“One, two, three, four, five! Damn, this fellow actually has five star patterns on his Heavenly Doyen Fruit! No wonder his Doyen power was so monstrous!”

After studying all of the Heavenly Doyen Fruits in his possession, Long Chen estimated that Netherdragon Tianzhao should have been a three-star Heavenly Doyen.

A three-star Doyen and a five-star Doyen. The two simply weren’t on the same level.

This time, Long Chen was somewhat lucky. The presence of Lei Linger and her Saint-level thunderforce made dispatching the Lifehunter expert relatively easy. Without her assistance, the task would have proven challenging.

After all, such an intense Doyen power was absolutely terrifying, and Long Chen’s astral energy couldn’t contend against it directly. Without Lei Linger by his side, the conflict would have turned into a battle of attrition.

In such a scenario, the Lifehunter expert could have unleashed his assassination arts without restraint, forcing Long Chen into a passive stance. Even if Long Chen won in the end, he would need to exert so much effort and the Lifehunter expert might just escape.

While it looked as if everything had been under his control, and that he had been the one to force the Lifehunter expert to the brink, Long Chen knew that luck was a big part of that.

“It seems that I have to quicken the pace and refine the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest,” said Long Chen as he looked at the Saint corpses on the black soil. It would take a bit more time to devour them all.

Once the Saint corpses were done with, he had to deal with the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. As it was a big pile of dragon corpses, their decomposition would take a long time.

However, once it was done, the entire primal chaos space would transform once again, and Lei Linger and Huo Linger would grow to an unimaginable level.

Long Chen reached out his hand to pluck the new Heavenly Doyen Fruit.

“Not good!”

Suddenly, Long Chen’s expression changed. With no time to pluck the fruit, he returned to his body. Wielding his lightning spear once more, he thrust it behind him with all his power.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, a black dragon claw destroyed the lightning spear that contained a Saint’s aura.

“You?!”

When Long Chen sensed the attacker’s aura, he was shocked and enraged. He hadn’t expected him to appear here.

It was none other than the leader of the nether dragon race. Long Chen had been lost in his delight after obtaining the Lifehunter expert’s Heavenly Doyen Fruit, so he hadn’t expected to encounter an opponent here.

“Damn bastard, hand over my Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!”

As the nether dragon race leader transformed into an enormous dragon, a black sword shot out of his mouth, releasing the explosive power of a Saint.

Faced with this terrifying Saint’s attack, Long Chen couldn’t dodge. With a resounding roar, he summoned a lightning shield in front of him, and his Kunpeng wings spread as he flew off.

The nether dragon race leader was not an ordinary Saint and could be considered a terrifying existence amongst Saints. As Long Chen couldn’t even beat ordinary Saints, fighting him would be crazy.

“You think you can get away?! Keep dreaming!” the nether dragon race leader roared.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s lightning shield instantly exploded when it met the black sword, leaving him defenseless against its onslaught. The black sword mercilessly slashed Long Chen, causing blood to spray out of his mouth. As the darkness encroached upon his vision, he couldn’t help but think, “It’s over.”

He lamented the fact that he was just too unlucky.
