Chapter 3701 Swindling

“Fifty million?!”

The seller almost fell when he heard Long Chen’s words. How was that thing worth fifty million? He had been in this profession for over three hundred years and had yet to make that much in total!

It could be said that Long Chen’s thirty-five thousand immortal king crystals were already a huge profit to him.

“Can you give me a cheaper price? You won’t haggle even a bit? Don’t you know how to do business?” urged Long Chen impatiently when he saw the seller just staring at him blankly.

“Ah… No, I can’t go any cheaper! Let me put it to you this way, this was passed down from my grandfather’s grandfather’s grandfather. Don’t look down on it just because it’s small. It has third generation Jiuli characters on top of it! That’s a seal, and no one knows what’s within the seal. Generations of my ancestors were incapable of opening it. As for my own father… he… he tried to forcibly open it, only for the slightest bit of black light to fly out from it, instantly turning him to dust. I was only six at that time, and I personally witnessed his death. I…” That person began to sob and weep.

Long Chen was surprised by his acting skills, so he hastily pressed on. “When your father died, did a flower mark appear? Did the flower have six petals, with the mark of a fiend on every petal?”

“How… how did you know?!” exclaimed that person in shock. That acting was such that even Long Chen almost fell for it.

“Did you see anything else?” asked Long Chen.

“The six ghost heads opened their mouths and devoured the black mist that my father turned into. They then returned into the coffin. Yes, they all came from this mark right here that looks like a tortoise. I saw it clearly. It was this mark. But even after all my years of study, I was unable to break it. I hate it, but I am also fascinated by it. I want to know what it hides. But I know that I’ll never be able to open it in this lifetime. If someone is willing to pay the right price, I’ll sell. But not one bit lower. So I won’t go any lower than my price of… that I just set!” The seller was so nervous that he actually forgot the number that Long Chen had just said. Was it fifty million or five million? Fortunately, his adaptability wasn’t bad.

“What was your father’s cultivation base?” asked Long Chen.

“My father was a World King-”

“Oh?!” Long Chen glared.

“Ah? A World King’s no good?” That person looked at Long Chen questioningly.

Long Chen almost slapped him. Did this person not just expose him? Long Chen wanted him to raise his father’s cultivation base a bit.

“What are you talking about? I was asking about your dad! Your dad’s cultivation base!” 

“Oh, my dad’s cultivation base? I thought that you were talking about his status! Yes, he was the Qing Zhou Prefecture’s World King Guild’s master! His cultivation base had reached the half-step Divine Venerate realm before he died! He was just a half-step away from a Divine Venerate, and yet… yet he died too early. After that, our family declined and I became homeless, simply wandering the world trying to survive. Dad… dad, your child is unfilial! Dad, your spirit is in heaven. Watch over me as I rebuild our family…” The seller sobbed painfully.

Now, Long Chen was doubting this person’s acting skills. Wasn’t this too exaggerated? Only a fool would believe it.

However, the act had been played to this point, so he could only thicken his face. Long Chen then took out a spatial ring.

“Fine, don’t cry. I’ll take this broken coffin of yours. But you have to let me pick out another two items.”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Deal, deal!” The seller happily received Long Chen’s spatial ring with both hands.

Long Chen bent down to pick up the coffin. Seeing that there was no reaction from the surroundings, he sighed in disappointment inside. As expected, he had wasted this effort. This idiot’s acting skills were garbage.

However, just as his hand was about to touch the coffin, he ended up empty-handed. Long Chen ‘furiously’ looked around, instantly spotting the Nine Underworld Luocha not far from him. She was holding the little coffin in her hand.

“Courting death! You dare to take my things?! Put it down, or I’ll make your head fall to the ground!” roared Long Chen.

The Nine Underworld Luocha eyed the coffin and smiled coldly. “You really are an idiot. The High Firmament Academy’s youngest, most erudite dean? What an empty title. You don’t even recognize the grand Thousand Mark Devil Seal. This coffin would be wasted in your hands. It can only reveal its worth in my hands. It’s mine.”

The Nine Underworld Luocha waved her hand, sending a spatial ring to that person. When he picked it up and saw fifty million immortal king crystals, he felt his heart stop beating.

Long Chen had given him an empty spatial ring, but the Nine Underworld Luocha actually gave him the full amount. In other words, they had succeeded. They really had succeeded just like that.

However, he began to tremble and looked at Long Chen in terror. “You’re Long Chen? The High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean? The one who plundered the Soaring Dragon Company?”

“That’s my side business. I can make some quick money that way. Alright, our transaction is done. According to the agreement, hand over half.” Long Chen extended his hand.

That person eyed Long Chen and then the Nine Underworld Luocha. He grew absolutely terrified. These were two monsters that could kill him with a single breath. He didn’t want to get drawn into their fighting.

“Dean Long Chen, this little one was unable to see Mt. Tai. I won’t play this game. Here, you take it. Here is also the thirty-five thousand that you gave me before.” Pale as paper, he handed over two spatial rings. Money might be good, but there would be no point if he had no life.

“What are you talking about? I like money, but I earn it properly. I'll only take my portion. The rest is yours.” Long Chen only took the twenty-five million immortal king crystals and gave the rest back.

BANG!

Just then, the Nine Underworld Luocha realized that she had been scammed and crushed the coffin in her hand to find that there was nothing inside.

“Long Chen!” She clenched her teeth furiously. Fifty million immortal king crystals was nothing to her, but being played for a fool infuriated her.

Seeing this scene, that person was absolutely terrified. He wanted to give the spatial ring in his hand back to her, but he also didn’t dare to. He was so afraid that he wept.

“That’s enough. With me here, she can’t touch you. Leave, you have no business here,” said Long Chen.

The seller was overjoyed by Long Chen’s promise. He then bravely took out a transportation formation and activated it, vanishing from the spot.

“Don’t look at me. These twenty-five million immortal king crystals were earned properly by my hard work! I won’t give them to you. If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

The surrounding stalls that were set up hastily pulled back, giving them a large space.

At this time, Yu Qingxuan gracefully walked over, appearing by Long Chen’s side.

“Dongfang Zichu’s disciple? Do you think being the Vermilion Bird Empire’s princess is so great?” The Nine Underworld Luocha looked at Yu Qingxuan with a hint of jealousy in her eyes. She then snorted and pointed at Long Chen. “Just wait! I’ll take your head in the three thousand worlds.”

When the Nine Underworld Luocha turned and left, Long Chen was a bit surprised. Was she afraid of Yu Qingxuan?

“You really are evil! How can you swindle people like this? Aren’t you afraid of the main High Firmament Academy’s dean scolding you?” rebuked Yu Qingxuan.

She had been hiding in the distance while Long Chen conducted his business with that person, so she had seen everything. This grand dean of the High Firmament Academy was actually constantly plundering and swindling people.

“Hehe, for you, I’m capable of doing even more shameless things. Let me tell you, I picked up a huge treasure.”

Long Chen was very pleased and took out the hairpin once more.
