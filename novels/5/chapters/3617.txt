Chapter 3606

This particular battleship was smaller than the others, only thirty miles long. Compared to these giant battleships that ranged in the hundreds of miles, it was tiny.

However, when it appeared, a vast power shook the world, and ripples appeared in the space around it. Its pressure shook people’s souls.

The Qingying Battleship. It was said that Luo Qingying had forged this battleship herself. She was one of the three great grandmaster scholars of the Alldevil Star-Field’s forging history.

Any star-field had countless grandmasters. However, many of those so-called grandmasters were nothing more than fakes that took the name of grandmaster without having the skill.

A true grandmaster was someone who had refined a skill to the point that those that came after them would have immense difficulty surpassing them. Such people were grandmasters.

As for a grandmaster scholar, they were someone who had reached the pinnacle and then further pushed that path, walking down a path that no one else had ever gone before. They created techniques worth establishing an entire sect over.

Grandmasters were heirs who stood on the shoulders of those that had come before them, while grandmaster scholars were those that had created the path, allowing future generations to benefit endlessly. Thus, every single grandmaster scholar was a major figure whose name went down in history.

Luo Qingying was incredibly talented in forging. She reached the pinnacle at a young age and began creating inventions that others had never even imagined. It was precisely due to her that the human race went from being pushed to the brink of death by the Alldevil race to starting to fight back.

However, Luo Qingying died too early. She still had many innovations and ideas that were still fledgling prototypes. Some of the runes that she had planned and designed were incomprehensible to those that came after her. Just examining the notes that she left behind made people sight over the unimaginable gulf between the talented and the mediocre.

It was said that Luo Qingying had a precious notebook recording many of her ideas that she had not managed to make a reality yet. This notebook was in the hands of the Luo clan. In fact, it was even rumored that a portion of the Luo clan’s people had precisely betrayed and gotten Luo Qingying killed for this notebook.

It was only after they obtained the notebook that the Luo clan realized that it was completely incomprehensible to them. The Luo clan had actually caused Luo Qingying’s death for such a huge joke. Of course, these were just rumors that people couldn’t confirm.

After Luo Qingying died, she left behind only two things, her Qingying Battleship and the Qingying Battle Armor that she had once worn.

The Qingying Battle Armor was essentially destroyed in the battle that caused her death. There were only some fragments left behind. However, her Qingying Battleship was supposedly perfectly intact.

The Qingying Battleship was hidden in secret by the Luo clan. Back then, the entire Alldevil Star-Field’s people had scoured the world for the Qingying Battleship. Some people had even secretly conducted soulsearches on the Luo clan’s people, even using all kinds of torture. But ultimately, they couldn’t find even a single clue about the Qingying Battleship.

It was as if the Qingying Battleship had vanished from the world. It was only when the Luo clan once more betrayed the human race and sided with the Alldevil race that the Qingying Battleship reappeared. It shook the entire human race.

The Qingying Battleship was said to be unrivaled. It was personally forged by Luo Qingying and possessed terrifying destructive power. Any other battleship was like paper in front of it. The Qingying Battleship’s offense, defense, and speed were all unmatched. There had yet to be a single battleship that could match it in any regard.

This battleship that had once terrified the Alldevil race now became the human race’s nightmare. Thus, Guo Ran’s expression instantly changed when he saw it.

The Qingying Battleship had just flown out of the spatial gate when its runes lit up.

Guo Ran howled, “Battleship seven, run!”

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s words had barely left his mouth before the Qingying Battleship unleashed a light-sword. After that, the battleship that Guo Ran had named instantly exploded. All the experts on it were slain.

The Qingying Battleship’s attack speed was too fast and didn’t even give others a chance to dodge. Upon seeing this, everyone’s heart sank.

Just then, endless battleships spread throughout the air, surrounding Long Chen and the others along with Clear Rain City.

The Qingying Battleship shot forward like a shooting star, striking another battleship. That battleship fled quickly but still had a piece fly off of it. As a result, it fell from the sky, and the warriors on it immediately fled for their lives.

“Boss!”

Guo Ran panicked. He had never expected their first attack to cause the Luo clan to directly take out their trump card, the Qingying Battleship. The Qingying Battleship now whistled straight toward the battleship that they were on.

There were over a hundred battleships surrounding them. As for the Qingying Battleship, it could simply smash through their three hundred battleships. It wouldn’t just smash apart the battleships of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College but also smash apart the human race’s will to resist.

The human race needed a beautiful victory to raise their morale. But that was also their enemies’ goal. They wanted to crush their confidence. They were using the Qingying Battleship to display their unbeatable position, making them seem absolutely terrifying.

The Qingying Battleship was clearly capable of long-range attacks, but they arrogantly used it to directly smash into the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s battleships. On the other hand, all their battleships’ attacks had no effect on the Qingying Battleship at all. They merely caused some ripples and were unable to break its defenses.

“Ignorant fools! Resistance leads only to death! Today, don’t blame my Luo clan for being ruthless! But don’t be afraid, after you die, I will spread the images to the other fools who vainly wish to resist as well. I trust that they will make the right decision. Your deaths will lead the world to peace, so you can die in peace, hahaha!” An arrogant laugh rang out from the top of the Qingying Battleship.

The Qingying Battleship suddenly flew through a strange arc, coming at the battleship Long Chen and Guo Ran were on from an inconceivable angle.

“When shooting people, first shoot their horse. When shooting bandits, first shoot their leader. You aren’t much of a leader. At most, you can count as a little chieftain. But killing you should still have a decent effect, don’t you think? It’s like killing the chicken to warn the monkeys,” sneered the same voice from the Qingying Battleship.

“Boss!” Guo Ran looked at Long Chen. They had no counter for the Qingying Battleship, and it was also too fast. If this continued, this battle would become a perfect performance for the other side.

“I’ll handle it.”

Long Chen eyed the Qingying Battleship. After that, a black dagger suddenly appeared in his hand, and golden dragon scales covered his arm. Just like that, he swung his hand, and the black dagger vanished.

Long Chen then immediately unsheathed the Minghong Saber. Man and saber together smashed toward the Qingying Battleship like a bolt of lightning.

Seeing Long Chen’s actions, Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others cried out in shock. Throwing a person at the Qingying Battleship? Was that no different than suicide?

Even Guo Ran, the one who had blind confidence in Long Chen, had his heart rise up his throat. Countless eyes fell on Long Chen. At this moment, time seemed to move slowly.

They saw Long Chen hold his saber in his right hand, while a flame lotus appeared in his left hand. His saber was held in front of him, while lightning gushed out from the bottom of his feet. Violet qi wrapped around his entire body. He was like a whirling nail striking the Qingying Battleship.

BOOM! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The invincible Qingying Battleship that could not be harmed by anything had a large hole forcibly pierced into it. Long Chen flew into the head of the battleship and out of its tail.

Long Chen then put away the black dagger and looked back at the Qingying Battleship that now had an extra hole in it.

“Explode.”
