There were currently millions of various Xuan Beasts gathered within the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory.

Long Chen had an icy smile. The Xuan Beasts really forgot their beatings quickly. Had they come to find another mountain to rely on?

When Long Chen came walking out of the transportation formation, he saw that not one member of the Dragonblood Legion was present. Upon seeing him, the clamor died out.

All the Xuan Beasts looked at Long Chen apprehensively, but not with any panic.

“Big brother Long Chen, you’re back! Come to the Cloud Chasing Palace.” Cloud grabbed Long Chen’s hand and dragged him to the palace. The Xuan Beasts in their way all bowed to her.

“What is going on?” asked Long Chen.

“Hehe, all our old enemies like the Kunpeng race, the Nine Heavens Phoenix race, and the others have been wiped out. A few of them got away, but in the end, other Xuan Beasts sent them before us. Having lost the support of the Kunpeng race, the Xuan Beasts wish to raise the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race as the emperors of the Xuan Beasts. The large and powerful races have already assented, and their leaders are in the palace discussing it with our race leader. However, she hasn’t agreed to anything yet and is waiting for you to return to discuss it,” said Cloud excitedly.

“Ha.” Long Chen snorted.

“What? Is being emperor bad? The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race has been suppressed for so long by the Kunpeng race. Now we can return to an even greater glory.” Cloud looked at Long Chen with surprise.

“You’re still too young,” said Long Chen, rubbing her head.

The Peng Emperor’s statue had been broken, with his inheritance gone. The Kunpeng race had been hunted down. Their accomplices like the Nine Heavens Phoenix race were also wiped out. Hence, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race truly possessed the power to replace them, but things definitely weren’t so simple.

Long Chen arrived at the palace to see hundreds of Xuan Beasts standing inside. Que Yuzhu and the other core Elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race were also present. Only Que Yuzhu was permitted to be seated.

When Long Chen walked in, their voices stopped. It seemed that they had been discussing something but didn’t wish to continue in front of him.

“Long Chen, you’re finally back. It just so happens that we have major affairs to discuss with you.” Que Yuzhu hastily stood.

In front of all the others, she could grandly sit while others stood. But in front of Long Chen, she never viewed herself as his senior. She would forever remember that everything that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had was because of him.

“You’re too kind. This is an internal matter of the Xuan Beasts. As an outsider, it’s not good for me to participate.” Long Chen shook his head.

“What are you saying? No matter how much time passes, you will forever be the benefactor of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. We will always follow your lead,” said Que Yuzhu. She seemed to have sensed something as well.

As the leader of her race, she had to have a sharper vision than others. She seemed to sense Long Chen’s displeasure.

These words of hers were not just for placating him either. They were heartfelt. Without him, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race would have been killed by the Kunpeng race.

She didn’t know why Long Chen was unhappy, but she and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race would never go against him, so she first stated that clearly.

Long Chen nodded to her. He then faced the people in the palace and announced, “Then everyone here can leave. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race will not be your emperors.”

“What?”

Everyone’s expression changed. They didn’t know why Long Chen would say this, not even the Elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

“In terms of power, bloodline, or inheritance, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is not inferior to the Kunpeng race or the Nine Heavens Phoenix race. It’s not out of place for us to lead the Xuan Beasts,” said one of the Elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

“Uncle…” Que Yuzhu indicated for him to be quiet.

This Elder’s cultivation base wasn’t particularly high, but his seniority was above hers. Que Yuzhu had a bad feeling upon seeing him rise. He immediately said, “Yuzhu, I understand what you’re saying, but some things must be said explicitly. After all, we are Xuan Beasts. Our bloodlines… are special.”

Que Yuzhu’s expression changed. This was clearly saying that Long Chen was a human, and not part of the Xuan Beasts.

Although there was nothing wrong with saying that, for him to say it now seemed to indicate that he didn’t care about Long Chen’s favor to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. After being lifted by Long Chen, he wanted to kick him away?

When she thought of that, her expression sank and she became furious. Had this old fellow grown muddled with age?

“Race leader, our Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is about to enter our most glorious era. We’ve wiped away the humiliation of tens of thousands of years. By leading the world of Xuan Beasts, won’t our name go down in history? What is wrong with that?” Another Elder of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race stood as well. “Long Chen, we’ve always cared about you and are very grateful to you. But we don’t understand why you wish to stop our rise. Are you threatened by us?”

“You all-!” Que Yuzhu raged, and killing intent finally appeared within her eyes.

“Aunt Que, don’t be angry. They are not wrong,” said Long Chen.

“Since we’re not wrong, can you explain why you wish to stop our growth?” demanded one of the Elders.

One of the Xuan Beasts asked, “Is it because you have a prejudice against us? If so, we will collectively kneel toward you in apology. It was the guidance of the Kunpeng race that caused our conflict. Now, we wish to remain unified. We don’t wish to see the Xuan Beasts fracture and start fighting amongst ourselves. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is currently the only one in a position capable of winning all of us over and being a stable leader. That doesn’t seem to pose any harm to you.”

These words were very reasonable and not directly against Long Chen. However, there seemed to be a tone of grievance within them. It incited the other Xuan Beasts’ resentment at being forced into submitting to such a person. Everyone’s gazes concentrated on Long Chen, with more than a few containing some anger.

Long Chen smiled and looked from that Xuan Beast to the Elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. He shook his head. “Do you know why I helped the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race?”

Those Elders didn’t say anything. They didn’t know what to say. So Long Chen continued, “Let me put it to you this way. If I put the effort I did into raising the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race toward the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance, I could have created another Dragonblood Legion. Although it would be weaker than the current Dragonblood Legion, it would definitely be stronger than the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.”

Those Elders remained silent. Long Chen had essentially smashed resources into the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race to help them grow. Just the grand formation was something that cost an astronomical amount.

Meng Qi had even freely shared the Myriad Spirit Diagram with them, allowing them to regain their lost divine abilities. Otherwise, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race would not possess its current power.

“We will remember what you’ve done for us, but you can’t expect us to allow you to control the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race forever just become of some kindness-”

“Shut your mouth. Que Yingfeng, using my status as race leader, I dismiss you from your post as Grand Elder and expel you!” shouted Que Yuzhu.

The Elder that had been speaking fell silent. The first expression on his face was not anger but sadness instead. In front of the other shocked Elders, he took a deep breath and walked away. However, he was stopped by Long Chen.

His expression changed. He demanded, “What, are you going to take my life for this?”

Despite his position, he had to listen to the race leader’s words, or he would be a sinner of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. But just because he had accepted his dismissal didn’t mean he was a coward.

“Everyone, calm down. Let me finish speaking. There’s no need for such drama.” Long Chen looked over to the Elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. “My main reason for helping the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is Cloud. Cloud is one of my closest companions. If her race is in danger, I will help without hesitation. When I help people, I don’t ask for compensation, so when you say I want to control you, there is no such thing. I already have a group of life and death brothers I can rely on, and I don’t need anyone else.”

Elder Que Yingfeng’s anger faded hearing that. Everyone was aware of Long Chen’s pride. His accusation truly had been a bit too much.

Cloud stood beside Long Chen, tightly holding his hand. She was extremely grateful.

“Do you know why I oppose you becoming the emperors of the Xuan Beasts? It’s because… it’s a trap.” Long Chen looked at the various Xuan Beasts that had come and sneered.

“What?” Que Yuzhu and the other members of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race were startled to hear that.
