Chapter 3210 Apocalyptic Flame Lotus

Bai Xiaole used his spatial art, sending him and Qin Feng away. Just as they vanished, a giant flame lotus exploded amongst the sea serpents.

BOOM!

The flame lotus smashed into the sea, sinking the surface of the water and forming a giant depression. As the flame lotus disintegrated, heaven and earth shuddered. After that, huge waves exploded.

Flames and water wove together into a vortex of destruction. Astral winds that were mixed with the seawater unleashed a storm upon Ying Prefecture.

As a result, giant waves struck the wall on the coast, and the experts behind the wall heard thunderous rumbling. They all turned pale. This power had surpassed their understanding.

The huge waves gradually stopped. Looking at the devil sea, they saw that flames were still burning on top of it. But now, countless corpses littered it, and the water was boiling.

Long Chen’s flame lotus had actually ignited the sea water. Ever since ancient times, water and fire would subdue each other. People had never heard of a flame capable of igniting water.

In truth, it wasn’t the water that was burning. It was Long Chen’s flame energy that had entered the sea. Due to the repulsion of water and fire, the flame energy that had sunk down below was released back to the surface.

Unlike on land, the power of the flame lotus wasn’t able to spread limitlessly in the water. It was contained by the water, and more of it continued to float back to the surface, causing people to feel like the water was burning.

However, Long Chen’s attack did cause countless burnt corpses to float to the surface. Those corpses were as big as mountains.

Even the sea serpents, which were originally golden, had turned charred black. They were all dead.

“The temperature was just perfect.” Long Chen smiled.

If this attack was unleashed on land, not even a trace of these corpses would be left. The seawater had reduced the flame lotus’s power, allowing these beasts to retain their corpses. That was precisely what Long Chen wanted.

“It wasn’t perfect at all! My treasures, not even one is left alive! You poor babies, you all died so miserably…” Bai Xiaole had a mournful expression as he looked at the corpses of the sea serpents. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Those sea serpents truly did appear mighty, so he wanted one as a steed. He thought that Long Chen would leave a few alive for him, but they were all dead now.

Such good mounts had been turned into roast snakes. Seeing this scene, Bai Xiaole almost wept.

Luo Xue and the others recovered from their shock. Looking at Bai Xiaole’s expression, they didn’t know whether to be angry or to laugh. Such terrifying sea serpents had actually been treated as pets by him. It had to be known that those were no demonic beasts but deep sea devils.

“Little fellow, if you want to follow boss, you need to grow up a bit. With how smelly these things are, can you use them as mounts? Won’t you choke from the smell first? Furthermore, with boss, you can find any good mount that you want. Don’t embarrass yourself and boss here,” scolded Qin Feng.

“Who cares if they’re smelly or not? Wait, how are they smelly? Take a sniff, don’t you think… they smell… kind of tasty?”

Bai Xiaole took a few deep sniffs, and Qin Feng rolled his eyes. However, after being cooked like this, they truly didn’t smell bad anymore.

“Xiaole, this sea serpent isn’t a demonic beast. It’s a deep sea devil. You can’t eat their meat, or you’ll be infected by their devil blood soul,” said Luo Bing hastily when she saw Bai Xiaole itching to try it.

“Alright, stop messing around. Clean up the battlefield. Who knows when the next attack will come?” shouted Long Chen to stop Bai Xiaole.

Long Chen had ended the battle with a single attack. The World Extermination Flame Lotus had exploded in the depths of the sea, killing the other sea demons that had been swimming over.

As far as the eye could see, the sea was covered by endless corpses. Cleaning them all up would definitely take some time.

“Long Chen, this attack really was marvelous. You helped us out immensely. Otherwise, if we had activated the attack of the commander tower, we’d need to tighten our belts for maybe half a year,” said Luo Changwu, walking over.

“Senior is too kind. Those sea serpents were clearly drawn over by Qin Feng’s resonance dragon essence blood. We were just cleaning our own butts,” said Long Chen.

“Commander, Long Chen isn’t an outsider. There’s no need to be overly courteous. That’s right, Long Chen, didn’t you say that you want those corpses? Do you want their demonic cores?” asked Luo Xue.

“No, I don’t need their demonic cores. I only want their corpses,” said Long Chen. For ordinary experts, the demonic cores were the real treasures. They contained the essence of the sea demon’s life.

The Ying Prefecture fought against the sea demons every year, putting a large amount of manpower into dealing with them. However, thinking about it, obtaining those demonic cores made it so that their work wasn’t for nothing. With it, they could compensate the families of those who died, and there was always a surplus. If they had enough power to guarantee that there were no losses, then their gains were quite considerable. Furthermore, as they were collaborating with the Huayun Trading Company, there was no need to worry about the market.

“The flesh of these sea demons is trash, not valuable at all. Why would you want it?” asked Luo Ning.

“Ah, this…” Long Chen was a bit embarrassed. It really wasn’t easy for him to answer this question.

“Ning-er, how can you randomly ask about other people’s secrets?”

Luo Changwu immediately gave Luo Ning a look. But he knew that Long Chen was closest with Luo Ning and Luo Bing, so Long Chen wouldn’t get angry over such a small matter. Thus, he wasn’t in a position to chide her too much.

“If you want the corpses, then it’s simple. We have countless spatial rings here packed with their corpses. We were going to toss them in the wilderness, but if you want them, you can take as many as you want. I don’t know if you can hold so many though,” said Luo Changwu.

Whether or not he could hold enough? What kind of joke was that? His primal chaos space was absolutely gigantic.

“I want as many as you have. How coincidental, you have something you need to get rid of that I absolutely want. It’s so convenient,” laughed Long Chen. This really was a nice coincidence.

“Really? I’ll have people bring over ten of our largest spatial rings.”

In just a bit, the Luo family’s experts brought over ten spatial rings. Long Chen opened them and found that they weren’t bad. They had a space of a thousand square miles and were packed with corpses.

Long Chen didn’t need to bring the spatial rings into the primal chaos space, so he directly brought the corpses inside. In just a few seconds, the ten spatial rings were emptied.

Seeing that Long Chen could take the corpses like that, Luo Changwu was pleasantly surprised. This would save them quite some trouble.

Luo Changwu ordered people to take the spatial rings and clean up the battlefield. He also ordered people who still had corpses in their spatial rings to bring them to Long Chen.

As a result, countless corpses piled up within Long Chen’s primal chaos space. The Wood Foundation Divine Trees rapidly grew. Sensing their immense life energy, Long Chen clenched his fists. His trump card had finally returned and was growing even stronger.
