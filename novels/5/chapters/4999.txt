An elder of the Long clan burst in, completely exasperated. His face was red with anger as he saw Long Chen and Feng Fei casually dining in this reserved banquet hall meant for clan leaders. This elder was responsible for overseeing this event, ensuring everything went smoothly, but Long Chen’s intrusion had just ruined it.

Without even asking, Long Chen had directly sat down and started eating. Now, the elder gritted his teeth, his frustration palpable, as if he wanted to chop Long Chen up and serve him as food.

As Feng Fei picked up more food with her chopsticks, she froze upon hearing the elder’s rebuke. She glanced at Long Chen and immediately grasped the situation. Embarrassment washed over her as she realized the impropriety of their presence here.

Long Chen calmly said, “I was hungry and I saw food, so I started eating. Elder, have you eaten yet? Why don’t you sit and have some as well?”

“I’ll eat your head!” roared that elder.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Just then, the Heaven Overseer walked in. Seeing the elder’s raging expression and Long Chen sitting there eating calmly, the Heaven Overseer didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

The elder pointed at Long Chen, tears squeezing out of his eyes. “Heaven Overseer, you must find justice for me! The banquet is about to start! But the food… the food…”

In an instant, the Heaven Overseer knew what was happening. However, getting angry now was meaningless, so he said, “Quick, switch the banquet halls and set up new dishes. I’ll stall for time, so you don’t need to rush. Just make sure everything is up to the highest standards. Don’t let them laugh at us.”

The elder left, but not before glaring fiercely at Long Chen. This grudge would not be forgotten.

Long Chen pulled back a chair beside him and said, “Heaven Overseer, what a coincidence. Sit and eat. It just so happens that I have something to discuss with you.”

“That’s alright. We can eat another time as I have to deal with our guests first. No need to rush. You can eat at your leisure. Make sure to treat your guest well,” answered the Heaven Overseer. He nodded to Feng Fei before leaving.

“Go ahead and eat. Now you can eat with ease,” said Long Chen.

Feng Fei looked at Long Chen and burst into laughter. It took her a while to regain her composure enough to say, “I really admire you. Even after all these years, you haven’t changed a bit.”

“Somehow that doesn’t sound like a compliment,” Long Chen quipped back, his mouth full as he continued to eat. After the events in Mercenary City, he was eating to ease his lingering grief.

Originally, Long Chen had wanted to ask the Heaven Overseer how Long Zaiye could so openly and arrogantly lead the Long clan’s disciples in bullying the mercenaries, and even kill them. Was the so-called authority of the four Heavenly Saints garbage? Did it lose effect as soon as his father wasn’t present?

“The Heaven Overseer seems like a respectable elder. His temper is definitely good as he didn’t curse you,” said Feng Fei.

“He just knows how to accept the situation and adapt. We have already eaten the food, so cursing me is useless. It would only offend me. On the other hand, this way, he buys a favor from me. Now I have to thank him, and you also owe him a favor,” Long Chen explained, gulping down some wine. Feeling like it wasn’t very good, he took out some of his own wine and poured a cup for Feng Fei.

“Long Chen, do you know what the Heaven Overseer’s status is? Why are our clan leaders so polite to him even though he is only an Earth Saint?” asked Feng Fei curiously.

Long Chen shook his head. “I never asked, and I don’t care. I won’t stay in the Long clan for long. Once I’m done here, I’m leaving. I can’t be bothered about some things.”

Feng Fei then looked at the hundreds of delicacies on the table. There was no way they could finish them all, so she proposed inviting a few of her sisters to eat, and Long Chen didn’t mind at all.

Hence, Feng Fei used a secret art to call over ten of the Jiang clan’s disciples. The moment they arrived, Long Chen regretted his decision.

“Big Brother Long Chen, I heard that when you were born, your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone were taken. You didn’t even set foot onto the path of cultivation before fifteen. Is that true?”

“Big Brother Long Chen, I heard that you have many beautiful women. You can’t even count them all with both hands, and every single one of them is like a heavenly fairy. But in your heart, who is your true love?”

“Big Brother Long Chen, when we first arrived, we saw you standing over a corpse. It seemed that you just killed someone who had condensed heaven vein dragon qi. Who was that person?”

“Big Brother Long Chen, you’re so handsome and heroic. I even heard that you’re an alchemist! With your talent, you should have piles of concubines. Can I ask if we have a chance? If so, how do we apply? Is there a waiting list?”

“...”

The Jiang clan’s disciples didn’t even eat and just bombarded Long Chen with all kinds of questions, causing his head to buzz. He felt like his head would explode.

Even an experienced warrior like Long Chen couldn’t endure such a thing, so he quickly made an excuse and left, despite not being full yet.

Seeing Long Chen hastily departing, Feng Fei burst into laughter. She hadn’t expected the usually unrivaled Long Chen to end up in such a sorry state.

As Long Chen hurriedly made his way out, he nearly collided with someone who suddenly appeared before him. Standing there was a woman dressed in snow-white robes, her hair elegantly tied in a high bun. She possessed striking features with shapely eyebrows, phoenix eyes, and cherry lips, exuding an aura of extraordinary beauty.

She was stunningly beautiful, but she was clad in the arrogance of someone who stood far above everyone else. She looked at Long Chen expressionlessly, her eyebrows knitting ever so slightly as if annoyed.

Long Chen hadn’t anticipated anyone being around the corner and was about to apologize when two more figures emerged behind her. One of them coldly shouted, “Are you blind?!”

Long Chen’s temper flared instantly. “If you had been looking, this wouldn’t have happened. Do you think you own this path?”

Only then did Long Chen realize that these two were wearing robes of the Long clan, and more surprisingly, they were both Heavenly Chosens. Their auras indicated they were sealed experts from the ancient era.

Irritated by Long Chen, one of the men was about to curse him when the woman raised her hand. She eyed Long Chen.

“Are you Long Chen?” asked the woman.

Long Chen was startled. He glanced at the two experts behind her and replied, “Then you must be Long Tianrui.”

Long Chen hadn’t expected to run into the Long clan’s legendary heavenly genius. What surprised him most was that Long Tianrui's aura was so perfectly controlled that he hadn’t sensed her presence until nearly colliding with her.

She seemed even stronger than Jiang Wuwang of the Jiang clan. Jiang Wuwang had to intentionally set up defenses to evade Long Chen’s senses. However, Long Tianrui’s aura seemed to blend seamlessly with heaven and earth. Even standing in front of her, Long Chen couldn’t sense her presence. Her reputation was well-deserved; she was truly formidable.

“You are quite impressive. Are you willing to follow me?” Long Tianrui looked at Long Chen. The two people behind her instantly tensed, with envy evident in their eyes.

“Tch.” Long Chen spat out a single sound before walking by her.
