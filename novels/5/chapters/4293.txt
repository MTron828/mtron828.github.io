Chapter 4282: Heartless Wind Moon, Silence of the Night

This woman had summoned multiple barriers with a wave of her hand. The next moment, terrifying ripples smashed into her defenses, unleashing explosive rumbling sounds. But they were unable to get through.

It wasn’t just Tang Wan-er who was excited; all the Wind Sect’s disciples also cried out in excitement.

When this woman appeared, Yan Chang’s expression changed. Suddenly, he extended his hand, and space contorted, allowing a black hand to reach into the Dragonblood Legion, aiming directly for Yu Qingxuan.

The Dragonblood Legion’s people found that they were unable to move. The moment Yan Chang attacked, they could only watch as that hand fell.

Suddenly, a cold light slashed through the air, and that hand exploded. Ripples like a water screen then appeared in the air along with an enchanting, short-haired woman.

She wore skintight black leather armor, her short hair accentuating her striking features. Yet, her face sent shivers down people's spines

She was like a grim reaper, a harbinger of death. Her bone-chilling aura rendered her beauty inconsequential, leaving only a sense of dread in those who saw her.

“Who are you?!”

Yan Chang shouted furiously. Long Chen had been saved and brought away by some mysterious expert, so he decisively switched targets to Yu Qingxuan, only for this person to cut off his arm.

“The Heartless Wind Moon, Feng Xinyue.”

“The Silence of the Night, Ye Wusheng.”

These two beautiful women announced their identities at the same time and silence permeated the world.

The Wind Sect’s master, Feng Xinyue and the Shadow Sect’s master, Ye Wusheng. They were existences who had made a name for themselves countless years ago. Yet, most people didn’t even know what they looked like. Even half-step Eternals hadn’t recognized them.

When the two of them became famous, these half-step Eternals were still playing in the mud. Most of them hadn’t even been born yet.

These two had shaken the nine heavens while in the Immortal King realm. After setting up their own sects with a chosen few disciples, they withdrew from the public view. Only their disciples occasionally roamed the world and were seen by people

Having dominated their own respective eras, they were called unrivaled existences. It could be said that they were the strongest experts of their time, their light overwhelming everyone born in the same era. They had risen like a shooting star.

Even though they had chosen to seclude themselves, there were still countless stories about them in the cultivation world. The monikers “The Heartless Wind Moon” and “The Shadow of the Night” represented an entire era.

“Barbarian Dragon Splits the Heavenly Dome!”

Just then, a roar rang out and the nine heavens were torn apart by two enormous dragon claws. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In an instant, all the half-step Eternals attacking the palace master were torn apart, dozens of them killed in one blow.

“How boring. There wasn’t a single decent opponent. Brahma’s dogs, get over here and fight!”

The palace master walked over, his battle intent still blazing. Every step he took caused the world to shudder as if it would break apart.

“The palace master has made another breakthrough!” Bai Zhantang stared at the palace master in shock.

“It seems that he comprehended something in the High Firmament Palace, resulting in this breakthrough,” said Bai Shishi’s mother.

Bai Xiaole’s mothers smiled and the tension left her body. “So we were worried for nothing. It seems that everything is under control.”

Bai Zhantang and the others nodded. The palace master had actually been concealing his power the entire time. This was something unbelievable to them.

After all, the palace master was not such a cool-headed person. They had no idea what had caused this madman to endure all this time.

“My Yan Xu line will remember this debt! We will settle it with your human race another day!” Yan Chang snorted and suddenly transformed into black flames before vanishing.

“Feng Xinyue, Ye Wusheng, do you really want to challenge Lord Brahma?” shouted that large expert. He had just lost one of his comrades and was clearly afraid of the two of them. Thus, although he shouted, he was clearly not as arrogant as before.

“Have Lord Brahma say that to me personally or even Fallen Daynight. As for you, you aren’t qualified. Go back and tell Lord Brahma that no matter how deep he schemes, no plan is fool-proof. The plans of a man cannot match the plans of the heavens. This gate was ultimately not opened. Let him think about his next step!” responded Ye Wusheng coldly.

“We won’t kill you. Scram!” added Feng Xinyue indifferently.

“I also won’t kill you. However, I heard that you have the ability to use a portion of Lord Brahma’s power. Why don’t we exchange some pointers before you go?” asked the palace master.

“Hmph, I’ll report your words to Lord Brahma! Just wait!”

That large expert flew away, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Yan Chang ran away, one of the eight great divine commanders was slain, and the other one fled. To top it off, all the half-step Eternals attacking the palace master had been slain.

At this moment, the experts of the various races found that the situation had taken a drastic turn for them. Everyone else had long since scattered like birds and beasts, so now all that remained on the battlefield were them.

“How boring. Why didn’t you just kill them all? So many of them got away.” The palace master frowned irritably.

At this time, Feng Xinyue had walked over to Tang Wan-er and held her hand with a pampering look. She indifferently said, “If you want to blame someone, blame your Dean Bai. He was the one who asked us not to take action until the critical point.”

“Master, where is Long Chen? Did you send him away?” Tang Wan-er pulled on Feng Xinyue’s hand anxiously.

Feng Xinyue shook her head. “I didn’t save him. It was another woman in violet robes who did.”

“Violet robes? I didn’t see anyone like that,” said Tang Wan-er in surprise. Meng Qi and the others also stared in disbelief. They had only heard the sound of a zither and then a ripple spread. Following that, Long Chen vanished.

“Master, why didn’t you show yourselves sooner? Why not deal with all those people at once? We almost died from fright,” complained one of the Wind Sect’s disciples.

That disciple’s complaints didn’t anger Feng Xinyue, and she simply smiled. “This battle was actually a test for Long Chen.”

“What test?” Tang Wan-er cocked her head in confusion.

“A test to see if he was worth us risking our lives for him,” answered Feng Xinyue solemnly.

“And the results?” asked Tang Wan-er hastily.

Just then, a rumbling sound rang out, and the world was shaking. The sound was coming from the Sage King Prefecture.

“Let’s take a look.”

Feng Xinyue and the others brought them back to the Sage King Prefecture. The disciples then felt the space quiver for a bit and found themselves at the core in the blink of an eye. This was where the martial stage had been.

.

However, the earth had collapsed, leaving only darkness in sight. Within that darkness was a giant gate with a tiny, yet discernible, crack in its surface.

This gate was rumbling as if some terrifying creature was trying to push it open.

“Damn human race, when this gate opens, it will be the day of your destruction!”

Suddenly, a terrifying roar came from the other side of the gate. After that, startled cries rang out.

“An Eternal expert!”
