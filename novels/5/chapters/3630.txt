Chapter 3619

“Stop killing the traitors and gather all the treasures! You only have ten breaths’ time. You must be quick!” shouted Long Chen.

After giving that order, Long Chen took out formation discs. There were over a thousand of them, and he placed them according to a certain arrangement.

…

“The grand formation was broken with a single attack?! How can that be?! That formation doesn’t look weaker than our Celestial Essence Sect’s grand formation at all!”

“Heavens, they’re attacking the military forging area of the Luo clan? How did they find it?”

“The main thing is that even if they found it, how did they manage to transport themselves there like this?”

When they saw Long Chen and the others break through the formation and directly attack the Luo clan’s forging land, everyone within the Celestial Essence Domain was dumbfounded.

“I understand! The Luo clan suddenly retreated because they received a distress signal from there!” exclaimed the patriarch of the Celestial Essence Sect.

Everyone nodded at that. They felt a wave of admiration for Long Chen.

“But how did Long Chen know that the Luo clan would suddenly attack? How did he grasp the timing so perfectly?”

Countless gazes looked at Xue Yifan, who then shook his head with a bitter smile. “Don’t look at me. I’ve left everything to dean Long Chen. He doesn’t need to discuss anything with me, so I don’t know anything about it. All I know is that if you’re going to use someone, don’t doubt them, and if you doubt someone, don’t use them. Since I’ve chosen to trust him, I trust him fully. Although I haven’t done anything big in this lifetime, I have some confidence in my vision. I also feel great admiration for the High Firmament Academy’s dean Bai Letian. If he can trust Long Chen, then there’s no need for me to doubt him. Right now, I am just a spectator. I don’t need to manage anything and can just enjoy the show.”

Hearing that, everyone was even more shocked. This far-too-brazen youngster’s methods were truly astonishing.

They fell silent and continued watching the starry river warriors slaughter the traitors. While watching this, the resentment that had been accumulating within their hearts felt lighter.

“Heavens, there are so many treasures!”

When they saw Long Chen split apart the mountain, revealing all the treasures, everyone’s eyes reddened.

Even the likes of Xue Yifan, the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, and the other half-step Divine Venerates let out a silent sigh when they saw that.

Standing at their height, they no longer felt much toward these items. But to other cultivators, this kind of allure was fatal.

Back in the Hongying era, in the end, people lost to their greed. If the human race had really won, it was unknown if they would have turned against each other and slaughtered their fellow humans just for a better percentage of those resources.

The elders exchanged glances and shook their heads. The human race might be able to defeat their fierce and powerful enemies, but most of the time, they lost to their greed.

…

The hundred thousand starry river warriors collapsed on the treasury, sweeping all the treasures away. It was like they were licking it clean. Even the windows and door frames were torn off, let alone the doorposts and stairs.

In any case, they were all made out of metal and were valuable, so these robbers didn’t leave anything behind. Even Long Chen was dumbfounded.

“Damn, your methods really are professional. I didn’t teach you these things,” said Long Chen.

“Hehe, we’re just self-made geniuses. This is our natural talent,” chortled one starry river warrior with a pleased expression.

“Everyone, get in the transportation formation. We’re leaving.” Long Chen directed everyone into the formation he had set up with the discs.

“Boss, you really are a divine strategist. You prepared everything.” Guo Ran and the others couldn’t help prostrating themselves toward Long Chen when they saw him set up their escape route in the short time it took them to clean out the treasures.

“Divine strategist my ass. This was all prepared by the dean. Put away your armors. Don’t let your auras fluctuate too badly, or it will affect the formation,” ordered Long Chen.

Just then, they heard rumbling in the distance. Everyone was startled and hastily looked over.

After that, Long Chen activated the formation, and over a thousand formation discs lit up at the same time. The starry river warriors were enveloped by a thousand rays of divine light. Space then shuddered and all of them vanished, leaving behind only the fragments of the formation discs.

Just as they vanished, the void rumbled and seven Qingying Battleships tore through the void. However, they were one step too late. They didn’t even manage to get a look at the robbers’ shadows. They only saw ruins.

“AHH! Our stronghold!”

An elder let out a heart-rending scream when he saw the wreckage that was once their powerful base.

It had to be known that this stronghold was built with a huge amount of the Luo clan’s blood and sweat.

There were countless formations carved under the stronghold, costing a huge amount of manpower and financial resources. But this stronghold was now completely wrecked and the treasures were stolen. The Luo clan’s battle armors and battleships no longer even had a place to be repaired when they were damaged.

It had to be known that the Alldevil Star-Field’s battleships and battle armors constantly used up resources. After every large battle, many damaged components needed to be repaired. Even if they didn’t need specific repairs, they had to be taken good care of to maintain peak combat power.

With this stronghold destroyed, they had lost the place for the maintenance of their equipment. Once their battleships were damaged, they wouldn’t be able to use them again. This meant that their battle potential would plummet the longer they fought. This move of Long Chen’s had truly struck them where it hurt.

“The heavens are about to change. We’re doomed.” That elder of the Luo clan was as pale as a sheet of paper. He was terrified.

“It’s not that grave, is it? We still have eighteen Qingying Battleships, a hundred thousand offensive battleships, and thirty thousand defensive battleships. We still have an overwhelming advantage,” said another elder uncomprehendingly.

Although this stronghold was destroyed, which was most definitely a shocking and alarming matter, he felt that the despair in that elder’s eyes was overstating it. Even without this stronghold, they didn’t have anything to fear.

“What do you know?! The Alldevil race is only willing to let us mine the resources here because they want to defeat the human race effortlessly. They’re using us, while we are also using them. But now that we’ve lost this stronghold, we don’t have any further supplies. We’ll grow weaker and weaker. When we start fighting a direct battle against the human race, the Alldevil race will not hesitate to make their move. They might just wipe all of us out together!” raged the elder.

The other elder sucked in a cold gasp of air. He hadn’t thought that far. The only reason that the Alldevil race had chosen to cooperate with them was to defeat the human race without having to lift a finger. This was their agreement. The Luo clan would unify the Alldevil Star-Field for the Alldevil race, and then all the resources here would belong to the Luo clan.

However, the condition was that the Alldevil race would win without mobilizing a single fighter. They only left these devil beasts to the Luo clan to direct.

If the Luo clan failed to accomplish their task, then their agreement would be void. After that, the Alldevil race would slaughter them as well, and it wouldn’t count as breaking their oath.

According to the Alldevil race’s violent character, they really might just destroy them all. Then the Alldevil race would be the only winner. There would no longer be a human race in the Alldevil Star-Field.

The rest of the Luo clan’s battleships only arrived at this time. Those battleships simply couldn’t compare to the Qingying Battleships.

Suddenly, that elder’s tablet began to flash rapidly. He jumped in terror.

“Not good! The headquarters is under attack!”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
