Chapter 3229 Collective Honing

Xu Zixiong coughed up blood. He was at the seventy-ninth stair and was sent flying back, unable to reach the eightieth step.

Hence, Xu Zixiong was tumbling down the stairs. On the sixtieth step, Bai Xiaole hastily got out of his way. Just like that, Xu Zixiong was sent flying past him, landing on the ground, his body almost deformed.

Bai Xiaole quivered. Xu Zixiong was truly ruthless. He had tried over ten times, only to end up in this miserable state every time. But he never gave up.

Bai Xiaole then looked up to see Qin Feng at the ninetieth stair. The latter stayed in his position for a long moment before suddenly raising his leg to the ninety-first stair.

As a result, with a grunt, he was sent flying down just like Xu Zixiong.

Originally, Xu Zixiong was just lying there like a dead dog. But when he heard that sound, he used all his power to roll to the side.

Qin Feng flew right by him, bouncing off the ground and heading toward a boulder. However, that boulder already had a large notch in it, so he simply slid through that path instead of smashing into it.

Seeing Xu Zixiong and Qin Feng’s states, Bai Xiaole got goosebumps. This was too ruthless.

He had previously felt resentment toward his father for the beatings. But now, he no longer hated his father. Seeing Qin Feng treat him even more ruthlessly, his father’s methods no longer seemed all that ruthless.

Xu Zixiong had originally only reached the forty-ninth step. But when he saw Qin Feng charging up as if his life was on the line, he was also affected and started trying to draw out his potential.

In these few days, Xu Zixiong had started to awaken his slumbering primal bloodline thanks to the honing and his own efforts.

He was aware of how his power was soaring with every step he could progress. This daily improvement shocked him, and he himself didn’t quite dare to believe it.

“You should take a rest. Don’t kill yourself.” Qin Feng got up, covered in blood. His face had many cuts on it from smashing into the staircase, but he was still lively. This Honing Heavenly Staircase was practically a priceless treasure.

Qin Feng wasn’t worried about himself, but he did worry about Xu Zixiong. After all, the latter had just started to awaken his primal bloodline. If he overestimated himself, he would injure his body. Going too far was just as bad as not going far enough.

“Brother Feng, I can still hold on. You can continue. Don’t let me hold you up,” said Xu Zixiong, struggling to stand, his face also bloody.

“Don’t use up all your willpower in one go. Perseverance is even more important than explosive power. After all, you’ll have many chances to fight as if your life depends on it. Take things step by step,” urged Qin Feng. He then charged up the Honing Heavenly Staircase once more.

With Qin Feng already going up, Xu Zixiong adjusted his condition and also went up. Qin Feng quickly reached Bai Xiaole’s position. Seeing Bai Xiaole’s expression, Qin Feng couldn’t help smiling.

“You aren’t a body cultivator, so the Honing Heavenly Staircase will be harder for you to climb. There’s no need to compare yourself to us. We don’t have that talent of yours, so we have no choice but to fight with our lives on the line. There is nothing to compare here. Calmly try to comprehend the power of the Heavenly Daos,” said Qin Feng.

Bai Xiaole nodded. He was afraid that others would look down on him, hence, Qin Feng’s words made him feel better.

The Luo family’s Honing Heavenly Staircase was usually only open for the Luo family’s disciples. It was used to activate their violet blood, so it had high requirements for a person’s physical body. On the other hand, Bai Xiaole’s physical body was weak. For him to have climbed up until here was quite astonishing.

Xu Zixiong also quickly passed him, leaving Bai Xiaole in last place again. Clenching his teeth, Bai Xiaole stepped toward the next stair.

As a result, as soon as his foot landed on it, a powerful current struck him. Startled, Bai Xiaole tried to stabilize himself, but he couldn’t stop his body from falling back. In that instant, he felt like his heart had stopped beating.

If he fell like those two, then with his physical body, he would be crushed. Just as he panicked, a hand pressed onto his shoulder, stabilizing Bai Xiaole’s tilting body instantly. He turned back and cried out, “Boss!”

The one who had come was Long Chen. Long Chen smiled at him. “Not bad. You actually reached this level. It’s beyond my expectations.”

Hearing that praise, Bai Xiaole was delighted. Long Chen’s praise was a supreme glory to him.

“However, don’t use your body to forcibly climb. The Honing Heavenly Staircase is filled with profundities. Try to sense the spatial energy here, and corroborate your own spatial energy with this place. It’s not a case of the higher you climb, the greater your gains. You have to comprehend the experience as well. This will increase your comprehension of spatial energy,” said Long Chen.

“Yes, boss. I understand!” said Bai Xiaole.

Long Chen nodded. Although Bai Xiaole was a bit foolish and childish, when he needed willpower and perseverance, he could bring them out. He wasn’t afraid of suffering hardship. Combining this trait with his good talent, he would definitely grow up into a capable person.

Long Chen quickly reached the eightieth stair. Xu Zixiong had just charged up to that stair, and in the face of that terrifying pressure, he was kneeling on the ground.

Long Chen patted him on the shoulder as encouragement. This fellow had started to transform. A good start was very important.

In just a few days, Xu Zixiong’s aura had completely changed, and that showed that he truly had the determination to get stronger. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When Long Chen reached the ninety-first stair, Qin Feng had just managed to stabilize himself there. He was standing tall.

Long Chen was also proud of him. Every Dragonblood warrior was outstanding. Qin Feng had actually figured out the crux of the Honing Heavenly Staircase. He was absorbing the power of heaven and earth to resist its pressure. Although it was just the slightest trace, it was what allowed him to stand here.

It had to be known that Luo Zichuan had sent Long Chen tumbling down the Honing Heavenly Staircase many times, and Long Chen was still like an oaf charging up, forcibly resisting the power of the Honing Heavenly Staircase. Using Luo Zichuan’s words, there was no cure for his foolishness.

Teaching people to get closer to the Heavenly Daos was the most important use of the Honing Heavenly Staircase. According to reason, someone who couldn’t use Heavenly Dao energy couldn’t reach the peak. It was like a lake. If you wanted to cross it, you had to know how to swim.

However, Long Chen was a marvel who managed to take a single deep breath and walk across the bottom of the lake to reach the other shore.

Although Luo Zichuan scolded him for being foolish, he was also quite shocked by that accomplishment. Long Chen was the first person in history to break that rule.

However, Qin Feng didn’t have that power, so he had to figure out how to cross properly. As a result, he could comprehend this method faster than Long Chen. Furthermore, he wasn’t rejected by the Heavenly Daos. That was his advantage.

Long Chen could also see that the ninety-first stair was essentially Qin Feng’s limit. His chance of getting to the ninety-second stair was very low. After all, his realm wasn’t high enough.

Long Chen reached the peak. The stone hut was still there, but Luo Zichuan had vanished. For some reason, Long Chen felt a bit lost. Although Luo Zichuan was strict, he was definitely one of the people that he respected the most.

Long Chen sorted out his emotions and calmed down. After that, he took out his pill furnace and the medicinal ingredients. Just as he was preparing to refine pills, some heat came from his left eye. After that, the void shuddered and a black-robed girl appeared in front of him.

“Big brother Long Chen!”
