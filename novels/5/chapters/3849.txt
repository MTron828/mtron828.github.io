Chapter 3838 Chaotic Battle

Yin Changsheng was incensed. He had never been so furious, ever. In this life, when he wanted wind, he got wind. When he wanted rain, he got rain.

Whatever he wanted, no one dared to compete with him. If he wanted to kill someone, that person didn’t even dare to keep on living.

However, he had suffered consecutive losses to Long Chen. This must-have Fusang Tree had actually been broken. Hence, he was furious and directly unleashed his faith energy. A pair of white wings then appeared on his back, glowing with sacred runes. A violent power caused the world to quiver.

Suddenly, the roaring flame qilin’s body also lit up. Its fur vanished, and milky white armor covered it. After that, an irresistible power sent Huo Linger flying.

With Yin Changsheng mobilizing his faith energy, as his contractual beast, his flame qilin was linked to him. After that, Yin Changsheng used his power to let the flame qilin escape from Huo Linger.

The flame qilin roared and was summoned back to Yin Changsheng’s side. It bared its fangs, roaring at Huo Linger furiously.

As for Huo Linger, standing behind Long Chen, she actually stuck out her tongue and licked up the blood around her mouth. That smile of hers was full of excitement. Like a child that had tasted honey, she was savoring this taste.

Upon seeing this, the flame qilin’s fury rose to another level. Huo Linger was quite vicious. In that short moment, she had devoured twenty percent of the flame qilin’s essence blood. This would take half a year to replenish.

If that had continued any longer, all its essence blood might have been sucked away by Huo Linger.

“Die!”

Yin Changsheng howled furiously and attacked with his spear. It struck like lightning as it tore through the void. With the support of his faith energy, even Grand Dao runes were broken and suppressed by him.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen let out a silent shout, and his star diagram appeared behind him. When his seven stars quivered, violet qi filled the world. The ripples of the violet qi were like the waves of a great sea.

When the Seven Star Battle Armor appeared, the ten thousand Daos wailed and the world rocked. The 108,000 stars in his body blazed intensely, each of them shining like suns, unleashing endless light.

After that, power coursed through Long Chen’s body. The Minghong Saber in his hand also rumbled. As this power entered the Minghong Saber, it was like a dry riverbed being filled with water. It practically glowed with life.

BOOM!

Yin Changsheng’s spear stabbed into the Minghong Saber. When they collided, an intense explosion destroyed the ground beneath their feet.

Neither of them held back, so this wild power blew back everything around them. Dirt and rubble filled the air.

“Yin Changsheng, you idiot, are you forcing me to kill you?!” The Nine Underworld Luocha’s furious voice rang out from the distance. She then gave up on attacking Ji Wuming and came flying back.

“Scram, you madwoman! You’re the idiot! If you don’t scram, I’ll kill you together!” Yin Changsheng was different from Ji Wuming. He had never had any ability to endure. Upon seeing her come back and cause more chaos, his own killing intent was triggered.

Although he didn’t understand the Nine Underworld Luocha, he did know that this madwoman had to be crazy if she was capable of changing sides at such a moment. Hence, he couldn’t be bothered trying to talk reasonably with her.

“Idiot! Of the four halls, the Martial God Hall is number one. The Sacred Pill Hall is then ranked second, the Bloodkill Hall third, and my Nine Underworld Hall last. But I’ve long since disliked this ranking. The Bloodkill Hall is a bunch of rogues that never fight. I also challenged you last time, but you refused. I then told you that Long Chen’s life is mine, but you treat my words as nothing more than air. Since that’s the case, we can all fight to the death and decide the real rankings of the four halls!” The Nine Underworld Luocha’s voice grew colder and colder, becoming even more domineering. There was a sinister light in her eyes as those runes flowed within them.

It was entirely the principle of follow me and prosper, defy me and die. It was unknown if it was because killing Long Chen herself was just that important to her, or if it was because of the Asura mark on her forehead making her even more haughty.

“You idiot, those rankings are based on the foundations of the four halls, not based on the power of the disciples! You don’t even know this?! You’re an idiot! Let alone someone who only has a trace of the Asura bloodline, even if you were a true member of the Asura race, you wouldn’t be qualified to be arrogant in front of me! Keep acting this way and the heavenly tomb will be your burial ground!” shouted Yin Changsheng. He ignored her and continued to attack Long Chen.

This time, when he attacked, his flame qilin also moved, attacking Long Chen from behind, right where it was most difficult for him to block.

Seeing this, Long Chen snorted. He didn’t even need to communicate with Huo Linger. She was already swinging the True Fire Sword at the flame qilin.

At this moment, the Nine Underworld Luocha barged into their fight, and everything became chaotic.

Long Chen’s enemies were the Nine Underworld Luocha and Yin Changsheng. Yin Changsheng’s enemies were Long Chen and the Nine Underworld Luocha. And the Nine Underworld Luocha’s targets were also both Long Chen and Yin Changsheng.

Hence, chaos ensued in the form of raging astral winds and exploding Sword Qi. The world grew dark and bright as explosion after explosion erupted.

As the three of them fought, Huo Linger and the flame qilin joined in as well. This chaotic fight actually resulted in none of them daring to unleash a full-power attack for fear of the third person taking advantage.

In Long Chen’s cultivation path, he had either been fighting or on the way to his next fight. But he had never encountered such a situation.

In front of experts like Yin Changsheng and the Nine Underworld Luocha, even someone as strong as Long Chen didn’t dare to be careless. He could only fight conservatively and look for openings.

Yin Changsheng and the Nine Underworld Luocha were peak heavenly geniuses with the support of major powers behind them. They had countless trump cards. Hence, one careless mistake and Long Chen would suffer immensely.

Yin Changsheng and the Nine Underworld Luocha were thinking the same thing as him. With two opponents, they didn’t dare to be careless. They were fighting in a steady fashion, so the question was who could find an opening first.

If any one of them showed an opening, then the other two might instantly grasp it and attack, killing them.

However, these three were true heavenly geniuses, experts who had walked out of the lands of death. As they had immense combat experience, their techniques came out naturally in an unending stream. There were no openings to take advantage of.

None of the three dared to suddenly unleash their power. Thus, they were stuck in a stalemate. It was their first time being in such a senseless situation.

“Hey, what are you three doing? Should I join in for the fun?” Mo Nian’s voice rang out.

“Where is Ji Wuming?” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed.

“That fellow hid himself. I can’t find him,” responded Mo Nian. He was by Yue Xiaoqian’s side, fighting off the devil race and Sacred Pill Hall’s experts. In truth, he was only forced to guard her to prevent Ji Wuming’s sneak attack.

However, even after all this time, Ji Wuming had not made his move. It was a bit odd.

“No, he went down!”

Long Chen suddenly noticed that after the Fusang Tree was ripped out by the roots, it revealed an underground passageway going straight down.

“Fuck, this fellow really is crafty!”

Long Chen’s lightning wings suddenly quivered, and he shot down the passageway like a bolt of lightning. As soon as he entered this passageway, an ancient aura struck him.
