Chapter 4097 Heading to the Fullmoon Race

Xu Changchuan’s lifeless eyes were instantly filled with hope. He hadn’t known Long Chen for long, but he always had a feeling that if Long Chen wanted something done, no one would be able to stop him.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

There was still some time until the Sage King Convention. Long Chen was originally planning on using this time to do something, most likely plundering the Soaring Dragon Company.

That way, he could get money and cause a huge disturbance, which would likely draw the Long clan’s attention. As his father was imprisoned in the Long clan and Long Chen didn’t know what his father’s current situation was like, he had no choice but to use the worst plan. As long as he could make the Long clan afraid enough, they wouldn’t kill his father.

However, he still had a long way until he reached that point. If he went now, Long Aotian would definitely use any means necessary to kill his father.

So, Long Chen’s main goal right now was to become the Sage King Convention’s champion. With the reward, gathering the Dragonblood Legion with his new fame would be easy, and then he would be qualified to demand Long Zhantian’s release from the Long clan.

However, just as he was pondering how to use this half a year’s time, which wasn’t very long or very short, he ended up running into Xu Changchuan.

Concerning the life-forbidden area, he had a bit of knowledge about it. However, many things about this region were taboo and couldn’t be passed through word of mouth, let alone written down.

Because of that, in the High Firmament Academy, every record of the life-forbidden area was very vague. But Long Chen knew that this place definitely hid a heaven-shaking secret.

Since he had run into Xu Changchuan, he naturally wouldn’t reject such an opportunity. Furthermore, sending Xu Changchuan home shouldn’t be too difficult.

As their flying boat sped through the air, Xia Chen set up some formations to prevent them from being tracked. In order to be safe, they even underwent two indeterminate spatial transportations.

After traveling for a while, they stopped to rest in a valley. After all, Xu Changchuan and the Heaven Venerate needed to rest.

While resting, Xu Changchuan stared at Yu Qingxuan multiple times, seemingly wanting to say something but hesitating. In the end, when she started refining pills, he finally asked, “Brother Long, did you end up breaking up with fairy Shishi?”

“No?”

“Then how…?” Xu Changchuan indicated Yu Qingxuan. Even though Yu Qingxuan and Long Chen hadn’t done anything intimate in front of him, just from her warm eyes, he could see her deep love for Long Chen.

“She’s also one of my lovers,” said Long Chen awkwardly.

“And fairy Shishi knows about her?”

“Yes.”

“Damn, brother Long. I want you to know that I admire your martial talent, but I admire this ability of yours even more,” said Xu Changchuan.

“What ability?”

“Your ability to attract the opposite sex! I don’t know why, but I also have this ability. From my youth, those other fellows were jealous of me. But later on, I found that I was only able to attract weaklings. My charm was far weaker against true experts, for example, I pursued Bai Shishi for so long, but she didn’t even pay me the slightest attention. As for the one that I pursued recently, it took me tremendous effort. But you seem to be able to do it with ease. To tell the truth, I am willing to prostrate myself in admiration of this ability of yours,” said Xu Changchuan.

Xu Changchuan was incredibly handsome and possessed an illustrious background, to top it off, his talent was also amazing. It could be said that he was a dream partner for countless women.

It was precisely due to this that he was always like the moon surrounded by stars. That arrogance of his was looked down on by Bai Shishi, so she completely ignored him.

That was quite the blow to Xu Changchuan. Although he didn’t hate Long Chen due to this, he wasn’t happy about it. In the end, he secretly left the academy.

This time, seeing another peerless beauty by Long Chen’s side, and seeing that she only had eyes for him, to the point that Xu Changchuan didn’t think that she had even looked at him, it was another serious blow to him.

It had to be known that with his looks, no matter how prideful the woman, they wouldn’t be able to help but give him a second look whether it was for curiosity or appreciation.

Hearing this, Long Chen was speechless. Xu Changchuan actually ended up admiring him in this regard. Now, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“Brother Changchuan, do you know what the situation inside your race is like?” Long Chen changed the subject.

“Brother Long, don’t worry. My paternal grandfather is the race leader. As I am from the main bloodline with a very pure bloodline, my grandfather dotes on me. So, for these traitors to be trying to kill me on the journey, they are definitely doing it while keeping it secret from my grandfather. Hmph, once he learns of it, not one of them will live,” said Xu Changchuan hatefully.

With this response, Long Chen was much more at ease. If Xu Changchuan wanted to rely on his power to win the position of successor, Long Chen definitely wouldn’t bring so many of his people to take that risk.

After all, this was an internal matter of the Fullmoon race, and Long Chen was a mere outsider who didn’t know the full story. Sending Xu Changchuan to the Fullmoon race was all he wanted to do.

After spending two days recovering, Xu Changchuan and the Heaven Venerate were fully healed. They then set off in the direction that Xu Changchuan indicated.

Originally, Xu Changchuan suggested going around this region. According to him, if they were to go directly to the Fullmoon race, they would definitely encounter layers of blockades.

However, Long Chen had a different opinion. If the Fullmoon race’s leader was on his side, Xu Changchuan’s enemies wouldn’t dare to make too big of a movement.

If Xu Changchuan could think of it, then the other side could definitely think of it too. They were predicting that after Xu Changchuan was hunted, he definitely wouldn’t dare to go straight to the Fullmoon race. Thus, the other paths had to be the ones covered in traps.

Since Long Chen wished to go straight to the Fullmoon race, Xu Changchuan didn’t argue. Although he was a bit worried, he chose to trust Long Chen.

“Boss, there are fluctuations of a formation up ahead.” Xia Chen suddenly stopped the flying boat.

“Is it a probing formation?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes.”

“Can you handle it?”

“Of course it’s no problem.”

“Then let’s go. Everyone else, prepare for battle. We’re barging straight through,” said Long Chen.

“Brother Long, are you sure?” asked Xu Changchuan, surprised.

Originally, he had thought that with Long Chen’s intelligence, he would definitely think of some tricky way of avoiding the other side’s traps. So, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to just charge through.

“I don’t know. But let’s try it!” Long Chen shrugged.

“You…”

Xu Changchuan turned pale. How could such a thing be randomly tried? If they failed, they would lose their lives.

At this time, the flying boat’s runes lit up, causing the entire flying boat to tremble. A powerful pushing feeling then appeared, as if trying to drag them to the earth.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the flying boat accelerated and charged forward. As the image of an arrowhead appeared at the front of the flying boat, they directly pierced through a barrier.

The flying boat was like a sharp blade, instantly piercing eight barriers. With every breach of a barrier, the world dimmed a bit. Once they were through the eight barriers, they saw a giant black gate up ahead. That was the entrance to the Fullmoon race.

Just then, countless terrifying auras rose from within that black gate.
