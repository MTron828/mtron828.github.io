Chapter 4857 Informed

The immense pressure locked on Long Chen. Enraged, he prepared to summon the Earth Cauldron, refusing to believe that the Square Heaven Seal could surpass it even in its weakened state.

His anger seethed even more because Gao Jianli had joined in to suppress him. It was unbelievable... this fellow had used him and then tried to kill him.

However, before Long Chen could act, Xing Wujiang dispelled the pressure. His seal resembled those held by Gao Jianli and the others but glowed with a grand violet-gold hue.

When this seal appeared, the three of them shook, and the pressure on Long Chen instantly vanished. Seeing this scene, Long Chen and Mo Nian stopped what they were about to do, while Gao Jianli and the others’ expressions changed.

Cao Guofeng furiously shouted, “Xing Wujiang, as city lord, are you abusing your position to break the laws of the city?!”

“Long Chen maliciously damaged the star cloud martial stage, stealing the Heaven Saint devil runes. He is most likely a spy from the devil race! Are you not afraid of the Square Heaven Seal’s judgment?!” shouted the master of the Heaven Heart Hall.

Mo Nian mocked, “Ha, the dean of the High Firmament Academy is a spy from the devil race? Can you at least use your brain when you bullshit?”

The Heaven Heart Hall’s master fell silent. She regretted her impulsive words as Mo Nian immediately seized upon them. But having spoken already, she couldn't retract her statement. “So what? The devil race can infiltrate any faction! Who can guarantee he isn’t a spy?!”

Mo Nian was about to retort when Xing Wujiang intervened coldly, “I am the city lord and have the authority to deal with Long Chen. If you don’t like it, feel free to submit an appeal to the Square Heaven Seal. However, I should warn you, no matter how much you covet my position, don’t act arrogant in front of me while I am still the city lord. Otherwise, if I get angry, not even the Square Heaven Seal will be able to protect you.”

“You...!”

Seeing that Xing Wujiang wanted to protect Long Chen at all costs, Cao Guofeng was brimming with fury. If Xing Wujiang wanted to protect Long Chen, there really was nothing they could do.

They had all heard about the recent issue with Xing Wujiang’s health, though it wasn’t apparent at the moment. While Xing Wujiang had no heirs, leaving the position of city lord up for grabs in the future, they could not force him to do anything while he was still city lord. If pushed too far, perhaps he would do something crazy.

“Can the city lord freely break the rules of the city? Although you are the city lord, the laws of Devil Fall City are not decided by you! If you want to change the laws, shouldn’t you ask for your ancestors’ permission?”

Just then, a calm voice rang out, and over ten figures appeared above the martial stage. Thereafter, the temperature rapidly climbed until everyone felt like they were in a furnace.

When Long Chen saw those people, his pupils shrank. Their robes prominently displayed a pill cauldron insignia on the chest, topped by a golden pill resembling a rising sun. The cuffs, collars, and belts of their attire had golden flame designs on them, which were not mere decorations but fearsome runes.

Even in all of Long Chen’s experience, it was his first time witnessing runes woven into fabric on someone’s attire. Typically, runes required strong materials capable of withstanding their inscriptions, which was why they were placed on weapons or armor—items made out of precious metals. Sometimes, they would be inscribed on the bones of experts or at the very least special beast hides. Unfortunately, the latter couldn’t hold some stronger runes.

Yet, the robes of these individuals displayed remarkably potent runes, highlighting the extraordinary quality of their clothing.

“The Brahma Pill Valley?”

Yu Luo’s pupils contracted as she hadn’t expected the Brahma Pill Valley to send sixteen Heaven Saints to Devil Fall City. Furthermore, based on their attitude, it seemed that they had come to restrict Xing Wujiang.

Surprised by their presence, Xing Wujiang's tone turned cold as he asked, “Devil Fall City has no dealings with the Brahma Pill Valley. Why are you here? Are you intending to meddle in the competition for the city lord position?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Amongst the Brahma Pill Valley experts, one lanky, middle-aged man with a pale face stepped forward, shaking his head. “Let me introduce myself. I am Jiang Yiban from Brahma Pill Valley's Flame Divine Hall, serving as a hall protector of the Blood Department. I typically handle sensitive matters for our sect. We have no interest in your city lord position. We simply received a report from Sect Master Gao Jianli, so we came to arrest Long Chen.”

His final words caused everyone’s attention to turn to Gao Jianli, who seethed with fury.

They had agreed to keep his relationship with the Brahma Pill Valley secret. But unexpectedly, Jiang Yiban stated it outright in front of everyone, causing everyone to know that he was the informant.

“Sect Master...” Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu stared at Gao Jianli in shock.

With a flat face, Gao Jianli retorted, “Long Chen is a wanted criminal, and the Brahma Pill Valley has always supported the Violet Palace Sect with their medicinal pills. Helping them arrest a criminal is a minor matter not worth mentioning.”

Gao Jianli’s words fueled Long Chen’s anger, so he mocked, “Only someone lacking a complete face could utter such shameless words. Aren't you afraid the Violet Palace Sect will be ruined by groveling at the feet of the Brahma Pill Valley?”

A vein throbbed on Gao Jianli’s forehead as Long Chen’s words struck him right where it hurt. Indeed, half of his face was gone, ravaged by a terrifying devil creature. It was a wound that despite countless years and attempts, remained unhealed.

As a result, he was extremely sensitive toward this. Anyone who dared to laugh at him would be mercilessly slaughtered. Even the slightest whisper or strange glance his way would result in severe consequences, either directly by his hand or through his subordinates.

In truth, if Gao Jianli wore a special mask, no one would be able to see his ugly face. However, he refused to do so. He wanted others to acknowledge him yet was also afraid of them mocking him. This internal conflict tormented him, leaving him unable to escape its grasp.

By saying that Gao Jianli didn’t have a complete face, Long Chen was intentionally picking at that scab in front of everyone in Devil Fall City, triggering his killing intent.

“You damn son of a bitch, you’ll pay the price for that mouth of yours!” roared Gao Jianli.

“Before I pay the price, I’ll cut off your head!” Long Chen's fury surged in response. He would not tolerate anyone insulting his parents. With a fierce resolve, he swung Evilmoon directly at Gao Jianli.
