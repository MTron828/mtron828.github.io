Chapter 4845 The Feather Spirit Race’s Origins

“The Feather Spirit race split off from the Feather race. What is it?” replied Yu Luo, curious about Long Chen’s odd expression.

When Long Chen heard this, his expression sank. “That’s a bit awkward. I’m not a big fan of the Feather race.”

Previously, when the four Protector Elder’s auras erupted, Long Chen seemed to sense a familiar aura, reminiscent of that of the Feather race.

Long Chen noticed the similarity as he had clashed with the Feather race multiple times, and each time, he ended up killing quite a few of them. Long Chen felt a bit uneasy, so he wanted Yu Luo to confirm it, and as expected, what he feared came true. The Feather Spirit race was indeed a branch of the Feather race.

With a smile, Yu Luo said, “You don’t need to worry. We have fully cut off our ties with the Feather race. There is only enmity between us.”

“There’s such a thing?” Long Chen felt relieved.

Yu Luo quickly told Long Chen a story about their past. The Feather race was once an enormous force—natural divine archers with shocking killing power. Adding on their various talents, the Feather race became a very domineering race.

Once a race grew powerful, they were unwilling to remain in their small corner of the world. They naturally started expanding, killing other lifeforms and taking the land and resources.

Of course, due to their rapid expansion, they ended up clashing with other major factions. Countless battles erupted, and due to the Feather race making too many enemies, they were quickly overwhelmed and slaughtered.

As a result, the Feather race took hideous losses. They could only flee and hide from their enemies.

In particular, one branch of the Feather race managed to flee to the Butterfly Spirit race’s minor world. The kind Butterfly Spirit race then helped them recover, providing them with various nourishments. Whatever they wanted, the Butterfly Spirit race readily provided.

In this peaceful environment, the Feather race quickly recovered. After a few thousand years of growth, they grew increasingly powerful.

Finally, one day, they set their sights on the Butterfly Spirit race’s mother tree, wanting to use the mother tree’s branches to create a new kind of divine arrow. However, the docile Butterfly Spirit race firmly rejected this idea.

This rejection angered the head of the Feather race. After that, they schemed to slaughter the Butterfly Spirit race and take over all their resources, including the mother tree.

This proposal then caused huge waves in the Feather race. Many of them were against this proposal, and eventually the race split into two sides.

One side was grateful to the Butterfly Spirit race and said that it was completely savage to betray such a kind race, while the other side wanted to take all the Butterfly Spirit race’s resources as that was the fastest way to revive the Feather race, saying that it was an opportunity bestowed upon them by the heavens.

As a result, tensions between these factions escalated into a bloody conflict, culminating in a massive war. The leader of the Feather race was ultimately slain, and those who harbored bad intentions toward the Butterfly Spirit race were eradicated. However, this victory was short-lived as the Feather race swiftly plummeted from their newfound prosperity back to the brink of extinction.

It was during this critical time that the Butterfly Spirit race’s mother tree appeared. It told the survivors that the kindness in their hearts had beaten their greed and dark side. This pivotal moment heralded the birth of a new race.

The mother tree bestowed these members of the Feather race with a special divine rune. From that moment on, the Feather Spirit race was born, and they became the protectors of the Butterfly Spirit race.

The Feather Spirit race was a race existing between the Feather race and the Spirit race, embodying both good and bad sides. They were kind toward the Butterfly Spirit race while showing hostility toward their enemies—those who posed a threat to the Butterfly Spirit race.

Thus, when Long Chen came to their land, he only felt their good side, trust, and sincerity. However, once they left their sacred mountain, Yu Luo seemed to become an entirely different person.

The Feather race was originally a very powerful race. With the mother race’s blessing, they started worshiping their own divine tree, producing their unique divine abilities. They were an entirely unique race now, and so they had no relationship with the Feather race.

With the blood of the Feather race in their veins, they also felt a fearless desire to kill. However, they were able to restrain themselves, showing this desire only to their enemies.

In order to support Long Chen, Yu Luo feared no one, not because the Feather Spirit race was truly so strong that they could ignore everyone else, but because of the warlike blood in their veins.

“That’s great. Now, I feel much better. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know how to explain myself after killing so many people of the Feather race,” sighed Long Chen, feeling a weight off his shoulders.

At this moment, Yu Luo grew solemn. “Long Chen, Cao Shaoqing is not weak. After enduring your slap, Cao Guofeng may have equipped him with special treasures to ensure your defeat. They must have devised a scheme. This stage is linked to the Square Heaven Seal. Once it activates, we will not be able to interfere in your battle, so you cannot underestimate your opponent.”

“Don’t worry. I have confidence in myself. It's not arrogance; it's my belief that all schemes are futile against absolute power,” replied Long Chen confidently.

“It’s too bad that I’m still injured, or I wouldn’t let you be the only one showing off here,” grumbled Mo Nian.

His injuries had mostly recovered thanks to the divine tree’s help, but he was still a bit away from his peak condition. He was a bit unhappy with how much Long Chen was standing out.

“There’s no rush. Once you’ve recovered, I’ll leave Cao Guofeng to you. I definitely won’t fight over him with you,” replied Long Chen with a smile.

Just as he said this, the nearby spectator platform lit up, and Long Chen saw the enraged Cao Guofeng appear.

Seeing him glaring over sinisterly, Long Chen felt like he would have been cut to pieces if looks could kill. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What are you looking at? Do you want Daddy Mo to slap your face too?” taunted Mo Nian.

“You little brutes. Just you wait. I want to see how long you can keep acting arrogant!” exclaimed Cao Guofeng through gritted teeth.

“Hmph, a little Heaven Saint dares to act arrogant in front of me? I’m still recovering from my injuries, but I can still blow you away with a fart!” sneered Mo Nian.

“Bullshit!” raged Cao Guofeng.

“Are you not afraid of being blasted to death?” asked Mo Nian.

Cao Guofeng shot up in rage, but a few elders by his side dragged him back. Someone directly activated the viewing platform’s barrier to block off other sounds.

“Tch, he’s already exploding after a few insults. How worthless, peh!” Mo Nian scoffed scornfully.

Just then, the platform on the other side also lit up. When a new group of figures appeared, Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu hastily bowed.

“Greetings, Sect Master!”
