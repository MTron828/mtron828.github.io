Chapter 3297 Establishing the Altar

“I said that after this matter, every person would be given a dragon egg. Now, all sides are satisfied.” Long Chen had Bai Xiaole take out four devil dragon eggs.

Bai Xiaole had a pained expression, but since Long Chen had said it, he had no choice but to do this painful thing that was like cutting off a piece of his own flesh. He gave the four dragon eggs to them.

The four of them were all excited to obtain these dragon eggs. It had to be known that once these eggs hatched and matured, that would be a Spirit tier Immortal King mount.

“Once this dragon matures, I’ll leave the Vile Dragon Domain,” said the Iron Blood Mercenary Group’s leader very directly.

That startled everyone, but they quickly understood that he was looking for peace. His meaning was that once his dragon matured, he would also have reached the Spirit tier. With that kind of power, why would he stay in a broken place like this? He could find any mountain and establish his own sect. Wouldn’t being a sect master be good?

“I’m the same.” The Blood Drinking Alliance’s leader nodded.

“With power, who would stay here? I’m going to find a powerful husband and research how to make children.” Jiang Yuhe also expressed her wish, but this time, she didn’t use Long Chen as the butt of her joke. That battle had shown her that Long Chen was an absolutely terrifying figure that couldn’t be provoked.

“I really envy you. Even if I have power, I can only stay and die here.” Zhao Qinglong bitterly smiled.

He had offended the Bloodkill Hall. So, even with a devil dragon, he didn’t dare to leave the Vile Dragon Domain. The others expressed sympathy for him. After having escaped death, even Jiang Yuhe’s hatred for him had lessened.

Although the four of them had obtained the Spirit King Pills and dragon eggs, they had lost their vice leaders. So, the four of them all wanted a time of peace for them to cultivate and raise their new housepets. 

“Everyone, don’t worry. After going through something like that, we don’t have to be so hostile to each other. We can all get along peacefully. There’s no need to block each other,” declared Zhao Qinglong.

He also expressed his attitude. Since they all wanted to leave, then this domain would be ruled by him. As they no longer had any conflicts, he directly made a verbal agreement.

As a result, the four of them were all relieved. All of them were in similar positions, and they didn’t want to waste any precious time.

“Junior brother, I really have to thank you this time.” Jiang Yuhe turned to Long Chen.

“No need. You’ve helped me out immensely this time. Without you, there might have been another conclusion,” said Long Chen.

Although these four didn’t seem to be useful, without them leading the way, without them helping capture that black dragon, perhaps that tiny bit of power missing would have been the cause of a complete collapse.

“How can you say that? Riches are found in danger. If you want to gain something, you must pay something. Brother, if you need anything in the future, just ask,” said Zhao Qinglong.

After bearing witness to Long Chen’s terrifying power, the four of them all wanted a good relationship with him. That would only benefit them.

Long Chen smiled. That was precisely the sucking up that he had been waiting for. “It just so happens that I do have something I want to ask everyone’s help for.”

“Please go ahead and say it!” said Zhao Qinglong.

Long Chen said, “You also know that I am the dean of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch academy. However, this time, you also saw that taking back our territory is impossible… Cough, well, what I mean is that it will require some effort.” Long Chen seemed to have misspoken. He hastily said, “I will definitely come back to the seventh branch academy, especially in the near future.”

Upon hearing this, the four of their expressions changed. Long Chen hastily waved his hand. “Don’t worry, I definitely won’t make the four of you go through any danger.”

Only then did the four of them sigh with relief. Having won back their lives this time, they didn’t want to take any more risks in their lifetime.

The Devil Eye Water Lily and the black devil dragons were their nightmares. They wanted to forget about them for the rest of their lives. Hence, asking them to do something like this again was no different than asking for their lives.

“You just need to organize some people and build an altar here. Offer sacrifice every day, with a major ceremony occurring every half a month. The more solemn, the better. It would be best if all your subordinates could participate,” said Long Chen.

They were left dumbfounded. They hadn’t expected Long Chen to request such a thing from them. Jiang Yuhe asked, “What are we sacrificing?”

“Use the bones of devil beasts. Place them on the altar and burn them,” said Long Chen.

“Burn them?”

They were even more confused. Sacrifices weren’t burnt. Normally, sacrificial offerings required some kind of divine energy, and the altar would absorb them. As a result, different altars required different sacrifices.

Long Chen wanted them to sacrifice bones and then burn them on the altar? What was that supposed to mean? In all their years, they had never heard of such a sacrificial ceremony.

But they also weren’t in a convenient position to ask. They only started getting to work according to Long Chen’s arrangements. As a result, the altar was already finished on the second day. After that, the four of them almost laughed.

How was this a sacrificial altar? It was clearly a pyre, basically a stove. They held back bitter smiles, not daring to say anything for fear of getting Long Chen angry. They had to act very curious, saying that they had never seen anything so mysterious and amazing. In any case, all kinds of fawning words were thrown his way. It wasn’t as if those words cost them anything.

Long Chen had them take out some devil beast skeletons and put them on the wooden frame. They were then directly set on fire. These beast skeletons were quite tough, and the fire only charred them a bit.

After that, Long Chen solemnly walked two loops around the altar, murmuring something. He then had everyone walk around the altar as well three times. Inside their hearts, they were holding back countless questions. After the bones were charred black, they were thrown away, and the ceremony was complete. It was very simple, so simple that it felt like someone was playing a joke on them.

However, while everyone was full of questions, no one dared to say anything. If Long Chen wanted them to do this, then they would do it. Every half a month, they would hold an even grander ceremony requiring the participation of ten thousand people at least. Zhao Qinglong directly promised that he would do this.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After that, Long Chen and the others returned to their flying boat to rest. Bai Shishi activated its formation, preventing others from spying on them here.

“Long Chen, what is the point of that altar? I don’t understand anything that you were murmuring either,” asked Bai Shishi. There were no longer any outsiders here. Qin Feng and the others also wanted to know the answer.

“Hehe, I can’t say.” Long Chen chortled, infuriating Bai Shishi to the point of wanting to beat him. But if he refused to say, there was nothing that she could do. Long Chen refused to even say it to the few of them that he could trust. It seemed that this matter had big implications.

“Let’s rest for two more days. If nothing else happens, we’ll prepare to leave,” said Long Chen.

…

Just as Long Chen and the others were resting, in a far-off distant world, two people were conversing in a divine palace.

“Do you know that the High Firmament Academy is preparing to reopen their seventh branch academy? Even the seventh branch academy’s official dean seal has been issued,” said a skinny young man with a golden crown on his head.

He was speaking to a slightly pudgy man. This man was precisely the leader of the Bloodkill Hall that shook the heavens, Enpuda.
