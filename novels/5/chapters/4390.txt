Chapter 4379 Red Fur Heaven Roarer

BOOM!

The dragon claw descended, colliding with the red-haired monster's fist and unleashing divine light brighter than the sun.

Astral winds erupted, propelling Long Chen and the others through the air. However, they were all relieved.

“Who do you think you are to challenge me before becoming a Saint?” The red-haired monster roared with fury upon being blocked. Its claws reached toward the palace master, who had appeared in the sky.

The palace master just sneered, “Your head was blown up by others, and you’re still so arrogant? Do you think your red devil race is that special?”

BOOM!

The palace master blocked its attacks with his fists. The void exploded, and Grand Dao runes whirled. Astonishingly, the palace master was forced back several steps by the force of the clash.

“Die!”

It seemed that the palace master’s words had struck the red-haired monster right where it hurt. It immediately went crazy.

The red-haired monster unleashed a barrage of attacks, repeatedly driving the palace master backward. Tension gripped everyone witnessing the clash—the showdown between the mightiest experts of two worlds. The outcome of this battle would determine the fate of both worlds.

“The palace master can’t lose!” said Guo Ran nervously. The tension in the air was suffocating. The red-haired monster was simply too terrifying, its power surpassing the confines of the Eternal realm. They had really stirred a hornet’s nest this time.

Long Chen transmitted, “Xia Chen, seal the gate to the humanless world. Yes, like-”

BOOM!

Suddenly, a powerful explosion erupted. The palace master’s manifestation burst into existence, and a claw reached out, merging with his own. Finally, he managed to stop the red-haired monster.

“An Eternal body and a Saint soul. So what? I want to fight a real Saint.” The palace master seemed like a different person now. His Blood Qi soared, filling this world with its aura.

Seeing this scene, Guo Ran and the others cheered excitedly. It seemed that the palace master had only been acting weak before. Now, he was showing his true power.

“Idiot! A Saint’s soul can transcend tiers and control the ten thousand Daos. It’s a power that you can’t imagine!” roared the red-haired monster.

“What I can’t imagine is how a Saint’s head was destroyed by a group of World Kings,” sneered the palace master.

“You… die!” The red-haired monster’s face twisted. It extended a hand, and the runes of the ten thousand Daos merged together into a spear that pierced toward the palace master.

“I’m not the one with my head gone, so why would I die?”

BOOM!

The palace master’s fist smashed into the spear, blasting it apart. From the point of impact, a ripple that shattered the world spread, scaring everyone else into fleeing even further.

“Shut up!” The red-haired monster was driven crazy with fury. As it repeatedly formed hand seals, devil qi burst forth from all directions. Following that, an enormous lifeform resembling a liger covered in red hair appeared.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

On the other hand, the red-haired monster vanished, transforming into a humanoid rune that merged onto the forehead of this new red-furred creature.

BOOM!

The liger roared, its voice shaking the world, causing terrifying cracks to appear in the void. The sheer force of its roar almost led to the collapse of the entire world.

This monster was enormous. On all fours, its belly reached above the clouds, and when it lifted its head, it seemed to breach the heavens. It emitted a terrifying pressure that forced even Long Chen to retreat, his soul shaking under the oppressive force.

“He also knows a merger art?” Bai Xiaole was shocked. This technique was similar to his merger art with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

“That creature is the Red Fur Heaven Roarer, a devil beast of the primal chaos era and also a mortal enemy of the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox. No wonder I felt such a chill when I first saw that red-haired monster. Its contractual beast is actually my mortal enemy. Hmph, if I were stronger, I definitely wouldn’t let it off,” the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox said, waving its claws in disdain.

“Old fellow, why did you interrupt my seclusion? Do you not know that I’m at a critical juncture?!” The Red Fur Heaven Roarer let out a heaven-shaking roar, its voice filled with fury as it questioned the red-haired monster.

“I know. But you won’t suffer any loss. Do you see that little fellow?” asked the red-haired monster.

The Red Fur Heaven Roarer looked down, and its enormous eyes lit up upon spotting the palace master.

“A pureblooded black barbarian dragon? Where did you find him?”

“Ignore how I found him. Eat him, and it’ll be better than being in seclusion for a million years. If I wasn’t injured, I’d devour him myself. You’re getting an advantage now,” said the red-haired monster.

Being from the red devil race, the red-haired monster had a deep history with the Red Fur Heaven Roarer race. It was rumored that they shared a common origin, so both races often formed contracts with each other and were capable of utilizing a merger art.

Moreover, both the red devil race and the Red Fur Heaven Roarer race possessed a potent and malevolent divine ability—the power to devour experts to enhance their own strength.

This was also why this monster was capable of becoming a Saint in the humanless world. It had devoured many Eternal experts in order to break through, establishing itself as the king of the humanless world. As a result, many individuals refrained from attempting breakthroughs out of fear of being devoured. It was only after he went into seclusion that they dared to make their breakthroughs. With its absence, the humanless world entered a glorious era.

The descendants of the red-haired monster had always been the commanders of the humanless world. However, even they didn’t dare to disturb it out of seclusion. They could only let Long Chen kill some of their experts, using the resentment unleashed during their deaths to attract the attention of the red-haired monster.

As a result, the red-haired monster came out of seclusion of its own volition and couldn’t blame any of them. After all, no one would be able to endure its wrath if they were blamed.

However, due to being careless, its head was destroyed by the Earth Cauldron. While such an injury wouldn’t kill it, it did cause its power to plummet. Unable to freely unleash its power, it was forced to summon its contractual devil beast.

In truth, it was also unwilling to give up on the palace master’s flesh and blood. However, there was no other way. In its weakened state, it couldn’t do anything to the palace master, so it could only send this gift to its contractual beast.

“Hahaha, good. Then I won’t blame you. This little barbarian dragon can save me a million years.”

The Red Fur Heaven Roarer laughed, its voice echoing throughout the world. The entire Nirvana Overflow Heaven could hear its laugh.

“Two suicidal idiots. If I don’t break your dog heads, you will never know what kind of existence the great dragon race is.” The palace master’s voice was icy and dark, coming from the cracks between his teeth. Their conversation had clearly enraged him.

“Barbarian Dragon Manifestation!” The palace master let out a resounding roar and disappeared. The next moment, the heavens ruptured, and darkness enveloped the very world. An immense dragon stretched across the sky, its wild Blood Qi flooding the sea of stars.
