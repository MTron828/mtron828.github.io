Chapter 4894 The Early Bird Catches the Worm

The Earth Cauldron opened, but no medicinal pill came flying out, nor was there anything like the pill transforming into some divine beast. The fist-sized “rock” just floated in the air.

“This is…?”

If Long Chen hadn’t personally witnessed it, he would have suspected that someone had taken his pill and replaced it with a rock to trick him. He then reached out to grab it.

The moment his hand came into contact with it, white smoke erupted, and a bone-chilling coldness spread across his entire arm, encasing it in frost. Long Chen hastily circulated his energy to resist, but the frost quickly enveloped his entire body, turning him into an ice statue.

BOOM!

The frost suddenly exploded, revealing Long Chen once more. Yet, the relentless cold immediately encased his arm in frost again.

“What is going on?!” exclaimed Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron explained, “This is the effect of Heavenly Yin Water. Don’t forget that it’s a supreme Yin entity. Then, through Yin comes Yang. Once it touches a powerful flame, it will release an intense frost. The Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill is considered a supreme Yang pill. Without Heavenly Yin energy keeping it in balance, the pill can’t condense. Only the Heavenly Yin Water’s energy is able to stabilize the pill and lock its essence inside. The rock-like appearance you see is the Heavenly Yin Water. All the impurities within the pill were forced out to form this pill cloth. However, this is no ordinary pill cloth. It contains a natural Heavenly Yin formation that’s keeping the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill in a quiet slumber. Without it, the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill can’t be stored.”

Hearing this explanation, Long Chen sighed in amazement. The world was truly enormous, with many things to explore. Before this, he had only known that Heavenly Yin Water was precious, but he hadn’t understood its full potential or how to use it.

“Is there a way to tell the grade or the appearance of this pill?” asked Long Chen. The rocky exterior was ice-cold, and his divine sense couldn’t pierce it. He had no idea what was going on inside.

“There is no way to tell. If you forcefully scan inside, you will damage the Heavenly Yin formation. Then you have to immediately consume it because once the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill awakes, consuming it will be no different from suicide,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

“You’re saying we can’t even tell what kind of pill it is before I consume it? If it’s too weak or too strong, wouldn’t that mean…”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Earth Cauldron remarked, “We can only gamble when it comes to this. However, based on my experience, the medicinal effect will definitely not be lacking. As for how strong it is, I don’t dare to say. But when it comes to whether or not you can endure it, I feel like it shouldn’t be a problem. It was refined from your essence blood. As long as you consume the pill while it hasn’t awakened, you will be able to summon the strongest Dragon Blood Battle Armor. As a life-saving trump card, I feel like it’s definitely not bad.

“Although you have many trump cards, with your power right now, you cannot control them. For example, you might have refined the astral bone claw, but you cannot unleash its full power. It’s the same case with the nine star secret art you learned from the Stone Spirit’s rock. With your power, you cannot endure the impact of that technique. These two trump cards will be useful to you in the future, but now, the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill is more useful.”

Long Chen nodded. The Earth Cauldron’s deduction was extremely accurate. The astral bone claw was strong, but once he used it, it would exhaust all the astral energy within it. After all, it was a single-use item.

As for the God Slaying Cross[1], that was a technique he was incapable of using right now. Even though he had comprehended it, he didn’t dare to try it. Right now, the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill was what he needed the most.

Long Chen put the “rock” away. After resting for a moment, he used a transportation formation to bring him back to where he had encountered the Ghost Nether Rat King.

Examining his surroundings, he didn’t find anything off. It seemed that no one else had come here, so he continued deeper into the grassland.

Meanwhile, the Earth Cauldron and Huo Linger were in the primal chaos space, helping him refine the essence blood of the Ghost Nether Rats. According to the Earth Cauldron, although their essence blood was not as powerful as that of the Rat King, the Heavenly Yin Water refined from them was the same.

The amount of Heavenly Yin Water they could refine from this large amount of essence blood would ultimately be equal to what they refined from the Rat King. However, it would take much longer to do so.

With the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill in his pocket, Long Chen no longer bothered concealing his presence at all. He directly spread his lightning wings and sped off.

However, he didn’t encounter more Ghost Nether Rats. Most likely, there weren’t that many rat holes all over this sinister grassland.

As Long Chen continued onward, the strange grass grew increasingly tall. In the end, they were as tall as trees, and the sinister qi in the air also got denser. However, after he flew for a bit, the grassland was no more to be seen, replaced by a barren land.

Upon reaching this barren land, Long Chen found that he could no longer fly. It seemed that there was some law sticking him to the ground. 

“There are footsteps!”

Long Chen noted two sets of footprints in the distance, so he hastily rushed over to find that one of them still had devil qi remaining on it. This set of footprints was most likely left behind by a devil expert who had taken human form.

“So the devil race managed to sneak in…” Long Chen’s sense of alarm went off. After all, the opening of Heaven Screen Mountain required the Square Heaven Seal’s power, and Devil Fall City had always been the enemy of the devil race.

In the past openings of Heaven Screen Mountain, every participant was screened heavily to prevent members of the devil race from sneaking in. But this time, the opening of Heaven Screen Mountain was extremely rushed, without limits on the number of participants. As a result, they couldn’t properly screen everyone, and some devil experts managed to sneak their way in.

The other set of footprints seemed to belong to an actual human. Long Chen then examined their footprints and found that the two of them had come at different times.

The devil expert had come first, followed by the human. Including Long Chen’s own tracks, there were three sets of footprints. Curiously, all three had approached from the same direction.

The previous grassland had seemed completely endless, stretching far beyond the horizon. However, all three had arrived here from the same direction. That was too much of a coincidence.

“Interesting.”

However, Long Chen didn’t waste much time thinking about it. He simply followed their footprints and didn’t even bother covering his own tracks.

The further Long Chen went, the more he felt that something was off. This area gave off a stench of rotting flesh. Long Chen then grabbed a chunk of soil and tossed it into the primal chaos space’s black soil. In an instant, it was devoured.

“The soil consists of decomposing corpses…”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the ground beneath Long Chen’s feet shuddered, and a powerful divine might soared.
