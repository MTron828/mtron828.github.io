Chapter 4650 Desolate Barbarian Race

BOOM!

A sword materialized in front of the massive saber, intercepting it. At some point, a Dragonblood warrior had stepped forward to confront the attacker.

Despite the overwhelming display of Blood Qi and Doyen power from the attacker, the ordinary Dragonblood warrior stood resolute.

“Is it so bad to live a peaceful life?” asked that Dragonblood warrior as he shook his head. Suddenly, he vanished, shocking that lifeform. As the lifeform hastily retreated, his head separated from his body mid-motion. Despite his efforts to retreat into his people’s camp, only his body did so; his head didn’t manage to follow him.

The Dragonblood warrior calmly sheathed his sword, signifying the end of the battle. Moments later, the lifeform’s head landed on the ground, and his headless corpse collapsed as well.

His people were both shocked and enraged by the sudden turn of events. They knew that Long Chen and the others weren’t pushovers, but they thought that everything would be alright as they possessed a powerful background as well.

Since it was evident that Long Chen was the leader, they immediately targeted him. However, unexpectedly, an ordinary warrior had defeated one of them in one move.

In other words, over seven thousand people in this place were no weaker than them; they weren’t worth shit in front of the Dragonblood Legion.

“How brazen! You dare to provoke the Desolate Barbarian race?! Report your name!” shouted one of them.

“The Desolate Barbarian race?”

When they heard that name, Guo Ran and the others’ expressions changed. Seeing that, those experts of the Desolate Barbarian race instantly grew arrogant, thinking that Long Chen and his companions were scared.

“Boss...” Guo Ran and the others looked at Long Chen.

“The Barbarian race has many branches. Some are evil, and some are good. Just looking at them, it’s obvious that they’re not one of the good ones. Wilde is from the noble Blood Barbarian race and has no connection with them. Don’t worry,” said Long Chen.

He knew what they were worried about. If these people were Wilde’s, things would be awkward when they met Wilde again.

Long Chen could also tell that they were from the Barbarian race. However, contrary to Wilde, their Blood Qi was full of bloodthirst and violence. It was the exact opposite of Wilde’s kind and simple-hearted nature. Hence, Long Chen didn’t believe that they had any close relationship.

As a result, he had not even thought about stopping that Dragonblood warrior from killing one of them. In fact, he didn’t even care about their origins.

“Blood Barbarian?”

When the Desolate Barbarians heard those two words, their expressions changed.

“We’re leaving!”

They actually grabbed the corpse on the ground and dejectedly left just like that.

“Hehe, my power can match that of an eight-star Doyen. I like it!” expressed that Dragonblood warrior, once they left.

Just now, they had been shocked by these people’s powerful Blood Qi and Doyen power, not even aware that they had also reached the same level.

“Boss, let’s undergo tribulation together! We’re all ready!” said Gu Yang excitedly.

The others also had looks of anticipation. Only by going through the baptism of heavenly tribulation could they fully digest their gains from the dragon nest. Once they reached the Divine Venerate realm, they would truly reach the ranks of this world’s top experts.

“This is your tribulation,” corrected Long Chen.

“Boss, you’re not undergoing tribulation with us?” Guo Ran and the others were disappointed.

“Not this time. I’ve accumulated too much karma, and I’d only bring you down if we went through tribulation together. I’ll guard you during your tribulation, and then I’ll need your help afterward,” replied Long Chen solemnly.

Long Chen had a premonition that all the terrifying karmas he had accumulated would be settled during this upcoming tribulation. Last time, he nearly died in his tribulation. If it hadn’t been for his father’s aid and Aunt Gong’s encouragement, he definitely would have died.

Those incidents could be considered cheating. Those kinds of little tricks weren’t necessarily a good thing. Unresolved karma from such actions might manifest in his upcoming tribulation. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Long Chen was determined to confront his upcoming tribulation head-on and resolve everything by his own means. While the tribulation sought to test and challenge him, he aimed to overcome it decisively.

He had a feeling that this upcoming tribulation would be exceptionally difficult, so he didn’t dare to let his brothers go through it with him.

“Start!”

Gu Yang took a deep breath. Everyone from the Dragonblood Legion was in their peak condition, their bodies pulsating with an indomitable energy. Suddenly, it seemed as though something within them shattered, releasing a surge of power that surged forth like a raging tsunami, climbing until their auras scoured the heavens.

The world shuddered, and distant experts undergoing tribulation turned their attention toward them, their movements slowing as astonishment painted their faces. Their jaws dropped in disbelief at the overwhelming might emanating from the Dragonblood Legion.

Although collective tribulation wasn’t something unique here, they had never seen over seven thousand people undergoing tribulation at once. Hell, they hadn’t even heard of such a thing.

“Bastards, if you’ve gotten tired of living, don’t drag us down with you!” roared those experts, flustered. In their minds, this was clearly suicide.

Just then, tribulation clouds exploded, resembling a stampede of thousands of wild horses and the convergence of countless rivers rushing toward the sea. They all gathered toward the Dragonblood Legion.

Those experts in the distance were shocked to find their own tribulations weakening. It was as though their tribulation clouds were like obedient soldiers who, upon hearing a summons, abandoned their charges to converge upon the Dragonblood warriors.

Witnessing this phenomenon, those experts on the brink of completing their tribulations erupted into cheers. The departure of their tribulation clouds indicated that they had successfully overcome their tribulations.

For most people, the first half of tribulation was to absorb thunderforce to strengthen their bodies and souls, while the latter half was the real test. If you could pass that, you would pass your tribulation.

The experts who had absorbed as much thunderforce as they could from the first half of their tribulations were overjoyed by this sudden turn of events. They no longer had to endure the risk of the latter half.

However, those who had just started cursed the Dragonblood Legion furiously. If their heavenly tribulation was gone, they wouldn’t have any thunderforce to absorb. Their tribulation clouds were like baby sheep called away by their mother.

The Dragonblood Legion’s collective tribulation gathered all the tribulation clouds for billions of miles. As a result, countless experts were chasing after their tribulation clouds in a panic.

The tribulation clouds grew so thick that they felt like the heavens were about to collapse.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the tribulation clouds quivered, and a torrent of lightning descended. Upon seeing that lightning, countless people were terrified. They had never seen such terrifying lightning before.

After all, this was only the very first wave of the tribulation, and the subsequent waves would intensify, potentially more than tenfold. This was completely fatal.

“Attack!”

When this lightning crashed down, everyone in the distance was stunned to see the Dragonblood warriors roar and charge straight up toward the tribulation clouds.

“Wha-...?”

The experts watching this scene felt their eyes almost pop out of their sockets.
