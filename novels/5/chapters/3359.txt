Chapter 3348 Heaven-Defying Heavenly Dao Tree

The Heavenly Dao Tree was different from before. It had grown, and the patterns on its leaves were different. But even after growing, its limit was still nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine fruits.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, it could also only bear that many fruits. However, among these fruits, some were different. There were exactly nine hundred and ninety-nine of such fruit, not one more and not one less.

They had some strange marks on them, and their auras were different. Long Chen stared in amazement at them.

“The Heavenly Dao Tree has the magical ability of condensing Heavenly Dao Fruit after Primals are slain. I killed countless Primals from various domains and worlds this time, so the Heavenly Dao Tree has already reached its limit of 9999 fruits. Now that the limit has been reached… has it changed in quality?” Long Chen’s voice quivered. If this guess was correct, then the Heavenly Dao Tree was truly a heaven-defying treasure.

The Heavenly Dao Tree’s 999 special fruits were shining. Their aura was clearly different from the other 9000.

Long Chen looked closer at one of them. Tracing its lines, they looked like magic clouds. 

“This aura is somewhat familiar to the Yuhua Palace’s patriarch. Could it be that after eating it, it will change a person’s constitution? In the future, when they reach the Immortal King realm, will they directly reach the Spirit tier?” Long Chen suddenly thought of something that made his heart skip.

Long Chen immediately retreated from the primal chaos space and called out Luo Bing from her seclusion. After they spoke, she returned to the Heavenly Swell Domain’s main academy to send a message to Luo Changwu. Long Chen needed him to secretly come with a thousand of his Primal disciples to the seventh branch academy.

This transportation formation was truly convenient. There was no need to cross the devil sea. Furthermore, with Long Chen being in such a rush, he had Luo Changwu spend a huge amount of money to come directly from the Luo family to the High Firmament Academy, and then to here.

When Luo Changwu arrived at the seventh branch academy, he was stunned by what he saw. Although he had heard that the branch had been restored to its previous glory, he was still shaken when he personally witnessed it.

Long Chen directly had those one thousand Luo family’s disciples register. They officially became disciples of the seventh branch academy and would be able to grow like fish in water here.

Luo Changwu had absolute confidence in Long Chen, so he wasn’t worried about the academy taking the Luo family’s disciples at all.

When the Luo family’s disciples sensed the dense spiritual qi here, they felt that it was a wonderland. The spiritual qi here was several times denser than their cultivation grounds. Just breathing in this qi could increase their cultivation base.

After giving them their disciple plates, Luo Bing brought them to the cultivation grounds. As for Long Chen, he invited Luo Changwu to his personal dean palace.

Looking at the grand and luxurious palace, Luo Changwu sighed, “Father’s vision truly is admirable.”

Before the Chu family and the Luo family’s conflict reached its peak, Luo Zichuan had left, leaving the Luo family to his sons. Then Long Chen led them to destroy the Chu family. However, only now did the two of them understand that Luo Zichuan hadn’t left the Luo family to them, but to Long Chen.

Long Chen had climbed up step by step. In just a few months, he became the dean of the seventh branch academy. That was an illustrious status. 

Long Chen’s support was something that Luo Changwu was extremely grateful for, and he also admired his father for having such a sharp vision.

“Has there been any news from the family head?” asked Long Chen. He was grateful to Luo Zichuan but also worried about him.

Luo Changwu shook his head, his mood sinking. He always felt like his father leaving was no good omen.

“Martial-uncle, don’t worry. With the family’s head power and wisdom, he’ll be fine. He won’t sacrifice himself when he still has a use to the Luo family. He most likely left to buy us more time. What we need to do now is increase our power as much as possible. Once I reach the Divine Lord realm, I’ll go find him,” said Long Chen.

“You know where father went?” asked Luo Changwu in surprise.

“I have a guess,” said Long Chen.

Luo Changwu had not climbed to the peak of the Honing Heavenly Staircase. As he hadn’t seen the star map in the stone hut, he didn’t know about that mark.

Long Chen was almost sure that Luo Zichuan had gone there. However, he didn’t dare to head there yet. Even if he found Luo Zichuan, in his current state, he couldn’t possibly help his grandfather.

However, once Long Chen advanced to the Divine Lord realm and condensed the Seven Star Battle Armor, that would be different. He was planning on finding Luo Zichuan after condensing the full Seven Star Battle armor.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Back in the day, it was due to his mother’s actions that the Luo family’s hopes were extinguished. So, he had to carry that burden for his mother.

“Martial-uncle, you just advanced to the Immortal King realm. Your aura isn’t too steady, so I can’t really tell what tier you are. You should be at the Mortal tier, right?” asked Long Chen.

Luo Changwu nodded, feeling embarrassed. “Me and your uncle Wen are truly lacking. We are both only Mortal tier Immortal Kings.”

Luo Zichuan had risen from a Mortal tier Immortal King to a Heaven tier Immortal King in just a few short centuries. Although that couldn’t be said to be a record time, it was definitely the shortest one in the past trillion years.

Luo Zichuan had only had children after reaching the Heaven tier. Theoretically, with that kind of talent, his children should have a chance of directly reaching the Earth tier upon becoming Immortal Kings, and they should at least be at the Spirit tier.

However, when the two of them advanced, they found that they were only the most ordinary Mortal tier Immortal Kings. They even suspected that they had been adopted. Why hadn’t they inherited Luo Zichuan’s talent? Both of them were depressed after advancing but didn’t dare to display that sadness to others. Now that Long Chen had brought it up, Luo Changwu was very embarrassed.

“Martial-uncle, don’t be dispirited. If the heavens won’t give you something, take it yourself. The family head also advanced from the Mortal tier, right? I have an opportunity for you to advance your Immortal King tier, but it comes at a certain risk. I don’t know if you’re willing to try it?” asked Long Chen.

Long Chen couldn’t possibly be sure what would happen when someone consumed one of the new Heavenly Dao Fruit. If Luo Changwu’s cultivation base suddenly fell to the Four Peak realm, Long Chen didn’t know if he would go crazy. So Long Chen directly gave him an explanation about what kind of risks he expected.

Luo Changwu realized that Long Chen was going to give him one of the heaven-defying divine fruit that changed ordinary disciples into Primals. Without hesitation, he directly answered, “I’m not afraid. Let me test it. If it works, I’ll be grateful to be the precedent. Even if it fails, it’s not a problem. Even if it drops me back to the Four Peak realm, I have the experience. It won’t be long before I return to the Immortal King realm. It just so happens that I can also rebuild my foundation, making it even more solid. That won’t be a bad thing,” said Luo Changwu.

Hearing that, Long Chen took out the highest of the 999 special fruits.

When Luo Changwu held this fruit, his expression changed. “If I eat this fruit, I will die.”
