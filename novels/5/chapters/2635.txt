Chapter 2624 Attacking Devil Spirit Mountain

“Boss, don’t joke around. If you don’t come, who will block the Alldevil Heavenwalker?” asked Guo Ran.

Long Chen waved his hand. “Let me finish. You will only launch a sneak attack, not a large-scale battle. The goal is only to raise morale and then leave. As this strike shall be quick and sweet, the Alldevil Heavenwalker won’t necessarily arrive in time. If he does, I will personally handle him. If he’s in such a rush, then by working together, we have a high chance of preventing him from leaving alive.”

“That’s right. Our goal is the Alldevil Heavenwalker. We can kill him to raise everyone’s morale!” exclaimed Li Qi.

Long Chen shook his head. “With my bad luck, I don’t think he will fall into my hands so easily. I can come up with plenty of great plans, but in reality, they are just dreams. So, if he comes, we will join forces to kill him. If he’s not, Mingyu and I will sneak into Devil Spirit Mountain, while the rest of you draw the attention of the devil race.”

Dong Mingyu smiled excitedly upon hearing that she would go out on a special mission with Long Chen.

“Are you investigating the power of the devil race? Isn’t that too dangerous?” asked Meng Qi. Considering how many experts were gathering in Devil Spirit Mountain, it would be troublesome if he was noticed.

“There definitely is danger, but it must be taken. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet has yet to return, so there must be something up,” said Long Chen.

Last time, Long Chen, Chang Hao, and Bao Buping had released the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. After that, the tablet had told them that it would return on its own later.

However, it had been many years, and there was still no news from it. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet was the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s strongest divine item, so only once it returned could the sect return to its former glory. Long Chen had witnessed the old man sighing about this alone many times.

Thus, Long Chen had two plans. If the Alldevil Heavenwalker came, they would kill him. If he didn’t, he would find the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet.

Cloud then summoned her true body, and they shot off into the void. Space twisted around them. Cloud’s speed was comparable to a transportation formation, so in just a few breaths’ time, they arrived in front of Devil Spirit Mountain.

This place was still in ruins, the aftermath of the battle yesterday. Hence, countless experts of the divine families were still cleaning up.

Long Chen saw Feng Fei conducting things and also Ye Lingshan’s figure. However, he didn’t greet her. Instead, he had Cloud directly fly into Devil Spirit Mountain.

“It’s the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow! It’s the Dragonblood Legion! What are they doing?!”

Startled cries rang out. After that, Cloud slowed down in front of Devil Spirit Mountain, allowing everyone to see her and the Dragonblood warriors on her back.

“The Dragonblood Legion’s strongest members have all gathered. But Long Chen’s aura isn’t amongst them. What are they doing?” Feng Fei stared as well, puzzled.

Long Chen was wearing a special aura-concealing cloak with Xia Chen’s runes on it, and it also made him invisible. Hence, even someone as powerful as Feng Fei didn’t notice him amongst the crowd.

Cloud then charged straight through. The Devil Spirit Mountain’s spatial laws had yet to fully merge with the Martial Heaven Continent’s, so Cloud tore straight through the void, causing huge waves in space.

On the other side, the countless experts of the devil race were staring coldly at the movement of the continent’s experts when Cloud suddenly charged in. They didn’t even have a chance to react before being directly blasted apart.

“Brothers, kill! Vengeance for the brothers and sisters of the original devil race! We will use their blood and souls as an offering to the original devil race’s heroes!”

Guo Ran cried out and began shooting, unleashing arrows that exploded amongst the devil race’s army. Every arrow created a zone devoid of any trace of life.

“Earth Disk Crush.”

At the same time, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan slammed the ground with a hand, and a giant crack split open. After that, an enormous stone rolled out through the battlefield, grinding down the devil race’s experts. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was like a rolling pin was being used to flatten ants. The screams were hair-raising.

Feng Fei and Ye Lingshan were both startled. Feng Fei demanded, “What are they doing? Why are they suddenly attacking without informing us?”

Ye Lingshan shook her head. “I don’t know either. These fellows are always like this. However, it is a bit odd that they would unleash such a large assault without Long Chen.”

The other warriors guarding this place were also stunned, not knowing if they were supposed to charge forward as well or continue watching. Why was nothing being said?

“Guo Ran, what are you doing?” called Ye Lingshan.

“Sister Lingshan, it’s nothing to worry about. Just watch. Today, the weather’s not bad. We’re going to kill a few brats from the devil race as a celebration!” replied Guo Ran from a distance.

Ye Lingshan was speechless. The weather was the same as always. Black clouds covered the sky, and it was impossible to tell if it was day or night. He couldn’t even bother to come up with a better excuse.

Hence, Ye Lingshan only shrugged to Feng Fei. She had already asked. If Feng Fei had any further questions, she could ask them herself.

“As the leader of the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one alliance, are you unable to control your subordinates?” said Feng Fei coldly, her voice containing discontent, as well as disdain.

If it was before their trip to the Star Field Divine World, Ye Lingshan’s expression would darken from hearing something like this. But now, only a few things could anger her.

The way that she had been used by Dongfang Yuyang in the Star Field Divine World to blackmail Long Chen was her life’s greatest shame. However, life was sometimes like that.

Whether a person matured or not didn’t depend on age, it depended on experience.

After that experience and Long Chen’s words, she had felt her realm sharply rise. At the very least, she could still smile in the face of Feng Fei’s sneer.

“According to your own words, why is it that divine families who claim themselves to be the strongest within the Martial Heaven Continent still had two Sovereign sprouts defeated? One even had his leg cut off! Is this how the divine families raise Sovereign sprouts?”

“You…!” Feng Fei’s expression sank.
