Chapter 1535 Attacking the Soul Transformation Realm

Translator: BornToBe

When the photographic jade was activated, Long Chen saw an ancient city. In the middle of the city was a giant steel frame.

At the top of the frame was a cut-off ax head. The ax head was as large as a mountain and emitted a cold, sharp light.

This was a giant guillotine. And captured at the bottom of it, bound by countless chains that pierced through its body, was Cloud. The ground was dyed red with its blood.

“Cloud...”

Although Long Chen had prepared himself for this sight, his eyes instantly turned red, and killing intent filled the room.

Long Chen clenched his teeth so hard that they creaked. Cloud was currently pierced through with hundreds of thick chains and bound to the guillotine.

Its whole body was covered in blood. Its rainbow feathers were now dim, and its wings had even been severed. It lay there, unconscious.

Hatred overflowed from Long Chen. Even after calculating things over and over again, he had still fallen for his enemies’ scheming. They had actually captured Cloud as a hostage.

“Long Chen, I know you’ll definitely see this sight. Hehe, how is it? Are you angry?”

Standing on top of Cloud’s head were three figures. They were Sha Guangyan, Peng Wansheng, and Ye Qingkuang. The one speaking as Sha Guangyan.

Although this was just a photographic jade, the three of them were looking right at him. Clearly, they had intentionally spread this photographic jade for him to see.

“Yes, I really am angry.” Long Chen coldly replied, his voice full of killing intent. These people were too despicable.

“In truth, I really wish I could see your expression when you receive this photographic jade. I’m sure it’ll be very marvelous. Long Chen, I heard you’re very loyal to your friends. I wonder if that really is true? Now your housepet is in our hands. Don’t worry, it hasn’t died yet...”

Sha Guangyan kicked one of the chains beside him, and its runes lit up. Cloud’s body shuddered. Clearly, these chains were torture tools.

“Hehe, sorry, in order to show you that it’s still alive, I have to hurt it a bit. You don’t mind, do you?” laughed Sha Guangyan with a fake apologetic appearance.

Long Chen clenched his fists, wishing to charge right through this image and punch this loathsome face.

“I won’t waste words. Long Chen, you’ve committed so many nefarious crimes that the entire Eastern Xuan Region’s junior generation has gathered for a Dragon Slaughtering Convention. In the name of upholding justice and removing evil from this world, we will use your steed as a sacrificial offering. Using its blood, we will swear to kill you. If you really have guts, you can bring your Dragonblood Legion to fight against the Eastern Xuan Region’s top junior generation experts. Don’t worry, in the Dragon Slaughtering Convention, Life Star experts are prohibited from interfering. You’ll still have a slight chance of saving your companion. If you win, this Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow will be yours. Of course, if you don’t dare to come, then there’s nothing left to say. The Dragon Slaughtering Convention will take place next month on the eighth. The location will be the Grand Han Ancient Nation’s capital. There are still twenty-seven days from the time of this recording. I’ve given you enough time to prepare. Whether or not you want to come and save it is up to you.”

After saying that, Sha Guangyan smiled sinisterly and kicked one of the chains again.

The image disappeared, revealing the grave-looking Zheng Wenlong. He had cut off the photographic jade.

“Is there another section where they tortured Cloud?” Long Chen’s voice was hoarse, and his gaze was as sharp as a blade. It was a bit frightening.

Zheng Wenlong was silent.

Long Chen nodded. “Good. I always felt like I was good at courting death, but it seems they’re not willing to concede defeat to me. I know what I have to do.”

“This is a sure death trap,” said Zheng Wenlong.

“I have no choice.”

Zheng Wenlong was silent for a moment. “If you need any help, just ask.”

Long Chen’s rage softened slightly. Clearly, Zheng Wenlong was willing to use the Huayun Sect’s power to help him. But he shook his head. “You’re a businessman. It’s not good for you to participate in this kind of struggle. You’d be ruining your own business. Just help me alert the Heaven Splitting battle Sect to prepare to support me. Let’s make this big.”

Long Chen left the Huayun auction house after that. He silently sat on the Heaven Flipping Seal as he rushed off. Suddenly, he had a thought, and an emerald leaf appeared in his hand.

The emerald leaf was the communication tool the Spirit World’s Life God Tree had given him. Mist flowed out of it, condensing into a figure.

“Hehe, boss, how are things on your side? Why haven’t you sent back the slightest news? The sister-in-laws, they’re worried about you.” The image revealed Guo Ran’s wretched smile. Long Chen then also saw Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er.

“Long Chen... did something happen?” Meng Qi was the first to sense something was wrong.

Long Chen nodded. “Major things have occurred in the Eastern Xuan Region...”

Long Chen gave a curt explanation of what had happened during this time.

“What the fuck? They really are courting death! They destroyed the Dao Sect and dared to capture Cloud? Boss, let’s gather right now and kill them all!” shouted Guo Ran.

Meng Qi’s eyes were red. Cloud had been raised by her, and she had the closest connection to it.

Long Chen waved his hand. “I’m angrier than you are. But this situation is not so simple. The only good thing is that they are using Cloud as a hostage, so Cloud’s life isn’t in danger yet. How are things on your side? Have the weapons and armor been completed? Oh, what are your cultivation bases like?”

Long Chen suddenly realized there was a change in them, but because this was just an image, he couldn’t sense their auras, so he couldn’t be sure.

“Ten days ago, we went through our collective tribulation in the Spirit World. Don’t worry, under the Life God Tree’s protection, we attacked the lightning tribulation and raised it to its strongest intensity...” said Guo Ran. But Long Chen sensed that he was a bit guilty toward the end. Most likely, he had fainted midway and hadn’t managed to complete the whole tribulation. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

By being in the Spirit World, their lives were absolutely protected by the spirit trees. Long Chen trusted that Gu Yang had raised the tribulation’s power to its peak. That was something he was confident in.

“Fine. Then you all should hurry to condense your Yuan Spirits and stabilize your cultivation bases. Raise your combat power as high as possible. There will soon be a fierce battle. The Dragonblood Legion is going to challenge the Eastern Xuan Region,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, don’t worry about it. We’ll kill them all,” said Guo Ran heroically. He was clearly very confident.

“Long Chen, be careful.”

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er sadly stared at Long Chen as the image faded. Long Chen took a deep breath and put away the leaf.

Flying on the Heaven Flipping Seal, Long Chen found an empty, lifeless place and put it away. Unleashing a furious roar, energy surged in his body.

A pillar of light soared into the sky, and the clouds were blown away.

The ground splintered as waves of energy surged out of Long Chen, crashing against the world.

Rumbling came from his body. It was like a hibernating beast had woken and wanted to slaughter the heavens.

Long Chen was attacking the next level of his cultivation base right here. He reached the thirteenth Heavenstage of Jade Core, and in that instant, the world shuddered and the sky turned dark.

A terrifying pressure filled the world. It became a dark world, filled with an air of destruction and annihilation.

The world was so dark that the tribulation clouds couldn’t be seen. The rumbling of lightning couldn’t be heard. The world was pitch-black and deathly silent.

“I’m not afraid of the dark.” Long Chen sneered and reached out to summon Evilmoon.

“Fuck, if you want to die, don’t pull me in! There’s divine lightning condensing! It will lock onto me if I appear!” shouted Evilmoon, refusing to come out. It could see the strangeness of this tribulation. “Long Chen, this is a tribulation of sure death. Now I understand what kind of existence you are. It’s no wonder the Heavenly Daos reject you. The power of this lightning tribulation will make it so that the five-colored lightning tribulation you experienced before is nothing in comparison. Divine lightning exists to temper and baptize divine items or divine spirits. But your tribulation lightning is not here to temper you but purely kill you. Neither I nor the Heaven Flipping Seal can help you. If we appear, the divine lightning will only grow more ferocious. It will become our tribulation, and you would definitely die.”

“Don’t worry, I have plenty of experience when it comes to this,” said Long Chen.

How could he not have experience? He had started going through tribulation ever since the Blood Condensation realm. There probably weren’t many people in this world that could compare to him when it came to tribulation experience.

Suddenly, a five-colored bolt of lightning appeared in the endless darkness, striking Long Chen.

The very first attack was actually the strongest destructive five-colored lightning!
