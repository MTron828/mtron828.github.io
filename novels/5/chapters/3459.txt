Chapter 3448 Collective Tribulation

BOOM!

The formation shuddered and divine light erupted. After that, those devils attacking the barrier were blown to dust.

At the same time, a ripple spread. All the devils within ten thousand miles of the barrier were wiped out.

Watching this scene, Bai Zhantang cursed Long Chen for being a rich moneybags inside. This one attack had cost three thousand immortal king crystals. His heart was dripping blood seeing this.

Long Chen was amazed by the formation’s power. If this large-area attack was condensed into a single ray, it truly did have the power to kill a World King.

As for the price of three thousand immortal king crystals, to the wealthy Long Chen, it was only like a single hair off of nine oxen. He didn’t even feel the cost.

Just then, the transportation formation lit up and young disciples came flooding off. There were nine thousand of them, led by Luo Changwu.

The seventh branch academy had a transportation formation linked right to the Luo family. Long Chen had already sent word to them to gather their disciples.

After wiping out those interfering devils, the formation connecting the academy to the Luo family could instantly activate, so the nine thousand disciples were all brought over.

The reason Long Chen had spent a huge sum to construct this transportation formation was partially due to his care for the Luo family and also partially for the Luo family’s Honing Heavenly Staircase. It was truly a priceless treasure to a cultivator. The academy’s disciples also needed tempering.

Over two thousand disciples of the academy and the nine thousand disciples of the Luo family were sent outside the barrier, getting a certain distance away. Over ten thousand of them were present, their hearts pounding wildly in their chests. It was their first time hearing of a group undergoing tribulation with so many people. So, they were exceptionally excited.

As for Heaven Master Dong Ming and the others, they were a bit worried. If something happened, and all these elite disciples were wiped out, how would they explain themselves?

“Will this really work?”

Bai Shishi stood beside Long Chen. She seemed to have forgotten her previous embarrassment.

Her heavenly tribulation wasn’t something that ordinary people could endure. Furthermore, a Divine Lord like Long Chen was standing in their midst, so her heart clenched. This could be a major mistake.

“I find that you are the one with the least confidence in me,” said Long Chen with a bitter smile.

Bai Shishi looked around. It seemed that this really was the case. Not one disciple here seemed worried at all, as their eyes were shining brightly. That kind of blind confidence was inexplicable to her.

“Start!” announced Long Chen.

Following that, everyone’s aura surged. Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, Xu Zixiong, Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, and Luo Ning were all amongst them.

Over ten thousand people broke through their shackles, charging into the Divine Lord realm. The heavens shook. At this moment, countless tribulation clouds surged and a terrifying pressure shook people’s hearts.

Heaven Master Yun Yang stared in fright at the massive tribulation clouds.

“The youngsters these days are crazy.”

Long Chen looked at the tribulation clouds and frowned as well. Bai Shishi immediately asked, “What is it? Did something happen?”

“This heavenly tribulation is weaker than I expected. That doesn’t seem right,” said Long Chen curiously.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“How could that be? The heavenly tribulation’s destructive aura is causing my soul to shake. One mistake and we might all die. How can you call it weak?” Bai Shishi looked at him in confusion.

Long Chen shook his head. Suddenly, he had a thought. Could it be due to the Heavenly Dao mark? Standing here, he didn’t sense any hostility from the heavenly tribulation.

If it was before, the heavenly tribulation would immediately want to kill him as if he had killed their father. This time, the heavenly tribulation didn’t even notice him.

“That’s fine too. If it can’t see me, it will give everyone else some buffer time. Then I just need to silently watch,” thought Long Chen.

Just then, a drizzle of lightning fell onto their bodies. The first wave of this tribulation was very gentle. Everyone found it easy.

Everyone bathed in the lightning drizzle, but they knew that the real danger lay at the end. Thus, they did their best to absorb as much of this lightning as possible to quickly raise the power of their bodies to face the end of the tribulation.

Just then, long lightning dragons appeared. They swam within the lightning tribulation, absorbing the lightning that didn’t fall on people’s bodies.

Lei Linger had transformed into tens of thousands of lightning dragons to absorb the leftover lightning here. She had ended up devouring too many lightning runes in the Integral Heaven Star-Field. The last batch in particular was so powerful that refining them took up a great deal of energy.

If relying just on herself, it would take at least ten more days to finish refining those runes. But now, by borrowing everyone’s heavenly tribulation, she could use the weak lightning here to refine that strong lightning. It could be considered killing two birds with one stone.

At first, the disciples were stunned to see the violet lightning dragons swimming around them. They had never seen lightning lifeforms like them.

Even the experts inside the academy, including the Battle God Palace’s experts, were startled.

“Long Chen controls thunderforce himself. Otherwise, he wouldn’t make everyone take this risk,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother with a smile.

Last time, she had personally witnessed the entirety of Long Chen’s tribulation. Now, she found that the aura of those lightning dragons of his had grown even more terrifying.

With the descent of the lightning tribulation, those devils attacking the academy fled. This kind of supreme Yang power was precisely what they were most afraid of.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, the lightning rain grew stronger and bigger. The drops went from the size of a thumb to the size of a chicken egg, and their power grew explosively. It then went from the size of a chicken egg to a head. Now, the drops were exploding, possessing a certain killing power.

After that, they transformed into lightning swords, which grew sharper and sharper. After two hours, people started to be injured.

Heaven Master Yun Yang started to grow uneasy. They were not even halfway through the tribulation, but people were starting to be injured. How would they face the rest of the tribulation?

When another incense stick’s worth of time passed, lightning beasts appeared in the sky. With their arrival, the situation became a bit chaotic. There were too many of those lightning beasts, and they came from every direction. These disciples clearly didn’t have experience against lightning beasts.

Lightning beasts normally only appeared when advancing to the Divine Lord realm and onward. So, most of these disciples had not encountered them in their tribulations yet.

Furthermore, it was also said that an ordinary person would only have nine lightning beasts appear in their tribulation, and they would only appear at the end. Killing those nine lightning beasts would mean that the tribulation was over.

Only Primals would have ninety-nine lightning beasts in their tribulation. But this time, although the ones undergoing tribulation were all Primals, the number of lightning beasts was numbered in the millions. Furthermore, they continued to stream out of the tribulation clouds. There was an endless tide of them. Now, the situation instantly turned grave. Quite a few people looked toward Long Chen.

“If you fall to such weak lightning beasts, I won’t save you. You won’t be worth saving and can just die in humiliation.” Long Chen’s icy voice shook their hearts.
