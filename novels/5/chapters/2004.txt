The capital of the Grand Xia was flourishing more than ever. Of the four ancient nations of the Grand Xia, Grand Chu, Grand Zhou, and Grand Han, only three remained. The Grand Han Ancient Nation had been destroyed because of Long Chen.

Standing in the capital of the Grand Xia, Long Chen felt various emotions. Back then, he had been given the title of the National Protector, Great General Long Chen. However, it seemed that he had left before even having a chance to pick up his salary.

Past scenes appeared in his mind. The building over there had once been the Bloodkill Hall’s stronghold. He had fought with Xia Luo against the experts of the Bloodkill Hall there.

“Hey! Uncle, where is the Guangji Hall?” A man that was passing by paused to ask Long Chen a question.

“Go forward, and turn left on the eleventh road. Past three bridges there will be a mountain. Go around it and you’ll arrive.” Long Chen pointed. That man nodded and went away according to his directions.

“Big brother, hello. May I ask if you know how to get to the Guangji Hall?” A woman now came up to Long Chen.

“Turn around. That building behind you is it,” said Long Chen.

“Thank you, big brother!” The woman thanked him and turned around.

“Long Chen, you’re so evil.”

Meng Qi and the others, who were behind Long Chen, laughed. That pitiful fellow was definitely going to get lost thanks to Long Chen’s directions.

“Hmph, calling me uncle is one thing, but he wasn’t even polite. This’ll teach him a lesson,” laughed Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t want to startle anyone by his arrival at the Grand Xia. He went directly to the Wine God Palace, and only there did he and Meng Qi reveal their true appearances. A disciple from the Wine God Palace naturally came to greet them.

Meng Qi and the others were a bit nervous at being in such a place. More disciples of the Wine God Palace began to appear, greeting them.

They all felt great reverence for Long Chen, not because of his cultivation base or position, but because his knowledge in medicinal wines had greatly benefited them.

As they crossed the mountainous path, they arrived at a small manor. There was a woman reading off a scroll, and in front of her was a girl solemnly listening and following along.

Seeing that girl, Long Chen smiled warmly. That was his little sister, Long Xiaoyu.

She had grown up quite a bit since their last parting. She took more after their mother. She was very obedient and seemed like a well-educated daughter of a noble family, but there was a hint of naughtiness within her as well.

Although she was solemnly reciting something, she was secretly playing with something in her hands at the same time. Long Chen couldn’t help thinking how he had been quite a bad child as well when he was young, making his teachers fume and causing his mother to scold him.

As for the woman teaching Xiaoyu, Long Chen recognized her. She was a Life Star expert of the Wine God Palace, and she had helped him when he had been leaving the city.

How could Xiaoyu’s secretive actions really escape her observation? She just didn’t expose her.

“Xiaoyu, within this verse, what does it mean when it says the heart must have no agitation, that you must be like a mountain and sea, that even heaven and earth cannot destroy you?” asked the woman.

“I know. It’s saying that we have to concentrate all our focus and energy, like a tall mountain that cannot fall, like a great sea that never dries up. Even the power of heaven and earth cannot destroy us. It’s an expression of fighting against fate,” said Xiaoyu very obediently.

The woman nodded. “The movement of the Heavenly Daos has set a fate for every being, but fate can be changed. If you want to obtain more, you have to go against your fate. Although you might not succeed, if you don’t try, you definitely won’t succeed. Xiaoyu, tell me, what do you think about this?”

“I want to be a strong person like my big brother,” said Long Xiaoyu.

“What?”

“Because my brother is my mom and dad’s pride, and the pride of our Phoenix Cry Empire. I want to be someone my parents can be proud of as well!” The little girl raised her fist, looking exceptionally adorable.

The people Long Xiaoyu encountered, other than her parents, were mostly from the Wine God Palace, with a few people from the Grand Xia’s imperial palace. To not make her feel lonely, the imperial palace often sent over a few children the same age as her to play with. Xia Yunchong, Xia Youluo, and the others also often came to look after her. That was why what she knew about Long Chen mostly came from other people’s mouths. The Grand Xia was a nation within the cultivation world, and its people felt great worship for Long Chen. Many of the stories about him had been turned into legends.

Then considering what stories the children might pass to Long Xiaoyu, she had felt even greater worship for her brother.

“Do you miss your big brother?”

“I do.”

“Then I’ll use a magical art to let you see your big brother. How’s that?”

“Really?”

“Here. Close your eyes.” The woman smiled and covered Long Xiaoyu’s eyes, slowly turning her around. “You can open your eyes.”

“I’m afraid I won’t see him. I don’t want to be disappointed.” Long Xiaoyu actually didn’t dare to open her eyes.

However, in the end, her eyes slowly opened. She saw a man in black robes, his eyes bright as the stars, with a smile warmer than the sun.

“Big brother!” Long Xiaoyu, after a moment of stunned shock, suddenly ran over to Long Chen.

“Haha, Xiaoyu, did you miss me?” Long Chen laughed and hugged her.

“I missed you a lot! Big brother, how did you get here?”

“I don’t know either! I was just strolling through the sheets when clouds gathered in the sky, and a ray of light enveloped me. Then I appeared here,” said Long Chen.

“Wow, my teacher is so amazing! I want to be able to summon you like that too!”

“Then you have to listen to her and work hard,” said Long Chen, pointing to the paper man she was playing with in her hands.

Only then did she notice that she had exposed this paper man in her excitement. She blushed, turning around to apologize to her teacher. But her teacher had already left.

“Here, Xiaoyu, let me introduce you. These are your future sisters-in-law.” Long Chen presented Xiaoyu to Meng Qi and the others.

“Little sister, don’t listen to your big brother’s nonsense. You can just call us big sister in the future,” said Meng Qi, glaring at Long Chen for a moment.

“Wow, big sisters, you’re all so beautiful!” exclaimed Long Xiaoyu.

Meng Qi and the others laughed. Long Xiaoyu was actually quite smart and adorable. Meng Qi and the others were already starting to fall in love with her.

After talking a bit more, Long Chen asked about their parents. Long Xiaoyu said that their mother was weeding the garden, while their father was making wine.

Long Chen was startled. Only later when he asked some disciples of the Wine God Palace did he learn that his father had actually taken up the banner of the Wine God Palace and started learning how to make wine. Although he was only a titular disciple, it was still shocking.

After all, Long Tianxiao had been a military man, the empire’s greatest general that had fought on the frontlines. For him to be able to have the calm heart the Wine God Palace required to make wine was quite shocking.

They walked through the mountains, arriving at a small little area. There was a field full of vegetables, and Mrs. Long was currently using a hoe to weed.

The Wine God Palace did not lack food, but Mrs. Long always felt that it was better to have something to do. These vegetables kept her busy.

Seeing Long Chen, she was incredibly emotional. She was about to speak when she saw Meng Qi and the others.

“Qi-er!”

“Mom.”

Meng Qi hastily went up, completely red. She was originally Long Chen’s fiancée, so calling her mom was only natural.

“Good child, the two of you have ended up together in the end. Ah, quick, let go, I’m dirty.” Mrs. Long only noticed how much dust and dirt was on her after hugging Meng Qi.

“Mom, don’t worry about it.” Chu Yao also came up.

“You’re... princess Chu Yao!” Mrs. Long became even more delighted.

“Mom, I’m Tang Wan-er, remember?” Tang Wan-er also came up, not knowing what to say.

“Good, good, good! Good children, this isn’t the place to talk. Let’s go inside!” Mrs. Long was more excited than anyone. Originally, she had been worried about Long Chen being at such an age and still not having a family. Now, he had brought back so many women, all beautiful fairies.

It was too bad that she only had two hands and couldn’t hold them all. To Long Chen, she said, “Chen-er, go call your father out of his wine cellar. Drag him out of his wine barrel so we can have a proper family dinner.”

Mrs. Long was so delighted that she actually shooed off Long Chen, enthusiastically getting to know Meng Qi and the others.

Even Long Xiaoyu didn’t follow Long Chen. She was pulled away by Meng Qi and the others.

Helplessly, Long Chen could only ask where the cellar was and go by himself.

The cellar was located under a mountain. The temperature, humidity, and density of spiritual qi were all perfect for wine.

All the Wine God Palace’s disciples had their own wine cellars. When he entered the one belonging to Long Tianxiao, a faint wine fragrance came out. It was faint but very pure.

It had only been a few years, but his father was already capable of making such wine? Long Chen was amazed. There was a certain realm within this wine that he couldn’t pinpoint exactly what it was without tasting it. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He quickly saw a figure busy sealing a jug. When Long Chen got closer, that person turned around. Seeing Long Chen, a warm smile appeared on his stalwart face.
