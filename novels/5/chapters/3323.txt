Chapter 3312 Evil Flame Yan Xu

This was a part of the scripture that Long Chen had never heard before. But he knew that it was the Nirvana Scripture. He wondered what volume of the scripture it was.

As the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy chanted, countless stars lit up and flames ignited throughout the cosmos. A whole star-field was burning.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Standing within those flames, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy appeared sacred and holy. She suddenly spread her arms, and her rainbow flame exploded, devouring this place.

Those terrifying lifeforms were instantly turned to ash. After that explosion, everything here vanished, including the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

After being sneak-attacked by that terrifying expert and having used her body to receive her opponent’s attack in order to leave a heavy injury on them, she knew she no longer possessed the power to drive off so many enemies. Thus, she used the Nirvana Scripture to kill all of them. As for herself, she also fell.

The figure of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy slowly appeared in front of Long Chen again. He was pulled back from that space. It was like all of that was a dream. 

No, not a dream. A nightmare.

“Who was that?” asked Long Chen.

He was referring to that terrifying lifeform that had sneak attacked the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. He had only seen a vague figure. It was a person, but he hadn’t seen their face.

“He is Yan Xu. He calls himself the Flame Sovereign, and he is the most evil flame within the nine heavens and ten lands, as well as the strongest flame of the current nine heavens and ten lands. He achieved his Dao years later than me. At that time, the two of us were relatively evenly matched. However, he relied on devouring other flames to cultivate. He even refined the blood, bones, and souls of countless lifeforms as a Dao foundation for himself. If he was allowed to continue, he could very possibly destroy the entire immortal world. He is an evil seed of destruction born to devour and slaughter. I can sense that aura on you as well,” said the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

Long Chen shook his head. “I don’t feel like I am wrong. Some things should be destroyed.”

“Then what is the target of your destruction? What will you use to decide whether or not something should be destroyed?” Rainbow light flowed within her eyes as she stared at Long Chen, seemingly seeing through him.

Long Chen didn’t avert his gaze. Looking right back into her bright eyes, he said, “There is no criteria or yardstick. There is simply whether or not I like it or dislike it, and then I’ll choose whether to support or destroy it. Perhaps my eyes can be blinded, but my heart will forever remain clear. I can permit others to have other opinions and viewpoints. No one is absolutely right or wrong. Right or wrong can only be decided through time.”

Hearing this response, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy slowly smiled. “Your answer is satisfactory. If you could obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, perhaps I could feel more at ease. However, I cannot see your future. It will probably be very difficult for you to obtain the it.”

“Big sister, aren’t you the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy? Since you acknowledge us, why not give me the Heavenly Rainbow Flame? I will definitely inherit big sister’s will and kill those bad people as vengeance for you!” cried out Huo Linger.

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy smiled and squatted down. She rubbed Huo Linger’s cheek just like she was looking at her own little sister. She warmly said, “Little sister, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame’s birth is a seed of destiny. If it falls in the hands of a good person, it will benefit all life. If it falls into the hands of a bad person, it will bring calamity upon the immortal world. Big sister is a Heavenly Rainbow Flame, a very special case with no master. I relied entirely on myself to cultivate. In my cultivation, I was helped by the kindness of the human race, and only then did I reach my current realm. That is why I used my life to protect the human race, to return this favor. My true body has long since been destroyed, so the human race’s worship merely pulled back my discarnate soul. 

“After they worshiped me for so many years, I gradually came to understand the human race’s emotions. I also saw many things that I didn’t see before and comprehended many principles that I hadn’t. As they continued to worship me, I grew stronger bit by bit. This can also be considered a form of rebirth from death, an ability that transcends the laws of the Heavenly Daos. Amongst all the world’s spirits, only the human race possesses such an ability. My discarnate soul is nourished here, opening an entirely new cultivation style. However, I cannot communicate with these people. Even the slightest thought from me, and they will be unable to endure that karma and will be destroyed. 

“That is why they always say that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame is connected to me, but I cannot explain the truth. I’m truly helpless. The Heavenly Rainbow Flames are like humans. They can be good, and they can be bad. There can even be battles between Heavenly Rainbow Flames. However, within the cycle of the Heavenly Daos, rarely do two Heavenly Rainbow Flames descend upon the world at the same time. I have existed through the process of Heavenly Rainbow Flames choosing masters several times, so I have personally witnessed them used by bad people. They were either destroyed by experts or devoured their masters, becoming flame devils that were ultimately destroyed by heavenly tribulation…”

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s voice became sad, as if she had lost herself in distant memories. She continued, “Regretfully, through all of that, I can only wait and see. Every person’s fate must be controlled by themself. No one can change it. I have always been anticipating a seed of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame to be taken by a good person and grow strong.”

“Big sister, why can’t you tell us where the Heavenly Rainbow Flame is? When will it appear? Big brother Long Chen is very strong. We’ll definitely get it. We won’t let it fall into the hands of a bad person!” declared Huo Linger.

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy shook her head. “This kind of fate would not benefit you at all if it was exposed. It would only make it harder for you to obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. So, I cannot give you any help. I only came out to see you because I can sense some kind of calling from Long Chen’s body. Furthermore, I also can’t see the future of Long Chen. In other words, Long Chen will not be infected by my karma. I transmitted a portion of history for you to see. As for whether that is a blessing or disaster for the human race, I can’t say. But I am willing to gamble on you.”

Long Chen’s heart shook. That final sentence was something that he had heard many times in his lifetime. It didn’t seem to be a good omen. It felt like he had been drawn into a storm.

Furthermore, Long Chen’s intuition also told him that there were many things that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy wasn’t telling him. She only told him the part that she wished to tell him.

For her to tell him this much, was it because of the Nirvana Scripture? Then was she connected to the Pill Sovereign?

Long Chen looked at her, wanting to ask about the Nirvana Scripture. But looking into her eyes, he held himself back.

If she was going to say it, she would have said it without asking. If she wasn’t going to say it, then asking was meaningless.

“Long Chen, the birth of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame will draw over experts from outside the heaven. You should prepare yourself,” said the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

“Experts from outside the heaven?” Long Chen was startled. What did that mean?
