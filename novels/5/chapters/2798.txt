Chapter 2787 Nethergod Sisters

“It’s over…”

When people saw these newcomers’ auras, they shut their eyes. The majority of these new experts actually had a trace of a Sovereign’s aura. Some even had the aura of a divine Dao and could be considered demigods.

This wasn’t a battle anymore but a slaughter. It was a group of demigods slaughtering mortals. The Martial Heaven Continent’s people had lost all their hopes.

When the four channels were blown open, it was as if the entire world was crumbling, and cracks spread in the void. A mortal world like the Martial Heaven Continent could not contain this much divine power.

“Ha, being able to exchange blows with a god as a mortal is enough to brag for a lifetime.” Gu Yang spat out some blood and cursed.

Although that was what he said, the feeling of helplessness and despair when facing armies from the divine world wasn’t something simple bravery could contend against.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the sky at the center of the Martial Heaven Continent shattered. A sword then came out of that shattered space, containing an overwhelming aura of death.

After that, Sword Qi left a giant cut throughout the entire Central Plains. Any invaders touched by that Sword Qi were wiped out of existence whether they had touched upon the Sovereign realm or were demigods. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At this moment, death qi flowed into the continent, and a pair of figures appeared within the black mist. They both wore black dresses, a stark contrast to their pale white skin, and both figures were identical. They both had a pair of sapphire eyes that were like gemstones in the night.

Their beauty was so otherworldly that even every single one of their eyelashes was symmetrical. It was a suffocating beauty that shouldn’t exist in this world.

“Big sisters!” Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others cried out. These were the Netherworld’s gods, Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan.

For most of the Dragonblood Legion, their impression of these two had grown very light because they were gods. Mortals’ memories of such things would slowly fade.

However, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others had received gifts from Leng Yueyan, so they had certain karma binding them together, allowing them to remember.

“You want to kill my man? Then you’ll have to pass through me first. It seems that it’s been a long time since I’ve slaughtered anyone. I wonder if I’m rusty.” Leng Yueyan held her bone sword, overlooking the invading experts with a Nethergod’s domineering air.

As she said this, she swept out her bone sword, and divine energy shook the world. With a single wave, the entire battlefield was emptied. It was unknown just how many invaders she killed with that one blow.

“You lower gods dare to interfere in this battle? Do you know what kind of calamity you’ve made for yourselves?!” shouted the Alldevil Heavenwalker.

At this moment, Ming Cangyue looked at Long Chen. His eyes were closed and he was still seated in the air. She then smiled. “Loving him was already a calamity. Who cares so much?”

Ming Cangyue’s figure shook. She then appeared in front of the Alldevil Heavenwalker and unleashed a slash of her sword, sending the Alldevil Heavenwalker flying into the distance. Half of his body was destroyed.

After sending the Alldevil Heavenwalker flying, she attacked the Nine-Headed Lion. However, his entire body lit up and he chose to flee rather than fight. This resulted in her attack passing by him and continuing to the east. The Eastern Wasteland was then cut in two halves.

Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan were true gods. If they were to descend to the Martial Heaven Continent during ordinary times, they would be restricted by the laws of this place.

However, at this time, the laws of the continent were in chaos, and the spatial walls of the world had weakened. Because of it, the two of them managed to pierce through the path of reincarnation to appear here. Although the two of them had paid quite a price for this, they managed to reach this battlefield.

Ming Cangyue’s destructive blow scared the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. This was a true god. She could destroy the world.

They had received reinforcements from the Immemorial Path, the Spirit World, and the Star Field Divine World. Those people had come for Long Chen.

Now, even true gods had crossed worlds, and based on Ming Cangyue’s look toward Long Chen and her words, they had also come for him.

Legend had it that Long Chen’s charisma was so great that his pick-up arts were unrivaled. It was unknown just how many peerless beauties had been lured away by him.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, and Dong Mingyu were all nation-toppling beauties, and yet they all were undyingly loyal to Long Chen.

Even the Pill Fairy, his mortal enemy, had come at a critical moment, betraying her own faith.

Hence, people were filled with disbelief. Could picking up girls also reach the realm of surpassing all laws and surpassing the heavens? Even gods could be seduced? This was definitely a heaven-defying ability.

At the core where the barrier was, Xia Youluo simply sighed with a bitter smile. “Perhaps only people like them are a match for him.”

The women appearing around Long Chen simply grew stronger and stronger. Now, even gods had appeared, and this actually ended up comforting Xia Youluo. She seemed to realize what their difference was.

However, she didn’t realize that the real difference was in the heart. She had implicated the deaths of many people in the Four Nations Ancient Remnant due to her childish character, causing her to still be filled with shame and guilt to this day.

She had then made it her life’s mission to make up for those mistakes. Because of this, she began to see herself as a sinner, looking down on herself. That was the true reason why she gave up pursuing her own happiness, because she felt that she didn’t deserve happiness.

Regretfully, people could see others clearly, but they couldn’t see themselves. She felt like being unhappy was the best way to atone for her sins. Xia Yunfeng, Xia Yuncong, and the others all understood the truth, but it wasn’t something people could simply convince her of. Hence, they were powerless as well.

Leng Yueyan had wiped out the invading armies with a single slash. Only a few with the auras of Sovereigns managed to escape the net and get to the army of the Dragonblood Legion. But any with the power of a divine Dao had been slain by her.

While those Sovereign experts were extremely terrifying, fortunately, Ming Cangyue was able to force back the Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion by herself, allowing Little Snow to return and guard everyone. Hence, the crisis was temporarily alleviated.

Now, divine power raged on the battlefield. Every attack caused heaven and earth to collapse, deforming the Martial Heaven Continent completely.

BOOM!

With another blow, Ming Cangyue forced the Nine-Headed Lion and the Alldevil Heavenwalker back once again. The two of them weren’t a match for her. She was about to chase after them when her heart shook.

She then appeared in front of Yun Tian’s barrier. When she looked at Long Chen, her expression changed.

“Yueyan, something seems to be wrong with Long Chen!”
