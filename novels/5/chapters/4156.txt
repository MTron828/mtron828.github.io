Chapter 4145: Terrifying Eternal Divine Weapon

Long Chen had claimed the corpse of the Great Desolate Winged Devil, causing the spectacle that had been present for countless years to vanish just like that. This land where countless people came to temper their wills was now no more.

The land was still as tough as metal, and the aura of Eternal experts still remained. Nevertheless, the corpse and the spear had both disappeared, leaving behind a once-glossy ground now marred with cracks, with a conspicuous giant hole at its center. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When this news spread, people didn’t dare to believe it, so many people went to investigate it, only to see that the rumors were true. The Eternal devil corpse and the Eternal divine weapon had all been taken.

As a result, Long Chen’s name spread throughout the world, reaching the ears of countless races and prompting a number of experts to inquire about him.

After all, Long Chen now had too many treasures on him. That bronze cauldron suspected to be the Heaven Earth Cauldron in particular was definitely no ordinary item, as it was capable of directly striking an Eternal divine weapon.

However, wanting to capture Long Chen was not so easy. Ordinary Heaven Venerates shouldn’t even think about it. As for innate Heaven Venerates, they were the masters of their large powers. If they were to attack Long Chen, they were afraid of the heavens’ misfortune striking them with the Sage King Convention occurring.

As for Immortal Kings, they could attack Long Chen without fearing those consequences. Thus, countless powerful heavenly geniuses set their sights on Long Chen.

One aspect was that Long Chen had priceless treasures on him, but the other aspect was because Long Chen was the youngest dean in the history of the High Firmament Academy. Defeating him came with many benefits.

Long Chen instantly became a hot figure for powerful geniuses, so people began to gather information on him, preparing to attack him.

Fortunately, Long Chen had long since anticipated all of this and didn’t mind at all. The true Earth Cauldron was in his hand, and whether or not he sold the fake Earth Cauldron was only the matter for the unlucky fellow who fell for it.

He also had Uncle Tree and Xu Jianxiong to protect him, so he didn’t fear anyone. Xu Jianxiong had even said that he would fully support Long Chen.

Xu Jianxiong was planning on showing off in the Sage King Convention. But of course, he needed an excuse to show off. As the Fullmoon race’s disciples were not skilled in this regard, this mission was then left to Long Chen.

Xu Jianxiong had told Long Chen about his trump card. As long as he summoned the ancestral spirit totem, no innate Heaven Venerates would be a match for him.

However, Long Chen hadn’t mentioned that to Uncle Tree. Thus, just as Xu Jianxiong was planning on slaughtering a few innate Heaven Venerates as a display of power to those who looked down on the Fullmoon race, Uncle Tree actually used a sacrificial technique to intimidate those experts. That was something that moved Long Chen, as well as made him feel guilty.

It would have been better if he had told Uncle Tree about this before. After all, Xu Jianxiong was planning on announcing the return of the Fullmoon race.

However, Uncle Tree’s power also exceeded Xu Jianxiong’s expectations. The Undying Dragon Tree race’s divine abilities were truly shocking.

After this battle, Guo Ran was much more obedient. When Long Chen handed him over the immortal metals he had scammed from the Blood Devil race, Guo Ran actually kissed the stuff twice and hugged Long Chen. He apologized so hard for messing up killing that innate Heaven Venerate that Long Chen almost felt like vomiting.

After obtaining the immortal metals, Guo Ran started smiling like a fool. After all, those immortal metals were treasures that not even money could buy. Before this, there were many runes that he couldn’t forge due to lacking certain immortal metals with special attributes.

Coincidentally enough, these immortal metals were perfect for him to try out more runes, and there was also the spear that Long Chen had just obtained. He and Xia Chen wanted to study it.

“Let me first say that this spear is a relic of our senior. You have to treat it with enough respect. Also, don’t get any ideas about it. I’m planning on leaving it to Gu Yang,” said Long Chen.

Gu Yang was the Dragonblood Legion’s number-one spear expert. He had always used spears. If he could obtain this spear’s approval, then he would be able to unleash its greatest potential.

On the other hand, if Guo Ran were to use this spear with his battle armor, that would be like a pig wearing pearls. Thus, Long Chen first gave a warning so it wouldn’t be awkward when he took it from Guo Ran.

“Hehe, boss, don’t worry, the moment you obtained the spear, I knew that it would be for Gu Yang!” said Guo Ran.

Having followed Long Chen for so long, Guo Ran now specialized in using sabers. Many of his techniques were learned from Long Chen. Thus, even if Long Chen gave him the spear, he wouldn’t know how to properly use it.

The reason he wanted it just now was purely to study its runes. After all, those runes had become a lost art in the present day, so even if he could only figure out one or two of them, it would be a huge gain.

He and Xia Chen had long since copied the Earth Cauldron’s runes. However, they felt helpless about the fact that they could not understand them.

But it was understandable. The runes on the Earth Cauldron were from many eras ago, so ancient that He and Xia Chen didn’t even know where to start researching them.

In the end, they had to give up on studying them. However, this Eternal divine weapon brought them new hope. Perhaps with enough research, they could study the ancient runes.

“You can copy the runes for now, but you have to give it back to me. I’ll use my soul to nourish it. Hopefully, the item-spirit can be fully awakened, then it will be able to help you understand the areas that you don’t understand,” said Long Chen.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran nodded. Their Spiritual Strength wasn’t as powerful as Long Chen’s. So, if they were to nourish it, who knew how many years it would take for it to awaken? Furthermore, the process would harshly affect their cultivation.

The two of them hastily started copying the runes. Accidentally, Guo Ran touched the tip of the spear and instantly cried out in pain.

He was shocked to find that even when his armor automatically appeared to protect him, a sizable gash had been inflicted upon it.

In front of this spear, his battle armor was as weak as tofu. However, the more that was true, the more excited he was.

“Fuck, I, Guo Ran, swear that I will personally forge an Eternal divine weapon! Soon, all my brothers in the Dragonblood Legion will have an Eternal divine weapon. At that time, hehe!” Guo Ran seemed to be able to see the Dragonblood warriors in the future, all wielding Eternal divine weapons, slaughtering their enemies.

“Stop daydreaming and stop the blood instead, or you’re going to die!” scolded Xia Chen.

“Eh? What the fuck, I’m bleeding! It’s coming out so fast! I didn’t feel it at all!” Guo Ran was shocked. The wound wasn’t large, but his blood wasn’t stopping. If he didn’t stop it, he would exsanguinate.

Guo Ran focused on healing the wound, and the blood slowly stopped. “It’s a good thing the item-spirit is nice to us, or that cut might be fatal!”

After the two of them finished copying the runes on the spear, Long Chen put it in his spiritual space, leaving it in the same space as the Earth Cauldron.

However, the spear quickly moved itself away from the Earth Cauldron, running to a corner of his spiritual space. It was very respectful toward the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen then used his Spiritual Strength to nourish it, and gradually, the item-spirit began to give off fluctuations and form a resonance with Long Chen’s spear.

After handling the spear, Long Chen’s mind entered the primal chaos space, and he was absolutely astounded by what he saw inside.
