Chapter 4868 Cao Yuyang

As the letter exploded in Mo Nian’s hands, intense flames raged, looking like they would burn down the whole forest.

“Hmph.”

When those flames barely spread a few feet away, Mo Nian snorted and clenched his hand, causing runic chains to come out of his hand and bind them.

Just like that, Mo Nian suppressed the flames, compressing them into an egg-sized sphere.

“That was pretty badass,” Long Chen remarked, impressed by Mo Nian's actions. Long Chen knew that if he were in a similar situation, he would need Huo Linger to devour the flames for him.

“As expected, his appearance was a reflection of his heart. What a sinister person. He was trying to kill people!” Yu Tong was enraged. Fortunately, she hadn’t opened it in advance, or the explosion would have taken her life.

Mo Nian eyed the sealed flames, weighing them with a sneer. “What an immature challenge letter. Well, he’s succeeded in provoking Boss Mo. Not bad, not bad.”

“What was the name on the letter?” asked Long Chen, looking at Yu Tong.

Yu Tong answered, “He called himself Cao Yuyang, but he didn’t say anything else.”

“Which trash is that again?” asked Mo Nian, frowning.

At this moment, another voice replied to him, “Cao Yuyang is Cao Guofeng’s youngest son. He has always been decently talented, and through some connections, they sent him to the Brahma Pill Valley to cultivate. However, due to his limited talent, his core flame was unable to birth a spirit, so he could not refine pills. In the end, he was tossed out.”

“Big Brother Wujiang!”

Long Chen and Mo Nian looked over. Xing Wujiang had actually come over, and he seemed quite happy and refreshed.

“If he's defective merchandise, how did he dare to challenge us? What gives him that courage?” asked Mo Nian. After all, Long Chen had just killed Cao Shaoqing. Was Cao Guofeng planning on sending one of his sons to accompany his grandson?

Xing Wujiang smiled. “Cao Yuyang was forced to leave the Brahma Pill Valley, but as Cao Guofeng continued to cry and beg, he managed to send Cao Yuyang to the Flame Divine Hall. It goes without saying that Cao Guofeng has some skills, and Cao Yuyang did end up working hard. He managed to establish a stable place for himself in the Flame Divine Hall. Although he isn’t particularly famous within it, just being able to stay in the Flame Divine Hall shows that he is not ordinary. I’ve seen him before, and although I don’t know what his power is like, in terms of talent, he’s a far cry from you two. The reason he sent this challenge letter is definitely because he has someone else’s support.”

“The Flame Divine Hall?” Long Chen and Mo Nian both thought of this name at the same time.

Xing Wujiang nodded. “That is most likely the case. The opening of Heaven Screen Mountain has reached their ears, and the Flame Divine Hall will send their disciples to participate. Due to how busy I was, I had no time to investigate just how strong those disciples were. But considering the Cao family’s hatred, they will definitely try to get you two in a fight with the Flame Divine Hall’s disciples through Cao Yuyang. Perhaps the Cao family won’t even wait for Jiang Yiban and the others; they might want to kill you themselves in Heaven Screen Mountain.”

This strategy of the Cao family was rather laughable. After all, Long Chen already had a deep enmity with the Flame Divine Hall and the Brahma Pill Valley. Did Cao Guofeng really need to try and fan the flames?

“Big Brother Wujiang, do you have any special instructions? Why are you here?” asked Mo Nian.

“Yeah, according to some reports I’ve received, there will be Heavenly Chosens attending this opening of Heaven Screen Mountain. However, it’s not clear exactly which faction and race they are from. Other than that, Devil Fall City is now teeming with heavenly geniuses. I feel like you two should take a stroll around. I can’t help you much, but within Devil Fall City, what I say counts. Which means what you say counts, don’t you think?” Xing Wujiang smiled.

Long Chen and Mo Nian immediately smiled as well. Xing Wujiang knew that Long Chen and Mo Nian had stayed in the territory of the Feather Spirit race all this time not just to train, but because they didn’t want to bring trouble to Xing Wujiang.

After all, this was Devil Fall City, and Xing Wujiang was the city lord. If something bad were to happen in Devil Fall City because of them, it would spell trouble for Xing Wujiang.

Xing Wujiang had been incredibly “busy” the last few days, so he felt bad for not being able to accompany his brothers. With all these heavenly geniuses gathering, there were all kinds of rare resources and special opportunities throughout the city, so this was a huge chance for everyone in Devil Fall City. Xing Wujiang didn’t want Long Chen and Mo Nian to miss out on this because of him.

After all, as city lord, if he couldn’t use his position to let his brothers roam around freely, then this position would really be worthless.

“Hehe, I’m at ease to hear Big Brother’s promise. It just so happens that I was planning to buy some things,” chortled Mo Nian.

“Alright. Then you can go. If anything happens, just mention my name. I don’t dare to say anything else, but before the Square Heaven Seal tears off its facade, you can definitely run rampant through the city as long as I’m present,” reassured Xing Wujiang as he patted his chest.

Before this, Xing Wujiang wouldn’t have dared to say such arrogant words. After all, once a person’s age reached a certain point, their wild arrogance of youth would fade away. However, after drinking with Long Chen and Mo Nian, he felt like he had returned to his youthful days—the time when it felt like everything was under his control.

Long Chen and Mo Nian quickly tidied up and said goodbye to Yu Luo. Hearing the news of their departure, Yu Luo wasn’t completely at ease, as Devil Fall City was now filled with new people. The four noble families were harboring ulterior motives as well. Although they had Xing Wujiang’s guarantee, Yu Luo didn’t feel like that was enough.

The Feather Spirit race would walk through fire for Long Chen, and they didn’t easily trust others. As a result, only with great effort from Long Chen did he manage to convince Yu Luo and the four Protector Elders not to come with them.

However, Yu Luo did request for them to bring Yu Tong and Yu Fei. That way, if there was any danger, Yu Luo would be able to instantly sense their location.

Long Chen naturally didn't refuse this proposal. Yu Fei and Yu Tong were very obedient, and he enjoyed their companionship. It just so happened that Yu Tong could be their guide.

The four of them left the Feather Spirit race’s territory. The moment they walked out of the gates, he sensed dozens of divine senses wantonly scanning them.

“It’s time to give them a lesson.”

Mo Nian’s expression sank. These people were like flies buzzing around them.
