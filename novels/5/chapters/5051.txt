Chapter 5040 The Long Clan’s Patriarch

When the dust settled, people’s vision slowly returned to the scene. A massive crater lay on the ground, resembling a giant bowl. Dirt and stone had melded together under intense heat, forming a solid, steel-like glassy surface.

Countless experts rushed over, their faces filled with terror as they saw this scene. They trembled at the sight of the slightly worn figure hovering in the sky.

One disciple of the Ye clan was brazen enough to run into the center of the battlefield. After retrieving a weapon fragment, he wailed, “This is a token of the clan leader...”

The other disciples started to look for remnants of their seniors. At first, they refused to believe their deaths, but finding their remnants gave them no choice but to accept this cruel reality.

Jiang Wuwang was also filled with pain as he looked around. He exchanged a pained glance with Feng Fei, both bearing expressions of helpless sorrow.

The person who felt most helpless was Feng Fei herself. She knew that provoking Long Chen was dangerous, and history showed that everyone who became his enemy would have a bad ending.

Yet this time, his enemies were incredibly powerful—so powerful that it induced despair. Feng Fei had thought that being able to retreat with his life would be a huge victory for him.

She had not expected Long Chen to be this powerful. Rather than retreating, he ensured that his enemies had no chance to retreat.

The higher-ups of the four divine clans, save for Long Qianxue, had been obliterated. This was a devastating blow to the four divine clans.

Hearing Long Qianxue wail, Feng Fei couldn’t help shouting through her own tears, “Why?! Why did it have to come to this before you felt regret?!”

The disciples of the four divine clans wept, but none dared seek revenge against Long Chen. They didn’t even dare to meet his gaze.

That had nothing to do with right or wrong, nor was it sympathy for Long Chen. It was simply because Long Chen had such immense power that they trembled at the mere thought of seeking vengeance.

As the echoes of crying reverberated across the devastated battlefield, it was the disciples of the Long clan who wept the hardest. Their once-proud clan now lay in ruins. It felt like they were being stabbed in the heart.

Meanwhile, Long Chen remained motionless in the air. He stood there without moving for what felt like an eternity, before finally starting to move.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to move; rather; his injuries were so severe that the pain was too much to bear when he tried to move.

After some time, he managed to recover enough to move. However, Long Chen knew he couldn’t continue fighting. Even though he still had his violet blood and seven-color Supreme Blood, his body couldn’t endure further strain.

“Mo Nian, I’ve avenged you...” Long Chen sighed, retrieving the shovel—the last memento of Mo Nian. Grief washed over him.

“Hold it...!” Long Chen suddenly noticed a line of small words on the shovel: “The Killer, Daddy Mo!”

“Mo Nian, you bastard!”

While this shovel might look identical to the one that Mo Nian used, its aura was slightly different. Reading the inscription, Long Chen instantly realized the truth.

Mo Nian had definitely conned the Brahma Pill Valley. Feeling worried that they wouldn’t know who had done it, he left behind his handiwork. But then, these idiots used it to con Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. It was all a misunderstanding, but it had almost dragged him down.

Hmph, if I were to die because of this, would you cut open your own stomach as atonement? Long Chen cursed inside.

He blamed himself for being foolish and not noticing the detail sooner. When Long Chen looked around, he spotted Long Tianrui.

“Do you want to avenge them?” asked Long Chen.

Long Tianrui looked back at him and shook her head expressionlessly. “Right and wrong mean nothing to me. My only purpose in life is to find a powerful man to pass down my innate talent. Everyone from the same era as me has died, and I don’t really care about the Long clan’s people. Furthermore, you didn’t do anything wrong.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen was a bit surprised by Long Tianrui’s response. He had never managed to understand her, but today, he felt pity for her.

Just as she said, everyone she had known was dead, and the only purpose left in her life was to pass down her inheritance. Perhaps after she did so, she might even choose to die, because living a life with no goals was its own kind of suffering.

Long Chen reflected on his attitude toward her and instantly felt a pang of guilt. Just as he was about to speak, a vast and powerful aura surged, startling him.

BOOM!

A huge explosive sound shook the world. The earth exploded, and Grand Dao runes whirled in the air. Three dragon figures swirled together and ascended.

The Heaven Overseer’s startled cry rang out in Long Chen’s mind. “The patriarch has come out of seclusion! Long Chen, you must flee!”

However, before Long Chen could move, a tall, white-haired elder appeared in the air, causing him to freeze in his place.

It wasn’t just him—no one could move. Long Chen was utterly astounded. Was the pressure from the Long clan patriarch truly this terrifying?

After surveying the surroundings, the patriarch suddenly roared, “What happened here?!”

This single roar was so powerful it felt like people’s heads would explode. Countless individuals directly passed out from the shock.

The Long clan patriarch had been in seclusion for the past few years, attempting to condense his third heaven vein. Only recently had he touched the boundary of the third heaven vein.

While it might sound like just one more heaven vein, the difference between three-vein and two-vein Heaven Saints was enormous. They were in completely different dimensions.

That was because three heaven veins could form a heaven vein dragon diagram, a natural manifestation of immense power. Once this manifestation formed, the expert would possess power far greater than a two-vein Heaven Saint. It was a qualitative change that couldn’t be quantified by simple numbers.

Originally, the patriarch was on the verge of success when Long Zhantian caused an uproar in the Long clan, forcing him to stop and come out to mediate things.

Afterward, he returned to seclusion with strict orders not to be disturbed unless the Long clan faced imminent destruction.

Now he had finally condensed three heaven veins, but upon emerging, he found the Long clan in ruins.

He wanted to demand an explanation from the clan leader, only to find he was gone. Long Qihua was also missing. The only one he spotted was the weeping Long Qianxue.

Without a word, he appeared in front of Long Qianxue and pressed a finger on her forehead, directly flipping through her recent memories.

After that, he turned to Long Chen, and the space around Long Chen instantly compressed on him.

“Die!” the patriarch roared, slamming a palm toward Long Chen.
