Chapter 3238 Terrifying Three-Eyed Lifeform

Long Chen thought of when he was in the Netherworld to break through to the Netherpassage realm. When leaving the gates of hell, he had stolen the door knocker.

That door knocker seemed to have been a seal. With it removed, a terrifying existence was unleashed.

At that time, Long Chen had immediately fled and didn’t get a clear look at that figure.

“Is that Heavenly King of yours a being with three heads?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, that is our great Heavenly King. Little fellow, you’re quite skilled to make the Heavenly King owe you a favor. You should leave this place and come to our Netherworld. As the junior brother of the Heavenly King, you will be able to obtain anything you want.” The three-eyed lifeform swallowed that Bone Blade Flame Devil that was in the Immortal King realm in just a few bites. He then grabbed another one and bit it in half.

Luo Changwu, Luo Changwen, and the others shivered. What kind of existence was this? Immortal Kings were consumed like snacks. Furthermore, those lifeforms didn’t even dare to resist.

Chu Yingxiong’s expression changed. He had never expected things to progress in such a way. This terrifying lifeform actually knew Long Chen and wanted a good relationship with him? A bad feeling then rose in his heart.

“I was the one who summoned you! Since you accepted my offerings, you must follow the contract! I order you to kill them!” Chu Yingxiong hid behind the pill furnace and shouted at that terrifying lifeform.

“Peh.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Hearing this, that lifeform spat in his direction. A large skull shot out of his mouth, whistling toward Chu Yingxiong.

With a bang, the skull landed on the furnace and transformed into dust. As for Chu Yingxiong, he coughed up blood, and the two divine statues crumbled, their divine light dissipating.

The pill furnace was undamaged, but Chu Yingxiong was severely impacted and almost died. Moreover, the two divine statues supporting him were destroyed.

If he hadn’t had those two divine statues from the start, he would have long since died. But while those two divine statues had managed to protect him this one time, it would only be once. Even the skull of that Immortal King lifeform was turned into dust. That power surpassed the understanding of everyone present.

This was not even an attack. It was a simple spitting of a skull, but it shattered both divine statues and caused Chu Yingxiong to lose their protection. The divine light around him then began to dim.

Long Chen suddenly extended a hand. Flame chains once more wrapped around the pill furnace, and it was pulled over to Long Chen.

“Get back-!”

Chu Yingxiong was shocked and tried to grab it. But he was one step too late. Just now, he had almost been killed, and having lost the support of his divine power, his reactions were clearly a bit slower.

Long Chen instantly threw the pill furnace into the primal chaos space. Once it was inside, Long Chen laughed. He almost started dancing with joy.

That was a King item! A treasure that only a World King could forge. With it, he was like a tiger with wings.

“Long Chen, you dare to steal Divine Venerate Daynight’s things?! You will face a terrible retribution!” shouted Chu Yingxiong as he coughed up blood.

That was a King item. Without a World King’s power, it should be impossible to control it. The only reason that Chu Yingxiong had been able to use it was because of the support of the divine statues. Hence, even now, he was unable to understand how Long Chen was able to take a King item.

Long Chen had taken it just like that, so Chu Yingxiong despaired. He had never expected to lose this way. How had his plan drawn out such a terrifying lifeform? How was this terrifying lifeform connected to Long Chen?

Just then, the sky abruptly changed and the stars shuddered. It was as if some power was gathering.

“Your world’s laws wish to kill me. I have to leave, or I’ll be killed.” The three-eyed lifeform directly killed the other lifeforms summoned by Chu Yingxiong. As for the rest, he tied them up with a cord, seemingly planning on bringing them away.

Long Chen hastily cried out, “Brother, can you leave one for me?”

“You want to eat one?” asked the three-eyed lifeform.

“No, not eat. I just have a use for it,” said Long Chen.

The Bone Blade Flame Devil possessed a devil core with immense flame energy. That was definitely great nourishment for Huo Long.

Furthermore, its bone blade was the condensation of its life’s energy. It was incredibly tough and was a natural flame element divine weapon. Both the devil core and bone blade were priceless treasures.

“Alright, I don’t mind not eating one. Without you, I wouldn’t have found so much prey at once as well. It can count as your reward.”

The three-eyed lifeform had tied them all up, but due to Long Chen, it tossed one back out to him.

It tied the rest of its prey to its waist and said, “Little fellow, do you really not want to come to the Netherworld? With the Heavenly King looking after you, you will be able to do whatever you want there.”

Long Chen was truly moved. This three-eyed lifeform seemed to be nothing more than a subordinate of the Heavenly King, but it was already so terrifying. Perhaps Long Chen would have it easier there.

However, when he thought about it, his action had been entirely unintentional. To have the other side repay that debt was the conduct of a petty man. Furthermore, he had his own pride. He couldn’t possibly live off of other people’s charity. Ultimately, he shook his head.

“I’m grateful for the Heavenly King’s good intentions. If you have a chance, please tell him that what I did back then was nothing more than an accident, so there’s no need to worry about it. I saved him once, and he saved me once, so we are even. If I have the chance, I might go to the Netherworld and drink a few cups with the Heavenly King.”

Just then, the stars in the sky gathered and the three-eyed lifeform nodded. Glancing at the sky, it dove back into the spatial gate, vanishing.

Once it was gone, that terrifying power gathering in the sky also faded. Everything returned to normal.

When the three-eyed lifeform appeared, everyone stopped fighting. Now that it was gone, Long Chen turned to Chu Yingxiong and smiled sinisterly.

“Your Chu family can rest in peace.”

Long Chen then grabbed the Bone Blade Flame Devil’s corpse with his left hand. With a lightning blade in his right hand, he charged at Chu Yingxiong.

BOOM!

Chu Yingxiong blocked, only to be knocked back. Without his divine energy supporting him, his aura instantly weakened.

“Chu Yingxiong, return my brothers’ lives!”

Just as Chu Yingxiong was knocked back, the Grand Elder charged toward him, becoming one with his sword.

Two sharp blades stabbed into two bodies. Seeing this, Long Chen jumped in shock. Why would the Grand Elder suddenly go so crazy as to die with his opponent?

The next moment, Luo Changwu’s sword slashed down, and Chu Yingxiong’s head went flying. As for Luo Changwen, his sword stabbed into Chu Yingxiong’s Dantian.

This was actually a combination attack. It looked very dangerous on the surface, but with all three of them cooperating, it was the most effective killing blow.

With Chu Yingxiong slain, the Chu family’s experts despaired. It was unknown who made the call first, but the Chu family’s experts began to flee in every direction.
