Chapter 2199 Betrayal

“Qu Jianying, your selfishness has led you to betray the will of the heavens. Do you think that on your own, you can fight against the rest of the world?” sneered the Dongfang family’s head.

They had multiple powerful divine items on their side. However, the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet was slowly pressing forward, forcing them all back. The ground constantly shook and exploded, unleashing huge waves that filled the sky.

“The Martial Heaven Alliance really lives up to being the number one alliance. Even though they have declined to the point of fracturing, their foundation still remains.”

The Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet was still pushing forward against so many powerful divine items. That sight was incomparably shocking.

“Qu Jianying, you’re using the power that the ancestors of the Martial Heaven Alliance left behind for fighting amongst ourselves instead of the incoming powerful enemies! If the ancestors were to learn of this, they definitely wouldn’t be able to rest in peace. You are the most muddleheaded leader throughout the history of the Martial Heaven Alliance. You’ve betrayed the hopes of everyone before you,” said the Dongfang family’s head righteously.

“Jiangying, I can’t endure it any longer. I’ll kill him,” said the old man suddenly.

“No, I need you to help me control the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet. If you run off, how am I supposed to handle them?!” shouted Qu Jianying.

At this moment, the old man had one hand pressed against Qu Jianying’s back, helping her control the tablet. However, his other hand was now on the hilt of the Heaven Splitting Blade.

Qu Jianying knew that if the old man went, he would definitely disregard his own life just to kill the shameless Dongfang family head. She understood his temper too well.

“What, are you going to ignore my orders? Have you forgotten what you promised me?” demanded Qu Jianying.

The old man clenched his teeth and slowly released the hilt of his blade. He pointed at the Dongfang family head, indicating for the latter to just wait until he killed him.

“Qu Jianying, don’t try to scare us. The Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet isn’t something someone like you can control. You can’t unleash its true power. The Martial Heaven Alliance is no longer complete, and without obtaining eighty percent support of the alliance, it’s impossible to use its full power. Adding on all your current members, you only have fifty percent. This is the result of your failure as a leader. Shouldn’t you hurry up and admit your mistakes?” sneered Yu Xiaoyun.

The divine mark on Yu Xiaoyun’s forehead lit up. The Daynight Furnace unleashed a ringing sound as it fought back against the tablet.

“This is the result of your schemes! You fractured the Martial Heaven Alliance just for today? Yu Xiaoyun, you really scheme deeply!” shouted Qu Jianying angrily.

“You can’t blame anyone else for your own failures. Perhaps a new alliance head was needed a long time ago. Everyone, what are you still waiting for?” Yu Xiaoyun turned to Peng Wanli and the others.

Peng Wanli and the others also took a deep breath and unleashed all their power, causing the light of their divine items to grow more intense.

The Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet was no longer able to continue pressing forward. It began to shake. Qu Jianying and the four Grand Elders started to feel the pressure.

“Support the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet!” Ye Lingshan took the lead and extended her hands. Light shot out of the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet, forming a bridge for her spiritual yuan to enter it.

The hundreds of thousands of experts from the Martial Heaven Alliance took action, sending their energy into the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet. Its light grew even more radiant, but against so many powerful divine items, it was still shaking. Its divine light seemed to be on the verge of crumbling.

“It’s no good. We are unable to draw out the full power of the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet. It’s on the verge of breaking!” Qu Jianying turned pale.

“Don’t worry. If the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet breaks, I’ll bring down a few of them to accompany it,” comforted the old man, killing intent raging in his eyes.

The neutral experts were all panicking inside. As these two sides clashed intensely, they could only watch. At this time, no matter who they helped, the other side would view them as their mortal enemy.

They had an urge to try mediating things, but this was no ordinary fight. There was no misunderstanding between the two sides. Instead, it was hate and a vow to not stop until death.

“Daoist Heavenly Feather, can you stop this battle?” Someone turned to Daoist Heavenly Feather, who had the highest seniority. Perhaps she was the only one with the power to stop this battle.

“Yes, Daoist Heavenly Feather, we’re all cultivators of the Martial Heaven Continent. Why must we fight to the point of killing ourselves? The sea demons have stepped foot onto the continent, and the dark era is coming. Every person is an important resource for the upcoming battles. There’s no need to exhaust ourselves against each other,” said someone else with a begging tone.

However, Daoist Heavenly Feather shook her head. “I understand your words, but the people on the battlefield also understand them as well. Because their goals are different, there’s no way for them to communicate. In this world, not all things can be settled with reason. Although everyone has said that martial power cannot resolve problems, sometimes martial power is the only choice. Long Chen is that kind of person. I’m sure everyone has seen the truth, but there are still people slandering him. Some people just don’t have a conscience. So what can I do about it?”

“Daoist Heavenly Feather, are you really saying that Long Chen is being set up?” asked one person probingly.

“The truth is no longer important. They want to kill Long Chen, and Long Chen wants to kill them. This is the result that they want. Have you not seen that Long Chen simply acts according to his own heart and doesn’t bother explaining himself? What he wants now is to kill all his enemies. Both sides wish to kill the other, so no one can advise them. Their goals are clear. Even a god could not change Long Chen’s determination. Do you think my words would change the mind of someone who dares to kill the heirs of Emperors? Just keep watching. Perhaps this is fate. If the Martial Heaven Continent’s core forces are too injured for the upcoming battles and break, then all we can say is that the continent’s destiny has come to an end,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather lightly.

Seeing the intense battle being fought, everyone felt afraid. If the world was destroyed, none of them would survive.

Beitang Rushuang clenched her fists, struggling over whether or not to help Long Chen. She had to fight for her family. If she helped him, she would be pulling her family onto Long Chen’s side.

Beitang Rushuang looked at Nangong Zuiyue. Although Nangong Zuiyue’s expression was still calm, Beitang Rushuang could see that she was struggling as well.

“Qingxuan, use the Brahma Divine Diagram to smash apart the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet!” shouted Yu Xiaoyun suddenly.

The Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet was rumbling, suppressed by the power of so many divine items. Even with the support of all the Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts, it was still at a clear disadvantage.

Everyone hastily turned to the Pill Fairy. After fighting with Long Chen, the Pill Fairy had not made another move. She had just watched, seeming to be thinking about something.

Being summoned by Yu Xiaoyun, she turned around. Her divine halo lit up.

“Don’t move.”

Out of nowhere, a foot-long dagger pressed against her snow-white neck. A cloaked maiden appeared beside the Pill Fairy.

That figure was small and slender, but her appearance stunned everyone.

“Dong Mingyu, what are you doing?!” raged Zhong Ziyang.

This maiden was the Bloodkill Hall’s divine daughter, Dong Mingyu. She was the Bloodkill Hall’s strongest assassin, an existence above all other assassins.

Dong Mingyu was someone from the Bloodkill Hall, and the Bloodkill Hall was allied with them. But now Dong Mingyu was pressing her dagger against the Pill Fairy’s neck. Everyone simply stared at her in dumbfounded silence. They were unable to wrap their heads around this reality.

“Don’t move!” Dong Mingyu’s dagger suddenly pressed into the Pill Fairy’s neck, leaving a small cut. Fresh blood slowly dripped down the dagger. “I am also a divine daughter. Your divine energy protection is useless against me. All I need to do is press down slightly and your head will fall. So don’t try anything funny. Otherwise, I’ll really be forced to kill you.”

Dong Mingyu also had a divine halo behind her head. However, Dong Mingyu’s aura was nonexistent. It was impossible to sense. The only thing that revealed her existence was their sight, but without that, no one would believe that someone was there.

“Why?” demanded the Pill Fairy. She didn’t dare to move.

“For a certain person.”

Dong Mingyu looked toward Long Chen. She smiled faintly.

“All disciples of the Bloodkill Hall, hear my orders! Kill the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance!” shouted Zhong Ziyang. However, even after a few seconds, not one person responded to him.

“No need to shout again. I’ve sent those people to the Killing God. Let alone them, even the Killing God’s statue has been smashed apart. Have you not noticed? The divine light of your Killing God Imperial Decree already dissipated,” said Dong Mingyu indifferently.

Zhong Ziyang looked at his waist, and his expression completely changed. He shouted, “Dong Mingyu, you... you dare to betray the Killing God?!”

Dong Mingyu smiled. “Who cares about this betrayal? My life was given to me by him. He showed me another kind of life. He showed me there is something called kindness in this world. He showed me something known as warmth. As for the Killing God? He simply uses us as tools for killing and gathering faith energy. He didn’t give me anything. He was using me, while I also thirsted for greater power, so it wasn’t a betrayal. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement. I worked hard at my cultivation so that one day I could repay him.”

“Who is he?!” roared Zhong Ziyang.

“Do you need to ask? He is Long Chen.” Dong Mingyu suddenly pulled back her hood, revealing a young face that caused startled cries to ring out amongst the crowd.
