Chapter 2647 Unable to Acknowledge a Master

“Zi Yan!”

Long Chen stood outside a sea of lightning and saw someone who looked like a celestial fairy sitting within it.

Zi Yan slowly opened her eyes. Upon seeing Long Chen’s concerned gaze, a warm smile appeared on her face. “What? Why are your eyes so big? Do you not recognize me?”

Zi Yan truly did look different from before. Not wearing her normal white robes, she was dressed in a violet dress instead. Hence, Long Chen couldn’t help being reminded of Sovereign Han Wei.

“This generation’s master of the Southern Sea Zither can be considered a continuation of my life. You have to treat her properly. Have confidence in her.” Sovereign Han Wei’s voice resounded in his mind.

In her violet dress, Zi Yan appeared majestic and noble, like a goddess. It was similar to Sovereign Han Wei.

“You’re just so beautiful that I forgot to breathe, so beautiful that I think of the lovers from my past life, so beautiful that I would go through water and fire for you. I would topple this entire world for you,” said Long Chen, his voice quivering slightly.

Sovereign Han Wei was the one in this world with the closest nature to him. It felt like they were soulmates. Despite her having left this world tens of thousands of years ago, his heart ached whenever he thought of her.

Long Chen wished that Sovereign Han Wei hadn’t died. He wished that he could save her. If so, he would be willing to overthrow this world with her.

Right now, Zi Yan turned as red as an apple. Long Chen had never said such explicit words to her, so she rebuked, “Are you trying to harm me? I’m in the middle of my tribulation, and you’re disturbing my Dao-heart.”

“Oh, sorry…” Long Chen hastily apologized.

Those words had popped out of his mouth without thinking. Now he recalled that Zi Yan was in the midst of a dangerous tribulation and had to maintain a clear heart. Saying these things would increase the danger.

Zi Yan was Zi Yan. Sovereign Han was Sovereign Han Wei. How could he treat Zi Yan as an image of Sovereign Han Wei?

“Do you like these new clothes?” Zi Yan touched her dress, muttering almost without realizing it.

“I’ll like you no matter what you wear,” said Long Chen. If he was speaking to Tang Wan-er, he would definitely say that he’d like her even better if she wasn’t wearing any clothes, but he couldn’t say such a thing to Zi Yan.

Zi Yan smiled. “In truth, I also like these new clothes. So I’ll just keep wearing these in the future. You should leave quickly. If you’re here, I won’t be able to put my heart at rest.”

Long Chen smiled and left. Despite that, Zi Yan’s heart continued pounding hard in her chest. At this moment, a voice rang out in her mind.

“How is it? Didn’t I tell you that these clothes were most suited to you?”

“Senior Southern Sea, why did you make me wear these clothes today? I was even scolded by the Music Master. Hehe, but Long Chen seems to like them a lot. The scolding was worth it.” Once Long Chen was gone, Zi Yan couldn’t maintain her previous composure.

“Because these clothes suit you the most. You will understand in the future.”

“Senior, why would you have these clothes?” asked Zi Yan. This purple dress had been given to her by the Southern Sea Zither, and it had requested that she wore them today.

“They belonged to my last master. She was the same as you, smart, wise, with astonishing talent in the Music Dao…” The Southern Sea Zither lost itself in memories.

“The Music Master wants me to become your master as fast as possible. She says that even the Western Desert Ax has acknowledged a master. Am I so lacking that I’m not worth being your master?” asked Zi Yan suddenly.

The Western Desert Ax had immediately taken Wilde as its master as soon as it appeared, merging with his blood. However, there wasn’t the slightest change by her and Ye Zhiqiu. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You haven’t mentioned the matters between us to her, right?” asked the Southern Sea Zither.

“No. I don’t divulge the secrets between us to anyone,” said Zi Yan.

The Southern Sea Zither had begun communicating with Zi Yan a long time ago, but it had also said that this communication was secret.

That was why everyone within the Illusive Music Immortal Palace thought that Zi Yan had yet to obtain the Southern Sea Zither’s acknowledgment. Perhaps seeing the Western Desert Ax acknowledge a master had made them anxious, so they were telling Zi Yan to think of any way possible to get the Southern Sea Zither to acknowledge her as its master. The war was about to start. Any longer and it would be too late.

“Good. Remember, our secrets cannot be mentioned to anyone. The reason I have not acknowledged a master isn’t because of me but because of you,” said the Southern Sea Zither.

“Because of me?” Zi Yan was befuddled.

“You and that girl with the Northern Source Sword are the same. Both of you have reasons that you haven’t been acknowledged yet. The Northern Source Sword is incredibly arrogant and cold. It has never communed with Ye Zhiqiu. It’s very patient though and is still waiting. I am also waiting. As for that foolish brat Wilde, the reason the Western Desert Ax chose him is due to the destiny binding them together. As for you and me, our destiny has yet to arrive. Don’t worry. You don’t need to feel pressured by the Illusive Music Immortal Palace. Everything will come naturally,” said the Southern Sea Zither.

“But, the Music Master…”

“Ignore her. You just need to work hard. That’s enough. Calm down and focus on passing this tribulation. If your mental state remains so rattled, it will accelerate the pace of your tribulation. Just wait until the karmic luck support appears and then go all-out. In the chaos, you can get your share,” said the Southern Sea Zither.

Zi Yan nodded and closed her eyes. She allowed the wild lightning to continue flowing around her, and she didn’t antagonize it. Everything followed the prescribed order. Not everyone was like the Dragonblood Legion, attacking the heavenly tribulation so fiercely.

After Long Chen left Zi Yan’s side, he sensed Ye Liangchen, Long Aotian, Jiang Wuchen, and Feng Fei’s auras. They had also started their tribulations. But there was no sign of that fabled karmic luck support.

Long Chen also saw Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang. The two of them were calmly sitting in their heavenly tribulations with no special phenomenon occurring around them either.

Nangong Zuiyue was completely calm with no fluctuations. She merely smiled in greeting to Long Chen when he arrived.

On the other hand, Beitang Rushuang’s expression was a bit unsightly. She was clearly disappointed. She hadn’t won this prize.

Everyone undergoing tribulation now was having their tribulations progress slowly. They were waiting for the manifestation of the karmic luck support to appear.

Long Chen’s heart suddenly shook as he sensed something, so he flew over in another direction, quickly arriving at a barren desert. There was another sea of lightning here. Within it was the white-robed Yun Tian standing with his hands clasped behind his back. Even as lightning descended from the sky, he remained indifferent, untouched.

Yun Tian smiled at Long Chen. “Even now, are you still unresigned?”
