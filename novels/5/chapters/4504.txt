Chapter 4493 Clump of Saint Energy

Long Chen pointed a finger. There was no burst of divine light, no dazzling divine radiance. Yet, the nether dragon race leader’s Yuan Spirit exploded.

“I understand. Within my spiritual space, I can summon my battle armor and harness the power of the primal chaos space.” Long Chen stared at his own hands in amazement.

In this moment of revelation, he discovered an immense and formidable power within himself. With just a thought, he could even annihilate Saints.

This was Long Chen’s first time utilizing the power of the primal chaos space beyond its world. When its power poured through him, he felt like the master of the entire world. It was as if his word was law, and no one could defy him.

With this feeling coursing through him, he understood why something as strong as the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest would instantly become obedient upon entering the primal chaos space.

The primal chaos space reigned supreme within its domain. When Long Chen summoned his battle armor in his spiritual space, he could only tap into a fraction of the primal chaos space’s power. However, even that portion proved more than enough to easily slay Saints.

“Senior, do you know how to use the primal chaos space’s power?” asked Long Chen excitedly.

If he could control the primal chaos space, then who cared about Saints? He could simply wipe them out with a single thought, and they wouldn’t even have the power to resist.

“You should figure some things out yourself. I only told you this because, even without my guidance, you would have been forced to do this when pushed to the brink in combat with him. So this doesn’t count as karma. But as for the rest, I can’t say. It might bring calamity upon you,” said the Earth Cauldron.

After Long Chen heard that, most of his joy faded. He was unmatched in his spiritual space, but just how useful was that? His enemy would need to invade his spiritual space with their Yuan Spirit, and there was no way for him to forcibly draw other people’s Yuan Spirits into his spiritual domain.

In other words, unless someone tried to possess him, this unmatched move was worthless.

Long Chen felt like he was sitting on a mountain of gold while barely surviving on scraps. He had no idea how to use this mountain of gold.

Clearly, the Earth Cauldron knew more, but it wouldn’t tell him. Long Chen didn’t know what he felt about that.

If he didn’t know the primal chaos space’s power, perhaps he’d feel better. However, now that he had tasted what it felt to be in control of it, the realization that he couldn’t utilize it felt even more disheartening.

At this time, a clump of energy appeared in his spiritual space, and there were threads of black energy flowing within it. This fist-sized clump actually contained apocalyptic power.

“This is…”

“This is the power of that nether dragon’s life. In order to possess you, he moved all of his energy into you. This is the energy that heaven and earth gave him. When someone dies, their energy should return to heaven and earth. However, since he died in your spiritual space and you are the master of this space, well, you understand,” explained the Earth Cauldron.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You’re saying that I can absorb it?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course, but you can also return it to the world,” replied the Earth Cauldron, and it sounded completely casual about it.

“No way. This world has always been targeting me. Why would I return anything to it? Impossible.” Long Chen snorted and grabbed the clump of light.

The Earth Cauldron quivered ever so slightly the moment Long Chen touched the clump of light. It was as if it wanted to say something but was hesitating.

However, Long Chen didn’t notice that. All his attention was on the clump of energy.

This clump of energy didn’t possess any of the aura of the nether dragon race leader. The Earth Cauldron was correct; this was purely the power of heaven and earth.

It was masterless, or it should be said that its master was the world. The nether dragon race leader had possessed this power because the world had lent it to him, and now that he died, it returned to the world.

If it was the nether dragon race leader’s energy, Long Chen would disdain absorbing it. But if it was this world’s energy, then absorbing it felt refreshing to Long Chen, like getting a bit of vengeance.

At this moment, Long Chen’s hand quivered, and that clump of light exploded, its wild power coursing through him.

The wild power seemed to try to break free as it flowed through him, trying to return to the world.

However, just as it started, those threads of black light, which were originally the most berserk, suddenly vanished.

Once they vanished, the rest of the energy seemed to lose any remaining will and settled within Long Chen.

In an instant, Long Chen’s Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone blazed with light as they greedily absorbed this energy. In particular, the runes on his dragon tendons crazily strengthened themselves off of this energy.

Afraid of being outmatched, the seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood also absorbed this energy. In response, the runes within Long Chen’s blood swiftly expanded. Once reaching a critical point, they divided, with one rune splitting into two.

The newly formed runes transcended their predecessors, surpassing them in strength by over tenfold. Long Chen’s aura surged wildly, and the might of his Blood Qi raged through the surrounding space with unbridled intensity.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen shouted excitedly. He felt like he had completely transformed. This disastrous calamity suddenly became a great fortune, and his power was rising crazily.

Just as Long Chen was shouting excitedly, two runes lit up on the Earth Cauldron. They were like two eyes staring at the depths of the Divine Gate.

Behind the divine gate, a black figure vanished in a flash. The Earth Cauldron just sighed and didn’t speak any further.

At this moment, flames burned around Long Chen, and lightning surged out of him. The entire palace rumbled and started to collapse.

As this energy merged with him, a powerful resonance emerged, causing the entire palace to unravel. Externally, flames and lightning intertwined, while internally, Long Chen’s blood coursed so vigorously that it echoed like thunder, accompanied by the sound of breaking bones.

Successive bone spurs burst out of Long Chen’s skin and fell to the ground. New bone runes appeared, forcibly stripping away the original outer layer of his bones.

Despite the excruciating pain, Long Chen’s excitement was obvious. Even if the agony intensified tenfold or a hundredfold, it was worthwhile for him.

Regretfully, this energy was ultimately limited. After the span of an incense stick burning, it was fully absorbed without a trace. Long Chen felt full of inexhaustible energy.

He slowly raised his head with a sinister smile.

BOOM!

Suddenly, he unleashed a claw, causing the palace to explode and exposing numerous experts of the nether dragon race.

“Congratulations on coming out of seclusion, race leader! The possession was a success!” exclaimed one of the elders, overcome with excitement as he hastily kowtowed before Long Chen.

The others were just about to kowtow when they saw Long Chen’s hand slam through that elder’s head, killing him.
