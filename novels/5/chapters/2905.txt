Chapter 2894 God Institute’s Divine Competition

The divine competition was a yearly competition held by the God Institute. This was the only way for ordinary disciples without any background or wealth to join the ranks of the elites in the inner academy.

According to the academy’s rules, outer academy disciples would directly join the inner academy upon reaching the Divine Flame realm. However, if they advanced through that process, their treatment would only be slightly better compared to in the outer academy.

However, if they passed through this competition, their treatment would be completely different. This competition could be considered a turning point in the disciples’ cultivation paths.

Although those who could come to the High Firmament Academy mostly had decent financial circumstances, it was only at the level of ‘decent’. The immortal world was simply enormous, and there were endless sects and experts.

Because of that, the number of geniuses in this world was endless. There were plenty of talented people from places with money, but even those like Li Cai and the others, with their financial power, didn't have the power to directly join the inner academy. Hence, it could be seen just how much wealth was required to enter the inner academy directly.

The High Firmament Academy’s rules were very simple. If you were a true genius, then don’t worry. There would be plenty of resources available to you.

However, if you weren’t a genius, you could still come, but don’t forget to bring money. Even if you were trash, if you had the money, you could still enter.

Using these people’s words, they were using the money of the mediocre to raise the geniuses. Geniuses needed resources, and the mediocre wanted the reputation. Both sides got what they wanted.

However, people without money also had a chance. People without good talent or family circumstances had to work with their life on the line in order to obtain things that others could obtain simply by reaching out their hand.

There was nothing absolutely fair in this world. But the academy’s rules were all good things to every person who came.

Whether it was Mu Qingyun or Luo Bing, neither of them was qualified to directly enter the inner academy. That was why they were all fighting for this chance.

Mu Qingyun had already lost one chance. If she failed again, she would not be able to try again. That was because her cultivation base was already at the peak of Mortal Transcendence, and she would soon enter the Divine Flame realm. If she failed this time, she couldn’t possibly wait another year. She was currently in her golden cultivation period and couldn’t waste this time.

If she failed, she could only make her breakthrough and become an ordinary inner academy disciple.

Everyone else in the Unfettered Alliance had the same fate as her. These rules might be cruel, but they were fair. In this world, opportunities could only be grasped by a select few.

At this moment, Long Chen led them to the plaza, which was already packed with countless people. All the disciples of every institute were allied to watch this competition. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, there were so many people that some of them had started camping out here a few days in advance. Some slower ones didn’t even have a chance to find a spot and had to stand at a great distance.

When Long Chen walked in, all eyes concentrated on him.

“Hehe, the newcomer Boss Long San with the greatest limelight in the entire academy has finally entered the stage. A good show is about to start.”

“He entered as a worker and soared into becoming a disciple of the Pill Institute in an instant. He also possesses his status as an instructor of the God Institute. How amazing.”

“Is your news outdated? Boss Long San already has another status: he’s an instructor of the Immortal Institute as well! Furthermore, Heaven Master Dong Ming personally bestowed that status on him. It can be said that the Immortal Institute cares about him even more than the God Institute. Others want to become instructors for the benefits, but Boss Long San is apparently a genius at refining pills and magical arts. Hence, the Immortal Institute wants to focus on grooming him. Just watch, it won’t be long before the youngest Heaven Master of the High Firmament Academy’s history appears,” said someone.

“Hmph, you keep calling him Boss Long San. Are you willing to be his subordinate? What kind of ability does he have to make you flatter him so much? He’s a lower world ascender who didn’t even have the money to pay for the registration fee. He had to cheat by going through the path of a worker. Just how inferior do you feel about yourselves to call him boss? Are you not worried about losing the face of your ancestors?” sneered someone else. The people around this person were instantly enraged.

“Are you an idiot? The boss here is nothing more than an honorific, just like young master. What does it have to do with our ancestors?”

“Boss Long San didn’t walk an ordinary path. So what? Aren’t you just an ordinary disciple of the inner academy? You’re not even an elite disciple. What qualifications do you have to look down on others?”

“Little fellow, I’ve remembered you! Just wait. Don’t let me run into you again, or I’ll make you kneel and call me daddy so that you understand the difference between Boss Long San and daddy.”

Seeing so many fierce gazes cast his way, that person instantly became afraid. After a moment’s hesitation, he gave up his spot and fled.

“Count yourself smart. Otherwise, once I know who you are, you are a dead man,” sneered someone else. By slipping away, that person took advantage of no one knowing who he was. He finally experienced what it meant for a mouth to bring about calamity.

Countless people whispered to themselves, clearly discussing Long Chen. Also, quite a few brazen female disciples actually waved at him.

Once some started waving, others started greeting him. A few of them even shouted his name.

“Hehe, brother San, your charisma really is big. These senior apprentice-sisters have even started to seduce you,” giggled Zhong Ling.

The academy did not prevent matters between a man and woman as it even permitted dual cultivation. However, those who wished to dual cultivate had to register within the academy, or if they were caught, they would be expelled from the academy.

Thus, there weren’t too many taboos between the men and women of the academy, so some people liked to be brazen.

With Long Chen’s soaring fame, his limitless potential, and his appearance, many women wished to dual cultivate with him. For them to express that to him openly was not an embarrassing thing.

“Brother San, why act so cool? Say hello to those senior apprentice-sisters. Perhaps some of them might become Sister-in-Law San in the future,” giggled Zhong Xiu.

“Your sisters-in-law won’t appear here. Those kinds of feelings are purely a kind of resonance between souls, not two people having their own goals in interacting. If it was purely for cultivation and only later were feelings born, it would be an insult to love.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Long Chen!”

Just as Long Chen reached their position, Luo Bing and Luo Ning ran in.
