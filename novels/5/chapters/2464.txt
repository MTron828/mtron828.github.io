Chapter 2454 Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree

Translator: BornToBe

The black spears were condensed from the black soil in Long Chen’s primal chaos space. As he wasn’t an earth cultivator, in theory, he shouldn’t be able to do such a thing, but upon reaching the third step of Netherpassage and gaining control of death energy, he was able to imitate the techniques of earth cultivators through the black soil’s particular energy.

These earthen spears were not tough at all. They smashed into the tree’s divine light barrier and were blasted apart.

However, they left behind patches of dark air. It was like the very void was being infected by black particles. It could be said that Long Chen had finally reached the level of being able to unleash the power of the black soil.

At this moment, the other tree demons launched their attacks at Long Chen. Wooden thorns and whistling vines fell upon him from every direction.

Long Chen snorted and clapped his hands together. The space behind him exploded, unleashing a torrent of black soil upon this world.

The tree demons screamed upon contact with the black soil. The nearby trees quickly withered and died.

“Stop, stop!”

The ancient tree cried out in fear. The endless black soil finally made it feel fear.

Long Chen stopped pouring out more of the black soil. He had formed a small mountain of it behind him.

The tree demons that had attacked him had turned to dust. Only the ancient tree was able to endure.

Long Chen asked, “What is it? Is it time to negotiate?”

The old man appeared once more, but this time he had black specks all over his body. Having silently fallen for Long Chen’s trap, he was unable to force away Long Chen’s death energy.

Although it could be said that his life energy had reached an almost limitless level, the power of the black soil restrained him. If he allowed it to continue, he would slowly be killed.

Now when he looked at Long Chen, his expression was extremely ugly. Clenching his teeth, he demanded, “What do you want?”

“I want all the precious medicines in this place. I don’t want much, just one of each. I’m not a greedy person,” said Long Chen.

“Fine.” This demand was acceptable to the elder.

“Other than that, I want your Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit,” said Long Chen with an evil smile.

“Impossible! That is the concentration of my life’s cultivation base. Don’t even think about it!” raged the elder. He suddenly realized, “So you knew who I was from the start!”

“Hehe, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree is an ancient species said to have gone extinct in the era of myths. How could I not know?”

If Long Chen hadn’t realized who it was, how could he have known that this elder’s act was not sincere at all? It was precisely because Long Chen had figured out that it was a Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit that he was sure he could handle it.

There was a recording of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree within the Pill Sovereign memories. Its fruit was a thirteenth tier medicinal ingredient. The fruit itself contained its own spirituality, one that would make any spirit pills refined from it craftier, but not more brutal.

This kind of spirit pill was the kind that alchemists had to be on guard against, as they often acted gentle only to trick them. They were more aware of a human’s weaknesses and would take advantage of an opening to flee or even devour the alchemist.

This was the nature of the fruit, which stemmed from the tree. This kind of demonic tree was infamous in the age of myths.

Its act of being friends with the human race was all nonsense. Furthermore, when Long Chen tested it by asking it about the battle from back then, it didn’t avoid answering it. That was when Long Chen was sure it was a con.

This was a question he had previously asked the Life Spirit God, but it hadn’t answered, only saying that the karma was not something that he could endure.

Since the Life Spirit God didn’t dare to mention it, while this elder was casually talking about it while drinking, it was clear that there was a problem with the wine.

That was why Long Chen had intentionally used an extremely ancient form of drinking etiquette, covering up his actions with his sleeves. He hadn’t drunk the wine but simply pulled it into the primal chaos space.

To avoid exposing himself, he even acted like it wasn’t good wine and compared it to the Wine God Palace’s wine. That was to draw the elder’s attention while he silently drew out the black soil whose aura he had suppressed.

Now he had an absolute advantage, and so he directly extorted the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree for its medicines and fruit.

Long Chen didn’t say anything in regard to the elder’s rejection. He just stared at him.

Being stared at by Long Chen, the elder’s hair stood on end. He clenched his teeth and extended a hand. A peach-like fruit appeared in his hand. However, it was covered in dense scales.

“Here. You can go now. This fruit is equivalent to a thousand years of my cultivation.”

Long Chen received it with a smile. “The legendary Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit. Hehe, this is something good.”

Long Chen put it away and then kept staring at the Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit. Once more, he didn’t say anything and simply stared.

“You… What do you want? Don’t go too far!” raged the elder.

“No, I never go too far,” said Long Chen.

“Then why aren’t you leaving? You can go pick one of every medicine in the forest and scram,” said the elder coldly.

“It seems that only a single Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit isn’t very useful to me,” said Long Chen, seemingly embarrassed.

“How many do you want?!”

Long Chen rubbed his hands bashfully. “I’m not greedy. I naturally only want as many as there are.”

“You… you… Die!”

The Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree went crazy. Countless branches pierced toward Long Chen like sharp blades, so quickly that he didn’t have time to summon the black soil. Its goal was clearly to kill Long Chen in an instant before he could do anything else.

A pill furnace appeared around Long Chen, and all those powerful branches struck it. However, Long Chen still coughed up a mouthful of blood.

This full-power attack from the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree was so powerful that even with the Demon Moon Furnace protecting him, a portion of it transmitted through and struck him. It felt like he was being struck by countless whips.

Long Chen was enraged. As expected, legends couldn’t be counted upon. Wasn’t it said that while the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees were very crafty, their guts were very small? He had thought that the black soil would be enough to intimidate it into not attacking.

Fortunately, the Demon Moon Furnace was still able to block the branches. This Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree was incredibly powerful. Even though it wasn’t a fighting type of tree demon, it was still an existence above the Netherpassage realm.

“I gave you face but you didn’t give me any. Huo Linger, incinerate it.”

Long Chen directly gave the order for Huo Linger to come out. The Demon Moon Furnace’s runes lit up, and flames gushed out.

Flame runes soared out of the Demon Moon Furnace, and a wave of heat startled the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree. Its branches were instantly set ablaze and being rapidly burned up.

When it tried to suppress the flames, it was horrified to find that they could not be extinguished. Not only that, but the flames were also sucking up its vitality.

Horrified, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree cut off its own branches and retreated. Those flames terrified it.

With the branches retreating, the Demon Moon Furnace’s lid popped open. Flames roared out in the form of a giant flame dragon.

Runes fell from the leaves of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree, isolating it from the flames. They formed a giant wall.

The Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree was enormous, and the giant flame dragon appeared miniscule in comparison. However, when the flame dragon struck the leaves, they were instantly incinerated, turning to ash in less than a breath’s time.

Rumbling rang out and black soil poured out of the void. Death Qi filled the air.

“Stop, stop!” cried out the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree.

“Why should I? You didn’t give me any face. The last time I stopped, you were secretly accumulating power to kill me. If I don’t teach you a lesson, who’s to say that you won’t do the same thing?” raged Long Chen.

The black soil quickly filled up this entire island. The Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree was surrounded by it, and its bright leaves began to show black splotches.

With it blocking the flame dragon’s attacks and the black soil’s invasion, it was starting to find it hard to keep up.

“Stop! I’ll give you the Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit! If you keep attacking, it’ll harm my source, and I’ll need to use them to make up for it instead!” shouted the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree in a panic. It was finally afraid. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The flame dragon was attacking from above, while the black soil was invading from below. If this continued, he would only be able to last until all his Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit were used up.

Long Chen finally stopped pouring out more black soil and had Huo Linger stop. However, he remained ready.

“Hand over all of your fruit. If I think you’re holding back on me, I’ll kill you,” demanded Long Chen.
