Chapter 3519

At the next house, an elder with a natural, posed bearing welcomed them. Also, he had a noble air around him, one that startled Long Chen. That was something that came from the depths of the soul. It was a kind of ruler qi.

Hence, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan’s hearts shook. This elder was definitely a major figure with an amazing backstory. Even the qi flow of the ten thousand Daos was concentrated into him, and yet he was willing to just stay here and make wine.

Moreover, although this elder possessed this ruler qi, his tone was calm and peaceful. He invited the two of them to his house and offered them his wine.

When Long Chen tasted the wine, he instantly felt a vast murderous aura strike him right in his soul. At that instant, he seemed to be able to see a brave warrior in armor wielding a spear, crazily killing powerful enemies.

Mountains of corpses, rivers of blood. He led countless warriors in battle.

Taking over cities, protecting his territory, settling the chaos of war. He made countless meritorious contributions.

This elder was filled with a grand aura. Despite being old, despite his heart being calm now, this wine was unable to conceal his heroic spirit.

Long Chen sighed. “As the storm rages, the people endure. As the emperor talks of ruling the universe, it still isn’t better than a good drink!”

Long Chen had heard this little verse back in the mortal world. He simply felt it to be very heroic, so he liked it.

When he drank this senior’s wine, he couldn’t help repeating it. He felt as if this verse had been written just for this senior.

“Hahaha, what a nice verse. Junior brother is a literary talent. I like it. As the emperor talks of ruling the universe, it still isn’t better than a good drink!” The elder’s laugh was like thunder, shaking the ten thousand Daos.

“Senior overpraises me. It wasn’t this junior brother that came up with this verse. This verse was definitely made by a hero like senior,” said Long Chen, shaking his head.

This person had a shocking background and had endured great storms and waves. He had seen the world flourish but hadn’t been lost within it. In the end, he came to comprehend the true essence of life and chose his own Dao, immersing himself within the Wine Dao, living an unfettered life. This was a kind of transcendence. Long Chen was thousands of miles away from such a realm.

“Hahaha, that’s not important. For you to be capable of comprehending the meaning within this verse and the feeling within my wine, it’s proof that we are kindred spirits. Come, junior brother, let’s toast!” said the elder grandly.

Before this, his aura was still reserved. Now that he was excited, his ruler qi silently unfurled. Hence, Yu Qingxuan felt her soul start to shake. She couldn’t help being shocked. Just what kind of cultivation base did this person have?

As for Long Chen, he didn’t seem affected by his ruler's pressure at all. He cheerfully touched cups with the elder. Both of them then finished their cup in one gulp, looked at each other, and laughed.

As the two of them chatted, they grew even more excited. What shocked Yu Qingxuan the most was that as they discussed the Wine Dao, a sharp murderous aura rose. Looking outside the window, it seemed that the wind and clouds had changed color.

The two of them went from the Wine Dao to discussing the Martial Dao, and then from the Martial Dao to the Heavenly Daos. They touched on various aspects of learning. Long Chen was capable of talking with him smoothly, so the two of them grew increasingly excited. In less than an incense stick’s worth of time, they had drunk thirty jugs of wine.

With so much wine in his stomach, Long Chen suddenly felt the world spinning around him. He then tilted to the side and collapsed, fast asleep.

Seeing that Long Chen couldn’t bear his wine, the elder laughed. He poured himself three more large bowls of his wine before turning to Yu Qingxuan.

“You are Dongfang Zichu’s apprentice, correct?”

“You know my old master?” asked Yu Qingxuan, feeling surprised and delighted.

The elder said, “I suppose that we know each other. Does he treat you well?”

“Master has always treated me like his own daughter,” said Yu Qingxuan. From this person’s tone, it seemed that he was from the same generation as her master. As a result, she felt even greater reverence for the elder now.

Dongfang Zichu was a Divine Venerate and had lived for countless years. In the Daluo Star-Field, there was no one that didn’t know his name.

Yu Qingxuan was born in the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect. It was said to be the best place for dual flame-and-pill cultivation, so many of their disciples were both flame cultivators and alchemists. This taboo cultivation style in the mortal world was actually treated as nothing special in the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect.

With the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect’s disciples being both alchemists and flame cultivators, they were incredibly powerful. In the Daluo Star-Field, the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect was a holy land that stood at the very peak. Even women and children were aware of it.

As for the sect master, it was precisely Dongfang Zichu. He was also the founder of the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect. This sect with tens of millions of years of history only had one sect master all of this time.

Dongfang Zichu was famous, and yet he rarely revealed himself. Everyone had heard of his name, but almost no one had ever seen him.

Dongfang Zichu had taken only four disciples at the start of his life. That was something from tens of millions of years ago. Unfortunately, his disciples had not managed to become Divine Venerates and had all died.

It had been tens of millions of years since Dongfang Zichu had taken in any disciples. But in this generation, Yu Qingxuan was noticed, and this expert that had been slumbering for countless years was moved. He then accepted his fifth disciple, Yu Qingxuan. It was also said that she would be his final disciple.

The final disciple of an almighty Divine Venerate. Just how glorious was such a status? Thus, with this halo of light around her, no one dared to treat Yu Qingxuan with the slightest disrespect.

If it weren’t for the Chaotic Star Sea being particularly special, Yu Qingxuan wouldn’t even need any guards because no one dared to touch her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although Yu Qingxuan was Dongfang Zichu’s disciple, even after all these years, she had only seen her master three times.

Every time they met, Dongfang Zichu would ask her about her cultivation, see if she had encountered any bottlenecks, and explain some of her questions.

Although it was just three times, to Yu Qingxuan who lacked a father and mother, that felt like a huge grace. She was full of gratitude toward Dongfang Zichu. Deep inside her soul, she even viewed him as a father.

Hearing that, the elder nodded and didn’t say anything else about it. He asked her about her current cultivation state and gave her a few tiny pointers that benefitted her immensely. She was very grateful toward this elder who possessed ruler qi.

After a bit, Long Chen woke up and awkwardly laughed. “Junior was rude. Senior’s wine is truly powerful.”

Long Chen’s alcohol tolerance was shocking, so it was his first time collapsing on the table from drinking. This elder’s wine was truly domineering. Even he wasn’t able to endure it.

The elder smiled. “You’re already very amazing. I thought that you would sleep for a full day and night, but you woke up in just two hours. It seems that your physical body is even stronger than I estimated. This girl is a good and kind lady. Make sure to protect her.”

The elder suddenly said such a thing, so Yu Qingxuan blushed and Long Chen was startled. Despite not quite understanding it, Long Chen solemnly swore, “I will properly protect her. Anyone who wishes to harm her will have to step over my corpse.”

“Good, that’s the grandeur a man should have. I won’t keep you for too long today. This little bit of wine that I have is all yours!” The elder smiled and took out hundreds of jugs of wine.

Long Chen laughed. Not standing on any courtesy, he took them all. This elder’s wine was definitely top tier. It was extremely domineering, capable of cleansing the soul. It had inestimable benefits for cultivation.

Long Chen thanked the elder and left with Yu Qingxuan. As for the elder, as he watched them leave, his smile slowly vanished, being replaced with a grave expression.
