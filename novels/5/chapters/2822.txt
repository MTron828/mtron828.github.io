Chapter 2811 Once More Encountering the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid

The man looked to be in his forties, and his gaze was sharp. The scars of time had left their mark on his face but only gave him an increased charisma of maturity.

In his youth, this middle-aged man was definitely a handsome man. Furthermore, he possessed a noble Dao charm around him.

When that man arrived, he saw the disciple under Long Chen’s foot and frowned. However, when he looked at Long Chen, he paused for a moment. It seemed that he sensed something about Long Chen.

Just as he was about to speak, his gaze swept over the crowd and he spotted the sweeping elder. He instantly vanished from the sky, reappearing in front of the elder and bowing. “Disciple He Ziyu greets senior. I hope I haven’t alarmed you.”

This prestigious Seven Star Elder was actually bowing to a sweeping elder, stunning everyone. The law enforcement disciples in particular were shaken. They had previously shouted rudely at this elder. Now, their hearts clenched.

The elder continued to sweep with his head down. He didn’t look at the Seven Star Elder and lightly said, “This old man is just a sweeper. I don’t dare to accept Seven Star Elder’s concern. However, after so many years, someone without a good temper has finally appeared in the Pill Institute. It’s interesting.”

“Disciple understands. Disciple will handle this matter properly.” The Seven Star Elder once more bowed and turned to Long Chen, as well as the law enforcement disciple. He suddenly waved his hand. After that, Long Chen only felt the space twist, and without any ability to twist, he appeared within a palace.

However, the palace was empty of anyone else. It was just him. Long Chen looked around and saw a statue at the front of the palace.

The statue was already worn down. Some spots had appeared on it, but when touched, there wasn’t even a speck of dust on it.

There was an offering table in front of the statue. Two candles the thickness of arms were lit, emitting a seven-colored flame that cast the palace in a mysterious light.

“They’re just candles, but their power is many times stronger than my Pill Flame.” Long Chen was amazed inside when he sensed the majestic energy of the lit candles.

Everything in the immortal world was unknown to him, filled with mystery. It gave him a feeling of powerlessness. Long Chen was originally someone that stood at the peak of the Martial Heaven Continent, but here, he was buried by countless experts. He didn’t even have a chance to stand out.

He then walked to the front of the statue. Seeing that the table was covered in various fruits, he didn’t stand on courtesy. He picked one up and bit into it. Juice immediately burst out of it. It was refreshingly sweet.

The juice entered his stomach and transformed into immortal spiritual qi that slowly drove away his mortal energy. It was actually even more effective than the Mortal Ascension Pill.

Long Chen tossed the pit into the primal chaos space once he was done with the fruit. It slowly germinated.

“Nice, the primal chaos space is still effective in the immortal world.” Long Chen was originally worried that the primal chaos bead might not be able to allow the Immortal World’s spiritual plants to grow, so he was happy to see this.

The number one requirement for cultivation was neither talent nor aptitude nor effort nor willpower. It was resources. Without any resources, everything else was nonsense.

Since the primal chaos bead was still an endless cornucopia for him, his original worries vanished like smoke. With the primal chaos bead, he didn’t need to worry about running out of resources.

Even if he wasn’t in the High Firmament Academy, he had a way to make money. With one bead, the heavens would fall to him.

Just as Long Chen was eating the spiritual fruits without the slightest scruple, two pairs of eyes stared at him from another room.

One of them was the Seven Star Elder, He Ziyu. The other was a white-robed elder with white hair and a rosy face.

The elder watched as Long Chen ate the fruits on the offerings table. His expression was odd. “He really is unrestrained. His Blood Qi is mixed with the dragon race’s aura. Moreover, his Spiritual Strength is a clash of two opposing forces that result in unstable fluctuations. I’ve never seen such a person refine pills before. But I personally checked his exam. All his answers merited full marks. However, with that explosive temper… can he really calm down enough to refine pills?”

“When I first saw him, I saw the Pill Sovereign’s Divine Radiance appear on him,” said the Seven Star Elder.

“The Pill Sovereign’s Divine Radiance? Are you sure?” asked the elder, shocked.

“Although it was just a flash, I’m sure. That’s why I sent him to the ancestral palace for observation.” The Seven Star Elder nodded. “Furthermore, the senior cleaning the institute also mentioned him.”

The elder gasped. “That senior was already here when the dean arrived. His seniority is shocking. However, even after so many years, he’s never bothered with matters of the academy. For him to mention this person, it must have some deeper meaning.”

“Institute head, what do you think? How should I arrange things?” probed the Seven Star Elder.

This elder was the one in charge of the Pill Institute. The High Firmament Academy had multiple institutes, and those in charge of them were addressed as institute heads. As for the head of the overall academy, they were called the dean.

“There’s nothing to arrange. Treat him as you would normally. The lower levels of the academy are already filled with rot and decay, almost corrupt to the bone. I’ve brought this up to the dean multiple times, but he merely brushed me off with a smile. It’s incomprehensible. I cannot see through the dean’s mind. If this Long Chen has the Pill Sovereign’s Divine Radiance, then he must have used the Pill Dao to corroborate his Dao in the lower plane. Even in the immortal world, his Pill Sovereign’s Divine Radiance is still able to manifest. That means that his Pill Dao can reach limitless heights. Such a genius cannot be pushed out. However, he cannot be indulged, or it would break the rules,” said the institute head.

“Understood.” The Seven Star Elder nodded and left.

The institute head then stared at Long Chen for a long time alone. He shook his head. “Brazen, coarse, explosive. Such a person can really use the Pill Dao to ascend to the immortal world?”

…

Long Chen was still enjoying all the various fruits. As he did, he examined the statue more closely. It looked almost like a melting ice sculpture, and its face was already unclear. Based on the hands and feet, it seemed more like a woman.

Suddenly, the fruit in his hand dropped to the ground. He felt like he was struck by lightning. In that statue’s hand was a flower.

This flower was also part of the carving and not an actual flower. But Long Chen’s heart pounded when he saw it.

“The Jewel Blood Jade Orchid.”

This flower was the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid. In his entire life, he had only ever seen one. The instant he saw it, its name and the story related to it automatically appeared in his mind.

At that time, he had given it to Yu Qingxuan. When Yu Qingxuan had sacrificed her life for him, it had reappeared. It had then absorbed her Blood qi and vanished along with her.

Now that he saw it again in the hand of this statue, he instantly thought of her.

“You recognize this flower?”

The Seven Star Elder had appeared within the palace at some point. He couldn’t help asking when he saw Long Chen staring in shock at the flower.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
