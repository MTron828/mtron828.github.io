Chapter 2166 Five Element Sun Hunting

A ray of divine light flashed, appearing in front of Kun Pengzi in an instant, closing in on one of his giant eyes.

BOOM! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Kun Pengzi had been fighting against the silver drake king, while this attack came silently. By the time he sensed it, it was too late to dodge. He could only twist his head and avoid letting it strike his eye. It landed on his forehead instead.

Many of Kun Pengzi’s feathers blew off, a large hole appearing in his head. Blood drenched the nearby feathers.

“Kun Pengzi, you hunted me down with a giant group last time. It should be my turn now.” Mo Nian’s voice rang out. That attack had come from the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow. He was displeased that his attack had been sensed in the end.

Mo Nian was also covered in blood, and parts of his clothes were destroyed. He had clearly just gone through a bloody battle.

With his first attack not achieving his desired effect, Mo Nian let out a shout. His manifestation appeared, including the two large figures.

When those two figures appeared, the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow blazed with light. He pulled back on the bowstring. As he pulled, the world twisted, becoming deformed due to some kind of power.

“When did his Five Element Sun Hunting Bow become so powerful?” Long Chen’s heart shook. The current Five Element Sun Hunting Bow seemed to have merged with the world. When Mo Nian pulled back the string, the world’s energy merged into it.

A huge arrow condensed within heaven and earth. This was the exact opposite of the previous silent attack. This was an arrow that rang out as loudly as thunder.

“Kunpeng Voidbreaker!”

Even Kun Pengzi’s expression changed in the face of this terrifying arrow. Thunderforce gathered together, and a lightning arrow shot out of his eyes.

BOOM!

The two arrows crashed together, causing the world to shake. Mo Nian was blown back, coughing up a mouthful of blood.

Kun Pengzi’s giant body flipped through the air. His feathers dimmed, losing a bit of their blazing light. That last attack had clearly cost him.

The drake king took advantage of this moment to grab Kun Pengzi’s wings with its claws and pull.

The drake king’s claws were like hooks trying to tear Kun Pengzi apart, but his body was too strong. Sparks appeared and a metallic sound rang out.

Kun Pengzi let out a furious howl. A vast, ancient, and berserk aura suddenly exploded out of him. The drake king was blown back as Kun Pengzi’s Blood Qi was fluctuating wildly. A terrifying bloodline pressure appeared.

“He’s burning his essence blood. Long Chen, help me out!” shouted Mo Nian. Having exchanged blows with Kun Pengzi before, Mo Nian knew that Kun Pengzi had stimulated his ancestral blood. In this state, he could use extremely ancient divine abilities.

Long Chen appeared behind Mo Nian. Placing his hand on his back, Long Chen’s spiritual yuan poured into Mo Nian’s body.

“Damn, you have so much spiritual yuan?” Mo Nian jumped in shock.

Originally, he had thought that Long Chen would have used up most of his spiritual yuan after fighting Kun Pengzi. He himself had used up a great deal of spiritual yuan, which was why he needed Long Chen’s help.

“I didn’t have a chance to use a divine item’s power, so there was nowhere to spend it. Stop talking and kill this bastard!” shouted Long Chen.

Evilmoon was still slumbering, so he didn’t need to activate any divine item. Even after the battle in the End of the Heavens Valley and in the Xuantian Dao Sect, he hadn’t used up much spiritual yuan.

As for the World Extermination Flame Lotus, that did use up a great deal of energy, but with its long cast time, he hadn’t had time to unleash it.

“Nice!” Feeling the limitless spiritual yuan pouring into him, Mo Nian was delighted. His bow shook as five streams of energy poured into it.

These five streams of energy were visible to the naked eye. They contained the essence of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. As these five energies merged, heaven and earth changed color.

“Five Element Sun Hunting!”

Mo Nian released his hand, and an arrow shot out at Kun Pengzi.

The feathers on Kun Pengzi’s body dimmed. In exchange, the feathers on one of his wings raised, crackling with lightning. Like a sharp blade, it slashed in front of him.

Kun Pengzi’s full-strength attack was still unable to break the attack from Mo Nian containing Long Chen’s spiritual yuan. A giant hole was pierced in his wing.

After that, the drake king’s tail whipped toward him, sending Kun Pengzi smashing into the ground, leaving a giant ditch.

“AHHHH!” Kun Pengzi suddenly reverted to his human form. His eyes were scarlet, and his hair was standing on end. Covered in blood, he let out a heaven-shaking roar. “You bastards, just wait! Once I awaken my emperor blood, I’ll take your lives!”

Long Chen and Mo Nian, as well as the drake king, were too powerful for him to defeat.

“Let’s not wait. We’re all busy, so let’s fight to the death right here.” Mo Nian raised his bow once more.

He found that with Long Chen’s seemingly limitless stores of spiritual yuan, he could unleash another powerful arrow with no problem. Long Chen was definitely a monster when it came to his spiritual yuan reserves.

The world twisted once more as an arrow condensed. Kun Pengzi’s expression immediately changed.

Kun Pengzi’s lightning halberd shook, and he vanished from his original location, appearing outside of the battlefield. He waved his hand, shooting a lightning chain that wrapped around Huang Feiyan. Pulling her, he transformed into a bolt of lightning, vanishing.

The Xuan Beasts who had come also fled at this moment, while the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s experts and the Dragonblood warriors gave chase. However, Long Chen shouted at them to stop.

After that, the lightning channel shook. The silver drake king was forced to return, disappearing from sight.

The void rumbled. Countless experts rushed over, alarming the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. They were about to attack when Long Chen shouted, “They’re on our side!”

The people coming were the old man, Boss Bao, and the other experts of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. Just a moment after them, Qu Jianying and Li Tianxuan arrived.

“It seems that we arrived late.” Li Tianxuan shook his head upon seeing the corpses.

Li Tianxuan had arranged everything in the Xuantian Dao Sect. The Xuantian Tower had been returned to the grand formation and activated to maintain a combat-ready state.

“Where are they?!” The old man rushed over, killing intent soaring out of him.

“They ran,” sighed Long Chen.

“Let’s go fucking kill them! First we’ll go to the Xuan Beasts, then to the Corrupt path!” raged the old man.

Li Tianxuan stealthily cast a glance at Qu Jianying, indicating for her to stop the old man. Now was not the time to be rash.

Qu Jianying bitterly smiled. The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect had been attacked right on their doorstep. The old man had never received such an insult before. In his current rage, no one could advise him.

“Old man, leave it be.” Long Chen grabbed the old man and shook his head.

The old man couldn’t believe his eyes. “Brat, have you taken a blow to the head? How is it acceptable to just leave this be?”

“We’re not leaving this be, we’re waiting for the qi flow eruption. I know you’re angry. I’m actually angrier than you, but let me be willful this time!”

“No, since when can the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s men be insulted and not find revenge? What are you afraid of? With me present, even if the heavens collapse, I’ll raise them up!”

Long Chen looked around and saw that thousands of experts had come. He could only spiritually communicate. “Old man, do you not know what kind of person I am? Do you really think I’m just going to suck this up? Let me tell you, they’ve really pissed me off this time, so I’m planning something big. I promise that if I don’t kill them until they cry for their parents, I won’t be Long Chen. Endure it for now, and allow those fellows secretly swaying in the wind to join them. That way, we can settle them all when the time comes. At that time, we’ll kill until we’re happy.”

Only when Long Chen put it this way did the old man’s expression improve a bit, but he was still filled with rage.

“That’s enough. Listen to me about this matter, and I guarantee you’ll get a satisfactory ending from it. When have I ever disappointed you?” Long Chen patted the old man’s shoulder.

The old man also thought that Long Chen wouldn’t lie about this. His guts weren’t smaller than his. In the end, he said, “Fine, I’ll listen. If you dare to con me, be careful of getting beaten up by me.”
