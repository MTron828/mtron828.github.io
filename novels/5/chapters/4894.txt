Chapter 4883 Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress

Evilmoon quivered, and a blood-colored divine radiance slashed out of its edge. Long Chen’s dragon blood power fully erupted at that moment, merging with Evil Moon.

This attack was neither a magical art nor a divine ability; it was a simple slash. Yet, all of Long Chen’s dragon blood power was infused into it.

In his blood ignition state, power was swelling within Long Chen, threatening to make him explode if he didn’t release it.

While Evilmoon couldn't assist Long Chen directly, it could withstand any amount of power he channeled through it without the risk of being damaged. After all, this wild dragon blood power would have instantly crumbled a different divine weapon. Even a Heaven Saint divine weapon might not necessarily be able to endure all his power concentrating on its edge.

Just like that, Evilmoon cut open the heaven screen, severing the bindings of space and the laws of the ten thousand Daos. A wave of power crashed toward Huo Qianwu.

Huo Qianwu had not expected such a thunderous attack from Long Chen. Her Blaze Dragon Bone Whip quivered, instantly coiling around her arms. No one understood what she was doing as binding her hands seemed like surrendering to them.

However, at the next moment, her Heavenly Fate Disc quivered, and divine radiance blazed out of it, flowing into her back, then her arms, hands, and finally into her Blaze Dragon Bone Whip.

“Blaze Dragon Heaven Roar!”

As a brilliant dragon cry rang out, millions of runes lit up on the bone whip, condensing into a giant flame dragon that roared at Long Chen’s incoming attack.

Long Chen’s merciless snort rang out. “A mantis trying to stop a carriage. You overestimate your own power!”

BOOM!

Evilmoon slashed into the giant flame dragon. Despite its majestic might, the flame dragon instantly crumbled, transforming into specks of light, while Evilmoon continued onwards, unimpeded.

“What?!”

Jiang Yiban and the others from the Flame Divine Hall were completely shocked.

“How can that be?! The Blaze Dragon Heaven Roar is one of the divine abilities engraved on the blaze dragon’s bones, and its power isn’t inferior to the original dragon roar!” exclaimed one of their Heaven Saints.

The Blaze Dragon Bone Whip was a supreme flame weapon, and in order to preserve its dragon nature, the Flame Divine Hall had invested countless resources into it. However, the simple swing of Long Chen’s saber had easily broken its strongest divine ability, causing the vice hall master’s expression to change.

“His dragon blood power...” the vice hall master muttered. He had noticed where the problem was.

There weren’t any flaws with the Blaze Dragon Heaven Roar; it was simply crushed because the two dragon powers were not on the same level. In other words, the blaze dragon couldn’t roar in front of Long Chen.

The vice hall master’s sharp vision instantly caught the issue at hand. This was precisely why Long Chen mocked Huo Qianwu for not knowing her place.

By igniting his dragon blood, Long Chen summoned an unprecedentedly powerful Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor. The eruption of his dragon blood unleashed a vast and formidable dragon might that even he hadn't anticipated.

Huo Qianwu, however, foolishly chose to use a divine ability of the dragon race to block this attack instead of employing her strongest Doyen power. That was incurably foolish.

Evilmoon was already in front of Huo Qianwu. To everyone’s astonishment, even with her counterattack destroyed, Huo Qianwu didn’t dodge or use other divine abilities. She directly raised her arms to block Long Chen’s attack, and Evilmoon descended on the dragon bone whip wrapped around her hands.

BOOM!

The barrier cracked, almost exploding because of their power.

However, Long Chen was surprised to see that Huo Qianwu was unharmed. When his attack landed, her robes were blasted off, the tatters flying through the air like butterflies. Even her Heavenly Fate Disc quivered and flickered.

Beneath her robes, she wore a dark red dress that appeared to be made of countless quivering flame feathers. A powerful divine might emanated from it.

Jaws dropped in astonishment. Unexpectedly, in addition to the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, Huo Qianwu possessed another supreme divine weapon—a flame feather dress. Moreover, this dress seemed even stronger than her Blaze Dragon Bone Whip.

Countless experts gasped. As expected, geniuses were supported by a mountain of resources. She actually possessed two Heaven Saint divine weapons. Even if she weren’t a Heavenly Chosen, who could possibly beat her?

After all, ninety-nine percent of the heavenly geniuses here were unqualified to possess a Heaven Saint divine weapon. In fact, even amongst Heaven Saints, many of their Heaven Saint divine weapons were incomplete.

This was because even a Heaven Saint wouldn’t necessarily be able to afford a complete Heaven Saint divine weapon. They would need to buy their own materials and request someone to forge it. Then, they would use their soul to nourish it, sacrificing their blood to strengthen it. After investing countless resources and years of careful nurturing, they would have a Heaven Saint divine weapon with spirituality.

A Heaven Saint divine weapon’s spirituality was related to its resonance with its master. Amongst Heaven Saint divine weapons, they could be classified as low grade, middle grade, high grade, and top grade.

Among the Flame Divine Hall’s experts, only Jiang Yiban’s weapon was considered high grade, and the others only possessed middle-grade weapons. As for rogue Heaven Saints, most of them only possessed low-grade weapons.

On the other hand, Huo Qianwu possessed two top-grade Heaven Saint divine weapons, sparking jealousy among the young disciples. Just then, the red feathers from her dress quivered, and Long Chen felt an immense force push him back.

Long Chen was forced back seven steps, each step causing the void to collapse. Only then did he manage to stabilize himself.

“As expected, you have some ability. Unfortunately, you aren’t qualified to compete with me. No matter how strong you are, you won’t be able to escape death today.” Huo Qianwu glared at Long Chen, clenching the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip.

Seeing Long Chen staring at her dress, she sneered, “This dress’s name is the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress. It was made from one thousand ancient phoenix true feathers that had reached the Heaven Saint level. Go ahead and look carefully. This kind of divine object is something an ant like you won’t get to see again in this lifetime.”

Hearing this dress’s origins, the experts outside gasped. No wonder she was so confident. This dress was terrifying. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“This dress really isn’t bad.”

Long Chen eyed the feather dress, his eyes slowly turning blue with greed.
