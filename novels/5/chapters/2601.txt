Chapter 2590 Fighting the Devil Lord

The whip was only a few meters long, but as it struck through the air, the void split apart and an invisible blade sliced through the air, slashing toward the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

“You’re the one forcing me to do this.” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord snorted and let out a single punch. As a result, the void exploded, and from within it, he pulled out the tip of a whip. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

With a wave of his left hand, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord dragged Liu Ruyan’s attack from out of the void. Both of them seemed to have transcended the limits of space.

“Hmph.” Liu Ruyan snorted. Her whip quivered, transforming into a wooden spear. At the same time, countless thorns grew out of it.

Upon seeing this attack, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s expression changed. He immediately let go of the spear and slashed his golden halberd out.

BOOM!

At some point, Liu Ruyan’s other hand had transformed into a black sword stabbing toward his chest. His golden halberd blocked her strange attack, but multiple bloody holes appeared in his left hand.

Liu Ruyan’s wooden thorns were so incredibly sharp that the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s body, which was able to ignore Guo Ran’s attack, couldn’t block it.

Liu Ruyan had started awakening the Undying Willow race’s divine abilities ever since she had obtained help from the mother tree. It could be said that she was the one benefitting the most from their excursion to the Star Field Divine World.

“Courting death!” The pain in his arm finally caused the Blood Fiend Devil Lord to grow angry. The blood sun shuddered, and his halberd erupted with divine light.

Facing it, the giant willow behind Liu Ruyan swayed and divine light fell from its branches. Runes condensed into a giant shield before her.

BOOM!

The golden halberd stabbed into a wooden shield, which then exploded and transformed into black spears shooting at the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

As soon as the shield stopped the halberd, it switched to offense. Those wooden spears were like black lightning. Even an armor made of immortal metal would be unable to stop them.

BOOM!

The blood sun shuddered, and a wave of light blasted apart the spears.

From within the black splinters that filled the air, a whip struck out like a viper.

“What quick changes between moves. No wonder she dared to challenge boss in the Star Field Divine World.” Gu Yang and the others were startled by the current Liu Ruyan, who was like a goddess of war

Guo Ran became covered in sweat. He had originally thought that he had become the strongest existence in the Dragonblood Legion other than his boss. However, he hadn’t expected Liu Ruyan to have hidden her true power to this extent.

Every clash of golden and black light caused the world to shake. This was a truly stunning battle. Guo Ran’s previous fight was like child’s play in comparison.

Heavenly Dao energy was being consumed by the giant willow and condensed into black runes that enveloped Liu Ruyan.

At this moment, Guo Ran and the others recognized it as the same state that the mother tree and Ling Xi were in. However, Liu Ruyan was both beings in one. She had never separated.

With the willow absorbing an endless stream of the world’s energy for Liu Ruyan, it could be said that her power would never run out as long as the Martial Heaven Continent’s Heavenly Dao energy didn’t run out.

“The Undying race really is frightening. Fortunately, boss beat her, or we’d have to face such a powerful opponent,” said Gu Yang gratefully.

“Shhh! If she heard that, she’d definitely find trouble for boss! This big sister can only be matched by big sister Chu Yao. Speaking of which…” Guo Ran hastily turned back.

“No need to look. We arrived a long time ago. We just didn’t reveal ourselves because we wanted to experience daddy Guo’s marvelous display.” The void quivered. Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, and Cloud all appeared.

Even with Guo Ran’s thick skin, he felt his face burning. He had an urge to find a place to hide himself. After that, he quickly found a target to vent. “Zifeng, you refused to come with us and then snuck your way over, huh?”

“I wasn’t going to come, but when I went to the Heavenly Sword Gate, my master was in seclusion, so I decided to come over. I didn’t expect the Blood race to have such a terrifying expert,” said Yue Zifeng.

Dong Mingyu looked at the blood sun gravely. “That blood sun is strange. Within the divine inheritance of the Bloodkill Hall, there seems to be something similar to it. But I’m not quite clear on it. This blood sun seems to represent some world’s strongest laws. This Blood Fiend Devil Lord is probably an existence with the entire world’s karmic luck concentrated within him. That’s why he can enter the Martial Heaven Continent without being suppressed by its laws.”

It was no wonder this fellow dared to charge out, while his seven Sovereign sprout guards stayed in the Yin Yang World.

“How can there be such a heaven-defying existence? Can’t he just charge onto the Martial Heaven Continent?” asked Gu Yang.

Dong Mingyu shook her head. “No. His blood sun is like a divine item with its own energy stores. He can resist the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent for however long that energy holds up. Once that energy is exhausted, he’ll be in danger, so he won’t stay for too long. At the very least, before the Yin Yang World’s aura fully infects the Martial Heaven Continent, his blood sun’s energy is not limitless.”

Despite only having the appearance of a girl between thirteen and fourteen years old, Dong Mingyu was a divine daughter with a god’s inheritance. She knew more than most people.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the blood sun’s light grew explosively, blasting apart Liu Ruyan’s attacks. Even the black runes surrounding her crumbled.

“The Blood Fiend Devil Lord is drawing out the power of the blood sun to face big sister Ruyan. We should fight together.” Dong Mingyu’s figure suddenly vanished.

“Die!” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord roared, along with the roar of ten thousand beasts from within his blood sun. Following that, a golden halberd appeared in the blood sun, and two halberds slashed toward Liu Ruyan.

The halberd of the blood sun contained the aura of a whole world. Hence, the Martial Heaven Continent’s laws were blasted apart in front of it.

“Endless Falling Wood, Sky Holding Shield.”

A wooden staff appeared in the air. It looked incredibly unremarkable, but as Chu Yao formed hand seals, countless runes lit up on it. Wooden stakes appeared in midair, weaving together.

With the wooden staff as the core, millions of wooden stakes twisted into a giant shield. At the same time, boundless life energy thrummed through the air.

This wooden staff was a gift Leng Yueyan had given to Chu Yao, and Chu Yao had been nourishing it with her soul ever since. Due to her low cultivation base, she had previously been unable to draw out its full power.

However, with the help of the mother tree, this divine item had finally awoken. The world’s life energy was now hers to control.

BOOM!

The giant shield was blown back by the giant halberd. Countless cracks appeared on it. However, as life energy circulated through it, the cracks quickly healed.

“Oh?” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord was surprised to see that this shield could block his attack. His halberd’s energy was slowly ground down.

“A mantis trying to stop a chariot. Laughable.” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s blood sun shook, and a divine diagram appeared within it. This diagram was of an endless world containing countless living creatures.

BOOM!

Chu Yao’s shield finally exploded. After that, the golden halberd continued piercing toward Liu Ruyan. It was as if Chu Yao’s shield hadn’t managed to weaken it at all.

At this moment, the void twisted, and a phoenix charged toward the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. As the phoenix cried out, everyone’s souls quivered. This was a spiritual attack.

“You dare take out such an insignificant trick against me?” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord sneered. A spiritual sword then shot out of his head. This meant that the Blood Fiend Devil Lord was actually skilled in soul arts. His spiritual sword had blood-colored specks of light on it, most likely not a pure soul art but something mixed with his Blood Qi.

BOOM!

The phoenix exploded instantly, startling the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. The phoenix was much weaker than he had anticipated.

In that brief moment of confusion, the phoenix exploded into butterflies that filled the sky. With every flap of their wings, divine light turned the world into a wonderland. It was a scene of such beauty that it intoxicated people.

“Not good!” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s expression changed. He instantly realized that the fierce attack was nothing more than bait. The true attack lay in an illusion art. The instant those butterflies appeared in his sight, his spiritual energy began to fade away.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord bit his tongue, using the pain to wake himself up. The brief moment of confusion had caused his giant halberd to vanish. Multiple attacks were now falling on him.

Meng Qi’s spiritual swords, Chu Yao’s wooden stakes, Tang Wan-er’s wind blades, Liu Ruyan’s whip, Ye Zhiqiu’s ice sword, Gu Yang’s spear, Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s earth giants were concentrating all their power on him in one world-shaking blow.
