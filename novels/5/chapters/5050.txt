Chapter 5039 World Destroying Attack

As Long Chen and the thirty-six Pill Valley experts exchanged blows, he was shocked to discover their ability to merge all their power into a single unified force. There was no opening for him to exploit.

In other words, no matter which one of them he attacked, he would need to deal with all of them. It was Long Chen’s first time encountering such a terrifying formation art.

Their connection was practically flawless, even surpassing that of the Dragonblood warriors’. However, Long Chen quickly deduced their method. Their link seemed to harness Lord Brahma’s faith energy, which enabled them to unify their powers seamlessly.

Unfortunately, understanding their technique didn’t provide Long Chen with a way to stop them. Perhaps if he could use the dragon blood God Slaying Cross again, he could break their formation, but his last attack had used up all his dragon blood power. Though he still possessed his violet blood and seven-color Supreme Blood, he doubted their effectiveness against this unified force.

Long Chen found himself without the means to deal with them. According to the Earth Cauldron, he could always run if he couldn’t beat them. It was ready to bring him away at any time.

However, he was unwilling to just leave like this. Just as he reached his wits’ end, they started to chant the Nirvana Scripture.

The Nirvana Scripture resonated throughout heaven and earth, and the flame energy of the world responded to their call. Their formation grew stronger, transforming this place into a world of flames.

“I’ll go big this time!”

Instead of charging out of the heaven-encompassing flame nets layering on top of him, Long Chen raised his hand and conjured a flame lotus on it.

When it materialized, space twisted wildly, and the flame runes in the air started to pulse uneasily. Even the Pill Valley experts could not remain calm at the sight of the flame lotus.

“What is that?!”

“It’s the Moon Flame!”

“No, there’s also the Sun Flame!”

“That white flame, it’s the Ice Soul Divine Flame!”

There were thousands of flames in Long Chen’s hands, but three burned the most intensely. They swirled crazily within the flame lotus, causing it to expand frantically.

“How can this be?! How can he control so many Heavenly Flames?!” The leader was also shocked.

At this moment, Long Chen’s expression turned serious. He opened his mouth and started to chant as well. His voice echoed throughout heaven and earth, eclipsing their chanting.

Buzz.

All the flame energy of heaven and earth suddenly froze. Following that, it poured into the flame lotus like rivers feeding into the sea.

The wild flame energy surged like soldiers on a battlefield responding to their commander’s call. Ignoring the Pill Valley’s experts, they flowed into the flame lotus.

All the flame energy of heaven and earth was sucked into the flame lotus, causing it to grow even faster. Even the condensed flame nets went out of control and were devoured by the flame lotus.

“What?! How could it devour our magical arts?!” The Brahma Pill Valley experts cried out in shock, witnessing a situation they had never encountered.

Once sixteen of their flame nets were devoured, Long Chen’s soul suddenly shuddered. Huo Linger’s urgent voice rang out in his mind. “Big Brother Long Chen, you have to release it! Otherwise, it will spiral out of control, and I won’t be able to protect you!”

Long Chen had a bad feeling. He had wanted to absorb all their flame energies, but the power behind this move exceeded his expectations. He swiftly flung the flame lotus to the ground.

Before it could explode, Huo Linger transformed into a flame lotus that wrapped around Long Chen. Meanwhile, the Brahma Pill Valley’s experts cried out and switched hand seals, transforming the remaining flame nets into a giant flame shield in front of them.

BOOM!

A thunderous explosion erupted, obliterating everything in its path. Huo Linger was violently expelled from her dragon form, transforming into a mass of runes that scattered through the air. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Long Chen felt like he was being torn apart, his body covered in wounds. He coughed up blood and was thrown into the sky.

Spacetime spiraled into chaos. Light and dark reversed, and ancient Grand Dao runes raged. All the Long clan’s structures, built over countless eons, were reduced to dust in an instant.

“How was this move so terrifying?!” Long Chen was bewildered, feeling as though the bone in his body had shattered.

Had Huo Linger not helped him block the strongest impact, he might have died because of his own technique. This outcome had completely caught him off guard.

“The nets you absorbed contained their core runes. When they merged with the Sun, Moon, and Ice Soul Divine Flames, the latter instantly erupted. With your power and Huo Linger’s, you couldn’t fully unleash the flames potential. But their core runes are different. Boosted by heaven vein dragon qi, the flames’ power directly surged to a new level,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

In truth, Long Chen hadn’t fully grasped the terrifying nature of the flames ranked in the top ten of the Heavenly Flame Rankings. Due to Huo Linger’s limited power, the flames could yet reveal their true prowess.

These three flames could be considered firewood, while Long Chen and Huo Linger’s power resembled sparks. Though the sparks could ignite the wood, only a tiny part of them burned.

On the other hand, the core runes of these heaven vein experts acted like oil added to firewood—just one spark was enough to ignite them instantly.

Realizing this, Long Chen felt fortunate that he had stopped his absorption midway. His original plan to devour all their flame nets would surely have led to his death.

This single attack wrought absolute devastation within the area. Outside the Long clan’s territory, Long Tianrui, Long Qianxue, the Heaven Overseer, Feng Fei, and Jiang Wuwang stared in shock.

They had been transported out and had just turned back to observe the battle’s aftermath when it seemed like a sun had exploded in the core region.

They personally witnessed the grand formation keeping that area under containment explode, destroying the entire Long clan’s territory. Astral winds cut through the Heavenly Desolation Domain, razing this picturesque land to the ground.

Even from a distance, the suffocating astral winds threatened to tear their souls apart.

Long Qianxue rushed forward, followed closely by the Heaven Overseer, both overwhelmed with grief. Could the Long clan have been destroyed so swiftly? They had to see what had happened.

Arriving at the domain of the Long clan, they almost didn’t recognize where they were. At the heart of the battlefield, they saw only Long Chen hovering in the air—everyone else’s presence had vanished.

One attack had crushed everyone, leaving no trace of their bodies behind.

Seeing this devastation. Long Qianxue suddenly wailed, “How... how can this be?!"
