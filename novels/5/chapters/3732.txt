Chapter 3721 Once More Seeing the Kunpeng

That single pair of wings covered the entire sky, tearing through the void and forcibly creating a spatial channel. Countless figures then came flying out of it.

All of them were as large as mountains. But in front of that pair of wings, they appeared completely miniscule.

Roars, howls, bird cries, and other animal sounds rang out. When they appeared, menacing air filled the world.

“It’s the demonic beast race!”

Startled cries rang out. Those giant figures were ancient beasts. There were giant dragons, flying phoenixes, divine tortoises, and wild wolves. At the rear, there was a sea of beasts. The experts here were unable to even differentiate what they were.

It was like the heavens had been pierced, and a sea of beasts came flooding out, instantly filling the sky. All of them possessed shocking Blood Qis.

The endless demonic beasts fell to the ground, transforming into human form once they landed. Their gazes then arrogantly swept across the others present.

Clearly, they were causing such a ruckus on purpose. They came in their true forms to shake others.

“The Kunpeng aura. This is a true Kunpeng.” Long Chen was ignoring those demonic beasts and was completely focused on the giant pair of wings. His heart was pounding hard.

“Correct. This is a true Kunpeng, one who transformed from the Kun to the Peng through cultivation. It has countless divine abilities and the power of laws. Moreover, it has gained a trace of primal chaos blood, so its power is definitely terrifying.” Xia Guhong eyed those wings with a hint of solemnity.

From the mortal world to the immortal world, Long Chen had encountered quite a few experts of the Peng race. On the Martial Heaven Continent, he had slain the Peng Emperor’s son. And in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, he had slain Kun Wu from the Kunpeng race.

However, Long Chen had never seen a true Kunpeng. The so-called true Kunpeng was the Kun that cultivated into the Peng, a mighty expert who had achieved the Dao.

On the other hand, all the experts of the Peng race that Long Chen had encountered were those that relied on the inherited bloodline of their ancestors. That was how they had their achievements.

However, this Kunpeng was different. When it was born, it was just the most ordinary Kun. Although its body was large and it was fierce, allowing it to be called the overlord of the water, in the end, its flesh was perceived as undying meat by countless beasts. It was said that a bite of the Kun’s flesh was equivalent to a thousand years of cultivation and could increase their longevity.

Thus, before a Kun became a Peng, it was eyed by countless wild beasts as prey. On the other hand, the Kun also needed to rely on devouring those beasts to improve itself.

It could be said that the process for the Kun to become a Peng was a bloody slaughter. Wild beasts wanted to eat the Kun, and the Kun wanted to devour the wild beasts as well. Through slaughter and devouring, over ninety-nine percent of the Kuns ended up killed.

Even if a Kun did manage to survive that bloody slaughter, when it finally became a Peng, it had to undergo the Peng tribulation.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This tribulation was similar to the dragon race’s dragonization tribulation, a tribulation for members of the dragon race that reached maturity. As for the Peng tribulation, it was a death tribulation preventing the fish from leaping over the nine heavens.

The Kun was nothing more than a fish that had to live in water. Hence, they could not leave the water until they died. That was the edict of the Heavenly Daos.

For the Kun to become a Peng was a process of defying the heavens, defying fate. As the Heavenly Daos did not permit such a thing, they would unleash a terrifying heavenly punishment to prevent this heaven-defying conduct.

For the Kun to grow to its peak, there was a ninety-nine percent chance of death. Then once it reached the limit and underwent the Peng tribulation, there was another ninety-nine percent chance that it would die to the heavenly tribulation.

Thus, a true Kunpeng might not appear once in millions of years, and the majority of the Kunpeng race was descendants of the true Kunpengs. Even though a Kunpeng was born through succeeding in defying the heavens, even though they could soar above the nine heavens, they were limited by the Heavenly Daos. With every generation, a bit of their bloodline would be lost. The more time that passed, the thinner their bloodline would be. As a result, more and more of their inherited divine abilities would be lost. To put it frankly, every generation would be worse than the last.

Just like other races, there were occasional cases of regressing to an ancestral bloodline. However, the strongest existences of the Kunpeng races were never born that way. They had to go from the weakest existence and grow up step by step. They became experts by experiencing a thousand tribulations without dying.

Because of that, a true Kunpeng was exceedingly rare. Even for an expert like Xia Guhong, this was his first time seeing a true Kunpeng.

The reason Long Chen could instantly recognize it as a true Kunpeng was because as soon as its aura appeared, Long Chen could sense its will.

The Kunpeng’s will was just like the will of the true dragon. It refused to submit to the restrictions of the Heavenly Daos. It fought against the Heavenly Daos, seeking freedom, so it contained a domineeringness and arrogance that would kill anything in its way, whether it was a man or a god.

When the countless figures in the spatial channel fell, those huge wings suddenly swept out.

As a result, that giant spatial channel was cut apart by those blade-like wings. Heaven and earth were split in two.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded and an even larger channel appeared. People then saw an unimaginably big figure fly out of this channel.

It was so big that it was like an entire cosmos, so big that people could not even see its full figure.

It appeared for just a moment before divine light exploded, and it transformed into a muscular, middle-aged man with golden wings on his back.

Behind this middle-aged man stood a young man, and he also had a pair of golden wings on his back. A rune flickered in his eyes, shining with a primordial desolate qi.

When people saw that young man behind the middle-aged man, countless heavenly geniuses were shaken. This young man was also a Kunpeng, no… a true Kunpeng.

“A tough opponent has appeared.” Xia Guhong eyed that young man.

Long Chen nodded. “This person is very powerful. The reputation of the Kunpeng race is not for naught. Not relying on your ancestor’s bloodline but instead putting in great efforts to go from a weakling to a true expert… It is impressive.”

Long Chen felt immense pressure from this young man. This was definitely the greatest pressure he had sensed from anyone in the same realm ever since he set foot in the immortal world.

Just as Long Chen was staring at him, those two Kunpeng experts who were looking around ultimately had their gazes land on Long Chen in the distant restaurant.

“Hahaha, excellent! Who would have thought that you would encounter the heir of the true dragon’s will? Kun Tu, it was a good idea to come here.” The Divine Venerate looked at Long Chen and smiled with satisfaction.

As for the young man called Kun Tu, he said, “He has the true dragon’s will, but his essence blood is impure. It isn’t the ancestral dragon’s blood, so its power is limited. However, don’t expect me to have mercy just because you’re weak. The dragon race is our mortal enemies. I will definitely kill you.”

Long Chen’s expression twitched. This Kun Tu’s vision was extremely sharp. He instantly saw that Long Chen’s essence blood was not pure dragon blood. As for the ancestral dragon that he mentioned, was he referring to that mysterious dragon expert?

When Long Chen obtained his current true dragon essence blood, that mysterious dragon expert did say that it was the essence blood of his descendant. Kun Tu actually recognized it.

Furthermore, Long Chen had even split a portion of this dragon essence blood to Xia Chen and Guo Ran, causing its purity to drop even further.

At the same time as he was shocked, Long Chen was also angered. He was a top expert and had his own confidence. For this Kun Tu to arrogantly name him as a target, he was angered. He didn’t know if it was due to the dragon blood in his body or the will of the Pill Sovereign being provoked, but he couldn’t help standing.

“Don’t get impetuous. Once you enter the three thousand worlds and obtain my reverse scale, crush him for me.”

Suddenly, a voice that Long Chen hadn’t heard in a long time rang out in his mind. Long Chen almost jumped.
