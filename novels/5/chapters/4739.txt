Chapter 4728 News of the Violet Blood Race

Long Chen was baffled. It was a good thing he had come here.

All these people were holding a meeting over taking his head, but they were unaware that their target was already in their midst. That was rather satirical.

I definitely have to listen well! Long Chen put his feet down and sat up straight.

Anyway, while keeping his feet up looked very arrogant, the position wasn’t that comfortable. But now that he had put it down, others thought that he was finally taking things seriously.

Nothing could escape the gaze of the divine emissary. Seeing Long Chen sitting up properly, he was pleased. He didn’t seem to be in a rush to put Long Chen in his place anymore.

Long Chen raised his hand and asked, “May I ask why Long Chen can’t be captured alive? The two girls aren’t particularly strong, and anything can happen on the chaotic battlefield. Even we, as skilled combatants, cannot guarantee that mistakes won't occur. Long Chen, on the other hand, is more resilient and is less likely to be killed so easily.”

Several disciples nodded in agreement, indicating that they shared Long Chen’s curiosity. However, they had grown accustomed to obeying orders rather than questioning them.

“Good question. You were actually listening,” the divine emissary remarked, offering a little praise before delving into his explanation. “Killing Long Chen is to establish our prestige. That bastard is too arrogant, and the Heavenly Province cannot tolerate such a thing. Those two girls must be kept alive because they are extremely important. As for why they are important, I have to start from the beginning. All of you, listen well. What I’m about to say relates to your future, so don’t miss a single word.”

With a solemn expression, the divine emissary continued, “The Sovereign Emperor Heaven is the last and highest plane of the nine heavens. However, during the great battle of the primal chaos era, the Sovereign Emperor Heaven suffered extensive damage, transforming into a desolate wilderness...”

Long Chen was seriously listening to the divine emissary’s story about the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, as he needed to know the situation inside the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

From the divine emissary’s story, Long Chen learned that despite being the highest plane of the nine heavens, it bore massive scars. The landscape was marred by countless spatial tears, rendering vast stretches of land into untamed wilderness. Even Sage Kings couldn’t approach those spatial tears.

Legend had it that those tears were wounds left behind from the battle of the primal chaos era. Though the gods and demons of that time had long vanished, their residual will endured. Even Sage Kings would be injured by their wills if they got close. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Thus, over ninety percent of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven remained either wild and untamed or infested by terrifying devil creatures. Many areas were deemed impassable by both humans and demons alike, shrouded in mystery and danger.

These devil creatures were remnants of the great desolate species left behind from the ancient battle, and some said that they were species from beyond the heavens, not from the nine heavens and ten lands. Moreover, they had many branches and breeds, each one as deadly as the next. Inside the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, the various factions found themselves locked in a perpetual struggle against these murderous creatures.

Whether it was day or night, their attacks never stopped. As a result, the various races of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven were stuck between fighting those devil creatures and trying to establish their own foundation, struggling to survive.

No one knew where these devil creatures were coming from, but all the large races and factions could only grit their teeth and endure their relentless assault.

All these factions could only try to reduce their casualties and grow as quickly as possible. Thus, many factions were not doing very well. With the devil creatures everywhere, they did not have much room to move around, which resulted in limited resources in their small territories.

Having limited resources while enduring endless attacks was incredibly dangerous. Once the resources were gone, it signified that a race or faction was going to be exterminated.

Only some strong races and factions could rely on their natural advantages to occupy a large, stable territory in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, capable of competing for more resources.

As for the Lifehunter race, they were the ones with the most relaxing lives in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Due to their powerful concealing abilities, most of the devil creatures wouldn’t even notice them.

Thus, they could build their headquarters in the midst of devil creatures’ territory—the safest place in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven to recover. Through millions and millions of years of recuperation, their power gradually returned to its peak.

It was due to this that the Heavenly Province now thought of taking revenge. However, the Sovereign Emperor Heaven was enormous, so even with their power, their area of movement was also limited.

When they went too far, they would encounter devil creatures capable of detecting them, and they would also be in danger.

Once, a group of roving devil creatures noticed one of the Heavenly Province’s strongholds and eradicated it, leaving not even a single survivor.

Overall, the area of operation of the major factions within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven encompassed around ten percent of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. While the Heavenly Province could spread out a bit further, even they could barely cover twenty percent of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

Within this area, they couldn’t find any traces of the violet blood race. However, in recent years, they started to notice signs of the violet blood race’s movements. This discovery both excited and unsettled the Heavenly Province, so they immediately gave the order to stop their movements within this region to avoid being noticed by the violet blood race.

As mortal enemies, the Lifehunter race knew that this specific region was near the territory of the violet blood race, but they didn’t dare to get too close because they didn’t know their enemies’ numbers or situation yet. Any rash movements risked alerting the other side and allowing some fish to escape the net, as what the Lifehunter race wanted was the complete annihilation of the violet blood race.

Hearing that, Long Chen sneered inside. They put it so nicely, but they were just afraid of repeating history.

Hearing the news of the violet blood race made Long Chen a bit excited. He believed that his grandfather should be there. However, as thoughts of his mother flooded his mind, a bitter feeling crept in. If his own child were to have their Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone taken a few days after being born, and then vanished without a trace, he knew he would go crazy.

Hence, he could only imagine the torment his mother had endured during that agonizing period—suffering beyond words, comprehensible only to those who had endured it themselves.

Thinking of that, Long Chen had the urge to charge into the Sovereign Emperor Heaven right now. However, Qian Feng’s startled cry drew him out of his reverie, causing him to realize that he was standing and clenching his fists.

“What are you doing?!” shouted the divine emissary from the top of the platform.
