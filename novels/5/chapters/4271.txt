Chapter 4260: Heaven-Shaking Chaotic Battle

Long Aotian’s attack killed so many people, regardless of their status or race. It even claimed the lives of numerous members of the Undying race.

Although the Undying race’s powerful life force allowed them to revive even upon being obliterated, Long Aotian’s attack seemed to have absorbed all of their life force before killing them.

“Long Aotian, you attacked too early! Didn’t we say that you’d only switch sides at the very end!?”

In the distance, Mo Nian shouted at Long Aotian with exasperation, causing everyone to look at Long Aotian with new wariness and anger.

Long Aotian was enraged. He had fallen for Long Chen’s trick, killing many of Long Chen’s enemies in one blow. Now, Mo Nian even slandered him, and he didn’t know how to respond.

“DIE!”

Long Aotian didn’t bother explaining and furiously slashed the Seven Peak Sword at Long Chen. He would use his actions to prove himself.

BOOM!

Long Chen brandished his fist to receive this blow. With an explosive sound, the sword was knocked aside, but the scales on his fist shattered and golden blood oozed out.

The Seven Peak Sword was clearly different from the violet-gold bell. Long Chen would naturally be at an immense disadvantage if he caught it barehanded.

However, after this attack, Long Chen grew even more confident. He was now unafraid of Eternal divine weapons. At the very least, Eternal divine weapons in the hands of Immortal Kings were unable to cause him fatal injuries.

As Long Aotian let out a resounding roar, waves of sword-images came flying out of the Seven Peak Sword. Long Aotian then crazily attacked, tearing through the void with every slash.

In contrast, golden light blazed from Long Chen’s body, and his dragon cry kept resounding throughout the heavens. He fought against the Seven Peak Sword with his fists.

The astral winds and Sword Qi from their exchanges actually penetrated the martial stage’s barrier. The entire Sage King Prefecture was quivering because of their battle.

Seeing this scene, everyone was shocked. They were finally experiencing a genuine battle between unrivaled heavenly geniuses. Long Chen and Long Aotian’s exchanges started a chaotic battle on the martial stage.

BOOM!

Lian Wuying’s lily leaves covered the sky as they fell on the Dragonblood Legion, only to be blocked by an enormous willow tree.

The willow’s branches were like sharp swords piercing back toward Lian Wuying. As both Lian Wuying and Liu Ruyan had summoned their true bodies, the martial stage didn’t seem to be able to fit both of them at once. It instantly became packed.

Space quivered. The next moment, a sword silently pierced toward the unconscious Yue Zifeng. Mu Qingyun was holding him, but by the time she noticed this sword, that sword was almost at his head.

Just as it seemed like he would be pierced through, a dagger blocked that sword. Seeing this, Mu Qingyun was pale with terror and hastily retreated with Yue Zifeng.

Mu Qingyun was shocked and flustered. She was also a sword cultivator, but she hadn’t even sensed an assassin getting close.

Two figures then appeared from the void. The sword-wielding sneak attacker was the Shadow race’s princess. As for the one to block her, it was the delicate Dong Mingyu.

“Why aren’t you using that black dagger?”

The Shadow princess was like a phantom. She had managed to silently appear in the Dragonblood Legion’s camp.

“In a clash between assassins, there’s no need to rely on a weapon advantage. I don’t need it to kill you,” responded Dong Mingyu coldly.

After saying that, she turned to the horrified Mu Qingyun. “Don’t worry about it. She is the Shadow race’s princess, and her bloodline is special. Only she is capable of sneaking over here. Concentrate yourself. Maintain the absolute calmness of a sword cultivator. After all, the heart reflects the sword. Don’t let other things disturb you.”

After saying that, without anyone seeing how she moved, the Shadow princess suddenly raised her sword to block. Only when some sparks flew did Dong Mingyu’s figure slowly fade away.

One was the Shadow race’s princess, and the other was the Shadow Sect’s top assassin. After one clash, both of their figures vanished.

Sparks flew throughout the void as they would appear in different spots each time. However, no one was able to see their actual figures. In fact, they didn’t even see their weapons and only saw sparks when their weapons clashed.

“Kill!”

A large battle erupted. Gu Yang wielded his spear against Ye Wuchen, and Guo Ran summoned his battle armor, his sabers dancing as he fought Zhao Xingtian. As for Xia Chen, he was throwing talismans that blocked the Ghost Dao lifeform.

Mo Nian was finally fighting seriously, his mischievous smile gone. Behind him, his manifestation of an ancient divine bow and ancient pine swayed. He was going all-out.

His opponent was Yan Wuji who was wielding a halberd. At some point, a golden crown had appeared on his head, and the Human Emperor manifestation behind him supported him with its emperor might. Each of his blows caused heaven and earth to quiver.

Mo Nian and Yan Wuji’s battle shocked countless people, especially the factions that had arrest warrants out for Mo Nian. Their jaws dropped.

They hadn’t expected the wretched fellow whom they had pursued for so long, the shameless fellow who had no ability other than fleeing, would possess such immense power. He was fighting on par with the Human Emperor’s descendant.

After seeing that, they felt a burst of fear. If Mo Nian hadn’t chosen to flee and instead fought against them, their families would probably have been destroyed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

However, what they were unable to understand was that if Mo Nian was so powerful, why did he always like to do something as shameful as robbing graves?

At this moment, a bird cry rang out, shaking the heavens. Cloud had summoned the body of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow and spread her wings. Rainbow light was flowing on top of her feathers as her sharp claws raked the heavens. She was fighting a bloody battle with a Kunpeng.

.

This Kunpeng was the strongest heavenly genius of the Kunpeng race. These two immemorial divine birds were locked in an exceptionally intense battle, their skirmish causing blood and feathers to scatter in all directions.

Tang Wan-er had wind blades all around her. Like a storm goddess, she blocked the entire Heavenly Tiger race all on her own.

The Heavenly Tiger race’s greatest heavenly genius was completely suppressed by Tang Wan-er. Without the aid of the rest of his race, he wouldn’t have been able to survive her assault.

Tang Wan-er was fierce and immediately launched her killing blows. This girl was venting all of the rage in her heart, and the only place for her to vent was on the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts.

In contrast, Ye Zhiqiu wielded a sword of ice and was fighting the Black Tortoise race’s expert. That expert’s defense was astonishing. His shell in particular was so strong that he didn’t even fear Eternal divine weapons. However, Ye Zhiqiu’s ice energy did frighten him, and he was never able to escape her blockade.

Next to their battlefield, a Heavenly Lightning Violet Salamander summoned a sea of lightning, but it was blocked by a sea of rainbow flames. Yu Qingxuan had summoned the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

As the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was ranked ninth on the Heavenly Flame Rankings, it was an existence that most people had only ever heard of but never seen. Its rainbow flames possessed the astonishing capability of incinerating heavenly lightning, leaving onlookers bewildered.

Engaged in combat against a group of devil race experts, Meng Qi's Spiritual Strength surged, and her hand seals moved with the swiftness of lightning. Billions of swords encircled her opponents, their patterns and forms in constant flux. Within the confines of her formidable attack, no one could advance even a single step.

“Is Long Chen’s side planning on fighting the entire world on their own?”

Seeing this sight, the human experts outside of the martial stage were stunned. Long Chen’s side had actually managed to face everyone’s attacks.
