Chapter 4860 Domineering Xing Wujiang

The flame arrow whistled toward Mo Nian with immense divine might. Seeing this, Mo Nian snorted and raised his hand, but just as he wanted to show off, Long Chen got in the way.

Long Chen’s palm slammed into the flame arrow and crushed these unremarkable flames, causing countless runes to dance through the air like fireworks. While it was a beautiful sight, the surrounding experts screamed and ran away.

When the flame runes landed on the spectator stands, the latter instantly melted, becoming a sea of fire. Many experts who didn’t run fast enough were set ablaze, instantly turning into ash.

“Damn!” Mo Nian was shocked. This casual blow from Jiang Yiban actually possessed such terrifying might, causing him to misjudge its power. If Long Chen hadn’t pulled him back, he really would have been caught off-guard and suffered.

As the flame runes flowed through this space, the star cloud martial stage was quickly incinerated, and ashes drifted through the air.

Within these burning flames, it was vaguely possible to hear a sacred chanting sound. When the flames faded, the chanting faded with them.

“How surprising. It really is rare for someone so young to have such a deep understanding of the Nirvana Scripture,” said Jiang Yiban, looking at Long Chen with a trace of shock.

Jiang Yiban was someone who hid his true thoughts, so he didn’t show his power lightly. However, when he did decide to make a move, it would be a devastating one.

Jiang Yiban’s flame arrow looked like an ordinary magical art, but he had actually merged his understanding of the Nirvana Scripture into it. It operated under the principle of reverting something complex into something simple, its true power hidden.

Even experienced Heaven Saints would suffer against this move, let alone a young expert like Mo Nian. If someone was caught off-guard by it, they would likely be taking a trip to the yellow spring.

Luckily, when Jiang Yiban attacked, Long Chen directly sensed something off. So, he also condensed flame energy on his palm, using the essence of the Nirvana Scripture to turn it into a clash between Nirvana Scriptures.

Just like Jiang Yiban, Long Chen was also taken aback by this exchange. Jiang Yiban was truly sinister to be able to make such a terrifying magical art look so weak. If it weren’t for Long Chen’s sharp senses, the attack would have probably destroyed Mo Nian’s arm.

“In this world, there existed many things that would surprise you. Since you’re from the Brahma Pill Valley, let’s cut the crap,” replied Long Chen lightly.

The Brahma Pill Valley had been targeting Long Chen, so there was no point in chatting too much.

“We can’t beat all of them, and I also don’t want to involve the Feather Spirit race in our affairs. Do you have any ideas?” transmitted Long Chen to Mo Nian.

“I do, but we can’t do it here. Otherwise, all of Devil Fall City will be destroyed. Ugh, in the worst-case scenario, we can just run!” replied Mo Nian with a helpless tone.

“Do you have a way to escape?” asked Long Chen.

“What do you think? You can doubt my combat power, but don’t doubt my fleeing abilities.”

“Alright, then let’s retreat.”

“Should we test their power? We can join forces and get rid of one or two Heaven Saints before we go. Hehe, just think about it, when news spreads that the two of us were attacked by over ten Heaven Saints but still managed to escape, even killing a few of them, it would definitely be flashy,” chortled Mo Nian. He was in no rush to run.

“No, if we do start fighting, Race Leader Yu Luo will not just stand by. Once we run, what will the Feather Spirit race do?” retorted Long Chen.

“Ah... fine, you’re right. Hmph, they’re lucky this time. I’ll put them in their place next time,” Mo Nian sighed helplessly. He stealthily started groping around his chest.

Just then, Xing Wujiang stepped forward and casually said, “No need for any meaningless words. All of you can scram from Devil Fall City. I have a meal to treat.”

Xing Wujiang’s words shocked everyone. Was he really on Long Chen’s side? Furthermore, he wasn’t courteous to Jiang Yiban and the others at all.

“Xing Wujiang, do you not understand the situation? You won’t be a city lord much longer. Are you not afraid?” Jiang Yiban’s face instantly turned cold.

“I can say the same thing to you. I, Xing Wujiang, have no sons or daughters. There is nothing holding me back from doing whatever I want. If my position can be lost at any moment, why not do something crazy? Perhaps taking advantage of the fact that I still control the Square Heaven Seal to bring down sixteen Heaven Saints with me? Should I do that?” Xing Wujiang’s lips curled into a sneer.

When Xing Wujian said this, Jiang Yiban’s expression darkened. He observed Xing Wujiang, trying to see if the latter was just trying to scare him. After a moment, he said, “Hopefully, you won’t regret your decision today.”

After that, Jiang Yiban and his Heaven Saints vanished into thin air as if they had never been there in the first place.

“Tch, nothing more than a bunch of dogs that listen to other people’s orders. How dare they threaten me?” sneered Xing Wujiang. He then turned to Long Chen and said, “Come. Let’s eat together!”

“Can I come?” asked Mo Nian. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Of course.”

Xing Wujiang looked at Yu Luo. “I won’t invite Race Leader Yu Luo this time. After all, the food we eat doesn’t suit the Feather Spirit race’s diet. You aren’t worried about me mistreating Long Chen, right?”

Yu Luo hesitated as she wasn’t completely at ease. Although the Feather Spirit race had been in Devil Fall City for countless years, they didn’t have much of a relationship with Xing Wujiang. As a result, she didn’t trust him that much.

“Race Leader Yu Luo, don’t worry. I trust the city lord,” said Long Chen.

Although Xing Wujiang was wearing a cloak and Long Chen couldn’t see his face, Long Chen didn’t sense any hostility from him.

Furthermore, Xing Wujiang had offended Jiang Yiban for Long Chen, suggesting he harbored no ill intentions toward him. Long Chen was also intrigued by the city lord for another reason—he sensed a faintly familiar aura about him.

Unable to tell what this aura was, Long Chen wanted to get to know this mysterious city lord.

Seeing that Long Chen trusted Xing Wujiang, Yu Luo didn’t try to change his mind. She simply grabbed his hand and implored him not to leave the city if it wasn’t for something important. She would have people waiting by the city lord’s mansion for him.

The next moment, Long Chen’s palm warmed as a rune appeared on it. Race Leader Yu Luo was clearly still worried, so she left him a rune. If Long Chen was in danger, he could immediately inform her through this rune.

Long Chen was moved as this was his first time having someone treat him so well in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. He obediently nodded.

Under Race Leader Yu Luo’s watchful gaze, Long Chen and Mo Nian left with Xing Wujiang.
