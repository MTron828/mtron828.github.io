Chapter 3431 Black Swords Reappear

Long Chen wasn’t wrong. The demonic beast race’s experts were going all-out against the ancient corpses and losing their lives. On the surface, it really was like they were throwing their lives away just to protect him.

The eighth prince narrowed his eyes and coldly said, “You want to anger us? You’re too naive. This heavenly tribulation is the good fortune of the heavens. It is your heavenly tribulation, but you haven’t obtained a single benefit from it. Are you not worried?”

The eighth prince was absorbing countless lightning runes from the air. He could clearly feel their monstrous tempering power, so he was confident in his deduction.

As long as they prevented Long Chen from absorbing these runes, then when the heavenly tribulation was over, they could kill him and take all the benefits. All of Long Chen’s efforts would be for them.

“Naive?” Long Chen laughed.

Just then, an ancient corpse passed through their encirclement and stabbed a sword right at Long Chen’s back.

Without looking back, Long Chen swung his hand, slapping that ancient corpse in the face.

BOOM!Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The ancient corpse smashed into the ground, causing an explosion that left a giant hole in the earth.

When that hole appeared, the hall master and assistant hall masters of the Sacred Pill Hall twitched.

“It’s just a coincidence. Don’t worry,” transmitted the hall master. But the uneasy feeling he felt intensified.

There was a fist-sized bone fragment within that large hole. It was covered in dirt. Without looking closely, it wasn’t even noticeable.

The reason that the hall master twitched was because that bone fragment was one of the formation runes binding the core of the star-field.

This bone fragment was buried in the earth and protected by a formation. Let alone Long Chen, not even a World King could extract it.

However, the random ancient corpse that Long Chen killed actually exposed it. These three were unable to figure out what had just happened.

The worst-case scenario that worried them the most was that if those bone fragments were broken, then the power of the core of the star-field would erupt. At that time, let alone the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, even the entire Auspicious Cloud Prefecture would be destroyed without a trace. Everyone here would die.

They could only hope that it was a coincidence. But they were now worried that someone would accidentally destroy that bone fragment. If that was the case, they would really be doomed. Without realizing it, sweat dripped down the hall master’s forehead.

Inside the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, Long Chen acted like nothing had happened at all. He didn’t even glance at that bone fragment and indifferently looked at the eighth prince. “It seems that you still haven’t noticed just what kind of person you have provoked. I don’t want to waste more time.”

After that, Long Chen flicked a finger, and a flash of fire soared into the heavens. It was a thumb-sized flame lotus.

BOOM!

The flame lotus exploded within the tribulation clouds. Following that, the tribulation clouds roiled, and terrifying heavenly might crashed down.

Long Chen’s flame lotus had infuriated the heavenly tribulation. It was like he had slapped a slumbering beast, waking it up in a fury.

After that, the endless tribulation clouds began to condense. As the clouds shrank, the auras of those ancient corpses grew from the early Immortal King realm to the late Immortal King realm.

Their power soared, and their attacks grew even sharper. Moreover, they seemed to have gained intelligence. Previously, they were only attacking instinctively. But now, they were attacking and defending as if they were alive.

As they became incomparably experienced warriors, the defensive line of the demonic beasts, which had been barely holding on, instantly shattered. Countless people died to those ancient corpses.

“Eighth prince, princess Wu Ying, Golden Horned Master, please save us!”

Some people begged for aid, only to be slain before they finished begging. There were now no more than ten million demonic beasts left, but ancient corpses were still descending from the four gates.

Long Chen smiled. That was right. The ancient corpses he had encountered on the Ghost Ship possessed this kind of aura. They had now been manifested inside his heavenly tribulation, displaying terrifying killing power.

The eighth prince’s expression finally changed. There were too many ancient corpses. If this continued, then while the sixteen of them would be fine, the elites of the various races would be exterminated.

They couldn’t allow such a thing. If these elites were lost, it would be a huge loss to their races.

“Fine, let’s not waste any time. I’ll kill you right now!” shouted the eighth prince, and his golden spear once more appeared in his hand.

Upon seeing this, Long Chen’s calm indifference vanished and killing intent surged out of him. It was this spear that had killed the nine star heir.

“Go help our people. His life is mine!” shouted the eighth prince at Wu Ying and the others.

“Don’t trouble yourselves.”

Just as Wu Ying and the others were about to go, Long Chen’s voice rang out, sending a chill down their spines. When they looked back at him, they saw a vein throbbing on his forehead, and his hair was flying wildly. The killing intent in his eyes was chilling, like a devil king had descended.

Long Chen’s voice instantly became hoarse, and it resounded throughout heaven and earth like it came from the depths of hell. It made people shiver.

“Divine ring! Battle armor!”

The next moment, the void shattered and the dome of the heavens quivered. When Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, countless stars could be seen flowing inside of it, and a pillar of light soared to the heavens. Even the tribulation clouds quivered uneasily.

The four gates suddenly became covered in cracks.

BOOM!

Seemingly suffering under the pressure of some terrifying power, the four gates finally reached their limit and exploded. In that instant, the ancient corpses that were slaughtering the demonic beasts also exploded, transforming into lightning runes.

The demonic beasts were delighted. Just as they were prepared to absorb the lightning runes, before they could enjoy this harvest, black swords came raining down from the heavens.

The physical bodies that these demonic beasts were so proud of were as weak as tofu in front of these black swords.

“No!”

“Save me!”

The black lightning swords contained endless destructive power, and they mercilessly harvested their lives. The shouts for aid were useless, as even the eighth prince, Wu Ying, and the others were shocked and powerless to look after the others.

In just an instant, only a few hundred people remained out of ten million experts. Seeing this scene, the senior experts in the plaza roared in fury. The slain experts were the future pillars of their races. Hence, these seniors were filled with hatred and wanted to charge into the Divine Lord Immortal Realm right this instant to slay Long Chen.

“Kill him together!”

The eighth prince was shocked. That shock quickly transformed into rage, and he shot toward Long Chen.
