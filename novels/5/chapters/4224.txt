Chapter 4213 Xu Yifeng’s Other Power

Long Chen’s speed was too fast, leaving behind countless afterimages. It seemed as though he barely moved, but he had already arrived in front of Xu Yifeng.

Xu Yifeng was taken aback. Moments ago, he had narrowly escaped death, and now Long Chen was already closing in once more. Not daring to face Long Chen head-on again, he used his violet qi to retreat.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist blew apart space, creating a visible void that expanded and retracted into his hand. His fist swiftly turned and struck again.

A deafening rumble echoed as Long Chen's fist cleaved through space. In its wake, a wide gulf appeared in the void.

“What?!” Following that, the Xu family’s experts jumped. The reason this attack missed was not because Xu Yifeng had managed to retreat so amazingly.

Instead, Long Chen seemed to have expected him to run, so he let his power erupt in the void, only to use some mysterious power to seal it later.

The force of the initial strike didn't dissipate; instead, it merged seamlessly with the second attack. Long Chen effectively combined the power of both attacks.

This kind of layering technique could not be considered rare as many people knew similar techniques. However, this kind of technique was a double-sided sword. If it was interrupted, you would receive a backlash from the power that you were storing. In other words, one mistake and you would lose your life.

Considering just how powerful Xu Yifeng was, who would dare to use such a technique against him? Furthermore, when Long Chen first attacked, everyone saw that he hadn’t intended to use this kind of layering attack.

It was only when Xu Yifeng retreated that Long Chen released his power into the void and then retracted it.

It was entirely done on the spot. This seemingly simple move showed that Long Chen’s control over his power had reached the pinnacle, shaking many of the experts here.

This battle reaction was definitely tempered through blood and fire. It was not something that could be taught.

“Hurry and interrupt him!” shouted an expert of the Xu family from the outside. However, in his panic, he forgot that the barrier blocked all sound.

However, even without this warning, Xu Yifeng also had a bad feeling. With this retreat of his, Long Chen had actually managed to push him into a passive position.

Long Chen’s fist once more smashed toward him, giving him no time to breathe. This time, if he were to retreat, Long Chen might layer his power once more. The power of three punches in one? That kind of fist wasn’t something that Xu Yifeng dared to receive.

Xu Yifeng roared. An expression of struggle appeared on his face. The next moment, violet runes began to surge over his arms, causing his sleeves to burst apart, exposing arms that appeared to be crafted from violet iron. This was a unique divine ability of the Violet Blood race.

BOOM!

As Long Chen’s fist smashed into Xu Yifeng’s arms, a metallic sound rang out and some sparks of fire flew.

Bracing against the impact, Xu Yifeng's body trembled, and his feet gouged a lengthy trench into the martial stage as he was propelled backward. He was forced back ten miles before stopping.

When people looked at Xu Yifeng, they were shocked to see that his metallic arms were now covered in cracks.

On the other hand, they could see stars revolving around Long Chen’s fist. The starry light contained endless divine might.

The Starry River Sect’s disciples cheered when they saw that fist, wearing worshipful expressions.

It was clearly the highest technique of the Starry River Sect. Furthermore, Long Chen had selflessly shared this technique with them. Regretfully, their aptitude was limited, and so far none of them had managed to master this technique. However, seeing Long Chen use it, it felt like they were seeing their own future. That apocalyptic astral energy made them feel endlessly excited.

In truth, many people didn’t know of Long Chen’s connection with the Starry River Sect. However, seeing the reaction of the Starry River Sect’s experts, they realized the origin of this technique.

Long Chen and Xu Yifeng continued to stare at each other, frozen in their positions. One was still in his punching posture, and the other was still in his blocking posture. For a moment, everyone was silent.

The Xu family’s disciples were stunned. They had never dreamed that Long Chen could be so powerful.

Suddenly, Xu Yifeng finally couldn’t endure it anymore, and blood sprayed out of his mouth.

Xu Yifeng was injured? They hadn’t expected victory to be decided so quickly.

“Hahaha!”

To their surprise, Xu Yifeng laughed rather sinisterly, and his violet eyes changed, having a trace of black to them now.

“Hahahahaha!”

His laughter continued, becoming increasingly loud, accompanied by a growing sinister aura that seemed to consume him. His aura also transformed as though there was something possessing him.

“Has this fellow gone insane after being beaten by boss?” asked Guo Ran curiously.

Meng Qi shook her head. “No, there is another kind of energy within this fellow. Although it’s not powerful, it is a flame seed. I think Long Chen deduced that these people were traitors of the Violet Blood race based on this flame seed.”

Just then, the void rumbled and the violet blood manifestation behind Xu Yifeng began to shake. It was like some monster was about to break free from the manifestation.

“Long Chen, you really surprised me. That attack of yours let me sense your true power. Fine, I also have no need to raise my power bit by bit anymore. In any case, the title of Sage King will be mine. Today, I will tell all the ten thousand races that no one can stop the rise of the Violet Blood race!” Xu Yifeng raised his head and roared, his hair flying chaotically around him.

As the violet qi behind him began to boil, his power climbed crazily.

Long Chen looked at the crazed Xu Yifeng and shook his head. "When it comes to individuals who are at least your equal, there may not be a hundred, but there are certainly around eighty. And amongst those eighty, the ones who can kill you outnumber those you can count on your fingers. I really don’t know where this confidence of yours comes from.”

“Shut up!” The crazed Xu Yifeng stopped boasting and directly shot at Long Chen.

Upon looking at his eyes now, startled cries rang out from the crowd. Xu Yifeng’s violet eyes were now marred by many black spots. His appearance was frightening.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Furthermore, his face had also changed. His originally handsome features were now twisted with malevolence.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the martial stage beneath Xu Yifeng’s feet exploded, and the Xu family head, who had been quietly watching this entire time, smiled.

“It’s over.”
