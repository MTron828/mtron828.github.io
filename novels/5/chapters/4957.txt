“What marker?! Why don’t you try being even more shameless?!” shouted Yu Ying, shaking with rage.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I said that there’s a marker, so there’s one. Many people here can bear witness to it for me,” said Huanghui. He looked around and asked, “Did you see it?”

“I saw it!”

An especially loud shout rang out from the monkey-faced man.

“You…!”

Seeing how shameless and greedy these people were, Yu Ying and the others felt like they might explode.

“Bastard! We can’t be bullied like this! Captain, let’s fight! If each of us drags one down, we’re going even. If we kill two, then we’re profiting!” exclaimed the mercenary with the warhammer.

“You want to fight? Hahaha, trash that relies on inferior medicinal pills to grow wants to fight me?” Huanghui laughed derisively. After that, his smile suddenly vanished, and he coldly said, “Cut the crap. You just stole my prey. If you don’t hand it over, I’ll slaughter every last one of you.”

“Fight!”

All the mercenaries seethed with anger. This was something that they had risked their lives to obtain; handing it over for nothing would be worse than dying. They all looked at Fang Liude. As long as he gave the order, they would fight to the death here. Even if they died, they’d drag a few of these bastards down.

Facing their anger, Huanghui simply sneered. The other disciples of the Long clan also looked at them disdainfully, as if they were looking down on ants.

As for the monkey-faced man, he was extremely pleased with himself. He might not be able to obtain anything, but at least Fang Liude and the others wouldn’t either. Seeing their rage brought him great satisfaction.

“The Long clan’s disciples have countless opportunities to gain resources. Do you really have to fight over scraps with people like us, who are so poor we only have our lives?” Fang Liude clenched his teeth with grief and indignation.

“Saint Emperor Zhantian has already decreed not to squeeze us out of our pitiful space. Are you not afraid of his wrath?!” exclaimed Fang Liude as he gestured to everyone. It was a secret signal within their group to hand over what they had obtained. Seeing this, all of them shook with rage. Yu Ying couldn’t hold back some tears of indignation.

However, they knew as well that fighting these bastards would only lead to their demise. Not one of them would survive. Furthermore, this was their captain’s order, and none of them could disobey, despite their overwhelming anger and resentment.

“Saint Emperor Zhantian? Tch, what dogshit Saint Emperor. That’s nothing more than a title you ants gave him. As soon as he became one of the four Heavenly Saints, he directly ran off. Who knows if he’ll return alive?” sneered Huanghui.

Just as they were about to hand over their treasures, Huanghui’s words caused their expressions to change. Killing intent exploded out of them.

Fang Liude threatened, “You can take our things and trample our dignity, but you can’t insult Saint Emperor Zhantian!”

“Tch, and if I do? So what?” sneered Huanghui.

“Then we won’t stop until you’re dead!” Fang Liude roared and charged at Huanghui, smashing both his hatchets at him.

Caught off-guard by the sudden attack, Huanghui reacted too late. Fang Liude was already upon him by the time he raised his arms in a hasty defense.

BOOM!

Fang Liude’s hatchets smashed onto Huanghui’s arms, and qi waves exploded, sending Fang Liude flying.

With his sleeves torn open, everyone saw golden arm protectors on Huanghui’s arms. It was no wonder he dared to block the attack barehanded.

Though Huanghui’s power far surpassed Fang Liude’s and his fundamentals were superior, he hadn’t anticipated Fang Liude’s attack and was knocked back a few steps, nearly spitting out blood. Furious, he roared, “You damn ants! Kill them all!”

Even before he finished speaking, the small mercenary group flew into action, launching attacks from every direction. Cold arrows and talismans in particular shot at Huanghui, targeting his vulnerable spot.

In response, Huanghui roared, and the full power of an eight star Doyen erupted. He summoned his Doyen armor around him and took out a shield.

This flurry of attacks left him bloody, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He suffered a lot of injuries. An arrow pierced his leg, and a talisman exploded on his cheek, leaving half his face a bloody pulp.

The cooperation of this small mercenary group was excellent. Regrettably, they were just too weak. If they were a bit stronger, perhaps they would have been able to kill him.

However, they had failed to do so, wasting their only chance. The other disciples of the Long clan and the monkey man’s mercenaries now reacted, swarming Fang Liude and the others and forcing them back.

Fang Liude knew that they wouldn’t be able to survive. Seeing Long Chen behind them, he immediately shouted, “Brother Long Chen, run away!”

“Die!”

Just as he said this, a roar came from in front of him. Huanghui swung a broadsword toward him ferociously, and Fang Liude hastily blocked with his hatchets, resulting in both of them being broken. The impact sent Fang Liude flying.

The power disparity was too great, compounded by the vast difference in weaponry. Blood sprayed from Fang Liude’s mouth as he crashed into the ground. The others rushed over to support him, but there were too many enemies. Furthermore, the Long clan’s disciples were just too powerful for them.

Seeing Huanghui’s broadsword slashing toward Fang Liude, all of them cried out. “Brother Liu!”

Just as Fang Liude awaited death, a figure appeared before him and caught the broadsword.

“Long Chen?”

When Yu Ying and the others saw this, they were all stunned.

Long Chen stood with one hand behind his back, the other clenched around the broadsword. His black hair and robes billowed in the wind, and his eyes bore into the horrified Huanghui with apathy.

To witness someone capable of withstanding Huanghui’s full-power attack barehanded was astonishing. Other than his hair moving slightly, Long Chen seemed to show no reaction at all. The broadsword's booming cry was silenced.

Fang Liude and the others’ jaws dropped in disbelief. This seemingly unassuming scholar was actually a supreme expert. Most importantly, he had yet to unleash even a fraction of his true power.

It was deathly silent as Huanghui furiously pulled his broadsword, but it didn’t budge.

“Who are you?!” asked Hunghui

Long Chen remained silent, resisting the urge to deliver his favorite retort, considering that Huanghui looked more like a dog than a human.

“Tell me, who is Saint Emperor Zhantian?”
