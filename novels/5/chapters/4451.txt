Chapter 4440 Invoking Rage

Netherdragon Tianzhao was already suspicious, thinking that Long Chen was brewing some scheme. But as soon as Long Chen said this, those suspicions vanished.

In Netherdragon Tianzhao’s idiot head, Long Chen’s calm appearance simply showed that he had reached his limit and was about to lose.

Hence, Netherdragon Tianzhao unleashed his full power, compressing his domain to the limit to crush Long Chen’s domain.

As long as Long Chen’s golden domain exploded, it would be the greatest victory for the nether dragon race. It would be extremely significant.

“How foolish. Do you think I’m afraid of you? I only feel like this kind of battle is too boring, so I kindly suggested something else. Fine, if you want to fight using domains, we can keep going. Whoever puts their domain away first has to call the other daddy!” cursed Long Chen angrily.

His flustered curses convinced others that he was on the verge of defeat and unable to last much longer. Hence, Netherdragon Tianzhao continued forming hand seals, concentrating the power of his domain even further, unaware that Long Chen was already reveling in the situation.

The dragon blood runes in Long Chen were constantly transforming. They were like tadpoles at first with no head or tail, but under Netherdragon Tianzhao’s dragon blood domain pressure, they grew, elongating and gradually taking the form of serpents.

Long Chen’s bones started to creak. Because his bones were connected to his dragon tendons, the dragon tendons’ power started to permeate into his bones, strengthening them.

In order to avoid being noticed, Long Chen worked hard to prevent his bloodline fluctuations from changing, hoping others wouldn’t notice these changes.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Time continued to pass. One incense stick, two incense sticks… soon, ten incense sticks had burned away. Netherdragon Tianzhao finally started to feel like he was running out of energy.

Pushing his dragon blood domain for so long at this intensity was a heavy burden for him. As for Long Chen’s domain, it still looked like it would explode at any moment, so Netherdragon Tianzhao finally regretted it. When Long Chen had suggested switching away from a domain battle, he should have agreed. However, the big words had been said, so there was no stopping it.

The spectators had been in high spirits at first, but they were starting to get bored. Was this really a clash between the top geniuses of two worlds?

Right off the bat, it became a staring contest, completely different from the intense clash they had been anticipating. This kind of fighting style was too dull, too boring.

If it were someone else fighting, they’d have long since left after seeing such a thing. Who would just sit around and watch such a boring fight? However, they were also anticipating the rest of the battle, so they forced themselves to wait patiently.

“I told you that you wouldn’t be able to do it, but you refused to believe it. True dragon is the master of the dragon race. How could a traitor like you possibly use your bloodline to suppress your master?” said Long Chen upon seeing Netherdragon Tianzhao want to retreat.

It was quite the malicious curse. Netherdragon Tianzhao had no choice but to keep trying to crush Long Chen’s domain. As soon as he switched to something else, it would be like admitting that he had lost to Long Chen.

After all, Long Chen was a human, with only a trace of true dragon blood. On the other hand, Netherdragon Tianzhao was the heavenly genius of the nether dragon race. How could the power he excelled in the most be unable to crush Long Chen’s minute amount of dragon blood? Even if he ultimately won this battle, it would leave a mark on that victory.

Netherdragon Tianzhao was enraged. However, he didn’t know how to escape this deadlock. Continue using his dragon blood domain? It wasn’t working. Putting it away? He couldn’t.

“How long are we supposed to watch this kind of boring domain battle? A real battle between experts isn’t a competition of domains; it’s pitting their lives against each other. Did we really come from so far just to see this nonsense?”

Suddenly, an angry roar came from the distant crowd.

“Hurry up and start fighting! What is the point of this? This is the battle between the Sage King and the world’s first Heavenly Doyen? Are you two trying to make everyone die laughing at you?”

“Stop wasting time! The nether dragon race wants to show off their power, right? Then bring out your real power!”

“That’s right, if Netherdragon Tianzhao really is strong enough and the nether dragon race is sincere, we don’t mind joining the nether dragon race!”

After one person shouted, others also joined in. They were really bored of this domain battle and were about to fall asleep.

Netherdragon Tianzhao suddenly retreated, retracting his dragon blood domain. “Fine, for you all, I don’t mind ending this domain battle. It’s a pity though; I already had the advantage and was about to crush him.”

“Will you die if you don’t brag? Even if I gave you another ten thousand years, you wouldn’t be a match for me in a domain battle,” said Long Chen lightly, also putting away his domain.

Long Chen knew when enough was enough. After all, toward the end, the power of Netherdragon Tianzhao’s domain could only barely stimulate his dragon blood runes.

Currently, the dragon blood runes in him had taken the shape of serpents, and despite the seemingly minor change, their significance was substantial. His dragon blood energy had undergone a qualitative transformation.

“Keep acting arrogant and people won’t like you. However, I’m willing to give you a chance. As long as you swear loyalty to me, I can still provide you the opportunity to change your fate,” said Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen raised his head and laughed as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world. “In this world, no one is worthy of me swearing loyalty to. Who do you think you are to dare say such a thing? Are you not afraid of slapping your own face in a bit?

“Hmph, it seems that there’s no saving you. I gave you your final chance, but you didn’t want it. Then don’t blame me for being ruthless.” Netherdragon Tianzhao’s voice gradually sank, and killing intent suddenly erupted out of him.

The land behind Netherdragon Tianzhao darkened abruptly, yet this time, it wasn't due to a domain. Within the boundless darkness emerged two colossal eyes.

A layer of black divine light covered Netherdragon Tianzhao, and a pair of black dragon horns appeared in his flowing hair.

As those dragon horns manifested, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s aura erupted like a volcano, and a towering column of black light soared into the sky.

Finally, Netherdragon Tianzhao unleashed his real divine power, revealing that the giant eyes behind him were dragon eyes. The dragon was so enormous that the world seemed to not be able to contain it, so its immense size condensed to only reveal two eyes within the vast darkness.

In a swift motion, Netherdragon Tianzhao pointed a finger at Long Chen, and a streak of black lightning tore through the world.
