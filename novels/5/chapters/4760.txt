Chapter 4749 Despicable and Shameless

‚ÄúBack in the day, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race was completely despicable, betraying the Nine Tail race. The enmity between you has reached the point where you cannot coexist under the same heavens. You will likely encounter them in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. However, I should warn you of one thing. Now, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race is even stronger than they were in the past. As for your Violet Pupil Nine Tail race, you have been sealed away and hunted for so many years. It will be extremely difficult for you to get your revenge,‚Äù explained the sweeping elder.

‚ÄúI know, but this blood debt must be avenged. Even if I die, I have to drag a few monkeys down with me,‚Äù replied Little Nine resolutely.

Long Chen and the others were dumbfounded. They hadn‚Äôt expected Little Nine to be hiding such a thing. It had never mentioned it before.

Seeing blood tears welling up in Little Nine's eyes due to its intense hatred, Long Chen gently patted it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, your matters are our matters. Your boss will help you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBoss...‚Äù

Little Nine couldn‚Äôt hold back its tears. After everyone asked about it, it told them a shocking secret.

It was something from the primal chaos era, the most prosperous era of this world, when countless powerful races came into existence.

As the sweeping elder mentioned, many powerful races had been the masters of the nine heavens, and during the primal chaos era, the demon race reigned supreme. They had once ruled the nine heavens for a very long time.

At that time, the demon races had united to claim this position, and other factions had to band together just to survive.

During that era, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race were the closest of allies. Together, they produced numerous heavenly geniuses. While the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race harbored no ambitions for dominance, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race was very ambitious.

Exploiting their alliance, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race manipulated the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race, sowing discord between them and other factions. When those factions united against the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race emerged to defend them.

However, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race was incredibly vicious, slaughtering countless factions and instantly becoming the primary target of those factions. Unaware of their ally's treachery, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race staunchly defended them, deploying their full power to save them.

Seizing the opportunity, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race manipulated the major factions once more, turning them against the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race. In the ensuing chaos, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race found themselves battling against nearly the entire world alone.

Left with no other choice, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race had to use all of their trump cards, causing blood to rain throughout the nine heavens for thousands of years. Even as the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race took hideous casualties, their name went down in history for their ferocity.

Then all of a sudden, the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race, which had been in hiding all these years, burst out, sweeping through these powerful enemies.

Because the opposing factions had drained their resources against the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race, they knew they could only submit. Their choices were to be annihilated or to join them as subordinates.

However, instead of submitting to the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race, they pledged allegiance to the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race. It was at this point that the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race started to sense that something was amiss.

They had gone all-out to aid the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race when the latter faced the threat of annihilation, even at a tremendous cost. However, witnessing the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race's overwhelming power as they effortlessly vanquished their enemies, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race became incensed. They demanded an explanation for the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race's actions.

However, never in their wildest imagination would they expect the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race to tear apart their ancestral blood soul contract, ordering all their new subordinates to attack the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race in full force.

The Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race personally attacked as well. In a devastating, thunderous assault, they charged into the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race‚Äôs ancestral land to destroy their ancestral Sovereign Blood Writ.

This Sovereign Blood Writ was a legacy treasure of the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race. Recorded on this writ was the alliance between their race and the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race. Originally, tearing apart this contract would activate the Sovereign blood curse, afflicting the other party with a curse that would persist through their generations, gradually weakening them until their eventual demise.

It was due to this that the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race had harbored unwavering trust in the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race. Their faith in their allies was unshakeable.

However, this trust proved to be their undoing. With the destruction of the Sovereign Blood Writ, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race lost their means to contain the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race, leading to their complete devastation.

After enduring thousands of years of warfare, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race had suffered significant losses. When the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race launched their assault, they tore through the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race like rotten wood, leaving only a fraction of their population to escape.

Yet, even in flight, they found no refuge, as they were relentlessly pursued by the entire demon world. With the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race having united nearly all demonkind, there was nowhere left for the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race to seek sanctuary.

After being hunted and chased to the ends of the world, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race gradually vanished from everyone‚Äôs story, becoming merely legend.

Long Chen and the others had heard of the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox before, but they had never heard of such a backstory. Clearly, history was written by the victors, and this was part of the covered-up dark history.

Nevertheless, the hatred from the events was deeply carved within the hearts of every Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox. From the moment they were born, this hatred sprouted deep within their souls.

Little Nine had kept this a secret all this time, including from Bai Xiaole. That was because it understood the sheer terror of its mortal enemies and the slim chances of revenge. Moreover, its pride did not permit it to seek aid from others. Yet, Long Chen disregarded the consequences, shouldering this responsibility with unwavering loyalty and heroism, which deeply moved Little Nine.

The Dragonblood warriors, brimming with indignation, yearned to exact vengeance immediately. ‚ÄúDamn Heavenly Demon Golden Monkeys, when I have a chance, I‚Äôll turn them into rugs! I‚Äôll expose the real face of those treacherous bastards!‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle Nine, don‚Äôt worry. Since you‚Äôre a member of the Dragonblood Legion, your matters are our matters. The entire Dragonblood Legion can no longer exist under the same heavens as the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race!‚Äù promised Guo Ran.

All the Dragonblood warriors cared about loyalty the most and viewed betrayal as the ultimate offense. Even if Little Nine weren‚Äôt a part of their legion, they would still confront the Heavenly Demon Golden Monkey race for the sake of justice alone.

Little Nine was extremely moved. It tried to say something, but it found that it couldn‚Äôt come up with anything to express its gratitude.

‚ÄúHave you heard of Jin Wuji?‚Äù asked the sweeping elder after hearing Little Nine‚Äôs story.

‚ÄúYou speak of the Heavenly Demon Monkey Sovereign, Jin Wuji?‚Äù asked Little Nine in shock. G√™tt the latest chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com

‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôm going to tell you a piece of bad news. He is in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.‚Äù

Little Nine felt as though it had been struck by lightning, rendered motionless and numb.
