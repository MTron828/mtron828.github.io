Chapter 4695 Ruthless Slaughter

When the black saber appeared, an ominous darkness shrouded the world, causing the various Saint weapons throughout the battlefield to lose their luster.

As Long Chen’s hand closed around the hilt of the saber, a familiar feeling that he had been missing all this time rose in his heart. In an instant, the memories of his battles alongside this cherished companion filled his mind.

“Sorry for being late!” said Dragonbone Evilmoon.

“You’re just in time. Can I use my full power?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course. With me here, you can unleash as much power as you have,” replied Evilmoon heroically.

“Alright, then let’s celebrate our reunion with a feast of slaughter!”

Long Chen’s entire aim changed. It was like something he had been suppressing for many years instantly erupted.

Dragonbone Evilmoon slashed down and shattered Luo Changsheng’s saber like a twig, completely stunning him.

BOOM!

With a swift motion, Evilmoon cleaved through the bone claw, slicing it cleanly in two. The saber then continued its descent, slicing through Luo Changsheng’s head and exiting through his groin. Yet, not a single drop of blood stained Evilmoon’s blade.

Long Chen simply rested Evilmoon on his shoulder. Finally, one man and one saber had reunited. Witnessing this familiar sight, the Dragonblood warriors were overcome with emotion, tears streaming down their faces. Their boss had returned.

As Luo Changsheng’s body slowly split apart, tumbling through the sky, his eyes remained frozen in an expression of disbelief. Even in death, he couldn’t believe that he was the one to die, not Long Chen.

This sudden change made all the experts behind Luo Changsheng jump in fright. However, they had already launched their attacks and couldn’t pull them back.

“Dragon Sovereign Blood Ignition, Ten Thousand Daos to One!” Long Chen shouted. Blood then oozed out of his dragon scales and cloak, becoming a roaring fire.

“Five slashes in one, Split the Heavens 5!”

Long Chen swung Dragonbone Evilmoon, unleashing a crescent fang that swiftly enveloped their enemies and blew them to bits along with their weapons. The crescent fang slashed through them mercilessly, cutting the very world in two. In its wake, heaven and earth seemed disjointed. Countless heavenly geniuses met their demise just like that, and only a handful of them survived.

At this moment, a white bone horse flew off, dragging a bronze cauldron behind it. Yin Jiushang was fleeing.

BOOM!

When the giant heavenly blade descended, one man, one chariot, and one horse were blown into smithereens. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen thrust Evilmoon forward abruptly, the sharp tip of the saber piercing through the void until a figure materialized before him.

“You stabbed me once, and now I’ve returned the favor,” Long Chen declared, his gaze fixed on Ying Tian, who was impaled on his saber.

Even in the face of imminent death, Ying Tian remained composed. Without a trace of fear, he calmly admitted, “I concede today. But this matter will not end here. Do you know how many of my people are behind that gate? Once it opens, hahaha—!”

Just as Ying Tian was laughing, Evilmoon trembled and crushed him into pieces. At that exact moment, Evilmoon swung through the air with boundless dragon might.

Evilmoon’s blade met a spear, instantly cutting it in two. It then continued to slice Wu Hun’s bald head and body in two.

To Long Chen’s astonishment, Wu Hun did not regenerate, nor did his three-colored divine light persist. He was dead.

This turn of events confounded not only Long Chen but also the Dragonblood warriors. Didn’t Wu Hun possess an undying body? How did he suddenly die?

“Evilmoon, have you...?”

“Don’t waste time. Those small fries are escaping.”

As Evilmoon swept through the air, in the distance, three figures were cut to pieces. They were Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yan Tianhua, and another expert.

Long Chen then vanished and reappeared in the way of two more fleeing experts.

“We’ll drag you down with us!”

The faces of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight's disciples contorted with rage as they launched their attacks. The Brahma Divine Diagram and the pill cauldron then hurtled toward Long Chen with immense force.

However, both divine weapons were effortlessly sliced apart by Evilmoon, and the two disciples exploded. In front of Evilmoon, they were not even worth mentioning.

The Brahma Divine Diagram and pill cauldron actually ignited at this moment, turning into ash just like that.

“Hmph, Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight are quite clever. They always take back what they give. How shameless,” sneered Long Chen.

When Long Chen killed those two, he intentionally kept an eye on the Heavenly Dao Tree in the primal chaos space and found that there was no reaction when the two of them died.

Once the two of them were dead, the power of their weapons and the energy in their bodies were taken back. As a result, Long Chen didn’t get anything from their deaths. This also showed that even personal disciples were nothing more than tools to Lord Brahma. Once a tool lost its value, all the investment in it would be taken back.

Just then, lightning flashed through the sky, enveloping this world.

“What’s happening?! The heavenly tribulation isn’t over?!”

Guo Ran and the others jumped in fright when they saw this. The lightning had covered this entire world.

Long Chen had killed all the apex monsters within the tribulation, and the cowards who had attacked the Dragonblood Legion had fled.

However, once they got to a certain range, they were shocked to find that there was an invisible lightning wall in front of them, and they couldn’t do anything against it. Following that, the ring of lightning started to shrink, forcing them back. In front of them was this unbreakable lightning wall, and behind them was a death god.

Having previously attacked the Dragonblood Legion, they knew Long Chen wouldn’t let them off. Whether they perished by the hands of Long Chen or succumbed to the lightning ring, their end was inevitable.

During his tribulation, Long Chen had made a solemn vow not to spare any of his enemies. Therefore, even amidst his own crisis, Lei Linger had meticulously laid a massive trap, one that would ensnare everyone within its grasp.

“Let us go, please! We were wrong!”

Some experts directly begged for mercy, but it was meaningless. They were temporarily submitting in the face of death. Hence, Long Chen ignored them, having Lei Linger kill them all.

Lei Linger had now absorbed an incredible amount of energy from the heavenly tribulation, and her power was definitely above those nine star Heavenly Doyens. As a result, killing these people took no effort from her at all. In no time at all, the world settled down, and all that remained was the Dragonblood Legion.

“Long Chen, is it? That was quite ruthless of you! Are you not afraid of the retribution?”

Just then, a furious roar came from the other side of the gate to the ninth heaven.
