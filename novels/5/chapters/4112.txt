Chapter 4101 The Hand Behind the Scenes

Just then, the very sky trembled, and the surroundings became illusory-like. Before all those present, a diagram of a rhinoceros gazing up at a resplendent full moon materialized.

As soon as this diagram appeared, every member of the Fullmoon race, without exception, rose from their seats in a dignified manner.

Following that, they all knelt, their left hands over their chests, as they performed an extremely ancient etiquette.

After this was done, the race leader returned to his seat and coldly said, “I don’t want to waste words. Everyone who participated in this matter, stand up.”

Following his order, several Heaven Venerates and hundreds of Earth Venerates stood with their heads lowered, along with thousands of other experts.

“Brother Changchuan, what is going on? Why are these people so afraid?” whispered Long Chen.

“Brother Long, this is my Fullmoon race’s ancestral spirit totem. Every member of the Fullmoon race has received her blessing, so every single one of our movements and every thought in our minds, they are all known to her. No one can lie in front of the ancestral spirit. However, summoning her is a major affair, as it exhausts the core of the Fullmoon race’s karmic luck. Actually, I never expected the race leader to do this. Perhaps the race leader is truly enraged this time,” said Xu Changchuan.

“Enraged? Perhaps it’s not so simple.” Long Chen shook his head.

“What do you mean?”

“As the leader of his race, the one who decides the fate of an entire race, he cannot let his anger influence his decision-making,” said Long Chen. He felt that this matter was definitely not so simple.

The race leader’s expression was frighteningly dark, causing the experts of the Fullmoon race that stood up to look as pale as paper. They didn’t know what kind of punishment they would receive.

It had to be known that the ancestral spirit totem had not been summoned in hundreds of thousands of years. Normally, it was only summoned to drive off enemies.

Right now, there were no enemies, but the race leader still summoned her, so all these people had a bad feeling.

Long Chen’s gaze swept over these experts and sensed seventeen Heaven Venerates. All of them had powerful auras, far surpassing the Heaven Venerates of the human race that he had fought before. It seemed that the human race was truly at a disadvantage compared to other races in the Heaven Venerate realm.

“Those who didn’t know of this matter, leave!” ordered the race leader.

Quite a few people left, feeling relieved. Many people only attacked at the start because they had heard the call that enemies had come. They knew nothing about this matter.

However, just as they left, seven of them exploded. Their blood was then absorbed by the ancestral spirit totem.

“These idiots. They dared to lie in front of the ancestral spirit totem. That is the greatest blasphemy,” raged Xu Changchuan.

Every person in the Fullmoon race had received the sacred blessing of the ancestral spirit totem. That was what allowed them to have their current accomplishments. The ancestral spirit totem was their ancestor’s heroic spirit, and these people had hoped to trick her? Their audacity enraged the experts of the Fullmoon race.

The race leader’s expression sank even further. He coldly said, “Those who didn’t interact with other races may leave.”

Two Heaven Venerates left with relief, along with the majority of the Earth Venerates.

Now there were fifteen Heaven Venerates and just over a hundred Earth Venerates remaining. They were all terrified.

The race leader looked at them for a long time before finally sighing.

“Scheming to harm Changchuan over the competition for the position of race leader might be a sin, but it is not to the point of deserving death.”

However, his voice then grew colder, and killing intent exploded out of him.

“However, colluding with other races to shake the foundation of my Fullmoon race, corroding the foundation that our ancestors left behind, there is no greater sin than that! Death is not enough to atone for your sins!”

Toward the end, his voice became a roar. He was clearly enraged. Right now, the Fullmoon experts who were innocent stared in horror at these people, not daring to believe it. How did the competition for the position of race leader develop to this point? It was no wonder that the race leader summoned the ancestral spirit totem.

“Race leader, we didn’t collude with other races! Although our methods might not have been right, we believe that a suitable leader must possess both power and intelligence. We might have sinned, but not to the extent of deserving death! As for collusion with other races, that’s a false accusation! We merely do some minor business with them! It is all to strengthen the Fullmoon race!” shouted a Heaven Venerate righteously.

The race leader snorted coldly. “Hmph, so you won’t cry until you see your coffins. Do you know why I summoned the ancestral spirit totem? I can’t tell if you’re lying, but the ancestral spirit can. Tell me, were you the ones to think of the plot to harm Changchaun, or did others help you come up with it?”

In an instant, that Heaven Venerate began to sweat and obediently answered, “The majority was made up by them.”

“Hmph, I knew it. With your brains, there’s no way you could come up with such a meticulous plan. You only know how to fight with brute power. Then tell me, who thought of killing Changchuan first? Did you think of it yourselves, or did they suggest it?”

“It was them.” The Heaven Venerate could only answer truthfully.

“Did you pocket any benefits from them? This is a question for all of you. If you haven’t, you can leave,” said the race leader coldly.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hearing this, quite a few people twitched, but in the end, not one of them left. They had all received benefits from outsiders.

“A pack of fools. How can you be so foolish?” roared an old Heaven Venerate who wasn’t in their ranks.

If they didn’t view Xu Changchuan highly and didn’t think that he was suited to lead them, resulting in them sending people to bar his way, it was a sin, but not one deserving death. However, receiving benefits from people outside their race changed the matter completely.

“You’re the fool. Your entire family are fools. All of you are fools!” Suddenly, the Heaven Venerate to answer the questions cursed, throwing caution to the wind. He pointed at the race leader and sneered. “And you are the greatest fool of the Fullmoon race. You don’t know kindness when you see it. The Fullmoon race will be destroyed due to your stubbornness sooner or later!”

“Have you gone crazy?!”

“You dare to insult the race leader?! Are you looking to die?!”

Countless experts roared in fury.

“Who cares about the ancestral spirit totem? What can it do to me? You wish to judge me? Are you even qualified?”

Buzz.

Suddenly, that Heaven Venerate formed hand seals, and a holy figure appeared, its light enveloping all of the offenders. When Long Chen saw that figure, he instantly shot up.

“Lord Brahma?!”
