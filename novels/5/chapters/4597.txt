Chapter 4586 Lei Linger vs. Netherdragon Tianzhao

BOOM!

As wild energy exploded out of the lightning runes around Lei Linger, Long Chen felt a burst of power crash into him. Helpless against its onslaught, he was hurled through the air, crashing violently into the walls of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Long Chen‚Äôs heart shook. When he cast a glance back at Lei Linger, she appeared like a goddess of lightning. The magnitude of her full power was simply beyond his expectations.

While Lei Linger had engaged in battles prior to this, she had always wielded power within her complete control. This unbridled display of her true might was utterly terrifying.

When Long Chen told her to go all-out, she directly undid her seal, causing her power to burst like an unrestrained horse. That was why she had told Long Chen to distance himself, as she could not fully control this power.

When this wild power surged forth, Netherdragon Tianzhao was its first victim. A torrent of lightning sent him flying.

To his surprise, he was unable to resist this torrent of lightning. Now, he felt like he was lost in heavenly tribulation, and his fate was no longer in his own hands.

Netherdragon Tianzhao tried to use his spear to resist the lightning, but his efforts were futile as his spear was enveloped by crackling lightning that paralyzed half of his body. The sensation was akin to millions of needles mercilessly piercing his hands.

Despite the dire predicament, it was undeniable that Netherdragon Tianzhao was a terrifying existence. Any other expert would have succumbed to Lei Linger‚Äôs power.

Lei Linger was unleashing the purest Saint lightning, something that Eternal experts had to go through during tribulation.

The Eternal realm had three levels: Eternal, Saint, and Sage King. Each transition between these three realms called forth Saint lightning, albeit with different thunderforce.

In the primal chaos space, Long Chen had tossed in a lot of corpses. As they sank into the black soil, the thunderforce locked inside their bodies was unleashed.

Although each individual corpse didn‚Äôt contain much thunderforce, the remaining thunderforce in their bodies was always the purest kind of thunderforce that was also the easiest to absorb.

Immersed in the relentless torrent of Saint lightning day after day, Lei Linger gradually learned how to use it. However, she couldn‚Äôt use it for a prolonged time. It was like a beggar sitting on a mountain of gold, possessing wealth but lacking the knowledge to use it.

Hence, she had to invent this kind of seal. By sealing it within her, the Saint lightning could not leave and gradually merged with her.

In her previous battles, she hadn‚Äôt dared to undo this seal because her control wasn‚Äôt strong enough yet. After all, Saint lightning would run rampant once unleashed.

However, through this period, Lei Linger had managed to control at least a portion of the Saint lightning‚Äôs power. While it was only a fraction of its full potential, it instilled her with newfound confidence.

‚ÄúA little lightning spirit dares to be arrogant?! Scram!‚Äù Netherdragon Tianzhao roared. As the black qi around him ignited, a supreme divine might erupted. It was the Nether Emperor‚Äôs power.

BOOM!

Both Netherdragon Tianzhao and Lei Linger were sent flying backward by the impact. Lei Linger had lost an arm in the clash. Meanwhile, Netherdragon Tianzhao spat out a mouthful of blood, his vision swimming in stars.

He had never expected a lightning spirit to be able to block the power of the Nether Emperor‚Äîa supreme existence. Even if he could only control a trace of it, it was a power that could destroy heaven and earth.

However, this supreme power couldn‚Äôt defeat a single lightning spirit. A turbulent mix of shock and fury surged within Netherdragon Tianzhao at this realization.

Little did Netherdragon Tianzhao know that Lei Linger‚Äôs thunderforce derived from heavenly tribulation, imbuing it with a resistance against the Nether Emperor‚Äôs might, which primarily targeted mortal lifeforms and wasn‚Äôt that effective against the law of the heavens.

With a light sway, lightning runes condensed into a new arm for Lei Linger. At the same time, she also materialized a lightning spear in her hand. Its pitch-black hue shimmered with the radiance of dragon scales, and it had an uncanny resemblance with Netherdragon Tianzhao‚Äôs dragon spear.

This was a divine weapon condensed from lightning runes. However, these were black lightning runes that represented divine punishment, death, and annihilation.

When Long Chen underwent tribulation, traces of this black lightning would appear, increasing in intensity as he got stronger. This black lightning symbolized more than mere power; it embodied the relentless force of annihilation dictated by the laws of the Heavenly Daos.

Previously, Lei Linger had not reached a level where she could harness this annihilation will. However, as she absorbed the Saint lightning‚Äôs essence, she gradually attained mastery over this formidable power.

In truth, Lei Linger may have possessed the ability to wield this power for quite some time, perhaps unknowingly. In front of Netherdragon Tianzhao, she felt like she needed a divine weapon crafted from something stronger To her surprise, she had summoned annihilation lightning.

Lei Linger didn‚Äôt retreat in front of Netherdragon Tianzhao‚Äôs attack and stepped forward, thrusting her lightning spear at him.

BOOM!

As two identical divine weapons crashed together, an explosion of apocalyptic power ensued. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest erupted in chaos, with countless dragon corpses hurtling through the air. The Netherdragon experts within were sent flying, while the weaker ones directly died.

In a single devastating attack, they destroyed the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Long Chen just stood in stunned silence. While he had anticipated that Lei Linger‚Äôs power might surpass his own, he hadn't imagined her to wield such overwhelming strength.

‚ÄúThe great power of the Nether Emperor isn‚Äôt something a brainless fellow like you can resist!‚Äù roared Netherdragon Tianzhao, his hair flying wretchedly. He seemed to have gone insane.

Despite unleashing his full power in that last attack, he still almost spat out blood. He never thought that there would be someone in this world who could resist the power of the Nether Emperor.

Like a madman, Netherdragon Tianzhao repeatedly attacked with his dragon spear, causing dragon cries to reverberate throughout the heavens and earth.

Lei Linger faced him head-on. Although she seemed small and frail, her power was limitless. In front of his barrage of attacks, she continued to advance and attack. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

BOOM!

Another powerful explosion erupted and blew both of them back. Lei Linger then pointed her black spear at Netherdragon Tianzhao, her gaze sharp.

Netherdragon Tianzhao looked very disheveled, his scarlet eyes showing a sense of frustration. Despite his relentless onslaught, he failed to gain any advantage over a lightning spirit‚Äîa realization that nearly drove him to madness.

Suddenly, Netherdragon Tianzhao turned to Long Chen, his gaze bearing a lethal intensity.

Sitting far away, Long Chen nonchalantly indulged in refreshments and wine on a table, observing the chaos with leisure.

‚ÄúYou fucker!‚Äù

Netherdragon Tianzhao finally snapped. A crown-like rune appeared on his forehead, ablaze with dark energy. His aura instantly grew sinister and terrifying as if he had been possessed by something malevolent.
