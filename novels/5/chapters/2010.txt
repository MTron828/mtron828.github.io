“Oh? Isn’t this the great leader of the Peng race? How coincidental to run into you here?” Long Chen acted surprised to see the furious Peng Wanli. He then laughed, “Truly, thank you for your generosity. As for your gift, I’ll accept it. Many thanks for your support of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. There’s no need to invite us for dinner; we still have many guests waiting for us at home. Let us meet again!”

Seeing Long Chen turn to leave, Peng Wanli roared, “Long Chen, hand over our resources, or don’t even think about leaving alive!”

“Your resources? What proof do you have that these resources belong to you?” Long Chen cocked his head at him. “Do they have your name on them? Or your seal? Are they yours just because you say they are?”

Long Chen was being absolutely shameless. Peng Wanli felt like he might explode with rage as he had never seen anyone so shameless. Long Chen’s shamelessness was actually above the Xuan Beasts’.

“Don’t try twisting logic! Those are resources we bought from Pill Valley! Pill Valley can testify!” shouted Peng Wanli.

More and more experts of the Xuan Beasts arrived. But when they saw the Dragonblood Legion and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, their expressions changed.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had once been kings amongst the Xuan Beasts. Their divine abilities were famed for their power. Later on, for some unknown reasons, the Peng race joined hands with several other large races to expel them from the Xuan Beasts. Several large battles were fought.

Although most of the experts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race were killed in those battles, the battles had injured the very core of the Xuan Beasts. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had actually been powerful enough to deal a grave blow to the Xuan Beasts even as they were ousted. From this fact, it could be seen just how frightening they were.

Now that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had Long Chen’s support and was rising on the continent once more, the Xuan Beasts were all tense.

Long Chen couldn’t help laughing at Peng Wanli. “How interesting. So even the unreasonable Xuan Beasts are willing to give proof to others? How did unreasonable people like you start talking about such things with me? Could it be that you’re now afraid of me and don’t dare to attack me? However, I’m not here to talk reason with you today. I came to accept your gift. I’ve now taken it, and whether or not you like it, I’m taking it. What can you do?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

All the craftsmen that had been working here looked at Long Chen oddly. Long Chen was definitely domineering enough. The Xuan Beasts were famed for being unreasonable and suppressing others with their power. But today, Long Chen was openly taking their things.

The craftsmen sighed inside. Finally, a true domineering existence had appeared amongst the human race. He was practically a bandit. It seemed that such a scenario had never occurred in all the history of the Xuan Beasts.

Although the ancient family alliance was no longer allied with the Martial Heaven Alliance, in the end, they were still part of the human race. Seeing Long Chen be so domineering, they couldn’t help feeling admiration for him.

“Long Chen, are you declaring war on the Xuan Beasts?” demanded Peng Wanli. He took out a pitch-black spear. When that spear appeared, the air grew heavy. That was an incredible divine item. A terrifying aura spread like that of an ancient beast.

Long Chen summoned Evilmoon and rested it on his shoulder. He took a few steps forward until he was less than a mile from Peng Wanli. “Peng Wanli, since I dared to come, I’m confident in being able to leave safely. If you want to fight, of course I’ll welcome you. Our enmity doesn’t stem back just one or two days. If you want to bring our enmity to an end today, I’d be very pleased. Don’t the Xuan Beasts like sending gifts? Today, I am stating this clearly. I’m here to accept your gift. If you’re giving, I’m taking. If you’re not giving, I’m still taking. If you’re giving, I’ll treat it as a gift. If you’re not giving, I’ll treat it as a protection fee. To put it even clearer, I’m here to find trouble with you. You can suck it up, or you can fight,” said Long Chen. Even as more Xuan Beasts gathered here, he didn’t have the slightest fear. Instead, his battle intent was flowing out of him.

The Dragonblood warriors cheered, their voices filled with killing intent. It was bone-chilling. These were the warriors of the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one legion. Even Netherpassage experts were terrified.

“Long Chen, you have gone too far!” Peng Wanli was shuddering from rage. He had never suffered such humiliation in his whole life.

At this moment, Que Yuzhu suddenly stepped forward. “We have gone too far? Peng Wanli, it was you who was envious of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s divine abilities. You wanted to connect our races by marriage, but we refused, so you allied with other races to expel us. You even framed us as blasphemers of the Peng Emperor. Using that excuse, you hunted us down until we were almost exterminated. Was that not going too far?” This secret of the Xuan Beasts was actually exposed.

“Absolute nonsense. My Kunpeng race has the bloodline of the great Peng race. Why would we care about your pitiful bloodline? It was clearly your Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race that got arrogant and wanted to change the name of the Peng Emperor to the Sparrow Emperor. The historical records are very clear. Don’t you feel embarrassed making up such lies? The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race blasphemed the Peng Emperor, wanting to become the absolute rulers and destroying the peaceful unity of the Xuan Beasts. Every one of you should be put to the death!” shouted Peng Wanli.

“You-!”

Long Chen raised a hand. “Race leader, we are not here to discuss history. We are here to accept gifts. There is no absolute black or white in this world. As for who is black and who is white, it depends on whose fist is bigger. Whoever’s fist is bigger is whoever’s mouth is bigger, and whoever’s mouth is bigger is the right one. If someone argues, they can just be eaten. There is no need for reason. So don’t be angry. Your only fault was not being strong enough to threaten certain people’s positions. For them to eliminate potential threats isn’t wrong of them. Whether it’s in the cultivation world or the world of the Xuan Beasts, such a thing is common. That’s why talking reason is meaningless. Even if they apologized, would you forgive them? So a blood debt must be paid with blood. As for arguing who is right and who is wrong, there’s no need.”

Hearing that, Que Yuzhu calmed down. Long Chen was correct. Debating history had no meaning. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had been hunted down for so many years. So many of them had died to their hands. If the history was cleared up and their enemies apologized, would that be enough for them? No.

“Peng Wanli, I’ve taken your gift. Again, I have guests waiting for me, so we won’t be staying for dinner. Of course, if you want to keep us here, I’d be delighted. However, I should warn you that my temper isn’t good. If I drink too much, I might just destroy a hundred of your races. That’s why...”

Suddenly, a strange sound rang out. It was so loud that it eclipsed Long Chen’s voice. Everyone turned toward a certain person in the Dragonblood Legion.

It was Wilde. Wilde had dozed off, and that sound had been the sound of his stomach rumbling. The sound woke him up, and seeing the Xuan Beasts in front of him, he shouted, “Brother Long, is it time to eat? I’m hungry!”

Wilde’s gaze made those Xuan Beasts shiver in terror. In the last battle, Wilde had killed many of their experts, including True Immortal Jiaoqi. They had then been eaten by him. That scene was still fresh in their minds. To the Xuan Beasts, Wilde was a terrifying monster.

Wilde was not a cultivator, and he didn’t have any of the aura of a cultivator. That was why they had overlooked him before. But after that last battle, all of them were apprehensive of him. He was a monster that hungered for their flesh. Even Peng Wanli’s expression changed.

During that battle, the leader of the ancient races, Long Juncang, had only been able to hold Wilde back. He hadn’t been able to suppress this crazy monster.

The Dragonblood Legion didn’t just have Long Chen. Wilde’s power was no lower than his, and there were also the captains like Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, as well as Xia Chen, Guo Ran, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Liu Ruyan, and Cloud.

Only a portion of the Xuan Beasts had gathered, and the rest were still on the way. If they were to fight now, Peng Wanli was confident in being able to block Long Chen and Wilde, but the others were also dangerous.

The Dragonblood warriors were like wolves, and adding on the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, rivers of blood would flow. That blood would definitely belong to the Xuan Beasts. Long Chen’s arrival today was too sudden, and they hadn’t been the slightest bit prepared.

“Let’s go back and eat. Of course, if anyone wants to hold us back, we won’t mind eating here.”

Now Long Chen’s words had a double meaning. Of course, Wilde understood it in only a simple manner. He would rather eat here because there was more food here, and the quality was better.

Wilde involuntarily gulped down a mouthful of saliva. The way his eyes stared at them gave them goosebumps. It seemed like he was begging them to stop Long Chen.

Long Chen then led his people away just like that. The Xuan Beasts that had formed an encirclement around them didn’t dare to make a sound. They hastily scattered.

Peng Wanli clenched his spear tightly. His whole arm was shaking, but in the end, he didn’t move to stop Long Chen. He just watched as Long Chen and the others vanished.

BOO!

Peng Wanli slammed his spear into the ground. A wave of dust soared into the sky.

“Long Chen, just wait for next time!”
