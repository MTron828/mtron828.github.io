Chapter 1590 Blood-Colored Lake

Translator: BornToBe

That voice was something Qu Jianying had left behind. Long Chen was absolutely speechless. Could it be that as one’s cultivation base grew, it became more difficult for oxygen to reach their brain? Even at this time, she still had to be so competitive?

This was no different than a slap to the old man’s face. It was like an eighty-year-old playing in the mud. At this time, the old man was quivering with rage.

“Old man, this time I’m definitely on your side! We won’t let this enmity off lightly!” cried Long Chen righteously.

“Exactly! Don’t you think that woman is hateful?” raged the old man.

“Yes, you’re absolutely right. If I had women like that, I’d be beaten all day. However, we’ve lost this time. Now that we’ve activated the jade case, whether or not we use it, we owe her a debt. How absolutely sinister!” Long Chen was now on the same side as the old man.

“She really pisses me off. Long Chen, you have lots of evil ideas. What do we do?” demanded the old man.

“What else can we do? Having taken such a loss, if we walked away with our heads lowered, wouldn’t it be so shameful that all men would be laughed at?” said Long Chen helplessly.

“Fuck, I was grateful to her for nothing. She really needs a beating!” said the old man hatefully.

Long Chen felt like he had worked so hard for nothing. This senior Qu had to really be bored to add something so childish to her good intentions.

“Old man, let’s put this aside for now. We can’t waste this. We can’t suffer this loss for nothing. We’ll get our revenge for this later,” said Long Chen.

“Fine, I won’t bother with her. Tch, she definitely thinks that this would make me too angry to use this. Well, I won’t let things go as she wishes!” laughed the old man.

Long Chen was startled. So it really was senior Qu who understood the old man the best. He had actually misunderstood her intentions.

When he thought about it closely, this move of Qu Jianying’s was a bit superfluous. Since the old man had activated the jade case, it meant the old man had already accepted this favor. Provoking him some more was extra. Ah, the realm of supreme experts truly wasn’t something lower people could understand.

“Sit down. This is a memory formation condensed through life and death energy. Once activated, we’ll see how she entered the Netherworld. Don’t be careless. No matter what you see, don’t make a sound,” warned the old man.

“Alright, I understand.” Long Chen nodded.

The old man sat in a lotus-style position and pressed two fingers to his forehead. Long Chen felt some faint life and death energy flowing out of him.

Although the old man hadn’t reached the Netherpassage realm, he had comprehended the Dao of Life and Death. He was in possession of the slightest bit of life and death energy.

As his life and death energy circulated, the surroundings changed. Long Chen suddenly closed his sixth sense, and he saw that the surroundings were pitch-black.

He knew that this darkness was Qu Jianying’s memories. Long Chen had to experience it as she did, so he couldn’t activate the sixth sense.

As for any danger, he left that up to Evilmoon. It would warn him if there was any danger. Furthermore, the old man had the Heaven Splitting Blade. With two divine items protecting them, there wouldn’t be any problems.

The darkness seemed endless. It felt like he had been devoured by it and entered a world of eternity. Here, there was no time, no space.

“This is the world of death?”

Netherpassage experts were able to control their life and death.

This phrase sounded nonsensical. Who couldn’t control their life and death? Couldn’t they just kill themselves?

However, this phrase meant something different. Netherpassage experts had to experience true death.

The physical body died. The Yuan Spirit died. However, the Netherpassage experts would retain the slightest trace of life, using it to enter the gate to the Netherworld. Then they would return from that gate, completing a cycle of life and death. After that, they would have truly reached the Netherpassage realm.

The darkness Long Chen was seeing was the darkness Qu Jianying had experienced after dying. This darkness would evoke instinctual fear in people.

There was no light.

There was no sound.

There was nothing.

Everything was still in death.

Suddenly, Long Chen saw a huge gate ahead of him. It was open just a crack.

His body moved toward the gate involuntarily, toward the crack. Long Chen knew that he was seeing things from Qu Jianying’s point of view.

Once he was through the gate, he saw a giant bridge ahead of him. What shocked Long Chen was that this bridge had many people randomly wandering around.

As he walked forward, he saw a humanoid monstrosity in extremely ancient robes. This humanoid was carrying chains with huge hooks at the end.

This figure was using its chains to kill the people on the bridge. Anyone struck by its chains would be turned to mist and vanish from sight.

The humanoid monstrosity had strange runes in its eyes. However, it seemed to not see Qu Jianying. It was constantly tidying up the people on the bridge who were roaming around randomly.

As it killed those people, mist rose into the air. The bridge was quickly tidied up.

The slain people didn’t react at all. They didn’t dodge, they didn’t run. They didn’t seem to know what fear was. Their expressions were wooden as they were killed.

As the monstrosity killed more of them, its chains grew brighter.

After a while, the monstrosity walked to a stone pillar at the side of the bridge. At the top of the pillar was a head-sized stone.

The stone flowed with light. It was like a pearl. Through Qu Jianying’s sight, Long Chen could sense terrifying spiritual fluctuations coming from the stone.

“A definite treasure. Those people’s souls were all gathered into this orb. The Spiritual Strength inside it has reached the pinnacle of purity. Just what is going on? Those people didn’t look like cultivators. They seemed like ordinary people who came here in a spiritual state, but they didn’t have any spiritual fluctuations. And that strange monstrosity, he seems like a jailor. Those chains are extremely powerful against souls,” thought Long Chen.

Everything he was seeing, hearing, and feeling was the same as what Qu Jianying had experienced when she had entered the Netherworld. His line of sight could not be moved. Long Chen guessed that Qu Jianying was currently hidden in a corner.

Just at this moment, a huge gate appeared in the air, and a figure walked out from a crack. Long Chen was startled. It was someone from a race he had never seen before.

He was three meters tall with a body covered in scales. He had a single horn on his head and a fish-like tail on his back. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

A member of the ancient races? No, his aura was completely different. A Xuan Beast? Also wrong. This person had a dark aura that was different from any of the lifeforms on the Martial Heaven Continent.

Long Chen suddenly understood something. A Netherpassage expert who entered the Netherworld had their own gate. This person’s gate had appeared not far from Qu Jianying’s gate.

That person’s gaze swept around, even going past Qu Jianying. However, he didn’t see her. Qu Jianying must be hidden very well.

Long Chen praised Qu Jianying inside. This attention to detail was definitely far superior to the old man. If it had been him, he would definitely not have thought of hiding and observing things first.

This tailed person walked forward. He quickly reached the center of the bridge and saw the monstrosity killing the souls.

The tailed person snorted and sent a punch at the monstrosity. His punch was incredibly powerful, but he was sent flying by a punch from the monstrosity.

Long Chen was startled. “It’s possible to activate magical arts and Battle Skills here? Then the spiritual body that enters this place is actually also a physical body. What a strange place.”

Just at this moment, a blood-colored rune appeared in that monstrosity’s eyes. The chain in its hand shot toward the tailed man.

The tailed man sneered and began muttering something Long Chen couldn’t understand. He once more sent out a punch.

However, this time, the tailed man’s arm exploded and blood mist flew out. He was actually a solid body.

The tailed man let out a miserable cry. Only at this moment did Long Chen see countless barbs on the chains that were pulling out that tailed man’s flesh. Those barbs were like teeth.

The tailed man turned to flee back to the gate he had come out of. Unfortunately, he had just gotten there when the monstrosity’s chain explosively grew. It smashed through the tailed man’s body, causing him to scream.

His body then rapidly withered until he was nothing more than dust. The monstrosity returned to its original appearance, but now it went to another orb. Its chain had a dozen drops of essence blood that dripped onto the orb.

“Damn, so it’s gathering essence blood.” Long Chen was startled. This thing was gathering souls and essence blood at the same time. Just what was it doing?

At this moment, Qu Jianying walked out of the place she was hiding and crept forward, carefully going past the monstrosity.

It completely ignored her, and she continued onward. The bridge was very long, and she encountered over ten of them that she carefully went around.

After an unknown amount of time, a blood-colored pool appeared ahead. Dense mist swirled out of it and into the sky
