Chapter 4060 Devouring the Life Crystal

“If you can help me remove my bindings and leave this damnable place, I will be your guard for a lifetime!” implored the elder of the Undying Dragon Tree race.

In this place, he was nothing more than a slave to the Nether Emperor. He had no freedom at all. Having guarded this damn place for millions of years, he was about to go crazy.

Therefore, Long Chen’s condition wasn’t even worth mentioning. After all, Long Chen was already an Immortal King. According to this elder’s standard, in the blink of an eye, Long Chen would become a World King.

Moreover, as long as he could leave this place, he was willing to accept any conditions at all. As an Undying Dragon Tree, being trapped in the heavenly river was torture. The laws of this place were constantly eroding his body.

After so many years, all he could do was preserve his cultivation base. Just managing to prevent his power from regressing was already an enormous fortune to him.

“No need. Once I have the power to protect myself, you can return to the Undying World. You can also help me send word to the Undying Willow race. Help me ask where a friend- no, where two friends are.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen had a feeling that Liu Ruyan and Chu Yao were together. After all, the two of them never left each other. If Liu Ruyan had returned to the Corpse Devil Demon Forest, she would definitely have brought Chu Yao.

“Prepare yourself. It might be a bit painful, so you must endure.” Long Chen took a deep breath and once more tore off his eyepatch.

Buzz.

The moment Long Chen opened his left eye, the hell flower once more appeared. This time, Long Chen used his pupil art to activate the hell flower, and a terrifying death energy erupted.

The hell flower mark on the altar then lit up. At the same time, strange lines also appeared on the elder’s body.

The elder couldn’t help but scream in pain, his whole body quivering. However, if this was his price of freedom, he would endure it without complaint.

As the entire fiend eye quivered, some kind of black energy formed ripples of death that converged into Long Chen’s Purgatory Eyes.

Just like that, blood ran out of his left eye once more, and it was even more painful than the last. However, Long Chen wasn’t afraid. He knew that absorbing this energy would strengthen the Purgatory Eyes. It wasn’t a bad thing for him.

As long as he could endure, the Purgatory Eyes would grow stronger. On the other hand, the elder was almost convulsing on the ground, feeling like his soul was being stripped out of his body. However, he bitterly endured and held back his screams.

He knew that Long Chen had to be enduring a similar pain to him. Also, as a member of the Undying Dragon Tree race, he had his own pride. He couldn’t be lacking compared to a member of the junior generation.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the entire fiend eye shook one final time, and endless black energy poured into Long Chen’s left eye.

When it was done, Long Chen hastily shut his left eye. Half of his face was now covered in blood, looking like it was stained by black spiderwebs.

Intense fiery pain pierced his eye, as though his eyeball might break. The pain also extended to half of his head, creating a sensation as if it was about to explode.

“Master, are you alright?!” The elder urgently ran over to Long Chen.

At this time, the elder’s face was no longer scrunched in pain. Instead, he was beaming gratefully. Long Chen really had managed to remove the Nether Emperor’s seal on this elder, so he had finally escaped his shackles and regained his freedom.

“You don’t need to call me master. There’s no need to be so courteous. You can just call me Long Chen.” It was only after a bit that Long Chen recovered enough to reply.

“How can that be? You are my greatest benefactor, and I will never be able to repay you in this lifetime. You want me to be your guard? Then during this time, you are my master. My Undying Dragon Tree race cannot be known as ingrates who do not repay kindness,” said the elder solemnly.

The Undying Dragon Tree race. They were a famous race within the Undying World, and they cared a great deal about their reputation.

After receiving such favor from Long Chen, this elder was full of gratitude. Thus, he was determined to protect Long Chen to death during this time.

At this time, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others also ran over. As for Yu Qingxuan, she was aggrieved to see Long Chen in such pain, but she didn’t say anything. She only fed him a healing pill to alleviate the pain.

After consuming the pill, Long Chen could feel the pain fading quite a bit. The elder then said, “Master, do you really want to take this life crystal? If you take it, the fiend eye will crumble and the Nether servants may come to hunt you down.”

“Senior, in order to make it easier in the future, I’ll just call you Uncle Tree, alright? Uncle Tree, this life energy is very useful to me. I must take it. As for the rest, I don’t care that much. So, please guard me while I take it.”

Long Chen then went to the life tree. After he formed hand seals, the void quivered and a bronze cauldron appeared.

The Earth Cauldron had always been like a dead object, so Long Chen was only capable of using it to smash people and defend. However, when it appeared today, countless runes quivered on its body as if it had come to life.

It was automatically drawn to the giant life crystal, and in an instant, the enormous amount of life energy within the crystal vanished.

It had to be known that this elder had spent countless years absorbing life energy. This meant that the lives of trillions and trillions of experts were absorbed in a second.

After absorbing the life crystal, quite a bit of rust fell from the cauldron, and the portions that were free from rust began to emit a strange shine. Through this light, it was possible to see its profound runes.

“All of this life energy only allowed a third of its rust to fall? Sigh, I guess awakening it will need at least two more of these life crystals!” Long Chen couldn’t help being shocked. The Heaven Earth Cauldron was truly worthy of being a primal chaos divine item. Fully restoring it would take some effort.

From the area without the rust, Long Chen could feel a slight spiritual connection. “This is…!”

“Yes, you now have the power to use it,” said the dragon expert.

“Really? Then can I use it to suppress Heaven Venerates?” asked Long Chen excitedly.

“Yes, in theory.”

“What does that mean? In reality, I…?”

“I said that you could use it, not drawing out its full power. You misunderstand. It is the Earth Cauldron of the Heaven Earth Cauldron, and it is not a fighting weapon. Its focus is on defense. Anyway, you are too weak to activate even a single one of its runes, let alone activate its actual defensive might,” said the dragon expert.

“Then doesn’t that mean that I can’t use it?” demanded Long Chen, his excitement extinguishing.

“You can’t use it in combat. But you can use it for other purposes.”

“Like what?”

“For example, refining pills.”

“What?!”

Long Chen was instantly revitalized.
