Chapter 5041 A Marker

“Patriarch!”

When the Long clan patriarch attacked, Long Qianxue and the Heaven Overseer cried out. They hadn’t expected the patriarch to directly attack to kill without asking any questions.

Under the pressure of a three-vein Heaven Saint’s pressure, Long Chen couldn’t move. He could only watch as this attack came toward him. This sudden change startled Feng Fei and Jiang Wuwang.

Long Chen’s power was absolutely terrifying. Before this, it could be excused that the Long clan didn’t know how strong Long Chen was. However, the patriarch had already seen everything through Long Qianxue’s memories, yet he still wanted to kill Long Chen.

With Long Chen’s potential, no matter what faction he joined or how grave of a mistake he made, no one would be willing to kill such a genius.

Furthermore, Long Chen had not done anything wrong. Was he supposed to not fight back when someone tried to kill him? The Long clan had taken such heavy losses, and killing Long Chen was absolutely meaningless.

The most correct choice right now was to place all the blame on the dead people and ask for Long Chen’s forgiveness. The patriarch should have stood by Long Chen’s side, understanding and comforting him from his viewpoint.

That was perhaps the only way to bring Long Chen’s heart back to the Long clan. Although the higher-ups had been annihilated, with pillars like Long Chen and Long Tianrui, what would the Long clan need to fear?

After all, Long Chen hadn’t reached his peak yet. If he became an Eternal expert, not even a three-vein Heaven Saint would be a match for him.

Hence, the patriarch’s immediate attack was bewildering. Even the Heaven Overseer couldn’t comprehend this. It wasn’t an action taken in the Long clan’s best interests.

BOOM!

Before anyone could react, the patriarch’s palm slammed into Long Chen’s chest. At that moment, a barrier formed around Long Chen. This barrier took the shape of an ancient bronze cauldron, adorned with the sun, moon, and stars. The world within it exuded a sacred aura.

The patriarch’s attack was blocked by this barrier, barely causing it to quiver.

The Earth Cauldron had finally intervened, effortlessly absorbing the patriarch’s attack. The patriarch’s expression instantly changed. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Just then, a hand reached out through the barrier. A seven-color cross lit up on it, and it smacked the patriarch in the face.

With an explosive sound, blood flew through the air as half of the patriarch’s face exploded.

“What?!”

Gasps filled the air as Long Chen revealed yet another trump card. When the patriarch stabilized his footing, everyone was shocked to see half the skin on his face was gone, and a seven-color cross was branded on it. Meanwhile, the patriarch was still dazed from the sudden slap.

Long Chen’s voice cut through the tense silence, cold and biting, “As a member of the Long clan, the blood of the Long clan runs in my veins. Hence, a portion of those resources rightfully belong to me, as those are what my ancestors left me. So, I returned to claim what is mine, and I owe no debts to the Long clan. But deep down, I hoped for the Long clan to treat me well. After all, we are one family. I also thought about repaying the Long clan, but what did I get? Schemes, betrayal, and attempts to barter my life for treasures. Your greed drove you to offer me as a sacrificial pawn to the Brahma Pill Valley. If I fell into their hands, my life would be worse than death. The Long clan really treats me well.”

Each word from Long Chen dripped with icy resolve, sending shivers through those who listened. Every single one of them could sense his bloodthirsty hatred.

“Even the patriarch of the Long clan, supposed to be its guiding beacon, chose not to seek truth or justice before attacking me. It wasn’t out of hatred but fear and greed. Your anger is a facade, driven by the desire to seize my treasures and use my death as a bargaining chip with the Brahma Pill Valley. With their support and my treasures, you think to defy even my father, don’t you?” Long Chen’s gaze pierced the patriarch with unyielding disdain.

He continued, “After fighting repeatedly, I’m exhausted. I won’t kill you now, but mark my words. The mark on your face will never disappear, unless you cut off your head. I, Long Chen, am no saint. It’s the opposite. Once I reach the Eternal realm, I will come back and personally take your head. Make sure to look after it well. Though, if my father comes back first and learns how you’ve treated his son, I may not need to lift a finger then.”

The patriarch’s emotions twisted visibly in response to Long Chen’s words. All his thoughts were spoken out loud by Long Chen.

At first, the patriarch had been very angry. However, when he learned that one of the ten great primal chaos divine items was sitting in the Long clan’s underground treasury, his greed erupted out of control. His goal became securing the Earth Cauldron, even if it meant sacrificing the Long clan. Thus, he quickly tried to kill Long Chen, but he ultimately failed.

Long Chen brushed the dust from his chest and straightened his torn robes. Turning to face Long Tianrui, Feng Fei, Jiang Wuwang, the Heaven Overseer, Long Qianxue, and the others, he spoke calmly.

“Everyone, until we meet again. Hopefully next time, it will be over drinks instead of weapons. Farewell.” With that, Long Chen’s figure swiftly faded from view.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” The patriarch’s voice thundered as he thrust his sword into an empty space.

The void tore open, revealing a giant spatial hole. Within its swirling fragments, a pitch-black world emerged—a sinister abyss that seemed to devour everything in its path. Seeing it, people scrambled back in fright.

The patriarch’s attack was truly terrifying, showing people just how strong a three-vein Heaven Saint was. But now matter how strong he was, it was meaningless as the Earth Cauldron had brought Long Chen away.

The patriarch seethed with rage, his face contorted in fury, yet he felt utterly powerless. Long Tianrui regarded him with cold indifference.

“The Long clan has already declined. Even a stupid donkey can be a patriarch,” she remarked flatly.

“What did you say?!” roared the patriarch.

Long Tianrui remained expressionless. “Are your ears failing you?”

“You...!” The patriarch pointed his sword toward Long Tianrui.

“You couldn’t kill Long Chen, and you can’t touch me either. You may be the Long clan’s patriarch, but you are nothing in front of me. Know your place!” she stated coolly before turning away and walking out of the Heavenly Desolation Domain.

The Heaven Overseer was shocked. “Tianrui, what are you doing?”

“Is there any reason to remain in a clan led by such an idiot? Should I become foolish like him? I’m heading to the depths of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven to seek out other legacies of the Long clan.”

With those words, Long Tianrui vanished from sight, leaving everyone standing in stunned silence.
