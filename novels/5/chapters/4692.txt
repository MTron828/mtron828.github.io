Chapter 4681 The Warrior of the Starry Sky Appears

A giant mouth devoured everyone in the tribulation, its size so big it seemed capable of engulfing the entire world. Long Chen and the others were caught off guard, unable to react before being swallowed whole.

As the jaws sealed shut, people saw a monstrous whale head. It was so huge that it didn’t even fit in this world. Only its head was visible, and the rest of it was hidden above the dome of the heavens.

Guo Ran and the others were shocked as this whale was identical to the sea whale corpse that they had encountered before.

However, now it was alive and instantly devoured everyone. Countless runes lit up throughout it, causing the original light of the world to fade away and the desolate qi to unfurl.

Seeing Long Chen, the nine star heir, and the others vanish at once, Guo Ran and the others instantly paled. No one had expected a lifeform that only existed in stories to manifest itself in Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation.

BOOM!

The whale’s head exploded, and Long Chen and the others surged forth amid the explosion of lightning runes.

The moment they were devoured, they felt an unprecedented pressure crash down on them, so they had to work together to resist the whale.

All the experts within the tribulation joined forces, blasting apart the whale’s head. They had no idea what had happened, or what had devoured them.

Suddenly, they heard an explosive sound, and a hand covered in stars grabbed the whale’s back. While the whale was enormous, that hand was equally huge. The fingers were like claws digging into the whale’s body, tearing it apart. Seeing this spectacle, Long Chen and the Dragonblood warriors let out startled cries because it was all too familiar to them.

Meanwhile, Luo Changsheng and the others had never seen such a thing before, so they could only stand in silence. Being so close, they couldn’t see the whale’s full form, but even if they did, they wouldn’t recognize it.

The terrifying sea whale now quivered in trepidation as another astral hand appeared. With a swift motion, the giant whale’s spine was ripped out.[1]

The sea whale’s enormous body then exploded, transforming into an explosion of lightning runes resembling a glorious firework.

BOOM!

While everyone else was stunned by this terrifying scene, the nine star heir didn’t care and attacked Long Chen once more. Caught off guard, Long Chen was struck and sent flying, blood spraying from his mouth.

Just then, the sea whale’s spine whipped toward Long Chen. However, it was so huge and unimaginably long that it covered the entire tribulation area.

“Fuck, now it’s really dangerous!” Cold sweat dripped down Long Chen’s back as he saw the chaos. The heavenly tribulation had gone as far as replicating the formidable Warrior of the Starry Sky. It seemed to want to kill him at all costs.

Just then, the nine star heir charged at Long Chen, completely ignoring the whale spine.

“If that’s the case, don’t blame me for playing dirty!” Seeing the nine star heir attacking at this time, Long Chen clenched his teeth.

At first, Long Chen had thought that he could have a fair battle with the Sovereign clan expert, but then the nine star heir appeared. And just as he thought that the battle with the nine star heir was the ultimate test, the Warrior of the Starry Sky appeared. Well, if the heavens refused to play fair, he wouldn’t either.

At this moment, the whale spine crashed down, horrifying Luo Changsheng and the others. They had no idea what was happening, but they knew they would die if they didn’t go all-out.

BOOM!

Everyone within the tribulation unleashed their full power to defend, but they still tumbled back miserably.

Luo Changsheng coughed up blood, his golden bone claw above him losing its luster. Despite his condition, he fared better than the others. In a devastating turn of events, over a hundred of these heavenly geniuses had been obliterated in an instant.

The whale spine smashed the Saint weapons along with their wielders apart. None of the spectators would forget that terrifying sight for the rest of their lives.

Outside of the tribulation, mournful screams erupted as countless experts saw the hopes of their races turn to dust. It felt like the heavens were collapsing on them.

The momentum of the whale spine didn’t slow down even after sending Luo Changsheng and the others flying. It headed straight for Long Chen.

Engaged in combat with the nine star heir, Long Chen suddenly crossed his arms in front of him as the spine descended. It was the first time he had taken a defensive posture since the tribulation started.

Reacting on instinct, the nine star heir unleashed a powerful blow toward Long Chen’s crossed arms. The impact sent Long Chen hurtling backward, while the nine star heir staggered back a few steps.

As a result, the whale spine crashed directly into the nine star heir. An ear-piercing explosion reverberated through the world as the nine star heir exploded into lightning runes.

Seeing that, Long Chen sucked in a cold gasp of air. That attack was terrifying, and no one in his realm could possibly block it. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“How despicable!” Long Chen cursed furiously. Of course, he was cursing the heavens, not himself. An attack on this level could break the laws of heavenly tribulation. In other words, it was simply impossible to defend.

After swinging through the air, the whale spine rapidly shrank and condensed into the hand of a large man. He stood bare-chested, his hair flowing freely around his head. Moreover, his copper skin bore intricate markings resembling starry chains that exuded a mysterious and profound aura.

This person was the Warrior of the Starry Sky that Long Chen had freed on the Ghost Ship. However, he had reappeared as an enemy. When the whale spine shrank, its pressure grew to a shocking level, causing even these monstrous geniuses to feel despair.

“What the fuck is this?! Long Chen, how did you provoke something like this?!” Within the tribulation, those heavenly geniuses howled with terror and despair. Even they felt as insignificant as ants in front of the Warrior of the Starry Sky.

“What are you talking about? Didn’t you say that you were the sons of the heavens? Heavenly Doyens like yourselves won’t be killed by heavenly tribulation, right? Now is your chance to prove it! Don’t worry, I won’t fight you for that chance!” said Long Chen.

Just then, the void exploded. The Warrior of the Starry Sky shook, and the whale spine thrust toward Long Chen like a sword.
