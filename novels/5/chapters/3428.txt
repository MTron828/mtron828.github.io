Chapter 3417 The Nine Star Line’s Mission

Three World Kings had come at once, and they gave off powerful auras, especially their leader, an elder with a beard thicker than his sparse hair. His pressure made it difficult for others to even breathe.

They weren’t intentionally unleashing their powerful pressures. However, their natural auras simply caused the entire plaza to become grave and solemn.

Their arrival caused an uproar as some experts recognized their status. They were the master and assistant masters of the Sacred Pill Hall.

Although the three of them rarely appeared, due to some powers having close relationships with the Sacred Pill Hall, they still recognized the three of them.

The powerful forces like the Lightning Falcon race, Water Mallard race, Mammoth Divine Elephant race, and others would implore their disciples not to provoke the three of them no matter what.

If they provoked others, then due to their backgrounds, even the Sacred Pill Hall would give them face.

But if they provoked the three of them, then there would be no face to talk of. Their seniors needed them to know who they could provoke and who they couldn’t.

Since all three of them had appeared, that alone signified just how big this matter was. After a moment of shock, the entire plaza fell silent.

The hall master’s gaze swept across the ground, and he seemed to be very satisfied with this result. However, when his gaze fell on the person beside Lei Yuner, Long Chen, he paused slightly. Lei Yuner was leaning on Long Chen, and her arms were wrapped around his elbow, appearing very intimate. But for some reason, he had a strange feeling when he looked at Long Chen.

However, there were important matters for him to announce right now, so he didn’t pay much attention to Long Chen.

“My Sacred Pill Hall is borrowing the opening of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm to announce a major matter. Everyone knows that the Divine Lord Immortal Realm was made by my Sacred Pill Hall. Recently, Divine Venerate Brahma even lent his power to draw out the core of an entire star-field to create a world core for the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. This core allows people to not only advance perfectly but also absorb the karmic luck of heaven and earth. For the demonic beast race in particular, advancing here will turn you into the favorites of heaven and earth, allowing you to be favored by the Heavenly Daos just like the human race…”

Hearing this, the demonic beasts were all excited. While the demonic beast race looked down on the human race, they also envied the human race in one aspect. That was that the human race had more support from the Heavenly Daos.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The core of the star-field could change the fate of the entire demonic beast race. Furthermore, once they obtained the approval of the Heavenly Daos, their bloodline would also change. This change could very likely allow their bloodline runes to be passed down to future generations as well. Thus, all the major powers were eyeing this world core.

The hall master continued, “My Sacred Pill Hall has paid an immense price, both financially and in terms of manpower. But that doesn’t count for anything. We are only the Divine Venerate’s servants. Divine Venerate Brahma cares about all living things and wishes all living beings to live equally. Even as part of the human race, he believes in equality between races. The heavens belong to all races. Everyone, I ask that we say a prayer for Divine Venerate Brahma’s blessings.”

After that, the void rumbled and a huge statue appeared in the sky. It shone brightly, enveloping the plaza with divine light.

When the statue of Lord Brahma appeared, everyone in the plaza immediately closed their eyes and pressed their hands together in prayer, murmuring something.

In order to not appear conspicuous, Long Chen also closed his eyes and pressed his hands together. He asked the nine star heir, “Is there anything I can do to help you?”

“You can live a proper life and accomplish the mission of our nine star line. Then even if I had to die ten thousand times, it would be worth it,” replied the nine star heir.

“What is that mission?” asked Long Chen.

After a moment of hesitation, the nine star heir said, “Once you condense the ninth star, you will know.”

“Can you show me your cultivation technique? Due to relying entirely on myself, I cultivated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art down a different path. I’m not sure if I’ve cultivated it properly,” said Long Chen.

“How can that be?!”

Using his Spiritual Strength, Long Chen showed him the formation of his six stars. After looking at that, the nine star heir gasped. “No wonder you haven’t been noticed yet. You deviated from the original path at the Five Star Battle Armor.”

The nine star heir displayed his own star diagram to Long Chen. The first four stars were the same, but it was different starting from the fifth star. His power also started from the FengFu Star and formed a perfect circle. By the time his seventh star condensed, it was almost a perfect match for his divine ring. It perfectly merged his power.

Long Chen’s heart turned cold. It seemed that he had truly gone down the wrong path. Furthermore, he had gone down way too far and couldn’t go back.

Hearing the story about how Long Chen had gone off a different path, that nine star heir comforted him. “Don’t be afraid. Although you’ve gone down the wrong path, your aura is still powerful. It might even be stronger than mine in that realm. This might be why you are able to dodge the noses of the Nine Star Hunters. Who can say whether this is a good thing or not? You must persevere down this path. We nine star heirs have been viewed as prey for trillions of years. Perhaps this fate will finally be reversed by you. Perhaps it is precisely due to our trillions of years of failure that a variant like you was born. Brother, I really am excited about your future. You must live well. Flip the heavens! Avenge our fallen brothers!”

This nine star heir grew emotional. It seemed that he was finally seeing another future, a future with light.

“Everyone, do you know who this convict is? I will tell you. He is a successor to the most wicked, most bloodthirsty, most hated existence within the nine heavens and ten lands, the nine star line.”

Just as Long Chen and the nine star heir were talking, the hall master’s voice once more resounded through the air.

Startled cries rang out. The name of nine star heirs was known to everyone. Legend had it that they were natural warriors, existences that were unrivaled within the same realm.

However, these people had only heard of them and had never seen one. Looking at the nine star heir, sensing his terrifying aura, they were shocked. As expected of a warrior with such a reputation.

“No wonder he emits such terrifying pressure. So he’s a legendary nine star heir. Even after all his blood has run dry, he’s so terrifying. If he was in his peak condition, he would be even more terrifying,” said Lei Yuner in shock.

The existence of a nine star heir was like a rock unleashing thousands of ripples. Everyone was stunned. Nine star heirs were all mysterious and absolutely terrifying.

The hall master then pointed at the nine star heir. With an expression of disgust, he announced, “Do you know why this person, despite clearly possessing the body of the human race, has such a terrifying physical body?”

Hearing that, Long Chen’s anger flared. He could already guess what the hall master’s next words would be.
