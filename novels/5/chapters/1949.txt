Chapter 1939: 1939

Long Chen suddenly flew over to the healing warriors . A lightning spear appeared in his hand, and with a wave, he blew apart the lighting rain, turning it into lightning mist .

“Boss!”

“I’ll block the lightning rain for you, so absorb as much of the lightning mist as you can . This relates to your foundation in the future,” said Long Chen .

A person’s astral space could continuously grow during this tribulation . But once the lightning tribulation vanished, their astral spaces would solidify .

Their future advancements would increase the sizes of their astral spaces based on the size after the tribulation . Based on normal cultivation standards, each Heavenstage of the Life Star realm would increase the size of the astral space by thirty percent .

If a person’s astral space was thirty miles wide after breaking through, it would be almost forty after advancing to the first Heavenstage . At the second Heavenstage, it would once more grow by thirty percent .

That was why the initial size of the astral space would decide how large it could grow in the future . This would greatly affect their power . This was their chance to get as strong as possible .

“Don’t worry, I’ll protect you!” Guo Ran immediately came over, saying that he was helping when he was trying to escape his predicament .

Long Chen couldn’t be bothered anymore with this shameless fellow . What was to be feared was not someone who was willing to throw their life away, but someone who was shameless . Guo Ran was already unrivaled in that regard .

Using the physical body to endure the lightning tribulation was a way to temper the will . As for using divine lightning, just how rare was that opportunity? But Guo Ran didn’t cherish it in the slightest . However, Long Chen supposed that everyone had their own path .

“If anyone else is unable to endure it, you can come over,” announced Long Chen . He needed to help the healing warriors right now and could no longer be looking after them .

Fortunately, not everyone was like Guo Ran . They knew that this was an opportunity, a stroke of good fortune, a chance to get stronger .

This opportunity was something that Long Chen had created for them . From the Eastern Wasteland, Long Chen had started training them, and the effects of the heavenly tribulation could not be neglected . They cherished this opportunity .

They clenched their teeth and bitterly endured . They absorbed the divine lightning and used it to cleanse their bodies of impurities .

Seeing the Dragonblood warriors enduring through this divine lightning, one of the original devil race’s experts sighed, “Who knows how difficult it was for the Dragonblood Legion to become the number one legion of the Martial Heaven Continent? They had to have experienced something like this more than once . Their accomplishments are no coincidence . These children are truly ruthless . ”

“Being ruthless to oneself is better than being consumed by others . If you want to live with dignity, you have to pay more than others,” said Yue Xihan .

“I wonder how large the astral space of the sacred daughter will become?”

“There’s no way to say . However, being expanded by divine lightning will definitely make it larger than ours . ” Yue Xihan smiled . Yue Xiaoqian was her daughter and her pride, as well as the hope of the original devil race .

Yue Xiaoqian was standing at the front, enduring the most divine lightning . She was covered in blood, but there was a determined light in her eyes . Yue Xiaoqian smiled proudly as well as sorrowfully . If this was a peaceful world, Yue Xiaoqian would still be an innocent child living a carefree life .

However, this world was not peaceful . The original devil race in particular was in a very precarious position . They might be destroyed at any moment . When Yue Xiaoqian was young, she was very obedient and worked hard on her cultivation .

Behind her growth and maturity was the fact that she had taken up a heavy burden at a young age . Yue Xihan felt sorry for her .

Eventually, the tribulation clouds began to shudder and Yue Xihan sighed with relief . That indicated that the tribulation was coming to an end .

“Xiaoqian, attack the tribulation again,” said Long Chen .

Yue Xiaoqian didn’t hesitate . A streak of Sword Qi tore through the sky .

Suddenly, the clouds tore open, and a giant thunderbolt crashed down from that tear at Yue Xiaoqian .

Yue Xiaoqian’s hair stood on end as a sensation of death enveloped her .

BOOM!

A lightning spear struck the giant thunderbolt, filling the air with blinding light .

Long Chen now held a lightning spear, and after shattering the thunderbolt, lightning runes fell amongst the Dragonblood warriors . The Dragonblood warriors were delighted to find that these lightning runes were ten times larger than the previous ones and many times purer .

“Boss, this is amazing!” Absorbing these lightning runes, they felt their astral spaces rapidly growing . They practically doubled in size .

Their delight dumbfounded Yue Xihan and the others . Were they actually forcing the heavenly tribulation to stay behind? They had never seen such brazenness .

The void continued to tear apart, and the lightning transformed into giant spears that pierced down upon the Dragonblood Legion .

Long Chen stood in the air, with a lightning spear and lightning wings, breaking apart the rain of lightning .

“The azure dragon power is truly amazing . It was worth risking my life for it . ” Long Chen was experiencing the immense power of the azure dragon . The same paragon arts were now even more terrifying with it .

All of Lei Long’s energy was concentrated within the spear and wings . As Lei Long absorbed more thunderforce, its power also grew .

The Dragonblood warriors down below were crazy with joy as they absorbed the lightning runes . This was a completely safe, quick, and painless way of getting stronger .

“Being with boss is a fucking blessing . ” Gu Yang felt like he might cry from joy . The feeling of his strength rapidly growing like this was amazing .

Their astral spaces were growing rapidly as they absorbed the lightning runes . The most excited one was Yue Xiaoqian . There had been a shadow left in her heart from almost dying during her tribulation in the Immemorial Path . However, she had now attacked the lightning tribulation repeatedly and didn’t need to fear it .

This was another reason why Long Chen had made her attack the tribulation . It was for her to overcome this heart-devil .

The lightning spears raining down from the sky were like the fury of the heavens, causing the world to shake . However, Long Chen had his own lightning spear that blocked all of them .

Suddenly, one of the healing warriors coughed up a mouthful of blood . Cracks appeared all over her body in a horrifying fashion . She herself was also startled, not knowing what was going on .

“You’ve reached your limit . Go rest, and don’t absorb any more thunderforce,” warned Long Chen .

In the end, people had limits, and she had reached hers . In the next incense stick’s worth of time, more and more Dragonblood warriors reached their limit . Some who still wanted to absorb more were shouted away by Long Chen .

A limit was a limit . Any more and their bodies would explode .

More and more Dragonblood warriors were forced to retreat . In the end, only the strongest experts were left .

Meng Qi reached her limit first amongst the top experts . That was already a miracle . As a Beast Tamer, she hadn’t expected to be able to last this long .

Others also reached their limit right after her . The one to last the longest was Liu Ruyan, but she also reached a limit . This tribulation had been a stunning success . Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The fury of the heavens was gradually fading . However, just at that moment, Long Chen suddenly soared into the clouds .

“Break!”

Long Chen replaced his lightning spear with Evilmoon . A pitch-black saber-image tore through heaven and earth . The giant tribulation clouds were split in two .

“Damnable heavens, how do you like it?!” sneered Long Chen .

“Has he gone mad?!” Yue Xihan covered her mouth .

BOOM!

The tribulation clouds suddenly merged back fiercely . Booming noises rang out as if the world was roaring .

Suddenly, giant lightning beasts began flying out of the tribulation clouds . They were of various forms, but were all lifelike . Their power caused the world to shake as if the world couldn’t contain their power .

Long Chen formed hand seals, and Lei Long appeared behind him . However, suddenly Long Chen became startled as he noticed that Lei Long didn’t want to cooperate with him .

“Lei Long, stop making a fuss . You can’t eat that much anyway,” said Long Chen . Surprisingly, Lei Long didn’t want to open the spatial channel . It wanted to consume these lightning beasts itself .

Ignoring whether or not it could even absorb that much, that the tribulation was reaching its end . It would quickly dissipate, so it didn’t have time to devour them .

Although it was unwilling, Lei Long was very obedient . Its body spun through the air, forming a spatial channel .

Giant lightning drakes came flying out of that channel . Upon seeing the powerful lightning beasts of the tribulation, their eyes turned red .

“Don’t say that I’m not loyal . Today, I’ll treat you to a feast,” laughed Long Chen .
