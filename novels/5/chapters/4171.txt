Chapter 4160: High Level Show Off

There was a cut in the void that didn’t heal for a long time. As for the demonic beast expert’s corpse, it slowly split open, this scene stunning everyone.

The demonic beast expert had been concealing his true power as a Triple Supreme. That was shocking enough. But compared to Yu Yong’s final strike, that was nothing. A Triple Supreme was slain by a Double Supreme and in just one blow without any resistance!

“Sword cultivator!”

A startled cry rang out. That sword moved the heavens, and the icy will of the Sword Dao remained. Perhaps only such a will could cause even the self-recovery ability of the world to lose effect.

“Fool. If you hadn’t held back, we could have managed to fight for a while. Unfortunately, you’re too foolish.” Yu Yong shook his head and walked back to the Dragonblood Legion.

After all, Yu Yong belonged to the fourth regiment led by Yue Zifeng. All the fourth regiment’s warriors had been in contact with Yue Zifeng the longest, and Yue Zifeng naturally didn’t hold back when teaching them.

Thus, all the fourth regiment’s warriors would be considered masters of the Sword Dao in the outside world. Although they couldn’t compare to Yue Zifeng, when they attacked, Yue Zifeng’s shadow could be seen behind them.

Moreover, every Dragonblood warrior had managed to crawl out of a pile of corpses. Their combat experience was gained through blood and sacrifice.

So, that demonic beast expert had purely been courting death by fighting Yu Yong at close range. If it wasn’t to force him to break his disguise, Yu Yong would have killed him with a blow.

However, if that person had truly gone all-out without concealing his power from the very beginning, then victory or defeat might have been difficult to say.

Even if that person couldn’t beat Yu Yong, he would have had a ninety percent chance of escaping intact. But unfortunately, his attempt at disguising himself as a pig to eat the tiger failed, and his life was lost.

“You’ve regressed. Killing a little Triple Supreme, and one that was concealing his power, actually took you that long? What a disgrace. As punishment, go into seclusion for three days when we get back,” chided Guo Ran darkly.

Yu Yong was startled. Wasn't it only because he had sought to unveil that person's true strength that it had taken him so long to eliminate him? Otherwise, it would have been simple, no?

However, he then saw Guo Ran wink at him and instantly understood. Guo Ran was trying to show off. Thus, Yu Yong hastily put on an act of fear and trepidation.

“General, please punish me. Lately, my cultivation has stalled due to dealing with troublesome affairs. I should have been able to finish it within three moves. Taking so long has lost the face of the Dragonblood Legion. I fully accept my punishment.”

“Hmph, at least, your attitude isn’t bad. You know your wrongs and that you must change. Within the Dragonblood Legion, your rank is five thousand seven hundred and six. You should start feeling some sense of urgency,” said Guo Ran.

“Yes, I will definitely work hard! Next month, I will get into the top five thousand and seven hundred!” declared Yu Yong.

The two of them played off of each other’s sentences, leaving everyone stunned. Even Long Chen, who thought that his face was thick enough, was unable to keep his expression completely natural. This fellow was bragging a bit too hard, wasn’t he? Since when did the Dragonblood Legion have such a ranking? Why didn’t he know of it?

Furthermore, with one strictly chiding and one solemnly quivering, it truly did look real. Even Long Chen almost believed it.

“In the future, I’ll have to limit Guo Ran’s authority. Otherwise, who knows what the Dragonblood warriors will be dragged into by him? What if all of them just become a bunch of show-offs? How am I supposed to lead such a group?”

However, their conversation truly did cause the humans and demonic beasts present to jump in shock. After that one slash of the sword, the others stopped fighting and returned to their own camps.

It was like a group of wolves were fighting when a tiger suddenly came and threw the battlefield into chaos. They were no longer interested in fighting.

The most difficult thing for them to bear was that such a terrifying expert like Yu Yong was actually ranked below five thousand and seven hundred in the Dragonblood Legion. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Perhaps it was because this bragging had gone too far, when people looked at Long Chen and the others, their expressions were doubting. But they didn’t dare to bring up their suspicions.

“I’m sorry, boss. I know that this isn’t your usual low-key style. But I feel like now isn’t the time to be low-key. Only absolute martial power can reduce the amount of trouble we have to deal with. Only by displaying absolute power can we live with dignity and respect,” said Guo Ran solemnly.

So, he was even dragging Long Chen into this as well. What could he possibly say? Long Chen simply nodded. “The general’s words are correct.”

At the side, Yu Qingxuan almost burst into laughter. These fellows really were a bunch of clowns.

Long Chen said, “The human race is not afraid of anyone. Our advantage is our brains. Regretfully, many people don’t use their heads and are tricked into milling around frantically. To lose their lives and still be mocked is the greatest humiliation.”

This little speech shamed countless human experts. They simply hadn’t expected the demonic beast race to be so sinister.

Although people had suspected that demonic beast expert and raised those suspicions, the majority of people only believed their own eyes. Perhaps it was precisely because they believed in themselves too much that quite a few people were easily conned to death by that demonic beast expert.

Long Chen turned to the demonic beast race’s experts and coldly said, “Human race, demonic beast race, it doesn’t matter if you want to be a person or a demon, but you need to have a bottom line. If you have the ability, use it properly. Conning and scheming ultimately cannot be the true Dao. Furthermore, if you really wanted to play sinister games, did you think that your little bit of intelligence would allow you to compete with the human race?”

“There’s naturally no way for us to compare to the human race. Your human race is the most treacherous of all races. Our demonic beast race accepts our inferiority in this regard,” sneered a demonic beast race.

He was clearly cursing the human race for being sinister, as if he was saying he disdained talking principles with humans.

“No, there’s no need to accept your inferiority. When it comes to treachery and craftiness, isn’t dressing like a pig to eat a tiger something you did quite happily just now? I’m just warning you, what you’re playing with is just some leftovers of the human race. Don’t shame yourselves by bringing out such trash,” said Long Chen lightly.

Such a worthless thing could only trick a few hot-blooded youngsters who didn’t use their brains. If there were any elders here, the human race wouldn’t have been tricked like this.

This place was full of youngsters. After all, both sides had just started competing, and the senior generation had yet to receive word of it.

“Who do you think you are to speak to the demonic beast race like that? Who do you think you’re chiding? Hmph, you’re only capable of showing off here. Once our true experts come, let’s see if you still dare to act so arrogant!” shouted one demonic beast expert.

Long Chen smiled and ignored that person. They clearly didn’t dare to challenge Long Chen, so they could only say some tough words. In truth, it was to cover up their lack of confidence.

“Out of the way! Get out of my way!”

Suddenly, they heard a thunderous roar. From the human race’s side, dozens of people came rushing over. All of them had vast auras like a sea, causing everyone to jump.

Their leader was a Heaven Venerate elder, and this elder immediately came to Long Chen and bowed.

“Senior Long Chen, it really is you! Please accept this disciple’s respect!”
