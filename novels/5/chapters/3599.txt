Chapter 3588

In the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College and perhaps even in the entire Alldevil Star-Field, all the martial stages were gigantic. A sect could normally only have one.

That was because these cultivators were all fully equipped. Once a fight started, there was mass destruction. If the martial stage wasn’t sturdy enough, it would be all too easy to affect the area outside.

Moreover, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s martial stage was made with the best materials. Those materials were normally used to test the destructive power of battle armors.

A martial stage made out of such materials couldn’t possibly be easy to break. Furthermore, it was rather easy to repair. Unfortunately, those materials were very expensive and only produced in the Alldevil Star-Field. The outside world almost never got a chance to see them.

This martial stage looked to only be a few dozen miles wide. But with the formation supporting it, its true size was thousands of miles.

At this time, there was already a sea of people around the martial stage. Other than some experts taking turns on duty to guard the city, almost everyone else had come here.

The martial stage’s grand formation runes lit and then extinguished, lit and then extinguished. They were testing the condition of the grand formation, seeing if any runes had been damaged.

When Long Chen, Guo Ran, and the others arrived, countless gazes concentrated on them.

However, the majority of those gazes were cold and mocking. In particular, when they looked at Long Chen, their gazes were full of killing intent. That appearance was as if they wanted to immediately attack and eliminate him. That was because Long Chen had come to their Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College and killed people. That was unacceptable to them. It was a kind of disgrace.

But very quickly, those gazes became shocked. They suddenly noticed that Guo Ran, Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the others seemed different than before. Their faces were glowing. It was like they were completely different people.

“A group of idiots, so stupid that there’s no cure for them. Boss, should we just leave after this fight? Why do we have to save these idiots?” Seeing those gazes, Guo Ran’s fury soared.

Long Chen was the person that Guo Ran revered the most. He didn’t feel much when others looked down on him, but for them to look at Long Chen with such gazes was unacceptable to him.

“A person has to finish what they started. After all, you received the favor of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. They raised you. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have your current accomplishments. The majority of your current abilities are thanks to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, right? The dean himself was secretly looking after you, so you owe the dean a huge favor. Our Dragonblood Legion can never owe anyone. Right now, whatever personal debts and enmities you have must be settled by yourself. Isn’t it better to not owe anyone anything?” Long Chen patted Guo Ran’s shoulder and gave him some advice.

“Alright, I’ll listen to boss,” said Guo Ran. He clenched his teeth as he looked at those people’s gazes.

“Senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran, if you leave, you must bring us with you! We want to go muddle along with you!” declared Tu Hu and the others.

“What are you going to follow me for? If you muddle along with me, you won’t even be able to eat. I’m going to follow boss!” said Guo Ran.

Tu Hu and the others looked at Long Chen. These people were life-and-death brothers with Guo Ran. They were unwilling to leave him, and Guo Ran was unable to leave them. Since Guo Ran had cast this problem to Long Chen, they were looking for his response.

Before he answered though, ear-splitting cheers suddenly rang out. In the distance, Wang Zixu, Xie Liuer, and Leng Hui were walking over together. The crowd went wild.

Compared to Guo Ran’s arrival, it looked like the difference between the clouds and mud. These three were native experts of the Alldevil Star-Field, and they grew up here. They had powerful backgrounds even within the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. As for Guo Ran, he was nothing more than an ascender from a lower world.

The immortal world’s people had a natural sense of superiority over ascenders and looked down on them. Thus, Guo Ran’s rise within the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was exceptionally difficult.

The cheers brought on by the three of them already proved the bias between them and Guo Ran. Even if he had become one of the four heroes, countless people still looked down on him inside.

Even if someone was stronger than you, as long as you had the backing of a stronger power, you could just look down on them. Even if someone’s current position was higher, so what? You could continue to look down on them, and they would be helpless. Perhaps this was a kind of sickness in the human race’s bones.

Long Chen and Guo Ran brought everyone over to the front of the martial stage. This place was already packed with people. They were waiting for Long Chen, and they blocked his path.

“Don’t endure,” said Long Chen.

BOOM!

Guo Ran immediately kicked the closest person in the chest. That person then let out a grunt and flew back. The people beside him were also knocked away, tumbling back into the distance. Plenty of seats immediately opened.

“It is forbidden to use martial force here! Guo Ran, you are so brazen-!” roared the person who had just been kicked.

As a result, he had just said this when Tu Hu and the others stepped forward, and multiple fists immediately beat him bloody.

“Lu Qing, you little bastard, you dare to shout in front of the dean? You dare to utter the dean’s taboo name? You need to be beaten to death!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lu Qing was one of Leng Hui’s subordinates. Since he already had enmity with Tu Hu and the others, they just took the chance to get revenge on him. After that, the sound of bones breaking occasionally rang out. Tu Hu and the others really did seem like they would kill him.

As for those people with Lu Qing, seeing this scene, they stepped forward to help him. However, the first person was sent reeling back by a punch from Xie Qianqian. She was quite vicious and used this opening to land a powerful kick to that person’s crotch.

An explosive sound rang out. As a result, that person’s body quivered intensely, and his eyes rolled up into his head. He directly fainted without even making a sound.

Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the others were like tigers beating these people until they cried out for their mothers and fathers. What was inexplicable to them was that Tu Hu and the others would previously only be the ones beaten. How were they so ferocious today? Almost everyone charging at them was knocked down with a single punch.

The chaos here immediately caused quite a few people to rush over. Although they appeared to be coming to stop the fight, they were really there just to tilt the scales, wanting to suppress Tu Hu and the others. As a result, Tu Hu and the others were full of power and addicted to this feeling. It didn’t matter who came, they didn’t let these people off.

In just a short time, over a hundred people were on the ground. Due to it being forbidden to use martial force in this place, no one summoned their armor. Anyone who did would be directly expelled. Thus, it was only a fight of physical bodies.

Guo Ran watched as Tu Hu and the others struck flesh with every single one of their punches. It was truly satisfying. He also wanted to join in but was held back by Long Chen.

“Grow up a bit. You’re going to fight over this little bit with them?” said Long Chen irritably.

“Stop!”

“Who is causing a scene!?”

“Cease this at once!”

“What a scandal!”

As the chaos grew, the elders were no longer able to sit still. They roared to stop things.

However, Tu Hu and the others could not be controlled. They had been suppressed for so long and couldn’t pull back their anger.

That feeling of having endless energy in their bodies was incredibly refreshing. They had never felt so good in their lives. They seemed to be unrivaled existences at this moment, and they even had an urge to kill people, as if even if gods came, they would kill gods. They pretended that they didn’t hear the chidings, and they simply beat anyone who came at them.

“Not bad, not bad. Youngsters should have this kind of vitality.”

Suddenly, a voice rang out. Everyone then looked over to see Xue Yifan floating in the sky in white robes. He was laughing as he watched this chaotic scene. He didn’t seem angry at all, and nor did he have any intention of stopping them.
