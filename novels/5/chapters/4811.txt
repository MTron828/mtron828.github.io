Chapter 4800 Brahma Pill Valley

The Brahma Pill Valley, a name that Long Chen had heard in the Lifehunter race’s stronghold. The Pill Valley had been a holy land for alchemists on the Martial Heaven Continent, monopolizing the entire continent’s supply of medicinal pills.

However, when Long Chen arrived in the immortal world, he found that there were plenty of alchemists from various factions. Even the merchant companies had plenty of alchemists and the ability to refine their own pills for selling. As a result, Long Chen had almost forgotten the name of Pill Valley. But now that he heard this name again, he instantly thought of Lord Brahma. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Has the Brahma Pill Valley always been in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven?” asked Long Chen.

Bai Letian nodded and explained that the Brahma Pill Valley was the peak of this world’s Pill Dao, as well as the strongest organization within the nine heavens and ten lands.

After all, just the name of Lord Brahma was enough to intimidate countless experts. He was a Venerate amongst Gods—the strongest god cultivator in existence.

Even if one were to set aside Lord Brahma’s power, his followers were so many that they were in every corner of the nine heavens and ten lands. Even if each of them spat just once, it would be enough to drown an entire sect.

Within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, the Brahma Pill Valley was the leader of the human race, as well as a symbol of glory, and over ninety percent of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s human race were followers of Lord Brahma.

While every faction could buy pills from the Brahma Pill Valley, the followers of Lord Brahma got a better price, and those who had gone through the baptism of his divine radiance could even get a portion of free pills according to their cultivation base. This was a great deal as the greatest expense on the path of cultivation was medicinal pills. By becoming one of Lord Brahma’s followers, they could save a huge amount of money. As a result, countless people flocked to his side.

However, some factions had inheritances that did not permit them to become believers of any other god. The Brahma Pill Valley didn’t make things hard on them, allowing them to purchase pills. However, the condition was that they could not forbid their disciples from worshiping the Divine Venerate, nor could they meddle in each disciple’s religious freedom.

Hence, even though some factions were not subordinates of the Brahma Pill Valley, quite a few of their disciples were Lord Brahma’s followers.

Those followers would naturally influence the others in their clans and sects. Although many factions did not find it appropriate, anyone who tried to say anything would be caught by the Brahma Pill Valley and cut off from their supply of medicinal pills. Thus, they had no choice but to lower their heads to the Brahma Pill Valley.

Of course, those factions were not fools. Their core disciples had long since been informed subtly not to join the Brahma Pill Valley, and the higher-ups were also only loyal to the sect. After all, only those loyal to the clan would be given any position of power. It could be considered a way to fight back against the invasion of Pill Valley.

However, there was no hole that Lord Brahma’s followers couldn’t get through, and the various factions couldn’t make it too obvious that they were fighting against it. Otherwise, they would be cut off from the supply of medicinal pills.

With the supply of medicinal pills in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven monopolized by the Brahma Pill Valley, every alchemist in this realm was affiliated with them. It was the sole entity possessing a comprehensive Pill Dao inheritance in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

If someone wanted to cultivate the Pill Dao, they had to join the Brahma Pill Valley, and if they wanted to advance, they had to undergo the divine baptism, becoming loyal worshipers of Lord Brahma. Only then could they gain access to higher-level alchemy arts.

How vicious. To directly monopolize medicinal pills, it’s essentially like gripping the lifeline of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven's people. All their lives are under the control of Lord Brahma, Long Chen thought.

According to Bai Letian, the Brahma Pill Valley was the strongest human force within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Furthermore, with the opening of the gate to the ninth heaven, more worshipers from the various worlds were flooding in, and the Brahma Pill Valley would quickly inflate to an unimaginable level.

“At first, I thought that our accumulated karmic luck spanning millions of years would suffice for us to establish a foothold in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Even if we couldn’t compete with Lord Brahma, we should have been able to protect ourselves. But now, our moves seem entirely under the control of our enemies. I’ve been taking them too lightly,” admitted Bai Letian solemnly.

“You mean to say that Lord Brahma is spying on you?” asked Long Chen.

Shaking his head, Bai Letian replied, “Lord Brahma should be in seclusion. According to the sweeping elder, he is still in a critical juncture and can’t even mobilize his clones.”

“If it isn’t him, who is it? Fallen Daynight?” inquired Long Chen again.

Sighing, Bai Letian answered, “Fallen Daynight is in seclusion with Lord Brahma.”

“Other than them, who is strong enough to be able to track your movements so perfectly?” asked Long Chen.

“My guess is that it is one of his subordinates who is using the Brahma Divine Diagram to spy on me.”

“The Brahma Divine Diagram? Is it that powerful? Is it stronger than the High Firmament Divine Sword?”

Bai Letian said, “The power of a karmic luck divine weapon doesn’t depend on itself but on the karmic luck. In theory, even though the Brahma Pill Valley has countless disciples and worshipers, our High Firmament Academy is the most ancient academy within the nine heavens and ten lands, and thus in terms of karmic luck, we should be somewhat evenly matched. Even if the Brahma Divine Diagram is a bit stronger, it can’t have reached the point of being able to spy on me without me sensing a thing. However, things still progressed in this manner. I’ve asked the High Firmament Divine Sword, and it said that the other side might be carrying out some kind of sacrificial ceremony in exchange for power.”

“Sacrifice? They wouldn’t be recruiting so many people... and not wanting to waste resources... in order to...” Long Chen’s heart shook. The implication of his conjecture was truly sinister. But based on his understanding of Lord Brahma and his followers, they were willing to use any means necessary, no matter how cruel and inhumane.

Long Chen’s speculation caused Bai Zhantang and the others to widen their eyes in disbelief. Looking at Bai Letian’s expression, they realized that this guess was very likely correct.

“Through this sacrificial offering, they are able to boost the power of the Brahma Divine Diagram to the point that its power surpasses the High Firmament Divine Sword. Now, our situation is dire,” stated Bai Letian.

“If they were to attack with the Brahma Divine Diagram, wouldn’t we be completely doomed?” Bai Zhantang frowned.

“I don’t believe that’s a concern. The Brahma Divine Diagram is Lord Brahma’s personal divine weapon. Other than him, no one else can draw out its true power. Even if they were to use the Brahma Divine Diagram in combat, it wouldn’t be enough to beat us. Otherwise, they’d have long since sent their subordinates to crush us,” Bai Letian reassured, dispelling that particular fear.

“The reason they are going to such lengths is to avoid facing us directly. In truth, without Lord Brahma present, they don’t have the guts to fight us directly,” Bai Letian continued. “Securing the first branch academy is our priority, and their goal is to slowly exhaust us in this fight. After all, in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, we don’t have a supply of medicinal pills. Our situation will only grow worse over time.”

“Then what should we do now?” asked Long Chen.

“What do you think we should do now?” Bai Letian returned the question.

Long Chen was taken aback, glancing around to find Bai Zhantang and the others equally surprised. “Dean Bai, you know that I am asking you, right?"

“I know. And I’m asking you back,” Bai Letian affirmed.

Long Chen pointed at himself in disbelief. “Me? You mean...?”

Bai Letian nodded. “Before leaving, the sweeping elder told me that when there is no strategy to try, instead of messing around, leave the troublesome problem to someone with the means to deal with it.”

Long Chen almost spat out blood when he heard that.
