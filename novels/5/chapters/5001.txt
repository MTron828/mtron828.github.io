“Long Tianrui is a bit terrifying.”

Long Chen left with an expression of arrogance, but once he was out of Long Tianrui’s sight, his demeanor turned serious. Long Tianrui’s aura didn’t leak in the slightest. What she presented was like the surface of a deep well, and Long Chen had no idea just how profound this well truly was. No one could discern if there was a dormant volcano lurking beneath the well’s calm exterior.

It was Long Chen’s first time encountering someone who could perfectly conceal their true power without any effort. Long Tianrui had to be stronger than Jiang Wuwang, and not by just a bit.

Long Chen was on his way to the residence arranged by the Heaven Overseer when his tablet suddenly flashed. Startled, he assumed something urgent had occurred in Mercenary City, prompting him to hurry there, only to discover that someone simply wanted to meet him.

“Qin Feng!”

Long Chen hadn’t expected to see the Dragonblood warrior Qin Feng here.

“Boss!”

Qin Feng was excited to see Long Chen. Beside him, Long Ziwei sighed with relief when he saw that they were truly acquainted.

When Qin Feng arrived here, he didn’t act brazenly. Disguised as an adventurer, he asked around first. Naturally, the first people he encountered were the mercenaries.

As a result, seeing him casually asking around about Long Chen, the mercenaries didn’t know whether or not they should inform Long Chen.

After all, someone of Long Chen’s stature couldn't be approached by just anyone; allowing random individuals to see him would burden Long Chen with constant interruptions.

Coincidentally, Gui Jiu had recently recovered from his injuries, sustained when Fang Liude was killed. So, the mercenaries informed him of this.

When Gui Jiu prepared to ask Qin Feng about why he wanted to see Long Chen, Qin Feng’s eyes brightened. He instantly recognized Gui Jiu and vividly described how Gui Jiu’s head had been obliterated at the gate to the ninth heaven.

Although it was a bit embarrassing, Qin Feng believed that mentioning this would confirm his acquaintance with Long Chen. However, the incident of Gui Jiu’s head being destroyed by Long Chen was common knowledge here. Furthermore, Qin Feng only said that he knew Long Chen and wanted to tell Long Chen something important, not saying anything about him being a Dragonblood warrior.

Qin Feng held back from divulging more about himself because he lacked information on Long Chen’s status within the Long clan. Thus, he was cautious about revealing too much.

Gui Jiu then reported Qin Feng’s matter to Long Ziwei. When Long Ziwei laid eyes on Qin Feng, his heart trembled inexplicably. Standing before him was a five star Doyen, and for some reason, Long Ziwei sensed immense pressure emanating from him.

Long Ziwei had condensed a Heavenly Fate Ring and was a half-step Heavenly Chosen. For someone to evoke such a feeling from him, he couldn’t help but feel cautious.

However, rather than rashly trying to probe Qin Feng, Long Ziwei chose to use the communication tablet Long Chen had given him. Seeing that the two of them really knew each other, he relaxed. At the same time, he could guess Qin Feng’s status.

In Long Chen’s residence, the three of them sat together. Despite Long Ziwei’s earlier suspicion, he was still taken aback when the introductions were made.

When Qin Feng introduced himself as a Dragonblood warrior without any additional title, Long Ziwei couldn’t help but inquire, “Brother Qin, do you have any post in the Dragonblood Legion?”

“No. I’m just an ordinary Dragonblood warrior,” replied Qin Feng.

“You’re so powerful, but you’re just an ordinary Dragonblood warrior?” Long Ziwei found it hard to believe.

Although they had not exchanged blows, the immense pressure Qin Feng exuded made Long Ziwei speculate that Qin Feng’s combat prowess might be on par with his own, or perhaps only slightly inferior.

Before Long Chen came, the Long clan often used Long Ziwei as a benchmark to compare with Long Chen, saying he was no match for Long Chen. Unwilling to accept this assessment, Long Ziwei had sought information about Long Chen.

However, as a disciple, his investigative abilities were limited, relying mostly on information provided by the Long clan. Long Ziwei had heard mainly about Long Chen having multiple women and commanding a Dragonblood Legion of over seven thousand Dragonblood warriors.

When Long Ziwei first heard about the Dragonblood Legion, he almost burst into laughter. To him, a true monster was always a solitary existence; only cows and sheep grouped together. This information made him look down on Long Chen.

He assumed Long Chen must have been too weak to win battles alone. How could such a person consider himself an expert?

However, after seeing Qin Feng, Long Ziwei was stunned. Such an expert was only an ordinary Dragonblood warrior?

Qin Feng smiled bitterly. “I’m ashamed. I once got to follow Boss alone for a while, which helped improve my power a bit. When I returned to the Dragonblood Legion, I served as a vice leader for a small squad for three months. Then… someone else took my spot.”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Small squad? Vice leader?” Long Ziwei’s jaw dropped. If what Qin Feng said was true, then how strong was the Dragonblood Legion?

Although Long Ziwei didn’t know much about the Dragonblood Legion, he was aware that they had four captains. He didn’t know their names, but upon seeing Qin Feng, he had assumed Qin Feng was one of those captains.

“Qin Feng, what are you here for? Ziwei isn’t an outsider, so you can speak frankly,” said Long Chen.

Qin Feng solemnly replied, “The High Firmament Academy has reclaimed its first branch academy and activated the foundation stone. Sixteen minor worlds and the hidden treasury of the academy have all been opened…”

“What? You’re doing that well? Has the dean decided to show his might?” Long Chen was shocked but also delighted. He hadn’t expected the academy to have gone through such an immense transformation in this short time.

“It’s not the dean. The palace master returned.” Qin Feng’s eyes filled with worship as he spoke of the palace master.

He continued, “When the palace master returned, he plowed through the enemies, directly reclaiming the first academy’s territory in the most straightforward and violent manner. The foreign devils were unable to stop him. Countless experts with heaven veins appeared, but were all swept aside by the palace master. At the critical moment, the Brahma Divine Diagram reappeared, and the palace master fought against it with the High Firmament Divine Sword. The dragon qi of six heaven veins swirled around, and he forced the Brahma Divine Diagram back. Boss, it’s really a shame you didn’t manage to see that scene.”

Qin Feng was excited just recalling what he had seen. Long Chen’s jaw also dropped. The dragon qi of six heaven veins? Just what had the palace master done during this time? How was he so terrifying now?

Long Ziwei was also stunned to hear this. Six heaven veins? Such an existence could crush someone like Long Qihua with a single punch—it would be like a large man beating a child.

“The palace master really is strong. That’s great. Now, no one will dare to take advantage of the High Firmament Academy,” said Long Chen excitedly.

“That’s right, Boss. Since the first academy has been reclaimed, the dean plans to open the High Firmament World. Everyone can advance to the Eternal realm inside. According to the dean, once we go inside, we can awaken a Heavenly Fate Ring!”

“Awaken a Heavenly Fate Ring?!” Long Chen was shocked to hear that.
