Chapter 3236 The Chu Family’s Sinister Scheme

“God Barrier!”

Seeing Luo Changwu suddenly unleashing such power, Chu Yingxiong was shocked. Their auras had instantly reached the half-step Immortal King realm.

Following his shout, the earth split open, and two divine statues rose out. Those two statues were of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Chu family’s divine statues were actually buried underground. Once they appeared, divine light erupted out of them, forming a giant barrier protecting Chu Yingxiong.

Luo Changwu and the others’ swords slashed onto the barrier. The barrier rumbled but didn’t immediately break.

However, as they continued to attack, the two statues began to shake. Cracks began to appear on top of them.

“The divine statues won’t last much longer before they break!” shouted Luo Changwu.

They continued to attack, and their immense power caused the earth to shake. Countless buildings collapsed.

“Ignore me! Stop that girl!”

Just as countless experts of the Chu family rushed toward Chu Yingxiong to help, he shouted at them. Lei Linger had reached the final altar.

Lei Linger’s sword slashed into the altar, and a heaven-shaking explosion erupted. Cracks appeared on the totem. One more slash would break it.

Just as she was preparing her second strike, a Primal Divine Lord of the Chu family charged over at her with a golden rune on his forehead. His Blood Qi ignited, and he forced her back.

The Chu family’s Divine Lords rushed over to her, their Blood Qi igniting. Right now, their auras all soared.

“Igniting longevity. Pretty vicious!”

Long Chen was surprised. With the appearance of the two divine statues, they were supported by divine energy. Using that divine energy, they burned their own longevity in exchange for raising their power as high as possible.

Burning their longevity was like burning their own lives. It was an irrecoverable, self-damaging technique. It was extremely vicious, but the temporary power that could be gained by doing so was also very terrifying.

Lei Linger was surrounded by hundreds of Divine Lords. Even then, she was constantly cutting them down. It was just that there were too many of them, and their divine energy compressed space. She tried to get past them several times to attack the totem but was unable to succeed. She was gradually forced back more and more.

The Chu family’s experts were truly going crazy. As soon as they became unable to stop Lei Linger, one of them would detonate just to force her further back. These detonations also affected their comrades beside them, occasionally killing them.

They had no choice but to throw their lives away. If they failed, then the entire Chu family would be destroyed.

Their numbers dwindled. Lei Linger ended up being the reaper of their lives, but they continued to persevere.

In the distance, the sound of killing also rang out. Qin Feng’s saber was unstoppable as countless experts fell in his path. Xu Zixiong followed behind him. At this moment, three flower petals spun in Bai Xiaole’s eyes. Space then layered and countless people were caught in that layered space, bewildered until they were crushed by the spatial pressure.

Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Luo Xue, and Luo Qing followed the three of them. Behind them were the Luo family’s two hundred archers. They were blocking wave after wave of experts.

Qin Feng’s mission was to stop them so that Long Chen and the others could fight at ease. If they failed, then Long Chen’s side would be thrown into greater danger.

Most of these experts belonged to the various forces within the Sheng Prefecture. There were too many Divine Lords to count.

The fortunate thing was that the Luo family’s archers were truly powerful. The arrows made by the Wood Foundation Divine Trees possessed terrifying killing power. Just with their pitiful numbers, they were able to block that army all the way until now.

The Chu family’s territory had transformed into a sea of blood. Meanwhile, Long Chen and Chu Yingxiong were still fighting over the pill furnace, but Long Chen found himself more and more at a disadvantage. He cursed the pill furnace’s item-spirit for not resisting at all, not provoking the primal chaos space.

Long Chen had no way to order the primal chaos space to attack, so he grew anxious. This treasure was a must-have for him.

Luo Changwu and the others continued to attack the barrier. Countless cracks had appeared on Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight’s statues. They looked like they might shatter at any moment, but they simply refused to.

As for Lei Linger’s side, the Chu family’s experts were constantly being cut down, either by being killed by Lei Linger or through their own self-detonations.

The bad news was the final altar’s totem was growing brighter and brighter. A terrifying aura began to come from it, making people’s souls quiver. It was as if some terrifying beast was about to arrive.

They had reached a critical moment. Amongst these multiple battlefields, all that was required was a single breakthrough for the other side to be wiped out.

Long Chen’s flame chains shuddered as they pulled the pill furnace. If the pill furnace once more landed in Chu Yingxiong’s hands, Long Chen would never get such a good opportunity again.

Chu Yingxiong was also pulling the pill furnace with all his power. If he could gain control over it again, the battle would instantly become one-sided. Now the question was when the balance of the battlefield would tip over.

“If Luo Zichuan hasn’t come out even at such a time, I’m sure that something had happened to him!” shouted Chu Yingxiong suddenly.

The expression of the Luo family’s Elders twitched. Long Chen instantly got a bad feeling. Their expression was essentially telling the other side the truth. Those old fellows were actually lacking a strong enough mentality to not react. As expected, Luo Zichuan was their mental pillar, and without him, they lost that pillar.

“Hahaha, since that’s the case, you can all die!” Chu Yingxiong seemed to understand and laughed.

BOOM!

The sea of blood on the ground suddenly condensed toward the altar. That final altar instantly turned red from all that blood.

“Originally, I was planning on using the Spirit Blood of the Chu family to condense the god’s curse, but now there’s no need. Since that’s the case, let this blood become an offering!” roared Chu Yingxiong.

Long Chen’s heart shuddered. Chu Yingxiong truly was ruthless as he still had this trump card. All the Chu family’s experts that were dying right now were part of his plan.

Although Long Chen didn’t know what this god curse was, it was clearly a trump card that Chu Yingxiong had been preparing for Luo Zichuan.

In other words, when Long Chen came here and started killing people, Chu Yingxiong saw everything and let them continue just to use the Chu family’s blood against Luo Zichuan. Long Chen’s guess that he had been praying to the divine statue to summon the god’s power was actually wrong.

“In other words…”

Long Chen suddenly looked toward the altar. He finally noticed that the five altars might look identical, but the final altar’s light seemed a bit different.

“Damn! This bastard really is crafty!” Long Chen’s heart shuddered. That final altar was very likely intentionally preserved by Chu Yingxiong.

Just then, the totem absorbing all that fresh blood exploded. A giant blood-colored gate then appeared on top of the altar.

With the gate open, an enormous figure came out of it. It was a lifeform with two horns on its head and a bone blade on its back. Its entire body was wrapped in fire.

“Immortal King!”

When they saw that terrifying lifeform, Luo Changwu and the others felt like they had dropped into an iceberg. A cold chill filled them from top to bottom.
