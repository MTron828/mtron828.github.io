Chapter 4344 Long Chen’s World-Destroying Heavenly Tribulation

The Dragonblood Legion was the first to react, launching a ruthless and almost suicidal assault. Just like that, their duplicates started to explode one by one. Following these explosions, pure thunderforce entered the Dragonblood warriors, and a certain divine radiance appeared behind their heads.

“The World King divine radiance has appeared. They have stepped into the World King realm!” cheered someone.

Even in front of such a terrifying heavenly tribulation, the Dragonblood Legion still succeeded. They were truly powerful.

“Help me!” Xia Chen shouted. His copy had limitless talismans, so there was no way for him to beat it. Without any help, once Xia Chen’s talismans were used up, he would definitely die.

Answering his call for help, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan attacked Xia Chen’s copy at the same time. However, it suddenly waved its hand, summoning millions and millions of talismans.

“What the fuck?!”

Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan hastily retreated. When those talismans activated, the immense explosion caused the three of them to cough up blood.

“Where did he get so many talismans?!” The three of them cried out in shock. If they hadn’t retreated fast enough, the detonation of that many talismans would have killed them.

Just as those talismans exploded, Sword Qi slashed through the air, cutting Xia Chen’s copy in two. Their savior was none other than Yue Zifeng.

Following that, Xia Chen thanked Yue Zifeng and quickly absorbed those lightning runes. The World King divine radiance also appeared on the back of his head.

“Don’t slack off! Help the others!” shouted Gu Yang as he saw many people unable to beat their duplicates even after going all-out. Similar situations, like Xia Chen's, were happening in other locations as well, so they had to assist them.

Just then, a group of figures appeared in the sky. Surprisingly, they were the lifeforms from the humanless world, also duplicated by the Heavenly Daos, and a wave of lightning beasts advanced from behind them.

“Boss, our armor still needs more thunderforce!” shouted Guo Ran.

He knew that their tribulations were essentially done, and they had become World Kings. However, their armor and weapons had yet to fully manifest their spirits.

“Dragonblood warriors, stay behind! Everyone else, leave the heavenly tribulation’s core area!” shouted Long Chen.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Immediately, all the disciples of the High Firmament Academy, the Battle God Palace, and the Starry River Sect left the core of the tribulation. Having finished their tribulations and reached the World King realm, they were only missing the final step—igniting their World King divine radiance.

However, they would have to wait until the heavenly tribulation finished before they could do it. Due to the addition of the humanless world’s lifeforms, the tribulation became longer.

“Kill!”

When the heavenly tribulation’s two-headed black python appeared, Gu Yang and the others immediately attacked it, launching their sharpest attacks.

The real two-headed python who was trapped by Lei Linger was incensed. If their opponents, their copies from the heavenly tribulation, were slain and their energy was absorbed by others, they would be doomed, unable to advance to the World King realm in this lifetime.

Seeing this scene, the two-headed lifeform assaulted the barrier with renewed fervor, but he was still unable to shake it.

“Bastards! If you have the guts, let me out and fight me!” shouted the two-headed black python.

The Dragonblood warriors cut down the lightning beasts and the duplicated lifeforms of the humanless world. After absorbing their lightning essence, they were pleasantly surprised to find that this lightning contained the laws of primal chaos. In just a moment, their armor and weapons started to shine brightly, and an air of life appeared around them. Their equipment had finally awakened their spirituality and could now be considered true Eternal weapons.

The Dragonblood warriors cheered, while Xia Chen and Guo Ran were so moved that they almost cried.

Although they believed in this method, they had still been nervous the entire time. The crazy idea of using the power of heavenly tribulation to bestow divine items with spirituality had proven to be a success.

Their armor and weapons flashed, a sign of their item-spirits being born. After their spirits awoke, they vanished, merging into the Dragonblood warriors.

Although their spirits had been born, they still couldn’t be considered true divine weapons. It would be up to the Dragonblood warriors to use their souls to continue nourishing them.

After all, their item-spirits had just been born and were still very immature. They were like tiny flames that needed to be nourished until they one day became the blazing fire known as true Eternal divine weapons.

In the end, only Guo Ran’s armor remained unawakened because it consisted of over three hundred and sixty pieces instead of one.

Fortunately, there were still many opponents for him to fight. As Gu Yang and the others no longer needed more thunderforce, they just helped Guo Ran kill the lightning lifeforms. Just like that, Guo Ran was absorbing an enormous amount of thunderforce by himself.

His battle armor was constantly flashing as it absorbed endless thunderforce. When Gu Yang’s spear pierced through the two-headed black python’s copy, lightning runes exploded, and Guo Ran’s armor blazed with light.

“Success!”

Guo Ran shouted excitedly. When the two-headed black serpent’s copy was killed, his armor instantly absorbed its energy. Every piece of his armor had a spirit born and awakened within it, and it instantly became a part of him. Moreover, there was a bloodline resonance that made him feel particularly close to his armor.

BOOM!

Just then, the gate high up in the heavens crumbled, and heaven and earth returned to their original appearance.

“The heavenly tribulation is over!”

People let out sighs of relief. This terrifying tribulation was finally over.

“No, why didn’t senior apprentice-brother Long Chen go through his tribulation?”

“Some of them don’t have their World King divine radiance ignited!”

Sounds of confusion and concern rippled through the crowd. Now, the Dragonblood warriors had the World King divine radiance behind their heads. It was evident that they had obtained the recognition of the Heavenly Daos and formally became World Kings.

However, everyone else was still lacking this light even though the tribulation was over. The onlookers were dumbfounded. What was going on?

Just then, the earth started to shake, and everyone’s expression changed.

This time, the ground’s shaking was not just as far as they could sense… no, this entire world was shaking. Even the experts standing guard far in the distance felt the ground shaking beneath their feet.

“Heavens, what is that?!”

When people pulled their gazes up from the ground, they saw nothing but darkness. Pitch-black tribulation clouds were gathering from every direction.

After these tribulation clouds appeared, the world darkened as if the end of days had come.

Right at this moment, numerous jade plates that the people here carried on their waists flash rapidly. When they looked at the message, their expressions changed.

They had all received urgent messages from their sects. The sects that were spread throughout this world were suddenly covered by terrifying tribulation clouds, and the terrifying pressure directly shattered their grand formations. It seemed that they were under some unknown attack.

These experts then looked at the tribulation clouds above them in terror. Those clouds devoured all light, and this so-called unknown attack was the unmatched pressure from these tribulation clouds.

With great difficulty, people gulped and sweat silently rolled down their foreheads.

“This heavenly tribulation has covered the entire Nirvana Overflow Heaven.” At this moment, a voice that startled Bai Zhantang and the others rang out.

“Palace master, why are you here?”

Unexpectedly, the palace master had personally come.

The palace master didn’t reply and just looked at the tribulation clouds covering the heavens with a hint of graveness.

“This is a world-destroying tribulation. Long Chen is in danger.”
