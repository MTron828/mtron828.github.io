Chapter 4180: Continuing the Auction

“Let us trade right here and now in front of everyone. This friend, please come up, so everyone can see that there is no cheating,” said Long Chen.

Suddenly, black qi appeared in front of Long Chen. That person seemed to teleport from the back seats to Long Chen in an instant.

Enveloped in swirling black qi, this figure appeared ethereal, as if it lacked a physical form and was composed solely of black qi. The only semblance of a corporeal presence was those eyes that were like a fiend’s eyes.

Someone else would definitely be shaking in their boots from being stared at by those eyes in such close proximity, but Long Chen boldly extended a hand toward that figure.

“My product has been examined by the Soaring Dragon Company. But what about yours?” asked Long Chen.

That figure then moved, and a thumb-sized black stone flew out of his body. Upon its appearance, startled cries rang out.

“A world stone!”

A world stone was the product of compressing an entire world to the limit. It contained its own world inside of it and was incomparable to a storage ring.

However, as it was refined from the core of a world, it was incredibly precious, so even Long Chen had never seen one before.

Long Chen reached out and received the world stone. However, the moment he touched it stone, his expression changed. He then looked at this lifeform and knew its origins now.

“Go ahead and check!” said the lifeform. Its voice was very bizarre, like two stones grating at each other. It was almost like a specter coming from the depths of hell. Just hearing it made people’s souls quiver.

Long Chen didn’t say anything, and his divine sense entered the world stone. The space inside was practically limitless. But the moment his divine sense entered, a sharp pain struck his soul, and a terrifying divine might almost made him collapse.

There were eighteen giant corpses with black qi swirling around them inside the world stone. Amongst them were greater demons, fiendish devils, sea monsters, and one in particular made Long Chen’s heart leap.

“Fullmoon Rhinoceros!”

There was actually an Eternal corpse of the Fullmoon race inside. This corpse would not belong to Long Chen; he would have to give it to Uncle Xiong.

When Long Chen saw the six Eternal divine weapons, his expression changed. “These six weapons are of the Ghost Dao. I can’t use them.”

“The Ghost Dao?!”

Gasps rang out from the crowd as they realized where this lifeform came from.

The Ghost Dao’s Eternal divine weapons could only be used by the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms due to their own specific marks. Others who attempted to wield them would likely have their souls collapsing just by carrying them. After all, these types of Eternal divine weapons had a propensity to consume souls.

That was why Long Chen knew he had been scammed when he saw those divine weapons. These things were worthless to him.

“Are they not Eternal divine weapons?” said the Ghost Dao’s lifeform.

“Alright, count yourself vicious. I accept it. You can take the bronze cauldron!” Long Chen snorted and put away the world stone.

The Ghost Dao lifeform then spread its arms around the bronze cauldron. Black qi gushed out, enveloping the cauldron, and it put it away just like that.

After this lifeform was done, it turned to look at the crowd. “I know many of you will want to take the bronze cauldron from me. That’s fine. I’ll welcome you at any time, whether it be Immortal Kings or Heaven Venerates.”

This lifeform was quite domineering. It seemed that it looked down on everyone here and was not at all worried about anyone fighting over the cauldron.

Suddenly, its body dissipated. Even all the innate Heaven Venerates here could not tell how it left.

For a moment, everyone was deathly silent. This lifeform had scared everyone. This ability to come and go silently was terrifying.

The bronze cauldron was gone, so everyone started to rise and leave. Long Chen was also preparing to leave, but at this moment, inside the primal chaos space, the second bronze cauldron that Xia Chen and Guo Ran had made suddenly lit up.

“What?!” Long Chen was completely shocked. The runes on this cauldron began to change, and all kinds of beast carvings appeared on it, causing a ferocious aura to exude from it.

“This is…!”

Long Chen hastily checked on the Earth Cauldron in the spiritual space. It was what had changed the fake cauldron.

After seeing this, Long Chen almost cried out. This cauldron now bore a striking resemblance to the second cauldron depicted in the images that the Soaring Dragon Company had presented earlier.

“Many thanks!”

Long Chen instantly realized that the Earth Cauldron was helping him sell off his other fake.

“Hey, everyone, wait a moment! The auction isn’t over!”

Seeing everyone leaving, Long Chen cried out. The Soaring Dragon Company’s people were also trying to advise people to stay, so Long Chen’s shout surprised them. Had he finally gotten a conscience and was going to help them?

“What’s the point? The Heaven Earth Cauldron is gone. Do you have another?” sneered someone irritably. This person was the one who had made the second-highest bid, only to be beaten by the Ghost Dao’s lifeform.

“Hahaha, what a guess! Yes, I really have another.”

Long Chen waved his hand, and another bronze cauldron appeared on the stage with stunning golden light and powerful divine radiance.

However, it was different from the previous cauldron. Its peaceful air had been transformed into a frightening one, like a bloodthirsty beast that had been sealed for countless years trying to break free. The entire auction hall grew dark and cold because of its existence.

“This is…!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Seeing this cauldron, countless people’s expressions changed. This cauldron looked identical to the previous one.

But its runes were completely different. The previous cauldron gave off a peaceful feeling, depicting mountains, plains, and rivers, the sun, moon, and stars.

However, this cauldron’s runes formed into images of various ferocious beasts. Although the images of those beasts were rather vague, people instantly recognized their outlines.

There were giant dragons, flying phoenixes, black tortoises, wild tigers, as well as other kinds of ancient beasts that people had never seen before.

Its terrible aura filled the auction hall, causing even innate Heaven Venerates to quiver in front of it.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s appraisers examined the cauldron, and then one of them excitedly cried out, “I understand, I understand!”

“What do you understand?” asked Long Chen.

“The Heaven Earth Cauldron is not just one cauldron, it is the Earth Cauldron and the Heaven Cauldron! Our records aren’t wrong, the two different images inside them are both correct! The one that was sold just now should be the Earth Cauldron, and this must be the Heaven Cauldron! So you actually had two cauldrons but auctioned them separately. What profound scheming,” said the elder.

What profound scheming? If it weren’t for the true Earth Cauldron helping, this fake would have to be thrown away. However, now that the elder said this, there was no need for Long Chen to explain.

All the experts present nodded with comprehension. Didn’t this mean that Long Chen’s cauldrons were truly the Heaven Earth Cauldron?

“This is the final bronze cauldron. For anyone with money, the bidding starts now!” Seeing countless people staring with scarlet eyes, Long Chen directly started the auction.

The crowd practically exploded at that moment.
