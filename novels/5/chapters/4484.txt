Chapter 4473 Heavenly Doyen Fruit

“Heavenly Doyen Fruit?!”

Long Chen held his breath when saw those seven sparkling fruits.

After Long Chen had slain Netherdragon Tianye, a budding Doyen, he was filled with hope and checked to see if a Heavenly Doyen Fruit would appear. To his dismay, the Heavenly Dao Tree yielded no new growth.

Later on, in his fight with Netherdragon Tianzhao, Long Chen wanted to kill that bastard so badly, as he wanted to see whether the Heavenly Dao Tree possessed the transcendent power to produce a Heavenly Doyen Fruit.

Despite his efforts, Netherdragon Tianzhao managed to flee after using a sacrificial technique. Nevertheless, Long Chen had slain countless budding Doyens, yet there was no discernible response from the Heavenly Dao Tree.

With that, Long Chen assumed that Triple Supremes were the limit of the Heavenly Dao Fruit. After all, Doyens were masters of the heavens, and so it seemed reasonable that their power could not be assimilated by the Heavenly Dao Tree.

He stopped thinking about it after that. However, this discovery made him jump.

“Heaven-defying, absolutely heaven-defying!” Long Chen roared. The Heavenly Dao Tree was absolutely heaven-defying. It was actually able to produce Heavenly Doyen Fruit, signifying that he could create Heavenly Doyens in the future.

In other words, the Dragonblood Legion would become a legion of Doyens, masters of the heavens. Long Chen’s spirit was set ablaze.

He immediately plucked one of those Heavenly Doyen Fruits. Sensing the Heavenly Dao energy inside of it, he suddenly became pensive.

“This isn’t right. This Heavenly Dao energy is different from those Doyens…”

Long Chen sensed something off. The auras of those Doyens always disgusted him, but the aura of this fruit evoked a sense of familiarity.

“Could it be that these Heavenly Doyen Fruits will birth Doyens that are different from the original Doyens from whom their power is derived?”

Long Chen stared at the Heavenly Doyen Fruit suspiciously, his discovery stirring a sense of unease within him.

“Oh?”

Long Chen’s attention was piqued when he suddenly discerned a peculiar feature within the boundless Heavenly Dao runes inside the fruit. A distinct pit with a five-point star caught his eye, its irregular and mysterious nature making him curious.

“One star Heavenly Doyen Fruit?”

Long Chen’s mouth opened on its own.

Long Chen suddenly thought of Netherdragon Tianzhao, and lightning seemed to flash through his mind. Now, he had a guess as to why those Heavenly Doyens were so different from Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“A one star Doyen. In other words, the weakest level of Doyen. So, Netherdragon Tianzhao must not have been a one star Doyen.”

The more he thought, the more he felt that was the case.

“Hehe, good, then I can create my own Dragonblood Heavenly Doyen Legion.” Long Chen laughed excitedly. With Doyen power backing their dragon blood power, the Dragonblood Legion would go through a complete transformation.

However, Long Chen still hadn’t had a chance to test these Heavenly Doyen Fruits, so he couldn’t make any rash moves.

If a Dragonblood warrior could only consume a single Heavenly Doyen Fruit in their lifetime, what if their aptitude was forever set to a one star Doyen? What if future Heavenly Doyen Fruits could not change this?

Hence, Long Chen didn’t want to rashly use them. Once he found some stronger Heavenly Doyen Fruits, he’d find someone to make some tests.

With this new excitement coursing through his veins, Long Chen continued to work. He tossed the corpses that Xia Chen and Guo Ran had gone through into the black soil.

The two of them didn't even care about ordinary corpses, so the weaker ones had long since been tossed into the black soil and devoured in an instant.

Conversely, the corpse of a budding Doyen required a couple of minutes for complete dissolution, while Eternal corpses, originally taking days, now took just two hours.

When these powerful corpses were devoured, the life energy they unleashed caused all the vegetation within the primal chaos space to grow rapidly.

As a result, the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus had once more flowered. Long Chen then plucked the three Sacred Light Pistils and planted them.

Due to the immense amount of life energy within the primal chaos space, the Sacred Light Pistils instantly germinated and started to grow once they were planted—one grew to three, three grew to nine. Due to the unending stream of corpses, the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotuses rapidly spread.

Feeling the change, the Earth Cauldron couldn’t help but come out and swirl around the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotuses. They were incredibly important to it, so it couldn’t help but feel moved.

The Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotuses weren’t the only ones growing rapidly. All the vegetation within the primal chaos space was flourishing, and the most significant transformation occurred in the Fusang Trees and Moon Trees.

Their leaves had flames burning on them, but now their power was condensed and reserved. Every leaf had produced countless flame runes.

Finally, Long Chen turned his focus away from the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotuses and approached a Fusang Tree. Striking the trunk, he caused an enormous leaf to descend slowly.

This enormous leaf shrank until it was only the size of a palm in Long Chen’s hand. Its appearance resembled solid gold, and it had an astonishing weight akin to a divine weapon.

The edges of the leaf had a sawtooth pattern, giving it a shockingly sharp appearance.

Long Chen took out a sword and slashed the leaf, eliciting a metallic ringing sound. To his surprise, not only did the sword fail to penetrate the leaf, but it also incurred a noticeable nick in the blade.

“Amazing. Even World Domain divine items cannot cause any damage to it.”

Long Chen waved his hand, sending the leaf flying out.

BOOM!

The next moment, the leaf exploded in midair, and golden flames filled the air. A tiny leaf actually hid such terrifying destructive power.

“This is practically a natural flame talisman. Hahaha, I’m going to have another trump card!” Long Chen laughed.

This single leaf’s power was indeed shocking but still not to the point of being useful to Long Chen. It was not that threatening to Eternal experts and budding Doyens.

However, as more corpses were tossed in, the Fusang Trees and Moon Trees continuously grew, and their leaves constantly had new runes appearing on them. In the future, they would definitely become terrifying killing items.

If even the leaves were so powerful, then the actual branches had to be even more explosive. However, Long Chen still hadn’t thought about how to use them.

The growth of the Fusang Trees and Moon Trees made Huo Linger the happiest of all. She was like a gluttonous cat watching as her little fish pond grew, eating her fill every day.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The primal chaos space was also transforming with the addition of these corpses. New laws gradually merged into the primal chaos space as the corpses disintegrated, giving the impression that the primal chaos space possessed its own heavens, complete with the capacity to evolve. High above, Lei Linger was swimming in the clouds, surrounded by lightning.

The thunderforce emanated from the corpses, initially perplexing Long Chen. Seeking understanding, he turned to the Earth Cauldron for answers.

The Earth Cauldron’s answer was extremely straightforward: heavenly tribulation. Long Chen suddenly had an epiphany as he realized that the thunderforce bestowed upon these corpses during their lifetimes was now being absorbed by the primal chaos space.

Now, Lei Linger no longer needed to starve between Long Chen’s tribulations. With the continuous absorption of thunderforce from the potent corpses, Lei Linger finally acquired her own cultivation land within the evolving primal chaos space.

Time passed quickly as they worked. After half a month, Xia Chen and Guo Ran finally finished dealing with the corpses. When they were done, Ye Ling and Ye Xue ran over to them.

“We’ve opened the Esoteric Spirit Eye!”

Hearing this news, Long Chen was delighted.
