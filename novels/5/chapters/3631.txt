Chapter 3620

At the center of the Alldevil Star-Field was a giant city. It was the famous Hongying City.

This was a symbol of the human race’s past glory in the Alldevil Star-Field. Back in the day when Xia Guhong and Luo Qingying still led the human race, they had forced their enemies all the way back here. At that time, the human race managed to take over just over half of the entire Alldevil Star-Field’s territory.

It was due to this that the Alldevil Star-Field’s name was changed to the Hongying Star-Field. That was one of the habits of the human race; when a certain power occupied over half the territory of a domain, that domain was named according to their race, sect, or family.

However, the Hongying Star-Field’s name was only changed for a few centuries before it was changed back. The Alldevil race once more reclaimed huge swathes of territory.

In the outside world, people also knew that it should be called the Alldevil Star-Field. However, due to their respect for Xia Guhong and Luo Qingying, and due to their feelings of regret toward their sorrowful story, many people refused to change the name back and continued to call the Alldevil Star-Field the Hongying Star-Field.

As for Hongying City, it was once a symbol of glory but had now become the headquarters for the Luo clan. It was now a breeding ground for traitors who killed their fellow humans. The city was still the same, but the people were different.

The people in this glorious city were no longer thinking about protecting their family or race. Instead, they spent all day strategizing over how to destroy their own race. The signboard on the gates of Hongying City still remained, but now it was covered in layers of moss.

The once glorious golden characters were now covered. It was like they had closed their eyes, unwilling to watch the human race’s filthy side.

Right now, the grand formation of the city was already activated, and countless battleships were coming and going. There were millions of armored soldiers standing guard. As soon as the forging base sent out a distress signal, the level of security here was raised to the maximum.

All of a sudden, the void quivered and a black figure dived down from the sky like a divine bird, directly striking the barrier.

BOOM! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The barrier was instantly pierced through, and that black figure dove right into Hongying City.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

No one had even grasped what was going on before a flame lotus exploded amongst them. Flames then soared into the heavens, and countless soldiers and battleships were sent flying by a wave of flames.

It happened so suddenly that no one had any chance to react. Their gazes had been locked onto the distant horizon in search of oncoming battleships. They hadn’t expected someone to directly appear here.

Long Chen unleashed the World Extermination Flame Lotus as soon as he appeared, turning this place into a chaotic battlefield. The hundred thousand starry river warriors then followed him down from the heavens, entering through the opening that he had made.

“Destroy the battleships first!”

Long Chen shouted as he shot toward the strongest opponents, the Qingying Battleships.

The Qingying Battleships’ unrivaled formations, runes, and defensive structures were all unable to stop a single blow from the black dagger. It was like there was nothing in this world that could stop it.

Eleven Qingying Battleships were pierced through. This time, Long Chen didn’t attack randomly. The dagger only passed through the core at the front of the Qingying Battleships, making them unable to move temporarily. He didn’t completely destroy them.

“Kill! Steal! Take everything, even the clothes on their backs!”

Seeing those Qingying Battleships, Guo Ran’s eyes reddened. Those were treasures that he dreamed of obtaining. He immediately charged over to snatch them.

There was only one true Qingying Battleship, the personal fortress of Luo Qingying. It was said that it was impossible for others to activate it. Hence, these Qingying Battleships were replicas. But even though they were replicas, they were still based on the Qingying Battleship, and in the current era, no other battleship could match them.

Long Chen and the others descended from the heavens like a flying army, striking thunderously. They appeared at the heart of the city in no time at all, throwing the entire city into chaos.

It had to be known that almost all battles in the Alldevil Star-Field were based on long-distance attacks. People would only fight at close range at the end of a battle, so they had no experience with a battle like this.

Moreover, there was no way for them to effectively use their battleships within the city. Random attacks would only harm their comrades. They weren’t even confident in striking their targets, but they would definitely be killing their allies. In this situation, using their battleships was simply harming themselves. They had never thought of such a situation. Even their generals were lost on what to do. They didn’t know what orders to give.

As for the experts on the battleships, without the orders from the generals, they also didn’t dare to rashly unleash attacks.

“They don’t have many people! There’s no need to use the battleships. We’ll kill them ourselves!” Finally, the leader shouted his orders. What he didn’t know was just how foolish this order was.

The city had over ten million experts. They thought that they could crush these invaders with numbers.

As soon as they abandoned the battleships, the starry river warriors flew away from them, instead striking the battleships and destroying their runes before taking them away.

“Activate the formation to the apocalypse level! We cannot let them run away!” shouted the general with a furious howl.

He found that these people weren’t here to kill. They were only here to take their battleships, but he wouldn’t give them that chance.

“But if we activate the apocalypse level, people outside won’t be able to get in either. There’s also no way to stop it until the energy runs out!” reminded someone else.

“It doesn’t matter! We cannot allow them to take those battleships! Quick! I will take responsibility if anything happens!” shouted the general.

Following his orders, the city’s formation rumbled and the runes on top of the barrier actually ignited. As a result, an immense pressure caused heaven and earth to twist. Everyone within the city felt like a boulder was crushing them. Even the city’s buildings were unable to endure that pressure and began to collapse. The ground cracked. It was an astonishing sight.

“Ha, how adorably foolish. If I didn’t know who the traitors were, I’d even think that they were on our side.” Long Chen almost laughed when he heard those orders.

Once the formation was activated to the apocalypse level, there was no stopping it. It would only end once all the stored energy was used up. Now, no one could leave or enter.

This general thought that with this, Long Chen wouldn’t be able to leave. But with the black dagger, the strength of a formation made no difference to him. The only ones that they had trapped were themselves.

The Qingying Battleships were already gathered by Guo Ran, Leng Hui, Xie Liuer, and the others. Meanwhile, the starry river warriors were like bandits snatching the other battleships.

Long Chen also made his move. He killed several people, conducting soulsearches. He didn’t gain anything from those soulsearches though. Suddenly, he saw one person with slightly different armor and immediately rushed toward him.

BOOM!

Long Chen exchanged blows with that person. The result was that Long Chen was forced back a step by that person. It was actually a powerful expert.

That person was sent flying by Long Chen. But then Guo Ran appeared behind him and cut off his head. His cooperation with Long Chen was flawless.

Long Chen immediately pointed a finger at that person’s head. In a bit, a flood of information entered Long Chen’s mind.

“Hahaha! I’ve finally found it.”
