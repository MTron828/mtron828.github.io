Chapter 2553 Fearless

Long Chen looked through the world wall at the icy, arrogant man who had said such a stupid thing to him. Long Chen didn’t know who he was, but just looking at him made his anger flare.

For some reason, whether it was his expression, his voice, or his movements, they all contained a hateful flavor to them.

If he encountered such a person normally, he would simply ignore them. But with his rage burning so strongly, he naturally wasn’t courteous.

As Long Chen’s cultivation base rose, his control over his temper got worse and worse. Despite completely suppressing Dongfang Yuyang, essentially venting his anger, his rage only got worse. At this moment, the scenes of the battle in front of the mother tree reappeared in his mind. He saw Dongfang Yuyang threatening him with Ye Lingshan. That sinister smile of his was clear in his mind.

Long Chen had an urge to make Dongfang Yuyang have a hundred lives so he could kill them one by one. That was the only way to release his anger.

In reply to Ye Liangchen’s threat, Long Chen directly showed him Dongfang Yuyang’s head.

“Save me!” shouted Dongfang Yuyang. This was no substitute but his true body. Hence, he was filled with terror. He had never thought that such a day would come for him.

Now he was tasting something new, and he was even more afraid of death than ordinary disciples. His voice was filled with a sobbing tone.

That made the other experts look down on him even more. This was a peerless heavenly genius? A Heaven-Seizer? In front of death, he became a coward. Even an ordinary disciple wouldn’t act like this.

No one knew what kind of troubles Dongfang Yuyang had created in the Star Field Divine World, but for Long Chen to hate him so much, he definitely hadn’t done anything good.

Since he dared to do those things, he had to accept the consequences. Now, he was in Long Chen’s hands, shouting and wailing. Rather than resolving his predicament, it only made him a laughingstock before his death.

The day a person stepped onto the cultivation path, they had to face death. Even ordinary disciples understood this. However, Dongfang Yuyang was actually such a coward.

On the other hand, Long Chen didn’t show any courtesy even to a Sovereign sprout of the divine families. This was what being domineering meant. Long Chen didn’t show the slightest fear against anyone.

Ye Liangchen shouted, “Brat, you’re the one courting death. Don’t think that a hostage will protect you. Let me tell you, you were the one who blasphemed us back in the Immemorial Path. I, Ye Liangchen, have ten thousand ways to make you live a life worse than death. If you understand, then hurry up and-”

“So it was you!” Long Chen suddenly realized why his voice was so familiar.

Back then, when Yue Xiaoqian had been undergoing her tribulation in the Immemorial Path, the very heavens had been torn open, and four dislikeable fellows had appeared to undergo their own tribulations, implicating Yue Xiaoqian and almost getting her killed.

At that time, Long Chen had asked them to slow down, but the four of them had been exceedingly arrogant and hadn’t cared about Yue Xiaoqian’s life or death. Hence, Long Chen was enraged by that.

As soon as Yue Xiaoqian had passed her tribulation, seeing her bloody state, Long Chen had directly started his own tribulation, even attacking his tribulation to strengthen it.

That had caused the four of them to fail their tribulation, and they had fled. Even after so many years, Long Chen hadn’t forgotten about it.

When he had seen Zhao Ritian, those memories had been triggered. Amongst those four, it was Ye Liangchen who had given him the deepest impression.

In this world, the only one whose voice could make Long Chen want to slap them to death was probably Ye Liangchen.

Seeing Long Chen’s sudden realization, all the experts were speechless. Just what kind of monster was he? After creating such a deep grudge with someone, he had actually forgotten about them?

When Long Chen was in the Immemorial Path, he was nothing more than a cultivation rookie. However, he had actually managed to offend four Sovereign sprouts in that state. That kind of ability was truly amazing.

At this moment, the world gate slowly closed. The void shuddered and creaked, while countless cracks appeared in the sky.

Those balls of light also grew brighter, making the indistinct figures appear clearer, revealing their true appearances.

Now, Ye Liangchen was furious. His family had told him that they had found him a powerful subordinate. It was a Heaven-Seizer.

As long as Dongfang Yuyang was willing to make a spiritual contract with him, Dongfang Yuyang would become his eternal follower.

The reason the Dongfang family had done this was because they had no choice. The Ye family head had personally come to them.

If the Dongfang family had refused, the Ye family would have wiped them out. All the Ye family would have needed to do was announce Dongfang Yuyang’s status, and then the Dongfang family would be wiped out overnight.

The only reason they hadn’t done the spiritual contract earlier was because Dongfang Yuyang had entered the Star Field Divine World, while Ye Liangchen hadn’t been on the Martial Heaven Continent before.

They had to wait until Dongfang Yuyang returned to make the contract. However, the contract that they had discussed was double-sided.

Dongfang Yuyang had to be loyal to Ye Liangchen and never betray him, but Ye Liangchen was also bound. If Dongfang Yuyang died, his soul would receive a heavy blow.

It was only due to the second condition that the Dongfang family was willing to make Dongfang Yuyang Ye Liangchen’s subordinate. This would link the two families together, so it was a good thing for them.

As for the existence of a Heaven-Seizer, even to the Ye family, it was extremely shocking. A random investigation had somehow noticed some oddities about Dongfang Yuyang, and a deeper investigation had revealed this shocking secret.

If a Heaven-Seizer could be raised, they would definitely become a terrifying existence. That was why the Ye family would directly come to force the Dongfang family to submit.

Ye Liangchen had been looking forward to this new subordinate. As an expert, having another supreme expert as a subordinate was a kind of glory. It was even better than having a powerful mount.

That was why Ye Liangchen had sincerely wanted to protect Dongfang Yuyang. But Long Chen didn’t care about that.

“Long Chen, don’t misunderstand. Releasing him is your only chance of living. Once the world wall fades away, you will have a miserable death,” said Ye Liangchen sinisterly.

“What an idiot. If you know that I’m Long Chen, why would you threaten me?” Long Chen sneered. He sent Dongfang Yuyang’s head flying toward one of the balls of light. “Lingshan, here you go.”

That ball of light had turned dim, revealing Ye Lingshan. Her eyes flew open.

After that, Ye Lingshan’s sword came flying out of its sheath. Cold light slashed down.

“NO!”

Regretfully, with just his head and his power suppressed by Long Chen, Dongfang Yuyang could only watch as Ye Lingshan’s sword fell upon him. His head then exploded, with even his Yuan Spirit being wiped out of existence.

“Yuyang…”

The Dongfang family head let out a heart-wrenching cry. Dongfang Yuyang had died. Ye Lingshan’s sword had exterminated all hope for the Dongfang family.

BOOM

At this moment, the world gate finally slammed shut. The balls of light around everyone opened, and the world wall faded.

“Long Chen, I told you that I would make you live a life worse than death!” Ye Liangchen roared. His third eye suddenly opened.

Everyone instantly thought of the tortoise elder of the sea demon race who had been injured by this bizarre attack.

Suddenly, Long Chen unleashed a punch, and countless stars enveloped his fist. It was the same fist that had broken Dongfang Yuyang’s defenses.

While at first it seemed like he was striking nothing but air, when his punch reached its end, they saw a sharp blade filled with stars appear and strike Long Chen’s fist.

BOOM!

The void exploded and fragments of star light flew through the air. Huge ripples spread, causing the void to collapse wherever they went.

“If you want to get revenge, then come. As long as you’re not afraid of dying that is. Six Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen’s furious roar came from within those violent ripples. It was impossible to see him, but it suddenly felt as if the world had grown heavier and then lighter.

Everyone had felt like a giant boulder had been crushing them, and just as they resisted, the boulder vanished. They started floating into the sky.

Everyone was startled. What kind of domain was this? It was so strange.

However, before they could grow accustomed to this new lightness, a terrifying astral wind unfurled.

Everyone instinctively summoned their manifestations to block this astral wind. They stared in shock.

At this moment, they saw a figure with a giant divine ring. The six colors were like the heavens, while the six stars were like the earth. Long Chen appeared like the master of the world, with a pillar of light shooting out of him, blasting apart the clouds. The dark dusk that had covered the Martial Heaven Continent was blown away, revealing the stars.

The stars were like a sea reflecting the heavens. Beneath the dome of the sky was one man and one divine ring. When six stars revolved, the divine ring shook the very universe.

Just at this moment, a figure silently appeared behind Long Chen. Hence, Qu Jianying hastily cried out, “Long Chen, watch out!”

Everyone was shocked to find that one of the tortoise sea demon elders had attacked. Using a strange thorn in his hand, he stabbed toward Long Chen’s back. His sudden appearance was extremely bizarre, as it was impossible to sense him. He smiled sinisterly.

However, just at that moment, Long Chen’s figure vanished. When the elder saw that what he had stabbed was nothing more than an afterimage, his expression stiffened.

“Die! I’ll send you to see your young master!” Long Chen’s voice rang out behind him, and his fist landed squarely on the tortoise shell.

BOOM!

The tortoise shell exploded and bloody mist filled the air. An expert above the Netherpassage realm had been killed in one blow in front of everyone’s shocked gazes.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
