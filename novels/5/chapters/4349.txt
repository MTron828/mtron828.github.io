Chapter 4338 Millions of Split Bodies

The news of Long Chen helping people undergo their tribulations spread far and wide, and anyone from the human race or a race with positive affiliations with humanity was welcome to participate.

They only had to swear to never betray the human race and to keep righteousness in their hearts. Once this pledge was made, they could join the ranks of those undergoing their tribulations.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

With this, even factions that had bad relationships with Long Chen allowed their disciples to come. In any case, Long Chen’s actions had moved countless experts.

Countless heavenly geniuses flocked toward this place. Long Chen didn’t care about their talent or origins; as long as they came and took the oath, they could line up to undergo their tribulations.

However, too many people were undergoing their tribulations here that the sacred land did not have enough Heavenly Dao energy to maintain a constant tribulation. After a hundred thousand people went through a collective tribulation, the Heavenly Daos needed two hours to recover their depleted energy.

Long Chen felt that this was too slow. If they didn’t have to wait, they could undergo four tribulations during this period. As a result, Long Chen ordered the construction of a supreme-range transportation formation.

Once the tribulation was done in one area, Long Chen directly went through the transportation formation to another area. After all, the Nirvana Overflow Heaven had several sacred lands for undergoing tribulation.

After undergoing tribulation in one sacred land, Long Chen brought the next group to the second sacred land. The Heavenly Daos might need to recover their energy, but Long Chen didn’t, so they kept cycling through four sacred tribulation lands.

To protect the human race’s disciples while they underwent their tribulations, Long Chen had Lei Linger slaughter all the invaders who came to cause trouble. As a result, they were swiftly dealt with before they could even get close.

After every tribulation, Lei Linger’s power rose, gradually starting to exceed even Long Chen’s. Hence, the invaders simply had no chance to run. Faced with the combined swiftness of Long Chen and Lei Linger, they had no hope of fleeing.

Long Chen spent a whole day working, making countless experts grateful to him. Some experts even suggested him to rest while looking at him with worshipful eyes. After all, he was about to break through to the World King realm as well, and he shouldn’t delay his cultivation.

However, Long Chen dismissed their kind suggestions. He continued to work day and night to support these disciples. As countless people were moved by his generosity, Long Chen was overjoyed inside.

Lei Linger's growing power sent shivers down Long Chen's spine. Fortunately, she was not a pet but a cherished member of his family. Otherwise, her betrayal would definitely be fatal to him.

Lei Linger continued to grow stronger, but Long Chen didn’t reveal that to anyone. Her aura gradually reached a point where concealing it became increasingly challenging.

Therefore, Long Chen thought of a solution: having her split into nine bodies, dividing her power into nine equal portions. While the others rested, one continued to work. This would guarantee that her aura remained stable. As a result of this technique, over the next few days, tens of thousands of her split bodies emerged within the primal chaos space, each radiating a terrifying aura.

With Long Chen going crazy helping others undergo their tribulations across multiple sacred lands, tens of millions of heavenly geniuses managed to advance without a single casualty.

The number of people coming gradually diminished, and they no longer needed all four sacred lands. Four dwindled to three, three to two, and after twenty days, only the High Firmament Academy’s sacred land remained in operation.

Although the human race had plenty of heavenly geniuses, they eventually exhausted their reservoir of talents. Toward the end, it took several hours just to gather a hundred thousand people for their tribulations.

Lei Linger’s split bodies numbered in the millions now, and every single one of them possessed a terrifying aura.

At this moment, she couldn’t just merge them into one. It was because as soon as she did, she would undergo a qualitative change. After that, even if she split herself again, it would be useless as her aura would be fundamentally different.

Two days later, only seventy thousand people underwent a collective tribulation, and that was it.

“Is it over?”

Lei Linger was a bit disappointed. She still had room for improvement, but there were no more tribulations for her to gain power from.

“Lei Linger, let’s find a place for you to merge your split bodies. We’ll see what kind of results we got,” said Long Chen.

“Alright.” Lei Linger had long since wanted to merge, already itching to get on with it.

“Dean Long Chen, thank you!”

Tens of thousands of half-step Eternals cupped their fists toward Long Chen.

These elders were essentially living fossils and were only hanging on with their last breaths just to intimidate some of their mortal enemies.

The influx of primal chaos qi did not allow them to advance. However, it did increase their longevity by quite a bit. At the very least, they would still be around for a few extra centuries.

These old fellows had personally brought their disciples here to secure opportunities for them and to express their sincerity. Once their disciples finished their tribulations, they didn’t immediately leave. Instead, they stood with everyone else, guarding the sacred land.

Seeing that Long Chen was about to leave, they all thanked him together.

“Everyone, there’s no need for such formality. Helping others is in a way helping myself. However, I do have an important matter that I need your help with,” said Long Chen.

“Dean Long Chen, please speak. As long as we can do it, even if you want us to walk through burning oil, we will not hesitate,” said one elder.

Three disciples from his faction possessed immense talent, and following their tribulations, a trace of primal chaos qi had appeared in their manifestations, a symbol of them taking root in primal chaos. It signified that these disciples could potentially reach the Eternal realm. Witnessing this, the elder was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes.

After all, his sect had declined, and without his presence to provide a deterrent effect, his enemies could just attack and destroy his sect.

Now, he finally had descendants who could protect his legacy, and his sect no longer required the protection of an elderly individual who should have long rested in the grave. Thus, his gratitude toward Long Chen could not be expressed with mere words.

“Senior is being too serious. This junior still has matters to deal with, so if I may trouble everyone, please stay here for a few more days. If anyone else comes here, please protect them during their tribulations. Don’t let those troublemakers from the other worlds sneak attack them,” said Long Chen.

“Dean Long Chen, don’t worry. If we can’t even do such a small thing, we won’t have the face to see you. We’ll just dig a hole and bury ourselves to get it over with,” laughed an elder, and the others laughed with him. Hearing this, Long Chen nodded and waved goodbye. Seeing the warm gazes of this group of senior experts, Long Chen’s heart warmed a bit.

Humans were the most complicated, most fickle lifeform. Yet, the bright side of human nature was always the most touching. Since those sincere gazes could pass on their true feelings, just how wonderful would it be if human hearts could be a tad more straightforward?

Golden wings appeared on Long Chen’s back, and he flew off. An hour later, he landed in a desolate land.

BOOM!

The moment he arrived, millions of lightning dragons manifested in the air.

“Wait!” Long Chen suddenly cried out.

BOOM!

Unfortunately, his shout came out too late. The millions of lightning dragons instantly merged into one, plunging heaven and earth into eerie silence. Following that, an explosive aura erupted in every direction like an unstoppable tsunami.

The earth ruptured, and the void itself tore apart. Long Chen felt as though a shooting star had collided with him, causing blood to spew from his mouth.

“You foolish child! I already told you to wait!”
