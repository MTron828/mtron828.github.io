Chapter 4434 Ten Thousand Dragon Nest

The void ruptured like a fractured mirror, revealing an enormous object moving through it. It resembled a mountain covered in honeycomb-like caves.

“Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!”

Numerous startled exclamations rang out as people recognized this colossal object—a giant dragon nest made from mostly bones of innumerable dragons over countless years.

This unique nest was a fusion of lives from generations of dragons, incorporating their bones, blood, and souls. It transcended being a mere nest, serving as a sanctuary for later generations to thrive, rest, and engage in battle. Its power could destroy heaven and earth.

When this Ten Thousand Dragon Nest appeared, even Eternal experts were suffocated by its terrifying aura. The sheer terror it emanated paralyzed them, leaving them hesitant to make a single move.

Black qi roiled on top of it, and its aura seemed to force heaven and earth to submit.

No one had expected the nether dragon race to mobilize their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. After all, this was their strongest, most priceless inheritance. Just what was going on?

“Hehe, are they trying to intimidate us? How laughable. My boss isn’t one to be frightened so easily,” sneered Guo Ran.

Despite him sneering, he was also shocked. This Ten Thousand Dragon Nest could be considered a gigantic ancient divine weapon, a culmination of the nether dragon race’s terrifying foundation.

For a mere duel, the nether dragon race had brought out their entire nest, showing off an overwhelming and oppressive aura. Although it felt a bit childish, the sheer terror evoked by the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was undeniable. In deploying it, the nether dragon race had undeniably intimidated most experts here.

“Their objective is probably beyond mere intimidation,” remarked Ye Ling solemnly. “The nether dragon race is showcasing their power and determination. They want Netherdragon Tianzhao to recruit followers.”

“Recruit followers? What’s that mean?” asked Guo Ran.

“Awakened Doyens have a complete Doyen divine radiance and Doyen divine seal. With these two, if they wish, they can sacrifice a portion of their power to help budding Doyens awaken. However, their divine radiance and divine seal are part of their core energy, so using them to awaken others comes at an immense price and also poses some danger. As a result, Doyens will not help others lightly unless those people are willing to bear a slave seal. Unless someone consents to become their loyal servant, Doyens won’t help others become Doyens, even their own blood.”

“So that’s the case. The nether dragon race is planning on using this battle to show Netherdragon Tianzhao’s power and attract budding Doyens,” muttered Long Chen. That was quite the plan.

“As the first awakened Doyen of the nine heavens and ten lands, Netherdragon Tianzhao wants to maintain his superiority. Otherwise, once others awaken, he will no longer be special. This is why he was in a rush to fight as soon as he became a Doyen. In truth, even if you hadn’t slain Netherdragon Tianye, he would have still challenged you since you are the Sage King,” explained Ye Ling.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s challenge toward Long Chen appeared to be revenge for his little brother, but there was an even greater meaning behind it. The nether dragon race wanted to borrow this chance to shake the world and recruit experts.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

For this purpose, they had even brought out their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, conveying to the budding Doyens that this was a golden opportunity for them.

However, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest alone wasn’t sufficient; another crucial condition had to be fulfilled. Netherdragon Tianzhao had to either kill or defeat Long Chen, the Sage King of this era. Achieving this would undoubtedly sway numerous budding Doyens to align with the nether dragon race.

Their targets were the talented heavenly geniuses without powerful backgrounds. If they flocked toward the nether dragon race, Netherdragon Tianzhao would have countless fighting servants, and the nether dragon race’s power would reach an unprecedented height.

“Hahaha, they’re thinking quite far ahead. Is the nether dragon race really so confident? Do they think that Netherdragon Tianzhao will definitely win against me?” laughed Long Chen as he eyed the enormous Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Just then, the colossal nest touched down on the ground, surrounded by swirling black qi. It seemed as if an entire world had just descended, evoking an indescribable sensation.

A massive gate then opened at the heart of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. One figure after another came out of the black qi, and their leader was a golden-robed elder with a golden crown and belt.

Long Chen’s pupils contracted. When the elder directed his gaze at him, Long Chen experienced a sharp pain in his soul, as if an invisible hand had seized hold of it. The sensation was utterly terrifying.

“A Saint.”

Long Chen let out a cold gasp of air. This Saint was not like the red-haired monster he had encountered in the humanless world; this was a genuine Saint.

“With the support of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, his realm isn’t suppressed within its range. Long Chen, you have to be careful,” Ye Ling cautioned.

Despite being a fellow Saint, her realm was suppressed here. However, the elder faced no such thing. Empowered by the nest, he was unrivaled and could exterminate all existence with a mere thought.

Behind this elder was a young man with a similar golden crown and robes, looking somewhat similar to Netherdragon Tianye. Long Chen directly knew that he was Netherdragon Tianzhao.

When people looked at him, they couldn’t help but let out startled cries. The budding Doyens in particular harbored fervent and envious gazes.

Netherdragon Tianzhao bore a golden sun at the back of his head. What triggered envy among the budding Doyens was not Netherdragon Tianzhao himself, but the radiant golden sun he possessed.

The golden sun illuminated the world in its divine light, and people could see spheres of light fill the entire heaven. Those spheres of light were somehow prostrating themselves to Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Those spheres were originally invisible, but when they were illuminated by Netherdragon Tianzhao’s golden sun, they materialized dazzlingly.

“Is this the essence of the Heavenly Daos? Are the Heavenly Daos prostrating themselves toward him? He is the god of this world!”

“So this is a true Heavenly Doyen? He hasn’t even unleashed his aura, but everyone’s soul is already quivering. There’s no resisting him.”

“A true Heavenly Doyen has finally appeared. The strongest heavenly genius of this era is right here. Netherdragon Tianzhao is unstoppable.”

Numerous people were excited by his appearance. Seeing a true Heavenly Doyen, the budding Heavenly Doyens felt like they were glimpsing their future selves.

“You are Long Chen?”

Just then, that crowned elder of the nether dragon race spoke.
