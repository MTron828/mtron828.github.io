Chapter 4667 The Hand of the Heavens Reappears

Long Chen brought the massive sword crashing down with formidable force, attacking the giant tribulation cloud in the sky. The blade sliced through the lightning and the tribulation cloud.

A long cut appeared in the cloud. It wasn’t very deep, but it spread throughout the entire range of the tribulation cloud. Seeing that Long Chen’s attack was so weak, Luo Changsheng was about to mock him when the tribulation cloud suddenly contracted.

Following that, a wild destructive will filled the world. Before this, if the tribulation was an examiner indifferently following the rules, this attack from Long Chen was like a slap in its face, causing the tribulation to want to kill everyone here.

The people in the tribulation were all shocked. They were the strongest Heavenly Doyens, the favorites of heaven and earth. The Heavenly Daos had once felt like a nurturing mother to them, but now, it seemed to have transformed into a malevolent stepmother. The comforting warmth had vanished, replaced by a chilling desire for destruction.

Long Chen had angered the tribulation, causing it to seemingly lose its mind. It wanted to destroy Long Chen, implicating all of them in the process.

“As expected, you really are a treacherous little bastard! You’re trying to use this tribulation to drag us all down with you? It’s a nice idea but very foolish,” sneered Luo Changsheng.

“Long Chen, I thought that you had some peerless trump card. However, it seems that I overestimated you. You want to use heavenly tribulation against us? What a joke,” said Yu Zihao at this time.

“You’re incurably foolish. We are the strongest Heavenly Doyens in this world, and the fate of the heavens is on us. How could the Heavenly Daos target us? You’re only killing yourself,” added Fallen Daynight’s disciple.

Although Long Chen had angered the tribulation, causing them all to sense immense pressure from it, they had undergone many heavenly tribulations and refused to believe that the tribulation would really target them.

For example, Yan Tianhua had devoured other people’s tribulations, and that was completely against the laws of the Heavenly Daos, and yet the Heavenly Daos still favored him. There were no karmic retributions for his actions. This was the special treatment for a nine-star Heavenly Doyen, so these people were not afraid of heavenly tribulation.

Long Chen ignored them. After his attack, he patiently waited. As expected, the tribulation cloud started to disintegrate. The giant hole above Long Chen then shattered and spread in every direction.

One by one, the tribulation holes of the nine-star Doyens were engulfed, merging with Long Chen's own tribulation. Now united under a single torrent of lightning, the laws of the heavenly tribulation no longer restrained them from fighting each other.

A lifeform with two wings and a single horn seemed to refuse to accept the turn of events. The moment that his tribulation merged with Long Chen’s, he shot over, summoning his manifestation and a spear.

His manifestation covered the sky. Others were unable to even see what it was before his spear sucked it to strengthen itself.

In an instant, he crossed the originally immense distance between them, launching his spear at Long Chen.

Long Chen raised his hand and caught the tip of the spear.

“Hahaha, die!” That lifeform laughed. His horn then lit up, emanating a ray of divine light that shot at Long Chen.

It dawned on the onlookers that they had been deceived; the spear was merely a diversion. The true killing blow lay in the horn.

However, just as he attacked, he heard startled cries echoing from the distance. Assuming they were marveling at his cunning ruse, he focused on his target, unaware of the looming danger.

To his horror, a colossal hand materialized above him, its six fingers casting a shadow over both him and Long Chen. An overwhelming divine pressure descended along with it, suffocating the atmosphere. In an instant, the divine light of his attack dimmed under the oppressive force of the giant hand.

“What?!”

An attack that had slain countless powerful foes for him, containing his full power, silently crumbled today.

He finally became aware of the massive six-fingered hand descending upon him from above. With panic gripping his heart, he attempted to retreat, only to realize that his spear was still firmly gripped by Long Chen’s hand. He tried to pull it back, only to find that his power seemed to be impeded by some law.

“Power of the Six Daos, the hand of the heavens!”

The Dragonblood warriors’ expressions changed. They recalled vividly how this same hand had nearly ended Long Chen’s life during his World King tribulation, serving as the final and most formidable attack.

Now, this hand manifested as the very first attack of Long Chen’s Divine Venerate tribulation. Although they knew that their boss’s heavenly tribulations were always intense, they hadn’t expected it to be so vicious.

With a deafening crash, the giant hand descended, causing the hearts of the Dragonblood warriors to constrict with dread. They alone understood the sheer terror and destructive power of this devastating blow.

BOOM!

Long Chen remained unyielding as the massive hand crashed down upon the two of them. To everyone’s astonishment, a peculiar scene unfolded: Long Chen stood firm, unmoved by the impact, while the hand itself shattered upon striking him.

The force of the blow sent shockwaves rippling through the ground, shaking the very foundation of the world. Everyone could sense just how powerful this blow was.

Looking at Long Chen, they saw him hovering in the air just like before, his hair and robes billowing around him. He appeared at complete ease and unspeakably arrogant.

The spear was still in his hand, but the horned lifeform was gone, having been obliterated by the hand of the heavens. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The hand of the heavens was embedded in the ground. A chill swept through the onlookers’ hearts as they gazed from the gaping hole to Long Chen.

Even Luo Changsheng and the others’ expressions changed. They had been thinking that the heavenly tribulation wouldn’t attack them, the favored sons of the heavens.

Yet, the stark reality presented itself with the imprint of that single hand. Long Chen was fine, but the nine-star Heavenly Doyen had been wiped out of existence.

With a casual wave of his hand, Long Chen sent the spear flying through the tribulation toward Gu Yang.

“Thank you, Boss!” Gu Yang happily caught the spear, as his old spear was broken.

Long Chen advanced toward Luo Changsheng, each step echoing with an ominous rhythm. His voice carried an eerie, emotionless tone.

“Are you ready to meet your maker?”
