Chapter 4430 Jiang Clan’s Heavenly Genius

Heavenly Fiend Prefecture was an empty wasteland permeated with an oppressive air of decay. It was like inhaling even a single breath in this desolate place would age a person rapidly.

This region was not suitable for cultivators to live in, and the strange atmosphere proved unsettling for both humans and other races alike. Only some low-level insects and rats scurried around beneath the surface. It was literally a land of death.

To Long Chen’s surprise though, when they arrived, this place was bustling with activity. Grand formations had appeared on top of mountains, gathering sparse spiritual qi.

Seeing that there wasn’t enough spiritual qi in this area, people were willing to extract the primal chaos qi from their primal chaos spirit stones to maintain their formations here.

It was because these mountains had grand peering formations. After all, the spectators didn’t want to get close to Life End Mountain or Dragon Extinction Ridge. For a battle on this level, getting too close would be fatal.

However, if they were too far, they wouldn’t be able to see clearly. Thus, they chose this location and used formations to watch—a safe, efficient, and painless solution.

When Guo Ran’s flying boat passed over them, Long Chen and his companions felt their blood quickening in their veins. The further they went, the more formations they saw. They then quickly arrived at an endless black mountain range.

This mountain range was as black as ink, devoid of a single blade of grass. True to its name, Life End Mountain, all signs of life had long vanished from this desolate place.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

At the center of this mountain was a giant ridge that looked like a wriggling dragon cutting the Life End Mountain in two.

Where the head of this dragon should be was a giant chasm. If someone looked at it from the sky, the whole picture looked like a dragon without a head. Thus, this place was called Dragon Extinction Ridge.

There were so many legends about this place. However, those legends were so ancient that there was no way to confirm them.

All people knew was that there had once been a world-destroying clash that severed the vitality of this place, turning it into a land of death.

Now, numerous people were surrounding Life End Mountain. Although they were spectators, those who dared to come here were all peak heavenly geniuses or Eternal experts. As a result, they were full of themselves and disdained to use formations to watch the battle.

After all, a formation could only provide a two-dimensional viewing experience. It lacked the depth, the tangible auras, and the pressure of an actual battle, making it far from immersive.

Today was the day of the immense battle, so a sea of people had long since gathered here. Heavenly geniuses of various factions had come from different worlds just to watch this fight.

When Guo Ran’s flying boat arrived, it drew everyone’s attention, and the chattering came to a sudden halt. The silence was suffocating.

After the flying boat came to a stop, Long Chen walked out of it while holding Little Crane’s hand. Instantly, millions of sharp gazes concentrated on him.

Ninety-nine percent of those gazes harbored hostility. Suspicion, disdain, provocation, and in some instances, dense killing intent emanated from them.

Confronted with those sharp gazes, perhaps someone else would have crumbled under the oppressive pressure. However, Long Chen was completely unfazed.

A lifetime of battles had rendered him immune to such minor intimidations, and being scrutinized by a multitude of hostile idiots was nothing new for him.

In contrast, Little Crane found the attention of so many people unsettling. She tightened her grip on Long Chen’s hand, clearly discomforted by the intense scrutiny.

“What a dense bad aura,” said Little Crane.

Of course, it was dense. Those who could come here were true experts—individuals who were not raised in the farm but on the battlefied.

Every expert here had experienced many bloody battles. When they unleashed their hostility, that terrifying aura made ordinary people’s souls quiver.

Let alone Little Crane, even a Saint like Ye Ling couldn’t help but frown, feeling very uncomfortable with so many people gazing at her.

On the other hand, the Dragonblood warriors were all relaxed, following Long Chen without a care.

Amongst the Dragonblood warriors, Guo Ran was looking left and right, his gaze sweeping through the crowd excitedly.

“Damn, there are so many people! If they were to attack me all at once, I wonder if my armor would be able to block them all?” Guo Ran snickered. Despite stating a worry, that smile on his face looked like he needed a beating. This was clearly a low-grade way of showing off.

“Long Chen, it’s been a long time. I missed you.”

Just as they all got out of the flying boat, a burst of fragrance blew over, and Feng Fei walked over with a smile.

In truth, Feng Fei didn’t have much of a relationship with Long Chen, and they could not be considered friends. However, Feng Fei still greeted him as if they were close friends.

“It really has been a long time. How are you?” Long Chen returned Feng Fei’s greeting. However, he was then startled, noticing a strange aura on her—a bit similar to that of Netherdragon Tianye.

“Oh? You even see through this? I only awakened a trace of a Doyen’s qi thanks to my clan’s help. I can’t even be considered a budding Heavenly Doyen yet.” Seeing his gaze, Feng Fei smiled and looked behind him. “Oh, where is that beautiful jealous girl of yours? Can I step a bit closer this time?”

The jealous girl she spoke about was Tang Wan-er. Last time, Tang Wan-er had expressed immense hostility toward Feng Fei, giving her a deep impression. That was why she maintained a set distance toward Long Chen this time.

Long Chen was speechless. If Tang Wan-er were really in the flying boat or in the crowd, Feng Fei would have just poked a hornet’s nest.

“It’s not good to gossip about others behind their backs!” Bai Shishi asserted.

Long Chen was taken aback. Bai Shishi was actually speaking up for Tang Wan-er? His heart warmed. It seemed that Bai Shishi already considered Tang Wan-er one of her people. As she didn’t have Yu Qingxuan’s magnanimity, she was naturally displeased that someone else would talk about Tang Wan-er badly.

“My apologies. It was my mistake to make a joke like that. I hope Fairy Shishi doesn’t take offense.” Even though Bai Shishi’s words were sharp, Feng Fei didn’t mind at all. She apologized while smiling frankly, surprising everyone.

After all, Feng Fei was a heavenly genius of the Heavenly Divinity race’s Jiang clan, and there were already indications that she would lead the junior generation. No one had expected her to be so nice.

“Miss Feng Fei, do you have any advice for me?” asked Long Chen, not wanting to waste time on this.

“I came to introduce you to a few of my friends.” Feng Fei waved his hand, and a group of people walked out from behind her.

When Long Chen saw who they were, his pupils shrank slightly.
