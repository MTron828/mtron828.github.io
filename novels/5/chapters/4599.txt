Chapter 4588 Netherdragon Blood Massacre

At some unknown point, the sky above them became covered in lightning clouds. When the Netherdragon race’s experts wanted to assist Netherdragon Tianzhao, a torrent of lightning swords descended upon them.

“Watch out!”

Their expressions shifted abruptly as they realized they had overlooked Lei Linger's presence. In an instant, they found themselves ensnared by lightning swords.

Blood flowed as the lightning swords slew the weaker ones. The swords easily tore through their ranks, leaving behind a gruesome sight.

However, the Netherdragon race indeed had plenty of powerful experts. More than ten seven-star Heavenly Doyens surged forward, their dragon spears converging on Lei Linger simultaneously.

Unexpectedly, their movements were identical, and their energies mixed in a similar form to a formation.

BOOM!

A lightning spear swept through the air, sending them all flying and hacking up blood. In front of Lei Linger, their combined power was just a stinky fart. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Netherdragon Essence Blood Heaven Earth Lock!”

All of a sudden, the seven-star Doyens shouted at the same time, and the blood they had vomited out transformed into runes that linked into chains, which then weaved into a giant net.

Lei Linger hadn’t expected these experts to have such a combination technique. The runic net covered her before she could react.

Unable to dodge, Lei Linger just snorted and extended a hand toward the net.

BOOM!

Lei Linger’s thunderforce erupted, rumbling the chain net, causing countless cracks to cover it. However, to her surprise, this strange net didn’t break apart. Even while using the power of Saint lightning, she couldn’t break this net.

She suddenly had a bad feeling and summoned a lightning spear in her right hand, tearing at the net. The net was tough, but now that it was damaged, she was confident that she could break it.

At this moment, every survivor of the Netherdragon race unleashed a combined roar. A blood-colored chain surged forth from their ranks, entwining itself around the perimeter of the chain net.

When Lei Linger’s attack landed, the net trembled, and all of those Netherdragon experts grunted together.

Her expression then changed as she realized that the net had not only blocked her attack but also transmitted the damage to all of those experts. Her power was rendered ineffective, unable to cause any substantial damage.

Who would have expected the Netherdragon race to possess such a defensive technique? Just as she tried to think of a way to escape, the ground burst open, and another chain net appeared beneath her. After that, the two nets merged, completely trapping her.

With nowhere to go, she struggled with all her power, but she couldn’t do anything as millions of Netherdragon experts jointly withstood her attacks.

Seeing Lei Linger trapped, the top experts of the Netherdragon race shot after Long Chen.

They knew they couldn’t kill Lei Linger, so they just hoped to trap her for a while. Their goal was solely to save Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Die!”

The first one to reach Long Chen thrust his spear at Long Chen’s back. This powerful seven-star Doyen unleashed his full power without hesitation, abandoning all defenses. His sole intent was to sacrifice himself if it meant killing Long Chen.

BOOM!

Just as the spear was about to make contact with Long Chen, Long Chen moved in a strange way, causing the spear to veer off course and thrust directly toward Netherdragon Tianzhao's chest.

“What...?” That expert was startled but was in no position to withdraw his attack.

BOOM!

Netherdragon Tianzhao was indeed pierced in the chest, but at that moment, his protective divine light flared up, deflecting the spear with a burst of power. The expert spat out blood as a result.

His attack couldn’t damage Netherdragon Tianzhao’s defense which was bolstered by the power of the Nether Emperor, and he faced the backlash because of it.

Just as he spat out blood, Long Chen’s foot crashed into his chest. Utilizing a twisting force, Long Chen's hand sliced through the air with precision.

This expert’s attack disturbed Long Chen’s tempo, prompting Netherdragon Tianzhao to use the chance to retreat. However, how could Long Chen give him that chance? If Netherdragon Tianzhao managed to create distance again, Long Chen's advantage would vanish.

The next moment, Long Chen’s hand struck the fleeing Netherdragon Tianzhao right in the face, eliciting startled cries from the onlookers.

Long Chen was practically twisting horizontally in the air, his foot and hand swinging and striking almost simultaneously. The onlookers were mesmerized by this unprecedented and bizarre movement.

Just when Netherdragon Tianzhao thought he had escaped, Long Chen resumed his slapping gig again, unleashing a barrage of slaps with both hands. Netherdragon Tianzhao was caught by the slapping maestro again, powerless to stop this madness.

The spectators were astounded by the spectacle unfolding before them. It was both comedic and awe-inspiring, leaving them deeply shocked by Long Chen's incredible power.

In the eyes of the spectators, Long Chen wasn’t even trying to kill Netherdragon Tianzhao; he was just toying with him, intentionally humiliating him. It was as if Long Chen had Netherdragon Tianzhao in the palm of his hand—or rather, with the palm of his hand.

Little did they know that Long Chen did try to kill Netherdragon Tianzhao, but the lucky bastard was protected by the power of the Nether Emperor, so Long Chen was unable to kill him.

Unable to really injure Netherdragon Tianzhao, Long Chen sought comfort in humiliating his soul. Long Chen’s phantom-like movement art enabled him to slap Netherdragon Tianzhao’s face from all angles.

Like before, Netherdragon Tianzhao folded his arms around his head to prevent Long Chen from slapping him. As a result, Long Chen grabbed his hair and slammed his knee into Netherdragon Tianzhao’s nose again. A familiar sound that made people wince echoed in the air once more.

Seeing that familiar sight, everyone stood in silence. Were they back to the start?

The only difference this time was that the Netherdragon race’s experts were coming to assist Netherdragon Tianzhao. However, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao were spinning all around the place. If they were to attack recklessly, they might hit Netherdragon Tianzhao.

They tried to unleash probing blows to stop their spinning but couldn’t find a good opportunity. After a while, panic started to set in their dumb lizard heads.

“You idiots, what are these attacks?! Use the Netherdragon Blood Massacre!” Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, only for Long Chen’s knee to smash his teeth apart and cut him off.

“But...” Those experts hesitated. If they were to unleash that attack with their combined power, what if they killed Netherdragon Tianzhao?

“Hurry up!” roared Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Clenching their teeth, the seven-star Doyens suddenly raised their spears together. A chilling aura then enveloped Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao.
