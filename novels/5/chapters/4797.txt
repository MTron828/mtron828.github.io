Chapter 4786 Destroying a Heaven Saint’s Divine Weapon

“Evilmoon, prepare yourself,” said Long Chen as he covered his ears with a sinister smile.

“Damn, you really are evil. But I like it!” Evilmoon cried out in delight. It hadn’t expected Long Chen to spare the Earth Saint so he could draw out a Heaven Saint.

The blood soul of a powerful expert, the item-spirits imbued within Saint weapons, or even the natural essence of such weapons—all served as great nourishment for Evilmoon, supplying the energy needed to unravel its seals.

Although Evilmoon had successfully devoured the Emperor Blood Silk Net, its power was so powerful that Evilmoon struggled to refine it. In contrast, while the power of a Saint weapon was strong, it was something Evilmoon could directly refine. After absorbing the energy of Yue Wuxu’s Saint weapon, Evilmoon sensed that its power had risen a great deal. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to slice through those thousand mountains, destroy the Earth Saint’s divine weapon, and deal a grievous blow to him.

Absorbing the energy of Saint weapons had an almost instantaneous effect on Evilmoon, and Long Chen had prepared another gift for it.

BOOM!

Just as countless people were stunned by the Heaven Saint’s attack, an unremarkable cauldron suddenly hurtled toward it, triggering a heaven-shaking collision that rent numerous fragments of spacetime asunder. The very earth quaked, and the cracks even extended throughout the void.

This huge collision made even Long Chen feel like his head was about to split open. Terrifying ripples spread from the epicenter, blasting apart his scales and causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Run!”

Seeing those terrifying ripples spread, many people panicked.

“There’s no time! Get in groups and defend!” shouted an Earth Saint.

There was no time to run. Any Divine Venerate disciples who were caught up by these ripples would be instantly annihilated, so they had to work together if they wanted to keep everyone safe.

Fortunately, after that shout, the various factions chose to join forces quickly, and together, they stopped these ripples. After everything was over, they turned their attention back to the battlefield.

“What is that? Did it block the Heaven Saint’s divine weapon?” asked someone. Hearing this, everyone saw an enormous spear stabbing into that unremarkable bronze cauldron, but the bronze cauldron wasn’t budging at all.

After that, a strange sound pierced through the consciousness of every individual present, resonating with clarity in their ears. Though seemingly light and subtle, its impact was as jarring as the deafening roar of thunder.

“The cauldron’s going to explode!”

“No, the cracks are on the spear...!”

Everyone stared in shock at the silver spear as they found that countless cracks were appearing on the silver spear. It looked like it would explode at any moment.

“Fuck, how useless. You only have this little bit of power?”

Seeing this, Long Chen hastily rushed back and swung Evilmoon toward the silver spear.

Originally, Long Chen had thought that this spear would explode upon contact with the Earth Cauldron. Although the Earth Cauldron wouldn’t let itself be used for offense, Long Chen could still use it to block attacks. Given the strength, any weapon that they threw at the Earth Cauldron would explode.

However, Long Chen hadn’t expected this Heaven Saint divine weapon to be a coward. Sensing the imminent danger posed by the Earth Cauldron, it instinctively retracted ninety percent of its power just moments before impact. It was due to this act of self-preservation that it didn’t instantly explode, yet it was still badly damaged and needed time to recover.

How could Long Chen give it that chance though? He quickly attacked. At the same time, a furious roar came from the other side of the gate, accompanied by an outstretched hand.

Ignoring the distraction, Long Chen directed Evilmoon to collide with the silver spear, resulting in a great explosion of silver light as the divine weapon shattered into pieces.

Moments later, the echo of the Heaven Saint spitting out blood reverberated through the air. Clearly, destroying his soul-linked divine weapon had caused a serious injury to him.

As the silver dust dispersed throughout the atmosphere, Evilmoon swiftly absorbed it. Its black surface now had silver dust on it, like a starry river in the endless cosmos. All of a sudden, Evilmoon’s aura grew explosively.

“Perfect!” Evilmoon cried out excitedly.

After destroying the silver spear, Long Chen pressed on relentlessly. Evilmoon gleamed with brilliance as it slashed at the hand sticking out of the gate.

Long Chen’s movements, swift as lightning yet appearing effortless, flowed smoothly like a dance. Rather than displaying haste, his motions looked natural, leaving numerous experts dazed by his smooth movements.

They were so terrified by the Heaven Saint that they couldn’t even move. However, Long Chen was still moving naturally, looking like a battle god that would never tire or submit no matter who the opponent was.

At the same time, Sword Qi descended in concert with Long Chen’s attack, as Yue Zifeng joined the fray. Their combined assault consisted of one fierce and domineering slash from Long Chen and one majestic and boundless slash from Yue Zifeng. Though differing in speed, their strikes landed in perfect unison, showcasing flawless cooperation between the two.

BOOM!

The sword and saber crossed over that enormous hand, blasting it apart. The next moment, the space around Yue Zifeng twisted, and he vanished.

Meanwhile, Long Chen remained where he was. Powerful gusts blew back his hair, but he stood steady like a boulder, staring coldly at the gate.

“It’s too bad. If you had boss’s powerful physical body, standing by boss’s side would make you appear even cooler!” said Guo Ran with a hint of regret. Yue Zifeng now stood beside him.

When Yue Zifeng entered and left the battlefield, it was all thanks to Bai Xiaole’s pupil arts. Bai Xiaole had become an indispensable member of the Dragonblood Legion.

After all, Yue Zifeng’s constitution was too weak, and the aftermath of that attack wasn’t something that he could endure. However, while Guo Ran sighed, Yue Zifeng shook his head, completely indifferent to showing off and looking cool.

By working together with Long Chen, Yue Zifeng destroyed that hand. However, he didn’t look excited and was shocked instead.

Despite sustaining a serious injury from the destruction of his silver spear, the Heaven Saint still posed a formidable threat, albeit his hand was significantly weakened. Even so, it required the two of them to join forces and go all-out against it, which meant that a Heaven Saint was simply not an existence that could even be mentioned in the same sentence as an Earth Saint. They were on entirely different levels. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Furthermore, this confrontation occurred across space. If the Heaven Saint were to descend in person, perhaps they would be unable to withstand a single attack from him.

Sensing the imminent danger, Long Chen waved his hand and put away the Earth Cauldron. In response, the gate trembled violently before abruptly expanding, unleashing a surge of killing intent from the other side.

“A Heaven Saint is going to personally descend!” A startled cry rang out.
