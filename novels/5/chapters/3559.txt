Chapter 3548

“That should be what I say to you. You are Yan Xu’s son? Then the one in the Darklight Heaven that devoured the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy should be your father. My enmity with your father is as deep as the sea. As for you, you harmed my lover. If I don’t kill you today, I won’t be Long Chen.” Long Chen looked at Yan Hong. At this moment, the True Fire Sword in his hand vanished, and he reached back for the Minghong Saber.

“That was my big brother!” corrected Yan Hong coldly.

“Your dad, your brother, whatever. I’ll kill them all eventually. I’ll kill you first, then your big brother, and then your father, until you’re all wiped out.” When Long Chen’s hand grasped the Minghong saber, his clothes began to flutter despite there being no breeze. His sharp killing intent was already firmly locked onto Yan Hong.

“Long Chen, it’s no good. He has a strange energy that can extract all your flame energy. We have to run now!” transmitted Yu Qingxuan when she saw his rising battle intent.

She had yet to awaken the Heavenly Rainbow manifestation and was countered by Yan Hong’s power. As for Long Chen, he didn’t even have a Heavenly Flame in the top ten rankings. She was worried that he would die.

Although the look that Long Chen had given her before had filled her with confidence, this new look in his eyes made that confidence vanish. After all, that was Yan Xu’s son.

Yan Xu was said to be the strongest flame within the nine heavens and ten lands, capable of devouring all ten thousand flames. His son was definitely an extremely terrifying existence.

“I know his power, but I’m not afraid of him. I’ll have Huo Linger help you recover some energy. Go into your war chariot and wait. Once I slaughter him, I’ll help you recover,” said Long Chen. A flame dragon then flew out and wrapped around Yu Qingxuan’s body.

When Huo Linger’s energy entered Yu Qingxuan’s body, she was startled. She instantly recovered a trace of energy. After consuming a medicinal pill, she entered the war chariot.

Yan Hong wasn’t the slightest bit panicked to see her retreat. It seemed that everything was within his control, and he coldly looked at Long Chen.

“Hm, your body also contains devouring energy. You have the ability to devour flames as well? Just who are you?”

His response was the Minghong Saber coming out of its sheath. Long Chen’s divine ring then shook behind him and 108,000 stars appeared within it. Instantly, his aura was unleashed to the limit.

“Split the Heavens 2!”

All the energy that he had been storing up was unleashed in this celestial blade. Saber Qi crashed down, suffocating the very world.

This time, Yan Hong was no longer careless. Having experienced Long Chen’s immense power, Yan Hong summoned a pair of black wings on his back. When they manifested, the ten thousand Daos rumbled.

“My Yan Xu race is the ruler of all flames. Who do you think you are?” Yan Hong sneered. His wings quivered, and that black spear of his pierced forward like the devil’s venomous fang.

BOOM!

A blood-red saber and a black spear clashed. At the same time, red and black lights shattered the ten thousand Daos, and endless runes of spacetime flew about, producing surging qi waves that blew away countless Heavenly Flame Spirits.

Other than the three Heavenly Flame Spirits at the core, a giant space instantly emptied within this chaotic battlefield.

Up in the sky, Long Chen’s black robes and hair fluttered. Holding the Minghong Saber, he pressed down on that black spear with overwhelming power. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen’s Blood Qi was shaking along with his 108,000 stars, and endless energy was gushing out. It was like the flame of a furnace growing hotter and hotter. Qi waves continuously battered this world, and this scene horrified countless people.

Seeing Long Chen’s current appearance, Yu Qingxuan’s eyes moistened without her even being aware of it.

For some reason, this furious expression of his seemed familiar to her, and it shook the softest part of her heart.

Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others were shocked. They had always been looking down on Long Chen, thinking that his greatest skill was only his glib tongue. Other than conning people with his shameless traps, he wasn’t supposed to have any ability.

But now that he was going all-out, they realized that his power was actually so immense.

“Devouring the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, harming my lover, even if you are Yan Xu’s son, you won’t escape your death today.” Long Chen’s power continued to crazily climb. It was as if he had endless power welling up. With a thunderous shout, his arms crashed down.

BOOM!

Yan Hong was finally unable to endure any longer and was blown back by this saber. With just one step back, Long Chen’s aura was like a river free from a dam, and he unleashed thirty-six blows in one go.

Yan Hong repeatedly blocked, with every blow causing him to take another step back. The ground beneath his feet crumbled.

He was clearly drawing Long Chen’s power underground, using the lowest price to block his attacks.

“This Yan Hong really is terrifying. Even though Long Chen isn’t using flame energy, he is still managing to dispel Long Chen’s energy. What kind of monstrous power is he?”

Hidden in the dark, Feng Xiang stared in shock at Yan Hong. Yan Hong was a perfect counter for flame cultivators. Even Yu Qingxuan who was in control of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was constrained, so others weren’t even close to a match for him.

Moreover, even when Long Chen wasn’t using flame energy, Yan Hong was still capable of using his strange power to dispel Long Chen’s attacks. Just who in the world was capable of fighting him?

Although the Yan Xu Flame was said to be the strongest flame in the nine heavens and ten lands, capable of burning all things and devouring the ten thousand flames, for it to be able to counter other kinds of energy completely surpassed the scope of people’s understanding.

“Did you think that you could beat me just by not using flame energy? What a ridiculous thought. I have an undying, indestructible flame body. In front of me, your attacks are useless. You cannot harm my core. Furthermore, in the Heavenly Flame World, my power is endless. I am constantly replenishing it. You want to exhaust my power?” Yan Hong sneered as he blocked Long Chen’s attacks.

No matter how Long Chen attacked, no matter how much of a storm he unleashed, and no matter how powerful his aura grew, Yan Hong still seemed to feel that victory was within his grasp.

“Undying and indestructible? There is no such thing in front of me. Once I kill you, you will understand just how much of a joke your undying, indestructible body is,” snorted Long Chen. After that, the Minghong Saber swung through the air faster and faster, stronger and stronger.

Every blow caused the world to change color. At some point, countless black threads appeared in the void. Long Chen’s sharp Saber Qi was cutting apart space.

Everyone was shocked by this. Long Chen’s power was continuously climbing as if there was no limit. No one could tell when it would stop.

As Long Chen’s aura continuously climbed, so did Yan Hong’s power. Their fight caused the entire Heavenly Flame World to start quivering.

Everyone was shocked by Long Chen’s power, but they were also shocked to find that Yan Hong seemed to have merged with the entire world. He really did seem to have an endless energy supply.

“Without using your flame energy, all your attacks are meaningless,” said Yan Hong apathetically.

Long Chen knew that this fellow was eyeing Huo Linger’s energy. In their brief initial clash, Huo Linger’s energy was absorbed. Now, he wanted her core energy as well.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen retreated a step, creating a distance between himself and Yan Hong.

“You’re giving up?” Yan Hong’s gaze was apathetically cold. It was as if no matter what happened, victory was still within his grasp.

“I, Long Chen, never give up on what I’ve decided. You have your confidence, and I have my trump cards. The warm-up is over. My body should be able to endure it now, so I’ll be unleashing my full power. We will decide who is stronger and who will die today.”

Suddenly, the star diagram in Long Chen’s divine ring quivered.

“Starry Sea Births Violet Qi!”

Long Chen shouted, and violet qi gushed out of his star diagram. When that violet qi appeared, the ten thousand Daos began to whine as if the world was about to be crushed.
