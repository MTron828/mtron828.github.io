Chapter 2450 Crushing Through Power

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen had previously been using the power of the Five Star Battle Armor to get accustomed to the new power of his astral spaces.

Having gotten used to the power of the third step of Netherpassage, he summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor.

His body became covered in dragon scales. His 108,000 scales matched his 108,000 astral spaces, their power mixing together.

A volcanic power erupted out of Evilmoon, sending the Six Horn Sea Serpent shooting back.

He coughed up a mouthful of blood, flying straight out of his Heavenly Water Domain. Long Chen’s power stunned him.

Bubbles began to rage within his domain. It was like it was boiling. The very laws of his domain were being destroyed by Long Chen’s aura.

“Physical strength which surpasses that of a law?!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent was appalled. However, he then roared furiously and slammed his hands onto his domain. “Heavenly Water Twining Sea Serpent!”

Two giant sea serpents appeared within his domain, twisting around Long Chen. The water roared as the void began to spin along with them.

Blood lines appeared on the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s face. Blood began to ooze out of his body and merge into his domain. The two sea serpents inside grew even stronger with that blood.

“Long Chen, die!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent roared, pouring all his power into the two sea serpents. It was impossible to see Long Chen within the twisting space.

“Break!” A roar rang out from within the broken space. The two giant sea serpents exploded along with the very water domain.

Within the rain, Long Chen appeared. However, his scales were no longer pure white. They were now half white and half black. Evilmoon was in his hand. The current Long Chen was much more frightening. It was as if he wished to devour all life within this world.

It went without saying that the Six Horn Sea Serpent was powerful. This water domain of his was something that might truly possess the power to kill Long Chen if he hadn’t reached the third step.

The ability to control an entire domain and concentrate all power into destroying the laws of space in one area was truly shocking. Long Chen had only managed to break it with the combined power of the azure dragon and the evil dragon.

He also knew that if they were on the Martial Heaven Continent, then with the support of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, this technique’s power would be even greater.

“Kill them all!” shouted Long Chen. He charged toward the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

“Kill!

Roars rang out from every direction.

“What?!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent was shocked. At some point, four more groups of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts had arrived under the direction of the Dragonblood warriors. They collapsed upon the sea demons.

Just at that moment, Long Chen’s saber hacked down upon him, not giving him a chance to give any orders. Despite blocking, he smashed into the ground, hacking up blood.

Long Chen was one with his saber as he continued attacking. The Six Horn Sea Serpent coughed up more blood, his arms breaking. Before he could heal, Long Chen stabbed his saber at him.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent hastily took out a tortoise shell that transformed into a giant shield. This tortoise shell’s aura was extremely ancient. It was a divine item of the sea demon race.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s arms quivered. He managed to stab a hole into the tortoise shell, but he was unable to pierce through it.

Despite that, his power was enough to cause the ground to sink once more, and a wave of earth rose.

“My Black Tortoise Heavenly Shield!”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent let out a pained shout. That was a divine item of the Heavenly Black Spirit Tortoise race, a relic left behind by one of their ascenders.

Not only was its defensive power amazing, but the secret arts of its race were recorded on top of it. The Heavenly Black Spirit Tortoise race had vanished from the Martial Heaven Continent. This was the only divine item left behind by them.

This treasure recorded the ascender’s will, so its value was impossible to estimate. It was something that the Six Horn Sea Serpent used to gain comprehension into the Heavenly Daos, not for battle.

Compared to its value in terms of comprehension, its amazing defensive power was second. No one would be willing to risk it.

However, in that critical juncture, he hadn’t had time to hesitate. He had taken out this treasure, which was now damaged by Long Chen. Its runes began to dim. The runes specific to the will of the ascender also faded, causing the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s heart to almost rip apart.

Even if he was a young king of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race, this shell belonged to the entire sea demon race. He was not qualified to use it for battle. Now he had no idea how he would be able to explain himself once he returned.

“I’ll tear you to pieces!” Suddenly, the earth exploded beneath Long Chen, knocking him back.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent stabbed two fingers into his own forehead. Blood dripped into his hand.

After that, the giant sea serpent within his manifestation multiplied into six. His manifestation grew larger and suddenly began to give off an ancient aura.

“Ancestral power, descend!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent’s horns lit up once more, forming a halo behind his head.

Blood continued to pour out of the hole in his head. It was a frightening appearance, but the six giant sea serpents were now sending a mysterious energy into him that made him seem like a completely different person.

“Even if you brought out every ancestor from your race, I wouldn’t be afraid.” Long Chen slashed Evilmoon.

The two of them began to exchange blows equally. After sixteen attacks where neither side was able to force the other back a single step, the webbing between Long Chen’s thumb and forefinger split open.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent was using a self-destructive technique to boost his own power. By sacrificing his essence blood, he summoned the power of his ancestors to support him.

Although Long Chen had suffered a minor injury just now, the Six Horn Sea Serpent was being injured with each attack inside. His aura was starting to dramatically drop.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent risked a glance at the battlefield. The sea demons were broken up and being slaughtered. Without his left and right arms, they were divided.

“Retreat!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent let out an unwilling shout. Even in this state, he was unable to beat Long Chen. They had to retreat before they were wiped out.

The sea demons instantly fled. With their huge bodies, other than a few unlucky fellows at the front, the rest managed to blast through by using their fallen comrades’ corpses as shields.

“Long Chen, just wait! I will make you regret this!” roared the Six Horn Sea Serpent, falling back.

However, just at that moment, he sensed something wrong. The tortoise shell came out once more.

BOOM!

A pill furnace smashed into the tortoise shell. It had just been a bit away from sucking him inside.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent shivered. The Demon Moon Furnace was far too demonic. It appeared silently with no warning at all. If he hadn’t reacted fast enough, he would have been doomed. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Dragonblood Void Extinguisher!”

Suddenly, the Dragonblood warriors charged at him. All six groups of five hundred people attacked at once.

This was a weakened version of Guo Ran’s Dragonblood Cross Slash. Even five hundred people were able to unleash it, but its power was still immense.

Under normal circumstances, perhaps the Six Horn Sea Serpent would look down on such an attack. However, it was coming from six different directions, and he was also in an injured state.

“Five Ancestor Protection!”

Five sea serpents vanished from his manifestation, and then a five-color shield appeared around him. He had transformed his ancestral power into a shield.

Six rays of Sword Qi shattered at the same time. They were unable to even rattle this shield.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

A saber-image suddenly slashed down, instantly blowing apart the shield. Half of the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s body exploded.

Not giving him a chance to breathe, Long Chen attacked again, this time aiming for his head.
