Chapter 2536 The Peak of the Mother Tree

“A Sovereign sprout? Me?” Long Chen laughed. “I’ll never be able to have the same charisma as the Sovereigns, nor will I obtain the entire continent’s approval. The past Sovereigns were respected by all beings on the continent, and they transcended the barriers between races to unite the entire continent’s lifeforms against their enemies. As for me? I have enemies everywhere. I slaughtered all the disciples of the Corrupt path and the sea demon race. Can I hope for them to call me Sovereign?”

This battle had truly been intense. The Martial Heaven Alliance had lost three hundred thousand disciples. On the other hand, even excluding the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps, the other side had lost almost three million disciples.

The Corrupt path and the sea demon race’s disciples had essentially been wiped out. If any of them survived, they must be isolated within secluded places of the Star Field Divine World. Those little fish that hadn’t joined in on this battle were very few in number.

“It doesn’t make sense. The Sovereigns were able to win over everyone, not just because of their amazing power but also their actions and integrity. I haven’t seen other Sovereigns, but Sovereign Mo Li truly gave off a feeling of being unrivaled, and it had nothing to do with his cultivation base. It was purely his charisma. Yun Tian possesses almost the exact same kind of nobility in every one of his movements. So why is it that Ye Ming, Feng Fei, Zhao Ritian, and the others wanted to kill him? He’s a Sovereign’s descendant. Even if they don’t want to submit to him, they shouldn’t be enemies, right?” said Tang Wan-er, frowning.

The others were also unclear on this. The Sovereigns had saved the Martial Heaven Continent repeatedly. Why was it that rather than respecting the Sovereigns, they would want to kill one of their descendants? Was it really just due to the competition of the martial path? Was it all just for the shot to become a Sovereign?

Long Chen shook his head. “There are definitely some people who know the answer, but they refuse to say anything. Since that’s the case, I can’t be bothered. We should just focus on ourselves. As for Yun Tian, he will definitely be standing on our side. Sovereign Yun Shang’s descendant can be trusted. Before we leave this place, we should work hard on cultivating so that we can reach the peak as fast as possible in preparation for the realm above Netherpassage. We’re still too weak. Within the same generation, there aren’t many that can fight us. But whether it is the Corrupt path, Pill Valley, or the divine families, they all have a terrifying foundation. They definitely have more than a few experts above Netherpassage. Against experts like that, we don’t have the slightest chance of winning.”

Long Chen had killed the king of the sea demon race and Dongfang Yuyang, and they had captured Zhao Ritian. Perhaps the divine families were still unaware of Zhao Ritian’s fate, but the Six Horn Sea Serpent race and the Dongfang family were definitely aware of the deaths of their peak heavenly geniuses.

Once Long Chen and the others left the Star Field Divine World, they would definitely be facing another fierce battle. In this world, the weak were prey to the strong. As reason could not be counted on, it didn’t matter who was right. The only thing that mattered was whose fist was bigger.

“Heavens, we’ve entered the empty void up here! The stars are so pretty!” Tang Wan-er suddenly exclaimed. At some point, they had reached the top of the tree’s crown.

Here, they could see countless stars. It was as if the stars were right beside them, close enough to touch.

“Ling Xi, what is that river?” Long Chen pointed to a black river.

This river seemed to sever the entire Star Field Divine World. From the top of the mother tree’s crown, they could sense just how vast and frightening it was.

It was a river of darkness that caused even the surroundings to darken. It was as if the river was sucking in all light. Just looking at it made them feel like their souls were going to be sucked in.

“That black river was drawn over here by the invading experts during the battle from back then. It was called the River of Darkness by us. Due to its invasion, we were only able to restore the Star Field Divine World to its current state, and it can no longer reach its peak. This river contained dark energy that destroyed the source of the Star Field Divine World. The unending dark energy it releases is what supports those dark lifeforms,” sighed Ling Xi.

“Dark energy?” Long Chen and the others were startled. They instantly thought of Ye Ming. Would Ye Ming draw out that black river’s energy to fight them?

As if seeing through his thoughts, Ling Xi said, “You don’t need to worry. At first, there were people controlling the river. Later on, they all died, so the river was abandoned and created its own laws. It has become the river path for the Ghost Ships as they pass through the past and future. Its dark energy has manifested another kind of law, and others are no longer able to absorb its energy. The human enemy of yours who possesses dark energy is unable to control it. His dark energy has not reached the highest level of purity to even attempt doing so.”

Hearing that, Long Chen felt better. Ye Ming was a scheming fellow, so they had to be careful of him.

“Evilmoon, can you absorb the river’s energy?” asked Long Chen.

“No. That black river’s energy has mutated and is bound by a different set of laws. I can’t use it. There’s no need to take the risk. My current power is more than enough for you to use. You’re the one who is too weak right now. Yun Shang’s seal means I can only release my full power through you. If you weren’t so weak, do you think I’d be bullied to this state?” Evilmoon sighed, like a tiger that had been bullied by a dog.

“Fine, I’m sorry for your loss.” Long Chen also sighed, somewhat apologetically.

The dragon race was the proudest of all races. To follow a master like him, Evilmoon truly had suffered. The feeling of having power but not being able to release it was aggravating. Evilmoon was limited by him, its master.

Long Chen suddenly clapped his forehead. “What a fool, why didn’t I ask Sovereign Yun Shang to undo your seal?”

“You’re not a fool, you’re stupid. The Yun Shang that sealed me was at his peak. The one you encountered was nothing more than his past self. He could not undo this seal,” snorted Evilmoon.

“Well, we should have still tried it. What if it worked?”

“What if my ass. I already asked him, and he told me this,” said Evilmoon irritably.

“…”

Just as Long Chen and Evilmoon were talking, Ling Xi brought everyone to the peak of the mother tree. Here, they were surrounded by stars. It was as if they were within a world of fantasy.

“How beautiful.”

The light of the stars illuminated Meng Qi and the others. Tang Wan-er looked around at the starry sky in wonder. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re all even more beautiful,” said Long Chen.

“You know how to talk.” Tang Wan-er laughed, blushing slightly.

“This is the edge of this world and the limit of the mother tree,” said Ling Xi.

“Haven’t we already reached outside the world? It entirely feels like we can fly to the closest star from here,” said Tang Wan-er.

“That is nothing more than a misperception. Those stars are such a great distance away that it cannot be expressed with words. The stars you see might not even be in the same spacetime as us. They might be millions of years away from us or might not even exist any longer. Every star is its own world just like the Star Field Divine World with its own laws. We can see them, but we are separated by spacetime. If you want to go over, you will have to find the spatial node between the two worlds to create a passageway. Just like with the Martial Heaven Continent, as long as two worlds are close enough, with their world barriers touching, it is possible to pass through a spatial node. It is different from minor worlds. Major worlds all have tough barriers to break through. To destroy two major worlds is comparatively easier than connecting two major worlds. Usually, only gods are capable of doing such a thing. Ah, it seems we’ve gotten off topic. I brought you here because this is a good place for comprehending the laws. The edge of the Star Field Divine World has the laws of two worlds clashing. Hence, Heavenly Dao energy is rather plentiful here. You will be able to experience the most primordial world energy, so it doesn’t matter what kind of energy you cultivate, you will be able to gain deep insights here. Chu Yao, you can give a display,” said Ling Xi.

Chu Yao was suddenly propped up by a branch that extended into space, and she turned a bit pale from how high up she was. Wood element experts were naturally a bit afraid of being thrown high into the air since their power stemmed from the earth.

Suddenly, countless wooden stakes stretched out of Chu Yao’s back. They were of various colors and had different runes on them. They were like thousands of hands stretching out into the void.

“This is…” Chu Yao suddenly grew delighted.

“The wood energy contained within the barrier of the world has millions of varieties. Therefore, you can choose the energy most suited to you to comprehend and absorb. Your wood energy also contains metal energy, so you can also absorb metal energy at the same time. The proportion will be up to you. Wood is easy to slash, flexible, but lacks sharpness. Metal is easy to shatter, lacks flexibility, but has plenty of sharpness. You can make up for the disadvantages of one with the advantages of the other. We are only at the edge right now, so if you want stronger power, you can reach out into the depths. There’s no way to fly, but you also don’t need to worry about falling because the mother tree will keep watch over you,” said Ling Xi.

Hearing this, everyone was delighted. Liu Ruyan then went over to Chu Yao’s side, stretching out black wooden stakes that looked like vipers, emitting a shocking black qi.

“The qi of underworld corpses… you come from the Corpse Devil Demon Forest,” Ling Xi stared in shock at Liu Ruyan.
