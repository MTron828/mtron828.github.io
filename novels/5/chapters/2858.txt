Chapter 2847 Divine Scripture Pavilion

Seeing her happy smile, Long Chen also smiled. He shook his head. “I’ll correct that misunderstanding of yours today. In this world, there is no such thing as someone weaker beating someone stronger.”

Everyone was startled by this statement, and it caused a ruckus amongst the instructors.

“What nonsense! There have been plenty of cases of the weaker person beating the stronger one throughout history! The Dao of the Heavens is incomplete; the moon wanes and waxes, while the tides rise and fall. To grow is to leave room to shrink. Instructor Long Chen, pay attention to your words! Don’t mislead our disciples!” said one old instructor, clearly disagreeing with Long Chen’s view.

The principle of the weaker beating the stronger was deeply rooted in almost everyone’s head. This was the only way that weaker people would have the courage to fight stronger opponents. It was also a way to encourage them.

Hence, for Long Chen to say that there was no such thing toppled their traditional teachings, resulting in the instructors lashing out.

Only Heaven Master Yun Yang continued to watch Long Chen with interest, not expressing any opinion over this. He just waited for Long Chen to continue speaking.

“You’re the one bullshitting. Tell me, what is someone weaker beating someone stronger?” demanded Long Chen.

“Someone with a lower cultivation base beating someone with a higher cultivation base in combat,” answered an instructor.

“Who told you that someone with a lower cultivation base is definitely weaker?” retorted Long Chen.

“...” That instructor was instantly speechless.

Ignoring him, Long Chen continued, “There is no such thing as someone weaker beating someone stronger. If the weak could beat the strong, then that means that they were never weak. If the stronger side lost, then they were never the stronger side. Have you seen a chicken egg capable of smashing a hard stone to pieces? In front of absolute power, the weak have no chance to win. The reason that you don’t understand is because you have never experienced an era of bloodshed, of corpses piled into corpses, of battlefields filled with blood. You are simply incapable of understanding when I say these things. If it weren’t for the Heaven Master asking me to say a few words, I wouldn’t even bother wasting the effort.”

“You speak as if you’ve experienced such a thing,” said one instructor, unconvinced.

Long Chen then glanced over at that elder who was a Human-ranked instructor. Since Long Chen was so young, the elder was dissatisfied to see Long Chen talk like he had more experience.

“I’ve killed more lifeforms than you’ve seen in your entire lifetime,” said Long Chen indifferently.

An uproar erupted throughout the plaza. Wasn’t that far too brazen to say?

“Hahaha, what a huge joke! Just the academy’s disciples are numbered in millions and millions! If you want to brag, then at least try to have a bottom line,” sneered that instructor.

Long Chen shook his head. He couldn’t be bothered to explain anything to these people who had never seen the world. As time went on, he found that the academy was filled with even more immature people.

“Instructor Long Chen, we believe you! Your power proves your words. We don’t believe that such a prideful person would just brag. Only people with no ability like frogs at the bottom of a well would question that there is a whole world outside of their well,” said Zhong Xiu loudly.

Long Chen laughed. These two girls really were interesting. They didn’t know how to scheme at all. Were they not afraid of these old fellows causing trouble for them in the future for this?

“Well, we’ve gone off-topic. Let us return to the main point. My theory is that there is no such thing as someone weaker defeating someone stronger. Since many people don’t understand, I will explain in detail. An ant biting an elephant to death, a wasp stinging a dragon to death. These are typical examples of weaker beings beating stronger existences. But in the immortal world, there is a story of an elephant falling asleep. A kind of ant then crawls into the elephant’s ears and eats its brain. As the elephant is powerless to expel it, it dies. The second example is the Golden Ring Wasp, which is no bigger than an inch. Its venom occupies the majority of its body, and its stinger can pierce rock. Even a dragon’s hide is unable to block it, so the dragon will be stung to death. People are the same. In this world, there is a profession called assassins. They are also typical examples of the weaker beating the stronger, existences that fight across realms as easily as eating. However, who is weaker and stronger isn’t based purely on the size of their body, their physical power, or their cultivation base. To use the area that you are strongest in to defeat your opponent’s weakest area is the essence of battle. The Elite Group’s disciples can be said to not be strong in overall power. Likewise, when it comes to Li Cai and Zhong Changsheng, there is a large gap between them when discussing pure power. However, Li Cai’s current strongest point is that he dares to risk his life, while Zhong Changsheng doesn’t. Due to this, Li Cai was able to defeat Zhong Changsheng’s trump cards twice.

“In truth, he didn’t defeat his trump cards. It was Zhong Changsheng who changed them midway. The first time, Zhong Changsheng was caught off guard because Li Cai completely ignored his attack and merely aimed directly for his vitals, forcing him to switch to blocking midway. This resulted in him being instantly defeated.

“The second time, Zhong Changsheng was enraged by his defeat, so upon gaining a second chance, he made his determination not to change his technique midway again. He wanted to force Li Cai into a life and death exchange, trying to scare him. However, Li Cai ignored this provocation, simply unleashing his own attack. If neither side changed techniques, then they wouldn’t merely be exchanging injuries but dying together instead. Under the threat of death, Zhong Changsheng broke. He didn’t want to die, so he changed moves midway again and was defeated again.

“The other disciples of the Elite Group are the same. They won just like this. During this month, I only taught them this one thing. When you have nothing else but still wish to change your fate, you must risk your life to grasp that one chance. Only once you grasp enough opportunities will you possess the power to change your fate.

“Use your strongest aspect to defeat your opponent’s weakest aspect. If you still can’t win, then just kill yourself by bashing your head in with a block of rotten tofu.” Long Chen’s voice resounded throughout the plaza.

After that, everyone looked at the Elite Group’s disciples. With their confident gazes, they were like sharp swords that had finally shed their rust and were showing their light.

Suddenly, clapping rang out and Heaven Master Yun Yang said, “Marvelous, truly marvelous. I haven’t heard something so marvelous in a long time. The best part is that instructor Long Chen’s theories have been put to the test and displayed for all of us today. They are truly powerful words. It’s far better than the rest of us who only know how to discuss things in theory.”

Heaven Master Yun Yang and the others were mostly experienced when it came to cultivation and the various realms. However, in terms of actual combat, they were weaker. As the God Institute’s various departments had to manage each other, their instructors rarely entered the battlefield.

As a result, when the instructors taught combat techniques, it was mostly techniques for the martial stage. But Long Chen’s combat techniques were for killing. There was a qualitative difference between the two.

“Heaven Master, you praise me too much. This little one will get an ego like this. I’d ask Heaven Master to give me advice.” Long Chen bowed slightly toward Heaven Master Yun Yang. For him to directly speak of his own shortcomings without hiding anything was something worthy of respect.

“Alright, then from today onward, you can start holding classes. The lower three floors of the Divine Scripture Pavilion are now freely open to you. Congratulations, instructor Long Chen,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang.

Long Chen was delighted to hear that. The place he yearned to go to the most was precisely the Divine Scripture Pavilion. That was also one of the targets that the dragon expert had sent him here for.

Suddenly, a crowd of people pushed toward him.

“Instructor Long Chen, I want to book a lesson for tomorrow!”

“Stop pushing! I am first in line!”

“Bastard, do you want to die? I am first in line! I’m under your feet right now, so get up before I beat you up!”

“...” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Countless disciples flooded toward Long Chen for classes. Seeing this scene, Long Chen smiled.

“I won’t be lacking money in the future, right? My first step toward cultivating the immortal path has been taken. Brothers, wait for me!”
