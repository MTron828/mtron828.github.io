Chapter 3146 One Saber Shakes Experts

The barrier shattered, which terrified the experts remaining in the inner spectator stand. If they were struck by this, would they have any chance of surviving?

Just then, chains appeared around the martial stage. Like a giant lantern, the martial stage was sealed inside. The shockwaves blasted the chains, but they were contained.

“The martial stage has actually changed form!”

People were stunned. The martial stage was no longer the same. It was now covered in chains, looking like a paper lantern. But despite that, quite a bit of energy still escaped, and that energy blew past these people’s faces, cutting them like knives.

However, they all endured that pain to watch. Long Chen’s saber was pressing down on Ku Wuya.

Corpse Qi erupted out of Ku Wuya’s body. Ten thousand devils were roaring within his manifestation. There seemed to be countless black vipers swimming across his body.

However, no matter what he did, Long Chen’s black saber continued to steadily suppress him. Ku Wuya’s face was twisted from the effort, but Long Chen’s saber seemed to be as heavy as an entire world. Ku Wuya was unable to shake him.

As the saber pressed down, the martial stage was slowly sinking as well. The entire island became covered in cracks and began to sink too. Waves rose from the sea, crashing down on the island.

With just his own power, Long Chen seemed to be bringing about the end of the world. The stars shuddered and endless power poured through his body.

This time, Long Chen’s rage resulted in him unleashing his full power. All his 108,000 stars ignited, and he activated the Six Star Battle Armor. He now possessed a power that even he hadn’t dared to imagine.

However, using this power also came with a price. His physical body was being pushed past its limits, so blood slowly leaked out from beneath his scales. Painful pangs also came from all over his body. But he ignored it.

This pain actually brought him a kind of difficult-to-describe pleasure. It was as if hurting himself within his anger was also a kind of delight.

The power of his divine flames was constantly injuring himself. Fortunately, he had expected this, and the Wood Foundation Divine Trees in his primal chaos space were filled with life energy, healing his body as it broke down. Other than being painful, it didn’t affect him.

Veins throbbed on Long Chen’s arms as his power grew, while Ku Wuya’s body was quivering. Strange sounds came from it as if it was about to be smashed apart.

Just then, Long Chen swung his hand through the air. As a result, the void exploded and a dagger appeared, stopping less than an inch from Long Chen’s neck.

“It’s Gui Yun!” Startled cries rang out. People had almost forgotten about him, but he had suddenly appeared.

Long Chen’s hand struck a fat face, and Gui Yun’s figure appeared. He was sent flying, smashing into the net of chains and bouncing back.

Everyone saw a very clear handprint left on his face. It was such a deep imprint that it was funny, but no one laughed. Instead, they were shocked.

Only after Long Chen had sent him flying did people realize that Long Chen was still pressing down on Ku Wuya with only one hand on his saber. Even then, Ku Wuya was suppressed. That meant that the difference in their physical power was clearly immense.

Long Chen was able to suppress him with one hand and still had another hand capable of dealing with Gui Yun’s sneak attack.

The High Firmament Academy’s disciples cheered loudly as encouragement, while those that hated Gui Yun also cheered along.

The fact that Gui Yun had tortured the lifeforms of the Butterfly Spirit race and the Butterfly Dance race had drawn public fury. Almost everyone wished him dead, so this slap was incredibly satisfying to them.

“One draws my attention, the other sneak attacks. Did you plan this in advance? I already told you that your tricks are dogshit in front of absolute power. Did you think your special technique that suppresses the Butterfly Dance race’s spiritual seal would mean that I couldn’t track you? Actually, I could have killed you just now with that slap, but I feel like that would be letting you off too easily. It won’t resolve the hatred in my heart. I’ll show you what a tooth for a tooth and eye for an eye means.” Long Chen’s voice was full of hatred and anger.

He was unable to accept that races like the Butterfly Spirit and Butterfly Dance races were treated so cruelly by others. When Die Wu’s soul was extracted, he felt like he was the one being tortured. That hatred drove him mad.

When Gui Yun vanished, Long Chen found that he had lost connection with the seal that Die Wu had left behind for him. He knew that Gui Yun had found a secret art to block it.

However, Gui Yun couldn’t escape the senses of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Hence, Long Chen's slap scattered his teeth and split open his mouth, causing him to bleed.

This was everyone’s first time seeing Gui Yun injured. Furthermore, it was from Long Chen’s slap in the face. Thinking of what he had done to Die Wu and her companion, countless people couldn’t help cheering inside.

BOOM!

Just then, Ku Wuya took advantage of this moment to counterattack. A pair of black wings spread on his back, and his withered body seemed to regain its vitality, making his flesh plump once more.

A fiendish-head mark lit up on his club. Long Chen felt an immense power pour through it, knocking him back several steps. Every step caused the void to collapse.

“Ku Wuya really is sinister. He blocked Long Chen to get Gui Yun a chance to assassinate him,” said Luo Xue.

“It’s too bad that he underestimated boss’s power then. Even if boss has to split his attention on them, Ku Wuya can only knock boss back. He can’t injure him at all,” sneered Qin Feng. When it came to power, who could compete with Long Chen? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Their plan was good, but Long Chen’s power far surpassed their expectations. Even a full-power counterattack from Ku Wuya was only able to knock Long Chen back, while he himself was knocked back as well.

“Long Chen!” Just then, Gui Yun roared furiously. With the handprint still clearly imprinted on his face, Gui Yun summoned a giant illusory image behind him. Countless cries came from the senior generation.

“The Bloodkill Hall’s Enpuda!”
