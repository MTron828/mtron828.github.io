Chapter 5020 Zhao Qingtian Comes Out

As Long Chen sat down in the seat of the head umpire, below him, one referee announced the rules and so on. Once that was done, Long Chen rose.

Immediately, sharp cries and loud cheers rang out in waves. This was a release of their excitement and hot-blooded anticipation. Everyone eagerly looked forward to the fight between experts of the ancient era and the current era.

The current era’s heavenly geniuses had always felt overshadowed by those of the ancient era, creating an intense rivalry. Internally, they were determined not to lose to them.

The participants of the elite competition were the top experts of the current era. Once the top eight were decided, some felt their power was inferior and directly gave up their spots. This allowed them to conserve their strength and keep their trump cards hidden. As fellow experts of the current era, they all hoped for someone to defeat the ancient era’s experts to prove that they were not inferior.

In this battle between past and present eras, there were only two sides, and clan affiliation didn’t matter. All of them were united in their determination to overcome the ancient era’s experts.

Long Chen was the one to pull open the curtain to the clash between ancient and present experts. As his figure appeared on the martial stage, the spectators erupted with excitement.

Mist swirled over the martial stage. It was only when Long Chen appeared that the mist faded, revealing two figures.

There were four martial stages, each shrouded in mist, so no one knew who their opponents were until the mist dissipated. At this moment, cheers erupted when they saw who was on the martial stage.

“It’s Long Wuyang and Zhao Qingtian!”

With a ranking even lower than Long Ziwei, Long Wuyang had been extremely average and low-key. However, he suddenly rose during this elite competition, completely toppling the Long clan’s understanding of him.

No one had expected Long Wuyang to be hiding his power for so many years. He was undoubtedly the greatest dark horse of this elite competition.

At this moment, Long Chen observed Long Wuyang. The latter was tall and bald, resembling Gu Yang in terms of build. As a power-type fighter, he held a coiled dragon staff thicker than an ordinary person’s thigh. His Blood Qi seemed on the verge of bursting from his body, and he stood like an immovable iron tower.

On the other side stood Zhao Qingtian, much shorter and resembling a child who hadn’t fully grown. Despite his stature, his aura was terrifying. Even without intentionally releasing it, his natural presence caused space to twist wildly around him.

He resembled a bottomless volcano, with the energy within him impossible to gauge. His short stature did not diminish the respect others held for his formidable power.

“The Long clan’s dark horse? Come. Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. If you can endure three moves from me, it’ll count as your victory,” sneered Zhao Qingtian.

Clearly, Zhao Qingtian didn’t think highly of Long Wuyang. In fact, he didn’t even acknowledge the umpire standing nearby, completely ignoring Long Chen from the start.

Long Wuyang remained unfazed by Zhao Qingtian’s provocation. Instead, he nodded calmly. “Then many thanks. Let me see just how strong the heavenly geniuses of the ancient era are!”

With that, Long Wuyang’s Blood Qi erupted, and his Heavenly Fate Disk materialized. Blood-colored marks appeared on it, igniting his Blood Qi even further. Long Wuyang’s Blood Qi blazed when those marks appeared.

Qi waves surged out of him, stirring astral winds that caused the bricks beneath his feet to crack. His aura soared to an astonishing level, shocking the crowd.

“Heavens!”

Startled cries rang out from the crowd. Although they all knew that Long Wuyang had been holding back, no one had anticipated the extent of his power. This sudden surge of power shattered the martial stage’s bricks, revealing his formidable prowess.

Long Wuyang stamped down. With an explosive sound, more bricks shattered, and he transformed into a bolt of lightning shooting toward Zhao Qingtian.

When the coiled dragon staff’s runes lit up, blood-colored lines ignited, and the staff’s aura merged with Long Wuyang.

“One with the staff!”

More startled cries echoed out. Long Wuyang’s weapon was a Heaven Saint divine weapon, but his cultivation base hadn’t reached the level of a Heaven Saint. Hence, it should have been impossible for him to merge with it, yet he still did.

His ability to become one with his weapon meant he could unleash its full potential, a capability many could only dream of achieving.

Long Wuyang knew his opponent was a peak heavenly genius of the ancient era, and the latter was unimaginably powerful. To face such a formidable opponent, Long Wuyang had restrained himself for years, waiting for this moment. Now that the chance had arrived, he cherished this opportunity more than anything and immediately unleashed his full power.

What a fool.

Long Chen smirked coldly as he observed the unfolding scene. Zhao Qingtian had made a critical mistake, severely underestimating Long Wuyang.

As expected, Zhao Qingtian was truly showing off, not even summoning his manifestation. Now that Long Wuyang had merged with a Heaven Saint divine weapon, his powerful aura directly pinned Zhao Qingtian down. Zhao Qingtian only realized he had misjudged at this point, but it was too late for him to summon his manifestation.

With a shout, Zhao Qingtian spread his legs and crossed his arms in front of him. Long Chen instantly felt a vast power gathering on top of the martial stage.

“Earth energy?”

Long Chen was surprised. Before unleashing this move, Long Chen hadn’t even sensed any earth energy fluctuations from Zhao Qingtian’s body.

Earth energy concentrated on Zhao Qingtian’s body, forming a layer of armor. His arms and legs in particular were covered in multiple layers, making them exceptionally thick.

BOOM!

Long Wuyang’s staff struck Zhao Qingtian’s arms. With an explosive sound, the entire martial stage quivered. Countless bricks were sent flying and smashed into the barrier, releasing ripples.

This was an absolutely terrifying attack. However, what shocked people even more was that Zhao Qingtian didn’t move in the slightest. He stood like a boulder, while Long Wuyang was knocked back several steps from the impact.

“Heavens, isn’t that too terrifying?!”

“He didn’t even summon his manifestation?!”

“Is the difference too great?”

This scene stunned people, especially the current era’s experts. They had placed much of their hopes on Long Wuyang, but this result was like a bucket of ice water over their heads.

One was attacking with all their power, and the other didn’t even summon his manifestation. Was there even a point to this fight? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After being knocked back, Long Wuyang didn’t get flustered. On his final step, he spun and shifted his feet. With bizarre footwork, he appeared in front of Zhao Qingtian again and swept out his staff.

“Nice!” This time, even Long Chen couldn’t help but say a word of praise.

BOOM!

The entire martial stage shuddered as Zhao Qingtian was forced back by Long Wuyang’s attack.
