Chapter 2953 Area Forbidden to Life

Just like in the outer academy, the inner academy’s Immortal Institute had more people than the God Institute. But although the Immortal Institute’s disciples in this place looked coldly at the God Institute’s disciples, they weren’t so hostile as in the outer academy.

Through the transportation formation, when those disciples saw Long Chen and the others in the robes of the God Institute, their disdain was clear.

“Where did they get this sense of superiority from?” asked Long Chen speechlessly. These people were all looking down on them, as if they were unwilling to look at them directly.

“There’s no way around it. The inner academy’s rank one and rank two on the Earth rankings are Immortal cultivators. Only third place belongs to our God Institute. Adding on that the Immortal Institute looks down on us who rely on outer power to cultivate, such a thing is very common,” explained Mu Qingyun.

God cultivators relied on divine inheritances. Either they had experts worshiping them, or they worshiped some other gods. Faith energy was the tie binding the sides together, and it could aid them immensely.

In the eyes of immortal cultivators, this was like having an expert pulling you and weaklings pushing you forward. Such a cultivation method was looked down upon by Immortal cultivators.

Immortal cultivators had to rely on themselves, so they naturally felt disdainful toward God cultivators. But in the same vein, God cultivators also looked down on Immortal cultivators. According to God cultivators, what was wrong with faith? Many God cultivators had their faiths in their family’s ancestors and such. Without those ancestors, where would they have come as their descendants? Did Immortal cultivators not have ancestors?

Faith was a kind of inheritance, so what was wrong with it? Some God cultivators also worshiped some extremely powerful existence of history, and they had gratitude toward their ancestors. Without those powerful existences, they wouldn’t have received their inheritance. For them, faith was a kind of reverence and gratitude.

Thus, with both sides having their own reasons for their own cultivation and for looking down on the other side, the disagreement between Immortal cultivators and God cultivators had continued for countless years.

As for Long Chen, he didn’t technically count as a God cultivator because he had no faith inheritance or anyone he worshiped.

However, he was an instructor of the God Institute, and his fighting style was focused on the power of his body, which was a common mark of a God cultivator.

Long Chen didn’t particularly care if he was a God cultivator or an Immortal cultivator. After all, he was also an instructor of the Immortal Institute. He was also skilled in using magical arts.

“Who are the first and second rank? Have you heard of them?” asked Long Chen as they walked.

Seeing Mu Qingyun, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, Li Cai, and the others staring at him oddly, he asked, “What is it?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“My boss San has been in the inner academy for so many days but has yet to learn who rank one and rank two are?” Li Cai was speechless. On the very first day, he had memorized the first hundred people of the Earth rankings, afraid of running into them.

Long Chen still didn’t know who rank one and two were? Just how confident was he? Perhaps only an expert like Long Chen wouldn’t care about such things.

Mu Qingyun answered, “First and second rank are also called the academy’s number one most beautiful woman and number one most handsome man. Rank one is Bai Shishi. According to big sister Luo Bing, her beauty is truly the embodiment of making even the moon hide itself in shame, making flowers close in embarrassment. Every woman feels inferior in front of her. She is not only unrivaled within the same realm, but even when fighting across realms, she has never faced a loss. In fact, no one has ever been able to endure more than five exchanges against her. Not only is her beauty transcendent and her combat power overflowing, but she has an incomparable status as well. She is the granddaughter of the current dean.”

“What? It really is a case of being beautiful, talented, and having status.” Long Chen was startled. Now, even he felt some curiosity toward this woman.

“Brother San, maybe you should work hard on pursuing that Bai Shishi. Then you’d be able to run rampant throughout the academy, hehe,” chortled Zhong Ling.

Long Chen shook his head and righteously said, “This woman has been blessed by the heavens and is essentially perfect. But the heavens have given her all their blessings, so they have no more to give. Thus, if she wants to obtain a perfect man like me, it would be as difficult as ascending the heavens.”

That serious appearance of his made Mu Qingyun laugh. She continued, “Bai Shishi established the Heaven Female Alliance. It only accepts women, and only those with immense talent and beauty at that.”

“Heaven Female Alliance? What a familiar name.” Long Chen was startled. He felt like he had heard this name before.

Zhong Ling laughed, “Senior sister Qingyun received an invitation from them. Even their vice leader personally came, but she still declined it. Moreover, she even rejected the Sword Institute’s invitation. Senior sister Qingyun did this for us, so we have to work hard to get the Unfettered Alliance to the top hundred.”

Long Chen looked at Mu Qingyun and sighed. She was just like him when it came to her sense of responsibility. If she were to lead a group of people, then she would take responsibility for them. She definitely wouldn’t just leave them like this. No matter how great the enticement, it wouldn’t draw her away.

“Senior sister Luo Bing was also invited, and she also declined the Heaven Female Alliance. It might actually draw some of their ire. They’re the number one guild in the inner academy, so many people want to join. But they actually rejected them,” said Zhong Ling worriedly.

“They would get angry?” asked Long Chen.

“Brother San, Bai Shishi is extremely proud. She has never acknowledged any man. The women of her guild are also very arrogant, and some petty women wouldn’t mind making things hard on us,” said Zhong Ling.

Mu Qingyun said, “You’re worrying for nothing. People on our level don’t enter their eyes.”

“Then what about rank two?” asked Long Chen.

“His name is Xu Changchuan. He is called young master Changchuan and is very handsome. Just like Bai Shishi, he has looks, talent, and a powerful background that doesn’t lose out to her. It is said that he came from a mysterious land, an area forbidden to life. As for the details, no one knows. Those forbidden areas aren’t places that people like us can come into contact with. Anyway, he has always pursued Bai Shishi. Some people say that it is only because of this that he is willing to be rank two, and that in terms of combat power, he is actually above Bai Shishi. However, that’s just a rumor. Bai Shishi has always ignored him. Both of them are existences that rarely reveal themselves in the inner academy,” said Mu Qingyun.

“An area forbidden to life? What kind of place is that?” wondered Long Chen. This was his first time hearing such a thing. If life was forbidden, who lived there?

As they were talking, they quickly spotted a large mountain, and it had an immortal cave in it. According to the academy’s rules, every guild would receive an immortal cave for the guild to organize in.

There were over a thousand people here celebrating today. Luo Bing immediately greeted Long Chen and the others. However, just as Long Chen was smiling and about to say some words of congratulations, another group of people suddenly arrived, causing Luo Bing’s expression to turn cold.
