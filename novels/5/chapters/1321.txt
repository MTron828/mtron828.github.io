Chapter 1322 Everyone Scatters

Translator: BornToBe

Cloud was so fast that it looked like a huge rainbow star had smashed into the ground.

The ancient family alliance’s experts all turned pale. None of them would have thought that the seemingly frail Meng Qi, an immortal fairy-like existence, would actually be so vicious and launch a deathblow at Luo Minghao.

Each one of her attacks had been merciless. Her spiritual attacks were to give the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow a chance to attack. After three consecutive attacks, Luo Minghao was in desperate straits.

With an explosive sound, Cloud flew to the ground and smashed its wing at Luo Minghao. The entire Xuantian Dao Sect shook fiercely.

But Meng Qi saw that Cloud’s attack had missed. Luo Minghao had used some unknown technique to escape her spiritual lock and vanish.

“Die, slut!”

Just at this moment, a furious roar rang out, and the space behind her split open. A sword pierced toward her back.

The attacker was Luo Minghao. There were spots of light covering his body now. It was like he was in between reality and illusion, having no substance to his body, but his attack contained a heaven-toppling power. This sword would definitely cause a fairy to fall if it struck Meng Qi’s body.

Luo Minghao hated Meng Qi now. She had caused him to lose face, and so he truly wanted to kill her.

But just as his sword was about to reach her body, a rainbow feather dress appeared around Meng Qi’s body, and the runes on its feathers lit up, forming a barrier that protected Meng Qi’s back.

Luo Minghao’s incomparably sharp attack instantly rebounded upon contact with the rainbow feather dress’s defenses.

“An Ancestral item?!” Luo Minghao was shocked. He hadn’t expected Meng Qi to have an Ancestral item protecting her. Just as he was shocked, a large claw slammed toward him.

Luo Minghao slashed his sword at Cloud’s claw. Sparks flew. Cloud was fine, but Luo Minghao was forced back.

Luo Minghao couldn’t help being shocked. Just at this moment, someone from the ancient family alliance warned him, “That’s a Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow! It’s physical body is powerful, and its speed is peerless! Be careful!”

Cloud suddenly let out a bird cry, and the runes on its feathers began to light up with a mysterious cadence. It opened its mouth, and a black light suddenly shot at Luo Minghao.

“Watch out! That’s the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s innate divine ability - the Life Devouring Light Ray!”

The leader of this group from the ancient family alliance couldn’t help being shocked. He had a certain understanding of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow, and it was precisely because of that understanding that he was so shocked.

This Life Devouring Light Ray was a shocking divine ability that allowed the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow to unleash its devouring abilities even outside its stomach. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

It had to be known that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s strongest point was their devouring power. And this Life Devouring Light Ray was formed by condensing the devouring energy in their stomachs into a ray of light. It was a terrifying attack.

Legend was that only tenth rank Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows were capable of unleashing this move. But the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow in front of them was only at the ninth rank!

The black light was incredibly fast. This terrifying attack hadn’t taken Cloud any time to cast. This was the terror of a Magical Beast.

It arrived in front of Luo Minghao in an instant, and he didn’t even have time to use his earthen pot. All he could do was condense Heavenly Dao energy into layers of shields before him. Eighteen layers instantly appeared, which could be called a terrifying defense.

But what shocked everyone was that these layers of defenses were unable to bear a single attack from the black light, and were easily pierced.

Finally, the black light pierced Luo Minghao’s shoulder. His entire arm vanished along with his shoulder, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood, shocked.

Only now did he realize that his Heavenly Dao energy was unable to suppress that strange black light. Its bizarre energy had instantly consumed his flesh, and most shocking of all, his Heavenly Dao energy was unable to heal his injury. Some kind of energy was crazily absorbing his life energy. All his Heavenly Dao energy could do was suppress that devouring energy, but it couldn’t heal him.

Just at this moment, one of Cloud’s wings slashed toward him like a huge heavenly blade.

“Bastard, this time doesn’t count! Just wait!”

The heavily injured Luo Minghao was no longer able to use that strange movement art he used before. With a furious roar, he crushed a talisman and vanished.

“A Voidbreaking Talisman!”

Everyone’s expression changed. To be able to teleport a person from within the Xuantian Dao Sect’s grand formation, probably only a Voidbreaking Talisman was capable of doing so. It was unexpected that Luo Minghao had such a precious treasure.

That Voidbreaking Talisman was incredibly precious. Even the Hall Masters of the Xuantian Dao Sect had only ever heard of such things.

“As expected, it’s just as the Eastern Wasteland Bell said. Peak heavenly geniuses aren’t so easy to kill. Ordinary experts aren’t able to affect their golden fate lines, and even if they can take the advantage, they still won’t be able to kill them. This is the karmic luck of peak heavenly geniuses.” Long Chen sighed inside.

Meng Qi had definitely managed to obtain an absolute advantage over Luo Minghao, but she wasn’t able to kill him in the end. That was because of his karmic luck.

In truth, Long Chen was very clear on the fact that the reason Meng Qi was able to suppress him so heavily was because that idiot had been too careless. After messing up at the start, he had never managed to turn things around.

As a rank nine Celestial, he had to have many trump cards. Regretfully, he hadn’t even had a chance to use them before being defeated and fleeing miserably.

If they were comparing their true abilities, even Meng Qi with Cloud wouldn’t necessarily be able to defeat him.

Right now, everyone stared in shock at that fairy-like figure standing atop the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s head.

They had all thought that the strongest expert of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s junior generation would be Long Chen. But it was a frail-looking woman that had defeated Luo Minghao in just a few breaths’ time. She had even almost killed him.

“If anyone from the ancient families wants to challenge me, you can come.” Meng Qi looked at the disciples brought by the ancient family alliance.

Those disciples had all mocked and looked down on Long Chen. Even Meng Qi was infuriated.

These disciples had truly mocked Long Chen, but that mostly stemmed from their envy. However, now that Meng Qi had displayed such terrifying power, how could they possibly dare to say a word?

“Goodbye!”

The ancient family alliance group’s leader snorted and cupped his fists slightly before leaving with a gloomy expression. It was unknown whether he was saying goodbye to the ancient races, Pill Valley, or the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Clearly, the ancient family alliance had only come to watch the fun. But as a result, they were forced to leave dejectedly. They were infuriated.

“The ancient races won’t let this matter end as is! All of you just wait!” The ancient races also left, but not without saying some vicious words.

Once the ancient family alliance and ancient races’ experts had left, Pill Valley’s law enforcer, Zhuo Tianxiang, waved his sleeve and led those Righteous experts away.

The only ones left were the people from the Martial Heaven Alliance. Deng Cang’s expression was exceedingly ugly, and he was extremely uneasy.

“If you had known this would happen, would you have still acted that way? The bitter wine you brew will have to be swallowed by yourself sooner or later. I won’t be sending you off!” Seeing that Deng Cang seemed to still want to say something, Long Chen directly expelled him.

He knew that shameless people had faces thicker than city walls. He would say that this was all a misunderstanding, and that there was still room for discussion. Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to waste that time.

Deng Cang glared at Long Chen, but in the end, he led his people away.

Looking at their departing figures, Long Chen’s gaze was ice-cold.

Li Tianxuan smiled and said, “What, did you not manage to vent your anger?”

Long Chen shook his head. “Some people are fated to be enemies, and these people should be exterminated as early as possible. Otherwise, they’ll cause a disaster sooner or later. There are also some people who curry favor and are no threat on their own, but then they will be used by others to become painful blades. As for whether or not they will become those blades, it depends on whether we can eliminate our enemies first and intimidate them. In truth, sometimes the power of these people who sway whichever way the wind blows is even more frightening than our actual enemies.”

The most hateful thing about these opportunists was that you wouldn’t know when they would stab you in the back. And before they did stab you, you wouldn’t be able to touch them.

“When did it become so complicated? Just attack whoever you find displeasing. Why make it so troublesome?” Boss Bao turned his nose up at Long Chen’s words. This part of Long Chen’s character didn’t fit in with them.

“Old Tu, come, let’s go drink some wine. Long Chen, you three can come.” Boss Bao couldn’t waste his time on such troublesome things. He directly pulled Tu Qianshang away to find a place to drink.

“Everyone, now that you’ve come to my Xuantian Dao Sect, although I can’t offer you any fine wine, I can give you a good place to drink.” Li Tianxuan waved his hand, and an ancient mirror appeared in the sky. It was the Xuantian Dao Sect’s Reincarnation Mirror. “Within the mirror, you will be able to see all the scenery of the Xuantian Dao Sect. It’s the best place to drink wine and discuss the Dao.”

“Hahaha, good. Let’s go.” Boss Bao laughed. Drinking up in the air was definitely appealing.

“Eh? Xuan Master, sect leader, old man Yue, why aren’t you coming as well?” Long Chen suddenly noticed Li Tianxuan, Ling Yunzi, and Yue Qingshan hadn’t moved. They had no intention of going with them.

“We don’t really drink wine. I happen to have some good tea here, so we’ll drink the tea. You can drink the wine.” Li Tianxuan smiled faintly.

Boss Bao didn’t force them. Pulling Tu Qianshang, Long Chen, and the others, he flew directly into the Reincarnation Mirror in the air. Long Chen didn’t know that when they entered the Reincarnation Mirror. Li Tianxuan shook his head and sighed.

“I wonder if they can even last an incense stick’s worth of time?”
