Chapter 5010 Ye Lingxiao’s Challenge

When this new figure appeared on the martial stage, the Ye clan’s experts cheered. It was Ye Lingxiao, the Ye clan’s strongest heavenly genius.

Looking at Long Chen coldly, Ye Lingxiao said, “I’ve long since found you displeasing. Come, let us have a decisive battle today.”

Hearing the challenge, everyone was excited. Their cheers drowned out all other sounds.

“Ye Lingxiao, you are too selfish! His life is mine. If you want to take it from me, you need to at least say something to me first!” Another voice rang out.

The five-foot-tall Zhao Qingtian appeared. Although he was short, his voice resonated powerfully like a drum, booming through the air.

The Zhao clan’s number one heavenly genius had also come. Everyone was startled. They had only seen such heavenly geniuses at the opening ceremony; the rest of the time, they had been in seclusion.

“Jiang Wuwang has also come!”

Startled cries erupted. At some unknown point, Jiang Wuwang had silently appeared, sitting among the ranks of the Jiang clan’s disciples with exceptional low-key presence.

“Heavens, look who it is!”

Another cry rang out, filled with astonishment and tremor. Above the martial stage, a long-haired woman appeared, her hair and robes billowing around her like a heavenly fairy descended upon the world. It was Long Tianrui.

She had no followers this time. Alone, she stood icily aloof, as if she didn’t fit in with the rest of the world.

“Heavens, even she has come. What is happening? Is the decisive clash in this elite competition happening in advance?!”

This elite competition had many competitors, but most of them knew that they were just extras. They understood they had no chance at the prizes, yet they still thirsted to witness the clash of the world’s peak heavenly geniuses.

In their eyes, these peak heavenly geniuses were Long Tianrui, Zhao Qingtian, Ye Lingxiao, and Jiang Wuwang. The champion would emerge amongst these four.

For now, the one favored to win was Long Tianrui. Even though the Long clan’s collective strength was at the bottom of the four divine clans, Long Tianrui’s presence commanded respect and fear. Her name was known to all within the four clans, and she was practically a god-like existence.

Now, with all four of them gathered and Ye Lingxiao challenging Long Chen, the atmosphere practically ignited.

After sending the unconscious Ye Lingkong out of the arena, Ye Lingxiao turned to Long Chen and challenged him again. “Long Chen, do you dare to fight me?”

Long Chen met Ye Lingxiao’s gaze and shook his head. “First of all, you aren’t qualified to challenge me. Second, I won’t accept such boring challenges. If someone wants to die, they should pick a time when I’m in a bad mood... or a very good mood.”

“You...”

Ye Lingxiao’s expression darkened. He was the Ye clan’s greatest heavenly genius, but Long Chen still looked down on him.

Long Chen waved his golden scepter, sending Qin Feng out. In this battle, although both sides were injured, Ye Lingkong had passed out, while Qin Feng was still standing.

In other words, a nine star Doyen was capable of fighting a Heavenly Chosen. This shattered people’s understanding of cultivation.

“Scram!”

Seeing Ye Lingxiao still standing there, Long Chen sent him out with his scepter. Here, Long Chen had absolute authority. As the golden scepter controlled all the formations of the competition grounds, no one could resist Long Chen’s command.

“You... are you running?!” shouted Ye Lingxiao furiously.

“He’s just afraid of death, so he doesn’t dare to fight you. Hey, Long Chen If you’re so afraid, you can just fight me. I promise not to kill or maim you,” Zhao Qingtian sneered from the Zhao clan’s ranks.

Two of the four heavenly geniuses had challenged Long Chen, so everyone looked at Jiang Wuwang, but he silently sat amongst the Jiang clan’s disciples.

Long Tianrui was also silent, her eyes fixed on Long Chen. She didn’t seem to care about anyone else, and no one knew what she was thinking.

“In my eyes, you’re all a pack of fools. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I can count how many people like you I’ve killed. Youngsters need to know what reverence is. You shouldn’t treat ignorance as a personality, and you shouldn’t foolishly test out the boundaries of death!” said Long Chen coldly.

At this moment, Feng Fei smiled slightly. “Long Chen is angry. If they add a bit more fire to the mix, he’ll immediately make his move.”

Beside her, Jiang Wuwang asked, “What kind of fire?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“For example, threats. If they use the lives of the mercenaries or these two to threaten him, then it’s going to happen,” replied Feng Fei as she looked at Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu.

The two of them were startled, not daring to believe it. Was their position in Long Chen’s heart really so high?

“You don’t know this, but Long Chen has a fatal weakness. He cannot accept being threatened. If someone threatens his brothers or lovers, he will immediately explode. He won’t hesitate at all no matter who it is. I understand this fellow too well,” sighed Feng Fei, looking at Long Chen.

“If it’s a fatal weakness, why is he still alive?” asked Jiang Wuwang.

“Because those who had threatened him all died!” said Feng Fei. “In truth, the reason I have my power is mostly thanks to Long Chen.”

“What do you mean?” Jiang Wuwang was baffled. Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu’s ears perked up as if they were afraid of missing a single word.

“When we met in the mortal world, I thought I was far superior to him. I even felt like I could look down on him. However, he climbed to the peak one step at a time. After that, I could only look up to him, and I realized... in this world, some people are fated to be main characters. No one can cover up their light.

“Then in the immortal world, he rose again, further corroborating my thinking. After that, my mentality changed. I stopped fighting him and became a peaceful spectator. From that moment on, I started to understand many things that had been unclear to me. I saw things I had never seen before. My world completely changed; it became limitlessly vast.

“Now, I’m no longer anxious or impatient. I simply have a peaceful heart. I peacefully enjoy the changes in the world. Of course, what I like most is seeing this person rise. I want to bear witness to his light.”

Feng Fei stared at Long Chen, her eyes clear. Her look of worship and admiration made even Jiang Wuwang a bit jealous.

“That’s amazing. How did you achieve such peace of mind?” asked Long Ziwei. It seemed that from a young age, he had been taught to constantly strive and fight. His parents instilled in him the need to surpass others, to reach for the stars and shine the brightest.

After years of relentless struggle, always feeling anxious and stressed, he couldn’t recall a day when he had been truly happy.

However, Feng Fei’s tranquil gaze seemed to be entirely at peace, almost as if she possessed some kind of magic. It made him feel particularly close to her. Perhaps this was why she had such a high position in the Jiang clan.

Feng Fei looked at Long Ziwei and snorted, “You really are dense.”

Long Ziwei was baffled. He didn’t understand how he had offended Feng Fei. This sudden change caught him off guard.

“If I really had the power to run alongside Long Chen, why would I be a spectator? I had no other choice but to stand aside,” Feng Fei said, curling her lips.

Feng Fei’s unexpected words left everyone puzzled. They seemed earnest but playful, making it difficult to discern her true intent.

When Long Chen returned to his seat, the elite competition was on the verge of commencing. At this moment, the silent Long Tianrui finally spoke. “Long Chen, have you considered it?”
