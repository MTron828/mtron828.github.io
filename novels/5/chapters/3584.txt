Chapter 3573

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you’re saying…” Tu Hu and the others stared at Long Chen in shock. They thought that they had misheard.

“You didn’t mishear. The resources have been sent over, and your mission is complete. I want to go with you to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. In this situation, we have to kill those hateful fellows outside. For now, rest for half a day,” said Long Chen.

Tu Hu and the others came to send resources to Clear Rain City. This was just one small city, but it had tens of millions of people living in it.

Despite being a small city, it had a long history and a thick foundation. So even though there was an endless army of devil beasts outside, they didn’t dare to attack the city.

Even if they did manage to break down Clear Rain City in an attack, they would have to pay a terrible price. As a result, the Luo clan’s people directed the devil beasts to only surround them but not attack.

With that being said, Clear Rain City’s grand formation had to be kept active at all times. That came at a huge price. Once all the resources were used up, the city would easily be destroyed.

Before this, the Luo clan’s people had not exposed themselves, and the various major forces all took turns sending resources to Clear River City. Although they were attacked by the devil beasts, they still managed to quickly deliver the resources. It wasn’t too difficult.

After several probing times, the major forces decided to send more resources at once. Previously, the resources that they sent over would only last the city a month.

This time, taking advantage of while their enemies’ attention lay elsewhere, they had sent over half a year’s worth of resources.

With this, Clear River City could protect itself temporarily, and they could gather their attention on the Alldevil race’s main forces. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, who would have thought that they would suddenly be caught in a trap here? If Long Chen hadn’t appeared, their battleships and resources would all have been snatched. It was truly a narrow escape.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, is that really an option? If we ask the college for aid, senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran will immediately bring a huge army when he learns that you’ve come,” said Tu Hu hesitantly.

“No need. If you trust me, in a bit, just listen to my directions. If you feel like it’s not safe, you can stay here. I’ll go to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College myself,” said Long Chen lightly.

Hearing that, Tu Hu instantly understood that Long Chen was displeased. Clenching his teeth, he said, “Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, please don’t be angry. We will listen to you.”

Although Long Chen had saved his life, Tu Hu felt like this kind of plan was far too cavalier. They might all be wiped out.

However, due to his trust in Guo Ran, he chose to firmly trust Long Chen. That was because Guo Ran always called himself number two. For Guo Ran to recognize Long Chen as boss, Long Chen could not possibly be an ordinary person.

With that response, Long Chen nodded. To the elder, he said, “City lord, in a bit, prepare yourself and gather your troops. Listen to my directions, and we will wipe out the other side’s elites in one move.”

“Alright.”

The city lord directly agreed. After that, Tu Hu and the others went to rest and service their battle armors.

Their battle armors were like a second life to them. In battle, maybe some parts would be damaged. So, they had to repair them, or it would affect their power.

Hours later, when Tu Hu and the others were done, the experts in the city were gathered and waiting for orders. At this moment, the grand formation rumbled and countless runes revolved around it. Divine light then stabbed into the dome of the heavens.

The endless devil beasts were blinded by this sudden piercing light. They couldn’t see anything.

This sudden change caused an uproar amongst the devil beast army. As for the Luo clan’s experts lying in the dark, they summoned their battle armors, peering at Clear Rain City.

Suddenly, the void shuddered. A figure was transported out and appeared right in front of them.

“Not good!”

When they saw that black figure, the Luo clan’s experts were appalled.

A gust of wind blew by, and a saber slashed down from the heavens, striking that World King of the Luo clan.

“It’s just one person! Kill him!”

That World King shouted, his armor’s runes flowing. Long Chen’s previous slap had cost him all his face, so he was filled with hatred for Long Chen. Now that Long Chen had come out on his own, it was as if he didn’t even place them in his eyes.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber seemed completely ordinary, but when it struck that black-armored elder’s blade, the Minghong Saber simply rumbled and violet qi gushed out like a volcano. With a huge explosion, a qi wave blasted apart the other experts of the Luo clan that had come to help the elder.

Long Chen was now capable of controlling the power of his saber naturally. He had made huge improvements from the last battle. His control over his violet qi had also reached a new level.

Although it hadn’t reached the realm of absolute perfect control, it could now be unleashed and withdrawn as he pleased. With that ability, he could easily con his opponents in battle. At the same time, he was even able to summon his violet qi without summoning his manifestation. That allowed his normal combat power to soar.

It was in the Starry Sea Births Violet Qi state that his violet qi was at its strongest. It gave Long Chen explosive power. But it also cost a lot of energy to keep it active.

Furthermore, it came at a heavy burden to the body. One mistake and he would overdraft himself. If it hadn’t been for Xia Guhong’s arrival last time, he’d have lost his life.

Hence, unless Long Chen had no other choice, he did not dare to unleash his manifestation. His violet qi was clearly still not dense enough, leaving him unable to fight for a long time. If he wanted more violet qi, he would need to fully transform the Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, Divine Gate, and Nethergate Stars first.

Despite that, Long Chen’s violet qi in this state was still tyrannical. Using the violet qi, Long Chen activated the Minghong Saber’s runes. Although he was only able to activate a very small portion of them, the Minghong Saber was working together with him. The combined power of man and saber was definitely not something an average expert could withstand.

The black-armored elder received this attack head-on. As a result, cracks appeared over his weapon, and the shining runes instantly dimmed.

“What?!”

That elder was absolutely shocked. Long Chen’s saber had not just cracked his weapon, but it had also damaged his armor. Horrified, he directly fled without hesitation.

Regretfully, he was too slow. Let alone in his current state when his armor was damaged, even in his peak condition, he could not match Long Chen’s speed. Just as he turned, the Minghong Saber stabbed him through his back and out his chest.

“Don’t… don’t kill me!”

The elder cried out in horror. Regretfully, with a quiver from Long Chen’s arm, his armor and his body both exploded.

Just then, rays of divine light appeared. Tu Hu and the rest of the Clear Rain City’s experts appeared, attacking the Luo clan’s experts before they even understood what was going on.

It was at this time that the ground exploded and giant figures came charging out. They were all late stage World King devil beasts. There were over forty of them.

Seeing them, Long Chen formed hand seals and golden dragon scales covered his body. With golden flames burning at the same time, a holy, wild dragon might crashed down.

“Blood ignition, Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens!” shouted Long Chen.

Following that, a brilliant dragon cry resounded throughout heaven and earth. A will that looked down on all others caused the world to shake.
