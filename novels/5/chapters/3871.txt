Chapter 3860 A Call

“Guo Ran, watch out!”

Long Chen shouted. Guo Ran was standing on the head of a certain corpse and had taken out a saw to take off its horn.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But at this moment, that corpse actually reached out toward Guo Ran. Upon hearing Long Chen’s warning, his battle armor’s wings flapped and he seemed to teleport.

However, he was still the slightest bit too slow. The lifeform’s claw touched him ever so lightly, and he was sent flying like a shooting star, smashing into the ground, his body vanishing within the earth.

That lifeform stood up. Only then did Long Chen and the others see that it was a winged devil.

“Hehehe! Long Chen, die!”

That winged devil laughed sinisterly and walked toward Long Chen. That voice was Shi Yang’s. He had actually taken control of his immemorial devil corpse secretly.

“Impossible! He can’t possibly control such a powerful corpse!” Yue Xiaoqian couldn’t believe it. Her Devil Suppressing Seal then lit up and blasted at this winged devil.

“It’s useless! This corpse’s runes have not been activated, so your divine seal has no effect at all. I bet you never thought of this, right? I’m actually not from the corpse devil race. I only joined the corpse devil race in order to cultivate the Corpse Devil Dao. I’m actually a winged devil, and my soul still has the seal of the winged devil race deep within it. Controlling this corpse from my own race is naturally as easy as breathing for me. Hehe, since everyone else has left, let me end things here!” Shi Yang lunged toward Long Chen.

His speed wasn’t very fast as his body was swaying clumsily. It seemed that he could not fully control this corpse yet.

However, this corpse’s body was too terrifying. If struck by his palm, with Long Chen’s current state, he would definitely be killed.

“Earth Spirit Binding!”

Mo Nian shouted. It was unknown what he tossed out, but chains suddenly shot out of the earth and bound Shi Yang’s legs.

BOOM!

Those chains exploded instantly. However, Shi Yang staggered and fell flat on his face.

“He wants to steal this corpse! Trap him and leave him to die here!” shouted Mo Nian. He then took out a shovel and with a single heave, the earth collapsed. Shi Yang’s corpse was drawn underground.

The next moment, Xia Chen tossed out one talisman after another. His talismans transformed into a net of chains binding the corpse’s body.

Shi Yang struggled crazily, but this body didn’t want to listen to him. It was too clumsy, like a drunkard tossed into a mud pit. No matter how he struggled, he was unable to escape.

Mo Nian continued to dig, so the hole grew deeper and deeper. On the other hand, Shi Yang could only roar furiously. After a while, he suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a large mouthful of blood.

That blood was then absorbed by the wings on his back. With a flap of his wings, the void exploded and he shot out of the ground like a shooting star. However, he didn’t fly straight up. Mo Nian had already dug a giant hole for him, and now he ended up smashing through the ground diagonally.

He pierced right through thick layers of earth and out in the distance.

“Just wait! Once I get accustomed to this corpse, you will go see the Yellow Springs!”

Shi Yang once more flapped his wings and ended up in the wrong direction. He actually ended up going straight toward Long Chen and the others. When he realized this, his expression changed and his wings flapped crazily. As he forcibly changed directions, he smashed into things several times before eventually escaping beyond their line of sight.

This scene was both shocking and funny. But once he was gone, they were all worried.

“That’s not good. Shi Yang has now gained such a terrifying body. Next time, we’ll probably have to run,” said Xia Chen.

“It’s not that bad. This corpse isn’t something that he can control. At most, he can use it to scare people.” Mo Nian waved off his concern dismissively.

“That’s right. A corpse on this level? Without reaching the World King realm, there’s no way that he can fully control it. Even if he is from the winged devil race, he can’t control that corpse’s divine abilities. If he wants to control those abilities, he’ll have to activate the corpse’s innate runes. But if he does that, he will be suppressed by my seal. I would guess that he will choose to first control the corpse’s physical body as it is too tough for us to damage. However, as long as we don’t fight him directly, he also won’t have the ability to do anything to us.” Yue Xiaoqian gradually recovered from her shock.

Shi Yang might possess this terrifying devil corpse, but he couldn’t activate its divine runes and would only have its most basic physical power.

However, the winged devil race wasn’t a brute power race that only fought with their physical bodies. Thus, even if Shi Yang did manage to control it, it wasn’t too bad. Even in the worst case, they could simply avoid him.

With Shi Yang gone, they once more began to go through the battlefield. After taking everything of value, Long Chen began to draw the corpses into the primal chaos space.

After bringing them in, he didn’t directly toss them into the black soil. Instead, he placed them to the side and looked at the Fusang Tree.

He had not had a chance to look at the Fusang Tree after he had tossed its upper portion into the primal chaos space. Now, he finally had a chance. As he was recovering, he used the black dagger to cut off its branches, planting them in the soil.

Long Chen then planted one hundred and eight of its branches along the edge of the primal chaos space, leaving a huge amount of space between each one.

It was only after this that he tossed one of the immemorial corpses into the black soil. However, what shocked Long Chen was that it was clearly very difficult for the black soil to devour this corpse.

It was only after an incense stick’s worth of time that life energy came out. This corpse had not even changed appearance. The black soil had barely broken down the tiniest bit of its body, but the vast amount of life energy unleashed was enough to revive all the vegetation in the primal chaos space.

This life energy caused the withered vegetation to revive at a visible speed. As for Long Chen’s wounds, they rapidly healed as well.

The best thing for Long Chen was that the branches of the Fusang Tree also started sprouting. One tiny shoot after another sprouted from the branches, looking like they were made of pure gold.

Now Long Chen was incomparably excited. With this, he would have an endless supply of the Sun Flame and the Moon Flame.

As endless life energy filled the primal chaos space, a mist-like substance quickly covered this world. This mist made this entire space look as if it was made out of primal chaos qi.

“This corpse actually possesses such a huge amount of primal chaos qi!” Long Chen suddenly found that it wasn’t just life energy being unleashed here. There was a great amount of primal chaos qi as well!

However, this primal chaos qi was actually locked within the primal chaos space. He was unable to absorb it.

“Is the primal chaos space leaving it for itself?” Long Chen muttered to himself as he eyed this primal chaos qi. He seemed to have sensed something.

In less than an incense stick’s worth of time, the primal chaos space’s vegetation was fully recovered. The Moon Trees and the Fusang Trees were slowly growing. They had already grown to the height of a foot.

Their bodies were wrapped in black and golden flames respectively. Although they were still tiny shoots, those flames still emitted powerful fluctuations.

“Long Chen, the heavenly tomb has exploded, and the laws of heaven and earth have changed. Treasure lands are all opening. What do we do now?” asked Yue Xiaoqian.

“You should go absorb primal chaos qi in those treasure lands and condense Heavenly Dao Crowns,” said Long Chen.

“And what about you?” asked Yue Xiaoqian.

“When I used the Purgatory Eyes, I saw a world. Something there seems to be calling to me, so I want to take a look.”

Long Chen took out an eyepatch and covered his bleeding left eye. With his remaining eye, he looked in a certain direction, murmuring.
