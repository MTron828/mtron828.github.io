Chapter 4593 The Sovereign Clan’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest

“That’s right, I am all better now. I should leave.” Long Chen found that he was healed. Even his left eye no longer hurt, and he could open it. But for now, he definitely shouldn’t use the Purgatory Eyes.

He was very thankful to the white dragon race. At the very least, he didn’t need to wear that uncomfortable eyepatch. When he wore it, he even looked like a bad person.

Other than his left eye, he was fully recovered, which showed that the white dragon race’s sacred energy was extremely effective.

“No, no, you misunderstand. I am not asking you to leave because you’re healed. Your goal is to get the Sovereign scale, but I can sense that the Netherdragon race’s ancestral scale is on the verge of accepting a master. I feel like you have something more important to do,” explained the white dragon.

“On the verge of accepting a master? In other words, he’s about to subdue the ancestral scale?!” asked Long Chen as he jumped in shock. That was too fast, wasn’t it?

“It is a bit fast. Theoretically, it should have taken Netherdragon Tianzhao half a month, but he only needed three days. After all, he’s cheating as he has another energy supporting him,” replied the white dragon.

“Fuck, it’s definitely the Nether Emperor’s energy!” said Long Chen, his tone tinged with hatred.

The Nether Emperor’s power was actually above the ancestral scale’s. With its help, Netherdragon Tianzhao could progress smoothly.

Other than that, he also had the dragon tooth spear from the same ancestral dragon. With these two conditions added together, he naturally progressed quickly.

“You don’t need to feel too much of a rush though. Subduing the ancestral scale is an entirely different concept from having it recognize you as its master. I won’t explain too much about it. You will understand soon,” said the white dragon.

Long Chen nodded. After thanking it once more, he glanced at Bai Yingxue, who seemed to be in a deep slumber. He then turned and stepped out of the white domain.

Long Chen reappeared in their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Its core was filled with white dragon experts sitting peacefully under the ancestral scale, bathing in its light.

On the perimeter, there were countless other dragon experts present, absorbing this sacred light as well.

Long Chen also saw many dragon experts with weaker cultivation bases here. It seemed that they lacked their own inheritances, so they came here to benefit off of the white dragon race.

They were all rather obedient and were just quietly sitting there, not causing any ruckus.

Long Chen then walked out and went in the opposite direction of the Netherdragon race’s nest. As he passed through the area, he found that almost every ancestral scale here had started to react. Some successors had finished the initial step and were like Netherdragon Tianzhao and Bai Yingxue, having entered the ancestral scale’s space.

Wherever Long Chen went, the atmosphere tensed as those who saw him became vigilant. After all, during the time Long Chen had slept, the news of him obliterating the Netherdragon race had spread to every corner of this area, so they all knew his face.

Long Chen just ignored them as he was just passing by. After going through over ten nests, the number of nests started to drop. The nests in this area were perfectly intact, but their ancestral scales were absent, leaving uncertainty as to whether they had been subdued and removed.

As Long Chen moved through another nest, a low rumble echoed in his ears, akin to a dragon soaring through the skies. Simultaneously, a distant dragon cry resonated in his mind, carrying an ancient resonance filled with a sense of desolation. Long Chen’s dragon blood surged within him in response.

The Dragon King Battle Armor materialized around Long Chen, responding to a powerful summons. Sensing the powerful call, Long Chen hastened his steps.

He quickly saw a passage of fire up ahead. When the raging flames struck him in the face, he felt his Blood Qi ignite and form similar flames.

“This burning...”

Long Chen was shocked to find that this ignition was completely different from the concept he knew of. This was a kind of energy transformation, not simply burning his Blood Qi away.

Beads of blood appeared on his skin and ignited, causing red flames to appear all over him. It was like he was clad in flame armor as dragon blood energy filled his entire body.

“I really know too little about the power of dragon blood. Sadly, senior isn’t present. Otherwise, I could definitely learn more divine abilities from it.”

Looking at these flames and sensing the dragon power raging within him, Long Chen found that even as his dragon blood burned, the core energy of his dragon blood wasn’t used up or damaged.

This manifestation stemmed from the dragon blood coursing through his veins, responding to an external call beyond his control. Long Chen paused momentarily to sense its origin before pressing forward.

The terrain ahead transformed into molten magma, and crimson flames engulfed the surroundings. Despite their intimidating presence, Long Chen felt an unusual affinity toward them. The scorching heat enveloped him like a comforting embrace, radiating a sense of warmth and familiarity.

Stepping across the magma, Long Chen continued onward. This area seemed to influence his dragon blood, triggering it. As a result, the flames coming out of him grew stronger with time.

“This is...”

Long Chen suddenly saw a giant dragon skeleton in front. Its flesh and blood had long since dissolved, leaving behind only charred bones ablaze with dragon runes. As he approached, the skeleton started to disintegrate, consumed by the molten magma until nothing remained but smoldering embers.

“It was at least a seven-star Doyen.” Although it was just a skeleton, Long Chen could sense its powerful aura. This seven-star Doyen had come to test their luck, only to die in this passageway.

Long Chen guessed that the skeleton originated from a powerful genius who lacked an inheritance in this land. Otherwise, they would have chosen to subdue their own race’s ancestral scale before coming here.

Due to not possessing an ancestral scale and being unable to resist the allure of the Sovereign scale, they took the risk of coming here. However, they couldn’t even see what the Sovereign scale looked like before dying here.

“Looks like I’ll also have to risk it all.”

Seeing that a powerful seven-star Doyen had died here without even having a chance to escape, Long Chen knew just how terrifying this magma was.

However, these flames weren’t harming him but helping him instead. Long Chen had never enjoyed such an advantage in this lifetime.

Long Chen continued onward and saw no one else. Most likely, the most formidable experts would refrain from venturing here without first subduing their own ancestral scales.

As for those lacking an ancestral scale to inherit, they faced the grim fate of being consumed by the magma, with no opportunity for escape. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen followed the magma path, walking for two hours. With each passing moment, the flames grew stronger. However, Long Chen still didn’t feel any pressure and advanced smoothly through the flames.

Suddenly, the wild flames vanished, revealing a peaceful world.

“That’s...!” Long Chen's heart nearly skipped a beat as he beheld this unexpected sight.
