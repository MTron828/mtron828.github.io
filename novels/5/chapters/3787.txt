Chapter 3776: Each Harboring Their Own Motives

The five-colored lightning swords turned black and contained endless destructive auras. When they fell amongst the people around, they suddenly exploded, unleashing violent power that even shattered the laws of the Heavenly Daos.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The black swords exploded one after another; every explosion formed a ripple of death. Other than the energies of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, there was also the power of annihilation. It was capable of even destroying the laws of heaven and earth.

Before this, the lightning swords were straight-line attacks. But now, they became bombs. Every lightning sword unleashed a domain of death.

The demonic beasts experts were no longer able to resist. Even their weapons were destroyed by the black lightning. As a result, they were wiped out of existence. Their bodies and souls were annihilated.

Even Supreme experts had difficulty surviving now. As they had no ability to look after others anymore, this heavenly tribulation instantly became a black hell. It was like the slaughterhouse of the Heavenly Daos, dark and bloody.

Even the Divine Venerates of the demonic beast watching from outside were shocked.

“What kind of heavenly tribulation is this?! It doesn’t give people any chance of survival! It clearly wants to kill everyone!”

They had lived countless years and had seen all kinds of violent heavenly tribulations. However, those were all simply trials with high chances of success. Those kinds of tribulations only wiped out the weak, leaving the strong to survive.

However, the actual tribulation didn’t have the slightest life energy to it; there was only endless destructive energy. Let alone those disciples, even old fellows like them were terrified by it. They couldn’t see any hope of surviving.

“This can’t continue! Kill that human!”

Suddenly, one of the Divine Venerates shouted loudly, his voice penetrating deep into the heavenly tribulation. The other experts outside looked at him in horror.

BOOM!

As a result, a streak of light flew out of the heavenly tribulation, striking the person that shouted. This person was a Divine Venerate, but having been locked down by the heavenly tribulation, he had no chance of survival. He was blown apart.

His body exploded. But very quickly, another figure appeared. It was the person who had just been killed. Seeing this, those experts around him sighed with relief. This person had sacrificed a clone to shout. But it was worth it.

That person’s shout had truly frightened them just now. It was not permitted to randomly talk during tribulations. One wrong word and the wrath of the heavens would descend upon them.

BOOM!

However, just then, another spear of lightning came out of the heavenly tribulation, crossing a great distance to stab through that person’s body.

Everyone was shocked. The clone had been killed and that should have been enough to satisfy karma. But in front of countless horrified gazes, that Divine Venerate was once more slain. This time, no other body appeared. He was truly dead.

“This heavenly tribulation is too terrifying! Not even clones can trick it!” They were all horrified. They had never even heard of such a heavenly tribulation.

Heavenly punishment was not so gullible. Any interference in the heavenly punishment came at a price. Hence, under normal circumstances, no one would dare to take the risk of provoking heavenly tribulation.

However, in the past, some people had shouted toward a heavenly tribulation, and if they had a clone, they were always able to sacrifice it in order to placate the heavenly tribulation. But this time, this move failed. Even the true body was slain with the clone.

Countless people turned green with terror. Fortunately, this person was slain in one move. If he survived, the heavenly tribulation would instantly go from an Immortal King tribulation to a Divine Venerate tribulation. Then everyone, including them, would be covered by the tribulation and killed. If so many Divine Venerates were to undergo collective tribulation, this part of the world would be wiped out of existence, and all lifeforms on it would be destroyed.

“Everyone, attack Long Chen! As long as he’s killed, the level of the heavenly tribulation will plummet! Otherwise, we’ll all die!” Suddenly, a sharp shriek rang out. This one shout caused countless experts to look at Long Chen hostilely.

“Weng Tianhao!”

As soon as Long Chen heard this voice, he knew who it was. This fellow was hidden in the dark. He actually thought that Long Chen hadn’t noticed and encouraged the demonic beasts to attack him.

After that, Long Chen’s Minghong Saber appeared in his hand. Lightning flowed around him and his gaze swept across everyone. He coldly said, “He is right. If you kill me, this heavenly tribulation will lower a level and become a Kunpeng tribulation. Perhaps more people will survive that way. If you want my life, come.”

“Everyone, attack together!”

“Don’t waste any more time, or the heavenly tribulation will keep growing stronger!”

“It doesn’t matter how strong he is, if we all attack together, he’s definitely dead!”

The demonic beast race’s experts roared and began to approach Long Chen. However, they quickly paused, feeling dumbfounded.

They found that only a very small number of people were actually moving. The majority of people weren’t budging.

These demonic beasts stared in disbelief at those experts. Kun Tu hadn’t moved and neither was the Underworld Eye Giant. The experts of the various races were all still. Even amongst the demonic beast race, the majority were only focusing on blocking the heavenly tribulation. They seemed to have no intention of attacking.

“The weak are always the stepping stones of the strong, so no one cares about your deaths. We just want to see what kind of existence the strongest heavenly tribulation is. Heavenly tribulation is a trial where the weak are eliminated. The stronger the tribulation, the greater the benefits. Heavenly tribulation is always fair. As long as you can live, the more you pay, the more you gain. Ants like you should shut your mouths. You can only represent yourselves. Don’t try to tell others what to do. If you can’t do anything yourselves, then just die!”

At this time, the beast cultivator spoke. His voice was like that of thousands merged into one. It echoed repeatedly, and even within this tribulation, it spread far and wide.

When the demonic beasts heard that, the ones that had started moving fell into despair. Their only hope was for Long Chen to die and the heavenly tribulation to weaken. That was their only chance of survival.

However, from the viewpoint of the real experts, they only hoped for the tribulation to grow even stronger. That would allow them to gain even more benefits.

Whether it was the five-colored lightning swords or the black lightning swords, they were helping the real experts advance immensely. They were shocked by how beneficial it was. It was completely different from when they underwent tribulation in the past. Absorbing this lightning was allowing them to absorb more of the essence blood qi spread throughout the Heavenly River Blood Sea, strengthening their physical bodies.

Furthermore, as more people died here, there were fewer people competing with them for this energy. In fact, even amongst the powerful members of the demonic beast race, they were hoping for more people to die so that they could gain more benefits.

The weaker ones, who had no confidence in passing this tribulation, had no hope now. Their thinking was the opposite of what the majority was thinking. There was no chance of it becoming a reality.

As for Long Chen, he remained fearless from the start. It seemed as if he had long since expected all this. He simply held the Minghong Saber. He didn’t put it away because he knew that the true battle was about to start.

Just then, the tribulation split open. Giant lightning chains descended from above the nine heavens, piercing through the void and entering the blood sea.

Following that, giant figures were dragged out of the blood sea. When they saw those figures, even Kun Tu’s pupils shrank to the point of a needle.

“Those are… the Beast Venerate skeletons!”

The jaws of the demonic beast race’s experts dropped. They all quivered in terror.
