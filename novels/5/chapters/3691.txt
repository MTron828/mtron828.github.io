Chapter 3680 Challenge?

“Challenge? Don’t joke around. Who would challenge the Wine God Palace?” Long Chen refused to believe it.

“It’s true! They’ve blocked the gate of the Wine God Palace and set up a martial stage! Let’s go! We’ve been watching the fun for a while before rushing over to get you!” urged Guo Ran.

Long Chen was very curious. When he was dragged over to the gate, he saw quite a few people around. The majority of them were peak Divine Lord disciples, and every single one of them was an expert with a powerful aura.

There were also a few elders. They were late stage World Kings and half-step Divine Venerates. Despite that, they gave Long Chen an immense sense of pressure. They were also terrifying existences.

Thousands of outsiders had come as well. They were just watching from a distance, clearly showing that they were only here to watch and not to offend the Wine God Palace.

Over ten young men and women were standing before the gate to the Wine God Palace. Their auras were all extraordinary. Both the men and women were beautiful, but their arrogant airs were not attractive.

“Junior has crossed a great distance to pay respect to the Wine God Palace’s seniors, but the Wine God Palace’s seniors shut the door and refuse to see me. Are you looking down on my Tea Divine School?” Their leader was a man who already seemed impatient.

His voice was cold and wasn’t loud. But it was backed by his spiritual yuan, making it spread far and wide. It wasn’t ear-piercing, but every word entered people’s ears clearly.

Although it was an intentional show of might, it showed that this person’s spiritual yuan was very pure. It was exceptional. Furthermore, his Spiritual Strength was also powerful, or he wouldn’t be able to control the sound so perfectly.

“If young heroes traversed a great distance to come, our Wine God Palace would receive them politely. But everyone knows that the Wine God Palace’s heart only contains the Wine Dao. If these young heroes came to discuss the Wine Dao, I trust that the seniors will naturally warmly greet you. But you came to compare the Tea Dao to the Wine Dao. That doesn’t seem very appropriate, does it?”

There were a few apprentices in charge of receiving people in front of the gate. Their expressions were a bit ugly.

These apprentices could only count as workers. But in the Wine God Palace, there was no differentiation in seniority or power.

Whether it was Long Chen or the experts in the Wine God Palace, they treated these apprentices very courteously, treating them the same way as they treated themselves.

“All Major Daos are different paths to the same end. Tea Dao, Wine Dao, what’s the difference? At the highest realm, they are all the same. What? Does your Wine God Palace value your own Dao as the most precious? Aren’t you simply shutting yourself off from the rest of the world?” asked that man.

In the beginning, his words could count as polite. But the longer he went on, the sharper his words became. In the end, he was clearly mocking them.

The Wine God Palace’s apprentices were displeased. The Wine God Palace was a holy land, and every senior inside was worthy of respect. However, this person was trying to make things hard on them. They weren’t angry, but this criticism of the Wine God Palace irritated them.

These apprentices all had great self-restraint. One indifferently replied, “Perhaps your words are correct. I will transmit them to the seniors in the Wine God Palace.”

Clearly, he was telling them to scram. It was simply that he was very polite and not so direct.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qing Yu, let’s leave. They don’t dare to discuss the Dao with us. Wine God Palace? Haha, what a fake name. They’re just a bunch of drunkards. How are they qualified to discuss the Dao with our Tea Divine School?” said a woman amongst those disciples.

Her sinister words immediately caused the expressions of those apprentices to change.

“You are going too far! When did discussing the Dao become insulting others?”

Even Long Chen, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen were enraged by this provocation. These people really were courting death. They didn’t have the slightest respect in their hearts.

However, they had come to discuss the Dao, not to compete in martial might. Hence, Xia Chen and Guo Ran didn’t step forward. If it was a martial competition, the two of them would have long since beaten them up until they cried for their parents.

“What do you mean by insulting others? We are only telling the truth. You don’t even dare to discuss the Dao. Are you afraid of exposing your own empty title?” sneered the woman disdainfully.

“You…!” Those apprentices finally lost their patience.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen went out at this moment, patting those apprentices’ shoulders. “What is the Tea Divine School? How come I’ve never heard of them?”

Hearing this, those disciples of the Tea Divine School were enraged. The woman shouted, “Brat, who are you?!”

“Shut your mouth. Trash like you isn’t fit to ask my boss’s name. Who do you think you are? How about I kill you all with a single slap?” Guo Ran finally had a chance to interject.

That woman seemed to be frightened by Guo Ran’s ominous gaze. It went without saying that after obtaining a Supreme Bone and after experiencing that immense battle, Guo Ran already had a certain sharpness in his eyes. His gaze was quite a bit stronger than before.

“Mister Long Chen, their Tea Divine School is also part of our Violet Flame Heaven. It was founded three hundred and sixty-seven thousand, four hundred years ago,” explained one of the apprentices.

“Only three hundred and sixty thousand years of history? Tch, no wonder they raised such arrogant disciples. It seems that they want to make a name for themselves. Alright, leave this to me. I’ll teach them how to behave!” said Long Chen disdainfully.

A sect with only three hundred and sixty thousand years of history might be considered an amazing existence in the mortal world. However, in the immortal world, that didn’t count for anything. That might not even be three generations of inheritance. Their founder was probably still alive and healthy.

Such a sect might look to be flourishing, but it was lacking in foundation. It was just like a stalk of bamboo that looked to soar rapidly, only to be empty inside.

A new power like this actually dared to challenge the Wine God Palace whose inheritance stretched back tens of millions of years? It was clearly an attempt to make a name for themselves.

Long Chen had seen many people like this. They relied on challenging others to increase their own fame. It was disgusting. Even if they lost the battle, they would brag that they once discussed the Dao with the Wine God Palace. Even though they lost, it still benefited them.

On the other hand, if the Wine God Palace rejected their challenge, they would say that the Wine God Palace didn’t dare to discuss the Dao with them. Such people were extremely hateful.

The Wine God Palace’s experts couldn’t be bothered to pay them any attention, but Long Chen wasn’t the same. If these people were going to be so hateful, he wouldn’t let them do as they please.

“I am the Wine God Palace’s guest. My understanding of the Wine Dao isn’t very deep, but it should be enough to discuss the Dao with you. Since you came to discuss the Dao, you should also be clear on the truth. Let’s skip the pleasantries and just start.” said Long Chen lightly.

“Alright, then today, let us see whose Dao discussion is superior!”

That man called senior apprentice-brother Qing Yu smiled. A sinister light appeared in his eyes.

Seeing that gaze, a disdainful smile appeared on Long Chen’s face. If he didn’t properly teach these little fellows a lesson, they wouldn't know just how dangerous this world was.
