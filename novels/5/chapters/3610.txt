Chapter 3599

“This is how you admit your past mistakes?”

When Guo Ran saw Xie Liuer and Leng Hui, he found that they didn’t have much shame on their faces. It was different from the sight of them kowtowing and crying as they begged for mercy, which was what Guo Ran had been imagining.

“No, we aren’t here to admit to our mistakes. We came to discuss the war and how to join forces against our common enemies,” said Leng Hui.

Xie Liuer added, “The path of cultivation is one where experts strive to defeat each other. Experts are not born that way but are made through competition. This competition is a path every king must take. It doesn’t matter whether the competition is good or bad; it is an iron law that the strong win and the weak lose. The winner is the king, and since you’ve won, you are the king. We came to express our respect for the king, but that doesn’t mean that we did anything wrong before.”

Guo Ran was struck speechless. When did these two gain such clever tongues? He actually had no words to counter them.

They had clearly suppressed him and left him furious, but from their words, it was as if he had to be grateful and thank them for it.

“Experts are respected in the cultivation world, so who doesn’t want to become an expert? To become an expert, you can only continuously challenge other experts. Only then can you make the greatest improvements. We do not believe that we have done anything wrong,” said Leng Hui.

“Bullshit! If you wanted to challenge experts, why didn’t you challenge Wang Zixu?! You’re clearly challenging soft persimmons!” raged Guo Ran.

“Are you a soft persimmon?” asked Xie Liuer.

“You…”

Guo Ran was once more left at a loss for words. He didn’t know how to respond.

Long Chen smiled. “The two of you have memorized your script very well. It’s rare for people to prepare themselves like this.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Leng Hui and Xie Liuer’s calm expressions twitched when they heard that.

Guo Ran exclaimed, “No wonder you two are so eloquent today! This little Leng fellow, you normally just keep repeating the same arrogant words of crap, but you’re actually talking reason today. So you came prepared!” Guo Ran had originally been feeling like these two were acting a bit odd today. Other than saying arrogant words, these two never talked so clearly to him.

After being exposed by Long Chen, the two were a bit panicked, but they had already come and could only thicken their faces. Leng Hui clenched his teeth and said, “That’s simply natural. To lower one’s head to an expert is not embarrassing. If you want to humiliate us, then go ahead and humiliate us like we did to you. We can endure it.”

“Fuck, if you put it like this, I won’t even be in the mood to do it! It seems that you calculated everything perfectly, eh?!” raged Guo Ran.

How could you slap someone who wanted to forge a good relationship with you? Guo Ran was not a person with a vast heart, but if people were going to come to him and ask to be humiliated, there was no way he could do it. Hence, he found himself angry, with nowhere to vent.

The two of them didn’t say a word in response to this. They had clearly come with various preparations in their minds.

It seemed that the seniors behind them had given them pointers. Moreover, they had used various moves to harass Guo Ran. Having accurately judged Guo Ran’s character, they came up with a plan first.

“Leave it be. Guo Ran has told me about your matters. You guys have grievances between you, but it is only the result of finding the other side displeasing and not to the point of touching the bottom line. There is still room to discuss things. With powerful enemies right before us, I hope that everyone can temporarily put aside their past grievances and focus on our common enemies. Let us resolve the crisis before us before discussing anything else,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, you’re going to make me suffer this grievance silently?” demanded Guo Ran a bit unhappily.

“There’s no other way. If you want to wear the crown, you have a heavy responsibility on your shoulders. You should learn from the dean. He endured for thousands of years before he finished his arrangements this time,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“Then why can’t you ever endure? You were the ones who taught us to go all-out no matter what, to look down on life and death, and that the Dragonblood Legion can eat anything except a loss,” said Guo Ran stubbornly.

Long Chen angrily clapped him on the back of his head. “Your wings have toughened enough to stand up against your boss, huh? You’ve endured for over a year, and now you talk about going all-out and looking down on life and death?”

Guo Ran’s neck contracted upon being struck. Still aggrieved, he said, “Didn’t I only endure because I had no other choice back then? Now that boss is here, why do I still have to endure?”

Long Chen was speechless. He was about to reply when Xie Liuer and Leng Hui suddenly walked forward. They got down on one knee in front of him and cupped their fists.

“Dean Guo Ran, if you are displeased inside, then the two of us apologize for everything right here.”

This formality immediately made Guo Ran feel a bit embarrassed. He hastily said, “I, Guo Ran, am not such a petty person. Get up. I just… I just… I just don’t feel happy inside. Why were you allowed to bully me so brazenly, but now that it’s my turn to vent, I can’t? What kind of justice is this? Can it be that this is the tribulation fated to come into my life?”

Guo Ran pulled the two of them up. Although he still grumbled, his expression had improved quite a bit. This action of theirs had instantly dissipated quite a bit of his resentment.

In truth, Guo Ran was not planning on doing anything much to the two of them. He needed to take on a certain attitude, and this solemn apology was precisely what he needed.

Long Chen smiled slightly. The advice that their seniors had given these two was well done. Even the tempo was grasped very well.

Furthermore, kneeling on one knee was a specific etiquette given by disciples to the dean. Guo Ran was the proxy dean, his status equivalent to the dean’s.

If they went on both knees, it would be begging for mercy. As heavenly geniuses, the two probably couldn’t accept such humiliation, but this other etiquette was acceptable, and it could also resolve Guo Ran’s resentment. Their seniors truly had good heads.

Guo Ran raised the two of them. The three of them then exchanged a glance and couldn’t help but burst into laughter. This one laugh caused all the hostility in their hearts to vanish.

Humans were very curious lifeforms, their emotions inexplicable. Sometimes, they could be consumed by vengeance until death, and sometimes they could wipe away grievances with a laugh.

“Dean Guo Ran, we know that you’re unhappy inside, and so are we. You said that you are an ascender from the lower world who didn’t bring anything with you. But we have our families, our seniors, and our special resources. That’s the only reason we managed to reach our current height. But you, with nothing, still managed to charge your way up. How could we feel that this is just? If we were surpassed by you, wouldn’t we be laughingstocks? So how could we not suppress you?” said Leng Hui helplessly.

Guo Ran laughed at them, feeling much better inside. This was another way of praising him. This little fellow always liked hearing other people praising him. He was quite vain.

“Alright, then since we have buried the hatchet, let us sit and discuss the battle plan!”

Long Chen got to the important point, as he didn’t have that much time to waste. The Alldevil race was related to Lord Brahma. There might be some secret within that could be useful to him, so he had to quicken the pace. He could feel that the closer he got to the truth, the closer he got to danger.
