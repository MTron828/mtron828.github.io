Chapter 3668

Long Chen sneered inside when he heard this. He hadn’t just come to the Violet Flame Heaven; he was actually right in front of him!

“Why didn’t you inform me sooner?!” demanded Liao Bencang. He was no longer calm.

Chen Ming was so frightened that he directly knelt on the ground. “Palace master, please quell your anger. Haven’t you been in seclusion all this time? I passed the information up long before this. Did you not see disciple’s letter once you left seclusion?”

Only then did Liao Bencang’s expression soften. “Rise. I wrongly blamed you. I have been busy helping Luocha awaken her Supreme Bone. Only once she awakens the Supreme Bone can her body endure the Luocha Possession. Then she’ll be able to unleash the Luocha race’s terrifying abilities. But because of this, I didn’t have time to deal with other things. I didn’t expect that little brat Long Chen to actually come to the Violet Flame Heaven.”

Seeing that Liao Bencang wasn’t blaming him, Chen Ming sighed with relief. He stood up. “It seems that I have to congratulate fairy Luocha on awakening her Supreme Bone. The Luocha secret arts from ten million years ago will finally reappear within the nine heavens and ten lands.”

“The current Luocha is no longer the old Luocha. However, she is still in seclusion. Once she comes out, a storm of blood will follow. By then, who cares about Long Chen or Ji Wuming? They can only quiver beneath Luocha’s foot.” Liao Bencang smiled proudly. He had full confidence in the Nine Underworld Luocha.

“I’ll make a trip and see if I can find out where that brat Long Chen is. You help me look after those two that I picked out. If they can easily pass the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror Trial, then once they recover, directly send them to the Nine Underworld Trials,” ordered Liao Bencang.

“The Nine Underworld Trials?! But…” Chen Ming was shocked.

The Nine Underworld Trials were the Nine Underworld Hall’s most difficult trials. Countless geniuses had entered, but the only one to pass in the last three million years was the Nine Underworld Luocha. That was why she was given that title.

“I don’t require them to pass all the trials. As long as they can pass the first five, it’s enough. The last four can be omitted. I want them to be Luocha’s attendants in the future. But it’s up to them if they have that power. Do as I say.” After saying that, Liao Bencang suddenly vanished. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes.”

Chen Ming still bowed respectfully even though Liao Bencang was gone. After a while, he also vanished.

“This idiot, you’re going to look for me when I’m right here? Let me just watch your show,” sneered Long Chen.

Liao Bencang wanted Long Chen to be his disciple? How shameless. Was he worthy of that honor? Just wait, this hive of his would quickly be torn apart!

The only thing that Long Chen was unable to comprehend was why the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror would suddenly produce death qi. Furthermore, according to Liao Bencang, this death qi first appeared when he entered the lightning pool. For the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror to react so oddly, was it because it also knew that it wouldn’t be surviving for long?

Another day quickly passed. Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others were still unconscious, and the second batch of people were also all unconscious now.

“Big brother Long Chen, I’ve devoured those lightning beasts!” Lei Linger sent word. Hearing this, Long Chen was startled. He saw that the lightning beasts at the core were still roaring and making a fuss.

However, when he sensed them more carefully, he found that they were no longer the old lightning beasts. They were now Lei Linger’s split bodies.

“Damn, that was fast!” Long Chen was speechless.

He had told Lei Linger to go slowly to not reveal anything that would expose them. It would be troublesome to be noticed.

However, Lei Linger was excited, and when she reached the point of being able to control half of the lightning pool’s energy, her attention turned to those lightning beasts.

She was very smart. She placed her own spiritual mark on those lightning beasts bit by bit. Just like slowly boiling a frog, she gained control of them bit by bit before devouring their energy. She then used her own split bodies to replace them.

In the end, she came to control all the lightning here, which meant that this entire lightning pool was at her disposal. When she returned to Long Chen’s body, this entire lightning pool would vanish.

“Big brother Long Chen, do you want to kill these people? I can kill them with the snap of my finger right now,” said Lei Linger.

There naturally was no chance that they could resist. They were all unconscious, so their life and death was entirely up to Lei Linger.

“Don’t kill them yet. Otherwise, the following act won’t be played. But you can place some time bombs in their bodies for now. Perhaps once their Blood Qi reaches a certain level, it will automatically detonate thunderforce. At that time, they won’t even have a corpse left,” said Long Chen.

“Hehe, that’s a good idea. I’ll place lightning seeds in their bodies right now.” Lei Linger giggled. She was in an excellent mood right now. After devouring so much lightning, her spirituality seemed to have increased. She had gained more of an extroverted personality.

Just as Lei Linger was placing lightning seeds in these people’s bodies, Long Chen snuck his way into the core. He then came to the giant heavenly pillar.

This was a stone pillar that was covered in natural Dao runes. When Long Chen arrived, Lei Linger appeared beside him as well.

“Big brother Long Chen, I’ve checked this pillar. It contains natural lightning runes and can convey lightning. The lightning clouds in the nine heavens are up above, and there are magnetic ores down below. The ores are drawing the lightning from the clouds up above through the stone pillar to form this lightning sea. The lightning clouds, the lightning pillar, and the magnetic ores are all necessary to form this special location. We can’t take them. As for the runes on the lightning pillar, they aren’t useful to me.” Lei Linger told Long Chen everything she knew about this place.

“So that’s the case.” Long Chen was a bit disappointed. He had thought about taking this stone pillar and making another lightning pool for Lei Linger.

However, if Lei Linger was saying this, then he could only scrap that idea. This lightning pool was a natural treasured land that no man could create.

“Alright, then when we’re leaving, destroy those natural runes on the pillar. That way, the lightning clouds and the magnetic ores down below will be useless.”

If they couldn’t be taken, then they could be broken. Otherwise, if they were left, they would only help raise more killing machines.

“Hehe, a minor matter. I can handle it.” Lei Linger giggled and got to work.

On the third day, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the assassins began to wake up.

Once they awoke, they felt invigorated. Their Blood Qi was flowing vigorously, and their minds were refreshed. It felt like they had transformed.

Guo Ran was also given a pleasant surprise. His physical body was originally very powerful, but now it was strengthened once more. As a result, his Blood Qi was stronger. Also, the stronger he was, the better he would be at controlling his Supreme Bone.

Xia Chen also made huge gains. With Lei Linger looking after him, his soul energy had gone through repeated tempering through the lightning. It was now completely pure. When he used talismans in the future, there would no longer be the slightest delay. Everything would go according to his will.

“The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror Trial is open!”

Just then, an icy voice rang out and a spatial gate opened on the side of the lightning sea. When it opened, a torrential battle will crashed down on all of them.
