Chapter 4203: Bad Premonition

This was a question that had been hovering in Long Chen’s mind for a long time now. Long Chen also had violet blood flowing within his body, so according to reason, he should feel closer to people with violet blood.

In the Luo family, Long Chen could sense the close bloodline call. On the other hand, Long Chen only felt disgust toward the Xu family.

Long Chen had no proof, but that didn’t stop him from brazenly guessing. As a result, the Xu family’s experts were all enraged.

“Who the fuck do you think you are to blaspheme my Violet Blood race?! Face your death!” Violet qi erupted out of Xu Yifeng as he prepared to attack.

“Long Chen, the Sage King Convention is about to start, but you’re still so bored as to cause trouble here?”

Following that pretty voice, a woman in a multicolored dress floated over like a cloud.

It was Jiang Feng Fei, and behind her were hundreds of thousands of the Jiang clan’s disciples. As for those who could stand side by side with her, there were actually three of them. Their auras were on the same level as hers.

Feng Fei was viewed favorably by the Jiang clan as her power was astonishing. Thus, she was definitely a peak existence amongst Supreme heavenly geniuses.

Upon her arrival, Feng Fei didn’t even look at the Xu family. In fact, she didn’t even look at Xu Yifeng and just greeted Long Chen with a faint smile.

Long Chen shrugged helplessly. “You know that I don’t cause trouble. Rather, it’s other people finding trouble for me.”

“Haha, you should hurry up. Whatever personal grievances you have can be settled on the martial stage. If you were to fight here, outsiders would interfere, and it would be difficult to have a decisive fight. Why waste the time? If you miss getting there in time and are rejected outside the martial stage, that would be too regretful. I’ve been anticipating your display all this time,” said Feng Fei expectantly.

“Who are you?”

Looking at Feng Fei greeting Long Chen so warmly, Bai Shishi coldly asked who she was.

Feng Fei smiled slightly at Bai Shishi’s vigilant expression. “I am an old acquaintance of Long Chen. Did he not tell you about me?”

“Hey, don't spout nonsense!” Seeing Bai Shishi’s expression, Long Chen hastily called out. This Feng Fei was trying to set him up!

“Hahaha!” Feng Fei laughed. Covering her mouth as she laughed, she said, “Who would have thought that the peerless hero of the Martial Heaven Continent, who is still peerless in the immortal world, would have such a side? Hahaha!”

“Long Chen, who is she?” demanded Bai Shishi. She was getting uncomfortable with Feng Fei’s actions. She felt provoked.

This could be fatal. Long Chen didn’t know how to explain. That was because he and Feng Fei had no relationship at all. But if he were to explain it this way, Bai Shishi would feel like he was hiding something.

Enjoying the tense atmosphere, Feng Fei actually winked at Long Chen. After that, she left, passing by Long Chen and the Xu family’s people.

“Long Chen, who is she? Why are you so nervous around her?” pressed Bai Shishi. Jealousy was after all a common trait among women, and Bai Shishi was particularly wary of Feng Fei's unmatched beauty.

“She…” Long Chen didn’t know how to explain.

“Shishi, this woman was trying to get Long Chen in trouble just to make you press Long Chen like this. Don’t fall for it,” said Yu Qingxuan with a smile.

Hearing this, Long Chen had the urge to kiss Yu Qingxuan. In the end, it was Yu Qingxuan who was more sensible. As for Bai Shishi, she looked shrewd but was in truth fatally naive.

“I’m not falling for anything, alright?” Bai Shishi turned her nose up and looked away. However, she couldn’t help but ask, “Did she know you from the mortal world?”

Long Chen nearly stumbled. When emotions took hold of women, they could act quite foolishly. Yu Qingxuan was the one who smiled and dragged Bai Shishi away, whispering in her ear.

Through Feng Fei’s interference, Long Chen's killing intent had mostly faded. Just as Feng Fei said, attacking people here wasn’t very effective.

Considering that Xu family’s old fellows were present, unless Long Chen could kill all the disciples in one move, the old fellows would likely intervene. He also knew that this course of action was not very realistic.

“Let’s go.”

Long Chen ignored the Xu family’s people and started walking up the staircase. Although he still wasn’t sure if they were traitors of the Violet Blood race, it didn’t matter either way. If they dared to provoke him, he would slaughter them all.

“So you admit that you’re a coward?” sneered an expert of the Xu family.

Long Chen ignored them, while Gu Yang and the others frowned but didn’t say anything. They began to chat and walk up the stairs.

“What a shame. Just a bit off!”

The palace master sighed regretfully. Seeing his disappointment, Bai Zhantang and the other vice palace master exchanged a look. They both knew that the palace master wished that Long Chen would attack so he would have an excuse to join in the battle.

However, Long Chen didn’t know about this thirst of the palace master. He was just walking up the stairs with Gu Yang and the others.

Once they were on the stairs, just as Long Chen expected, a formation was applying pressure on them. However, this pressure was nothing to Long Chen and the others.

Long Chen asked his brothers and found that Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were brought here by their masters. Moreover, their inheritances were ancient, and they also had their own immortal character totems.

Curiously, the way they cultivated was about the same. With the help of their masters, they had directly branded the immortal characters onto their bodies.

This way, even when the Sage King Convention ended, they would be able to continue comprehending the characters over time. Although the tattoos looked a bit ugly, they were very helpful for their future.

According to what they knew, after comprehending these characters, they would be inscribed in their bloodline. Apparently, their masters had put in a great deal of work to do this for them. In fact, the masters had even sacrificed some of their longevity to create this opportunity for them.

On the other hand, Yue Zifeng was different from the three of them. His inheritance land was a sword mound, and all sword cultivators could gain comprehension from it. But when they asked what Yue Zifeng had obtained from it, he simply smiled and didn’t answer.

A while after Long Chen and the others started climbing, the martial stage suddenly emerged from the ground. Seawater gushed forth from the four sides of the martial stage.

A deep blue waterfall rose, forming a giant water barrier covering the martial stage. Now, the martial stage was fully separated from the land.

Long Chen’s expression changed slightly when this blue water screen appeared. Sensing that change, Bai Shishi asked, “What is it?”

“I have some kind of bad premonition.” Long Chen’s gaze sharpened as he looked at the blue canopy.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
