“Hehe, perhaps this is fate,” laughed Feng Fei. Seeing Long Chen’s shocked expression, she knew that he understood.

“The four divine families? Hold it, can I ask you a question?” asked Long Chen.

“Go ahead. I will answer it honestly,” replied Feng Fei.

“Is your Jiang clan also the descendants of the Jiuli race?”

“Looks like you finally know your origins. The four divine families are all descendants of the Jiuli race, but we have different constitutions and talents, resulting in us inheriting different divine abilities. The Jiang, Ye, and Zhao clans pass down their inheritance through runes. However, your Long clan has one advantage over us. That’s your bloodline inheritance,” answered Feng Fei.

“Bloodline inheritance? How come I don’t know about that?” Long Chen asked, his brows furrowed in confusion.

“I’m not sure. But in our records, it is noted that your Long clan has an additional bloodline inheritance compared to us. If you want proof, it’s quite simple. You and your father have seven-color Supreme Blood, correct? You just need to activate the rune in your Dantian, and it will appear as a manifestation,” said Feng Fei.

Dantian? The main thing is that I really don’t have one. Long Chen sighed, but he suddenly thought of his father.

Once Long Zhantian was rescued, his cultivation base skyrocketed at an astonishing rate, surpassing Long Chen’s in a short time. Could this be related to the bloodline inheritance? Perhaps his father was truly someone who had fully awakened the Jiuli inheritance.

Feeling Feng Fei’s stare at him, Long Chen shook his head. “It’s not like you don’t know. When I was a baby, they dug out my Spirit Root, Spirit Bone, and Spirit Blood. My Dantian is empty. Although I took back what’s rightfully mine, it’s too late.”

Pain flashed across Feng Fei’s eyes. “I’m sorry. I forgot.”

Feng Fei recalled how her own and the others’ Dantian had harbored a dormant rune. Back then, they didn’t have enough power to awaken it, only enough to preserve it.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, Long Chen had his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone taken as a child. Furthermore, he grew up in the mortal world, where the inheritance rune naturally withered without sustenance. Thinking of this, Feng Fei felt sorry for Long Chen.

“It’s fine. At least, I’m not inferior to anyone. When you lose something, you also gain something. The world works in mysterious ways,” replied Long Chen with a smile.

Seeing his smile, Feng Fei also smiled. This was precisely why she idolized him. Despite everything that happened to him, he never lowered his head to fate. He dared to challenge all the injustices the world threw at him.

Such resilience and defiance were qualities she hadn’t found in anyone else she had encountered, no matter how powerful they were.

Long Chen seemed to embody the strengths and weaknesses of everyone he encountered. He was a complex figure with irresistible charisma.

“What are the three divine clans doing in the Long clan this time? Is it for a competition before entering the Eternal realm?” asked Long Chen.

“You really are smart. You’re right. The four clans are preparing to conduct a friendly spar to learn from each other. The focal point will be the clashes between Heavenly Chosens. Through the clash of Doyen energy, it may trigger the Heavenly Fate Disks into manifesting sooner,” said Feng Fei.

“Manifesting?” Long Chen was startled. It seemed there was more to being a Heavenly Chosen than he had realized.

Feng Fei explained, “True Heavenly Chosens have a complete Doyen manifestation. The likes of us are considered candidates to achieve that level. But there is one important point: not everyone with a Heavenly Fate Disk can condense a Doyen manifestation. Legends say that the number of Doyen manifestations is limited, and no two manifestations can exist at the same time. Each manifestation also has its unique name. Once awakened, the Heavenly Fate Disk can unleash its full power. According to my elders, our dormant Heavenly Fate Disks are just the tip of the iceberg compared to those with awakened manifestations.”

“Damn. It seems I’ve underestimated Heavenly Chosens too much,” Long Chen muttered, taking a deep breath. If what Feng Fei said was true, Heavenly Chosens possessed terrifying potential.

“That’s right. Besides this, after the sparring, we’ll enter the joint world of the four divine clans for our tribulation. The laws there are particularly suited to us. Are you going to come?” asked Feng Fei.

“I might not,” replied Long Chen, shaking his head. After all, he had agreed with Mo Nian to go to the Brahma Pill Valley’s Heavenly Flame Devil Domain.

As for the tribulation, Long Chen was prepared to face it anywhere, but ideally, it would be best if he ran into his enemy’s headquarters for it. If he was lucky, perhaps he could sweep them out with it.

Hearing that, Feng Fei looked disappointed. She asked, “Then are you going to enter the High Firmament Academy’s secret realm?”

Long Chen shook his head and replied, “I can’t say. I don’t want to lie to you.”

It wasn’t that Long Chen didn’t trust Feng Fei, but for something like this, every additional person aware of the plan increased the risk. After all, this matter didn’t just involve him.

“Will you never lie to me?” Feng Fei asked with a faint smile, not offended by his refusal

“I can’t promise that. What if one day you become my enemy? After all, when I get ruthless, I’ll lie even to myself,” replied Long Chen with a smile of his own.

Feng Fei chuckled, but the moment was interrupted by the appearance of a group of people before them.

Time had passed swiftly during their conversation, and before they knew it, Long Chen and Feng Fei found themselves in the inner plaza of the Long clan. Disciples from the other three clans had gathered there, admiring the unique architecture of the Long clan.

The Long clan’s disciples were enthusiastically explaining the details of various constructions—names, histories, and uses—to their visitors. In contrast, the disciples from the other clans listened with indifference, their gazes coldly sweeping across the surroundings.

When Long Chen and Feng Fei walked in, a large group of young men and women wearing the same robes as Feng Fei immediately walked toward them.

Long Chen examined those people. The power of the Jiang clan was truly immense; they had thousands of nine star Doyens. Moreover, they had over ten Heavenly Chosens like Feng Fei. This fact surprised Long Chen and highlighted the Jiang clan’s considerable strength compared to the Long clan.

“Big Sister Feng Fei? Is he the one you keep talking about? He doesn’t look that impressive though,” said an icy-faced man as he examined Long Chen stubbornly.

Long Chen glanced at the man and then turned his gaze back to Feng Fei. It seemed that she had made a new enemy for him… again.

“That’s right, he is the idol I worship, the man of my dreams. Are you not convinced?” Feng Fei teased playfully. She reached out and intimately grabbed Long Chen’s arm, causing a visible shift in the expressions of the Jiang clan’s disciples.
