Chapter 2519 Sea God’s Trident

One disciple after another appeared, all belonging to the divine families. They then stared blankly at their surroundings, not knowing what was going on.

The altar was large enough that even as more and more of them arrived, they didn’t fill the entire altar.

“Long Chen, what’s going on?”

At this time, the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion’s warriors also appeared. When they saw Long Chen on the other side and then the Corrupt disciples before them, they guessed something.

In just a few minutes, an army of almost three million disciples of the divine families appeared, and more were arriving by the second.

“Disciples of the divine families, hear my orders! Send your life energy into the altar!” shouted Zhao Ritian.

The disciples had yet to understand what was going on, but since Zhao Ritian was a Sovereign sprout of the divine families, they had no choice but to listen to his orders.

With the addition of almost three million disciples, enormous amounts of life energy poured into the altar. As a result, the flames burning on the altar were instantly suppressed and almost extinguished.

“There’s no need to keep focusing on defense. Help Long Chen!” Meng Qi immediately placed her hands on Long Chen’s back. Her Spiritual Strength gushed into him. At the same time, her manifestation appeared behind her.

Her manifestation was a wonderland filled with immortal mist. Pavilions dotted the land with creeks of running water, and cranes sang their songs in the clouds. Every Dragonblood warrior felt like they were unable to distinguish between true and false within this world.

Meng Qi had also fully awakened her manifestation. With the Dragonblood warriors within her manifestation, their Spiritual Strength was automatically absorbed by her and sent toward Long Chen.

Only Guo Ran stepped out, standing guard. His Spiritual Strength was so weak that his participation wouldn’t make a difference. Hence, he stood on guard for a sneak attack.

There was one other person who wasn’t helping. Wilde was currently stuffing his face with a bowl that was constantly being replenished with the bodies of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders. He had used up so much energy that he was starving.

“Long Chen, they have too many people. We can’t last much longer,” transmitted Meng Qi.

The addition of the divine families meant that the other side had an ocean’s worth of life energy. They almost instantly extinguished the karmic hell flames.

Even with Meng Qi and the others joining Long Chen, they were barely able to keep some flames burning. Their Spiritual Strength was being rapidly consumed just for that.

“No need to worry. I trust that our reinforcements will arrive quickly,” said Long Chen.

Just at that moment, countless figures began flying over. They were the experts of the Xuan Beasts. Their backs were covered with people wearing the robes of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we’ve come!”

The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples roared. On their way here, they had joined up with the experts of the Xuan Beasts. Their speed was greater, allowing them to rush over here as quickly as possible.

Just as the Dragonblood Legion was facing off with millions of the divine families’ experts, they charged into Meng Qi’s manifestation without a second thought.

As more and more of them joined, Spiritual Strength poured into Long Chen. The karmic hell flames began to blossom once more.

“Fairy Nangong, fairy Beitang, and the Zither Fairy have come!”

Guo Ran cried out excitedly. The three fairies came together, followed by the disciples of their own factions.

“Sorry for being late,” apologized Nangong Zuiyue.

The three of them immediately entered Meng Qi’s manifestation. Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang formed hand seals, unleashing their full Spiritual Strength for Meng Qi.

As for the Zither Fairy, her fingers danced across the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither. As her divine music resounded through the air, it revealed the invisible spiritual connection between Long Chen and the flames burning on the altar.

As her music played, runes began to flow from the outside, strengthening this connection.

Long Chen was surprised. The Zither Fairy was truly amazing. With her music, she was able to construct a specialized spiritual channel for him.

At least half of the Spiritual Strength he had been sending over was dispersed in the air, but with her help now, none of his Spiritual Strength was being wasted.

More and more experts come. The people of the ancient races arrived, but they didn’t immediately join the Xuan Beasts. They hesitated.

They couldn’t tell who to join. The divine families were enemies with Long Chen. If they stood beside the Xuan Beasts at this time, it would be publicly going against the divine families. This one decision could end them if they made the wrong choice.

However, the ancient races had only come with twenty thousand people. The Xuan Beasts And the divine families were ignoring them.

After a fierce struggle, a portion of the ancient races flew over to Meng Qi’s manifestation, choosing to stand beside the Xuan Beasts.

“Divine daughter, what should we do?” Three hundred experts of Pill Valley arrived. Seeing the Pill Fairy standing to the side, they didn’t know what to do.

The Pill Fairy frowned. If she said that they should go join the divine families, that would be breaking her agreement with Yun Tian. They had agreed not to further interfere in this battle.

She cursed this person for being foolish. Considering that Long Chen was Pill Valley’s mortal enemy, did this person even need to ask?

“Idiot, get over here! She has decided to limit herself along with Yun Tian. She can’t give you orders!” shouted Zhao Ritian furiously.

Those experts looked at the Pill Fairy. Her expression remained as icy as ever.

The leader hesitated but then led Pill Valley’s disciples into the camp of the divine families.

More and more of the divine families’ disciples were arriving. The divine families had entered with five million disciples, and now over four million of them had come.

As for those who hadn’t come, either they were too far to sense the transportation formation, or they were dead.

As for the ancient family alliance’s disciples, it was unknown if they even knew that Di Feng was dead. They immediately joined the divine families’ side.

“Where is Lingshan?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“It’s strange, she’s not here. We saw her on our way here,” said someone curiously.

Over five hundred thousand disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance had arrived by now, but Ye Lingshan had not appeared. That made people’s hearts sink. Such a thing shouldn’t happen.

However, there was no time to think about it. Long Chen’s full focus was on the altar. He could not allow Ye Ming to revive the Heaven Devouring Fiend King. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If it was revived, then those fellows hanging off the tree roots might wake up immediately. Who knew just how many of them were hidden beneath the ground?

“Hahaha, Long Chen, ah, Long Chen. I’ve finally found you.”

Suddenly, ear-piercing laughter rang out from above. The Six Horn Sea Serpent appeared along with an endless army of sea demons.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent smiled sinisterly. “Long Chen, we didn’t have time to decide a winner back then. This time, I’ll beat you properly.”

“How shameless. You couldn’t decide a winner? If you didn’t have a Death Substitute Talisman last time, you would no longer exist in this world,” cursed Guo Ran disdainfully. This sea demon’s face was truly thick to call his fight with Long Chen a draw.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent was infuriated. He extended a hand, and a golden trident appeared. This trident was completely different from his old bone trident. This one was completely golden and covered in different runes.

“Last time, you used your numbers to your advantage. But now, I’ll show you the true power of the sea demon race!” roared the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

“Don’t bother with that for now! Bring your people over here!” shouted Zhao Ritian.

Due to Zi Yan’s addition, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength had solidified, and the flames were growing more and more intense. Even the divine families’ immense life energy was unable to suppress the flames.

“You guys go over. I’ll kill Long Chen. To use the human race’s words, I’ll pull the carpet from right underneath him.”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent ordered his subordinates to assist Ye Ming, while he went to attack the Dragonblood Legion.

“I’ll pull your dad’s carpet!” cursed Guo Ran, already attacking.

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s sabers exploded, and the trident slammed into his chest, creating a huge dent in it. Guo Ran was sent flying.

Everyone jumped in shock. Guo Ran’s combat power was comparatively high. How could he be unable to receive a single blow from his opponent?

What they were unaware of was that Guo Ran’s sabers had been damaged in combat against Zhao Ritian. The other factor was just how terrifying the golden trident was.

“Idiot, this Golden Sea God Trident is a priceless treasure of the sea demon race. I didn’t possess the power to control it before, but now I can show all you inferior humans just how superior the sea demon race is.” The Six Horn Sea Serpent raised his head and laughed. Golden light erupted from his trident as he charged at the Dragonblood Legion.

Everyone’s expression changed, including the people on the side of the divine families. They cursed him for being brainless and not choosing his words.

A giant door bolt slammed toward him, but the Six Horn Sea Serpent merely sneered and swung his trident.

Wilde was sent flying just like Guo Ran. After fighting for so long and without enough time to recover, he was no longer in his peak condition.

“Long Chen, come out and fight!” shouted the Six Horn Sea Serpent. He was filled with new confidence and wished to wipe away his previous disgrace in front of everyone.

Meng Qi and the others’ expressions changed. Long Chen could not be allowed to leave at this time. The core fighters also couldn’t leave because they needed to send him their Spiritual Strength.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others had vast Spiritual Strength, which was essential at this time. Beitang Rushuang, Nangong Zuiyue, and the others were also in crucial nodes. If they left, the Spiritual Strength of the people connecting to them would be severed. Those people would have no choice but to send their Spiritual Strength directly to Long Chen, which was extremely inefficient.

Even with how vast Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was, he couldn’t control the Spiritual Strength of millions of experts without anyone helping him.

As a result, there was no one in a position capable of stopping the Six Horn Sea Serpent. They cursed him for coming at the worst time possible.

The Pill Fairy looked at Yun Tian to see him simply standing there. It seemed he had no intention of interfering. Instead, he was looking in a certain direction.

Light suddenly flashed. A bone tile smashed toward the back of the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

BOOM!

He swung the golden trident behind him, smashing the bone tile. However, the bone tile did not break, and it sent him staggering forward.

“Who’s there?!” demanded the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

A pillar of light descended from the sky, enveloping him. After that, a giant die manifested in midair, trapping him within.

“This inferior human is Hu Feng. I’m here to experience the sea god’s peerless techniques.”

The refined, scholarly heir of the Gambling Heavenly Dao, Hu Feng, appeared in the air.
