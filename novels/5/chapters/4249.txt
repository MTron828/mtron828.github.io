Chapter 4238: Eternal Creature

When the karmic luck bead quivered, nine rays of divine light shot out of it, piercing the barrier around the martial stage.

As a result, nine huge holes appeared in the barrier. Wherever that divine light went, any dark creatures in their way were wiped out.

In a bit, one of those rays of divine light shot right past Long Chen and the others, making them jump in fright.

Another ray of divine light also pierced through the heart of the devil race’s army, instantly wiping out countless experts.

Witnessing this spectacle, a sense of horror overcame everyone present. And just as their astonishment reached its peak, an even more startling occurrence transpired.

The nine holes in the barrier actually turned into nine spatial gates. After that, the spatial gate at the very top, where the dark creatures were flooding out, also twisted, stopping the flood of dark creatures.

Black qi then swirled around that spatial gate, exuding an appalling pressure that was getting closer and closer, as if some monster was about to break through.

Seeing this scene, Mo Nian and Yan Wuji retreated at the same time. Neither of them was in the mood to keep fighting, so they were just staring up at the ten spatial gates in the sky.

The next moment, the ten gates quivered and nine giant spatial gates opened, along with the appearance of nine enormous figures. Long Chen couldn’t help gasping when he saw them.

“Innate Heaven Venerate dark domain lords!”

These dark domain lords not only had reached the level of an innate Heaven Venerate, but they also had dark gold marks on their bodies.

Given that Long Chen had fought multiple dark domain lords in the life-forbidden area, he was well aware of just how terrifying they were.

However, the dark domain lord from back then only had a few dark gold marks on its body, whereas these dark domain lords had hundreds of those marks.

Even before they got close, their auras already terrified the people on the martial stage. Simply being in their presence made breathing difficult, as these dark domain lords were far stronger than the ones Long Chen had encountered in the life-forbidden area. They were simply not on the same level at all.

This difference was just as big as the distinction between innate Heaven Venerates and acquired Heaven Venerates. For nine of these terrifying existences to appear at once, if they were to attack, no one knew just how many people on the martial stage would survive.

Just as everyone was shocked by these nine dark domain lords, the central, largest spatial gate quivered. They could see an enormous figure forcing its way out of that gate.

“Heavens!”

When they saw that figure, even the senior Heaven Venerates were horrified. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This was an absolutely enormous dark creature. While the previous dark creatures were like large mountains, this one was a heaven-shrouding existence that dwarfed the other dark creatures. What was most terrifying, however, was that every mark on its body bore that ominous dark gold hue.

Unable to contain its body, the spatial gate was fracturing as its enormous body gradually passed through.

Everyone saw that it was a winged dark creature, crowned with a formidable-looking horn on its head. As its entire form was unveiled, a terrifying pressure crashed down on all of them. In response, the countless dark creatures inside the martial stage suddenly turned still, their bodies frozen.

“Fuck.”

When that dark creature’s pressure crashed down on Long Chen, he was filled with shock, not daring to believe what he was seeing.

“How can this be?! That’s an Eternal expert!”

Inside and outside of the martial stage, waves of shock rippled throughout the Sage King Prefecture. This winged dark creature actually possessed an Eternal aura, and its overwhelming pressure left the experts within the martial stage in a state of terror, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.

As for the experts outside, they stood frozen in horror, their gazes locked onto the creature, rendered speechless by the scene before them.

“How is this the Sage King martial stage?! This is clearly a trap to kill all the heavenly geniuses of the nine heavens!” roared one person furiously.

That was true. Who could possibly stop an Eternal expert? If the presence of the nine dark domain lords had left little hope for survival, then this Eternal creature would guarantee their demise.

Let alone these young disciples, even if all the members of the senior generation in this place joined forces, they wouldn’t be able to even scratch an Eternal expert.

Suddenly, the nine dark domain lords roared, their roars shaking the nine heavens. As silver runes lit up around their bodies, a terrifying pressure crashed down.

They immediately unleashed their full power, and their auras had an indescribable emotion to it, almost tragic. It seemed as if they were intent on dying along with everyone else here.

The nine dark domain lords were like nine suns, unleashing a blinding light. Their murderous auras rained down like a vast sea.

Surrounding the central Eternal dark creature, they were like the stars around the moon. Just like that, they slowly descended upon the heart of the martial stage.

“Wait, that winged creature, it’s a corpse!” Long Chen suddenly cried out.

In that instant, a spark of understanding illuminated Mo Nian's eyes, and he exclaimed with excitement, "I get it! They aren't here to kill us! They're all sacrificial offerings! Long Chen, if we disrupt this ceremony, we can secure our safety!"

After saying that, Mo Nian suddenly shot toward one of those dark domain lords.

“Our fight isn’t over. You think that you can run?”

Suddenly, Yan Wuji appeared right behind Mo Nian, launching a punch at the back of Mo Nian’s head.

BOOM!

Without even looking back, Mo Nian raised his shovel and blocked Yan Wuji’s attack. As his pace accelerated, he sneered, “Yan Wuji, you really are the bad sort to eat shit. You are the mastermind behind this treachery, aren’t you? You’re trying to kill everyone on the martial stage!”

“Shut your fucking mouth!” Yan Wuji furiously cursed him and continued attacking.

“If you didn’t set this trap, why are you stopping me from ruining the sacrificial ceremony? As expected, you really aren’t a good person. But I didn’t expect you to be so treacherous. Other than eating shit, what good are you at?”

.

Mo Nian refused to get entangled with Yan Wuji. He directly shot toward those slowly descending dark domain lords as he blocked Yan Wuji’s attacks.

Countless people were startled and enraged by what they were hearing. If it really was as Mo Nian said, then Yan Wuji was truly treacherous.

Even though many of the crowd were not aware of the plots, this was called taking the initiative. The first impression was always the strongest, and the majority of people felt more willing to believe Mo Nian. After all, Mo Nian was trying to stop this slaughter, and Yan Wuji was trying to stop Mo Nian.

Just as Yan Wuji was pursuing Mo Nian, Long Chen also shot to a nearby spatial gate. However, just as he moved, a sharp ray of Sword Qi pierced toward him.
