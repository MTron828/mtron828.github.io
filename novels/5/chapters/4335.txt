Chapter 4324: Plan Failure

The first spatial transportation succeeded, and the three of them immediately underwent successive transportations. The formation discs that Xia Chen had set up were finally put to use.

No matter how fast Long Chen was, he wasn’t as fast as spatial transportations. Moreover, since it was just the three of them, it was much easier, and they were able to go much farther.

After seven transportations, they were getting closer and closer to the gate. However, that only made them more nervous.

“Boss, are we really just going to barge through?” asked Guo Ran.

The humanless world’s experts couldn’t possibly be so stupid that they wouldn’t lock down the exit.

Even if they were pigs, they would definitely send countless experts to guarantee that the exit was blocked. Furthermore, they would all be the top experts of this world, the members of the senior generation. That was because the experts of the junior generation had all been sent to hunt them down.

Members of the senior generation? Then they had to be Eternals. Furthermore, it wouldn’t just be one or two, so charging over like this was truly too dangerous.

“There’s no choice. We must charge our way through. If we stay here, we won’t be able to undergo tribulation, and we’ll waste our time. Even if the gate opens and the humanless world is fully connected to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, our people might not necessarily be able to assist us. After all, the humanless world has too many experts,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen knew what Guo Ran was thinking. He wanted to hide here. In any case, with Xia Chen’s formations, as long as they hid themselves, the experts here wouldn’t be able to find them.

However, what about their tribulations? Were they supposed to keep their cultivation bases suppressed the entire time?

If they did undergo tribulation, then afterward, Long Chen would definitely be exhausted or even mortally wounded. After that, he would definitely be slaughtered.

Moreover, the cultivation world had already changed. Every person was doing their best to get stronger with all their power, not daring to waste a single day.

If the three of them hid here while everyone else underwent tribulation and became World Kings, they would really be doomed.

Leaving aside all other considerations, the peak heavenly geniuses of the humanless world were already existences that Long Chen could just barely handle, so if they underwent tribulation and became World Kings while Long Chen was still in the Immortal King realm, he would definitely die if he ran into them.

The dragon expert had previously said that Long Chen wasn’t a match for the top experts of this world. At first, Long Chen hadn’t accepted it, but now, he knew just how true that was.

The only reason he could now challenge these heavenly geniuses was because he had undergone the primal chaos eye’s baptism. He had gone through a complete transformation.

Back in the spirit pool, Long Chen had unleashed the Divine Dragon Pendulum Tail, not holding back at all. That was an attack that he thought would kill his opponent or at least gravely wound him.

However, that attack was barely capable of breaking through the defenses of that Blood expert. Furthermore, that Blood expert had smashed into a barrier made by Eternal experts and only coughed up some blood as a result. Although he was injured, it wasn’t serious. From this, it could be seen just how terrifying he was.

If Long Chen had encountered such an expert when he first entered this world, his chances of victory were abysmal. This was the difference in the environments they had grown up in. It was an immense natural gulf between them.

These terrifying experts were still growing with every passing day. If Long Chen lost his chance to undergo tribulation because he was hiding, then a huge gap would once more appear between them. Catching up in the future would be far too difficult.

Furthermore, the other side would not give him a chance to catch up either. They would slaughter him while he was still weak. Thus, he had to return to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, as only in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven would his cultivation not be delayed.

“Once we reach the exit, I’ll pour all my power into the Earth Cauldron. However, I have no guarantee that we’ll manage to barge through their barricade with just that. This is our last chance. When the time comes, if we can all leave together, then we’ll all leave. But if we can’t, then whoever has the chance has to leave first,” said Long Chen.

“Boss…!”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were startled. If that was the case, then Long Chen’s chances of leaving were the lowest.

When that time came, Long Chen would have used up all his energy. And against so many terrifying experts, how could he possibly survive?

“It’s decided. If I cannot leave, you must leave. Return to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven and undergo tribulation. Just raise your power, and come back to save me. Don’t worry about me. I’m the fastest on my own. They can’t catch up to me,” said Long Chen.

“But…

“No buts. Sometimes you just don’t have a choice,” said Long Chen firmly.

Long Chen was holding the two of them, but now, he suddenly let them go, and the two lagged behind him. At this time, a giant gate appeared before them.

The Earth Cauldron appeared in Long Chen’s hands. As his Spiritual Strength poured into the Earth Cauldron, it instantly blazed like a sun.

The Earth Cauldron illuminated this world, the gate, and also the countless figures around the gate.

Long Chen’s heart sank upon seeing those figures. Among them, he instantly spotted eight terrifying existences.

Those were eight Eternal experts. Clearly, this time, Long Chen’s luck wasn’t so good. He had been hoping that there would only be two or three Eternal experts, as that would already be giving the three of them face.

Unexpectedly, they had sent eight Eternals to stand guard. These experts didn’t have transportation formations or communication formations. In other words, they were not yet aware of the matter of the primal chaos eye, yet they had sent eight Eternals to guard his place. That meant, right from the start, they had decided to not let the three of them leave the humanless world.

“Wretched human race, do you think that you can leave?! Keep dreaming!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Long Chen appeared, those lifeforms immediately unleashed their powerful auras. The next moment, an Eternal expert roared and actually flew straight toward Long Chen, smashing a tiger claw at him.

“Fuck, we ran into an idiot!”

Long Chen’s heart sank. This Eternal expert was so stupid that he didn’t even sense the Earth Cauldron’s divine might and came up alone.

This was completely different from Long Chen’s expectations. He had thought that Eternal experts would have at least some brains and sharper senses. After sensing the power of the Earth Cauldron, they would join forces to lock down the gate.

However, his calculations were off as even the Eternal experts here were different. While they possessed formidable power, they had generally led peaceful lives, and their instincts for danger were not as keen.

Nonetheless, even if their sense of danger wasn’t very sharp, they should have been able to sense the Earth Cauldron’s terrifying desolate aura. Unfortunately, Long Chen’s luck wasn’t good this time. The other seven Eternal experts had sensed an immense danger and didn’t take any rash actions, choosing to defend.

There was only one pig-headed tiger who foolishly threw himself at Long Chen the moment he saw him.

Long Chen was shocked and enraged, but the arrow had left the string, so there was no going back.

“Idiot, die!”

Long Chen gritted his teeth and smashed toward him with the Earth Cauldron. With the support of his Spiritual Strength, the runes of the Earth Cauldron lit up, and its sacred aura shook heaven and earth.

Long Chen was unable to control the Earth Cauldron to fight. However, he could use an alchemy method to activate more of its runes.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, the Earth Cauldron struck that huge tiger claw, causing it to instantly explode.

The Earth Cauldron then continued to strike the eternal expert’s head and blew it apart. After that, the brain matter of an Eternal flew through the air.

“Die!”

Long Chen roared. After slaying that Eternal expert of the demonic beast race, Long Chen shot at the other Eternal experts.

Those seven Eternal experts were both startled and enraged. They joined forces to block the Earth Cauldron.

BOOM!

Amidst an explosive sound, the ten thousand Daos crumbled, and Long Chen grunted, coughing up blood. Due to his earlier clash with the Eternal expert, this attack was unable to breach their defenses, and he was halted in his tracks.

“Not good.”

Long Chen’s heart sank as his plan had failed.
