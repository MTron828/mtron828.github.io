Chapter 3662

In a barren desert, a red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, and violet divine ring quivered, forming a circular rainbow behind Long Chen.

“This is too awe-inspiring, isn’t it?!”

Seeing Long Chen standing there, appearing incredibly majestic and domineering with his divine ring behind him, Guo Ran was so envious that he almost wept.

That manifestation, this manifestation, who cared about them? Were any of them as beautiful as this seven-color divine ring? Even an ugly monster would look handsome and suave with this divine ring behind them.

Guo Ran’s eyes shone enviously. “Xia Chen, can you make me such a manifestation as well? That would be amazing! Good brother, make me one, and once I attract the ladies, let’s split them! How does that sound?”

Xia Chen rolled his eyes. Had Guo Ran gotten into the habit of looting? Could just anything be split in two?

“Every color of boss’s divine ring corresponds to a Heavenly Dao energy. You can’t control that anyway. Even if you had such a divine ring, it would have no use other than to show off. Why don’t I just set you up with a giant tail? Then when you see a pretty girl, you can just raise your butt like a peacock and show your feathers. You can write: little sister, do you want to mate?”

“Fuck, we’re brothers, are we not? It was just a joke! There’s no need to wound me like this!” complained Guo Ran.

“The main thing is that you were thinking that exact thing!” Xia Chen was speechless.

“But I always protected my purity in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College!” raged Guo Ran.

“There’s no need for you to protect it. You’ll stay pure anyway.” Xia Chen curled his lips.

He understood Guo Ran far too well. For someone like Guo Ran to have stayed in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College without finding a woman was not due to not having time; it was due to having no chance at all.

“Do you believe me when I say that I’ll use Gongsun Ziyi to attack you?” said Guo Ran wickedly.

“Tch, what I picked up, I put down. I’m not ashamed of anything. I’ve loved, I’ve hated. It’s all transient. Life is beautiful, but not perfect. I trust that I’ll definitely find a warm, caring, and considerate woman to share life together. But no matter what, at the very least, I can say that I have experience in this regard, unlike a certain someone… hehe!” Xia Chen’s smile was even more wicked than Guo Ran’s. He revealed his teeth.

Seeing that Xia Chen had walked out of the shadow of his first love, Guo Ran laughed. They were like real brothers, so he sincerely wished Xia Chen happiness.

“Then let’s not talk about love. That divine ring, make me one too!”

“Scram! I reject this work.” Seeing that they somehow managed to return to this topic, Xia Chen directly rejected him.

With Xia Chen’s current accomplishment, adding a divine ring to Guo Ran’s divine armor was no problem. Drawing in all kinds of energy was also no problem, but it would require a huge amount of time and energy.

The main point though was that if Guo Ran wanted to control all those kinds of energy, he would have to put in a great deal of work. To the lazy Guo Ran, that was definitely impossible. That was why Xia Chen rejected his plea.

Just as Xia Chen and Guo Ran were talking nonsense, Long Chen was standing in the air, sensing the power that the seven-colored divine ring gave him.

The violet color of the divine ring was clearly dimmer than the others. Its circulation was also not as smooth. It was going at a different tempo compared to the rest of the divine ring. That was because the Violet Tower Star had just undergone the first star transformation, so summoning the seven-color divine ring was pushing it.

At this moment, a strange sound came from Long Chen’s divine ring. A current of lightning streaked through it, and then other energies appeared within the divine ring.

“Metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, and lightning. Seven kinds of energy. So the violet ring represents lightning. No wonder Huo Linger’s recovery was faster despite both of them exhausting all of their power before this.”

Long Chen sensed the world’s thunderforce being summoned by a mysterious power when he circulated his divine ring.

At the same time, Lei Linger was also awoken. Thunderforce flowed through the divine ring and into Lei Linger’s body. She then directly absorbed it.

Long Chen smiled. Huo Linger had advanced a great deal, to the point of throwing Lei Linger behind. But now, the violet divine ring was like a lightning gate for Lei Linger.

Even without meticulously circulating the divine ring, Lei Linger could absorb the outside world’s thunderforce through Long Chen to slowly increase her own power and recovery rate. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

From today onward, Lei Linger would have the same edge as Huo Linger. Lei Linger was rather emotional. After the battle with Alldevil Tianye, Huo Linger had only taken ten days to fully recover, while she had only recovered to ninety percent even now.

“Don’t rush. The Violet Tower Star has just condensed. As it grows stronger, you will also grow stronger,” comforted Long Chen.

Contrary to Huo Linger, Lei Linger’s growth was restricted. She only managed to eat her fill during Long Chen’s tribulations and then had to starve the rest of the time.

After all, when it came to Huo Linger, Long Chen could buy and give her all kinds of flame element ores and flame seeds. She had also eaten her fill in the Heavenly Dragon Domain last time.

Lei Linger was always starving even as she supported Long Chen. Hence, she would always get incredibly excited for just a trace of thunderforce. Thinking of this, Long Chen felt guilty. He felt like he had let her down.

But then, there was no way around it. Lightning attribute treasures were far too rare. Furthermore, thunderforce was different from flame energy. There were many kinds of ores that could contain flame energy for long-term storage, but no such ores for thunderforce. Any ores that did contain thunderforce would have that thunderforce quickly dissipate as soon as they were mined and brought away from their source.

Hence, whether it was lightning attribute ores or weapons, they were very rare. Likewise, lightning cultivators were as rare as a phoenix feather or qilin horn.

Fortunately, with this seven-color divine ring, Long Chen would at least be able to provide some nourishment to Lei Linger. This also drew Long Chen’s attention to this point. He would have to think of a way to increase Lei Linger’s power in the future.

All of a sudden, Long Chen’s divine ring spun frantically, and a terrifying power burst out of it.

BOOM!

Just as that power was erupting, the violet divine ring exploded, returning the seven-color divine ring to a six-color divine ring.

“It’s still no good. The violet divine ring’s power has surpassed my expectations. The problem is in the foundation balancing the divine ring. If its power is lacking, it’s impossible to concentrate seven kinds of energy.” A solemn expression appeared on Long Chen’s face.

The violet divine ring vanished, leaving behind the original six-color divine ring. With that, the metal, wood, water, fire, earth, and wind energies also vanished. It was like they had never appeared.

“It seems that I need to reach at least the third star transformation before I can truly control the divine ring’s energy. But there’s not quite enough time.”

Long Chen felt a bit rushed because they would reach the Nine Underworld Island soon.

He was already exposed, and it was unknown how many people were hunting him. If he were to stop, he would lose his initiative.

“Fuck, I don’t care! Let’s take the risk!”

Long Chen clenched his teeth. He could not wait that long. Together with Xia Chen and Guo Ran, he flew to the Nine Underworld Island. Two days later, the mountains and plains vanished. The world became covered in mist, and an endless sea appeared in front of them. They were finally seeing the sea of mist.
