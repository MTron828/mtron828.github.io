Chapter 4114 Breakthrough

“Boss is mighty, boss is unrivaled-”

Guo Ran immediately cheered excitedly when he saw Long Chen fly out.

However, he had yet to even finish cheering when a figure shot back and crashed into the ground like a meteorite, leaving a long ditch there.

Uncle Tree extended a hand and caught the Minghong Saber that was flying through the air. Long Chen also came flying back wretchedly at this time.

“Long Chen, are you alright?!” Yu Qingxuan turned pale. Long Chen was covered in blood, with many bloody holes in his body. It was a ghastly sight.

Guo Ran froze in his cheering posture. How did Long Chen end up coming back before even starting?

Just then, Xu Jianxiong shot out and blocked the dark domain lord who had suddenly appeared.

“Master, why did you fight it directly? It is extremely fast and has six arms. You are using your weak point to fight your opponent’s strong point.” Uncle Tree was shocked. Long Chen had almost been killed just now.

It had happened so quickly that he hadn’t even been able to react. If Long Chen hadn’t used his and the dark domain lord’s power to retreat, he’d be dead now. Thinking of this, Uncle Tree was covered in sweat.

Long Chen flapped his hand, indicating that he couldn’t even speak. He then formed hand seals, circulating the life energy of the primal chaos space.

It took several breaths’ time before Long Chen managed to take a deep breath and helplessly say, “I know, but I had no choice.”

Originally, Long Chen had been planning on using the dragon race’s divine abilities to fight with the dark domain lord. However, the dragon expert stopped him, telling him to fight it directly in close-range combat.

When Long Chen heard that, he was stunned. If it weren’t for his absolute trust in the dragon expert, he would suspect that it was trying to get him killed.

That dark domain lord was incredibly fast, and it was the ruler of this domain, possessing the power to control the laws here. Thus, its speed could not even be described with the word ‘fast’ anymore, as it had broken spatial limits. There was no guarding against it.

Furthermore, with Long Chen’s two hands, how was he supposed to stop its six claws? But since the dragon expert had said it, he had no choice but to do it.

As a result, despite using all his power, even thirty-six slashes of his saber were unable to do anything to his opponent. Seizing an opening, he exploited it to flee, narrowly avoiding death by a hair's breadth. The fact that he survived was entirely thanks to his instincts.

For others, those thirty-six slashes of his saber happened in the blink of an eye, basically imperceptible. Thus, other than Uncle Xiong and Uncle Tree, no one else knew what had happened.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, black qi oozed out of the bloody holes in Long Chen’s body, presenting a gruesome sight. That was the power of the laws here. It took Long Chen almost an hour to erase the black qi, and only then did his wounds heal.

Xu Jianxiong also returned at this time, covered in wounds. His fresh blood dyed his white robes red, but his aura was still strong. As for that dark domain lord, it was once more forced back. Even without the ancestral spirit totem, Xu Jianxiong was a level stronger than a dark domain lord.

“Long Chen, that was too dangerous. The slightest mistake would have cost you your life, and we would have no chance to save you,” said Xu Jianxiong sternly when he returned.

At first, much like Uncle Tree, he had assumed that Long Chen would be unleashing his ultimate techniques to fight it. After all, resisting the dark domain lord’s pressure could temper one’s will. But who would have thought that Long Chen would actually run over and fight it at close range?

Even an expert on his level was not confident in being able to save Long Chen under the dark domain lord’s tempest of attacks. That had truly been too dangerous.

“It’s fine. As long as you can guarantee that it can’t chase after me, I’ll be able to protect myself,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen knew that the dragon expert wanted to stimulate his dragon energy’s reactions and speed through the threat of death. The objective was for Long Chen to be able to use his dragon energy instinctively.

However, he was currently far away from that level. Actually, this was related to whether or not he could truly control dragon energy. To use the dragon expert’s words, only when you were limitlessly close to death could you comprehend the true essence of cultivation.

Seeing that Long Chen was so sure, Xu Jianxiong let him be. He also recovered and waited for the dark domain lord to return.

The rest of the Fullmoon race experts had all left, overseeing disciples on various battlefields. While casualties were unavoidable, their presence minimized the extent of these losses.

Xu Changchuan now joined the Dragonblood warriors on the battlefield against the dark creatures. In fact, Xu Changchuan was truly strong. The silver spots in his manifestation and the golden light of his horns were also different from the other experts of the Fullmoon race. From these traits, Long Chen knew that he had either mutated or undergone an ancestral regression.

Having been provoked by the Dragonblood warriors’ display, he began to challenge the Heaven Venerate creatures. At first, it was extremely difficult and dangerous. Yet, he still risked his life to kill several of them. As his guts grew and his fear completely vanished, he got stronger and stronger. After some praise from Xu Jianxiong, his confidence multiplied.

This fellow then asked if he could challenge the dark domain lord. But after he was badly cursed, he didn’t dare to say a single word and just focused his anger on those dark creatures.

Time passed bit by bit. To Long Chen’s surprise, the dark domain lord’s recovery speed was quite astonishing. It would come back almost every six to eight hours.

Long Chen would always challenge it first. Although he was crushed every time, he gradually stretched his limit from the blink of an eye to two breaths’ time. While the progress was slow, Long Chen could clearly feel his speed increasing.

Back then, the dragon expert had told him that immense power would affect his speed, because no matter how much power he had, if he couldn’t hit his opponent, it was meaningless.

Unfortunately, as Long Chen wasn’t a member of the dragon race, he needed to use unorthodox methods to improve his speed. He had to make up for his shortcomings in the speed of his attacks and defenses, or he would be at a disadvantage against truly powerful enemies.

“Faster, faster, just a bit faster and you’ll be able to keep up with it!”

As Long Chen fought the dark domain lord, the dragon expert was shouting its encouragement.

What Long Chen didn’t know was that as he used all his power to endure the dark domain lord’s attacks, the dragon blood in his body began to boil. As a result, runes that had never appeared before slowly condensed in his blood.

This change was something that Long Chen himself didn’t notice, but the dragon expert saw it clearly. It knew just how important these runes were to Long Chen.

One day, two days, three days. In one go, a whole month passed. Long Chen’s speed grew until he was able to last half an incense stick’s time against the dark domain lord. His rate of improvement shocked Xu Jianxiong.

BOOM!

Long Chen was in the midst of fighting the dark domain lord when an explosive sound came from within his body. After that, his aura grew torrentially.

“He advanced?!”

Everyone jumped. Long Chen had actually made an advancement in the middle of battle.

Just then, the void quivered, causing Xu Jianxiong and Uncle Tree’s expressions to completely change. They both attacked at once.

BOOM!

It turned out that another dark domain lord had come.

“How can this be?! How can two dark domain lords appear in one world?!” The Fullmoon experts let out startled cries, but they were seeing this impossible reality in front of them.
