Chapter 3940 As Many Experts as Clouds in the Sky

The soldiers drilling on the side of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire were enraged upon seeing their prince being used to pull someone’s chariot. Filled with righteous indignation, they collapsed upon this man.

However, that black-robed man’s whip directly blasted through them like they were just rotting wood, causing the others to be too terrified to move.

The ones to have reached him first were their strongest experts, and amongst them was a Supreme half-step World King, the highest rank commander in the area. However, even this commander was directly slain. How could the normal experts dare to make a move then?

Once the chariot was closer, they saw that other than the seventeenth prince, the other two were actually Divine Venerates with Supreme Qi around them. All three were bound by chains and pulling the chariot forward.

According to reason, three experts on this level would have no trouble pulling a chariot. But their auras were in chaos and they were covered in blood, clearly heavily injured. Then adding on the constant whipping from the black-robed man, they were in a miserable plight.

However, surprisingly, the three of them didn’t look enraged at all. Instead, there was fear in their eyes, as well as a begging expression. They didn’t dare to make any complaints and just pulled the chariot as hard as they could.

“Friend, please stop here. This is the Vermilion Bird Empire’s territory. What is your reason for coming here?” asked the commander on this side with a friendly tone.

Of course he was friendly. The enemy of my enemy was my friend. Seeing this black-robed man treat the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s seventeenth prince like this, they all had a good feeling about him.

“I’ve finally arrived at the Vermilion Bird Empire? Tch, I got lost and ended up in the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire first, hahaha. But I’m glad to have arrived.”

The black-robed man pulled back his hood, revealing a young and handsome face. He was Long Chen.

Long Chen looked at the three people pulling his chariot, and they immediately started quivering in terror. They directly knelt on the ground, prostrating toward him.

The seventeenth prince spoke in a shuddering voice, “You promised that as long as we properly pulled the chariot, you would forgive us for our offense toward Princess Qingxuan. Please respect your promise.”

Long Chen had been following the map, but he ended up misreading the marks on it. Furthermore, due to using the Kunpeng wings, his speed was so fast that he ended up far off the target in just a moment.

It just so happened that Long Chen arrived at a city inside the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire and was preparing to ask for directions in a somewhat bustling place. He didn’t want to just barge into the Vermilion Bird Empire to avoid facing unnecessary trouble.

Thus, he hadn’t expected to run into these three. They were in the midst of talking about the Vermilion Bird Empire. The seventeenth prince was even talking about Yu Qingxuan’s body with a drooling tone, immediately enraging Long Chen.

Without a word, Long Chen beat up the three of them, resulting in the entire city’s experts trying to save them. Only then did Long Chen learn that he had truly found the right people to beat. They were from the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

This seventeenth prince was not particularly beloved by the people, which was why he was sent to such a remote place near the border of the empire.

However, the seventeenth prince did have quite a few guards beside him, including two Supreme Divine Venerates. After beating them up, Long Chen essentially challenged an entire city on his own. Anyone in the city who could be called an expert was subdued by him, and none of them could receive a single blow from him.

When Long Chen started fighting, the seventeenth prince’s mouth remained dirty, so Long Chen furiously demanded the three of them pull the chariot for him, or he would kill them.

When they saw how terrifying Long Chen was, they realized that they had provoked a vicious character. In order to live, they directly agreed and started pulling the chariot for him.

“Tch, when have I, Boss Long San, ever eaten my words? Scram, and remember that disaster comes from the mouth. Keep your mouth clean in the future,” said Long Chen coldly.

Although the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire had enmity with the Vermilion Bird Empire, it had nothing to do with Long Chen. The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s experts also had not especially targeted him in the three thousand worlds. But then, Long Chen didn’t know how many of them were killed by his Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens.

Long Chen was very direct with his grudges and enmities. He didn’t wish to get drawn into the fighting between two empires, not because he was afraid but because he didn’t know the truth about everything. He couldn’t label someone as good or evil just because of his fondness for one person, nor would he directly take someone’s life just because of one disrespectful word.

“Many thanks, many thanks. I will definitely repent for my past mistakes and turn over a new leaf!”

The seventeenth prince repeatedly kowtowed, weeping in gratitude. It was his first time being so close to death, and only now did he realize just how precious life was.

“That is your own matter. If you don’t reform, next time you might not get another chance to. You’d have to reincarnate as a new person.” Long Chen waved his hand dismissively.

The three of them delightedly threw down the chains on them and fled, not even thinking about taking back the Heavenly Ruler Seal War Chariot, a symbol of their Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire. They simply left as fast as they could, never wanting to see this black-robed devil ever again.

At this time, the Vermilion Bird Empire’s soldiers opened the gates. They had all heard Long Chen’s conversation with the seventeenth prince and had seen Long Chen’s shocking methods. From that, they knew that he was a terrifying expert and that they couldn't afford to offend him. Furthermore, he was so protective over the Vermilion Bird Empire.

“I am the Vermilion Bird Empire’s Heaven Border Defense Chief, Xiao Yong. Greetings, young friend.” The half-step World King from the Vermilion Bird Empire cupped his fists to Long Chen.

“You can call me Long San. I am a friend of your noble Princess Qingxuan. I wasn’t familiar with the path, so I ended up in the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s territory. I heard someone blaspheming Princess Qingxuan, so I conveniently corrected them. I’ve made you all laugh at me.” Long Chen also cupped his fists back.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

That refreshing character that wasn’t restrained by complicated etiquette was very refreshing to these soldiers. He even called them brothers, instantly pulling in the distance between them.

“So it’s brother Long. Welcome to the Vermilion Bird Empire. Come inside the city.” Xiao Yong courteously invited Long Chen in. The soldiers behind him hesitated, but then they also pulled in the Heavenly Ruler Seal War Chariot.

Xiao Yong received Long Chen very courteously. However, as the defense chief, he was also very shrewd. During the welcoming feast, he subtly asked about Long Chen’s background. This avoided the awkwardness of an interrogation, while also letting him do what he had to do.

Long Chen didn’t report his true status. He only said that he was a sect’s disciple and had a close relationship with Yu Qingxuan’s sect, the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect. They had met multiple times and were good friends.

In order to gain Xiao Yong’s trust, Long Chen said several names. Those were the Vermillion Bird Empire’s disciples that he had encountered before entering the three thousand worlds. When Long Chen said those names, Xiao Yong’s cautiousness toward Long Chen diminished a great deal.

“That’s right, brother Xiao, Princess Qingxuan said that our Vermilion Bird imperial household has countless geniuses. Here, there are as many experts as there are clouds in the sky. Thus, Princess Qingxuan invited me to come sincerely to witness the royal family’s mighty heroes and geniuses.”

Once Xiao Yong had drunk about enough and was no longer so on guard, Long Chen probed him back a bit.

“Hahaha, brother Long, it’s not that I’m bragging, but the Vermilion Bird royal bloodline is blessed with countless geniuses. You are Princess Qingxuan’s friend, so you know how powerful she is. But do you know what rank that power of hers ranks her amongst the princes and princesses?” Xiao Yong instantly grew excited hearing Long Chen’s question, feeling full of pride.

Long Chen paused. He hadn’t expected this random question to seemingly touch upon some secret.

“No, what rank?”

Xiao Yong looked at Long Chen and spat out two words:

“Rank nine.”
