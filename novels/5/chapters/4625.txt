Chapter 4614: Brahma‚Äôs Wrath, Flame Dragons Burn the Heavens

Following Long Chens furious roar, flames exploded within the barrier as his killing intent burned hotter than any flame.

The force of Long Chens slap was akin to being struck by a hammer, leaving the white-robed man dazed and disoriented for a moment. However, as a peak expert, he swiftly regained his composure.

Seeing Long Chen charging toward him, the white-robed man was enraged. As a figure of high status, no one had ever thought of slapping him in the face. This humiliation instantly drove him crazy.

Die!

The white-robed man swiftly formed hand seals as flames surged around him, condensing into a fiery-red sword in his grasp. With a swift motion, he slashed at Long Chen.

The blade, ablaze with fiery energy, cleaved through the fabric of reality itself, slicing apart the very laws of the world as it advanced toward Long Chen, leaving destruction in its wake.

Unflinching, Long Chen stood his ground. With starlight shimmering atop his arms and his dragon scales protecting them, he raised his arms to intercept the incoming strike.

BOOM!

Long Chens arms shuddered, and bloody scales scattered through the air as he endured the brunt of the attack with his physical body, sustaining injuries in the process.

However, Long Chen didnt care. His scarlet eyes blazed with fury, his teeth clenched in a display of unbridled rage. It was as if his killing intent had stripped away his rationality.

For Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan was his reverse scale, a sacred treasure no one could touch. Hence, the white-robed mans act had pushed Long Chen over the edge.

Startled, the white-robed man hadnt expected Long Chen to block his attack with just his arms. Just then, Long Chens hand snapped onto his sword like five hooks. Despite the white-robed mans attempts to retract the weapon, it seemed to have melded with Long Chens hand, and he couldnt pull it back.

With a cold shout, the white-robed man formed seals with his left hand and pressed the left hand onto the back of his right hand, causing flame runes to flow from his palm into the sword.

As the flame runes fused with the sword, it transformed into a dark red hue, starting from the hilt, emanating a majestic divine aura.

Long Chens hand emitted smoke, overwhelmed by the intense heat that even he struggled to endure. The scorching sensation seared his skin, but he refused to release his grip.

The white-robed man anticipated that Long Chen would immediately let go, leaving him vulnerable to a killing blow. However, to his surprise, Long Chen persisted, his palm igniting with countless stars that clashed fiercely with the white-robed mans sword.

On one side of the sword surged flame energy, while astral energy coursed through the other. These two energies merged into the sword at the same time, causing it to rumble. The clash of these two powers inside of it was too much for it to bear.

BOOM!

Without warning, the sword exploded, unable to withstand the intense competition between Long Chen and the white-robed mans powers.

Reacting swiftly, the white-robed man retreated to evade the flying fragments. Long Chen, however, paid them no heed, allowing the shrapnel to strike him. He pressed forward, wielding the broken tip of the sword in his hand as he aimed it directly at the white-robed mans throat.

Once again, the white-robed man was startled by Long Chens ferocity. He didnt even have time to react.

The sharp tip of the sword sliced through the air, grazing the white-robed mans throat and drawing blood. Long Chens attack was quick as lightning. He had willingly endured injury to ensure his strike landed while the white-robed man was distracted by the fragments of the sword.

However, the white-robed man was also a powerful expert, relying on his combat instincts to twist his head in time, and the flame runes around him instantly converged in front of his neck to form a shield.

This shield mitigated some of the swords force, resulting in a clean cut but devoid of any explosive power. At this moment, the white-robed mans expression changed. Had he reacted the slightest bit slower, Long Chen would have severed his entire neck.

Although that wouldnt kill him, Long Chen would definitely exploit that opening, leaving him with no opportunity to recover.

As a peak expert, the white-robed man had defeated plenty of experts in this lifetime. However, none had come as close to nearly killing him in just a few moves as Long Chen.

BOOM!

The flame runes surrounding the white-robed man erupted into a fiery explosion, causing space to contort and twist before he vanished into thin air.

Just as he disappeared, the broken tip of the sword became covered in stars and flew through the air.

Piercing through the void, the tip of the sword found its target and forced the white-robed man to appear. A splatter of blood marked his appearance, along with a bloody hole in his chest.

The white-robed man finally felt fear toward Long Chen, realizing that the person in front of him was not as weak as he had imagined. Now, he knew that Long Chen had the power to kill him.

Desperate to create distance between them, the white-robed man had invoked a secret art to flee. However, despite his efforts, he remained ensnared within Long Chens mental lock, unable to escape the inevitable strike.

Like a life-reaping devil, Long Chen shot after his opponent, not giving the white-robed man any chance to recover. Long Chen wanted to kill him as quickly as possible.

Brahmas Wrath, Flame Dragons Burn the Heavens!

The white-robed man didnt even have time to treat his injuries. With quick hand seals, he summoned flame dragons from every directionan attack that he had used to grievously wound Long Chen, nearly claiming his life.

As the flame dragons materialized, Long Chen suddenly appeared before the white-robed man. With a swift motion, his foot swept out, accompanied by a resounding dragon cry echoing in the air. A dragon tail lashed through the air, its unmatched killing intent causing even the heavens to tremble.

What? Theres no lock?! The white-robed man was horrified to find that the flame dragons he had summoned couldnt lock onto Long Chen.

The last time that he had used this move, Long Chen had been firmly locked down. However, this time, it failed to have any effect whatsoever.

He couldnt believe his eyes or understand what the problem was. Yet, reality offered no opportunity for questioning. Witnessing the dragon tail hurtling toward him, he hastily changed his hand seals.

The flame dragons gave up on attacking Long Chen, instead gathering into a shield in front of the white-robed man.

Ten Thousand Dragon Shield!

The white-robed man roared, using the flame dragon shield to block Long Chens attack. His switch was very fast. Even though he had been forced to switch from offense to defense, his technique was not shoddy in the slightest.

BOOM!

The dragon tail collided with the flame dragon shield, shattering it into pieces with a resounding explosion. The white-robed man grunted in pain as the force of the impact sent him hurtling through the air, crashing into the barrier with a sickening thud. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he struggled to regain his footing.

Die! Long Chens voice thundered with unrestrained fury as he stamped on the void, propelling himself forward with lightning wings ablaze.

You want to kill me? Keep dreaming!

The white-robed mans face twisted with ferocity. With a roar, he conjured a picture scroll before Long Chen.

As Long Chen caught sight of the scroll, his expression shifted, and he swiftly dodged to the side.UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

A beam of divine light burst forth from the scroll, narrowly missing Long Chen as it tore through the void, leaving behind a gaping hole in its wake.
