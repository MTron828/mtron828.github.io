Chapter 4201 In a Rush to Reincarnate?

The staircases had appeared, which signified that the Sage King Convention had finally started. The next moment, countless disciples shouted and charged toward them.

“That idiot! Where is he?! It’s starting!” Bai Shishi looked around anxiously.

“Big Sister, don’t worry, Long Chen must be doing something important for him to not be here yet. In the end, the Sage King Convention depends on power to win. Whether he arrives early or late doesn’t matter, as long as he gets here before it closes,” said Yu Qingxuan.

Just as they were speaking, countless disciples already flooded toward the staircase on their side. It was quite the sight.

Upon closer examination, it seemed that every race only had one staircase. On the side designated for the human race, there were numerous cultivators, and they could only go up through this one staircase.

Fortunately, this staircase was big enough. Even as millions and millions of experts flooded toward it, it didn’t seem too packed.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

These experts climbed up frantically. However, while they started off fast, they quickly slowed down.

It was because ripples began to appear on top of the stairs like water, causing their speed to plummet.

Suddenly, the crowd on the High Firmament Academy’s plaza parted. Looking at the source of the commotion, Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan cried out at the same time.

“Long Chen, what happened to you?!”

Long Chen’s clothes were in tatters, and there was still blood on them. It was as if he had just fought an intense battle.

Bai Shishi’s anger seemed to just vanish as she looked at Long Chen worriedly.

“I’m fine. Sorry for being late,” said Long Chen. He then cupped his fists toward the palace master.

The palace master nodded back, not saying anything. Only then did Long Chen look at the Dragonblood warriors. As they looked at each other, all their eyes reddened.

“Good brothers! Now isn’t the time to reminisce! On the Martial Heaven Continent, we swept through all our enemies, becoming the number one legion of the continent! Today, we stand on the land of the immortal world. We will be facing countless heavenly geniuses and endless monsters, but I believe that our Dragonblood warriors can stand at the peak of this world as well! The position of the immortal world’s number one legion will belong to us!” shouted Long Chen passionately as he looked at his brothers.

“To us!”

The Dragonblood warriors roared and unleashed a heaven-shaking battle intent that moved even the palace master.

Their undefeatable will rose and clashed with the very Heavenly Daos, causing even the Heavenly Daos to shudder. After all, the Dragonblood warriors had been following Long Chen for a long time, and every heavenly tribulation they faced was a fight against the Heavenly Daos. Since they had never yielded to the Heavenly Daos, their will was something ordinary heavenly geniuses couldn’t compare to.

Perhaps their power wasn’t the strongest, but their will was definitely tougher than anyone else.

“Move out! Today is the day of reunion for our Dragonblood Legion. We will show the world the style of the hot-blooded men of the Martial Heaven Continent!” shouted Long Chen.

Long Chen waved his hand, and the Dragonblood warriors immediately followed Long Chen to that wide staircase.

The High Firmament Academy and Battle God Palace’s disciples also charged over. Their group was like a long dragon yet also like a sharp blade, directly pointing at the Sage King martial stage.

“Fuck, what a conner. All these brats have been conned by him. No wonder my daughter would fall for his con as well,” grumbled Bai Zhantang upon seeing the Dragonblood warriors’ passionate gazes.

“That’s not called conning but charisma. That’s the highest realm of a commander. Old Bai, you wouldn’t be so petty as to be jealous of your son-in-law, right?” The vice palace master couldn’t help interjecting.

“Me, jealous of him?! What a joke. With his little bit of power, I don’t even place him in my eyes,” snorted Bai Zhantang.

“Us brothers have been together for many years, but I can’t listen to this in good conscience. Long Chen is definitely the most outstanding youngster I’ve seen in this lifetime. There’s nothing to complain about in terms of his talent, power, or character. Just the fact that he is able to make so many powerful experts loyal to him already shows how outstanding he is. Even if none of that counts, the fact that he has the position of dean at his age… Fuck, I say, old Bai, you made me say those things on purpose! You’re just trying to show off! You don’t really look down at Long Chen at all!” The vice palace master suddenly sensed something off and glared at Bai Zhantang.

“Tch, I don’t know what you’re talking about,” snorted Bai Zhantang scornfully.

However, the other vice palace master still wore an expression of disbelief. Now, he understood that this brother of his was just showing off.

Just as they were talking, Long Chen had led everyone to the stairs, where a group of people had gathered, waiting for him.

These people stood firmly in place, yet upon spotting Long Chen, they all bowed to him in unison.

They were the Starry River Sect’s disciples. A whole eight million disciples had been waiting for him all this time.

When the academy’s experts saw this, they were shocked. A large majority of them actually didn’t know that Long Chen had a connection to the Starry River Sect. Hence, upon seeing eight million disciples of the Starry River Sect bowing to him, their eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

It had to be known that currently, the Starry River Sect had assembled the largest group of disciples in the Immortal King realm from the human race, so no one dared to offend them.

Seeing this scene, Bai Shishi’s mother and Bai Xiaole’s mother smiled proudly. To be acknowledged by so many people, Long Chen could be said to be worthy of Bai Shishi. Bai Shishi’s vision could also be called excellent. As her mother, they were happy and proud of her.

Bai Zhantang still had a disdainful expression on his face, but anyone who wasn’t a fool knew that this expression was faked.

The Starry River Sect’s disciples followed closely behind Long Chen once he passed. They seemed to have reached the point of simply following him blindly, causing countless people to cast sidelong glances at them.

“Hmph, what significance do numbers hold? It’s nothing more than a group of rabble,” sneered someone from the sidelines just as Long Chen and the others set foot onto the staircase.

Long Chen turned to look and his gaze instantly turned cold. The speaker belonged to a group of violet-robed disciples, led by a young man and woman whom Long Chen had encountered. They were the Violet Blood race’s Xu family.

That sneer came from the girl called Xu Xin-er. Upon spotting her, Bai Xiaole was notably incensed, and an icy killing intent gleamed in his eyes. He vividly remembered their prior encounter when she had forcibly taken the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox, nearly causing him to lose his eyes to get it back. This lingering enmity had not faded from his memory.

“Are you in such a rush to reincarnate? If you really can’t wait any longer, I’ll send you on your way right now!” Long Chen also remembered this enmity.

If it weren’t due to them both being from the Violet Blood race, he’d have long since killed her. Hence, for her to actually provoke him again, his fury instantly rose.
