Chapter 3781: Terrifying Nine Star Heirs

One figure after another appeared. Their faces could not be seen, and their clothes were long gone. They were completely covered in lightning. Right now, overflowing battle intent raged out of them, causing the ten thousand Daos to cry out.

“One, two, three… the legends are true! There really were three thousand nine star heirs?” Countless people outside the heavenly tribulation were stunned.

“Three thousand against one billion. Just how powerful are these three thousand? This heavenly tribulation is a sure-death tribulation.” A Supreme expert cried out in terror. They had yet to even fight, but his confidence was already crushed by the undefeatable wills of the nine star heirs.

The nine star heirs were said to be the strongest warriors of the nine heavens and ten lands. No one had seen the battle back then, but in a battle of people in the same realm, three thousand had dragged down one billion with them. That showed just how terrifying the nine star heirs were. Their terror exceeded people’s understanding.

Although the Supreme experts had managed to kill the immemorial demonic beasts, they all knew that it was only because their flesh and blood were gone. Their runes had also withered, and they couldn’t even unleash their most basic divine abilities. Their power was not even a single percentage point of their peak.

If these immemorial demonic beasts in their peak were to descend, a single one of them could practically kill all of the Supreme experts. However, a billion of such terrifying existences had been killed by just three thousand nine star heirs! When everyone saw these lightning figures, they instantly despaired.

They then looked at the lightning pillars in the surroundings. This was a prison now, and the cage was their fighting arena. The heavenly tribulation had trapped them to their deaths, refusing to let them pass.

Suddenly, the world quivered. Runes lit up on the foreheads of these nine star heirs. When those runes appeared, their bodies quivered and killing intent exploded out of them.

“KILL!”

One of the nine star heirs roared and directly attacked one of the demonic beast experts.

BOOM!

That demonic beast was long since prepared and took out a shield. When they clashed, both sides swayed and were forced back a few steps.

“Nine star heirs are only this level? It’s just bragging when people say that they’re the strongest warriors. Die!”

That Supreme expert had been worried, but seeing that he managed to fight evenly against this nine star heir, his confidence soared. His Blood Qi erupted, and together with his shield, he smashed into the nine star heir like a shooting star.

“There’s no need to be afraid! These nine star heirs have already lost their physical bodies. Only their wills have been replicated by the Heavenly Daos, and their bodies are made entirely of lightning. That’s the purest lightning essence! Kill them!” shouted someone in the crowd.

This person was precisely Weng Tianhao, but he disguised himself as an expert of the demonic beast race.

With this, people quickly understood why they couldn’t see the faces of the nine star heirs. Just as Weng Tianhao said, the nine star heirs had lost their physical bodies. Not even their bones remained. The Heavenly Daos had replicated them, but their physical bodies were still lost. Thus, they weren’t as powerful as everyone had expected.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

However, the nine star heir that had been knocked back roared; his voice shook people’s souls. Seven stars then appeared behind him, forming a ring. When those stars appeared, a vast aura erupted, shattering this space. The nine star heir let out a simple punch.

BOOM!

The demonic beast charging at him was blown apart along with his shield. That shield had an immense origin, and those immemorial demonic beasts before were unable to even shake it. But now, it was blown apart by this single punch.

This group of experts was originally charging forward, wanting to kill the nine star heirs just like they had killed the immemorial demonic beasts and absorbed their energy. But seeing this scene, they were dumbfounded.

“KILL!”

One nine star heir after another roared and charged in. However, of these three thousand nine star heirs, only a few hundred moved. The rest were quivering, seemingly struggling.

“Quick, while they haven’t fully awake! Kill them now, or everyone will die!” shouted Weng Tianhao. He charged out, attacking a nine star heir.

BOOM!

That nine star heir let out a punch, but Weng Tianhao’s sword suddenly turned. Using some unknown movement art, he avoided his punch, while his lightning sword slashed the nine star heir in the back of his head.

A piece of the nine star heir’s head was severed. However, he didn’t die and punched behind him.

As a result, Weng Tianhao was sent flying like a shooting star. He smashed into one of the lightning pillars, causing a huge explosion. However, he wasn’t injured. His body suddenly rushed toward a crack between two lightning pillars. Just like that, he would escape this fighting arena.

However, just as he tried, a terrifying power sent him flying back even faster than when he was struck by the nine star heir. This action proved that there was no escape without annihilating all the nine star heirs.

Just as Long Chen was shocked, one of the nine star heirs activated the Seven Star Battle Armor and attacked him. Not daring to tarry, Long Chen summoned his divine ring and battle armor as well. He swung the Minghong Saber with all his power.

With a heaven-shaking explosion, Long Chen was shaken almost to the point of coughing up blood. He couldn’t help being shocked. It had to be known that the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art focused on the power of the physical body. As the nine star heirs had lost their physical bodies, the Heavenly Daos only replicated their husks with thunderforce, merging it into their remnant fighting spirit. But they still possessed such terrifying power.

Long Chen repeatedly blocked his attacks, which numbed his arm. Long Chen couldn’t imagine just how powerful they were when they were alive.

“I’ll have to offend you!”

After repeatedly blocking, Long Chen thrust the Minghong Saber into the nine star heir’s heart. Lightning runes then sparkled and Lei Linger immediately devoured those runes.

However, the moment Lei Linger devoured those lightning runes, Long Chen felt immense pain throughout his body. It was as if his body was being stabbed by needles, and his insides felt like they were being flipped. His expression completely changed. He didn’t know what it was, but he actually felt bad after she absorbed those lightning runes.

“Big brother Long Chen, what is it?” Lei Linger was startled.

“Lei Linger, place the energy you just absorbed into a split body! Quick!” ordered Long Chen hastily.

Lei Linger immediately split off the energy she had just absorbed, separating it from her main body. That bad feeling instantly vanished.

Just then, Kun Tu also made his move. However, he was attacked by three nine star heirs. One of them landed a punch on his back, causing him to cough up blood. He no longer had his old ease.

It was the same for the Underworld Eye Giant, Weng Tianhao, the beast cultivator, and the others. They repeatedly coughed up blood and retreated. The weaker experts had it even worse.

At this moment, one of the nine star heirs that had not moved from the start suddenly moved. However, he didn’t attack anyone. Instead, he raised his head up to the sky.

“Do you think you can use the great nine star line?! Break!”

That nine star heir roared and seven stars revolved behind him. When he spread his arms, a seven-star diagram appeared on both of his palms. The void then began to rumble and explode.

A pair of giant hands shockingly manifested in the sky. After that, a giant tear appeared as if the nine heavens were being torn apart.
