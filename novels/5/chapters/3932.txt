Chapter 3921 Double Kill

From the withered palm, a razor-sharp black sword materialized and shot forth with incredible speed. That sword was a condensation of all the life force of this corpse.

This attack had sucked away practically all of this corpse’s energy, making it Shi Yang’s greatest attack yet.

“An insignificant technique,” Long Chen sneered disdainfully. After that, a dragon mark lit up on his palm, and sacred light flowed out like a wave from it.

That sharp sword made a strange sound when it struck Long Chen’s palm, and it suddenly veered toward Yin Changsheng.

BOOM!

Yin Changsheng had never expected Shi Yang’s attack to not be a true physical attack and could actually be reflected. With no opportunity to evade, the black sword mercilessly impaled his chest.

To his horror, the black sword didn't merely puncture his physical form but also tore through his manifestation, leaving a gaping hole. From within him, a sinister aura of decay and death, akin to a curse, surged forth as black qi. Yin Changsheng's anguished scream then pierced the air, echoing with the weight of his suffering.

His body was rapidly rotting and his manifestation was crumbling. That ear-piercing scream persisted for a mere breath before coming to an end. Now, his flesh and blood were gone, leaving only bare bones that were marred with black spots and continued to rot.

“What a terrifying curse. Fortunately, my sacred energy counters it.” Looking at Yin Changsheng’s condition, Long Chen gasped.

He possessed the ancestral dragon’s sacred energy and that was why he wasn’t afraid of this kind of dark curse. Just now, Long Chen had simply deflected it to Yin Changsheng, thinking that it would cause some trouble for him. But unexpectedly, the curse had such a terrifying effect.

Suddenly, Yin Changsheng’s Yuan Spirit burst out of his skeleton. But even then, black spots kept appearing on his Yuan Spirit. Not even his Yuan Spirit could escape this curse.

The spots rapidly spread and multiplied. Even after igniting his core flame, Yin Changsheng was still unable to drive them away. He screamed in agony.

“You bastard Shi Yang, undo this curse!”

BOOM!

Unfortunately, Shi Yang didn’t even get a chance to reply before being blasted apart by Long Chen’s punch. The black sword was supposed to be the deciding blow, so Shi Yang had staked everything on it. As a result, his body was in an incredibly weak state after unleashing it, leaving him so weak that one punch from Long Chen blew his body apart.

Shi Yang’s Yuan Spirit then came out as he tried to flee. As long as his Yuan Spirit was not destroyed, he could find a new corpse to be reborn in and rise again.

However, his Yuan Spirit had just appeared when the long-waiting malevolent spirits inhaled. Li Qi and Song Mingyuan had long since known that once these people died, their Yuan Spirits would be nutrients for them. Hence, they had been waiting at the side.

Shi Yang’s Yuan Spirit was devoured. But when it came to Yin Changsheng’s cursed Yuan Spirit, those two malevolent spirits were also afraid of him. They didn’t dare to devour him as that curse was truly terrifying.

“Long Chen, I won’t let you off even as a ghost!”

BOOM!

Yin Changsheng was unable to endure the pain. With no hope of being saved, he self-detonated.

“Idiot, the one to kill you was Shi Yang. What does it have to do with me? Fortunately, my guts aren’t small. Who are you trying to scare?” snorted Long Chen.

No one had expected Yin Changsheng to be slain by Shi Yang, and for Shi Yang to stake everything on one failed gambit, that cost him his life as well.

Now all that remained on Long Chen’s battlefield were three people, Long Aotian, Kun Tu, and the Nine Underworld Luocha. With the deaths of those two, the world seemed much more tranquil.

Long Aotian, Kun Tu, and the Nine Underworld Luocha stood around Long Chen, not immediately attacking him. They just looked at him coldly.

“If the three of you run in different directions, I admit that with my current power, I can probably only kill one of you. Why don’t you run and see who I prioritize first?” asked Long Chen lightly, clasping his hands behind him.

Guo Ran and the others were recovering as they watched. Seeing him dispatch two peak experts so easily, they cheered.

“Any guesses on who boss will kill if they run?” asked Guo Ran.

“What’s the point? None of the three will escape.” Mo Nian shook his head.

“Really? That Nine Underworld Luocha, she is clearly starting to gasp for breath. Amongst the three of them, she is the weakest. I feel like she’ll be the first to run,” said Bai Xiaole.

Bai Xiaole had recovered a bit of his Spiritual Strength thanks to Meng Qi’s aid. Although he was still looking pale, he was alright.

Meng Qi was now holding Bai Shishi’s hand. Bai Shishi had unleashed all her power, and her Spiritual Strength was slightly overdrafted. However, with her stubborn nature, she refused to let others see that.

When Meng Qi first grabbed her hand, she trembled a bit. But seeing Meng Qi’s warm smile, Bai Shishi reddened slightly and accepted Meng Qi’s aid.

As Meng Qi helped Bai Shishi recover, the Pill Fairy also gave her a medicinal pill. Bai Shishi then thanked her and consumed the pill. She felt immersed in sunlight when she consumed this pill, and her recovery speed soared.

“Sorry.”

Bai Shishi looked at the Pill Fairy and blushed.

The Pill Fairy was startled. She then looked at Bai Shishi blankly, not knowing why she was apologizing to her.

On the other hand, Meng Qi smiled. “We are originally one complete apple. After splitting a part with others, we’ll feel bad about missing a piece. But when others give us a portion as well, you will find that the apple is no longer the original apple, but its flavor is even sweeter. The path of cultivation is filled with dangers. Even peak experts can’t guarantee that they won’t fall, so all we can do is walk together and treasure our time together. Wouldn’t it be good for sisters to walk this path hand in hand?”

Meng Qi looked at Bai Shishi, her beautiful eyes filled with sincerity. Being stared at like this, Bai Shishi grew even redder. Meng Qi was just like a wise and kind big sister, and nothing could escape her observation. Moreover, being seen through by her didn’t make people feel panicked; it actually made them feel steadier.

Bai Shishi didn’t dare to look straight into Meng Qi’s eyes and simply nodded. Even then, this nod already made things clear. It was equivalent to abandoning the turmoil in her heart and putting down her prideful face.

The current Bai Shishi knew why someone as outstanding as her mother would be willing to share a husband with someone else. Love was sometimes so unreasonable. No matter how stubborn you were, you could not resist it. You could only accept your fate.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Sister, tell me, does that fellow have others as well?” whispered Meng Qi.

“Others?” Bai Shishi was startled.

Meng Qi smiled. That response already told her the answer. She then looked at that domineering figure in the distance, feeling relieved. At least, he knew to hold back, or their family would truly be chaotic.

Meanwhile, Guo Ran and the others were betting. Mo Nian said that not one of the three would escape, while Guo Ran and the others were of the opinion that the Nine Underworld Luocha was running out of power and would definitely run.

Just as they were arguing intensely, neither side willing to submit to the other, Kun Tu actually shouted at the Nine Underworld Luocha, “Scram! Stop wasting our time here. I’m about to go all-out, so don’t get slaughtered by me accidentally!”

Kun Tu slowly reached out and pressed his forehead. After that, he actually tore off the golden rune on his forehead.

BOOM!

At this moment, Kun Tu’s Blood Qi surged out violently, unleashing wild astral winds that ravaged the world. This sudden change made Guo Ran and the others’ expressions contort with a mix of astonishment and concern.
