Chapter 3382 Twelfth Heavenstage of Four Peak

Long Chen’s jagged saber danced in the air. After that, qi waves soared and rumbled. Like the wings of a bee, countless saber-images appeared in the air one after another, blocking the attacks of two people.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were like butterflies flitting between flowers. Their movements were completely ephemeral and impossible to grasp. Also, their bone swords came from all directions. Every attack was sharp and accurate, as well as perfectly timed. Previously, Long Chen had to be stabbed at least once for every ten attacks.

Now, he had been fighting them for an hour without bleeding. He was growing stronger and stronger, attacking more and defending less. He was finally starting to become capable of blocking their attacks.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

BOOM!

Long Chen’s jagged sword suddenly exploded. As for Leng Yueyan’s sword, it pointed right at Long Chen’s chest but didn’t stab through. Long Chen hastily raised his hands in surrender.

Ming Cangyue apologetically said, “It was my fault. I didn’t contain my power. With your current realm, I really don’t know what kind of power to use against you.”

The difference between this battle and the one from last month was incredible. It had only been a month, but all this time, Long Chen kept battling. Even Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were tired of it.

Within this month, Long Chen had advanced twice. Maybe falling into the black sea had stimulated his strong instinct to survive, to the point that the Peakless Pills were being absorbed ten times faster than before.

Now, Long Chen had reached the middle of the twelfth Heavenstage. He was hoping to borrow their power to reach the full circle.

However, he found that in the last few days, no matter how he trained, his cultivation base stagnated.

Despite that, his gains during the past few days were still great. After his power soared, he was able to resist their divine pressure. There was no longer an absolute suppression that left him unable to unleash his full power.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s attacks were almost flawless. There was no way to dodge them. Only when his power was greater than theirs would he have a possibility of striking them. At the same power level, defeat was only a question of time.

Although their techniques also had holes, those holes were made up for by the other. Even if you could spot an opening, you wouldn’t be able to grasp it. Furthermore, if you tried and failed, that would just put you straight into a trap. This was the experience that Long Chen had gained after being stabbed thousands of times.

When he reached the twelfth Heavenstage, his power changed. The two of them were no longer able to fight him with power in the same realm. They had to use the power of the Nether King realm.

However, if they used the power of the Nether King realm, they would automatically use the power of laws. Having gained control over so many new territories, they were in control of more laws. However, they were not used to this new power yet, so with one slip of control, they ended up using the power of those laws.

As for Long Chen’s saber, the mysterious sword tip had stabbed a hole into it before, so when her bone sword struck the saber where it was weakest, it naturally broke.

Long Chen smiled. “It’s fine. Having you two beautiful goddesses accompany me in training has allowed me to advance rapidly. I really have to thank you two.” Long Chen made a grand show of a deep bow, drawing out their laughter. It could be said that these days were the happiest ones of their lives.

Long Chen’s improvement was truly astonishing. Furthermore, he didn’t seem affected by the Netherworld’s laws. Back when they were in the same realm, their power was far lower than Long Chen’s.

After fighting for several more days, Long Chen’s cultivation base still didn’t rise. Even the Peakless Pills lost any effect. Long Chen’s consciousness told him that the rest of the way could not be walked through ordinary means.

Most likely, he would need to return to the immortal world to advance. However, exactly how he would advance was still unclear to him.

“Reporting to the divine master, the master city has sent word of a disturbance deep in the wilderness. The void is being torn apart. It seems that some powerful experts are fighting.” One of their subordinates came over with a report.

The master city was the one that Tuo Ming had set his sights on originally, the one in the wilderness that Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue had found through risking their lives. It was the start of their rise and had significant meaning. Thus, they decided that it would be called the master city.

The surroundings of the master city were still unexplored wilderness, and they hadn’t been cleared yet. If it hadn’t been for the attention of the other six powers, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue would have started marching into the wilderness.

Upon hearing that there was such an intense fight, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s hearts sank slightly. If there really were such terrifying existences deep within the wilderness, that was bad news for them.

If those existences attacked the city, they might lose it. Who knew? If they were so powerful, they might even expand into the surroundings and devour the rest of their new territories.

“Let’s take a look.”

Long Chen, Ming Cangyue, and Leng Yueyan brought thirty Earth tier Nether Kings with them to the master city. They stealthily moved deep into the wilderness.

Their mission was just to observe the situation, so they didn’t bring too many people. If the other side was truly so powerful, they needed to have the courage to cut off a part of their bodies.

If two sides were fighting, then they would see if they could profit from it. However, on the way, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s expressions improved slightly.

“It’s not the aura of the Nethergod race but Nether Beasts. Most likely, it’s a battle between the Nether Beast tribes,” said Ming Cangyue.

Seeing that Long Chen didn’t understand, she further explained that while the Nethergod race did control the Netherworld due to their bloodline, as they had the power to control the laws of the Netherworld, they were not necessarily the strongest race in the Netherworld.

The world that Ming Cangyue controlled, where lifeforms underwent Netherpassage, was not exactly part of the Netherworld. It was just overseen by the Netherworld, and she had to guard the regular operation of that world. Through gaining control over such a world, she could condense the divine core, gaining control of the laws of that world. The Nethergod race relied on the support of the Netherworld’s laws to cultivate.

Right now, Long Chen had only been in the Netherworld for two months, and under their training, he had made consecutive advancements. It seemed to be the fastest advancement of his life.

As for Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan, they had gone from having just advanced to the Nether King realm to reaching the sixth Heavenstage if using the immortal world’s standards. If it weren’t for them spending the majority of their time and effort on helping Long Chen and stabilizing their new cities, they would have long since reached the late stage.

In the Netherworld, the Nethergod race’s realms did not grow unsteady from advancing too quickly. As long as they controlled more laws, they could directly advance all the way to a World Master.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue had no parents. They were born from the Netherworld, so they innately knew how to control the power of laws. They were the rulers of the Netherworld.

However, between fellow Nethergods, there were no instinctive friendly emotions. If they wanted to get stronger, they had to take territory from others. Back then, Ming Cangyue had found herself unable to be so ruthless and had split her goodness from her body, resulting in the two of them.

Other than the Nethergod race, the largest race in the Netherworld would be the Nether Beast race. In the immortal world, there were many kinds of beasts: devil beasts, spirit beasts, auspicious beasts, divine beasts, immortal beasts…

But in the Netherworld, there was only one kind, the Nether Beasts. All their cultivation styles were the same. They devoured Nether Qi to strengthen themselves.

Some members of the Nethergod race would even form good relationships with the Nether Beast race. It was because Nethergods wanted laws and Nether Qi wasn’t very useful to them. There was no contradiction.

Thus, after sensing the auras of Nether Beasts, the two relaxed a great deal. Suddenly, as they were still stealthily creeping over, the sky darkened. A huge figure then smashed toward them.
