Chapter 4853 Ten Thousand Blood Flag

“That’s...!”

“Heavens, he’s taken out the Iron Blood Gate’s priceless treasure!”

When the onlookers caught sight of the weapon in Cao Shaoqing’s hand, startled cries filled the air as they recognized this divine weapon.

It was a battle flag, with a three-meter pole ending in a sharp spearhead, bearing ten thousand runes. Every single rune appeared as if drawn with concentrated fresh blood. As soon as the flag appeared, a frightening air unfurled from it, causing people's souls to tremble. Some people even started to experience auditory illusions, as if they were hearing the howls of countless ghouls.

“Is that the Iron Blood Gate’s Ten Thousand Blood Flag?!”

“It is said to be made using the essence blood of ten thousand supreme races. Every single rune on it represents a powerful bloodline.”

“I heard that it was once owned by the Iron Blood Gate’s first gate master. It’s a priceless treasure obtained from the heavenly burial battlefield.”

“The Ten Thousand Blood Flag and Blood Transformation Divine Stele are the Iron Blood Gate’s foundational treasures. Their first gate master relied on these two items to create the Iron Blood Gate.”

“That’s crazy. The gate master didn’t just give his own Blood Soul Battle Armor to Cao Shaoqing; he even took out their foundational divine weapon. That’s... that’s simply bullying!”

The spectator stands erupted with cries of shock. The Iron Blood Gate’s master was completely despicable this time, making this fight completely unfair.

“Big Brother Long Chen...”

Yu Fei and Yu Tong were worried when they heard this discussion.

“How shameless.” Yu Luo’s face turned cold when she saw the Iron Blood Gate’s divine weapon. Cao Guofeng was truly despicable.

“It doesn’t matter how shameless they are. It won’t change the result,” remarked Mo Nian casually.

“It’s the Iron Blood Gate’s legacy treasure. Can Big Brother Long Chen really deal with that Ten Thousand Blood Flag?” asked Yu Tong.

“It’ll be fine. I gave him something that can definitely deal with the Ten Thousand Blood Flag,” replied Mo Nian confidently.

“You gave Big Brother Long Chen a treasure?”

“Something that can block the Ten Thousand Blood Flag?”

Yu Tong and Yu Fei’s eyes widened. Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu couldn’t believe it, and even Race Leader Yu Luo was startled.

Enjoying the feeling of being stared at, Mo Nian calmly said, “Don’t worry, you’ll see it in a bit.”

Mo Nian had given Long Chen the astral bone claw. Although it might not be able to beat the Ten Thousand Blood Flag, it could definitely compete with it.

“Long Chen, tell me, how do you want to die?”

With the Ten Thousand Blood Flag in hand, Cao Shaoqing’s voice grew dark and sinister, and strange lines appeared in his eyes. He seemed to have turned into a different person.

“This flag of yours doesn’t look bad,” remarked Long Chen, slightly surprised by the Ten Thousand Blood Flag. He hadn’t expected Cao Shaoqing to have such a treasure.

Cao Shaoqing sinisterly said, “This is my Iron Blood Gate’s foundational treasure, the Ten Thousand Blood Flag. It contains ten thousand runes composed of the strongest essence blood since the immemorial era—devil blood, beast blood, Nether blood, Spirit blood, and of course your human race’s blood. Every expert slain by it will have their essence blood absorbed. If that blood is strong enough, one of the runes on the Ten Thousand Blood Flag will fall and be replaced by a new rune. Aren’t you very strong? I want to see if you’re qualified to leave your own mark on the Ten Thousand Blood Flag.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Cao Shaoqing seemed as if he had been possessed by a devil; even his spiritual fluctuations were no longer the same.

“Ten Thousand Blood Flag? It sounds pretty badass. Alright, I admit I might have misspoken,” said Long Chen, suddenly sounding much nicer.

His reaction caused countless experts to sigh. They thought Long Chen was afraid and started to beg for mercy.

Cao Shaoqing raised his head and laughed. “Hahaha, I thought you were tough? What happened to your arrogance? Are you done with that now?”

Waving his hand dismissively, Long Chen replied, “In truth, it was all a misunderstanding. As a person, I don’t like to work for nothing. I was angry because you scammed me with your so-called Immemorial Blood Crocodile. After all, as the branch dean of the High Firmament Academy, how can I just fight anyone for nothing? No matter what, I have to get something out of it. You agree, don’t you? Everyone’s time is precious, so you can understand why I was angry, right? But if you’re going to bring out the Ten Thousand Blood Flag for me, I take it back. You are not completely useless. In order to save time, why don’t you just give me the Ten Thousand Blood Flag and kill yourself? What do you think?”

Hearing Long Chen’s statement, both Cao Shaoqing and the spectators were left in disbelief, their jaws dropping in astonishment. They even started to doubt their own ears.

The combination of domineering words delivered in such an amicable tone left them with an odd feeling, as if the entire scene had become twisted.

Cao Shaoqing stared at Long Chen blankly for several breaths, seemingly processing what had been said. Then, he exploded with rage once more.

“Die!”

The Ten Thousand Blood Flag thrust toward Long Chen like a spear. Its runes lit up as it seemed to come to life, and a ferocious aura erupted from it.

The ten thousand essence blood within the flag still retained the resentment of their fallen owners. Hence, once the flag was activated, all the resentment unleashed a terrifying pressure. These resentful spirits would not stop until they tore their target apart.

“Hehehe, it’s over!” Cao Guofeng smiled coldly. His only concern had been whether or not Cao Shaoqing could activate the Ten Thousand Blood Flag's killing intent. However, to his surprise, the flag activated on its own upon encountering Long Chen. It seemed that Long Chen's essence blood had triggered its instinct to devour.

As the Ten Thousand Blood Flag flew toward Long Chen, Long Chen simply stood straight, his hands clasped behind his back.

“What?!”

Just before impact, Long Chen launched his fist at it, stunning everyone.
