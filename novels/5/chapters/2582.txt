Chapter 2571 Sovereign Seal Vanishes

Countless experts had gathered in front of Devil Spirit Mountain. Qu Jianying and the old man were amongst their ranks.

When Long Chen and Daoist Heavenly Feather arrived, Qu Jianying and the old man hastily came to greet them.

“Did no one from the divine families come?” asked Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“No. Furthermore…” Qu Jianying shook her head. “Furthermore, the original experts of the divine families that were guarding Devil Spirit Mountain have left. It’s the same at the Yin Yang World.”

Long Chen sneered, “The divine families are ceasing to cooperate with us? Are they trying to scare us?”

The divine families were originally guarding this place, but they had withdrawn without saying anything. Right now, the Sovereign seal floating between the two giant stone pillars was starting to crack. It seemed that it would collapse in just a short time.

“The Sovereign seal shouldn’t have broken so quickly. Could it be…” Someone cautiously started a train of thought, only to shut his mouth quickly.

Many people’s expressions grew ugly. It couldn’t be that the divine families had intentionally damaged the Sovereign seal to make it break earlier, right?

“Haha, fools, without the support of the divine families, how will the Martial Heaven Continent fight against the invaders? Look at what you’ve done. Because of Long Chen, the continent is in incalculable danger. If we all die, it’s Long Chen’s fault.” Suddenly, maniacal laughter came from the crowd.

The speaker was wearing robes of the ancient family alliance. He was a tottering senior whose cultivation base was only at the Life Star realm.

“The divine families are trying to create fear and then put pressure on me and the Martial Heaven Alliance. They have fractured the powers of the Martial Heaven Continent, not allowing us to unite. Hehe, I really didn’t misjudge the divine families,” snorted Long Chen.

Seeing everyone looking at him, the elder was even more pleased. He loudly said, “Long Chen, you are a petty little man who doesn’t care about the big picture or the continent. In your stubbornness, you offended the divine families, Pill Valley, the Corrupt path, and the sea demon race. Do you think that you alone will be able to save the continent from its crisis? Who do you think you are? A Sovereign? Even the Sovereigns needed to unite the continent’s powers to fight off the invaders. As for you, all you know how to do is kill the pillars of the Martial Heaven Continent. If you have the ability, why didn’t you kill the experts of the invading worlds? Instead, you act like a big-shot on the continent. You have inescapable blame if anyone from the continent dies to these invaders.”

The elder didn’t seem afraid of Long Chen killing him at all. His spittle flew out as he cursed Long Chen. Hearing this, countless people grew ashen with rage, and hands landed on their weapons.

This person already had a foot in the grave, and his longevity had reached its end. Since he didn’t have many more days of life regardless, they truly disdained killing such a weakling.

Long Chen was surprisingly calm as he looked at the elder. He knew that killing him was meaningless. There were thousands, tens of thousands, or perhaps even more of him.

Those people didn’t have any ability in their lifetime, but they could fan some flames, duping people who didn’t have information. They were capable of immense harm.

“Long Chen, don’t you want to kill me? Come and kill me. I’ve lived my life, but I simply cannot bear to suffer in silence as you act so recklessly and throw the continent in danger.” The elder continued to fan the flames of rage.

He knew that everyone who had come here was someone with status and prestige. They disdained killing him. Killing him would lose them face.

However, one person had finally lost patience. He was about to attack when he was stopped by Long Chen.

“Thank you, senior. I can deal with it myself.” Long Chen shook his head. This elder was unafraid of death, so whoever killed him would have to bear a stain. The one about to attack had simply lost his patience and no longer cared, but Long Chen didn’t want others to suffer for this.

“Hahaha, do you see, the mighty Long Chen, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s strongest expert, is actually going to kill an old man on the verge of dying. Come, my name will definitely go down in history.” The elder grew even more pleased.

An arrow shot over at the elder, aiming to kill him before Long Chen could, but Long Chen flicked it away with a finger.

“No need.” Long Chen nodded his thanks to that person but did not accept their favor.

Long Chen walked right in front of the elder and extended a hand. Everyone shook their heads. This elder was absolutely vile. Even in death, he had to be so vile.

“Come, kill me. If I frown in the slightest, then I’m not a man,” sneered the elder.

Long Chen shook his head and patted his shoulder. He straightened his collar. “No matter how you put it, you are my senior. In the cultivation world, everyone is like a blade of grass that can be blown away at any moment, but every individual still views themselves as the true main character. You also had your own glory and things to be proud of. Even in death, you should keep note of your appearance. We cannot choose when we die, but when it comes, we can at least have a bit of dignity.”

The elder and everyone else was startled to hear such words coming from Long Chen’s mouth. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“You…”

Long Chen continued, “You are on the verge of death. You don’t feel any fear. But let me ask you, are you really unafraid of death? Do you really have nothing holding you back?

“I…”

“If you really are fearless, then you wouldn’t have come here. If your heart was unfettered, you wouldn’t allow yourself to be used by others. Perhaps you no longer have your father and mother, but you must have descendants. Do you know what kind of conclusion you are giving to those descendants?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“You… you’re threatening me?” demanded the elder.

“No, no. I don’t threaten people. I disdain doing so. I’m simply telling you that your actions are tossing them into a bottomless abyss. The entire world is clear on what kind of person I am. I don’t need to prove anything. But do you know? Those people whose wills aren’t as strong, including your sons and daughters, will continue to spread your rumors after you die and bring chaos to the continent. If they have decent power, perhaps they will have some value to the divine families and will be helped out a little. But if they don’t have any power, do you think that we will care about them after they do such things? Do you think the divine families will think these people have any value after they’re done using them? When the tribulation descends, the divine families won’t protect them, and neither will we. We won’t have any responsibility to look after them. As for the divine families, do you think they will sacrifice their precious forces to protect them if they have no value? For you, dying is as quick as closing your eyes. But your actions are also cutting off the only chance your descendants have of surviving. Of course, you may have thought this all through. Perhaps you feel that this world is too bitter and so you simply want to lead them into Elysium with you?”

Long Chen shrugged helplessly at the elder. He had no anger in his eyes or voice, only pity.

The elder’s expression changed multiple times as Long Chen spoke. Fear gradually crept into him.

Long Chen was telling the truth. Hence, the other experts nodded. At such a critical time, the people causing trouble on the continent would be mercilessly cut off and abandoned by others.

“I… I…” The elder trembled, lost.

“You still have two or three months of life left. Rather than wasting it here, why don’t you consider it? Consider how a person should walk their final steps. Living in this world isn’t easy. Even if your name can’t go down in history, you shouldn’t implicate your descendants,” implored Long Chen.

“Many thanks. I was muddled in my old age. Thank you for your reminder.” The elder actually knelt down and kowtowed to Long Chen, only to be lifted back up by him.

After that, the elder left with an ashamed expression. The other experts then looked at Long Chen admiringly. This time, Long Chen had truly handled things beautifully.

If he had killed the elder, nothing good would have come from it. There were plenty of people to replace the elder. The ones using him would encourage the rumors, ruining the image of the Martial Heaven Alliance by giving Long Chen a bad name.

It was an extremely sinister scheme but had been easily resolved by Long Chen. Even Qu Jianying was pleased. “I didn’t think a time would come when you could also resolve problems without your fists.”

Long Chen smiled. “Before this, I was always under the teachings of the old man. But now I am immersed in your sunlight. My wisdom has clearly soared.”

“Little brat, are you defecting?” snorted the old man.

Suddenly, the jade plates on everyone’s waist buzzed. Everyone looked, and their expressions sank.

“The Yin Yang World’s Sovereign seal has completely vanished.”

“Let’s go.” Daoist Heavenly Feather grabbed Long Chen, and the two of them vanished. They shuttled through space. Long Chen felt like he was in a crack within spacetime.

Suddenly, Daoist Heavenly Feather extended a hand. The void split open, and the two of them came out. They had arrived at the Yin Yang World.

The entrance to the Yin Yang World was no longer like it had been in the past. The scars from the battle when Long Chen had led the Dragonblood Legion against the Blood race for three days were still present. They looked fresh.

The Sovereign might that had been holding this place was now gone. The channel was naked. There was not the slightest barrier in the way of the Blood race.

Moreover, the army of the divine families that had been guarding this place was gone. Even their defensive structures had been taken away.

However, there was also no sound from the Blood race within the Yin Yang World. The silence was frightening.

Just at that moment, countless figures began to appear from the depths of the Yin Yang World. The Blood race’s army had finally come.

“Is the battle going to start ahead of time?” Long Chen unconsciously clenched his fists.
