Chapter 2124 Battle With the Stone Race

Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Shi Lingfeng blocked the lightning spear with his arms, but after a thunderous explosion, cracks covered his arms. They had almost exploded. Flying back, Shi Lingfeng was horrified. “This lightning...”

The Stone race was unafraid of lightning, but Long Chen’s lightning possessed the power of annihilation. It was not a kind of magical art, but more like a law.

This law of annihilation was something that posed a threat even to Shi Lingfeng with his stone body.

Long Chen smiled coldly. It didn’t matter if you possessed a body of stone or even steel. As long as you were alive, you could be killed by the destructive power of heavenly tribulation.

Of course, Shi Lingfeng’s body was special and did possess some natural resistance to thunderforce, or he would have been blown apart by that attack.

As Long Chen and Shi Lingfeng fought, the Dragonblood warriors swarmed the Stone race’s experts.

This time, the Dragonblood warriors weren’t fighting individually. Instead, they formed a special formation with their numbers.

There were over a thousand of them. They summoned their manifestations, and after being linked together by the formation, their manifestations transformed into a strange force field.

The Heavenly Dao energy of over a thousand Dragonblood warriors gathered together. The warriors felt their souls linked together and could convey thoughts to each other.

BANG!

Gu Yang was the first to reach his target, and he unleashed a powerful spear attack. In the very instant they clashed, a huge amount of power poured into him, and his opponent, who rivaled a third step Netherpassage expert, was killed instantly.

“Haha, idiots of the Stone race, today we’ll show you the true power of the Dragonblood Legion!” Gu Yang laughed heroically.

After forming this formation, the Dragonblood warriors were amazed to find that when their energies merged into their manifestations, they could freely share them with their fellow warriors. This was far more efficient than before.

Back then, Guo Ran had invented the Dragonblood Cross Slash by absorbing energy from all of them through their armor.

Now though, they could just pass the slightest bit of energy to Gu Yang with only a thought. There was no need for any armor linking them. Although each of them had only given him the slightest bit of energy, it was still energy from over a thousand people. That had caused Gu Yang’s power to leap to the point that he managed to slay his opponent in one blow.

“Kill! Kill these stone heads!”

The Dragonblood warriors were invigorated, and maintaining this formation, they crashed down upon the Stone race.

“Sundering Lightning Heavenly Wings!”

With a clap of thunder, Long Chen’s wings merged into one, transforming into a blade that slashed down from the sky.

The earth was torn asunder, and a destructive will filled the world. At this moment, Shi Lingfeng felt a sensation of death envelop him. Stamping on the ground, the earth around him began to shine brightly. He unleashed a powerful punch.

The Sundering Lightning Heavenly Wings slashed down mercilessly, and Shi Lingfeng’s arm crumbled. He flew back.

“Die!” Long Chen flew after him like a bolt of lightning. He needed to end this battle quickly because he was running out of spiritual yuan and Spiritual Strength after consecutive battles. The World Extermination Flame Lotus and the eighth form of Split the Heavens in particular had used up a lot of his energy. He was now relying on Lei Long to keep going. His lightning spear pierced toward Shi Lingfeng’s head.

“Long Chen, you cannot!”

Suddenly, a curtain of water appeared in front of him. His lightning spear struck the water curtain, pierced through it, and struck Shi Lingfeng’s head.

A hole was drilled into Shi Lingfeng’s forehead, but it didn’t go all the way through. Shi Lingfeng tumbled back, crashing amongst the stone.

“Fairy Zuiyue, what are you doing?”

Long Chen looked at the beautiful figure that had appeared in front of him. It was the Nangong family’s top genius, Nangong Zuiyue. Due to her interference, his killing blow had been weakened. Otherwise, Shi Lingfeng would be dead right now.

“Long Chen, you can’t kill him. If you do, you won’t be able to leave here alive. You have to stop immediately.” Nangong Zuiyue sent him an urgent message, one that was out of concern for him and also of nervousness.

Long Chen was startled by this. He counted Nangong Zuiyue as a friend and didn’t think that she would harm him. However, what did she mean by saying he wouldn’t be able to leave here alive?

Just at this moment, the old man’s voice rang out in his mind as well. “Long Chen, there’s a terrifying existence hidden beneath the Stone race’s land. We should stop fighting and prepare to leave.”

“Everyone, I am Nangong Yao. Can I ask everyone present to give the Nangong family some face and stop fighting for now?”

Just at this moment, a white-robed, middle-aged man walked over with a group of people.

“Dragonblood Legion, pause for now.”

Long Chen was getting a bad feeling. With the old man’s character, for him to say that he wanted to retreat meant that whatever was going on, it was even worse than what he imagined. It just so happened that they could retreat now with the Nangong family as an excuse.

Just after the Nangong family’s people arrived, more groups appeared. Long Chen quickly saw the Dongfang family’s people, including their family head and Dongfang Yuyang.

He then also saw Beitang Rushuang standing beside a white-haired woman who looked very old. She was staring at Long Chen with shock.

There were too many experts present, so it wasn’t convenient for her to talk to him. When she saw him looking over, she glared at him, afraid that he would bring up that nonsense about how despite the two of them being drawn together, he couldn’t marry her.

“The great era has come. It is a surge of geniuses but also indicates that a great tribulation is going to happen. At this time, the Martial Heaven Continent must be united and focus on cultivating to fight against invaders. Junior brother Long Chen, you must understand this principle as well. I really can’t understand why you have to act like this then. Is a little bit of disharmony worth fighting to the death? You’ve already destroyed the Mechanism Sect. Now you won’t even let off the Stone race. Does destroying the core forces of the continent really benefit you?” The Dongfang family’s head shook his head at Long Chen, sighing disappointedly.

Hearing that the Mechanism Sect had already been destroyed, quite a few people gasped. Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang covered their mouths.

Nangong Zuiyue thought that the reason they had arrived in time was because this place was the Central Xuan Region, and that the Stone race’s territory wasn’t too far from the Nangong family. Other powers also had eyes everywhere, and such a movement couldn’t escape them, so they had rushed over.

Originally, they had thought that any existence that was fighting against the Stone race had to be some huge existence, but when they arrived, it was actually just over a thousand people of Long Chen’s Dragonblood Legion.

Just over a thousand people had dared to charge into the Stone race’s ancestral lands. Seeing the corpses of the Stone race littering the ground, as well as Shi Lingfeng who had a hole in his head and an arm missing, people sucked in cold gasps of air. Was the Dragonblood Legion really so terrifying?

At this time, the old man and the golden expert stopped fighting, retreating to their respective sides. The golden expert looked at the corpses on the ground, and killing intent exploded out of him.

However, in his fight against the old man, he had used his full power and was unable to do anything to him. Now that he heard that the Mechanism Sect had been destroyed, he was shocked.

The Stone race actually had a secret relationship with the Mechanism Sect. They provided some of the divine ores in their territory to the Mechanism Sect, and the Mechanism Sect secretly created formations for the Stone race.

Both of them were very secretive, and no one else knew about their relationship. This was why when Zhao Wuji had been defeated by Long Chen during the gathering of past and present heroes, Shi Lingfeng had interfered to prevent him from being killed.

The Stone race had never imagined that an existence as powerful as the Mechanism Sect would be destroyed. The Stone race had even been preparing to send a message requesting reinforcements.

Everyone’s gazes locked onto Long Chen, only to see him indifferently say, “The master of the Dongfang family must possess great knowledge and wisdom. So could it be that you missed the fact that the Mechanism Sect and the Stone race had tried to sneak attack the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race just before this, forcing us to hunt them down? Since you didn’t know what had happened, don’t you think it’s hypocritical for you to judge us blindly like you’re ethically superior?”

“If you’re saying that the Mechanism Sect and the Stone race joined hands to attack the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, then how are there no injuries amongst the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race?” sneered someone from the Dongfang family, clearly doubting Long Chen’s words.

“Don’t talk nonsense!” scolded Dongfang Yuyang.

“Of? Can it be that we have to wait until a few of us are dead before counterattacking? Are you sure you have a brain in your head? Otherwise, why would you say something so brainless?” scoffed Long Chen. It was no wonder Dongfang Yuyang would chide this person.

“Let’s not talk about meaningless things. Is the Dongfang family planning on acting as the judge over this matter? If so, then we’ll first have to discuss whether or not you’re qualified to do such a thing.”

The old man finally opened his mouth, his eyes shining brightly as he looked at the Dongfang family’s head.
