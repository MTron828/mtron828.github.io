Chapter 4790 Lose Face or Lose Life

When this seven-color sword pierced the head of the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint, the entire world suddenly flickered as if about to collapse. Everything seemed to be playing out slowly as that happened.

The very world quivered, as if heaven and earth felt this attack and started to unleash their own emotions.

“Mercy!”

Just then, a roar emanated from the other side of the fragmented spatial gate that had been blasted apart by the Heaven Saint’s forceful entry. It was through this fragment that a voice said, "I am..."

Long Zhantian interjected, “If you want him alive, you should keep your mouth shut. I don’t care about pros and cons, nor do I accept any threats.”

Long Zhantian’s seven-color divine light sword had pierced the Heaven Saint’s head, yet he refrained from using his full power. Seeing the slightest hope, the person behind the gate immediately begged for mercy.

After all, a Heaven Saint was a major force in any faction, and even the Celestial race could not afford to lose one. With the loss of a Heaven Saint divine beast and the prospect of losing another Heaven Saint, their very foundation trembled.

“That voice... Could it be the Celestial race’s leader?!” exclaimed someone behind the Heaven Overseer.

The Heaven Overseer’s smile widened slightly, and his eyes were now practically burning with anticipation. “It’s naturally him, as no one else would dare to beg for mercy on behalf of a Heaven Saint. Long Zhantian really is a blessing to the Long clan. If Long Chen could also return to the Long clan, just how much would we prosper?”

At this moment, the Heaven Saint was completely still, terrified out of his mind as he knew that his life was entirely in Long Zhantian’s hands.

Regret and unwillingness consumed him. Seeing that Long Zhantian was just a clone and hadn’t summoned his manifestation, the Heaven Saint hadn’t deemed it necessary to summon his manifestation first. Little did he anticipate the sheer terror of Long Zhantian’s seven-color Supreme Blood. It breached his defenses before his manifestation could materialize fully, sealing his fate in a complete defeat.

“I don’t accept it,” the Heaven Saint declared through clenched teeth. “If you’re a real man, release me. We’ll have a real fight with real weapons. If you kill me like this, I won’t accept this defeat.”

“I couldn’t care less about your acceptance. I’ve never been concerned with others’ opinions of me. This psychological game of yours is incredibly childish,” Long Zhantian retorted, his smile beaming slightly. He seemed like a refined scholar, looking peaceful and amicable. However, despite his genteel appearance, he held the power to determine the life or death of a Heaven Saint.

What terrified people the most was how at ease Long Zhantian seemed to be. He emitted no aura or any pressure, looking like an ordinary person, yet he had the ability to defy the heavens and slay gods.

He was like a well. At first, he seemed incredibly ordinary, but no one knew what lay beneath the surface. He was an existence that no one could see through.

Even his clone was able to crush a Heaven Saint—a fact that absolutely shocked everyone.

All experts who had been instigated by the Celestial race into attacking Long Chen were now soaked in cold sweat. Only now did they realize just how foolish they had been, walking right past the gates of hell.

“However, you don’t need to worry. It’s beneath me to kill trash like you.”

BANG!

Suddenly, Long Zhantian’s foot stamped onto the Heaven Saint’s Dantian. With an explosive sound, he was sent flying out of Long Zhantian’s grasp.

As expected, Long Zhantian kept his word. He didn’t kill the Heaven Saint, but every expert could sense the fall of the Heaven Saint’s aura.

“You...!” A furious shout came from the fragment of the gate.

The Heaven Saint roared, “How dare you?! You destroyed my Heaven Saint foundation!”

As the roar reverberated, the crowd grasped the gravity of the situation, and their fear of Long Zhantian intensified. How could he destroy the foundation of a Heaven Saint so easily? Even though both of them were Heaven Saints, his power was far beyond that of his opponent. The two were on different planes of power.

“Not killing you is already extremely generous of me. Are you still not satisfied? If you don’t accept it, you can always challenge me again,” replied Long Zhantian indifferently.

“You...”

The Heaven Saint quivered with rage. If he were to attack, he would just be sending himself to his death.

“Alright, I, Ren Xuefeng, will remember this!” declared the Heaven Saint before vanishing. A grand Heaven Saint had come ferociously, only to flee hurriedly—a stark contrast to how he had exploded the spatial gate to get here.

Once Ren Xuefeng was gone, the other experts of the Celestial race didn’t dare to tarry. They also quickly left, and Long Chen ignored them. He couldn’t be bothered with them.

However, when one particular group started to leave, he shouted, “Hold it! Who said that you could go?”

This group consisted of those who had attacked the Dragonblood Legion due to the Celestial race’s instigation.

They instantly stiffened, completely terrified. Even without considering Long Zhantian, Long Chen alone could annihilate all of them.

Amongst the crowd, one elder quickly forced a smile. “A misunderstanding. It was all a misunderstanding. The Celestial race is completely shameless and insidious, and we unfortunately fell for their schemes. Someone as magnanimous as yourself wouldn’t quibble with us over that, right? After all, no harm befell you due to our folly. Don’t worry, we will definitely make sure to teach our disciples who attacked you. They only have themselves to blame for being so blind. We won’t let them harbor any thoughts of vengeance.”

This person was nothing more than an ordinary Sage King, but it seemed that his tongue was quite skillful. His ability to react pragmatically was quite high.

“I’m not so magnanimous,” replied Long Chen lightly. “Don’t try to tell me about that useless crap. I’ve seen this kind of play many times, so I won’t waste more words. Every single one of you, kowtow and I will let this matter pass. If you don’t want to, that’s fine too. You can just leave your heads behind.”

Long Chen didn’t want their lives, but he also felt like letting them off for nothing would make certain fools think that it was alright to bully them, and that would only bring them more trouble. These fools had to pay a price, or they wouldn’t learn their lesson. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“What?”

These people were dumbfounded. Making them kowtow was incredibly embarrassing, but they would rather lose their dignity than lose their lives. These people were filled with righteous indignation, but didn’t know what to do.

Just then, a soft voice rang out.

“Let me kowtow to you in their place.”
