Chapter 3689 Violet Flame Heaven Capital

When the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree’s divine light surrounded Long Chen, his seven-colored divine ring automatically appeared. After that, Long Chen tried to search for the connection between his divine ring and the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree’s divine radiance.

The energy of Long Chen’s divine ring felt so close to the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree’s fluctuations. When the seven-colored divine ring appeared, the tree’s energy would automatically flow into it.

However, the divine ring’s energy could not enter the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, so the tree’s energy transmission was unidirectional.

An incense stick’s worth of time later, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree once more vanished, returning to the primal chaos space.

Long Chen was not summoning the real Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree when he brought it out. This could be considered a clone of it, and so it was temporary. After exhausting all of its energy, it would automatically return to the primal chaos space to rest, and before it gathered enough energy, it could not be summoned again.

“That was too fast! It was only a few breaths’ time!” cried Guo Ran.

“Be happy with what you get. We’ve already figured out thirty-seven runes. Through our tests, we’ve confirmed that they are all correct. Furthermore, we can’t even sense the passing of time during this enlightenment. If you keep complaining, boss might slap you,” scolded Xia Chen with a laugh.

Xia Chen was clearer on things than Guo Ran. For them to figure out thirty-seven runes like this, it was not something possible without half a year of constant work. People had to know when to be satisfied.

However, these were all runes for Guo Ran’s Supreme Arm. Considering Guo Ran’s impatient nature, he wanted to figure them all out in one go.

“Guo Ran, that’s about enough for you. Xia Chen also needs to cultivate. Researching your runes all day makes it so that he has no time for his own cultivation.” Long Chen frowned.

In the past few days, Xia Chen was locked down by Guo Ran to study the Supreme Bone. During this time, Long Chen hadn’t even seen Xia Chen take a break, let alone cultivate for himself. Hence, he couldn’t help speaking up for Xia Chen.

Guo Ran was instantly ashamed. “Brother, I’m sorry. I’m too selfish. My Supreme Bone already has so many runes that we’ve figured out. For me, you actually delayed your own cultivation.”

It was only when Long Chen brought it up that Guo Ran realized he had gone a bit too far. Ever since he was reunited with Xia Chen, all their time together was for his sake, while Xia Chen himself didn’t get to even cultivate.

Xia Chen smiled. “It’s fine. We’re brothers. If you’re stronger, I’m stronger as well. These things can’t be separated.”

“Haha, that’s right too. Then let’s continue studying the Supreme Bone!” laughed Guo Ran.

Long Chen directly clapped him on the back of his head, and Guo Ran’s teeth clacked together. Long Chen then scolded, “Xia Chen is being courteous so that you don’t feel guilty, but you really don’t view him as an outsider, do you!?”

“We’re brothers, so why should I feel guilty? If I’m stronger, he’s stronger as well, right?” Guo Ran held his head and grumbled. Seeing Long Chen raise his hand again, he hastily fled behind Xia Chen.

Long Chen seriously said, “Xia Chen, spend some more time for yourself. Your talisman arts are powerful, to the extent that even against me, you would at least be able to flee safely. But this time, there will be countless heavenly geniuses in the three thousand worlds. There will be monsters, existences that were sealed for countless years just for this moment. Big brother Xia Guhong even said that the opening of the three thousand worlds is the spark that will cause chaos within the nine heavens and ten lands. All kinds of races will come, including the dark world’s lifeforms. There will most likely be a slaughter within the three thousand worlds. Even if you don’t have priceless treasures, just being from an enemy race will cause others to hunt you down. Also, I am worried about you encountering someone who can control a domain like last time. If your talismans are restricted, you might not be able to get away.”

When Guo Ran heard this, he also grew serious. In their battle against Liao Bencang, his faith domain was their greatest nightmare. If it weren’t for Long Chen’s Purgatory Eyes at the end opening a path, the three of them would have died.

In that battle, it was Xia Chen who was suppressed the heaviest. Hence, if he encountered someone else like Liao Bencang, it really would be dangerous for him.

Thinking of how he had made Xia Chen help him study his runes this entire time to improve himself, Guo Ran was instantly ashamed.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xia Chen nodded. “Boss, I understand. Actually, I’ve been researching how to break the power of a domain while helping Guo Ran study his Supreme Bone. I’ve also thought of a few possibilities based on the runes on Guo Ran’s Supreme Bone. Helping Guo Ran really is helping myself.”

“Good. I’ve asked, and the entrance to the three thousand worlds is the chaotic flow of space. When you enter, you will be drawn into different spatial channels. That means no one knows where they’ll land within the three thousand worlds. Since that’s the case, the chance of two people being able to land together is very low, so everyone must be prepared to fight for themselves. Guo Ran has his Supreme Bone and his battle armor. He is capable of fighting alone, and I’m not worried about him. But I am worried about you. In a couple of days, I can summon the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree one more time. Under its light, it can let you enter a state of empty spirit to easily comprehend things. So, you are not to worry about Guo Ran right now. Do your best to study how to break a domain. Hopefully, you’ll be able to come up with a way to break out of a domain with the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree’s help,” said Long Chen.

During the next few days, Guo Ran especially didn’t bother Xia Chen. He just started adding runes to his battle armor. Those were the runes that they had figured out and decided upon.

Furthermore, with the help of Long Chen’s medicinal pills, their cultivation bases had already reached the peak of the Divine Lord realm. They were merely a single step away from the Immortal King realm.

As for Long Chen’s cultivation base, he was on the verge of breaking through to the twelfth Heavenstage of Divine Lord. His crazy consumption of medicinal pills to increase his cultivation base didn’t cause any adverse effects.

During this time, all of his advancements didn’t cause his aura to change at all. All of the energy was absorbed by the Violet Tower Star. Thus, Long Chen didn’t feel anything,

Five days later, Long Chen was finally able to summon the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree once more. Xia Chen was also prepared. Being immersed within its light, he started jotting down ideas.

Regretfully, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree only lasted for a few breaths’ time before returning to the primal chaos space. Clearly, its energy was not fully recovered from the last time.

Because of it,  Xia Chen didn’t manage to fully finish. However, Long Chen was gratified when Xia Chen said that he already had the overall idea in place. Even without the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, he would be able to finish his plan.

The next day, Long Chen silently advanced to the twelfth Heavenstage. At this time, Xia Guhong came over.

“Let’s go. We’re going to the Violet Flame Heaven Capital. Let us see all the grand heroes beneath the heavens!”
