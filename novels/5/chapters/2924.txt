Chapter 2913 Every Thread Is Priceless

Long Chen patted his own chest. When he looked down at his robes, a rare warmth appeared on his face.

“Last time, I didn’t fight you directly because I was worried about damaging my robes. These clothes possess far too much meaning to me.”

“Hahaha, this has to be the most shameless, most laughable excuse I’ve ever heard,” scoffed Chu Kuang.

“That’s fine. You can laugh if you want. Many people have asked me why I always wear these worn-down clothes anyway,” said Long Chen. Everyone then looked at him. His clothes were truly unbearably worn out with many patches.

The threadwork that went into those patches was clearly coarse. It was done by someone who didn’t have skill in needlework, and it was very likely Long Chen himself.

Mu Qingyun and the others had asked Long Chen about his black robes many times, but he had never answered them. Now that he mentioned it, Mu Qingyun and the others’ ears perked up. Even the people outside, including the head judge, were curious.

It had to be known that Long Chen had always been destitute. However, he had been willing to give up his position as an instructor just because of these black robes.

Long Chen rubbed his black robes, saying, “These clothes were made by my loved ones just before the last battle of my world. Every thread contains their feelings; every inch contains endless hope. These clothes are irreplaceable to me. Wearing them, I don’t feel alone or afraid. Before I find my loved ones again, I will keep wearing these clothes. Every thread is priceless…”

Long Chen’s voice was heavy, and his voice contained both grief and longing. Everyone could clearly feel his pain.

“I didn’t expect this fellow to have such a sentimental side.” Luo Ning was surprised. She hadn’t expected Long Chen to have such an infatuation. He was actually so attached to one set of clothes.

Hence, quite a few women watching were affected by his emotions. With his pride, he would definitely disdain telling such a lie, so they were willing to believe every word.

Long Chen continued, “Last time, my mortal qi had yet to fully regress, and with no immortal spiritual qi, I could not form a protective layer around my clothes. Fighting with you might have damaged them. In my eyes, your life isn’t worth crap, so it wasn’t worth the risk. Now do you understand?”

“What bullshit. Even if you want to make up stories, you should know your limit. My life isn’t worth some clothes? Do you take me for a fool?” sneered Chu Kuang. He was clearly angered by these insulting words.

Long Chen looked at him indifferently. “Do you think that you’re not a fool? If you weren’t a fool, you wouldn’t have become enemies with me. If you weren’t a fool, you wouldn’t be wasting time talking with me. You think that you’re stalling for time for the people inside to light the last two lamps and take the flag for victory. If you weren’t a fool, you would have seen that Mu Qingyun’s aura is slowly recovering. She has reached seventy percent. Is her recovery enough to affect the entire battlefield now?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chu Kuang was shocked. Only now did he notice that Mu Qingyun was hiding at the rear, rapidly recovering.

The half-dead Li Cai was blocking his line of sight, drawing their attention. Hence, no one had noticed that Mu Qingyun was recovering.

Not one of the countless eyes watching the battlefield had noted Mu Qingyun’s tiny movements. They had all assumed that with her injuries, she could no longer rejoin the battle. Hence, everyone’s attention had been on Long Chen.

It was only through Long Chen’s reminder that they realized that while Chu Kuang was scheming, Long Chen was also scheming.

“Kill them!” Chu Kuang’s expression finally changed and he shouted. As a result, the remaining disciples immediately charged out. As long as they weren’t facing Long Chen, they didn’t feel any fear.

“Qingyun, kill them all and get to the altar. Leave Chu Kuang to me. I entrust the flag to you,” said Long Chen.

“Brother San, don’t worry!” Mu Qingyun had recovered seventy percent of her power with the help of Long Chen’s medicinal pill, so she was full of confidence. As a sword cultivator, her weak physical body was a fatal weakness, but it had one benefit. Her recovery was also fast.

Mu Qingyun then led the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples forward. In the very first clash, over ten of their enemies’ weapons were broken. Mu Qingyun’s sword-light was even sharper than before.

With Mu Qingyun at the front, the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples blasted through their midst.

After Gu Fei, Xiang Kejie, Tang Yaochen, Li Chengbei, Yang Fang, and the others were killed by Long Chen, none of the others could compare to them. Although Mu Qingyun was only at seventy percent of her full power, no one from the Prime Glory Alliance could stop her.

Upon seeing this, Chu Kuang’s expression changed. He had schemed and schemed, but he had never thought that Mu Qingyun’s recovery would be so fast. Now, the Prime Glory Alliance was in danger.

He suddenly stamped on the ground, choosing to kill Mu Qingyun first. Even if he didn’t kill her, giving her a heavy injury would be enough.

However, just as he moved, a hand came from a bizarre angle and struck him in the face.

Long Chen seemed to have expected Chu Kuang’s way of thought. Just as Chu Kuang’s gaze changed, Long Chen moved, arriving in front of him.

“He perfectly predicted Chu Kuang’s movements!” Some of the senior experts outside were shocked. Long Chen not only saw through Chu Kuang’s intentions, but he also accurately judged Chu Kuang’s path and launched his attack before Chu Kuang even moved. Now it was as if Chu Kuang had simply jumped into Long Chen’s moving palm.

Such a thing was only possible for a powerful expert toying with someone far weaker. It required sharp observation skills, experience, and accurate calculations, as well as many other factors. But Long Chen had done it to Chu Kuang. As a result, Chu Kuang was sent flying before he even understood what happened.

While being wrapped in multiple lights, Chu Kuang smashed into a giant mountain many miles away.

He was like a cannonball, smashing straight through the mountain. The top part of the mountain then collapsed, sending boulders flying.

“Damn, what kind of power is this?”

The spectators were stunned. A slap in the face could send someone multiple miles away? Was that something a Mortal Transcendence disciple was capable of?

“If it weren’t for Chu Kuang’s Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor, that one slap might have killed him. This power is truly stunning…” murmured Heaven Master Yun Yang.

The five-colored light around Chu Kuang was the automatic protection of the Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor. Hence, other than a very clear handprint swelling on his face, Chu Kuang wasn’t injured. However, the slap made him dizzy, and he was unable to differentiate north from south, east from west.

Just as he was regaining his orientation, a flame spear pierced through the air at him.
