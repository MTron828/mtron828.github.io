Chapter 2732 Captured

Those elders did not just belong to one power. Some of them were from the Blood race, the demonic beast race, the Undying race, and the devil race. Every single one of them was terrifyingly powerful. However, amongst them was an even more terrifying expert who vaguely had the aura of a Sovereign.

That expert with the Sovereign aura was the old monster of the Undying race, the one who had fought three days and nights against Sovereign Zi Yang.

However, their leader was not any one of them. Instead, it was the divine families’ Lord Saint. As soon as he appeared, Long Chen’s heart turned cold.

A Saint was an existence that stood at almost the peak of the current world. For over ten of them to appear now, even Long Chen felt despair.

In order to capture him, it could be said that the various powers had brought out their full forces. They didn’t give him any chance of escaping. Their trap was practically seamless, inescapable. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Lord Saint of the divine families didn’t even glance at Long Aotian when the latter roared angrily. Instead, he looked at Long Chen. “Long Chen, you are an amazing genius just like your father. I cannot bear to see you die here. If you swear to hand over all your secrets, I can open this net. Once this tribulation is over, I will send you to the higher plane.”

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and coldly looked at the Lord Saint. “Don’t act so fake. I admit that I’ve been defeated this time. From your eyes, I can see what you’re thinking. You’ve taken the most valuable thing from me last time, and now you want to take more. Send me to a higher plane once this tribulation is over? Do you think that it is possible? When Long Aotian becomes a true Sovereign, will you have the power to make such a promise? Don’t keep acting. You are the same as Long Aotian. Do you think I’m a fool to fall for this act? You want my secrets? Keep dreaming. Perhaps you can take my life, but you won’t be able to take what you really want.”

Long Chen knew that he was caught. Having fallen into their hands, he would definitely be facing a life worse than death. All that was left was one final desperate attempt.

In the face of his impending death, Long Chen didn’t feel fear, only unresigned. He regretted not fully trusting the sense of danger from the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. If he had thought it over more, perhaps he would have been able to break this trap.

Thinking of the doom of the Martial Heaven Continent and everyone who would die, he knew he had to survive. His head rapidly worked as he stared coldly at the Lord Saint.

The Lord Saint shook his head. “The matter involving your father back then is something I feel great regret for. It was a mistake. How can I allow this mistake to occur again? Promise to hand over your secrets, and I will have everyone within the divine families swear not to make things hard on you.”

“What about my brothers, my wives?” asked Long Chen.

The Lord Saint shook his head. “I can only guarantee your life. As for everyone else, they are all pieces within the tribulation. No one can change their fates.”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the space in front of Long Chen exploded, and he shot back like a shooting star, entering the crowd once more. He actually threw himself into their net.

The Lord Saint’s expression changed. By entering the crowd, they couldn’t attack him with their full power, or it would affect their allies as well.

“Stop him!”

Long Chen’s target was Long Aotian. Long Aotian was furious. He was no fool. He saw that Long Chen wanted to take him hostage.

“Intolerable!” Long Aotian roared furiously. He couldn’t possibly retreat at this moment. A Sovereign had to maintain an undefeatable Dao-heart. There was no way he could become a full Sovereign without it.

BOOM!

However, the result was that his injuries had yet to heal, and he was unable to block a single blow from Long Chen. He was sent flying.

As rumbling rang out, a lightning spear flew out of Long Chen’s right hand. Only now did Long Aotian realize that Long Chen wasn’t using him as a hostage. He was trying to drag Long Aotian down with him.

Divine lightning thundered. This spear contained all of Lei Linger’s power, and its destructive power blew away the laws of heaven and earth. Even Long Aotian’s Sovereign crown vanished.

The nine dragons in Long Aotian’s manifestation grew dim, which indicated that the power of his manifestation had been sealed. In other words, if this attack killed him, there would be no substitute. He would be truly dead.

Lei Linger had absorbed the divine lightning of the five Sovereigns. What laws could possibly restrict her? Her power caused even the Lord Saint’s expression to change.

The Nine-Headed Lion, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, Ye Ming, and the Alldevil Heavenwalker were capable of helping. If the four of them joined forces, they should be able to receive this attack.

However, the four of them simply stood there, seemingly waiting for Long Chen to kill Long Aotian first. There was even some delight in their eyes.

Suddenly, a jade pendant glowed on Long Aotian’s chest. Following that, a hand reached out. It was the same hand that had smacked Long Chen down.

It was the Lord Saint. Long Aotian had used the power of the jade pendant to have the Lord Saint appear before him. It was actually unaffected by Lei Linger’s influence.

The lightning spear directly pierced the Lord Saint’s hand, continuing all the way to strike his chest.

BOOM! The clothes on the Lord Saint’s chest were blown apart, revealing a thin bony chest. Countless runes flowed across his skin. His skin looked like it was made of gold, but now there was a large hole in his chest.

The Lord Saint looked down at the hole and cracks in his chest. “Even the divine families’ Golden Saint Body was broken by you. You deserve to be called Long Zhantian’s son. If you had reached the ninth Heavenstage, this attack might have taken my life. Regretfully, this is your fate.”

The other Saints also attacked at this time, and rays of divine light enveloped Long Chen.

Long Chen let out a heaven-shaking roar as he fought back against the suppression of a dozen Saints. His skin was torn apart, and blood instantly dyed him red.

The old monster of the Undying race narrowed his eyes. He slowly raised his staff, and six strange rays of light shot out from the eye sockets of the three skulls on his staff.

BANG!

Suddenly, the Lord Saint appeared in front of Long Chen, and with a palm to his head, knocked him unconscious. He tossed Long Chen to the divine families’ experts.

He then turned to the Undying race’s elder. “What? Were you trying to refine Long Chen into a puppet to replace Ye Ming?”

The old monster silently lowered his staff and indifferently said, “You misunderstand. I was just thinking of helping you suppress Long Chen.”

Long Chen was captured. After that, the divine families’ experts bound him with countless chains and took out over a hundred trapping formations. Even the Lord Saint would be unable to escape if bound by this many formations. It could be seen just how cautious they were when it came to Long Chen.

“Wait, where is Long Chen’s saber?!”

Suddenly, a cry rang out. Just now, all their focus had been on suppressing Long Chen. No one had noticed that Evilmoon had vanished at some point.
