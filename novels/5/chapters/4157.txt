Chapter 4146: Strange Person Undergoing Tribulation

When Long Chen entered the primal chaos space, he was shocked to find that it was full of the aura of an Eternal expert.

The black soil had started devouring the Great Desolate Winged Devil, and as it did so, it unleashed not only life energy but also a profound Eternal aura.

Originally, the primal chaos space did not contain any laws of heaven and earth. But as the Great Desolate Winged Devil was devoured, law power similar to the outside world gradually filled the primal chaos space.

“Could it be that the primal chaos space will be able to develop into a world like the nine heavens and ten lands? Then doesn’t that mean that I will be able to control the laws?”

Long Chen was shaken. Even after all this time, he still knew too little about the primal chaos space. This world manifested from a single bead was too mysterious, too frightening.

It could even devour an Eternal expert, and through devouring this corpse, it unleashed the power of laws.

Long Chen suddenly thought of how the innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company had unleashed runes when his physical body was destroyed. Those runes were then reclaimed by heaven and earth.

Now that this corpse’s body was being broken apart, those Heavenly Dao runes should be taken by the Heavenly Daos, but it wasn’t. At the same time, Long Chen thought of the sea whale.

The sea whale died and returned its physical body to the sea. That was how it repaid the world for raising it. In the same vein, an innate Heaven Venerate had their runes reclaimed by the Heavenly Daos after dying.

If Long Chen killed innate Heaven Venerates in the future, what would happen if he tossed their corpses into the primal chaos space before those runes scattered? Would those runes be absorbed by the primal chaos space?

Long Chen suddenly had a wild idea. If that was true, that would mean it could steal from the Heavenly Daos.

As long as he could take enough, he could truly fight the heavens. However, presently, he didn’t know how to unleash the power of the primal chaos space.

“Damn, this Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse is incredibly powerful!”

Long Chen had gathered countless corpses in the Linglong World, causing the Fusang Trees and Moon Trees to grow to ten thousand miles.

However, after just a few hours of the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse inside, they had once more grown another three thousand miles and were still crazily growing.

After reaching this size, their trunks were covered in flames. Long Chen saw that their bark had produced a flame rune.

Long Chen was incredibly excited by the appearance of that rune. This meant that the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees had finally gone from soft shoots into saplings.

As a result, Huo Linger was now a busy bee. She was running from one tree after another, absorbing their flames to strengthen herself.

As for the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus that Long Chen had planted, it was also growing crazily. In comparison to the Devil Eye Water Lily, it had grown significantly larger, creating a vast thousand-mile pool around itself. The pool exuded a blood-red hue and radiated a potent devilish aura.

However, the lotus at the center was like a crystal, beautiful and holy. It had reached a size of a hundred miles, and there was a single flower in full bloom. It seemed to contain boundless life energy.

“Hehe, it blooms so quickly and can start producing seeds soon. The Heaven Merging Blood Lotus is a multipurpose divine medicine. Furthermore, it is the main ingredient for the Heaven Merging World Breaking Pill. This really is a treasure.” Long Chen was excited just looking at the flourishing Heaven Merging Blood Lotus.

The primal chaos space was truly helping him out. Long Chen's present achievements would have been impossible without its invaluable assistance.

At this moment, Huo Linger was being such a busy bee that she didn’t even notice Long Chen’s arrival. Not wanting to disturb her, he retreated from the primal chaos space.

“Huo Linger’s getting stronger and stronger. If this continues, I’m not gonna be a match for her in the future! Hehe, next time, I’ll find a chance to see what it feels like to be protected by a little girl.” Long Chen laughed. Huo Linger was rapidly strengthening, and the Fusang Trees and Moon Trees were also growing rapidly. In the future, Huo Linger would be in control of even greater power.

Furthermore, even if Huo Linger’s power surpassed his, Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit worried. He had absolute trust in Huo Linger.

After scamming the Blood Devil race, Long Chen became much more obedient. Under Xu Jianxiong’s protection, they slowly got closer to the Sage King Prefecture.

Xu Jianxiong was in no rush, so he brought them to one city after another in a leisurely stroll. During this time, Long Chen and the others bought various rarities in those cities.

Quite a few people would immediately begin whispering amongst themselves upon spotting Long Chen, so his fame continued to grow.

However, most of those gazes were not very respectful. Instead, they were greedy and sinister. What they cared about were his treasures and the fame that they could get from killing him.

This was the so-called principle of people fear fame like pigs fear getting fat. Wherever he went, people stared at him. Someone else might feel like there was a blade hanging right behind them. However, Long Chen didn’t mind. People would be staring at him anyway, so he didn’t care that this day happened a bit earlier. What was important was to sell the counterfeit Earth Cauldron that Guo Ran had made.

After all, Guo Ran and Xia Chen had spent quite a bit of effort to create it. If Long Chen didn’t sell it for a good price, it would be letting them down.

What troubled Long Chen was that even after several days, no one came to talk business with him.

“Fuck, what is going on? They don’t want to buy and only want to steal?”

Long Chen sneered. Alright, if they wanted to take it by force, they could try it. If he didn’t tear off their underpants, he wouldn’t be called Boss Long San.

At first, Long Chen would shout everywhere he went, saying that he was selling the Heaven Earth Cauldron. But with people looking at him like he was an idiot, he eventually had no desire to keep shouting.

The closer they got to the core of the Sage King Star-Field, the more terrifying powers were present. Some monstrous heavenly geniuses also appeared one after another.

In just a few days, all kinds of immemorial greater demons, desolate races, and others showed up. Long Chen even saw a terrifying lifeform composed entirely of immortal metal. Without flesh and blood, its entire body was made of immortal metal, and its aura was particularly shocking.

Just yesterday, Long Chen saw a Kunpeng with golden wings outside the city, and its aura was countless times stronger than Kun Tu’s. The two were simply not on the same level.

More and more terrifying heavenly geniuses appeared, some of them with immense fame and some with ancient, mysterious inheritances that only existed in legends.

However, all those inheritances appeared with the Sage King Convention. It had yet to even start, but it had attracted countless heavenly geniuses. With them around, there was an endless stream of battles between them. On the other hand, the closer Long Chen and his companions got to the core region, the more restrained the Heaven Venerates were, afraid of drawing a calamity onto their race.

On this day, Xu Jianxiong was in the midst of leading the way when the void shuddered, and an aura of annihilation unfurled. Feeling it, everyone jumped in shock and raised their heads. After that, they saw tribulation clouds gathering and rushing toward them.

“What is going on?”

Xu Jianxiong was slightly surprised. No one here was having a breakthrough, so why would there be heavenly tribulation?

Abruptly, the fabric of the void contorted, and a figure darted past their vicinity. In its wake, the heavenly tribulation surged in pursuit.

“Who is that? How can they move in a heavenly tribulation?” Xu Jianxiong and the others were astonished. But more importantly, that person didn’t seem to be breaking through. What the hell was that?

However, because of their speed, no one could see their figure clearly. Long Chen and the others didn’t even know what kind of lifeform that was.

However, what Xu Jianxiong didn’t expect was for that figure to suddenly turn back, leading the heavenly tribulation back to them, effectively blocking their path forward.

“You are Long Chen? Hand over the Heaven Earth Cauldron, or you’ll all die!” A sinister voice rang out from within the heavenly tribulation.
