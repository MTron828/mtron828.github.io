Chapter 4297 Long Zhantian’s Gift

In Long Zhantian's eyes, seven-colored ripples formed a mesmerizing rainbow vortex that was both beautiful and mysterious. This was the legendary Supreme Heavenly Eye, a phenomenon Long Chen had only encountered in ancient texts. Now, he was witnessing it firsthand, and it was within his own father's eyes.

Seven-colored divine light flickered in Long Zhantian’s eyes. With it, it was as if he could see through the mysteries of heaven and earth, like a deity overlooking this world.

“Chen-er, next is the Immortal King tribulation. You should undergo it with me,” said Long Zhantian.

“Dad…!” Long Chen was shocked.

“Don’t worry. Everything is under control,” said Long Zhantian with a smile.

“Alright.”

Long Chen walked over to Long Zhantian’s side, and Long Zhantian firmly patted his son's shoulder. With that simple gesture, the father and son exchanged a smile.

The next moment, Long Zhantian absorbed over ten bottles of his seven-color Supreme Blood, causing his realm to repeatedly climb. In an instant, he almost broke through to the Immortal King realm.

However, this time, the nine heavens underwent a dramatic transformation, causing the tribulation clouds to change their hue to a mesmerizing seven-colored palette.

From a distance, this tribulation looked like a seven-colored vortex, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the pattern within Long Zhantian's eyes.

“Dad, did you already know what your tribulations are going to be like before starting?” Long Chen stared at him in shock.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Long Zhantian smiled slightly. “If you can calm your heart, you can do the same. This is a kind of perception. Although there will be differences with reality, they won’t be that far off.”

Long Chen was flabbergasted. How could someone know what their heavenly tribulation would be like? This completely toppled Long Chen’s understanding of the world.

“As long as a person’s heart remains calm and composed, they can focus their full attention and spirit, enabling them to sense impending fortune or disaster. This is a unique ability that the human race developed to survive in the harshest conditions. Without this keen perception, the human race might have faced extinction long ago. However, as the human race got stronger, this perception gradually regressed. After realizing this, many people started to specifically develop their perception arts, leading to the emergence of various divination techniques and methods for predicting fate, such as feng shui and the five-element horoscopes. They are all branches of perception arts. However, despite all their efforts, the human race’s innate perception continued to regress, leaving people to rely solely on their observations of the present to make predictions about the future," explained Long Zhantian.

“Amazing. But I’m only able to sense certain dangers, and they have to be nearby for me to sense them. As for the rest, I am utterly blind,” said Long Chen with a bitter smile.

“You don’t need to be envious, and you shouldn’t force yourself to somehow learn it. Some things just cannot be forced. I have two major worries in my heart. One is you, and the other is your mother. Thankfully, you are by my side, and you have told me that your mother is safe as well. That is the only reason my heart is able to calm down enough to do this. In comparison, you have too many burdens and control too many types of power that make it difficult to relax your heart. But first, I want you to undergo this tribulation and borrow its power to fully awaken your seven-color Supreme Blood,” said Long Zhantian.

“My seven-color Supreme Blood isn’t fully awakened yet?” asked Long Chen in surprise.

“The Long clan is full of fools. They thought that primal chaos qi and the nourishment of the laws of the Heavenly Daos were enough to awaken seven-color Supreme Blood. In truth, seven-color Supreme Blood is one of the human race’s strongest bloodlines. It is so powerful that the Heavenly Daos are envious of it, so how could it be so easily awakened?” Long Zhantian smiled slightly. He sneered at the Long clan as they truly didn’t understand the Supreme Blood.

Just then, seven-color lightning rained down from the heavens, transforming into sharp swords. They struck the divine radiance around Long Zhantian and shattered, transforming into lightning runes.

As for Long Chen, he simply allowed them to strike him. These swords that could practically wipe out a Mortal Venerate were simply an itch to Long Chen.

“Your physical body is really terrifying,” said Long Zhantian in amazement. These swords contained a terrifying law power, and Long Zhantian required the Supreme Blood shield to block them. However, Long Chen could simply ignore them.

As time passed, more and more of the swords appeared, and they grew stronger. They were so sharp that they sliced through the void.

“The lightning at the start contains some impurities, so absorbing it isn’t very meaningful. But in a bit, the lightning swords’ energy will become purer. At that time, we don’t need to resist. Just allow the lightning swords to pierce our bodies and we will use the heavenly tribulation as a vector. Now, I will transmit my understanding of the seven-color Supreme Blood to you. During my years of imprisonment, I had no other option but to focus on studying this blood. I have nothing else for you, so count this as my first gift to you!” Long Zhantian smiled.

The seven-colored lightning swords intensified in power, growing sharper by the moment. As a result, Long Zhantian's protective shield was gradually losing its effectiveness. Several lightning swords managed to breach his defenses and struck him.

However, his expression didn’t change. He had employed the shield primarily to assess the lightning's strength and was patiently awaiting the ideal moment to absorb the pure lightning.

Even though these lightning swords were piercing his shield, they were incapable of piercing through Long Chen’s skin, simply shattering on contact with him.

Long Chen wasn’t even defending and only felt the slightest bit of discomfort, as if sand was brushing against his skin. 

“Dad…”

Long Chen felt a bit embarrassed as Long Zhantian stared at him. His physical body was now so powerful that this level of lightning was unable to harm him.

Long Zhantian laughed. “Don’t worry, everything is under control. Your physical body really is beyond my expectations. It just so happens that I theorized a powerful technique during my years in the Long clan, but my own physical body was too limited. I thought that I would have no hope of putting the technique into practice in this lifetime, but now, I feel like this technique was made for you. Little fellow, you really are worthy of being my son, hahaha!”

Long Zhantian’s laughter resonated like thunder, full of delight. Long Chen’s physical body was several times stronger than he had predicted.

Just as the two were speaking, the tribulation clouds in the sky slowly shrank. After being compressed, their lightning swords were finally able to break through Long Chen’s skin, and seven-color lightning began to flow into Long Chen.

The moment this lightning entered him, Long Chen’s seven-color Supreme Blood started to boil.

“Chen-er, focus on your spirit and qi. Draw your Supreme Blood to the spirit platform.” Long Zhantian gave instructions at this time, his expression solemn. He began to rapidly form hand seals.

The next moment, a pillar of seven-color divine light burst out of Long Zhantian, striking the heavenly tribulation.
