Chapter 3830 Dead and Reborn?

“How can that be?!”

Everyone was shocked.

“The mechanism I left behind was triggered. Someone has definitely come in after us. Wait, there's more than one,” said Mo Nian.

“Then what do we do? Kill them?” asked Guo Ran.

Long Chen shook his head. “For them to be able to enter, they cannot be ordinary. They are either powerful or have several treasures that allow them to enter. We can discuss things after they arrive here. Perhaps we can have them be the vanguard and tidy up these evil corpses for us.”

“That’s not a bad idea. It’s about what I was thinking,” said Mo Nian sinisterly.

“But this channel is just one straight path. There’s nowhere for us to hide,” said Guo Ran.

“Hehe, just leave that to me, a master archeologist!” Mo Nian laughed and took out a flying shuttle. Everyone jumped in shock.

This flying shuttle was ten meters long and looked like a small flying boat. But when its runes activated, Mo Nian vanished behind it.

They looked through the shuttle and could see everything behind it. But they couldn’t see Mo Nian. When he entered the shuttle, his entire aura and existence vanished from sense.

“Hehe, without this little bit of ability, how could I go out into the world? Come, get in the flying shuttle, and we’ll wait for them,” said Mo Nian.

They then hopped into it. Mo Nian had the shuttle press against the wall. From the outside, it was impossible to see it. This flying shuttle was one of Mo Nian’s most cherished treasures. It was what he had relied on to escape from countless sure-death situations.

However, it wasn’t a fighting divine item. It could only be used to hide and flee, so Mo Nian rarely used it for fear of it being damaged. The materials it was made of were very special. Once broken, there was no way to repair it.

“What are you entering for?” Seeing the Vajra Blood Bat enter as well as the other lifeforms of the Ghost Dao, Xia Chen couldn’t help asking.

“If they want to come in, then let them. Perhaps these newcomers are also capable of sensing Ghost Dao lifeforms if they’re capable of reaching this place. Shh, they’re here. Don’t make a sound or communicate with divine sense,” said Mo Nian.

The next moment, they stopped their breathing and did not make a single sound. Those Ghost Dao lifeforms also obediently sat there watching.

The sound of footsteps rang out. Mo Nian was correct. It wasn’t just one person. In fact, based on the footsteps, there were thousands.

“The devil race!”

Once they got closer, Long Chen and the others recognized them. These people were all Supreme experts with overflowing devil qi.

Their leader was a withered monkey-like existence with arms going past its knees. There was an evil light in its eyes as its gaze swept through the darkness.

When they saw this monkey, Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian were completely shocked.

“Shi Yang!”

This name leaped into their minds. The fluctuations of this person’s aura were the exact same as Shi Yang’s.

It wasn’t just Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian who noticed. Even Mo Nian, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen noticed something off even though they hadn’t directly fought Shi Yang. They were all shocked.

Was Shi Yang not slain by Long Chen? His corpse was blown out of existence, so just who was this person who possessed the same aura as Shi Yang? They stared in disbelief. Was Shi Yang not dead? Had he returned from the grave with another corpse?

“Where are they? Everyone, search! They’re definitely hiding nearby,” ordered a devil expert.

The monkey-like man shook his head. “No need. They fled.”

Hearing that monkey’s voice, Long Chen and the others were even more sure now. This person was Shi Yang. Although his voice was different from before, his inflection was the exact same.

Shi Yang squatted and rubbed a patch of dirt with his withered hand. He sniffed it and said, “These are the vestiges left behind after a transportation talisman is activated. They’re quite crafty. They knew they weren’t a match for us, so they chose to immediately flee.”

These marks were intentionally left behind by Xia Chen to give the pursuers the impression that they had left.

“But this is the heavenly tomb! How could they use spatial transportation here?”

“They have a powerful formation master with them, so they definitely have their own methods. After all, there’s nowhere to hide here. Most importantly, that woman from the original devil race came with them, and we followed them here by tracing her aura. Now that her aura has vanished, we can’t sense even the slightest trace of it. That is the greatest proof that they’ve left. Fuck, how infuriating. They actually ran.” Shi Yang clenched his teeth.

“That really is a pity. Having destroyed your main fighting corpse body, they cannot be forgiven. If they didn’t run, you’d definitely annihilate them,” said that devil expert extremely respectfully.

“It really was dangerous last time. If that guy hadn’t torn through the wall of the heavens and brought out primal chaos qi, I’d have really died. But I also profited from that setback. My soul was nourished by primal chaos qi, allowing me to reach the seventh level of the Corpse Devil Grand Technique. Even though I am now using this corpse, I am even stronger than I was back then. It’s just a shame that he’s so crafty and has run. But it’s fine. Next time I see him, I’ll personally tear him into pieces,” said Shi Yang hatefully. Although he was comforting himself with these words, he still felt very regretful.

Hearing this, Long Chen and the others understood. So it was the primal chaos qi that had saved him. The corpse devil race’s divine abilities were truly frightening. Long Chen didn’t even sense it at all back then. Otherwise, he’d have completely erased this damned existence.

These pursuers were searching the area, and one of them had even come very close to the flying shuttle. Guo Ran’s heart clenched tightly. But Shi Yang’s words caused them to give up on searching.

The main thing was that this place was one simple channel with nothing blocking their line of sight. There was nowhere to hide. Adding on Shi Yang’s immense confidence that Long Chen had directly fled, they gave up on searching.

In truth, even if they hadn’t given up, they wouldn’t have found the flying shuttle. This was one of Mo Nian’s greatest life-saving trump cards. It could silently move while being untraceable.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, Guo Ran and the others didn’t know that, which was why they were nervous. But Mo Nian wasn’t afraid at all. He might not brag about his other abilities, but when it came to saving his own life, he was unrivaled. Otherwise, he’d have long since been beaten to death by others for what he had done to their ancestors’ graves.

Shi Yang and the others gave up on searching. After that, they directly ordered a group of a dozen experts to probe the path ahead. Those people had just gone deeper when they heard a few muffled sounds, and they came back, dragging a few collapsed corpses with them.

“What? What did they do?!”

Long Chen and the others were dumbfounded, not daring to believe their eyes.
