Chapter 2903 Forced into a Disadvantage

“They really did come prepared. Everything is going according to Chu Kuang’s plan.” Luo Bing’s heart clenched when she saw Long Chen be sent out.

Chu Kuang was truly sinister. He viewed this competition as something that he had to win, so he was pulling out all the stops.

Even with the lightning wings, Long Chen couldn’t fly, so he needed some time to catch up to them. Luckily, as he had put in his jade plate first, the pressure on Mu Qingyun and the others lessened, allowing them to advance much faster than before. As for Chu Kuang and the others, they were already igniting the lamps.

Suddenly, space shuddered. Chu Kuang, Gu Fei, Tang Yaochen, Li Chengbei, Xiang Kejie, Yang Fang, and the others managed to ignite two lamps at once with their combined efforts.

Once those lamps were ignited, the mist covering Chu Kuang’s side mostly faded.

After that, Tang Yaochen took out a formation disc and placed it on the ground. A pillar of light then shot out of it.

“Have they gone insane?! They wasted eight million immortal crystals for a temporary transportation formation disc in this competition?! Are they all money wasters?!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This formation disc in Tang Yaochen’s hands was a small-scale formation that cost an enormous sum. It could be set up anywhere and was usually used on the battlefield for sudden attacks or fleeing. To use it in this competition was practically a waste of a treasure.

As the light grew brighter and brighter, the other disciples of the Prime Glory Alliance who had been left behind crushed the talismans in their hands. They were then enveloped by light and transported to this light pillar.

Over four hundred people were instantly brought to the flag, and this scene infuriated all the spectating disciples.

“Cheating, absolutely flagrant cheating!”

“What is the point of competing?! All the opportunities will be left to those with money! Should people without money just starve to death!?”

“That’s right! They’re already born with more opportunities than others. Now, they won’t even give others a chance? What is the point of me cultivating in this academy?! To be an extra for those with money?!”

“Hey, bad Chu person, you’re all trash! From top to bottom, there’s not a single good person in your Chu family!” Luo Ning directly cursed Chu Huairen. However, her voice was drowned out by the endless cursing of the others.

All the disciples were inflamed and cursing. As they cursed, they grew more brazen with their cursing until some were directly cursing Chu Huairen.

“Shut up! Rules are rules! As long as Chu Kuang doesn’t break the rules of the academy, it doesn’t count as cheating. You poor beggars, do you think you’re qualified to make such a clamor?! You are fated to only be extras for the main characters!” shouted the magistrate beside Chu Huairen, his voice like thunder shaking these disciples’ ears. For a while, they couldn’t hear anything, and the plaza descended into silence.

These disciples were suppressed, but their eyes were full of rage. As they couldn’t curse with their mouths, they did it with their hearts.

The head judge suddenly shouted, “You’re the one who should shut up. Everyone within the academy is equal. Although the rules are not perfect and some people can take advantage of them, all disciples have a right to fight for their own opportunities. Some disciples are more privileged than others, but opportunities are available to every disciple as long as the disciples fight for them. I am also born from commoners, and neither of my parents was a cultivator. I almost starved to death on the streets as a child, but I still reached this point. Are you saying that I am also just an extra for the two of you?”

The head judge’s voice was full of dignity and righteous indignation as he shouted to that magistrate.

Hearing this, the disciples exploded in thunderous cheering. The head judge had essentially slapped that magistrate in the face.

“Head judge, this lowly one was rambling foolishly. I ask that you forgive me. I apologize to you in front of everyone,” said that magistrate. His head had grown hot, which was the only reason he had said such foolish words. As soon as he said them, he knew he had done the wrong thing. But he couldn’t take them back once they were out. Having so many disciples cursing him had flustered him.

“Giving an apology now is useless. Do you think this is like the trial hall where you apologized to Long Chen? You are one of the three leaders of the Discipline Institute, the very representation of the academy’s laws. However, you are an extremist who openly expresses views that harm our disciples. I will report this to the institute head and have him deal with you. Just wait for the result,” said the head judge coldly.

Although his expression was cold, he was actually delighted inside. That magistrate had actually said something so foolish. Now he was doomed. At the very least, he wouldn’t be able to maintain his position after this.

The head judge then turned to the disciples. “The Discipline Institute’s laws are all just. The rules are fair. But remember, even though sunlight warms this entire world, there are also shadows that it can’t reach. Don’t question the entire world just because you stare into the shadows. All experts are tempered through adversity. As for those so-called geniuses made by throwing resources at them, in the end, they always become whetstones for others. They aren’t anything enviable. There is no need for you to be indignant or undervalue yourself. Just look at those black robes in front of you. Do you not understand?”

“The black robes?”

Startled, the disciples looked at Long Chen and instantly understood what the head judge was saying.

Didn’t Long Chen also start with nothing? He came to the academy without the money to even apply. But from the path of a worker with no background or resources, he still rose in the academy.

Just how amazing was Chu Kuang’s background? But against Long Chen, he still needed to buy so many people and waste so much money. Why was that? Wasn’t it precisely because he was afraid of losing?

Someone with no background or money could force someone like Chu Kuang to be this afraid. That was already proof that family background didn’t decide future accomplishments.

Because of this, the disciples felt much better and looked toward the head judge with respect and gratitude. However, when they looked at Chu Huairen and the other magistrate, their eyes were full of scorn. Both of those two old fellows had wasted their years.

“Mu Qingyun has arrived!” Luo Bing suddenly cried out. She saw Mu Qingyun taking the lead in attacking the Prime Glory Alliance.
