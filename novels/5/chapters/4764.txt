Chapter 4753 First Step Towards the Sovereign Emperor Heaven

Looking where Bai Xiaole was pointing, Long Chen saw a group of familiar faces: the experts from the Long clan who had previously visited the academy.

At the forefront stood Long Xihe, radiating a commanding presence. Even his accompanying disciples exuded an air of confidence, as if they were unparalleled beings.

To Long Chen's surprise, Long Xihe's group truly stood out, boasting a staggering ten million members.

As Long Chen locked eyes with them, they reciprocated the gaze. At this moment, a sharp glint flickered in Long Xihe's eyes. Pretending not to notice Long Chen, he smoothly continued forward.

It seemed that Long Xihe was quite something. Despite Long Chen’s influential speech, he relied on his eloquence, coupled with the reputation of the Heavenly Desolate Long clan, to sway millions of experts to join their cause.

After all, the Heavenly Desolation Long clan could definitely be classified as an authority figure within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. With that kind of advantage, it was only natural for him to be able to recruit many people.

As they flew by, Long Chen detected a few gazes tinged with unmistakable hostility. He narrowed his eyes, alert to the potential threat lurking within their midst. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Boss, just give the order and I’ll kill these blind motherfuckers,” said Guo Ran. He and the others could also sense their killing intent.

Aware that the Heavenly Desolate Long clan would seek out the Long clan’s bloodline in this world, Long Chen and his companions recognized the hostile gazes directed at him. They belonged to the branch of the Long clan responsible for imprisoning Long Zhantian.

The enmity between Long Chen and the Long clan ran deep, but out of respect for his father's wishes, Long Chen refrained from exterminating them.

At this moment, they believed that their social standing was above Long Chen’s, looking as if they could easily squash him like a bug, fueling the rage of the Dragonblood warriors.

After all, they were merely ants in front of the Dragonblood warriors, easily squashed beneath their feet. Even Long Xihe would be powerless to protect them.

“It’s alright. I made a promise to my dad that as long as they don't initiate the attack, I won't strike them first,” Long Chen replied, shaking his head. In truth, he wanted to kill them more than anyone could imagine. After all, the sins they had committed against him and his father were unforgivable. However, betraying his father’s wishes was not something Long Chen could do.

“How enraging. Is there really nothing we can do to them?” Guo Ran gritted his teeth in frustration.

“There will be a time for action, but the opportunity hasn’t presented itself yet,” responded Long Chen with a slight smile.

“Boss, what do you mean?” asked Guo Ran, his curiosity piqued.

“Well, you know they want me dead. Once we arrive in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, they’ll definitely find ways to cause trouble for me. If I catch them red-handed, I can slaughter them all, and my father can’t blame me,” replied Long Chen.

In the end, Long Chen wasn't a saint. His philosophy was to repay kindness and seek vengeance for enmities. If there was a debt owed, it had to be repaid.

In truth, the animosity between Long Chen and the Long clan never ceased. Long Chen had actually been vigilantly monitoring the Long clan’s activities, hoping for an opportunity to catch them in the act.

Unfortunately, he had yet to catch them red-handed. Nonetheless, he patiently observed them, waiting for a chance to rip them out by the roots.

“Tch, showing mercy isn’t your style. If we were in the Martial Heaven Continent, you’d have long since dealt with people like them,” remarked Evilmoon disdainfully. It was like this fellow wouldn’t be able to rest without mocking Long Chen a bit.

“What do you know? My father and I suffered so much. After finally reuniting after so long, how could I defy his wishes?” Long Chen retorted irritably. "Furthermore, while I’m sure one aspect is that my father doesn’t want to cut off his connection to the Long clan, I believe the main reason he stopped me from killing them is because he doesn’t want me to carry the name of a sinner who slays his ancestors."

Evilmoon had become increasingly bloodthirsty, likely due to consuming numerous dragon souls. It persistently urged Long Chen to shed more blood, but Long Chen refused to yield to its influence.

As they pressed forward, they eventually found themselves standing right in front of the gate, arriving without even realizing it.

This gate was different from ordinary spatial gates, so large that it soared beyond the clouds. Divine light was shining from the cracks in the door, which was opening inwards as if welcoming them.

When someone got close to it, the light would flicker, and some kind of booming sound would explode from within it.

Long Chen and the others felt no urgency to enter. Instead, they stood still, collectively turning to gaze into the distance where their family was: the place where their roots lay and where countless memories were forged.

Stepping through this door meant entering a new realm—a world of potential marvels, but also potentially fraught with turmoil and conflict. Once they stepped in, they might never see their friends and family ever again. This one look back was like their final goodbye to this world.

Then, Long Chen waved his hand and charged into the gate to the ninth heaven alongside all of them. As they crossed the threshold, they were met with a powerful blast of dense spiritual qi and the imposing laws of the Heavenly Daos.

Their pores opened wide, greedily absorbing the aura of this new world. It was instinctual, akin to vegetation in a desert finally receiving the water it desperately craved. Their instincts were instantly awakened.

“Heavens, living here, you don’t even need to cultivate and your cultivation speed would be countless times faster than outside!” cried out someone excitedly.

“As expected of the strongest heaven of the nine heavens! This is the true paradise for cultivators.”

People started to talk excitedly, including Long Chen and the others. After all, the stronger a person was, the more they felt that thirst.

Long Chen felt his dragon blood surging within him, stirred to life by the potent aura surrounding them. Both his dormant violet blood and seven-color Supreme Blood were roused by the aura of this realm.

Long Chen was like a parched fish returning to the sea. It was such an indescribable feeling.

As they ventured further into the channel of primal chaos, the spiritual qi grew denser with each step. The world ahead gradually came into focus.

However, before they even got a clear look at the world ahead of them, the smell of blood struck them. Soon, the sounds of screams and roars pierced the air.

BOOM!

A sharp claw slammed toward Long Chen and the others.
