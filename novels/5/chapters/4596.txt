Chapter 4585 No Need to Give Me Face

When black qi swirled around Netherdragon Tianzhao, an Emperor’s pressure crashed down as if the Nether Emperor had descended. It was as if the entire world could crumble in front of that pressure.

“You little ant, do you finally comprehend the power disparity between us?” Netherdragon Tianzhao’s voice thundered with an ancient and weighty aura, resonating through the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest with overwhelming power.

Pointing his spear at Long Chen, Netherdragon Tianzhao emitted a sharp killing intent that instantly locked him down.

“This is your final chance. If you still don’t take out the Heaven Earth Cauldron, you won’t have another chance.”

Long Chen felt his soul shuddering in front of this killing intent. Due to his powerful soul and will, not many people could lock him down, especially someone in the same realm.

However, this time, he sensed the Nether Emperor’s will in this lock, along with something strange.

“Hahahaha!”

Long Chen suddenly raised his head and laughed.

“Have you lost your mind in the face of imminent death?” sneered Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Long Chen chuckled in response. “If I were to die, how would you explain yourself to the Nether Emperor?”

“What are you talking about?!”

Long Chen replied, “If my guess is correct, when you sacrificed yourself to the Nether Emperor, you should have perished. Those trials you supposedly passed were likely just the bare minimum. So, what really moved the Nether Emperor wasn’t your talent or your willpower but the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Did you pledge to surrender the Heaven Earth Cauldron to him in exchange for your life? Is that why the Nether Emperor is supporting you? No wonder you’re so eager for me to reveal the Heaven Earth Cauldron. It seems that if you can't obtain it, the consequences will be severe!”

Long Chen had gotten suspicious when Netherdragon Tianzhao repeatedly urged him to take out the Earth Cauldron. As he spoke, he observed Netherdragon Tianzhao’s expression change several times. Even if his guess wasn’t entirely accurate, it probably wasn’t that far off.

“What a bunch of nonsense. I am the Nether Emperor’s son. If I want to use the Nether Emperor’s power, I must give him something in return. If you’re going to be so stupid, don’t blame me when I don’t give you a chance to use the Heaven Earth Cauldron!” roared Netherdragon Tianzhao.

BOOM!

When the Nether Emperor’s power flowed into his spear, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest stopped quivering, and the entire world became still.

Long Chen put away his damaged saber. After all, it could no longer contain his astral energy, so he decided not to use it anymore.

With his hands clasped behind his back, Long Chen seemed to give up on resisting, catching Netherdragon Tianzhao by surprise. In his confusion, he actually retracted half the power of his spear, but even half could deal a grievous wound to Long Chen if he didn’t wield any weapon.

“You really dared to say such big words. Before I take out the Heaven Earth Cauldron, you don’t have the guts to kill me,” sneered Long Chen. Netherdragon Tianzhao’s actions now proved his guess.

“Die!” Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, thrusting his spear at Long Chen with unbridled fury. Long Chen’s words had struck a nerve; they were all true. When he offered himself to the Nether Emperor, he had pleaded for a second chance, and the Nether Emperor had granted it.

However, there was a condition attached: he had to retrieve the cauldron Long Chen had used, the very one that had broken his weapon. It was then that Netherdragon Tianzhao realized that this cauldron was an item that could even sway the Nether Emperor. Perhaps it was indeed the Heaven Earth Cauldron, one of the ten great primal chaos divine items.

After passing the Nether Emperor’s trials, he obtained supreme divine energy, propelling him from a three-star Doyen to a nine-star Doyen. Additionally, he gained the power of the Nether Emperor, which elevated his strength to a level even he feared.

He understood that this was all bestowed upon him by the Nether Emperor. If he couldn’t fulfill the mission the Nether Emperor would not just take it all back; he would ensure Netherdragon Tianzhao suffered a life worse than death.

This was a secret that no one else knew other than himself and the Nether Emperor. However, Long Chen had actually guessed it, causing Netherdragon Tianzhao to feel both afraid and angry.

When a person’s secrets were figured out by others, they would naturally become nervous. Netherdragon Tianzhao’s face twisted with savagery as his spear pierced toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosive sound resonated through the air. Netherdragon Tianzhao's arms shook, going numb as his spear flew out of his grasp. Feeling startled, he flew back to retrieve his weapon, only to find Long Chen shielded by a giant lightning shield. Millions of lightning runes formed defensive layers on top of the shield, and behind it stood a beautiful maiden.

“Inferior human. Do you only rely on external power to survive?” shouted Netherdragon Tianzhao, shocked by this lightning spirit. He knew that Long Chen had one, but he had not expected it to have grown to this level.

According to reason, as a lightning spirit made of the world’s wild lightning, Lei Linger should be unwilling to submit to anyone. So, as her master, Long Chen shouldn’t have allowed her to grow stronger than himself, as the risks of a backlash were far too high.

However, Lei Linger now had a Saint’s aura around her, and her thunderforce was so intense that it almost made Netherdragon Tianzhao spit out blood. How could he not be shocked?

“External power? What a joke. Does your dragon spear not count as one? Does the Nether Emperor’s power not count as one? Oh, let’s not talk about your Heavenly Doyen power. Do you not know where it comes from? Can you please use your brain before speaking?” sneered Long Chen.

“Hmph, even if you use external power, it’s useless! A little lightning spirit isn’t worth anything in front of me!” roared Netherdragon Tianzhao, and he attacked once more.

“Really?” taunted Long Chen. He then smiled and looked at Lei Linger. “Remember how you always complained that I wouldn’t let you go all-out? Now’s your chance. Don’t give me face, and just go all-out!”

“In that case, Big Brother Long Chen, you should get back and protect yourself!”

Lei Linger smiled, but there was a harsh light in her eyes. Her violet hair started to flutter without a breeze, mirroring the sway of her dress. Within her gaze, a lightning rune materialized, but it was not alone; chains tightly bound its power. Long Chen’s breath caught in his throat at the sight.

“A seal!”

Long Chen hadn’t expected Lei Linger to seal her own power like this. When he realized this, he immediately shot back.

Just then, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s dragon spear pierced toward her with supreme divine energy, only for Lei Linger to catch it in her small hand.

Yet, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s power was unyielding, pushing Lei Linger further and further back. Her feet left a long ditch in the ground. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Saint lightning seal, release!” she bellowed, and the chains binding the rune within her eyes rattled ominously. In a burst of raw energy, untamed lightning erupted forth like a volcanic eruption.
