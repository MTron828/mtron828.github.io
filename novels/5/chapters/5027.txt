Chapter 5016 Let Him Live, Or Die?

Long Chen stood calmly at the center of the martial stage as the sword flew uncontrollably toward his throat with alarming accuracy. Many doubted it was accidental.

Not in a combat-ready state, Long Chen faced the swift attack imbued with the full power of a Heavenly Chosen. Yu Ying and others watched in horror, even forgetting how to cry out.

When the sword was three inches away from Long Chen’s throat, it came to a sudden stop, not budging in the slightest. Covered in thin scales, Long Chen’s two fingers gripped the blade, neutralizing its deadly might.

The spectators, including Long Tianrui, were shocked by his composed response. He seemed to have anticipated this.

This battle had been like a torrential storm, and the likes of Long Tianrui, Jiang Wuwang, and Feng Fei could tell that this incident was actually an unintended slip. However, it was still within Long Chen’s expectations, a testament that his ability to judge the situation was nothing short of astounding.

Most frightening of all, Long Chen hadn’t unleashed any aura or the slightest Blood Qi fluctuation. With just two fingers, he had intercepted the full power of a Heavenly Chosen. It was a simple move that challenged the limits of people’s understanding.

As a result, countless experts gasped in disbelief. Those who had doubted his abilities were now forced to acknowledge that he truly possessed the power to be the head umpire.

The two combatants were stunned by the scene before them. The disciple who redirected the attack was profoundly aware of the power behind it, as he had to use his full power to block that sword. Yet, Long Chen stopped it with just two fingers, leaving him bewildered.

His opponent, on the other hand, was too shocked to speak. As his sword veered toward Long Chen, he sensed something wrong and tried to stop it, but couldn’t. While he didn’t care about Long Chen’s, he was worried his opponent might exploit this opening.

When Long Chen’s fingers caught the sword, its immense power dissipated like a clay ox vanishing into the sea. The overwhelming force disappeared without a trace.

Outwardly, Long Chen’s expression remained indifferent. Inside, however, he was roaring with gratitude, silently thanking the Earth Cauldron and the God Slaying Cross.

Ever since Long Chen started cultivating the God Slaying Cross, the monstrous difficulty had elevated his control over his power to an entirely new level. Previously, he could have blocked the Heavenly Chosen’s sword with ease, but he wouldn’t have been able to catch it silently, without causing any ripples.

Through cultivating the Dragon Blood God Slaying Cross, Long Chen had unknowingly made significant gains. Even without actively using the God Slaying Cross, his power had risen.

After a moment of delight, he looked at one of the disciples indifferently and flicked his two fingers.

The sword quivered, and the disciple grunted as he staggered back a few steps before stabilizing himself. His expression changed drastically. That light flick had left his arm numb, and he almost dropped his sword. His chest ached, and he nearly coughed up blood.

“You’ve lost,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“What nonsense! How have I lost?! I still have many moves I haven’t unleashed!” raged that disciple.

Long Chen replied, “The two of you are evenly matched, but you lack experience. In terms of technique, you also are not as precise as your opponent. That’s why he was able to control his moves while you lost control. Don’t be stubborn. This is the difference. Between experts, the slightest detail can determine victory or defeat. If I wasn’t here, the battle could last hours. Who has that much time to waste? Be open-minded and accept it. Or be close-minded and still accept it. Anyway, I am the boss of this martial stage. If you disagree, you can send a complaint letter. But if you start shouting at me here, be careful—I might slap you.”

After saying that, Long Chen waved his scepter and transported both combatants out. One of their tablets brightened, while the other went dim.

The sword-wielding disciple, still stubborn, returned to his seat and shouted a challenge at his opponent, demanding a private battle.

His opponent ignored him, which only fueled his rage. Just as he was about to cause a further commotion, Zhao Qingtian knocked him to the ground. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Shut your mouth. A loss is a loss. Your technique was inferior, and now you want to get your way by cursing like a vixen? You’re bringing shame to the Zhao clan,” scolded Zhao Qingtian.

The losing disciple was from the Zhao clan. The likes of Zhao Qingtian and Long Tianrui could indeed tell that he was slightly inferior to his opponent.

As Long Chen had pointed out, their battle would have dragged on for hours before a clear victor emerged. Such a prolonged fight would be tedious, so Long Chen’s quick decision as the head umpire was completely within reason.

If this disciple was really unconvinced of his defeat, he could file a complaint to his clan leader. But he couldn’t shout and make a fuss here, as it would just embarrass the Zhao clan.

After being slapped by Zhao Qingtian, that disciple fell silent. Despite being fellow Heavenly Chosens, he didn’t dare to defy Zhao Qingtian, an expert sealed from the ancient era. Hence, this disciple could only shut his mouth and sit down.

At this moment, Long Chen appeared on the second martial stage. Just as before, he gave the same nonsensical speech before activating the martial stage.

As the battle started, the two disciples erupted into combat, drawing the attention of every expert watching.

Meanwhile, in an underground palace, the four clan leaders were gathered, watching the events unfold through a mirror.

“Long Chen is definitely a monster. No wonder Long Tianrui views him so highly,” said the Jiang clan leader.

The Jiang clan leader also recalled what Feng Fei had told him. She had said that the most monstrous fellow in this world was Long Chen, and that all so-called geniuses were dregs in front of him. The Jiang clan leader hadn’t believed it before, but now, after witnessing that one simple move, he was convinced.

“No matter how strong he is, he can’t surpass Zhao Qingtian,” the Zhao clan leader said stubbornly.

“I feel like Ye Lingxiao can also defeat him,” the Ye clan leader added, extremely confident.

The Jiang clan leader couldn’t help but frown. All he had said was that Long Chen’s power wasn’t bad. Why were they suddenly targeting him? Just as he was about to respond, the Long clan leader hastily interrupted.

“Don’t talk nonsense. Today, we have to decide how to deal with Long Chen. Do we let him live or...?”

The expressions of the other clan leaders instantly turned serious.
