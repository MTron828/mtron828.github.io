Chapter 4075 Crushing Weaklings?

The Ninth Elder fought alongside the two Elders of the Ye clan against Uncle Tree, but due to his injuries, he couldn’t contribute much.

Since his injuries hadn’t recovered yet, he was unable to fully control the power of the Heavenly Daos, so his combat power was only seventy percent of his peak. In this state, it was very difficult for him to cause any substantial injury to Uncle Tree.

Enraged by this, he decided to cast his fury upon Long Chen and the others, knowing that if he attacked Long Chen, Uncle Tree would be forced to save him. Then they would have the initiative over this battle.

At this moment, the Ninth Elder’s sword slashed down toward Long Chen.

“Divine ring, Dragon King Battle Armor!”

As Long Chen’s roar resounded throughout the world, his divine ring and battle armor manifested, their berserk Blood Qi energy blasting apart the clouds.

The Minghong Saber also flew out of its sheath and slashed out like a heavenly blade. When it appeared, the river of stars quivered, and an unmatched killing intent locked onto the Ninth Elder.

The Ninth Elder had never dreamed that a little Immortal King could unleash such power, to the extent that this saber actually gave him a sense of pressure.

BOOM!

The impact caused heaven and earth to tremble, blowing Long Chen and the Ninth Elder back. In this exchange, the two were evenly matched.

“What?!” The Ninth Elder was stunned. His Blood Qi was flipping inside of him, but Long Chen seemed fine.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Just as the Ninth Elder was knocked back, Guo Ran attacked, his crossed sabers containing the power of all the Dragonblood warriors behind him. As their scales lit up, their Blood Qi energy poured toward Guo Ran.

When all their energy gathered on him, Guo Ran’s armor and sabers blazed like the sun, looking like they were red-hot.

The Dragonblood warriors had continuously cultivated during their journey this time, so when all their power was gathered, it was almost beyond the limit of Guo Ran’s armor and blades.

When Guo Ran couldn’t hold it anymore, a giant cross-shaped attack shot out precisely at the Ninth Elder.

Having just been blown back by Long Chen, the Ninth Elder couldn’t put on any defenses against this attack. Enraged, he spat out blood, which then ignited and caused his aura to leap to a new level.

In this state, he had no choice but to ignite his essence blood for some breathing room. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to survive.

The Ninth Elder’s sword then slashed onto the blazing cross. But he was taken aback as his sword shattered upon impact, and a tremendous force slammed into his chest, sending forth a spray of blood from his mouth. The sensation was akin to being struck by a star, leaving him on the brink of collapse.

“Brothers, good work!” Guo Ran exclaimed in delight. Last time, their Dragonblood Cross Slash hadn’t managed to have such an impact.

Unable to accept that fact, they had been constantly training. As a result, not only did their cultivation bases go up, but their cooperation was also honed, and their energy transfer efficiency was optimized as well. Now, their combined force was even stronger than Long Chen’s previous attack.

This finally allowed Guo Ran to feel like he had vented a bit from their last defeat. Taking advantage of this, he shot after the elder.

However, just as he raised his sabers, he noticed a light smoke coming from his blades, their runes still burning. Hence, his expression changed slightly. “Crap, the runes have reached their limit. I’ll have to wait a bit before unleashing a second attack.”

The combined power of the Dragonblood warriors now brought a heavy burden on Guo Ran’s battle armor and sabers, hindering his ability to unleash successive attacks. It was because some of the runes of the blades were allocated as conduits for channeling the power of the Dragonblood warriors, while the larger portion was reserved for when he fought on his own. It was a pragmatic approach though, considering that he couldn't always be with the other Dragonblood warriors, as they frequently found themselves engaged in separate battles.

With this in mind, Guo Ran had set up his runes with a high estimation of how much power the Dragonblood warriors could provide him. He had also thought that there was no need for further modifications before reaching the Divine Venerate realm, but now, the runes had reached their limit even before they got to the World King realm.

Moreover, it had to be known that they only had over four hundred Dragonblood warriors here. Once they were all gathered, their combined power would cause his armor and sabers to explode if he were to gather it all.

Guo Ran was startled and surprised by this. If he were to strengthen his equipment again and all his brothers were gathered, their power could eclipse Long Chen’s for one instant.

“Die!”

Just as these thoughts ran through his head, the Ninth Elder roared. The latter was now covered in blood, with his clothes tattered and his hair in a mess, looking like a beggar.

However, his expression was very frightening now. He had come to crush a few weaklings, but somehow ended up encountering hard boulders.

Guo Ran’s attack had damaged his internal organs, causing the internal wounds caused by Uncle Tree to flare up again. However, he could also see the smoke coming from Guo Ran’s armor and sabers. So, he knew that this was his best chance to kill Guo Ran.

Even though the Ninth Elder was severely injured, he didn’t wish to give up on this good chance. After all, Long Chen was too far to save Guo Ran.

“Die!” The Ninth Elder’s sword had been shattered, so he took out a spear.

However, just as he pierced his weapon toward Guo Ran, the void collapsed and rainbow flames materialized, manifesting a vortex of flames in front of him.

Although Yu Qingxuan didn’t like combat, in terms of defense, she possessed immense might. Moreover, it was so great that the Ninth Elder’s attack was unable to penetrate her defenses.

When his spear touched the flame vortex, the spear’s concentrated power was like molten iron landing in ice; all its power rapidly dissipated.

“Slut!” The Ninth Elder roared in fury after his attack was blocked by Yu Qingxuan. She had caused him to miss his best chance at killing Guo Ran.

Just as he cursed her, he suddenly saw Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the rest of the Dragonblood warriors looking at him with an odd look. That look seemed to contain pity for him.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Following that, he felt a pair of fiendish eyes behind him, and the temperature plummeted.

The entire world seemed to hush, leaving only the sound of his own heartbeat reverberating in the stillness.

When he slowly turned his head, his gaze fell upon Long Chen, who had resheathed his saber. Leaning forward akin to a leopard ready to strike, Long Chen exuded an icy aura of murderous intent that caused the world to quiver.
