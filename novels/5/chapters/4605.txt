Chapter 4594 Forcibly Switching Blood

At the heart of this Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was a sea of magma, but it was different from the magma in the passageway, as it was like a calm lake.

Without terrifying heat and wild qi waves, it was a calm world of red. Above the calm magma was a red dragon scale.

When Long Chen saw this red dragon scale, his heart started to pound wildly to the extent that he could no longer hear anything else. All he could hear was his heartbeat.

His heartbeat quickened, sounding like a thunderous drum in his ears. Long Chen could feel the red dragon scale’s beating along with him.

At first, Long Chen only felt his blood heating up. However, as his heartbeat quickened, Long Chen had a bad feeling. With every beat, Long Chen felt like a volcano was erupting inside of him, and his vision flickered.

All of a sudden, Long Chen vomited a mouthful of blood, his shock intensifying as he noticed its rainbow hues.

A tinge of fear crept into his eyes as a troubling realization dawned upon him.

Following that, he spat out another mouthful of blood. This time, it was his violet blood. Long Chen realized with dread that the Sovereign scale was forcibly expelling his core essence blood.

In other words, this Sovereign scale was so domineering that it wanted to forcibly switch out his blood until only dragon blood remained.

“Senior, you can’t do this!” shouted Long Chen.

BOOM!

In a sudden eruption, blood sprayed from Long Chen’s mouth as his heart could no longer withstand the pressure and exploded.

As his heart shattered, blood-colored light rose out of the lake of magma. Countless beams of light converged on Long Chen, ensnaring him in their radiant grasp.

Bound in this light, Long Chen felt blood energy pouring into him. His heart started to regenerate amidst this influx of power.

Long Chen actually didn’t have to use the primal chaos space’s life energy to heal. But before he could rejoice, the new heart pounded, and Long Chen vomited blood once again VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

All of this blood was his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood. Long Chen howled, “Stop messing around! I’m from the human race, not the dragon race! I don’t want to switch out my blood!”

However, no one replied to him. His heart kept tightening, squeezing out his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood. It was like a pump that extracted his bloodline.

As Long Chen’s essence blood fell, the rays of light sent drops of blood into him to replace his lost blood.

Long Chen was livid. Although he could feel his body rapidly strengthening thanks to this influx of blood, he couldn’t accept such a thing.

“Release me! I don’t want your inheritance! Let me go!” Long Chen roared furiously, struggling with all his might. But the rays of divine light were like unbreakable ropes tying him.

BOOM! BOOM!

Lei Linger and Huo Linger appeared and attacked those threads at the same time. However, their power appeared minuscule this time, unable to shake his bindings.

“Senior, save me!”

At this time, Long Chen could only beg for aid from the Earth Cauldron. However, the Earth Cauldron fell into a deathly silence and didn’t reply.

Long Chen’s heart once more shattered and reformed, while more of his blood came flying out. Two kinds of blood flew out and were devoured by the magma here, vanishing without a trace.

Long Chen almost went crazy. He roared and struggled, but it was all useless.

More dragon blood poured into him, changing his constitution. Now, Long Chen found that he could barely sense his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood’s existence inside of him.

“I told you to stop!”

Long Chen let out a heaven-shaking roar that contained a will to subdue heaven and earth, as well as a killing intent that encompassed all the nine heavens.

Long Chen’s thunderous roar reverberated across the heavens and earth, each syllable dripping with chilling killing intent.

With an explosive force, the threads binding him shattered into countless fragments. The surface of the magma lake erupted in response to his powerful roar.

The entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest quaked with the intensity of his furious bellow.

“Stop!”

“Stop!”

“Stop!”

...

His voice was like an imperial edict. After the echoes faded, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest descended into silence once more.

As for Long Chen himself, he lost consciousness and simply hovered in midair.

“You shouldn’t have tried to act smart. You just did something unnecessary.” The Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out.

The Earth Cauldron was clearly speaking to the dragon scale. However, the scale didn’t reply. After a moment of silence, a ray of divine light shot out of it and entered Long Chen. Then Long Chen vanished, and the magma sea once more moved, as if nothing had ever happened.

Long Chen was immersed in a blood-colored sea and started to molt. Bone spurs grew out of his flesh and fell.

The blood sea contained endless energy that was changing his constitution. Dragon scales appeared on him, each displaying a unique color and shape.

As these scales emerged and receded repeatedly, Long Chen’s once-pale skin gradually transformed into a bronze hue, resembling the rugged texture of dragon hide.

After a while, Long Chen woke up. With a resounding roar, he surged forth from the blood sea. Despite the immense power pulsating within him, he felt no elation; instead, a seething rage consumed him. Killing intent exploded out of him.

“For your size, you have a big temper.” An icy snort rang out.

Long Chen turned his gaze to see a muscular middle-aged man clad in blood-colored armor, his towering frame exuding a formidable presence akin to a metallic fortress

With his square face and electric eyes, he exuded an intimidating divine light. The sharp angles of his face made him look like an extremely unyielding person.

Standing in front of him, Long Chen felt like he was looking up at a natural ruler.

“Were you the one who took my seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood?!” roared Long Chen furiously.

“Fool. You possess the dragon race’s strongest bloodline. Why do you need those worthless bloodlines? Your human race is really insatiably greedy,” snorted the middle-aged man.

“Shut up! Return my blood!”

Long Chen roared and charged at the middle-aged man, swinging a fist at him.
