“Haha, brother Long, you’re worrying too much. This gathering will include experts from every era. Even if the other side is your enemies, they won’t immediately become hostile to you. The scale you’re thinking on is too small,” said Dongfang Yuyang. “Furthermore, you will find that not everyone is your enemy. You’ll be able to make a few friends as well. You’ll be able to meet the peerless heroes of different eras, and of course there will be some peerless beauties as well. I heard that brother Long’s charisma is quite astonishing. Perhaps you’ll be able to return with a few beauties afterward.”

Long Chen still shook his head. None of that was attractive to him. He didn’t want to go to this gathering because he always felt that wherever he went with many people, nothing good would happen to him.

“This matter doesn’t just involve you. You have to accompany Lingshan,” said Qu Jianying directly. “If you don’t go, I’ll tell that old man that a certain someone raised a coward who doesn’t even dare to go to a meeting!”

“Damn, there’s no need to be so evil!” Long Chen was speechless. If she really said that to the old man, Long Chen would definitely have a conversation with the old man and his cane. He wouldn’t let any disciple of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect have the title of coward.

“Well, it’s all up to whether or not you decide to go,” snorted Qu Jianying.

Long Chen really was infuriating her. Dongfang Yuyang was actually offering to be an intermediary for him to get to know the various heroes of past times. It was a huge opportunity.

The great era was reaching its final phase, and the qi flow eruption was coming soon. If he didn’t manage to make some allies at this time, it would be too late when the time came.

This was no longer the old Marital Heaven Continent. It was not a time where a single person was capable of crushing everyone else.

“Fine, I’ll go,” said Long Chen helplessly. He accepted the invitation card.

This was definitely pushing him beyond his ability. He grumbled inside. He knew that he would definitely see people that he didn’t want to see at that gathering.

Seeing Long Chen reluctantly accept Dongfang Yuyang’s invitation, the disciples that had come with him sneered. They clearly thought that Long Chen was acting. After all, this invitation wasn’t something that just anyone was qualified to receive. Who knew how many people were begging to get one only to be refused?

In comparison to them, Dongfang Yuyang maintained a polite and graceful smile the entire time. It seemed he wasn’t displeased with Long Chen’s actions in the slightest.

“I know that you’re all busy, so I won’t disturb you any longer. As long as you can announce the time, location, and conditions for the gathering, that will be enough. I’ll take my leave now.” Dongfang Yuyang once more bowed before leaving.

Once they were gone, Qu Jianying couldn’t help sighing. “He truly is worthy of being a figure who led an entire era. Every one of his movements contains the grace of a supreme expert. This is the power of the everlasting families. Other powers with such ancient inheritances would end up acting like pleased petty little people as soon as they produce a few experts. Some people are never able to develop the same level of nobility.”

Dongfang Yuyang’s arrival had made Qu Jianying bear witness to the foundation and inheritance of the everlasting families. Every movement of Dongfang Yuyang’s possessed the mannerisms of a king.

“What are you looking at me for? Are you saying I’m not as handsome?” said Long Chen.

Qu Jianying shook her head. “In terms of looks, you aren’t inferior. In terms of power, there’s no way to know since you haven’t exchanged blows. But look at his steady bearing. When will you be able to compare to that? When will you stop being so sloppy and start acting like a real expert?”

Ye Lingshan laughed to the side upon seeing Qu Jianying chide Long Chen. There really were only a handful of people who could chide Long Chen like this.

“I’m not an expert, so why would I need that kind of bearing?” grumbled Long Chen.

“Fine, just scram. There’s no way for me to talk to you. You’re just like that damn old man,” cursed Qu Jianying, having Ye Lingshan send Long Chen off.

Long Chen rolled his eyes. He had known that he never should have agreed.

On the way, Ye Lingshan said, “Long Chen, what do you think about Dongfang Yuyang’s power?”

“Unfathomable.” Long Chen could only say a single word.

Dongfang Yuyang most likely trained in some kind of special cultivation technique. His aura was completely sealed. There was no way to see anything about his cultivation base, his bloodline, or his soul.

The thing that had shocked Long Chen the most was when Dongfang Yuyang had suppressed that eleventh tier medicinal pill. Long Chen had intentionally been slow at that time in order to see what Dongfang Yuyang would do.

When Dongfang Yuyang had waved his hand at that time, a divine rune had appeared on his palm. In that instant, the power that he had used was entirely the Heavenly Dao energy of the outside world.

It was like he could command the laws of heaven and earth. He hadn’t exposed the slightest bit of his own power.

However, since Long Chen cultivated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, although he couldn’t see through Dongfang Yuyang, he could sense a mountain-like pressure from him.

Within the same realm, the only ones capable of giving him such pressure before were Leng Yueyan and the Pill Fairy. Now another one had appeared.

“Long Chen, don’t blame master. She has always treated you like her own child. With the changing of times, perhaps you should change your style. Perhaps you’ve already gotten used to being the main character of this era, but now the main characters of other eras have appeared. No matter how strong a person is, they can’t suppress this era. Other than...”

“Other than a Sovereign,” said Long Chen.

Only a Sovereign could suppress all other existences, including gods and devils. They stood at the peak of this world.

Ye Lingshan looked at Long Chen as though she wanted to say something. Long Chen laughed, “it’s alright, you can say it. You mean to say that the next Sovereign cannot be me, so if I want to live, I have to be better behaved, right?”

The five generations of Sovereigns had all worn white. This was common knowledge. Legend said that only experts with completely pure hearts determined to protect all life on the Martial Heaven Continent could become Sovereigns.

Although Ye Lingshan didn’t have the vision of the High Priest, she knew that there was no way Long Chen could become a legendary Sovereign.

One reason was his black clothes. Although it couldn’t be said that his heart was black, his Dao was definitely different from the Dao of the Sovereigns.

The other reason was that Long Chen did not possess that bearing of the Sovereigns that had led their entire generation. Yes, Long Chen possessed astonishing charisma, but that was limited to only a portion of this generation. The Sovereigns had possessed a quality that had won over everyone within the world.

The successive generations of Sovereigns had been unrivaled, not just because of their martial power, but because of a certain bearing that could win over their enemies. As for Long Chen, countless people had slandered and framed him. That had never stopped.

It wasn’t just Ye Lingshan who had noticed this. Qu Jianying had long since come to the same conclusion, so Long Chen had to join others if he wished to survive.

“Long Chen, have you ever thought about your own position?” asked Ye Lingshan.

People needed goals in life. Otherwise, if they only took things as they came with no target in mind, they would simply drift away. Without any foundation, they could collapse at any moment. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“My position? That’s probably too far to discuss. Let’s not talk about such meaningless things. A human is an existence that is very hard to change. Just like the old man and the alliance head, despite clearly being in love, they are unable to be together. They know their own shortcomings and know that they should be more accommodating and patient, but despite understanding it, they can’t actually do it. There’s no absolute right or wrong, which is why everyone gives different answers. They have different viewpoints. I have my merits and deficits, and I’m aware of them. But just knowing isn’t enough. So getting back to the topic, I am just like this, and I have no position. Cultivation is a path of no return, and to put it simply, I will simply live as I have been. Alright, we’ve reached the transportation formation, so I’ll take my leave. Also, don’t end up falling for Dongfang Yuyang, or I’ll feel disappointed.” With a laugh, Long Chen entered the transportation formation.

Before Ye Lingshan could even retort, he had vanished. Ye Lingshan shook her head.

Long Chen was not just one thing. Good and bad, arrogant and humble, icy and warm, callous and humorous. He was also intelligent but sometimes did hopelessly stupid things.

...

Long Chen walked out of the transportation formation. When the twisting space returned to normal, he found himself on the peak of a mountain.

Nine tall mountains were surrounding this mountain. Divine light could be seen sparkling within fluctuations in the sky.

This place was the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s new territory. Unexpectedly, the grand formation had already been completed. This grand formation was extremely powerful.

“Boss, you’re back?” A pleasantly surprised shout rang out.
