Chapter 2848 Chu Kuang

Long Chen and Heaven Master Yun Yang’s wager was concluded in a stunning fashion, and it shook the entire God Institute. For a while, the name of Boss Long San resounded loudly.

This name even spread beyond the God Institute to the other institutes. After all, someone who had joined the academy as a worker and become a teacher in just a matter of days was unprecedented in living memory. He also passed full marks for the Pill Institute’s exam, beat up the instructor on his first day of classes, and after being disciplined, he directly took the exam to become an instructor. In just a month, he also turned a group of trash into a true Elite Group. Any one of these feats was shocking.

If it was just one, perhaps people would think that it was luck. But everything that Long Chen had done showed that it was his true power.

With Long Chen formally being an instructor and not required to wear his instructor robes, countless disciples requested classes with him.

Instructors could hold classes once every three days. And since his next thirty classes were fully booked, others would need to wait at least three months for the next opening.

Naturally, the first three classes were reserved for Mu Qingyun and the others. She had long since been prepared and had simply been waiting for Long Chen to win the gamble to formally attend his class.

With Long Chen’s victory, Mu Qingyun and the others were overjoyed. Long Chen was even stronger than they had imagined. All their efforts had paid off.

At this moment, Long Chen walked alongside Mu Qingyun, appearing especially conspicuous as he was the only one wearing black in a sea of white.

Countless disciples stared at him enviously when he passed. It could be said that he was the one to attract the greatest attention within the entire academy.

Other than the dean, even institute heads had to wear their own specific robes as specified by the rules. Because of it, Long Chen could be considered to have one of the privileges of the dean.

In his black robes, he was stared at wherever he went. Although his clothes were shabby, it didn’t stop him from appearing above the common crowd.

“Congratulations on your fame in the God Institute. I don’t know just how many people worship you now.”

Many people stared at Long Chen as he passed, whispering to themselves. Some female disciples in particular were attracted to his wildness. He felt both dangerous and mysterious, and this gave him a unique attractiveness. It made people want to probe his secrets.

Some female disciples even waved to him as he passed. Long Chen nodded back to them, returning their greeting. But his expression was completely indifferent, as if all of this was unable to draw his attention. It was Mu Qingyun who became excited on his behalf. Just walking with him seemed to be letting her take advantage of his light.

“Worship? No. The women mostly are drawn by a desire to subdue and attract. It’s either to take me captive or ask for protection. As for the men, it’s mostly fear and jealousy. If they were given a chance to destroy me, they wouldn’t hesitate.” Long Chen shook his head. This was not worship. Mu Qingyun was still too immature in this aspect.

“Brother San, you’re clearly young, even younger than most of us. Why do you always talk like you’re old and experienced?” asked Mu Qingyun with a smile.

Mu Qingyun was actually a few years older than Long Chen, but she addressed him the same as the others, because brother Long felt a bit more estranged than brother San.

“Perhaps my heart is already old. In the lower world, I dreamed of becoming a god or immortal. In our legends, ascending meant an endless life, roaming the nine heavens, being free and unrestrained. There was no bitterness, no pain. But after ascending, I found that I jumped from one gameboard to another gameboard, from one sea of bitterness into another sea of bitterness. However, the gameboard is now bigger, and the sea of bitterness is deeper. If I didn’t have my goals, perhaps I wouldn’t even know how to live. The immortal world is completely different from what I imagined. The rules here are all rotten, and the system is corrupt. Even worse, the people are vicious and sinister. I don’t like it,” sighed Long Chen.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, people viewed gods and immortals as perfection. They thought that ascension meant flying free of any bindings, of any vexations.

As expected, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. The High Firmament Academy was like a mirror. Through it, Long Chen saw a miniature version of the entire immortal world. This was no wonderland but a larger, darker, and bloodier world.

“You can’t put it like that. The immortal world is so big that you can’t even imagine it. It is said that it has no end, so there are countless miracles within it. There are also countless dangerous areas and secret realms with mysteries to uncover. We shouldn’t just look at the bad side. We should look at the good side too. That good side is what drives us to cultivate,” said Mu Qingyun.

Long Chen smiled and nodded. “You’re right. Those beautiful things are what gives us the motivation to live. I have to think of a way to change this attitude of mine. Maybe by staying with youngsters like you, I’ll also become younger.”

“You’re talking like you’re old again,” laughed Mu Qingyun. “We should discuss our business. Three days later is our class, so I’ve called back all the disciples of the Unfettered Alliance. The number of people might surpass the norm, but I’m sure that brother San has no problem with this, right?”

“Of course there is no problem. But I see that you’re very impatient. Why is that?” asked Long Chen.

“The divine competition is about to start. That’s the turning point of our lives, and we must grasp it. Brother San, you’re our only hope for us to defeat the Prime Glory Alliance and Chu Kuang.” Mu Qingyun looked at Long Chen almost pleadingly. For a powerful woman like Mu Qingyun to reveal such a look showed that she had bet everything on Long Chen.

“Hahaha, how unexpected, truly unexpected! The Mu Qingyun who previously viewed herself as unmatched is actually begging others. It seems that to defeat a certain Chu, you’ve racked your brain for schemes. Now you no longer mind lowering yourself to someone else, huh?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Before Long Chen could reply, a sneer rang out and a group of people walked over.

That voice caused Mu Qingyun’s body to shudder with rage. Killing intent blazed in her eyes.

Long Chen then looked over. It was a group of over ten people at the peak of the Mortal Transcendence realm. As flame fluctuations came from their bodies, they must have condensed their divine flame seed.

As for their leader, it was a tall, handsome man with a sword on his back. Although he was handsome, with the way his mouth curved up and his jaw stuck out, he gave off an exceedingly arrogant feeling. Even when he walked, he seemed to be swaggering. Just the way he walked gave Long Chen an urge to slap him.

“Chu Kuang, you bastard, clean your mouth. This time, we won’t stop until death!” shouted Mu Qingyun.

“Just you? Or just him?”

This man was Chu Kuang. Just like his name, he was incredibly arrogant. He pointed his finger at Long Chen disdainfully.

“Point at me again and I’ll make it so that you don’t see tomorrow’s sun.” Long Chen looked at Chu Kuang coldly. This person gave him an extremely detestable feeling. That feeling was strange and unclear.
