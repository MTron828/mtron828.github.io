Chapter 3955 Using Force

“Hahaha!”

Yu Qingxuan’s mother and the other woman laughed at the same time. But they quickly remembered that this wasn’t a place to laugh, so they turned their faces away.

On the other hand, Yu Xiaoyun’s face was dark with fury. He had seen all kinds of existences in this world, but he never met someone who dared to point and curse at him.

As for the other experts of the imperial family, they looked from Yu Xiaoyun to Long Chen, not a single one of them daring to make a noise. But they had to admit that while Yu Xiaoyun was not ugly, he had no connection with the word handsome. Long Chen was right, but no one else would dare to state this truth.

“You’re spouting bullshit!” Yu Xiaoyun cursed at Long Chen.

“Your majesty, take note of your propriety!”

At that moment, an elder sternly shouted at the emperor. His face bore deep wrinkles, including his eyes, reflecting the passage of time. Also, he stood as a living relic, the most senior member of the imperial family within the Vermilion Bird Empire

As a result, even the emperor had to be respectful toward him. Blessed with great authority, if he felt that the emperor was being unfair to his sons and daughters, he had the authority to veto the emperor’s rule. That would activate the imperial parliament, and the decision would be made by casting votes.

Thus, when the elder spoke up, Yu Xiaoyun took a deep breath and quelled his rage.

Long Chen’s gaze roved around quickly. It seemed that this elder was someone who even dared to scold the emperor. The Vermilion Bird Empire truly did care about seniority.

“Big brother Xia Guhong was wrong. If there are no good methods, then I can only use force,” murmured Long Chen quietly.

Before Long Chen left, Xia Guhong had warned him that Yu Xiaoyun had a bad temper. Even if you were nice, he wouldn’t like you. And if you weren’t nice, he still wouldn’t like you. Thus, if things couldn’t be discussed in peace, it would be better to just barge through.

However, there was one thing that Long Chen had to make sure of. He couldn’t offend the two empresses. As long as he pulled those two to his side, there shouldn’t be any problem.

On the way here, Long Chen had been pondering over whether or not he should get along with Yu Xiaoyun amicably. However, his own temper wasn’t good. Would he really be able to restrain himself?

Other than that, if he did restrain himself too hard, would it produce too many negative emotions? Would it trigger his dark energy and awaken his heart-devil?

Hence, when Eunuch Wei appeared, Long Chen decided to use force. Otherwise, if he was constantly enduring insults and provocations, wouldn’t he be bullied to death by Eunuch Wei?

“You don’t know anything about rules or etiquette! You even beat people on the streets! With your character, what qualifications do you have to touch my daughter?!” shouted Yu Xiaoyun coldly.

“What use do rules and etiquette have? In the Heavenly Flame World, why didn’t you talk about rules and etiquette to Yan Xu’s son when he was going to devour your daughter? Also, why did I beat up Eunuch Wei? Wasn’t it because he insulted me first? Not killing him was giving Qingxuan face. Otherwise, not even ten of his lives would have been enough to quell my anger,” snorted Long Chen.

Yu Xiaoyun was enraged. “You… you’re using your previous favor as blackmail material? A nobleman would not do such a thing.”

Long Chen brought up how Yan Xu’s son, Yan Hong, had wanted to devour Yu Qingxuan for the Heavenly Rainbow Flame back in the Heavenly Flame World and how he had saved her. This fact was known to all.

With his status as Yu Qingxuan’s savior, after he brought this matter up, the air in the room changed.

“What damn blackmail? Qingxuan and I sincerely love each other. For her, I am willing to even sacrifice my life. How is that blackmail?”

“You better keep your fucking mouth clean!” Yu Xiaoyun couldn’t endure it and barked back at Long Chen.

“Your majesty! Your dignity! Your decorum! Is spouting obscenities the manner of the ruler of a nation?” warned the elder again.

“But he’s clearly the one who did it first! Why don’t you scold him?!” Yu Xiaoyun’s face darkened with fury.

“He is but a child. Without a name or status in the Vermilion Bird Empire, he would be considered the most common commoner. On the other hand, you—the ruler of a nation—are shouting at a commoner inside your palace and even spouting such obscenities! What kind of decorum is that?”

Being reprimanded like this, Yu Xiaoyun quivered with rage. He could only point at Long Chen. “Alright, brat, count yourself vicious!”

Long Chen was startled and quickly realized that his calculations were wrong. It seemed that the emperor wasn’t the sole decision-maker here. Instead, the important decision seemed to be made in a discussion between multiple parties.

Long Chen quickly put away his wild attitude when he realized this. “Your majesty, although I am arrogant, it also depends on who I am facing. Qingxuan is my beloved, and she is even more important than my life. Although I come with nothing, I have a sincere heart. I have no betrothal gift because there is simply no gift that can compare to Qingxuan. Any betrothal gift would be a blasphemy to her. So, all I brought is my life.”

This time, Long Chen’s words could count as pleasant. But Long Chen truly had no experience in this regard; he didn’t know how he was supposed to offer a betrothal gift. If he brought out something and was rejected, that would be too awkward.

Hearing this, Yu Qingxuan’s mother and the other woman nodded slightly. Although Long Chen was arrogant, at least, he knew how to take a step back.

However, Yu Xiaoyun was still enraged as he heard a different kind of meaning in Long Chen’s words. Thus, he furiously shouted, “Are you saying that if I don’t agree to this marriage, you will face me with your life? What a joke! Do you think I’m afraid of you?!”

Hearing this, Long Chen almost lost control of his temper. Just how did the man before him manage to twist his words into a threat? Could it be that this idiot emperor lacked the ability to comprehend the meaning behind words?

“Your majesty, Long Chen is only saying that he is willing to die for Qingxuan and that he would walk through fire for her. He is expressing his sincerity,” said the other woman.

Seeing one of the empresses speak up for him, Long Chen was gratified. He suddenly realized that Yu Qingxuan had probably told her mother about him. Otherwise, why would this other woman also speak up for him?

Upon thinking of that, his confidence inflated. With the support of both empresses, everything could be handled.

“Sincerity? Hmph, marriage is a major matter. It is the fathers and mothers that must discuss this matter. There can’t be a marriage without going through this process. If you were to act arbitrarily, you would only make others laugh at you. What sincerity?” said Yu Xiaoyun irritably.

“That’s right, child, why haven’t your father and mother come?” asked that beautiful woman.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s expression instantly darkened. His first thought was about his parents in the mortal world. He had no idea how he could bring them here.

He also thought of his biological parents. He had no memory of them and didn’t even know where they were. As a result, his mouth quivered a few times, but he had no idea what to say.

Yu Qingxuan’s mother and the other empress saw the pain in his eyes and exchanged a glance. They both sensed something wrong. Was this child an orphan?nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yu Qingxuan’s mother hastily said, “Long Chen, if you wish to marry Qingxuan, it probably won’t be that easy. You have to be mentally prepared.”

“Empress, you…” Yu Xiaoyun stared at his wife a bit unhappily.

This was essentially an open warning to Long Chen. It meant that they didn’t reject Long Chen, but there would be many tests awaiting him.

“Little fellow, do you really wish to marry the princess?”

Just then, the elder that had repeatedly chided the emperor spoke to Long Chen for the first time.
