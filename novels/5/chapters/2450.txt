Chapter 2440 Life Spirit God

Translator: BornToBe

Their bows and arrows were of the most primitive wooden type. However, Long Chen had personally witnessed their power. They were stronger than average divine items.

In the face of the hostile gazes of thousands of the Luo Spirit race’s experts, Long Chen remained calm. He believed that Qi Li would settle things.

As he expected, Qi Li immediately shouted something at those people, and they shouted back.

Even after a long time of arguing, there was no sign of them retreating. It wasn’t just Li Qi’s fiance. The others were also not moved.

Qi Li suddenly took out her bow furiously. She nocked an arrow and pointed it at her fiance.

This action caused a startled cry to rise from the others. Her fiance turned ashen but still remained standing, pointing at Long Chen and shouting something.

Qi Li coldly said something, causing him to turn pale.

Although Long Chen didn’t understand them, he could guess that this was no welcoming party.

“Miss Qi Li, thank you for your kindness. There’s no need for me to see your leader. If we have a chance, we can meet again in the future.” Long Chen had his own pride. If they didn’t want him here, he wouldn’t stick around. It was ridiculous to cause a betrothed couple to have a falling out over him.

Long Chen turned to leave, not giving Qi Li a chance to stop him. However, the sound of a horn suddenly echoed, and a group of people came rushing over aggressively.

Amongst them was a tall, grim old man. The crowd parted to allow him through.

“This person is powerful.” Long Chen’s heart shook. This old man was the only one amongst these people that gave him a sensation of mortal danger.

Qi Li exclaimed her delight, running over to him. She pointed at Long Chen and then her fiance, saying something.

Her fiance tried to interject, but with a glare from the old man, he fell silent.

After Qi Li finished her explanation, the elder nodded. He took out a black stone and handed it to her.

Upon seeing the stone, the other experts began to shout once more. However, with a cold snort from the old man, they fell silent, not daring to say anything.

Qi Li happily gave the stone to Long Chen, saying, “My father has permitted you to use our Soul Communication Stone. Here, send your Spiritual Strength inside, and you will be able to speak to us normally.”

Long Chen hesitated before nodding. He sent his Spiritual Strength in, and a bright light suddenly erupted from the black stone. The brighter it grew, the more shocked the others were.

As his Spiritual Strength entered, information poured into his mind. This was the Luo Spirit race’s communication tool.

However, this stone did not just contain their language. That was just a small portion of it. With how enormous his Spiritual Strength was, he fully activated the stone in an instant. Even the elder’s expression changed.

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength quickly exited the stone. He only merged with the part containing the language, not having looked at the rest. This made the elder’s expression soften, and he nodded, seemingly satisfied.

Long Chen passed it back to Qi Li, saying, “I’m sorry for having caused an internal fracture in your tribe. The matter of the Thorned Devil race was entirely a coincidence. They wanted to kill me, so I had no choice but to kill them. You have no need to thank me. Furthermore, you saved me when I escaped from the spatial crack, so we can count as even. I have things to do, so I won’t disturb you any longer.”

Now that he knew their language, he could communicate with them directly, and what he said made them feel a twinge of shame.

“Everyone, don’t fall for it! The invaders are always crafty and despicable. He’s trying to pluck our sympathy! We have to be vigilant!” shouted Qi Li’s fiance.

“La Wei, he is a benefactor of our Luo Spirit race. You have been going against him this entire time. Are you even a warrior of the Luo Spirit race? Is this how you treat people who help us?” demanded Qi Li furiously.

“You’ve been fooled by this little white-faced pretty boy. Did you forget just how much pain those invaders have brought us? Just how many of our people have they killed in the past?!” shouted La Wei just as furiously.

Little white-faced pretty boy? Long Chen’s expression grew odd. His face was manly, and while it couldn’t be called extraordinarily handsome, it didn’t have the slightest relation to that description.

However, when he compared himself to the men of the Luo Spirit race who were very tanned, he supposed he was rather white in comparison.

“You bastard!” Qi Li furiously slapped La Wei across the face. La Wei didn’t even bother dodging. His expression didn’t change. It seemed that this wasn’t particularly out of the ordinary.

“Stop it. Whether or not he came here with his own intentions, he has yet to say anything and the two of you have entered such a state. Is that not foolish?” said the stern-looking old man.

La Wei and Qi Li fell silent. The elder walked over to Long Chen. He was a head taller than him and still imposing in his old age. He was like a fierce lion.

“Little fellow, I don’t care if it was a coincidence or not, or if you had other intentions. The Luo Spirit race is not one to forget its debts. You saved Qi Li at that time, and based on our rules, she is your woman, and you are my son-in-law. Even if you were sent here by our enemies, as long as you continue to remain here peacefully and not betray us, you will be one of us,” said the elder.

The others were all dumbfounded. Qi Li’s eyes widened, while a vein popped on La Wei’s forehead.

“No, no, no! That’s completely unnecessary.” Long Chen’s head shook like a rattle drum. “I have a fiancee already. More than one actually. So…”

This crazy turn caught Long Chen completely off guard. He didn’t know how to express himself.

“Oh? If you decline, you would be looking down on us. That would prove you’re a spy sent by our enemies. Do you want to die?” demanded the elder. He raised his hand.

Over ten thousand arrows were instantly pointed and ready to shoot at Long Chen. With a single word from the elder, he would be turned into a pincushion. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Father!” shouted Qi Li.

“Shut your mouth. It is not your place to speak here,” shouted the elder. He turned back to Long Chen. “Life or death, you decide.”

Long Chen shook his head. “Asking me to marry Qi Li is impossible. However, my life or death will not be decided by you. You can keep being king of the mountain here. I’m leaving.”

Long Chen walked away. Although the Luo Spirit race’s arrows were powerful, they weren’t enough to threaten him.

“You can come back. It was just a test.” The elder’s harsh expression vanished and was replaced by a faint smile.

Long Chen looked back at the elder oddly.

“Young friend, please don’t be angry. Throughout our history, we have been tricked multiple times by people from outside this world, so we have to be wary.” The elder walked over to Long Chen and bowed, performing one of the Luo Spirit race’s strange etiquettes. “Thank you for your help. You’ve prevented many casualties amongst us.”

“No, I already said it was a coincidence,” said Long Chen hastily.

The Luo Spirit race was one of the indigenous peoples of this place. In other words, every time the Star Field Divine World opened, humans descended and must have had conflicts with them, so they had naturally grown cautious of humans. Long Chen understood why they were so afraid of him.

“Even if he isn’t a spy, he came off of the cursed ship! He’s going to bring us misfortune!” said La Wei. His hostility toward Long Chen had lessened, but not completely.

The cursed ship had to be the existence known as the Ghost Ship on the Martial Heaven Continent. Even the Luo Spirit race was afraid of it.

“So many of us saw the cursed ship, and at a close distance at that. If it really causes misfortune, we won’t be able to escape it, so don’t bring it up again. What will come will come. We will not be able to avoid it by turning this young friend away.” The elder waved his hand, indicating La Wei should not bring up the topic again. Turning back to Long Chen, he asked, “May I ask what you are called?”

“I am Long Chen.” Long Chen cupped his fists. “I do have a matter I could use your help with. Is it alright for me to ask?”

“Please, go ahead.”

“I wish to obtain a map of this world, the bigger the better. Does the Luo Spirit race possess one?”

“We do have maps, but they only cover the surrounding territory. If you want one covering more territory, you’ll have to go ask the Life Spirit God.”

“The Life Spirit God? May I go see them?” Long Chen was startled. This world had a god within it?
