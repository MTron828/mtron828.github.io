Chapter 2669 The Terrifying Long Aotian

“What is there to explain? We didn’t know about Aotian’s matters either. We never asked,” sneered the Long family head.

“What bullsh*t! Your Long family just watched as others died!” raged the Zhao family head.

The Zhao family head’s roaring drew quite a bit of attention. People stared at them in shock. What was going on with the divine families? Why were they suddenly fighting?

“If you want to think that way, it’s up to you,” responded the Long family head, completely brushing her off.

The power that Long Aotian was currently displaying was truly stunning. Even Sovereign Han Wei’s attacks were blocked.

When Long Chen had killed Zhao Ritian back then, if Long Aotian hadn’t hidden his power, he definitely would have had a high chance of saving him. However, Long Aotian hadn’t done so.

The Zhao family head’s face was twitching from anger. Her finger shook as she pointed at the Long family head, cursing, “The Long family’s people are all treacherous and sinister. You deserve almost being slaughtered back then…” At this moment, a flash of comprehension struck her. “No wonder! So your Long family ended up like that because of Long Aotian!”

“Shut up!”

The Lord Venerate suddenly shouted, preventing her from going any further.

“That matter is taboo. Anyone who mentions it will be executed.”

The Zhao family head’s expression sank, but she shut her mouth.

“What? If you don’t like it, go complain to the Lord Saint. What’s the point of you fighting here like this?!” barked the Lord Venerate.

The Zhao family head was silent, her expression ugly. After that, the Long family head glanced at her disdainfully for a moment before ignoring her. His focus was on Long Aotian.

Right now, zither music rang out through the air, and the void was constantly destroyed. Invisible threads weaved through the air, slicing apart the void and causing it to displace.

As the Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram behind Long Aotian trembled, a nine-dragon mark appeared on his fists. With every smash of his fists, the void would shatter, dispelling Sovereign Han Wei’s attacks.

Everyone was stunned. So Long Aotian was actually the strongest one here. Sovereign Han Wei had already summoned the seven-string Heavenly Dao zither, but Long Aotian was still able to match her.

“Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram? Hmph, completely impure and unrefined. It’s not always the case that more is better, especially when it comes to things that aren’t yours,” snorted Sovereign Han Wei.

Long Aotian’s expression twitched before returning to normal. He indifferently said, “The Sovereign’s words are correct. However, the world is full of marvels. At the peak of the Dao, it becomes possible to become an immortal or god. Since the Martial Heaven Continent is just a drop in the ocean compared to the vast universe, how can a Sovereign deny my Dao?”

Countless people were enraged by his arrogance toward the Sovereigns. Although they were said flatly, it was clearly mocking. He was saying that the Sovereigns had spent a lifetime protecting the Martial Heaven Continent and hadn’t gone on to further lands, as if they were frogs at the bottom of a well.

“Even a speck of the divine world dares to be so arrogant? Even if you control the third rank manifestation of the thirty-six divine manifestations, so what? Wasn’t that birthed by an immortal sprout? How highly could it possibly agree with you? Your Spirit Root is completely muddled, your Spirit Blood is impure, and your Spirit Bone was mutated afterward. Forcibly changing your talent unnaturally has completely overdone any of your original talents. To steal innate fortune and turn it into acquired power is a heretical path that does not accord with the heavens. Tell me, how long can you maintain this Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram? If you come out to play, you’ll have to pay the price sooner or later,” said Sovereign Han Wei coldly. Right now, divine light shone from her eyes, and the temperature plummeted as dense killing intent solidified.

As a result, a bone-chilling iciness crept into everyone’s souls, making them involuntarily shiver. An intense feeling of death hung in the air. It felt like every breath was another step closer to death.

As people shivered, they were also startled. Sovereign Han Wei’s anger and killing intent toward Long Aotian surpassed what she had shown for the invading experts.

“Shut up! I, Long Aotian, have never submitted to anyone! So what if you’re a Sovereign? Today, I’ll break your undefeatable myth!” roared Long Aotian furiously. Sovereign Han Wei’s words had touched upon his taboo. He was also shocked that all his secrets were exposed in front of her.

Long Aotian charged toward Sovereign Han Wei, the divine diagram behind him revolving. The Daos of heaven and earth formed a giant cyclone behind him.

“I can’t feel Heavenly Dao energy any longer!” In that instant, the world’s Heavenly Dao energy seemed to have been sucked dry.

A golden spear appeared in Long Aotian’s hand. Nine dragons were carved into it. Immortal qi rose out of it. This was an aura that others had never felt before.

“Is this a legendary immortal weapon?!”

Stunned cries rang out. The aura of that spear was completely different from the weapons of the Martial Heaven Continent. It was even completely different from the world divine items of the Blood Fiend Devil Lord and the Alldevil Heavenwalker. That aura seemed to supersede the Daos of this world.

The dragon carvings on the spear began to resonate with the manifestation behind Long Aotian. Dragon roars rang out. With a thrust of his spear, the world fell silent, as if all sound had been sucked away.

“So what if you have a divine weapon of the immortal world?” Sovereign Han Wei snorted. She plucked the heaven string of her zither, unleashing a ray of divine light.

BOOM!

The divine light exploded on contact, causing Long Aotian to shake. However, with a flick of his spear, he once more shot toward Sovereign Han Wei. “The heaven string refers to only the heavens of the Martial Heaven Continent. But the Martial Heaven Continent is nothing more than a stepping stone for me. My future lies in even higher worlds. You think you can use this world’s laws to restrict me? Keep dreaming!” Long Aotian’s words were extremely wild, almost in a deranged way. But his power was truly stunning.

Just before this, the heaven string’s attack had almost killed the Nine-Headed Lion in one blow, but Long Aotian had easily blocked it.

“I don’t dislike arrogant people, because everyone who acts arrogant in front of me gets killed by me. However, I really dislike your arrogance, because you harmed the person that I like the most. So I will kill you today.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Sovereign Han Wei’s zither suddenly shrank, transforming into a nine-foot ancient zither. When that zither appeared, everyone was startled.

“The Southern Sea Zither!”
