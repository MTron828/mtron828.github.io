Chapter 3985 Ignorant Fellow

Long Chen’s response lacked any politeness, but there was no need for him to be polite.

In the three thousand worlds, his Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens had killed countless experts, including the people of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire. As a result, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire definitely wouldn’t be his ally.

As soon as that person spoke to him, Long Chen knew that he was up to something. Thus, Long Chen refused to act courteously.

However, that expert didn’t seem to mind and kept smiling. “I heard just now that you wanted to sit with your wife? Are you deriding Princess Qingxuan as your wife?”[1]

Long Chen curled his lips. “With your little bit of ability, don’t come out and embarrass yourself. With your little intelligence, do you wish to challenge my relationship with Qingxuan? This term exists in the mortal world and the immortal world. The meaning is to stay together for a lifetime until you’re both old and white-haired. If you wish to challenge me, I’d advise you to pick another direction. People should know their own limits, or they will only be asking to be bullied.

Even after this chiding, that expert’s expression didn’t change. “Then tell me, how did my Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire offend you? Why did you kidnap my seventeenth brother? And why did you kill my empire’s experts?”

“Because the weather wasn’t bad that day!” responded Long Chen directly.

“You…!” That expert finally lost control, and killing intent exploded out of him.

“What you? I already told you to get to the point. Whether you represent yourself or your Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire, I will accompany you. A martial competition or a scholarly competition, you can pick one. If you want to play, let’s play,” Long Chen shrugged indifferently.

Without his heart-devil, Long Chen had no misgivings about anything, so he did whatever he wanted. It was like he had returned to his youth and had no misgivings at all.

That expert was about to reply when an elder by his side stopped him. The elder said, “Let us put aside the matter of children for now. Your Majesty Xiaoyun, I wish to ask you, why has your noble army repeatedly provoked and attacked the people of my empire? Today, I invited the Violet Thunderclap, Eastern Brilliance, Feather Cry, and the other empires’ diplomats to hear a satisfactory response.”

This question infuriated the people from the Vermillion Bird Empire. Previously, they could be considered friendly neighbors with the Heavenly Ruler Seal, but it was clear that the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire had cast its side to the Violet Thunderclap Empire. Moreover, they were the ones causing trouble on the border, and they were also the ones to attack first. The Vermilion Bird Empire only counterattacked when they invaded the border.

But now, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire actually acted like the victims. That was absolutely shameless. It was like a thief crying, “Stop thief!”

All eight empires’ had sent diplomats here as the representatives of eight major empires. However, this was no diplomatic mission; it was clearly bullying.

“What are you saying? The scuffles on the border are just two nations training together and mutually raising each other. Why have you elevated this to a concern for our nations?” responded Jiang Huixin on Yu Xiaoyun’s behalf.

Long Chen glanced at Yu Xiaoyun, seeing him drinking wine with his head down as if he hadn’t heard anything. Long Chen couldn’t help finding it curious. With Yu Xiaoyun’s temper, shouldn’t he be directly exploding at this moment?

“My mom set up a screening formation around him. Due to his cultivation technique, his temper is fierce, so Mom set up this formation to screen his six senses. They’re already used to acting like this. Dad always acts like this in such moments, leaving these things to my mom and second mom,” transmitted Yu Qingxuan.

Only then did Long Chen understand. He already knew that there was no way someone like Yu Xiaoyun would be able to endure such a thing.

“Exchanging pointers? Empress, your words really are interesting. In the last few years, the Vermilion Bird Empire has been focusing more and more on the martial side while abandoning the learning side. You are clearly raising your combat power for war! It is precisely due to this that matters between our two empires have grown increasingly tense. If we have to trace the source of this friction, we can only conclude that it stems from your side! Tell me, Master Gongzhi, did I say anything wrong?” That elder actually turned to look at Philosopher Sun.

Philosopher Sun’s surname was Sun, but his given name was Gongzhi. In the Vermilion Bird Empire, the majority of people called him Philosopher Sun, and only people from outside the empire would call him something else.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Shockingly, Philosopher Sun nodded. “The Vermilion Bird Empire has truly been focusing on martial arts too much lately, leaving a heavy atmosphere over the empire. Rather than focusing on learning to better themselves, the people are focusing on fighting. With that, they are unable to control the greed and avarice in their hearts. I also share the blame over this matter.”

Long Chen was stunned. What was he doing? Joining the other side? This was clearly throwing the empire into the other side’s trap, and it was such an obvious trap as well.

“The Vermilion Bird Empire has been increasing its number of cultivators to the point that it is a serious threat to my Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s peace. We argue for what is right, but instead we are slaughtered by your respected nation. Do you have anything to say that explains your actions?” demanded the elder righteously.

“To use literature to reach the Dao, to spread a culture of learning throughout the land is the true King Dao. However, the current Vermilion Bird Empire is focusing entirely on martial arts, causing people’s hearts to be war-like. People then grow violent and fickle. Even in this state banquet, there are people who don’t understand etiquette or the ways of the world. They make a fool of themselves, a waste of the Vermilion Bird’s blessing. Your Majesty truly must revitalize the empire’s culture!” declared Philosopher Sun.

In the end, he even dragged Long Chen into his words, causing Long Chen’s temper to instantly explode. He snorted, “This world really is unjust. How do idiots manage to live for so long? Do they spend their entire lives cultivating their face? I’ve seen shameless people, but not someone as shameless as you. You eat the Vermilion Bird Empire’s food, drink the Vermilion Bird Empire’s wine, and benefit from the greatest status and wealth here, yet you side with some outsiders. Fuck, some people really are less than a dog! At the very least, a dog knows not to bite its master!”

“You… you little brat, what right do you have to speak at this time?!” raged Philosopher Sun, standing and shouting at Long Chen furiously.

“You… you ignorant old fellow, you dare to bark like a dog here?!” Long Chen also stood and cursed back at Philosopher Sun.

Seeing this scene, Yu Qianxue, Zhu Yifeng, and the others almost cheered. This cursing was truly satisfactory. They felt their own blood heating up.

“The other side has forced their way all the way to our gates, yet you are still so blind and do not understand the situation. All you know is how to help other dogs eat crap. Did you grow up on crap? Is that why your mouth is so smelly?” After cursing Philosopher Sun, Long Chen’s gaze roved across the experts present. He sneered, “What does the Vermilion Bird Empire’s focus on literature or martial arts have to do with any of you? Do you think you have the right to interfere? Who do you think you are to tell our Vermilion Bird Empire what to do?”

The Minghong Saber suddenly appeared on Long Chen’s back. He patted the hilt and shouted, “If anyone wants to fight, let’s fight! Anyone from your junior generation, come out and let’s have a fight to the death!”

In an instant, sharp killing intent filled the entire banquet hall, so cold that it gave people goosebumps.
