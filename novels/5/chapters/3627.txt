Chapter 3616

“Long Chen, you had us abandon our homes and then cower like a tortoise. We’re just retreating without actually fighting! Why are we throwing away all our opportunities to counterattack?! What are you intending?”

“Long Chen, you are spreading the Starry River of the Sky Art as much as possible. There are people saying that it is an evil technique, and anyone that trains in it will fall under your sorcery. They end up under your control and will kill anyone you order them to. Are you trying to use the Starry River of the Sky Art to control the entire human race of the Alldevil Star-Field?”

“Long Chen, you scoured our land of medicinal ingredients. I heard that you’re an alchemist, while the Alldevil Star-Field is full of precious ores and rare medicinal ingredients. What is your goal in coming here?!”

Millions of experts stood at the gates of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, shouting angrily at Long Chen.

During this time, Long Chen had not made any further moves. That resulted in many people losing confidence in him. Their complaints began to pile up, and now they erupted. These millions of experts gathered to criticize him.

The higher-ups and the various leaders of the major sects were also present, watching as this group raged. Looking at this group, they couldn’t help frowning.

These people were furiously condemning Long Chen. They even accused him of being a comrade of the Alldevil race. When they accused him of trying to destroy the human race, Guo Ran and the others went green with rage.

“You pack of fools, are you courting death?!” Guo Ran roared furiously.

“You’re the one courting death! What, can we not ask questions?! If Long Chen really feels no guilt, he can step forward and explain himself!”

“We need to have a reason to trust him. We need to know the truth. What is wrong with that?”

“Long Chen, if you don’t give us an explanation, it means that your heart is guilty! This must be your scheme!”

“That’s right, it’s a sinister scheme! We have to kill Long Chen right now. He’s the greatest calamity of the human race!”

Roars rang out from within the crowd. It seemed that in their eyes, Long Chen was already labeled a sinister schemer. They were set on him being a scourge. Seeing this scene, Guo Ran was enraged.

Let alone Guo Ran… Leng Hui, Xie Liuer, Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and all the experts that cultivated the Starry River of the Sky Art were also infuriated.

Anyone who could cultivate the Starry River of the Sky Art could sense the righteousness in each other’s hearts. It could be said that even two strangers who cultivated this technique could trust each other.

Without this righteous heart, it was not possible to cultivate the Starry River of the Sky Art. Thus, their trust in Long Chen was like a solid boulder.

Because of this though, these people’s questioning and condemnation of Long Chen enraged and aggrieved them. They were about to go out into a life-and-death battle with these idiots. Could it be that they were risking their lives to protect this group of people?

Now they understood how Xia Guhong felt all that time ago. They could understand how he could abandon the Alldevil Star-Field.

“Silence!”

Long Chen looked at the furious crowd and shouted a single word, shaking their ears and causing them to fall silent.

“To tell the truth, I’ve been waiting for you a long time. If you stayed silent, I would have lost patience first.” Long Chen looked at them indifferently.

Long Chen suddenly extended a hand. After that, a shifty-eyed elder within the crowd suddenly cried out in shock. He involuntarily flew into Long Chen’s grasp.

Long Chen grabbed his neck, holding him like a chicken. The latter was powerless to resist and was filled with horror. “What… what are you doing?! You’re going to kill people to silence them?! As expected, you have a guilty conscience!”

“Release him!”

“Bullying an old man who’s only a Divine Lord, does that count as an ability?!”

“Long Chen, why must you silence the people?!”

“Having your scheme exposed, your shame turns into wrath?!”

The crowd instantly erupted into furious curses.

“Kill everyone who’s cursing,” said Long Chen icily.

Guo Ran had been waiting for this order. When he extended his arm, arrows shot out, perfectly striking those people right in the head. As a result, hundreds were slain in an instant.

Those were the people shouting the loudest. As soon as they died, the others jumped in horror. More of them began to curse, even more furiously than before. The worst curses came from them.

After that, another wave of arrows flew out. This time, even Leng Hui, Xie Liuer, and the others joined in. Over ten thousand people were slain, and rivers of blood flowed. Those protestors finally fell silent with horror. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Most of these people didn’t have particularly powerful cultivation bases. Most of them were old. However, they definitely had a certain level of influence. Even so, Long Chen didn’t even give them a chance to protest. Anyone who opened their mouth was slain.

The ringleaders were now slain, so the others were shocked, enraged, and horrified. But no one dared to keep cursing.

However, after this, the spectators’ expressions changed. They all felt that Long Chen’s methods were unreasonable and unnecessarily cruel. Some elders in particular had ugly expressions.

“Dean Long Chen, don’t you feel that you’re going a bit too far…?”

A sect leader opened his mouth, only for Long Chen to point a single finger at him. His body exploded.

“What?!”

Now everyone was truly shocked. That was a sect leader. Just because he said that Long Chen was going too far, he was to be slain? Everyone’s expression changed.

Long Chen then turned his attention back to the elder in his hand. He peeled the skin off of the elder’s face.

People were shocked to find that there was no blood even when his skin was off. It was actually a human-skin mask. When his true face was exposed, a sect leader cried out in shock.

“Qin Zifei?! How can you be here?! No… don’t tell me… you’re…”

That sect leader began to quiver with rage, having a bad feeling. This person had changed his appearance and disguised his cultivation base. The truth was evident.

“I…. I…” The man called Qin Zifei instantly panicked in front of that sect leader’s questioning.

Long Chen clenched his hand, tearing off that person’s head. He then tossed it to the sect leader. “I trust that you know what to do.”

That sect leader looked at the head in his hand. He clenched his teeth. “Qin Zifei, Qin Zifei. You might be my adopted son, but I always viewed you as my own child. I didn’t expect you to betray your sect and the entire human race. My eyes are blind. How did I not see that you are a beast in human form?”

Only now did people realize that the ‘elder’ was actually an early stage World King and a young man. He was clearly one of the ringleaders trying to cause trouble for the human race.

Suddenly, the void shuddered and a pillar of light covered all the protestors. There were a few figures amongst them that had been stealthily slipping away, but then they ran into that light. Countless eyes locked onto them.

“So it was you lot!” Guo Ran and the others shouted furiously. The starry river warriors instantly captured those people.

“Other than the spies, kill all the protestors.” Long Chen’s order left people in disbelief. They didn’t dare to believe their ears.
