Chapter 3090 Second Expert

When Long Chen and the others arrived, they jumped in shock. Originally, this island had a giant martial arena at the center with some spectator stands around it.

However, today, there was an even larger spectator stand built in the sky. It was shaped like a ring and floated there, surrounding the entire island. It was packed with people.

“Damn, it really is a magnificent sight,” sighed one of the Battle God Palace’s disciples.

“It’s my first time seeing so many people.” Bai Xiaole looked around at the sea of people.

The original spectator stand was for the disciples that had been eliminated. But this new one could fit dozens of times the people.

Qin Feng looked around and shook his head. “My boss has killed more people than you’ve seen.”

Bai Xiaole was very curious about Qin Feng, so he was constantly asking questions about the Dragonblood Legion. Because of this, the two of them had gotten much closer. Furthermore, Bai Xiaole also called Long Chen boss, so Qin Feng treated him as a future member of the Dragonblood Legion.

Bai Xiaole jumped in shock when he heard this. Bai Shishi and the others looked at him in disbelief.

However, after saying that, Qin Feng didn’t seem to have any intention of further explaining what he said. No matter how Bai Xiaole asked him, he didn’t say anything, making the former itchy.

Just as everyone felt like they were starting to get to know Long Chen, Qin Feng arrived. After that, they realized that they knew nothing about his past. They were fiercely curious about his experiences.

Regretfully, Long Chen never mentioned anything about his past, and Qin Feng also seemed to have no intention of revealing much. But occasionally he would randomly say something that made them itchy to know more.

Staring at Long Chen’s back, they felt it to be lean and unbending. He seemed like someone who could raise the heavens yet also someone who could topple them. Qin Feng’s arrival shrouded him in another layer of mystery.

When they entered their spectator stand, they found that this place was also different from yesterday. There was now a special area at the inner ring. It was the spectating area for today’s fighters, while the ones that had been eliminated yesterday could only watch from the other area.

Long Chen and the others arrived at their special inner ring, and there was a formation isolating them here like before. Long Chen’s jade plate quivered a few times when he entered, checking his identity.

Compared to the loud ruckus outside, this place was spacious and cozy. There were even some beautiful attendants serving tea and refreshments. It was as different as heaven and earth from the outer area.

They then sat down on their comfortable chairs, and an attendant immediately came over. “The Martial Dao competition will begin in one hour, and I came here to relax your meridians.”

This was one of the side benefits given to those who had passed the preliminaries. These women were all skilled wood cultivators, and their wood energy could help people relax their meridians, allowing them to reach a deeper level of relaxation and enter their best combat state.

“No need, thank you. Can you get me some food?” said Long Chen.

“What? Are you afraid of being too comfortable and getting a reaction?” asked Lu Mingxuan. She sat behind Long Chen, and an attendant was helping her massage her shoulders. Mist curled out of her body as the attendant helped her relax.

Long Chen ignored her. No matter how he replied, there would definitely be a trap. He didn’t want to get caught like that foolish girl Bai Shishi.

As for Bai Shishi, with her previous experience, she also didn’t say anything. In fact, she completely ignored Lu Mingxuan. After being conned once, she had learned her lesson.

The others also knew just how skilled Lu Mingxuan was and didn’t dare to say anything in reply. Hence, Lu Mingxuan giggled and fell silent, closing her eyes and relaxing.

“Long Chen, you should also relax. It’s very effective,” said Bai Shishi. This kind of meridian relaxation could allow a person to react faster in battle.

“No need. Qin Feng, you should do it as well. You need it the most out of everyone.”

When Qin Feng saw Long Chen reject it, he also rejected it. But after Long Chen said this, he joined everyone else.

Long Chen also knew the benefits of this. But he didn’t like other people’s energy entering his meridians. Although he knew that they wouldn’t harm him, it gave him an uneasy feeling.

After just a bit, Luo Ning, Luo Bing, and the others fell asleep. These wood element attendants were truly skilled.

They slowly woke up, completely refreshed. Just then, the elder from the Huayun Trading Company appeared again.

His way of speaking was the same as yesterday, concise and straightforward. First, he congratulated everyone on passing the preliminaries, then he said the same words about lacking experience in hosting and asking for everyone’s forgiveness.

After that, he got straight to the point, and the lots were drawn once more.

However, it was different from yesterday. They weren’t all transported onto the martial stage at once to fight. Instead, they entered in batches.

Countless squares then appeared on the martial stage. Every square was its own small arena.

Unlike last time when everyone was fighting on an invisible martial stage, which prevented others from seeing their moves, everything would be public this time.

On the back of everyone’s tablet was a similar design to the martial stage’s setup. There were tiny squares that corresponded to the blocks on the stage. Pressing one of those squares would cause the corresponding block to grow larger and allow them to see it clearly.

This way, everyone could see the battle without a problem, as it wouldn’t be affected by distance.

Suddenly, the fighting blocks lit up, and quite a few people were transported onto the stage. But Long Chen and the others weren’t part of this first batch.

Despite its size, there was a limit to how many people could fight on the stage at once, so everything progressed according to a sequence. Long Chen and the others needed to wait their turn.

Just as they were wondering who to watch, Qin Feng’s tablet lit up.

“So quickly?”

Everyone was startled. This meant that someone had won their battle, and Qin Feng was next. His tablet had lit up to tell him to make his preparations. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What number?” asked Long Chen.

“573.”

Just then, he vanished. Long Chen and the others quickly looked at the 573rd block.

“Not good. He’s against the Nine Flower Sect’s number two expert.” When Bai Shishi saw his opponent, her expression changed slightly.
