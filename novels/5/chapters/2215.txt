Chapter 2205 Divine Punishment

Wilde chomped down, and that incredibly tough horn that not even Evilmoon had been able to sever had a giant chunk ripped out of it.

“AHH!”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent let out a shriek. Those six horns were where his foundation lay. They were connected to his soul. Wilde eating his horns was equivalent to devouring his soul.

He struggled madly, wanting to throw Wilde from his head, but Wilde hung on to his horn, continuing to bite.

Cracking sounds rang out as another giant chunk was ripped from the horn. Wilde was like a hungry wolf that had encountered meat. Those horns contained the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s very life essence and Heavenly Dao runes.

“Bastard, get off!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent desperately dove into the ground, trying to throw Wilde off. The ground continued to explode as the two of them struggled underground.

BOOM!

Finally, the Six Horn Sea Serpent charged out of the ground, having thrown off Wilde. However, his head was covered in blood. One of his horns had vanished. He now only had five horns, and his aura had plummeted.

“Bastards, all of you just wait!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent let out a miserable cry.

The earth exploded as Wilde appeared aboveground as well. He was still holding a giant horn, having managed to rip that horn off the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

Everyone looked at Wilde like he was a monster, the Xuan Beasts especially. They were terrified.

The sea demon army began to run. The Dragonblood Legion’s numbers were not enough to stop such a huge army from fleeing. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Once the sea demon race was gone, they left behind countless giant corpses on the ground. The entire battlefield was soaked in blood.

The sea demons had come ferociously and left dejectedly. In between those two moments, they left behind a land of corpses and brought away nothing.

“The Sovereign is gone, and the sea demons have scrammed. It’s time for us to settle our grudges.” Long Chen suddenly turned to the experts of the various powers of the continent, his killing intent not having diminished at all.

When he had been tied down by the Emperors and the Dragonblood Legion had been besieged, the sea demon race had launched an attack, throwing the entire Dragonblood Legion into danger of being exterminated.

Now that the crisis had passed, it was time to return to the original plan. Long Chen’s eyes were full of icy killing intent.

The experts of Pill Valley, the Corrupt path, the ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, and the ancient family alliance all stared at him, their expressions changing.

They hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so brutal. Even now, he refused to stop.

“Long Chen, this is all a misunderstanding. Even a Sovereign has come, so the misunderstanding has been resolved. There’s no need to keep fighting amongst ourselves,” said Nangong Zuiyue.

“Yes, even the Sovereign has said that his seal will break in three months. We can’t keep killing ourselves. We have to join forces against the foreign enemies,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Both the Dragonblood Legion and their opponents were exhausted. If they continued to clash, there would definitely be horrendous casualties. Then the Martial Heaven Continent’s core forces would be too damaged to face the Blood race. If the Blood race broke through, the continent would be doomed.

“Was I the one who started this fight? No, it was some idiots who constantly targeted me. Why should I stop? Why is it that when they were trying to kill me, they didn’t think about joining forces for the continent’s safety? Why do I have to cry a single tear for their deaths? Why do I have to care about the continent? If the Sovereign hadn’t appeared, many of my brothers would have died here. Don’t talk about such sanctimonious things with me. I don’t acknowledge them. All I know is that if someone tries to kill me, then I’ll kill them. Hear me Dragonblood Legion, kill them to avenge our fallen brothers and sisters of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race!” roared Long Chen.

“Kill!”

Long Chen went straight for Dongfang Yuyang. Dongfang Yuyang was already exhausted, and when Long Chen’s saber landed on his silver shield, he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Dongfang Yuyang’s expression suddenly changed. Runes lit up all over his body. After that, a dagger appeared in midair and cut across his neck. Blood splashed.

Dongfang Yuyang’s head flew through the air. The Bloodkill Hall’s divine daughter Dong Mingyu had beheaded him.

Before this, she had been blocking the Blood Emperor, so no one had seen her true killing blows. But now, they saw that even Dongfang Yuyang was unable to resist.

However, just as Dongfang Yuyang’s head flew through the air, his head and body began to fade away.

“A clone?”

Startled cries rang out and people looked around, only to see space twist in the distance. Dongfang Yuyang appeared there. A cut on his throat was still bleeding. Although he had managed to switch places with a fake at that moment, he was still terrified by Dong Mingyu. She had attacked without him being able to sense anything. Although he had reacted instantly, his head had almost been cut off. He was pale with fright. Dong Mingyu was truly worthy of being the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one assassin.

Dong Mingyu’s figure vanished. It was impossible to sense her existence.

Dongfang Yuyang shivered and immediately summoned the Astral Ancient Castle. He fled inside, afraid of this invisible killer. The feeling that his life might be taken away at any moment was unpleasant.

Dongfang Yuyang had become a tortoise hiding in his shell, while the distant Kun Pengzi suddenly had a bad feeling. He summoned his true body, transforming into a giant Kunpeng, but a dagger still stabbed through his forehead.

Although his transformation allowed him to grow so big that this attack didn’t reach his crystal core, a terrifying divine energy poured through, making him shriek with pain.

Lightning exploded out of him, and Dong Mingyu’s small figure flew back.

Dong Mingyu had attacked twice, almost killing Dongfang Yuyang and Kun Pengzi. Such terrifying assassination arts made every expert feel a chill on their back. There was no way to defend against such a killer.

However, just as Dong Mingyu was about to continue attacking, she spat out a mouthful of blood and fell from the sky.

Long Chen had just attacked Dongfang Yuyang’s castle and was about to slam the brick into it to see if he might shatter the castle when he saw Dong Mingyu falling. He immediately flew over to her and caught her.

“Little Yu, what’s wrong?” Long Chen was shocked to find that Dong Mingyu’s aura was now in chaos. Her life energy was growing weak, and a divine mark appeared on her forehead. At first, it was golden, but now it began to turn black. It was this divine mark that was sucking away her life and soul.

“She betrayed our god! He has sensed this and sent down his divine punishment! She will suffer the pain of ten thousand poisons devouring her soul and never reincarnate!” shouted the Bloodkill Hall’s Zhong Ziyang hatefully.

Zhong Ziyang was filled with hatred but also fear. For the divine daughter to betray the Killing God was inconceivable. She had managed to slay all the elite disciples of the Bloodkill Hall. So he was now the master of an empty hall.

Considering this giant blunder, perhaps even he would be punished by the god. He was starting to get worried.

Dong Mingyu’s condition caused the rest of the Dragonblood Legion to return. As for their opponents, they retreated, feeling relieved from a heavy burden.

As for taking advantage of this moment to launch a sneak attack? Although they knew that this was their best chance, they didn’t have the guts for it.

The six twelfth rank Magical Beasts had exhausted themselves and were no longer capable of unleashing their divine abilities. But they stood guard over the Dragonblood Legion, giving off immense pressure.

Chu Yao formed hand seals, sending pure life energy into Dong Mingyu’s body. She was also transferring the energy of her Yuan Spirit into her body, helping her resist the devouring.

However, that divine mark was like a terrifying beast, constantly devouring all the energy she sent into her body. No matter how much energy she poured in, it was devoured.

Despite that, thanks to her efforts, Dong Mingyu seemed to recover ever so slightly. But she was still as pale as paper.

“Big brother Long Chen, I’m really sorry. I destroyed the Killing God’s statue so that I would have enough time to help you get rid of a few enemies, that way, I could die in peace...” Dong Mingyu was apologetic.

“Without you, we would have been killed. You’ve helped me out immensely. Also, I won’t let you die, so don’t worry...” Long Chen’s thoughts were in a whirl. Dong Mingyu now had a god’s curse on her. There was no medicine that could cure her.

Dong Mingyu shook her head and lay in Long Chen’s embrace. A satisfied expression appeared on her face. “No one cared about me ever since I was born into this world. It was like I was born to be a chess piece. Even my father and mother never cared about me. Only you actually did. Even though I was trying to kill you, you let me off. Your expression of pity is something I’ll never forget in this lifetime. From that day onward, I swore to spend this life for you. You are the true god in my heart. You are the only one who cared for me in this world and didn’t treat me as a chess piece. You are the only one and my everything.”

Dong Mingyu’s murmuring made Long Chen’s heart ache. He hadn’t really treated her all that well. At that time, she had just been an innocent child used by others. But that extremely insignificant action of his had been engraved into Dong Mingyu’s undying memory. She had even betrayed the Killing God and was now being punished.

With no one who cared about her, this little bit of care had resulted in her being willing to use her own life to repay him.

“Little Yu, don’t speak. I’ll bring you to see someone. Perhaps he can help you.” Long Chen gave Dong Mingyu a medicinal pill that could temporarily suppress the curse. “Dragonblood Legion, today’s matter will be temporarily left here. We’re leaving.”

Long Chen waved his hand, and the Dragonblood Legion jumped onto the backs of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows. Long Chen looked at the old man and the others. The old man nodded toward him, and only then did Long Chen bring his people speeding away.
