Chapter 2914 Heaven-Shaking Aura

The spear flew through the air silently. It was incredibly fast, so fast that Chu Kuang didn’t even sense it before he was hit by it.

BOOM!

Chu Kuang was sent flying once more, bouncing several more miles and leaving large holes in the ground. And all of a sudden, a figure appeared and caught the spear. That was Long Chen. He had caught up and now chased after Chu Kuang.

He was clearly intent on forcing Chu Kuang away from the altar. He wanted to fight away from it.

Chu Kuang finally stabilized himself, but not before he coughed up a mouthful of blood. Although he had the Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor protecting him, his insides were still shaken.

At the same time as people were amazed by Long Chen’s attacks, they were also amazed by the Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor. Its defensive powers were truly great.

Those two attacks of Long Chen’s were inconceivably powerful. But Chu Kuang’s Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor was still able to block both of them. His aura didn’t change. Although he coughed up blood, that little injury was nothing to him.

At this moment, Long Chen reached Chu Kuang again and stabbed his spear at him once more.

All of a sudden, a blood-colored saber appeared in Chu Kuang’s hand, and he swung it at Long Chen’s spear. But just at this moment, Long Chen released his spear, which instantly vanished when it was struck by an overwhelming power.

The feeling of having all his power be spent on smacking away a spear with no power in it threw Chu Kuang off. It was like he had struck air, and his body staggered from his own power.

After that, Long Chen spun through the air and slapped him once more, this time with even greater power. People even spotted some faint ripples in the air when Long Chen’s hand struck Chu Kuang’s face.

They then saw Chu Kuang’s face deform, and he shot out like a cannonball again, flying even further this time.

After three blows, he had been forced back dozens of miles. It was both shocking and funny.

“Big sister, what is Long Chen doing? He could clearly cause Chu Kuang real injuries. Why is he only slapping him?” asked Luo Ning. Although she did feel like Long Chen’s slaps were very satisfying, such a thing wouldn’t be able to cripple Chu Kuang.

Furthermore, it seemed he had done this just to get Chu Kuang away from the altar. In her view, this was incomprehensible.

Luo Bing shook her head. “I can’t tell either. Perhaps he hates Chu Kuang so much that he wants to humiliate him?”

“But then is he not worried about Mu Qingyun and the others?” Luo Ning couldn’t help looking toward the altar.

Although Mu Qingyun was powerful, she didn’t have much physical power as a sword cultivator, so she couldn’t fight for long. Furthermore, breaking the barrier would need even more energy. If the other side simply stalled and exhausted her, Long Chen and the others would still lose.

“Perhaps Long Chen believes in Mu Qinguyn. Well, we shouldn’t randomly guess. We can’t tell what Long Chen’s thinking. Since it’s not like we can help him anyway, just choose to trust him,” said Luo Bing. Long Chen was an incomprehensible existence. They might as well simply watch.

As Long Chen forced Chu Kuang away from the altar, Mu Qingyun and the other disciples of the Unfettered Alliance were trampling over the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples.

The latter were hand-picked experts of the Chu family. In truth, their power was more than a single level higher than the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples.

However, in the face of these fearless, reckless madmen, they were terrified.

How was this a competition? This was an undying vengeance, and they were like ghouls. Seeing the people around them being cut down one by one, the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples were too afraid to fight properly.

One of them had his arm cut off and immediately shouted, “I admit defeat!”

He then transformed into a white light and was transported out. He was safe but had lost his right to continue participating in the competition.

“Hold on! As long as we can endure, we’ll win! Mu Qingyun is almost out of power!” shouted one of the minor leaders of the Prime Glory Alliance.

He was actually stronger than most of them, but he didn’t dare to face Mu Qingyun directly. Hence, he stayed away from her, waiting for her to run out of energy.

However, that meant that no one could stop Mu Qingyun. With every slash of her sword, a disciple was killed. Those disciples didn’t even have a chance to admit defeat.

“I admit defeat!”

“I admit defeat!”

The terrified disciples of the Prime Glory Alliance simply didn’t have the morale to keep fighting. When Mu Qingyun approached, they fled. They would rather not get any reward and keep their life.

“Bastards, there’s no need to admit defeat! Retreat back into the barrier!” shouted the leader.

They couldn’t continue fighting like this. If they did, before Mu Qingyun was exhausted, all of them would be gone. Following his new orders, the remaining disciples of the Prime Glory Alliance retreated back into the barrier and finally had a chance to breathe. Mu Qingyun and the others would need to break the barrier to enter.

“Everyone, focus on lighting the lamps! We’ll grab the flag before they can break the barrier!” shouted the leader. He saw that everyone was terrified and no longer had the heart to keep fighting.

If he ordered them to go out to disturb Mu Qingyun and the others, it was unlikely that they would listen. In truth, ignoring the others, even he himself didn’t dare to do so.

Hence, all of them gathered at the core of the altar and poured in their energy.

The final two lamps had red strips at the bottom to show how much energy they had. Once it was maxed out, the flag would pop out of the altar, and whichever side grabbed it first would win. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples hunkered down inside the barrier, Mu Qingyun assaulted the barrier. But it was extremely tough, so she was unable to break it in an instant.

Watching as the progress bars on the lamps quickly advanced, it seemed that they would be done in an incense stick’s worth of time. Seeing this, Mu Qingyun grew anxious. The flag was inside the barrier. If they didn’t break the barrier, they would have no chance of obtaining it and would still lose.

“Everyone, attack!” shouted Mu Qingyun. In truth, there was no need for her order. Everyone was already attacking the barrier with all their might.

As Mu Qingyun attacked the barrier, she also looked at Long Chen’s side, feeling worried about him.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, an explosion shook the battlefield, and a vast aura soared into the sky. This immense power changed the color of the wind and clouds.
