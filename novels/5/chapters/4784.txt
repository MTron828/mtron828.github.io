Chapter 4773 Long Chen vs. Yue Wuxu

This giant sword was nine feet long and half a foot wide, with a crescent moon pattern on it. When it materialized, heaven and earth rumbled, and Saint aura erupted from it like a volcano. This had to be a powerful divine weapon with an immense history.9

Yue Wuxu pointed this sword at Long Chen. After shedding his master manipulator image, he now exuded a powerful battle will. At this moment, he was like a wild martial artist with the look of a bloodthirsty beast.2

When they saw Yue Wuxu take out his weapon, some of the senior experts whispered to their disciples, “Yue Wuxu is the Celestial race’s top heavenly genius and possesses the dual bloodlines of the Celestial race and the Waning Moon race. Having obtained the recognition of the Waning Moon race’s supreme Saint weapon, apparently he has the power to challenge a Mortal Sage King. Observe this battle carefully. The chance to watch such a battle is extremely rare.”8

“What is a Mortal Sage King?” asked some disciples. It was their first time hearing of such a name.3

The Sage King replied, “Ah, it’s a classification in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. In your world, the Eternal realm is split into three levels: Eternal, Saint, and Sage King. However, in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, there is another distinction amongst Sage Kings. The weakest are ordinary Sage Kings like the Sage Kings in your worlds. Above them are Mortal Sage Kings, Earth Sage Kings, and Heaven Sage Kings.”11

“Isn’t that the same as a Heaven Venerate, Earth Venerate, and Mortal Venerate?” inquired a disciple. The Divine Venerate was also split up in a similar manner.3

The elder shook his head and explained, “The Divine Venerate realm’s distinctions are based on innate talent and aptitude, but it is different in the Sage King realm. In the Sage King realm, you must challenge the laws of heaven and earth. If you succeed, the Heavenly Daos will bestow you with some of the power of laws. However, challenging the laws of the world is extremely dangerous. One mistake and your soul will be extinguished. Ordinary Sage Kings have only a ten percent chance of passing the Mortal Sage King tribulation. Ah, and those that fail all die. Furthermore, for a Mortal Sage King to challenge the Earth Sage King tribulation, their chances of success are only one in ten thousand. As for the Heaven Sage King realm… Well, that’s too far for you. In any case, you just need to know that a Mortal Sage King’s power is ten times greater or more than an ordinary Sage King. Remember this ‘or more’ part because ten times is only the absolute basic amount. No one can say what the upper limit is.”9

“It’s so terrifying? There’s such a huge difference between Sage Kings?”0

“If the difference wasn’t so great, do you think people would take the risk of that deathly tribulation?” sighed the elder.0

He was also nothing more than an ordinary Sage King, and he had dreamed about taking on the Mortal Sage King tribulation. However, he didn’t have the guts, as he knew that with his talent, his chances of success were far too low.0

He couldn’t help but look at the distant Yue Wuxu enviously. For a Divine Venerate disciple to have the power to challenge a Mortal Sage King, he was truly a chosen of the heavens.1Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As countless people whispered among themselves, all eyes were on Yue Wuxu of the Celestial race—an existence with a great deal of fame behind his name. Many people were familiar with his background, and those who didn’t were asking others about it.0

The Heaven Overseer gazed at Yue Wuxu and suddenly asked, “What rank do you think Yue Wuxu would place amongst the Long clan’s disciples?”0

“He should be able to enter the top ten. He possesses two bloodlines and various complementary divine abilities. He truly is strong. Based on my estimation, he should be relatively even with the rank ten of the heaven rankings, Long Ziwei. However, Long Ziwei’s weapon is a bit weaker,” answered a suntanned Sage King slowly.5

Someone else immediately argued, “Long Ziwei just went through the Sun End Volcano trial, and his divine flame Saint blade has absorbed the Sun End flame. Even if his weapon doesn't grant him a distinct advantage, it certainly shouldn't leave him at a disadvantage. On the other hand, Yue Wuxu appears to be more of a strategist. If he's constantly preoccupied with outwitting his opponents, I doubt he'd fare well against Long Ziwei.”1

Hearing this, the suntanned man didn’t argue back. Also, the Heaven Overseer only asked one question and didn’t say anything further, seemingly lost in thought.0

“Heaven Overseer, if Long Chen loses, should we save him?” asked one of them suddenly.0

He was the one who had been speaking up for Long Chen the entire time, the one who had argued with the other Sage King to the point that the latter got angry.0

“Why would we save him? He said it himself; he isn’t a member of the Long clan. Do you really have to kiss his ass?” sneered the reckless Sage King.3

“He said he isn’t because Long Xihe has done something wrong toward him. I trust in the Heavenly Sage’s son.”0

This Sage King was one of Long Zhantian’s worshippers. However, as Long Zhantian didn’t have a good relationship with the first Heavenly Sage, who was the reckless Sage King’s idol, both sides were busy bickering, defending their idols.0

“What kind of nonsense are you talking about? Long Zhantian is a stubborn and arrogant fellow. His son is even more like that. Our Long clan has countless heavenly geniuses, and we aren’t lacking him!” retorted the reckless Sage King.0

“That’s enough. How about you stop this meaningless arguing? Instead, you can gamble!” suggested the Heaven Overseer.1

“Gamble? Fine, I bet that Long Chen will definitely lose today!” said the reckless Sage King immediately.2

“You... How shameless! Yue Wuxu is a native expert of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, and Long Chen hasn’t acclimated himself to the laws of this place!”0

“I thought that you worshiped Long Zhantian? Didn’t you say that his son would follow in his footsteps? What? Do you regret it now? Alright, admit that everything you said just now was nonsense, and I can cancel this gamble.”0

“Fine, I’ll gamble with you! Since you want to play, let’s play!” declared the supportive Sage King through clenched teeth.0

“What do you want to bet?” asked the other side fearlessly.0

“We’ll gamble with each other's weapons. Also, whoever loses must kowtow three times!”0

“Alright, I agree!” The reckless Sage King didn’t hesitate to agree.0

“Heaven Overseer, do you think that this is appropriate?” asked the suntanned Sage King.0

“It’s not like both of them are my subordinates. What they do has nothing to do with me.” The Heaven Overseer shook his head, and then he pointed into the distance. “The gamble is set. Just wait for the results.”11

At this moment, Long Chen was walking toward Yue Wuxu one step at a time. All eyes in the vicinity fixated on the two of them, as everyone knew that a true battle between titans was about to commence.7
