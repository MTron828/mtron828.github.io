Chapter 3965 Princess Detention

Those guards hacked up blood, tumbling back like tumbleweeds. Their souls were almost torn apart by this one roar from Long Chen.

When the formation was broken, an even larger barrier appeared over the entire princess mansion.

However, even that formation rumbled. The immense impact caused countless cracks to appear on it. Then, in front of their stunned gazes, this second formation also shattered.

In terror, the guards stared at Long Chen, who was still holding up that red-haired man.

That red-haired man’s body was now covered in cracks, and blood poured out of his seven orifices. He was almost blown apart by that roar.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!”

Just then, Yu Qianxue’s furious voice rang out.

“Princess, save me! This Long Chen is treacherous and violent! I only wanted to exchange pointers with him, but he wants to kill me!” The red-haired man shouted fearlessly once he saw Yu Qianxue.

“Long Chen, put him down. We can talk about this nicely.” Yu Qianxue’s expression was dark. She didn’t know what had happened, but she could guess it.

“We can talk nicely? The main thing is, if you talk nicely, will people listen?” Long Chen shook his head. He then looked at the red-haired man. “I told you not to provoke nice people. Just because they’re nice, doesn’t mean that they don’t have a temper. Also, nice people have no mercy once you anger them. Let alone Princess Qianxue, even if the emperor of the Vermilion Bird Empire were to personally come, he wouldn’t be able to protect your life. Go in peace!”

“Long Chen!” Yu Qianxue was shocked.

“No!”

With a quiver of the spear, the red-haired man exploded, turning into a bloody mist that rained upon the area. This attack didn’t just destroy his physical body but also his Yuan Spirit.

The guards stared at Long Chen in horror, looking at him like he was a blood-crazed fiend.

On the other hand, Long Chen’s expression was calm without the slightest ripple. It was as if he had done nothing at all, exuding exceptionally terrifying calmness.

“I don’t have time to play such senseless games with you. Don’t waste my precious time. Unless you’re prepared to die, it would be best if you didn’t try to enrage me.” Long Chen’s gaze swept over the guards.

Long Chen had long since noticed that these guards only had high cultivation bases and talent, but their actual killing power was trash.

To put it frankly, they possessed immense power but had never set foot on a battlefield. Having not gone through the baptism of blood and fire or experienced walking the line between life and death, against true experts, they were unable to unleash even a fraction of their power before dying.

Ignoring anything else, any Dragonblood warrior from the three thousand worlds could kill them without any suspense despite not possessing that much power.

“A group of greenhouse flowers lauding each other and amusing themselves into thinking that they are important… I’ve seen plenty of people like you. You and I do not live in the same world. Your games are things that I stopped playing as a child. If you don’t want to die, stay away from me,” said Long Chen coldly.

Long Chen didn’t want to kill people, but if he didn’t, there would be no way to scare off these idiotic children. Then all kinds of challenges and roadblocks would appear in his way.

There was no way to peacefully cultivate like that. Moreover, he needed time to develop the Seven Star Battle Armor. If these people stalled him, when the real powerful enemies came, he and the people by him would definitely die miserably.

These people were now so terrified that they were like wooden chickens. As for Yu Qianxue, she was ashen with rage. Just as she was about to speak, the void quivered and a dozen Divine Venerates appeared.

Long Chen’s heart shook. These Divine Venerates were all Double Supremes and were wearing identical robes with a sword hanging on their waists. It seemed that the Vermilion Bird Empire’s foundation was truly shocking.

Their leader frowned. “Princess, how could you make such a mistake? Let’s go!”

Yu Qianxue’s countenance darkened. Filled with indignant rage, she clenched her teeth furiously. “Long Chen, just wait! Once I get back, I’ll teach you how to behave. And you lot as well!”

Yu Qianxue also pointed at her guards, causing their expressions to grow ugly. They didn’t dare to look at her.

Yu Qianxue then snorted and left with those Divine Venerates, leaving Long Chen startled. Just what was going on?

“Why is she being brought away?” asked Long Chen.

The guards simply glanced at each other, and not one person spoke.

“Are you mute? If you want to be mute, I can help you out,” threatened Long Chen.

Hearing this threat, they cleared their throats. One of them hastily said, “Reporting to senior, according to the empire’s laws, it is forbidden for a person’s mansion to cause a disturbance that affects others. When you attacked just now, the mansion’s grand formation wasn’t fully activated. Thus, the sound was too loud, causing chaos and drawing over the palace’s patrol. Therefore, the princess must be brought away… She will probably be punished with three days of detention.”

“Three days of detention?”

Long Chen was stunned. It was just a loud noise, but the punishment was three days of detention? Did the princesses of the empire not get to keep their dignity?Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Yes. The empire holds the overseer responsible, so the mistakes that the subordinates make will cause their superiors to also be punished. Perhaps others in the empire have it a bit better, but the empire’s laws are especially strict toward the imperial princes and princesses. Their punishments also far exceed that given to commoners,” explained that person.

“No wonder Yu Qianxue was so furious.” Long Chen had never dreamed that Yu Qianxue would be the one punished after he killed someone. That was a bit funny.

He wondered how many times he could send her there before she dismissed him. Long Chen suddenly had an evil thought.

Just as he did, another group of experts came. They were stronger than the current guards here.

Amongst them were several familiar faces. They were those that Long Chen had seen following Yu Qianxue, so they were most likely her trusted aides.

These experts had ugly expressions and glared at Long Chen silently. Now that their boss was brought away, they had no leader.

Just like that, Long Chen waited in the princess mansion for three days. As expected, after three days, Yu Qianxue came back, and her expression was rather frightening. It was like she was going to eat someone.

However, when she arrived, she saw that Long Chen was in the residence she had arranged for him, enjoying a luxurious breakfast. He was actually eating with gusto. When Yu Qianxue and her guards arrived, he didn’t even look at them, instead focusing on his food.

“Long Chen, don’t you need to give me an explanation?!”

After a moment, Yu Qianxue couldn’t hold back anymore and shouted, her voice full of fury. That ominous gaze in her eyes was like she was going to start her breakfast by eating Long Chen.
