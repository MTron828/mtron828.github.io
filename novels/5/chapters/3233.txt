Chapter 3222 Saber Teller

Long Chen then sent his saber piercing forward. Sparks flew as the tips of two sabers collided.

The tip was the sharpest part of the saber. To use such a small surface area to block an opponent’s attack was crazy. If others were present, they wouldn’t be able to believe it.

Luo Zichuan attacked without any warning. Every time, Long Chen was forced to rely on his sense of danger and immense combat experience to tell where the attack was coming from.

Sometimes, he was clearly grasping where the attack would land, but he wouldn’t be able to tell what kind of path it would take. So he was always flustered when he blocked.

This time, it was different. He was focused on sensing the world and saw a completely different world. He felt like this world was under his control.

The moment Luo Zichuan attacked, Long Chen grasped the orbit of his attack, and the tip of his saber perfectly stopped him.

Luo Zichuan looked at Long Chen with a touch of praise in his violet eyes. “Not bad. Conceit has its good points as well. Once you comprehend something, you won’t doubt it. It can be said that you have grasped it.”

Only now did Long Chen understand that this grandfather of his had never wanted to kill him from the start. He had been using his own method to teach Long Chen what the Saber Dao was, and what the Heavenly Daos were.

If Luo Zichuan truly wanted to kill Long Chen, that last attack of his would have been impossible to dodge. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Many thanks, family head.”

Long Chen put away his saber and bowed to Luo Zichuan. He was completely convinced by this terrifying grandfather of his.

Today, he learned what it meant for there to be a heaven beyond the heavens. Thinking of how he had thought that he was unrivaled within the same realm, he had truly been as naive as a frog at the bottom of a well.

Luo Zichuan looked at Long Chen with mixed emotions. “You’re foolish sometimes, yet intelligent other times. You’re wise sometimes, yet impetuous at others. You’re a mix of contradictions. I see light in your eyes but also darkness. There are too many variables on you that make people uneasy. To tell the truth, if it weren’t for this saber, there’s an eighty percent chance that I would have killed you.”

“Are you still bothered by the bloodline problem?” Long Chen’s anger flowed once more. In the end, Luo Zichuan still didn’t acknowledge him.

Luo Zichuan nodded. “Your violet blood has withered. I used my own violet qi to press you to the border of death, but your violet blood didn’t react at all. No matter how great your talent, no matter how stunning your cultivation technique, without the violet blood, it still means nothing when it comes to the Violet Blood race. Do you know? If you had the violet blood, then as you grew, it would cause a resonance with the entire family’s bloodline. On your own, you would be able to lead the entire Luo family to glory. This is the only chance of my Luo family rising before this time of peace comes to an end.”

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. His Supreme Blood was in Long Aotian’s body. He hadn’t killed him on the Martial Heaven Continent, leaving him alive as a tracker that could help Long Chen search for his father.

If he did find Long Aotian later, he wondered if he could reclaim his Supreme Blood. Long Chen suddenly had a grand hope. He rejoiced that he hadn’t directly killed Long Aotian back then.

“What does that have to do with your saber?” asked Long Chen.

“This saber was given to me by a mysterious Saber Teller. At that time, my Luo family was in crisis. I asked him what the price was, and his answer was that in the future, my descendant had to go find him. After obtaining this Violet Fern, I awakened my violet pupils and violet blood power. I defeated the enemies surrounding us, settling the internal and external troubles, stabilizing the Luo family. That person never appeared again though. Even after all these years, there hasn’t been the slightest trace of him. But when you entered the Luo family, Violet Fern let out a rumble. I knew that you are the descendant that the Saber Teller spoke of. A person must keep their promises. That Saber Teller allowed me to save the Luo family, so I naturally can’t kill you,” said Luo Zichuan.

Long Chen was astonished by this. There was actually such a story?

Saber Tellers. Long Chen had seen legends about them in the academy’s ancient texts. They bestowed precious sabers to people in urgent need and always forecast something that would occur. When that prophecy occurred, the Saber Teller would once more appear to fulfill the initial promise.

Saber Tellers were mysterious existences. There were many legends about them in history, but there were no true records about them. That was because Saber Tellers were related to the secrets of heaven and earth. Thus, they could not be recorded. What was known about them was simply their ability to give prophecies and that they would lend sabers. Their promises must be fulfilled, or calamity would descend.

The Saber, the Dao, the Follower. To use the Saber is to follow the Dao. No Followers, no Dao, the Heavens collapse. With Followers, one with the Dao, the Heavens at peace.

This was the only true record regarding Saber Tellers that he had read in those ancient texts. Everything else was just legend.

Long Chen had always thought that those Saber Tellers were nothing more than legends. After all, he refused to believe that there was really such a thing as prophecy in this world. Hence, he hadn’t expected such a thing to actually occur to him.

This Saber Teller had come during Luo Zichuan’s youth. At that time, Luo Zichuan hadn’t reached the Immortal King realm, nor had he married and had children. How did the Saber Teller know that after so many years, a youth that ascended from the lower plane would come to the Luo family? That was all so bizarre that he couldn’t possibly believe that it was a coincidence.

Just how did Luo Zichuan know this? Would he make such a mistake? There was also no way that he would bother making up such a lie. Thus, Long Chen was bewildered.

“Alright, since you are the one that the Saber Teller forecast, that means that his prophecy has come true. I cannot kill you. Right now, I’m going to really start attacking. If you are killed now, that simply means that this is all a misunderstanding. I won’t be holding back with the next attacks. Whether you live or die is up to how tough your life is.”

Luo Zichuan’s saber rumbled and violet qi exploded out of it. After that, battle intent soared, and a sharp will locked onto Long Chen.

“Why do we have to keep fighting?” asked a startled Long Chen.

“Do you think that you’ve really comprehended the Saber Dao? You’re a long way off. If you want to be my grandson, you must have the power that I approve of. I will transmit my life’s teachings to you. Comprehend it if you can. If you can’t, you will be killed.” Luo Zichuan once more became cold, his eyes emotionless.

“Then I’ll ask the family head for some pointers!”

Long Chen’s own battle intent soared. Against a powerful expert, he didn’t get discouraged at all. He thirsted to get stronger.

“Kill!”

Luo Zichuan and Long Chen shouted at the same time. It was like two claps of thunder. One old and one young expert charged at each other.
