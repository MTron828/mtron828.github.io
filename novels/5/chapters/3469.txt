Chapter 3458 Who Runs Out of Patience First

That aura was that of the devil sea. They were sea demons from the depths of the sea, but they didn’t possess the aura of demonic beasts. Instead, they possessed devil qi.

These deep sea fiend devils that appeared were at least in the early stage Immortal King realm. But there were some strong ones that had reached the half-step World King level.

An ominous and frightening aura struck the disciples in the face when they appeared.

At this moment, a heaven-shaking roar rang out from a half-step World King drake. It was like an order, and following its roar, countless deep sea fiend devils charged at the seventh branch academy.

Those devil experts that came from the devil world didn’t clash with them. They intentionally opened up a path for them to attack the academy.

“As expected, it really is just like the dean said. The attack on the main academy is nothing more than a front. Their real goal is the seventh branch academy.” Long Chen sneered with contempt.

These deep sea fiend devils were only putting on an act in the Heavenly Swell Domain. The main force was here.

However, this place was quite some distance away from the devil sea, and these fiend devils were greatly weakened once they left the devil sea. Were they coming just to give Long Chen money?

Their devil crystals and devil cores were all treasures. The devil cores in particular were very valuable. Were they worried that the seventh branch academy was lacking money?

Bai Shishi immediately shot toward them. With a slash of her sword, golden light lit up, and that roaring drake was cut in two. Even a half-step World King deep sea fiend devil was unable to stop a single strike from that sword. 

Previously, although the golden sword had recognized Bai Shishi as master, Bai Shishi had not been able to unleash its true power. But after obtaining the inheritance of its old master, she was finally able to activate the golden sword’s runes. That drake’s scales gave it a defensive power comparable to a King item, but the scales were still unable to stop this sword.

The golden sword-light was incomparably sharp. The waves it unleashed cut through these giant deep sea fiend devils like they were radishes.

One with her sword, Bai Shishi slaughtered those devils until she gradually started to push them further and further away from the academy.

“Don’t go too far. They have experts keeping an eye that far out, so your current position is the limit. Don’t go any further. But you also don’t need to be in a rush to come back. Just keep killing them like this, slowly retreating. Don’t let them see through you.” Just then, Long Chen’s voice rang out in Bai Shishi’s ear.

Bai Shishi was startled. She didn’t sense anyone watching her, but she trusted Long Chen. Just at that moment, a half-step World King fiend devil sneak attacked her, causing her to be forced back slightly. She then continued killing the devils around that area.

Long Chen smiled slightly. When this girl actually listened, she was very likable. 

Seeing Long Chen’s smile, she replied with her own smile. But when she saw her mother staring at her with a certain expression, she turned red and instantly turned her face away, ignoring Long Chen and the others to kill the fiend devils.

Bai Shishi was the main force on the battlefield now. Whatever area was struggling, she would charge over. This battle continued for ten days and nights just like that, but she wasn’t the slightest bit tired. Clearly, a battle on this level was not extraneous enough for her. She could replenish whatever energy she used.

Other than Bai Shishi, everyone else needed to occasionally return and rest a bit. Any time they dropped down to just fifty percent of their spiritual yuan, they took a break. Otherwise, they would be in trouble if they encountered danger.

Qin Feng and Qi Yu took three breaks during these ten days. The rest of the time was spent on the battlefield, as they were in charge of the tempo of the battlefield. Only once things started growing out of control would they have Bai Shishi come help.

However, unexpectedly, Xu Zixiong would fight for three hours and then immediately return for a break. His power was astonishing. Every blow shattered the void. But after only a bit, he would run out of energy and return.

“Boss, is there something wrong with me? I don’t have any endurance anymore.”

Xu Zixiong eventually went to ask Long Chen about this. He was panting, and he sat on the ground, soaked in sweat. He seemed to be on the verge of collapse.

This time in particular, he had only been able to fight for an hour before running out of energy and returning. Although his newfound power was delightful, the lack of endurance made it hard for him to be happy about it.

Long Chen checked his body. His Blood Qi was still thrumming powerfully, so there was no problem. Such a situation should not occur, no? It had to be known that Xu Zixiong was not even fighting with the Barbarian Blood Battle Body yet. It shouldn’t be this exhausting.

Long Chen suddenly had a thought and pulled in a giant eight-clawed fish monster. Flames flew out of his hand, instantly cooking the fish. After that, a fragrant smell came out.

Saliva instantly gushed out of Xu Zixiong’s mouth. He couldn’t even stop it.

“You didn’t eat any meat. Try eating some meat this time.”

Xu Zixiong instantly latched onto the fish. As expected, after eating just a few mouthfuls, he was no longer so exhausted. Long Chen found the problem.

With the awakening of his Barbarian blood, Xu Zixiong could not walk his original cultivation path. Just like Wilde, he needed to eat meat. Just now, it wasn’t that he was out of energy but that he was exhausted from starvation.

Xu Zixiong had always been cultivating according to the human race’s standards. He relied on absorbing spiritual qi and rarely ate anything. So, the sensation of hunger had already been forgotten.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Now that he ate something, he knew that it wasn’t that he was out of energy. He was simply starving.

Long Chen then took out a copper furnace. This was a fire attribute weapon and wasn’t a pill furnace. Long Chen gave it to Xu Zixiong.

He taught Xu Zixiong how to use it to cook these sea demons. When their corpses were drawn inside, they would be quickly cooked and stored so that he could conveniently eat them to replenish his energy.

After just a bit, Xu Zixiong felt like he was full of power. With Long Chen’s copper furnace, he shot through the battlefield, gathering the corpses of the more powerful sea demons as his food.

Now that he wasn’t hungry anymore, he was like an entirely different person. With three strikes of his rod, a half-step World King tortoise had its shell broken. That fierceness made Long Chen think of Wilde.

Wilde was a pureblooded member of the Barbarian race. His energy was replenished by eating food, not immortal spiritual qi. But his power was definitely the most terrifying of all the lifeforms that Long Chen had ever seen.

“I wonder how that foolish brother of mine is doing.” Long Chen sighed. This foolish brother of his could easily be conned and tricked by others.

Wilde was just different. Xu Zixiong didn’t have Wilde’s digestive abilities and couldn’t devour those sea demons in giant quantities, so he ate much slower.

Time passed and mountains of corpses piled up once more. Just as they seemed like they would drown the academy, Long Chen cleaned up the battlefield again. The corpses were then tossed into the primal chaos space, and Lei Linger transformed into millions of knives that cut open the corpses, taking out their devil cores and devil crystals.

As a result, another small mountain of devil crystals and devil cores fell to the ground. Long Chen looked into the distance and sneered.

“Let’s see who runs out of patience first.”
