Chapter 3663

In the misty area, the water was as flat as a mirror, and the mist restricted their vision as well as dampened any sounds. It was so quiet that it was chilling.

Long Chen’s group of three slowly entered the mist. When they did, Long Chen’s spiritual perception was pushed as far as he could. He didn’t dare to be careless.

“Wait. We’ll enter the sensing range of their formation if we go any further.” Xia Chen suddenly stopped. He was holding a formation disc. “Boss, Guo Ran, put these concealment talismans on your bodies. That way, the formation will not be able to sense us.”

Xia Chen took out three talismans. He passed two of them to Long Chen and Guo Ran, while putting one on his own body.

“I can still see you. Is it not working?” Guo Ran saw that there was no change even once Xia Chen put on the talisman.

“This Body Concealing Talisman specifically blocks formations from sensing you. If you’re talking about those concealing talismans that make you invisible to the naked eye, then you’ll need to take off your clothes,” said Xia Chen irritably.

“Really, there’s such a talisman? Then give me a few!” said Guo Ran excitedly.

“What do you want those for?” asked Xia Chen questioningly.

“Cough, nothing, nothing. I’m just curious. Don’t look at me like that! Fine, I don’t want any then.” Guo Ran saw Xia Chen looking at him disdainfully and felt a bit guilty.

The three of them stuck on the talismans and continued forward. Xia Chen kept his formation disc out, constantly keeping an eye on it. It not only gave him information on the enemy formations, but it also made sure that they didn’t get lost.

It had to be known that this sea of mist’s space was chaotic, making it very easy to lose their direction. Ordinary experts would have great difficulty ever leaving once they entered the mist.

However, even after traveling for a couple of hours, everything was still calm. There was nothing other than the eerily quiet sea. The three of them weren’t moving quickly though. They continued onward slowly.

The deeper they went, the denser the mist grew. Their vision got increasingly limited. Now, they could only see a few dozen meters ahead of them. To a cultivator, that was almost like being blind. It made them feel stifled and uneasy.

Long Chen’s divine sense was originally spread as far as he could, but he then found that this mist was rapidly using up his energy, so he stopped spreading his divine sense. He just left it all to Xia Chen.

“There’s someone up ahead.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Almost half a day later, Xia Chen suddenly whispered. Long Chen then spread his divine sense and instantly sensed some spiritual fluctuations.

“To the right, around six hundred miles ahead, there’s someone kneeling on the edge of an island. Their cultivation base is between the seventh and eighth Heavenstage of the Divine Lord realm,” said Xia Chen.

“Let’s take a look.”

The three of them stealthily crept forward. As expected, they saw an island, and a figure appeared on Xia Chen’s formation disc.

It was a masked and cloaked figure silently blending into a large tree. He was completely motionless, and his aura was merged with the environment. Without the formation disc, they might not have noticed his existence even if they walked right past him.

“Is it a sentry?”

Guo Ran was startled. Theoretically, they were still quite far from the actual important area.

Long Chen shook his head. “It doesn’t seem to be the case. If it was a sentry, his body wouldn’t be so stiff, and his Blood Qi circulation wouldn’t be so quick. He seems very nervous. Unless of course, he has already noticed us.”

“Impossible. I’ve shielded us from the spying of all formations and concealed our auras. At this distance, it is impossible that he noticed us first,” guaranteed Xia Chen.

“Let’s stop here and just watch for a while,” said Long Chen.

The three of them hid in the dark, silently observing that person. After several breaths, that person suddenly moved, shooting toward a rock like a bolt of lightning.

After that, blood splashed and a human head flew through the air. Another person in identical robes had his head cut off.

Long Chen and the others were startled. Were there others like them that had snuck into the sea of mist?

After slaying that person, the first person took something and then shot away, vanishing within the mist.

Once everything was calm, Long Chen and the others stealthily crept over to the side of that dead person. They found that it was another disciple of the Nine Underworld Hall that was slain by that other fellow.

Long Chen pressed a finger on that person’s head. His soul had just dissipated and Long Chen managed to grasp a few images.

“Tablet… trial… by fire…”

Long Chen came to a sudden understanding. They had arrived just in time for the Nine Underworld Hall’s trial by fire. The location of the trial was precisely this sea of mist.

There were currently millions of assassins undergoing trial within this sea region. Every single one of them held a tablet.

In order to pass this trial, they had to have nine tablets from others. In other words, of ten people, nine must be killed for one to advance.

Nine tablets was the minimum standard. Ninety tablets was outstanding, and if someone could obtain nine hundred tablets, they could directly enter the final trial region, skipping all the other trials.

Long Chen couldn’t obtain much more information as that person’s soul had dissipated. But just this much was very helpful.

“We came at a good time. Take this person’s clothes and mask. We’ll also join this trial. We’ll see if fake assassins like us can also pass the trial.” Long Chen smiled mischievously.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen instantly got excited. Guo Ran put on the clothes, while Xia Chen began inscribing talismans based on that person’s Blood Qi. With those talismans, their Blood Qi fluctuations would be almost identical. Even the Nine Underworld Hall’s experts wouldn’t be able to sense any difference.

The three of them quickly found more corpses and took their clothes and masks for themselves. Then adding on Xia Chen’s talismans onto their masks, their auras were perfectly covered. Even they couldn’t recognize each other any longer.

With these disguises, the three of them brazenly swaggered deeper into the mist. In order to not draw attention, they split up but maintained a certain distance so that they could keep track of each other. The three of them moved in one direction.

BOOM!

A sneak attacker attacked Guo Ran, only to be blown apart by a single punch. However, the huge explosion made Xia Chen and Long Chen jump.

“You have to hit lighter. You’re an assassin now. Don’t make such a ruckus!” Xia Chen sent an exasperated message to Guo Ran.

This fellow still thought that they were outside and he could simply punch the Nine Underworld Hall’s assassins to death. His power pierced through the very earth, and it was far too conspicuous. Was that the work of an assassin?

Guo Ran hastily apologized. He had forgotten that he was now an assassin. The last attack had purely been instinct.

Long Chen and Xia Chen glared at this fool, wanting to beat him. Fortunately, they were still in the outer regions. If they were at the core, they would definitely be exposed. This fellow just didn’t think.

Most hateful of all, he had actually used his Supreme Bone’s power, destroying that person’s body, along with his tablet. They didn’t get anything from it.

In order to avoid a ruckus, the three of them stayed where they were for a long while. Seeing that no other experts had been disturbed and were rushing over, they continued entering deeper.

“Xia Chen, be careful!”

Guo Ran suddenly sent Xia Chen a message. At some unknown point, a strange figure had appeared behind Xia Chen.
