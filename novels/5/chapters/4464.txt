Chapter 4453 Earth Spirit Divine Seal

Long Chen hadn’t expected Ye Ling to take action now. Furthermore, sacred light was flowing around her, and her aura was completely different from before. Bathed in a Saint’s divine radiance, she stood no weaker than the nether dragon race leader.

Had Ye Ling recovered her Saint power? How was that possible? Long Chen turned back and looked in the direction of the Dragonblood Legion.

There, he saw Little Crane dancing, and her three aunts were surrounding her, their hands clasped in front of them as if they were praying.

Long Chen instantly understood. They were using the rainbow crane race’s divine blessing to temporarily restore Ye Ling’s Saint power despite the suppression of the Heavenly Daos.

BOOM!

The nether dragon race leader struck the snow-white shield. With an explosive sound, the shield exploded, while his attack was stopped.

“You dare to block me?! Courting death!”

The nether dragon race leader was enraged. With him wanting to save his own son, no one could stop him.

Ye Ling had anticipated that the shield alone wouldn’t suffice. Swiftly forming hand seals, she summoned enormous leaves that filled the sky, enveloping the nether dragon race leader.

The massive leaves swiftly wound around him, forming multiple layers until he was thoroughly ensnared and trapped.

“Earth Spirit Heavenly Prayer! With the manifestation of the holy spirit, all things will turn to dust, and the laws will nourish all spirits! I beseech the heavens to unleash the supreme divine energy! Earth Spirit Divine Seal!” Ye Ling intoned with piety. As she chanted, millions of ethereal images materialized behind her, all resembling her.

They were just illusions that echoed her chants. Sacred sounds filled the world as the illusions joined her in the divine invocation.

“You are courting death! Let me out of here, or I’ll destroy your entire race!” Within those green leaves, the nether dragon race leader roared furiously. However, it felt like his voice was coming from a distant world, sounding indistinct.

Cracks appeared in those layers of leaves, as the nether dragon race leader was trying to break them and escape. Those leaves didn’t look like they would last much longer.

However, Ye Ling remained composed and continued her chant. Suddenly, divine light poured forth from heaven and earth. As it descended upon the leaves, runes manifested on their surface.

These runes seemed imbued with life, interconnecting to form runic chains. Following peculiar paths along the leaves, the runic chains intricately shaped multiple seals.

A sacred energy then flowed throughout heaven and earth. In front of this vast sacred energy, people felt an unprecedented shock.

Previously, the battle between Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao had been remarkable, but compared to a clash between Saints, it was akin to a stream compared to a sea. The disparity was immense.

Even though she had managed to seal the nether dragon race leader, Ye Ling didn’t dare to relax. She continued to chant, supporting the seals.

Those seals were constantly being reinforced and broken apart. It went without saying that the nether dragon race leader was exerting all his might to break free from within.

However, Ye Ling had made her move first, and so she had the initiative. Temporarily, the nether dragon race leader remained unable to escape.

“Damn! Save the race leader!”

The nether dragon race’s experts had never expected their leader to be captured the moment he entered the fray. Ye Ling’s power had clearly been stripped away by the Heavenly Daos, so how did she restore it? They were unable to figure it out for a while.

“Only the race leader can use the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest! We can’t beat a Saint ourselves!” exclaimed one of their Eternal experts.

The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was their most potent killing item, but only their race leader possessed the ability to control it. With him now ensnared, this formidable trump card became nothing more than a decorative element, stripped of its efficacy.

“Ignore the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Just attack that woman! As long as we can distract her, the race leader will be able to escape on his own!”

“We should send a few people to sneak attack those dancing girls. The recovery of that woman’s power is definitely related to them! We’ll pull the rug out from under them!”

“No, they’re rainbow cranes. If we were to kill them, it would enrage the Heavenly Daos, and our nether dragon race’s karmic luck would be stripped away. In the end, we’d still be doomed.”

“We’re just going to interrupt their ritual! There’s no need to kill them. Are you stupid?”

“What are you old idiots doing? You’re just talking instead of fighting? Young Master Tianzhao is going to be slain!”

The one talking was a member of the junior generation. Hearing their seniors just discussing what to do, he lost his patience and shot toward the battlefield.

Right at this moment, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s miserable scream rang out. Long Chen had lost his best chance to kill Netherdragon Tianzhao due to the nether dragon race leader’s attack. However, with Ye Ling sealing him, Long Chen once more shot after Netherdragon Tianzhao, shattering his dragon claw with a punch.

Seeing this scene, the nether dragon race’s experts were in a panic. In the end, they clenched their teeth, and countless people flooded toward Long Chen.

They knew that their race leader wasn’t in danger. However, if Long Chen were to kill Netherdragon Tianzhao, the race leader would be enraged, and they would have to deal with his wrath. They didn’t want that.

“Die!”

The nether dragon race’s experts moved with incredible speed. Just as Long Chen was about to unleash a fatal punch on Netherdragon Tianzhao, his fist collided with a black barrier.

BOOM!

That barrier exploded, and dozens of the nether dragon race’s Eternal experts spat out blood at the same time.

At this critical moment, they used the divine ability of the nether dragon race to block Long Chen’s attack through space.

However, Long Chen was in his Seven Star Battle Armor state, so the power of his punch instantly delivered a massive backlash to the nether dragon race’s experts, making them truly comprehend his terror.

During this momentary pause, Netherdragon Tianzhao seized the opportunity to flail his tail, intending to escape. He was about to get away when Long Chen roared, “Where do you think you're going?!”

Long Chen’s fingers, resembling hooks, snatched onto Netherdragon Tianzhao’s tail, and his astral power surged through him as he dragged Netherdragon Tianzhao back.

Just as the nether dragon race’s experts were charging forward, Long Chen shouted and, astonishingly, swung the enormous Netherdragon Tianzhao toward them.
