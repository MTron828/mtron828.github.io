Chapter 1970 Screened From the Heavens?

Following that voice that caused countless hearts to wildly pound, everyone saw a black-robed Long Chen walk in.

The current Long Chen was extremely calm. He had no fear, nor anger. The only expression on his face was disdain toward his enemies.

Even though this place had gathered the top powers of the entire continent, he was looking down on them. He was walking casually like he was strolling through his own backyard.

Long Chen had really come. The experts who had gathered as spectators knew that something major was about to occur today.

Last time, because of Long Chen, a war had almost erupted throughout the continent. However, he had escaped, and Qu Jianying had expelled him from the Martial Heaven Alliance, resulting in that war not occurring.

Some praised Qu Jianying for her foresight and judgment as well as how she thought about the lives of this world.

However, the rest called her powerless and weak, letting her own disciple suffer without standing up for him. They said that she had lost her domineering manner and was no longer fit to be a leader.

Last time, the war was avoided because Long Chen had escaped. But now, he had come to a place where the top experts of every major power had gathered. How would he be able to escape this time?

This place was a nest of monsters, but he had still thrown himself in. Furthermore, this nest was created because of him.

There was no way his enemies would let him leave alive. If he died, what would the Martial Heaven Alliance do? 

If he died and the Martial Heaven Alliance didn’t do anything about it, they would lose all their supporters. Those people had seen how much Long Chen had done for the Martial Heaven Alliance. 

So if he died, the Martial Heaven Alliance would be forced to go to war. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to keep their people.

Today, even the four Grand Elders of the Martial Heaven Alliance had come. They were sitting behind Qu Jianying, looking like statues. But everyone knew that those four possessed the power to destroy heaven and earth before they died.

Right now, Long Chen would decide the fate of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!”

Countless young disciples stood up, shouting toward him. There were hundreds of thousands of them, some of them so emotional that they cried. The most emotional ones were those that had fought alongside him in the Yin Yang World.

They had managed to comprehend the life and death tide in the Yin Yang World thanks to the Dragonblood Legion’s protection. Because of it, they had advanced to the Life Star realm without the slightest difficulty.

This was thanks to Long Chen, thanks to the Dragonblood Legion, and thanks to their fellow comrades who had sacrificed themselves to protect them. They would never forget this.

They had been the most furious ones when Long Chen was expelled. Some of them had also wanted to leave the Martial Heaven Alliance because of it.

Seeing Long Chen now, it was like they had returned to the Yin Yang World, when they had fought alongside him. Their voices raged like thunder.

“Long Chen is irreplaceable.” Seeing Long Chen cause such a reaction just by arriving, Ye Lingshan smiled bitterly. She knew that no matter how she turned out, she would never compare to Long Chen in this regard.

“You’ll have to work hard. Because you are a woman, you have to work harder to show that you won’t lose to any man,” comforted Qu Jianying.

However, Qu Jianying was also amazed by Long Chen’s charisma, which was irresistible to both men and women. His wild nature and his guts to risk his life for others without hesitation made others also willing to do the same for him.

She suspected that these people possessed such a level of loyalty to him that as long as he beckoned, they would go fight to the death with him.

“Fuck, being a show-off without even trying is so cool.” Mo Nian sighed. Just how was it that Long Chen received such a welcome, while he was practically overlooked?

When he had come, although he had also caused a disturbance, that had just been jeering and cursing, not this worshipful display. How was the difference between them so great?

“Brothers, after today, we can have a real match. There’s no leaving until we’re all drunk, and even when we’re all drunk, there will be no leaving!”

Long Chen cupped his fists toward those disciples. His response was a heroic roar from those disciples.

“Hmph, you won’t be living past today.”

True Immortal Jiaoqi’s icy voice rang out. He was already standing and pointing his halberd at Long Chen.

Long Chen ignored him, not even glancing in his direction. He first bowed to Qu Jianying. “Alliance head, sorry for the trouble. I was the one who left the Martial Heaven Alliance, but I made you carry the burden. I will go apologize at your door another day.”

Hearing this, quite a few people looked at Qu Jianying with surprise. Long Chen was the one who had wanted to leave the Martial Heaven Alliance? People didn’t quite believe it. Was Long Chen lying to help out Qu Jianying?

“The reason I left the Martial Heaven Alliance is because I am establishing my own power. Starting today, my Dragonblood Legion is joining the ranks of the major powers on the continent as the number one legion of this world. So I’d like everyone who has come here today to bear witness to this. Today, this world will be losing a Heavenly Fate Island but gaining a Dragonblood Legion,” announced Long Chen.

“How brazen. It seems you’ve already gone insane. My Heavenly Fate Island has been standing for countless years. We’ve borne witness to the rise and fall of the continent. How could a little brat like you do anything to us?” sneered the Unfettered Allseer.

Long Chen looked at him and smiled. That smile seemed to be a mix of disdain and pity.

“Don’t focus your gazes on me. First, you should look up.” Long Chen pointed toward the sky.

“What? He plans on undergoing tribulation here?” Mo Nian looked up and jumped in shock. At some point, black tribulation clouds had started to slowly revolve in the sky. There was a majestic energy growing within those clouds that made everyone feel uneasy.

Daoist Heavenly Feather looked up at those black clouds, a touch of shock appearing in her eyes. However, she didn’t say anything.

“Hahaha, how laughable! I know you’ve used this method before, but did you think that Heavenly Fate Island was defenseless? I’ll tell you the truth. This Heavenly Fate Platform that we’re on has the innate ability to screen us from the very heavens! Otherwise, cultivators of fate would have been locked down by the heavens and turned to dust for our defiant actions. To think that you didn’t even know this yet wanted to use lightning tribulation against us. Let alone you, even a Netherpassage expert’s tribulation would be screened off. Now that you know this, you can die in peace,” laughed the Unfettered Allseer.

Suddenly, all of Heavenly Fate Island shook, and pillars of light shot out of the platform that they were on. The light condensed into a giant barrier around all of Heavenly Fate Island.

“Haha, do you see? Your little tricks are nothing,” sneered the Unfettered Allseer.

Following the arrival of the barrier, the black clouds slowly dissipated. Long Chen looked at the sky calmly without replying.

“What? Have you been dumbfounded? Hurry up and come face your death!” This time, it was Huo Lieyun speaking. The flame runes in his eyes revolved.

“Long Chen, don’t worry. If heavenly tribulation is no good, then we can just use the blades in our hands to kill them!” said the old man.

“That’s right. Even though I’m called a butcher, I haven’t slaughtered pigs in a long time,” added Tu Qianshang.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we’re willing to fight to the death with you!”

Even the Life Star disciples joined in, all of them raising their weapons, their auras rising.

Seeing that scene, Yu Xiaoyun smiled faintly. This was precisely the result that he had wanted.

However, at this moment, Long Chen waved his hand dismissively. “A little Heavenly Fate Island doesn’t require all of you to fight. Just watch patiently. Of course, having a few cups of wine and a few snacks will make the show more enjoyable. Heavenly Fate Island claims to be able to read the heavens, to read life, and to read death, but I believe all of that to be bragging. They are just a group of conmen. Today, I’ll expose their true faces.”

It was like something had shattered within Long Chen’s body. A majestic aura surged out.

A gust of wind unfurled with Long Chen at its center. The wind was like knives scraping against their faces.

“What a powerful aura!”

Startled cries rang out, but that wasn’t all. Long Chen’s aura was only growing stronger. People had no choice but to defend against it with their spiritual yuan.

“He’s just attacking the Life Star realm! How can his aura be so powerful?!” Even the Netherpassage experts were stunned.

This was merely the final bottleneck, but this aura was ten times greater than most Life Star experts.

As his aura grew, space rumbled. A terrifying pressure crashed down and surged through Heavenly Fate Island.

“Hmph, it’s useless. Within this formation, the heavens cannot find you. The tribulation cannot sense…” The Unfettered Allseer came to a sudden stop, his smile becoming rigid. He then slowly looked up, his expression changing.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
