Chapter 3181 Peak Rank Heavenly Dao Rune

These Heavenly Dao runes were split into seven ranks which were represented by seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, and violet.

Azure corresponded to the fifth rank, and that was already a very high rank. If an ordinary person grasped a rune of that level, they would be smiling even in their dreams.

The higher the rank was, the more difficult it was to grasp. Ordinary experts were only able to grab second and third rank runes. It was because runes above the fourth rank would conceal themselves and might dodge. Moreover, there wasn’t enough time to chase after them.

Thus, these disciples burst into cheers when they saw azure light. However, just as they started cheering, they stopped. The light in Bai Shishi’s hand vanished.

“What?”

Everyone was left dumbfounded, but they quickly realized that Bai Shishi had actually abandoned that rank five Heavenly Dao rune. She didn’t choose to absorb it.

“No way! Even the fifth rank isn’t enough to satisfy her?!”

Time passed bit by bit, and everyone’s nerves only grew tenser. Half the time was up. The first time, the rune fled. The second time, she abandoned the rune. Then she stopped trying, leaving everyone in suspense.

“Does she want to choose a metal energy rune? Or is she choosing a spiritual energy rune?” asked Long Chen.

“An ordinary metal cultivator would choose a spiritual energy rune first. Metal energy possesses overwhelming sharpness, and without a powerful Spiritual Strength, there’s no way to control it. Just having powerful metal energy but lacking the powerful soul energy to control it is meaningless. However, Shishi has a stubborn character. She likes that sharpness and would rather attack than defend. Thus, she is choosing metal energy for her first rune,” answered Bai Shishi’s mother.

Her voice contained a hint of worry. Bai Shishi’s character was too proud. That overwhelming sharpness would turn against her if she wasn’t able to control it. Hence, her mother had urged her to choose a spiritual energy rune first, but she refused.

This hard sharpness lacked the flexibility of a woman. Bai Shishi’s mother clearly saw that if her daughter wasn’t lacking this, she wouldn’t have lost against Ku Wuya. But she also couldn’t change her way of thinking. It was very difficult to change a person’s character, thus a person’s character was also what created their fate.

“Choosing metal energy? That’s easy. Hey!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen suddenly put his hands around his mouth and shouted at Bai Shishi. However, Bai Shishi’s mother’s expression completely changed. She hastily formed hand seals, and everyone around Long Chen vanished.

Just then, a lightning sword shot out from the tribulation area to attack Long Chen.

With a snort, Long Chen’s palm slammed into the lightning, shattering it. As a result, lightning runes raged furiously and spread.

This lightning contained heavenly might. If Bai Shishi’s mother hadn’t acted so quickly, the people around them would have suffered a calamity.

“You little fellow, are you trying to get people killed?!” she scolded angrily.

“Sorry, I forgot,” said Long Chen. He wasn’t afraid of the will of heavenly tribulation, but that wasn’t the same for others.

Anyone who spoke to the person in the tribulation would be sensed by the heavenly tribulation. The tribulation would attack someone based on the power of their cultivation base.

Long Chen had forgotten that there was also Bai Shishi’s mother right there. She was a Divine Lord. If the tribulation transformed into a Divine Lord tribulation, then that really would be a calamity.

However, Bai Shishi’s mother had already brought everyone away. They had escaped the range of the heavenly tribulation, putting Long Chen at ease. So he continued to shout at Bai Shishi.

“Pretty girl, listen to me and I’ll help you find the strongest metal rune here!”

The heavenly tribulation rumbled. Lightning swords pierced toward Long Chen.

“Shut your mouth and stop disturbing me!” shouted a furious Bai Shishi. This anger caused her senses to grow even duller, making her pale. She had the urge to bite Long Chen.

“I’m not joking with you. Listen and close your eyes. Pretend your shoulders are two straight lines going left and right. Keep your arms in. When I shout left, reach out with your left hand and grab. When I shout right, reach out with your right hand,” shouted Long Chen while shattering those lightning swords with a wave of his hand. They transformed into lightning runes, but Long Chen didn’t let Lei Long absorb them.

Long Chen didn’t dare to even use his own will to resist the heavenly tribulation, afraid that it would transform into his own tribulation. He hadn’t refined the golden dragon scale yet and might die to his tribulation. Moreover, that would even implicate Bai Shishi, so he had to conduct himself appropriately.

Hearing that, Bai Shishi calmed down. Although Long Chen couldn’t be counted on normally, he was reliable at important times.

“Fine, I’ll trust you once. Don’t con me,” said Bai Shishi, closing her eyes and acting according to Long Chen’s instructions.

Her goal was the rank seven metal rune. But if too much time passed, she could only go for the rank six rune. The rank seven rune was too hard to sense. She only sensed a glimmer of it for a moment.

It was as if the rank seven rune was playing hide and seek with her. It would reveal itself for a second and then vanish. She was unable to grasp its location or orbit.

“Left hand!”

A miss.

“Left hand!”

Another miss. Bai Shishi tried four times without grabbing anything. The spectators were growing anxious, but they didn’t dare to say a word.

Bai Shishi was starting to sweat. Two-thirds of the time had passed. If she still didn’t grasp it, she could only go for the rank six rune.

Due to repeated failures, her mental realm was getting unsteady, and her perception was becoming dull. She might not even be able to find the rank six rune like this.

“Steady yourself. Focus all your power on your hand. You must be as fast as possible. Use as much power as you can, as if you are grabbing Ku Wuya’s throat!” shouted Long Chen. He also saw Bai Shishi’s unsteady state.

Bai Shishi nodded. She took a deep breath and focused.

“Right hand!”

Long Chen suddenly shouted. Bai Shishi’s right hand reached out like lightning.

BOOM!

The void shuddered. The place where Bai Shishi’s hand was grabbing shuddered and twisted.

“Grab it!” shouted Long Chen.

Bai Shishi’s hand then tightened. Her body shuddered as she almost coughed up blood. She focused all her power on her hand, which split open and bled. A terrifying power tried to escape from her hand.

Bai Shishi was shocked and delighted. She did her best to grab hold of this thing, refusing to let go. A rune then appeared in her hand, one that emitted all the colors of the rainbow.

“This is… a peak rank Heavenly Dao rune that only appears once every ten thousand years!” Bai Shishi’s mother stared in disbelief at that rune.
