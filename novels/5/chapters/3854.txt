Chapter 3843 Power Shakes the World

The seven bright stars behind Long Chen formed a starry ring, and their power flowed in an endless loop. Not a trace of their power leaked.

Last time, when he summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor, he still didn’t dare to connect them in a perfect loop. That was because if he didn’t unleash some of his energy into the air, he might blow himself up with his power.

However, after getting used to his new power over a longer period, he gained more experience using his stronger meridians and could now fully control the power of the Seven Star Battle Armor.

The moment the power of his seven stars began to flow, energy exploded out of his body. This fist’s power could tear through the dome of the heavens.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking collision, giant cracks appeared within heaven and earth. It was as if this entire world would shatter.

After that, wild qi waves formed a domain of death that rapidly spread. The golden lake beneath everyone’s feet was directly blasted into golden mist. As a result, Yin Changsheng, Ji Wuming, and the others immediately unleashed their full power just to brace themselves.

Even then, they were blown back by this impact. On the other hand, Xia Chen was prepared. With his talisman, he brought Yue Xiaoqian, Mo Nian, and Guo Ran away ahead of time. So, by the time they were buffeted by those astral winds, they had weakened a great deal. Even then, Xia Chen felt like the astral winds were like blades on his face. It felt like his flesh was being sliced off of his body.

“Look!”

Suddenly, Guo Ran pointed to the bottom of the golden lake. The lake had been blown away by Long Chen and Long Aotian’s exchange, revealing the bottom.

There were thirty-six coffins located at the bottom of the lake. The moment they were revealed, a wild desolate qi assaulted them. That aura made Guo Ran and the others’ hair stand on end. An indescribable sense of terror then filled all of them. It felt like something had set its sights on them.

“Not good. We’ve been involved in some terrifying karma.” Mo Nian was bewildered as he looked at the coffins. As a professional grave robber, he was familiar with all kinds of tombs and had plundered many of them. Naturally, that resulted in him getting involved with many inauspicious things. This was what it meant to see more ghosts at night.

Before entering this heavenly tomb, Mo Nian had set up a barrier. This was a secret technique of the Limitless Palace to shield from invisible energies like karma and curses.

However, when these coffins appeared, Mo Nian was shocked to find that the barrier he had set up was instantly destroyed. It didn’t have the slightest effect.

The appearance of these coffins made everyone’s heart shake. As experts, they could tell that they had just been infected by some karma. This feeling was like a terrifying monster had set its sights on them. It also felt like they would never escape from that gaze for the rest of their lives.

Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and Ji Wuming’s expressions changed. Once involved in this kind of karma, there was no escape.

Those coffins had ancient totemic carves on them. There were tree monsters, strange flowers, as well as beasts that they had never seen before.

“AHH!”

Suddenly, hundreds of the devil race’s and Sacred Pill Hall’s experts screamed at the same time. They covered their eyes with their hands, and fresh blood poured out from between their fingers. At the same time as that blood flowed, putrefied flesh could be seen in it as well.

“Don’t look at those coffins! Don’t look into the eyes of those beast carvings! If your life isn’t strong enough, this karma will instantly kill you!” shouted Yin Changsheng, stopping the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts from looking at them.

Although he didn’t know the origin of these coffins, this terrifying karma had infected them. Even he felt chills and his soul quivered. This place had something untouchable buried within it.

Beneath that mysterious cauldron was the golden lake, and below the golden lake were these coffins. Anyone could tell that those coffins were the true heart of the heavenly tomb.

Suddenly, two loud roars shook this world, and wild qi waves battered everyone. Those qi waves buffeted the world with no pause.

Only then did people pull their attention from the coffins to midair, where Long Chen and Long Aotian’s fists were still locked in combat. They were unleashing all their power to suppress the other.

Everyone could see cracks where their fists met, and those cracks continuously grew. Grand Dao runes collapsed; fragments of spacetime flew. Under their violent power, this entire world was wailing, as if it would explode at any moment.

The upper floor above them had been turned into dust at some point. The entire heavenly tomb was shaking, and the corpses on the walls fell. This place was in chaos.

The experts present were terrified. They had never witnessed such a terrifying sight before. The two of them seemed intent on destroying this entire world with them.

Long Chen and Long Aotian glared at each other, both of them exploding with killing intent. They didn’t care about everything around them. They only had one thought: to defeat the other in the most direct, most brutal way.

As their powers raged, their qi waves struck the Heavenly Boundary Line. It was actually affected by their power and began to rumble.

However, the curious thing was that even as the Heavenly Boundary Line was shaken, the bronze cauldron at the center wasn’t shaken in the slightest. It seemed that it wasn’t affected by the Heavenly Boundary Line at all.

The entire heavenly tomb was wailing. The others didn’t dare to make any rash movements. Even Mo Nian, who lusted for those coffins, was only appraising them silently, waiting to gain more information before making a move.

Although those coffins were utterly terrifying, since they were already involved with their karma, there was nothing more to fear. He very much wanted to know what terrifying existences were buried within those coffins.

However, he still couldn’t make a move yet. If he did, Ji Wuming, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Shi Yang, and the others would also react. There were too many of them. Any rash moves would be disadvantageous, so Mo Nian was waiting for a more suitable opportunity. For now, he just watched Long Chen and Long Aotian’s fight.

BOOM!

Long Chen and Long Aotian were blown back at the same time. After that, the spatial cracks vanished and the ear-piercing sounds also subsided. The entire world fell silent.

“Good. As expected of you, Long Chen. You haven’t disappointed me. I still have many trump cards I haven't gotten to use yet. If you were to lose already, it would be boring.” Long Aotian stood in the air. His manifestation thrummed according to a mysterious rhythm. At this moment, he was looking at Long Chen like a beast looking at his prey.

Long Aotian didn’t reveal much shock at Long Chen’s power. Instead, he seemed excited. Even against the full-power Long Chen, he was confident.

“It doesn’t matter how many trump cards you have. You will never be able to escape your fate of being beaten. The moment you stole my Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, your fate was set.”

Long Chen was also burning with battle intent. It was as if he lived for battle. Only in battle could he understand himself; only in battle could he see himself clearly.

“Hahaha, you are still so conceited. Let me see how long you can keep up with that conceit.”

The next moment, Long Aotian spread his arms, and the world within his manifestation suddenly changed color. When golden light erupted out of the world behind him, he shot at Long Chen.

“Sharp metal qi. He can control metal energy!” Xia Chen cried out in shock. That golden light was like sharp golden swords.

Most frightening of all, as these golden swords came flying out of his manifestation, the ground of the heavenly tomb turned golden as well. Those golden swords instantly sucked away this world’s metal energy.

At this moment, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and the others’ expressions all changed.
