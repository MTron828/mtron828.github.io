Chapter 3305 Blasting Through Rotten Wood

The Heavenly Rainbow Domain had nineteen prefectures, but only thirteen really existed now. The other six had turned into lands of death. It was said that those areas had sunk due to the battle of the ancient era. The Heavenly Daos were in chaos in those locations. Whether it was humans, beasts, or other lifeforms, they were unable to survive in that environment.

As for the so-called hundred domains and thousand prefectures of the immortal world, it was also limited in numbers by this restraint. Considering how vast the nine heavens and ten lands were, there were countless star-fields. But only around a hundred domains and a thousand prefectures were habitable.

The core of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was the Immortal Fairy Prefecture. It was also the largest of the prefectures. Even before they entered it, they could see a rainbow in the sky. That was the divine light from the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue.

The sacrifice of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was something all people were grateful to her for, so countless people came to worship her statue. Although it was just a single divine statue, the majority of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s faith energy was concentrated within it. This rainbow light was also called the light of faith, a symbol of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s thriving state.

As for the core of the Immortal Fairy Prefecture, it was covered in rainbow light. This was a sacred place. No one could use martial arts in this place, nor were they permitted to show the slightest disrespect for the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

This holy light had countless sects built around it. But no one was permitted to build a sect within that holy light.

Immortal qi revolved around the mountain range around the light, and a giant palace was built at the peak of these mountains.

That place was Bloodkill Hall’s headquarters in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. The exterior of it was covered in divine light. That was its grand formation.

Countless figures were hiding within the dense forest around this area. There were even spaces underground. These were places for new disciples to practice their aura-concealing techniques.

Suddenly, golden light exploded around this palace. A golden sword slashed down from the heavens, slicing through the formation.

Right behind it was a flame lotus. It rapidly grew in the air and was tossed down into the hole in the barrier made by the golden sword.

BOOM!

The lotus exploded on contact with the palace, unleashing a devastating wave of fire. This entire space became a sea of flames.

“Enemy attack!”

Startled cries rang out. However, countless disciples didn’t even have the chance to make a sound before being incinerated.

Four Peak experts screamed but were unable to extinguish the flames on their bodies. In just a few breaths’ time, they were dead. Only those hiding within the palace, who had at least reached the Divine Lord realm, were barely able to hang on.

“Boss Long San has come. Enpuda’s disciples, come out and face your deaths,” shouted Long Chen.

A bone saber slashed down within the flames, striking Enpuda’s statue at the front of the palace. Long Chen cut off its head.

With the statue destroyed, Enpuda’s clone could not descend. Without a heavenly tribulation, no matter how arrogant Long Chen was, he didn’t dare to fight Enpuda directly. So he first destroyed his statue.

Long Chen made sure to grab the head as well. Standing on Enpuda’s neck, he overlooked the palace.

“Blasphemer of the Killing God, die!”

The Bloodkill Hall’s experts were enraged when they saw Long Chen. Ignoring the flames around them, they charged at him.

After that, the palace shuddered and three Immortal Kings flew out.

Those three people had just appeared when a golden streak of light flashed. Sword-light blasted the three of them apart.

“Nice!”

It was Bai Shishi. Her attack was incredible, and even Immortal Kings could not resist her sword.

After advancing to the late stage of the Four Peak realm and having absorbed the metal energy of the Devil Eye Water Lily, Bai Shishi’s metal energy had gone through a huge transformation. She was just barely capable of controlling the golden sword’s power without experiencing a backlash.

This golden sword came from the Ghost Ship. Its origins were unclear, and it possessed terrifying power. With it, Bai Shishi could unleash her full potential.

Just now, her attack was so powerful that even Long Chen was amazed. The current Bai Shishi was truly terrifying.

Bai Shishi had killed three Immortal Kings with one attack. As a result, the other experts of the Bloodkill Hall were left dumbfounded. Just as they were hesitating about whether or not they should run, space twisted and Bai Xiaole appeared behind them with everyone else. Caught off-guard, those Divine Lords quickly collapsed.

“Run! There’s no need for any meaningless sacrifices! The great Killing God will definitely punish these sinners!” People began to turn tail and run.

“Long Chen, just wait! You’ve blasphemed the Killing God! You won’t have a good death!”

Even as they cursed, the Bloodkill Hall’s experts fled for their lives. Qin Feng and the others chased them down, picking out the experts to kill. But quite a few small fries managed to escape.

“If I had known that they were this weak, I wouldn’t have needed Xiaole’s help. I would have directly attacked them.” Bai Shishi slowly put away her sword. She felt like her powerful attack had landed on cotton. Those Immortal Kings of the Bloodkill Hall were weaker than she had expected. 

Bai Xiaole had used his spatial power to hide her within the void, just so that she could launch a lethal blow. But as a result, those Immortal Kings didn’t manage to resist at all. It felt like the battle was over before it even began.

“If I had known that you were so strong, I wouldn’t have cut off Enpuda’s head. I’d have just let you kill him.” Long Chen shrugged a bit helplessly.

The reason Long Chen had immediately destroyed the statue was partially to prevent Enpuda’s clone from descending. The other reason was because the Bloodkill Hall’s experts relied on the faith energy inside the statue to strengthen themselves. At that time, their combat power would rise a startling amount.

If they really were pushed to the point of no return and were willing to take on serious consequences, Immortal Kings at the Mortal tier could even temporarily unleash the power of the Spirit tier. In the worst-case scenario, there would even be a Spirit tier Immortal King here. If such an existence was also boosted by the power of the divine statue, Long Chen and the others would have trouble fighting them.

After the battle with the Devil Eye Water Lily, Long Chen didn’t want to be so careless again. As a result, he had ended up greatly overestimating the Bloodkill Hall’s power here.

“Assassins of the Bloodkill Hall can only unleash their power in a sneak attack. In a direct battle, their tricks are meaningless.” Qin Feng indifferently wiped the fresh blood off of his weapon, seemingly wanting to continue fighting.

After all, an assassin was an assassin. They always prepared themselves before attacking. So, for someone to attack them, they were thrown into chaos. It was completely different from the fearless assassins that people imagined.

Without the protection of the grand formation, the sea of flames caused the palace to crumble. This once flourishing location became ruins.

“Boss San is mighty! Just as I said, a figure like you, a hero that stands at the peak of all heroes, couldn’t possibly be an underworld ghost seed!”

Unexpectedly, the people that he had brought with him to lead the way had yet to flee. They had actually run back, singing his praises.

The truth was that these people were terrified when leading the way for Long Chen. If the Bloodkill Hall were to learn that they had led Long Chen here, they would definitely be executed. But if they didn’t bring Long Chen here, they would have died instead. So they could only come.

Seeing that Long Chen and the others were actually so strong that they instantly destroyed the Bloodkill Hall, these people directly ran back to suck up. The Bloodkill Hall’s experts had died, so why not see if they could dredge up some benefits?”

“Not bad. You have some guts. Fine, I’ll leave the treasury of the Bloodkill Hall to you to search through. But you also have to accomplish a mission for me. Take this head and find a place to use it as a dung pit. Have people fill it with their excrement. Then you can conceal your identity and run to a different domain, living a carefree life.” Long Chen tossed Enpuda’s head to them.

Those people were delighted. They had originally been thinking of leaving the Heavenly Rainbow Domain after dredging up some benefits from Long Chen, but he was actually giving them all the spoils of this battle. They had never obtained such a huge benefit before.

After leaving the head to them, Long Chen directly left. Those people hastily went through the treasury and then ran. However, they truly did follow his command. They accomplished Long Chen’s mission, resulting in the Bloodkill Hall no longer being able to establish a divine faith lake here. Of course, that was something for the future.

After destroying this branch of the Bloodkill Hall, Long Chen left behind a line: “Boss Long San was here.” He then directly left to the core of the Immortal Fairy Prefecture. At this time, countless experts had flocked here. They stared in shock as Long Chen’s group came from the direction of the Bloodkill Hall.

“That person… seems to be…”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

People stared at Long Chen in disbelief. They clearly recognized him.
