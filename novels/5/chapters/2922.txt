Chapter 2911 Contractual Soul Beast

Devil Eye Yang Fang died by having his head explode, Yuan Xinghui died from being smashed into blood mist, and the formation expert Tang Yaochen died with his head ripped off of his body.

Just like that, Long Chen had killed three powerful experts without batting an eyelid. Moreover, those three had been famous existences amongst the outer academy’s disciples, but they still died in one move, unable to even last a single exchange against Long Chen.

Because of this, the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples finally became afraid. With his phantom-like movements, who could stop him?

Suddenly, clapping sounds rang out, and it was from Chu Kuang. He was smiling. “Excellent, only like this is it interesting. Only such an opponent can make this competition more marvelous. Long Chen, do you know? I spent all this money and wasted all this effort just to force out all your power. Then I will kill you in front of millions of people. You, Long Chen, will become my stepping stone. I’ll let you know that whether it is your background, your wealth, or your power, you cannot compare to me. This battle will be my glorious entry to the inner academy. And through this battle, I will announce to those people in the inner academy that I am the king of the outer academy. And when I go to the inner academy, I will also be the king of the inner academy.”

People were dumbfounded as to why Chu Kuang was still so confident after seeing Long Chen’s power. Was Chu Kuang really so powerful?

They then glanced toward Chu Huairen, only to find that he had a faint smile. It was as if he wasn’t worried at all.

“There’s no need for you to do anything. Don’t forget our agreement. His head is worth a hundred million immortal crystals and a high grade Spirit item.” The Soul Institute’s Li Chengbei spoke for the first time.

He was extremely skinny and rather pale, almost looking hungover. His voice was sharp and thin.

“Of course. My Chu family has plenty of money. The main thing is whether or not you have the ability to grasp that money,” said Chu Kuang indifferently.

“Long Chen, your head is mine!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Li Chengbei suddenly formed hand seals, and a giant figure appeared in front of everyone.

It was a divine bird. Its feathers emitted divine light, and its aura shook the space where the competition was held.

“Heavens, that’s a contractual soul beast! Li Chengbei hasn’t advanced to the Divine Flame realm yet! How can he have formed a contract with a soul beast?!”

“I heard that Li Chengbei’s soul beast is thanks to the Chu family. But no one knows how it was done.”

“A contractual soul beast will grow alongside him! Its aura seems to be in the Divine Flame realm. How can they fight that?!”

The divine bird spread its wings and slashed one of them at Long Chen like a blade.

Long Chen then dodged, causing the wing to leave a deep trench in the ground. That terrifying power made the others jump.

“Long Chen’s head is mine!” Just at that moment, the red-haired Xiang Kejie attacked with a fiery spear. Flames exploded out of his body, and countless runes lit up on his spear until it was red with heat. Even through the formation, people felt like they could sense the terrifying heat, as they could see space twisting around him.

Also, over ten other experts attacked at the same time. As for Chu Kuang, he simply stood there with his hands clasped behind his back, seemingly with no intention of interfering.

“We’re going to help brother San!” Zhong Ling and the other experts were about to rush forward.

“It’s nothing more than a group of useless fellows. There’s no need for you to fight them,” said Long Chen while dodging left and right, avoiding their attacks. Suddenly, he landed a punch on the divine bird’s wing, and the explosion knocked both of them back.

“With death at hand, you still dare to be so arrogant?!” Xiang Kejie sneered and took advantage of this opening to stab his spear right at Long Chen’s throat.

However, Long Chen’s figure flashed, and that spear pierced right past his neck. Despite its terrifying heat, it didn’t harm Long Chen in the slightest.

Slipping through the spear, Long Chen then landed a ruthless slap on Xiang Kejie’s face, sending him flying.

What shocked everyone was that blood actually dripped down from Xiang Kejie’s head. Long Chen had clearly slapped him, so it would make sense for blood to come from Xiang Kejie’s face but not the top of his head, right?

However, when they spotted the red hair in Long Chen’s hand, they realized that Long Chen had not only slapped him, but he had also torn off a chunk of his scalp.

It was just that Long Chen was so fast that most people were unable to see his movements clearly. Only a few experts saw his actions.

“I will return this to you. If you paste it back quickly, maybe it will latch back on,” said Long Chen, tossing what was in his hand back to Xiang Kejie.

Seeing this, Xiang Kejie roared furiously and smashed that piece of his scalp with his spear. His eyes were scarlet. After that, blood-colored runes appeared all over his body, and his Blood Qi ignited, causing his aura to soar to a new level.

He was clearly infuriated. Holding nothing back, he wanted to kill Long Chen in one blow as vengeance for this humiliation.

“Earth Rending Flame Dragon Spear!”

At this moment, a dragon-shaped mark appeared on Xiang Kejie’s spear, and a raging heat ignited the air.

“Playing with fire? Your boss San is the real ancestor in that department.”

Long Chen then sneered and slammed his palm forward, manifesting flame runes on his hand.

BOOM!

The instant his palm met the spear, the spear lost its balance and ended up stabbing into an expert sneak attacking Long Chen from behind.

That expert didn’t have time to dodge or scream and instantly turned into a cloud of black smoke. This exchange gave people chills. The power of that spear was truly great.

Surrounded by over ten powerful experts, Long Chen looked to be in danger. But every time things seemed to turn sour for him, he would slip through their attacks. None of their crazed attacks was able to touch him.

An incense stick’s worth of time then passed, but no one noticed, not the ones fighting or the ones watching.

At first, Long Chen’s movements truly did seem to be the slightest bit rusty. But as he fought, his movements were growing more and more refined. It was as if he was gradually adapting to this battle.

Suddenly, Long Chen grabbed Xiang Kejie’s spear, and a sharp light appeared in his eyes. It was as if a blade had come out of its sheath.

“The warm-up ends here. You can die!”

Long Chen suddenly pushed the spear back into Xiang Kejie. An earth-shattering power passed through his spear before it pierced his own body.
