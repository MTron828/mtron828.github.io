Chapter 3403 Half-Step World King

“Half-step World Kings!”

Long Chen narrowed his eyes slightly after sensing their cultivation bases. He had encountered World Kings and Heaven tier Immortal Kings. So, this aura that transcended Heaven tier Immortal Kings but had yet to reach the level of a World King was very easy to recognize for him.

“Don’t speak. I’ll handle them,” said Lei Yuner. Her gaze contained a trace of anger.

The footsteps stopped. Long Chen then saw two elders just over five feet tall. Despite their short stature, the destructive aura coming from their bodies was astonishing.

Just like Lei Yuner, they had lightning runes flickering in their eyes. But those runes were as sharp as blades.

“AH!”

Ying Bokong suddenly cried out and clutched his eyes. Fresh blood poured out from between his fingers. Just now, because he looked at the two of them, his eyes almost exploded. A sharp pain ran through his soul. He was in unbearable pain.

Long Chen frowned. These elders were clearly from the same race as Lei Yuner, but they immediately unleashed a suppressing aura as soon as they came in. That had gone a bit too far.

“How many times have I told you that there are some things you shouldn’t look at?” Long Chen tossed Ying Bokong a medicinal pill. The latter hastily consumed it, and his turbulent soul instantly calmed down. The injury to his eyes also slowly healed.

However, he didn’t dare to open his eyes again, let alone to look at those two elders. He wasn’t such a fool. When gods and immortals fought, mortals suffered calamity. If he couldn’t run away, the wisest choice was to be a blind person, as well as mute and deaf.

“Inferior human, are you challenging our mighty Lightning Falcon race?” asked one of the elders. Lightning runes circulated within his eyes, as if he was capable of seeing Long Chen’s inner heart.

He knew that Long Chen was intentionally cursing them. When they looked at Long Chen, they used their mental power.

“Don’t embarrass yourself. With your little mental energy, you aren’t even fit to carry my shoes. If you have something to say, say it. Don’t waste my time,” sneered Long Chen.

Who cared if they were half-step World Kings? Mental energy was originally the strong point of the human race, and Long Chen’s mental energy was so strong that he wasn’t even afraid of the pressure of real World Kings, let alone the two of them.

For them to try using their mental energy to suppress Long Chen was like ants trying to shake a towering tree. It was laughable.

Lei Yuner was originally angry, but when she saw Long Chen completely ignore their mental pressure, she was invigorated. She sneered, “It seems that the two of you are unable to represent the Lightning Falcon race, no? What do you think you are doing by being bought by the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince? You’re going to follow me wherever I go? When did the noble Lightning Falcon race become the dogs of someone else?”

“Princess, you might be a princess, but we are the Elders of the race. Don’t you think you’re going too far with these words?” said one of the elders darkly.

These two were senior members of the Lightning Falcon race, with quite the influence at that. The matter between Lei Yuner and the eighth prince stemmed from their work.

The eighth prince was a rare genius that only appeared once every tens of thousands of years in the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. In terms of bloodline and talent, he was almost flawless. There were even signs of him awakening his ancestral bloodline.

If the eighth prince and Lei Yuner had children, there would definitely be an even higher chance of the children recovering an ancestral bloodline.

When the bloodlines were mixed, there would be a clash between the two. Both sides would try to suppress the other, causing them to unleash immense potential.

When two supreme geniuses had children, it was easy to produce a powerful bloodline. Furthermore, through many negotiations, the Mammoth Divine Elephant race had made huge concessions. Their first child, no matter the bloodline, would belong to the Lightning Falcon race.

As for future children, if they leaned toward the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s bloodline, it would go to the Elephant race. But if the children leaned toward the Lightning Falcon race, it would go to the Falcon race.

This was a great opportunity. The Mammoth Divine Elephant race clearly had confidence in their bloodline for them to make such a concession. It was only due to this that they were willing to carry out this union.

It had taken long negotiations for the two of them to get so many favorable conditions. But Lei Yuner directly rejected the eight prince upon coming here, so how could they not be angry?

It had to be known that the demonic beast race was different from the human race. Having progeny and passing down their bloodlines was their number one mission. Emotions? They were worthless.

Even when it came to the human race, those with powerful bloodlines would marry each other to have the best chance of having a child with the best bloodline. It was rarely purely about emotion.

The demonic beast race talked about this matter like it was eating food or drinking water. That could also be seen in how Lei Yuner talked so frankly to Long Chen about having his children. In her view, it was a casual topic; nothing to be embarrassed about. She was willing to have children with anyone she found pleasing.

She greatly liked Long Chen’s true dragon essence blood and thunderforce. Moreover, her talent was exceptional, giving her a far sharper vision. She could also sense the blessing of the Butterfly Spirit race and the rainbow cranes.

The rainbow cranes were auspicious beasts of heaven and earth, a sign of good fortune. As for herself, she was from a divine bird race. If she was supported by that blessing, the benefits would be unimaginable. That was why she was so locked onto Long Chen.

Others didn’t have her sharp vision, so they were unable to see through the clues on Long Chen. However, she also didn’t wish to spread the word of this matter, for fear of other experts coming to fight over Long Chen.

She knew that her outer appearance didn’t fit the beauty standards of the human race. So, she was afraid another woman would bring Long Chen away. That was why she was very displeased that these two elders had come now.

“Too far? Could anyone go as far as you have gone? Do you not place this princess in your eyes?” demanded Lei Yuner. “In terms of status, you are seniors bullying your junior. In terms of bloodline, you are trying to offend someone far above you. I, Lei Yuner, will handle my own matters. Whatever happens, I will bear the responsibility for it. Nothing here is any of your business, so you can scram. I have reserved this place. If you don’t want me to call for people to shoo you out, scram. Otherwise, you’ll be the ones to lose all your face in the end.”

The elders’ expressions sank. They had been wanting to advise her, but they were powerless when it came to her temper. They didn’t get to say much at all before things ended up like this.

They then looked at Long Chen, as if blaming him. If this wasn’t the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture, they might not have cared about offending Lei Yuner and would have directly killed him.

They wanted to try and advise her some more, but seeing her open her mouth as if she was about to shout for the owners of the restaurant, they clenched their teeth and left.

Once they left, Ying Bokong sighed with relief. Their pressure made it hard for him to breathe.

“Long Chen, I really am sincere. Having a child with me won’t make your life difficult. Why not consider it?” Once the two of them left, Lei Yuner grabbed Long Chen’s hands and lowered her head, as if wanting to look like a charming maiden. But she wasn’t very good at it. Her expression was a bit stiff.

Long Chen’s scalp turned numb. She was talking about it like animals copulating. He definitely could not accept it. Just as he was thinking about how he could tactfully reject her, the tablet on his waist began to flash.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ying Bokong hastily gave him a way out. “Master, you need to go evaluate your power.”
