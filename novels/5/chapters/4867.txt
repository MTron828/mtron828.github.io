Chapter 4856 Making a Sinister Move

Cao Guofeng was clenching his teeth, his killing intent raging. Although Cao Shaoqing’s death hurt him as well, in comparison to the loss of the Ten Thousand Blood Flag, it was clearly insignificant.

The destruction of the Ten Thousand Blood Flag, the legacy treasure of the Iron Blood Gate, represented a significant blow to their karmic luck and a loss that could never be fully recovered. This was an irrecoverable loss to the Iron Blood Gate.

Moreover, Cao Guofeng’s use of his own blood soul energy to control the Ten Thousand Blood Flag resulted in a severe backlash upon its destruction. Although he appeared to have suppressed the injury, his acting skill couldn’t fool Heaven Saints like Yu Luo or the sharp-eyed Long Chen.

In the past, Long Chen might have considered the matter settled after defeating Cao Shaoqing. However, Long Chen now recognized Cao Guofeng as an enemy, and in his view, enemies needed to be eliminated swiftly. In any case, an organization like the Iron Blood Gate that had merged with the Blood race’s bloodline was no longer considered human in Long Chen’s eyes. Their very essence was corrupted by wickedness.

“Hey, do you dare to fight? Say something. Why is your mouth clamped shut? Do you have diarrhea?” taunted Long Chen as he walked across the broken stage, appearing to treat Cao Guofeng completely indifferently. Long Chen appeared incredibly arrogant and domineering. As a Divine Venerate, he even dared to challenge the gate master of a major faction, earning extreme admiration from countless experts for his guts.

Long Chen’s actions repeatedly challenged the bounds of their imagination, and they had never seen such a powerful heavenly genius before. With this one battle, Long Chen won over countless so-called geniuses. Yu Tong and Yu Fei’s eyes practically sparkled with stars as they cheered loudly, in awe of Long Chen’s prowess.

Even Race Leader Yu Luo was taken aback as she had misjudged. Long Chen’s strength far exceeded her expectations. He truly did have the power to challenge Heaven Saints.

“Long Chen, you’ve gone too far!”

This enraged voice didn’t come from Cao Guofeng.

When people looked for the source of the voice, they saw it was actually Mo Nian. This unexpected turn left countless people scratching their heads. Wasn't Mo Nian supposed to be Long Chen’s companion?

Before they even understood what was happening, Mo Nian cursed, “Have some shame! Look at how old Cao Guofeng is. Is it something to be proud of to bully an old man on the verge of death? You’ve already slapped him in the face and slaughtered his descendant. You’ve beaten who you wanted to beat and killed who you wanted to kill. And now you’re still pushing him? Don’t you think that this is bullying?”

Mo Nian’s outburst left people speechless. He was truly evil. His words seemed more like a ruthless exposure of Cao Guofeng's vulnerabilities rather than a criticism of Long Chen.

Mo Nian then continued his righteous indignation. “Gate Master Cao is already injured. Don’t tell me that you couldn’t see that? If he were to face you now, wouldn’t he just be beaten like a dog? Are you afraid of Cao Shaoqing being lonely, so you want Gate Master Cao to accompany him? Wouldn’t it be better if you made all the Iron Blood Gate’s people accompany hi—” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Shut your mouth!” Cao Guofeng roared with fury, his voice like thunder booming through the air.

Looking furious, Mo Nian verbally retaliated, “Hey, you old fogey, shouldn’t you be able to differentiate between the good and bad person? I’m speaking up for you—”

“Scram!”

Cao Guofeng let out a roar, but as a result, everyone heard the hoarseness in his voice and saw some clues.

“It seems that he really is injured, probably more severe than I anticipated. He won’t dare to get onto the stage,” remarked Yu Luo.

Right now, Cao Guofeng could neither unleash even half of his normal power nor activate the Blood Transformation Divine Stele. If he were to fight Long Chen now, he would just die like a fool.

Although people didn’t recognize the evil divine weapon in Long Chen’s hand, its shape and aura were enough to frighten them. Without the Blood Transformation Divine Stele, Cao Guofeng definitely wouldn’t dare to face off against Evilmoon.

With a dark expression, Cao Guofeng said, “You little brat, you used some kind of sorcery to absorb the runes of the star cloud martial stage. Now that you don’t have that power, killing you will be easy.”

Hearing the revelation, the spectators realized that it really was as Cao Guofeng said. Long Chen had stolen the martial stage’s power to destroy the Ten Thousand Blood Flag. This was just a one-off thing and wouldn’t happen a second time.

“Then please, respected Gate Master Cao, why not come to the stage and see?” Long Chen shrugged indifferently.

Cao Guofeng sneered, “I don’t need to do anything. Having destroyed the star cloud martial stage and taken the Heaven Saint devil runes, you’ve broken the laws of Devil Fall City and must be executed for your crimes. You’re just a convict and don’t have the qualifications to challenge me. All that awaits you is the Square Heaven Seal’s execution.”

Suddenly, a golden seal appeared in Cao Guofeng’s hand, and the entire martial stage quivered. Following that, countless stars appeared above Long Chen’s head, as if the dome of the heavens was pressing down on Long Chen.

BOOM!

Before Long Chen could even understand what was happening, he sank into the ground. The martial stage beneath him collapsed, forming a giant hole.

“You are courting death!”

Yu Luo furiously stood up, wielding an emerald bow in her hand. A pitch-black arrow materialized on the bow, aimed directly at Cao Guofeng. The Protector Elders behind her also had their bows ready, prepared for action.

“Release Long Chen immediately, or you will die!” demanded Yu Luo icily.

“This is an internal matter of Devil Fall City. Your Feather Spirit race has no purview here. Having broken the rules of Devil Fall City, Long Chen must be punished!”

At this moment, the Heaven Heart Hall’s master also stood up, a golden seal appearing in her hand as well. In an instant, the pressure on Long Chen increased.

Other than the main seal, the Square Heaven Seal also had four auxiliary seals, and they were in the hands of the four noble families. These auxiliary seals were capable of harnessing a portion of the Square Heaven Seal's power, a privilege bestowed upon them by the seal itself.

Seeing two factions join forces to suppress Long Chen, Lu Ziqiong hastily turned to Gao Jianli. “Sect Master, please help Long Chen!”

She was gratified to see her sect master take out his golden seal. If he used it to help Long Chen, it would essentially negate the pressure of one of those seals.

However, when Gao Jianli’s seal lit up, the pressure on Long Chen shot up again. Long Chen’s bones creaked from the pressure.

BOOM!

“Sect Master?!” Lu Ziqiong stared in disbelief at Gao Jianli.

“Rules are rules. Long Chen has broken the laws of the city, and I am tasked with upholding order. How can I ignore my duty?” replied Gao Jianli.

“You really are a pack of fools! It seems that you want us two brothers to destroy Devil Fall City!” Mo Nian was also enraged now, his killing intent intensifying.

But all of a sudden, Gao Jianli, the Heaven Heart Hall’s master, and Cao Guofeng grunted. They shook, and the terrifying pressure on Long Chen vanished without a trace.

“Xing Wujiang, what do you think you’re doing?!” Cao Guofeng erupted, confronting Xing Wujiang. In his hand, Cao Guofeng held a violet-gold seal, and he was the one who had released the pressure on Long Chen. Instantly, all attention shifted toward him.
