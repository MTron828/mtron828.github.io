Chapter 2078 Appraising the Spirit Pill

Long Chen had just arrived at the auction area when one of the Dongfang family’s disciples told him that he was late. The first day of the auction had already ended. But he could attend the second and third days.

The auction lasted for a total of three days, with the first and second days being warm-up sessions for the third day.

Although the first and second days also had amazing treasures, the best was definitely saved for last. Long Chen had spent a whole day refining his pill, so he had missed the first day.

“I came because I have something I want to give you to auction. Have I missed the time for that?” asked Long Chen.

The disciple’s eyes brightened. “Not at all. May I ask what treasure you’ve taken out to auction? Oh, please don’t misunderstand, I just need the general details. There is a specialized appraiser who will decide the bottom price. Furthermore, the Dongfang family guarantees the skill of the appraiser, so you don’t need to worry about that. Even before it’s auctioned off, you can withdraw underworld spirit beads equal to the bottom price. Depending on whether someone bids on it or not, you can trade the treasure with the Dongfang family for those underworld spirit beads.”

“The Dongfang family really is not bad. A poor person like me couldn’t even take out any underworld spirit beads. But this guarantee of yours will let me participate in the auction.” Long Chen gave the disciple a thumbs-up.

“Mister Long Chen is joking. A peerless genius like you can take out any random treasure that would be worth the life of a disciple like me. It’s just a difference of eras. The currency is different. Not having underworld spirit beads doesn’t mean your status is low,” said the disciple very smartly.

If it was before, Long Chen would definitely lack confidence upon hearing that, but today he came with the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill.

“I want to auction a pill...” Seeing the disciple’s eyes light up, he said, “Don’t misunderstand, it’s not that pill from the furnace but another pill.”

The disciple couldn’t help being a bit disappointed upon hearing that, but it was well hidden.

“Then mister Long Chen, please follow me.” The attendant brought Long Chen to a private room.

A middle-aged man with whiskers and a scholar’s robes walked in shortly after.

“Mister Long Chen, let me introduce you. This is my Dongfang family’s medicinal pill appraiser. He is also an amazing alchemy grandmaster,” said the disciple.

As soon as this person walked in, Long Chen already sensed that he was an alchemist. He had both flame energy fluctuations and the spiritual fluctuations of an alchemist. There was also a dark-red mark deep within his eyes. He had to be someone who possessed an ancient alchemy bloodline inheritance.

As for what kind of inheritance he possessed, Long Chen didn’t know. However, he had to have a special talent in this regard.

“What nonsense are you talking about? Mister Long Chen is the true alchemy grandmaster. With just a glance, he could see that pill furnace’s value and the pill inside. By praising me, aren’t you going to make mister Long Chen laugh at me?” said the middle-aged man with a smile.

“You’re too courteous. It was just a lucky guess. In any case, I’m here to show you a pill. Can we start the appraisal?” Long Chen didn’t want to talk about the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. Who knew just how many people coveted it? It was better to be low-key.

“May I ask what kind of pill you wish to auction...?”

“Here.”

Long Chen handed the appraiser a seemingly extremely ancient case. It was some random thing he had obtained from the Brahma secret realm. As for what it had contained, he had long since forgotten.

It just so happened that this case could conceal the origins of the pill he was talking about. The middle-aged man received the case, but as soon as he touched it, his pupils shrank. He could already sense the intense fluctuations coming from within.

“A top grade pill?” The appraiser first took out a formation disc and placed the case on it. He activated the formation and summoned a barrier around the case. This was to prevent the pill from attacking or running.

When he opened the case though, it wasn’t as violent as he had expected. Instead, he felt watery fluctuations. Those fluctuations were so powerful that they caused the barrier to shudder.

“A top grade eleventh tier pill that has gone through tribulation!” exclaimed the appraiser. He immediately recognized it for what it was.

Very few people had seen such a pill. In the Dongfang family, top grade eleventh tier medicinal pills existed, but they weren’t numerous and didn’t even surpass a hundred in number. This middle-aged man had studied those pills as they were mostly textbook pills.

That knowledge made him feel even more shocked by this pill. He was actually bearing witness to a pill that had survived pill lightning. Even ignoring what its effect was, just its status as that kind of pill was enough to make countless alchemists go crazy over it.

“Did you refine this?” The middle-aged man looked at Long Chen in disbelief.

Due to the Moon and Star Refining Furnace, every move of Long Chen’s had been kept track of by the Dongfang family. The fact that Long Chen had used an alchemy room was known by the higher-ups.

This middle-aged man immediately connected this pill to the fact that Long Chen had borrowed an alchemy room. However, as soon as he asked, he was embarrassed.

As expected, Long Chen laughed, “Do you feel like that’s possible? With your vision, I’m sure you can tell that this pill is very old. The marks on it have a faint dark-gold color. That’s the mark of many years past.”

The middle-aged man turned red. Just like tree rings, the exterior of a pill could show its age. Hence, as soon as the middle-aged man asked this question, he regretted it. He had actually made such a low level mistake, which would draw his aptitude into question.

Besides, ignoring whether or not Long Chen could refine a top grade eleventh tier medicinal pill, even if he could, he would have needed to let the pill undergo tribulation. Everything within this city was under the Dongfang family’s control, and Long Chen had not left the alchemy room for a pill to undergo tribulation.

“Haha, please don’t laugh at me. I was simply awed by your fame. For a single person to be able to raise the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one legion means that your alchemy arts are definitely not as simple as they appear on the surface. Otherwise, just the medicinal pills required for such a legion would bankrupt any sect. Even my Dongfang family wouldn’t be able to raise such a group of elites. I only asked because you are a legend of the alchemy world,” said the middle-aged man with a laugh.

Long Chen laughed along, knowing that the middle-aged man was just concealing his own embarrassment. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This pill had been dressed up by Long Chen to appear old. Long Chen was confident that no one would be able to tell. At the very least, this fellow in front of him was incapable of it.

“Haha, please don’t overpraise me. In truth, after obtaining that supreme pill, I actually got the crazy thought of also refining an eleventh tier medicinal pill. As a result... ah, my gamble completely failed. I used up all the precious medicines I accumulated over the years without being able to refine anything,” sighed Long Chen.

Long Chen’s expression plus what he said made the female disciple who had brought him here chuckle. After a glare from the middle-aged man, she immediately stopped, but it was difficult to contain her mirth.

Long Chen continued, “Even more unlucky, the pill was just about to form when my furnace cracked. So I lost my medicinal ingredients and my furnace. As for that Moon and Star Refining Furnace, you know it’s still damaged and can’t be used for now. As an alchemist, I’m now half-crippled. I don’t have a furnace or ingredients. So I’ve taken out this pill I obtained from the Brahma secret realm to see if I can make up for my losses. Can you estimate the price of this pill?”

Long Chen had created a whole story for this pill. That way, he wouldn’t draw the Dongfang family’s suspicions.

Someone capable of refining eleventh tier medicinal pills could shake the entire continent. He had to keep it secret. Saying that he found it in the Brahma secret realm was more believable.

As expected, the middle-aged man focused on the pill. He examined it very carefully, taking out over thirty different tools to test it. With each test, he grew more infatuated with it.

“This is a true spirit pill, and it is the best one I have ever seen. Only pills that have gone through tribulation can truly be classified as spirit pills,” praised the middle-aged man after an hour of tests.

“Then can I ask what kind of price you think it will sell for?” asked Long Chen. This was the important part.
