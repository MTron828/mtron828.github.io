Chapter 3901 Regret

“Run!”

As a monster of legends was charging over, countless people fled in terror, not daring to fight it directly.

In front of this unknown existence, they were all terrified. As a result, the ones attacking the Dragonblood Legion fled like the tide.

BOOM!

However, when the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox’s claw fell, those people were dumbfounded. This legendary existence’s attack wasn’t as powerful as they had imagined.

A dozen powerful experts were enveloped by that attack, and just as they thought that they were definitely dead, they actually managed to block it.

“What…?”

Everyone was dumbfounded when they saw this result. Was this not the legendary Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox? Or was the legendary Demon Fox not as powerful as they had imagined? Was it just an exaggerated legend?

As those dozen powerful experts defended with all their power, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox was actually knocked back. It staggered, forced to retreat a few steps before managing to regain its footing and stabilize itself.

“Fuck! Working with you has weakened me countless times! I can’t even kill a group of insects now!” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox roared furiously, its killing intent erupting. That terrifying killing intent did not match its power level.

“What Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox? It’s nothing more than a bedtime story. Slaughter this Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox, and our names will ring throughout history!”

One of those powerful experts shouted and actually charged forward.

However, he had just moved when the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox bizarrely appeared behind him. With a clench of its claws, he was turned into a blood mist.

“You little ants dare to say that you will kill me?!” roared the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox. After killing that powerful expert, it vanished once more.

When it reappeared, it was hundreds of miles away. It was actually capable of teleportation.

BOOM!

Once again, a dozen experts were struck by its claws. However, they were not killed and merely blown away.

“Other than spatial movement, do you have no other powerful techniques? Why are you only using this one technique?!” demanded the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox. It was speaking to Bai Xiaole.

“I don’t know how to use them,” admitted Bai Xiaole timidly.

“Fool! I really regret it now! I shouldn’t have accepted you as master! Your Spiritual Strength is weak! Let me take charge. Just support me!” barked the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

“Yes!” Bai Xiaole directly agreed. He then just lay on the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox’s head, seemingly falling into a deep slumber.

A deafening roar erupted from the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox, reverberating through the air. From its gaping maw, a sinister ripple blasted outward. Just like that, anyone caught within the path of this ripple met a grim fate, disappearing without a trace.

In an instant, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox eradicated hundreds of thousands of experts around it, leaving behind only a haunting emptiness. The horrifying power displayed by the fox sent shivers down the spines of all who witnessed its devastating attack.

“What a garbage technique. What’s the point of just transporting people away?!” muttered the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox to itself irritably.

Just then, a terrifying expert came charging over. This was a peak expert who had merged his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone.

“Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox? My Heavenly Qilin Leopard race will accept you!”

“Heavenly Qilin Leopard race? You aren’t even fit to carry the shoes of my Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox race. Scram!” shouted the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox. It opened its mouth and shot out a sphere of light.

BOOM!

The sphere of light tore through the void, blasting that heavenly genius away. But it seemed that it didn’t cause any substantial injuries to him.

“You really piss me off! I’m weakened to this extent? What’s the point then? Brat, wake up! I’ve decided to terminate our contract. We’ll both take back our spiritual seals,” roared the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

Hearing this, the slumbering Bai Xiaole instantly woke up. He worriedly said, “Don’t! Since we’ve become companions, we can’t just leave! We have to accompany each other in life and death!”

After merging with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox, Bai Xiaole found that it was incredibly terrifying. But because his power was limited, it was unable to excavate its full potential.

As a result, having gained such a terrifying companion, Bai Xiaole refused to let it go even if he had to be beaten to death. No matter what, he had to keep it by his side.

“Accompany each other for what? Your Three Flower Pupils are so weak. If you were just limiting my power, that would be one thing. But you don’t even know many pupil arts. What’s the point of being with you?” demanded the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

“My boss will help me improve my pupil arts!” cried out Bai Xiaole.

“And your lack of techniques?” retorted the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

“My boss will teach me those too!” said Bai Xiaole shamelessly.

“Bullshit, your boss doesn’t know pupil arts. You can’t trick me. I only accepted you to use your pupil arts to awaken my sealed bloodline. But you are worthless and can’t help me. This contract is supposed to be mutually beneficial, but right now, I can’t gain anything. It’s a waste of time. So, I’ve decided to terminate the contract. We can go separate ways, and you can find someone more qualified than me,” shouted the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

Bai Xiaole hastily said, “My mother is an expert in pupil arts! It’s just that my cultivation technique isn’t high enough for her to transmit her superior pupil arts to me! If you stay with me, once we’re out of the three thousand worlds, I’ll definitely work hard at cultivating pupil arts! You’ll be able to benefit then!”

“I don’t believe you. You are trash, and I’m not gambling on this. The contract has yet to be fully locked down by the Heavenly Daos, so we can still part ways here. But if more time passes, this contract will be set in stone and it will no longer be possible to part. I’m not taking that risk,” said the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox frostily.

“No, I refuse to rescind the contract!” Bai Xiaole's voice trembled, tinged with a hint of desperation and sorrow. He couldn't bear the thought of relinquishing his contract with the fearsome Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

However, no matter how he begged, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox refused to agree. It urged Bai Xiaole to do this voluntarily, or it would be forced to kill him in order to terminate the contract.

“Hey, don’t you only want Bai Xiaole to control stronger pupil arts? What about the Heavenly Eye race’s pupil arts? Are the pupil arts of the Six Dao Heavenly Eye acceptable?” shouted Guo Ran suddenly.

“What?” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox was stunned, staring at Guo Ran in shock. “Are you telling the truth? Do you have the inheritance of the Six Dao Heavenly Eye?”

“I don’t, but my boss does. That’s the same as Bai Xiaole having it. If you don’t believe me, you can check my soul. The memories are there,” said Guo Ran confidently.

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox stared at Guo Ran for a moment before its body suddenly quivered. An expression of wild delight appeared on its face.

“Alright, then I’ll accept your boss as master.”

“You…!” Bai Xiaole almost wept.

“Tch, do you think you’re worthy of my boss? My boss has already formed a lifelong contract with another, and there's no room for a second,” Guo Ran snorted with disdain, his voice dripping with mockery and scorn.

Hearing this, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox hesitated. After a long moment, it finally said, “Fine. For the inheritance of the Six Dao Heavenly Eye, I’ll accept this brat.”

“Yes!” Bai Xiaole was overjoyed. With such a powerful comrade, he felt like his future was full of light.

However, Bai Xiaole's celebration was abruptly cut short as the void collapsed, unleashing a torrent of ominous black qi. In an instant, a razor-sharp claw tore through the ruptured space, hurtling toward Bai Xiaole with malicious intent.

This attack came out of nowhere, and so suddenly that no one could react in time.
