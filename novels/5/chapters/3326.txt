Chapter 3315 The Feather Race’s Kun Wu

“After being imprisoned for three days, it seems that he didn’t learn his lesson. As soon as he’s released, he comes to find trouble. He doesn’t want to swallow this anger,” snorted Bai Shishi.

“If he could swallow his anger, he could only be a dead person,” said Long Chen indifferently. He wasn’t even upset with Yang Zicong’s provocation. After discovering the Devil Eye Water Lilies’ magical ability, his mood was amazing. Even this provocation didn’t affect him.

“Boss, I’ll go shut him up,” said Qin Feng.

However, Long Chen surprisingly shook his head. “No need. Someone else will shut him up.”

As soon as he said this, whistling rang out and hundreds of experts converged on Yang Zicong. His provocation ended in an instant.

Qin Feng and the others were startled and then laughed. It seemed that Yang Zicong was being forced to act obediently. If he dared to resist, he might be dragged away again.

Compared to when they first entered the city, the atmosphere on the streets was much more tense.

Other than the human race, several other races had appeared. Some were demons covered in scales, and some were horned monsters. Moreover, there were also some unknown winged creatures. Lifeforms from other domains had all come for the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

Every now and then, hostile divine senses would sweep through the crowd, not giving a damn about other people’s feelings. The air was cold with killing intent.

Some people were left terrified by these races that they had never seen before. After all, they possessed frightening auras. Some of them had even reached the peak of the Four Peak realm.

With the divine light covering the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s capital city, clearly their cold pressures were unleashed only to intimidate their competitors. If anyone dared to cause trouble inside the city, they would be executed by the grand formation.

BOOM!

In the distance, they heard loud explosions, along with clashing divine light.

“People are fighting again! Quick, take a look!”

A large portion of the people on the streets rushed out of the city, so Long Chen and the others followed.

However, by the time that they arrived, the battle was already over. There was a lifeform with a pair of wings and a halberd in its hand standing in the air. Beneath his body was a human corpse, and that person's head was destroyed.

“Humans, if anyone doesn’t want to submit, come out!” The winged lifeform shouted arrogantly, swinging his halberd toward those newcomers.

As a result, that lifeform had just finished shouting when a dagger appeared out of the air. With a flash of cold light, the lifeform’s head flew into the air.

“This isn’t a place where you can run rampant. Scram!”

A sneer rang out, stunning everyone. They were unable to even tell who had done this.

That lifeform’s head was cut off, but he didn’t actually die. His head regrew out of his neck, and his expression was one of horror.

The person who had attacked him had clearly shown mercy. Otherwise, they wouldn’t just cut off his neck and spare his life.

“Someone from the Nine Underworld Hall.” Bai Shishi and the others’ hearts shook. That person’s voice was the same as the one who had targeted Long Chen at the plaza.

No one managed to even spot him just now. Such an assassination technique was truly shocking.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded and a golden saber slashed through the air, unleashing golden light that was like a river of stars.

After that, a strange dagger appeared in midair, blocking that saber. Runes then exploded as divine light clashed, and two figures appeared.

One of them was that Nine Underworld Hunter that had targeted Long Chen on the plaza. The other was a large lifeform that was like a small mountain with golden hair.

This lifeform also had a pair of golden wings, but his Blood Qi was astounding. He had golden light emitting from his body that was actually golden flames. The entire world seemed to start burning because of him.

The saber and dagger rumbled, emitting wave after wave of power. It shook the spectators.

“Aren’t you being too arrogant to tell my Feather race’s people to scram?” sneered the winged lifeform, his voice like thunder in the air.

“Is the Feather race so amazing? In front of my Nine Underworld Hall, you aren’t qualified to be arrogant,” replied the Nine Underworld Hunter, not at all losing out to this lifeform’s wild pressure.

“The Nine Underworld Hall? Let me see if I, Kun Wu, can provoke it,” said the Feather race expert.

After hearing him state his name, Long Chen narrowed his eyes. “Interesting. No wonder I felt that his aura was a bit familiar.”

“What? Do you know him?” asked Qin Feng.

“No. But examine his aura carefully. Does it remind you of anyone?” said Long Chen.

Qin Feng and Qi Yu suddenly both shook. “Kun Pengzi?”

Through Long Chen’s reminder, they realized why his aura was familiar. It was quite similar to Kun Pengzi’s.

“How can this be? Are they connected?” asked Qi Yu.

“The immortal world’s Feather race is similar to the Martial Heaven Continent’s ancient races. The Feather race are the descendants of the flying bird races and the human race, while the descendants of the land beasts and the human race call themselves the Titan race. Then, the descendants of the scaled beasts and the humans call themselves the Dragonpeople race. Just like on the Martial Heaven Continent, these descendants abandoned their identity as part of the human race, discarding that part of their bloodline. However, contrary to the Martial Heaven Continent, they have the support of other races here. So, they are very powerful and have the capacity to be arrogant. In the desolate era, the human race was at the bottom of the food chain, struggling just to survive. The beast races were the true overlords of that time. When it comes to inheritances, the human race definitely can’t compare to them. Naturally, sucking up to the beast races will benefit them more. There’s nothing to nitpick about,” said Long Chen.

Just as Long Chen was explaining the origins of the Feather race, the Nine Underworld Hunter indifferently said to Kun Wu, “The Kun surname? You have a trace of the Divine Kun’s bloodline. I suppose that does give you the right to be arrogant. But I, Tian Mo, am ranked seven on the Nine Underworld Hall’s Heaven Fiend Rankings. That isn’t at all inferior to you, don’t you think? Unless, do you wish to decide just which one of us is greater right now?”

Long Chen hadn’t heard of the Heaven Fiend Rankings, but it should be the rankings for their most talented geniuses. Otherwise, this Nine Underworld Hunter wouldn’t be able to act so arrogantly.

“The Heavenly Rainbow has appeared, so I don’t want to waste the effort. However, you’ve insulted my Feather race. There will definitely be a battle between us. Once the Heavenly Rainbow Curtain descends, we’ll decide which one of us is better. The loser will have to kowtow in apology,” said Kun Wu. He seemed to have some understanding of the Heaven Fiend Rankings and actually pulled back his saber.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Now it was Tian Mo’s turn to put away his dagger. He coldly said, “It just so happens that I also want to experience the divine abilities of the Divine Kun race. Just how much have you inherited to be so arrogant?”

After saying that, Tian Mo’s gaze swept across the crowd. When he saw Long Chen, he made a throat-cutting gesture toward him and then faded into the void.

Before anyone could react to that, Kun Wu also turned to Long Chen. Suddenly, his gaze sharpened.

“You have dragon blood. I want it.”
