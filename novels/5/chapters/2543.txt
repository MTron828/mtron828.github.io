Chapter 2532 Mother God

As soil poured into the giant hole and covered the giant tree’s roots, a strange phenomenon occurred. The giant tree ceased fracturing, and its wounds slowly healed.

“The primal chaos bead has never disappointed me.”

Seeing that the soil of the primal chaos space was effective on the mother tree, Long Chen relaxed. The primal chaos bead was truly miraculous.

The Luo Spirit race’s warriors unleashed a heaven-shaking roar upon seeing the mother tree suddenly start recovering. More tears flowed out.

“Big brother Long Chen, you’re amazing!” Suddenly, a person ran over excitedly.

When Long Chen saw her, he jumped. “Qi Li, didn’t you…”

Long Chen had clearly seen her die. But now she had reappeared.

“The Life Spirit God saved me. Hehe, I’ve now been bestowed the position of divine envoy. You are our god, so I am your humble servant!” exclaimed Qi Li.

“There’s me too!” La Wei ran over, just as excitedly. This foolish fellow was smiling brightly.

La Wei had also gone crazy when he had seen Qi Li die. He had charged over, resulting in him almost being torn apart by the Black Armor Corps.

It was the Life God Tree who had stretched out a root and pulled her back from the death god’s hands. She woke just in time to see La Wei going crazy for her.

Although he had many faults, he was willing to sacrifice his life for her. Those flaws were covered up by that moment.

Qi Li held La Wei’s hand. She respectfully said, “In the future, the two of us will be big brother Long Chen’s servants. We will carry out your divine edicts.”

“My divine edicts?” Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He was no god. Without the mother tree, he would have been the one to die here. What world would have such a weak god as him?

Li Qi didn’t want to disturb Long Chen, so she pulled La Wei over to Meng Qi and the others to introduce themselves. Now her status was different. As the divine envoy, she had to form a good relationship between the Luo Spirit race and Long Chen’s side.

Qi Li quickly started chatting away with Meng Qi and the others, but when La Wei arrived in front of Gu Yang and the others, he didn’t know what to say.

Wilde in particular was a nerve-wracking sight. He was constantly popping meat into his mouth like a ferocious beast. It felt like a touch from him could accidentally crush La Wei.

La Wei’s mouth moved repeatedly. Other than putting on a smile that looked as ugly as crying, he couldn’t say a word.

Gu Yang laughed and clapped his shoulder. “Someone who fights alongside us in battle is a brother. If you don’t know what to say, then don’t say anything. Once we get closer, we can drink together.”

Suddenly, Wilde collapsed, causing everyone to jump. Meng Qi immediately ran over and examined him.

“He’s fine. He used up too much energy so he has entered a self-preserving state. After sleeping awhile, he’ll be able to keep eating.”

Wilde had used up an enormous amount of energy during this time, as he had been fighting Zhao Ritian all on his own. Considering that the latter was a Sovereign sprout, Wilde’s power was truly astounding.

After that, several Dragonblood warriors carried Wilde away to a comfortable place for him to sleep. He would probably be asleep for a few days. They were used to it.

Meanwhile, Long Chen was still busy pouring the primal chaos space’s soil into the giant hole. The withered tree was finally showing a bit of vitality.

“Thank you.”

Suddenly, a mental transmission entered Long Chen’s mind. Long Chen was far too familiar with its aura, as he had been blessed by its power. It was the mother tree.

“You can stop. Nine star heir, my life seed has germinated, so my life is no longer in danger.” The voice rang out in his mind once more, filled with gratitude as well as respect.

“Don’t worry, I have plenty of soil. If it can help you, I don’t mind,” said Long Chen.

As long as he circulated his spiritual yuan, he could replenish more of the primal chaos space’s soil. Furthermore, considering its size, filling even a ten thousand mile hole was no problem.

Other than that, he also felt that considering the mother tree’s ancient existence, perhaps it knew many things. He would like to create a good relationship with it.

Suddenly, a root broke out of the soil and coiled around Long Chen’s feet. Dense life energy poured into Long Chen’s body.

Before this, the mother tree’s power had been limited, and it had only been able to suppress Long Chen’s injuries. However, now its life energy began to truly heal them. Its energy was many times greater than the Life Spirit God.

“I wonder if the mother tree’s branch can be transplanted into the primal chaos space? If I could grow such a giant tree, I’d also have an undying body.” Long Chen couldn’t help being moved.

Although Long Chen hadn’t expressed it, he was quite envious of Zhao Ritian’s undying body. Even Liu Ruyan’s undying body was something he wished he had.

If he could raise a powerful companion like the mother tree, other than someone blasting him apart in one blow, he would also have an undying body.

“Eh? The primal chaos space’s soil hasn’t dropped at all.” Long Chen suddenly realized that the soil level inside the primal chaos space was not falling. He had expected it to fall at least a few feet to fill this hole.

When he looked more closely, he found that even as he took out the soil, more appeared automatically.

“When did it gain this ability? Is it related to the Six Star Battle Armor?” Long Chen was startled to notice this change.

The primal chaos space hadn’t grown. But its aura seemed to be a bit different than before. However, he was unable to say what part was different.

He continued bringing out more soil. Countless roots absorbed its energy, and the mother tree’s branches suddenly began to glow, releasing an emerald light. It no longer had its sickly appearance.

Tender buds slowly appeared on top of its withered branches, and the Luo Spirit race’s warriors began to chant something. It seemed to be some ceremonial rite.

Light fell from the mother tree, bathing the Luo Spirit race’s disciples. Their expressions were of fierce piety.

Even the Martial Heaven Alliance and the Xuan Beasts’ disciples were bathed in this light. They felt like they were immersed in warm sunlight. Their bodies relaxed, and their pores automatically opened, absorbing the surrounding Life Qi.

The pain, sorrow, anger, and other emotions of battle faded. It felt as if they had returned to the embrace of their mothers. It was warm and comfortable.

As for Long Chen, he could clearly feel his injuries healing. His body that had been on the verge of collapse was returning from the brink.

Those injuries were no ordinary wounds. They weren’t just wounds of the body but could be considered Dao wounds.

The activation of the Six Star Battle Armor had caused a serious backlash. The Six Star Battle Armor had the power to suppress all other Daos, but just because those Daos were suppressed didn’t mean that they wouldn’t bite back.

This kind of situation hadn’t occurred with the Five Star Battle Armor. Long Chen guessed that it was because the Six Star Battle Armor that he had summoned was not the complete version, resulting in this kind of Dao wound.

Perhaps when he could fully control the Six Star Battle Armor, this kind of backlash would no longer occur.

His forceful activation of the Six Star Battle Armor still had him feeling fear. The power of the Six Star Battle Armor was truly terrifying. It was not something he could control. It was like a giant reservoir, and he had only opened a small hole. He was barely able to control that small hole.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If that hole had grown any larger, the entire dam might collapse, and this entire world might be destroyed.

Long Chen could clearly sense that condensing the sixth star was not as simple as he had thought. Although it seemed that he had condensed the six stars, it also felt like they had already existed long before that. They had inestimable power.

Long Chen had never been able to figure out their power. He understood far too little about the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. But this time he had learned just how terrifying it was.

As chaotic thoughts whirled around in his head, Long Chen suddenly realized that the hole had long since been filled up. The mother tree was filled with vitality, and countless green leaves bloomed in the sky. Stars twinkled amongst the leaves.

Long Chen finally stopped adding in more soil. Seeing this giant tree filled with vitality, a roar came from deep within him. “I also need to get such a tree!”

Suddenly, a figure appeared before him. The Luo Spirit race’s disciples exclaimed, “Mother god!”
