Chapter 2767 Sovereigns Appear

Just at this moment, the world changed. The Eastern Wasteland Bell, the Western Desert Ax, the Southern Sea Zither, the Northern Source Sword, and the Central Plains Cauldron’s images appeared in the sky.

The five divine items were finally gathered. Their true bodies were still in everybody’s hands, but the images in the sky seemed to be their souls.

When the light of these five divine items appeared, the Heaven Devastating Bracelet appeared on top of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring.

The Heaven Devastating Bracelet was enormous, so enormous that it terrified people. After absorbing all the blood soul energy, strange runes appeared on its body. They were like countless vipers.

The Heaven Devastating Bracelet was like the hand clutching the heart of the Martial Heaven Continent. Long Chen hadn’t expected Ma Ruyun’s attack to lead to this.

“Senior, are you the spirit of the Martial Heaven Continent?” asked Long Chen.

“I am the heart of the Martial Heaven Continent. All lifeforms of this world were born from me. Right now, there is no longer any way to avoid this calamity, and it is fated that this epoch is to end. I do not fear destruction, but I hope that my children can escape this tribulation. With my final energy, I can aid you in becoming a Sovereign. I only hope that you can save everyone here.” The voice was warm and gentle. It was like a mother’s voice, a voice that was one step from reaching the end.

For some reason, this voice made Long Chen’s heart sad. This was the final warmth that the Martial Heaven Continent could give its people.

BOOM!

Ye Ming once more attacked, causing Long Chen’s blood to flip inside of him. Having become a Sovereign, with Resentful Death City floated behind him, Ye Ming had an unending source of power.

“Long Chen, don’t be afraid. You’ve humiliated me so many times, so I won’t let you die so quickly. I’ll return all this humiliation a hundred times over.”

The void splintered. The laws and Daos of the world crumbled with every one of Ye Ming’s moves.

BOOM!

Long Chen once more blocked and was sent smashing into the ground by a kick.

“It’s useless. Even if you are a nine star heir, you haven’t awakened the Hegemon aura. You cannot win this battle. I chose you as the gamebreaker because you are a nine star heir, but if you want to break this game, you must become a Sovereign. Don’t hesitate,” said that voice.

“If I use your final power to become a Sovereign, you will have nothing else left. You’ll die,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen was well aware of the energy requirement for the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s final Heavenstages beyond the ninth. It was a terrifying amount. He estimated that drawing this energy from the Martial Heaven Continent itself would cause the core to instantly die.

The Martial Heaven Continent only wished to defend this world’s people. How could he cause it to die?

“Don’t worry about me. I’m under the control of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. Even if I don’t die, I will land in their hands and become a tool. But if I die, the Heaven Devastating Bracelet will also be affected. That will be your chance to shatter this board. Once you become a Sovereign, these people won’t be a match for you. I ask you to bring these innocent people somewhere safe so they can continue living…”

“The Heaven Devastating Bracelet!”

Long Chen suddenly had a thought, and the earth exploded as he shot out.

“How long are you planning on hiding? Aren’t you very arrogant? Why don’t you continue?” Ye Ming had been waiting for him and swung his palm at Long Chen’s face.

However, unexpectedly, Long Chen’s hand struck his face first. He then borrowed the power to fly back and avoid Ye Ming’s palm.

At this moment, the altars from the demonic beast race, Blood race, and devil race began to rumble. The auras of Sovereigns began to rise.

“I don’t have any more time to play with you. You can die now!” Ye Ming’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected the others to be so prepared. The Nine-Headed Lion, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord were also about to become Sovereigns. Hence, Ye Ming had to capture the core first, or his odds of getting it would sharply drop.

Stamping on the air, he unleashed a palm that blew Long Chen back, and then a bone spear appeared in his hand, stabbing toward Long Chen’s throat.

Just as the spear was about to pierce Long Chen’s throat, a hand caught the spear, causing Long Chen to be surprised. He was covered in cold sweat. That bone spear was a terrifying weapon that caused his hair to stand on end as soon as it appeared.

A white-robed figure then appeared in front of Long Chen. That figure looked back at Long Chen and smiled.

“Little brother, we meet again.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Big brother Yun Shang!”

Long Chen let out a startled cry. The one to save him was Sovereign Yun Shang.

Ye Ming jumped when he saw Sovereign Yun Shang. His spear trembled, shaking off Sovereign Yun Shang’s hold. At this moment, he was completely bewildered. He looked around and suddenly became terrified.

Long Chen followed Ye Ming’s gaze. At some point, a figure had appeared beneath each of the five supreme divine items.

Long Chen then saw Sovereign Qing Xu, Sovereign Mo Li, Sovereign Han Wei, and Sovereign Zi Yang. The five Sovereigns had all appeared at once.

Looking at the Sovereigns, the people at the core cheered, kneeling. They were so emotional that some of them wept.

With all five Sovereigns appearing, they felt that the Martial Heaven Continent would be saved.

“Long Chen, go. Listen to her arrangements. Her wishes are our wishes. You once asked me why we had died. I didn’t answer you back then, but I’ll tell you now. No one was capable of killing us. We voluntarily died, returning our karmic luck back to the world so that it could continue surviving. One generation after another, we waited for the one who could break this hopeless deadlock. Now, we have reached this era.” Sovereign Yun Shang patted Long Chen’s shoulder. “I believe in you. You can definitely do it.”

“A dead person shouldn’t be so meddlesome! Die!”

Ye Ming was first afraid, but then he realized that he was already a Sovereign, and his opponent had died. What was he afraid of? Hence, he unleashed another attack with his spear, encompassing both Long Chen and Sovereign Yun Shang.

Sovereign Yun Shang then unleashed a palm. When his palm met the bone spear, cracks spread in the air, and the spear was stopped.

Sovereign Yun Shang looked at Ye Ming and shook his head. “If I was still alive, you would be dead, your Dao eliminated. You are too weak.”

After that, Sovereign Yun Shang’s palm shuddered, and Ye Ming felt a burst of power knock him back. A trace of blood flowed out of his mouth.

“Long Chen, time is pressing. Don’t be fooled by them. They are nothing more than minor characters,” said Yun Shang. He pushed Long Chen, and Long Chen instantly vanished.
