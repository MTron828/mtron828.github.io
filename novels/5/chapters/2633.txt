Chapter 2622 Great Circle of Netherpassage

Yue Xihan was sincerely grateful to the High Priest for his suggestion. If it hadn’t been for him, Long Chen wouldn’t have dared to allow the original devil race to return to the Martial Heaven Continent. Hence, Yue Xihan bowed deeply to the High Priest.

The High Priest shook his head and stopped her. “The original devil race is a noble immortal race. We are not qualified to receive your bow.”

Long Chen’s heart shook. The High Priest knew even more than he had expected. He actually knew the original devil race’s true origins.

Long Chen then stealthily looked around. Daoist Heavenly Feather and the Music Master were calm, but Qu Jianying and the others were clearly hearing this for the first time.

“Long Chen, that’s about enough. We old fellows should leave, so you can handle the rest.”

The High Priest and the others had only come to the Skyscraping World as a formality, something for the others to see. This action would make those still harboring suspicions toward the original devil race finally give up.

After the High Priest and the others left, Long Chen had Xia Chen construct a new formation diagram here. It was a transportation formation that specialized in defense and prevented experts of the Martial Heaven Continent from entering the Skyscraping World. Even for Long Chen and the others, they would need a special token and signal to enter.

However, anyone with the specific spiritual fluctuations of the original devil race could pass through. It was only outsiders that couldn’t.

Once that was arranged, everyone got to work. At this moment, Long Chen asked Evilmoon, “Is that dragon woman’s divine ability very powerful?”

Evilmoon had mentioned that if she used the divine ability, perhaps she could defeat Long Chen but not kill him. Long Chen didn’t like that.

“It’s very powerful. Even if you were at full power and in the Heavens’ Wrath state, it’s difficult to say who would win,” said Evilmoon.

“It’s that amazing?”

“Did you think that she is called the emperor of the black dragon race for nothing? The barbarian blood black dragon’s divine abilities can summon the power of their ancestors, multiplying the power of their bloodline by ten times.”

“Ten times? Are you serious?” Long Chen jumped. What kind of divine ability was so exaggerated?

“Of course. The evil dragon race possesses an innate devouring ability that is just as powerful. When I fought Yun Shang, I had yet to unleash my full power, nor did I have my Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. That’s the only reason he managed to suppress me in one move. Otherwise, would I have ended up in my current situation? Well, a defeat is a defeat. Finding excuses is the act of a weakling. I say this to you so you understand that the strongest aspect of the barbarian blood black dragon race is pure power. However, she has yet to reach the thirteenth rank, so using that kind of divine ability is extremely dangerous to her. Even if her bloodline is pure, she would have to endure an immense backlash. That’s why I scared her off. With the two of us working together, there’s a chance we could kill her, but the price is too great to be worth it. You just have to be careful around her when she advances to the thirteenth rank where she won’t be afraid of the backlash. At that time, you will come to understand the true strength of the dragon race.”

“Fuck, I thought that the sea demon race would collapse after I killed that fellow. But then this dragon woman appeared out of nowhere.” Long Chen was extremely vexed. Powerful enemies kept coming out one after another, giving him a headache.

“I tell you not to reveal your trump cards not because of them. It’s because of those old demons hiding in the depths. You can sweep through your generation, but you don’t know how many living fossils still exist behind their powers. If your display is too strong, would you be able to stop someone on the level of Daoist Heavenly Feather or even the High Priest who decided to throw away all their faces and kill you?” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen shook his head.

If someone on the level of Daoist Heavenly Feather wanted to kill him, they wouldn’t need a second attack. No stratagems could work in front of absolute power.

“Your weakness is all too clear. They can threaten anyone beside you to force you to come out, so it would be best if you were a bit more low-key. Time is your best friend here. Once you advance to Heaven Merging, you will possess the power to protect yourself even against them,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen nodded. Evilmoon was correct. He was truly in an extremely dangerous state.

If an expert on the old monster class wanted to kill him, he wouldn’t survive unless he decided to hide beside the High Priest the entire time.

However, what if someone targeted his allies? Would he be able to endure then? It didn’t matter if it was the original devil race, the Martial Heaven Alliance, the Xuantian Dao Sect, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, or the Xuan Beasts. If any of them were attacked, Long Chen wouldn’t be able to ignore them.

The more he thought about it, the more vexed he grew. Putting it as simple as possible, he wasn’t strong enough. Otherwise, who would dare to threaten him?

Currently, he had three divine bones. They were of the earth, water, and wind elements. The water attribute divine bone had been discussed with Meng Qi and the others. They had chosen to send it to Nangong Zuiyue due to a lack of other powerful water cultivators.

The earth element divine bone was shared between Li Qi and Song Mingyuan. Since they were sharing one, whether or not either of them could produce a Spirit Bone would be up to their luck.

The wind element divine bone was naturally given to Tang Wan-er. However, it was only possible to merge with the divine bone after entering the Heaven Merging realm. Because of it, Tang Wan-er had long since grown antsy.

Evilmoon was correct. Advancing to the Heaven Merging realm was important to him, as well as the Dragonblood warriors. Their power would instantly soar at that point.

After thinking through this and arranging things for the original devil race, Long Chen announced his own seclusion, leaving everything else to Guo Ran.

He then became a professional pill eater once more, raising his cultivation base to the full circle of the Netherpassage realm, only coming out when he was ready to advance to Heaven Merging at any moment.

When he was out, a month had passed. At this point, he checked the primal chaos space and smiled.

The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had been nourished by the corpses of the demonic beasts and grown twice as tall. Also, their life energy was several times greater than before, which gave him a bit more confidence for his next tribulation.

“Boss, you came out! Something major has happened!” Guo Ran immediately came running over when Long Chen came out of seclusion.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
