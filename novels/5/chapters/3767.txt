Chapter 3756 Miserable Jiang Lei

A flame prison instantly covered this city.

“Which divine being has descended upon my Seven Star City?” shouted one of the human race’s Divine Venerates.

Seven Star City was completely locked down. People were ashen. They had never seen such a terrifying thing before. The scale of this lock was something that terrified even Divine Venerates.

“The Sacred Pill Hall has a warrant for Long Chen’s capture! Everyone stay still, or you will be killed!”

An imposing voice rang out from above. At this moment, countless experts wielding chains descended from the sky. It seemed that they were even reinforcing the formation. There were several Divine Venerates amongst them.

Upon hearing Long Chen’s name, countless people gasped. Just what kind of background did Long Chen have to cause the grand Sacred Pill Hall to send so many people after him?

“My apologies, I have some bad news for you. Just a few seconds ago, Long Chen already left Seven Star City,” said one of the nervous Divine Venerates within the city.

“What?!”

…

BOOM!

With his black dagger, Long Chen cut through the void. Long Chen and Jiang Lei then came flying out of the hole like meteorites crashing into a mountain. As they pierced right through it, Jiang Lei coughed up blood.

Long Chen pulled him up. After that, Jiang Lei wiped the blood off of his mouth and asked, “Boss, the transportation was going well. Why did you stop it?”

The two of them were in the midst of the spatial transportation when Long Chen suddenly pierced through it. That was extremely dangerous. If they were drawn into the chaotic flow of space, who knew where they would end up?

“There’s a fly chasing me. If we continued according to that spatial transportation, we’d probably be surrounded before leaving that city,” said Long Chen.

Before the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts were approaching, Bing Po had sent Long Chen a warning that they were creeping over and setting up a huge trap for him. Hence, Long Chen used the transportation formation to escape before their net was complete.

Interrupting the transportation formation was necessary to prevent the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts from waiting for him in his new location and also to prevent them from doing something to the transportation formation. If the Sacred Pill Hall were to forcibly change Long Chen’s travel path midway, he and Jiang Lei would be doomed.

Now, Long Chen took out the map and looked around. He found that this place was at least ten days’ travel from Seven Star City. They would be safe for now.

Only then did Long Chen have a chance to ask Jiang Lei about his current predicament. Jiang Lei then told him that after ascending, his situation was the most miserable of all. He ended up directly landing on a battlefield between the human race and the demonic beast race. The human race was almost wiped out at the time. With no other way, Jiang Lei forcibly killed his way out of the demonic beasts horde with a single sword, fleeing on a bloody path.

By the time he escaped, he only had half his body remaining. His entire body was covered in flood. The only fortunate thing was that he happened upon a human city. After arriving there, he thought that he was saved and passed out.

However, once he woke up, he found himself locked in chains. He was turned into a servant and sold to the demonic beast race.

That city only managed to exist because the humans there had defected to the demonic beast race. In order to ingratiate themselves with them, they actually sent Jiang Lei to the demonic beast’s side directly.

After that, Jiang Lei was turned into a slave, his body tortured with all kinds of instruments. He suffered pain every single day. If a mysterious voice had not told him that he and everyone else were still alive, he’d have long since killed himself. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

During this time, Jiang Lei ran away three times. The first two times, he was found and almost beaten to death. The third time, he finally succeeded.

After that, he never trusted anyone. He began his journey as a rogue cultivator, an independent wolf that specialized in hunting down demonic beasts and plundering traitors.

It could be said that Jiang Lei’s predicament was the worst out of everyone. He had suffered endless pain and torture. But that still hadn’t beaten him.

In order to survive, he pushed himself to the limit every time. Although he was just an ordinary Primal, he managed to hunt down and kill a Supreme heavenly genius of the demonic beast race. Although he didn’t kill him directly, it was enough to prove his strength.

It was precisely because he had been enslaved by the demonic beast race that Jiang Lei’s hatred for the demonic beast race could be said to be higher than the heavens, deeper than the ocean.

Before entering the three thousand worlds, he had repeatedly warned himself that he had to endure until he gathered with everyone.

However, within Seven Star City, as soon as he faced the taunts and curses of the demonic beast race, he thought of his days enslaved to the demonic beast race. In his fury, he didn’t care about the consequences and directly killed them.

In the end, it was a good thing that he had. Otherwise, Long Chen wouldn’t have noticed him. At that time, Long Chen had been planning on taking a transportation formation.

“Good brother. You’ve suffered.” Upon hearing all that Jiang Lei had been through, Long Chen could only pat his shoulder sympathetically.

“Boss, what are you saying? A sword must be sharpened. Without experiencing pain, how could I have advanced so quickly? Without that bit of power, how could I call myself a Dragonblood warrior?” Jiang Lei laughed it off. He didn’t complain about what he had experienced. Without that life-and-death tempering, he wouldn’t have his current accomplishments.

“Good. Every Dragonblood warrior is outstanding.” Long Chen laughed. He thanked the heavens for not being stingy with him. At least, he had so many good brothers.

“Here, eat this fruit and calmly absorb it. I’ll protect you.” Long Chen handed over the lightning rune Heavenly Dao Fruit.

Jiang Lei consumed it without hesitation. He then sat down and began to absorb its power.

Previously, Jiang Lei was forced to be cautious with everything. Now that Long Chen was here, he didn’t even need to think about anything. He had the utmost confidence that even if the heavens collapsed, his boss would hold them up.

Lightning began to flicker around Jiang Lei’s body, and a Supreme aura slowly manifested.

Suddenly, Lei Linger appeared and pressed her hands on Jiang Lei’s back. Her own thunderforce slowly entered his body. That way, not only could Jiang Lei absorb the Heavenly Dao Fruit better, but he could also merge with more thunderforce.

Two hours later, with Lei Linger’s help, Jiang Lei had become a Supreme expert with an aura of annihilation around him. That was the aura of heavenly tribulation.

In the future, when he underwent tribulation, just like Lei Linger, he could absorb the tribulation lightning to strengthen himself. Not only would that strengthen his physical body, but it would also allow him to control more thunderforce.

When Jiang Lei sensed the lightning runes flowing within his body, looking at the lightning spurting out of it, he couldn’t help raising his head and roaring. It was like he was fully unleashing all the hatred and sullenness he had been holding back.

As his sword came out of its sheath, lightning thundered. Lightning Sword Qi soared into the heavens, tearing a mountain peak apart. Seeing this, Jiang Lei had an expression of wild joy. He felt like he was dreaming.

“Let’s go to a land of treasures!”
