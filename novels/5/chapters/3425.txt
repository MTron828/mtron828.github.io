Chapter 3414 Intolerable Bullying

“Seventy thousand?!” Long Chen’s expression sank.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Divine Lord Immortal Realm was about to open, so now numbers appeared on his tablet. However, they wanted him to pay seventy thousand immortal king crystals to enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.

That was even more than what it took to rebuild the seventh branch academy. This was clearly an attempt to target him and not allow him to participate in the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.

“How can it be so expensive?!” Lei Yuner was also shocked.

“Isn’t the highest supposed to only be ten thousand? Could it be… they based this price on having reached the top in all seven aspects?” wondered Ying Bokong.

Lei Yuner agreed with that guess. Someone who maxed out the testing gate would have to pay ten thousand immortal king crystals. That was because when they entered the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, they would gain the most benefits and use up the most of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm’s energy. Naturally, the ticket price was increased for them.

However, no matter how powerful an individual’s four peaks were, the price was still based on only one peak. It was definitely bullying for them to require Long Chen to pay for seven.

They had clearly said that Long Chen couldn’t possibly cultivate all seven powers at once, thinking that it was either his cultivation technique or some treasure that interfered with the testing gate.

They had also said that they would discuss how he should pay later. But to demand seventy thousand immortal king crystals and to only announce it just as the Divine Lord Immortal Realm was about to open? It was clearly extortion.

“The Sacred Pill Hall is growing more and more tyrannical! They definitely do this on purpose!” raged Lei Yuner. But there was nothing she could do.

Lei Yuner, Long Chen, and Ying Bokong then rushed to the gathering place. There were countless people here already.

“Oh? The princess of the Lightning Falcon race actually has such an ugly expression? Did you suddenly run out of money?” A mocking voice greeted them.

It was the Water Mallard race’s Wu Ying. She was smiling delightedly at them.

“Bastard, so it was you!” raged Lei Yuner. Wu Ying had clearly known in advance about this, so it must be connected to her.

“So what? It was the result of multiple noble races such as the Water Mallard race, the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, the Golden Barbarian Bull race, and the Blue Eye Bright Scale race requesting the Sacred Pill Hall to do this. How can a little human be allowed to enjoy the same treatment as us, demonic beasts? He must pay an accordingly high price first,” sneered Wu Ying, mocking them.

“Just wait!” Lei Yuner ground her teeth, wanting to attack her right now.

“What can you do if I wait for you? Do you dare to bite me?” taunted Wu Ying.

“You really are a fool. Do you know what targeting me will bring you?” asked Long Chen darkly. His anger was starting to climb.

“It will bring me joy. Just seeing how angry you are is making me very happy, hahaha!” laughed Wu Ying.

“It really is delightful. Hasn’t your Lightning Falcon race fallen for this fellow? I’m sure you can think of a way to pay!” At this moment, the large eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race also walked over with a sneer.

“Oh great princess, now that the Divine Lord Immortal Realm is about to open, all those not participating in it have left. Hehe, if you want him to participate now, you’ll have to see if you have the immortal king crystals. Hahaha, seventy thousand immortal king crystals is no small amount. If you beg me, I don’t mind lending you a hundred,” sneered a large man whose face was covered in black splotches. His eyes were blue-green.

His voice was very cold, just like his aura. It was a very uncomfortable feeling. It was like his blood was cold, and his soul was cold as well.

This person was from the Blue Eye Bright Scale race. It was not a dragon race, drake race, or python race. Instead, it was a specific serpent race.

They had a serpent’s sinisterness and cautiousness. Their inheritance was an ancient one. Although their fame was not on the same level as the Lightning Falcon race, they were still a very powerful race.

Most importantly, they were the leader of the scaled beast races and mortal enemies of the flying beast races. This expert naturally was opposing Lei Yuner.

Lei Yuner looked at a giant hourglass and killing intent filled her eyes. “Alright. You wish to join forces against my Lightning Falcon race? Do you think that we’re afraid of you?”

“No, we’re not targeting the great Lightning Falcon race but a lowly human. Respected princess, please don’t randomly accuse others of things. It would affect our relationships and the unity of the demonic beast race. We are only targeting this little fellow, and we hope that you won’t end up losing your life just for a lowly human,” sneered another demonic beast, his smile completely fake.

Long Chen’s anger was rising with every single time they called him a lowly human. Icy killing intent rose in his heart.

“Hmph, despicable people. Do you think that you can stump me like this? Just wait!” Lei Yuner gloomily turned back to Long Chen. “Don’t move. I’ll borrow some from others.”

“Borrow from others? The great Lightning Falcon race’s princess actually has the face to borrow money from others? Hahaha, we definitely have to watch carefully,” sneered Wu Ying.

“I want to see just who has the money to lend to the Lightning Falcon race,” said the eighth prince, intentionally talking loudly as a threat to everyone. Clearly, anyone who lent Lei Yuner money would offend the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, the Water Mallard race, and the others.

“Master, I’ll go borrow some too. I have quite a few friends,” said Ying Bokong, running off.

In just a bit, he came back, dark-faced. Clearly, he had not managed to borrow any money and had even been insulted.

Long Chen patted his shoulder comfortingly. He felt that this Ying Bokong was not bad. The latter dared to try to help him in front of so many people. Long Chen was prepared to send him some medicinal pills to increase his Spiritual Strength after they left the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.

Under the eighth prince and the others’ disdainful gazes, Long Chen waited six full hours. Just as the hourglass was about to run out, Lei Yuner returned.

“It’s a good thing that I didn’t spend any of my money at the market. I finally got enough,” said Lei Yuner excitedly.

Seeing that her forehead was sweaty, Long Chen knew just how anxious she had been. He nodded. He would remember this favor.

“So what? Once he dies by my hands in the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, that money will have been spent for nothing,” said the man from the Blue Eye Bright Scale race.

Long Chen eyed him and told Lei Yuner, “When we get back, I’ll give you a snake belt. It’ll be very colorful.”

Hearing this, that man laughed sinisterly. Just as he was about to speak, the sound of a bell resounded, shaking the entire plaza. Everyone instantly became silent.
