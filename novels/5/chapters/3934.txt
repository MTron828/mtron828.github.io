Chapter 3923 The Soul Hooking Terror Devil From the Hell of Ceaseless Pain

This lifeform’s outer form was translucent, revealing the details of its skeletal structure. Within its chest cavity, everyone could see the Nine Underworld Luocha.

At this moment, she was covered in blue flames, her lifeforce being consumed by this lifeform.

“How vicious. She actually sacrificed herself.” Mo Nian and the others felt chills when they saw this.

Although Mo Nian had predicted that the Nine Underworld Luocha had some terrifying trump cards, he hadn’t expected her to be so vicious, actually sacrificing herself in order to kill Long Chen. Even if she could kill Long Chen with this trump card, she wouldn’t survive either.

“Long Chen, even if I have to die, I will drag you down with me to protect the sacred dignity of the Asura race!” howled the Nine Underworld Luocha inside of this lifeform.

Suddenly, the world quivered and ripples of energy slowly tightened around Long Chen. Those ripples then condensed into a dark-red halo above Long Chen’s head.

After that, the sickle-wielding lifeform opened its eyes, and a terrifying deathly will wrapped around Long Chen.

“Long Chen, you’ve been locked down by the Soul Hooking Terror Devil from the hell of ceaseless pain! It will hunt you to the edge of the world! After you die, it will drag your soul into hell. You will never reincarnate and will suffer for all of eternity!” The Nine Underworld Luocha’s sinister voice was like that of a ghost.

“Oh, hell? I’m so afraid.” Long Chen put on a terrified expression before disdainfully saying, “You act like no one has ever gone to hell. Is it so amazing? Big brother Guhong told me to be on guard against this technique of yours, telling me not to force you too far. Actually, I didn’t force you at all. It was you being too childish, so don’t blame me.”

“Shut up! Repent in hell! Realize that the great Asura race isn’t something that you can blaspheme!” roared the Nine Underworld Luocha. All of a sudden, she vanished and all her power, her very life, instantly merged into this lifeform’s body. After this, there would no longer be a Nine Underworld Luocha in this world.

When she vanished, the Soul Hooking Terror Devil suddenly opened its mouth, revealing thousands of needle-like teeth. It smiled sinisterly at Long Chen.

Its sickle then swung through the air like lightning, bringing with it a gust of wind that sounded like millions of malicious ghosts wailing for souls.

“AHH!”

Screams rang out from the Dragonblood warriors. Those with weaker Spiritual Strength felt like millions of maggots were devouring their souls. It was torturous. Even with their willpower, they couldn’t help but scream.

“Heavenly Soul Barrier!” Meng Qi’s quickly formed hand seals and summoned a spiritual barrier. However, the sound could not be completely blocked. It still penetrated the barrier, but doing so greatly reduced its effects.

To their surprise, they found that blood was pouring out of many people’s ears. This hell devil was terrifying.

“Its sickle is a terrifying soul weapon. Millions of resentful spirits are coiling around it, and the air of resentment is astonishing. Does it really come from the hell of ceaseless pain?” wondered Meng Qi.

Hell was a place that terrified countless people, said to be the source of all sins. In legend, the most terrible lifeforms of heaven and earth would be drawn there after dying to suffer eternal torment.

However, if those spirits were strong enough, they could slay their overseers, escaping the sea of bitterness and becoming the new overseers. They would then transform their spiritual bodies into physical bodies. Rather than being tortured, they would be the torturers.

As for the hell of ceaseless pain, it was the worst hell where tortures were the only constant thing. They never stopped. Those that could distinguish themselves within the hell of ceaseless pain were elevated into terror devils.

Terror devils were the chiefs of the hell of ceaseless pain. When they were alive, they were the most terrible lifeforms. So, after dying, they suffered endless torment, accumulating unimaginable amounts of resentment and killing intent.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After becoming chiefs, they were like machines slaughtering those that tortured them, unleashing their resentment. They never got tired of killing and torturing, and they never stopped.

However, even after they became terror devils, they weren’t safe because there were also competitions and slaughters between terror devils. After all, they relied on killing to cultivate. If a stronger lifeform were to be born in their domain, they would have to crush this lifeform immediately to stop it from growing.

If it did grow, it would become another terror devil, and its first goal would be to kill the terror devil that had tortured them. Thus, hell’s terror devils were true killing machines.

“Troublesome. This Soul Hooking Terror Devil is no ordinary terror devil,” said Mo Nian with a hint of worry in his voice.

“What are you talking about?”

“I’ve been through the passage to hell while robbing tombs, and I encountered one of hell’s terror devils there. Using my full power, I barely killed it and took its bone-carving blade. That’s one of my most difficult battles. That terror devil was most likely a skinner terror devil from the skinning hell. It had white flames on it, but this one has blue flames. Its tier is probably even higher than the one that I killed,” said Mo Nian solemnly.

“Then is boss in danger?

“It should be fine… Long Chen possesses the sacred light of the ancestral dragon. He can resist the corrosion of hell power. His Spiritual Strength is also powerful… Careful!” Mo Nian suddenly shouted, causing everyone to jump.

Long Chen had repeatedly dodged the Soul Hooking Terror Devil’s sickle. But this time, he unleashed a golden fist, wanting to directly exchange blows with its sickle.

“Don’t break it! I want that sickle!” shouted Mo Nian.

“You fucker!”

Guo Ran and the others cursed Mo Nian as that shout had terrified them.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist smashed into the sickle, causing his golden light to explode along with blue flames, painting the world with gold and blue colors. However, both colors clashed and refused to mix.

The immense power tore at the dome of the heavens, making the entire world seem like it was about to split in two.

After the clash, Long Chen began to unleash a tempest of attacks. With his Blood Qi soaring, the dragon in his manifestation swiftly surged to the sky and let out a dragon cry. He was finally fighting seriously.

“Hey, I wasn’t joking! I really need that sickle, so don’t break it!” shouted Mo Nian.

Long Chen then grabbed that giant sickle and kicked the Soul Hooking Terror Devil’s arm.

“Let go!”
