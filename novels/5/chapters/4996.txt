Looking at the crowd of experts flying above, Long Chen instantly spotted the Heaven Overseer leading the group. Behind him were experts wearing various robes, each exuding a terrifying aura. These figures were on par with the four Heavenly Saints.

The Heaven Overseer also saw Long Chen, and he witnessed Long Zaiye’s death. A chill ran through him as he realized that, in his absence, Long Zaiye had once again done something suicidal, and this time, he had succeeded in courting death.

The Heaven Overseer pretended not to notice, but the others saw it, causing a ripple of shock to spread through the crowd. A Heaven Saint with a heaven vein had been slain, a reality they found hard to believe, especially within the Long clan’s territory.

“Long Chen?” A pleasantly surprised voice rang out from their midst, coming from an elegantly dressed beautiful woman.

Long Chen recognized the voice immediately. It was Feng Fei, and her presence startled him.

“Cough, everyone, let’s not tarry here. The clan leader has been looking forward to seeing you. We should get to business,” the Heaven Overseer said, awkwardly coughing as he continued to lead the group away.

These experts were no fools; they could sense something was amiss. However, it wasn’t convenient for them to inquire further at that moment.

As the others moved on, Feng Fei ignored their curious gazes and flew down to Long Chen’s side. She said, “I didn’t expect to see you here! This is great.”

Feng Fei was excited to see Long Chen. However, upon seeing the fresh grave and Long Zaiye’s corpse, she instantly felt embarrassed. Putting on a more solemn expression, she said, “I’m sorry…”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A trace of warmth surfaced in Long Chen’s eyes. His relationship with Feng Fei was a bit complicated—not enemies and not necessarily friends. He felt that her position was very vague.

However, seeing someone who had ascended to the immortal world with him, Long Chen felt a bit excited, especially after the recent events. Feng Fei’s arrival made him feel an indescribable kind of familiarity.

Long Ziwei was instantly captivated by Feng Fei’s noble air. Upon sensing her aura, he was shocked to find that she was a Heavenly Chosen with an extremely heavy aura, far surpassing Long Xiangkun.

Clearly, she had become a Heavenly Chosen a while ago. However, this seemingly peerless fairy actually… idolized Long Chen? Long Ziwei could see the reverence in her eyes.

A powerful Heavenly Chosen idolizing Long Chen? She had forsaken her group and approached Long Chen despite the curious gazes of others? This revelation reshaped Long Ziwei’s perception of his boss.

“I’m glad to see you here as well,” Long Chen replied warmly, returning her smile.

Feng Fei smiled warmly and seemed to be struck by a sudden realization. She softly said, “In my heart, you will always be an undefeatable battle god. Nothing can stop you from advancing, right?”

At this moment, Long Chen realized that Feng Fei actually had a deeper understanding of him than he had thought. He nodded in acknowledgment. On the path of cultivation, obstacles and sorrows were inevitable.

Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu were clear examples of this truth, while Fang Liude’s tragic fate was another reminder. The only way to avoid this kind of pain was to get stronger and stronger.

I have to become so strong that I can set my own laws… laws that no one can go against.

“Why have you come here?” asked Long Chen.

After looking at the people around them, Feng Fei replied, “We should walk as we talk.”

It seemed that this matter might involve some secrets. Before Long Chen went with Feng Fei, he handed a spatial ring to Long Ziwei.

Long Chen instructed, “I leave you in charge of everything here. What everyone needs is inside this spatial ring. If something happens, activate the communication rune, and I will immediately come.”

The spatial ring was packed with primal chaos spirit stones and various medicinal pills, enough to sustain them for a few months.

After entrusting everyone to Long Ziwei, Long Chen followed Feng Fei toward the Long clan. He intended to demand an explanation regarding Long Zaiye’s actions.

For Long Zaiye to act so arrogantly toward the mercenaries, he had completely ignored the new laws that Long Zhantian had fought for. In that case, weren’t the Long clan’s words no different than a fart?

Long Chen was unable to comprehend it. They were all descendants of the Juili race. Even if the mercenaries didn’t have the Jiuli bloodline, they still had the Jiuli rune in them. That meant they should be one family, so why would the Long clan treat them like this?

With her hands clasped behind her, Feng Fei walked alongside Long Chen. She walked gracefully, occasionally skipping like a girl in the springtime of youth. With a shy smile, she occasionally glanced at Long Chen.

Long Chen was originally in a bad mood, but Feng Fei’s act made him smile. He asked, “What are you looking at me like that for?”

“It’s a rare chance for us to be alone. I’m happy. After all, we’re old acquaintances. From the mortal world to the immortal world, isn’t this the first time we can talk alone?” Feng Fei laughed. Her dignified self suddenly became mischievous, exuding another kind of beauty.

Long Chen shook his head with a wry smile. “Back in the mortal world, the Long, Ye, Jiang, and Zhao divine families stood high above everyone else, while I was merely a rogue from a secular empire. When we met, almost all our interactions were hostile. However, there is one thing I have to thank you for. Thank you for not hating me.”

“Why would I hate you? I didn’t even have the time to love you!” teased Feng Fei, though her face turned red despite her jest.

Embarrassed by her comment, Long Chen was unsure if she was serious and found himself at a loss for words.

Seeing his reaction, Feng Fei burst into laughter. “I was just teasing you. You have so many lovers already. You know the saying, ‘where there are many wolves, there’s not enough meat.’ With my power, it’d be hard to get even the soup, let alone the meat, so why bother?”

“What are you talking about? Your analogy doesn’t quite fit,” Long Chen said, shaking his head. Unbeknownst to him, his mood had lightened just from their playful banter.

After their lighthearted exchange, Feng Fei turned serious. “Let’s get to business. I don’t know if we’re simply fated to be enemies, but you are likely to be targeted again this time.”

“Targeted? Why would I be?” asked Long Chen.

Feng Fei glanced at him and gestured toward the insignia of the Jiang clan’s disciples on her sleeve, letting the implication hang in the air without speaking a word.

Long Chen’s eyes widened as realization dawned. He recalled the disciples’ robes and suddenly considered a chilling possibility.

“It couldn’t be!”
