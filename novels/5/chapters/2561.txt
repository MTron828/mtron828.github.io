Chapter 2550 Long Aotian

A giant leopard with glossy black fur came rushing over like a bolt of black lightning.

With its final leap, it roared and a violent soundwave shook the void.

The leopard was carrying a chariot made out of immortal gold, and the chariot was so big that it was like an entire palace. Tens of thousands of white-robed young experts were standing on top of it, all of them wearing swords on their belts.

After the chariot stopped, four beautiful white-robed maidens opened the door, and a man walked out.

This tall, thin man had black shoulder-length hair. He was extremely handsome with bright eyes and sharp eyebrows. His white robes were untouched by dust.

A three-foot-wide ring of light was behind his head, and there seemed to be the sun, moon, and stars revolving within the ring. Divine light enveloped him, making him seem like a divine king.

As soon as he arrived, everyone clearly felt Heavenly Dao energy rush toward him, as if prostrating to him. It was like a look from him could control the Dao.

This person’s chariot also had the marking of the divine families. In other words, another terrifying Sovereign sprout had just appeared amongst the divine families.

“Long Aotian, why should I give you face? Have you forgotten that it was that fellow called Long Chen who didn’t give us any face when we underwent our tribulations in the Immemorial Path? Fortunately, the head intervened in time, sending us to another world to complete our tribulations. Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten. I’ve already investigated and know that this Long Chen is the same Long Chen from back then. Are you telling me that the always arrogant Long Aotian is going to forget about this just to accept a loyal dog? Perhaps you can forget it, but I, Ye Liangchen, cannot. If you don’t like it, why don’t we make a bet right now? We can bet whether or not I can kill him once he comes out,” said Ye Liangchen, just as arrogantly as before.

Long Aotian frowned. “Ye Liangchen, the times have changed. The Martial Heaven Continent requires everyone useful to unite, hence, any past grievances can be settled after the dark era. Fighting amongst ourselves will only make us lose face.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Hahaha, give it up. Lose face? Do you think my Ye family is stupid? Your Long family doesn’t give a damn about Long Chen’s potential. You just want his secrets. You want to know how he raised a group of trash into elites. Is talking so sanctimoniously interesting? Who do you think you can trick?” Ye Liangchen laughed contemptuously.

Everyone present realized that Ye Liangchen came from the divine families’ Ye family, while Long Aotian came from the divine families’ Long family. It was rumored that the two families had some conflicts between them. It was no wonder the two of them would immediately act so hostile to each other. However, Ye Liangchen’s words were truly sharp. He didn’t give the Long family any face, directly saying that the Long family’s care for Long Chen was just a trap.

Just as they were clashing, more experts arrived. All the large figures of the Martial Heaven Continent had gathered, so Ye Liangchen’s words caused quite a bit of private discussion.

After all, his words were extremely reasonable. There were many things that didn’t make sense about Long Chen’s rise.

He had been trash at cultivation but had suddenly soared. The most inexplicable thing was that he had raised a group of trash along with him, turning a group of unremarkable people into the world-shocking Dragonblood Legion.

Anyone with the slightest brains would know that Long Chen definitely had some secrets. However, as his position rose, people gave up on finding out. No one had the guts to go after him.

However, now that Ye Liangchen mentioned it, everyone’s heart shook. Although the divine families were supreme existences, whether or not the Long family was intent on learning Long Chen’s secrets was truly unknown.

Quite a few people felt some respect for how sharp Ye Liangchen’s words were. Just like that, he managed to create some conflict between Long Chen and the Long family.

Long Aotian’s gaze turned colder. “Ye Liangchen, don’t judge the heart of a noble with the character of a petty little man.”

“Me, a petty little man? Hahaha, if your Long family really was a noble, back then, your Long family wouldn’t have-”

“Shut up!”

Long Aotian’s shout was like thunder shaking everyone’s ears and soul. After that, they involuntarily quivered. That voice was like the furious order of a god.

“What a terrifying will!”

People were horrified as this shout contained violent pressure. In that instant, they had lost their connection to Heavenly Dao energy.

It seemed as if a shout from Long Aotian could strip their Heavenly Dao energy away. That stunned everyone. What kind of power was this? Without Heavenly Dao energy, how could anyone fight?

“He truly is worthy of being a Sovereign sprout. He has started merging with the Heavenly Daos at the great circle of Netherpassage. He’s essentially half a step into that realm.”

The speaker was the most senior of all the elders on the Martial Heaven Continent. She was Daoist Heavenly Feather of the Divine Ice Palace. No one knew her true age. All they knew was that everyone in her generation had died.

Daoist Heavenly Feather always maintained the appearance of someone in her twenties, making countless women envious. She was the only one capable of maintaining their cultivation base and looks forever.

In the cultivation world, there were plenty of old men but few old women. Many women were afraid of aging, so they sacrificed a great deal of their longevity to maintain their youthful looks. Once their longevity was exhausted, they would rather die beautiful.

Hence, Daoist Heavenly Feather was an extremely mysterious existence on the Martial Heaven Continent. Therefore, she instantly drew everyone’s attention when she spoke.

“Senior, just what is the realm above Netherpassage? Why can’t it be mentioned?” asked someone.

Many people’s expressions changed when that person asked the question. He was an Elder whose cultivation base had reached the third step of Netherpassage. But even then, his sect leader immediately dragged him back, chided him, and apologized to Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Daoist Heavenly Feather smiled slightly. “It cannot be said. It is because the next realm relates to the heavens. Speaking of it will draw karma. Within every generation, the first to say that name will have karma target them, and they will very likely die immediately. This can be considered a warning by the Heavenly Daos. If you don’t mind me making a presumptuous guess, I’d say it is because the Heavenly Daos are not happy with those who speak of this realm. Those who draw the ire of the Heavenly Daos all have bad ends. Wasn’t Heavenly Fate Island destroyed because of this as well? They were only able to divine the tiniest hairs of fate. Moreover, they were only able to divine man but not the Heavenly Daos. If they had tried to divine the nature of the Heavenly Daos, they would have long since been destroyed. This karma is why so many people know the name of this realm, but refuse to tell their disciples. It will draw karma to both the speaker and the hearer. Unless…”

“Unless what?” Everyone hastily asked.

“Unless there is someone who guesses the name of this realm. By voicing this fate secret, this name will no longer be taboo. However, the one to say it will definitely be in trouble and targeted by the heavens. That is why the senior generation warns the juniors not to wildly guess. If they do guess correctly, it won’t be good for them,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Everyone came to a sudden comprehension. No wonder they were always sternly chided when they asked their seniors about this.

“No, that doesn’t make sense either. If it can’t be talked about, why do so many people know it?”

“Because amongst the senior generations, there have been some unlucky fellows to shout it out. Those people died but benefited everyone else. That’s why the people in those generations know the name, but they cannot say it,” sighed an extremely old man with a cane.

“I wonder which unlucky bastard it’s going to be this time?” It was unknown who mumbled this.

Everyone looked at each other. It seemed that this secret was going to be exposed soon. The Martial Heaven Continent had entered its most flourishing age, and the geniuses were preparing to attack the next realm. Once they did, there would definitely be someone to accidentally shout it for everyone else.

“Long Aotian, don’t talk down to me. In our thirty-seven battles, we’ve never managed to decide a winner. Do you think a bigger throat can scare me off?” In reply to Long Aotian’s roar, Ye Liangchen merely sneered. But he did not mention that topic again.

“Ye Liangchen, with me here, you can’t kill Long Chen. The divine families will also not permit you to do so. If you just want to humiliate him a bit, perhaps the divine families won’t care, but you’ll have to face a strict punishment if you kill him,” warned Long Aotian.

“It’s just a dog. So what if I kill him? Do you think the divine families will take my life just because of a dog? Today, I’m going to kill Long Chen. We’ll see who can stop me. We can make a bet if you want,” said Ye Liangchen lightly.

Just at this moment, another war chariot came rumbling over. Upon seeing it, Ye Liangchen snickered.

“Jiang Wuchen has come as well. Now, everyone who had to suffer that tribulation has come. Let’s see how you stop both of us.”
