Chapter 4412 An Offering for a Declaration of War

“To play such a game with me, you’re far too naive, child!”

Long Chen tightened his hand and ripped Netherdragon Tianye’s head off, causing a rain of blood to fall.

“No… don’t kill me!” Netherdragon Tianye screamed in terror as he finally submitted.

With his head in Long Chen’s grasp, his headless body transformed into a headless dragon. As soon as that enormous body appeared, Long Chen tossed it into the primal chaos space.

Netherdragon Tianye differed from regular dragons, as he had somehow condensed a Neidan—an exceedingly valuable item. Although Long Chen wasn't certain about its use, he was convinced it was a treasure.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, Netherdragon Tianye’s forehead lit up, and a hole appeared in the space behind him, looking like a fiend’s eye staring at Long Chen.

“I knew you would have such a thing on you,” said Long Chen with a slight smile.

“Who dares to bully my son?! Report your name!”

A cold shout came from the other side of the hole, sounding tyrannical and mighty, like an imperial edict.

This was a terrifying existence. By crushing Netherdragon Tianye’s throat and putting away his body, Long Chen automatically triggered the protective seal on Netherdragon Tianye.

“Boss Long San,” answered Long Chen indifferently.

“Are you a human? No, you have dragon blood on you, and it’s true dragon blood. Just who are you?!”

“Are you deaf? I already told you that I’m Boss Long San,” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen understood that the individual on the other side of this opening was a formidable presence, likely Netherdragon Tianye's father. Most probably, he was an authentic Saint.

“I don’t care who you are! Release my son and we can let bygones be bygones. Otherwise, I will make you beg for death! Not just you, but also your whole family, your entire sect, your-!”

“AH!”

White flames suddenly appeared on Long Chen’s hand, burning Netherdragon Tianye’s head. The latter then let out a miserable scream.

“What did you say? I didn’t hear you. I’ll trouble you to speak more clearly, word by word, then I’ll be able to understand you,” said Long Chen, cupping his ear and turning toward him.

“You…!”

The owner of that tyrannical voice was enraged but didn’t know what to say. After all, his son was in Long Chen’s hands, so he couldn’t just attack Long Chen. If he kept acting tough, his son would suffer.

“This was all a misunderstanding. The nether dragon race has no direct conflict with the Earth Spirit race, and my son Tianye was simply instigated by others into doing something foolish. I offer my apologies to the Earth Spirit race. We will prepare generous gifts as compensation, and then this matter can count as over. How’s that?” said the owner of the tyrannical voice as he turned to the distant Ye Ling.

Clearly, this expert thought that Long Chen was allied with the Earth Spirit race. He could also sense that Long Chen was extremely difficult to talk to, so he preferred to communicate with Ye Ling.

Ye Ling was taken aback and remained at a loss for words. It was Long Chen who seized control of the situation once more. “Old fellow, you don’t need to waste the effort. The only reason I didn’t directly kill your son was to draw you out and tell you something.”

“What do you want?” The owner of the tyrannical voice instantly went cold. Although he spoke through space, a chilling killing intent permeated the world.

Unaffected by that killing intent, Long Chen indifferently stated, “I want to tell you that in this world, there exists an individual named Boss Long San who will wipe out your nether dragon race, so prepare yourself.”

“Courting death!”

A furious roar came from the other side of the hole, shaking all the lifeforms here. They became dizzy, and some of the weaker experts directly fainted.

“Say whatever you want. Consider your son, Netherdragon Tianye, my declaration of war against your nether dragon race.”

The white flames on Long Chen’s hand suddenly soared, and Netherdragon Tianye let out a chilling scream.

“STOP!”

A giant claw stretched out of the hole, but at that moment, the hole collapsed, preventing the claw from attacking.

What collapsed along with it was Netherdragon Tianye’s head. The heavenly genius of the nether dragon race, someone close to becoming a Heavenly Doyen, died just like that.

Following that, the world gradually returned to tranquility. The terrifying pressure of a Saint vanished, and the world resumed its usual state.

Immediately, the experts that had been attacking the Earth Spirit race scattered, fleeing for their lives as they worried about Long Chen turning his attention to them. Even Eternal experts were afraid of him.

Some of the Earth Spirit race’s experts want to pursue them as vengeance for their fallen comrades, but Ye Ling commanded them to stop.

This was truly a case of not chasing cornered enemies. The Earth Spirit race was already exhausted and on the brink of collapse after fighting for so long.

If they were to pursue these experts now, once they were split up, it would be easy for their enemies to ambush them with a counterattack. It wasn’t worth the risk.

“Great hero of the human race, you have offended a very frightening existence for us. My Earth Spirit race will definitely stand with you until the end.” Ye Ling came to Long Chen’s side, twisting her left hand in front of her chest in an ancient form of etiquette.

Long Chen returned her etiquette and smiled. “Senior is too courteous. I possess the dragon race’s inheritance, so I naturally have the responsibility of cleaning up the dragon race’s trash. The nether dragon race is fated to be my enemy, and this has nothing to do with the Earth Spirit race- Senior!”

Long Chen suddenly let out a startled cry. Before him, Ye Ling swayed and collapsed. Long Chen hastily caught her. Following that, the other experts of the Earth Spirit race rushed over.

“Not good! The Saint has used up too much of the life divine stone’s energy, and due to her realm being suppressed, she cannot recover her energy. If this continues…!” cried an elder.

“What will happen?” asked Long Chen quickly.

“Her realm might forever fall,” stated the Eternal expert in a panic.

Long Chen was startled. If that happened, didn’t that mean that even if she returned to the Esoteric Spirit World, she would no longer be a Saint? If she wanted to become one again, she would have to recultivate this realm.

“What do we do?!” Everyone was panicking like ants on a hot pot.

“What if we bring her back to the Esoteric Spirit World?” asked Long Chen.

“We would be sending ourselves to our deaths, but the issue is that there isn’t enough time. It will only take a few hours for the life divine stone to regress. Ahh, it’s our fault for being useless…” These experts were fraught with anxiety and couldn’t think of anything.

“Don’t panic. I can save this big sister.”

At some unknown point, Little Crane had woken up. She came over, and Long Chen was startled and delighted to see her.
