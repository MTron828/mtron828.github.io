Chapter 4643 Cheating

BOOM!

The blood-colored magma within the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest churned violently, sending wild waves crashing about, frightening the Dragonblood warriors.

Following that, they saw a figure come flying out of the core and smash through walls before slamming forcefully into the final wall.

“Boss...!”

The Dragonblood warriors cried out in shock as their revered boss was flattened like a pancake.

Long Chen then peeled himself off the wall and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“I’m fine. You guys, just keep going.”

Long Chen wiped the blood off his mouth. Stamping on the wall, he once more shot back toward the core of the dragon nest.

Rumbling rang out, and a short while later...

BANG!

In front of the Dragonblood warriors’ shocked gazes, Long Chen came flying back again, his expression ugly. He then gritted his teeth and charged back.

“You’re quite arrogant for someone with so little ability.”

Just then, the Dragonblood warriors heard a snort come from the depths of the dragon nest. Although they couldn’t see where it came from, this voice contained a will to split the heavens and shake the world.

The Dragonblood warriors were stunned. They hadn’t realized that there was such a terrifying fellow deep within this place.

“You think you’re so amazing? If we were in the same realm, I’d definitely beat you until you cry today!” shouted Long Chen in reply.

“The same realm? As you wish. Let me see if the Dragon Sovereign’s vision is wrong or not.” The owner of the voice also seemed to be provoked. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“As you wish!”

Long Chen stamped on the air and shot back.

This time, Long Chen fought for the span of an incense stick burning before being sent flying once more.

“Seems like you were bragging off too soon. I’m getting embarrassed for you,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“If I didn’t provoke him, he’d refuse to fight me like this. It’s the perfect chance to master how to use my astral energy. I’ve already won by getting him to fight me,” remarked Long Chen. He then took a few breaths and charged back in.

Hearing this, the Earth Cauldron understood Long Chen’s intentions. Long Chen was using this expert of the Sovereign clan as a grindstone to hone himself. Just as Long Chen said, this expert looked down on him, so Long Chen’s continuous provocations had succeeded in provoking him to fight in the same realm. It just so happened that the Sovereign expert also wanted to teach Long Chen a lesson.

As the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest rumbled, huge waves of magma soared like tsunamis.

Long Chen and the Sovereign expert’s fight caused some difficulty for the Dragonblood warriors. They were like tiny boats floating on a raging sea, looking like they might collapse at any moment.

However, in order to see what was happening, they were doing their best to get to the core region. Unfortunately, they were always pushed back by the waves before they could do so.

Long Chen and the Sovereign clan’s expert repeatedly fought. At first, Long Chen was only able to last for five minutes against him, but as they fought, Long Chen’s control over his astral energy improved, along with his understanding of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art.

Just as Long Chen said, as long as the Sovereign clan’s expert fought him, Long Chen would win. In a real battle between experts, every single move was filled with subtle profundities, allowing Long Chen to see the true power of ancient experts.

Fighting against an expert of this caliber, Long Chen was growing with every passing moment. He was one of those rare geniuses who excelled against powerful opponents. The stronger the opponent, the more they could draw out his potential.

Long Chen possessed a natural talent for combat. This talent didn’t normally show itself, but against peak experts, it would shine like a diamond.

Despite facing repeated defeats against this expert, his thirst for victory only intensified. Over time, his Dragon Soul Body Forging Art and astral energy began to harmonize more effectively, allowing him to gradually turn the tables.

At first, Long Chen could only passively defend, but after several days, he was capable of attacking and defending, gradually taking control over the battle tempo.

The Sovereign clan’s expert indeed possessed a terrifying dragon might, majestic Blood Qi, and sharp techniques. He seemed to have countless divine abilities at his disposal.

However, with his immense combat experience, Long Chen had the ability to memorize and counter any move after encountering it just once. By the third repetition, Long Chen could use that opening to launch a counterattack.

At first, the Sovereign clan’s expert had looked at Long Chen with complete disdain, as Long Chen was truly lacking when compared to the Sovereign clan’s geniuses from the immemorial era. Furthermore, he was from the human race.

However, due to a specific reason, he had no choice but to accept Long Chen. As a result, after he encountered Long Chen, he wanted to erase all other auras on Long Chen, turning him into a full member of the dragon race.

After suppressing his cultivation base and fighting Long Chen for a while, the Sovereign clan’s expert marveled at Long Chen’s almost monstrous adaptive ability and rapid learning capacity.

At this moment, he could only use a technique he had not revealed before. This was the only way to catch Long Chen off guard and gain an advantage. However, he soon discovered that the effectiveness of his techniques diminished significantly upon subsequent uses. Overusing it would only expose openings for Long Chen to exploit.

This Sovereign clan expert was an ancestral dragon of the Sovereign clan and a king who had once led an era. Naturally, his experiences were extraordinary.

However, he had never seen someone with such monstrous adaptability and learning capacity like Long Chen. Now, his disdain toward him was gone, and his expression also grew serious.

Nevertheless, his attacks grew even sharper, and his divine abilities became so violent that the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was shaking like it would explode at any moment.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen’s arms broke, and blood sprayed out of his mouth. As he shot back like a shooting star, the sound of bones breaking echoed throughout the dragon nest.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors cried out in shock. This time, their exchanges had lasted almost six hours. With their understanding of Long Chen, they knew that the longer the battle stretched, the greater Long Chen’s odds of victory should be. How did he suddenly get beaten so badly?

“He cheated!” exclaimed the Earth Cauldron, not able to bear this anymore.

The Sovereign clan expert had suppressed his realm to the World King realm but now suddenly undid that suppression, instantly creating a large power disparity between them.

Long Chen took a deep breath. Recovering his injuries as fast as possible, he once more shot toward the core.
