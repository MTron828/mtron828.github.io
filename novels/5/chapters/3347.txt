Chapter 3336 Final Smile

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s body crumbled. Seeing this, Long Chen was enraged and he looked toward the ancient capital. The towering statue of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was also crumbling.

Someone had actually snuck in and destroyed her statue. As the city was protected by a grand formation that prevented foreign races from entering, this must have been done by a human.

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue was destroyed. Having lost the support of her faith energy, her body dispersed. The chains were unable to hold her and she transformed into millions of rainbow runes that were devoured by that mouth.

“NO!”

Long Chen roared. He opened his left eye once more, the three flower petals reappearing. But before he could use the power of the Purgatory Eyes, an illusory figure appeared in front of him. It was the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

“I am not your family or an old acquaintance. There’s no need for you to go all-out like this. You should know that if you use that power again, you will very likely die.” The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy looked at Long Chen tenderly, like a warm big sister looking at her brash little brother.

“Every kind life should be treated with warmth. I won’t watch as you die!” shouted Long Chen.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In truth, even he didn’t know why he was acting like this. But he was unable to just watch as she died in front of him. Even if it was only the faintest hope, he had to try it. As for the danger, he no longer cared.

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy smiled. That smile was very warm. “Good. For you to be able to think like this, I’m at ease. Don’t feel bad. As a spirit of heaven and earth, I am like the snow in winter. When spring comes, the snow will naturally melt. When winter comes, the snow will fall once more. Flowers bloom and wither. Are you going to remember every single snowflake? The snow of last year might not be the snow of this year, but there is essentially no difference. As long as you care about her, any snowflake is her.”

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy smiled sweetly and rubbed Long Chen’s cheek gently. 

“This is all fate. I have long since predicted this result. But I’m very happy. That little girl who took the Heavenly Rainbow Flame has the spiritual mark of the last generation’s Heavenly Rainbow Flame. It will definitely be able to unleash exceptional brilliance in her hands. My mission can also be considered complete. As for you, you have even brought me a nice surprise. I cannot see your future, but I trust that it will definitely not be lacking…”

Suddenly, that mouth clamped shut, devouring all the rainbow runes. After that, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s figure vanished. The final bit of her heroic spirit was gone.

“AHHH!”

Long Chen raised his head and roared like a wounded beast. His killing intent exploded. With a flash, he appeared within the ancient city.

Long Chen spread his hand and flame energy exploded, transforming into chains that wrapped around the necks of dozens of experts in the city, raising them into the air.

“Why?! Why?! Why did the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy sacrifice her own life to protect the human race, but you cannot even let off the final bit of her discarnate soul?! Are you devils?!”

Long Chen’s voice was dripping with killing intent. His face was frightening. He clenched his teeth so hard that they almost shattered. It was these people that had joined forces to break her statue while everyone was fighting their joint enemies.

Losing the statue was like losing her foundation. That was what resulted in the final trace of her discarnate soul falling.

Hatred overflowed from Long Chen’s heart. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had done so much for the human race. But what did she gain in the end?

“Tell me!”

Long Chen roared. A terrifying qi wave directly blew apart those experts. Their physical bodies crumbled, and their Yuan Spirits were wrapped by flames. Just that one roar almost shattered their Yuan Spirits.

Long Chen went crazy with rage. Although the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had said that this was fate, he refused to believe in fate.

If it hadn’t been for the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue shattering, causing her faith energy to dissipate, she might not have died. 

Even in her death, she didn’t blame anyone. Her kindness made it so that Long Chen could not possibly forgive these brutes.

“Long Chen, calm down! Don’t kill them! You cannot let them die like this!” shouted the experts from the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. They were crying. Their hatred for these people was not at all inferior to Long Chen’s.

Long Chen unleashed a palm, crushing the head of one of his captives. This Immortal King’s Yuan Spirit shattered. Long Chen used the most brutal, most barbaric method to conduct a soulsearch. As a result, he didn’t see any useful information. But he did see a figure.

“Lord Brahma, you brute, just wait!”

Long Chen roared. This person was actually Lord Brahma’s follower. Then everything was very clear.

These Immortal Kings only had their Yuan Spirits left. They looked in terror at the people around them.

There were now countless experts glaring at them, looking like they wanted to bite them to death.

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue was destroyed, and the rainbow light in the sky was also gone. This signified that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was truly gone. That made the experts of this domain explode with killing intent.

“You are all people from the Heavenly Rainbow Domain! You’ve all received the benevolence of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. Without her, you wouldn’t have your current accomplishments! But you… you actually…!”

An elder pointed at them, quivering with rage. But he was unable to finish his words due to his sobs.

These people were all natives of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. That was what made these elders feel the worst. They could not accept this. The people that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had protected were ultimately those that harmed her.

“Long Chen, don’t kill them. Leave them to us. Killing them is letting them off too easily. We’ll make them beg for death! We’ll make them repent for their sins for eternity!” said an Immortal King while clenching his teeth furiously.

Amongst the captives was a skinny elder who sneered, “Even if you kill us, we’re not afraid. We’re loyal to Divine Venerate Brahma. As long as Divine Venerate Brahma lives, as long as we are loyal, even if we fall into the path of reincarnation, he will bring us back. We will still be powerful experts- AH!”

Before he was done, an expert stabbed his Yuan Spirit with a sword. Smoke then came out of his body and he screamed.

“This Soul Chasing Thorn of mine finally has a use. I’m willing to offer it up for everyone to use, so that every human can extract their toll from your bodies,” said that expert hatefully.

“Starting today, I, Long Chen, cannot exist under the same heavens as Lord Brahma! All followers of Lord Brahma will be hunted to the last! The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was noble and holy. She did so much for the human race but ultimately fell to the human race’s hands. Where is heaven’s justice? If this world has no justice, then I am willing to become a devil. Even if I must fall to hell, I do not mind,” declared Long Chen. Despite overflowing with killing intent, he didn’t kill these traitors.

These people were left to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts. That was because they had more reason to hate these ingrates than him. Long Chen then looked around the city. The outside of the city was in ruins. The battle was over, but there were mountains of corpses and rivers of blood flowing. At this moment, a wave of dizziness suddenly struck Long Chen. His vision darkened. The last thing he heard was Bai Shishi’s cry as he collapsed.
