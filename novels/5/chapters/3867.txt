Chapter 3856 Three Flower Deathblow

At this moment, a three-petal flower mark appeared in Long Chen’s left eye. This was the appearance of the Three Flower Pupils.

Long Chen was using the power of Three Flower Pupils with his Purgatory Eyes. An enormous three-flower diagram then appeared within the world.

When this three-flower diagram covered Long Aotian, his hair instantly stood on end. An intense sensation of crisis also filled his heart.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

His Sun Moon Five Element Flag then quivered and he smashed it at the three-flower diagram. However, the void simply trembled, while the three-flower diagram was untouched. It was visible but somehow invulnerable.

The next moment, the mark in Long Chen’s left eye spun. Only when his cultivation base had reached this point could he barely control the true power of the Purgatory Eyes.

“Three Flower Deathblow!”

Long Chen clenched his teeth, and the flowers in his eye quivered. The spot where they all met was originally empty. But as Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength surged, that empty space became a whirlpool.

Once this whirlpool formed, black blood came out of his eye, and an intense pain struck his soul.

The three-flower diagram was originally illusory, but right now, it became solid in an instant. A strange whirlpool then appeared right in front of Long Aotian.

“Heaven Earth Cover!”

Seeing this strange whirlpool, Long Aotian hastily cried out. His manifestation quivered and the figure’s hand seals changed. A protective barrier then appeared around him.

BOOM!

However, this protective barrier had just appeared when it was destroyed by the whirlpool. The figure behind Long Aotian also exploded.

Long Aotian screamed. Half of his body was devoured by that whirlpool; blood mist filled the air. It was like an invisible beast had just bitten away half of his body.

The next moment, the three-flower diagram exploded and Long Aotian was sent flying. Everyone was shocked to find that half of his golden armor was gone, devoured by the whirlpool.

“Shit, I didn’t have enough Spiritual Strength. I missed.”

Sharp pain stung Long Chen’s left eye as though it was going to split open. Unleashing this attack came at an immense price for him.

Regretfully, as this was his first time doing this and his Spiritual Strength was already exhausted, the center of his pupil art was a bit off-target.

Previously, he had made sure to reserve some power when unleashing the World Extermination Flame Lotus with Huo Linger. Back then, his Spiritual Strength was about eighty percent. He then kept half of that in reserve to use the Purgatory Eyes.

Forty percent of his Spiritual Strength was enough to activate the Purgatory Eyes, but his control was a bit off. If the core of the whirlpool had been accurately placed on Long Aotian’s head, he would definitely be deader than dead.

At this moment, lightning wings appeared on Long Chen’s back. He shot after Long Aotian. The current Long Aotian had lost the support of that illusory figure and was on his last breaths. He no longer had the power to fight. Killing him would require only one move.

“Heavenly Dragon Space-Lock Formation!”

Before Long Chen could get close, countless experts had come over to interfere and set up a formation. They were the experts of the immemorial Long clan.

“A group of ants think they can stop my revenge?”

Seeing these Supreme experts block his path, Long Chen snorted and the Minghong Saber swung out. Even if he was exhausted, his killing intent was still decisive.

“Fool, ignore that Long Aotian! Yin Changsheng is already placing a spiritual mark on the cauldron! If you still do nothing, the bronze cauldron will be taken by him, and you’ll regret it for a lifetime!” Just as Long Chen was about to blast his way through, the dragon expert urged him to give up, sounding completely exasperated.

Only then did Long Chen notice that the floating bronze cauldron was starting to glow. Milky white runes had appeared on top of it.

Yin Changsheng had long since noticed that this cauldron was extraordinary. After he arrived here, he secretly used his Spiritual Strength to commune with it.

This cauldron had countless flame runes on it, so Yin Changsheng used his flame energy to secretly nourish it, hoping to form a resonance with it. As long as he formed a resonance with it, he could place his spiritual seal on it and take it.

However, he was paying an immense price to do so, as he was using his essence blood and faith energy to nourish it through space. After a while, it was finally starting to react, and now he was placing his spiritual mark on it.

This was all done using a secret art that no one else noticed. Only when the spiritual mark was starting to manifest did people notice something.

“Courting death!”

The Nine Underworld Luocha was the first to turn against him. That bronze cauldron was clearly a priceless treasure, but Yin Changsheng actually wanted to take it first.

“Hahaha, it’s useless! The spiritual mark has already been placed! This cauldron is mine!”

Yin Changsheng laughed loudly. In front of the Nine Underworld Luocha’s attack, he didn’t block. Instead, he shot toward the cauldron.

The chains around it were clinking; strange sounds came from them. It was as if the cauldron would escape from its bindings at any moment.

“Sorry, but this treasure has a destiny with me. Don’t even think about taking it.”

At this moment, Mo Nian suddenly blocked Yin Changsheng along with Yue Xiaoqian, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran, not giving him a chance to get close to the cauldron.

“Idiots, no one can take what is mine!”

Yin Changsheng was startled to see them appear in front of him but quickly realized that the figures he was seeing in the distance were no more than illusions. They had all been tricked. However, he was still very confident.

“What? Then I want to try it.” Mo Nian laughed and lightly pulled his bow. His crescent bow completely locked onto Yin Changsheng.

Suddenly, Yin Changsheng slipped out of Mo Nian’s lock, startling him. It was his first time having someone escape from his lock.

Yin Changsheng’s body vanished. When he reappeared, he was on top of the bronze cauldron.

“He… he can already use the power of the cauldron!” Xia Chen’s expression changed.

BOOM!

Mo Nian unleashed his arrow. But before it could even touch Yin Changsheng, it was blasted apart by the divine light of the bronze cauldron.

“Not good!” Mo Nian’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected Yin Changsheng to be so efficient. He could actually control the bronze cauldron!

What they didn’t realize was that Yin Changsheng had gambled. He had fed eighty percent of his essence blood, Spiritual Strength, and faith energy to this cauldron.

He had thought about giving up several times midway because he was worried that the cauldron wouldn’t react even if he fed it all of his power. Then he would lose his chance to fight for it at all.

However, Yin Changsheng was a ruthless figure, so he continued to feed it all his energy until he finally succeeded. After consuming so much of his essence blood, this cauldron finally felt close to him.

The Nine Underworld Luocha, Ji Wuming, Shi Yang, and the others all attacked, but their attacks were unable to touch Yin Changsheng. All their attacks were shattered by the bronze cauldron. Thus, all of their expressions grew ugly.

“Hahaha, accept your fates. I, Yin Changsheng, am the destined master of this cauldron! This treasure is mine! Bronze cauldron, recognize your master!”

Yin Changsheng laughed and shouted. He then fed his remaining essence, qi, and spirit to the bronze cauldron.

A giant rune lit up on the cauldron, and that was the rune to acknowledge a master. This bronze cauldron was on the verge of fully becoming Yin Changsheng’s weapon.

“You’re getting happy too soon. This treasure is mine.”

Suddenly, Long Chen’s ice voice rang out. The three-flower mark once more appeared, this time on the cauldron.

“You…!” Yin Changsheng was shocked.
