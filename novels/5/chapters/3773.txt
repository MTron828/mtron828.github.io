Chapter 3762: Once More Seeing the Mysterious WomanFiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This beautiful woman’s divine radiance lit up the entire world. Countless experts of the Spirit race were kowtowing to her.

This was not Long Chen’s first time seeing her. This was a woman who caused him heartache, and yet he didn’t recognize her.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen saw her in the Heaven Dragon Flame Region, and she transmitted the Nirvana Scripture to him. In the Brahma secret realm, he once more encountered her and obtained the sixth star’s pill formula for the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

When Long Chen saw this woman, a certain memory resurfaced in his mind.

“You are you, you are not you. You are one, you are not one.”

“Nine stars against the heavens. The heavens collapse, gods fall, and blood dyes the sky red. The peak of power? The peak of the Dao? To defy the heavens, is this the final result?”

When she said these words back then, it was like she was speaking right into his ear. His vision changed. It felt like he was returning to the Brahma secret realm.

Long Chen could clearly see a beautiful figure in front of him. It was illusory, but it was that woman.

She looked at Long Chen with familiarity. Her gaze seemed to pierce through to his core. It was warm, gentle, and loving.

She was a peerless beauty and held endless emotion in her. When she looked at Long Chen, her eyes were tender.

“Why must you do this?” The woman opened her mouth. Long Chen couldn’t hear her voice, but he understood what she was saying.

She just stood there in front of Long Chen, yet he couldn’t sense her existence. The two of them seemed to be looking at each other through endless spacetime.

Without being aware of it, tears streamed down Long Chen’s face. He didn’t know who she was, but for some reason, every time he saw her, he was filled with heartache. That pain was like blades slashing and twisting through him.

Long Chen wanted to hug her and cry, but he knew that the person in front of him didn’t exist anymore.

“You are you, you are not you. To throw yourself back into the tribulation of the ten worlds, why bother?” She once more spoke.

“Because I want to save you.” Long Chen spoke all of a sudden. Even he didn’t know why he would say such a thing.

It seemed as if the woman heard him. As a result, tears dripped down her face, and she slowly smiled.

“You are still so stubborn, so domineering. Fine. Even if we are consigned to eternal damnation, I will accompany you.”

Suddenly, this vision vanished. Her figure superimposed on top of the woman the Spirit race was praying to. The two of them were one and the same. They had evoked Long Chen’s memories.

At this moment, this woman was an illusion. However, she was still enveloped by divine light. As they prayed, faith energy thrummed. Long Chen could sense a gentle energy coming from the Spirit race’s experts and entering that woman’s figure. That woman’s divine radiance also basked them in its light. It was a strange cycle.

Jin Yi and the others who had come with her were already kneeling, praying toward the woman. Of everyone present, only Long Chen and Jiang Lei were standing.

Long Chen stared at the woman foolishly. He clearly didn’t know her, but just looking at her filled him with grief and sorrow. He did his best to remember, digging through his memories, but he was unable to remember who she was.

As everyone prayed, the divine light surrounding the woman grew denser. She gradually grew solid and opened her eyes.

She looked at Long Chen. Warm light came from her eyes, and she smiled at him.

At this moment, time and space seemed to freeze. Everything else within heaven and earth faded. All that remained was Long Chen and the woman.

She slowly walked down from the heavens. When she reached out her hand and caressed Long Chen’s cheek, heartache filled her face.

“You’ve suffered so much. Your path was difficult.”

For some reason, hearing her voice almost made Long Chen collapse into tears. It was as if this was the woman who understood him the best in this world. She knew everything that he experienced and knew how tired he was.

However, he remained stubborn and did his best to retain his rationality. He said, “I’m not afraid of bitterness. I’m not afraid of being tired. But I am afraid of loss. It’s like I’ve lost so many things, and I want them all back. Can you tell me if I’ve lost some of my memories? I clearly feel so familiar with you, but I don’t remember you. It’s a painful feeling,” said Long Chen. He was choked with sobs toward the end.

For some reason, he suddenly thought of Yu Qingxuan. Yu Qingxuan had also lost her previous memories. He wanted to know if he was the same as Yu Qingxuan.

The woman looked at Long Chen warmly. She softly said, “People born in this world gain and lose something. No matter how high your cultivation base, no matter how powerful you are, some things simply can’t be forced.”

“I don’t believe it. I ultimately believe that as long as my power exceeds the laws, I can control everything. If I cannot, it only proves that I’m not strong enough. Perhaps I can’t do it right now, but one day, I will definitely be able to create my own world with freedom. I will live free with the people I love.” Long Chen shook his head and spoke firmly.

The woman’s body quivered ever so slightly. A trace of pain appeared in her eyes, and her smile became a bit bitter.

“You did say such things. Even after experiencing countless tribulations, your determination remained unshaken. You are still him.”

“Who am I?” asked Long Chen.

The woman sighed. “Who you are isn’t important. As long as you think that you are you, that is enough. Tell me, do you like the Spirit race?”

“I do,” answered Long Chen without hesitation.

“Why?”

“There’s no why. I just like them. If you must have an answer, I’d say it’s because their hearts are the final pure place in this world. As long as they exist, this world still has hope,” said Long Chen.

The woman suddenly smiled. She looked very happy. She warmly cleaned up Long Chen’s somewhat messy hair.

“Good. There are still differences. You are you, he is him! I’m very happy!”

“Who are you? What is our connection? Can you really not tell me?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking.

“Who I am isn’t important. Our connection isn’t important. What is important is that your heart is pure as well. I am at ease. Now, I should transmit the true Nirvana Scripture to you.” The woman smiled widely. She slowly pressed a hand on Long Chen’s forehead, and countless runes flowed into his mind-sea.
