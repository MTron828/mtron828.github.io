Chapter 3563

This man looked identical to Yan Hong. His eyes were filled with black flames, and his killing intent was soaring.

Standing within these endless flames, he seemed to the god of flames, capable of controlling all ten thousand flames.

“Eighth brother, what happened?”

Just then, a voice rang out and another man appeared. The two of them looked identical.

However, this person’s aura was even more terrifying. He was actually a Divine Venerate with an aura that could devour the heavens.

“Third brother! Ninth brother was slain. You came out too late. If you were just one step sooner… ninth brother wouldn’t have died.”

This eighth brother was Yan Xu’s eighth son, the one who had been beaten by Long Chen. His name was Yan Feng.

Yan Feng had just advanced to the World King realm. As for this one ranked third, he was called Yan Chang. He was a supremely terrifying existence.

When he heard that Yan Hong was slain, he fell into silence. After a long moment, he said, “Show me the images.”

Yan Feng then showed him how he had fought Long Chen from start to end. When Yan Chang saw the golden lotus seed in Long Chen’s divine ring, his pupils shrank to the size of a pinpoint.

“Third brother, what is it? Should we cross heavens and kill this Long Chen? Maybe we can reclaim ninth brother’s core. If we place it in the Primal Chaos Flame Sea, perhaps he will have a chance at rebirth. Other than that, this fellow also has the Ghost Sovereign’s mark on him. That’s an existence from the same era as father. Should we wake father up?” asked Yan Feng.

Yan Chang shook his head. “Father cannot be disturbed no matter what.”

“Then third brother, you can personally go. The others are in seclusion. Crossing heavens comes at too high of a price for me. My realm might drop. But if you go, even though it might use some core energy, you can sweep through the human race’s Divine Venerates,” said Yan Feng.

“It’s useless. The one called Long Chen, his golden lotus seed has a horrifying origin. Its golden flames can counter our Yan Xu Flame. This matter is not so simple.” Yan Chang shook his head gravely.

“How can that be? Isn’t our Yan Xu race the strongest flame of the nine heavens and ten lands? How can there be another flame that counters us?!” Yan Feng was filled with disbelief.

“You’re still too young. In that fight, your flame energy wasn’t weakened due to acting across heavens. It was because the golden lotus seed countered you. That’s why you failed. That golden lotus seed is an existence with major origins. The stronger you are, the greater it will counter you. For this Long Chen to have the golden lotus seed, our Yan Xu line cannot touch him for now,” said Yan Chang.

“No way! If it really counters us, how could Long Chen be pushed to the limit by ninth brother?” Yan Feng still didn’t believe it.

“That is because Long Chen does not know how to use the golden lotus seed. If he learns how to, even if there were ten Yan Hongs, they would all die to Long Chen. Right now, the golden lotus seed has been activated. Although Long Chen still doesn’t know how to use it, once he encounters Yan Xu Flames, it will automatically counterattack. Thus, we cannot directly fight him. If the golden lotus seed activates more, Long Chen might comprehend how to use it. Then it will be troublesome,” said Yan Chang.

“Then what do we do? Just let him get away with this?” demanded Yan Feng unwillingly. Long Chen was merely a little Divine Lord. If Yan Feng was in front of him, he could crush Long Chen with his palm.

However, he wasn’t in the same heaven as Long Chen. The reason that he could attack across heavens back then was because when Yan Hong died, his special spiritual seal detonated, allowing Yan Feng to pass a portion of his power through space.

That was no more than a tenth of his actual power. However, not only did he not manage to harm Long Chen, but his energy was even devoured. Hence, he was enraged.

“Before father went into seclusion, he told me that ninth brother would have a major tribulation in his lifetime. I didn’t expect it to really come,” sighed Yan Chang.

“What…?” Yan Feng was shocked.

Yan Chang continued, “However, danger is danger, but it is also opportunity. For the golden lotus seed to appear is a great opportunity for our Yan Xu race. We need to think of a way to obtain it. But Long Chen also has the Ghost Sovereign’s mark on him. It’s unknown if the Ghost Sovereign has also set his sights on his lotus seed. We cannot force this matter, and we’ll have to come up with a long-term plan. Anyway, there’s no need for you to ponder over this matter any further. Focus on your cultivation. You just devoured the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s discarnate soul. Your realm has not fully stabilized, and now you’ve lost so much core energy. Be wary of your realm falling.”

“Yes, third brother!” said Yan Feng hastily.

After Yan Chang finished speaking, his body broke down, merging into heaven and earth. He vanished from sight.

When Yan Chang was gone, Yan Feng viciously punched the air, causing huge ripples. In the end, he only sighed. Just like Yan Chang, he merged into heaven and earth.

If your line of sight was pulled further back, you would see a world of endless flames. There were nine huge spheres of light within this world, every single one of them millions of miles wide. Every sphere of light contained a figure emitting waves of divine pressure.

But now, one of those figures in the light was destroyed. That sphere of light belonged to a person, but that person would never return.

If your line of sight was moved up, you would see an even larger sphere of light, one that made those nine spheres appear incredibly tiny.

That sphere of light was so big that it was like its own world. Black qi circulated within this sphere, and waves of sinister qi came out, as if some overwhelming devil god was sealed inside of it. Once that devil god was unleashed, it would possess the power to destroy the nine heavens and ten lands.

…

“Long Chen, you trash. You’re nothing.”

“All you know how to do is brag. But what can you actually do?”

“Your body has such power, but you don’t even dare to quickly repay enmities. What do you cultivate for?”

“Open your eyes and look at yourself. Do you even appear decent to yourself? You incompetent coward, hurry up and return this body to me.”

“I will slaughter this world. I will kill as I please. I will use fresh blood to dye these heavens red. I will fill the earth with white bones…”

A voice howled within the endless darkness. This howl was exasperated and flustered.

This was the roaring of his heart-devil. It had taken over Long Chen’s body, and in its delight, it had used a huge amount of dark energy against Yan Feng, not expecting Long Chen to suddenly reclaim control. Hence, it was still resentful of Long Chen.

On the other hand, Long Chen was calm. His will could not be shaken. After all, it could do nothing to him, so all it could do was curse at Long Chen while he was unconscious. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As his heart-devil roared, Long Chen’s inner heart remained incomparably calm. He was in the darkness, but he could see a star twinkling in the darkness.

It was a golden star. Although it was very small, although its light was barely perceptible, it was constant. It was not affected by the darkness. Like a bright lantern showing the way, it showed Long Chen the right direction.

Long Chen smiled. He thought of Aunt Gong’s words to him. Back then, he hadn’t understood, but now he did.

“You’re awake? Drink some wine and warm up your body.”

Long Chen slowly opened his eyes and saw Xia Guhong’s lofty figure.
