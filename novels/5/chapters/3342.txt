Chapter 3331 Destroying Heaven and Earth

The barrier was starting to fade. It was what had prevented anyone above the Four Peak realm from entering, including through the spatial gates.

However, now that it was vanishing, everyone could see lifeforms in the Divine Lord realm and above within the spatial gates. There were even countless Immortal Kings. Due to the suppression of the barrier, they hadn’t been able to enter.

When the barrier vanished, they charged through at Long Chen. The dozens of spatial gates were fully opened and millions of lifeforms roared.

The remaining experts being hunted by Long Chen were rejuvenated upon seeing their reinforcements.

“Long Chen, your death is at hand!” shouted Kun Wu.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They continued to entangle Long Chen, not giving him a chance to absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. They had finally prevailed. With this giant army pouring through, Long Chen was definitely dead. No one could save him.

At this time, those survivors exchanged a glance. Long Chen’s death would signify the Heavenly Rainbow Flame choosing another master. No matter who obtained it, they would have countless allies to protect them, and they could make it acknowledge them safely.

“This bastard, I can’t wait any longer!”

Bai Shishi was so panicked that she was about to cry. Long Chen was now surrounded by an army of millions and millions of enemy experts, but he still wasn’t allowing her to join. It couldn’t be that he really had forgotten about her, right? If she still didn’t join in, Long Chen would die. She then pressed down, no longer caring about Long Chen’s orders.

Just then, a bead appeared in Long Chen’s hand, emitting a light as bright as the sun. This was the devil world’s Heavenly Bead.

At this moment, the entire world shuddered and explosive destructive power caused the world to shake. A sensation of death filled this entire world.

“Not good! He’s detonating the Heavenly Bead! Run!” A devil world’s expert spotted the bead, and his soul almost fled in terror. Only the devil world’s experts knew just how terrifying it was.

This Heavenly Bead was refined out of an entire star, so it contained endless energy. Even if Mo Yan was alive, he was only capable of absorbing the tiniest bit of its power at a time to cultivate. He didn’t have the power to make it detonate.

However, now that it had fallen into Long Chen’s hands, it had been tossed into the primal chaos space. Its will was erased there, and Huo Linger was able to fully control it.

Originally, Long Chen had been planning on having Huo Linger absorb it so that her power could grow again. However, now that he was surrounded by this giant army, he changed ideas. He directly ignited the Heavenly Bead’s power.

“Run!”

The other lifeforms jumped and fled as fast as they could.

BOOM!

Unfortunately, they were too slow. The Heavenly Bead started as a tiny sphere of light that instantly grew until its light devoured the dome of the sky. This entire space became a land of death.

It didn’t matter what lifeforms they were and it didn’t matter if they were Divine Lords or Immortal Kings. In front of that destructive power, they were as weak as ants. Wherever that light touched, nothing remained.

A cold wind blew across the battlefield. Bai Shishi had managed to react in time and flee with Bai Xiaole and the others, escaping the area of sure death.

Fragments of spacetime continued to fly in that region. This was the result of a star exploding.

After the light was gone, everyone saw Long Chen standing in the air, looking down on the destruction.

“Long Chen is fine?!”

Startled cries rang out. After detonating the Heavenly Bead, Long Chen himself was entirely unharmed. That was absolutely shocking.

Long Chen naturally wouldn’t choose to foolishly die with all of them. He was in full control of the Heavenly Bead. So, he detonated half of its power, while the other half of it protected him. Naturally, he was unharmed.

However, even he was shocked by the power of the Heavenly Bead. This was true destruction. Just half of its power was able to annihilate all these lifeforms, instantly emptying this space.

“Long Chen, don’t just stand there! Hurry and absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame! There’s not much time left! If you don’t absorb it still, it will automatically vanish!” shouted an elder from the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

Just as he said this, the spatial gates exploded. Giant hands reached toward Long Chen at the same time.

After that, the nine heavens rumbled. A horrifying aura made people quiver. They were shocked to find that they could no longer move.

The battle had actually startled the terrifying existences of those worlds. The spatial gates were unable to accommodate them, so they could only condense their energy into hands to attack Long Chen.

Long Chen was shocked and infuriated. Just what was going on? Was there no end to this? Did it really have to be so difficult for him to obtain a treasure?

Most terrifying of all, when these hands appeared, they completely suppressed the ten thousand Daos. It felt like he was in a steel river flowing against him. Moving even a single inch was difficult.

These were supreme experts. Even if it was just a portion of their power, it still wasn’t something that Long Chen could resist. Hence, Long Chen’s fury soared, but he could only watch as those hands descended.

BOOM!

A rainbow divine sword slashed down, blocking those attacks for Long Chen. After that, a peerlessly beautiful woman in rainbow robes appeared.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy!”

When she appeared, countless experts watching knelt down and wept tears of emotion. It was the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. She was actually alive.

“I can only temporarily block them for you. As for whether or not you have a destiny with the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, you’ll have to make that destiny yourself,” said the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

“Many thanks!”

Long Chen was delighted. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had suppressed the hands, allowing Long Chen to escape their bindings. He immediately started to absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

Just then, more spatial gates opened within the void. Countless lifeforms came pouring out.

“Hahaha, the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Now is the real moment when the Heavenly Rainbow Flame chooses a master.”

A bald lifeform with two horns on his head smiled sinisterly at Long Chen. His aura was not at all inferior to Kun Wu, Mo Yan, Tian Mo, and the others.

Dozens of experts on that level came out of the spatial gates. They had all been hiding this entire time.

Everyone was stunned. They had originally thought that the battle was over, only for those black hands to come out along with the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

Now even more terrifying experts appeared, and the scope was even greater than before. Just what was going on?

BOOM!

Long Chen swung his saber, blocking that horned lifeform. He then grunted and was forced back several steps. He was severely weakened now.

“Die!”

That lifeform managed to see through Long Chen’s condition with this one probing blow. He instantly smiled sinisterly and launched a killing blow.

Just then, a golden light streaked through the air like a shooting star. That lifeform was turned into golden powder that quickly dissipated.

“I thought that you had forgotten about me.” Bai Shishi appeared in front of Long Chen. He had finally given her the signal.
