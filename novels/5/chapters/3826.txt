Chapter 3815 Heavenly Eye

Long Chen jumped in shock. How could that be? Other than them, who could possibly pass through the Heavenly Dao Bewilderment Barrier?

Long Chen and the others quickly grouped back together. After a while, they started hearing strange sounds in the distance as well.

However, their divine sense was suppressed here. They couldn’t spread it far. They also couldn’t see whatever was making that sound.

“Did you see someone?” whispered Long Chen, coming to Mo Nian’s side.

“No, but I heard their footsteps. It should be a human,” whispered Mo Nian.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“How many people?”

“I only heard one.”

“Let’s take a look.” Long Chen refused to believe that someone else could enter the Heavenly Dao Bewilderment Barrier like them. They then carefully crept over to the sound.

As they got closer, the sound grew clearer. It was a human’s footsteps. However, the footsteps were extremely slow. They started and stopped repeatedly.

Long Chen and the others came to the side of a giant skeleton and stuck their heads over. They finally saw what was making the sound.

It was an elder in ragged robes. His body had decayed, and all that was left was his skeleton. However, his head was still intact, and there were two withered eyes in the eye sockets. He was walking with his head down.

His left hand was clenched in a fist, while his right hand was holding a staff with countless ancient runes on it. It emitted a terrifying aura, so it might be a divine weapon.

The elder used this staff as a cane, tottering onwards. He kept pausing after a few steps and then continued.

His withered eyes were like holes. Every time he stopped, he looked around, seemingly searching for something. A few garbled sounds came from his mouth as if he was calling out to someone, yet also like he was sobbing.

“Is he a zombie?” whispered Guo Ran.

Mo Nian shook his head. “His physical body already died, but his soul essence refused to die with it. As his will refuses to die, that last breath of his refuses to dissipate as well. This person has some kind of great attachment he refuses to part with. He’s not a zombie. A zombie only contains resentment, hatred, and killing intent, but this person doesn’t have that. I just wonder what kind of attachment allows him to continue pursuing it after having died so many years ago.”

Seeing that this elder lacked any killing intent or murderous aura, they all relaxed and slowly got closer. The elder didn’t seem to notice them and was continuing to search for whatever he was searching for.

It was only once Long Chen and the others arrived in front of him that he seemed to sense something and raise his head to look at them. However, when they saw this elder’s eyes, they all cried out at the same time.

“Heavenly Eye race!”

The Heavenly Eye race was a race with absolutely terrifying pupil arts. Their eyes could control the ten thousand Daos of heaven and earth, and they possessed enough power to destroy the entire world.

They were very easy to recognize. They looked like humans, except their eyes contained a strange diagram of the Heavenly Daos.

Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils were a kind of pupil art from the Heavenly Eye race. This elder’s eyes might already be withered, but they could clearly see a plum blossom diagram within his eyes.

When they looked into those eyes, they felt like they were spinning. It was like the world was spinning around them. They almost collapsed, so they hastily distanced themselves and no longer looked into his eyes.

After looking at them, the elder continued lowering his head and searching for something. He continued to keep pausing, using his staff as a cane, and muttering.

Everyone looked at each other, their hearts pounding. Just what kind of secret was hidden within this heavenly tomb?

They saw the skeletons of Supreme experts as soon as they walked in. Now, they even saw a legendary existence. It had to be known that the Heavenly Eye race was on par with the legendary Jiuli race in terms of fame.

However, this expert of the Heavenly Eye race was already dead. Even so, no one knew what kind of attachment he had to still be searching for something.

All of them were terrified. Just which era was this elder from? Even in death, he refused to die? Just what level of existence was he when he was alive?

Even such a terrifying figure ended up dying here. Just what was inside this heavenly tomb?

“This old fellow’s staff is a treasure. Should we take it?” asked Guo Ran, eyeing that staff. It was carved with countless runes, many of which he didn’t recognize. Hence, he couldn’t help being moved.

“Don’t blaspheme this senior.” Long Chen shook his head. If it was another race, he wouldn’t hesitate to take their treasure. But the Heavenly Eye race could be considered part of the human race. He wouldn’t blaspheme a hero of the human race.

“Hehe, I was just joking- ah!”

Guo Ran was in the midst of laughing to cover up his embarrassment when the elder suddenly stopped and looked at Guo Ran, causing him to jump in terror.

Everyone else also jumped and took out their weapons. At the slightest move, they would attack.

“Hey, senior, I was just joking…!”

Guo Ran was terrified after being looked at by those withered eyes. He then hid behind Long Chen.

Suddenly, the elder’s eyes reacted. The diagram within them moved, and light seemed to come from them. After that, a trace of life seemed to return to his withered body. His gaze suddenly shifted to Long Chen.

“Can you bring me to my wife’s side?” The elder suddenly spoke, his voice hoarse. It contained endless sorrow and grief, as well as a begging tone.

“As long as this junior can do it, this junior will definitely help senior.” For some reason, hearing this begging tone, Long Chen’s heart ached. He agreed without hesitation.

Long Chen had a feeling that this was a hero, a hero who had sacrificed everything for the human race. He was a high and noble existence.

Such a hero was actually begging him? The feeling of seeing such a hero reach the end of his life made Long Chen feel terrible.

“Does senior know where his wife is?” asked Long Chen.

“She is here, but I can’t find her. She is my most beloved person. My Heavenly Eye energy was preserved just for her. I want to find her corpse and use my final trace of Heavenly Eye energy to break the restrictions of the Heavenly Daos and reincarnate with her,” said the elder.

Long Chen and the others were shocked. The Heavenly Eye race’s pupil arts were actually capable of something so heaven-defying? Reincarnation was a legend that no one knew anything about.

Even if it truly existed, the legends still said that it had to follow the laws of the Heavenly Daos. No one could defy it. However, this expert who had died for who knew so many years actually said such a thing calmly.

These words caused Yue Xiaoqian’s eyes to redden. This was an infatuated person, someone whose only thought was their beloved. This love had actually driven him for countless years. How could she not be moved?

“Senior, don’t worry. I, Long Chen, will do all I can to fulfill this wish of yours.” Long Chen cupped his fists and agreed to the elder’s request. There was no way he could reject this elder’s last wish.

“Nine star heirs truly are the most trustworthy figures.”

The elder’s mouth trembled as if he wanted to smile, but the flesh of his head was already withered. He couldn’t make such an expression.

“Guo Ran, carry this senior!” Long Chen turned to Guo Ran, causing the latter’s face to instantly turn green.
