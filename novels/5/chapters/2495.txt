Chapter 2485 Flame Prison Traps the Heavens

A black saber flew out of the ground. The current Evilmoon turned this world into a dark abyss. The air of death hung in the atmosphere.

Long Chen grabbed Evilmoon and smiled. “You finally came out. I left the best opportunity to you, so it would have been a shame if you didn’t make it in time.”

“Ha, if it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t even be able to fight that firewood. It’s finally my time to show off. Kill him!” Evilmoon was even more excited than Long Chen. It seemed that it could not wait a second longer.

The Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod finished accumulating power and smashed down.

Long Chen swung Evilmoon. A black crescent moon tore through the laws of space and time. The very world was cut in two and displaced.

This was an attack that didn’t even seem to come from this world. It was something that passed through the past, present, and future. It was an attack that thirsted to shatter the very stars.

BOOM!

A heaven-shaking explosion blasted through the earth. A mushroom cloud erupted into the sky. The stars shook as if they might fall.

This was a clash of two peak divine weapons. The fabric of this world began to fall apart.

A wild tempest unfurled, and wind blades cut giant cracks into the void. The experts behind the barrier turned pale as the wind blades smashed into it. The barrier rumbled and cracked.

Fortunately, the barrier managed to endure. Looking back at the center of the battlefield, they saw a bloody Long Chen with the sinister Evilmoon resting on his shoulder. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Despite being soaked in blood with his robes broken down, he continued to exude the air of a peerless hero.

In front of him was Zhao Ritian. His arms were gone along with half of his body. He had half his head remaining with only one eye.

That one eye was filled with shock and disbelief. He was staring at Long Chen, unable to believe it.

It wasn’t just him who was shocked. In that instant, the exhausted Long Chen had suddenly unleashed unimaginable power. His aura had instantly skyrocketed.

“You were grinding down my energy to expose all my trump cards and kill me. But you didn’t know that the energy that you were exhausting was just the energy of my dragon blood. I can’t summon my dragon battle armor with my dragon blood energy exhausted, but I still have quite a bit of my spiritual yuan. Although it’s not as powerful as my dragon blood energy, it’s enough to kill you.” Long Chen smiled strangely at Zhao Ritian. His body suddenly flickered, and he transformed into a bolt of lightning, hacking Evilmoon down on Zhao Ritian.

Zhao Ritian was shocked and finally felt a bit afraid. He felt the threat of death approaching.

Zhao Ritian’s arms grew back and he formed quick hand seals. As a result, the distant earth exploded, and the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod that had been sent flying shot back.

BOOM!

The Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod was sent flying once more, transforming into a streak of light that pierced through the earth, leaving a bottomless hole.

Zhao Ritian wanted to retreat, but Long Chen’s attack wasn’t stopped by his Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod. Evilmoon continued to strike him and blast his body to bits.

“Long Chen, I have an undying body. You can’t kill me!” Zhao Ritian’s voice resounded through the air.

“Hmph, there is no such thing as an undying person in this world, especially not someone who likes to court death like you.”

Long Chen formed new hand seals, and sacred chanting resounded throughout heaven and earth. It was like gods were murmuring.

Flame runes condensed into flame chains and pillars that sealed this space.

“Heaven Trapping Flame Prison - Seal the Heavens, Lock the Earth!”

With a final shout, the flame prison condensed. As the sacred chanting continued, the flame runes of the prison flickered. They began to shrink.

At this moment, it was possible to see countless tiny metal runes trying to charge out of the spaces between the chains, however, they were blocked by some invisible energy.

The Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod suddenly shot back, but it was sent flying by Evilmoon again.

The Heaven Trapping Flame Prison continued to shrink. The metal runes were trapped inside, unable to escape. Zhao Ritian’s body was quickly forced to appear. He struck the flame prison repeatedly, but no matter what he did, he could only cause some banging sounds. He was unable to break free.

Zhao Ritian was finally afraid. He understood now that as he had been scheming against Long Chen, Long Chen had been scheming against him in turn.

He had wanted to exhaust Long Chen so that Long Chen wouldn’t have the energy to run. But Long Chen had been thinking the same thing.

Under normal circumstances, this flame prison would be unable to trap Zhao Ritian. Now though, his energy had been thoroughly exhausted, and the chains of this prison were unbreakable.

He kept calling his divine weapon to save him, but it was always knocked away by Evilmoon. Furthermore, after being slashed multiple times, cuts had appeared in the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod. If that continued, it might break.

The Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod was a supreme treasure that was tough and heavy. He had never dreamed that Long Chen would possess a weapon that could suppress it.

The flame prison continued to shrink. The pressure inside of it grew as it shrank, and Zhao Ritian was horrified to find that his body was starting to burn.

“What kind of flames are these?!” howled Zhao Ritian.

These flames were actually capable of igniting immortal metal. Although he claimed to possess an undying body, that was under the condition that his source was not extinguished. If he was out of energy, his core would be exposed, and then he could be killed.

“Flames that can burn you to death,” answered Long Chen lightly.

Huo Linger’s flame energy had reached a shocking level. Through constantly refining pills, she had also gained control over this new energy. Even Zhao Ritian’s Million Metal Body could be burned alive.

The prison shrank until it was just three hundred meters wide. Zhao Ritian was under terrifying pressure, and he couldn’t help screaming in pain.

“Zhao Ritian has lost, and absolutely completely at that. A Sovereign sprout actually lost to Long Chen. It really is unimaginable,” sighed someone.

When Zhao Ritian was first trapped, they had been waiting to see if he could reverse the tides. However, even after all this time, all that happened was that Zhao Ritian’s aura weakened, while the flame prison grew stronger. It seemed that Zhao Ritian no longer possessed the power to turn things around.

A Sovereign sprout, someone who had the possibility of becoming a Sovereign, an unrivaled existence, had been beaten. This result was unbelievable.

“Long Chen, you can stop. You’ve won.” Feng Fei suddenly spoke up, sighing. She also hadn’t expected this result.

“Stop? Are you joking?” Long Chen turned to look at Feng Fei disdainfully. “You were the ones acting like all the treasures of this world belonged to you. Did you think about stopping? I was the one who got here first, and I didn’t even go for the four divine bones, but this idiot refused to let things be. If the result was the opposite and I was the one who was trapped, would you tell him to stop? If not, then please shut your mouth. Those who want to kill me have to be prepared to be killed by me.”

Feng Fei coldly said, “Long Chen, you had best think this through. You are publicly going against the divine families.”

“Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed crazily. “How funny. The divine families are right to kill others, but resistance is called going against the divine families? The brains of the divine families are truly special. Don’t threaten me. I don’t know how many threats I’ve heard, but have I ever lowered my head? I do not seek ascension or comprehending the Heavenly Daos. All I seek is to live with dignity. All I have is a group of brothers who are just as unafraid of death as I am. We are all determined to fight with our lives at stake if anyone tries to stop us. If you want to save him, then come. Show me whether my life is tougher, or if the life of two Sovereign sprouts is tougher.”

Long Chen was decisive, not leaving the slightest room for negotiation.

If Long Chen killed one of the divine families’ Sovereign sprouts, that would be a huge matter. But it seemed that Long Chen really was capable of doing such a thing.

Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang exchanged a look, seeing each other’s worry. Long Chen would not listen to their advice. What he had decided on, no one could change. If Long Chen did kill Zhao Ritian, the divine families would pay any price to kill him.

“You should go advise your brother.” Beitang Rushuang nudged Mo Nian.

“Advise? Are you joking? Zhao Ritian should be killed. As for the consequences, who cares? What would be the point of risking our lives cultivating if we have to shackle ourselves for fear of consequences? The worst-case scenario is we die. When we reincarnate, we can continue fighting against the world.” Mo Nian shook his head.

“You… you really are a pair of stubborn mules,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“Why else would we be life and death brothers?” laughed Mo Nian.

Mo Nian had barely finished speaking when he suddenly unleashed an arrow containing the power he had been accumulating this entire time. An arrow streaked through the air at Feng Fei because she had also just moved.
