Chapter 2175 Conspiracy

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were all looking expectantly at Long Chen. Yue Zifeng was also standing with them quietly, an icy killing intent in his eyes.

Yue Zifeng had spent half a month recuperating in the Beitang family. Learning that he had been unconscious while so many things happened had ashamed him, and now that they were moving out, he was planning on getting his vengeance.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Cloud, and Liu Ruyan were also present. The Dragonblood warriors were like a sharp blade ready to launch its attack

“Guo Ran is correct. This time, we’re not just getting vengeance. We’re fighting over the qi flow of the continent that will increase our power. We all know just how many enemies we have, so when we occupy our qi flow stream, remember this: anyone who competes with us is our mortal enemy. We cannot have the slightest mercy on them. There is no need for any compassion for them,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, it doesn’t matter if they are our enemies or just plain idiots, if they want us dead, we’ll kill them!” declared Guo Ran.

Long Chen nodded and turned to Que Yuzhu. She was leading ten thousand of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s top geniuses.

Que Yuzhu had brought them all out. She was betting the future of her race on Long Chen and on this qi flow eruption.

“Race leader, there might be a bit too many enemies when the time comes. Don’t get angered by them. We don’t want to mess up,” warned Long Chen.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had been hunted down by the Xuan Beasts for many years now, and many of their experts had died. So they could not lose control when they saw those Xuan Beasts.

“We will follow the lead of the Dragonblood Legion. None of the disciples of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race will act out,” said Que Yuzhu.

“Good. Then let’s move out. We’ll make sure the entire Martial Heaven Continent remembers us.”

Long Chen waved his hand, and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows transformed into their true bodies and flew out.

Cloud let out a bird cry, flying at the front with Long Chen, Meng Qi, and the others standing on her back. They majestically flew out of their territory, going straight toward the Yin Yang World.

“Heavens, Long Chen has come out!”

Countless sects and experts were startled by this display. They stared in shock at their procession.

“What are they doing? Are they looking for vengeance?” Long Chen had been silent for a long time even in the face of all the rumors flying around. The Pill Fairy and Kun Pengzi’s power had made Long Chen’s reputation shrink.

“The Dragonblood Legion didn’t disband. That rumor was nonsense,” said one person upon seeing the Dragonblood Legion still in peak condition.

“Hmph, so what? They have long since stopped being unrivaled, and Long Chen is now just a second-rate character. With so many enemies, who knows who will kill him? He’s a fool for coming out!” shouted another person.

A golden flash of light appeared, going right past that person’s ear and destroying it. Guo Ran’s voice rang out from the sky. “Someone like you dares to criticize my boss? Keep talking and I’ll sew your mouth shut. Brainless jealousy is really annoying to listen to.”

That person was pale. The attack had come before he could even tell what was happening. If Guo Ran had wanted to kill him, not even a hundred lives would be enough to survive.

The surrounding experts jumped. The person talking was an Empyrean. Guo Ran had been flying over and managed to unleash such an accurate and controlled attack. This feat was even more difficult than a large-area killing blow.

“No, think about it! They’re probably looking for the qi flow eruption!” Someone suddenly let out a startled cry. The spiritual qi in the air was now so dense that it was no different than having a spirit gathering formation active. People were saying that the qi flow eruption would most likely be in the next few days.

“Let’s follow them.” Some of the more brazen ones began to fly in that direction. But Long Chen’s group was flying so fast that these people had long since lost sight of them.

Flying through the clouds, Long Chen felt the entire Martial Heaven Continent starting to shake. A surge in power appeared.

“The qi flow eruption is coming! Cloud, speed up!” shouted Long Chen.

Cloud responded. All her feathers lit up, and she shot away like a shooting star.

The other Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows sped up as well, following. Even the Kunpeng race amongst the Xuan Beasts would have to take second place to them when it came to speed.

They quickly arrived at the entrance to the Yin Yang World. However, the region looked different from when Long Chen had arrived. The entrance could not be seen.

“Are we lost?” Long Chen was the first to sense something wrong.

“Hmph, a little Spirit Void Illusion Formation thinks it can stop the Dragonblood Legion? Break!” Xia Chen suddenly threw out a formation disc. A golden rune lit up like a blazing sun on it, twisting the air around it like it was water. Runic chains began to appear in the sky.

“Explode!”

The formation disc exploded, emitting a burst of golden light that fell on those runic chains. The runic chains also exploded as the golden light enveloped them.

The illusion before them vanished, and they sped off once more.

Xia Chen began to throw more formation discs out, destroying more and more chains. Long Chen had not expected Pill Valley to have set up so many formations to hinder them from advancing.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. Now he realized why that sneak attack had occurred suddenly. Most likely, Pill Valley had noticed that he had come here previously and wanted to kill him to keep him quiet.

The layers of restrictions blocking them made Long Chen smell a conspiracy. Such formations could only possibly delay them, not stop them. There were many questionable aspects about such a thing.

“Yu Xiaoyun, I can’t be bothered to play chess with you. Instead, I’ll flip the chessboard and we can play a different game,” sneered Long Chen. Who cared about a scheme? He would crush it with absolute power.

The Dragonblood Legion continued to break through the formations. Finally, the entrance to the Yin Yang World was revealed. The entrance was still covered in mist, with a giant seal blocking the entrance.

“The Sovereign seal!”

The Sovereign seal was still emitting a boundless pressure. Even the Dragonblood warriors were filled with humility and respect for this Sovereign seal.

Long Chen looked at the Sovereign seal quietly. He had previously seen Sovereign Mo Li within the seal, but now the seal looked weaker. The constant attacks of the Blood race on the other side had taken their toll.

However, a Sovereign was still a Sovereign. This seal had lasted for over a hundred thousand years. They were truly an existence unmatched throughout history.

Suddenly, the earth began to shake, and the ground split open, two giant perpendicular scars spreading past the horizon.

Long Chen and the others hastily retreated in the face of it, but then a rainbow beam of light shot out of the sky.

Within this beam of light, Meng Qi and the others sensed the blessings of heaven and earth.

“This is the qi flow eruption!” shouted Guo Ran.

Following the first beam, more beams began to break out of the earth, soaring into the sky. There were actually tens of thousands of them.

The beams were all different sizes and spread randomly throughout this region. In the distance, there was one particularly wide beam filled with power.

“We’re occupying that beam!” Long Chen shouted and brought his group inside it.

Within the light beam, all the Dragonblood warriors and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows felt their astral spaces automatically absorb energy and start growing.

“Heavens!”

Their astral spaces rapidly expanded, indicating that they would have even more world energy in the future. They felt their blood being purified, and their souls being cleansed.

This qi flow eruption contained the blessing of the world, and this beam contained the strongest blessing of them all.

Long Chen didn’t care if others grew jealous. Today, he would be occupying this largest stream.

“Long Chen, you traitor of the Martial Heaven Continent, you actually led the qi flow eruption here to destroy the Sovereign seal?! Why are you trying to allow the Blood race to invade the continent?!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Just a moment after they had entered their qi flow stream, other experts arrived. Pill Valley’s Yu Xiaoyun had led a large group of Pill Valley’s experts and immediately shouted at Long Chen upon seeing the scene.
