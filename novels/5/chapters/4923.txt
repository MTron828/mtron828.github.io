Chapter 4912: A Glimmer of Hope

The violet-gold seal’s light radiated throughout the heavens and covered the devil corpse, seemingly sealing it with some kind of power. It was only quivering slightly, unable to move.

Long Chen and Mo Nian were delighted to see this. However, when they rushed over and saw Xing Wujiang’s situation, their hearts sank.

Gao Jianli, Cao Guofeng, as well as the masters of the Yellow Spring Pavilion and Heaven Heart Hall were standing around him. Between them were the experts of the Flame Divine Hall, including the vice hall master.

They had surrounded Xing Wujiang but were in no rush to make a move. They calmly watched Xing Wujiang fight the devil corpse, clearly waiting for their opportunity.

At this moment, Xing Wujiang formed hand seals, and a translucent dragon-shaped rune flowed around him, giving him endless power. In this state, his aura caused the world to shake.

“It’s a heaven vein’s dragon qi!” Mo Nian cried out. He finally saw what a true heaven vein’s dragon qi was. When this dragon qi swirled around Xing Wujiang, the power of heaven and earth seemed to bow to him. He looked like the emperor of heaven and earth.

Now, he was no longer a simple Heaven Saint; his aura completely exceeded that realm. Even the auras of the leaders of the four factions paled in comparison.

Long Chen and Mo Nian’s arrival caused quite a disturbance as weapons turned toward them. There were countless factions gathered here, all led by the Flame Divine Hall. The assembly comprised hundreds of Heaven Saints, with Earth Saints and Mortal Saints too numerous to tally. Instantly, they went on high alert, their killing intent flaring upon sighting Mo Nian and Long Chen.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It looks like the two of us are going to start a slaughter today,” remarked Long Chen, his eyes also raging with killing intent.

“We’ll kill them until their blood forms a river,” added Mo Nian, gnashing his teeth.

They could discern the intentions of these treacherous people. They only surrounded Xing Wujiang, not attacking him. Their strategy was clear: they aimed to deplete his precious energy until he reached a weakened state, at which point they would deliver a fatal blow.

What incensed Long Chen and Mo Nian the most was that amongst these countless experts, the majority of them were humans—the mortal enemies of the devil race. Xing Wujiang was binding the devil corpse to prevent it from inflicting a calamity upon the human race. However, these people didn’t help him, instead thinking of how to kill him.

The most unacceptable thing was the presence of devil experts within the crowd. They had put aside their enmity to follow the Flame Divine Hall’s lead.

For humans to collaborate with the devil race to harm their own kind was a despicable betrayal in Long Chen’s eyes—an unforgivable act that he detested the most.

“Don’t come over here!”

Long Chen and Mo Nian suddenly received a transmission from Xing Wujiang.

“Big Brother Wujiang, I… I’m sorry. I’ve let you down,” replied Mo Nian. He simply lowered his head in shame, not able to meet his gaze.

Xing Wujiang responded, “Brother, what are you talking about? In truth, from the start, I didn’t have much confidence that you could stop it… because this is destiny, the ultimate battle between my Xing family and the devil race. The Xing family has slaughtered countless devils, so when our karmic luck starts to fade, this karma will naturally bear fruit. This is the workings of fate. You cannot blame yourselves. In any case, I’ve long since been ready for this. Everything is within my calculations. I just need your help with one thing.”

“Big Brother Wujiang, just tell us. We will do everything we can to fulfill it,” said Mo Nian.

“The Square Heaven Seal has been fully infected. Although it’s acting like it’s helping me suppress the devil corpse, it’s actually merging with it. The Square Heaven Seal’s ambitions are even greater than I anticipated. After controlling this corpse, it’s going to start a slaughter, elevating the corpse’s power to strengthen itself. All it seeks is to restore itself to its strongest state.”

Long Chen and Mo Nian both gasped. The Square Heaven Seal actually wanted to take control of the devil corpse and refine it into its puppet? It had truly been bedeviled.

“The Square Heaven Seal has started to suspect me. Its power is spread in seven different places: the five branch seals, the main seal, and the devil head. Although it appears to be helping me suppress the devil corpse, in truth, it is injecting a portion of its power into the devil corpse. When all eight energy storages are evenly balanced, it will initiate the merger. That will be the optimal moment for me to destroy it. The window of opportunity will be very brief, but I must seize it. If I can time it right, the worst outcome will be the dissipation of my ancestral seal. My life will remain unharmed,” explained Xing Wujiang.

“Really?” Long Chen and Mo Nian were both delighted to hear that.

“It is because the Square Heaven Seal is also scheming against me. It wants to escape my control while paying the smallest price. That scheming is what created this single chance. However, I’ll need your help to grasp this opportunity. While I execute my plan, I need you to stop the vice hall master. But I should warn you, his power surpasses mine. If it weren’t for the Square Heaven Seal, I wouldn’t be a match for him,” said Xing Wujiang gravely.

“How long do we have to stall him?” asked Long Chen. That was the crucial point.

“I only need you two to stall him for the span of an incense stick burning,” replied Xing Wujiang.

“An incense stick? Big Brother, don’t worry. I can deal with him myself. But to be safe, I’ll join forces with Long Chen. We can’t afford to fail right now,” said Mo Nian.

Hearing that they only needed to stall for a bit, Mo Nian was confident. However, having failed once, he would not permit a second failure, so he would work together with Long Chen to make sure they succeeded.

“Big Brother, take care,” said Long Chen. After that, he consumed a medicinal pill to rapidly restore his dragon blood power. On the way here, he had recovered most of his dragon blood power. So his power was already close to its peak.

“I entrust this to you, my brothers,” remarked Xing Wujiang.

Long Chen and Mo Nian nodded. Just like that, they stood outside the encirclement. The bastards pointed their weapons at two of them but didn’t immediately attack, merely adopting a combat-ready stance.

At this moment, the vice hall master casually said, “It doesn’t matter what you’re plotting. It’s all meaningless. You will understand soon enough.”

Long Chen ignored him, focusing instead on recovering his dragon blood power as quickly as possible.

On the other hand, Mo Nian still had plenty of energy, so he was in charge of taunting them. “How is Huo Qianwu doing? Ask her how she is in my place. Also, to tell the truth, once she was stripped of her clothes, her body really… wasn’t very good.”

“You…!”

Mo Nian’s words instantly enraged everyone from the Flame Divine Hall.
