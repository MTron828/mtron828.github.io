Chapter 4783 Earth Saint Going All-Out

This sudden change caught everyone except the Dragonblood warriors off guard. After all, none of them were affected by this Earth Saint’s pressure, so they refused to believe that their boss would be affected.

When Long Chen looked lost, Guo Ran and the others almost laughed. Their boss was unrivaled in power, but it seemed that his acting skills needed some work; it didn’t look natural at all. Guo Ran was far ahead of Long Chen in this regard.

When they saw Long Chen put on this kind of expression, they knew that Long Chen was up to no good. As expected, Long Chen’s slap landed solidly on his target.

Only someone as overconfident as this trashy Earth Saint would fall for this. He had utmost confidence in his technique, believing that no one could resist it.

In truth, while the Earth Saint was completely enraged by Long Chen, he didn’t want to kill him because killing Long Chen would be letting him off too easily. He wanted to torment Long Chen to death bit by bit to release the fury inside of him.

That was why his attack wasn’t aimed at Long Chen’s head but at his heart. He was planning on ripping out Long Chen’s heart.

He was so immersed in the delightful thought of crushing Long Chen’s heart that he didn’t even see how Long Chen moved and slapped him in the face.

“Was that... the third slap in the face?”

A Sage King in the crowd counted on his fingers with an odd expression. The incredibly tense and nerve-wracking battle had come down to this.

“The fourth move.”

After sending him flying, Long Chen was still relaxed enough to keep counting. With a swift step, Long Chen appeared right in front of the Earth Saint. Still reeling from the previous slap, the Earth Saint had yet to regain his bearings when Long Chen's foot descended toward his groin.

Undoubtedly, this Earth Saint was an experienced fighter. Despite his head buzzing, he instinctively crossed his arms in defense, safeguarding his chance of having descendants.

However, Long Chen’s attack was just a feint. Suddenly, the Earth Saint felt a tight feeling on his scalp. Just as he bent over, Long Chen grabbed his hair.

The way the Earth Saint crossed his arms was like sending his hair into Long Chen’s hold, looking incredibly smooth and natural. Long Chen then grabbed his hair and slammed his knee forward.

Those familiar with Long Chen immediately turned away and closed their eyes, wincing. This was an extremely familiar technique for them, and they knew what kind of sound was about to appear. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

As Long Chen’s knee slammed into the Earth Saint’s face, the sound of bones breaking made everyone wince.

Crack!

Blood sprayed into the air as the Earth Saint's face crumpled under the force of the blow, mingling with flying mucus. A collective shiver ran through the onlookers, their own noses tingling at the sight.

The numerous experts here had seen countless marvelous and refined techniques. However, this kind of fighting move from the mortal world was new to them. Seeing the state of the Earth Saint after this one blow, they could tell that it was incredibly painful.

“The fifth move.”

BANG!

“The sixth move.”

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t stand on courtesy, unleashing the full power of his dragon blood to strike the Earth Saint’s head.

“The seventh-”

Just as Long Chen was about to slam his knee forward again, he found his hand empty. Without realizing it, Long Chen had crushed the Earth Saint’s head, and there was only white hair left in his hands.

Even an Earth Saint could not endure Long Chen’s power. Typically, it was exceedingly difficult to inflict physical harm upon an Earth Saint due to their resilience. However, Long Chen's arsenal extended beyond mere physical strength. The dragon blood coursing through his veins, inherited from the Sovereign clan, possessed the power of laws and immense destructive power to any expert, a fact that Long Chen was unaware of.

Long Chen’s seventh attack missed. Though the Earth Saint had lost his head, he hadn’t died. Summoning a sword into his grasp, he let out a primal roar, which came from deep within his abdomen. It was rather bizarre, but it contained endless killing intent.

“Earth Dao, Thousand Mountain Death Slash!”

As his sword blazed with light, a mountain range appeared in the air. They looked real yet also illusory as they were absorbed by the sword.

“He’s finally using the Earth Dao!”

“To be able to force an Earth Saint to this extent, even if Long Chen loses, his name will resound throughout the world.”

These speakers were all experienced experts, and they were aware of what this attack signified.

An Earth Saint was in control of the Earth Dao, but they would not use this power lightly. After all, it was a double-sided sword. It could easily injure the user if they made a mistake.

Furthermore, a dao injury was something that harmed their very foundation. It could throw their lives in danger or prevent them from ever advancing again.

That was precisely why he had only been using the Mortal Dao against Long Chen. Supposedly, it was enough to deal with Long Chen, and the Earth Saint was also well-versed and comfortable with wielding this power, so there was minimal risk of it backfiring.

However, with his head destroyed, he no longer cared about all that.

The Earth Saint’s sword swiftly slashed down, causing Long Chen’s expression to change. With a flash, Long Chen dodged to the side, and a streak of divine light slashed right by him, its formidable astral wind leaving a trail of cuts on his cheek

BOOM!

The sword landed on the ground, cutting the earth in two and producing a giant ditch that stretched beyond the horizon.

Quite a few experts had been on that sword’s path, and all of them vanished. They didn’t even understand what was happening before they were killed.

Seeing this, countless experts were horrified. The only reason they survived was due to luck. If that sword had gone in their direction, they would have been the ones to die.

“What a terrifying attack!”

Guo Ran and the others were taken aback, witnessing firsthand the raw might of an Earth Saint. In a single devastating strike, millions perished, including Sage Kings and nine star Doyens. Even people as strong as them had no ability to resist.

“No, wait, an Earth Saint’s killing blow has to have a locking aspect! How can it be dodged?!”

“Can it be that even an Earth Saint and a Saint weapon are unable to lock Long Chen down?” Bewildered guesses rang out. If this was true, then Long Chen was truly terrifying.

“Alright, that’ll count as one move. Then there are still three moves left,” said Long Chen. When he looked at that sword and the headless Earth Saint, his fighting spirit burned.

“Die!”

The Earth Saint’s sword slashed toward Long Chen again. This time, an unending mountain range appeared in the void, and the sword’s might was even greater than before.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!” Long Chen's voice thundered within his mind. In an instant, the world around him dimmed, the once sunny sky now cloaked in a river of twinkling stars. A vast sea of stars appeared behind Long Chen, while specks of starlight converged upon him. His very presence pulsed with an overwhelming aura, suffocating all who dared to stand before him.

When Long Chen summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor, he suddenly felt an unprecedented feeling. There was no need for him to call out the stars, and they were already blessing him with their power. Astral energy was flowing into him endlessly.

As an unprecedented strength filled Long Chen, his confidence surged as well. This time, it felt like the stars were part of himself, as he was an invincible battle god.

The Earth Saint’s sword descended with an aura of supreme divine might. Stars flickered on Long Chen’s fist as he swung it toward the sword.

“What?!”

“He’s going to block an Earth Saint’s attack barehanded?!”

Startled cries rang out.
