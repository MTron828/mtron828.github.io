Chapter 4677 Beyond Expectations

A dragon roar resounded throughout heaven and earth, forming a visible wave of destruction that spread in every direction.

Long Chen was the first to be struck. Thankfully, he had covered his ears and sealed his other senses because he knew just how terrifying this move was.

After that, the wave struck the other experts, and most of them couldn’t react in time.

For them, the Sovereign clan expert was just a piece of fat meat. As a result, when the soundwave reached them, their heads exploded and their headless corpses fell from the sky just like that.

As Luo Changsheng, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yu Zihao, and the others stood at the very front, they reacted swiftly upon witnessing the Sovereign clan expert’s menacing roar. However, those behind them who failed to react in time were instantly struck down, and the sight of their demise sent shockwaves of horror rippling through the remaining experts.

After all, they were all nine-star Heavenly Doyens, monsters amongst monsters, geniuses amongst geniuses. However, even with all their power, over ten of them were still instantly slain. How absurd was this?

The rest of them quickly reacted, summoning their defenses. However, they were still sent flying wretchedly, with blood spraying out of their mouths. The soundwave was not so easy to defend as many divine items couldn’t do anything against it.

Some experts were clenching their heads, screaming in pain. It was horrifying to see people’s eyes pop out of their heads and their heads on the verge of exploding.

This single dragon roar indeed shook heaven and earth. Aside from its destructive power, its supreme divine might also directly stabbed people’s souls.

“What arrogant ants you all are!”

The Sovereign clan expert’s angry shout echoed throughout heaven and earth. In his lifetime, he had been a formidable figure, an indomitable presence even within the Sovereign clan.

To be viewed as a piece of meat by a group of kids was a grave insult to his legacy. Even though he was only a discarnate spirit now, he refused to tolerate such blasphemy.

“He is weakening! Look, he looks somewhat translucent now! Don’t be afraid! Grind him down!” shouted Luo Changsheng.

Luo Changsheng was correct. After that one dragon roar, the Sovereign clan expert’s body faded slightly. Most importantly, the runes swirling around him had also lessened, and his aura was weakening.

Even so, all of these experts were too terrified to advance, their courage broken by that roar. Even when they knew he had weakened, they didn’t dare to make any rash moves.

After all, a dying camel was still bigger than a horse. If they enraged him, he would drag a bunch of them down with him.

A discarnate spirit had nothing to lose, but they had to throw their lives away against a discarnate spirit. Hence, none of them was willing to charge forward first.

Seeing that no one dared to go with him, Luo Changsheng shouted, “Don’t worry, we’ll join forces and focus on defense! Don’t get picked off one by one, and we’ll easily exhaust him.”

After saying that, Luo Changsheng was the first to stand at the very front, and the others gathered around him.

Although they knew that Luo Changsheng couldn’t possibly have good intentions, if he wanted to take the brunt of the attacks, they were willing to join forces with him. At least, that would be better than being picked off one by one. Although they were all monsters in their own right, not many of them could withstand a single attack from the Sovereign clan expert.

Seeing their collaboration, the Sovereign clan expert just scoffed. These idiots refused to give up, still viewing him as meat, which enraged him. He was about to shout when his expression suddenly changed, and he gazed behind these idiots.

At some point, a hole had appeared in the nine heavens, and a figure slowly descended from it. This figure then appeared behind Luo Changsheng and the others.

Long Chen couldn’t help but feel a jolt of fear, despite having mentally braced himself for its presence. Its appearance was both expected and unexpected, signifying that the Sovereign clan expert was not his final challenge.

Likewise, the Sovereign clan expert was also filled with disbelief. He had thought that he had taken control over the entire heavenly tribulation, but the appearance of this figure proved that he had only taken control over a portion of it.

“Everyone, take care! Enter your strongest defensive stat—” Luo Changsheng was loudly shouting, but when he saw Long Chen and the Sovereign clan expert’s grim expressions, he slowly turned around. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

All of a sudden, these idiots sensed something wrong. Despite knowing that their attention had to be on the Sovereign clan expert, their spiritual perception was screaming at them that the greatest danger lay behind them.

“Who are you?”

When they turned around, they saw a man with seven stars revolving behind him standing there. When they looked at him, the world slowly lit up. The light of the stars covered this land in a haze of murderous air.

This man had a pair of eyes so deep that no one could perceive how deep they were. His eyes were like windows in the starry sky, with seven flickering bright stars in them. When they looked at his eyes, they seemed to be able to see the end of their lives.

They had not expected someone else to suddenly appear here. However, when they asked about his identity, he simply ignored him, his gaze penetrating straight through them, locking onto Long Chen.

He fixed his gaze solely on Long Chen and started to walk straight toward him.

Seeing him approaching, the Sovereign clan expert turned to look at the heavens. He suddenly mocked himself, “How embarrassing!”

“I’m also a bit embarrassed. It was too early to celebrate.” Long Chen also smiled bitterly.

He had thought that he could simply end this tribulation by beating the Sovereign clan expert, and that it would be one of his easier tribulations. But now, he realized that he had underestimated the Heavenly Daos yet again. After all, even if he couldn’t beat the Sovereign clan expert, the latter wouldn’t kill him. How could the heavens allow Long Chen to slip away so easily? Ironically, the heavens were hell-bent on killing him.

This man didn’t even look at the idiots in the tribulation, treating them as nothing but empty air. They were angered, not knowing what this person was doing.

However, certain idiots seemed somewhat afraid to see him. They were Yu Zihao and Fallen Daynight’s disciple.

Luo Changsheng and Yin Jiushang’s expressions also changed to see this man. They were shocked, clearly recognizing this person’s status.

“Are you mute?”

Someone finally roared and swung his halberd at the indifferent man, using one of his killer moves against him.
