Chapter 4525 Blonde Feng You

Buzz.

As flames raged on top of the spear, a phoenix cry resounded throughout the sky. This spear seemed to be on the verge of igniting heaven and earth.

“This time, I’ll make sure to kill you!”

Hearing this, the red-haired man smiled sinisterly and blocked the attack with his scythe.

BOOM!

The moment these two divine weapons clashed, the world was illuminated by a beautiful blood-colored divine light.

Long Chen finally saw the master of this spear. It was a robust yet slender woman with sharply defined cheeks. Her eyes were profound, resembling a cold forest, emanating an air of aloof arrogance.

Tall and standing half a head above Long Chen, she possessed a large and muscular physique, yet her proportions were remarkably beautiful. Her shoulders were broader than the average woman's, and her arms, though powerful, retained a slender grace.

Thick, blonde hair was gathered into a ponytail, with a few loose strands adding a wild touch to her appearance.

She was also a powerful Doyen. Based on her aura, she was on par with this red-haired man. However, when their divine weapons clashed, she grunted and fell back a few steps. There was a twinge of shock in her eyes.

“Today is the day of your mixed beast race’s destruction. Face your death!” declared the red-haired man with laughter. That blood-colored divine light once more appeared on his scythe’s edge, and he swung it toward her, leaving her with no room to breathe. His movements were lightning-quick.

“As expected, the scythe poses a real threat.” Long Chen had never witnessed such speed before. It was as if the red-haired man had sliced through spacetime, granting no time for anyone to react.

This woman didn’t have time to raise her spear for a block, but a golden shield bearing a phoenix mark materialized in her left hand, forcefully intercepting the scythe.

The impact reverberated across the entire battlefield, causing it to sink. At the same time, a vortex unfurled, sending countless experts flying, some meeting their demise directly.

The red-haired man gripped his scythe with both hands, unleashing a surge of Blood Qi. An enormous figure appeared behind him.

The enormous figure was the Corrupt God himself, wielding a scythe identical to the one held by the red-haired man. As the red-haired man swung his scythe downward, the figure of the Corrupt God mirrored the action.

This attack sent shockwaves through the world, infusing it with the divine power of a god. In the face of this overwhelming force, even Long Chen sensed his soul quivering.

In response, a resplendent phoenix cry rang out, accompanied by a red flame. After that, a pair of red wings materialized behind the blonde woman’s back, making her look like the flame reincarnation of a phoenix.

BOOM!

Divine light flowed out of her shield, bringing life to the phoenix mark. With it, she forcibly blocked that attack.

Two divine weapons clashed again, causing the void to collapse and countless cracks to spread in every direction. The world looked like it was about to shatter.

“Ah, I want to fight too!”

Long Chen sensed his blood heating up, his own battle will surging within him. The power emanating from the clash shook him, and he found himself unable to suppress his own fighting spirit.

Long Chen was also a battle addict inside. Both of his fights with Ying Tian had ended with the latter slinking away like a mudfish. In the end, he was unable to bring out any of his true power, which left him with a terrible feeling. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

On the other hand, the red-haired man and the blonde woman were different. Their fighting styles revolved around direct clashes of power, precisely what Long Chen craved.

The blonde woman was sent tumbling back again, leaving a long ditch in the ground as she struggled to regain her footing. In a full-power clash, she was at a disadvantage.

“Hahaha, I was right, wasn’t I? Your mixed beast race will be destroyed this time. Do you still doubt me?” sneered the red-haired man.

Hearing that, Long Chen felt the urge to slap him. Was he an idiot? From the start, this woman hadn’t said anything. Was talking to himself really so interesting?

“You’re just relying on your inheritance. So what? Do you think that I, Feng You, am afraid of you, a defeated general?” The blonde woman finally spoke.

“Hmph, victory and defeat are part of life. The one laughing at the end is the ultimate victor! But you won’t be laughing in your grave!” the red-haired man sneered and stepped through the void, followed by the Corrupt God’s figure. His scythe once more slashed toward her.

She raised her shield once more and blocked. However, every single one of the red-haired man’s attacks contained the Corrupt God’s power, so it forced her back repeatedly.

The red-haired man’s assaults were relentless, delivered in rapid succession without giving her any chance to breathe, let alone counterattack. His intent was clear—to defeat her through the simplest and most brutal means.

Each of his strikes ruptured the void, unleashing surging waves of qi. It was a power that not even Saints would dare to block.

The mixed beast race’s Saints wanted to save her but couldn’t even approach their battlefield. To complicate matters, the Saints from the Heavenly Corrupt Sect had also joined the fray.

Gritting her teeth, the blonde woman seethed with resentment. In the previous two fights between them, she had been the winner. However, now that the red-haired man wielded this mysterious scythe, he was overwhelming her.

She could only defend now, unable to even bring out her true power. If she wanted to counterattack, she would need an opportunity.

If someone could intercept that scythe even just once, she would have a chance to recover, turning the tide of the battle.

However, right now, she could only grit her teeth and keep blocking. If this continued, she would run out of gas soon, as she was expanding more energy in defense. Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do.

“As I said, whoever laughs last is the ultimate victor. Do you want to counterattack? Even if I gave you that chance, it would be futile. I am far stronger than you now!” laughed the red-haired man. With an absolute advantage in this battle, his arrogance had grown even more pronounced. Yet, he showed no mercy, persisting in his unrelenting attacks and denying her any opportunity for a counterattack.

Clearly, after engaging in battle twice before, these two combatants had developed a profound understanding of each other. For experts of their caliber, once a weakness was identified, they would exploit it relentlessly until the opposing party succumbed.

Continuing his unrelenting assault, the red-haired man relentlessly pushed the blonde woman further and further back. Simultaneously, the mixed beast race’s army found themselves steadily retreating. They were starting to panic. They wanted to save her, but they couldn’t even approach that battlefield.

The Saints and top geniuses of the mixed beast race, who possessed the ability to get close, found themselves under relentless attack from their enemies. As a result, the battle lines were continuously being pushed backward.

After enduring a series of ferocious attacks, the blonde woman finally coughed up a mouthful of blood. The red-haired man sent her shield flying and turned her hand into a bloody pulp.

“It’s over!” the red-haired man sneered sinisterly, and his scythe swung toward her again.

“No!”

Horrified screams came from the mixed beast race’s experts. The Sage King of their race also returned, but some kind of divine light bound him.

“Keep dreaming!” The sect master’s sinister laughter rang out. In their perspective, the battle would essentially be over once this woman was defeated.

Am I going to die just like this?

The blonde woman watched as the scythe got closer, her eyes brimming with hatred and resentment. However, another object appeared in her field of vision, rapidly expanding. It was a bronze cauldron.

BANG!

With an explosive sound, the scythe solidly struck that bronze cauldron.

“Ah! My scythe!”

A mournful wail rang out.
