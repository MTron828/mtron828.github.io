Chapter 4441 New Manifestation

BOOM!

A bolt of black lightning shot right past Long Chen’s face, missing Long Chen’s right ear by a bit.

It then pierced through the void and didn’t scatter, leaving behind a line of black light with the thickness of Netherdragon Tianzhao’s finger. It had shot out of his fingertip and extended beyond the horizon.

Looking at that black line, the onlookers jumped in shock. This attack came way too fast and too sudden for them to react properly.

Everyone’s expression changed, especially those budding Doyens. If this attack had been used on them, they’d have been dead.

However, it seemed that Netherdragon Tianzhao’s accuracy was a bit off as this attack didn’t strike Long Chen’s head, instead going right past his ear.

On the other hand, Long Chen didn’t move at all. When that black light shot right past him, the wind it carried blew back his clothes and hair, but his eyes were calm. In fact, he didn’t even blink.

Seeing this scene, most people here were stunned. Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao had yet to reveal their true power, but the power of their domains alone was enough to show just how terrifying they were.

Given Long Chen's skill level, he should have been able to sense Netherdragon Tianzhao's attack. He wouldn’t just stand still and not dodge.

Being able to dodge was one thing, but choosing not to dodge was an entirely different matter. Dodging was a natural instinct in the face of such a formidable attack, and deliberately refraining from it was just...

Thinking about this, the budding Doyens were scared out of their wits. Could it really be that Long Chen had seen through Netherdragon Tianzhao’s intentions and simply decided not to move?

“You intentionally missed to make me look like a miserable coward? The nether dragon race really is childish,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen displayed a calm exterior, but he was actually shocked. Originally, he had been planning on dodging. However, when the moment arrived, the dragon blood in him quivered, and he seemed to be able to guess Netherdragon Tianzhao’s actions. He directly knew Netherdragon Tianzhao’s intention and could guess the path of the attack.

It was an extremely mysterious feeling. When that black ray shot past Long Chen’s ear, he instantly understood.

His true dragon essence blood had awakened. As the supreme existence of the dragon race, the true dragons were the originators of all the dragon race’s divine abilities.

Since Long Chen’s dragon blood divine runes had awakened, he could instantly see through Netherdragon Tianzhao’s attack. This premonition seemed like an ability of his dragon blood runes.

It was truly mysterious. It was due to this feeling that he dared to be so arrogant, simply allowing this terrifying attack to fly by him without dodging.

Despite being prepared for it, the onlookers were still shocked by what Long Chen said.

For them, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s attack was unbelievably fast, practically impossible to dodge. However, Long Chen had seen through it the moment Netherdragon Tianzhao attacked. Such a feat not only required guts but also absolute confidence in one’s own perception.

After all, if Long Chen had predicted wrong and this attack pierced his head, he would be a corpse now.

“You’re the childish one. This was me giving you your last chance. Either swear loyalty to me… or die,” said Netherdragon Tianzhao coldly. Although Long Chen’s display had surprised him, he still had absolute confidence in himself.

Remembering his father’s words, he wanted to keep Long Chen alive because Long Chen’s secrets were even more important than his life.

Long Chen shook his head. “The nether dragon race really can’t be saved anymore. You should really worry about yourself!”

Suddenly, Long Chen’s seven-color divine ring appeared, resonating with a sacred dragon cry. Seven-color auspicious clouds then appeared in the divine ring, along with some golden dazzling dragon scales—a manifestation of his dragon might.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“With the awakening of the dragon blood divine runes, even the Dragon King Battle Armor’s manifestation has changed. Seven-color auspicious clouds have appeared on it!” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised by this change.

This was his first time seeing this kind of manifestation as well. Golden dragon scales were now moving within his divine ring, looking like the figure of a golden dragon.

However, the dragon was so big that even the enormous divine ring was not enough to contain it. In fact, within the divine ring, it was only possible to see one scale after another pass by.

When Long Chen summoned his dragon blood manifestation, a dragon blood rune appeared on every single one of his dragon scales. Following that, his bones creaked, and ripples of aura spread out of him.

When the ripples blew by, even budding Doyens felt a chill. On the other hand, when the nether dragon race leader and Netherdragon Tianzhao saw those ripples, their pupils suddenly contracted.

“Such a powerful sacred aura! An ordinary true dragon can’t possibly possess such a thing, so he is likely related to the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign! At the very least, he has the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign’s legacy! Tianzhao, you must capture him alive! He is a priceless treasure of our entire race!” When the nether dragon race leader sent a spiritual message to Netherdragon Tianzhao, his voice quivered with excitement.

After all, the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign was a supreme existence among all dragons. The only reason the bastard nether dragon race dared to betray their ancestors was because of the disappearance of such a prominent figure.

When the Dragon Sovereign disappeared, its legacy vanished with it, seemingly lost for all eternity. Despite the emergence of true dragon race experts over countless years, none appeared to inherit its profound legacy.

All dragons knew that the Dragon Sovereign was renowned for its sacred energy, so the one to inherit its legacy would possess a great amount of sacred energy as well. Hence, even though Long Chen possessed only a trace of true dragon blood, the sacred energy he just unleashed surpassed even that of the nether dragon race leader. This basically confirmed that there was a connection between Long Chen and the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign.

If they could obtain its legacy from Long Chen, their nether dragon race would definitely soar. Perhaps they could even call themselves the heir of the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign and could command the entire dragon race.

“Father, don’t worry. I know what to do,” responded Netherdragon Tianzhao as he eyed the sacred energy surging out of Long Chen, feeling a bit of envy.

If he had this sacred energy, he would be like a tiger with wings. He felt that it was a waste of a treasure in Long Chen’s hands.

“Are you prepared? I’m about to attack,” warned Netherdragon Tianzhao as his fighting spirit was burning.

After saying that, without waiting for a reply, he suddenly shot toward Long Chen.
