Chapter 5049 Once More Encountering Bai Yingxue

Seeing so many people attacking him, Long Chen sighed inside. There was just nothing he could do about his luck. Whether he was low-key or high-key, he always encountered idiots. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In front of two-vein Heaven Saints, especially ones from the Golden Crow race, Long Chen didn’t dare to hold back. After all, they were much stronger than the four divine clans’ two-vein Heaven Saints.

Long Chen took a deep breath. If he were to fight for real, he would have to kill them all quickly. He couldn’t leave a single one alive, or he would be exposed.

Just as he was about to summon the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, a milky white light fell, enveloping Long Chen. Seeing this, the Golden Crow race’s experts bounced back.

Both Long Chen and the Golden Crow race’s experts were startled. Looking up, they saw that at some point, a giant Ten Thousand Dragon Nest had appeared above them.

This Ten Thousand Dragon Nest emitted white divine light, appearing sacred and holy. Seeing the light protecting him, Long Chen was surprised. He hadn’t expected someone to save him at this time.

“White dragon race, what do you think you’re doing?!” roared one elder of the Golden Crow race.

White dragon race?

Now, Long Chen was even more taken aback. At this moment, a beautiful middle-aged woman walked out of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

She looked to be around forty years old but was still incredibly beautiful. On top of her beauty, she possessed a trace of maturity and wisdom that younger women didn’t possess. However, what shocked Long Chen was the immense divine pressure radiating from her. Although he couldn’t see through her cultivation base, he was sure that her power was far above that of the Long clan’s patriarch.

Back then, when Long Chen faced the patriarch’s attack, he owed his survival to the Earth Cauldron. Later, he asked the Earth Cauldron about his odds of victory against the patriarch if he was in his peak condition, and it told him not to wonder about it. He didn’t have the slightest chance. Against an expert of that caliber, the first thing to do was to run away as far as he could.

After all, the leap from a two-vein to a three-vein Heaven Saint wasn’t just about additional power but also a qualitative transformation. Before Long Chen advanced to the Eternal realm, he definitely could not fight such an expert, or he would purely be courting death.

On his journey, Long Chen had been thinking about whether or not he would encounter an expert on this level. Yet, even before reaching the Glacial Heaven Domain, he already encountered someone even more formidable than the Long clan patriarch.

Long Chen’s heart clenched, but when he noticed a group of young individuals emerging behind her, especially a young woman in white robes, Long Chen instantly relaxed. This young woman was none other than Bai Yingxue, the princess of the White Dragon race whom he had encountered in the dragon cemetery where he obtained the Sovereign scale.

Bai Yingxue winked at Long Chen when he turned toward her. After that, she acted like she didn’t recognize him. Clearly, this was arranged by her.

The moment the middle-aged woman walked out of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, the Golden Crow race’s experts lost all their arrogance and anger. They seemed terrified. Just like Long Chen, it seemed they hadn’t expected to encounter such a terrifying existence here.

“Senior, the Golden Crow race is handling a private matter. I hope Senior won’t interfere,” said one of the two-vein Heaven Saints as he bowed toward her.

At this time, these Golden Crow experts didn’t even dare to breathe loudly. Their tone was almost pleading as they spoke.

“Oh? A private matter? Then I’m curious to know what private matters could exist between my dragon race and your Golden Crow race,” the middle-aged woman replied, casting a glance from Long Chen to the members of the Golden Crow race.

“Dragon race? What do you mean?” The Golden Crow race’s experts stared at Long Chen in disbelief.

Long Chen instantly understood. It seemed that Bai Yingxue had asked this woman to support him. Since Long Chen possessed dragon blood, it made sense for her to intervene on his behalf.

However, Long Chen was surprised by Bai Yingxue's help, considering they had only met once. Moreover, he wasn’t truly a member of the dragon race; he merely had dragon blood coursing through his veins.

“What? Do you think I’ve made a mistake? Child, give them a demonstration,” the middle-aged woman instructed, looking at Long Chen.

Caught off guard, Long Chen felt like he was stuck in a quagmire. Was she asking him to reveal his Dragon Blood Battle Armor? Doing so would instantly expose his identity. At that moment, Bai Yingxue winked at him again, but he couldn't decipher her hint.

“Fool, didn’t you receive the white dragon’s blessing back then? They healed you, didn’t they? The Sovereign blood contains the same sacred energy, so you just need to concentrate that sacred energy and imitate the white dragon race’s aura. That isn’t difficult for you!” explained the Earth Cauldron, unable to keep watching Long Chen’s stupidity.

Only then did Long Chen recall that he had received the white dragon race’s blessing in their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. When they helped him heal, his body absorbed quite a bit of the white dragon race’s energy. However, after the Sovereign scale’s blood entered his body, all the other dragon blood power in him was either expelled or assimilated.

The white dragon race’s sacred energy had been assimilated. Thinking of that, he instantly understood. He confidently said, “Alright, you want to look? Sure... what is this?”

Long Chen raised a hand toward the Golden Crow experts. Flames swirled around this hand, creating a mesmerizing display.

However, when the Golden Crow experts stared at his hand, confusion and skepticism were evident on their faces.

“No matter how you look at it, it’s a human hand.”

“Don’t be in a rush. Look, my left hand is moving slowly, but my right hand...” Long Chen suddenly extended his right hand and casually swung it. White dragon scales that looked like jade appeared on top of it. Just like that, he slapped the elder’s face, sending him flying.

The Golden Crow experts were staring intently at his hands, never expecting him to suddenly give one of their elders such a ruthless slap.

Although Long Chen’s movements were light and he didn’t use his full power, that elder was not on guard. With his defenses down, half his face was turned into pulp, and he spat out blood.

Even the white dragon race’s experts were stunned by the suddenness and brutality of the slap.
