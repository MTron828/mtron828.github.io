Chapter 2921 Six Star Battle Armor

Although the figure was indistinct and it was impossible to tell its features, that aura was something carved into Long Chen’s bones and heart.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, in a fit of rage, he had activated his Purgatory Eyes, looking through space and time to see Lord Brahma.

That one look had caused the Martial Heaven Continent to be destroyed. If it weren’t for the dragon expert helping, Long Chen and everyone on the continent would have been wiped out.

The position of the one that Long Chen hated most in the world could only belong to Lord Brahma, and it wasn’t just from the will deep within his soul anymore. Now, this figure made him think of the Pill Fairy.

To protect him, the Pill Fairy had willingly become Pill Valley’s divine daughter. Pill Valley’s mission had been to overlook the Martial Heaven Continent and see if any nine star heirs appeared. When the Pill Fairy died in Long Chen’s embrace, Long Chen’s hatred of Lord Brahma reached a level that could not be described with words.

Now Long Chen was completely sure why he loathed Chu Kuang. Killing intent then exploded out of him, and his body was quivering.

Seeing him quiver, the experts outside were startled. Long Chen was actually so shaken by Chu Kuang’s aura that he was quivering. That could only mean that he was powerless to resist and about to be killed.

It wasn’t just the spectators who thought like that. Chu Kuang was of the same opinion.

“Kneel and face your death. That’s your only option.”

The divine energy flowing out of Chu Kuang was no longer a power that belonged to him. With a thought, life could be born. And with another thought, it could be extinguished.

This was also Chu Kuang’s first time using this power, but as he felt it coursing through his veins, while it also caused him great harm, it also gave him the feeling of absolute control, causing him to throw everything else to the back of his mind.

In fact, despite the constant damage to his body, he wasn’t in a rush to kill Long Chen. He wanted to torment Long Chen before taking his head. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You’re wrong. My choice is to kill you both!” Long Chen clenched his teeth, and flames almost burst out of his eyes.

“Six Star Battle Armor!” With an inward roar, the image of a six-point star appeared in his eyes. As for the starry river behind him, six stars lit up within it, and a wild aura erupted.

BOOM!

As Long Chen stamped on the air, space collapsed beneath his foot, and he shot toward Chu Kuang like a bolt of lightning, his fist hurtling toward him. An unrivaled will and an explosive killing intent twisted and turned.

This sudden eruption from Long Chen shocked everyone. The current Long Chen’s aura had also completely changed just like Chu Kuang’s.

While Long Chen had appeared calm and indifferent the entire time before, now his eyes were scarlet, and it was like he was a devil from hell. That killing intent gave people chills.

On the other hand, Chu Kuang sneered and divine light spread from his saber. He slashed it at Long Chen, and the result was a huge explosion that shook heaven and earth. Both of their figures vanished, replaced by a ball of light that rapidly spread until it suddenly exploded.

As a result, the grand formation of the plaza shattered, and everyone on the battlefield was blown back by their power. As for the experts surrounding the plaza, they instantly felt the aura of death envelop them. If those ripples reached them, it was unknown just how many of them would survive.

Fortunately, a large hand suddenly descended, and the hole that had been made by their power was blocked by this hand.

It was the head of the Immortal Institute who had done it. The hand transformed into millions of chains that wrapped around the formation, strengthening it.

Seeing this, the other experts were at ease. Despite there being a formation, Long Chen and Chu Kuang’s power was too great. Even though they were not within the same space, they had a feeling that those ripples would spell out death for them if struck.

Now that they thought about it, considering that they were in separate spaces, their fear was rather embarrassing. However, when they saw the other disciples that sat closer to the barrier starting to flee, they smiled and felt better.

Within the battlefield, the two auras continued to clash fiercely, and runes were raging in the air. It was a shocking sight.

“Is this really a battle between Mortal Transcendence disciples? Why does it feel like even Four Peak experts would be killed if they entered?” exclaimed an Elder with disbelief.

Other Four Peak experts also nodded. These auras were truly terrifying. Chu Kuang had some terrifying existence’s aura, while Long Chen was no inferior. What Long Chen was fighting right now wasn’t Chu Kuang but that mysterious existence behind him.

Eventually, the runes cleared up a bit, allowing them to see Long Chen and Chu Kuang again. Long Chen’s fist was smashing into Chu Kuang’s saber, and ripples were spreading from between the fist and saber.

Those tiny ripples made the air rumble like thunder. No one wanted to imagine what would happen if they were struck by those ripples.

“Long Chen, you aren’t a match for me. Do you know who my god is? It is a supreme venerate, someone whose name shakes the nine heavens and ten lands. You think you can fight against me?!” sneered Chu Kuang. The manifestation behind him ignited, and more and more divine energy poured into him, causing his aura to rapidly rise.

“Who does he think he is? I will sooner or later cut off his head and use it as a stool. I’ll show you just who is the strongest.”

Long Chen suddenly roared. The six stars behind him formed two triangles and began to spin contrary to each other. At the same time, the 108,000 stars in his body ignited, every single one of them pouring energy into him.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s power exploded, and Chu Kuang was sent flying by his fist.

“How can this be?!” Chu Kuang was shocked, unable to believe his eyes.

Just at that moment, Long Chen’s second fist smashed into him. Heaven and earth shook from this one fist.

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!

Long Chen unleashed three punches, forcing Chu Kuang back three times. With every collision, a huge explosion shook the battlefield, and Long Chen’s punches grew stronger and stronger.

“Heavens, have I gone crazy? Both their auras are still rising so crazily!” People were shocked to find that as they thought, their power only grew. There was no end to their strength.

“Break!”

Long Chen suddenly roared. Followed by his roar, Chu Kuang’s blood-colored saber was shattered by his punch.

This bloodline Spirit item was actually unable to continue blocking Long Chen’s fists. With it gone, Long Chen’s foot smashed into Chu Kuang’s chest.

BANG!

Chu Kuang’s body armor also exploded. With one fist and one foot, Chu Kuang’s two Spirit items were destroyed. Furthermore, at that moment, the manifestation behind him quivered.

Chu Kuang’s expression changed as his power had reached its limit. This was not his power, and if the fight dragged on, his battle prowess would start dropping.

“I’ll kill you with one move!”

Having lost his blade and armor, Chu Kuang didn’t retreat. Instead, his right arm shook, and the sleeve there exploded. At some point, layers of runes had appeared on his arm until it looked like it was made of steel.

Suddenly, the manifestation behind him vanished, and four specks of light covered his fists. There was also a faint figure within those lights.

“Brahma Four Divine Beast Punch!”

Chu Kuang concentrated all of his power on a single attack. This was the strongest attack of his life, and life or death would be decided here.
