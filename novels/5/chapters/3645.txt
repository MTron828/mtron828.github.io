Chapter 3634 Heaven Shattering Attack

Heaven and earth collapsed, and the ten thousand Daos crumbled. The staff swung through the air with black qi surging around it. As for the Minghong Saber, it was covered in specks of starlight. Both divine weapons contained the full power of both wielders.

Moreover, the two of them didn’t hold back in the slightest. This was not just a clash of power but also a clash of wills. At this moment, neither of them could hesitate or feel afraid. Otherwise, the slightest opening in their mental states would cause their wills to instantly collapse, leading to defeat.

One was a supreme heavenly genius of the devil race, and the other was a peak expert of the human race. Both of them possessed undefeatable wills. But in this exchange, only one could live.

Time seemed to move slowly. The people in the Magnificent Heaven City clenched their teeth and their fists, watching as the staff and saber slowly smashed into each other. This was not just the attack that would decide life and death for Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye. It would also decide whether the human race could survive in the Alldevil Star-Field. Hence, everyone’s heart rose into their throat.

BOOM!

The Minghong Saber slashed at the staff with the will of Split the Heavens. Both of their powers erupted.

The moment the two weapons touched, a sphere of light erupted between them. It started off only the size of a fist, but then instantly grew to encompass all of heaven and earth. It was like a sun exploding.

Suddenly, the world turned silent as if it had lost all sound. Time seemed to come to a sudden stop, and people felt like they were floating within the void. Following that, intense quakes made them feel like the world had been flipped. They then saw a rain of light.

The light was chaotic, creating random currents within the void. It was as if the world was rolling, that the ten thousand Daos were being overturned.

At this moment, the Magnificent Heaven City rumbled and its barriers were constantly exploding. Cracks appeared throughout the city. Fortunately, with the defenses pushed to the very max thanks to Guo Ran’s order, they weren’t instantly wiped out.

“Not good! The dragon veins have been destroyed!” A panicked cry rang out.

The formation’s defenses were built on top of the dragon veins. With the dragon veins destroyed, the formation also lost its power.

“Defensive battleships, get into formation! Protect the commoners!” Guo Ran quickly reacted.

BOOM!Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, the Magnificent Heaven City that had lost the support of the dragon veins exploded. Fortunately, just as it exploded, the battleships unleashed protective light, just barely covering up the commoners in time.

Astral winds raged. The blinding light slowly faded, and by the time people’s vision was restored, they could no longer recognize the world.

This place was now a wasteland. At the center of the battlefield was an enormous spatial crack. It simply sat there, neither devouring nor spitting anything. It was like a simple cut left in heaven and earth. The laws of the Heavenly Daos could not heal that scar.

“Don’t stop the protective formation!”

The runes of the battleships began to waver, causing Guo Ran to suddenly shout. “Maintain the formation! Otherwise, the remnant killing intent will instantly wipe out the majority of the people in the city.”

Guo Ran’s words caused countless hearts to shake, especially the people who had thought that the battle was over and were thinking of saving some resources by bringing down the defensive state of the barrier. They were so terrified by Guo Ran’s words that they didn’t even dare to move.

The vision formation was quickly activated. After that, they found a figure within that spatial crack.

“It’s boss Long Chen! We won, we won, we won!”

When they saw that figure, people wept out of joy. Long Chen hadn’t disappointed them.

“I already told you that boss is unrivaled within the same realm!” said Guo Ran proudly.

In truth, Guo Ran had also been scared just now. Alldevil Tianye was absolutely terrifying, and that Supreme Bone was a heaven-defying existence. It was his first time feeling like Long Chen could lose to someone in the same realm.

However, Long Chen hadn’t disappointed him. The Alldevil Star-Field’s commoners were crazily chanting Long Chen’s name. Their gratitude toward him had reached a level that could not be expressed with words.

Lives were precious, but many people didn’t understand just how precious they were until they faced death. Only then did they understand just how beautiful living was.

At the same time, they understood just how much courage it took to risk your life and bleed to drive away evil.

Right now, Long Chen was covered in blood, and his robes were in tatters. His blood slowly dripped down, but he still stood tall and straight, like a mountain within a sea, an immovable existence.

However, he was definitely in a terrible state. His lightning wing and flame wing were gone because Lei Linger and Huo Linger had entered a deep slumber. This attack had exhausted all of their energy.

Long Chen had not used their power all of this time just to prepare for this attack. Everything went as planned.

The more abundant his violet qi, the more astral energy he could draw in, and the greater the power he could control. But at the same time, the backlash grew.

Thus, in order to be sure of victory, he had Huo Linger and Lei Linger share the backlash with him. That was a fortunate decision, as otherwise, the backlash would have severely wounded him.

Suddenly, the earth quivered and bulged. As a result, the cheers were cut off and people stared in horror. “Alldevil Tianye didn’t die?!”

However, Long Chen’s expression was calm. He walked forward a few steps and suddenly stabbed the Minghong Saber into the ground.

A giant figure was lifted out of the ground. It was Alldevil Tianye’s body.

After being stabbed, his body began to shrink. In the end, he became the size of a normal person.

Alldevil Qianye no longer appeared indomitable. His body was a pulp of flesh and blood, and his bones were shattered. Right now, his body was like mud, and his aura was beyond weak.

He was already on the verge of death. This blow from Long Chen didn’t just destroy his physical body, but it also destroyed his spirit, his will. Even if Long Chen let him off now, he wouldn’t be able to live after this.

This was a battle of experts. It didn’t leave any room for retreat. He could accept death, but he couldn’t accept defeat.

“Inferior… human race… Just wait… my… Alldevil race… doesn’t just have… one Supreme… Just wait… wait… for death…” Alldevil Tianye’s gaze was no longer focused, and yet he still forced out a sinister smile.

His words were like the devil’s curse, giving people chills. But Long Chen calmly said, “It doesn’t matter how many Supreme geniuses you have. I’ll kill as many as there are. Regretfully, you won’t see that day. Sorry, but can you die faster? I have to keep my word. Your head will be an offering to the fallen warriors, and they are waiting for me. I don’t want them to wait too long.”
