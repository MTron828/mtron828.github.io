Chapter 3977 Dragon Soul Body Forging Art

“Senior, tell me what the good news is!” Long Chen was delighted. It seemed that something good was about to fall into his lap.

“Well, it’s not necessarily a good thing, so whether it’s a blessing or disaster is still uncertain. But since my dragon blood has perfectly merged with your body, your body has undoubtedly surpassed the limits of your human race. Furthermore, through your display just now, I find that the dragon essence blood has changed and become a new seed blooming with new life in your body. Perhaps… and I say perhaps, as it is just a possibility, you could cause this dragon blood to undergo a second awakening. Then the power of your physical body would reach an unprecedented level. It might even surpass mine from back then.” The dragon expert cautiously threw out this possibility, as it had no assurance when it came to this.

“Surpass you? Surpass ten thousand dragon powers? Is that even possible?!” Long Chen’s voice quivered.

“I cannot give you any assurance. All I can say is that the possibility is there. However, it is risky. If you wish to take this path, there’s no going back. If you succeed in this though, it might even be more important than cultivating the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. But then, whichever path you choose, it is still shrouded in darkness. You need to trailblaze a new path. In other words, if you want to try it, you not only need to think about your unknown path with the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but you will also need to add another path that is just as difficult. It will bring an even greater difficulty to your future,” said the dragon expert.

“Senior, can you tell me what your suggestion is first?” asked Long Chen.

“I once created my own body tempering art. This technique was my strongest cultivation technique that allowed me to look down disdainfully on generation after generation of ancestral dragons. But for some reason, when I transmitted it to my descendants, they were unable to inherit it. In the end…” The dragon expert sighed.

“In the end what?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“None of my descendants were even able to gain an initial mastery over it before their bodies exploded in the process. Also, my bloodline has existed for countless years, so I have witnessed millions of my descendants that were blessed with immense talent dying to this cultivation technique. In the end, I stopped transmitting this technique. In the past ten million years, I have been pondering whether this technique was so powerful that the heavens were jealous of it, so they made it so that other than me, no one else could inherit it. But seeing your potential today and your mutated dragon blood, my heart is stirring again. Even so, this is a very dangerous gamble. Very, very dangerous. I don’t know if it will harm you. Perhaps you will also die just like all the others.” The dragon expert’s voice was full of complicated emotions. That weary tone was exceptionally difficult for outsiders to comprehend.

As a peak expert, it possessed its own peak divine abilities, but it was unable to pass down its unmatched cultivation technique. It was a kind of silent pain.

It had helped Long Chen multiple times now, from guiding him through crisis, to bestowing upon him the divine abilities of the dragon race, and even imparting him with its essence blood. In truth, to a certain extent, Long Chen could be considered its heir.

However, this was a technique that could bring about Long Chen’s demise. Countless heavenly geniuses of the dragon race had died in their attempts to master this technique.

“Hehe, senior, don’t worry. When it comes to me, I am always in an emergency and need to deal with something. As for the future, I’ll think about it when the time comes. Just transmit that technique to me. We’ll see if it’s doable. Isn’t just trying it alright?” Long Chen’s disease flared up once more. Whether it was a miraculous treasure or a powerful cultivation technique, he had a fatal attraction to all of them.

Moreover, with how cautious the dragon expert was being, Long Chen was completely unable to hold himself back. This was definitely a heaven-shaking cultivation technique.

“This cultivation technique is a modified version of the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art, known as the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. While the underlying principles remain similar, the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art encompasses not only essence blood as its foundation but also integrates the spirit, soul, will, mind, blood, qi, and bones into it. Thus, its overall requirements are higher. One is like a constant tempering to increase your power, while the other requires all your seven foundations to be equal. They are linked by a profound connection that cannot be described with words or diagrams. It is extremely mysterious. All my descendants who cultivated the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art died, so I wondered whether it was because my teaching was bad or if they simply didn’t learn it right. Later on, I understood that it was both.

“I wanted to pass down this technique, so when I explained it, I went into great detail, repeatedly explaining so that they would remember every little bit. But later on, I understood that it had the opposite effect. Under the principle that the Grand Dao is simple, the more complex you make it and the more detailed you go, the more muddled it becomes. As a result, all the descendants who cultivated my Dragon Soul Body Forging Art were unable to escape the intrinsic thinking and cultivation style of the dragon race. As for my technique, it may appear similar to the dragon race’s divine abilities on the surface, but in the end, it is not the same. However, when it comes to how it is different, even after thinking about it for countless years, I was unable to figure it out. The most laughable thing is that I am the creator of this technique, but I only know the what, not the why,” sighed the dragon expert.

To have created a world-class divine technique yet not understand it was definitely a very comical thing.

“The Grand Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth; the Grand Dao is emotionless, moving the sun and moon; the Grand Dao is nameless, nourishing all life. No one can possibly explain the mysteries of the cosmos. Our human race likes to use the word Dao to encapsulate all things and their workings within this world, but we cannot clearly explain what this word Dao means. The Grand Dao cannot be put to pen and paper. It is limitless, without borders. Some parts of the Dao appear to be one thing but are actually another. In the end, one can only use one’s own experience to judge what is right and what is wrong,” said Long Chen.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The dragon expert said, “What you’re saying is very reasonable. Although you haven’t reached that realm, you are very close to it when you speak. As for perception and comprehension, it is your human race that stands at the peak. Even my dragon race cannot compare to you guys. Thus, after pondering it, I am willing to transmit this technique to you. If you are really able to learn it and transmit it to future generations, then I can already rest in peace.”

The dragon expert’s voice became a bit emotional toward the end. It seemed that it felt even greater excitement and anticipation than Long Chen.

“This cultivation technique has no mnemonic, so I can only teach you its energy circulation method.”

After that, the dragon expert transmitted an energy circulation method for the spirit, soul, will, mind, blood, qi, and bones. However, even with Long Chen’s comprehension powers, he was dumbfounded as he was completely unable to understand what this was. Could it even be called a cultivation technique?

“It doesn’t matter if you understand it or not. You should study it yourself. The more I teach you, the more narrow your path grows. I don’t want to repeat my old mistakes,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen was dumbfounded. All he had been given was an outline, and it was also incredibly general. He didn’t even know what the principles behind it were.

“Wait, Seven Star Battle Armor? Seven kinds of energy? Couldn’t I…?”

Long Chen suddenly jumped, feeling like he had just seen an unprecedented world before him. It was akin to countless bolts of lightning flashing through his mind. The door to the unknown slowly opened before him.
