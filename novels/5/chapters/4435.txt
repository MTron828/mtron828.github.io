Chapter 4424 Eternal Physical Body

Long Chen was shocked. Despite Lei Linger's formidable strength, she was shattered by this tribulation lightning.

Lei Linger reformed, only to be swiftly torn apart once more, and this cycle repeated nine times. The ninth time she recondensed, her form was more translucent, and she had an incredibly weak aura.

Long Chen was horrified by this. If this continued, Lei Linger would really perish. Even though she was a lightning spirit, she couldn’t endure this kind of assault.

Just as Long Chen wanted to help Lei Linger, she suddenly vanished, being summoned into the Earth Cauldron.

As a result, the heavenly tribulation seemed to have lost its target and suddenly redirected its fury toward Long Chen. When it did, an instinctive terror gripped him as the sensation of impending death descended.

In a desperate response, Long Chen summoned his starry sea manifestation and unleashed his full power.

BOOM!

The impact shattered his divine ring and blasted away the scales covering him. His blood flew through the air. Almost instantaneously, Long Chen was reduced to a mere lump of flesh.

Devoid of all his senses, he slumped lifelessly, looking very miserable. His hair was scorched, smoke came out of his mouth, nose, and ears, and he fell into unconsciousness.

Long Chen had fought against heavenly tribulation for many years. But unexpectedly, he was almost killed by one bolt of this heavenly tribulation.

Just as he passed out, he wondered, just what the hell was this heavenly tribulation?

The Earth Cauldron’s sacred light enveloped Long Chen, causing the heavenly tribulation to lose its target once more. After a brief shudder, the tribulation slowly dissipated, restoring tranquility to the world.

Long Chen lay on the ground, a bloody and battered sight. However, while he was unconscious, he continued to recover. In less than the span of an incense stick burning, scabs covered his entire body.

The scabs grew thicker until they finally formed a giant cocoon around Long Chen. Within the cocoon, Long Chen still had to endure a terrible torment.

That terrifying lightning continued to ravage him endlessly. It was like a fish caught in a net, trying to escape his body with all its might.

However, Long Chen firmly locked the lightning in place, and it grew frantic, wrecking him with all its power. Fortunately, his recovery speed outpaced the damage inflicted to him, healing any areas that the lightning tore through. As it ravaged Long Chen’s body, its power slowly merged into him through the wounds.

Long Chen was constantly being torn apart, but that energy was gradually weakening as it ran rampant through him.

After a day, the lightning was finally unable to move around anymore, its power firmly confined within him.

Three days later, the giant bloody cocoon slowly split apart, and Long Chen pushed it open. Looking at the state of his skin which resembled that of a newborn, he was stunned.

“This is a peerless-grade pill tribulation. Because it is a Saint pill, the heavenly tribulation’s power is at the Saint level, carrying a powerful Eternal energy within. Your physical body was just strong enough to withstand a single strike from it. Now, although you are in the World King realm, your physical body can be considered Eternal. But that’s not the most significant change. Look at your Spiritual Strength,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

“Heavens!”

Long Chen didn’t dare to believe it. His Spiritual Strength was many times stronger than before. This fact left him stunned.

“A Saint-level heavenly tribulation contains the power to destroy the soul, so it contains a certain law specialized toward the soul. Since it failed to destroy your soul, it became fertilizer to strengthen your soul. This way, it will be much easier to refine the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill next time,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Sensing the changes in him, Long Chen was overjoyed. His physical body had been incredibly strong, but now it instantly leaped to a new level. This blow from the heavenly tribulation had helped him immensely.

“Many thanks, senior!”

“No need for courtesy. Through refining the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill, I can rapidly recover. We are just helping each other. You should send a Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill to that nice girl. Have her immediately consume it,” urged the Earth Cauldron.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A medicinal pill that looked like it was made of white jade appeared in Long Chen’s hand. The moment it appeared, this world was lit up by its sacred light, becoming a wonderland.

Long Chen didn’t waste time and immediately summoned his Kunpeng wings. In just a moment, he got into the rear mountains of the academy and found Ye Xue. When he saw her, he could see that her face was still dim, her eyes despondent. Clearly the damage from losing the Sacred Light Pistil was greater than she had expected.

“Big Brother Long Chen!” As soon as Long Chen arrived, Ye Xue hastily stood up and acted like she was fine. That appearance of hers was heart-breaking.

“Here, open your mouth!”

Without wasting any time, Long Chen sent the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill into her mouth. Ye Xue didn’t even know what Long Chen was feeding her, but since he told her to eat it, she followed his direction.

“This is…!” After consuming the pill, her manifestation spontaneously materialized before her—an immense snow lotus.

The snow lotus initially possessed two pistils, but a third one rapidly sprouted from it.

Ye Xue's radiance was restored. At this moment, divine light gleamed in her eyes, and she exuded an aura of sacred brilliance.

“Big Brother Long Chen!”

Ye Xue stared at Long Chen in disbelief. When Ye Ling came over, she was also stunned to see this scene. Ye Xue’s Sacred Light Pistil had recovered. Furthermore, all three of them were showing signs of merging.

Long Chen smiled. “I like you better like this.”

“Ye Xue, how do you feel?” asked Ye Ling hastily.

“Master, I feel… like I’m about to become a Heavenly Doyen!” Ye Xue’s voice quivered.

“If you have this feeling, you have to go into seclusion immediately!” exclaimed Ye Ling excitedly. She hastily alerted her people to set up a seclusion place for Ye Xue. Furthermore, all the Earth Spirit race’s experts gathered and started to sing a beautiful song. It was most likely a blessing for Ye Xue.

Long Chen didn’t understand these things, but he knew that the Earth Spirit race was going to do everything they could to make Ye Xue a Heavenly Doyen.

Considering that he couldn’t help any further, he shouldn’t disturb them anymore. With that in mind, he stealthily slipped away.

When he returned to his refinement room, he asked the Earth Cauldron, “Senior, what use does the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill have for us?”

“Refining it allows me to extract the purest sacred energy to nourish myself. Moreover, the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill is an all-purpose medicinal pill. It can be used as a healing pill, helping a person recover from the verge of death in an instant. It can also be used to recover your exhausted qi, increase your realm, nourish your mind, heal the spirit, increase your comprehension, and break through bottlenecks. Practically everything that you can imagine, it can do.”

“What? It’s that amazing?” Long Chen had never heard of such an all-purpose pill before. This Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill was basically a priceless treasure, capable of saving his life at a critical time.

“Senior, just what is a Heavenly Doyen?”

Long Chen finally asked a question that had been lingering in his mind. He felt like the Earth Cauldron would definitely know the answer.
