Chapter 3919 Give You a Gift

“You dare to bring out such an insignificant trick?”

Long Chen sneered. Ji Wuming’s assassination arts might be terrifying to others, but they were nothing to him, especially after he had merged with the ancestral dragon essence blood. With this sacred halo of light in place, Long Chen viewed Ji Wuming’s spatial arts as a joke.

However, even before Long Chen could react to it, a small figure already charged over, stabbing a dagger toward Ji Wuming.

“Mingyu!”

Long Chen was startled as he felt that Dong Mingyu’s aura was weaker now, less than a third of her peak.

“Big brother Long Chen, I want this person’s head. That is my agreement with my master.” Dong Mingyu began to repeatedly force Ji Wuming back. Her position, angle of attack, and speed were all so perfect that Ji Wuming couldn’t even counterattack.

“But you…!” Long Chen was a bit worried. This was unfair, wasn’t it? Dong Mingyu didn’t need to force herself to this extent as he could deal with Ji Wuming.

“Big brother Long Chen, trust me. This is the trial my master left to me, so I must accomplish this.” Dong Mingyu’s figure suddenly vanished. When she reappeared, she was already hundreds of miles away, her dagger striking like lightning.

But to the people’s surprise, Dong Mingyu’s dagger was severed by Ji Wuming’s dagger.

“Mingyu, be careful! Enpuda is in another world sending power to him! The support multiplies his power, and his weapon also becomes sharper!” warned Long Chen.

Just then, Long Aotian, Kun Tu, Shi Yang, Ji Wuming, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and Weng Tianyao attacked Long Chen all at once. As for the mysterious beast cultivator, he led over a hundred peak experts toward Meng Qi and the others without any sense of shame.

“Idiots! Do you really think we’re some soft persimmons?!” Guo Ran furiously charged out.

However, a ray of Sword Qi was even faster than him, slaying a Double Supreme heavenly genius instantly. Even in his weak state, Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi was still so sharp.

Meng Qi, the Pill Fairy, Bai Shishi, and the others all attacked. The Dragonblood Legion once more entered their formation to face these experts.

Gu Yang then fought the beast cultivator. As they faced each other, the ten thousand dragons in Gu Yang’s manifestation roared at the ten thousand beasts in the beast cultivator’s manifestation, unleashing a torrent of attacks at each other.

“Even an injured tiger isn’t something a group of hyenas can bully! Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Guo Ran attacked and sent over ten powerful lifeforms flying. At that moment, Little Snow unleashed a wind blade sphere that exploded amongst them.

Cloud also returned to her true form, shooting out black streaks of light that directly split their enemies in two.

While Meng Qi and the others were in a weak state, this time, they finally had the number advantage.

As for their opponents, while they looked fine, they had just received Long Chen’s Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens. Although they looked fine on the surface, they were actually injured inside.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

With both sides having their disadvantages, what they were competing with was their wills. As a result, in just a few exchanges, Meng Qi and the others slew dozens of enemies.

Seeing this scene, those experts lost their courage and scattered, no longer even thinking about getting the ancestral dragon essence blood from Long Chen. They had only been thinking about killing a few of Long Chen’s people as vengeance for their slain comrades. Then they would at least be able to give an explanation to their elders when they got back.

However, the Dragonblood Legion was too powerful and had surpassed their expectations. After all, these people were from different races and powers. Without any sense of unity, they could be considered a rabble of forces. Thus, with a little show of power, they cowered and the battle ended in an instant.

The beast cultivator saw this change. Although he had taken the advantage against Gu Yang, beating the latter wasn’t a matter of one or two moves. Seeing the others run, he knew that he would be surrounded if he didn’t retreat, so he immediately fled as well.

However, just as he retreated, an earthen wall silently appeared around him, making him run into it head-first.

The beast cultivator had not expected a wall to suddenly appear like that. Although it wasn’t thick, it was extremely tough, enough to make him dazed.

“Want to go? Leave your life behind first!”

Li Qi and Song Mingyu attacked with their rods. Having finished absorbing the Yuan Spirit fragments hanging in the air, the malevolent spirits roared behind them. Now, within the entire Dragonblood Legion, they were the strongest existences.

Just as the beast cultivator was dazed from slamming into the wall unexpectedly, an arrow directly pierced his head.

The beast cultivator didn’t even have time to react and was killed by this arrow. The attacker was Mo Nian.

“I didn’t manage to do anything today! At least, one head will count.” Mo Nian was as pale as paper, but he still gave off the indifferent air of an expert.

As Mo Nian was the one who had summoned the barrier, he had suffered the most to keep it up. Furthermore, that coffin was a divine item nourished with his soul. So, when it was broken, his soul was also damaged.

He didn’t have much energy left. But seeing a chance to get a head, he didn’t hesitate, summoning what remained of his energy to directly eliminate one enemy, accomplishing a not-too-beautiful display of power.

Just at this moment, everyone heard a crisp sound in the distance. Startled, they saw that Dong Mingyu’s other dagger was also severed by Ji Wuming.

An assassin often had two daggers, one in forward grip and one in reverse grip. They could then switch between them or fight with just one.

After her first dagger was broken, Dong Mingyu did her best to avoid clashing with Ji Wuming directly, but after dozens of exchanges, she was forced to use her second dagger to block, resulting in it being broken as well.

A line of blood appeared on her forehead. If she had been the slightest bit slower, her head would have been cut apart.

“Now you’ve lost your daggers, like a viper without its fangs. All that awaits you is death.” Ji Wuming’s attacks increased in intensity. Without any misgivings, he pressed her back.

“For an assassin, relying on outside power is the greatest tragedy.” Dong Mingyu’s expression changed slightly after losing her daggers. She then repeatedly dodged his attacks.

Suddenly, a black streak of light shot toward Ji Wuming’s back. Ji Wuming instinctively dodged, and the black light continued toward Dong Mingyu.

“Mingyu, this is my gift to you!” shouted Long Chen.

Dong Mingyu reached out and caught a pitch-black dagger.
