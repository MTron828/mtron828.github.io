Chapter 4766 Cursed Divine Weapon

“Scram! Long Chen’s head is mine!”4

A strange person with two heads was the first to charge forward. Although Long Chen had blocked the Celestial expert’s attack and shocked everyone, this person was not shaken at all.1

He had a large and muscular build, holding a giant wolf tooth club. As the club descended, a terrifying Saint pressure rose as countless runes lit up on the club. With a Divine Venerate cultivation base, he somehow could activate a Saint weapon.3

“Die!” Both his heads roared at the same time as the attack surged forth, brimming with his full power. It had enough power to decide victory or defeat in an instant.2

As his wolf tooth club fell, the entire world quaked in response. Everyone could tell that he was an extremely terrifying existence. In response, Long Chen swung Evilmoon straight at the giant club, resulting in an ear-splitting explosion that drowned out all other sounds, engulfing the world in darkness.2

The two-headed lifeform staggered back seven steps, each of his steps shaking the void, until he barely managed to stabilize himself. When he looked up, he was shocked to find that Long Chen had vanished.1

“Can’t you fit even one brain in your two heads?” Just then, Long Chen’s sinister voice rang out.1

To everyone’s astonishment, Long Chen appeared behind the two-headed lifeform without any warning. He then grabbed one of the lifeform’s throats and forcibly ripped his head off.1

Long Chen tossed the head at another expert who was rushing over, and that expert’s blade directly blew the head apart.0

The now one-headed lifeform screamed in pain, clenching his remaining head. It seemed that he was suffering unbearable pain.0

“A curse?”0

Long Chen snorted. It was no wonder this lifeform was in such pain. The expert who had just blown up his head had a cursed saber, and Long Chen could sense the curse energy on it.0

Although the head had left the body, the curse still managed to infect the main body. This kind of cursed weapon was extremely insidious, capable of inflicting a fatal curse with even the slightest scratch. Furthermore, it would be an extremely painful death.0Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The expert with the cursed saber ignored this lifeform’s reaction and launched his saber like a bolt of lightning toward Long Chen.0

“Long Chen, is it? If you have the guts, try to block this attack!” he sneered disdainfully.0

Long Chen not only blocked this attack, but he also used his bare hand to do so. Blood-colored dragon scales covered his hand as he firmly caught the tip of the blade.0

“What?!”0

“Your power is only ordinary. Did you think that a cursed weapon could let you act so wildly? How foolish. I wonder how you’ve lived this long?” Long Chen sneered at him. This person was perhaps only slightly stronger than an average nine star Doyen, but he had still run to the very front to challenge Long Chen, hoping that his cursed weapon would be enough to vanquish him.0

Ever since he obtained this cursed ancient weapon, he had never lost anymore, and anyone who saw him would flee. Over time, it caused his confidence to overinflate.0

Unfortunately, he just had to encounter Long Chen. Long Chen was so contemptuous of him that he didn’t even bother using Evilmoon to block it.0

The cursed weapon was unable to even prick his scales, let alone send its curse energy into him. It had absolutely no effect on Long Chen.0

Long Chen gazed apathetically at the panicking expert in front of him. Suddenly, astral light appeared on Long Chen’s hand, and the cursed weapon’s runes started to light up.0

Watching his cursed weapon’s runes light up, this person’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. As the master of this weapon, he was only able to activate a tenth of its runes. However, Long Chen had fully ignited all of its runes.0

The cursed weapon quivered as if roaring. It was crying out, trying to escape Long Chen’s hand, and people could sense its terror.0

The master of the cursed weapon was completely dumbfounded. He wanted to run, but he also thought about how he would be nothing without this cursed weapon. Thus, he was trying to pull it back with all his power.0

BOOM! 1

The cursed weapon grew brighter and brighter, its aura growing increasingly powerful. Unable to endure this terrifying power anymore, it exploded.1

Countless fragments of this cursed divine weapon shot out in every direction, turning its master into a sieve.0

“Run!”1

Frightened cries rang out, and everyone hastily dodged. Those who didn’t have time to dodge quickly swung their weapons to defend. In the end, only those who reacted slower were directly pierced through by those fragments.0

Just like the one-headed lifeform, they screamed in pain as something black oozed out of their wounds. Following that, their wounds rapidly rotted.1

Some people reacted fast enough and abandoned their bodies, having their Yuan Spirits flee. However, their Yuan Spirits had just left when strange black threads bound them. Their Yuan Spirits then screamed in terror as they despaired. This curse would not let them off.0

“AH!”0

Countless screams echoed throughout the sky. In the end, their Yuan Spirits also rotted away, turning into black smoke.0

This cursed weapon was truly terrifying. Long Chen had used his astral energy to fully unleash its curse energy to the point that it couldn’t bear it. With one move, he slew hundreds of thousands of experts, including quite a few monstrous existences.3

It didn’t matter how strong they were, if they didn’t have the ability to block this curse, all that awaited them was death. The space around Long Chen instantly cleared, leaving only a few hundred survivors capable of resisting the cursed weapon. These individuals were undeniably powerful.0

“Now there’s no need for you to hide!” Long Chen declared coldly, resting Evilmoon on his shoulder as he gazed at these remaining individuals. They were his real prey.18
