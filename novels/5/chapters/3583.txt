Chapter 3572

“You are the boss that senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran is constantly talking about?” asked Tu Hu, his gaze now absolutely reverent.

It had to be known that Guo Ran was one of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s four heroes, and the only one with no background. He relied on his own efforts to climb to his current height.

In just a year, he grasped the divine forging arts that countless people could not comprehend even after decades of study. Even the college’s senior experts said that he was a genius who lived for forging.

Guo Ran relied on his own talent and perseverance to subdue countless experts. It could be said that his rise in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was a miraculous story.

It was unknown just how many worshippers he had in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. They all viewed him as an idol, learning from him.

However, this miraculous genius often mentioned a name. That name was Long Chen, a mysterious man who Guo Ran called his boss.

Hence, those disciples were all very curious about this mysterious man. Every time someone praised Guo Ran as a genius, he would say that in this world, other than his boss, there were no other geniuses.

That was why when Long Chen revealed his name, all the disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College were stunned. They had actually met a legendary existence.

Long Chen’s heart warmed. He hadn’t expected Guo Ran to be constantly talking about him. He had never come to the Alldevil Star-Field, but people already knew him.

“That’s right, I am his boss.” Long Chen smiled.

By admitting it, Long Chen made those disciples look at him like he was a monster.

“No wonder you are so terrifying even without battle armor! So you are senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran’s boss!”

They no longer doubted Long Chen in the slightest. Long Chen asked, “What happened here? Why is the wall between the worlds closed?”

As soon as he said this, he noticed that the atmosphere was off. Almost everyone had hateful expressions.

“You must not know. Our Alldevil Star-Field… ugh.” Tu Hu clenched his teeth and told Long Chen the story about the Alldevil Star-Field.

The Alldevil Star-Field’s human race had been enemies with the Alldevil race for many generations. They had fought for millions and millions of years, fighting over space to live. Their enmity was as deep as the sea.

The human race relied on their powerful forging arts to equip themselves, raising their killing power. They constantly innovated, constantly coming up with new ways to grow, creating all kinds of battleships and battle armors. Their rate of development increased over time.

According to reason, the human race should have gradually come to suppress the Alldevil race. However, it was the opposite. As the human race grew stronger, their survival grew more difficult.

That was because the hearts of the humans had changed. As people got stronger, some people also grew greedy. The Alldevil Star-Field’s land was mostly completely uncivilized. They were occupied by the devil beasts.

However, those regions contained all kinds of precious ores that had never been excavated, medicinal plants that had lived for countless years. Many of those were unique to the Alldevil Star-Field and could be sold for exorbitant prices in the outside world.

It could be said that if the Alldevil race was destroyed, the Alldevil Star-Field would become a treasured land with endless resources.

Just a few million years ago, the human race grew so strong that they began to suppress the Alldevil race. But then, as humans fought over the resources, each harboring their own sinister motives, they suffered a great defeat.

That defeat left the human race badly wounded and countless experts fell. Due to the various major forces still harboring selfish desires, they kept their unique forging arts an absolute secret, refusing to share them with others.

As a result, so many experts died and so many major forces were wiped out. Many secret inheritances were never passed down and thus lost forever.

Furthermore, after that battle, the human race could only struggle at death’s door. They had not managed to recover even after all these years.

And even after all of that, the human race did not reflect on what had gone wrong. No… instead, they blamed each other until they fractured. As they fought off the devil beasts, they also had to fight off their fellow humans. There was no way for the human race to reclaim any territory. The land that their ancestors had fought so hard for began to recede.

As for the current era, although the condition here had started to take a turn for the better, people’s hearts were still like scattered sand. It was very difficult for them to show any unity.

The most aggravating thing was that traitors had appeared in the human race, colluding with the Alldevil race to harm their fellow humans.

The Luo clan was one of them. The Luo clan had once been the most glorious family in the Alldevil Star-Field. They produced countless heavenly geniuses and powerful experts, possessing a supreme inheritance. But with their skilled forging arts, the Luo clan’s traitors had created a seal that isolated the Alldevil Star-Field.

Incited by the Luo clan, many humans also surrendered to the Alldevil race. But the majority were still fighting with their lives on the line, swearing to fight to the death against the Alldevil race.

“How foolish. The Alldevil race is a pack of beasts. Is their word worthy of trust? Once they dominate the Alldevil Star-Field, they’ll devour these people as well. They’re digging their own graves.” Long Chen couldn’t help sneering at the Luo clan.

“Exactly! But they are in a desperate state and cannot see so far. Furthermore, some people are naturally cowards. They forget that their own ancestors fought to the death for the human race. By surrendering to the Alldevil race, they are betraying their ancestors,” said Tu Hu hatefully. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Even an outsider like senior apprentice-brother Long Chen can see it clearly. Those people are all idiots,” said one of the disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College resentfully.

“They’re not idiots, they’re cowards. They don’t dare to face death. They also know that they won’t have a good ending, but they still have some hope for a stroke of luck. Furthermore, even if they do die later, it’s a bit better than dying now. To put it frankly, their bones have softened. Actually, this is very good,” said Long Chen.

“How is it good?” Tu Hu and the others were dumbfounded.

“When the waves wash away the sand, they leave behind the gold. Through this tribulation, I trust that the Alldevil Star-Field will be reborn. Even if it means cutting away your own flesh to remove the poison, once the storm passes, the rainbow will shine brightly. After the tribulation comes new growth,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Tu Hu and the others nodded. That was very reasonable. Those that didn’t surrender had joined forces against their common enemies. It wasn’t like before when they were all fighting amongst each other.

All things had good points and bad points. However, right now, they were in their most terrible state and could only see the bad side, not the good side.

The bad news was, the Alldevil race was going all-out, and human traitors were scheming for them. The situation did not bode well for the surviving human race.

“Senior apprentice-brother Tu Hu, we came to send resources, but now we’re trapped. Should we ask for aid from the college?” asked one of the college’s disciples. Tu Hu was their leader.

“No need.”

Before Tu Hu answered, Long Chen spoke up.

“Prepare yourselves. In a bit, I’ll lead you to wipe out these fellows.”

“Eh?”

Tu Hu and the others practically didn’t dare to believe their ears.
