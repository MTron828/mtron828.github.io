Chapter 2583 The Blood Race’s Provocations

Guo Ran swaggered over to the entrance of the Yin Yang World. That appearance of his truly made people want to slap him.

Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan had come as well. There were just over ten thousand Dragonblood warriors with them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Their arrival delighted the Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts that had been standing guard over this place.

During the past few days, the Blood race had launched repeated sneak attacks against their defenses. However, they were forced to only passively defend as the senior generation refused to allow them to go on the offense.

Constantly defending had long since infuriated them. However, their mission was to guard this place and not let a single expert of the Blood race charge onto the continent, so they could only endure.

Seeing the Dragonblood Legion appear, especially Guo Ran’s swaggering appearance, they instantly knew that there would be a good show.

“Guo Ran, why have you come?” asked Ye Lingshan. She remembered Long Chen saying that the Dragonblood Legion would be going into seclusion. Why had they come out so quickly?

“Is the alliance head here?” asked Guo Ran stealthily, not directly replying.

Ye Lingshan said, “Master went to the Divine Ice Palace. After that, she said that she would go pay her respects to the Illusive Music Immortal Palace and then the Wine God Palace. It will probably be a few days before she’s back. Why?”

“She’s not here? Hahaha, good, good. Senior apprentice-sister Lingshan, I’m sure you’re tired. We’ll help you out for the next few days,” laughed Guo Ran.

“I only got here yesterday,” said Ye Lingshan.

“As the future alliance head, there’s no need for you to personally stand guard here. That is giving far too much face to the Blood race. It makes them think that we’re afraid of them. You should go back and leave things here to me,” said Guo Ran amicably.

Ye Lingshan looked at Guo Ran and then at the Dragonblood warriors overflowing with battle intent. She instantly realized what Guo Ran wanted to do.

“Don’t mess around. Right now, we need to be steady. Time is favorable to us, so we don’t need to take the risk,” said Ye Lingshan.

“I’m not messing around. My boss has ordered me to slaughter the Blood race. Boss said that we have to suppress their arrogance. This relates to the morale of the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Guo Ran solemnly.

“Really?” Ye Lingshan looked to Gu Yang and the others.

“Aiya, would I dare to trick you? Just find a chair to watch the show from. Leave the rest to us,” Guo Ran hastily interrupted this thought, afraid of Gu Yang and the others not properly covering for him. He then led them forward.

Since these were Long Chen’s orders, Ye Lingshan didn’t stop them. Guo Ran was extremely refreshed at this. His boss truly was the boss. Even the future alliance head listened to him. The feeling of giving fake imperial edicts was truly good.

“I hear that the Blood race has been particularly arrogant lately? My boss specifically sent me to handle you. Warriors of the Martial Heaven Continent, watch us. Don’t forget to cheer for us.”

Guo Ran walked to the front and raised his fist into the air. After following Long Chen for so long, when he got serious, he actually did have some of the air of a leader.

This shout instantly drew fanatical cheers out of the disciples guarding this place. The Martial Heaven Continent’s number one legion had come. Their blood instantly began to heat up.

The seniors looked at each other, not knowing what to do. The youngsters today really weren’t steady enough.

However, they also knew that they had truly grown old. Their hot blood had faded, and they no longer had the impetuousness of youth. Perhaps every generation would always belong to the young.

This disturbance naturally drew the Blood race’s attention. Their experts began to gather.

There was now a ten-thousand-mile domain between the Martial Heaven Continent and the Yin Yang World. The laws of both worlds were present in this space.

This was different from when Long Chen had appeared here last time. Within this domain, both the Martial Heaven Continent and the Blood race’s experts could fight at their maximum potential. This had now become an even battlefield for both sides.

Last time, Long Chen had charged into the Yin Yang World, the home territory of the Blood race, suppressing their army of millions and millions of experts, slaying Heaven Merging experts, and defeating Sovereign sprouts. He had made them lose a great deal of face.

Although their world divine item had interfered in the end, forcing him out and injuring Daoist Heavenly Feather, that was not enough to win back all the face that they had lost. Hence, the Blood race had launched multiple sneak attacks after he left, wanting to kill a few of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.

However, the suppression of the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent meant that even after dozens of sneak attacks, they were unable to break through their blockade. Not even a fly was able to get by them.

They had sacrificed tens of thousands of their experts for nothing, further enraging them. In order to vent that rage, they began to curse the Martial Heaven Continent’s disciples blocking them.

Unexpectedly, they were extremely skilled at cursing people. They had all kinds of vile curses that made the Martial Heaven Continent’s disciples gnash their teeth.

If it weren’t for the seniors harshly ordering them, it was unknown just how many of them would have charged out to kill the Blood race army.

This battlefield had ended up becoming unusual, where the Blood race was sending out people to curse them every few minutes, insulting the human race’s ancestors about how they had been useless and conquered by them, how they had trampled them.

Even the alliance head was unable to keep everyone under control, which was why she had called Ye Lingshan over. After all, they were all youngsters. If it was just the seniors ordering them to suppress their emotions, that would not work as a long-term plan.

However, just after Ye Lingshan arrived and before she had come up with a solution, Guo Ran also came.

“Hahaha, the human race has actually sent out a group of dogs. So what? They’re all cowards only fit to kneel beneath our feet.” The provocations of the Blood race instantly started back up.

“What idiots. Did you not hear your daddy Guo’s words? I haven’t killed people in a few days. If you want to die, then come,” said Guo Ran, leading the Dragonblood warriors into the special domain.

“Hahaha, the cowards of the human race have come to die.” One of the Blood race’s experts stepped into the battlefield, hundreds of thousands of his comrades standing on the border of the battlefield. This would be an even battle.

“An ant also dares to be so arrogant. Who wants to kill this trash?” Guo Ran looked at that expert and shook his head.

“Me!” One of the Dragonblood warriors instantly stepped forward.

Guo Ran eyed him and cursed, “Have some face. You are a squad leader. Why bully a minor character? Leave it to one of the other brothers.”

That person could only retreat. After that, one of the ordinary Dragonblood warriors walked into the center of the battlefield.

The Blood race’s experts instantly grew excited. Their throats were already tired from cursing for days. Their chance for real retribution had finally come.

“Lai Bu, make sure to go lightly. Don’t instantly kill him and extinguish this new bravery of the human race.”

“Right, if you kill one and the others turn coward again, there won’t be anything to play with.”

“Yes, let him exchange ten blows before killing him. Let them have some hope, hahaha.”

The Blood race’s army cheered. However, they didn’t notice that as they said all this, they couldn’t antagonize the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. Instead, the ridicule on the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts’ faces grew.

“You’re trembling. Are you afraid?” asked the Dragonblood warrior lightly.

His opponent smiled, revealing sharp teeth. “Can you not tell? This is excitement. I can’t contain myself when I think of slaughtering all the human race once we invade.”

The Dragonblood warrior also smiled. “I’m also excited. We normally end up fighting against our own race, but now I’ll get to slaughter other races. I don’t need to feel a weight on my conscience and can slaughter you freely. I’m thinking it really will feel amazing.”

“What an idiot. Even with death at hand, you are still so carefree. Do you not realize that the Martial Heaven Continent is on the verge of annihilation?” sneered the Blood race expert.

“I really don’t know that. Why don’t you show me your ability? Then maybe I’ll have a sense of crisis.” The Dragonblood warrior smiled indifferently. He arrived just three hundred meters away from his opponent.

“The human race is so stupid that I can’t be bothered to waste words on you. Take out your sword. Otherwise, once I attack, you won’t even have a chance to take it out.” His opponent slowly spread his arms. Runes lit up all over his body, and his Blood Qi began to rise.

“I don’t need to unsheath my sword against you. Go ahead and make your move.”

“Die!” The Blood race expert was infuriated. At this moment, the ground beneath him shattered, and he shot forward, turning into a blood-colored streak of light.

BANG!

A fist tore through the void, unleashing blood mist. Then the streak of light continued several miles before slowing down. Startled cries rang out.

That Blood race expert’s head was now missing. His headless corpse continued into the distance due to his momentum before collapsing.

The Blood race’s army was stunned. As for the Martial Heaven Continent’s side, the only reason that they were startled was because they couldn’t even clearly see what had happened just now.

That Dragonblood warrior hadn’t summoned his manifestation or even unleashed his aura. Yet, they were unable to clearly see his movements before his opponent was killed.

“Tch, after bragging so much, he wasn’t even able to endure a single blow.” The Dragonblood warrior shook his head disdainfully. Looking at the Blood race experts in the distance, he shouted, “I am Ling Weifeng of Long Chen’s Dragonblood Legion’s thirty-seventh squad in the third corps. If you want to quickly reincarnate, step forward and take advantage of this opportunity.”

This shout drove the Blood race’s army crazy. One of them charged forward, unleashing a palm that released countless blood-colored ripples in the void.

“Careful, that’s their bloodline sealing art!” shouted the Martial Heaven Continent’s side.
