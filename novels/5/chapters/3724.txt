Chapter 3713 Who Is Courting Death

This sudden attack made everyone jump. It seemed that He Changtian had been holding back this entire time just to have the opportunity to kill Xia Chen in one move.

BOOM!

Over ten thousand flames crashed down upon Xia Chen from all directions. When the void exploded, Xia Chen was devoured by flames.

Everyone was shocked to see this. Xia Chen had no chance to get out of the way. This attack had definitely crushed him.

When Xia Chen’s figure vanished amidst the raging flames, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s people cheered.

“Did he die?”

The spectators were stunned. Although this attack was well-planned, they still felt that there was something off. But they couldn’t say what was off about it.

“Death Substitution Talisman! Watch out, behind you!”

A warning rang out. Following that, people looked behind He Changtian just in time to see Xia Chen’s figure appear out of the void. He silently struck He Changtian’s back with his palm. Within his hand was a Heaven Shaking Talisman.

With this warning, He Changtian hastily turned back. There was no time to block with his spear. Xia Chen’s palm was right in front of him, so he instinctively extended his left hand to block.

BOOM!

He Changtian’s left arm was blown apart. The immense force of Xia Chen’s attack almost blew his head apart as well.

Seeing Xia Chen just barely fail to kill him due to that person’s warning, Guo Ran furiously cursed, “What rat bastard is such a busybody?! Everyone already agreed that it was a fair one-against-one fight! You’re cheating!”

Everyone looked in the direction of that voice and saw a violet-robed elder standing in the distant sky.

“It’s a Divine Venerate!”

“The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s Southern Wall King. He actually came.” Some people recognized this elder. He was clearly a famous existence.

He Changtian was shocked and enraged. He barely escaped death just now. Xia Chen’s attack was truly vicious, striking right after the Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor’s power had been unleashed and had yet to gather once more. It was when its defenses were at its weakest. Without that warning, he definitely would have died.

“Battle Souls Return!”

He Changtian didn’t tarry. The scattered flames and runes within the world shook and rushed back toward He Changtian, wanting to return to his battle armor.

“You think you can pull them back now? Keep dreaming!”

Xia Chen laughed and suddenly formed hand seals. Hundreds of talismans then appeared behind him.

“Heavenly Water Prison!”

After that, those hundreds of talismans exploded and giant water dragons came flying out.

Every water dragon gave off immense pressure and crashed toward He Changtian like lightning. Water qi filled the air, forming a special water barrier that separated all the flame runes from He Changtian.

Hundreds of water dragons in this barrier began to spin in opposite directions, compressing space. Heaven and earth rumbled. Just like that, the space within this water sphere fractured. Even the laws of the Heavenly Daos were being torn apart by it.

He Changtian was shocked. This water barrier was separating him from the outer world’s flame runes. Those flame runes simply bounced off this water barrier, unable to barge in.

If he couldn’t recall those flame runes to his battle armor, his battle armor’s power would diminish by quite a bit. Most importantly, if those runes completely ran out of energy, then the Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor would be ruined.

He Changtian roared. Flame runes then condensed into a new arm for him. Wielding his spear with both hands, he stabbed it into the water dragon barrier.

BOOM!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was actually knocked back by the barrier. In that one blow, he was shocked to find that a great deal of his flame energy simply evaporated.

Only now did he realize that the water that Xia Chen had summoned was no ordinary water. It had a suppressive effect against his flames.

Just then, something that he couldn’t bear to see occurred. He didn’t know what Xia Chen did, but a flame dragon somehow appeared outside the barrier and began devouring the flame runes that were stuck outside.

With every rune that the flame dragon outside devoured, a scale on his armor shattered. In just the blink of an eye, dozens of his scales were destroyed.

That flame dragon was not summoned by Xia Chen. It was Huo Linger who couldn’t contain her greed. She didn’t want these runes to end up using all their energy and be wasted, so she came out to devour them.

“Courting death!”

A cold shout rang out. That violet-robed elder in the distance finally couldn’t hold back any longer and directly charged into the battlefield, reaching out toward Huo Linger.

He had no choice but to interfere now. If Huo Linger continued to devour them, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor would be ruined beyond repair.

An uproar exploded amongst the crowd. Was the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire really going back on their own word? They had agreed on a one-against-one fight. However, that previous warning was already an infraction. Now that he was directly interfering, was he not afraid of the whole world laughing at them?

“Are you talking about yourself?”

Just as the violet-robed elder shot out, a voice filled with unquestionable dignity rang out. Another figure appeared.

He wore no crown and no imperial robes. But when he appeared, his ruler qi radiated and a natural noble air spread, one that could make the entire world submit.

Xia Guhong showed up, blocking the violet-robed elder. The violet-robed elder then slammed his palm forward without hesitation when he saw someone block his way.

Xia Guhong only extended a single finger. The wind from this finger tore a hole through that elder’s palm and continued to pierce through his shoulder. As a result, blood rained down.

The rain of blood fell, and people saw the drops of blood turn into runes that slowly vanished. The blood of this expert was actually reabsorbed by the Heavenly Daos.

“What?!”

Countless people were shocked. They stared in shock and amazement at this new expert that radiated ruler qi. Xia Guhong’s name was known to everyone in the senior generation, but many of the junior generation didn’t know him.

Even if people knew of him, they had never seen him, so they didn’t recognize him. Amongst the ones who didn’t recognize Xia Guhong was this violet-robed elder.

This elder was enraged at being injured. He shouted, “Who are you?!”

“You don’t even recognize the famous monarch of the Grand Xia Nation, Xia Guhong? You really are a worthless character. A person can be lacking knowledge but not common sense. Do you think that there is a second person in this world that can produce such a noble aura? When Xia Guhong participated in the immortal world’s wars, your grandfather had yet to be even born. Youngsters should know respect.” A mocking voice rang out.

Unexpectedly, the one to mock this violet-robed elder was the Bloodkill Hall’s master, Enpuda.

Furthermore, when Enpuda reported Xia Guhong’s name, countless people were shaken. They were bearing witness to a legendary figure.

“Seventh uncle, save me!”

Just as Xia Guhong was shaking everyone, He Changtian’s terrified cry rang out.
