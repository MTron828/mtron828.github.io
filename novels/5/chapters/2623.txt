Chapter 2612 Wild Dragon Roars at the Heavens

“An inferior human dares to insult me?!” The four-colored Peng’s fury soared. It was a demon king, one of the leaders of the demonic beast race.

Its feathers were plucked off, and it was running around naked. That was exceedingly humiliating.

Furthermore, because it was running with its two legs, it truly exposed his butt that was shaking left and right. Pointing out this weak point drove it crazy.

“Insult you? Who would be so bored? Stand still! Three chicken wings isn’t enough for me. My brother has a big appetite, so I need an entire chicken roast!” sneered Long Chen, quickly catching up.

One bird and one person sped through the Ancient Battlefield. The void was torn apart as they entered the depths.

“Are we still being monitored?” Long Chen suddenly asked Evilmoon.

“Yes. However we’re quickly going to leave that area,” answered Evilmoon.

Within the divine families, Long Chen had felt a strange feeling. However, he had assumed that it was related to the formations of the divine families, so he hadn’t put too much thought into it.

However, when he had been speaking with Elder Long, he had realized that something was off. When they entered a region where that feeling vanished, Elder Long had suddenly said some important words.

When he suddenly shut his mouth, that feeling of being observed return. When Long Chen asked Evilmoon, Evilmoon had examined their surroundings closely and concluded that it wasn’t a formation, but some kind of powerful divine item keeping an eye on him.

“It’s most likely the divine families who set you up to save the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion. They want to make it so that you can’t leave without worrying that they’ll be killed,” reminded Evilmoon.

“I know. Elder Long is correct. Once any power grows to a certain extent, what lies in their eyes is only what can benefit them. Even people are nothing more than chess pieces to be used. If I hadn’t come, then the eighth legion probably wouldn’t have been destroyed, but I guarantee at least half of them would die. They betrayed the divine families for me in the Star Field Divine World. I can’t possibly watch as they’re killed,” said Long Chen.

Evilmoon was silent. Long Chen’s weakness was clear. As long as they could grasp this weakness, crushing him was simple. However, Long Chen couldn’t change his character, or he wouldn’t be Long Chen.

“We’ve passed the surveillance area,” said Evilmoon suddenly. Long Chen also felt a weight lighten.

“It seems that the divine families can only keep an eye on a limited area. But to be safe, Evilmoon, you’ll have to work hard in a bit. I don’t want to expose too many trump cards,” said Long Chen.

Evilmoon assented. It was no problem. Following the four-colored Peng, Long Chen gradually entered the depths of the Ancient Battlefield.

Here in the depths, spatial cracks were all over. There were wide chasms and bottomless holes all over. These were the marks of experts having fought an immense battle. Their terrifying wills still remained even after all this time.

“You’ve been surrounded,” said Evilmoon.

“Are there any undefeatable existences?” asked Long Chen.

“No. There are six demon kings from different directions. This bald chicken probably sent out a cry for help,” said Evilmoon.

“Then I’m not worried.” Hearing that they were still on the level of demon kings, Long Chen was at ease. Evilmoon was a dark evil dragon. The dragon was the emperor of all beasts. Evilmoon had sharp senses towards these demonic beasts, even sharper than Long Chen.

“They’re about to finish the encirclement. We can attack,” said Evilmoon.

“No rush. I came here to confirm something,” said Long Chen.

“Let me remind you that there are still more demonic beasts in the distance that are also coming. Even if they can’t kill you, if they trap you, they can easily exhaust you to death. Furthermore, they might draw some even more terrifying existences. Then this little life of yours will be lost here.”

“I’m not afraid. Life’s greatest joy lies in courting death in as fancy a way as possible.”

Evilmoon ignored that comment. It knew Long Chen had his own plan. Perhaps he had noticed something, but had simply yet to say something.

“We can’t go any further. There are terrifying experts gathered ahead!” shouted Evilmoon suddenly.

“Then that’s the place. Help me keep an eye on what’s going on there.”

Long Chen suddenly vanished. When he reappeared, he was right behind the four-colored Peng.

Long Chen hadn’t been chasing it seriously this entire time. He had just been using the chicken to show him the way. Now that he had arrived, he raised his saber. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Blood splashed. The four-colored Peng had been in the midst of using one of the demonic beast race’s special divine abilities to secretly communicate with the nearby demonic beasts. Just as the encirclement was finished and it was about to mock Long Chen, Long Chen sliced off its head without any warning.

Its body was pulled into the primal chaos space in an instant. Long Chen stabbed its head with Evilmoon.

“AHH!” The four-colored Peng screamed miserably. Long Chen formed hand seals with his left hand. A dark blue net descended onto its head. Spiritual Strength gushed out.

“Soulsearch.” Long Chen activated a soulsearching art to see if he could gain anything useful from its memories.

Unfortunately, just as he managed to pull its soul out, it violently exploded.

“You used too much force,” cursed Evilmoon.

A demonic beast was not a human. They didn’t cultivate the soul. Long Chen had directly crushed its soul as if he had used a hammer to strike a peach. Now nothing remained. What was he supposed to search through?

“Whoops. I forgot.” Long Chen awkwardly stared.

“Don’t waste the effort. Their souls are too weak, and your control is crap. You won’t be able to do a soulsearch,” said Evilmoon.

“Brazen human, you’re courting death!” Just as Long Chen put away the head, the sky darkened. Over ten giant figures appeared at the same time.

At the same time, a tide of endless demonic beasts appeared. It appeared as if the entire world had been filled with demonic beasts. Long Chen was surrounded.

“Wow, there’s bulls, tigers, leopards, pythons, and more! That’s all good meat. My brother will definitely be happy.” Long Chen looked at those demon kings like food. Wilde liked powerful meat. These demon kings were perfect for that. Wouldn’t Wilde be able to advance even further after they were consumed by him?

“Die!” A golden-horned bull roared and stamped on the air with its four legs. It was like a giant mountain hurtling towards Long Chen.

Just as it attacked, the space behind Long Chen shuddered. It was as if it had frozen, preventing Long Chen from escaping. This was a strange divine ability similar to the spiritual lock of the human race.

Golden light exploded from its horns. Two giant cuts appeared in the void. It was possible to see an endless black space within those cuts.

“Some beef first. I can finally resume my meat diet.”

Long Chen laughed and swung Evilmoon. Black qi burst out of Evilmoon. A sharp light shimmered on top of Evilmoon’s blade.

The terrifying golden-horned bull’s head was cleanly sliced in two as easily as if it was tofu.

“Nice!” Long Chen cried out delightedly. A demon king had been killed in one move. Evilmoon was truly worthy of being a king from the dark evil dragon race.

“Shut up!”

Evilmoon cursed furiously, and Long Chen shut his mouth. He couldn’t anger Evilmoon currently, because Evilmoon was currently in the Heavens’ Wrath state.

When Long Chen had been training in the ninth form of Split the Heavens, in order to be able to keep his mind, he had given his soul to Evilmoon to control.

As a result, Evilmoon had also learned how to enter the Heavens’ Wrath state. When it entered this state, it needed Long Chen to maintain his calm.

In this state, Evilmoon was naturally easy to anger. Just a word from Long Chen made it explode.

This was their first time doing such a thing, and yet Long Chen was still not treating it seriously. Evilmoon’s fury almost exploded out of control.

Long Chen hastily apologized. Evilmoon had given its soul to him. This was also dangerous to Evilmoon. One mistake from Long Chen could cause Evilmoon to lose its mind. Then who knew what the consequences would be?

When Long Chen entered the Heavens’ Wrath state, Evilmoon was always as serious as possible, but Long Chen’s current attitude infuriated it. Evilmoon almost wanted to cut Long Chen.

The golden-horned bull had only just been killed when a tiger pounced at them. Evilmoon sliced through the air, and its fangs were broken. The tiger let out a muffled grunt and retreated.

Evilmoon swung through the air. A head bigger than a mountain flew through the air. Even these demon kings were unable to bear a single strike from Long Chen.

Long Chen was excited, but also shocked by how strong Evilmoon was. He felt even more gratitude towards Sovereign Yun Shang for leaving Evilmoon to him.

In the Heavens’ Wrath state, Evilmoon had activated some kind of divine ability. It was slicing through their terrifying physical bodies like iron through mud. Long Chen had never seen such a sharp divine ability before. Even though he had the utmost confidence in his physical body, Long Chen didn’t dare to receive Evilmoon’s attack in this state.

“Wild Dragon Roars at the Heavens!”

Long Chen suddenly involuntarily roared. Black qi gushed out of Evilmoon, filling the world.

Long Chen himself jumped in shock. Spiritual Strength poured out of him. His dragon blood instantly began to boil.

A giant saber-image swept out in every direction. Anything touched by it was cut in two whether it was a regular demonic beast or a demon king.

“Not good!”

Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He bit his finger and used the blood to draw a divine rune in the air. He pressed it onto Evilmoon.
