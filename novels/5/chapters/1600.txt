Chapter 1595 Strange Lifeform

Translator: BornToBe

A three-inch-tall figure of Long Chen appeared. It was identical in appearance to him. This was his Yuan Spirit.

His Yuan Spirit slowly entered the old man’s head, and the old man opened his mind-sea for Long Chen.

“I can’t believe I was stupid enough to agree to do something so crazy.” The old man bitterly smiled. His own Yuan Spirit was looking at Long Chen’s Yuan Spirit.

He truly felt like he had gone insane. No one had ever dared to do such a thing before. However, Long Chen had promised that there wouldn’t be a problem.

“Ah, just relax. It’ll be fine,” said Long Chen.

“Prepare yourself. I’m about to start.”

The old man’s Yuan Spirit enveloped Long Chen in its energy. Long Chen could feel the old man’s vitality slowly dissipating. His vision turned dark.

“So this is how it feels to die. Endless darkness...” Long Chen felt like he had descended into eternity.

It was no wonder old people said that people had to live properly and be grateful for everything they had. It was because people’s deaths always lasted much longer than their lives.

He didn’t know how much time had passed. Eventually, a gate appeared within the darkness, and a ray of light shot out of the gate.

The surroundings were still simply darkness. The only thing visible was a path formed of that light. Long Chen found that he and the old man were present, not just spiritually. They were in the same state as they were in the world of the living.

He raised his arms, he raised his legs, and he found nothing different about himself in this world. His power was still there.

“How curious.” The old man was also testing this new world. However, he quickly found that although his clothes were still present, his spatial ring had vanished along with his connection to his spiritual space.

“It really is just like the legends. Once in the Netherworld, it’s impossible to bring in things from the outer world. Even these clothes are fake, formed from the surrounding laws,” said the old man.

Long Chen also couldn’t sense his spiritual space, but he was delighted to find that he could still sense his primal chaos space.

He extended a hand, and a wooden staff appeared in his hand. It was the staff that the old man usually held.

“You... How did you do that?” The old man jumped in shock.

Long Chen had previously been told by the old man that in the Netherworld, people were dead. According to some legends and sayings, the things on the Yang side were unable to enter the Yin side.

That was why Long Chen had specifically asked the old man to give him the black staff. He had placed it in his primal chaos space. However, he hadn’t actually expected to be able to take things out from his primal chaos space within this world.

“Ah, if only I had known this was possible. I would have brought in the Heaven Splitting Blade too. Should we go back?” Long Chen was vexed.

In the beginning, Long Chen hadn’t had any confidence in this. It had just been a casual experiment, but it had actually succeeded. If only they had brought the Heaven Splitting Blade, then the old man’s chances of success would have been practically guaranteed.

“Little fellow, you really have some skill.” The old man took the staff excitedly. With a weapon in hand, his confidence rose. Seeing Long Chen’s vexed expression, he said, “Be happy with what we have. This is the Netherworld, the opposite side of the Yang world. The Heaven Splitting Blade’s nature is heavily Yang. If we brought it in here, it would be like carrying a lantern in the darkness. That’s too dangerous. The staff is good enough, and its body originally came from a darker place. It’s not as conspicuous in this world, and I can use Split the Heavens with it. As for going back, that’s impossible. Once I go back through this gate, the gate will forever close, and I would never have another chance at the Netherpassage realm.”

The two of them continued onward through the gate. As expected, a long bridge appeared on the other side.

The bridge was covered in dense smoke, and countless figures were roaming across it. There were men and women, young and old. They were staring vacantly.

When he had seen them through Qu Jianying’s vision, he hadn’t sensed anything in particular about them. However, this time, he clearly sensed their spiritual fluctuations.

They weren’t the spiritual fluctuations of normal people. Their spiritual fluctuations were completely calm.

“They should be mortals whose souls were drawn here after death. They are roaming aimlessly... Watch out, that fellow’s appeared.”

Suddenly, the old man stopped after seeing the chain-wielding monstrosity appear. It was like a killing machine, its chains piercing through these wandering souls and absorbing them.

“Those chains should be treasures focused on absorbing souls.” Long Chen’s eyes began to shine.

“Don’t you dare. Those chains cannot be touched.” The old man jumped in shock upon seeing Long Chen’s expression. Long Chen’s guts were even bigger than his.

“I was just talking. How could I be as unreliable as that?”

“Don’t even try it. I can tell what you’re thinking with just a glance. We’re not in the Netherworld for fun. Don’t mess around. We’ve already agreed that you’re to scram as soon as we arrive at the Gates of Hell,” warned the old man.

The old man had agreed to let Long Chen come, but only to the outer regions. He was to leave from his gate once they reached the Gates of Hell.

This gate had the old man’s spiritual mark on it. As long as the old man didn’t die, this gate would stay open. Although the Netherpassage realm was mysterious, there was still some general knowledge passed down from ancient stories.

“Fine, I’ll listen,” said Long Chen obediently. He didn’t want the old man to drive him away in a fit of rage.

The old man and Long Chen carefully walked past the monstrosity. The old man was ready to attack at any moment, as he was afraid of this monstrosity sensing that Long Chen did not belong here.

Although Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was powerful, he did not possess life and death energy. The old man was very worried for him. He was the hope of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect.

Fortunately, the monstrosity didn’t even look at them. The two of them easily passed by it, but just at that moment, rumbling rang out behind them, causing them to jump in fright.

In the distance, another gate had opened, and a large red-haired man walked out. This man was a head taller than Long Chen and had a third eye on his forehead.

Long Chen and the old man’s hearts shook. This was clearly another expert attacking the Netherpassage realm. Furthermore, his aura was very powerful. His third eye gave Long Chen a sense of grave danger.

This person was definitely not human. His aura was turbulent, as if he had been bedeviled. A human definitely wouldn’t have such an aura. A person’s aura stayed the same upon entering the Netherworld.

The red-haired man looked around and slowly approached the bridge. When he saw the chain-wielding monstrosity, a red light shot out of his third eye and illuminated the monstrosity.

The monstrosity didn’t seem to sense anything. It continued to harvest the roaming souls.

The old man transmitted to Long Chen, “His eye should be a kind of magical art to peer through a person’s abilities. You can see strange runes appearing on the chains when his red light illuminates it.”

After examining the monstrosity, the red-haired man carefully dodged it and continued onward.

He quickly reached a place closer to the two of them. When he saw Long Chen, he became dumbfounded. He was clearly shocked at Long Chen’s cultivation base.

Then when he saw the old man’s staff, his expression completely changed. He pointed at it and strange sounds came from his mouth.

“Do you know how to speak the human language?” probed Long Chen. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The red-haired man didn’t seem to understand him, and he suddenly attacked Long Chen with a claw. His hand was as quick as lightning.

“Fuck, do you think I’m easy to bully?!” raged Long Chen.

Long Chen was just about to attack when the old man’s staff swung from a strange angle at the red-haired man’s wrist.

What startled Long Chen was that the staff suddenly became flexible and wrapped around the red-haired man’s wrist. The red-haired man was also startled, and he was just about to pull back when the old man landed a kick on his crotch, sending him flying.

“Ah, it seems I’m not the only one skilled in the crotch kick.” Long Chen had never expected that the old man was also skilled in this move.

“Brat, you dare to bully my family’s child? Are you trying to get yourself killed?” shouted the old man, pointing his staff at the red-haired man.

The red-haired man suddenly let out a furious roar, and a red light shot out of his third eye.

The red light contained strange runes. When they appeared, Long Chen felt like the world was collapsing. He almost coughed up blood.

“Activate your sixth sense!” shouted the old man. His staff transformed into a black streak that smashed toward the red light.

BOOM! The red light exploded.

“Split the Heavens 5!” Just at this moment, with the staff already swung down, a black saber-image shot out of it.

“Two attacks in one move?” Long Chen was shocked. The old man’s technique was truly refined.

The red-haired also hadn’t expected such a strange move. His hands drew a circle in the air, forming a blood-colored barrier in front of him.

He let out a miserable scream as a huge cut appeared in the middle of his body, almost cutting him in half.
