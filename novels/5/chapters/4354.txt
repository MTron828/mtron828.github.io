Chapter 4343 Nothing

“Bastards!”

Furious roars split the air as thousands of lifeforms broke through the encirclement with ease.

Although the heavenly tribulation had expanded to an unprecedented scale and stretched the defensive line to its limit, it should have been impossible for thousands of lifeforms to just sneak in and breach the defenses unnoticed. A mole had to have helped them in.

It had to be known that these invaders were all in the Immortal King realm, and there were only a few thousand of them. If the person on watch had given a warning, then by joining forces, they could have definitely stopped the invaders.

These invaders were charging into the ongoing tribulation. It was clear that they had strategically chosen to attack when the people inside were in a vulnerable state. That way, their arrival would instantly tip the scales. Now, the Dragonblood warriors and their companions were at risk of suffering terrible casualties, and the worst-case scenario could involve their complete annihilation.

Hence, a sense of shock, anger, and panic gripped the ones defending the perimeter. By the time they reacted, the invaders had already charged into the heavenly tribulation, rendering any attempts to halt them futile.

At this moment, the heavenly tribulation quivered, unleashing swords of lightning upon the invading lifeforms.

When these lifeforms got into the heavenly tribulation’s area, the tribulation’s power raged even more, but their figures weren’t duplicated. Clearly, by joining in midway, the heavenly tribulation had to give them a bit of time before duplicating them.

“Long Chen, you damnable bastard! Do you recognize me?!”

Two voices boomed at the same time, their loudness eclipsing even the sound of the heavenly tribulation.

Looking over, everyone was shocked to see a two-headed lifeform standing not far from Long Chen and his companions. His manifestation was a blend of black and white light, creating a strange Yin Yang monstrous face that bore a striking resemblance to a fiendish mask.

When Xia Chen and Guo Ran saw him, they felt a jolt in their hearts. This person was one of the nine top heavenly geniuses from the humanless world.

Despite having not undergone the baptism of the primal chaos spirit pool, his manifestation still pulsed with primal chaos qi, a clear sign that he had rooted himself into primal chaos.

“So what if you stole our energy?! We could still obtain enough primal chaos qi. As I said, you will pay a terrible price for your actions!”

As the two-headed lifeform’s faces twisted with fury, the fiendish mask in his manifestation grew even more frightening.

“So what if you could obtain enough primal chaos qi? Do you want to make me pay for it? Just with you? Where are the others?” Long Chen regarded him with a disdainful gaze and then scanned the surroundings. He then added with a sardonic tone, "Did you come for payback because you couldn't stand the humiliation of the three of us infiltrating the humanless world and escaping unscathed?"

“Hmph, the others are having their tribulations, and only I was unwilling to leave things as they were, so I came to settle things with you,” retorted that two-headed lifeform in a sinister tone. He clearly had immense pride and confidence in himself. After all, Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran had not only stolen the opportunity that should have been theirs but also humiliated the humanless world’s lifeforms.

Unable to accept this humiliation, the two-headed lifeform had been patiently bidding his time, even forsaking the chance to undergo tribulations with his fellow people. And finally, the traitors of the human race yielded to their desires and took the risk to set up a formation to secretly guide him over.

However, these traitors only had an average proficiency in formations, a far cry from Xia Chen’s mastery. So, they had originally wanted to send over a full hundred thousand of these lifeforms, but due to some imperfections in their formation, these lifeforms had to endure a terrifying pressure as they passed through the gate. As a result, many of them were directly crushed by the gate’s pressure.

This two-headed lifeform managed to lead the survivors through, albeit heavily wounded. After finding a place to recuperate, they waited for their chance.

With the traitors exposing Long Chen’s actions, every single one of Long Chen's movements fell under this lifeform’s surveillance. But in reality, Long Chen never tried to conceal anything.

While Long Chen and the others underwent their tribulations, the lifeform’s troops were watching through their concealing formations. Now that the opportunity had ripened, they launched their sneak attack.

“Warriors of the humanless world, the time to wipe away our humiliation has come! Kill them all!” roared the two-headed lifeform.

“Kill!”

Those lifeforms roared with him, and all of them unleashed their full power. After summoning their true bodies, they charged over.

“You really are lacking some brain cells. Playing with your lives, sigh… I suppose you won’t learn your lesson until you’re given a beating. Did you think that my tribulation was something that you could barge into?” sneered Long Chen.

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking dragon cry rang out, and an enormous lightning dragon materialized. Its claw then swiped at the two-headed lifeform and covered all his people in an instant, causing the two-headed lifeform to be taken aback. As this claw descended, the very fabric of heaven and earth twisted, and a fearsome lightning domain enclosed them.

In response, the two-headed lifeform roared and transformed into an enormous black python. His true form was originally that of a two-headed black python, so when he opened both of his mouths, a beam of black and a beam of white light shot forth to intercept Lei Linger's lightning claw.

BOOM!

The heads of the two-headed black python represented two different laws, and his attacks were incomparably sharp. However, they still shattered upon contact with Lei Linger’s dragon claw.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What?!” The two-headed black python was left in disbelief. This was his innate divine ability, but it was unable to shake Lei Linger’s dragon claw in the slightest.

With a deafening impact, the dragon claw crashed down, encasing the thousands of experts from the humanless world, including the two-headed black python. They were all compressed into a small spherical lightning domain.

They crazily attacked this lightning domain, but it was firmly caught by the dragon claw and didn’t even budge.

Somehow, the enormous two-headed black python was unable to endure a single blow from Lei Linger. Now, it simply looked like a dragon was holding a fish.

“Heavens, what is that?!” Everyone was stunned to see the enormous lightning dragon.

“Isn’t that senior apprentice-brother Long Chen’s divine lightning beast?”

“Heavens! That’s terrifying! That two-headed monster is completely suppressed!”

At first, the onlookers had been worried for Long Chen, but it seemed that their worries were unwarranted, or rather, they needed to redirect their worries to these lifeforms from the humanless worlds.

Those lifeforms were still assaulting the barrier that Lei Linger had trapped them in. However, Lei Linger was now comparable to an Eternal expert, and within the heavenly tribulation, her power was limitless. As the two-headed python had yet to break through to the World King realm, he couldn’t even shake her.

“What a pity. I thought that I’d get more of you. Are you looking down on me? They ended up sending a good-for-nothing like you!” Long Chen eyed the trapped two-headed python and shook his head in obvious disappointment.

Originally, he had been hoping to get all nine of those experts to come. Then, they could undergo tribulation together and settle their grievances. However, only one of them had come, and he had been directly suppressed by Lei Linger’s claw.

Seeing Long Chen’s disappointed expression, the two-headed python cursed him furiously. However, Lei Linger’s thunderforce firmly kept him trapped. He and his people were now completely isolated, and the heavenly tribulation had lost interest in them, returning to its original appearance.

Unable to receive the baptism of heavenly tribulation, they knew that their power wouldn’t advance, leaving them incensed.

Long Chen simply ignored them. His attention was fixed on the heavenly tribulation and the struggling combatants. Many of them were starting to falter, their breaths growing labored and a sense of despair taking hold of them.

“The path of cultivation is one where you can only go forward, not backward! Our greatest challenge is ourselves. In the past, you hated yourselves for being weak, for being powerless. But what about now? Are you going to lose to your weak self?”

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, this isn’t fair! We’re constantly exhausting our energy, but they seem to have limitless power!” argued a disciple from the academy. He was covered in blood and looked as if he was on the verge of collapse.

Long Chen replied, “You are talking about fairness? When has this world ever been fair? You see what is unfair to you, but you don’t see what is unfair to others. The Heavenly Daos has made a replica of you when you just started your tribulation. Although they have limitless energy, their power is limited. As for you? After fighting for so long, have you not noticed the changes in yourself? Your power has been growing all this time, while they are still stuck where they were. To cultivate is to constantly advance, to constantly get stronger. You are already stronger than a minute ago. With every breath, you have to get stronger, and with every breath, you grow. They are only your past. If you can’t even beat your past self, how will you face the future?”

Long Chen’s voice resounded through the tribulation, reaching deep into their very souls. Even the spectators felt their blood heating up as a surge of valor swelled within them, tempting them to charge into the heavenly tribulation and join this trial.

“Boss is right, to cultivate is to defy the heavens and pursue immortality. We must continue to climb. The past must remain in the past so that we can advance to the future. How could I lose to my past self?”

Yue Zifeng was a bit pale after fighting his duplicate for so long, clearly having depleted his energy. However, all of a sudden, he sheathed his sword.

His copy seemed to sense something and trembled, likewise sheathing his sword.

“Goodbye. My past self, I will remember you, but I will not let you become a stumbling block for my future.”

Yue Zifeng closed his eyes, his expression devoid of any emotion. He seemed to have merged with all of heaven and earth.

Out of nowhere, two swords were unsheathed simultaneously, and two beams of sword-light cleaved through the very fabric of heaven and earth, slicing through the tribulation clouds.

BOOM!

The moment these two Sword Qis clashed, one of them instantly crumbled, and Yue Zifeng’s duplicate was cleanly cut in two.

Yue Zifeng then resheathed his sword. Looking at his duplicate, he smiled and waved his hand.

“I will remember you.”

BOOM!

That slain copy exploded, transforming into lightning runes that merged with Yue Zifeng. In the blink of an eye, Yue Zifeng’s aura crazily climbed, and a divine radiance blazed behind his head. A trace of a World King’s aura emanated from him.

“Kill!”

After Yue Zifeng vanquished his duplicate, a frenzy swept over everyone else, as they too launched relentless assaults on their respective duplicates.
