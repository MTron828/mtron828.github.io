Chapter 3294 Devil Eye

The threads of light fell, piercing the earth. It then formed a heaven and earth encompassing cage. Seeing this scene, Long Chen felt a sour feeling in his bones. This cage definitely posed a fatal threat to him. Once he was trapped, he would definitely die.

Hence, he could no longer bother with finishing his mission and fled as fast as he could. On the other hand, the cage was rapidly closing and the space within compressed. Even time seemed to freeze inside of it.

Long Chen knew that this cage was similar to the Raging Flame Prison. The smaller it shrunk, the greater its power. If he wanted to escape, he had to break free just as it formed.

As a result, his lightning wings flapped, and he raised his speed to the pinnacle. However, the black dragons behind him didn’t seem to sense the danger and continued to chase after him.

The threads of light closed just as he reached the edge of the cage, but seeing this, Long Chen raised his bone saber. A sharp will then erupted. When divine light lit up on his saber, it formed a resonance with the sky.

“Split the Heavens!”

A giant saber-image soared, shattering all laws. It crashed down with a will to destroy heaven and earth.

BOOM!

The threads in front of him then broke and a hole appeared. As a result, fragments of spacetime flew through the air. It was as if the world had been destroyed in this area.

Meanwhile, Long Chen’s face turned red, and he coughed up blood. Because of that attack, he received a heavy backlash, and the majority of his spiritual yuan was instantly used up.

“As expected, Split the Heavens can hardly merge with the Heavenly Daos.”

Long Chen felt bitter inside. With Luo Zichuan’s guidance, Long Chen had comprehended the essence of the Saber Dao and the principles of the Heavenly Daos. Seeing that he had comprehended both, he wanted to recreate the nine forms of Split the Heavens. This new Split the Heavens would be one that merged with the Heavenly Daos before striking.

However, Split the Heavens possessed the will to split apart heaven and earth. It was contrary to the Heavenly Daos. It was like saying you would borrow something from someone and then hit them with it.

This was quite contradictory. But Long Chen was also quite smart. He compartmentalized the Heavenly Daos’ power into two parts. One part was the one kind to him, and the other part was the one that hated him. 

He was attempting to absorb the power of the Heavenly Daos that favored him in order to strike the part of the Heavenly Daos that detested him. That way, it wouldn’t just be an all-out indiscriminate attack, sharply reducing its power.

It was a good idea, and he had made progress in this regard. But compartmentalizing the good and bad of the Heavenly Daos was not so easy. Furthermore, it had to be done in an instant. It was almost impossible.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Thus, even as he absorbed the energy from the kind part of the Heavenly Daos, he also absorbed a bit from the other side. So, while his attack was now several times greater than before, there was still a backlash.

If it wasn’t because the Devil Eye Water Lily was so terrifying, he wouldn’t have risked using this move. But its power was truly immense. It actually made an opening for him, and he charged right out of this cage.

Bai Shishi and the others were delighted to see Long Chen running over. Bai Xiaole immediately sent the black dragon flying over to receive him. As long as they picked him up, they could immediately leave.

However, before Bai Xiaole could even move, nine different colors of divine light filled the air. A giant lily appeared. Long Chen had just escaped the cage when he was devoured by that lily, and this scene caused Bai Shishi and the others to cry out in shock.

Long Chen also hadn’t expected the Devil Eye Water Lily to set up a trap for him. The nine-colored lily seemed to have been waiting for him.

As space was sealed, Long Chen lost his sense of perception. In that instant, it felt like he had fallen into a bottomless hell.

An eye then appeared behind him. Its nine-colored pupil emitted endless killing intent as it glared at him.

Long Chen suddenly noticed that he couldn’t move at all with this eye staring at him. Icy-cold chills filled him from head to toe.

At some unknown point, flower stamens that were as thin as threads had bound his entire body. They had thorns that stabbed his body.

Even his dragon scales were unable to stop them. A mysterious energy invaded his body, causing him to lose his perception.

Long Chen was appalled. The Devil Eye Water Lily was too terrifying. Even after losing its seed pod, it still possessed the power to easily kill him.

Long Chen estimated that after losing its seed pod, the Devil Eye Water Lily had manifested its true form, using some other part of it as a replacement for the seed pod. It then crazily absorbed the power of heaven and earth, storing it for this attack.

If he had run while the Devil Eye Water Lily was shooting the sword-light, not giving it time to store up energy, perhaps he would have gotten away.

However, due to wanting to accomplish his mission, he had stayed and now he was caught. The nine-colored lily had folded around him. This was its own separate space cut off from the outside world. It was a bit similar to the primal chaos space. Here, the Devil Eye Water Lily was a supreme king.

“Wait, the primal chaos space…”

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. Just at this moment, the nine-colored devil eye in front of him slowly condensed into a spear that was like a mosquito’s mouthpart. It slowly pierced toward Long Chen’s head.

“You want to take back your seed pod? Unfortunately, what has entered Boss Long San’s hands doesn’t get out!” Long Chen laughed.

Suddenly, the space behind Long Chen shook and black soil gushed out like a river freed from a dam. It filled this world.

Seeing this, the nine-colored lily trembled. Long Chen then felt a burst of power, and he was sent flying out. As the black soil filled the air, he saw the giant lily rapidly shrinking.

“Haha, I also have something terrifying!” Long Chen laughed and flew away. He was then swallowed by a black dragon. It was the one that Bai Xiaole was in control of.

“Run!”

As soon as Long Chen entered the flying boat, Bai Xiaole ordered the black dragon to flee. Long Chen then spread its divine sense. He saw black qi floating out of the Devil Eye Water Lily. It was shrouding itself in black mist.

Seeing this, Long Chen sighed with relief. This time, he really had managed to flee from the gates of hell.

The Devil Eye Water Lily was truly terrifying. Let alone in its current state that could be considered the Immortal King realm, even if it was in the Divine Lord realm, he wouldn’t be a match for it. For an existence on this level, fighting across realms was a joke.

Fortunately, the black soil restrained it. It seemed to be in the midst of expelling poison, trying to expel the energy of the black soil’s devouring ability.

Long Chen sighed with relief. When he fought Liu Ruyan back then, she possessed a surprising resistance to the black soil.

As for the Devil Eye Water Lily, he didn’t know if it was because its resistance to the black soil was simply weaker or if the black soil’s power had increased after ascending to the immortal world, but the black soil was actually very effective against it.

“That was stimulating.”

Looking at the countless devil dragons chasing them crazily, Long Chen sighed emotionally.

Jiang Yuhe and the others almost cried.

“Grandpa Long, we still haven’t escaped! Those terrifying black dragons are about to catch up! Please think of something!”
