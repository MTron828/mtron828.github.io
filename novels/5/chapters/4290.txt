Chapter 4279: Slaying Peak Experts

“What?! Wasn’t the Seven Peak Sword destroyed?!”

A startled cry rang out. After all, the sword in Long Chen’s hands looked very similar to the Seven Peak Sword.

“No, it’s not a weapon! That’s condensed from essence blood runes!” exclaimed someone in disbelief.

“Impossible! If it was made of essence blood, how could it have the aura of an Eternal divine weapon?!”

When Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword slashed down, seven-colored light cleaved through the air. Lian Wuying’s five-colored seed pod was instantly cut apart, along with the enormous lily leaves that were in her manifestation.

“WHAT?!”

A manifestation could not be broken. That was an iron law. But today, that iron law was broken twice.

The first time was when Yue Zifeng cut through it, and now it was Long Chen. People stared at the sword in Long Chen’s hands. Someone as powerful as Lian Wuying was unable to even block a single blow from Long Chen?

“The seven-color Supreme Blood can only display its greatest power in my hands. Long Aotian is nothing. The Supreme Blood was only temporarily stored in him.” Long Chen’s gaze roved over the peak experts like an emperor looking at his subjects. While holding the Seven Peak Sword, multicolored divine radiance flowed around him, causing him to appear incredibly imposing.

Suddenly, the Seven Peak Sword became a seven-colored spear, and an aura that caused heaven and earth to quiver rose.

“Seven Peak Pierce!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Startled cries rang out when everyone saw the sword become a spear. So it really was condensed from Long Chen’s seven-colored Supreme Blood. Furthermore, this spear’s aura was even more domineering than that of the sword.

The seven-colored spear left Long Chen’s hand, shooting toward Lian Wuying like a shooting star. Lian Wuying had just been cut apart by Long Chen’s sword, and her body had yet to recover.

BOOM!

Long Chen gave her no time to heal. The seven-color spear then stabbed into her body with a supreme divine might and exploded.

The spear’s detonation was like the detonation of an Eternal divine weapon, blasting apart everything in a thousand miles. Everyone watched as Lian Wuying’s figure was destroyed.

Suddenly, within that void, a five-colored lily seed shot out. Everyone was surprised as Lian Wuying had reverted to her original state.

In other words, this attack of Long Chen’s had managed to harm her core, erasing her entire cultivation base. She had reverted to the first state of her evolution, a seed.

This seed was Lian Wuying. With the final wisp of her will, she used the last dregs of her power to fly to the Devil Eye Water Lily race’s side.

This was the terrifying tenacity of the Undying race. However, this was still a serious blow to her. She would need to start over from zero, with even her memories erased.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen simply waved his hand, and that lily seed was caught in his hold. “Want to run? Keep dreaming!”

Long Chen tossed it into the primal chaos space. After dealing with Lian Wuying, a seven-colored divine light flashed, and Long Chen seemed to teleport right beside Mo Nian.

When Long Chen extended his hand, the Seven Peak Sword appeared once more. He then slashed it at the half-step Eternal fighting Mo Nian.

Surprised, the half-step Eternal chose to ignore Mo Nian, his weapon smashing toward Long Chen with all his power. However, to everyone’s astonishment, this attack landed on nothing but air.

“Die!”

Taking advantage of his dumbfounded shock, Mo Nian roared and smashed his shovel onto this half-step Eternal’s head.

“AH!” The half-step Eternal screamed as Mo Nian’s shovel was firmly embedded into his head.

Although people were used to seeing fighting and killing, for this strange weapon to be fully embedded into someone's head was a sight that made them cringe and quiver with fear.

The half-step Eternal’s head rapidly darkened, followed by his entire body as corpse poison invaded.

This shovel was often used to do some unclean things. As a result, it was stained with corpse poison and ancient rust. This was Mo Nian’s most toxic weapon.

Normally, Mo Nian only used it to smack people around, not to kill them. That was because he had never encountered anyone worth using the corpse poison on. But now, he could finally use it.

Just as Mo Nian’s shovel was firmly implanted in that half-step Eternal’s head, in the distance, blood splashed, followed by startled cries.

To everyone’s surprise, Ye Wuchen was impaled from behind by a seven-colored sword, with Long Chen being the assailant.

It was at this moment that people realized that appearing by that half-step Eternal expert was nothing more than a diversion. Long Chen’s real target was Ye Wuchen.

This would have never worked during normal times, as a half-step Eternal wouldn’t fall for such a thing. However, Long Chen had just crippled Long Aotian and Lian Wuying, shocking everyone with his terrifying power. With his nerves tense, the half-step Eternal’s judgment lapsed, causing him to be conned to death by Long Chen easily.

Also, Mo Nian and Long Chen were old partners in crime, so their cooperation was flawless. Long Chen hadn’t even told Mo Nian anything, yet Mo Nian had predicted what would happen with uncanny accuracy.

Thus, Mo Nian attacked before Long Chen’s figure had faded away. On the other hand, the half-step Eternal was baffled, while Ye Wuchen was unaware that a death god had arrived by his side.

“If a tiger doesn’t show his might, do you take him to be a cat? I, Mo Nian, have killed plenty of half-step Eternals! If I don’t show my real power, it seems that you’ll get the wrong opinion about me!” shouted Mo Nian arrogantly.

He pulled out his shovel from the elder’s head. After that, he slowly turned away, not even looking at him.

“Watch out!”

Guo Ran and the others suddenly cried out. That half-step Eternal had raised his weapon and stabbed it at Mo Nian.

However, Mo Nian didn’t even look back. He casually swung his hand back and caught that Eternal divine weapon, as if he was receiving a gift from someone. After that, he directly put it away.

The half-step Eternal suddenly collapsed, stunning many people. Mo Nian’s corpse poison was absolutely terrifying, but they also had to admire his guts.

If that half-step Eternal had some secret art to last just a bit longer, wouldn’t he have managed to kill Mo Nian then? He was a bit too crazy.

Long Chen had killed a half-step Eternal with a pupil art, slain the Long clan’s Eighth Elder from a great distance, crippled Long Aotian and Lian Wuying, and now conned a half-step Eternal to death. All of these feats left everyone utterly astounded.

As a result, countless enemies who were crazily attacking them were scared away, weakening the pressure on the Dragonblood Legion.

People just stared at Long Chen as he lifted Ye Wuchen with the Seven Peak Sword. Immediately, the expressions of the Ye clan’s experts transformed from tense to outright panic.

“Long Chen!”

“Don’t bother with pleading or threatening me. I’m tired of hearing it. If I want to kill someone, no one can save them.”

Long Chen’s hand quivered, and a burst of rainbow light erupted. Ye Wuchen didn’t even make a sound before he directly exploded.
