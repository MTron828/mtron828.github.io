Chapter 2372 Saving Enemies

Translator: BornToBe

The third legion’s warriors that were within the camp were all shocked. Just what had happened? Why had their commander drawn over so many demonic beasts?

There was no need for Ye Lingfeng to give orders. They instantly entered their combat state.

Arrows shot out of the camp, and the sound of cannons resounded through the air.

Giant corpses piled up as the demonic beasts at the front were slain. However, no one smiled.

“There’s too many demonic beasts! We can’t stop them!”

Even after using all their weapons, they were unable to stop the advance of the demonic beasts. They were too fast, and even if the ones at the front were slain, their corpses protected the ones behind them from most of the attacks.

The worst thing to occur in a battle against demonic beasts was to encounter such a wave. Once the demonic beasts began congregating for such an assault, they needed to be interrupted.

However, today, things had come too suddenly. These demonic beasts attacked from right behind Ye Lingfeng. The exploding formations set up underground that were normally used to stop the charges of demonic beasts would blow up Ye Lingfeng if activated.

That moment of hesitation allowed the demonic beasts to close the gap. As soon as Ye Lingfeng’s chariot entered the camp, he shouted, “Detonate all the Lightning Partitions!”

Explosions shook the land. Lightning mixed with flames blasted apart the demonic beasts.

After just over ten explosions, things fell silent again. Ye Lingfeng’s expression darkened. “What are you hesitating for?! Detonate them all!”

“Commander, this is the camp of the seventh legion, not ours. There were only sixteen Lightning Partitions.”

In the third legion’s camp, there were over three hundred of those bombs laid underground. If they were there, then these demonic beasts would have been wiped out instantly.

Unfortunately, Ye Lingfeng had forgotten that this wasn’t his camp. They had only come as a temporary garrison for this spot.

“Stop wasting words and focus on defense! We cannot allow them to enter!” Ye Lingfeng was so enraged that his face alternated between black and green. He personally stepped forward, summoning his manifestation and taking the vanguard position.

It went without saying that Ye Lingfeng was extremely powerful. His armor enveloped him in light, and his sword danced through the air, killing a powerful demonic beast with each slash. Although Long Chen disliked this fellow, he had no choice but to admit that he was powerful.

Ye Lingfeng led his warriors into battle, with the arrow towers, war chariots, divine crossbows, and dragon cannons all shooting from the rear. The demonic beasts were being slaughtered in waves.

Seeing how powerful the third legion was, Shen Chengfeng sighed. “They really are far stronger than us.”

If it was the eighth legion facing this assault, running would be their only option.

“Rather than saying that they’re strong, it’s more accurate to say that they’re wealthy. They are essentially created from money, but they also have a fatal flaw,” said Long Chen.

“What fatal flaw?” Shen Chengfeng hastily asked. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“They’re too prideful. They think a powerful costume makes them unbeatable. From their movements, you can see that they’re not accustomed to this kind of battle. In other words, in the past, they always crushed their opponents directly. To put it frankly, they’re a group of adults who have only beaten children. They have no idea how to work together in combat. Although their attacks look sharp, they’re just randomly shooting. They have no control over the tempo of the battle. I guarantee that in less than an incense stick’s worth of time, holes will appear in their defense,” said Long Chen confidently.

“Really? It looks to me that they’re definitely going to win. After all, their equipment is so strong,” said Shen Chengfeng.

Long Chen smiled and pointed at a formation disc. When Shen Chengfeng saw the information on it, his eyes almost popped out.

“You drew over the demonic beasts from three surrounding regions?!”

The formation disc showed countless demonic beasts rushing over to the seventh legion’s camp. Their numbers were several times greater than the current demonic beasts attacking.

“Long Chen, did we go too far? If the third legion is destroyed, we…” Shen Chengfeng’s voice shuddered. If Long Chen conned Ye Lingfeng to death, that would not be playing around. If the third legion over here was destroyed, it would be a catastrophe.

“Don’t worry, everything is under control,” promised Long Chen. “This battle will naturally draw the attention of the surrounding demonic beasts. When the other legions see that the demonic beasts are about to break through this defensive line, they’ll naturally come to reinforce it. That’s precisely why we’ll be able to profit the most. I don’t like doing small things. Hehe, even if a piece of meat were to jump into my mouth on its own, I’d be too lazy to eat it if it was too small.”

As expected, when the reinforcements of the demonic beasts arrived, the third legion was no longer able to endure and was starting to show signs of crumbling.

Ye Lingfeng went all-out, but no matter how strong he was, he couldn’t defend the entire line. He could only suppress one region, but the others were unable to endure.

“Commander, we must retreat!” shouted one of the vice commanders.

The demonic beasts were like a growing tide, and they were about to force the third legion to the point of no return. If they still didn’t retreat, they would be surrounded and doomed.

The space within the Ancient Battlefield was not stable enough to set up long-distance transportation formations. By this point, even if they requested help, it couldn’t possibly arrive in time.

Furthermore, the closest group to them was the eighth legion. With how weak they were, their reinforcements would be useless. That was not mentioning whether or not the eight legion would even want to help them.

“Have the large equipment pull back for now and unleash the full power of the arrow towers. There’s no need to consider the lifespan of the arrow towers,” ordered Ye Lingfeng furiously.

The arrow towers were stationary equipment that could not be moved freely. Once they lost this defensive line, those arrow towers would definitely be broken. Hence, upon hearing his order, the runes on the arrow towers ignited. Their arrows doubled in power.

With dozens of arrow towers unleashing a crazy rain of arrows, the demonic beasts were forced back.

“Those arrow towers are ruined. They won’t even have any value now,” said Shen Chengfeng.

To the eighth legion, every arrow tower was an important trump card to protect their lives. Seeing Ye Lingfeng sacrifice over sixty of them at once, he didn’t know what to feel.

“It’s not like they’re your arrow towers.” Long Chen smiled.

“But we want them.” Shen Chengfeng shrugged.

“Well, as long as this play finishes, I guarantee you’ll have more than enough arrow towers,” said Long Chen. Shen Chengfeng was so poor that he’d feel bad for his enemies over this.

BOOM!

The arrow towers began to explode one by one, crumbling into rubble.

However, they had accomplished their mission. The third legion had gained the time to pull back all the mobile weaponry they had.

“Retreat!”

Without the arrow towers, they no longer had the power to stop this tide of demonic beasts. Ye Lingfeng waved his hand, and the last batch of warriors flew into the three war chariots.

The war chariots had immense offensive and defensive power. They were also extremely fast. They were treasures that Shen Chengfeng and the others dreamed of having.

With the war chariots, they could safely retreat. This was the power of money.

The defensive line was broken, and the demonic beasts seemed to feel like they had won, charging inside. They quickly destroyed all the buildings that had been set up as they chased after Ye Lingfeng.

The third legion quickly retreated, with the space growing narrower. There were giant spatial cracks to the side.

Half an incense stick’s worth of time later, another camp appeared. That was the seventh legion’s second line of defense. Once they had retreated to that second line, Ye Lingfeng jumped off his chariot and sneered at the demonic beasts. He waved his hand.

Explosions suddenly occurred from underground. It was unknown what was hidden there, but thick smoke had enveloped the demonic beasts.

The smoke seemed to terrify the demonic beasts. They fled, with those behind also wanting to retreat when they saw it.

Demonic beasts began to collapse onto the ground, powerless.

“Idiot demon race, I’ll be using your corpses to make up for our losses! Brothers-” Ye Lingfeng was suddenly interrupted by consecutive explosions occurring amongst the demonic beasts. Blinding light filled the sky.

As they covered their eyes, a voice he hated rang out in their ears. “Brothers of the third legion, don’t be afraid! The eighth legion is here to save you! Brothers, take the- oh wait, no, kill the demonic beasts!”
