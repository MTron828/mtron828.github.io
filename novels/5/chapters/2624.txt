Chapter 2613 Sovereign Han Wei, Ninth Divine Emissary?

Only then did the black qi gushing out of Evilmoon come to a stop. Just now Evilmoon had almost lost control. The Heavens’ Wrath state was truly dangerous.

“Why did you stop me so early?!” raged Evilmoon. It had yet to fully leave the Heavens’ Wrath state.

“To save some energy. What if we encounter some powerful character?” said Long Chen.

In truth, Long Chen was shaken inside. Just what kind of existence was Evilmoon to still have such terrifying power even after being sealed by Sovereign Yun Shang?

Right now, mountains of corpses and seas of blood were all over the place. All those bodies had been sliced apart, and then their souls were extinguished by a tyrannical power.

Those corpses still had a sinister aura that was a bit odd. It seemed that Evilmoon had used its core energy just now.

“Evilmoon, you can use your core energy in your sealed state?” asked Long Chen.

Only then did Evilmoon notice. “It seems so. Hahaha, so the Heavens’ Wrath state can allow me to use a bit of my core energy through the seal. I didn’t expect such a thing. But it really is a small amount. I have three thousand runes on my body, but I can’t even activate a tenth of them.” Just as Evilmoon was pleasantly surprised, it grew vexed once more. “Long Chen, I’m going to enter the Heavens’ Wrath state again. I want to see if I can activate more power.”

Just now Evilmoon had lost control, which had formed a resonance with Long Chen. Hence, if both of them wound up infuriated, they would fully lose control. They needed at least one of them to remain calm. In this regard, Long Chen was extremely lacking compared to Evilmoon.

“Fine. We’ll investigate it further once you advance to Heaven Merging.” Perhaps Evilmoon also didn’t trust Long Chen. Long Chen’s skill at controlling his anger was truly trash.

“Curious. Why haven’t all those experts over there come?” asked Evilmoon suddenly.

“What?” Long Chen took out the Moon and Star Refining Furnace, using it to gather the corpses. Those demon king corpses were particularly valuable.

“There are countless powerful auras up ahead. They can’t possibly be unaware of what happened here. But they haven’t moved,” said Evilmoon.

“Let’s go take a look,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen had originally left a certain distance between them in order to be able to safely retreat if any of them came. But they were just standing there. That was curious. Ignoring the weak demonic beasts in the surroundings, Long Chen charged his way over.

Evilmoon’s senses revealed that more and more demon kings were appearing. But Long Chen no longer cared about them. They weren’t strong enough to stop him.

BOOM!

One demon king got in his way and was directly slashed. However, because Evilmoon wasn’t in the Heavens’ Wrath state, it was only injured, not killed. Long Chen would have added a second slash to make up for it, but he didn’t have time to waste on it, so he continued on his way.

More and more demonic beasts gathered, even blocking his sight.

“Someone’s observing us! It’s the divine families!” warned Evilmoon suddenly.

Long Chen nodded. The divine families had a divine item or some other power that could see through the Ancient Battlefield.

“How treacherous. I really don't like them.” Long Chen snorted and continued forward. Suddenly, space trembled and zither music entered his ears.

Long Chen then slashed his saber, killing the demonic beasts and pressing forward through a rain of blood. Finally, an opening appeared.

At this moment, he saw a translucent seal separating the Ancient Battlefield. Half the battlefield was on the other side, and a red-colored Sovereign character lay within the seal. A sacred and noble bloodline pressure came from it, one that could suppress heaven and earth.

“As expected, it’s another Sovereign seal.” Long Chen’s heart pounded. His guess had been correct. “I’m going to take a look.”

Long Chen charged forward. However, just at that moment, the void turned still and the demonic beasts vanished. The roaring disappeared without a trace. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Standing in the void, Long Chen could hear zither music ring out behind him. He then turned to see a woman in violet robes looking at him.

This woman was sitting in the air with an ancient zither resting on her knees. Her long hair fell around her face, fluttering in the wind. She appeared like a fairy who had descended from the heavens.

Although she was a woman of unmatched beauty, there was a trace of iciness within it. Her eyes in particular could make a person involuntarily shiver.

The aura of a Sovereign exuded out of her, giving people an urge to kneel. But that iciness did not match very well with it.

“You… you’re…” Long Chen not only recognized this woman, but he also recognized the zither on her knees. That was the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither, which was one of the supreme divine items, the Southern Sea Zither.

Furthermore, this woman was someone he recognized. He had seen her in a painting when he had encountered Zi Yan in the Eastern Wasteland. Back then, one of the paintings in the corridor of the Immortal Intoxication Pavilion had drawn his attention and given him a deep impression.

That painting had been nothing more than some simple lines that were unable to capture this woman’s beauty. However, the killing intent within her eyes had been almost perfectly replicated.

She looked at Long Chen with some surprise, but there was also some admiration in her eyes.

“May I ask whether I should call you Sovereign or the ninth divine emissary?” Long Chen cupped his fists.

Long Chen had asked Zi Yan why she was so sure that he was her life’s devil star, and one of her reasons stemmed from this painting. According to Zi Yan, the ninth Heavenly Music divine emissary possessed an innate heaven-defying divine music, and she specialized in the Dao of Slaughter.

Moreover, her life was filled with battle. She killed gods and devils, leaving behind mountains of corpses. Her killing intent was dense enough to cause the heavens to weep blood.

The ninth generation divine emissary was the only almighty expert of the Dao of Slaughter. For Long Chen to form a resonance with her proved that his desire to kill was far too great.

The woman suddenly smiled. She slowly stood and walked over to him.

“I didn’t expect that the person I was waiting for was the same as me. I’m truly excited. You have such dense killing intent. My name is Han Wei. In my previous life, I was called Asura Han Wei, as well as the ninth divine emissary. In my next life, I was also called Han Wei, but I was no longer called Asura. The Martial Heaven Continent bestowed a mission upon me, and people called me Sovereign. It truly is surprising. I actually ended up becoming a Sovereign.”

The woman’s voice was like music entering the depths of his soul. That was a kind of irresistible power. In front of her, no one could keep any secrets.

“Junior greets Sovereign Han Wei.” Long Chen bowed.

He hadn’t expected that this person before him was the fourth generation Sovereign that he had never heard of. She was the most mysterious Sovereign. He hadn’t expected her to be a woman.

The first, second, third, and fifth generation Sovereigns might have left behind very little in terms of information, but at the very least, the senior generations knew of their names.

Only the fourth generation Sovereign was exceedingly mysterious to the point that not even her name was known. If Long Chen wasn’t personally seeing this, even he wouldn’t believe it.

Sovereign Han Wei smiled. Her unmatched beauty grew even more resplendent, but that smile was unable to conceal the dense killing intent in her eyes.

“You can call me big sister. The title ‘Sovereign’ makes us feel like strangers.” Sovereign Han Wei arrived in front of Long Chen. Being just a few feet apart, Long Chen could even smell her fragrance.

Sovereign Han Wei was about the same height as him, and she looked into his eyes. At this distance, Long Chen felt his heart pounding wildly. For some reason, he blushed.

“Hahaha!” Sovereign Han Wei suddenly laughed. Her laughter was bewitching. “Junior brother, you’ve sparked my interest. You’re actually shy? In both lives, you’re the first man to be shy in front of me.”

Long Chen grew even more embarrassed. “Sovereign Han Wei’s beauty is unmatched. Junior brother is completely won by your charisma. It’s very normal.”

Sovereign Han Wei shook her head. “It’s not normal at all. You are the first. Fuck, I was even starting to question whether or not I was a woman.”

“Ah?”

Long Chen’s jaw dropped, turning to stone. Even a Sovereign would curse like this? Was this just a fake?
