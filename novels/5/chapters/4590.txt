Chapter 4579 Awakening

When Long Chen arrived at the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, he was shocked to find so many people in this enormous place.

A giant dragon scale hovered in the air, radiating a sparkling white light that illuminated every corner of the nest.

As this light washed over Long Chen, he immediately felt a sense of relaxation wash over him. The dragon blood energy within him seemed to respond to a silent call, stirring awake and starting to circulate automatically.

“What’s going on?”

Was this not the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest? Why were there dragon experts from so many different races here?

The enormous hall was packed with people to the extent that Long Chen and his companions found it impossible to navigate through the crowd.

“Don’t worry. They’re here to receive the ancestral scale’s sacred light baptism. Although they’re not from the white dragon race, the sacred light is extremely beneficial to anyone from the dragon race. Hmm, quite a few of them seemed injured from trying to commune with their own ancestral scale. The sacred light can also help them recover faster,” explained Bai Yingxue.

Bai Yingxue and the others didn’t seem surprised at all. The white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest had always been revered as a sacred site for recovery within the dragon cemetery.

“Please make a path!”

When the white dragon race’s experts arrived, some people respectfully made way for them. But a lot of experts just remained where they were as if they didn’t see Bai Yingxue and the others.

The white dragon race’s experts felt irritation bubbling within them. This territory belonged to the white dragon race, so they couldn’t fathom why some idiots failed to recognize the distinction between the hosts and the guests.

“Why should we clear a path? Your white dragon race hasn’t produced anyone capable of forming a resonance with this ancestral scale. Stop making a fuss. You should leave this space for people who need to heal and undergo baptism,” retorted one arrogant expert darkly.

“You...!” The experts of the white dragon race seethed with anger. They had waited countless years to enter this place, all in pursuit of obtaining that ancestral scale. And this person dared to say that they would definitely fail? That was practically a bloody curse. Even the good-tempered individuals from the esteemed white dragon race found it difficult to swallow such words.

“Get out of the way!”

Long Chen himself couldn’t be bothered to waste more words, so he reached out a hand.

“You dare? You must be courting death!” The arrogant expert snorted and launched a fist toward Long Chen. Although he found it odd that the white dragon race would have a strange human in their ranks, upon sensing Long Chen’s feeble aura, he placed him in no regard.

As the fist neared Long Chen’s face, Long Chen’s hand swiftly moved. Despite reacting second, Long Chen’s hand flawlessly intercepted the expert’s wrist.

“You...!”

The moment Long Chen caught his wrist, this arrogant expert’s expression completely changed. Long Chen’s fingers were like an iron vice that would crush his wrist. Just as he was about to struggle, he suddenly found himself floating in the air. Countless startled cries rang out as Long Chen suddenly smashed him into the ground.

BOOM!

With his immense power, Long Chen directly flattened the other party.

After spitting out blood, the arrogant expert lost consciousness. Long Chen’s immense strength played a significant role, but the hardness of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest also contributed to the outcome, as it was comparable to that of a Saint item.

Long Chen waved his hand, sending the arrogant expert flying like a kite in a powerful gust. Hurtling into the distance, the expert collided with the wall and remained stuck there, akin to a humanoid painting.

Countless people jumped in fright because the person fighting just now was not weak. However, he couldn’t withstand a single attack from Long Chen.

At this moment, there was no need for the white dragon race to say anything. The people in front of them instantly opened a path for them, and no one dared to be the slightest bit rude.

Seeing this scene, the white dragon race’s experts felt a deep sense of satisfaction. What had their kindness earned them? Would others behave similarly if the situation were reversed within the Ten Thousand Dragon Nests of others?

They had long since wanted to teach a lesson to these ungrateful people, but they were restrained by the ancestral teachings of the white dragon race.

“Who are you?” A powerful member of the dragon race approached as Long Chen led the way. His aura resembled the vast sea, indicating that he was at least a six-star Heavenly Doyen.

Without hesitation, Long Chen swiftly responded with a slap to the face as soon as the question was asked. Caught off guard at such close range, the individual was sent flying.

As he tumbled away, chaos erupted among the countless experts who scrambled to get out of the way.

“Am I your daddy? Why do I need to answer your questions? This place is the white dragon race’s territory. If you could come here, then I can too. Anyone who disagrees, please step forward. I’ll teach you how to act as dragons,” declared Long Chen disdainfully.

Ever since arriving here, Long Chen had been feeling the white dragon race’s ancestral scale calling out to him. As the white dragon race’s experts were too kind, he decided to save some time by using violence.

“Courting death!”

The slapped dragon expert clearly possessed some prestige, as tens of thousands of dragon experts stepped forward simultaneously.

“If you want to die, I don’t mind starting a slaughter in front of the white dragon race.” Long Chen snorted, and in front of their furious gazes, he went straight for the white dragon race’s ancestral scale.

“Stop!” shouted the slapped expert, halting the impending attack. The experts who had been prepared to attack Long Chen paused, bewildered. Why would their young master want them to stop?

Unbeknownst to them, Long Chen had revealed his power with that slap. The dragon expert’s soul trembled under the impact. As he had experienced true bloody battles, his sense of danger was sharp.

His senses warned him not to provoke this seemingly weak black-robed man, so he howled at his subordinates to stop.

It was fortunate that he did so, otherwise, they would all die today. Long Chen’s patience had worn thin, so anyone who dared to obstruct him would meet their maker.

Observing the expert’s apparent submission to Long Chen, the others were taken aback. Hastily, they cleared a wide path for Long Chen to proceed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bai Yingxue followed Long Chen forward, sighing inwardly. If the white dragon race wasn’t renowned for their benevolence, would they face such challenges from others?

Long Chen continued straight toward the white dragon scale. Eventually, they reached a boundary point, and all the various dragon experts were unable to get closer to it.

They could sense the gentle divine light of baptism in this area. However, one step forward would transform it from a baptism into a trial.

It served as a warning line; crossing it would unleash the gentle divine light’s latent power, turning it into an overwhelming divine pressure. For those not of the white dragon race, this pressure would be exponentially greater.

Furthermore, even if they could endure it, it was meaningless as they would never be able to reach the spot right below the dragon scale. Even if they did, it would be in vain, as no one—not even from the white dragon race—had ever succeeded in forming a resonance with this ancestral scale.

When Long Chen stepped over this line, the sacred white light quivered, and the white ancestral scale started to stay. After that, in front of countless shocked gazes, one rune after another appeared on its surface.

“The ancestral scale has been awakened?” Bai Yingxue exclaimed, her heart filled with both delight and disbelief. She covered her mouth, trembling with emotion.
