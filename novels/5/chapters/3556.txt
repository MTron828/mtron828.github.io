Chapter 3545

The True Fire Sword rumbled in Huo Linger’s hand, and thirty percent of its runes lit up.

Once they lit up, terrifying divine might raged, causing heaven and earth to change color. A sharp light also shot out and left faint cracks in the void. This sword was capable of piercing the heavens.

“Big brother Long Chen, this is my limit. I can only activate this many runes,” said Huo Linger.

“That’s enough. To activate thirty percent of the power of a World Domain divine item, you’re definitely amazing. Did you see when Zhao Mingxuan and the others attacked? Only a tenth of their World Domain divine items’ runes lit up. Hehe, starting today, you are my strongest helper.” Long Chen laughed delightedly, rubbing Huo Linger’s red hair.

During the past few days, Long Chen had helped Huo Linger refine the power of the Heavenly Flame Spirits. Her current aura was now almost on par with a fifth Heavenstage World King.

Furthermore, with the True Fire Sword in her hand, she could unleash even greater power. This was Long Chen’s first time feeling just how satisfying it was to have such a powerful fighter by his side.

However, even after her power soared, she was still unable to absorb the essence of that two-winged vile dragon. Absorbing it was a very slow process. Even Long Chen couldn’t help with that.

With their current speed, fully refining the two-winged vile dragon’s essence would take years. Clearly, its essence was absolutely terrifying, and even the current Huo Linger was lacking a great deal.

However, the meat was already in their bowl. Long Chen wasn’t worried. It would be Huo Linger’s food sooner or later. Furthermore, those Heavenly Flame Crystals also had endless energy. It was simply that now wasn’t the time to absorb them yet.

That was because counting the days, there were only a few more days until the Heavenly Flame World would close. He had to quickly search the other regions.

The meat could be slowly eaten, but prey still needed to be caught before it was his. Long Chen rushed off in another direction.

However, Long Chen was surprised to find that even after searching for almost half a day, he barely saw any Heavenly Flame Spirits. He saw the scars left behind by other lifeforms but not their actual forms.

Suddenly, after sensing powerful flame fluctuations in one direction, Long Chen flew off. The flame fluctuations also grew stronger and stronger.

“That’s the aura of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame!” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed and he quickened the pace.

He quickly saw a world that had sunk from a battle. The earth was torn asunder, and there were still holes remaining in the heavens that had yet to heal.

Rainbow runes continued to fly throughout the earth and sky. That was clearly the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, but there was another insidious power fighting it.

“Yan Xu!”

Sensing that insidious energy, Long Chen’s killing intent exploded. He instantly recognized that aura, one that had been carved into his bones.

Back in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue was destroyed by Lord Brahma’s followers. Long Chen then watched as the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was devoured by Yan Xu. He would never be able to forget that image in this lifetime.

“It’s already chased to here? Qingxuan is in danger!”

Long Chen instantly thought that Yan Xu had come here precisely for Yu Qingxuan.

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy said that every generation of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was a seed born from destiny. Only after one fell would another be born. Only the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was an exception.

If Yan Xu devoured Yu Qingxuan, it meant that another Heavenly Rainbow Flame would be born.

Although the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy hadn’t told Long Chen too much, he guessed that Yan Xu was very likely treating the Heavenly Rainbow Flame as chives, chopping them off segment by segment and consuming them as more grew out. It had devoured the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, and now it wanted to devour Yu Qingxuan.

“Bastard!”

Long Chen roared. The only thing that gave Long Chen a bit of comfort was that the battlefield’s flames were raging, but there was not the aura of the war chariot. Yu Qingxuan still hadn’t been forced to the point of needing her full power.

This battle had been fought around three days ago. But for the holes in the void to not heal even after three days, Long Chen finally had an estimation of Yu Qingxuan’s true power.

Long Chen quickly appraised the battlefield. Based on his combat experience, he guessed that Yu Qingxuan was sneak attacked, but she was strong enough to break free from the other side’s blockade and escape. Moreover, the scars on the battlefield weren’t disorderly. They had only exchanged at most three blows.

Clearly, being caught off-guard, Yu Qingxuan had been at a disadvantage and hadn’t wanted to stick around. Thus, she directly left.

Long Chen sensed the auras left behind in the air. That evil aura was definitely Yan Xu’s, but the pressure seemed to be a bit off.

Long Chen had personally seen Yan Xu. Even if it was through the endless void and space, Long Chen had sensed that apocalyptic power.

Hence, he was unable to figure out what was off. Transforming into a Lightning Falcon, he spread his wings and flew off. He had to quickly find Yu Qingxuan.

Flame energy was everywhere, and there were also many Heavenly Flame Spirits. When a person reached this place, their aura would gradually be covered up by the flame energy. As there was no way to track someone by aura, Long Chen could only blindly search around.

Like a headless fly, Long Chen flew around. He quickly found four humans fighting a second Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit.

The next instant, a black figure descended from the sky and instantly blasted apart the Heavenly Flame Spirit, shocking the four of them. The Heavenly Flame Spirit was killed before they even knew what was happening. Long Chen appeared in front of them. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Upon seeing him, their expressions completely changed. They thought that Long Chen was not just going to kill the Heavenly Flame Spirit but also them for their wealth.

“Please, don’t kill us!” pleaded the one woman amongst the four of them.

The four of them were very average. Otherwise, it wouldn’t take all of them to fight a second Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit.

Long Chen waved his hand. The flame runes were compressed into a flame sphere, and he tossed it toward them.

“I have a question. Has anything happened lately? Why can’t I see anyone around?” asked Long Chen.

Seeing that Long Chen wasn’t stealing their treasures and actually helped them kill that Heavenly Flame Spirit, they relaxed a great deal.

“To answer senior apprentice-brother’s question, the rumor is that some peerless expert appeared and fought with fairy Qingxuan. They fought all the way to the edge of the whirlpool, and that caused a huge amount of the Heavenly Flame World’s core energy to leak. The powerful people have all gone there. With the core energy of the Heavenly Flame World unleashed, countless experts are fighting over it. Powerful Heavenly Flame Spirits have also appeared. We want to go too, but those Heavenly Flame Spirits are too powerful. Even the weakest ones are at the third Heavenstage, and there are so many of them. We don’t dare to go. Only those powerful heavenly geniuses dare to get a cup of soup there,” explained one of them.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Yan Xu had truly locked onto Yu Qingxuan. This would be a battle to the death.

Fortunately, the four of them knew where it was and pointed Long Chen in the right direction. Long Chen instantly transformed into a streak of light piercing through the air.

“Qingxuan, hold on! I’m coming!”

Killing intent exploded out of Long Chen’s eyes. Yan Xu, Boss Long San will go all-out against you today!
