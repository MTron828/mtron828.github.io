Chapter 3330 Bloodily Fighting All Sides

This lightning maiden was Lei Linger. She had always been waiting behind Long Chen as his lightning wings.

Just then, when Long Chen attacked Tian Mo, she silently merged herself into the void.

Mo Yan’s entire focus had been on Long Chen. Moreover, the intense sensation of terror had come from the front, so Mo Yan hadn’t expected Lei Linger to attack him from behind.

He didn’t know that with Long Chen having activated the runes of his bone saber, even if Mo Yan wasn’t killed by Lei Linger, he would still die when he ran into Long Chen.

Mo Yan’s body then exploded. Under that black lightning, his soul was extinguished. Now, following Tian Mo’s death, Mo Yan also perished.

Right now, Long Chen stepped forward, directly facing those oncoming experts. As his saber slashed down, another Split the Heavens was coming.

“No!”

His saber was pointed toward a certain person. This was one of the few human experts amongst them.

When Long Chen’s saber locked onto him, he suddenly realized what true terror was. No one around him helped him.

That person then exploded. As for his King item, it flew out of his grasp and into the distance.

Long Chen got out of the blood mist. He was covered in blood, a mix of his and others’ blood. Like a divine bird spreading its wings, he shot toward the other human expert.

“Long Chen, we’re both members of the human race! Why don’t you kill the others first? Why must you target me?!” shouted that expert in terror as he fled.

“The others are enemies of the human race. If they killed me, there would be nothing for me to say. But you join forces with them. That is a betrayal to the human race. If I didn’t kill a traitor like you, who would I kill?”

Long Chen roared, his saber once more slashing down. It was another blow of Split the Heavens. That expert blocked with all his power, but he was unable to stop the power of Split the Heavens. So, he was blasted apart.

Everyone was stunned by this. Long Chen was wildly violent. He was unleashing such terrifying attacks one after another? Was he really human?

“Didn’t you want to kill me? Since you don’t dare to make your move, allow me.”

Long Chen’s gaze was sinister, as if he was possessed by a fiend. Just looking at him made people shiver.

Long Chen had taken the initiative to charge at those experts. They were now terrified. They saw that the current Long Chen was practically a madman, killing anyone he caught.

Although his aura was plummeting as a result, there was practically no way for them to stop his Split the Heavens. Hence, they fled in every direction, terrified.

“Everyone, scatter! He’s on his last legs! He’ll run out of power after just a bit more! At that time- wait, no!”

One of those experts was shouting, only to end up drawing Long Chen’s attention and being killed by a slash of his saber. After that, that expert’s saber was about to flee when it was grabbed by Long Chen and tossed into the primal chaos space.

“AHH!”

Suddenly, a shocked cry rang out. Another expert had a flame spear piercing through his chest. Behind him was a flame maiden. Just as he was dodging Long Chen, he was struck by Huo Linger.

Huo Linger and Lei Linger had joined the battle. They were two pretty maidens but also life-reaping killers. They possessed undying bodies and didn’t emit the auras of humans or other races. It was difficult for others to track them. Lei Linger in particular struck like lightning, so fast that others couldn’t even see her.

Most terrifying of all, with them present on the battlefield, Long Chen became the absolute greatest threat. Anyone he turned his attention to died.

“Ahh!”

Long Chen was hunting down those terrifying lifeforms within the barrier. Although his aura was dropping, with Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s assistance, they were cut down one by one, either by Long Chen’s hands or by Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s hands.

One expert blasted apart Huo Linger, but she simply reformed herself out of the flame runes in the sky. This scene made the others despair.

The inside of this barrier was essentially a flame element domain, so Huo Linger was unmatched here. Any energy she used up was quickly restored.

Her flame spear clashed with Kun Wu, and then she simply exploded. As a result, Kun Wu was left hacking up blood, injured by this detonation.

Just as he was injured, a lightning sword slashed down. He hastily dodged, resulting in his wings being cut off.

Lei Linger’s lightning sword was incomparably sharp. It contained the destructive power of heavenly tribulation. When she was going all-out, even Kun Wu’s physical body was unable to endure it.

Just as Kun Wu started to panic and tried to escape the two of them, Long Chen killed his third target.

These were all supreme experts, but they appeared incredibly weak in front of Long Chen.

The current Long Chen was the embodiment of a killing god. When he turned his gaze to someone, he would launch a killing blow.

Even as he was injured more and more from his enemies’ death throes, with even his chest pierced by a sharp blade, he still continued to fight. His ruthlessness made people shiver.

The thing that made them despair the most was that no matter how grave his wound was, it would rapidly heal. It was as if he possessed an undying body.

Long Chen was struck by his opponent’s sword, while Long Chen’s saber struck the opponent’s body. The sword landed on Long Chen’s waist, cutting him in two. But Long Chen’s saber directly made his opponent’s body explode. Exchanging an injury for a life, Long Chen was unstoppable.

Long Chen then tossed his opponent’s sword into the primal chaos space. Inside, the Wood Foundation Divine Trees were still as vibrant as ever. There was no sign of them withering. Hence, Long Chen felt no fear when it came to being injured.

It was due to this that he chose to use the simplest, most brutal, and most effective method to fight these people.

Under the effect of the Golden Dragon Battle Armor, no one was capable of killing him in one blow. As long as he didn’t die, his target would definitely die. Thus, this method of exchanging injury to strike his opponent appeared brutal, but Long Chen wasn’t in any real danger.

However, the spectators were all grimacing at this sight. Long Chen was ferocious, frighteningly so.

Currently, only seven of these terrifying experts remained. They were all fleeing from Long Chen.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, all these experts also saw that Long Chen’s aura was plummeting as he fought. He definitely couldn’t last much longer. Right now, whoever could endure the longest would definitely win. This was the true critical moment.

If they lost their cool and directly fled back into their spatial gates, then the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would truly fall into Long Chen’s hands.

Perhaps in the next second, Long Chen would collapse. Hence, right now, they were gambling with their lives, while they knew that Long Chen was gambling with his. It was a competition of who would last longer. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame was too important, so no one was willing to give up on it.

“This fool, why isn’t he letting me fight yet?!”

Bai Shishi clenched the hilt of her sword, her palm sweaty. From the start, Long Chen had not given her the signal to attack. She didn’t dare to rashly interfere, but she was starting to panic. She even thought that Long Chen might have forgotten about her.

However, she also knew that Long Chen wasn’t calling on her despite fighting like this because he was counting on her to save him when the time came. Long Chen had essentially entrusted his life to her, so she didn’t dare to make any rash decisions.

Suddenly, the entire barrier shuddered. It instantly shrank.

“Time’s up! Long Chen still hasn’t finished the process!”

The Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts were flabbergasted. After that, they saw an endless tide of strange lifeforms on the other side of the spatial gates. They came out in droves.

“Heavens, have the enemy worlds started their invasion?!” Seeing this endless tide of experts, everyone was alarmed.

“Warriors of the human race, prepare for battle!” shouted an Immortal King.
