Chapter 4400 Doyen

Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword dragged across the ground, its tip slicing through the bricks like they were tofu.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Little Crane stood on Bally, following closely behind Long Chen. Her pure face displayed no fear but rather excitement.

As for the spherical lifeform following behind Long Chen, it intentionally let off a golden glow from its scales to show off.

It was once enraged at being crushed by Long Chen, but it was different now. Finally, it understood just how powerful these two people were.

“This is the devil race’s territory. Scram!”

When Long Chen stepped through the city gate, an angry shout rang out. This region bore the devil race's marker as the present Silver Moon City had been divided among various large factions.

“The devil race’s territory? What a joke. Silver Moon City has always been the domain of the human race. Since when did it become your devil race’s territory?” sneered Long Chen.

“You will die if you get any closer.” An expert gave him another warning.

However, Long Chen ignored it and continued walking forward.

Buzz.

The next moment, devil qi erupted, and a devil sword slashed toward Long Chen.

In response, Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword swung through the air, blasting the attacker apart. Not only was that expert slain, but the force of the attack continued toward the region behind him.

“Courting death!”

Suddenly, a roar backed by Eternal Qi erupted, and a fist shattered Long Chen’s Sword Qi.

A sinister-looking devil expert with long hair then appeared right in front of Long Chen and unleashed a claw.

At the same time, powerful Eternal Qi crashed down, shaking all of Silver Moon City. The experts inside the city were shocked. Silver Moon City probably wouldn’t be able to endure such power.

BANG!

Long Chen unleashed his own claw in response. A devil claw and dragon claw then clashed, producing a huge explosive sound.

To everyone’s surprise, this black-robed World King directly intercepted the attack of an Eternal expert from the devil race.

With his left hand blocking the assault, Long Chen's Seven Peak Sword in his right hand swung out, severing the Eternal expert's arm.

“What?!” Countless experts inside the city cried out in shock.

“How kind. You actually know to hold back. Are you afraid of damaging your own businesses?” Long Chen waved his hand, sending the severed arm into the primal chaos space.

This was a true Eternal expert, one whose flesh possessed Eternal power, making it the best fertilizer for the black soil.

Surprisingly, this devil expert refused to employ his full power and even withdrew a portion of his strength after attacking, a move equivalent to inviting death upon himself.

“Bastard, die!”

The Eternal expert was enraged, realizing that he had underestimated the young man in front of him. No longer holding back, he summoned his manifestation.

Devil qi erupted, sending ripples throughout Silver Moon City. In an instant, many buildings shattered, and the people inside were blown away by the astral winds.

The next moment, a long rod appeared in the Eternal expert’s hand. Having taken out his Eternal divine weapon, he swung it at Long Chen.

The Eternal expert no longer had any misgivings, and all he was thinking about was crushing the little human in front of him.

Countless people fled in terror, afraid of being crushed by his Eternal power.

Facing this onslaught, Long Chen remained calm, showing no signs of panic. Without dodging, he raised his left hand, and seven-color divine radiance flowed into the form of a large shield.

BOOM!

When the devil expert's attack collided with Long Chen's shield, it triggered a massive explosion, flattening Silver Moon City in an instant.

It seemed as if the entire world was being torn apart. However, Long Chen stood firm like a boulder. Behind him, Little Crane and Bally remained completely unharmed; the Eternal devil qi couldn't inflict the slightest harm upon them

“What?!”

The eyes of the devil expert almost popped out, staring at Long Chen in disbelief.

“You can’t even deal with a little human? It looks like we’ll need to help you.”

Suddenly, space twisted, and two more figures emerged—also Eternal experts emanating the aura of the devil race

However, they had two horns on their heads, indicating that, though part of the devil race, they belonged to a different branch.

The two of them then pressed their hands on the first Eternal expert’s back, channeling Eternal energy through his body.

With all three of them working together, their power soared, and devil qi exploded throughout this world.

However, people saw an unbelievable scene. No matter how the three of them unleashed their Eternal power, they were unable to shake Long Chen’s seven-color shield.

Long Chen was also slightly surprised. In this state, while he had broken through to the first Heavenstage, he didn’t have the support of the Seven Star Battle Armor, the Dragon King Battle Armor, or even his divine ring. However, he was able to block the combined power of three Eternal experts.

It had to be known that back in the Great Desolate World and the humanless world, he couldn’t do this just by relying on the power of his seven-color Supreme Blood. However, he was able to do it today.

Long Chen hadn’t expected his power to increase so immensely. This first Heavenstage wasn't merely a realm increase; it appeared that his understanding of his own power had reached a deeper level.

“He blocked it?!”

Countless experts stood dumbfounded at the sight. A World King was actually fending off the combined power of three Eternal experts. Just what kind of monster was he?

“This human can’t be left alive! Kill him together! He might become a Heavenly Doyen in the future!”

No one knew who shouted this, but dozens of Eternal experts suddenly charged over from every direction.

“Heavenly Doyen?”

This term was unfamiliar to most, but when it came from the mouth of that Eternal expert, they recognized the nervousness and even fear in his voice.

Dozens of Eternal experts immediately launched a full-on attack, forgoing any probing blows. They summoned their manifestations without holding back.

They no longer cared about the one-on-one battle etiquette, or that they were bullying a junior. They directly took out their weapons, and dozens of attacks shot toward Long Chen.

The three Eternal experts engaged in battle with Long Chen let out furious roars as these attacks enveloped them. It was a collective assault, aimed at eliminating the trio along with Long Chen.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

Just as these attacks were about to strike Long Chen, Long Chen’s divine ring appeared behind him. A sea of stars flowed, and an unmatched divine might erupted.
