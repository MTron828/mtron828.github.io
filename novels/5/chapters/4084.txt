Chapter 4073 Pursuit of the Ye Clan

BOOM!

Long Chen and the others had just left when the void erupted and three figures emerged at once, all of them wearing the robes of the Ye clan. One of them was the Heaven Venerate that had escaped back then.

“Bastard! Where did they go?!” roared that Heaven Venerate.

“Reporting, those interlopers just left in that direction!” pointed the elder who had been questioned by Long Chen.

“Idiot, how useless are you?! Why didn’t you stop them?!” roared the Heaven Venerate.

At this moment, his aura was still weak. Uncle Tree’s attack had clearly given him a serious wound that he could not recover from in just a short time.

Hearing this reprimand, that Earth Venerate immediately lowered his head and didn’t dare to make a sound. Inside, he cursed that Heaven Venerate. “If even you couldn’t stop him, how could I?”

However, he didn’t dare to stand up to this person, afraid of being killed with a slap, so he could only endure.

“Did he say anything?” demanded one of the other two that the fleeing Heaven Venerate had brought. These two were also Heaven Venerates.

“He did say something, but this lowly one doesn’t dare to repeat it,” said the elder.

“Speak!” roared the Heaven Venerate.

“He said, ‘Help me tell them that I don’t care about them being an Eternal clan or being part of the Heavenly Divinity race. Don’t provoke me. If Boss Long San gets angry, the consequences will be very severe for you all.’”

BAM!

Upon hearing this statement, the injured Heaven Venerate directly slapped that elder flying. “Fuck, this brat really is arrogant! If I let you escape my grasp today, I’ll change my family name to yours!”

That pitiful elder had only repeated Long Chen’s words, but he was slapped unconscious. When he woke up, he would probably curse that Heaven Venerate’s entire family.

“Hmph, what an arrogant brat. Since he didn’t report his name, killing him won’t cause any big waves. Let’s go. Once we catch up, we’ll find out just whose family’s brat dares to be so arrogant,” snorted one of the other Heaven Venerates.

In an instant, the three of them vanished from sight.

…

The flying boat whistled away, instantly crossing thousands of miles. Long Chen and the others had left the shore, going deeper inland.

“Boss, why are we running? With Uncle Tree here, we can kill as many of them as they come. There’s no need for such courtesy for these bastards!” Guo Ran couldn’t help complaining.

“They have more people there, and that is their battleground. That means they have a channel that can provide an endless supply of experts. Also, the Nirvana Overflow Heaven is not the Violet Flame Heaven. The Ye clan is an Eternal clan, a part of the Heavenly Divinity race, so their foundation is definitely shocking. There’s no need for us to fight them directly. Furthermore, if we are to be enemies with them, we’ll need to be smarter about it,” said Long Chen. He suddenly asked, “Did you not feel like the Ye clan’s experts were a bit familiar?”

“Now that you say it, they do seem a bit familiar. It’s like we’ve seen them before,” said Guo Ran after a moment’s hesitation.

“That’s right. Their auras are familiar,” said a Dragonblood warrior.

Xia Chen slapped his leg. “Boss, the Ye family was one of the four divine families on the Martial Heaven Continent!”

When Xia Chen said this, everyone suddenly realized why they seemed familiar. Guo Ran exclaimed, “Yes, yes! Their auras are similar to the Ye family! That Ye Wenxuan’s irritating face, the way that the damn ghost Ye Liangchen spoke, they all seem similar!”

“Was the Martial Heaven Continent’s Ye family a branch of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s Heavenly Divinity race?” Xia Chen found it a bit inconceivable.

“Then what about the rest of the four divine families? It was the Long, Zhao, Ye, and Jiang families back then. Are they all part of the Heavenly Divinity race? Then doesn’t that mean that boss is also a member of the Heavenly Divinity race!?” Guo Ran looked at Long Chen in disbelief.

Long Chen also sank into thought. Back in the Divine Dao Pavilion, Long Chen had flipped through countless tomes and had read about the mentions of Eternal clans and the Heavenly Divinity race. However, when he flipped through the directory, he found that many tomes were missing, ones that seemed to relate to them. And when Long Chen asked about it, he was told that the dean had taken away a portion of those tomes. As for why, no one knew.

Now that Long Chen thought back on it, given the High Firmament Academy’s foundation, they definitely had to have a deeper understanding of the Heavenly Divinity race, so they must have intentionally kept this information from him.

“Could it be that the dean knows about my origins?” wondered Long Chen suddenly.

Although Long Chen was now an Immortal King, when he thought back to dean Bai Letian’s aura, he still felt like the latter’s cultivation base was like a vast sea. There was no chance that he was really just an Immortal King. That air around him was something that not even Heaven Venerates could reach.

At the same time, Long Chen thought of the sweeping elder. His pair of turbid eyes seemed to have long since seen through everything.

“Could it be that the Long, Zhao, Ye, and Jiang families are part of the Heavenly Divinity race? But then why would they stay in the mortal world? What is their goal?” Long Chen couldn’t figure it out. Could it be that this was related to some unspeakable secret?Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

If it really was the case, then this matter was not as simple as it seemed. Long Chen smelled a scheme.

“Master, they’re chasing us.” Suddenly, Uncle Tree’s voice interrupted Long Chen’s thoughts.

“Uncle Tree, how many of them are there?” asked Long Chen.

“Three. One of them is the fish that escaped.”

“Uncle Tree, leave that fish to me. Can you handle the remaining two?” asked Long Chen.

“If I am prepared, I should be fine one against three! There’s no need for master to take that risk. If you were to be hurt, I would never be able to make up for it,” said Uncle Tree hastily.

It had to be known that the enemy was a Heaven Venerate, so even when injured, he wasn’t something that a group of Immortal Kings could handle. If Long Chen were to be killed by him, Uncle Tree’s conscience wouldn’t be able to take it.

After all, it was Long Chen who had freed him. If Long Chen then died under his protection, he would be guilt-ridden for the rest of his life.

“Uncle Tree, don’t worry. I won’t do anything that I’m not confident in. We’ve just arrived in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven and still have the aura of the Violet Flame Heaven on us. If we want to adapt to these Heavenly Daos as quickly as possible, a big battle is the best option. We will force the laws of heaven and earth to change our auras. Coincidentally, a Heaven Venerate is one with heaven and earth, so we can borrow his power to change our auras. That way, we won’t be instantly recognized as foreigners, and we will have an easier time traveling here,” said Long Chen.

“Then be careful. Don’t force yourself too hard.” Uncle Tree could only hope that Long Chen was as powerful as he thought.

…

As the void rumbled, three figures tore through space, giving off heaven-shaking auras and twisting killing intent.

This place was an empty land surrounded by a mountain range. After following the tracking seal to this area, the three Heaven Venerate experts of the Ye clan came to a sudden stop.

“Stop hiding! Come out and face your death!”

The Heaven Venerate that Uncle Tree had injured roared. He knew that Long Chen and the others were nearby.

“Are you blind? Couldn’t you see our giant group yourself? Just who is hiding?”

Long Chen looked at them disdainfully from atop a mountain, not hiding at all. Actually, they were standing there completely openly, but alas, this idiot just had crap instead of eyes.

“Die!”

Upon spotting them, the fury of that Heaven Venerate exploded, and he shot straight toward Long Chen.
