Chapter 2162 Everything Hangs by a Thread

Beitang Rushuang had displayed shocking power in her fury, almost killing Shi Lingfeng in one blow.

Dongfang Yuyang seemed to have an urge to stop her, but Beitang Rushuang was resolute, and Nangong Zuiyue was standing with her, hinting at her own position.

Hence, they could only watch as Beitang Rushuang left. Once she vanished, Shi Lingfeng looked at his wound and clenched his teeth. “Damnable woman, just wait. I’ll make you regret this.”

The unconscious Yue Zifeng had been brought away by Beitang Rushuang. The battle was over. Although Yue Zifeng had been forced to the brink at the end, it didn’t affect his position in people’s hearts. He had been classified by the supreme geniuses as an apex expert.

That Jian Wuchen had ended up being controlled by the Sword Devil Ghost Slaughterer who had used a peerless killing move, only to be killed by Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng’s fighting style had shown them the pride of a true sword cultivator. Compared to the wild Jian Wuchen, Yue Zifeng better fit their personal impressions of a sword cultivator.

Perhaps in this world, only the Heavenly Sword Gate could raise such a proud genius of the Sword Dao. The Heavenly Sword Gate would forever be the sacred land for sword cultivators.

Slowly, the people surrounding the End of the Heavens Valley scattered. However, some stayed behind to closely examine the new scars left in this place, attempting to comprehend the leftover wills from the battle.

There were a few questions in people’s minds. If the Bloodkill Hall wanted to kill Yue Zifeng, why hadn’t their divine daughter, Dong Mingyu, been the one to attack? In that situation, there would have been no way that Long Chen could have saved Yue Zifeng.

The other thing was, why was it that Long Chen and Mo Nian had rushed away so urgently? Also, people had assumed that they were going together, but then they had clearly been going in different directions.

...

After using the Double Dragon Destruction to break out of the blockade of those geniuses from the ancient era, Long Chen had obtained a chance to use the Celestial Lightning Body Blink to get away.

However, the fact that he could blow them away and kill a few didn’t make him happy. He knew that those who had blocked him weren’t the strongest of those geniuses.

The reason they had been able to dominate a generation was because they hadn’t had any strong opponents. Compared to Dongfang Yuyang, Ximen Tianxiong, and the like, they had inferior foundations, combat power, and intellect.

Despite that, Long Chen’s Double Dragon Destruction hadn’t been able to kill all of them even though he hadn’t been holding back.

He had summoned a sea of lighting before unleashing this attack in order to use the Celestial Lightning Body Blink to get away. Flying away, he found that after passing a certain range, a jade tablet on his waist began to rapidly flash. That was Xia Chen’s alarm system.

“Those bastards, they really did set everything up. The region around the End of the Heavens Valley was masked with some kind of power.”

Long Chen looked at the jade tablet. There were two different regions flashing, and they represented the Xuantian Dao Sect and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race respectively.

Those regions had formations set up personally by Xia Chen. When the alarms were triggered, Long Chen should have been immediately alerted. He hadn’t expected his enemies to have even calculated this into their schemes.

Long Chen flew into a city and saw many people surrounding it. His expression sank as those people weren’t defending the transportation formation. The transportation formation had been broken by someone, and they were in the midst of repairing it.

“All of you just wait for me.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen clenched his teeth, killing intent rolling out of him. His lightning wings flapped, and he directly flew to the Xuantian Dao Sect.

...

Within the Xuantian Dao Sect, the main mountain gates had been destroyed. Countless experts of the Corrupt path were attacking, and rivers of blood flowed as they fought the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples.

“Senior apprentice-sister Shiyu, we can’t hold on any longer!” shouted one of the disciples. He was covered in blood. He had just killed one of the Corrupt experts, but in exchange, his arm had been cut off.

Hua Shiyu, Wang Zhen, Su Mo, Mu Qingxuan, and the other top experts of the Xuantian Dao Sect were fighting against one of the opponents.

That opponent was Xie Luo. Xie Luo had summoned his manifestation and was leading the Corrupt path’s experts in their attack.

“Even if you can’t, you have to hold on! The Xuan Master and the patriarch have been tied down. Even if we have to die, we can’t let them advance!” shouted Hua Shiyu.

In the distant sky, the Xuantian Tower was clashing with a giant bone tower. The two towers were connected by opposing divine light.

The power from the two towers caused the world to suddenly dim and brighten randomly. Their terrifying power was suffocating.

Li Tianxuan and the patriarch were both standing atop the Xuantian Tower, their palms pressed together to control it. Both of their expressions were extremely grave.

On top of the bone tower they were facing was Tian Xiezi. “Who would have thought that a broken-down sect would actually have such a foundation? You’re actually able to endure the attack of the Corrupt God Ancient Tower. How unexpected.”

Li Tianxuan looked at Tian Xiezi. “Your attack this time is much more unexpected. I really can’t figure out the reason why you have to attack right before the qi flow eruption. Is taking losses yourself worth it?”

Li Tianxuan was truly unable to figure it out. This had come too suddenly, without any warning at all.

What had happened at the start was that some of the Corrupt path’s old monsters had come to attack, and so the patriarch had directly activated the Xuantian Tower to crush them.

However, as soon as he used the Xuantian Tower to attack, the hidden Xie Tianzi suddenly attacked. He took out the Corrupt path’s priceless treasure, the Corrupt God Ancient Tower. Legend had it that it was a remnant of the first generation Corrupt God and was laced with his soul essence, giving it endless power.

At that moment, Li Tianxuan immediately sensed that they had fallen into a trap. In the instant that the Xuantian Tower was tied down, powerful enemies appeared all around the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Several expert formation masters immediately attacked, destroying several formation nodes, reducing the power of the protective formations and cutting off any spatial channels.

This was a sneak attack that had been prepared well in advance. With the help of certain traitors within the sect, the grand formation was paralyzed.

The worst thing was that the Xuantian Tower was tied down. If it wasn’t, it could be used as the crux of the grand formation. Now though, it was impossible for them to use many functions, including the transportation formation to the Spirit World. Such a transportation required a powerful core, and the Xuantian Tower was that core.

Li Tianxuan’s heart was cold. It seemed that several of the high level experts in the Xuantian Dao Sect had been bought by others or had their souls controlled. Quite a few secrets of the Xuantian Dao Sect had been exposed.

Tian Xiezi smiled. “There’s nothing unexpected about it. The Xuantian Dao Sect has caused quite some damage to the Corrupt path, so destroying you will make us feel better. As for you, Li Tianxuan, you aren’t that powerful yourself, but you are one of the leaders of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Eliminating you is necessary. There’s also Long Chen who grew up in your Xuantian Dao Sect. He has killed countless experts of the Corrupt path, and he definitely won’t be happy when we destroy his home. You don’t need to hope for anyone to come to save you. The other major powers of the Martial Heaven Continent are also facing an attack, including the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. Although the other places are just feints, it’s enough to paralyze the Martial Heaven Alliance. By the time they realize, the Xuantian Dao Sect will no longer exist. As for Long Chen, the Pill Fairy is currently handling him, and there are also other supreme geniuses who want his life. Who knows if he’ll even be surviving beyond today.”

BOOM! BOOM!

Two more formations were broken within the sect, creating two openings in their defenses. Large groups of Corrupt experts sinisterly laughed and charged in.

Li Tianxuan took a deep breath. A pillar of light suddenly soared out of the Xuantian Dao Sect, illuminating the Xuantian Tower.

“Hmph, even if you ignite your karmic luck, it’s useless. The Corrupt God Ancient Tower has started accumulating karmic luck since the first generation Corrupt God. It’s not something a little Xuantian Dao Sect can block. Just obediently wait to be captured!” Tian Xiezi sneered and his hand seals changed. Countless figures began to appear on top of the bone tower, roaming around like specters. An evil air soared, and no matter how brilliantly the Xuantian Tower shone, it was unable to suppress the Corrupt God Ancient Tower.

“This is bad.” Li Tianxuan’s expression finally changed. Without being able to pull back the Xuantian Tower, there was no way to activate the core formation.

“It’s my fault. I fell for it.” The patriarch was ashamed. When the battle had first started, Li Tianxuan had been in seclusion. It was the patriarch who had directly used the Xuantian Tower to attack, falling for the enemy’s trap.

“Even I might have fallen for it. No one knows how anyone might react. I wouldn’t have let our disciples be killed either,” said Li Tianxuan. At that time, dozens of Netherpassage experts had suddenly appeared. If they didn’t use the Xuantian Tower to wipe them away, there would have been many casualties amongst the disciples.

“Then what can we do now?”

“We can only wait.”

“We won’t be able to hold on until the Martial Heaven Alliance’s reinforcements arrive.”

“No, I’m waiting for Long Chen.”

“Long Chen? Isn’t there a divine daughter delaying him? It’ll be hard enough for him to protect himself.”

“I believe Long Chen will definitely have a way.” Li Tianxuan was confident. All he could do was rest his hopes on Long Chen.

The moment he had noticed that Long Chen was a Heaven-Defier, Li Tianxuan’s fate had been bound together with Long Chen’s. That had been and still was his life’s greatest gamble.

“Hahahaha!” Seeing that light coming from the Xuantian Dao Sect, Xie Luo charged forward, stepping over the corpses of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples. “Once I destroy your divine pool, this world will no longer have a Xuantian Dao Sect!”

“No!”

“Stop!”

“Bastard, I’ll kill you!”

Hua Shiyu, Mu Qingxuan, Wang Zhen, Su Mo, and all the experts of the Xuantian Dao Sect went crazy. This was their home.

“The Xuantian Dao Sect is over!” Xie Luo threw his blood-colored spear mercilessly at the core of the light.

Just as the disciples were despairing, the spear came to a stop. It was firmly caught by a hand.
