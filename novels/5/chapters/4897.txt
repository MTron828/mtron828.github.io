Chapter 4886 Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe

“What?!”

Outside the barrier, countless experts were stunned. Just as Long Chen was blown back, Evilmoon flew out of his hand and slashed Huo Qianwu’s neck.

This move exceeded everyone’s expectations. While Huo Qianwu’s reaction speed was amazing, Long Chen’s bizarre attack was just way above it.

After all, Long Chen had just used Evilmoon to block Huo Qianwu’s attack. For him to suddenly be able to counterattack with it defied the common sense of the martial world. No one could fathom how he managed such a feat.

When Huo Qianwu spat out the blood arrow, her Doyen power surged like a flood. Yet, Evilmoon pierced through it and struck her. In front of countless shocked gazes, Evilmoon slashed Huo Qianwu’s neck, causing blood to splash around. Long Chen’s smile turned cold.

Just as he thought it was over, his smile froze.

Evilmoon slashed across Huo Qianwu’s neck, yet it failed to slice through completely. Instead, it left a cut about an inch deep, and beneath her skin, countless threads became visible.

Resembling lotus silk, these threads emanated Doyen power. Astonishingly, Evilmoon was unable to sever them. Long Chen couldn’t believe his eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although he knew that Heavenly Chosen was strong, he hadn’t expected one to be this abnormal. Even with Evilmoon’s sharpness, it couldn’t cut through Huo Qianwu’s bare neck.

“What is that?”

The experts outside were equally baffled. While they didn’t know Evilmoon’s origins, the fact that it could compete with the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip without sustaining damage showed that it had to be on par in terms of power.

The fact that such a formidable weapon couldn’t sever Huo Qianwu’s neck when it was exposed left them dumbfounded. This battle had already transcended the scope of their understanding. Despite their countless years of existence, they had never seen such a scene before.

“Those should be heavenly fate lines. Heavenly Chosens are blessed and protected by the heavens. Other than the Heavenly Daos, no one can kill them,” commented a Heaven Saint.

“It is the Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe. Rumor has it that when a Heavenly Chosen is born, the heavens bless them with a battle cloth to prevent them from dying young,” added another expert.

“Does that mean that Heavenly Chosens cannot be killed?”

The first Heaven Saint answered, “Not necessarily. It is said that the Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe can help them survive three calamities and six disasters. As for what those three calamities and six tribulations are, no one can say for sure. However, the majority of people assume that they can survive three deathly perils and six cultivation bottlenecks. After that, the Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe will vanish. None of us know how many times Huo Qianwu’s Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe has been used. If that was the last time...”

“Shut your mouth! Qianwu has never used the Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe before! Before today, we didn’t even know that it existed!” barked Jiang Yiban.

The Heaven Saint’s expression darkened at being chided, but because the other side was from the Flame Divine Hall, he kept his mouth shut. After all, he wasn’t Xing Wujiang; he didn’t dare to provoke such a mighty existence.

Amidst the hush, a voice suddenly broke the silence. “Heavenly Chosens do not possess an undying body. In this world, true immortality is nonexistent. If one’s power vastly surpasses the Heavenly Chosens, it’s possible to easily defeat them. However, such actions incur the wrath of heaven. On the other hand, when everyone is within the same realm, the slight power disparity makes it nearly impossible to crush Heavenly Chosens with absolute force, as they rely on the Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe as their life-saving talisman. Even so, this life-saving talisman can only protect her for a maximum of three times. If Long Chen cuts her neck two more times, this protective talisman will vanish.”

“City lord!”

The speaker was Xing Wujiang. Not caring about the Flame Divine Hall’s wrath, he simply said whatever he wanted to say.

Moreover, he was incredibly excited now. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to be unparalleled when it came to power, strategy, and experience—a perfect all-rounder. As a result, Xing Wujiang was no longer worried. He could tell that Long Chen’s power was not inferior to Huo Qianwu’s, or at least not by too much. In any case, when it came to mental strength and experience, she was a far cry from Long Chen. That point alone placed Long Chen in an unbeatable position.

The vice hall master sneered, “Even after living for so many years, you are still so naive. In a clash between experts, a slight difference in power can decide life and death. Qianwu has the Heavenly Fate Treasure Robe protecting her, while Long Chen will directly perish if he makes one mistake.”

Xing Wujiang had clearly spoken for the Flame Divine Hall to hear, so the vice hall master naturally had to counter him.

Xing Wujiang indifferently answered, “Huo Qianwu might be strong, but she is ultimately a flower grown in your Flame Divine Hall. My brother is different. He is a true expert tempered by a great deal of tribulations. Perhaps he doesn’t have as many treasures as Huo Qianwu, but his experience and wits are enough to make up for that.”

The vice hall master snorted, “Is that so? Then we’ll just see. Just how long can Long Chen burn his blood?”

The vice hall master’s sight was sharp. Although Long Chen’s dragon blood power shocked him, he also knew the shortcoming of igniting essence blood for power. Once Long Chen exhausted his essence blood, his power would plummet. There was no way to maintain this state for long. As long as Huo Qianwu managed to endure, the one to lose their life would ultimately be Long Chen.

The moment Evilmoon returned to Long Chen’s hand, his Blood Qi raged, and he attacked.

While Huo Qianwu wasn’t severely injured after being slashed in the neck, she was terrified, as well as enraged. As a result, she cowered. The Blaze Dragon Bone Whip danced before her, forming a shield formation.

When the vice hall master and Xing Wujiang saw this, both of them smiled. The vice hall master smiled because as long as Huo Qianwu was in no rush, she could just stall until Long Chen was exhausted. For him, defending was the right choice.

On the other hand, Xing Wujiang knew that Huo Qianwu was afraid, her sharpness deteriorating. In this state, she wouldn’t pose any threat to Long Chen at all.

Although Xing Wujiang didn’t understand Long Chen that deeply, he knew his brother’s character—his battle style was attack, attack, and attack, turning offense into defense. The minute he passively defended, it meant defeat.

Just then, Evilmoon collided with the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, and with a strange spinning slash, Long Chen somehow emerged behind Huo Qianwu, bringing Evilmoon down on her.

Seeing this scene, Huo Qianwu was startled. She hadn’t expected Long Chen’s mighty attack to actually be a feint, so she hastily turned around to defend. However, it turned out to be a feint again.

Long Chen repeatedly danced with Evilmoon, blinking toward Huo Qianwu’s blindspot, causing her to defend against phantom attacks. Suddenly, the vice hall master’s expression changed. He extended a finger and struck the barrier, creating a fist-sized opening.

“Qianwu, this is a linked attack! You have to interrupt him!” roared the vice hall master.

“Too late for that! Split the Heavens—Seven Forms in One!”

After unleashing six slashes, Long Chen launched a giant saber-image that tore through the world, merging all six slashes into a final, devastating attack aimed at the panicked Huo Qianwu.
