Chapter 4821 Astral Bone Claw

Mo Nian shot up the moment he saw Long Chen. The moment he finished speaking, he felt the world spinning around him, and he sat back down on his butt.

“Give it up. I practically lost half my life to save you. I don’t even know if this curse energy will affect my future cultivation,” grumbled Long Chen.

Mo Nian felt a wave of dizziness. He was extremely weak after being afflicted by the curse, and it took him a while before he recovered enough. Although his face was still rather yellow, there was a bright light in his eyes.

Mo Nian grabbed Long Chen’s arm firmly. “My good brother, I’m not lying. I’ve found a shocking treasure land, and there are definitely shocking secrets inside. If we can excavate that place, we’ll really be rich. Do you know why I was willing to be cursed just to enter that place?”

“Why?”

“Take a look.”

Mo Nian produced a particular object—a bone claw comprising a hand and forearm, its bones as white as jade with specks of starlight shimmering upon it. Long Chen's astral energy immediately surged with excitement at the sight. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“This is...”

Long Chen was shocked. This had to be the bone of a nine star heir, as the palm had an eight star diagram on it. Even in this state, it possessed the power to destroy the ten thousand Daos.

“It was for this that I let myself be cursed. Working yourself to death to save me wasn’t in vain, right?” chortled Mo Nian.

“You’re right, you’re absolutely right!” Long Chen held the bone claw, sensing the astral energy flowing inside of it. He was incredibly excited.

The bone claw seemed to sense Long Chen as well. Its stars flowed, forming a resonance with Long Chen’s astral energy.

“This is the arm of a Heaven Saint nine star heir. If you refine it, it will definitely be a treasure to you,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen nodded. In truth, there was no need for him to refine it. The moment it formed a resonance with his astral energy, it started transforming into specks of starlight that enveloped his arm.

Long Chen’s arm was quickly covered by the specks of starlight, as if it had additional armor on it.

Long Chen then raised his hand. Looking at the eight star diagram on his palm, he felt his soul quivering. He instantly understood that this bone claw was a kind of inheritance, and only nine star heirs could obtain it.

The eight stars were in a circular formation on his palm. Long Chen found himself irresistibly drawn into their depths, feeling as though his very soul was being summoned. This diagram contained the most profound mysteries of heaven and earth, far beyond his level of understanding.

Long Chen then unleashed a claw strike. The void trembled and warped, giving rise to a colossal vortex.

“What terrifying power. It feels like it can crush the entire world. The astral energy in this bone claw boosts its power limitlessly,” Long Chen exclaimed, utterly astonished. With this bone claw in his possession, he might be capable of challenging Heaven Saints.

“Hehe, how is it? It’s good, right?” Mo Nian chortled, pleased with himself.

“You really are a good brother.” Long Chen gave him a thumbs-up, his previous vexation vanishing without a trace. After all, this thing was too precious.

The Earth Cauldron said that this bone claw came from a Heaven Saint nine star heir. With this bone claw, he wouldn’t have to fear the Heaven Saints.

As if reading his thoughts, the Earth Cauldron warned him, “This bone claw is a remnant of a Heaven Saint, and with your power, you are unable to control it. If you force it, you might be able to unleash ten percent of its power or even less. Furthermore, it will use up all your astral energy in an instant. This bone claw is your life-saving trump card.”

“Just ten percent?” Long Chen was a bit disappointed, but then, his eyes brightened. This was the power of a Heaven Saint nine star heir, so even ten percent should be very powerful.

“Long Chen, pack your things and come with me. Treasures are waiting for us. We can’t let them wait forever!” said Mo Nian.

“A stiff breeze will blow you over right now. I don’t think rushing over there is a good idea.” Long Chen rolled his eyes. Although both of them had the See A Treasure And Can’t Walk Away Disease, Mo Nian was actually greedier than Long Chen. For treasures, he was even willing to throw away his life.

“There’s a long road to that place, and I can slowly heal on the way. The main thing is that I can’t rest easy knowing that those treasures are waiting for us,” replied Mo Nian.

Hearing Mo Nian’s answer, Long Chen shook his head helplessly and brought Mo Nian to Bai Letian. Long Chen told Mo Nian about how Bai Letian had been willing to use the academy’s faith energy to heal him. Although he hadn’t done so in the end, this favor had to be remembered.

Mo Nian respectfully greeted Bai Letian as befitting of a junior and also gave him a white jade bottle, startling him. Receiving the bottle, Bai Letian was shocked by the contents inside it.

“This is... a karmic luck elixir.”

Long Chen was also shocked when he heard that. Mo Nian’s treasure was truly shocking. This karmic luck elixir could be considered a divine faith elixir, made of the purest faith energy.

Normally, this elixir was the original essence that a god, sect, or some faction set up when they were first established. This kind of elixir was only mentioned in the stories and never seen.

After all, this kind of elixir would be reclaimed by the Heavenly Daos upon the faction's demise. If the faction still existed but the elixir was stolen, that faction would quickly crumble. This elixir was essential to the foundation of any faction and could not be removed without consequence.

“It’s just a small gift. Please accept it,” said Mo Nian with a smile. Although his words were humble, the pride in his eyes proved just how pleased he was.

“This thing is too precious, especially for us at this early stage of establishment. This will help us immensely. I will shamelessly accept,” responded Bai Letian.

It truly was extremely important to the High Firmament Academy, as it would quicken the pace that the academy’s karmic luck took root in the dragon vein. At the same time, it would boost the power of the High Firmament Divine Sword.

After leaving Bai Letian’s side, Long Chen brought Mo Nian to the Dragonblood Legion. When Guo Ran saw him, he shouted in excitement and hugged Mo Nian enthusiastically.

The other Dragonblood warriors were also close to him, so all of them came forward to greet him. At this moment, Long Chen acknowledged that this fellow Mo Nian was truly badass. He had a gift for everyone, including Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan.

Each of these gifts was exceptionally precious, comparable to Heaven Saint divine weapons in value. Even Bai Shishi, who typically maintained a reserved demeanor, couldn't hide her excitement upon seeing the flying phoenix glass hairpin

“Tch, I let him show off again,” grumbled Long Chen. Looking at Mo Nian’s pleased appearance, Long Chen rolled his eyes.

“Boss Mo Nian, when are we going out for treasures?” asked Guo Ran. He got a large pile of divine materials he had never seen before, and he was so excited he wanted to kiss Mo Nian.

Xia Chen was equally excited to get countless materials for inscribing runes. Some of those materials were so precious that he was unable to use them at his cultivation base.

Both of them had previously gone out with Mo Nian to seek riches. Seeing that Mo Nian was so generous, they felt like his pockets were cornucopias of treasures, causing them to feel envious.

“Boss Guo Ran, this time, the situation is rather special, so I’m going to go with Long Chen to test it out first. If there are riches, naturally all of us brothers will share them,” promised Mo Nian.

Before they left, Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan urged Long Chen to be careful. After all, they had all heard of how Mo Nian was almost dead when he arrived, so it would be a lie to say that they weren’t worried.

Long Chen nodded and promised them to be careful. He then left everyone enough medicinal pills for their cultivation before leaving with Mo Nian.
