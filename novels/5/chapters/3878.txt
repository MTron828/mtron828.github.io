Chapter 3867 Claiming Blood

Luo Zichuan’s chest was dyed with blood. He instantly grew listless, as if he had lost the majority of his Blood Qi.

With Long Chen’s support, he stood and stared at that gate dispiritedly.

“Even after reaching this point, is it still a failure?”

“Family head, what is going on?” asked Long Chen. He didn’t know what the problem was.

He knew that Luo Zichuan was wise, a natural leader and strategist. For something this major, he had to have planned and calculated things countless times. How could it be a failure right at the end?

Luo Zichuan didn’t reply. He was just staring at the gate, and Long Chen didn’t dare to disturb him. He knew that Luo Zichuan was calculating how to open the gate.

After a couple of hours, Luo Zichuan shook his head and sighed. “Sometimes a person’s power is limited. Some things cannot be resolved with just the mind.”

“Family head, tell me. What is going on? You’re making me die of curiosity,” said Long Chen.

If it was anyone else, Long Chen would have long since grown impatient. But when it came to his grandfather, he didn’t dare to be so brash.

“My violet blood isn’t pure enough, so I cannot open this gate. Perhaps this is all fate. It isn’t something that humans can defy.” Luo Zichuan sighed helplessly.

“Then what if we found my mother? Wouldn’t it be-”

Luo Zichuan was shaking his head. “Your mother is already a Divine Venerate. She cannot come here…”

Luo Zichuan suddenly looked at Long Chen. His thinking was seen through; he was thinking of finding where his mother was.

Long Chen acted like he had no idea and said, “What if someone with powerful violet blood also came and worked together with you? Then could you open it?”

“Opening this gate is not something that can be done by gathering a great deal of violet blood. It is only possible when a person’s violet blood reaches the necessary level of purity. But in the Luo family, other than your mother, no one can compare to me. As for the other branches of the Violet Blood race, they don’t even know this secret. Furthermore, even if they are descendants of the Violet Blood race, they aren’t all worthy of trust. There’s nothing that can be done. Let’s go. We cannot stay in this sealed world for too long, or we won’t be able to find the entrance next time. We can think of something later!” Luo Zichuan slowly collected himself. In an instant, he seemed to have aged a great deal. His figure looked lonesome.

“Family head, I have a method to open this gate! Can you give me some time?” asked Long Chen.

“You have a method? Truly?” Luo Zichuan looked at him in surprise. He knew that Long Chen’s character was impetuous, but he was very reliable, so he wouldn’t randomly make such claims. Hearing this, Luo Zichuan was instantly revitalized.

“I am ninety percent sure,” said Long Chen. He was thinking of Long Aotian. As long as he could claim Long Aotian’s blood, then adding on Luo Zichuan’s violet blood energy, they could definitely open this gate.

“Ninety percent? Then let’s try it again. However, I can only stay in this space for three months. After three months, the spatial displacement will be too much. If I try to keep it here any longer, space will shatter. It will then be impossible to get back here,” said Luo Zichuan.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Three months? That’s enough. Tell him not to worry.” The dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Hearing that, Long Chen was even more confident and immediately agreed.

“Family head, do my techniques and fighting style have many problems? Even with the same power, the difference in our attacks is incredible.” Long Chen couldn’t help asking for advice from Luo Zichuan.

Just now, Luo Zichuan had killed those immemorial greater demons like slicing melons. But Long Chen’s power was explosive and only blew them back, failing to cut through them. Long Chen knew that despite being in the same realm, the two were still far from being on the same level.

“You foolish child, what are you asking for? His path doesn’t suit yours. Don’t waste your time.” Even before Luo Zichuan said anything, the dragon expert was already speaking for him.

As for Luo Zichuan, after pondering it for a moment, he shook his head. “When I think back to the pointers that I gave you before, I feel a bit regretful. I shouldn’t have taught you.”

“What?” Long Chen was dumbfounded.

“In this world, there is no one-size fits all; there is no technique that is perfect for everyone. My fighting style doesn’t suit you. If you try to imitate me, you will produce the opposite effect. The power in your body is too immense and mixed. As for myself, I only control one kind of power. Although you are unable to concentrate all your power, limiting its destructive power, the area of effect is much greater. It will compress space, giving you a sharper sense of your surroundings. In a chaotic battle, that is an advantage. Furthermore, it is impossible for you to calm your heart. This is your character, and no one can change such a thing. Your fighting style suits you. On the other hand, my fighting style is only something you can use as a reference. It would be best if you didn’t try to imitate it,” said Luo Zichuan.

Luo Zichuan’s words actually echoed the words of the dragon expert. Long Chen very much admired Luo Zichuan’s control. The difference in their fighting styles could be compared to using the body of the saber to smack people versus using the edge of the blade to slice through people. The body of the blade was larger, but its killing power was definitely inferior to the edge of the blade.

After hearing them both say such a thing, Long Chen temporarily set this aside. It seemed that he would only be able to rely on himself to adapt his own fighting style. He was the one who knew best what kind of fighting style suited him.

“Long Chen, if you really have a method, then let’s gamble. Our Violet Blood race has countless members trapped behind this gate. Everything will be up to you.” Luo Zichuan patted Long Chen’s shoulder solemnly.

“Family head, don’t worry, just leave it to me!” Long Chen nodded. He knew that this was Luo Zichuan’s greatest wish in his lifetime.

If Long Chen could accomplish this, that would be enough to redeem what his mother had done. If Luo Zichuan forgave his mother, then the entire Luo family would forgive her. After that, the father and daughter could be reunited, their estrangement over. Thus, this was a must-do for Long Chen.

Luo Zichuan was left alone in this world. After Long Chen put away the corpses of those greater demons, he followed the steps that Luo Zichuan had left. He went out of this chaotic space, returning to the three thousand worlds through the spatial crack.

Long Chen made a mark in this place, as well as leaving a formation disc here. As long as he was close enough, he could directly do a spatial transportation here.

“Go to the right,” said the dragon expert.

“Long Aotian is in that direction?” asked Long Chen.

“Are you trying to send yourself to your death? Long Aotian has found a place to absorb primal chaos qi. He wants to fully activate his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood. If you go now, you won’t be a match for him. I want to bring you to find my dragon king reverse scale. As long as you merge with my dragon king reverse scale, you won’t get beaten by those fellows,” said the dragon expert.

“But the time…”

“Everything is within control. There will be time. Stop wasting words and hurry.”

With the dragon expert urging him on, Long Chen flew off in a certain direction.
