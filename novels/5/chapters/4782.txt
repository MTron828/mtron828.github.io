Chapter 4771 Dog Eyes Look Down On People

Outside the gate, countless experts had gathered, with more arriving by the moment. Upon seeing the scene before them, they jumped in fright, not knowing what was going on.0

Various factions immediately beckoned over these people within the crowd. At first, these factions had been planning to carry out a simple welcome ceremony for these newcomers, perhaps saying a few encouraging words. However, in light of the chaos, they opted for silence, choosing instead to observe the unfolding spectacle.0

After all, both the Celestial race and the Heavenly Desolation Long clan were major factions within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. A clash between these two factions would definitely be a marvelous sight.0

The other factions quickly started to withdraw from their positions, showing that they had no intention of participating in this battle, so as to avoid misunderstandings. Moreover, they were also afraid of being sucked into the battle.0

“What is going on? Why is the Celestial race fighting the Long clan?” Many people were lost in the dark and asking questions.0

“You don’t know this? The black-robed fellow with that monstrous saber slaughtered a branch of the Celestial race within the pathway to the ninth heaven,” answered one expert.0

“Really? Isn’t that too exaggerated? Why would he provoke the Celestial race?”0

“Are you serious? That fellow called Long Chen didn’t just destroy a branch of the Celestial race; he did the same to hundreds of branches including the Netherdragon race, Lifehunter race, Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race, and the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race. It’s said that millions and millions of heavenly geniuses died there, with not even one survivor, and the people of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven could only watch through the gate. Why don’t you tell me if the Celestial race hates Long Chen or not?”0

“Damn, he’s that vicious?”0

“That’s not even all. He killed an expert from the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race, and one of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight’s disciples.”1

“What?! Is he crazy?! To offend so many factions at once, even if he is a disciple of the Long clan, they can’t possibly protect him!”0

“I guess the Celestial race wants to kill Long Chen as a show of their might. Theoretically, the Celestial race and the Long clan would take huge losses if they were to fight. However, the Celestial race has a huge advantage this time, as other factions that Long Chen offended will definitely stand on their side. Since that’s the case, the Long clan won’t dare to offend all of them for a single disciple. After all, Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight are Venerates amongst gods. Who would dare to provoke them? Furthermore, the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast is a terrifying existence from the primal chaos era. Heavens, this fellow’s guts really are too big!”5

Countless private discussions ensued, as after all, gossip knew no bounds. The news of Long Chen's actions, particularly the slaying of disciples from various races within the pathway to the ninth heaven, had leaked to some extent.0

At first, people were puzzled by the enmity between the Celestial race and the Long clan. However, as details emerged, they understood. It seemed that the Celestial race was confident in everyone else’s support, and so they were fearless.1

“Kill Long Chen to avenge our disciples!” When this roar echoed out, killing intent exploded from all experts in the surroundings.0

“Hold it!”0

Just then, Long Chen raised a hand.0

“What? Do you have any last words?” sneered Yue Wuxu.0

Long Chen sneered as he turned to Long Xihe, pointing at him. “Old thing, you really are a bad egg.”0

“You…!” Long Xihe was instantly enraged.0

“Shut your fucking mouth. Keep blabbering and I’ll kill you right here and now!” threatened Long Chen.1

Long Xihe instantly froze up, a chill striking his body. He didn’t dare to say a word.2

The fact that Long Chen would point and curse at Long Xihe baffled everyone. Just what was going on? Long Xihe was protecting Long Chen, but Long Chen treated him this way? They couldn’t believe this scene. Had they taken the wrong drugs today?0

In the distance, the Heaven Overseer eyed Long Chen with an odd smile. “As expected, a tiger will not have a dog son. This Long Chen isn’t a pushover. He has seen through Long Xihe’s intentions completely.”1

“He’s very arrogant. I don’t like him,” stated a Sage King.0

Long Xihe was a representative of the Long clan, so for Long Chen to speak to him so crudely was provoking the Long clan’s prestige.0

“You just don’t like Long Zhantian. Why don’t you challenge him and see what happens?” grumbled another Sage King.4

“You… What did you just say?!”0

“That’s enough. Stop talking and just watch,” commanded the Heaven Overseer coldly.0

His frosty expression instantly silenced the two Sage Kings. They simply exchanged a murderous glare before turning away from each other.0

Just then, Long Chen sneered at Long Xihe. “Let me remind you of some things. Firstly, just because my father is in the Long clan doesn’t mean that I will join the Long clan. Secondly, you intentionally left a hole in your words just so others could exploit it, ensuring that the Long clan wouldn’t accept me. From my perspective, it’s incredibly crude and laughable. Thirdly, even if I were in trouble, I would not seek anyone’s protection. Don’t use your dog eyes to look down on others. Also, let me warn you. If I do return to the Long clan one day, you will be the first to be cast out and forced to kowtow to me in apology.”2

“You… you… you have gone too far!” exclaimed Long Xihe as he quivered with rage, his face purple. He was also afraid as Long Chen had completely seen through his thoughts. He couldn’t help glancing in the direction of the Heaven Overseer. 1

If Long Chen could see through it, then how could it escape the gaze of the Heaven Overseer? He had the urge to slap his own mouth now, blaming himself for thinking that he was so clever.1

Yue Wuxu was baffled at first when Long Chen started cursing Long Xihe, but he then laughed.0

“Haha, dogs biting dogs, how interesting! But this changes nothing!” 0Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen turned back to glance at Yue Wuxu but ignored him. Instead, he looked at those experts who were exploding with righteous indignation.0

“You fools. You’ve fallen for someone else’s scheme without realizing it, just like those idiots from before. Sigh, there is no medicine in the world that can cure your stupidity.”4

“Shut the hell up! Hand over your life!”0

One fiery-tempered Sage King couldn’t even be bothered to listen to Long Chen. He ignored the others and charged out alone at Long Chen.
