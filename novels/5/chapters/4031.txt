Chapter 4020 Blue Flame Voracious Wolf

When the gate opened, what was reflected in everyone’s eyes was an uncountable number of treasures. There were even battleships and war chariots lined up in neat rows.

Behind them was a stack of crystals. Seeing them, Zhu Yunwen and the others’ eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

“Lightning Thunderclap Battleships, Lightning Thunderclap War Chariots, Heavenly Lightning Crystals…!”

Having fought the Violet Thunderclap Empire for countless years, the Vermilion Bird Empire was aware of their strongest instruments of war. Their Lightning Thunderclap Battleships and Lightning Thunderclap War Chariots were not just quick as lightning, but their attacks also contained immense thunderforce. It was almost equivalent to the full-power attack of a Double Supreme Earth Venerate.

Even three-flower Earth Venerates would be in danger against hundreds of these battleships at once. Their killing power was astonishing.

To their surprise, there were over a hundred thousand of them here. When they saw this, Zhu Yunwen and the others’ expressions changed. The Violet Thunderclap Empire had clearly come prepared.

“Destroy them, or they will cause huge damage to the Vermilion Bird Empire!” said Zhu Yifeng quietly.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Are you a fool? Why destroy them? Why don’t we use them?” demanded Long Chen.

“But the method to use them is a secret of their empire. Only the imperial members of the Violet Thunderclap Empire can use them, and they have spiritual seals on their souls to prevent those secrets from being stolen. We can’t even do a soulsearch,” said Zhu Yunwen.

The Violet Thunderclap Empire’s battleships and war chariots were their instruments of war, and their secrets were tightly locked. Outsiders couldn’t use them.

After fighting them for so many years, the Vermillion Bird Empire had obtained some of their battleships and war chariots, but those things were just collecting dust. No matter how they studied them, they were unable to replicate or control the chariots.

“Can such a minor thing cause any difficulty for us? What do you think these two are for?” Long Chen smiled and pointed at the Wild Blade and lightning tower.

Lei Linger had left the lightning tower and Wild Blade to Long Chen’s control. Their souls were shared, so the lightning tower and Wild Blade also viewed Long Chen as their master.

Long Chen pressed his hand on the lightning tower. After that, its light illuminated the battleships and war chariots. A flood of information quickly entered Long Chen’s mind.

There was a great deal of information, including the method for creating them, inscribing the runes, and controlling them.

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength then spread, passing this information to everyone. They were all delighted. The secret that they had been unable to uncover for so many years was dealt with in the blink of an eye by Long Chen.

With insiders like the Wild Blade and the lightning tower, there was nothing impossible. Long Chen had everyone divide up the battleships and war chariots.

The energy source for the battleships and war chariots was the Heavenly Lightning Crystals, so they divided the crystals up as well, enough to power chariots and battleships for a long time. This was the stock that the Violet Thunderclap Empire had been accumulating for millions of years.

After dividing up the battleships, war chariots, and Heavenly Lightning Crystals, everyone sent them into their astral spaces. Long Chen was then guided to another treasury by the Wild Blade and lightning tower.

However, what they found inside were items that only lightning attribute experts could use. Alas, the Vermilion Bird Empire’s experts were all flame element cultivators, so these things were useless to them.

Long Chen simply tossed all of them into his own pocket. Even if he couldn’t use them, he could always sell them for some decent money.

Even after emptying the treasuries, Long Chen wasn’t worried about being noticed. After all, the mechanisms here were under the control of the four divine weapons, which belonged to Lei Linger. Thus, Long Chen had the inside scoop that granted him the ability to embezzle all these treasures.

Even if Weng Taibei were to think of checking the treasuries, they could make it so that the runes in charge of opening the gates were broken, stalling him for a while. They wouldn’t suspect that someone had stolen them all.

“Now what?” asked Yu Qingxuan after they were done plundering the treasuries.

Originally, Long Chen’s plan was to destroy the capital of the Violet Thunderclap Empire. Even with Weng Taibei standing guard over here, Long Chen wasn’t discouraged. If they couldn’t beat him, they could always run. After all, with so many of them present, Weng Taibei couldn’t do anything to them.

However, now the plan had changed. Lei Linger was trying to control that immemorial lightning beast and needed time. They couldn’t expose themselves yet.

“Let’s take a stroll to the Blue Flame Empire. I heard that their faith divine beast is the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf. I feel like we can try it,” said Long Chen.

Of the eight empires, the Blue Flame Empire was the weakest. Just like the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire, they had once been the Vermilion Bird Empire’s little brother. Having offered tribute every year and being very subservient, they were actually akin to a subordinate empire.

Also, due to their faith divine beast being a flame element beast as well, the two empires got along quite well up until the past few years.

Unfortunately, people’s hearts were the hardest thing to refine. The Blue Flame Empire had joined forces with the Violet Thunderclap Empire, and a major reason for this was that they wanted to devour the immemorial Vermilion Bird in order to strengthen their Blue Flame Voracious Wolf.

Right now, Lei Linger was taking control of the immemorial lightning beast. If she succeeded, her power would rise to an unbelievable level.

If she could succeed, then Huo Linger could also succeed. Although she had no insider divine weapons that could help her go against the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf, Huo Linger was still stronger than Lei Linger at the moment.

After all, Huo Linger had devoured countless flames, one of them being the rank eight flame on the Heavenly Flame Rankings, the Ice Soul Divine Flame. There were also the Yan Xu Flame, as well as the Moon Flames and Sun Flames in the primal chaos space that she was constantly devouring.

It could be said that the current Lei Linger was the queen of flames. Although the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was an immemorial divine beast, it was still a heroic spirit just like the immemorial Vermilion Bird. It didn’t possess a body of flesh and blood.

Huo Linger would definitely have a high chance of consuming it. Even if she failed, it wouldn’t be that bad. But if she succeeded, then when Lei Linger and Huo Linger unleashed the Double Dragon Destruction, it would truly destroy the heavens.

“Can we even sneak into the Blue Flame Empire?” asked Zhu Yifeng.

“As long as you follow me, there’s no need to think that much! Let’s go play around!”

After Long Chen had everyone get on the flying boat, the Wild Blade and the lightning tower sent them up the lightning stream. They then saw Weng Taibei sitting in the air again.

Weng Taibei once more opened his eyes and looked around suspiciously, but he still didn’t notice anything.

Not wasting any time, Long Chen quickly brought them to the border. After crossing it, Long Chen had everyone summon the Lightning Thunderclap Battleships. Just like that, they brazenly flew for the Blue Flame Empire.

They didn’t know what Long Chen was doing with this, but since he didn’t say, they didn’t ask. They just thickened their faces and followed.

The battleships whistled and thundered as they headed straight for the Blue Flame Empire. When they reached the border, Long Chen didn’t slow down. He directly barged through their barrier, piercing straight through it. That action shook the entire Blue Flame Empire.

The Lightning Thunderclap Battleships proved to be incredibly fast. The Blue Flame Empire’s capital wasn’t too far from the border, so before any countermeasure could be enacted, the battleships had already come to a halt directly above the capital. Long Chen then raised his hand, and a fiery lotus bloomed with rapid intensity.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

An enormous flame lotus fell to the ground like a meteorite, crashing into the heart of the capital’s formation. Long Chen had unleashed a thunderous attack right from the start.
