Chapter 3939 Prince Pulling Chariot

The Vermillion Bird Empire had a long and illustrious history. Although they had gone through countless periods of prosperity and decline, their inheritance had never been fully severed.

They made offerings to the Vermilion Bird totem, the divine flame beast phoenix. However, the Vermilion Bird Empire actually did not have any phoenix totems. Legend had it that the phoenix was just like the Kunpeng and the ancestral dragon, relying on its own cultivation to reach its height. It was not born as a phoenix.

It was said that all fire attribute bird races were blessed by the phoenix. Even a little crow, even a tiny sparrow, had a chance to cultivate into the undying phoenix.

The Vermilion Bird was a flame attribute divine bird from the primal chaos era, and there were thirteen historical records of the Vermilion Bird ascending into an undying phoenix. It was the race that produced the most undying phoenixes.

People said that the Vermilion Bird race had received the greatest part of the phoenix’s blessing, so it was the race closest to the phoenix.

A flame attribute divine bird needed to pass through ninety-nine steps to cultivate into the undying phoenix. But the Vermilion Bird was born on the sixty-sixth step and only needed to take thirty-three steps to become the undying phoenix.

After the battle of the primal chaos, there were quite a few inheritances of the Vermilion Bird left within the nine heavens and ten lands. However, the Vermilion Bird never appeared again.

In most of the world, it was said that the Vermilion Bird race was exterminated in the primal chaos battle. It was said that this was the greatest battle in the history of the nine heavens and ten lands. Back then, the world collapsed and the ten thousand Daos were crippled. As a result, countless races turned into nothing more than legends, never to be seen again.

However, those that worshiped the Vermilion Bird firmly believed that the Vermilion Bird still existed somewhere. This faith had never been broken.

The Vermilion Bird Empire was one of the most devout believers in the Vermilion Bird race. The majority of this empire’s cultivators were flame cultivators. As for the actual Vermilion Bird Empire’s imperial household, they were all flame cultivators.

It was said that the Vermilion Bird Empire’s imperial bloodline was a branch of the primal chaos era’s renowned Jiuli race. Being in possession of the Jiuli bloodline, they were naturally close to the Heavenly Daos and could control the flames of the ten thousand Daos.

As for Yu Qingxuan, she was the princess that the Vermilion Bird Empire had been hiding. When she appeared, she shook the entire empire. That was because she possessed an incredibly pure Jiuli bloodline, far above her ancestors.

When she was born, a rainbow protected her. Later on, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame called her, and she became the new master of the rank nine Heavenly Flame known as the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

It was only after obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame that Yu Qingxuan truly became famous. When she returned to the Vermilion Bird Empire, she was praised as the pearl of the Vermilion Bird, the light that eclipsed the stars.

The Vermilion Bird Empire was an enormous existence whose lands were rich with natural resources. This empire was composed of thirty-seven prefectures, neighboring eight empires.

Although the Vermilion Bird Empire was powerful, they never wantonly expanded their territory or took advantage of their position to bully others. Thus, it could be said that their relationships with their neighbors were harmonious.

However, in the last few years, those neighboring empires grew unfriendly and began to cause trouble on the border. Amongst them was the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire had once benefited greatly from depending on the Vermilion Bird Empire. They were saved from crisis several times thanks to the Vermilion Bird Empire, but now they were the ones causing the most trouble.

It was because the current Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire was backed by the Violet Thunderclap Empire, a nation that harbored great animosity toward the Vermilion Bird Empire. Although they had not gone to war in millions of years, the hatred between the two sides had not lessened after all this time.

Currently, the border of the Vermilion Bird Empire was in a tense state. There were often some small-scale conflicts occurring. Although they weren’t large battles, they were constant, causing an aggravating disturbance to the Vermilion Bird Empire.

“A bunch of hopping clowns. All they know is hopping around all day. I really wish I could kill those ungrateful bastards.” In front of an enormous city gate, an armored expert glared furiously at an enemy army in the distance that was incessantly shouting and drilling.

This was the border between the Vermilion Bird Empire and the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire. But lately, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire had started to strengthen the border. They were holding training drills closer and closer to the border line as if intentionally provoking the Vermilion Bird Empire’s soldiers.

Although they never crossed the border, they would run assault drills right up to the border and then make provoking gestures at them.

“The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire is a pack of dogs that don’t learn. How many times did we help them out before? Now, they actually bite us just because the Violet Thunderclap Empire is instigating them. They’re worse than dogs,” said another soldier hatefully.

There were dozens of soldiers in silver armor in the area. They were Immortal Kings. Although they were no longer young, their Blood Qi was still in top condition. They were in the prime of their life.

There was also one soldier in golden armor who gave off a Supreme Qi. This was a Supreme expert whose cultivation base was at the very peak of the Immortal King realm. He had already taken half a step into the World King realm, and thus he should count as a half-step World King.

This half-step World King watched the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s experts with disdain. “The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire is a group of idiots. Our Vermilion Bird Empire never bullied them, so they thought that we weren’t that frightening. All the Violet Thunderclap Empire had to do was apply some pressure and give some benefits, and these bastards directly aligned themselves with them. It has been too long since our Vermilion Bird Empire last fought the others, so many people have already forgotten our might. Perhaps it is time to show our power.”

Suddenly, they heard rumbling in the distance. A golden war chariot was slowly being pulled over, exuding a sacred aura that shook their souls.

“That’s the Heavenly Ruler Seal War Chariot! Sound the alarm and prepare for battle!” The half-step World King’s expression changed, and he barked orders. After that, an ear-piercing alarm wailed through the border, causing tens of thousands of soldiers to gather, all of them taking out their weapons. At this moment, their killing intent blazed.

“Eh? Something’s wrong.”

Watching as the Heavenly Ruler Seal War Chariot slowly approached, they saw that when it got to the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s camp, it caused chaos like boiling water. Countless experts were now attacking it.

A golden whip then struck the air, turning those experts into blood foam when struck. Amongst them included a half-step World King. That person was a commander in the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

“What?”

The Vermilion Bird Empire’s soldiers were dumbfounded. What was going on? They were killing each other?

Suddenly, three strikes of the whip could be heard. Only then did the Vermilion Bird Empire’s experts notice that the Heavenly Ruler Seal War Chariot was being pulled by three people. The three of them screamed in pain after the whip struck them.

The half-step World King then looked more closely, and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. He recognized one of those three.

“Isn’t that the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s seventeenth prince?”

“Fuck, how are you so trash? Pull the chariot faster! Once we arrive, you can scram.”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The half-step World King now saw the man holding the whip in the chariot. He was yelling at the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s seventeenth prince like the latter was a horse or a mule.

“He has the prince pulling the chariot?!”

The Vermilion Bird Empire’s soldiers were all dumbfounded by this spectacle.
