Chapter 1588 The Sixth Sense, Sixth Root, Sixth Will

Translator: BornToBe

“Hahaha, as expected of the sprout I look favorably upon!” laughed the old man.

Long Chen looked at his own right hand with a strange expression. The old man’s attack had truly been sudden. It hadn’t contained any killing intent and had been launched at such close range. There was no way for anyone to react to that.

According to reason, he shouldn’t be able to do anything. A person’s reaction speed was limited.

Long Chen also hadn’t reacted at all. He didn’t even know what had happened before his right hand caught the old man’s staff.

“This... is a kind of instinct?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, you can put it that way, but that’s not entirely correct. An instinctual reaction would normally require sensing danger. However, I had no intent to kill you, so it wasn’t instinct. This is a kind of mental state of the sixth form of Split the Heavens. As long as you are in this state, no illusion or technique will be able to bewilder you. Little brat, you really are a monster. You learned this ability right at the start, while those brats are still unable to control this power. Hmph, when I get back, I’ll have to give them a proper beating. They aren’t even a match for a child,” said the old man.

Through this experiment, the old man had confirmed that Long Chen was truly in control of this mental state. Long Chen had given him a nice surprise.

In truth, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s Battle God Sacred Canon focused more on power, not Spiritual Strength. However, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was not inferior to his physical body.

He had condensed one billion and eighty million primordial runes to form his Yuan Spirit. That had caused his Spiritual Strength to also transform, although even Long Chen wasn’t completely aware of that.

The fact that he could cultivate the sixth form of Split the Heavens so easily was undeniably related to his powerful Yuan Spirit.

Seeing Long Chen’s lost and excited expression, the old man smiled. “The sixth form is different from the fifth form. You’ll no longer need to randomly hack at your opponents. Instead, it will gradually merge into your fighting technique. Now that the sixth form’s acupuncture points have been activated, you’ve opened your six senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and will. They correspond to the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and will. The rest is easy to understand, but the will is inexplicable. This will can be described as the spiritual perception, the consciousness, the divine sense, etc. However, those are all both right and wrong. This kind of ability can only be experienced. It sounds complicated, but it’s easy to put into practice. With your six senses merged, you will enter a special state. Now you don’t need to fear assassination attempts or group battles. Even the Bloodkill Hall, ever since ancient times, wouldn’t dare to assassinate our Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples. That’s because the sixth form of Split the Heavens completely counters their assassination arts. Not only that, but even illusion arts will be useless. There are countless illusion arts; however, they all involve affecting the mind through the six senses. With the six senses merged with your body, illusion arts won’t be able to find an opening to affect you. This is also the reason why the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect could cultivate just the Battle God Sacred Canon and Split the Heavens, and still dominate the land. Each of the latter forms of Split the Heavens is more terrifying than the last.”

Long Chen was shocked. Perhaps in the entire Martial Heaven Continent, only the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect would have nothing but one cultivation technique and one Battle Skill. However, they had still dominated this continent once.

The Xuantian Dao Sect had all-encompassing magical arts that could manifest the indescribable Dao. However, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s one technique was enough to match it. This could be taken as a contrary path, to go from complicated to simple.

Just the sixth form was already so powerful. Then what about the seventh, eighth, and ninth forms? Just how strong were they?

“Maintain this state and carefully experience all your senses. This is very important. The sixth form of Split the Heavens can be split into the aura and the attack. You can use them separately. Now you are in the state of the aura, which is also called the sixth sense, the sixth root, the sixth will. There are many ways to call it. Just this aura is enough to benefit you for a lifetime. It can be used on its own, and once you’re more experienced, you can use it without this strange posture. However, the actual attack requires you to use this posture. Otherwise, you might lose your life,” warned the old man.

“I understand.” Long Chen nodded. Although he had yet to actually go through with the attack, he found that only this posture allowed him to create an unimpeded flow through his fifty-four acupuncture points.

If this posture was slightly off, the path would be hindered or blocked. There were only two possibilities if that happened. One was, if his power was unable to go through fully, it would cause his attack to lose most of its power. However, the worst case was that he used too much power, and having it be blocked would cause his meridians to explode, along with the rest of him. It was no wonder the old man was so grave about this.

“Alright, there’s not much time yet. Remember this state and take this.” The old man took out the Heaven Splitting Blade.

The Heaven Splitting Blade was also called the Heaven Splitting Divine Blade. There were countless legends about it, but those stories were so ancient that many things had been lost.

While holding the Heaven Splitting Divine Blade, Long Chen heard the old man say, “Through your aura, activate the six senses. Draw in the energy of heaven and earth into the first acupuncture point. Remember not to draw too much energy to it. The energy has to go through fifty-four acupuncture points, and each time it goes through one, its power will double. If you use up too much energy at the start and don’t have enough at the end, it will also cause it to lose effect. You’ll just end up injuring yourself. However much energy you draw out of the world is how much energy you should use from your qi sea. Merge the two energies together to form a new kind of power.”

Long Chen hadn’t expected the sixth form of Split the Heavens to be so complicated. He had to increase his energy with each acupuncture point. That required very precise control.

“Don’t be afraid. Estimate the energy in your qi sea. Even if you fail, it’s fine. The Heaven Splitting Blade will protect you...” said the old man.

“Long Chen, don’t move. Fully open your power to me. I will help you guide it. All you need to do is remember the process.”

Suddenly, a spiritual message came from the Heaven Splitting Blade. Its item-spirit was actually speaking to him.

“Alright. Thank you for your troubles, senior. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have any assurance.” Long Chen nodded.

“Divine ring!”

A five-colored divine ring appeared, shaking the sky. Within the red, orange, yellow, green, and azure divine ring was a five-point star. When it manifested, a powerful pressure shook the entire Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Heavens, big brother Long Chen’s divine ring has appeared!”

The disciples that had just been chased away ran back, looking at the sky in excitement. Although they had seen images of Long Chen fighting heavenly geniuses, it wasn’t as shocking as personally seeing them. They could now feel that will that looked down arrogantly upon the nine heavens.

“FengFu Star!”

“Alioth Star!”

“Life Fate Star!”

“Enlightenment Palace Star!”

“Divine Gate Star!”

The five points of the star in his divine ring lit up one by one. Each point had a star shining brightly now. The world shuddered uneasily in the face of this power.

“Fortunately, they’re high up in the air. If they were standing on the ground, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect would be wrecked. This brat’s really a monster.” The Seventh Boss was gobsmacked. They had arrived at the end of the battle last time and hadn’t seen Long Chen really fighting.

Meanwhile, the old man’s eyes were shining as he stared at Long Chen without blinking. Long Chen’s current power even gave him a sense of pressure.

Long Chen raised the Heaven Splitting Blade. This wasn’t his own action but the guidance of the Heaven Splitting Blade.

All Long Chen needed to do was unleash all his power, and the Heaven Splitting Blade would direct him, helping him activate all of his acupuncture points. There was no need for Long Chen to calculate anything.

Long Chen had his eyes closed as he sensed the merger of the outer world’s energy with his own. This was his first time feeling the energy of the Heavenly Daos.

However, this was different from Celestials. Celestials had Heavenly Dao energy given to them, while Long Chen had to force the heavens to give him this energy.

Under the pressure of the divine ring, the Heavenly Dao energy had no way to resist as it was forcibly taken and merged into his acupuncture points.

As Long Chen’s spiritual yuan merged with the Heaven Dao energy, it was like they ignited. It was also like a volcano whose lid was removed.

Rumbling sounds came from Long Chen’s body. In the end, the sound was like divine thunder, shaking heaven and earth.

Boss Bao and the others stared in shock. They were able to unleash the sixth form of Split the Heavens, but they had never caused such a phenomenon.

The Heaven Splitting Blade shone like a sun as all his acupuncture points were activated. However, just as everyone thought that Long Chen was about to slash it down, that light dimmed. The terrifying fluctuations also faded.

“Ah? Why isn’t he unleashing it?

“Exactly. Isn’t holding it uncomfortable?”

The disciples were all disappointed. They had wanted to see how powerful Long Chen’s attack would be. However, this lightning storm had contained only thunder.

“Many thanks, senior.”

Long Chen’s divine ring disappeared, and he returned the Heaven Splitting Blade to the old man. He was a bit out of breath and pale, as he had used up the majority of his spiritual yuan.

The reason he hadn’t been able to unleash the attack in the end was because his Five Star Battle Armor had reached its limit.

“Good. Having activated all your acupuncture points with your greatest power, its potential will be even greater in the future,” said the Heaven Splitting Blade.

“You’ve learned the sixth form of Split the Heavens. I’ll pass on the seventh form to you as well. Whether or not you can learn it, it’s best if you just memorize it first,” said the old man, pulling Long Chen back to the mountain peak.
