Chapter 3232 Mysterious Altars

The Chu family was located at the southern foot of the Sheng Prefecture’s Sheng Heaven Mountain Range. Their backs were against the mountains, and to their left was a large river that was like a dragon snaking around the Chu family.

As for the mountain, it was just like a crouching tiger. This was a treasured land. It was as if a dragon was coiling around it and a tiger was at its back. Adding on the protection of the grand formation, all the Sheng Prefecture’s spiritual qi gathered at the Chu family.

The spirit gathering formation sucked away the spiritual qi from all over the Sheng Prefecture. From this, it could be seen just how the Chu family treated others. Ordinarily, a spirit gathering formation would only cover your own territory. For example, the High Firmament Academy’s spirit gathering formations wouldn’t affect the other powers and cities nearby. For the Chu family to spread their reach this far was a kind of theft.

It was clearly harming others to benefit oneself. The Chu family’s spiritual qi might be abundant, but the other sects and powers would be affected. However, with the Chu family being the overlord of the Sheng Prefecture, they didn’t dare to get angry and could only silently endure.

The Chu family had activated their spirit gathering formations to the highest level, so streams of spiritual qi were gushing toward them.

Furthermore, all the grand formations had been activated. The Chu family was on a state of high alert.

“Does the Chu family know that we’re attacking?” The Grand Elder stared at their state of high alarm worriedly.

“That’s impossible. Other than us, no one else knew that we were going. Long Chen must be correct. The Chu family is brewing some tricks, and they’ve locked down. Our own eyes are unable to transmit any news through this blockade. This is not normal,” said Luo Changwen.

During this time, the Luo family’s eyes within the Chu family had all vanished. They were unable to transmit any news and couldn’t warn them of anything.

According to Luo Changwen’s guess, the Chu family couldn’t have found all their spies, just like how the Luo family had no way to eliminate all of the Chu family’s spies in the Luo family. But it was simple to lock down all news from escaping. They simply had to place everyone in one place and keep watch over them. If anyone tried to send some words out in such a state, they would be instantly exposed.

Bai Xiaole’s spatial arts had managed to bring them all the way to the heart of the Chu family without anyone being the wiser. But these formations blocked him.

Seeing this, Bai Xiaole felt quite regretful that he hadn’t studied any spatial arts for breaking through formations. His mother had taught them to him, but he had simply devoured all of them in one gulp without considering them. He had never practiced those techniques even once.

Having no assurance of being able to slip through this formation, he couldn’t possibly risk everyone’s lives on the attempt.

“Now what? With such a high state of alert, it’s impossible to sneak in. We can only attack directly.” The Grand Elder looked at Long Chen.

Although he had some bias when it came to Long Chen due to Luo Qingyang, in the face of the big picture, he was able to set aside that personal prejudice.

“No need to rush. Everything is within expectations,” said Long Chen, smiling to indicate that everyone didn’t need to worry. He turned to Bai Xiaole. “Can you use your spatial technique to see inside?”

Bai Xiaole nodded. His Three Flower Pupils circulated and everyone closed their eyes. They then began to see through the formation through Bai Xiaole’s sight.

Unexpectedly, despite the formations set up on the outside, they couldn’t see anyone inside. It was only when they saw that the buildings were packed with disciples that they understood.

Just as Luo Changwen had expected, the Chu family’s people had gathered everyone to keep an eye on each other. Even some children were included.

“Look further back. I can sense a strange aura,” said Long Chen.

Bai Xiaole’s sight quickly passed through one building after another. Even these layers of formations were unable to stop him from seeing through them.

“The Bloodkill Hall’s people!”

Qin Feng suddenly cried out, drawing everyone’s attention to a certain building. There were hundreds of cloaked figures inside. They seemed to be discussing something.

“Don’t look at them!” said Long Chen hastily.

Bai Xiaole immediately shifted his vision, passing through them. Amongst that group of cloaked figures, one of them seemed to have sensed something and looked around. But they didn’t sense anything further and returned to their original location.

Their hearts shook. That person was definitely an expert amongst experts. It had to be known that Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils were capable of looking through these layers of formations, allowing him to see things with the same viewpoint as the Heavenly Daos. But that person still sensed it.

Long Chen sneered as he recognized that person. He was precisely the one who had used a clone to disguise as the Grand Elder and try to assassinate Long Chen.

“What is that?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Bai Xiaole suddenly cried out. Within the most hidden area of the Chu family, there were five altars. They had various tributes on top of them. Meanwhile, the Chu family’s experts were holding large tools, pouring some kind of bloody-like fluid into the totems on the altars.

Those totems looked like five different beasts. They had never seen them before. When the liquid was poured into them, various runes lit up on the altars until they were like balls of light.

“Hahaha, it’s done! Devil Kings of the Netherworld, hurry up! The blood of the Luo family is waiting for you!” One of the Chu family’s elders laughed as he saw the altars shining.

Beside him were over a thousand experts of the Chu family who also laughed along. Those people were all at the Divine Lord realm, and amongst them were close to a hundred Primals.

Luo Changwen and the others sucked in a cold gasp of air. Although they had done their best to overestimate the Chu family, they hadn’t expected their foundation to be so powerful.

Thinking about it, if the Luo family didn’t have Luo Zichuan standing guard, the Chu family would have probably long since attacked.

Those five altars also gave them a sense of terror. Although they didn’t know what those Devil Kings were, they could tell that those Devil Kings were definitely prepared for Luo Zichuan.

Now that they were here, Luo Changwu felt regretful. He should have ordered all the Luo family’s experts to attack, instead of only bringing these few people for a sneak attack.

Those five altars were glowing brighter and brighter. If they didn’t immediately stop the Chu family, then they might not be able to endure this attack. Even if Luo Zichuan was present, they might not be able to endure it.

Luo Changwu looked at Luo Changwen, who then shook his hand and pointed at Long Chen. He saw that Long Chen was eyeing those five altars indifferently. He didn’t seem nervous.

From those five lights, Long Chen sensed the aura of the Netherworld. Now, an impossibly beautiful face appeared in his mind. That beautiful face then split in two, becoming two people.

“Leng Yueyan, Ming Cangyue, are you still doing alright?” Long Chen sighed inside. These two women were carved into his heart.

Taking a deep breath, he suppressed those emotions and said, “Get ready. I’m about to attack.”
