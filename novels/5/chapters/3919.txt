Chapter 3908 Mo Nian Steals From the Master

BOOM!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The ray of light shimmered with a brilliant golden color, surrounding an arrow with an array of runes around it. Upon contact with Yin Changsheng's spear, the arrow erupted into a powerful explosion.

The force of the explosion forced Yin Changsheng back, disrupting his attack and leaving it in ruins. Emerging from the dissipating smoke, the figure of Mo Nian appeared before him, looking poised and ready to fight.

The current Mo Nian had a Heavenly Dao Crown on the back of his head. As for the palace in his manifestation, it now exuded a titanic strength. Every blade of grass, every inch of the palace looked real, as if the manifestation was its own world that had covered up the real world.

The palace gave off sacred light that enveloped Mo Nian, giving him a graceful and majestic appearance. He now seemed to appear even more transcendent and noble.

However, that stubborn, fearless, and arrogant smile on his face and the wretchedness in his eyes ruined the overall image.

Yin Changsheng furiously shouted, “Mo Nian, you street rat, you stole from me last time. I’ll be taking your life as repayment!”

As Yin Changsheng laid eyes on his mortal enemy, intense anger welled up within him, causing his eyes to turn a fiery shade of red. The next moment, he unleashed the power of his faith domain, manifesting it like a mountain to crush Mo Nian beneath its weight.

The moment Yin Changsheng launched his attack, a disturbance rippled through the void. Unexpectedly, Mo Nian already appeared beside him. With lightning-like speed, his shovel mercilessly struck Yin Changsheng's face from a bizarre angle. As a result, before Yin Changsheng could fully release his power, he was already sent flying through the air.

“Hahaha, success, success! I’ve finally learned Long Chen’s trump card! Hahaha, as expected, without killing intent, it isn’t easy to sense, hahaha!”

After Mo Nian used his shovel to slap Yin Changsheng away, everyone was stunned. This attack was completely sudden and outside everyone’s expectations.

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others also felt Mo Nian’s movements to be a bit familiar, seeing that his angle was very similar to Long Chen’s divine face-slapping art.

Right now, Mo Nian was dancing in excitement, as if he had just learned some peerless technique, leaving people flabbergasted.

“Courting death!”

Yin Changsheng felt a stinging pain on his face. This attack might not be fatal, but it was unbearable, not due to the pain, but because of the naked humiliation.

Thus, Yin Changsheng’s faith domain erupted like raging flames. Furiously clenching his teeth, he shot at Mo Nian.

To his surprise, Mo Nian abruptly appeared beside him again, smacking a shovel at his face once more.

BOOM!

But this time, Yin Changsheng was the one sending Mo Nian tumbling back.

“Oh? What’s going on? Why didn’t it work this time?” Mo Nian cried out dispiritedly.

“Die!” Yin Changsheng furiously pressed the attack against Mo Nian.

“Hey, hey, slow down a bit! I’m still not used to this technique! Brother, give me some face. Let me try it a few more times- no , just once, a single time!” Mo Nian repeatedly retreated in front of Yin Changsheng’s furious attacks, but his mouth didn’t slack.

“Go fuck yourself, you little-!” Yin Changsheng cursed him furiously with a torrent of abuse. Even after fighting countless heavenly geniuses and killing countless monsters, he had never encountered such a shameless opponent before.

Just as Yin Changsheng was cursing, Mo Nian’s shovel whistled toward him. Yin Changsheng hastily dodged, but as a result, the shovel hit him on his head with an explosive sound, leaving him dizzy, stars spinning in his eyes. A large lump then swelled out of his head.

“Damn, I missed!” Mo Nian cried out, feeling vexed. He was intentionally angering Yin Changsheng to create opportunities for himself.

After all, he wasn’t Long Chen. This was just a technique that he had copied from Long Chen. As his combat experience was not as great as Long Chen’s and he didn’t specialize in close-quarters combat, despite having trained in this technique secretly, there was still a definite skill gap between them.

The first time was a success because it was unexpected. In their previous fight, Mo Nian had intentionally kept some distance to make Yin Changsheng think that he would never suddenly appear beside him.

The second time, he did it intentionally to anger Yin Changsheng, but Yin Changsheng was still a powerful expert, so Mo Nian naturally didn’t succeed in using the same technique twice in a row.

This technique was a casual blow without the intention of physically harming the opponent, so its power was very limited. After all, its effectiveness lay in its mental damage.

For Yin Changsheng to be struck again, his fury instantly exploded. Countless spear-images then shot out of his spear, forcing Mo Nian back.

Almost struck by his spear several times, Mo Nian cried out, “Hey, brother, that time didn’t count! Slow down a bit and let’s try again. All I’m asking for is one more slap! I won’t let you lose out, I have money right here! Name any price. My family business is doing well, and I’m not lacking money.”

In response, Yin Changsheng’s spear unleashed a tempest of attacks, akin to a flower of spear-images blooming. Each thrust carried an overwhelming surge of faith energy that could reduce anyone struck by it to mere dust.

To Yin Changsheng's surprise, his overwhelmingly powerful domain, which was capable of rendering others immobile, didn’t seem to affect Mo Nian. Mo Nian was easily dodging and taunting Yin Changsheng. Although he barely dodged several times, from the start, Yin Changsheng was unable to even touch his hair. Frustration consumed Yin Changsheng as he clenched his teeth tightly in anger.

Finally, after dodging hundreds of times and being surrounded by Yin Changsheng’s attacks, Mo Nian had no choice but to put away his shovel. He then took out his bow and used the string to block one of Yin Changsheng’s attacks.

The string merely quivered, and borrowing its elasticity, Mo Nian neutralized Yin Changsheng’s attack. After that, Mo Nian flew back and raised his bow.

An arrow shot out like a streak of lightning, reaching Yin Changsheng in an instant, but it was blocked by Yin Changsheng’s spear.

“Since you want to fight properly, let’s fight. I heard from Long Chen that you have a spiritual beast? Summon it. Let me see how strong you are together,” said Mo Nian solemnly.

“I don’t need to summon it against you-” Yin Changsheng waved his spear and pointed it at Mo Nian with a sneer. However, he suddenly felt a gust of wind. Once again, a shovel swiftly struck him in the face, interrupting his intended action.

This time, the shovel landed solidly, causing Yin Changsheng to be like a spinning top thrown into the distance.

“Idiot, I offered you money, but you refused. Well, now I’m not giving you any money for this! Hehe, how’s that? Bite me!” Mo Nian smiled at him. When he took his combat posture, it was a con just for this opportunity.

Mo Nian waved his butt at Yin Changsheng in the distance while showing off his shovel. That appearance of his was definitely enraging.

“I’ll go all-out against you!” Yin Changsheng was so furious that his eyes turned red, looking like an ominous devil now. Mo Nian had successfully driven him mad.

“Supreme Blood, Heavenly Deity Possession!”

In an instant, the aura of Yin Changsheng’s Supreme Blood erupted. Flames tinged with a deep crimson hue ignited around him, exuding an intense and ominous presence.

“Is he mad?! He’s burning his Supreme Blood!?” Shocked cries rang out. Burning his Supreme Blood was a self-destructive technique that exacted a toll on his life force and longevity.

At this moment, an enormous figure appeared behind Yin Changsheng, and a berserk divine might crashed down, making the Heavenly Daos wail. It was like this world was about to be crushed.

“Mo Nian, I will rip the skin off of your body and crush your bones to dust!”

As Yin Changsheng’s aura grew explosively, even his voice changed, resonating with a bloody feeling.

“Die!”

Yin Changsheng then stepped forward. Heaven and earth collapsed beneath his feet as he shot at Mo Nian.
