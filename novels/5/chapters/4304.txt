Chapter 4293: Despicable Long Clan

Long Chen roared like an injured beast, his wild killing intent exploded. He then forcibly ripped that half-step Eternal elder apart.

The half-step Eternal elder’s Blood Qi had regressed, making him weaker than other half-step Eternals. However, it shouldn’t have reached the point of being unable to receive a single blow from Long Chen.

Unfortunately, he was too arrogant, not placing Long Chen in his eyes the entire time. He thought that Long Chen wouldn’t dare to cause too big of a wave in the Long clan’s territory.

However, he had not foreseen that Long Chen would nearly lose control upon witnessing his father's condition and directly kill him.

With the High Firmament Divine Sword being pointed at him, the patriarch didn’t dare to move a finger. As for the other experts, their actions were also locked down by the palace master. If any of them moved, the palace master would strike them.

“Soulsearch!”

Long Chen roared. In an instant, a flying Yuan Spirit was caught by Long Chen, and he pressed a finger on the forehead of the elder’s Yuan Spirit.

Bang!

When the elder’s Yuan Spirit exploded, countless images appeared in Long Chen’s mind.

Although Long Chen was unable to conduct soulsearches like Meng Qi, this brute force soulsearch method could still be used to check the fragments of a shattered soul. It wouldn't provide a complete record, but among the millions of fragments, Long Chen was able to see what Long Zhantian had been forced to endure.

Once Long Zhantian was imprisoned, they discovered that he possessed the seven-color Supreme Blood. Due to this, the Long clan did something even more heartless than beasts.

They actually began to continuously extract Long Zhantian’s Supreme Blood, resulting in his cultivation base being stuck at the Divine Flame realm all this time.

Not only that, but they also forced Long Zhantian to hand over the divine abilities and immortal arts of the seven-color Supreme Blood.

Long Aotian’s Seven Peak Sword was originally a divine ability of the seven-color Supreme Blood, with Long Zhantian as the source. What was laughable was that Long Aotian was simply incapable of condensing a sword with his blood, and so the Long clan could only create a Seven Peak Sword for him to use.

On the other hand, Long Chen was capable of it, as the seven-color Supreme Blood was originally his.

From those images, Long Chen saw them use icy syringes to stab his father’s sickly body and extract his essence blood. Long Chen’s head buzzed.

“I WILL DESTROY YOUR LONG CLAN!”

Long Chen raised his head and roared, unleashing a sacred chant that echoed through the air. However, rather than sounding like the murmurs of benevolent gods, it resembled the sinister whispers of devils more. The world itself seemed to shift in color, and an overwhelming heat began to surge.

The next moment, a flame lotus appeared in the sky with countless flames raging within it. The Ice Soul Divine Flame, the Moon Flame, the Sun Flame, the Yan Xu Flame, and countless other flames were all merged together.

The flame lotus rapidly grew, covering the entire Arrogant Dragon Prefecture. The terrifying heat ignited countless buildings, and the entire Arrogant Dragon Prefecture became a flame hell.

The prefecture had been cut in two by the palace master, causing countless experts to be startled and rush over. But when they saw those terrifying flames, they instantly fled in terror without daring to figure out what was going on.

These flames were so terrifying that even half-step Eternal experts were shaking. If this attack landed, the entire Arrogant Dragon Prefecture would be wiped out. Other than half-step Eternals, all others would be killed.

The Long clan’s experts screamed in terror and didn’t even bother waiting for orders from their patriarch. They fled for their lives.

However, those experts seemed to slam into something upon reaching a certain range, and their bodies exploded.

“Those who run without permission will die!” declared the palace master coldly.

The entire Long clan descended into chaos. The flame lotus in Long Chen’s hand continued to grow, as he truly intended to wipe out the Long clan.

Countless buildings of the Long clan were set ablaze, and even the grand formations were unable to resist that terrifying heat. Seeing this scene, the patriarch clenched his teeth, but with the palace master pointing the High Firmament Divine Sword at him, he didn’t dare to move.

“Chen-er…”

Just then, a weak voice rang out and Long Zhantian slowly sat up on his bed.

Long Zhantian was emaciated, but that didn’t cover up the thrumming heroic air around him. When he saw Long Chen, his lifeless, bloodshot eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Dad…”

Long Chen was delighted to see his father wake up, his voice filled with emotion. He couldn’t stop himself from crying.

This was his father. They had the same blood flowing in their veins. Seeing him wake up, Long Chen was filled with emotion.

“Good child. I knew that we would meet again one day, hahaha… cough…”

Long Zhantian started laughing but then had an intense coughing fit. His body was incredibly weak at the moment.

“Dad, the Long clan has harmed you. I will erase the Long clan from this world for you.” Long Chen was enraged by Long Zhantian’s condition

After his coughing fit settled, Long Zhantian said, “Chen-er, undo your technique.”

“Dad?” Long Chen stared at Long Zhantian in disbelief.

“Release it. Your dad wants to tell you something,” said Long Zhantian before coughing once more.

Long Chen then looked from the Long clan’s experts to his coughing father. He wanted to immediately unleash this attack and kill these brutes, but ultimately, he undid his flame lotus and came to Long Zhantian’s side.

He carefully supported Long Zhantian’s body and gave him a medicinal pill. Long Zhantian’s complexion improved significantly after taking the pill. His coughing stopped, and he appeared to regain some of his vitality.

“Chen-er, I missed you. Let me take a good look at you.” Long Zhantian slowly stood. He then pressed his hands on Long Chen’s shoulders, eyeing him. His voice was also choked with emotion.

Long Chen and Long Zhantian had endured endless trials and tribulations to reunite after being separated when Long Chen was just a baby. The journey had been filled with hardships, making it feel like an entire lifetime had passed.

“Dad, forgive this child for being unfilial and letting you suffer…” Long Chen also wept. Was he even a man? He had long since known that his father was in the Long clan, but he only came to save him now. His father had been suffering this entire time. He hated the Long clan for their viciousness, but he also hated himself for his powerlessness. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This little bit of suffering is nothing. You must have suffered far more. It was me who let you down and didn’t protect you well.” Long Zhantian hugged his son with all his power, his tears flowing without restraint. After patting his son’s back, Long Zhantian squeezed out a smile. “Child, today is our reunion. We should be happy, not crying.”

Long Chen nodded and wiped away his tears. He was finally seeing his father once more, feeling like he had found his mental support again.

“Dad, did that old ghost erase your memories? It seems that they did something to you,” said Long Chen. He suddenly recalled a fragment of that elder’s soul. It was about how that elder had extracted Long Zhantian’s essence blood a while ago and seemed to have erased his memories. When Long Chen saw that, he instantly went crazy and wanted to destroy the entire Long clan.

Long Zhantian smiled slightly. “My cultivation realm might not be high, but I still have some self-preservation abilities. Otherwise, how could we reunite once more?”

After saying that, Long Zhantian turned to the patriarch, and his smile instantly vanished.

“Long Tianyao, do you still remember what I said to you back then?”
