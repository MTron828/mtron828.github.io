Chapter 4313: Humanless World, Primal Chaos Eye

“What is it?” asked Long Chen.

“Here’s an image from a formation that I set up. Take a look,” said Xia Chen as he summoned a screen of light.

The screen showed an image of a group of figures. It was impossible to sense their auras from this image, but based on their forms, they should be from the demonic beast race.

“Are they all Immortal Kings?” asked Guo Ran in surprise.

Although the three of them couldn’t sense their auras, they could see the Immortal King divine radiance on the back of the demonic beasts’ heads.

The scene changed, and another group of experts with a bloody light around their bodies appeared. Even through this image, Long Chen could sense that they were incredibly powerful.

The scene continued to change. In the end, the three of them saw experts wrapped in black qi. They looked similar to the Netherworld’s experts, but since it was just an image, Long Chen couldn’t confirm it.

“This is interesting. They’re all Immortal Kings but view us as prey to hunt down as a trial,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Xia Chen had set up formations all around the place to keep an eye on the surroundings. Unexpectedly, the experts of this world had quite the confidence and actually dispatched Immortal Kings after them.

“Boss, let me deal with them!” Guo Ran was itching to test himself against these experts. He wanted to see just how powerful the experts who grew up here were.

“No need. We’ll keep searching for treasures. If we run into them, we’ll test them. If we don’t, we won’t waste time searching for them,” said Long Chen. Hearing this, Guo Ran and Xia Chen nodded. Although they wanted to test these experts, becoming rich was their priority.

The three of them continued to search through the ruins of the human race. The next spot was a very small sect, and they only got a few low grade spirit stones, bone books, and some medicinal pills.

Although they didn’t gain much, it still made them feel hopeful. Those bone books in particular could be properly studied in the future.

After going through this place, they went to the next spot and coincidentally ran into one of the hunting parties, a group of over ten demonic beasts, on the way. The moment they spotted the three of them, their eyes lit up, and they directly attacked.

BOOM!

Guo Ran faced their leader, and with a single punch, Guo Ran was sent tumbling back. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The armor on Guo Ran’s fist was now deformed. It turned out that this expert’s physical body was even stronger than his battle armor.

Meanwhile, Xia Chen skillfully wove intricate hand seals, releasing talismans that soared through the air like delicate flower petals. Upon making contact with the pursuing experts, these talismans detonated in explosive bursts.

Xia Chen’s talismans were incredibly powerful, capable of inflicting severe injuries or even killing Heaven Venerates if they were struck. However, while these experts were being blasted back and roaring furiously, they weren’t badly wounded.

“Fuck, what are they?! How are they so powerful?!”

Guo Ran roared furiously as he fought their leader, his battle armor badly damaged.

“Idiot, my Heavenly Bone Mammoth race slaughtered you all in the battle back then, and the bones of your Eternal experts are still hung in front of our totemic pillar! How can you not recognize us?” sneered their leader.

That demonic beast was repeatedly forcing Guo Ran back with his fists, shocking Guo Ran. He wasn’t a match for this demonic beast.

“Are you the strongest expert of your generation?” shouted Guo Ran as he dodged.

“Only an idiot would say something so dumb. I am ranked seventh within our Heavenly Bone Mammoth race’s King realm, and within this humanless world, there are countless existences stronger than me. You really are frogs at the bottom of a well,” sneered that expert.

The Mammoth race? Long Chen nodded inside. It was no wonder he was so powerful. After all, the Mammoth race always specialized in power.

“I am really lucky to have run into you. All the higher-ups have declared that whoever kills you will receive a spot in the primal chaos eye’s baptism. Haha, I didn’t think it would be so easy!” laughed an expert from the Heavenly Bone Mammoth race.

“Stop wasting time and end this quickly. Don’t let anyone snatch the spot from us!” shouted their leader.

Following that, they all summoned their manifestations, and illusory figures of enormous mammoths appeared behind them. Those people’s auras got stronger dozens of times.

“Die!”

Their leader bellowed and thrust his fist at Guo Ran, causing the space to contort around it. However, just as the attack was about to land, a hand covered in golden dragon scales intercepted the punch. Long Chen had finally joined the fray.

Long Chen's Blood Qi surged like an endless sea. As he effortlessly caught the incoming fist, he stared at the demonic beast leader with a mocking look.

“You dare to say such arrogant words with just this little bit of power?”

Feeling shocked, the expert summoned dazzling runes all over him, and his muscles instantly bulged, causing his power to roar like a tsunami. However, no matter what he did, he couldn’t withdraw his fist from Long Chen’s grasp.

“What mammoth? In front of a dragon, you’re an ant," Long Chen snorted.

“AH!”

The Heavenly Bone Mammoth expert screamed as his arm was forcibly ripped off by Long Chen.

Following that, with a point of his finger, Long Chen unleashed a ray of seven-color divine light that pierced the expert’s head. His corpse then fell and transformed into a giant mammoth.

"With the dragon blood transforming into dragon tendons, my dragon power has become even more concentrated. I’ve advanced one more step in the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. Now I wonder if there’s anyone in the same realm who can beat me in terms of physical strength?” Long Chen was overjoyed as he sensed the powerful dragon energy roaring inside him.

With the Seven Peak Sword, Long Chen slaughtered the remaining experts of the Heavenly Bone Mammoth race. He was done in an instant.

Long Chen then waved his hand, tossing their corpses into the primal chaos space’s black soil.

“There are more people coming. Let’s go.”

Xia Chen took out his formation disc. Within the span of a single breath, the spatial disturbances subsided, and the formation disc gleamed with energy, whisking the three of them away.

Just a breath after their departure, countless figures came charging in from every direction, but they were one step too late. Except for the spilled blood on the ground, there was nothing left at the scene.
