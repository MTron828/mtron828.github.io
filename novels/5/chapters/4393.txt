Chapter 4382 Matters of the Main Academy

Long Chen’s gaze was as sharp as a blade as he swept it over the crowd. A few people who had guilty consciences didn’t dare to look at him directly.

The execution of those traitors shocked them, especially those who had thought that Long Chen would be swayed by public opinion and unable to do anything to them.

Long Chen coldly said, “I know there are more of you who have been bought by the other races. You’re absolutely right. Every person has the right to make their own choices in life, as everyone is pursuing a better life for themselves. However, your freedom to choose cannot be above other people’s pain and suffering. Selling out other people’s lives as gambling chips for profit; killing people and taking their fortune—did you really think that joining the other races would exempt you from all laws and justice? Keep dreaming. Since you’ve already done what you’ve done, there’s nothing left to say. I’ll just warn you that such deeds always exact a bloody price.”

Long Chen’s words were icy and merciless, akin to a judge’s verdict. Hearing this, the traitors among the crowd felt a cold chill.

“You traitors of the human race, just wait for your trials. The High Firmament Academy will create an alliance among the major sects to systematically root out those who betray our kind. Everyone, keep an eye on each other. I believe that the traitors are a minority, and anyone who dares to run will be swiftly beset by attacks from all sides,” shouted Long Chen.

Numerous experts applauded upon hearing this announcement. After all, traitors were the most hateful existence in any era. They were arrogant when their backings came in full force, causing harm to their own side by spreading rumors to manipulate public sentiment.

However, some people didn’t dare to rashly confront them because they didn’t know the future fate of the world. They were wary of acting impulsively, fearing they could become the next target. However, hearing that those traitors would be rooted out and dealt with, some people clapped so loudly that their hands hurt.

Some individuals directly began pointing fingers at some groups, accusing the latter as traitors and dogs of the other races. Some were even ready to unsheathe their blades and take direct action against them.

However, Long Chen had made it clear that these traitors would undergo an investigation and trial, preventing anyone from taking revenge independently. After all, they also feared the potential for false accusations driven by personal grievances.

The accused individuals lowered their heads, not daring to say a word. They directly gave up resisting, kneeling remorsefully.

However, no one pitied them. They had harmed countless people during this period and had never had pity on their targets.

Orders quickly spread throughout the world, and the human race’s experts went out in full power to lock down the traitorous sects and families, preventing them from running.

The number of traitors was surprisingly low, and there were maybe only be two or three traitorous factions among a hundred sects. The majority were actually principled, while some factions had merely observed from the sidelines. After all, only a few brainless fellows would join the other side for some tiny benefits without fully understanding the situation.

The traitors found themselves completely isolated. Given their outnumbered status, attempting to flee was nothing short of a fool's dream.

However, dealing with the traitors was a much more arduous process, so Long Chen would not participate in that. He trusted the High Firmament Academy to handle that well.

When the chaos finally settled, Long Chen added, “When it comes to the palace master having mercy, I have a few things to say.”

The crowd instantly went silent, wanting to hear Long Chen’s opinion.

“Previously, someone said that greater the power, the greater the responsibility. I really dislike this principle. This is purely an attempt to control people through morality. If this was said by the palace master, it would be no problem. However, the flavor changed when other people said it. First of all, the palace master was the one fighting, and so he had the right to kill them or let them go. We have no right to criticize him either way. After all, his power was earned through his own diligence, not granted by us. What right do we have to force him to act according to our will?”

The crowd was silent. No matter what, letting those two terrifying existences still made them extremely unhappy.

“Second of all, the palace master is not part of the human race. You cannot judge him according to our standard. In truth, in the eyes of the prideful dragon race, our human race is no different from those other races. In fact, we might be worse. At the very least, their side was united when it counted, while we…” Long Chen eyed the traitors disdainfully.

Only after Long Chen had said this did they recall that the palace master was no human, and so he had no duty to think of the human race.

Looking at the traitors, every person felt ashamed. Perhaps in the palace master’s eyes, the human race was an extremely loathsome existence.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

For him to help them was a favor, not duty. Hence, questioning his actions was truly spitting on his kindness. Upon reflection, they had the urge to dig a hole for themselves.

As a result, people's resentment toward the palace master waned, replaced by a deep sense of guilt.

“Dean Long Chen, we were indeed foolish. Please help us apologize to the palace master later,” said an elder.

Long Chen shook his head. “There is no need for an apology. I believe the palace master has seen through the situation long ago, which is why he departed without saying much."

However, this response only intensified their feelings of guilt, leaving them at a loss for words.

“It seems that the humanless world will be silent for some time, so everyone can focus on cultivation. We will deal with the traitors. Even if it’s just killing the chicken to warn the monkeys, it is still meaningful. Some individuals need to learn the repercussions of their actions and what it means to be a human." After uttering these words, Long Chen departed with his people.

Long Chen had no need to concern himself with the fate of the traitors, as they would undoubtedly be handed over to the High Firmament Academy. Furthermore, their sentencing would not be determined solely by the academy, but by virtuous experts of esteemed reputation chosen by various factions.

Having just fought an intense battle, Long Chen and the others were exhausted. The confrontation with the red-haired monster, in particular, had been extremely taxing, resulting in injuries to their souls. If they didn’t rest, these injuries would likely become irreparable wounds.

They returned to the academy with weariness in every step. Their previous excitement had dissipated, crushed under the overwhelming might of the red-haired monster. It had dealt a significant blow to the morale of the Dragonblood Legion.

However, upon their return, they saw someone running out to speak to them.

“Dean Long Chen, we’ve just received word. You must hurry back to the main academy in the Darklight Heaven.”

“Did something happen in the main academy?” Long Chen inquired, a sense of shock evident in his voice.
