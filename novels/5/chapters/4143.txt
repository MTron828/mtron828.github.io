Chapter 4132 Great Desolate Winged Devil

Long Chen and his companions joined the Fullmoon race’s entourage. But since the latter didn’t have a flying boat, they used a silver war chariot to travel instead.

The war chariot sped through the void, its runes shining brightly. As they zoomed past the surroundings, a large silver crescent moon twinkled. This was the mark of the Fullmoon race.

Fortunately, the Fullmoon race possessed immense prestige, so wherever they went, other races got out of their way.

“Brother Changchuan, the current you have completely transformed. You’re actually a true Supreme,” said Long Chen with a smile after sensing the vast energy fluctuations inside Xu Changchuan’s body.

“Hehe, it’s all thanks to brother Long’s blessing. I’ve managed to merge my three Supremes and awaken the ancestral manifestation. The race leader even said that I’d at least have some ability to fight an innate Heaven Venerate rather than being instantly crushed,” said Xu Changchuan excitedly.

After coming out of seclusion, his body had undergone a complete transformation. After all, while he was unconscious, the Fullmoon race had used all their resources on him to help him awaken his three Supremes.

Fortunately, Xu Changchuan didn’t let down the Fullmoon race. He managed to become a Triple Supreme and then merge his Supremes, turning him into a true Supreme expert.

Because of this, despite being merely in the great circle of the Immortal King realm, within the Fullmoon race, he stood as the most formidable figure, second only to Xu Jianxiong.

Furthermore, all of this only developed after he ran into Long Chen. Thus, he was very grateful to Long Chen.

However, Xu Changchuan wasn’t the only one. The entire Fullmoon race practically revered Long Chen like a god.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In just a few months, with the medicinal pills that Long Chen provided, the Fullmoon race’s power had soared. Their bloodline divine abilities manifested in droves, and the potential hidden deep within their bloodline was constantly excavated.

During this time, the Fullmoon race had managed to produce over thirty Heaven Venerates and six hundred Earth Venerates, as well as tens of thousands of Mortal Venerates.

Most importantly, their new generation of disciples was constantly blooming. It could be said that the current Fullmoon race was completely different from before.

Thus, Xu Jianxiong decided to come out in full power. One reason was to help Long Chen and Xu Changchuan, while the other reason was to display the Fullmoon race’s power. He planned to scare off some disrespectful brats.

While the Sage King Convention was active, essentially no large-scale wars could erupt. Otherwise, the Heavenly Daos would be displeased and bring down their retribution.

Of course, personal conflicts would not be kept track of by the Heavenly Daos. As for battles between Immortal King disciples? Even if there was a large-scale slaughter of them, the Heavenly Daos would not bring forth their misfortune.

Every time the Sage King Convention was held, the experts of the senior generation were mostly only there to maintain face; rarely would they actually fight.

After all, there weren’t that many fools like the Soaring Dragon Company who lost control and actually tried to kill Long Chen.

It had to be known that if they did kill Long Chen, then even if the Sage King Convention had not actually started, it would still be easily sensed by the Heavenly Daos. After that, the killer might face a lifetime of misfortune for the rest of their short life.

The misfortune of the Heavenly Daos was an extremely terrifying thing, for it showed no discrimination based on one's status or level of cultivation. In the end, bad luck would still strike you, and you could lose your life at any moment.

Thus, every time the Sage King Convention was held, it was always a battle between disciples. Heaven Venerates could not participate unless they had no other choice. Even if they did, they would not kill anyone.

“What is that?”

Xia Chen and the others suddenly stood when they saw an enormous figure who was so tall that their body stretched into the clouds.

It was a winged monster kneeling on the ground. A spear jutted from its back, mercilessly anchoring it to the ground.

Even while kneeling, its body was mostly hidden by the clouds. As for that spear, it appeared particularly large and bold. This whole spectacle was incomparably shocking.

“That is the Great Desolate Winged Devil. It has been millions and millions of years since it was stabbed to death here. But as it possesses an Eternal body, although it’s already dead, its body can resist the corrosion of time,” said Xu Jianxiong.

When the Silver Moon War Chariot reached this area, they saw countless people gathered in the surroundings, all examining this corpse.

This corpse had been here for countless years. Its soul had probably reincarnated countless times, yet its old body remained here.

It was a sight that shocked countless people, but while this corpse was from a Great Desolate Winged Devil, the master of the spear was unknown. People didn’t even know what race they were from.

“Let’s take a look. Experiencing the pressure of an Eternal expert is a good thing. However, don’t get too close, or its Eternal aura might curse you,” said Xu Jianxiong.

All the experts from various races were thinking of the same thing. They all wanted to experience the pressure of an Eternal expert.

The Heaven Venerates in particular wanted to sense it at least once, even if they themselves had no hope of ever reaching that realm.

As the Silver Moon War Chariot traversed, the people made way for them. They knew that the Fullmoon race was not easy to provoke.

The chariot then stopped a hundred thousand miles from the Great Desolate Winged Devil. But even at such a great distance, everyone in the chariot could sense a terrifying pressure.

Standing here, they felt space twisting around them. It felt like the wings of this figure were covering the sky. They felt small, while the aura of the Great Desolate Winged Devil was magnified.

This seemed to be a dividing line. It was like there was an invisible wall blocking most people outside.

However, there were quite a few people beyond it, gradually getting closer to the corpse. These people were true experts capable of resisting the pressure.

“Children, see how far you can go. But don’t force it. If you feel like your soul is about to tear, return immediately or you will be cursed. Although our Fullmoon race’s ancestral spirit can resolve curses, the pain isn’t something that you can imagine. Furthermore, removing the curse will probably cost you half your life. At the time, you won’t be able to participate in the Sage King Convention. Don’t cause trouble,” said Xu Jianxiong.

Hearing that, the disciples of the Fullmoon race jumped out excitedly. This could be considered another kind of trial. The closer they got to the corpse, the stronger they would be.

Youngsters were always competitive, so they got out of the war chariot excitedly. But the moment they stepped past the invisible barrier, their expressions changed as the wild pressure crashed down on them like a tsunami. Some people barely took a step before being driven out by that terrifying pressure.

The most terrifying thing was that this pressure contained boundless resentment and killing intent, shaking their souls. Quite a few people looked pale with terror.

This result caused the expressions of some of the seniors of the Fullmoon race to grow unsightly. These children didn’t have strong enough wills.

However, they were gratified to see that these disciples didn’t give up. They simply clenched their teeth and continued, pressing forward through the fear, doing their best to resist their instincts.

“Let’s go.”

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan walked shoulder to shoulder, stepping through the barrier together.
