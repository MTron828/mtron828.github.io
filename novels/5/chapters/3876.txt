Chapter 3865 Pointers

“Are you prepared?”

Luo Zichuan stopped a few miles from the gate and looked at Long Chen.

Long Chen nodded and took a deep breath.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After that, his seven-color divine ring appeared behind him, and the seven colors flowed smoothly. This immense power then tore at the dome of the heavens. The void was squeezed by this power to the point that the laws of this world rumbled.

Luo Zichuan looked at the violet color in Long Chen’s divine ring. After that, the slightest ripple appeared in his eyes, and his expression became a bit complicated.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

In front of Luo Zichuan, Long Chen didn’t conceal anything. He shouted and seven stars lit up on his divine ring. All of Long Chen’s power was unleashed.

Like a volcano erupting, Long Chen’s power instantly reached its peak. If it was before, Long Chen would have to activate each star one by one. But after his fight with Long Aotian, he had mastered his new power and could directly unleash it without worrying about his body not being able to bear it.

A starry sea appeared in his divine ring, containing 108,000 shining stars. A starry sea also appeared in the sky as if the cosmos had descended into the dome of the heavens.

Luo Zichuan was finally moved. Long Chen’s power was even greater than he had expected.

“Your potential is truly astonishing. Unfortunately, your violet qi is lacking. If you had the assistance of our Luo family’s violet blood, your power would at least rise by ten times. Your control would also be a hundred times greater.” Luo Zichuan looked at the raging violet qi in the starry sea and sighed regretfully.

As a peak expert, he instantly saw through Long Chen’s shortcomings. Although Long Chen’s aura was powerful and astonishing, his full power was still leaking.

Although Long Chen himself felt that he was under complete control of this new power, in Luo Zichuan’s eyes, this level of control wasn’t worth anything.

“If your control is lacking, then your actual power will be reduced by at least half. When you unleash your power, the compression of the laws and spatial resistance will silently grind away the majority of it. Imagine your full-power attack is striking countless pellets. Even those light collisions will disperse most of your power. That is especially true the moment your power is unleashed. Even if only a trace is leaked, it will greatly reduce the full eruption of your power. Show me one of your attacks!” said Luo Zichuan.

Long Chen slashed his saber. The void shook and a giant saber-image tore through heaven and earth, cutting a bottomless ditch in this world.

After seeing this, Luo Zichuan shook his head. “You only have power but no control. It seems that I taught you last time for nothing. Although the Heavenly Daos had some rejection of you last time, it wasn’t the full Heavenly Daos. Last time, you already grasped the feeling, but now that feeling is gone. Your power has grown, and you’ve started suppressing the Heavenly Daos once more. The Heavenly Daos have now become the resistance. It is like you are swinging your saber in water. The greater your power, the greater the resistance.”

“I understand.”

Long Chen was a bit ashamed. He then closed his eyes and focused on himself. After a moment, he once more slashed his saber.

This attack contained the same amount of power behind it. However, the rumbling sound was much quieter, and it was slightly faster. After that, another bottomless ditch appeared in the ground. It was much thinner than before.

Luo Zichuan nodded. “Your comprehension ability is good. A single pointer is enough for you, and that last attack was not bad. However, against the corpse devils that we’re about to fight, it’s still not enough. If you cannot kill your target in a single attack, we will have to retreat. They won’t give us another chance. This seal will instantly heal the injured corpse devils, returning them to the seal. They’ll then come back out at full power.”

Long Chen gasped. This seal not only had restrictions for any incomers’ cultivation bases, but it also had such recovery abilities? It was absolutely monstrous.

“Long Chen, you don’t have violet blood energy, so you cannot reach the point of absolute control. But your Spiritual Strength is very powerful. When you attack, don’t look at your target. Just focus your mind on the edge of your blade. That will reduce the amount of energy leaked. This kind of attack won’t work on other enemies. But at this moment, it will have the greatest effect. Try it!”

Long Chen acted according to Luo Zichuan’s pointers, and his mind sank into the edge of his saber. He then ignored everything else and slashed his saber, producing only a light sound in the void. It was like a thin piece of paper being sliced in two.

After that, a thirty-meter ditch appeared in the ground. His first attack had left a giant ditch many miles wide, the second ditch was about a few miles wide, and this one was about thirty meters wide. From this, Long Chen instantly understood.

The more concentrated his power, the greater damage it could cause. When Luo Zichuan killed these lifeforms, he also used such a method. It was clear from the wounds he had left behind on them.

Luo Zichuan’s power was highly concentrated. Even runes, scale armors, and bones were unable to cause his power to disperse. That was what resulted in those wounds that looked like sliced tofu.

Furthermore, according to Luo Zichuan, as long as Long Chen possessed violet blood, his control would increase a hundred times. Even if he didn’t reach that level, he wouldn’t be that far off.

“Fuck, Long Aotian, just wait! I’m only leaving my things with you for now! When the time comes, I’ll take everything back plus interest!” Long Chen now thirsted for his violet blood even more.

Only now did he know just how terrifying his violet blood was. It wasn’t just the violet blood, but there was also his seven-color Supreme Blood, along with his Spirit Root and Spirit Bone.

“Fuck, why am I even working so hard? As long as I take back what’s mine, I’ll instantly be unrivaled. Would I need to do all this?”

Long Chen’s random train of thought was broken by Luo Zichuan. “Because you focused your entire mind on it, your Spiritual Strength was concentrated on the edge of your saber. But like this, you won’t be able to lock onto your target. So, before we attack, you have to make a mark on where your saber is to land to avoid missing. That’s no problem, right?”

“No problem,” assured Long Chen. He had Huo Linger and Lei Linger, so there was no way he would miss.

“Then let’s start!”

Luo Zichuan took a single step forward. The instant he took that step, the eighteen totems lit up. Following that, eighteen enormous figures charged out.

The roars of demonic beasts shook their ears when these eighteen ominous demonic beasts opened their mouths at the same time. After that, they unleashed eighteen sharp swords of light at the two of them. The terrifying pressure made it impossible for Long Chen to move. He was fully locked down.

If he were to directly receive the combined attacks of eighteen Double Supreme Divine Venerates, would there be any chance of survival for him?

Just then, Luo Zichuan made his move. Forming hand seals, a violet blood shield condensed in front of him and smashed toward those eighteen rays of light.
