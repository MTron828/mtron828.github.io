Chapter 2181 A Specialist in Killing Wildly Arrogant People

With just one hand holding Evilmoon, Long Chen was able to stop Ximen Tianxiong. No matter how Ximen Tianxiong tried, he was unable to shake Long Chen.

To block the supreme genius of an everlasting family with just one hand, was that not wildly arrogant?

Long Chen smiled coldly. His voice resounded throughout the battlefield. “The true wildly arrogant people here are all of you. You’re so arrogant as to believe that whatever you say is an imperial decree, that whatever you say is true, that anyone who goes against you deserves death, that all others must bow to you, that even if you farted, others would have to cheer and say it smelled amazing. What is wild arrogance? This is wild arrogance. You don’t care about right or wrong, true or false. For personal profit, you can ignore the truth and attack me, ignoring the value of other people’s lives, trampling over other people’s dignity.”

Long Chen’s voice resounded through the air. Although he usually ignored how other’s vilified him, that didn’t mean that he didn’t get angry. He was human and he had feelings. Hence, now his fury was erupting.

“So, I’m not the one who’s wildly arrogant, it’s all of you. It’s not as if you’re not allowed to be arrogant, but remember this: don’t be arrogant in front of me because you aren’t qualified. I am a specialist in killing wildly arrogant people!”

BOOM!

Long Chen’s divine ring suddenly appeared behind him. Ximen Tianxiong felt a terrifying burst of energy, and he was sent flying.

“Scram!” Long Chen’s saber slashed behind him, blocking a lightning halberd. A wild burst of power unfurled, and Kun Pengzi was sent flying.

“What? Kun Pengzi was sent flying? Has Long Chen gotten so much stronger in this short time?” Startled cries rang out.

It was understandable that Dongfang Yuyang and Ximen Tianxiong had been blocked. They hadn’t summoned their manifestations, because as people with status, they were unwilling to be the first ones to unleash their full power when Long Chen was clearly holding back.

However, just now, Kun Pengzi hadn’t cared about such things and had summoned his Kunpeng manifestation. But even with his lightning halberd, he had been sent flying.

Before this, even with Mo Nian and Long Chen joining hands, they had been unable to keep Kun Pengzi behind. However, now Kun Pengzi was instantly forced back.

Long Chen’s divine ring caused the world to tremble. A faint blue color had appeared within the originally five-colored divine ring. Although it was still very faint, it truly made it so that this was no longer a five-colored divine ring, but a six-colored divine ring.

The six-colored divine ring filled heaven and earth. A will that looked down on the nine heavens appeared, a will that shook countless experts.

“Just when did this little brat get so powerful?” demanded Qu Jianying, shocked and delighted.

“Hehe, our Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s children can’t be weak. Ah, of course there was also the contribution of the Xuantian Dao Sect,” hastily added the old man.

Li Tianxuan merely smiled. “This is all Long Chen’s own efforts. It doesn’t have much to do with the Xuantian Dao Sect. Your way of nurturing him was much more important.”

Of everyone present, only Li Tianxuan knew Long Chen’s secrets. If Heaven-Defiers didn’t have the power to defy the heavens, then they wouldn’t be Heaven-Defiers.

What Li Tianxuan said was the truth. In truth, the actual help that the Xuantian Dao Sect had given Long Chen wasn’t much. The main thing was that the Xuantian Dao Sect didn’t have anything that Long Chen needed. In comparison, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s nine forms of Split the Heavens had been much more beneficial.

Due to not having anything Long Chen needed, all Li Tianxuan had been able to give Long Chen was his freedom. He was free to do what he wanted with their full support.

Li Tianxuan’s humility made it so that the old man was too embarrassed to be too pleased. On the other hand, Boss Bao and the others were cheering loudly.

Kun Pengzi’s expression changed. It had only been a month. How had Long Chen’s power risen by so much?”

“Kunpeng Voidbreaker, Raging Lightning Slash!” Kun Pengzi roared. The Kunpeng within his manifestation spread its wings, and endless lightning exploded, entering his halberd. He once more attacked Long Chen.

“Last time, I couldn’t do anything to you because I didn’t have the power of a divine item. I could only use my own power to block your divine item. Today, Evilmoon is awake, and I’m no longer fighting alone. Do you think you can still show off?” Long Chen had no intention of dodging Kun Pengzi’s full-force attack. The void rumbled as a giant black saber-image tore into the sky.

BOOM!

The saber-image crashed down like a river of stars, blasting apart the field of lightning around Kun Pengzi and striking his halberd. This time, blood dripped out of Kun Pengzi’s mouth as he was once more sent flying.

“What power! Little brother, you’re pretty handsome too. Let’s see if you can receive an attack from me.” A coarse woman’s voice rang out.

A black shooting star shot through the air. Xue Luocha was also joining in, and she held a giant meteor hammer in her hand. Spikes grew out of the hammer head.

Long Chen once more swung Evilmoon, but he was startled to find that this meteor hammer was incredibly heavy, as if it was made of a star. He was forced back several steps before stabilizing.

“Oh, how amazing! You are actually able to block my Shadow Meteor Hammer. You should know that this hammer was my father’s and was created by plucking astral metal from outside the world. For someone with such a small and weak-looking body, you have quite some power, little brother! What do you think about marrying me?” Xue Luocha smiled brightly at Long Chen, revealing her bloody mouth. Her smile did not improve her looks.

“I think you should find Mo Nian for that instead. His taste is heavier,” said Long Chen, a chill running down his spine at the thought.

Mo Nian cursed Long Chen in the crowd to express his innocence.

“Little brother, are you laughing at me for being fat?” Xue Luocha looked at Long Chen resentfully. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“No, not fat. Wide,” corrected Long Chen.

“Fine. Don’t blame me for being ruthless and smashing you to bits.” Xue Luocha’s expression instantly changed, and the meteor hammer flew through the air at Long Chen. Xue Luocha’s power was truly terrifying. The meteor hammer caused the void to explode wherever it passed.

“Xue Luocha is the result of the Blood Emperor’s blood mixing with the demon race. Not only has she inherited the Blood Emperor’s power, but she also has the body of a demonic beast. Apparently, the fatter she is, the greater her power. It is said that no one in this world is capable of receiving her attack with just pure power,” said one expert. Xue Luocha was a true monster, a monster that could no longer be called human.

BOOM!

Evilmoon hacked down like a bolt of lightning. Without any flashiness, Long Chen blocked Xue Luocha’s blow. Lightning flashed beneath his feet, and he appeared right next to Xue Luocha, slashing his saber at her jaw.

Normally, this attack would be aimed at his opponent’s neck, but Xue Luocha didn’t have a neck, so he just estimated.

“How vicious! You actually want to cut off my neck?” Xue Luocha let out a strange cry. It sounded like she was trying to sound like a cute damsel in distress. She raised her fleshy arm to block Evilmoon.

Evilmoon actually bounced off. At some point, a protective bracelet had appeared on her wrist, and Long Chen’s attack had landed on it. Unexpectedly, it was also a priceless treasure.

Long Chen’s expression didn’t change. He sent a kick to her face. At such close range, her giant hammer was ineffective.

Xue Luocha blocked with her arms, hence, Long Chen’s kick landed on her flesh. He felt like he had landed on cotton, and a portion of his power dissipated.

However, Xue Luocha was still forced a step back, giving her a chance to counterattack. But Long Chen appeared behind her, slashing with his saber.

Xue Luocha didn’t look back. She pulled on her meteor hammer and was dragged forward by its weight, avoiding Long Chen’s attack.

Although Xue Luocha looked plump like a meat mountain, her movements were very agile. Despite that, Long Chen’s rapid movements didn’t give her a chance to unleash her power.

“Are you competing in a martial tournament? Why waste everyone’s time?”

Tian Xiezi suddenly took out a giant tower that shattered the sky. It smashed down toward Long Chen.

“Be suppressed!”
