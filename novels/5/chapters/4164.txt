Chapter 4153: More Than One Can Bear

“Oh, the Long clan’s Eighth Elder. Feng Fei greets you.”

The newcomer was precisely the peerlessly beautiful Jiang Feng Fei. As soon as she walked in, she brought an air of grace and nobility into the entire room.

Feng Fei, on this particular day, was dressed in a golden imperial gown. She wore phoenix hairpins in her hair with tassels hanging from them, appearing particularly majestic today.

In an instant, the Long clan’s male disciples stared at her. Her beauty directly won them over.

As for the female disciples, while they were beautiful as well, in front of Feng Fei, they were like two featherless chickens standing next to a peacock. Whether it was in appearance or simply the air around them, they were a far cry from her.

Feng Fei didn’t come alone as she had an amiable-looking elder with her. When she greeted the Eighth Elder, the Eighth Elder’s expression instantly sank.

“What is the Jiang clan doing? Are you trying to steal someone from my Long clan?” demanded the Eighth Elder.

The elder beside Feng Fei smiled. “Eighth Elder misunderstands. This old man is only accompanying this child Feng Fei around. I heard Feng Fei say that she had a friend here, a dragon amongst men, a peerless hero. I was curious, so I just came to take a look.” The elder then turned to Long Chen and nodded. “Feng Fei was correct. You show great promise. Ordinary heavenly geniuses cannot compare to you. Feng Fei has told me that you had some trouble with our Jiang clan in the mortal world. As a representative of the Jiang clan, let me apologize to you. The fight on the Immortal Dao is one where there is no clear yardstick for right and wrong. I hope that we can put aside our differences and be friends.”

Long Chen was startled and looked at Feng Fei, who was smiling at him. She then winked at him with a seemingly profound meaning.

He didn’t know what drugs she was taking, but if this old man dared to say that he was a representative of the Jiang clan, his status couldn’t be ordinary.

Despite not knowing their true intentions, Long Chen put on a smile and said, “The past is in the past. I hope we can get off on the right foot here in the immortal world!”

The elder from the Jiang clan smiled and nodded. “To a good start. Hopefully, it starts with your junior generation. If a person cannot accept their mistakes, then they will be unable to keep up with the times. They won’t be able to communicate properly, and everything they do is always stubborn and rigid. Sometimes, old people should take a step back and leave things to the junior generation. Some people get old and their minds grow narrow. As a result, they spout more rubbish and less truth. To skip out on being arrogant and wild in your youth only to act that way when you are old really is immature. It also loses the face of the clan.”

“What do you think you’re saying?!” demanded the Eighth Elder. Those words were clearly targeting him.

“Eighth Elder, don’t be so emotional. I wasn’t talking about you. You’re still young after all. I was only talking about myself.” The elder from the Jiang clan continued, “This child Feng Fei is a good child. I really do like her. I hope that the family head will also come to view her favorably. Long Chen, if you need any help in the future, just tell Feng Fei. If we can help you, then our Jiang clan will do our best. After all, having more friends is like having more paths, while having more enemies is like having more walls. A person can’t hit themselves with a nail a hundred times without learning their lesson. Alright, people really do talk more when they’re old. Once you start, you just ramble on. Long Chen, we’ll bid you farewell for now. But my Jiang clan’s camp is not that far from here. If you have time, come pay us a visit. My Jiang clan will receive you warmly.”

The elder smiled, bowed to Xu Jianxiong, and then left with Feng Fei who was lending an arm to support him.

Feng Fei intentionally looked back at Long Chen and gave him a profound smile before leaving.

Once the two of them left the Fullmoon race’s camp, the elder’s stooped figure slowly straightened, and a light appeared within his turbid eyes. He no longer appeared as old as he had.

“You were right. This fellow is an extremely dangerous character. I tried to calculate his potential seven times and was unable to grasp even a trace,” said the elder solemnly.

Feng Fei smiled. “He really is frightening. Unfortunately, most people who come to grasp his terrifying nature meet their demise before comprehending it fully. Dead people cannot spread information, which is why there is always a group of idiots bothering him without realizing that they are offering their necks to the scythe of a grim reaper.”

Feng Fei suddenly changed the subject. “But I don’t understand something. Is the Long clan really not planning on pulling Long Chen into the Long clan? Why would they send someone as arrogant as the Eighth Elder? They could have sent someone wise and experienced, one of their upright Grand Elders. Are they trying to push him out?”

“Child, you’re still too young. This matter isn’t so simple, so let us just watch. But I really do hope to bring Long Chen to the Jiang clan. If he could become the Jiang clan’s son-in-law, that would be best,” said the elder.

Feng Fei blushed but quickly shook her head. “It’s impossible. Every single one of his women is not inferior to me, and they have all sworn to share the good and bad of life. Their relationship is deep.”

“You aren’t lacking in anything but an opportunity. Let’s go. Some things can’t be forced. Your talent is not inferior to anyone, but you lack ambition. Not being greedy enough is also dangerous. In the cruel immortal world, kindness without strength is a liability. Let alone the immortal world, even in the Jiang clan, conflicts are everywhere. Keep your edge sharp and be careful at all times,” warned the elder solemnly.

Feng Fei nodded. She and the elder slowly walked away. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

…

Before Feng Fei left, she smiled at Long Chen. That smile was like a spring breeze, refreshing the soul.

However, Long Chen didn’t feel anything. He could guess what Feng Fei’s goal in coming here was. But the four male disciples of the Long clan were still burning with jealousy.

Feng Fei didn’t even look at them, treating them as empty air. That was the greatest blow to them and their confidence. Hence, they were glaring at Long Chen with hatred.

“As a member of the Long clan, you actually collude with the Jiang clan? You are betraying the Long clan! Are you planning on using the Heaven Earth Cauldron as a chip to have them protect you? You really are trash! Let me say it clearly, we came here for the Heaven Earth Cauldron! You are a member of the Long clan, and everything you have belongs to the Long clan! Hand over the Heaven Earth Cauldron!” One of those four heavenly geniuses suddenly stood and pointed at Long Chen, cursing him furiously.

Long Chen finally couldn’t endure it any longer and slapped him in the face, directly blasting away his protective aura. Qi waves then exploded, blasting apart the tent that the Fullmoon race had set up.

As for the disciple that had cursed Long Chen, he was sent flying, his head almost exploded. He then smashed into the walls of the ruins in the distance. However, that wall was incredibly tough and seemed to be backed by some law. It didn’t even shake when he smashed into it. As a result, that disciple was like a meat pancake stuck to the wall, his body completely deformed.

It just so happened that Feng Fei and the elder hadn’t gone far, and this person was smashed into the wall in front of them.

Looking at this deformed heavenly genius of the Long clan, Feng Fei laughed excitedly.

“Hehe, I knew this would happen. Looks like there really is a show to watch!”
