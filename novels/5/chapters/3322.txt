The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was transcendent and unmatched. Her eyes were like rainbow gemstones capable of seeing through all the secrets within heaven and earth.

When she condensed in front of him, it was as if she had come from the distant past, yet also as if she had returned from far off in the future. Her beautiful eyes stared at Long Chen with a hint of surprise.

“Utmost good and utmost evil mixed together. Will you bring about this world’s destruction? Or rebirth?”

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy seemed to be asking him yet also seemed to be talking to herself. For a moment, Long Chen didn’t know how to respond.

After that, she ignored him. She knelt down and reached out to rub Huo Linger’s cheek, wiping away her tears.

“You were born because of him. You devoured the powers of countless flames to grow. I hope that you do not become a second Yan Xu[1] that brings calamity upon the immortal world.

Long Chen’s heart shook. For some reason, hearing the name Yan Xu alarmed him. He had never heard this name before, and yet it seemed that some far-off distant memory tried to reach him. However, he was unable to recall it.

Just the name alone was able to shake his heart. It was as if this name was forbidden, a taboo hiding some heaven-shaking matter.

“Big sister, we’re not bad people. We won’t do bad things,” said Huo Linger. Her pure and clear eyes contained a pure light.

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy eyed Long Chen. “I hope that is the case. I am here waiting for the new master of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame to appear. I thought that it would be you two, but when I saw you, fate became muddled, the future unclear. I have a feeling that you are not the next master of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. But even then, you should have immense karma between you.”

At this moment, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s expression grew solemn. She looked into Long Chen’s eyes. “You are the first person I am unable to see through. I feel both close to you and afraid of you. I don’t know why the High Firmament Academy would accept you, but I trust in the vision of that old senior. So I have decided to show you some secrets. However, if you see these secrets, you will be touched by their karma. Whether it’s a blessing or a disaster, no one can say. Do you still want to see them?”

Long Chen was shocked. For some reason, he felt a chill run over him. He felt that whatever the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy wanted to show him was extraordinary.

He had never sensed such pressure. It was like an entire star was crushing him. He felt like he would be crushed.

“Please, big sister.” Long Chen nodded. No matter how difficult the path was, he had to walk it to the end. There was no retreat for him.

“Alright.”

The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy nodded with a slight smile. That smile contained the slightest hint of praise.

As she vanished, Long Chen felt space shrink. He and Huo Linger began to rise higher and higher. The huge Heavenly Rainbow Statue then faded into a pinpoint, and Long Chen was floating high in the void. He saw more and more as he rose.

He saw countless stars, which spun in the air like grains of sand. Long Chen’s world was just one of the stars in this cluster of stars.

That wasn’t it though. He continued to rise higher and higher, and the star cluster also shrank until it was smaller and smaller.

At that point, he saw a cloud of stars. It was a nebula that seemed to split this world in two.

“Is this the wall of ascension? Something that separates the mortal world from the immortal world?” Long Chen stared at that nebula.

It didn’t matter how strong someone was, they wouldn’t dare to break this wall. This was a portion of the laws of the cosmos. As a result of this, the divine inheritances found in the mortal world could only be transmitted with faith energy.

As he found the starry sky shrinking, he suddenly noticed that other than his star cluster, there were other clusters as well.

It had to be known that Long Chen’s world was just a single one of the millions of stars in the cluster, but now there wasn’t just one such cluster. These nine clusters surrounded one giant star.

This one star was even bigger than any star cluster. Seeing this scene, Long Chen was stunned. A single star that was as big as millions of other stars? This image toppled his understanding of their cosmos.

Seeing the nine star clusters surrounding one star, Long Chen suddenly recalled countless other diagrams. Was this not the same as those ancient carvings?Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Nine heavens, ten lands? Nine star clusters as the nine heavens, and adding on that giant star, it becomes nine heavens, plus a tenth land? Is that what the saying means?” Long Chen was full of questions. He had heard the saying nine heavens and ten lands over and over again, but no one had ever explained the origin of these words.

The world continued to shrink around him. He saw clouds of stars around the nine star clusters, but they were different from the clusters. They were scattered. These stars were like an ocean so vast that it was impossible to reach the end.

Based on the current scene, Long Chen was standing within a vast ocean of stars. He felt incredibly miniscule. But the world continued to shrink, allowing him to see further and further. Suddenly, he saw a giant figure that made him jump. Just what was this gigantic form?

In that instant, he suddenly thought of the mysterious dragon expert. It had once shown Long Chen this world as well. But the viewpoint had been different.

BOOM!

Suddenly, his vision changed. He was standing above the nine star clusters before, but now he suddenly fell below them.

He saw a different world. This was a world of darkness. The other side of the stars was a sinister darkness. It was a hellish world.

Then Long Chen saw countless lifeforms flying from the dark worlds into the light worlds. Following that, the stars began to shatter, transforming into the dust of the cosmos.

Long Chen even saw countless black spots invade that huge star surrounded by the nine clusters.

Looking more closely at those black spots, he saw that they were actually terrifying lifeforms as large as the ordinary stars. They were crazily devouring that giant world.

Furthermore, it seemed that there were experts fighting back in that world. Unfortunately, it was too far for Long Chen to see clearly. He only saw countless black spots invading.

Following that, the scene once more changed. He saw a figure wielding a flame sword, fighting back countless terrifying lifeforms.

That figure was the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. She stood in the void, countless stars beneath her feet. When her sword slashed, it pierced the void, destroyed stars, and slew countless monsters.

Their black blood flew, dyeing the world black. Their limbs shattered stars. This scene truly left Long Chen stunned. He had never seen such a terrifying battle.

He had no idea what realm the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had reached, nor what realm these lifeforms had reached, but he knew that probably even World Kings would be directly killed by some shockwaves of this battle.

Just as the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was fighting off an endless tide of lifeforms, a chain pierced the void, shattering stars. This chain contained a terrifying flame energy. The shattered stars then ignited, bursting like fireworks. It was destructive and beautiful.

As a result, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy turned in the direction where the chain came from. Abandoning these lifeforms, she reached out her left hand to grab the chain. At the same time, the sword in her right hand transformed into a rainbow that fell in a certain place.

Half of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s body was destroyed by the chain attack. As for her rainbow sword, it tore through thousands of stars, shattering the void and revealing a large figure. That figure roared and fled, leaving behind an arm. That arm then transformed into a streak of light that ignited countless stars.

Just then, those lifeforms took advantage of her injury to attack.

What shocked Long Chen was that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy put away her sword and began to chant. When those words entered his ears, his heart pounded wildly.

“Nirvana Scripture!”
