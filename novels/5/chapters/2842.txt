Chapter 2831 Medicinal Field

The ceremony was complete, and Long Chen was in the spotlight. His name truly resounded throughout the God Institute now.

This time, the ceremony caused quite a stir within the God Institute, as so many people were revealed to be engaged in fraud. The entire investigator department would go through a thorough investigation, and anyone found to be participating in the fraud would face harsh penalties.

It was unknown just how many people were implicated. But in any case, the cheating this time had enraged the higher-ups of the God Institute.

The other matter that shook the God Institute was Long Chen’s wager with Heaven Master Yun Yang. He was taking over the Elite Group.

In order to not wear the robes of an instructor, Long Chen had made such a wager. At first, many people didn’t know what this Elite Group was. But no wall could block gossip.

Eventually, it was revealed that this Elite Group was composed of useless people who simply came to consume the academy’s resources.

They were a group of hedonistic disciples from rich parents throughout the nearby prefectures. They refused to learn, so they were sent here to ‘pursue their studies’. In truth, they were only here because their parents had paid the academy so much money.

These disciples didn’t even usually attend classes. Their families had paid thousands of times the tuition fee in order to let them stay here.

Their talent, aptitude, and cultivation bases weren’t bad, but that wasn’t their greatest attribute. Their greatest attribute was that they had money. Furthermore, they truly knew how to spend it.

The people in the Elite Group were special within the academy. They were like a bunch of pigs being raised. In other words, even newcomer disciples that had just passed the exams could easily defeat them because their combat power was as flimsy as a piece of paper.

These people weren’t that well known before, but after this ceremony, everyone knew of this curious group.

This Elite Group was viewed as a stain on the God Institute, but Heaven Master Yun Yang had still exposed them. The God Institute had accepted them because of their money, but also because they didn’t want to offend the various powers behind them. For Heaven Master Yun Yang to expose them showed that he possessed quite a bit of daring.

Many people were interested in whether or not Long Chen could really win such a wager. However, they were even more curious about why Long Chen felt such a desire not to wear the white instructor robes. It had to be known that those were clothes that countless people dreamed of being able to wear. It was a symbol of their status and position.

Furthermore, Long Chen had never worn anything other than his tattered black robes. Was he simply trying to show that he was different from other people? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was unknown just how many people throughout the God Institute were discussing this matter. But as for Long Chen, he was now in his private two-floor little house in the God Institute.

Although it wasn’t big, it was very refined. Compared to those people who squeezed into a single cave or people lying on beds that were like coffins, this was already a giant luxury.

After Long Chen was given his own house and twenty thousand immortal crystals, he returned to the Pill Institute and went to find the Seven Star Elder.

“I’ve heard what happened. Youngsters really have energy. It’s a good thing. But you actually even dragged me into it…” The Seven Star Elder looked at Long Chen with an odd smile.

Long Chen knew that the Seven Star Elder was referring to how he had used the latter’s name as a backer. Long Chen chortled, “I shouldn’t have used your name as a backer, but you also didn’t tell me just how special that status plate you gave me is, so we’re even, right? I’m here to return the money that you lent me and thank you.”

Long Chen returned the immortal crystals he had borrowed from the Seven Star Elder. He was truly grateful to him. Although this money was nothing to the Seven Star Elder, it had been necessary for Long Chen.

In the High Firmament Academy, without any money, it was difficult to advance a single step. But just by borrowing the money for the registration fee, Long Chen took a giant leap forward. His future path was fully opened, and the key to that was the unremarkable money that the Seven Star Elder had lent him.

The Seven Star Elder nodded and put away the immortal crystals. “You are now an instructor of the God Institute. Furthermore, Heaven Master Yun Yang has a high opinion of you. Will you still be a disciple of the Pill Institute?”

Long Chen smiled. “I am a dual cultivator. I am an alchemist and a martial artist. The two sides will support each other, so I will have to run back to the Pill Institute quite a bit. However… the things in the Pill Institute are too expensive. I wonder if I can have a discount? On the way back, I bought a pill furnace, three of the lowest grade immortal flames, as well as some basic medicinal ingredients. Now I’m broke again.”

Just mentioning this made Long Chen feel aggrieved. The Pill Institute’s disciples were given the most money, but the Pill Institute put the price of everything extremely high. That was why he couldn’t buy whatever he wanted.

“You bought three low grade immortal flames? Why?” asked the Seven Star Elder. Most people would only buy a single immortal flame seed. The price for those was rather high, so it made sense why he would be broke after buying three.

“I have a use for them, but it’s not convenient for me to tell why. May I know if there is a way for disciples to buy medicinal wares at a discounted price?” asked Long Chen, not wanting to lie but also not wishing to say that he had bought them to nourish Huo Linger.

“The Pill Institute’s disciples must contribute to the Pill Institute in order to enjoy a discount. Newcomers are usually unable to reach the necessary levels. In this regard, our rules are different from the God Institute,” answered the Seven Star Elder.

Long Chen nodded. Sects did not exist to be charities, so resources were given to those who contributed. In other words, only if you could make a profit for the academy would the academy’s resources fall into your hands easier.

“What is it? Do you have something you need? You can tell me. If it isn’t against the rules of the Pill Institute, I don’t mind helping you a bit,” said the Seven Star Elder.

“I need the ingredients for many Mortal Ascension Pills, but the money I have on hand isn’t enough to buy them. I’m impatient to expel all my mortal qi…”

The Seven Star Elder frowned. “I don’t have such low tier medicinal herbs.”

These kinds of introductory medicinal ingredients were things that a high tier alchemist like the Seven Star Elder hadn’t touched in years. With his status, a single word could bring in a flood of these low tier medicinal ingredients, but that would be cheating for Long Chen and was not in accordance with the rules. Just like the God Institute, the Pill Institute cared about not breaking its rules.

“I know. Asking you for help with such a thing is inappropriate. As a Pill Institute’s disciple, don’t I have to go to the medicinal field once every three months to work? I was wondering if you could send me in advance so I could gain some experience with those ingredients. If I have a chance, I could even go hunting outside and pick a few herbs for my own use. That should be no problem, right?” asked Long Chen.

“That is naturally no problem. You can just go tomorrow. If you’re in a rush, I can send you today as well.” The Seven Star Elder smiled.

“Haha, then I want to go right now. Many thanks, Elder!”

Long Chen laughed and sped off. His sudden reaction was so fast that it caught the Seven Star Elder off guard. What he didn’t know was that Long Chen was precisely waiting for this.
