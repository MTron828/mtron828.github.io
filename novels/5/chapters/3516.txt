Chapter 3505

A third Heavenstage World King of the Soaring Dragon Company was struck by Long Chen just as the void shattered, leaving him with no room to unleash his power. He was injured by Long Chen’s attack.

“Are you alright?”

The other third Heavenstage World Kings hastily came up to him.

“I’m fine, but that damn bastard got away again,” said that World King hatefully.

“This Long San is too slippery. We can’t catch him.”

The other World Kings felt helpless. They had rushed over as soon as they received the information and had even used fixed transportation talismans to prepare to capture Long Chen instantly. However, he had still sensed it and struck first.

Fortunately, the four of them had arrived together. If it was just one or two, they might have been in danger of being killed.

“What are you looking at?! Scram!”

Seeing these people staring at them in shock, that injured elder was enraged and barked at them.

“This place isn’t your Soaring Dragon Company. Who do you think you are to push people around? No wonder the Soaring Dragon Company’s reputation can never reach the level of the Huayun Trading Company no matter how much business they do,” snorted a World King.

Who didn’t have a temper? The Soaring Dragon Company, no matter how powerful they were, were still businessmen. Businessmen had to be amiable and courteous. Otherwise, what business would you get from others?

This elder infuriated all of them with just a few words. This was the Chaotic Star Sea, and this place was the ruins of the Starry River Palace. No one had the right to push people around here.

The elder was simply driven crazy by Long Chen. He had even coughed up blood from being injured, and it was only due to this anger that he shouted at those spectators. He had forgotten that they weren’t here to watch and laugh at him. They were originally here.

“Everyone, our apologies. This Elder was hoping to capture a murderer and thief, but we ended up letting him get away. Everyone, don’t be tricked by that Long San. He is from the Darklight Heaven, and when our Soaring Dragon Company kindly ferried him over, he actually repaid kindness with enmity, slaughtering the millions of experts on the ship and even plundering our wealth. He is incredibly evil, so much that there is no describing it. My Soaring Dragon Company has announced a bounty on him. Anyone who helps us find his trail will be bestowed one million immortal king crystals. But if someone can kill him, we will immediately pay you three hundred million immortal king crystals and a World Domain divine item. You would also become the highest level V.I.P. of our Soaring Dragon Company. Everyone, if you find any clues, remember to inform our Soaring Dragon Company. Thank you!”

The four of them flew off in the direction where Long Chen had gone. Clearly, they were pursuing him.

However, they also knew that with his speed, even if they used the blood evasion art, they wouldn’t be able to catch up. They were just doing this for everyone to see.

“Long San? So he’s that Boss Long San!” A startled cry rang out. Those who paid attention to the news had all heard that a person was plundering the Soaring Dragon Company, and that this person called himself Boss Long San.

“Hmph, the Soaring Dragon Company is nothing good. Just how selfless is Boss Long San? He shared a priceless treasure like the Starry River of the Sky Art with all of us! How can he be someone greedy for other people’s wealth?”

“That’s right, if he was such an evil person, would he have gone to such efforts to teach us? As long as he said that he was auctioning the complete Starry River of the Sky Art, just how much money could he make?”

“Boss Long San said that all people who cultivate the Starry River of the Sky Art are aboveboard and righteous. Boss Long San is also a cultivator of the Starry River of the Sky Art, and his comprehension of it has reached an unimaginable level. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to answer so many of our questions. He’s a truly honorable man. In any case, I refuse to believe the Soaring Dragon Company. After all, they aren’t the Huayun Trading Company. Their characters aren’t worthy of trust.”

“Everyone, don’t forget Boss Long San’s instructions! We are all cultivators of the Starry River of the Sky Art. We can be considered as belonging to the same sect. Boss Long San helped us resolve all of our questions, so we have to work hard at cultivating to comprehend the true essence of the Starry River of the Sky Art as soon as possible. We will spread the branches of the starry river line and gather new disciples, or we wouldn’t live up to the efforts of the Starry River Sage!” said one elder passionately.

“That’s right, this senior apprentice-brother is right. Our starry river line can be considered as being from the same sect. The starry river line is one family!”

“You’re right, in the future, we won’t be alone. Brothers, I’m going into seclusion first. Let us meet again! If the starry river line is in trouble, I, Jiang He, swear to offer my life. Let us live and die together!”

“Live and die together!”

“Live and die together!”

“Live and die together!”

Hundreds of thousands of cultivators of the Starry River of the Sky Art cheered together. They had originally been like random pieces of sand, but they were merged together by Long Chen, becoming a solid block of steel. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They had previously been pitiful people with no future prospects, and Long Chen had given them their futures. Now, they could see light; they could see hope.

Many of them were people with similar characters and similar goals. They were no longer alone. At that moment, they found a new sense of belonging. They felt that the future was bright.

Even Long Chen didn’t know that his transmission of the Dao would silently change the nine heavens and ten lands. The Starry River of the Sky Art spread far and wide like a virus, reaching every corner of the world. He had planted countless seeds throughout the world, and they were silently germinating.

…

“I’ve really profited this time. The Starry River of the Sky Art was a cultivation technique that the Starry River Sage created based on enlightenment from the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. There’s an immense difference between the two, but it can still bring me endless enlightenment.”

Long Chen sat on a cliff all alone, looking at the river flowing in the distance. He had an excited expression.

He remembered the first time he encountered the Starry River of the Sky Art. There was a record that the Starry River Sage left behind no disciples. He supposedly only left this cultivation technique and no other legacy.

As expected, legends and rumors couldn’t be counted on. Now, Long Chen had obtained the key principle of the Starry River of the Sky Art. The areas that he hadn’t managed to figure out before were now clear to him.

With the Starry River of the Sky Art, first, the star diagram was condensed, and then with one star as a starting point, you would try forming a connection with the corresponding stars above the nine heavens, forming a resonance with their astral power.

Last time, Long Chen hadn’t understood and had tried to activate that astral power, almost killing himself. He then was warned and hadn’t dared to try it again.

Now, he could continue trying. Last time, it was because he had tried with the full power of his star diagram.

“I’m going to test it!”

As Long Chen slowly formed hand seals, one of his 108,000 stars quivered slightly. This was the star that had quivered when he had stepped onto the first stone step.

When this star quivered, amongst the endless stars above the nine heavens, a certain star formed a resonance with it and brightened.

“I found it!”

Following that, the two stars continued to resonate, and a mysterious energy formed a bridge.
