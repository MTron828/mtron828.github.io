Chapter 2523 Fighting Desperately to Survive

Arrows rained down upon the Black Armor Corps, and miserable cries rang out. The bodies of the Black Armor Corps emitted white smoke and began to corrode upon being struck by those arrows. In the end, they transformed into liquid.

“Long Chen, we’ve come to help!” Within the army came a Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle. Qi Li stood on its head with a bow in hand.

Behind Qi Li stood La Wei who was repeatedly shooting arrows, which pierced through multiple bodies with every shot. His killing power was many times greater than before.

BOOM!

Explosive sounds rang out as the Elders of the Luo Spirit race blocked the two divine generals.

As more and more of them joined in, it became a battle of the Luo Spirit race against the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps. The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were stunned, not understanding what was going on.

“Did they come to help Long Chen?”

“Are these lifeforms on the same side as Long Chen?”

“If Long Chen had such terrifying lifeforms on his side, why didn’t he summon them earlier and end the battle before this?”

Countless questions appeared within the heads of the experts watching.

Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and the others were all shocked. They hadn’t expected things to progress to this point. They knew of the Luo Spirit race, but they hadn’t known that they had such numbers and were so powerful.

“Qi Li, what’s going on?” asked Long Chen.

“Long Chen, you’re the prophesied son that we were waiting for. You’re the only hope for us to take back our mother tree and wipe away our disgrace!” cried out Qi Li excitedly.

“The prophesied son? The mother tree? This giant tree is…” Long Chen stared blankly.

“This tree is our mother tree, the mother of the Life Spirit God and the ancestral god of the Luo Spirit race. In the battle of the Star Field Divine World back then, countless races were destroyed. It was world-destroying, and our Luo Spirit race did not escape unscathed. At that time, we were almost wiped out. In order to protect us, the mother tree gave birth to the Life Spirit God’s seed. We had no choice but to leave with a portion of our people, enduring this humiliation and going into hiding. Once the battle was over and the Star Field Divine World was fractured, we returned to find the mother tree bound, becoming a tool for nourishing these evil fiends…”

Qi Li and La Wei’s eyes reddened. They viewed the mother tree like a real mother. Hence, the fiend king’s actions were the greatest insult to the Luo Spirit race.

Their hatred for the Black Armor Corps could not be described with words. That was why they were charging forward without any fear. They didn’t care whether or not they would be able to survive.

Qi Li continued, “The mother tree gave us one final order, to leave and not seek vengeance. She told us to patiently reproduce and wait for the day that the prophesied son would come and lead us to take our vengeance. This was the prophecy of the mother tree, so every generation has been eagerly awaiting the prophesied son. Over a hundred thousand years ago, there was a white-robed expert who gave the current great prophet a crystal bone as well as a dried-up branch of the mother tree. He said that when an expert from the Martial Heaven Continent came, we should give that crystal bone to him, for he was our prophesied son. The great prophet has already explained this secret to us, which was when we learned that big brother Long Chen was the one who could lead us to reclaim our mother tree.”

Qi Li was so emotional that she began to cry. It was as if she could already see victory before her. The grievance of countless years was finally exposed.

“Kill!”

The Luo Spirit race’s experts charged forward recklessly. Their only goal was to kill as many enemies as possible.

“You want to compete in numbers with me? What a foolish and ignorant race. I’ll show you despair.” Ye Ming sneered and suddenly made a strange hand seal.

The ground rumbled and collapsed, revealing giant roots covered in cocoons. Those cocoons were constantly being broken, unleashing powerful warriors.

Even with the earth gone, the giant tree didn’t collapse. It floated there silently. As more and more roots were exposed, more warriors of the Black Armor Corps were unleashed.

The mother tree was gigantic. It seemed as if the roots beneath the ground were just as large as the tree. It was unknown just how many enemies were hiding beneath it.

At first, the addition of the Luo Spirit race allowed Long Chen and the others to suppress the Black Armor Corps, but following Ye Ming’s actions, in just a few minutes, the Black Armor Corps began to overwhelm them.

The Luo Spirit race was slowly becoming completely outnumbered. Even the Life Spirit God was surrounded.

The experts watching had a bad feeling. In order to avoid being drawn into this terrifying battle, they chose to flee further.

From that distance, they could only see one giant tree and one smaller tree completely surrounded by a sea of black. Even the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were no longer visible.

Casualties began to appear within the Luo Spirit race. Although their arrows were able to easily pierce the armor of the Black Armor Corps, they were completely outnumbered. They were at an immense disadvantage at such close range.

“Reclaim the mother tree! Kill!”

One of the experts was cut in two, but even with his death imminent, he let out a final roar. In his final moments, he stared at the mother tree with a gentle light in his eyes.

His head was destroyed by one of the warriors of the Black Armor Corps who laughed and continued killing.

“The difference between the two sides is too great. It would be better to retreat before the encirclement is complete,” said Mo Nian as he unleashed his arrows.

The power disparity was so great that once they were completely encircled, the experts of the Martial Heaven Alliance and the Xuan Beasts would probably be wiped out to the last man.

Within the endless sea of the Black Armor Corps, there was nothing that they could do. Their spiritual yuan would eventually be exhausted, and then they would definitely die. Their only choice was to make one final attempt at breaking through.

“No, this is the final battle of our Luo Spirit race! The prophesied son will definitely lead us to victory!” shouted La Wei.

“Look carefully! Your elders are already exhausted handling the four divine generals. You say that Long Chen is your prophesied son, but Long Chen doesn’t have a way to turn the tables. Staying is just suicide!” raged Mo Nian. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Mo Nian also saw that the Life Spirit God was incapable of attacking. Its leaves were shining, most likely supporting the arrows and bows of the Luo Spirit race. Otherwise, there was no way that their arrows could pierce the Black Armor Corps’ armor so easily.

Despite that, it was useless. There were too many enemies. They were outnumbered a thousand to one.

Qi Li shook her head, firmly saying, “Exactly. We will not retreat. Our prophesied son has appeared, so we definitely can win. If we lose… then we will all die fighting in front of the mother tree. We will not live with this disgrace any longer.”

After saying that, Qi Li and La Wei flew off, charging into the middle of the battlefield.

“Long Chen, why aren’t you saying anything?!” demanded Mo Nian. Long Chen had his eyes closed.

Long Chen slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the Life God Tree as well as the prophet. He nodded his head to them.

He announced, “The Luo Spirit race’s prophet has informed me that Ye Ming is trying to control the will of the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse. Its will is connected to the souls of the Black Armor Corps. To put it frankly, the Black Armor Corps is the fiend king’s puppet. Ye Ming is trying to draw out the mother tree’s life energy to power up the fiend king, but the mother tree is protecting itself. Hence, Ye Ming will need some time to break that defense. All we need to do is stop Ye Ming from controlling the fiend king, and this Black Armor Corps will instantly die. Brothers, I’m going to make my move. Help me out. We’ll end things in one blow. The Luo Spirit race has saved us this time, and we have to repay the favor. Leave the fiend king to me.”

Long Chen summoned his divine ring and battle armor, and five stars shone in his eyes. His powerful will soared, filled with killing intent that locked onto the distant fiend king.

“Cloudpiercing Arrow!”

Mo Nian unleashed a giant arrow that pierced through the Black Armor Corps, creating a path.

“Kill!”

Long Chen charged through the path, followed by Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and the others. The Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts had formed a sharp spear charging through the battlefield.
