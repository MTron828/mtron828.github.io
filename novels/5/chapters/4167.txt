Chapter 4156: Curse of Misfortune

The elder of the Pelican race hacked up blood that was as black as ink. After that, black qi appeared on his forehead.

Filled with horror, he was no longer thinking of killing Long Chen, so he stood there motionlessly.

“What an idiot. Your Pelican race has already declined, running out of karmic luck, but you dare to attack a junior at this time? It’d be strange if the misfortune didn’t befall you.”

Suddenly, another expert of the beast race sneered, seemingly quite happy with the Pelican race’s misfortune.

“Not bad, the misfortune only fell on you alone, not your entire race. The Pelican race still hasn't reached the point of being destroyed just yet,” said someone from the other direction.

This was Long Chen’s first time seeing this so-called misfortune. It was bizarre and sudden. Long Chen didn’t know what it meant, but the black qi swirling over the elder’s forehead was no good omen. Perhaps nothing good would ever happen to him again.

Shocked and terrified, the elder could feel himself rapidly weakening, his Blood Qi congealing. The power that the Heavenly Daos had bestowed on him was being taken away.

Having been struck by the legendary curse of misfortune, his Heaven Venerate power was slipping away, meaning that all the fortune he had been bestowed by the heavens was taken away. He was now like a homeless beggar, and anyone could kill him in this state.

“What the Daos gave you doesn’t belong to you. It will stay with you if you listen, but will be taken if you don’t listen. It seems that what the Heavenly Daos gives you isn't always dependable. You should rely on yourself more!” Looking at his horrified appearance, Long Chen reflected on this.

The power of the Heavenly Daos was immense and limitless. However, far too many people were dependent on it. In fact, ninety-nine percent of cultivators who lost the support of Heavenly Dao energy were essentially crippled.

Long Chen would occasionally borrow Heavenly Dao energy, but his primary source of power always came from himself. He would only borrow Heavenly Dao energy to save a bit of his core energy.

This meant that even without the power of the Heavenly Daos, Long Chen could rely on his own power to fight. His power wouldn’t weaken, but he wouldn’t be able to maintain his peak state as long.

Previously, Long Chen had always been rejected by the Heavenly Daos and unable to use its energy. However, as he was gradually gaining the recognition of the Heavenly Daos, many of his magical arts were also starting to use Heavenly Dao energy.

But then, seeing this Heaven Venerate be cursed by the Heavenly Daos, Long Chen took it as a warning. The important thing was to be strong himself. He couldn’t rely too much on the Heavenly Daos.

“Hahaha, now it’s interesting. So the curse is real!” Guo Ran laughed. Now what would they fear?

“Pelican race? More like trash-can race! People aren’t even allowed to fly over your heads? Why not just say that no one else can live under the same heavens as you?” If Guo Ran didn’t use this chance to throw stones while they were down, he wouldn’t be called Guo Ran.

In this place, hundreds of thousands of experts from the Pelican race had gathered. The reason they dared to be so arrogant was because Long Chen and the others were from the human race and had no Heaven Venerates guarding them.

As a result, this elder attacked, drawing the ire of the Heavenly Daos, which caused him to be cursed by the misfortune of the heavens. Now, all his people were dumbfounded.

Legend had it that this curse would rarely appear before the Sage King Convention started. Even if it did, the probability was so low that only a few Heaven Venerates who fought would be cursed.

However, the Pelican race’s innate Heaven Venerate was just that unlucky. As soon as he attacked, he was sensed by the Heavenly Daos. He had no room to argue.

“Oh old fellow, I challenge you to a duel! Do you dare to accept?” Guo Ran pointed at the elder and shouted grandly.

That elder quivered with rage. Guo Ran had the weakest aura in the Dragonblood Legion. It was so bad to the extent that perhaps in the entire Sage King Convention, it was difficult to find someone weaker than him. Just breathing on him could cause him to collapse.

However, with this curse on, the elder didn’t even dare to move. If he were to kill Long Chen and the others, he would also die. He wasn’t foolish to that extent.

“What, you don’t dare?” Guo Ran continued, “How about I bind one arm and one foot? Will you fight then?”

At this moment, a cracking sound came from the elder’s mouth, and blood dripped out of it. He then opened his mouth and spat out a bunch of shattered fragments of his own teeth. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The shattered teeth had cut his mouth. Seeing this, the elder was terrified. This was absolutely bizarre. He was a Heaven Venerate, but it was like all his power had vanished.

This scene caused Long Chen and the others to jump. This Heavenly Dao curse was truly bizarre; there was no way to defend against it.

The people’s expressions also changed. Quite a few others present were originally laughing at their misfortune, but now they couldn’t laugh anymore.

Although cultivators respected the Heavenly Daos, once they grew strong enough, they always felt like they were omnipotent. But once this curse descended, it showed that even innate Heaven Venerates could be considered ants in front of the Heavenly Daos. As a result, the onlookers were shocked and felt immense reverence for the Heavenly Daos.

Guo Ran had been planning on continuing to mock the Pelican race, but this scene made him a bit afraid. This thing was too frightening. After all, the power of the unknown was the most fearsome.

Suddenly, more blood sprayed out of the elder’s mouth, and his aura grew chaotic. Terror filled his eyes. It was as if he was seeing something horrifying.

He suddenly reached toward his own throat, clawing at it as if a pair of invisible hands were strangling him.

“Patriarch!” The Pelican race’s experts cried out in shock. Some disciples tried to help him, but they were stopped by their elders.

In the distance, a Heaven Venerate from another race shouted, “Your patriarch is bound by misfortune. Anyone who touches him will also be affected. If he can endure, he’ll endure. If he can’t, no one can save him. Don’t try to fight the Heavenly Daos.”

That Heaven Venerate kindly warned them. Most likely, his relationship with the Pelican race wasn’t bad, so he didn’t want the Pelican race’s disciples to die for nothing.

In truth, the descent of this misfortune was an embodiment of the laws of the Sage King Convention. Every time the Sage King Convention occurred, some unlucky fellows would be caught by the Heavenly Daos. After seeing these examples, the others would respect the Heavenly Daos and the laws of this place.

“Patriarch, you must endure!” The Pelican race’s disciples nervously cried out.

Suddenly, a pair of wings appeared on the patriarch’s back, causing space to shudder. He then vanished and reappeared in front of Long Chen.

“Damn human race, even if I have to die, I’ll drag you to hell with me!”

The patriarch seemed to have gone insane. His wings spread, covering the sky and enveloping Long Chen and the others.
