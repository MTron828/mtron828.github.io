Chapter 3093 An Assassin’s Weakness

“This is…”

Everyone was stunned. How did the martial stage become like this? This gloomy forest gave people a frightening chill.

“Blasphemer of the Killing God, you will pay the price for your foolishness. Await death within endless terror.” The assassin’s sinister voice rang throughout the jungle.

Long Chen punched a large tree beside him. It then fell and smashed apart some of the surrounding trees.

“It’s actually not an illusion!”

Luo Bing and the others were surprised. They had originally thought that this was an illusion. Even then, an illusion on such a large scale was shocking enough. But this was actually real.

“Interesting. So you have both earth and wood elements. But so what? Without a diaper, you can’t cover your face,” said Long Chen.

“Fool, this jungle is the manifestation of a priceless treasure. It is both illusory and real. No one can escape from this place. Have you not noticed that the trees you knocked down have recovered?” sneered the Bloodkill expert.

Everyone was shocked and hastily checked. Just as he said, the trees that had been knocked down had returned to their previous appearance.

“An insignificant trick. If I destroyed this jungle, I’d feel like I was bullying you. Boss San likes to beat experts who think themselves powerful. Right now, you’re scurrying in the dark like a rat while you wait to assassinate your target. Well, fine. Today, I’ll expose your Bloodkill Hall’s so-called assassination arts and show everyone that they’re not worth shit.”

Anyone else would feel a profound feeling of fear when tossed into this gloomy jungle. But Long Chen indifferently said, “The Bloodkill Hall’s assassins don’t really have much ability. They rely on sinister tricks and mental warfare. They often show off something flashy to scare people before they launch the real killing blow while their opponent’s mind is in terror…”

Luo Bing and the others suddenly realized that Long Chen was giving them a lesson on how to counter an assassin. But even if they knew what to do, it wasn’t so easy to do it in practice.

If an ordinary person was tossed into a deep pool and saw only darkness, how could they not be afraid? Most importantly, there was even a hungry crocodile within this lake, and it was hidden. It could see you, but you couldn’t see it. How could you not be nervous?

Just as Long Chen was speaking, a dagger rushed toward Long Chen’s face. But without even looking at it, Long Chen swung his hand behind him.

As a result, the Bloodkill expert had just appeared behind him when he was struck by Long Chen’s palm.

Again, he was sent flying, breaking quite a few trees on his way before smashing into a boulder and coughing up a mouthful of blood. He then slowly slid down the boulder, leaving a long line of blood.

“This is…”

Everyone was shocked. Long Chen had sent the Bloodkill expert flying. It was as if he was a prophet. Only after sending the assassin flying did he casually dodge the dagger flying toward him from the front.

That dagger was nothing more than bait to draw his attention. The real attack came from behind.

However, in this tense situation, anyone would instantly react to that dagger flying toward them. That was instinct. But if he had focused on blocking the dagger, he would have been killed by the assassin from behind.

At this moment, the Bloodkill expert slammed his palm against the ground. His body bounced off, vanishing within the jungle. He once more hid himself.

Suddenly, a dozen arrows shot out of the forest at Long Chen. They came from completely different angles, as if a dozen people were shooting.

The heads of these arrows were pitch black, and there was a vague blue light as well. That was the result of the arrows being corroded by the poison. Anyone struck would lose at least half their life.

However, Long Chen only sneered and turned his body. Those arrows then passed right by him. After that, he directly swung his hand.

BOOM!

Ripples appeared in the air, and a figure showed up within those ripples. The Bloodkill expert let out a painful grunt as he was sent flying again.

This time, he was sent flying before he could even make a move against Long Chen.

“He was found again. How is Long Chen doing this?” asked Luo Ning. They were unable to even spot that assassin’s shadow, but Long Chen seemed to see through him.

The assassin coughed up blood, feeling shocked. He also didn’t know how Long Chen had found his location twice.

Long Chen shook the blood off of his hand and indifferently said, “Are you curious? You assassins always use the simplest methods, using the smallest price to kill your targets. In other words, you don’t dare to unleash your full power because then you can’t keep yourself concealed in the void. Since you don’t dare to use your full power, there are only a few spots you can aim for that will be fatal. To put it frankly, as long as you ignore everything in front of you and focus on your vitals, then even if you aren’t a sword cultivator, your sense of danger should be able to find them. Furthermore, assassins always like to come from angles that you don’t expect. But any move has its own weakness. Although attacks that come from behind are difficult to block, if you focus on the most common weak points of a person’s body, it will be like you have a pair of eyes watching those spots, and you will be able to clearly sense an assassin approaching…”

“Bullshit!” The Bloodkill expert was enraged. As he vanished once more, Long Chen sneered and suddenly retreated to the left. He then swung his hand again.

Pow!

The assassin was slapped out of space yet again. Luo Bing and the others cried out in shock. This assassin had just been in the midst of hiding in one of Long Chen’s dead angles.

Pow!

Now, he had just vanished when Long Chen slapped him out of space again. Long Chen was so accurate that it was unbelievable.

Pow!

Pow!

Pow!

“...”

That assassin was repeatedly slapped out of space, unable to conceal himself. Now, Luo Bing and the others understood that Long Chen was doing this as a demonstration for them. He actually had a one hundred perfect accuracy at finding this assassin. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Heavenly Desolation Slaughter!”

After receiving so many slaps, the Bloodkill expert went crazy. He howled and divine light exploded out of his body. Rather than an assassination art, he directly charged at Long Chen as a streak of light. The divine light was most intense at the tip of his dagger. Without any flashiness, he shot at Long Chen, all his power concentrated on one attack.
