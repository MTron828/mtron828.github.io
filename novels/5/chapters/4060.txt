Chapter 4049 Peerless Grade Golden Pill

“Long Chen, are you alright?” asked Jiang Huixin to resolve the awkward atmosphere.

“It seems that he is fine.”

Before Long Chen replied, Yu Xiaoyun was already answering for him. Of course, Long Chen had to be alright, or how else could he hug his beloved daughter?

Hearing this statement, Yu Qingxuan reddened and Jiang Huixin glared at her husband. This fellow had promised her to talk nicely this time. How could he suddenly go back on his word?

“Long Chen, theoretically, since you just woke up, you still need to rest. But there is no time to rest anymore,” said Jiang Huixin.

Long Chen nodded. “I understand. But my head still hurts, so let me just rest a bit and I’ll go.” Although Long Chen hadn’t heard Ye Wusheng’s final remarks, he knew that using the bronze cauldron would cause trouble.

Even if only the Vermilion Bird Empire’s people saw it, so what? With experts in the empire numbering in the trillions, who could guarantee that there were no traitors among them?

Thus, even if the Vermilion Bird Empire were to enter an information lockdown, it wouldn’t be long before the news spread.

Given the tremendous disturbance this time, Long Chen knew that the experts in this region would undoubtedly make inquiries. The shattered void in the sky served as a clear indicator of something major happening, so Long Chen realized that he couldn't stay in this place for long.

Upon awakening, he promptly directed his attention toward recovering. He then felt gratified to find that his physical body was completely fine, instilling him with confidence that he wouldn't fear facing an Earth Venerate if the need arose.

However, his soul felt somewhat hollow, and his head throbbed as if it were about to split open. The pain in his left eye was especially excruciating, and even with the eyepatch gifted by Bai Xiaole's mother, it felt as though sharp needles were relentlessly piercing into his eye. This pain felt like it was swelling, pulsing, and pulling at his soul.

Seeing Long Chen like this, Yu Qingxuan felt heartache for him. Long Chen was a man who never cried out in pain. So, for him to say that it was painful, it was definitely beyond imagination.

Long Chen had acted fine upon waking up for her, but now the truth was revealed, so Yu Qingxuan hastily took out a medicinal pill. When Long Chen saw the pill, he was startled.

“A peerless grade golden pill?”

This pill had golden marks flickering on top of it, moving across the surface. Also, the powerful medicinal energy was perfectly sealed within the pill, with not even a trace leaking.

In the immortal world, medicinal pills had three classifications: spirit pills, treasure pills, and golden pills. Every one of them could be graded as low grade, middle grade, high grade, top grade, and peerless grade.

Golden pills were the highest tier of pills that Long Chen had come into contact with. Furthermore, he could only refine one or two within a hundred refinements.

As for a peerless grade pill, that was something that Long Chen had never managed to refine, whether it was a spirit, treasure, or golden pill.

This so-called peerless grade meant that there could only be one within heaven and earth. There could not be two identical peerless grade pills.

Normally, if one peerless grade pill appeared, a second could not appear, unless the first one was consumed and vanished from this world.

However, there was a more domineering method. If there was already a consummate grade pill in the world, someone who refined the same pill at the peerless grade would have to endure the baptism of heavenly tribulation to obtain the recognition of the Heavenly Daos.

Once the second pill received this recognition, then the first peerless grade pills would wither away and vanish from this world. In the end, only one peerless grade pill of this type could exist.

Thus, refining a peerless grade pill was normally considered a great honor for an alchemist. Yu Qingxuan, through sheer luck, had managed to refine a peerless grade pill, which sent waves through the entire alchemy world. It marked the first occurrence in many tens of thousands of years where a peerless grade pill was successfully refined.

“This is a Soul Nourishing Spirit Calming Pill, and it just so happens that it can help with your injuries. You baddie, why didn’t you say anything sooner?” rebuked Yu Qingxuan.

Long Chen had acted like he was fine when he first woke up. If he hadn’t been pretending, she would have taken it out sooner.

Upon looking at her reproachful gaze, Long Chen’s heart warmed. Thus, he didn’t argue and just tossed the pill into his mouth.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The pill instantly melted, and a miraculous halo of light appeared above Long Chen’s head.

When that happened, the spiritual qi of heaven and earth was instantly sucked into it and poured into Long Chen’s body.

“A peerless grade golden pill can use heaven and earth as the medicine. The legends really are true,” praised Long Chen.

The effect of a peerless grade golden pill was not limited to just a medicinal pill. Its medicinal energy could draw out the essence of heaven and earth to work with the medicinal pill’s energy, unleashing a medicinal effect that surpassed people’s imagination.

Long Chen’s injuries were severe this time, and the damage to his soul and eye was the most difficult to heal. Even with the primal chaos space’s energy, he could only slowly heal them.

But after consuming Yu Qingxuan's peerless grade golden pill, Long Chen felt immediate relief as his burning eye was refreshed, and the excruciating pain subsided. The splitting headache that had been plaguing him vanished almost instantly, leaving him feeling revitalized and full of energy.

He then tore off his eyepatch and opened his left eye, causing Yu Xiaoyun and the others’ expressions to change. The hell flower in his left eye had yet to fully vanish. Upon seeing the hell flower in his eyes, their souls quivered.

“Still no good. My eye still hurts a bit, and I can’t keep it open. But don’t worry, I estimate that it will only take three to five days for it to heal.” Long Chen felt very uncomfortable when he opened his left eye. It even teared up, so he put the eyepatch back on.

The peerless grade golden pill had instantly healed the wound to his soul, but its effect was limited against the Purgatory Eyes. After all, even the power of heaven and earth was not omnipotent.

Afraid that Yu Qingxuan would be disappointed, Long Chen hastily smiled and said, “A peerless grade golden pill really is amazing. Without it, my recovery would have taken at least half a year, but now I feel revitalized in no time. Qingxuan, you’re amazing.”

Yu Qingxuan was truly a bit disappointed. She had thought that this peerless grade golden pill would instantly heal Long Chen, but his praise did make her smile slightly.

Jiang Huixin watched them with a smile. She then looked back at the gloomy Yu Xiaoyun and couldn’t help sighing. Compared to Long Chen, Yu Xiaoyun didn’t know how to make others happy.

The feast was already prepared, and as Long Chen and the others walked into the venue, they were greeted with the utmost respect as everyone stood in reverence.

Thinking back, when Long Chen had first come to the Vermilion Bird Empire to propose to Yu Qingxuan, he had stirred anger among countless experts. Many saw him as a toad lusting after swan meat, an unworthy match for her.

However, after the last battle, Long Chen’s bravery and fearlessness had fully won them over. He was a true hero, and when they looked at him now, their eyes were full of reverence and gratitude.

At the main table, there were five people: Yu Xiaoyun, Jiang Huixin, Xu Lanxin, Long Chen, and Yu Qingxuan. Everyone knew that this feast was more like a family gathering, as there was a bit less dignity to it and a bit more warmth.

Guo Ran and the others were placed around the main table. This time, Long Chen wasn’t stingy. He took out the blood fire sorghum wine that he had kept hidden all this time.

When the blood fire sorghum wine appeared, Yu Xiaoyun’s gaze instantly locked onto it.
