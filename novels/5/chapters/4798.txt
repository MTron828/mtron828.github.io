Chapter 4787 Heaven Saint Descends

The gate quivered as a figure squeezed out of it. However, it seemed as though some kind of power was restricting him, so the world was shaking as he tried to force his way through.

Even though he was unable to fully pass through, a terrifying pressure now filled the world, causing even Earth Saints to turn pale.

“He’s enraged! He’s enduring the backlash of the Heavenly Daos to kill Long Chen!”

A Heaven Saint could be considered an almighty existence in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. However, due to their immense power, they could hardly pass through such weak passageways.

In truth, Long Chen had been correct when he said that the spatial gate was only there to scare people. Although it did connect to the Celestial race’s headquarters, this passageway was not that strong. Let alone a Heaven Saint, even an Earth Saint was unable to pass through it.

Back then, Yue Wuxu had only been bragging, as he refused to believe that the Long clan would become mortal enemies with the Celestial race for a single disciple. For him, that didn’t make any sense. Hence, his spatial gate was only there to instigate others to attack, making them unafraid of the Long clan.

For a Heaven Saint to go through this gate was like trying to squeeze an elephant through a mouse hole. While the power of a Heaven Saint was immense, the restrictions of the Heavenly Daos were also stronger on them. Otherwise, it would be catastrophic if a Heaven Saint were to run rampant.

A Mortal Saint could pass through this channel fairly easily. However, when a Heaven Saint tried to barge their way through, they were completely destroying it in the process—a futile struggle against the laws of heaven and earth.

No matter how strong a Heaven Saint was, they were not stronger than the heavens. For this Heaven Saint to act like this, he definitely had to bear some karma, perhaps even injured by the backlash of the Heavenly Daos.

Despite the risks, he continued to barge his way through. The gate was twisting violently, revealing countless spatial cracks spreading out of it.

Long Chen simply stood in front of the gate, with Evilmoon resting on his shoulder and his cloak swaying in the breeze. He patiently waited for the Heaven Saint to descend.

“Heaven Overseer, what do we do? They’ve even summoned a Heaven Saint!” exclaimed one of the Long clan’s experts. They were all anxious.

After all, their Heaven Overseer was just a half-step Heaven Saint. Originally, this group had thought that having the Heaven Overseer personally welcome Long Chen would elevate his status too much. However, as things progressed, everything went out of control. If a Heaven Saint were to descend, then not even the Heaven Overseer could save him. Moreover, it was too late to request reinforcements from the Long clan.

At this moment, the gate finally reached its limit and exploded, and within countless flying fragments of spacetime, a gray-robed elder emerged.

The elder had a white beard and white hair, his face twisting with fury. Without uttering a word, he unleashed a devastating palm strike aimed directly at Long Chen.

This single palm possessed enough power to slaughter a hundred Earth Saints, let alone a single Divine Venerate disciple.

However, Long Chen remained motionless, not moving in the slightest. Meanwhile, the Dragonblood warriors braced themselves as they recognized the strength of a Heaven Saint—an existence that none of them could fight. Even Bai Zhantang’s expression was filled with concern as he scanned the surroundings for any sign of reinforcements, only to find none.

Just as that palm was about to land, a figure appeared behind Long Chen. At the same time, the Long clan’s experts in the distance cried out in shock.

“Heavenly Sage!”

This person was Long Chen’s father, the Heavenly Desolation Long clan’s fourth Heavenly Sage, Long Zhantian.

“If you dare to harm a single hair on my son’s head, I, Long Zhantian, will annihilate your entire race.”

At this moment, Long Zhantian no longer appeared weak and repressed. With a set of snakeskin armor and a blood-colored broadsword strapped on his back, he stood tall like a javelin, divine light flickering in his eyes.

Even though none of his aura was leaking, Long Zhantian still exuded such a majestic presence. When he appeared, seven-colored divine light lit up the sky, and the ten thousand Daos seemed to bow in deference to his presence.

However, despite the grandeur of his arrival, neither he nor Long Chen showed any intention of taking action.

BOOM!

The hand suddenly exploded less than a few hundred meters from Long Chen. That Heaven Saint had pulled back his attack at the final moment.

“Tch, gutless coward. I really look down on you,” Long Chen sneered. He put away Evilmoon and slowly turned back. Seeing his father’s smile, Long Chen felt a burst of emotion. Ignoring everything else, Long Chen prepared to kowtow.

Long Zhantian grabbed Long Chen’s shoulders, stopping him. “Is there a need for such a thing between father and son? Let me see your face for a bit... Hmm, not bad, you’ve matured a great deal. The confusion in your heart has also vanished. Hehe, as expected of my son. I’m proud of you.”

Long Zhantian seemed to be able to see through Long Chen, his pride written all over his face.

Long Chen couldn’t help but smile. He replied, “That’s because I sensed you nearby, so I dared to be reckless. If you weren’t, I’d have probably run off long ago.”

“That’s also amazing, you know? I used seven secret arts to seal my bloodline power, but you still sensed it,” praised Long Zhantian.

“Dad...” Long Chen’s eyes suddenly reddened. “I missed you.”

“Are you two done?!”

Just then, the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint roared furiously, “Long Zhantian, you are nothing more than a clone at this time! Do you think you can stop me? What gives you the guts?!”

“Clone?”

Even Long Chen was startled. Upon closer inspection, he realized that the figure in front of him really was just a clone.

Long Chen was about to take out Evilmoon again when Long Zhantian patted his shoulders and said, “You’ve done enough today. Leave the rest to me!”

Long Zhantian stood in front of Long Chen, eyeing the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint indifferently.

“You want to know what gives me the guts? Here.”

Long Zhantian tossed out a certain object that made countless people gasp in shock.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
