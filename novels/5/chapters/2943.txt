Chapter 2932 Luo Qingyang

Long Chen was startled. They had to beat their way in and then beat their way out? Was the inner academy’s welcoming ceremony really so special?

Seeing his unfriendly expression, Luo Bing hastily grabbed him and whispered, “They’re not here to fight. They came to give us their card.”

As expected, someone immediately rushed over to Long Chen and courteously said, “Junior brother, welcome to the inner academy. First, let me congratulate all of you on becoming elite inner academy disciples. I know you’re all busy, so I’ll keep it short. The Wind Tiger Gate is a very powerful force in the inner academy. Although we only formed half a year ago, our gate master’s ranking has been steadily climbing. He is also a magnanimous and generous person whose family is extremely powerful. He has always had plenty of resources available…”

After that person’s long speech, Long Chen understood that it was recruitment.

“Junior brother, come to our Clear Wind Valley. Our valley master is a beautiful woman. With your talent and aptitude, I’m honestly telling you that you have a high chance of obtaining a beauty.”

“Long Chen, our Heavenly Dragon Gate shares the Long character with you! If you don’t join us, aren’t you letting down our fated connection?”

These people had all come to recruit them, not just Long Chen. Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, and the others were also surrounded.

“Sorry, but we’re from the Luo family. We won’t join other guilds,” said Luo Bing. As soon as she said this, those people gave up on them and focused on the Unfettered Alliance.

“There’s no need to answer immediately. You can compare and look around. Let me just leave you with our card. There’s an introduction there. You can consider it later.” Someone confidently, directly gave Long Chen a refined card with no other greeting or speech.

Long Chen received it and looked. There was a summary of this guild’s history and accomplishments, what kind of benefits and treatment he would be given if he joined, as well as plans for the future.

Long Chen clearly understood that the competition in the inner academy was far more intense than in the outer academy. People were already starting to fight over potential recruits.

Hundreds of people had come, and each of these people represented a guild. Long Chen was surprised by that. Did the inner academy really have so many guilds?

After that, Long Chen received all their cards, but he didn’t have time to read them all right now.

“Brother San, are you planning on starting your own guild in the inner academy?” asked Mu Qingyun.

Long Chen shook his head. “I’m not interested in that. If it weren’t for Chu Kuang, I wouldn’t have even bothered participating in the divine competition. Even if I didn’t join the competition, I could have entered the inner academy through the Pill Institute. Moreover, I have many things to do in the inner academy, and I don’t have time for such trivial matters.”

Upon entering the inner academy, it was possible to obtain many, many resources. Hence, Long Chen wanted to spend his time raising his power, not this childish nonsense.

Mu Qingyun felt a bit disappointed. Although she had expected this, she couldn’t help feeling this way. If Long Chen wanted to create his own guild, they would all immediately join. But by saying this, Long Chen was saying he had no interest in the competition between guilds.

Mu Qingyun wanted to keep the Unfettered Alliance, but just by herself, she felt like she wouldn’t be able to last amongst these geniuses in the inner academy. However, she was also unwilling to just let the Unfettered Alliance go like this.

Long Chen looked at her and smiled. “Every person has their own mission, their own burden. Your burden can be lifted by others for you for a while, but not forever. If you are unwilling to let go of this burden, then work hard to lift it. No matter what the result is, at least if you try, you won’t have regrets. As long as you face it with all you have, who cares whether it turns out good or bad?”

“Brother San, I understand.” Mu Qingyun smiled. That was true. Before she had met Long Chen, hadn’t the Unfettered Alliance been fine? How could cultivation be dependent on someone other than yourself?

Long Chen didn’t wish to interfere in their cultivation path. He felt like he was just a passing guest in other people’s lives. He could help now, but that wasn’t necessarily good for their future. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Furthermore, Long Chen truly detested this kind of senseless fighting. His time was far too precious for such a thing. How did he have time to waste on such things?

Just at this moment, a group of inner academy disciples in white robes walked in. The Luo character was written clearly on their chest in golden thread.

“The Luo Alliance’s people have come…” whispered one of the guild ambassadors.

This time, there were over ten of them, and they were only in the Divine Flame realm. Despite that, just in terms of aura, they were not inferior to those Four Peak guards. These were clearly real experts.

Their leader was a tall, handsome man. Every single one of his movements contained the bearing of an expert.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qingyang, we finally meet,” said Luo Bing hastily.

This person was the Luo family’s heavenly genius, the leader of the Luo family’s force in the inner academy, Luo Qingyang. According to seniority, she should call him big brother. However, in the Luo family, as a child, she had been under the same master as Luo Qingyang, so she was used to calling him senior apprentice-brother.

“I’ve heard what happened. You entered this time completely due to luck,” said Luo Qingyang.

“Precisely. If that Gu Fei wasn’t conned by Chu Kuang, our chances of winning would be low,” said Luo Ning fearfully.

Gu Fei truly had been powerful. However, Luo Bing and Luo Ning didn’t actually fear him. It was more so that he had multiple other experts like Yuan Xinghui who had concealed their power as well.

Even if the two of them would be able to eke out a draw in a fight, the rest of their members would be slowly defeated. Then with just the two of them remaining, the chances of them winning would be low.

Thus, Luo Qingyang was correct in saying that they had managed to enter the inner academy through luck.

“Long Chen, let me introduce you. This is senior apprentice-brother Luo Qingyang, one of the Luo family’s geniuses, and the head of the Luo Alliance. In the future, we can all get along,” said Luo Bing, pulling Long Chen away from the others who were stuffing cards into his hand.

Only then did he notice Luo Qingyang and the others. However, when he saw Luo Qingyang’s expression, he was startled. And seeing Luo Bing pulling his sleeve, he instantly understood.

He smiled and cupped his fists, escaping her hold. “This junior is Long Chen. Nice to meet you.”

Luo Qingyang’s expression became a bit unnatural, but he squeezed out a slight smile and also cupped his fists. “Nice to meet you.”

Luo Bing was surprised. Originally, she had thought that Luo Qingyang would enthusiastically recruit Long Chen. After all, he had helped them out immensely. An existence with limitless potential like him was a great asset to the Luo Alliance, but Luo Qingyang seemingly had no intention of recruiting him.

Luo Ning then looked from Luo Qingyang to Long Chen. A faint smile appeared on her face, but she didn’t say anything. At this moment, the atmosphere grew a bit awkward.

“Well, the check-in is done. We still have some things to do, so we won’t disturb you any longer.” Long Chen then started walking away with the Unfettered Alliance.

Luo Bing stared helplessly. She had been excited to introduce the two of them, but things had turned out this way.

However, just as Long Chen was walking to the door, another group of people appeared. As for these people, their chests had a large Chu character emblazoned on them. Seeing them, the Luo family’s people instantly clenched their fists.
