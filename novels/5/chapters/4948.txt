Chapter 4937: Target - Heavenly Desolation

Long Chen and the others were transported to a wilderness, and Mo Nian immediately told Long Chen the general direction. Using the violet crystal heavenly eye, Long Chen quickly looked toward Devil Fall City.

Due to the difference in time, Long Chen didn’t get to see the elder from the Flame Divine Hall detonate the altar. He also missed the chance to witness all the experts be blasted to death.

However, through the crystal eye, he could see the devastation to the city and the wounds inflicted on the elder. Since the experts following the elder were gone, they were likely killed by the explosion.

When Mo Nian saw this, he cheered in excitement. He had been quite confident in his trap's success, but the joy of seeing it trigger successfully was simply delightful.

Later on, they saw the expert from the Chess Sect appear. While they couldn’t hear their conversation, they could read their lips to get a general understanding of what they were saying.

For some reason, when Long Chen saw the fragment of Sovereign jade, Long Chen felt a swell of bitter emotions, as if that jade carried countless memories. However, that feeling quickly passed.

Once the two of them left, Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a look, both wearing sinister smiles. Race Leader Yu Luo suddenly felt a chill upon seeing those smiles; they were rather frightening.

“Half a year? We don’t have that much time. I’m still at the fifth Heavenstage, and you’re only at the third. Will you be alright?” asked Mo Nian.

During this time, Long Chen had not really increased his cultivation base. He had remained at the third Heavenstage because the Earth Cauldron prevented him from consuming more pills, though it hadn’t explained why.

“I’ll be fine. After all, I can use medicinal pills to increase my realm. But what about you?” asked Long Chen.

“I visited several good fengshui lands during this period, which then stalled my cultivation. I was also in no rush to increase my realm since I didn’t encounter any real opponents. But now I’m regretting it. Every Heavenstage would have mattered against the vice hall master. If I had been in the ninth Heavenstage, I wouldn’t have even needed you. I’d have crushed him on my own, and then Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu…” Mo Nian sighed angrily.

What Mo Nian wanted to say was that if he had been at the ninth Heavenstage, he could have faced the vice hall master alone, potentially giving Long Chen a chance to save the two sisters. Unfortunately, the world was not kind to “what ifs.”

Although treasures were important, power was even more so. Without power, even the most outstanding treasures were useless. That Emperor arrow was the perfect example. Despite the immense power contained within it, Mo Nian couldn’t unleash its full potential.

“I will learn some archery arts from Race Leader Yu Luo, and then I’ll go into seclusion to raise my cultivation base. I’ll aim to reach the great circle of the Divine Venerate realm in time for the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain,” said Mo Nian. “I’ll slaughter them. What about you?”

“I…”

Long Chen was about to say that he was going to return to the High Firmament Academy. After all, the academy had just found a foothold, and he was a bit worried about them.

“You need to take a trip to the Heavenly Desolation,” interrupted the Earth Cauldron suddenly.

“To see the Long clan?” asked Long Chen, surprised.

“The Heavenly Desolation Long clan has something you need.”

Since the Earth Cauldron said this, Long Chen simply told Mo Nian that he would be taking a trip to the Heavenly Desolation Long clan.

“The Heavenly Desolation Long clan? Your family?” Mo Nian was baffled.

“I suppose they can be considered so. My father has gone there, so I’m going to take a look as well. I really want to know what makes him so reluctant to leave,” replied Long Chen.

“They do have a terrifying foundation, but they also care nothing about familial ties. With your character, if you go… I don’t think that anything good will come of it,” remarked Mo Nian.

“I’m not planning on getting anything good out of it. I just don’t understand why my father chose to return to the Long clan. He didn’t tell me, so I suppose I’ll have to find the answers myself.”

“Alright. Don’t forget to cultivate though! If you miss the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain, I’m going to be the only one in the limelight! Hahahaha!” laughed Mo Nian.

“Don’t worry, I won’t slack off. We’ll properly settle our debts with the Brahma Pill Valley there,” declared Long Chen with a smile.

“Alright then.”

Long Chen and Mo Nian patted each other’s shoulders. After bidding Yu Luo farewell, he directly rushed over. However, after flying for a few hours, he gradually slowed down.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At this moment, his power had recovered to about thirty percent. It wasn’t a good thing to be speeding along at full speed for an extended period, so he found a place to recover first. He also had some questions for the Earth Cauldron.

“Senior, just what is in the Long clan?” asked Long Chen.

“The Heavenly Desolation is located on the western shore of the devil sea. Where the continent and the devil sea clash, the collision of devil qi and immortal qi produces some particular plants. Amongst there are several ingredients for the Nirvanic Charge Pill. If you’re lucky, you will be able to find all the ingredients that you need there,” answered the Earth Cauldron.

“Really?”

Thinking of gathering all the Nirvanic Charge Pill’s ingredients, Long Chen instantly jumped up in excitement.

He had been stuck at the seventh star for too long, so he urgently wished to condense the eighth star. Based on his experience, the Eight Star Battle Armor would be over a hundred times stronger than the Seven Star Battle Armor. If he could summon the Eight Star Battle Armor, he’d be able to slap an existence like the vice hall master to death.

“You should be able to gather most of them. Even if you don’t get them all, you should only be missing a few by the end. That’s why you must go there. As for the Long clan’s territory… Well, it will depend on your mood,” said the Earth Cauldron.

It knew that Long Chen detested the Long clan, or perhaps it should be said that he felt a natural repulsion for those arrogant families who thought that everyone else was beneath them. Long Chen despised them for being willing to sacrifice bloodline ties just for profit, for raising so-called heavenly geniuses like raising poison bugs. He hated their insufferably arrogant faces.

Hearing that he could choose not to go to the Long clan, Long Chen was delighted and instantly became much more relaxed. He then called out Huo Linger to protect him while he recovered. Three days later, he had regained seventy to eighty percent of his strength. It went without saying that his wounds this time were severe.

The damage caused by heaven vein dragon qi was immense, like poison invading his bones, hard to extract. Long Chen estimated that it would take at least ten days for him to recover fully.

With seventy to eighty percent of his strength regained, Long Chen felt confident in being able to keep himself safe. Refreshed and determined, he embarked on his next journey, heading toward the Heavenly Desolation.
