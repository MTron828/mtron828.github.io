Chapter 4250 Using Lives to Make Up for the Pillars

“Doesn’t this mean that Long Chen and Mo Nian were right?”

“Is this to say that Long Chen and Mo Nian were the ones trying to stop this and save everyone? But are they really that kindhearted?”

“Xu Xin-er is retaliating against Lian Wuying and the others for just watching as Xu Yifeng died. She seems more believable.”

Countless experts began to discuss this amongst themselves. The human race in particular was in an uproar.

Previously, the schemers had encouraged the human race’s experts to attack Long Chen and the others. As the human race’s experts had been the closest, they had taken the most hideous losses. Furthermore, they were then caught in the middle when the other races’ experts arrived, and those experts also killed them indiscriminately.

Now, from hundreds of millions of experts, they were reduced to a few hundred thousand. Those people were dumbfounded, their shock quickly transforming into fury.

“You fucking bastards, who was the one shouting just now?! I’ll kill you!”

These people didn’t blame themselves for being brainless, but they blamed those people who had been encouraging them. But in this chaotic battlefield, how could they know who was shouting?

“Everyone, don’t believe her! She’s on Long Chen’s side! She’s trying to help him out of his predicament!”

However, as soon as this person shouted, he sensed something off as countless scornful gazes turned his way. How could he possibly shout something so brainless?

Long Chen and Xu Xin-er were on the same side? So he killed Xu Yifeng? Did this idiot not see Xu Xin-er about to throw her life against Long Chen? That was the only reason why she had told everyone this. She didn’t want her enemies to get the upper hand.

Lian Wuying, Ye Wuchen, the Ghost Dao lifeform, and others had gloomy expressions, looking as if they wanted to tear Xu Xin-er apart. However, those three terrifying monsters around Xu Xin-er stopped them. Unless they all went together, those three monsters might have the ability to kill them if they made any rash moves.

Moreover, although they hated Xu Xin-er, they were also peak experts with their own pride. They had never lowered themselves to working together with their peers.

“If you don’t want others to get the upper hand, why not break the ceremony? Then no one will get a share of karmic luck. Wouldn’t that be better?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“Hahahaha!”

Xu Xin-er laughed. “Long Chen, do you take me for a fool? Do you want to use me? You idiot, did you think destroying three light pillars would stop the ceremony?! Once the ceremony starts, it cannot be stopped! Even if you break all the light pillars, it’s useless. Blood soul energy is enough to activate the ceremony. Have you not noticed that the broken light pillars have reappeared?”

Long Chen was startled. Looking in the direction of the broken light pillars, he was shocked to see that they really had reappeared.

However, those light pillars were different from before. They were very dim and had a faint layer of blood light on top of them. Without looking closely, it wouldn’t have been noticeable.

“If the light pillars aren’t enough, that can be made up for with people’s lives. As long as enough people are killed, even if you destroy all the light pillars, the sacrificial ceremony will still go through. Of course, breaking three of the pillars means that more lives have to be sacrificed. If you were to break them all, ninety-nine percent of the people here would need to lose their lives. This is a death trap with no way out. Until the karmic luck bead explodes, the martial stage’s barrier will not disappear, and everyone will be trapped here until they die. All your struggling is useless. If you hadn’t destroyed those three light pillars, the karmic luck bead might have already activated,” said Xu Xin-er coldly.

Long Chen’s heart shook. His soulsearch hadn't provided him with this information, so it seemed that Xu Xin-er knew more than her brother. Long Chen didn’t know if that was because Xu Yifeng hadn’t bothered memorizing this information or if the family head simply pampered Xu Xin-er, resulting in him giving her access to exclusive knowledge.

“Long Chen, this woman might be telling the truth,” transmitted Mo Nian. His battle with Yan Wuji had reached a stalemate.

Mo Nian was dispirited. He had been keeping an eye on the entire martial stage all this time, but it seemed that just as Xu Xin-er said, there was no way out.

The atmosphere inside of the martial stage was tense now, but the people outside were even more shocked, eyeing each other warily. They finally understood that this martial stage was only a sacrificial ceremony.

Everyone inside was treated as a sacrificial lamb. The current Sage King Convention was a trap, an absolutely enormous trap.

However, they were powerless to do anything from outside. Forcibly attacking the barrier would only cause their own deaths. Hence, a lot of experts panicked like ants in a boiling pot, not knowing what to do.

After all, not many factions had known of this secret. And now that they all realized that they had been used, they were enraged but also felt profoundly helpless.

On the other hand, the High Firmament Academy’s side sighed with relief upon seeing the battle come to a pause. Almost all of the seniors had sweaty palms out of worry for the academy’s disciples.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Just now, that battle had really been frightening. The Dragonblood Legion’s side had been fighting against half of the lifeforms on the martial stage. That was an overwhelming force. Fortunately, they had managed to endure it.

After a moment of shock, they couldn’t help praising the Dragonblood Legion. Their combat power was absolutely astonishing. From top to bottom, they were experts amongst experts, elites amongst elites.

Most shocking of all was that their cooperation was practically flawless. It was like thousands of them had the same heart, so all their power was perfectly concentrated. If they worked together, their killing power could even make innate Heaven Venerates quiver.

With the fighting paused, the experts outside sighed with relief, and their attention switched to Long Chen and Xu Xin-er. Their next actions would affect the entire martial stage.

“What is your goal in telling me this? It seems that you are helping me. It couldn’t be that you disliked Xu Yifeng from the start, so you’re grateful to me for getting rid of him, right?” asked Long Chen curiously.

Xu Xin-er gritted her teeth furiously. “Grateful to you?! I want to tear you apart and drink your blood! I’m telling you this to end this senseless battle of attrition. Let’s get to the main course.”

“Oh? What main course?” asked Long Chen.

“Using some worthless lives to activate the karmic luck bead is essentially meaningless. Instead, I’m going to use all of your allies to activate the karmic luck bead. I want you to watch as everyone beside you dies one by one,” said Xu Xin-er sinisterly.

“With your power, this grand aspiration will probably never become reality,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Is that so? I don’t think so. The useless trash no longer wants to keep fighting and lose their lives. Now, they want the karmic luck as well. But if we slaughter your side, it’ll be enough. We only need the peak experts to make their moves, and all of you will be killed,” declared Xu Xin-er.

“Will they listen to your orders?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course not, but they have no other choice. Otherwise, we’ll just be wasting time. Your people just went through a large battle and are exhausted. If the peak experts attack now, they won’t stand a chance. Well, if they want to give your people some time to recover instead, I can’t do anything about it. We’ll just see whose patience is greater.” Xu Xin-er turned to Lian Wuying and the others. “You think you can just take advantage of the situation without putting in any work?”

Lian Wuying and the others’ expressions were dark. They didn’t reply.

Acting as if victory was in her grasp, Xu Xin-er turned back to Long Chen. “You killed my brother, so I will let you watch as your family is killed one by one in front of you. I won’t kill you right now, but I won’t let you assist them. I’ll show you what despair is, what it’s called to feel powerless.”

Suddenly, Xu Xin-er’s three beasts moved, surrounding Long Chen in their midst.
