Chapter 3209 Raging Flames Fill the Heavens

“Boss, you absorbed the true dragon essence blood, so they should be drawn to you, no?!” Qin Feng also saw that these sea serpents were eyeing him. He felt a chill.

“I didn’t use my dragon blood power, so they naturally didn’t sense it. Let’s not talk about such useless things. Those serpents are quite powerful. Since you drew them over, it’s on us to handle them. Luo Xue, please tell senior Luo Changwu that there’s no need for him to do anything big. I’ll deal with them,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen saw runes starting to light up on the commander tower. This was clearly the preparation for some big move, and such a thing would definitely cost a lot. Since the serpents were drawn over by them, he couldn’t make others pay the price for it.

Luo Xue hastily went to report it, but the commander tower’s runes continued to shine. Clearly, Luo Changwu was preparing for the worst case if Long Chen couldn’t stop the sea serpents.

Although it would cost an immense price, lives were always more important than money.

“Xiaole, bring Qin Feng into their midst. Buy me some time,” ordered Long Chen.

“Boss, can you not kill them all? Leave me one behind. I want to ride it back to the academy!” said Bai Xiaole. He wasn’t worried for Long Chen at all like the others. Instead, he was worried for the sea serpents.

“Scram! Is there any space in the academy to release such a thing? Get to work!” scolded Long Chen. This little fellow was actually thinking about getting himself a mount.

Bai Xiaole was still childish and liked to show off. He was a bit similar to Guo Ran in this regard. If the two of them met, they might become an inseparable pair.

Bai Xiaole sadly formed hand seals. In just a moment, he and Qin Feng vanished. Long Chen then stepped into the air, soaring up like a bolt of lightning.

As he held his right elbow with his left hand, a flame lotus gradually grew in front of him. He then began chanting, and the sound of a sacred sutra resounded throughout heaven and earth. At that moment, the entire world became fiery.

The flame lotus on Long Chen’s hand rapidly grew. As he chanted the Nirvana Scripture, flame energy gathered from every direction.

The fourth volume of the Nirvana Scripture was activated, filling the world with what sounded like the murmuring of gods. It was a sacred and holy aura that made even immortals and devils lower their heads.

At that moment, Long Chen seemed to become the god of fire. All the flame energies in the world were under his control, and they had to listen to him.

This was Long Chen’s first time going all-out with the fourth volume of the Nirvana Scripture. He hadn’t been able to use it before due to the worry that his body wouldn’t be able to endure such immense flame energy.

The other important thing was that in battles against others, he rarely had a chance to accumulate so much energy. After all, his enemies weren’t so stupid as to just patiently wait for him to accumulate power.

However, after refining the golden dragon scale and condensing the Golden Dragon Battle Armor, as well as advancing to the Four Peak realm, he no longer had so many misgivings. He freely utilized the flame energy of heaven and earth.

Bursts of flames gathered from every direction. Standing in the sky, Long Chen condensed all this flame energy into his flame lotus. It greedily consumed all this energy and rapidly inflated.

The flame lotus was like a starving beast. No matter how much it consumed, it never became full. It grew larger and larger along with its terrifying pressure. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Jaws dropped down below as people stared at that giant flame lotus. They felt a sensation of death coming from it, one that made their hair stand on end.

It had to be known that Long Chen’s lotus wasn’t targeting any of them. Despite that, these experts had a feeling that this thing could definitely take their lives.

At the Nine Prefecture Convention, Long Chen made his name known. In the Divine Flame realm, he had killed Divine Lords, even slaying the city lord of Silver Moon City, a late stage Divine Lord.

As for his heavenly tribulation that had wiped out all the experts of the Bloodkill Hall, that was a shocking matter, but no one here had seen it. When they heard such a thing, it was treated as nothing more than a story.

Some people even guessed that the heavenly tribulation was nothing more than a pretense, and what had truly wiped out the Bloodkill Hall’s experts was the current dean of the High Firmament Academy.

The dean had perhaps borrowed Long Chen’s tribulation to unleash a destructive blow. After all, they didn’t want to be accused of bullying the weak, so they made Long Chen the one responsible. At the same time, they gave him another layer of brilliant light.

Thus, most people only half believed that Long Chen’s tribulation had killed all those experts. They would be more willing to believe that the High Firmament Academy’s dean had secretly made a move. That made far more sense.

As a result, while there was no need to question Long Chen’s power, it hadn’t reached a mythic level. People trusted what they saw with their own eyes and judged the truth on what they had experienced.

The basic evaluation that most people had for the current Four Peak Long Chen was that he could definitely kill ordinary Divine Lords easily, but Primal Divine Lords would be a bit difficult. Perhaps one or two Primal Divine Lords weren’t a match for him, but he definitely wouldn’t be able to fight five of them at once.

Long Chen was still the number one figure of the junior generation in their hearts. It was just that people should be rational. They shouldn’t turn Long Chen into a god in their eyes.

However, when this flame lotus appeared, the world shuddered and the ten thousand Daos wailed. Ordinary Divine Lords were as tiny as ants in front of it.

“This fellow is even more terrifying than the stories…”

“He’s not human!”

“He’s a monster!”

The Four Peak Primals and the Divine Lords all stared in horror. From now on, if anyone else questioned Long Chen’s power, they would definitely beat them.

Long Chen’s flame lotus continued to grow. As for Bai Xiaole and Qin Feng, they were shuttling across the battlefield, occasionally appearing and then vanishing. Those sea serpents were crazily chasing down Qin Feng and couldn’t be bothered to even look at the other experts on the land.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s flame lotus began shuddering. Long Chen thought to himself, “My body is fine. But Huo Long has reached its limit.”

This flame lotus was controlled by Huo Long. When the flame energy of heaven and earth surpassed Huo Long’s control, that was a dangerous moment. It might just explode before even leaving his hand.

“However, this power is enough.”

Long Chen smiled. He suddenly shouted to Bai Xiaole, “Get out of the way!”

After that, the giant flame lotus fell down like a meteorite from outside the heavens, smashing straight toward those sea serpents.
