Chapter 4164 Who Are You Trying to Scare?

Outside the Starry River line’s land, seven elders had arrived. Other than one human, the rest were all from different races.

One of them was wearing a cloak all around their body with black qi swirling around them. However, upon closer examination, it became evident that beneath the cloak lay a skeletal figure, devoid of flesh and blood.

These seven people were all innate Heaven Venerates, and only the human expert was wearing robes of the Soaring Dragon Company.

Although these seven Heaven Venerates weren’t intentionally emitting their pressure, their auras still shook people’s hearts.

Normally, a single Heaven Venerate would be enough to shake an army. But now, seven had appeared at once.

Guo Ran might normally act as if all his enemies were beneath him, but now he couldn’t. He could only obediently follow behind Long Chen. Although he wanted to act like he wasn’t nervous, it wasn’t possible for him.

Other than him and Xia Chen, Huang Hui had also come, as well as a dozen Earth Venerates of the Starry River line. They were the pillars of this territory.

Seeing that so many Heaven Venerates had come, their expressions changed. It seemed that these people did not come with good intentions.

“What? After finding a few helpers, you want to settle our debts?” Long Chen appraised those people and curled his lips.

Other than the Soaring Dragon Company’s expert, it seemed that Long Chen couldn’t beat a single one of these Heaven Venerates. But he wasn’t afraid because he knew that none of them would dare to touch him at this time.

The elder of the Soaring Dragon Company cleared his throat and said, “This old man is here not to settle our personal grievances. Actually, the Soaring Dragon Company wishes to conduct some business with you.”

His voice was rather dry, and his expression was a bit nervous. In an instant, Long Chen understood their intention.

It seemed that this elder was forced to come here by these people who were after his Heaven Earth Cauldron.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You wish to buy my bronze cauldron?” Long Chen’s gaze swept over those experts.

“Do you truly have the Heaven Earth Cauldron?”

The skeletal lifeform spoke with an inhuman voice, sounding like white bones rubbing against each other, and it stabbed into people’s souls.

Long Chen glanced at that lifeform. “What a lacking question. How am I supposed to know if that bronze cauldron is the Heaven Earth Cauldron? When I obtained it, I had no idea what its origins were. It was the Soaring Dragon Company that swore it was the Heaven Earth Cauldron. And what kind of existence is the Soaring Dragon Company? They are renowned businessmen. How could they possibly lie about such a thing? If you offer a decent price, I’ll sell it. Truly, I really am sincere. Why would you even worry about it? In any case, there’s the Soaring Dragon Company as a guarantee. If the Soaring Dragon Company really did lie to you, couldn’t you just join forces and smash the Soaring Dragon Company? Their business is spread far and wide. As long as you do the same thing as me, I guarantee you’ll profit immensely. There’s more than enough for us to share.”

That elder from the Soaring Dragon Company was horrified by Long Chen’s words, so he hastily said, “Don’t spout nonsense! When did we ever say that we would guarantee anything?”

“You refuse to guarantee it? Then why would you spread word of it so far and wide? In the Violet Flame Heaven, you repeatedly said that my bronze cauldron was the Heaven Earth Cauldron. What, now you’re changing the story? How can anyone believe you when you say that you’re not an idiot then?” demanded Long Chen.

“Who are you calling an idiot?!”

“So you’re not an idiot? Then as businessmen, if you say things without confirming their veracity, who would do business with you? How can you say that you’re trying to do business with me? Either you guarantee that my cauldron is the Heaven Earth Cauldron, or you’re not trustworthy a businessman. Scram.” Long Chen pointed at the elder and cursed so wildly that saliva was spurting toward the latter.

Hearing this, the elder was enraged yet was left too stunned to retort. Back in the Violet Flame Heaven, they had insisted that Long Chen had the Heaven Earth Cauldron. It was only later on that they grew afraid of the consequences and switched to saying that they ‘suspected’ Long Chen of having the Heaven Earth Cauldron, not knowing the real origins of the bronze cauldron.

After that, Long Chen used that cauldron to shake an Eternal divine weapon, freeing the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse. That was something seen by countless people. Now, people truly began to wonder if it was the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

Because of that, six experts from different races got in touch with the Soaring Dragon Company, forcing them to say whether or not Long Chen really had the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

The Soaring Dragon Company was left dumbfounded. How would they know whether it was real or not? If they said it was true and it turned out to be false, they would offend countless people. But if they said it was fake, they would have been scamming people, which would also offend countless people.

Having not expected things to develop to this point, the Soaring Dragon Company came up with all kinds of excuses, brushing off any attempts to get to the bottom of the matter.

As a result, some people lost their patience and directly flipped the table, forcing the Soaring Dragon Company to give them an answer.

But what answer could the Soaring Dragon Company give them? Forced to this extent, they agreed to send someone to ask Long Chen for verification.

Considering that the Soaring Dragon Company was mortal enemies with Long Chen, for them to come to his door like this was an extremely humiliating thing for them.

So, this elder was the unlucky fellow who was forced to take this mission, burdened not only with the humiliation it entailed but also the looming fear of incurring the wrath of the six others who had forced him to come. He was in an extremely precarious position.

“Show us your bronze cauldron,” demanded the skeletal lifeform.

“Do you think I’ll take it out just because you want it? Who do you think you are?” sneered Long Chen.

“I’m from the Bone Devil Desolate Domain.”

This lifeform actually answered, not understanding Long Chen’s intention. He actually thought that Long Chen was asking about his origins.

“Don’t waste my time with this bullshit. It's you who sought to purchase my goods, not the other way around, alright? Keep in mind, you approached me, so you have to show your sincerity by coming from a lower position. I don’t care what your status or cultivation base is. I’ll say it again: fix your attitude or else forget it.” Long Chen looked down on that skeletal lifeform.

Hearing such disrespect, that lifeform was enraged. Black qi swirled out of him as if he was about to explode.

“Who do you think you’re trying to scare? Why don’t you just try and touch me?” sneered Long Chen.

As expected, that lifeform ultimately didn’t dare to do so, afraid of the curse. The curtains to the Sage King Convention had formally opened, so it was almost a sure thing for him to be cursed if he were to attack now.

“Hehe, that’s right. We’re doing business, right? We should get along better. That’s the only way to pull off our business successfully,” chortled Long Chen.

Long Chen then turned to the Soaring Dragon Company’s elder. “If you want to buy my bronze cauldron, it’s not outside the realm of question. However, I have a condition.”

Hearing that, the elder was delighted and hastily asked, “What is the condition?”
