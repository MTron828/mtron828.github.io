Chapter 2718 Gui Si

Mo Nian and the others were shocked. That terrifying monster was killed?

Mo Nian had managed to provoke him into charging onto the Martial Heaven Continent. After that, the Central Plains Cauldron blocked his exit, trapping him here.

“Hmph, I, Gui Si, will remember this enmity! I will definitely kill you when I descend upon the Martial Heaven Continent once more!”

Even though his body was destroyed, his voice still rang out. The staff in his hand suddenly shrank until it was a tiny needle, which then pierced through the void and vanished without a trace.

“He’s still not dead?” Mo Nian and the others were even more shocked. That was absolutely crazy. He could still flee in this state?

The divine sword in the sky also vanished once the elder fled. After that, the Central Plains Cauldron floated over to Mo Nian. “That fellow might have fled, but his Yuan Spirit is injured. He’ll need to recuperate, so you won’t need to worry about him temporarily.”

“Haha, so you mean I can go in whenever I want now?” Mo Nian’s eyes immediately lit up.

This terrifying elder had been injured, and the Central Plains Cauldron would be enough to deal with the other experts. This meant that Mo Nian would be able to cause as much trouble as he wanted.

“Up to you. But don’t randomly use my power unless you need to. I need to recuperate as well,” said the Central Plains Cauldron. It vanished. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Haha, senior, don’t worry. I, Mo Nian, am not someone who doesn’t know my limits.” Mo Nian laughed and suddenly furiously shouted toward the Corrupt God Cemetery. “What are you looking at? Everyone, listen up! Slaughter them!”

The Corrupt God Cemetery had quite a few experts of the Undying race who had chased Mo Nian and the others. However, after personally seeing their terrifying ancestor be beaten and flee, they were absolutely stunned. In that daze, arrows rained down on them.

These experts were the elders of the undying race, with cultivation bases mostly in the early and mid Heaven Merging realm. They had mostly come just as a show of power.

In truth, the Undying race had not used their true main forces to chase Mo Nian and the others, because although the younger generation of his people had been startled away, Gui Si had ordered them to focus on their cultivation and not chase.

Although they had been startled awake from their meditative states, as long as they didn’t move, they would be able to slowly enter that state again with some time. However, if they were to fight and have their blood get heated, their souls shaken, it would take far longer to calm themselves back down. At the very least, it would be a few days, maybe even ten days before they could enter a meditative state that would benefit their cultivation.

That was why Gui Si was the one to chase them away. It was to avoid having those disciples be affected.

As for the elders, their true trump cards were naturally not to be exposed so easily. That was why it was simply one peak elder leading a bunch of extras.

Now that the peak elder was injured and had fled, those extras met a calamity. The Dragonblood warriors chased them down all the way to Resentful Death City, slaughtering tens of thousands of experts.

Once they were forced back, Mo Nian didn’t continue chasing them. Quitting while they were ahead, he returned to the Martial Heaven Continent.

Upon returning, they started resting, and the elders of the Martial Heaven Continent took charge of guarding this channel.

Their purpose was mostly to give a warning to the main forces. No one was hoping for them to be able to stop the Undying race’s army.

“How did the other groups do?” asked Mo Nian.

Gu Yang laughed delightedly. “Things went even smoother for them. They didn’t encounter any old monsters like us. After killing the sneak attackers, they returned. It mostly went as expected. These four worlds definitely have some secret means of communication. It turns out that the other sneak attackers were also gathering at the same time as the group at Resentful Death City.

The sneak attacks of Resentful Death City, Devil Spirit Mountain, the Ancient Battlefield, and the Yin Yang World were too orderly. They were perfectly timed and couldn’t possibly be coincidences.

Furthermore, they were all preparing for the second wave at the same time. That basically confirmed that they were capable of communicating with each other.

“However, Wilde’s group went further than the others, so Wilde gained quite a bit of food. He charged all the way to the core of the Ancient Battlefield, and the report says that the Western Desert Ax unleashed its power to slay over ten of their late Heaven Merging experts. As for mid Heaven Merging experts and below, there’s no way to count how many were killed. Wilde’s food sack is now full,” said Gu Yang excitedly.

Wilde had become the master of the Western Desert Ax, and the latter needed an ocean’s worth of Blood Qi to recover. As for Wilde, he needed powerful meat to grow. Their cooperation was practically a match made in heaven.

The Western Desert Ax’s recovery speed was amazing. It could even benefit from using its power to slaughter the demonic beasts.

“Alright, based on the original plan, we’ll rest for seven days and then launch another sneak attack, disturbing the flow of their world so that they can’t properly cultivate,” said Mo Nian.

The Dragonblood Legion focused on cultivating. With the Heaven Merging Pills refined by Meng Qi and the others, their cultivation speed was extremely fast. Within the formation, they didn’t need to enter a meditative state as they were directly absorbing energy from the pills.

As a result, Mo Nian and the Mo family’s legion benefitted immensely from cultivating with them and borrowing the power of the medicinal pills.

The only regretful thing to Mo Nian was that he and the other disciples of the Mo family were unable to absorb the Heaven Merging Pills specifically refined by Long Chen. They didn’t have dragon blood power or the correct cultivation technique. Forcibly absorbing it would injure them, making it not worth it.

On the other hand, the Dragonblood warriors’ astral spaces had continued growing thanks to Long Chen’s medicinal pills, all the way to the point that they were three times larger than they originally were.

They reached their limit around there. However, their astral spaces were already very large compared to an ordinary person. Having them grow three times made their future potential limitless.

Seven days later, as planned, Mo Nian launched another sneak attack. However, the instant they arrived, a huge number of enemies swarmed them. This place was being guarded by late Heaven Merging experts, and it seemed that they were intent on preventing Mo Nian and the others from entering Resentful Death City through the Corrupt God Cemetery.

Fortunately, with the help of the Central Plains Cauldron, Mo Nian managed to break through their defenses, charging into Resentful Death City and unleashing a single arrow.

That arrow had a formation carved into it by Mo Nian, and it exploded like a firework, instantly throwing the laws of heaven and earth into chaos. Although it was almost immediately fixed, that instant startled all the experts awake from their meditative states.

After unleashing that one arrow, Mo Nian led the Dragonblood warriors and the Mo family’s disciples away once more, infuriating the Undying race’s experts.

Mo Nian’s last arrow had disturbed them, causing people to take two or three days to once more enter their meditative state. Some weaker people took five or six days.

Some of them had just entered their meditative states when they were awoken, driving them crazy. It was like someone with insomnia who had just fallen asleep was suddenly awoken by a cannon firing beside their ear.

This fury resulted in them being even more difficult to calm down and enter the meditative state once more. The Undying race’s experts were infuriated. They strengthened their defenses, making sure to catch Mo Nian and the others the next time they dared to attack.

As a result, this time, Mo Nian didn’t wait for seven days. Instead, he returned on the very next day.
