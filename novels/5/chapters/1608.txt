Chapter 1603 The Core Region of the Nine Springs

Translator: BornToBe

“If there are treasures, then I’m definitely interested. However, aren’t you afraid of me killing you and taking the treasures all for myself when the time comes?” asked Long Chen.

At first, this girl had intentionally acted big toward Long Chen. However, later on, her hostility had faded.

Although Long Chen wasn’t afraid of her, he couldn’t go somewhere unknown without making things clear first. Who wouldn’t want a free meal? He didn’t want to be devoured by this girl.

“Hehe, you wouldn’t. You have the spiritual mark of the Butterfly Spirit race on your hand. That means you’re a good person and wouldn’t kill me. Furthermore, you shouldn’t look down on me. I’m not so easy to kill.” The woman pointed to the back of Long Chen’s hand. “If it weren’t for the mark of the Butterfly Spirit race, then do you think I’d work with you considering your fierce face?”

So that was the case. However, did he really have such a fierce face? Long Chen touched his face. He had never felt himself to look so fierce. He thought his looks actually weren’t bad.

“Don’t think you can cover up your heart so easily. You’ve killed many people, and you can’t conceal it. Back in the day, I was also a very handsome dragon, but after killing so many creatures... ah, fuck, whatever,” said the Evilmoon.

“Killing too much results in your appearance changing? I don’t believe you,” said Long Chen.

“I also didn’t believe it, but reality proves it. Those who kill too many people start looking fierce. You’ve killed so many people from the Corrupt path. Don’t they all look that way?” said Evilmoon.

That couldn’t be right. The people they killed were all innocent, and so they accumulated resentment. However, when Long Chen killed people, he always kept his conscience clean. It was definitely because he had been under too much pressure these days. Yes, that had to be why his appearance looked so fierce.

“Little sister...” Long Chen put on a smile and did his best to speak warmly.

The woman jumped in shock and hastily retreated. “Your smile is so sinister. Can you not smile like that? I’m afraid.”

“Hahaha...”

Long Chen’s smile stiffened, while Evilmoon’s heartless laughter rang out in his mind, making him want to slap it.

Seeing Long Chen’s expression sink, the woman laughed. “I’m just teasing you. Who asked you to con me at the start? Now we’re even.”

So he had actually fallen for the teasing of a girl. Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

After that joke, she became even friendlier with Long Chen. She introduced herself as Xie Qianqian. She came from a region called the Alldevil star-field.

“The Alldevil star-field? Have you heard of the Alldevil race?” asked Long Chen, surprised.

“You know about the Alldevil race?” asked Xie Qianqian, just as surprised as Long Chen.

Long Chen immediately said that he had encountered one of them in a minor world. He described its appearance. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“That truly is one of the bastards of the Alldevil race. The majority of the Alldevil star-field has been taken over by them, which is of course where it gets its name. Those despicable bastards slaughtered countless people. We’re their enemies, and my parents, they... they were killed by them.” Tears dripped down her cheek without her knowing it.

Long Chen didn’t know how to console her. He could only silently listen. Xie Qianqian wiped away her tears and continued.

“That happened three years ago. My parents died in battle. While they were still alive, all the relatives did their best to curry favor with them, but after they died, they immediately showed me their true selves. They were doing their best to win favor with me in order to get my parent’s wealth. Hmph, I knew what kind of people they were from the start, so I sold off all my parents’ assets and left my household. I’m going to become strong and become a grand warrior capable of avenging my parents. That’s why I want to study at my star-field’s strongest academy. However, I can’t afford their tuition, so I bet everything on renting this special flying boat in hopes of getting a high return when I attacked the Life and Death realm. Oh, that would be your Netherpassage realm. Long Chen, I really need to thank you. This life spirit water should be enough for my tuition. Even if it’s not enough, I should be able to make up the difference through other means.”

Long Chen nodded. He really had misjudged her. He had thought that this woman had come out to play since she belonged to some powerful family with amazing treasures.

Just like he had his own difficulties, she had hers as well.

“Admirable.”

Long Chen gave her a thumbs-up along with some sincere praise.

A confused girl who had come out of nowhere was actually someone who relied only on herself to charge her way forward, betting her life in the Netherworld. Such a person was worthy of respect.

“Long Chen, I’ve told you my experiences. Can you tell me yours? Otherwise, I’ll have lost out,” said the woman. For her to still be able to joke with Long Chen showed that her heart was still full of sunshine.

“Me?” Long Chen was startled and shook his head. “I don’t have any good stories. I have a father, a mother, and a little sister, all living very well. When I was little, I had a carefree life. When I got older... I had to bear more responsibility, so I was busier. A few ‘friends’ like to mess around with me, so we scuffle all day. Some hills form, some little streams flow. But I have to say, it’s very lively.”

Long Chen put it very lightly. The mountains of corpses and rivers of blood that flowed from his battles had been turned into tiny scuffles. Xie Qianqian didn’t manage to hear that aspect of his words and thought that he really did live happily, making her a bit envious.

“Qianqian, what is the Butterfly Spirit race?” asked Long Chen.

“The Butterfly Spirit race is a kind race but also a very powerful one. They have immense power, and their illusion arts are especially terrifying. Within the same realm, practically no one can resist them. However, they have a fatal weakness, which is fire. That’s why they reside in water spirit worlds, as there’s no fire element that can threaten them there. However, this information is just things that I’ve heard. I’ve never encountered anyone from the Butterfly Spirit race. However, I know they’re pure-hearted. They practically never mark others, and those they do are all good people. That’s why I’m willing to work together with you. You might not even realize that when you circulate your energy, a butterfly mark flashes on your hand.”

With that advice, Long Chen looked down to see an almost imperceptible mark on his hand. It was a butterfly that was slowly flapping its wings.

Hopefully, it didn’t stay once he returned. There was no way for him to explain this.

“Where are those treasures you mentioned? Don’t worry, no matter how many there are, I’ll split them evenly with you,” promised Long Chen.

“I guarantee there are treasures. When I was collecting the life spirit water, I got curious and went deeper to see where the nine springs gather. There are countless precious stones there with frightening fluctuations. The suction there is also very powerful, so I didn’t dare to go. I’m just wondering if you have any method of handling it,” said Xie Qianqian.

“As long as the treasures are good enough, even if there’s no way to obtain them, I have to think of some way to do so. Let’s go have a look.” Long Chen’s eyes began to shine.

The whirlpool of the nine lakes flowed down in a waterfall and then flowed back up. That was where the nine springs gathered. The only possibilities were that there would be no treasures, or whatever treasures there were had to be stunningly precious.

Xie Qianqian controlled the flying boat, having it descend in the white lake. As it descended, countless runes lit up on the flying boat, blocking the white water.

Long Chen’s World Trees had already grown to their limit, so he didn’t need to gather more of it.

If he continued gathering it, then based on his experience, it would transform into the divine life elixir.

However, he didn’t dare to gather more. The final few times he had collected the life spirit water and death spirit water, he hadn’t been able to get much at all before the world had started shuddering. That meant that he had already reached a kind of limit. Taking any more would very likely cause trouble.

The two of them were descending deeper and deeper. Long Chen estimated that this place might be even deeper than the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. However, despite the immense pressure, the flying boat was fine.

“It really is worth spending all your savings on renting. This flying boat is a priceless treasure,” sighed Long Chen.

Xie Qianqian shook her head. “In truth, this flying boat isn’t that amazing. It’s not a fighting flying boat. However, it is made of special Nether Iron and isn’t rejected in the Netherworld, which is what allows it to enter and what makes it so precious.”

Xie Qianqian was a bit vexed. The flying boat clearly hadn’t been as amazing as she had thought when she had rented it.

If she hadn’t encountered Long Chen, then who knew how long it would have taken her to fill up those bottles of hers? Furthermore, something had happened to her bottles and that had caused the space inside them to shrink. They had lost effect once she had come to the Netherworld. Once she returned, she would definitely have to settle the bill with the person who had rented them to her.

Long Chen sighed inside. As expected, the outer world was truly mysterious. Such an amazing flying boat was viewed as rubbish by Xie Qianqian. He truly felt like a frog at the bottom of a well.

The flying boat was still descending. A general image appeared in Long Chen’s head. The nine springs formed a circular sea, with the whirlpool at the center and the Gates of Hell at the bottom.

However, despite the Gates of Hell being located not far from the bottom of the nine springs, they weren’t actually the bottom of the nine springs. That was completely incomprehensible.

Everything was white as they descended. However, after a while, intense fluctuations came from below, and the flying boat began to shake.

“Look! That’s the core of the nine springs!” Xie Qianqian carefully controlled the flying boat as she pointed in a certain direction.
