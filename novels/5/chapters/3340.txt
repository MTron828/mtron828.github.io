Chapter 3329 Furiously Attacking Tian Mo

Long Chen could have killed Mo Yan just now, but Tian Mo just had to interrupt him. When Tian Mo released his aura, Long Chen felt his head buzz. Killing intent exploded out of him.

Tian Mo’s dagger was infected with the blood of nine star heirs, and their undying will still remained on it.

Thus, when Tian Mo activated the power of his dagger, it also released that will, which caused Long Chen to go insane.

As a result, heaven and earth changed color. When the stars in the sky vanished, lightning howled. The entire world was covered by a terrifying killing intent.

“It’s here again!”

Seeing this manifestation, countless experts cried out in shock. Back in the plaza, Long Chen’s killing intent had also caused the same kind of phenomenon. Now it was back and was even crazier.

The heavens seemed to collapse. Long Chen’s killing intent caused everyone to feel terror, and members of all races were terrified.

“Die!”

Long Chen then roared like a celestial god. His saber slashed down, accompanied by wind and lightning. This saber was something that couldn’t be avoided whether you ascended to the heavens or fled to the depths of hell.

Seeing Long Chen go crazy, Tian Mo snorted. He then formed one-handed seals as he shouted, “Palace master, hear your follower’s call! Bestow me your divine power to slay my enemies!”

A golden figure appeared behind Tian Mo. After that, a terrifying pressure crashed down, one that caused even Immortal Kings to quiver. They almost prostrated themselves toward it.

“The divine radiance of a World King?!”

Tian Mo actually summoned the might of a World King, the master of the Nine Underworld Hall that was on the same level as Enpuda.

BOOM!

Divine light roared. After that, Long Chen’s saber crashed down, and the divine radiance of the World King was blown apart. Long Chen and Tian Mo were both knocked back.

“Heavens, Long Chen is still fighting evenly against him! That… that’s insane!”

Everyone was shocked. They knew that a World King’s divine radiance contained spiritual pressure along with mental pressure. Even Immortal Kings would be severely affected. For Long Chen to be able to fight Tian Mo equally was astonishing.

“Split the Heavens!” 

With a final step, Long Chen stabilized himself, causing the void to collapse beneath him. A giant saber-image then soared into the sky.

Long Chen clenched his teeth furiously. He could see a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood behind Tian Mo. Those were the corpses of the nine star heirs that the latter had killed.

At that moment, it felt like he was seeing the corpses of Dragonblood warriors. He felt an indescribable connection to his fellow nine star heirs, and it was this that drove him crazy.

When Long Chen once more activated Split the Heavens, time and space froze. All the killing intent within heaven and earth was absorbed by his saber.

Tian Mo was shocked. He suddenly found that he couldn’t possibly block this saber. Terrified, he quickly formed hand seals and rapidly aged by sacrificing his own essence blood and longevity.

“Palace master divine radiance, Nine Underworld God Palm!”

The divine statue behind Tian Mo glowed. After that, a hand stretched out, and its light condensed into an incomprehensible divine mark.

When this palm appeared, the void crumbled. This was no longer Tian Mo’s attack but the attack of a World King!

BOOM!

The saber-image smashed into the divine palm. At that exact moment, everyone’s vision turned black as the world lost all its color. Following it, within this black world, a speck of light rapidly grew until it illuminated the world once more.

The world shook, and laws were in chaos. The very order of the world seemed to be upside-down.

Within a chaotic flow of spacetime, the saber-image and the palm vanished simultaneously. Long Chen then coughed up blood, cracks covering his entire body. 

This was truly an attack containing the power of a World King. It possessed the possibility of killing Long Chen. Under normal circumstances, Long Chen wouldn’t receive it directly.

However, in his current fury, he felt like if he didn’t unleash his rage, he would die holding it back. He could only fight directly.

The palace master owed a blood debt to countless nine star heirs. Facing him, as a fellow nine star heir, Long Chen couldn’t possibly retreat.

Tian Mo also coughed up blood. His hair had turned white, and wrinkles covered his face. He instantly aged to the point where he almost looked like a corpse.

He had sacrificed his essence blood and longevity to unleash an attack containing the power of a World King. But it still wasn’t enough to kill Long Chen.

A bone saber stabbed through Tian Mo’s chest and out his back. But there was no blood on the blade.

That was because Tian Mo had used all his blood. Even if Long Chen didn’t kill him, he wouldn’t live for long.

If Tian Mo had managed to kill Long Chen with that attack, he would immediately flee. It was because the Nine Underworld Hall had a secret art to allow him to survive. But in return, his primal bloodline would fade away.

He had only used this self-harming trump card because he had no other choice. But Long Chen was merely injured, not killed. Tian Mo already gave up hope when he saw that.

Seeing Long Chen’s furious gaze, Tian Mo smiled. “Little fellow, even if you kill me, it’s useless. The Nine Underworld Hall has set its sights on you. I am nothing more than the seventh rank of the Heaven Fiend Rankings. After I die, the higher rankings will come for you. Rank one in particular is the palace master’s sole disciple. His power is something you can never imagine. Just wait, you will die in endless agony…!”

Knowing that he was definitely dead, Tian Mo was calm. His smile was sinister, and his words were like a devil’s curse.

Flames of rage burned in Long Chen’s eyes. He furiously said, “Since your Nine Underworld Hall wishes to provoke me, then there’s no need for you to come find me. I’ll come find you. I, Long Chen, swear on the stars of the nine heavens that I will slaughter everyone from the Nine Underworld Hall within the nine heavens and ten lands. As for your death, it will be my declaration of war to the Nine Underworld Hall.”

With a shake of his arm, Tian Mo’s withered body exploded. However, there was no blood mist this time, only some white flakes.

This was a shocking scene to watch. The terrifying assassin of the Nine Underworld Hall had been slain by Long Chen. Furthermore, Long Chen had blocked the attack containing a World King’s power and swore to kill all the Nine Underworld Hunters in the world. 

The Nine Underworld Hall was an existence that countless people couldn’t even touch, but Long Chen swore to destroy it. If it came from someone else’s mouth, it would only lead to others scoffing at them.

However, when these words came from Long Chen’s mouth, people couldn’t help quivering. They knew that Long Chen wasn’t saying this as a threat. In other words, in the future, between Long Chen and the Nine Underworld Hall, only one would survive in this world.

The current Long Chen was soaked in blood. Killing intent continued to soar out of him. He was like a demon about to slaughter all the lifeforms of the nine heavens.

“His aura is dropping! He’s already injured. Kill him!”

Just as people were stunned by Long Chen’s appearance, Mo Yan shouted a reminder to everyone.

Mo Yan was the first to shoot toward Long Chen. He could clearly sense that in that last exchange, Long Chen’s aura had dropped. This was their best chance to kill him. Mo Yan was the one who hated Long Chen the most amongst everyone.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With Mo Yan moving, everyone else did as well. Only when the rainbow hydrangeas scattered would the Heavenly Rainbow Flame choose a new master.

Long Chen looked at Mo Yan coldly. It seemed that Long Chen had no intention of facing him, but Mo Yan felt a chill. Even his hair stood on end, and a sensation of utmost danger filled his heart.

He instantly got a bad feeling. His intuition was screaming at him that Long Chen was more dangerous than ever at this time. Halfway toward Long Chen, Mo Yan suddenly stopped and turned to run.

Unfortunately, at this moment, a lightning sword stabbed through his back. A black-robed maiden had silently appeared behind him, and the lightning sword was held in her hand.
