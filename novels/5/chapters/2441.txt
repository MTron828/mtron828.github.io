Chapter 2431 Ghost Ship

Translator: BornToBe

Everyone found that they had appeared on a giant island floating in the void. There were countless stars around them.

“Where is this place?”

It felt like they had been transported into the boundless cosmos. Furthermore, there were already millions of experts present. They outnumbered the total experts of the Martial Heaven Continent.

Those experts were wearing robes of the divine families. Amongst them, some waved to Long Chen. Long Chen recognized them to be the warriors from the eighth legion.

Long Chen waved back, but the warriors of the eighth legion were drowned out by the countless disciples of the divine families that were present. There was a veritable tide of them. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples whispered amongst themselves.

“Everyone, don’t panic. This is the entrance to the Star Field Divine World.”

An ancient voice rang out. Everyone looked over to see two towering stone pillars. The space between them was in constant flux, and it was impossible to see past them.

In front of this strange gateway was a white-haired elder.

“Senior Pill Doyen?” Long Chen was startled. This elder was actually the Pill Doyen from the Divine Pill Division.

He quickly realized the reason that it wasn’t someone from the four divine families was due to the hostile relations between them. They needed an unbiased party for this to avoid any suspicions of favoritism.

The Pill Doyen’s position within the divine families was extremely high, but he did not belong to any of the four families. So he was the one most suited to this task.

“Let me make the introductions. This senior is the Pill Doyen of the divine families. His status is equivalent to the leaders of the four divine families. Don’t miss anything he says, because it could determine whether you live or die.” A Heaven Elder gave an introduction to those who didn’t know the Pill Doyen.

Long Chen hadn’t seen this Elder before, so he didn’t know what family he came from. He was rather cold, and everyone’s whispering fell silent.

Seeing that no one was talking or privately speaking spiritually, the Elder nodded. He bowed toward the Pill Doyen and indicated that he could continue.

The Pill Doyen smiled and stepped forward. “The Star Field Divine World can be considered the path that connects the Martial Heaven Continent and the Divine World. It is also a place that people often claim to be the Pathway to Immortality or the Staircase to Godhood.”

A ruckus exploded. Even Long Chen was shocked. The Pathway to Immortality, the Staircase to Godhood? Didn’t this mean that one could become a god or an immortal here?

“Silence!” shouted the Elder. His voice was like thunder piercing people’s ears.

The Pill Doyen waved his hand. “It’s fine. Everyone will react like this when they hear such a thing. You don’t need to be so strict. You’re going to scare them. If there are any questions, please go ahead and ask.”

Seeing no one ask even after the Pill Doyen permitted questions, Long Chen finally opened his mouth. “Senior Pill Doyen, this little one is curious. The era of gods and immortals has passed. Isn’t it impossible for anyone from the Martial Heaven Continent to become a god or immortal in this era? How does that relate to the Pathway to Immortality and the Staircase to Godhood?”

The Pill Doyen laughed. “This is a good question. Hopefully everyone can relax slightly. If no one asked anything, it would have been awkward for me. In my old age, I don’t know what things I should talk about and what I shouldn’t. If I just prattled on and repeated the same thing a dozen times, it would be embarrassing.”

The Pill Doyen’s amicable air made everyone feel better. The reason no one had dared to ask anything was because of his high status. He was an existence equivalent to the four leaders of the divine families. They were afraid of asking the wrong question and offending him.

Long Chen’s question made them sigh in relief. Long Chen was really the one with the biggest guts on the Martial Heaven Continent.

They didn’t know that Long Chen had already had an interaction with the Pill Doyen. His competition with Ye Qian was nothing honorable to the divine families, so while the Pill Doyen was fine with it, the divine families had locked down that information, making it forbidden to spread. So while people knew of Long Chen’s competition with Feng Fei, they didn’t know about his pill battle with Ye Qian.

The Pill Doyen said, “Long Chen’s question is something I’m sure many people are also wondering about. From historical records, everyone knows that since the battle of the immortal era, the cultivation path has been severed. Gods and immortals still exist, but there are no longer cases of people being able to reach that realm. There are still inheritances of gods present, but they were left behind from that time. Any divine decrees that come are sent from an unknown world. The world of the gods isn’t something that we know about. This Star Field Divine World was the only path for the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts to become a god or immortal before the battle of the immortal era. But after that battle, the Star Field Divine World was broken. It is now ruined, and what is left are its remains. So using this place to become a god or immortal isn’t very likely.”

It was just some ruined wreckage? Hearing that, people were disappointed. So the stories of that time were not just myths. People really had been able to become gods or immortals, enjoying the same lifespan as the very world.

The Pill Doyen continued, “However, you don’t need to feel discouraged. Although the Star Field Divine World has crumbled, there are still relics left behind by countless experts. If you can obtain them, they can change your entire life. The Star Field Divine World was what connected the Martial Heaven Continent to the Divine World. Before being broken, countless treasures and inheritances were left behind. After being broken, even Sovereigns and Emperors have gone through it and left behind their own marks on it. If you are lucky enough, you could obtain one of their inheritances as well.”

After hearing that, people’s blood ignited once more. Sovereigns were supreme existences. Even the slightest inheritance from them would be enough to turn someone into a peerless genius.

During Long Chen’s tribulation, everyone was stunned by Sovereign Mo Li’s combat prowess. That was their first time seeing a Sovereign fight.

Although they had ended up injuring each other in the end, and the Sovereign had dissipated, allowing Long Chen to pass, who could say that Sovereign Mo Li hadn’t appeared incredibly domineering? Even doing his best, Long Chen hadn’t been able to block him. He had barely managed to pass.

Sovereign Mo Li had called Long Chen brother, so letting him pass was within reason. Even blind people could guess that Long Chen’s passing wasn’t based on actual power.

Within his generation, Long Chen was undefeated. But he hadn’t even been able to retaliate against a Sovereign who had been in the same realm as him. At that time, Sovereign Mo Li hadn’t even unleashed any shocking techniques but had still completely suppressed Long Chen.

It could be seen just how terrifying Sovereigns were. On the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen could be considered unrivaled, but he still wasn’t a match for a Sovereign. How could they not be excited that they could encounter the inheritance of a Sovereign?

“Senior Pill Doyen, this disciple has a question. Please excuse my rudeness,” Nangong Zuiyue suddenly spoke, bowing toward the Pill Doyen.

“You're too courteous. Please ask. As long as I know the answer and can speak of it, I will answer,” said the Pill Doyen.

“I have heard that the Star Field Divine World is not just the path that connected the Martial Heaven Continent with the Divine World, but is also one of the paths of reincarnation of the Heavenly Daos. I have heard that you can encounter a Ghost Ship within it. May I know if this is simply a rumor or a fact?” asked Nangong Zuiyue. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Many disciples had heard of a Ghost Ship as well, and their hearts pounded. There was a legend that within this world there was a kind of extremely bizarre existence, something that floated through the realm of Yin and Yang, past and future.

A Ghost Ship was also called a Cursed Ship or a Ship of Calamity. Anyone who had seen one was struck by misfortune. Worst of all, they couldn’t even mention it, or those who heard of it would also be cursed.

It was an existence found only in legend. There were no actual records of it recorded. In the current era, they were considered stories people had dreamed up. They were stories used to scare children, not real things.

However, as a peerless heavenly genius of the ancient era, the top expert of an everlasting family, Nangong Zuiyue would not bring up nonsense, especially not here. For her to mention such a thing, she had to know something.

The Pill Doyen smiled and nodded. “As expected of an everlasting family. You even know of the Ghost Ship. I’ll explain a bit about the Ghost Ship. The stories about it are just stories, but the Ghost Ship truly exists. Not just that, but there was someone from the Martial Heaven Continent who once forcibly stopped such a boat.”

“What?!”
