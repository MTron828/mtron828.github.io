Chapter 3451 Loan Shark Returns

Long Chen’s actions horrified countless people, but Qin Feng and Qi Yu didn’t even react. They were already used to it.

Rumbling sounds rang out within their bodies, as their Blood Qi was raised to the pinnacle. The two of them knew that this was the true tribulation. Before this, they had just been looking after the others.

BOOM!

The heavenly tribulation quivered, and the levels of those ancient corpses instantly soared to the late Immortal King realm.

“Kill!”

Qin Feng and Qi Yu shouted at the same time, charging into the clouds and obliterating those ancient corpses that descended from the heavens.

The two of them blasted through the current of ancient corpses, and their divine weapons quivered as they attacked fearlessly. At this moment, they displayed bravery that moved countless people.

“What a powerful battle intent. They are true warriors.”

There were dozens of experts behind Bai Zhantang. They were the elites of the Battle God Palace and had also experienced countless battles. But seeing Qin Feng and Qi Yu charge against the heavens, they were still moved. They felt great respect and admiration for the two of them.

Heavenly tribulation was the supreme will of the heavens. Not just anyone could simply defy that will and resist the suppression of their souls.

A normal person had great reverence for the Heavenly Daos, so they didn’t dare to do anything like this. But Qin Feng and Qi Yu were different. They had started undergoing tribulation with Long Chen in the mortal world. Every single time was a fight against the heavens, so they had long since been accustomed to it.

Bai Shishi also charged up when she saw the two of them go against the flow. The three of them were attacking the current of lightning, slaughtering those ancient corpses.

Many ancient corpses also charged at Long Chen, but before they could even get close, they were devoured by lightning dragons.

“AHH!”

Just then, those disciples being protected at the rear began to wake up, screaming in pain.

They were bound by lightning chains, and runes were being forcibly merged into their bodies. The pain woke them out of their slumber.

As the lightning dragons devoured the ancient corpses, a portion of their lightning runes were sent to these disciples. As a result, their skin split open, and veins popped on their foreheads. The pain almost drove them insane.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, I can’t endure it! Please let me go! I’m going to die!”

A disciple cried out. It felt like he was going through the worst torture of his life. His physical body and soul were going to be torn apart.

Everyone began to wake up and scream as if they had gone crazy. But bound by the chains, they couldn’t escape.

“Don’t worry, you won’t die. At most… you’ll be driven crazy.” Long Chen shrugged helplessly.

“AH!”

As more lightning runes were injected into their bodies, they were experiencing a hellish torment. That pain was something that they had never imagined before.

“Boss, I’m not playing any longer! Let me out!”

Bai Xiaole screamed, even crying. He felt like he really would die.

However, all their pleas fell on deaf ears. Long Chen continued to look up at the sky.

Bai Xiaole’s mother was also in pain watching this. Bai Xiaole’s current state was truly miserable. His eyes looked like they were about to pop out, and he was clearly enduring unimaginable pain.

Bai Shishi’s mother held her hand and comforted, “Junior sister, don’t worry. Long Chen won’t let Xiaole be injured. In order to transform into a butterfly, you must experience the pain of breaking free of the cocoon.”

“I know… but… I can’t help feeling aggrieved.” Bai Xiaole’s mother shook her head tearfully. She understood the principle, but that feeling wasn’t something others could comprehend.

Bai Zhantang was clenching his teeth furiously. Although he had also beaten up Bai Xiaole for his own good, at least he had held back the appropriate amount. Seeing Bai Xiaole in this state, it felt like his heart was being cut up.

Bai Xiaole fainted and woke up from the pain several times. The same occurred to others. But no matter how they cried out, Long Chen ignored them.

Bai Shishi was still capable of enduring up in the sky. But Qin Feng and Qi Yu were covered in blood. It was unknown how many wounds they were covered in. These late stage Immortal King corpses all had combat experience. They were actual experts, different from the previous ones.

Despite their wounds, the two of them continued to fight. That brave and ruthless fighting style of theirs even shook the Battle God Palace’s experts.

“I heard that Dean Long Chen’s Dragonblood Legion has over ten thousand people, and these two are only the most ordinary warriors of them. I can’t imagine what they would be like if Dean Long Chen managed to gather them all up again,” said one of the Battle God Palace’s experts.

Qin Feng and Qi Yu’s display shocked them all. The two of them were so powerful, to the point that others almost felt like there was no point in living any longer. Neither of them was particularly talented, but they were inexplicably powerful.

It was like they lived for battle. Every single one of their moves was executed perfectly without any waste. There were countless times when they brushed right up against death, but just as it seemed as if there was nothing they could do to get out, they slipped right through the danger. Just watching them fight made others sweat, and they felt their hearts clench.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a chain wrapped around Qi Yu’s waist and pulled him back. Qi Yu’s body was covered in wounds. He was a mass of bloody flesh, but he still shouted, “Boss, I can keep fighting!”

“No need. Save a bit of energy to draw the thunderforce into your body. Going too far is as bad as not going far enough,” said Long Chen.

After a bit, Long Chen also dragged in Qin Feng, having them conserve just the slightest bit of energy so that their minds were still clear. If they were to draw in the thunderforce to temper their bodies themselves, it would definitely be much more effective than being forced to have the lightning runes enter their bodies.

At this moment, golden light bloomed out of Bai Shishi’s body. Her Sword Qi continued to cut down the ancient corpses. Also, her fear of the Ghost Dao’s aura had faded. She was capable of unleashing all her power against them.

However, there were truly too many of them. Her mental energy was rapidly exhausted, and she was down to less than thirty percent now. But she continued to persevere.

She also knew that this was a rare chance. She had to erase her fear of the Ghost Dao.

Suddenly, the tribulation clouds rumbled. They began to roil and gather, as if some energy was drawing them in.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the ancient corpses fighting her exploded. Long Chen had a bad feeling rise within him.

“Lei Linger, devour all the lightning!”

Countless lightning dragons flew into the sky, devouring the lightning runes. But the ones that weren’t devoured flew into the clouds.

The lightning dragons only managed to absorb half of them before the rest entered the tribulation clouds. After that, the tribulation clouds quivered and began to pull in on themselves.

The ten thousand miles of tribulation clouds finally compressed into a humanoid figure. That figure’s face then gradually grew clearer.

“It’s him!”

Long Chen and Bai Shishi cried out at the same time. That person was holding a sword identical to the one in Bai Shishi’s hand.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
