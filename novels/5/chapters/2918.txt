“That’s too fast, isn’t it?!”

“They have too many people. Over four hundred people are lighting the lamps together, so they are naturally fast.”

“The activation of the barrier almost always means that the competition is over. Ugh, the power disparity is too great.”

“It’s not power disparity but wealth disparity. In this world, if you have money, you can get anything that you desire.”

The barrier around the altar meant that if Long Chen and the others wished to enter the altar, they would have to break through the formation first. But Chu Kuang and the others would not just allow them to freely attack the formation. This meant that Long Chen no longer had any chance.

“Hahaha, the barrier has been activated. Victory is in grasp. Guys, there’s no need to have any mercy. Teach these fools a lesson!”

Chu Kuang instantly became arrogant. With the barrier activated, he no longer had any of his previous cautiousness. He knew that he had already won.

He left behind a hundred people inside of the barrier to light up the lamps. However, the final two lamps would take at least two hours to illuminate even with a hundred people working together. They were the ones that took the longest to light up.

However, with the barrier active, Chu Kuang no longer had any misgivings. Other than the hundred people inside, everyone else swarmed over Mu Qingyun and the others.

“Kill!”

Li Cai roared furiously and charged forward, along with Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the rest of the Unfettered Alliance’s experts that were arriving.

Mu Qingyun was heavily injured and unable to continue fighting. They had to protect her and buy time for Long Chen to arrive.

“Kill? Who are you going to kill? You’re the ones who are going to die!”

Yuan Xinghui smashed his bronze rod at Li Cai with his full power. A powerful gust raged.

BOOM!

Seeing this, Li Cai also became ruthless and slashed his sword with his full power. But as a result, his hands were broken, and his broadsword was sent flying.

It wasn’t that Li Cai’s power was inferior, but simply that he wasn’t skilled with heavy weapons yet. Because of it, he was naturally at a disadvantage.

“Trash. Scram!” Yuan Xinghui’s hand was left bloody from the exchange, but he furiously attacked once more.

With his weapon gone, Li Cai was struck in the chest. His upper body collapsed, and he vomited blood. If it weren’t for his tough physical body, that strike would have flattened him.

The other disciples charging forward were also sent flying and injured in the first exchange.

Even Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu were defeated. Moreover, another disciple had his head cut off, his corpse falling to the ground.

Their opponents were too powerful. These were people that Chu Kuang had bought with his money. In the entire Unfettered Alliance, the only one who could match them was Mu Qingyun. However, she was heavily injured and couldn’t fight any longer.

“Do you know why I wasted so much effort and resources on this competition? I wanted to beat you in your most confident state. First, I let you see hope before I showed you what despair is. Those who go against me, Chu Kuang, never have good endings. I will break your confidence and leave a shadow in your hearts for the rest of your lives. I, Chu Kuang, will be your eternal nightmare. I heard that during your training with Long Chen, you learned how to face death? Does that mean that you’re no longer afraid of dying? Good, then if anyone shouts that they admit defeat, I’ll make sure that their line is severed. Not even your ancestors will be able to rest in peace in their graves,” declared Chu Kuang.

Outside of the battlefield, Luo Bing and Luo Ning’s expressions changed. “How sinister. He wants to kill all of them.”

Chu Kuang intentionally insulted them, provoking them into staying here without admitting defeat. As long as no one admitted defeat, he could freely kill them all without punishment.

“Despicable!”

“Shameless!”

“Trash!”

“Bastard!”

“Son of a bitch!”

The disciples outside unleashed a torrent of curses. This Chu Kuang made them so angry that they almost broke their teeth by clenching them so hard.

“Kill them all. Don’t worry, there’s no punishment for killing people today.”

Chu Kuang waved his hand. After that, the disciples behind him charged forward with sinister smiles.

One of them even shouted, “Kill! Each person’s head is worth a million immortal crystals! It’s just up to who is faster!”

An uproar exploded amongst the disciples watching. Chu Kuang was absolutely despicable to actually make such a reward system. This way, the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples would kill everyone to gain as much money as possible.

“The Chu family’s people are all despicable. They’ll even do something so evil!” raged Luo Ning.

However, her rage was useless. They were outside the competition and couldn’t help.

Inside, Chu Kuang himself didn’t join in. Even Tang Yaochen, Li Chengbei, Xiang Kejie, Yang Fang, and the others simply stood there.

The disciples on the battlefield began to kill each other. However, the shocking thing was that despite clearly being weaker, the Unfettered Alliance’s side had greater killing power.

In the first clash, over twenty of the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples were killed. Mu Qingyun’s people were launching vicious blows with no regard for their own safety.

This was a true slaughter where blood flew everywhere. It was such a desperate and bitter sight that the disciples outside could barely watch.

Although in the past competitions, casualties were not rare, there had never been such bloody battles between people before.

Normally, once one side had an absolute advantage, the other side would simply admit defeat and be transported out. They wouldn’t fight like this.

Even if both sides did have some enmity between them, after a few people died, they would get afraid, and the weaker party would admit defeat.

Hence, this was no longer a competition but a bloody battle. The Unfettered Alliance was at an absolute disadvantage, but no one admitted defeat.

One of them was cut in two but still managed to pierce his sword through his attacker’s skull.

At the same time, his upper body grabbed onto another enemy’s leg, and he bit down with all his remaining power. Despite that enemy trying to shake him off, he didn’t let go. Due to the distraction, another disciple managed to kill that enemy.

Even though the enemy was already dead, the disciple in half continued to hang on tightly to the enemy’s leg.

Seeing these, even the instructors were moved. The Unfettered Alliance’s disciples were truly strong. Although their cultivation bases were weak, they were true warriors.

Casualties appeared on both sides, but the majority actually belonged to the Prime Glory Alliance. Upon seeing their numbers shrink, Chu Kuang’s expression finally changed.

“A bunch of ants also dare to be arrogant! Die!” At this moment, the injured Gu Fei charged in, and the scales instantly tipped. Several disciples of the Unfettered Alliance were instantly killed.

Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu who were doing their best to kill as many enemies as possible attacked him, only to be sent flying. They weren’t a match for him.

Just as Gu Fei was about to take advantage and kill the two of them, a sharp streak of sword-light slashed down, making him retreat hastily.

He looked over to see Mu Qingyun being propped up by a female disciple. That attack had come from her.

“Slut, I’ll kill you today!” Gu Fei furiously stepped toward her, but his path was suddenly blocked by someone.

That person wore a green hat, and green light flowed within his eyes.

It was Devil Eye Yang Fang. A strange rune suddenly appeared in his eyes. After that, Mu Qingyun felt a wave of dizziness, feeling like her soul was being stripped away.
