Chapter 4484 Lifehunter Race, Heavenly Province’s Ying Tian

As Mu Qingyun ate the second Heavenly Doyen Fruit, Grand Dao runes started to flow around her. Even in this secluded room, she could feel the power of the Heavenly Daos trying to pour through her, and she couldn’t stop it even if she wanted to.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen…”

Mu Qingyun was stunned. She had just become a Heavenly Doyen, and now, she felt her Doyen power shoot up as if she had broken free of the restrictions of the room, and her senses stretched limitlessly. This experience felt almost like a dream.

“Good, very good!” Seeing that Mu Qingyun’s Doyen power could skyrocket again after becoming a Doyen, Long Chen was excited.

Mu Qingyun was now a two-star Heavenly Doyen. In other words, a stronger Heavenly Doyen Fruit could overwrite the effect of the weaker fruit.

Most importantly, when Mu Qingyun became a Heavenly Doyen, Long Chen detected none of the dislikable aura typical of other Doyens. It seemed that consuming the Heavenly Doyen Fruit would make one different from other Doyens.

“If the heavens are blind, then I’ll take everything from it myself,” Long Chen muttered through gritted teeth. The heavens were no longer the same, and if the Heavenly Daos were going to be unfair, he would claim what he desired by his own means.

The Heavenly Dao Tree was absolutely heaven-defying. With it in Long Chen’s possession, the Dragonblood Legion would become a Heavenly Doyen Dragonblood Legion.

“Qingyun, I’m going to ask you to stay here for a few days. Can you go into seclusion for a while?” asked Long Chen.

Mu Qingyun understood. The fruits that Long Chen had given her were too heaven-defying. If this matter was exposed, it would be dangerous, so she needed to go into seclusion. Once more Heavenly Doyens appeared in the academy, she wouldn’t draw too much attention when she emerged.

In the meantime, she also needed to get accustomed to her new Doyen power, so she obediently nodded. “If you wish for it, I’ll stay in seclusion the entire time, whether it’s ten years or a hundred years.”

Long Chen laughed. “There’s no need for that. Just stay in seclusion for two months, and keep your aura reserved when you do go out.”

After arranging things with Mu Qingyun, Long Chen called over several squad leader warriors of the Dragonblood Legion and distributed the remaining Heavenly Doyen Fruits to them. There was no rush to give the fruits to Guo Ran and the others

Given their current formidable strength and ongoing rapid growth, bestowing the Heavenly Doyen Fruits on them wouldn’t offer significant benefits. It would be better to strengthen the Dragonblood warriors.

After that, Long Chen just needed to wait for them to undergo the transformation. During that period, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole returned.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Both of them looked rather grave. Bai Xiaole said, “Boss, based on the academy’s reports, quite a few terrifying existences have appeared throughout the various worlds connected to the Darklight Heaven.”

“Oh? How terrifying?” asked Long Chen.

“Boss, have you heard of the Lifehunter race?” asked Bai Xiaole.

“The Lifehunter race? The peerless assassins from ancient times who were said to be able to take people’s lives through space? Didn’t they go extinct long ago?” Long Chen’s expression changed.

The Lifehunter race was considered the progenitor of all assassins, with a history that could be traced all the way back to the primal chaos era. Proficient in witchcraft, formation arts, concealing arts, sneak attacks, fate reading, and bloodline curses, they were the world’s most ancient and formidable assassins.

This race might have been terrifying, but their presence in history was short-lived. They had a flash of prosperity in the immemorial era but quickly vanished in the flow of time.

Cultivators of this era, both in the junior generation and the senior generation, were familiar with the tales of this terrifying but elusive race.

Long Chen had read through an introduction on them, but he felt like the details on them were too unbelievable to fully trust.

According to the record, the Lifehunter Assassins could use the blood, flesh, bones, and even the hair of their target to carry out a sacrificial verdict. The concept of this sacrificial verdict seemed even more fantastical. It was claimed that within heaven and earth existed the Lifehunter God, who would judge the value of the life of all living beings.

Apparently, this technique involved a gamble to determine whose life was more valuable. Once the sacrificial verdict was carried out, the one with a more valuable life would live, while the other one would perish. If both lives were equally important, both would die.

When Long Chen read that, he almost laughed. Just who had come up with that nonsense? It was hilarious, and no one would believe such a thing.

Long Chen had dismissed this story as a mere myth back then. The only reason he remembered the Lifehunter race was because it was said that their demise was related to a deadly conflict with the violet blood race. Although the exact nature of the confrontation remained shrouded in mystery, the association with the violet blood race made a lasting impression on Long Chen.

Now, hearing about them again, he was shocked. So, this world really did have a Lifehunter race.

“Boss, you’re truly amazing! How did you know about this?” Bai Xiaole praised him before continuing, “The dean said that the Lifehunter race has resurfaced and reestablished their organization in the Heavenly Province, which was once their faith shrine. If their faith was ever cut off, the name of the Heavenly Province should have also been impossible to use. Yet, the Lifehunter race has successfully revived it, indicating that their legacy was never entirely extinguished. They were merely biding their time and recovering all along.”

Long Chen gasped at that. “If the Heavenly Province has been secretly growing ever since ancient times, the amassed power they’ve garnered over the years must be truly formidable.”

“That’s right. The dean also said that the fact they could endure for countless years and now suddenly come back in such force is probably related to the violet blood race,” said Bai Xiaole.

“Is it a declaration of war against the violet blood race?” Long Chen sneered.

The violet blood race was renowned as one of the most potent bloodlines within the human race, maintaining its prominent status since the primal chaos era. While the true violet blood bloodline rarely appeared in this world, their influence remained strong.

On the other hand, the Lifehunter race had only been famous for a single moment in history. In Long Chen’s eyes, they were like foam generated by the waves in an ocean. Just how many people would care about them?

However, despite his disdain, he couldn’t afford to underestimate a race that dared to challenge the violet blood race.

After years of patient waiting, their sudden resurgence under the banner of the Heavenly Province meant that they had come prepared.

“The rumors say that the Heavenly Province has a peerless heavenly genius called Ying Tian. He is hailed as the invincible killing god. My grandfather has warned you to be careful of him, saying that he surpasses Netherdragon Tianzhao by countless times and will be one of your strongest opponents,” conveyed Bai Xiaole.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Countless times stronger than Netherdragon Tianzhao and identified as one of his strongest opponents by the dean? The dean was not one to make judgments lightly. The gravity of this warning emphasized the formidable nature of Ying Tian.

“Is there anyone else?” asked Long Chen.

Bai Xiaole answered, “There’s also—”

However, before he could finish, Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed, and he shot out like a bolt of lightning. Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole were startled and hastily followed him
