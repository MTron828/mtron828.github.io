Chapter 4448 The True Power of a Heavenly Doyen

An enormous vortex appeared, seemingly sucking away all the power of the laws of the world. The next moment, a divine rune materialized on Netherdragon Tianzhao’s forehead, swiftly restoring his wounds. In just the blink of an eye, his wounds were gone.

“What?!” Everyone was shocked.

Those wounds were no ordinary injuries. Some were caused by Long Chen and contained his terrifying will, making it difficult to heal them. The other portion resulted from spatial blades, which also possessed immense destructive power and terrifying laws. Until now, no one had successfully deciphered these laws.

Once a spatial blade cut the body, the injury was notoriously difficult to heal. Even if it was healed, the scars often persisted.

However, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s wounds instantly healed, looking like they had vanished, and that stunned even the budding Doyens.

While every expert had the ability to heal, the attacks of other experts carried their unique wills and laws. Even budding Doyens and Eternal experts would require time to mend such injuries. However, Netherdragon Tianzhao swiftly healed his wounds, nullifying all of Long Chen’s previous efforts.

The vortex above Netherdragon Tianzhao spun, and the divine rune on his forehead grew increasingly radiant. Because of this single rune, he instantly appeared like a sacred existence that couldn’t be blasphemed.

“Do you see? This is the Doyen divine rune, a privilege only bestowed upon a true Doyen. When I wield it, all the power of this world submits to my command. Now, the fate of all beings can be shaped by a mere thought from me!” declared Netherdragon Tianzhao.

As he spoke, lightning raged in the vortex above him, and various Heavenly Dao runes appeared. He seemed like a heavenly emperor in this state. This sudden change caught countless people off guard, and those budding Doyens now came to a sudden understanding.

“So until now, Netherdragon Tianzhao hasn’t used his Doyen power!”

“Then he hasn’t been using his full power?”

“Long Chen is doomed. Even after going all-out, he could barely force Netherdragon Tianzhao to use his full power. The battle’s over.”

People let out a sigh as they looked at the bloody Long Chen. Even after undergoing such a terrifying battle, Long Chen hadn’t seen Netherdragon Tianzhao’s full power. An awakened Heavenly Doyen was truly terrifying.

Now that the Doyen manifestation had appeared, just what was Long Chen supposed to use to fight Netherdragon Tianzhao? In the end, the Sage King was still inferior to a Heavenly Doyen.

However, some people still put their hopes on Long Chen, thinking that even if Long Chen couldn’t beat Netherdragon Tianzhao, he wouldn’t simply admit defeat. There would definitely be a great struggle.

In that case, this battle would still be worth watching, and they would be able to see just how strong a legendary Heavenly Doyen was.

“What? Do you give up now? Do you despair? I already told you that in front of absolute power, your scheming would be futile.” Netherdragon Tianzhao looked at Long Chen coldly.

He was in no rush to attack. Like a cheetah eyeing its prey, he wanted to enjoy humiliating Long Chen.

Long Chen smiled and then lowered his head, examining his wounds. He spoke lightly, “And I already mentioned that you don't possess absolute power. To speak as if you've already won, I can't help but feel embarrassed for you.”

“Embarrassed?”

“That’s right. Or perhaps I should say humiliated? During the battle of domains, you bragged until the heavens exploded, only to be powerless to do anything to me after using up all your power. In our second clash—the competition of dragon race’s powers and divine abilities, we were evenly matched. Considering you’re from the dragon race and I’m from the human race, achieving a draw is already quite humiliating for you. If I were in your shoes, I’d have found a place to bury myself long ago. Honestly, I admire you. What gives you the audacity to utter such grandiose words in front of everyone after so many failures?” Long Chen questioned, his tone filled with disdain.

“You…!” Initially, Netherdragon Tianzhao stood like a heavenly emperor, but just like that, he was brought back down.

These spectators now recovered from the shock that Netherdragon Tianzhao had given them. It seemed that Long Chen was right.

During the dragon blood domain competition, Long Chen only defended, and Netherdragon Tianzhao was unable to beat him. Then, when competing in the dragon race’s powers and divine abilities, which was Netherdragon Tianzhao’s specialty, he was still unable to beat Long Chen.

As a member of the dragon race, Netherdragon Tianzhao should have the upper hand in a competition of the dragon race’s domains, power, and divine abilities. Hence, to only draw against a human could be considered his defeat. It seemed that he really didn’t have a reason to be so arrogant.

These words stunned the experts present. That was right. Similar to Netherdragon Tianzhao, Long Chen had only used the dragon race’s divine abilities, not the power that he specialized in.

“Was Long Chen also holding back?” asked the Jiang clan’s budding Doyen.

“How laughable,” scoffed Feng Fei.

“And what does that mean?!” raged that budding Doyen.

After mocking him, Feng Fei ignored him and continued to watch the fight.

At this point, startled cries rang out as Long Chen’s wounds quickly healed as well.

Long Chen’s recovery speed was not at all inferior to Netherdragon Tianzhao’s. Most surprisingly, he hadn’t summoned his manifestation, harnessed the power of heaven and earth, or tapped into any bloodline abilities. His wounds healed effortlessly, akin to a natural process.

“I really didn’t feed you for nothing!”

Seeing his wounds instantly heal, Long Chen was satisfied. He couldn’t help but think of the countless Eternal corpses he had tossed into the primal chaos space.

The Moon Trees and Fusang Trees had grown crazily, transforming both quantitatively and qualitatively. As a result of this, Long Chen’s wounds could instantly heal. They had won him some face this time.

Were Heavenly Doyens really so amazing just because they used Heavenly Dao energy to heal? Long Chen proved that he could achieve the same result, relying on his own abilities. Observing Netherdragon Tianzhao’s astonished gaze, Long Chen couldn’t help but feel super satisfied.

Long Chen then took off his torn-apart black robes and put on a new set of robes. After that, Long Chen appeared completely refreshed, a sign that he was still in his peak condition.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was as if he hadn’t just experienced an immense battle, and he was blazing with fighting spirit instead.

“Come. Let me see if a Heavenly Doyen really is as powerful as the legends say.”

After saying that, the auspicious clouds in his divine ring vanished, replaced by a sea of stars. When this starry sea appeared, the nine heavens quivered, and the stars above the heavens shone.
