Chapter 3455 Bai Shishi’s Luck

The current Bai Shishi seemed to be an entirely different person. Her gaze was so sharp it seemed that it could pierce a person’s soul.

Moreover, there were countless runes revolving and evolving within her eyes. It was like the workings of a field of stars. There seemed to be endless power hidden within her body, and even Long Chen felt immense pressure when he looked at her.

“You really merged with that person’s inheritance?” asked Long Chen in shock.

Bai Shishi shook her head. “Only some of the superficial information so far. His Dao is too profound, and I cannot comprehend them in this realm. Thus, Ninety-nine percent of the divine runes are sealed in my soul, and I am working to comprehend them.”

“Amazing. Just comprehending some superficial information is enough to completely transform you. Once you comprehend it all, won’t you be unrivaled?” Long Chen was delighted.

Bai Shishi smiled. “Long Chen, it really is all thanks to you. I would have never encountered such an opportunity if it hadn’t been for you. I suspect that this senior was a terrifying Divine Venerate back when he was alive. Obtaining his inheritance is enough to change my entire life.”

Long Chen was stunned by that. Bai Shishi had obtained that person’s inheritance, so she should have a certain understanding of him. She wouldn’t blindly guess such a thing. If she said that he was a Divine Venerate, then he probably had reached that realm.

That Divine Venerate had actually died to the Ghost Sovereign. The Ghost Sovereign had then placed his corpse on the Ghost Ship. Clearly, the Ghost Sovereign was planning on using him again. It really was just as he said… the Ghost Sovereign wouldn’t let him off even in death.

Not only that, but this Divine Venerate didn’t seem to hold much resentment at being killed by the Ghost Sovereign. That would imply that he was fully convinced of his defeat.

Even a powerful Divine Venerate like him was slain by the Ghost Sovereign. From this, it could be seen just how terrifying of an existence the latter was. However, even then, he was almost wiped out of existence by the Nine Star Master. So just how powerful was the Nine Star Master?

If the Nine Star Master was so powerful, why had he died? In the end, he transformed into countless seeds of vengeance. Just who was the target of that vengeance?

Seeing Long Chen’s bewildered expression, Bai Shishi looked around. Since there was no one else around, she blushed and grabbed his hands. She softly said, “Don’t worry, even if my power surpasses yours, I’ll do my best to listen to you.”

Bai Shishi’s voice was very quiet. A very rare expression appeared on her face, one that truly shook his heart. He was enraptured by her beauty.

Seeing Long Chen foolishly staring at her, Bai Shishi blushed even more. But she still held his hands.

It was only after a long moment that Long Chen recovered. Bai Shishi was a peerless beauty, but she was even more moving like this. If before this she was a fairy untouched by the mortal world, now she was like a fairy that had fallen into the mortal world. A bit of that immortal aura was replaced with mortal air. It was that trace of mortal air that made Long Chen feel like she was more real. He could also clearly sense her inner heart.

“Do your best? You mean that you might not listen? At that time, I won’t be able to beat you, so won’t I be suppressed by you every single day? Will you be like your mother that day, and put your father in his place, but instead it’s me?” asked Long Chen with a smile.

Bai Shishi hastily explained, “I definitely won’t beat you. I said I’d do my best because if you make the wrong decision, I naturally have the right to disagree.”

As expected, it was still that same character. It seemed that she was always leaving herself a way out. Long Chen bitterly smiled inside. Putting it frankly, it didn’t matter how grateful she was to him, she definitely wouldn’t blindly follow him.

“Cough, cough…”

Just then, Qin Feng and Qi Yu came over and saw the two of them holding hands. Theoretically, they should leave at this moment.

However, if they just left like this, it would be too obvious, so they lowered their heads and coughed as if they hadn’t seen anything.

Bai Shishi hastily pulled her hands away, her face burning. She then turned around.

“Oh, boss, alliance head Shishi, what a coincidence? You’re here.” Qin Feng raised his head and acted like he had just seen them. Although everyone knew it was an act, at least it wouldn’t further embarrass Bai Shishi.

Sometimes, a loincloth was very interesting. It was a bit comical, but there was a big difference between wearing it and not wearing it. No matter how strong a person was, they needed it.

“Not bad, the lightning has tempered your bodies. Your physical bodies are more than ten times stronger than before.” Long Chen sensed the surging Blood Qi within their bodies and nodded. This time, the results were even a bit better than he had expected.

Perhaps it was due to the final compression of the heavenly tribulation, forming that elder. The lightning contained that elder’s soul energy. It was then absorbed by Lei Linger and injected into their bodies, causing even their souls to strengthen.

Their Four Peaks were the flesh, bone, qi, and blood. To put it frankly, they simply raised the power of their physical bodies as high as possible because of their fighting styles. A powerful physical body was their foundation.

However, this time, due to the elder, it wasn’t just their physical bodies that were strengthened to the maximum. Their Spiritual Strength had also increased. A powerful Spiritual Strength increased the sharpness of their senses and gave them more precise control over their techniques. 

They had all benefited from Bai Shishi, and not just a little bit. It could be said that the two of them had greatly profited.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The two of you aren’t getting any younger. Have you not found any ladies that attract your eyes? My Heaven Female Alliance has countless beauties. Are you acting aloof, or do you feel that they aren’t a match for you?” asked Bai Shishi, recovering her normal indifference.

Long Chen was speechless. It seemed that Bai Shishi didn’t want to be embarrassed by herself and wanted the two of them to find companions as well. If it was just Qin Feng, then fine. But Qi Yu already had someone!

Qin Feng smiled. “We are just ordinary Dragonblood warriors. There are the squad leaders above us and then the captains above them. Even the captains haven’t found any partners. How can we be qualified? When the captains drank together, they told us that unless they had power like boss’s, they wouldn’t be qualified to find partners. Without enough power, they can’t even protect themselves, let alone their loved ones. Even someone as powerful as boss could only watch as-”

“Qin Feng!”

Qi Yu suddenly glared at Qin Feng, causing him to apologetically look at Long Chen. “Sorry, boss.”

He was about to say that even someone as powerful as Long Chen had not been able to protect the Pill Fairy back then. How could they be qualified to find a companion for themselves? He had inadvertently touched upon Long Chen’s scar.

Long Chen smiled slightly and indicated that it was fine. Bai Shishi knew of his relationship with the Pill Fairy. It seemed that they were using him as a model and didn’t want to experience the same pain.

“It’s fine. Tell your Heaven Female Alliance’s beauties to just wait. Once our boss rules the world, our Dragonblood Legion will warmly welcome all your people,” laughed Qin Feng.

“A nice thought!”

Bai Shishi knew that Qin Feng was just joking around, so just as he wished, she closed this topic of discussion.

“Boss, we came to find you because we want to exercise our bones,” said Qin Feng seriously.

“Go. Just pay attention to the Devil Eye Water Lily race and you’ll be fine,” said Long Chen. He knew their power and their characters, and they wouldn’t mess around. They simply wanted to use battles to solidify their realms and get used to their new power.

With Long Chen’s assent, the two of them happily ran off. Once they were gone, Long Chen said, “Let’s go take a look at Xiaole and the others.”
