Chapter 2557 Huo Linger Comes Out to Fight

Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Wuchen could feel the world freeze as if a star was crashing toward him. Even before the attack reached him, the pressure made him feel like his body would explode.

Jiang Wuchen was shocked. Due to leaving Long Chen to Ye Liangchen, he hadn’t fully activated his manifestation. Also, he hadn’t expected Ye Liangchen to allow Long Chen to escape his lock. That was why he was now at a disadvantage.

Sensing the lethal power of Long Chen’s saber, Jiang Wuchen let out a roar, and a rune lit up on his forehead. At the same time, the giant ape king in his manifestation also roared, an identical rune appearing on its forehead.

BOOM!

However, before he could accumulate his energy, Long Chen’s saber had arrived. Both of them crashed through the earth.

The earth trembled and shook, completely deforming. A giant bubble of earth rose out of the ground.

Bang!

That giant bubble finally exploded, sending a mass of rubble in every direction. At this moment, Jiang Wuchen’s figure appeared, flying back.

“Jiang Wuchen is injured!” Everyone saw that a foot-long wound had appeared on Jiang Wuchen’s chest. His white robes were now stained with blood.

It was unknown if it was because all Sovereign sprouts wore white robes, but the look of those robes always made them appear rather spiritual and graceful. However, Jiang Wuchen’s giant body was unable to give off the same effect. He looked more like a monkey wearing white robes, and it gave off an extremely jarring feeling.

Through the cut in his white robes, people saw black under armor beneath. However, even this armor had been cut apart.

“I really dislike it when people threaten me. A dragon has a reverse scale. If it is touched, it will draw its fury. Since you lack any sense of respect, let’s fight with our lives on the line. We’ll see whose life is tougher.”

Long Chen’s figure appeared and a wicked aura accumulated around him. Everyone could see his black robes flapping in a wild wind and the icy killing intent in his eyes. His back was bent slightly like a leopard staring at his prey, about to unleash a fatal blow.

Just at this moment, star swords came shooting toward Long Chen once more. However, Ye Liangchen couldn’t unleash all the stars within his manifestation at once. It seemed that every star needed to attack once in order to fully activate his manifestation.

At this moment, a young lady suddenly appeared behind Long Chen. She was wrapped in flames, and flame runes revolved in her eyes. She was forming hand seals.

“Raging Flames Devour the Heavens!”

Huo Linger’s voice was melodious like an oriole. But her attack was not so warm.

Thanks to the help of the mother tree and Ling Xi, Huo Linger had fully merged with the Daos of the thousands of flames within the Star Field Divine World. She now possessed a level of control over all kinds of flames.

A normal flame cultivator first learned how to control techniques and hand seals before trying to control flames. But Huo Linger was a spirit of fire, so she didn’t need to learn all that. Over the years, Long Chen had given her various treasures, raising her spirituality.

Because of this, she knew all kinds of techniques. Furthermore, through hand seals, she could use her flame energy to draw out the world’s flame energy, merging the two. That raised her power to the peak and saved her a great deal of energy.

During her final days in the Star Field Divine World, Huo Linger had spent all her time training hand seals. Moreover, those hand seals were not taught to her by Long Chen. They were things that she comprehended herself.

Others went from outside-in, but Huo Linger was the opposite. Rather than the normal path of flame cultivators, she used her flames to make hand seals, not the other way around.

At this moment, flames burst forth and giant flame dragons crashed into the star swords. The flame dragons and star swords exploded when they met.

“Who is she? I’ve never seen her before.” People were startled to see a new character who was capable of blocking Ye Liangchen’s swords.

Even if those swords were just a process of Ye Liangchen fully activating his manifestation, every single one of them possessed the power to kill an Empyrean at the peak of the Netherpassage realm.

With tens of thousands of them flying through the air at once, even a peak heavenly genius would find it difficult to block them. How was this girl that they had never seen before capable of receiving them so easily?

“Huo Linger, help me block him. Don’t let him interfere,” said Long Chen.

“Alright, leave him to me.” Huo Linger smiled. A flame sword appeared in her hand.

This was a three-foot flame sword that was thin and narrow. It looked very delicate. However, as soon as it appeared, the entire battlefield’s space twisted.

As Huo Linger swung her sword, a flame dragon shot out, blasting apart a wave of the star swords.

“What?!”

Startled cries rang out. This girl was actually able to unleash such an attack.

A sea of flames spread through the battlefield, enveloping Ye Liangchen. At that moment, Huo Linger vanished and reappeared in front of Ye Liangchen, unleashing another slash of her sword.

“That’s… that’s Long Chen’s technique!”

Huo Linger was teleporting as well. Anywhere there were flames, she could freely teleport.

“Scram!” Ye Liangchen slashed with his starry sword.

BOOM!

Ye Liangchen hastily retreated, and people were shocked to find flames burning him. It seemed that his expression wasn’t very good.

Ye Liangchen found that these flames were not so simple. They were causing his Blood Qi to surge chaotically, making him feel uneasy. Furthermore, they were capable of even igniting his astral energy.

“What kind of flames are these?!” roared Ye Liangchen.

His astral energy had never been affected by any kind of flame before. These unknown flames were shocking.

“Big brother Long Chen told me not to talk to strangers, so I can’t tell you, especially since you’re a bad egg who’s going against him.” Huo Linger shook her head and attacked once more.

The sword in her hand was condensed of the purest power of the karmic hell flames. Although the true karmic hell flames had been absorbed and these karmic hell flames were an imitation that lacked their full power, they had at least retained a bit of the karmic hell flames’ special abilities.

The karmic hell flames were something that even gods were afraid of. If these were the Netherworld’s true karmic hell flames, Ye Liangchen would already be incinerated.

Despite being an imitation, these karmic hell flames were not so simple either. Ye Liangchen’s astral energy was being burned, and his manifestation was greatly disturbed. Like this, Ye Liangchen was unable to unleash the full power of his manifestation.

“You want to stop me? Long Chen, you really are despicable. Then today, I’ll kill this little girl of yours!” Ye Liangchen sneered. He stopped trying to activate his manifestation and instead attacked directly with his sword.

The stars within his sword blazed with light, like it was a river of stars. As it slashed down, spacetime was suddenly thrown into chaos.

“What a terrifying sword!”

“Look at the stars in his manifestation. It seems that a tenth of them have been activated. If he activates them all, just how powerful will he be?”

The crowd turned ashen. Now they knew why some geniuses were called Sovereign sprouts. They were existences that they couldn’t touch. Compared to them, the various geniuses of the Martial Heaven Continent were merely ordinary. The difference was too great.

If the Sovereign sprouts were already on this level, then just how powerful were actual Sovereigns? No wonder it was said that they were undefeatable existences. Their power could not be imagined.

At this moment, this sword was slicing through the void, destroying even the surrounding flames.

Looking at what was happening, Huo Linger formed hand seals with her left hand as she held her sword in her right hand. After that, images appeared over her fingertips, and flame runes condensed into giant walls before her. In an instant, over a hundred flame walls appeared.

“One-handed seals?”

Startled cries rang out. Huo Linger had just made over a hundred hand seals in the blink of an eye. Was she really human?

Every hand seal required the body, heart, and will to work together. There couldn’t be the slightest error. To create seven hand seals in one breath could rank someone amongst geniuses. The strongest record was someone creating seventeen hand seals in an instant. That record had never been touched.

However, Huo Linger had made over a hundred hand seals in an instant, and this completely toppled their understanding of hand seals. They felt like they were going crazy.

Having to endure Ye Liangchen’s attack, the flame walls were exploding one by one. When the final wall was broken, Huo Linger swung her sword. With a final explosion, Ye Liangchen’s attack was shattered.

The flame walls had constantly ground down his sword’s power. By the time it broke the final wall, it was essentially out of power, so Huo Linger easily destroyed it. Everyone sighed in amazement. They had sensed just how terrifying Ye Liangchen’s attack was. This meant that Huo Linger’s flame walls were also incredibly powerful.

Suddenly, flame runes shuddered and condensed into countless dragons that surrounded Ye Liangchen.

After that, Ye Liangchen’s sword danced in the air, unleashing streaks of Sword Qi that destroyed the flame dragons. Looking at this, Huo Linger extended her left hand once more. Her fingers danced as she quickly created hand seals. It was impossible to even see her fingers clearly.

As she rapidly formed hand seals, more flame dragons appeared within the sea of flames. Following that, the people heard the roars of various beasts. Then flame swords, flame sabers, flame spears, flame chains… The flame runes condensed into countless weapons and beasts, all attacking Ye Liangchen.

Ye Liangchen’s sword was fast, but Huo Linger’s speed with which she formed hand seals was even faster. Her attacks came in an unending stream. Furthermore, her flame energy continued to spread, and the world’s flame energy was rapidly being summoned here.

A giant flame domain was constantly growing around Huo Linger and Ye Liangchen. At this moment, various flame manifestations were constantly attacking Ye Liangchen. Weapons, beasts, prisons, mountains, countless shapes and forms attacked.

“Is she really human?” People stared at Huo Linger in shock.
