Chapter 2842 The Challenges Begin

After Long Chen left, Luo Ning’s final words echoed in his mind. It was a warning. It seemed that her enmity with Chu Kuang was far greater than whatever conflict existed between the God Institute and the Immortal Institute.

However, it had nothing to do with him. If others didn’t provoke him, he would just quietly cultivate. If others did provoke him, then it didn’t matter who it was. He would make them pay the blood price.

Long Chen led the Elite Group back to hunting beasts. When he was idle, he absorbed the thunderforce from the Lightning Lizard Beast’s crystal core and Neidan.

With Long Chen’s pointers, these disciples finally started to shape up. At the very least, they were able to forget the feeling of death when they were fighting. They had finally gained some bravery and confidence through this tempering.

When that newfound confidence appeared, Long Chen became more cautious. If they were to receive a mental blow at this time, it would be a serious setback.

When they encountered powerful beasts, Long Chen would personally suppress the beasts and direct the disciples, correcting any mistakes that he saw. He didn’t forget to occasionally give them some praise as well. The carrot and the stick combined were the best method of all time.

The Elite Group was making rapid advancements and spent every day in pain and joy. Their innate talent was good, and through this hellish training, even they themselves were shocked by their gains.

As more and more of their talent and potential were being brought out every day, even they could feel it.

Although Long Chen’s training was difficult to endure, they all knew that this was their only chance to change their fates. If this opportunity was missed, it wouldn’t come again. Moreover, it wasn’t just their physical bodies that were transforming, but their souls as well. Their thirst for power also grew as they got stronger.

In the blink of an eye, ten days passed, and it was enough to completely transform these disciples. Their auras were now heavy and solid. Their gazes were sharp.

They had spent these ten days killing, so the Blood Qi of their opponents had yet to fade from their bodies. That aura had even started to infect their souls, making them have a trace of the aura that an expert should possess.

However, they weren’t the only ones to benefit from these ten days. Long Chen was delighted because he had fully absorbed the power of the Lightning Lizard Beast, and Lei Linger had also awoken.

She also transformed into a small dragon and coiled around Long Chen’s arm, reverting back to her Lei Long form. Lei Linger didn’t usually like showing emotion unlike Huo Linger’s fieriness, but after awakening this time, Lei Long wrapped firmly around Long Chen’s arm. Long Chen used his Spiritual Strength to comfort it, but it still refused to let go.

Unlike Huo Linger that freely expressed emotion, Lei Linger seemed to hide those emotions deep within. Now, it seemed afraid to let go of Long Chen, as if that battle had had a large impact on Lei Linger.

With both of them awakened, Long Chen was revitalized and no longer felt alone. Even his mood improved.

“Third boss, is today the day that you transmit us some ultimate techniques?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Long Chen’s smile made the disciples feel more relaxed. Ever since they had known Long Chen, they had never seen this smile. His face was usually frighteningly dark, and now it was like a clear day after long storms.

Ever since Long Chen had told Luo Ning she could call him Long San, these fellows had changed their appellation for him, no longer calling him instructor Long Chen.

“Ultimate moves? Nonsense. I haven’t even gone to the Divine Technique Pavilion. Where am I supposed to find ultimate moves for you?” Long Chen scolded with a smile. “Techniques are defined by such things. The important thing is whether or not they can be used in the real world. Moreover, none of you have condensed your flame seed. Without igniting divine energy, how are you supposed to unleash your so-called ultimate moves? Those techniques can only be unleashed by the strong. Even if you could control a destructive ultimate technique, would it matter if you were cut down by your enemy’s sword before you could unleash it? Those techniques require accumulating a great deal of power before casting, and their cast times are long. In a clash between experts, life and death are decided by the smallest things. Who would give you time to unleash such a move? You still don’t understand after killing all those beasts? When you killed those beasts, did they not have their own ultimate techniques? But did you give them a chance to unleash them?”

Long Chen’s mood was good today, so he didn’t scold them as coldly as he did before. Hence, their feeling of fear toward him lessened quite a bit.

“Starting today, you will start killing beasts in one against ones,” said Long Chen.

“What?!”

All of them jumped. In a one against one, the slightest mistake would result in death.

“You are already capable of killing them on your own, but you don’t know just how strong you have become. What you need to do is recognize your own power so you can make the correct judgments when fighting your enemies. You must grasp opportunity within danger. Li Cai, you go first,” said Long Chen.

“Yes!” Li Cai didn’t reveal any fear. Instead, he was itching to try as he was the one who had improved the fastest during this time. Even his body had completely changed. His arms and legs were far thicker, no longer fitting into his old robes. Thus, he was currently wearing a set of beast hides.

BOOM!

At this moment, a wild bull had its throat slit by Li Cai’s sword. Its blood spurted into the air before falling back down.

“Not bad. You were able to remain calm from start to end. You weren’t affected by the threat of death. Although you missed a few chances to kill it, wasting quite a bit of energy, overall, it was very much not bad.” Long Chen made a judgment.

Li Cai got them off to a good start, startling the other disciples. Long Chen had picked out some comparatively weaker beasts for them to fight as training. He wanted them to continue to pile up successes and increase their confidence.

It was after another ten days of killing beasts that the true hellish training began. They started to fight Long Chen one against one.

Li Cai was the first. As a result, Long Chen’s sword pierced his chest in an instant. If Long Chen hadn’t had mercy, Li Cai would have died.

At that instant, all the disciples turned green. They had thought that they were already extremely powerful. However, the result of their fights was that not one person lasted more than three exchanges against Long Chen.

When they lost, scars were left on their bodies. Some of the scars were in fatal places, but Long Chen pulled back his power at the last second. Despite that, his terrifying killing intent made them breathe in the scent of death.

The final ten days were the greatest torment. Even after ten days, not one person was able to last more than three exchanges against Long Chen, leaving them all feeling dejected.

Furthermore, time was up. They then followed Long Chen back to the God Institute in low spirits.

Right now, the plaza in front of the grand palace was packed with people. The martial stage was already set up. Other than the first place on the Human-grade divine rankings, Chu Kuang, everyone else had arrived.

“No way! Looking at their current expressions, it seems that there’s no hope!” Zhong Ling and the others’ expressions fell when they saw the faces of the Elite Group.

“Long Chen, are you prepared? Today is-” Ming Ze smiled at Long Chen. The dejected looks of the Elite Group seemed to tell him that the result that he wanted was about to come.

“Shut your butt. Keep farting and I’ll kill you,” snorted Long Chen with a cold glance.

He then turned to Li Cai behind him. “Go. You are the first. Remember to beat him like a dog.”

“Yes.”

Li Cai directly jumped onto the martial stage and shouted, “Third place on the divine rankings, that Changsheng or whatever, come out! Boss San told me to beat you like a dog!”

Li Cai’s voice caused an uproar to erupt throughout the plaza.
