Chapter 3570

This giant city had its grand formation protecting it. But outside of that barrier was an endless sea of devil beasts.

The devil beasts weren’t attacking and simply patrolled the city. But seeing the battleships coming, they immediately launched an assault on the battleships.

Even the weakest of those devil beasts was an early stage Immortal King, while the majority were late stage Immortal Kings. Amongst them was a group of early stage World Kings leading them in battle.

When the battleships appeared outside the city, the city’s formation burst open, and more battleships came flying out from inside as well. It seemed that they were planning on collapsing on the devil beasts from both sides.

Two groups of battleships wove through the sea of devil beasts. Sharp arrows came flying out of them, accurately piercing the heads of the devil beasts and making them explode. They forcibly slaughtered a bloody path through the devil beasts.

These battleships were truly killing machines. Wherever they went, flesh and blood flew. Any beast in their way died.

BOOM!

Just as the two lines of battleships were about to converge, the earth exploded and giant figures came flying out from underground. It was actually another group of battleships.

However, the original battleships were golden, while these new ones were black. As soon as they appeared, the two lines of battleships panicked. The battleships from inside the city seemed to want to go back, while the ones that had flown over wanted to leave.

In that moment of hesitation, more rumbling rang out from up in the sky. One giant figure after another descended like mountains. Now, there were thousands of mid stage World King devil beasts, as well as over ten late stage World King devil beasts. The two lines of warships were surrounded.

“What is going on?”

Long Chen was startled. Those black warships didn’t seem friendly. Long Chen then stealthily crept closer to the core of the battlefield.

“Hahaha, you’ve fallen for our trap! Hurry up and surrender. I swear on my Luo[1] family’s reputation not to harm a single hair on any of you.” An elder’s voice rang out from atop one of the black battleships.

Following that shout, the devil beasts that were crazily attacking also came to a stop. They simply surrounded the battleships in layers upon layers.

“The Luo family’s reputation?! Does your Luo family actually have a reputation?! Even your empress was killed because of you. What face do you have to talk about reputation?! You traitors, you won’t have a good death! Our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College only has heroes that will die standing. We have no scum that will kneel to live. So what if we die? Senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran will definitely come to avenge us. Brothers, don’t be afraid. We’ll fight to the death with them, using our blood to show that we do not submit!”

A moving voice came from within one of the golden battleships, and divine light suddenly exploded from out of that battleship. It actually directly crashed toward the opposing battleships in a suicidal attack. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Guo Ran?”

Long Chen’s heart leaped. Was it someone else with the same name?

“Courting death!”

The elder’s furious roar came from the black battleship. It didn’t even have time to dodge and hastily activated its defenses.

BOOM!

As a result, both battleships crashed together, and their fragments exploded in every direction. After that, from within those fragments came countless experts in battle armor and wielding weapons.

Those experts wore either golden armor or black armor, but in any case, they were equipped to the teeth. Their entire bodies were covered, including their faces.

However, based on their auras, they were mostly Divine Lords and Immortal Kings. With the support of their armor though, they unleashed astonishing power. An Immortal King activated all the runes of his armor and unleashed an attack that slayed a mid stage World King devil beast.

At this moment, the ancient city’s formation shuddered and warships lined up from within, seemingly about to come out and assist.

“Don’t come! This is the Luo family’s trap. If you come out, you’ll fall for their trap!” shouted an expert in golden armor.

This person seemed to be one of the leaders. He was the one to talk to that elder and had mentioned Guo Ran’s name.

Although he was only a Divine Lord, in his armor, he possessed absolutely astonishing power that was not at all inferior to the Immortal Kings. He flitted to and fro amongst the crowd, maintaining a uniform battle formation.

Seeing that person’s movements, Long Chen was delighted. He was now sure that the Guo Ran this person had mentioned was the Guo Ran he knew. This battle formation was clearly the Dragonblood Legion’s formation.

This youngster was correct. There were so many late stage World King devil beasts around, but only the mid stage and early stage ones were attacking. It was obviously a trap.

“The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College is full of old fools who refuse to learn anything new! Since you refuse to accept my Luo family’s kindness, you can just die!”

Seeing that the city’s reinforcements actually paused, the black-armored expert was enraged. He directly ordered the true slaughter to start.

BOOM!

The elder hacked his blades at the youngster, causing the latter to grunt. His weapons were actually shattered.

This black-armored elder was an early stage World King, but with his armor, his power was comparable to a mid stage or even late stage World King. As a result, after receiving a full-power attack from him, that youngster was immediately unable to endure.

“Senior apprentice-brother Tu Hu!”

Seeing him injured, the others fighting with him were enraged. The formations instantly grew chaotic as they charged at that black-armored elder.

“Fools! What did I keep telling you?! You can’t let the formations get messy!” That youngster saw the formations in disarray and coughed up blood. The divine light of his armor instantly dimmed.

That last blow had already given him a serious injury. But the sight of the formations shattering disturbed his emotions so intensely that his condition worsened.

“Die. This is the result of not listening to other people’s advice.” The black-armored elder took advantage of this, shooting through their midst like black lightning. His blade then pierced toward the youngster’s chest. It was quick and ruthless, leaving them with no chance of saving him.

“Senior apprentice-brother Tu Hu!” Seeing this, the other disciples were enraged but powerless to stop this.

Suddenly, a huge explosion shook this world and sparks flew. A black-robed man then appeared like a battle god having descended from the heavens. He held a blood-colored saber that was blocking the black-armored elder’s blade.

While the devil beasts were entirely focused on the battle, he took the advantage to slip through their encirclement.

Long Chen’s arrival shocked people. However, while everyone was shocked, only some were happy about it.

“Why not just live a proper life? Why be a dog?”

A hand wrapped in violet qi swung through the air, striking that elder in his face.

[1] This is a different Luo than the Luo family that Long Chen’s mother is from.
