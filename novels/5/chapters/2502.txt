Chapter 2492 Setting Foot On the Ghost Ship

The blood-red lotus in Long Chen’s hand exploded into Ye Ming’s chest. It was like a flower of death blooming.

Ye Ming had received an immense backlash from the Ghost Ship’s anchor breaking his prison, and Long Chen was grasping this perfect chance to attack.

In that instant, Ye Ming felt a sensation of death. His sharp intuition was telling him that Long Chen’s attack had fooled his senses and was truly a terrifying attack that he had underestimated.

Now, he had no time to dodge, and with his hands blasted apart from the backlash, he couldn’t even form hand seals. His Yuan Spirit appeared out of his head, forming hand seals for him.

Thousands of chains appeared behind Ye Ming’s back, stretching into the darkness. Just at that moment, Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus exploded.

BOOM!

Ye Ming’s chest was instantly pierced through, and the chains behind him were also blasted to bits. Ye Ming hacked up blood as he flew back.

Ye Ming was appalled. Just now, he had summoned his manifestation, and his chains had passed the energy of Long Chen’s attack into his manifestation.

Unexpectedly though, his dark energy that had never failed him was actually unable to absorb all of Long Chen’s energy. At best, it had weakened his attack by thirty percent.

The rest had exploded into his chest. If it weren’t for the thirty percent that had been absorbed, he would have definitely been blown apart. Even if he could protect his Yuan Spirit, his physical body would be irreparable.

In his last life, he had never encountered such a strange energy. This energy was not within the scope of things that his dark energy could devour.

Ye Ming was finally afraid and retreated. If this continued, he might end up leaving his life in this place.

He had never dreamed that Long Chen could control a power that his dark energy couldn’t devour. His manifestation had crumbled and he could no longer continue.

“You think you can run?” Long Chen snorted. Lightning wings spread on his back. Although his own situation was not good, he refused to let Ye Ming get away this time. As long as he gritted his teeth and didn’t give Ye Ming any breathing room, he was confident that he could kill him.

“Long Chen, get on!” Mo Nian’s shout suddenly rang out from the Ghost Ship. Long Chen was unable to see his figure, but he could hear the panic in his voice. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Looking at the severely injured Ye Ming that was retreating, Long Chen furiously clenched his fists. Once again, karmic luck was messing up his plans. It had been the same thing when he had been about to slay Zhao Ritian, something unexpected always happened.

If Mo Nian didn’t have something gravely important, he wouldn’t be calling for him in such a panic.

“Ye Ming, I’ll take your life next time.”

Long Chen clenched his teeth and flew back to the Ghost Ship. It was so fast that he was unable to catch up, so he had no choice but to grab the anchor.

Although he was prepared this time, the strange scenes that had occurred the last time reappeared. He ignored them, forcing himself to climb up the chain.

It was very slow climbing up this long chain. Furthermore, the closer he got to the Ghost Ship, the more the scenes in his head fluctuated.

Suddenly, the anchor was pulled in, dragging him toward the Ghost Ship. It was unknown if it was someone pulling him over or the Ghost Ship’s automatic reaction.

Long Chen felt his body flying through the chaotic flow of space, and it was as though knives were cutting across his body. Anyone else would probably be unable to endure this.

Finally, he arrived on the Ghost Ship. A layer of light had appeared on the Ghost Ship at some point, and he smashed into it like it was a mountain, causing stars to spin in his head. He almost coughed up blood.

Before he could even get a sense of his surroundings, cold astral wind appeared. This astral wind was a killing blow.

Long Chen had no time to think. He summoned the Demon Moon Furnace. After that, sparks exploded and Long Chen tumbled back.

He raised his head to see that his attacker was Di Feng. Di Feng had his manifestation up and was the one attacking him.

“A weakened tiger can die to a dog. But do you think that you are qualified to sneak attack me?” Long Chen was enraged. If it wasn’t for Mo Nian, Long Chen would have long since wiped out Di Feng himself.

“Long Chen, ignore that dog! Get over here!”

Mo Nian’s voice rang out from a distance. At this moment, Long Chen saw Mo Nian, Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, and the white-robed man surrounded by attackers.

Amongst those attackers were Feng Fei, Zhao Ritian, and Yu Qingxuan. The white-robed man was extremely powerful though. Every swing of his sword sliced through the void, forcing Feng Fei back repeatedly.

Yu Qingxuan’s Daynight Furnace slammed down, only to be knocked back by Mo Nian’s bow. Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang had also joined the battle for some reason and were being attacked by Zhao Ritian and the others.

Dozens of other experts had joined the battle at this time. Those experts weren’t particularly famous, but they were extremely powerful. With them surrounding Mo Nian and the others, they were in constant danger.

Long Chen then saw a giant gate behind the white-robed man. The gate was closed, but there was light peeking out from the cracks. The light was fluctuating more and more intensely as if it might open at any moment.

Long Chen realized that the white-robed man must know something about this place and wanted to be the first to enter the gate, so he was being attacked by Feng Fei and the others.

“I’m here!” Long Chen charged through with the Demon Moon Furnace. Three experts got in his way but were blown back. Di Feng also tried to stop him but was forced back by an arrow from Mo Nian.

BOOM!

The Demon Moon Furnace then slammed into the Daynight Furnace. The two pill furnaces rumbled, emitting an ear-piercing screech. Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood, but thanks to the Demon Moon Furnace, he managed to smoothly enter the center of the battlefield.

“You’re finally here. Let’s go.” The white-robed man nodded as if he had been waiting for Long Chen. He then sliced his sword before him, leaving a giant cut in the void enveloping everyone attacking them.

Feng Fei and the others’ attacks were strangely sent twisting away by some kind of mysterious energy contained within his slash. It seemed to contain some kind of spacetime law that rejected their attacks.

“Not good!” Zhao Ritian’s expression changed. He smashed a fist at the sword-light but was unable to break it.

Just at that moment, the gate opened. Long Chen felt his body lighten, and the scene before him changed. He found himself on top of a giant boat.

Before this, the prow of the Ghost Ship had been completely dark, making it impossible to see what was going on. Now, Long Chen saw that this was an ancient ship.

It was not a flying boat. It looked like an ordinary ship used to sail the seas in the mortal world. The only shocking thing about it was its size that far exceeded anything in the mortal world.

“There’s people here?” Nangong Zuiyue was startled. More and more figures were appearing around them at this moment.

Those people all wore ancient clothing, but they were varied. There were men and women, young and old. They were moving, seemingly conversing with each other and working on the ship.

Suddenly, everyone’s attention was drawn by one scene in particular. They saw thousands of people pulling a rope. They were dragging up the sail.

In the next moment, a group of people carrying a cask appeared, walking straight toward them. Mo Nian got out of the way, but those people made a sudden turn, and one person slipped, falling.

“Careful!” Mo Nian reached out, but that person slipped right through his fingers. Mo Nian stared down to see his hand had passed straight through this person’s body.

The person fell, causing the cask to fall as well. The scent of alcohol filled the air.

One of the people carrying the cask was particularly enraged and took out a whip, striking the person who had fallen over ten times. It was only when the victim was crying and his flesh was bloody that he stopped.

They quickly got water and cleaned up the alcohol. Curiously though, their bodies began to pass through each other as they worked.

“Everyone, this Ghost Ship is the one that Sovereign Yun Shang stopped back in the day. The cycle has now come full circle, and it has reappeared. I thought that this Ghost Ship was waiting for me, but now I found that all the karma has been thrown into disorder. Perhaps this was arranged by the Sovereign. This Ghost Ship passed through the past and the future. Its secrets have never been uncovered. Even the Sovereigns have to be careful about it. By using the Ghost Ship’s power, my Spacetime Sword Curse has blocked them for two hours. After two hours, they will also enter, so we should split up to explore the Ghost Ship. No one knows the secrets of the Ghost Ships. What we see on it are nothing more than its fragmented memories. By standing at different places, you will see different things. What you see, what you can obtain, whether good or bad, will be entirely up to your luck,” said the white-robed man.

“Many thanks, brother. Then I won’t stand on courtesy. I’m very curious about things that I don’t know, so I’ll take the first step.” Mo Nian cupped his fists to the white-robed man and stepped forward. With just one step, he vanished from everyone’s vision, causing everyone to jump.

“Space is in chaos here. With one step, he entered a different time than us. Once we split up, we will appear in different spacetimes. Unless you all reach the end of the ship, no one will be running into each other again,” explained the white-robed man.

Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang nodded. It seemed that it was impossible for two people to pass through this place together. With a reminder to be careful, they nodded and stepped forward, vanishing.

Long Chen cupped his fists toward the white-robed man as well and started to walk away when the white-robed man said, “Brother Long, please wait a moment.”
