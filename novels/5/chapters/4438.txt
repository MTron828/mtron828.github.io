Chapter 4427 Scram

Long Chen stood proudly before the gates of the High Firmament Academy, facing millions of experts without the slightest fear. His demeanor exuded arrogance and dominance, and his voice reached every ear with clear disdain. It seemed that he didn’t view any of them as even remotely significant.

Among the gathered crowd were heavenly geniuses of the current era and seasoned experts of the senior generation. There was even a particularly formidable genius on the verge of becoming a Heavenly Doyen. Yet, Long Chen boldly issued a challenge to all of them.

One on one, or all together? Just how arrogant was that? The academy’s experts felt their own blood heating up hearing those words. On the other hand, the experts of the various worlds were enraged by this disdain.

The budding Heavenly Doyen was particularly enraged. Although he had yet to make his breakthrough, he had never faced someone who was a match for him. Seeing that Long Chen was also a mid stage World King like him, he fearlessly shouted, “Big words! Then today I’ll-”

One of the Eternal experts of the nether dragon race suddenly interrupted him. “Hold it. We only came to send a challenge letter, and our young master Netherdragon Tianzhao wishes to fight Long Chen. If you take over, you will offend him.”

That heavenly genius’s expression sank, but he didn’t dare to disobey Netherdragon Tianzhao’s wish. He then looked at Long Chen coldly. “Brat, enjoy the last few days of your life! Netherdragon Tianzhao will soon take your dog head-!”

This time, it was Long Chen who interrupted him with a slap in the face. At this distance, no one could evade this divine strike.

A crisp sound rang out. The power of this slap was perhaps not enough to injure him, but it was enough to stun every single person here.

The budding Heavenly Doyen felt a stinging pain coming from his cheek. The look of the stunned onlookers intensified his fury, causing him to roar in anger after a brief moment of shock

“I’ll kill you!”

He was just about to attack when the older Eternal experts grabbed him and dragged him to the rear.

Not even looking at him as he was dragged away, Long Chen coldly spat out a single word to all the others here.

“Scram.”

Those experts were incensed, but when they looked into Long Chen’s eyes, for some reason, their souls shivered. An overwhelming aura of death sent a chilling shiver down their spines.

Ultimately, they chose to remain silent. As the experts of the nether dragon race departed, the rest followed suit, withdrawing from the scene.

Seeing Long Chen completely crush this group of arrogant experts, the High Firmament Academy’s experts regarded him with a newfound admiration. For someone to make millions of experts retreat with a single word, it was an awe-inspiring display of dominance.

“How gutless. You’re going to scram just because I tell you to? Can’t a few of you stay behind to fight?” Long Chen himself was a bit surprised that the entire crowd left just like that.

Originally, he had thought that a few arrogant fellows would be unwilling to leave just like that. As long as they dared to step forward, Long Chen could openly kill them and throw them into the primal chaos space as fertilizer.

However, to his dismay, not a single individual here displayed the slightest resilience. Their collective lack of backbone left him feeling disappointed.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Suddenly, a streak of golden light shot toward Long Chen. A casual wave of his hand allowed him to catch the object—a letter crafted from immortal metal. Surprisingly dense, it felt as heavy as a mountain.

“Presumably this is their challenge letter,” said the attendant. He was amazed that they would spend such precious immortal metal on a challenge letter.

“You should all retreat a bit,” urged Long Chen.

They didn’t understand, but they immediately fell back. As Long Chen unfolded the letter, he found a golden sheet of paper, with only one name inscribed upon it: Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Instantly, the name gleamed, and a formidable aura emanated from it.

BOOM!

The golden paper exploded, unleashing a violent force that shook the world. Cracks spread in every direction, leaving the attendant and the other disciples stunned.

The scales on Long Chen’s palm shattered, and blood stained his arm.

“Dean!”

Everyone was shocked. This sudden turn of events dumbfounded them.

“A Heavenly Doyen? As expected of someone chosen by the heavens. He can even draw out the power of the ten thousand Daos and infuse it in his writings. Interesting!” Long Chen looked at his bloody palm and smiled. A fiery heat appeared in his eyes.

A true Heavenly Doyen. Finally, Long Chen experienced the true power of a Heavenly Doyen.

This challenge letter was more than just a message—it was a manifestation of the power dynamics between experts. Netherdragon Tianzhao had embedded thirty percent of his power within it. If Long Chen couldn't withstand this initial impact, he wouldn't be considered fit to confront a Heavenly Doyen.

In response, Long Chen had also blocked it with thirty percent of his power. However, the resulting detonation exceeded his expectations, drawing upon the power of heaven and earth. Consequently, the force unleashed was more intense than he had anticipated, leaving his palm bloodied in the aftermath.

Long Chen didn’t feel any rage at this. Instead, he felt his blood heating up. He had finally found a real opponent. A Heavenly Doyen was even stronger than he had expected.

The stronger the opponent, the more it stimulated his battle intent. After all, it had been a long time since he encountered a powerful opponent.

“Dean, are you alright?” The others stepped forward now.

“I’m fine. The reputation of a Heavenly Doyen really isn’t for nothing.” Long Chen smiled. His arm had already fully recovered, showing no sign of previous wounds.

Long Chen intentionally refrained from using the life energy of the primal chaos space. He wanted to allow the wounds to persist for a while to fully experience the might of a Heavenly Doyen

However, the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill’s energy was still coursing through his body, and it immediately started the healing process. He couldn’t even stop it.
