Chapter 2582 Sealing the Essence, Qi, and Spirit

“What way?” asked Evilmoon in surprise.

“I’ll seal a portion of my essence, qi, and spirit. That way, I won’t end up using up all my energy and dying,” said Long Chen.

“And how are you supposed to seal them?” demanded Evilmoon.

“I’ll split my essence, qi, and spirit to you, Ling-er, and little Heaven. The three of you can help look after me.”

“Are you mad? If any one of us wanted to betray you, you would instantly die!”

Long Chen was essentially leaving his life in their hands. If any one of them wanted him dead, they could do it easily.

This was definitely crazy. To put his life in other people’s hands of his own accord, was he not turning himself into a puppet?

Long Chen mischievously laughed. “The three of you and the Moon and Star Refining Furnace are all my comrades. I trust you. There’s no need to mention the danger of betrayal. The Dragonblood Legion’s twelve thousand brothers are the same. I can entrust my life to them, so why can’t I do the same with you?”

“Big brother Long Chen, you really are great!” Ling-er immediately ran over and hugged Long Chen’s leg warmly.

“Thank you for your trust. I will not betray you in this life,” said the Moon and Star Refining Furnace.

The Heaven Flipping Seal didn’t know how to speak, so it could only express its gratitude with its spiritual fluctuations. It was like a child, so its intelligence couldn’t compare to Ling-er.

Ling-er and the others were so moved because it was always divine items entrusting their lives to their masters, not the other way around. Ling-er in particular was a demonic weapon who had gone through countless masters. She possessed the ability to devour her master and had long since lost any feelings toward the feeling known as trust. Hence, Long Chen’s trust made her especially moved. She was willing to die for him.

“Tch, how sickening,” snorted Evilmoon.

“Bad Evilmoon, bad fiend, you don’t know anything. Don’t think that just because big brother Long Chen doesn’t care that things are over! I still remember how you used me! I have a long memory for grudges, so just wait for my vengeance!” raged Ling-er. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Up to you,” said Evilmoon indifferently.

“Alright, alright, we’re not enemies. Ling-er, you seal thirty percent of my spiritual yuan, little Heaven, you seal thirty percent of my essence blood, and Evilmoon, you’re the strongest, so you seal thirty percent of my Spiritual Strength,” said Long Chen.

“It’s still useless. If you can’t control your anger, you won’t be able to differentiate between friend and foe,” said Evilmoon, pouring cold water over his idea.

“That’s why you’re in charge of my soul. To make sure I’m clear-minded, we’ll share souls,” said Long Chen.

“What bullshit is that? I’m from the dark evil dragon race. We’re the bloodthirstiest, cruelest existences in the evil dragon race. You want me to control your anger?” exclaimed Evilmoon in disbelief.

“Yes.” Long Chen simply nodded.

“Yes my ass! I’m the one enraged! I was refined into a weapon by that bastard Yun Shang! I don’t even have a physical body left! I’m the one whose anger needs to explode! If we join souls, our anger merges. Isn’t that just throwing oil on the fire?!” cursed Evilmoon.

Long Chen had decided on such a plan? That was unimaginable.

“That won’t happen. I feel like I have a dark side, but compared to you, it pales into insignificance. You can absorb my darkness, allowing me to remain clear-minded. I trust that you can do it. Evilmoon, you are a mighty expert from the evil dragon race. When you lost to Yun Shang, it was just a slip-up of carelessness. Such a minor matter is nothing to you,” said Long Chen calmly.

“Don’t play this crap with me. A defeat is a defeat. Don’t think that a few words will make me feel arrogant enough to do something impossible like an idiot. If you want to try it, then fine. I can only say that I’ll do my best. I’m just telling you that the chance of failure is extremely high,” snorted Evilmoon.

It was truly familiar with Long Chen. He was trying to praise it into taking more responsibility. But Evilmoon was not so foolish.

In truth, it wasn’t that it didn’t want to work things out. It was just that it was afraid of the darkness within Long Chen’s soul infecting it as well. Then they would all be doomed.

As a result, it could only give some warnings ahead of time. Once things started to get dicey, it would immediately stop things.

“Alright. Let’s start. I’ll pass the seeds of my essence, qi, and spirit for you guys to look after!”

Long Chen’s aura once more began to surge. In the distance, the old man and the others immediately paused their own training.

“This aura… it’s actually so stable.” The old man was startled. Long Chen’s aura was no longer as berserk as before. It was rising steadily, even more steadily than Boss Bao.

“Hahaha! I knew nothing could stop me!” Long Chen suddenly laughed arrogantly.

“Don’t be so shameless. This is all thanks to us,” snorted Evilmoon disdainfully.

With their souls merged, Evilmoon noticed that it could share Long Chen’s rage, allowing it to rise steadily. Even Evilmoon didn’t quite understand why this was the case.

“Have I been suppressing myself for so long that I’m used to it? Have I forgotten the pride and dignity of the dragon race?” Evilmoon began to question itself. “Or is it to say that the grievances that Long Chen has suffered are nothing to me?”

Even Evilmoon didn’t know what was going on. Long Chen’s intuition had been shockingly accurate. This plan really worked.

The divine ring was steadily growing. Cracks once more appeared in the void, but everything was still under control. Long Chen’s eyes were tinted red, however, he was still aware.

“Excellent. Let’s have an exchange.” The old man raised the Heaven Splitting Blade.

“Old man, be careful!” Long Chen felt unprecedented power. In this state, he had double the power.

The outside world’s energy ignited, and the cloud seas linked it to his astral spaces. These two energies mixed, creating a new energy that was vast and powerful.

As Long Chen slashed his saber, space was torn apart.

BOOM!

The Heaven Spitting Blade’s runes whirled, blocking Long Chen’s attack. At this moment, the void compressed and then suddenly exploded. Boss Bao and the others had long since fled but were still sent flying by the astral winds.

Long Chen’s divine ring slowly spun. The void rumbled and boomed. It was as if the heavens were enraged. Heavenly punishment was about to descend and wipe out all lives.

“Hahaha, good, very good. This is the control you need. Keep going!” The old man laughed delightedly. The fact that Long Chen was able to control the Heavens’ Wrath was the happiest thing.

“Is it alright to keep going?” asked Long Chen. Although it was a question, in his furious state, it became like an interrogation.

“What nonsense are you spouting? As long as you don’t go crazy again, you can use as much power as you can!” barked the old man. It was hard to remain calm in the Heavens’ Wrath state. It seemed that even the old man was affected.

“Alright!” Long Chen’s divine ring began to accelerate. As it sped up, more and more cracks appeared in the void.

The void was shattering like glass. Flames and lightning burst out of Long Chen.

“Stop!”

The old man and Evilmoon shouted at the same time. This space was no longer able to endure his power. If Long Chen kept going, the space would break. As for Evilmoon, it was shouting because Long Chen’s fury was starting to affect it as well.

“Hahaha, well done. How did you do this?” The old man patted Long Chen’s shoulder.

Bao Buping and the others also ran over. Long Chen didn't hide anything, so he directly explained.

Bao Buping was excited to hear it and also wanted to find two more divine items for himself. But the old man harshly told him off.

Long Chen had only done this because he had no other choice. He didn’t cultivate the Battle God Sacred Canon. As his cultivation technique didn’t match the ninth form of Split the Heavens, he had no choice but to take the risk. However, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples didn’t need to do so.

Furthermore, where would they find divine items like Evilmoon, the Demon Moon Furnace, and the Heaven Flipping Seal? Even if someone found them, how many item-spirits had an absolute bond of trust between them and their masters?

“Excellent, you’ve managed to control the Heavens’ Wrath. Then I can explain how to use the ninth form of Split the Heavens. It requires eighty-one acupuncture points. Nine-nines is the peak. After activating all eighty-one acupuncture points, you have to reconnect to the first acupuncture points. By forming a link between the start and end, you get a complete cycle. If you are unable to form this cycle, your body will instantly explode,” warned the old man gravely.

“That…” Boss Bao and the others’ expressions changed. To link the strongest acupuncture point with the weakest would require very precise control over their spiritual yuan. Such a thing might be simple during normal times, but in the Heavens’ Wrath state, just how were they supposed to have such delicate control?

“I know it’s very difficult, but when you succeed, you will know that it is all worth it,” said the old man.

Suddenly, the jade plate on the old man’s waist lit up. The old man checked it and was surprised. “Long Chen, Guo Ran from your Dragonblood Legion has come to see you.”

“Ah, there’s no need. Help me tell him to exercise and relax his muscles.” Long Chen chortled. Guo Ran had come out of seclusion, so he definitely wanted to settle the grudge between them.

“Alright, then let’s continue training.”

…

Just as Long Chen was training in the ninth form of Split the Heavens, a group of people arrived in front of the Yin Yang World. One person stepped forward, arrogantly shouting into the Yin Yang World.

“Little imps of the Blood race, get out here for your daddy Guo! I haven’t killed anyone in a few days, so I’ll need a few of you to satisfy me!”
