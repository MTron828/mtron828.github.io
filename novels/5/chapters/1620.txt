Chapter 1615 A Pageant

Translator: BornToBe

Only now did Long Chen learn that it had been two months in the outer world since he had entered the Netherworld.

By the time he returned to the Xuantian Dao Sect, the basic shapes of the buildings had come into being. Many majestic mountains were already supported by formations. Although they were still barren, things were starting to take shape.

However, when he returned, he only saw a portion of experts still working. The construction in many places had stalled.

“Long Chen, this goal of yours really is too big.” Li Tianxuan looked at Long Chen with a complicated expression.

As the Xuan Master, reconstructing the Xuantian Dao Sect was his responsibility. However, Long Chen’s plans for the reconstruction were too grand.

Only once the construction began did they realize that the cost would be even greater than what they had estimated. There was not one area that didn’t need more money.

Just laying down this basic foundation and finishing the cultivation and training areas for disciples had taken up as much money as the savings of any supreme sect.

Finishing the training grounds could temporarily steady the hearts of the new disciples. Although they were geniuses amongst geniuses, if their treatment in the Xuantian Dao Sect was so bad that they couldn’t even train, their morale would drop. Then reconstructing would be even more difficult.

The first thing they had done was to build the training grounds and lay the basic framework for the rest. Although some parts looked grand already, they were empty inside. The true money-burning areas involved the grand formation.

Just building what was essentially an empty shell had used up all the money Long Chen had ripped off of Pill Valley and the money he had borrowed from Zheng Wenlong.

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s original savings had also been tossed into the construction. However, they weren’t even halfway done. In fact, Li Tianxuan estimated that they were only thirty percent of the way through. That was why he said that Long Chen’s goal was too big.

Worst of all, even Li Tianxuan, the leader of the sect, couldn’t do anything about it. He could only hope for Long Chen to make more money. That was truly embarrassing.

“Hehe, in my view, any problems that can be solved with money aren’t real problems.” Long Chen handed Li Tianxuan a spatial ring.

“How... how do you have this much?!” Li Tianxuan gasped.

Long Chen didn’t hide what he had done. He told Li Tianxuan about how he had gone to the Netherworld with the old man and then ended up causing a bit of trouble in the Corrupt path. He concealed certain portions just like he had with the seven bosses.

“You actually went to the Netherworld?!”

Long Chen explained the situation outside the Netherworld’s Gates of Hell. He didn’t feel any sense of unease when speaking of those things, so he felt that there shouldn’t be any karma.

“Little fellow, you really were vicious.” Li Tianxuan looked at the almost one billion spirit crystals in the spatial ring with admiration.

Long Chen not only had heaven-shaking combat power, but his money-making abilities were also heaven-defying.

“Is Wilde alright?” asked Long Chen.

“His body seems to have reached a full state. However, it seems it will still be some time until he wakes up.”

“Alright then. Xuan Master, I’ll leave the matter of reconstructing the sect to you. This money should be enough for now, and after a bit more time, Zheng Wenlong should be sending over more money. Although it still isn’t enough, it should alleviate some of the urgency. Again, just leave the matter of money to me. I’m going to go see my brothers.”

Long Chen said goodbye to Li Tianxuan and went to the mountain belonging to the Dragonblood Legion. All the other mountains were barren, and the formations supporting them hadn’t been finished yet.

However, the Dragonblood Legion’s mountain was already flourishing with greenery. Dense spiritual qi circulated around it. There was clearly a powerful formation at work. The density of spiritual qi in the air could almost suffocate a mortal.

This mountain was still called Crouching Dragon Mountain, and only the Dragonblood warriors could enter. This was a land belonging solely to them.

The cultivation caves were all of the highest possible level, and there was an independent transportation formation that allowed them to go directly to the central plaza. This was the unique privilege bestowed solely to the Dragonblood Legion.

Li Tianxuan’s actions were very smart. This was an era where the strong were worshipped. Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion were the symbols of the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Li Tianxuan made them into stars shining in the bright sky, existences others would have to look up to. He did this not to incite other people’s jealousy, but to increase their worship for them.

Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion’s rise was a legendary story. He had to maintain a mystical feeling around them to effectively keep the other disciples in high morale.

“Boss, you’re back!”

As soon as Long Chen appeared on Crouching Dragon Mountain, a Dragonblood warrior let out a startled cry, and the rest of the warriors surged out of their various residences like a swarm of bees.

“Hahaha, good job. You’ve all reached the mid Soul Transformation realm. This speed really is shocking.” Long Chen was truly shocked when he sensed their auras. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The majority of the Dragonblood Legion had reached the fourth Heavenstage of Soul Transformation. Gu Yang and the others had even reached the fifth Heavenstage. As for Long Chen, he wasn’t even at the first Heavenstage. During this time, he hadn’t had any time to cultivate, so his cultivation base had stagnated.

“Each of us has our own soul nourishing formation in our caves. Even when we sleep, we continue to get stronger. How could we not be fast?” said Li Qi excitedly.

They clearly felt very glorious with the special treatment the Xuantian Dao Sect had given them. This was a symbol of their status.

Soul Transformation experts mainly cultivated the Yuan Spirit. The main component of the Yuan Spirit was Spiritual Strength, so soul nourishing formations and pills were must-haves for them.

Li Tianxuan had built the best possible soul nourishing formations for the Dragonblood warriors. Even throughout the entire continent, they were top level. That was the power of money.

Even without soul nourishing pills, just cultivating in their caves allowed them to progress rapidly.

Of course, this kind of rapid pace would only occur at the start. Their speed had dropped after reaching the mid stage, and by the late stage, their pace would be much slower.

“Are the new fellows still obedient?” asked Long Chen.

“Everything’s well. The majority are courteous, and even if they challenge us, they do it with the attitude of learning. Some thorns became obedient after a few beatings. As for the few who liked causing trouble, after a few bashings, they couldn’t bear it anymore and left,” said Gu Yang.

There was an immense number of geniuses that had joined recently. Those geniuses had previously liked to look down on others. Some people who felt that they would be amazing existences in the Xuantian Dao Sect, second only to Long Chen, realized that they were nothing here after a few beatings. They then decided to leave. Perhaps that was a case of rather being the head of a chicken than the tail of a bull. Being in the Xuantian Dao Sect was truly a blow to arrogant geniuses.

However, the absolute majority stayed. The cultivation conditions here were much better than where they had come from. Furthermore, they could exchange pointers with true experts. That allowed them to progress at the fastest speed.

Furthermore, another important factor was the Xuantian Dao Sect’s potential. The scale at which it was being rebuilt was shocking. If the disciples had such excellent treatment while the sect was still being built, what about once it was finished? The people that left were viewed as fools by the ones who stayed. They were the typical short-sighted people.

Xuantian Dao Sect had the best training grounds, the best resources, and the best geniuses to exchange pointers with. What place could be better than here?

“That’s good. In a new batch, there are always going to be a few arrogant and toxic people that need some wearing in. However, don’t worry about it. Our Dragonblood Legion isn’t taking in new people, no matter how good their talent is. Right now, your first goal should be to work on your cultivation. Maintain that feeling of crisis and urgency. None of us have any idea when the next battle will start. We have to stay on guard,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, is there anything for us to do? Some brothers are feeling bored lately after having their power rise and only being able to play around with a bunch of brats. How about you bring us for a stroll through the Corrupt path?” asked Gu Yang suddenly.

Long Chen’s lip curled. “Guo Ran, you little brat, why are you making Gu Yang the villain?”

Before Gu Yang had spoken, Guo Ran had stood behind him and poked him several times. Although it was out of Long Chen’s sight, Guo Ran’s actions couldn’t escape Long Chen’s spiritual perception.

“Hehe, boss, these words are hurtful. I had Gu Yang say it because other than you, he is the brightest, most dazzling existence in the Dragonblood Legion. Only Gu Yang’s brilliance can stand shoulder to shoulder with you,” laughed Guo Ran. Everyone looked at Gu Yang’s bright and shining head and laughed.

Gu Yang awkwardly rubbed his bald head. However, he wasn’t angered. His bald head was natural and it was his trademark. No one else had this kind of luster. This was his pride.

“Focus on cultivating. Did you think that just because there’s no movement from Pill Valley, the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, the Righteous sects, the Bloodkill Hall, and the Xuan Beasts that they’ve let this go? Stop dreaming. Although I don’t know what they’re up to, it’s obvious they’re just waiting for a chance to eliminate us. The initiative is now in their hands. What we have to do now is work hard on cultivating and accumulate our own trump cards so that we aren’t slaughtered when the time comes. Don’t be deceived by how much stronger you’ve grown. Our enemies are getting stronger too. Furthermore, our enemies won’t follow any rules. They’ll use any means necessary as long as it means we die. We don’t have that much time to waste on having fun. Go back and do what you have to do.”

Long Chen dismissed these battle fanatics, speechless. It seemed that they were in a rush to fight after having their power grow. If they didn’t have a real fight, they wouldn’t be able to focus. As for himself, he was going left and right, busy with all sorts of things. Just who was the real boss here?

“Have Chu Yao and the others returned?”

While everyone was scattering, Long Chen suddenly thought of something and grabbed Guo Ran.

Guo Ran clapped his forehead. “Aiya, that’s right! I almost forgot! Boss, sister Chu Yao sent a letter asking you to go to the Skywood Divine Palace. There’s a pageant going on there.”
