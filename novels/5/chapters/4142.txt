Chapter 4131 Let’s See

Long Chen kept gesturing for the people outside the city, as if nothing had happened. His acting skill was so good that no one realized he had been hiding his preparation for this one attack.

After all, Long Chen had long since known that this fellow would attack. He just wanted to capture him alive and subdue him in one move.

Thus, when that innate Heaven Venerate vanished, Long Chen’s hand swiftly lashed out into the empty space. Long Chen initiated the strike, but the Heaven Venerate's astounding speed made it seem as though he had thrust his own face into Long Chen's awaiting hand.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s hand solidly struck that innate Heaven Venerate’s face. The sheer force of this carefully prepared blow caused the void to collapse, propelling a figure out of the void like a shooting star.

When that figure pierced the earth, the impact gave rise to a huge wave that caused the entire world to sway. All the buildings inside the city then crumbled, transforming into ruins.

Seeing the apocalyptic scene before them, all the spectators stood in stupefied silence. This slap was not a magical art, a Battle Skill, or a divine ability—it was purely the raw might of Long Chen’s physical body. Yet, the devastation it wrought was nothing short of astounding.

Furthermore, the victim of this slap was an innate Heaven Venerate. An ordinary Heaven Venerate would probably have turned into a blood smear by that slap.

Even the other experts of the Soaring Dragon Company were dumbfounded. They had thought that they would easily crush Long Chen and wouldn’t even need the innate Heaven Venerate to take action.

BOOM!

The next moment, the earth exploded as the innate Heaven Venerate soared out of the ground. Now, everyone could see that half of his face was badly mangled, and his once neat hair resembled a wild mess. In addition to his bloody red robes, his appearance was extremely wretched.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

His face in particular was twisted like a fiend. He had thought that his sneak attack would easily capture Long Chen, but this slap from Long Chen completely woke him up from his delusions. Every move he made had long since been seen through by Long Chen.

The feeling of being completely humiliated caused his killing intent to explode. In all his years, when would he have ever suffered such a humiliation?

“Die!”

He roared furiously, and his manifestation appeared behind him. At the same time, a blood-red sword appeared in his hand and slashed toward Long Chen.

“He’s going all-out?!” Startled cries rang out. This innate Heaven Venerate had not just summoned his manifestation to deal with a junior Immortal King but had also taken out his divine weapon.

Just as the innate Heaven Venerate unleashed his power, the void shook and shattered, unable to endure his terrifying pressure.

After all, an innate Heaven Venerate possessed the power to crush an entire world, so it was no wonder that some weaker cultivators found that they couldn’t move under this pressure.

They watched as the cracking void slowly spread into the surroundings and even on their bodies. It appeared as if they would shatter at any moment along with the void.

They tried to scream, but somehow they couldn’t open their mouths. All they could do was wait for death.

Countless people were horrified. It was their first time personally experiencing the terrifying power of an innate Heaven Venerate, but it was too late for them to get out of this experience. The stronger people were already retreating at full power, while the weaker ones could only await death.

In front of that power, Long Chen clenched the Minghong Saber. His own power had long since been summoned and channeled at his fingertips.

Just as Long Chen was preparing to exchange blows with an innate Heaven Venerate, a bone spear stabbed through the air, striking the innate Heaven Venerate’s sword. A ripple then spread, causing the people who hadn’t fled before to be turned to dust.

Even some of the more powerful experts, who fled as soon as they could, were struck by the qi wave. As a result, countless people coughed up blood, their bodies cracking and on the verge of breaking.

As for the innate Heaven Venerate, his body shuddered, and he was forced back seven steps. With every step he took, the void collapsed beneath his feet. He almost spat out blood, but he forcibly suppressed it.

Feeling shocked and enraged, he roared at the void, “Fullmoon race, what do you think you’re doing?!”

Following his roar, the void slowly twisted, and one figure after another appeared. Their leader was shockingly the Fullmoon race’s leader, Xu Jianxiong.

Beside Xu Jianxiong was Xu Changchuan, and there were hundreds of Heaven Venerates behind the two of them, as well as hundreds of thousands of their disciples.

The appearance of the Fullmoon race shook people’s hearts, stunning the people here with their powerful auras. Xu Jianxiong’s aura in particular was even more frightening than the innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company.

“We’re not doing anything. Long Chen is an important guest of my Fullmoon race, so anyone who dares to make things hard on him will become enemies with my Fullmoon race,” said Xu Jianxiong lightly.

“Are you declaring war on my Soaring Dragon Company?!” raged the Soaring Dragon Company’s innate Heaven Venerate.

Xu Jianxiong raised his hand, and the bone spear that had pierced into the ground returned to his grasp. He sneered, “You are nothing more than dirty businessmen who eat people whole, not even spitting out their bones. Do you think you’re worth us declaring war on you? If you disagree, we can always have a real fight. Let me see whether or not Lord Brahma will really step out for you.”

The Soaring Dragon Company was also one of Lord Brahma’s subordinate powers. To put it frankly, they were already enemies with the Fullmoon race, so Xu Jianxiong didn’t give them any face.

“Good, very good! Your Fullmoon race has guts! Then let’s see who’s the last one standing!”

The innate Heaven Venerate’s expression countenance darkened. However, he could only say some vicious words before leaving with his people.

After all, there was nothing that he could do here. That had been his full-power attack, while Xu Jianxiong had simply hurled his spear from a distance, but it almost made him cough up blood. From this one attack, he knew that the difference between them was immense.

Furthermore, between Heaven Venerates, the human race had a natural disadvantage against the demonic beast race. So, since he couldn’t intimidate or beat Xu Jianxiong, he could only leave.

“Uncle Xiong, congratulations!”

When Long Chen looked at Xu Jianxiong, he sensed that the latter’s aura was completely different from before. Xu Jianxiong had to have advanced a step. However, Long Chen didn’t know whether or not Xu Jianxiong had reached the half-step Eternal realm.

“The Sage King Convention is about to start, so it would be best for you to not fight with your full power before it, especially not for such a senseless battle. Just use your energy on the Sage King Convention,” advised Xu Jianxiong.

Long Chen nodded, knowing that Xu Jianxiong’s words were correct. If Long Chen had fought the innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company, he would have been forced to use his full power. His trump cards would have been exposed.

Unfortunately, countless heavenly geniuses and monsters would be appearing in the Sage King Convention, so it would be best for them to not expose their trump cards unless they had absolutely no other choice. Sometimes, a single trump card could be the difference between defeat and victory on the martial stage.

“Long Chen, perhaps you should stick with us. No one would dare to bully you with us!” said Xu Jianxiong.

Long Chen nodded. After all, his goal was to win the Sage King Convention. Exposing his trump cards so easily wasn’t a good idea.

However, Long Chen didn’t forget to turn back to the spectators just before leaving.

“Everyone, don’t forget the matter of the Heaven Earth Cauldron! Help me spread the word. I welcome all customers. If you really connect me with someone who can trade for it, I won’t forget your contributions!”

Those spectators were all speechless. This Long Chen possessed terrifying power, so why did he have to be a scammer?

Everyone scattered. Long Chen headed to the Sage King Prefecture with the Fullmoon race.
