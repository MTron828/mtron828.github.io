Chapter 2605 Show of Power

“I’ve always been brazen. The entire Martial Heaven Continent is aware of it. Are you acting like this to show just how stupid you are? Or is this simply a manifestation of your stupidity?” said Long Chen.

This man was wearing silver robes, so he was most likely one of the guards of a Sovereign sprout. But Long Chen didn’t know which Sovereign sprout he belonged to.

That person’s shout drew the attention of the surrounding warriors of the divine families, and they immediately formed an encirclement around Long Chen. Thousands of them glared at Long Chen furiously.

“If you’re here to show me the way, tuck away your tail and do your mission. If not, then scram. I haven’t killed anyone in quite a few days. I don’t want to start smelling like blood again,” said Long Chen impatiently.

“Don’t be rude to our guest.”

A new group of people came over, and their leader was someone very familiar. It was the Long family’s Heaven Elder, Elder Long.

Only once he arrived did that silver robe person snort and leave.

After that, Elder Long looked at Long Chen with a faint smile. “It’s been a long time since we’ve seen each other. Have you been well?”

“Nothing bad has happened to my body, but I don’t feel too happy inside,” said Long Chen lightly.

Elder Long didn’t take it badly. He only laughed and gestured to Long Chen. “Let’s talk while we walk!”

As Elder Long had brought a group of experts from the Long family to accompany Long Chen, the other disciples of the divine families got out of their way, but not before glaring at Long Chen furiously, expressing all of their hostility. However, Long Chen didn’t even look at them.

“I’m curious, you seem very unhappy. Has there been some misunderstanding?” asked Elder Long as if they were just chatting happily.

“Do I need to explain it clearly?” Long Chen frowned. Was he unaware of what the Long family had done?

Elder Long looked at Long Chen. “I remember the first time we met, I told you that the Long family was willing to cooperate with you. This cooperation was to share risks and profits. Why mix random emotions into it as well?”

Long Chen stared at him and thought about it. This truly was the case. His collaboration with the Long family was simply each side taking what they needed. The Long family had not promised him anything, and he had not promised the Long family anything.

Elder Long smiled and suddenly switched to a spiritual transmission. “Long Chen, you’re still too young, and you act based on your emotions. That’s a betrayal of the original intent of our collaboration. You care too much about relationships. Due to the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion, you’ve almost started to think yourself to be a member of the divine families. Let me give you some personal advice. If you wish to collaborate with a giant existence, you can never use emotions, because no major power will make decisions based on feelings. Their only goal is profit. If it benefits you, then do it. If not, then pull out. People standing to the side criticizing people’s morals and blaming others are foolish trash. Other than cursing people, they have no ability. The Long family doesn’t owe you anything. Likewise, you owe the Long family nothing as well. Each party is simply getting what they want from the other. Everyone is benefitting, right?”

Long Chen’s heart jumped. Elder Long’s cultivation base might not be high, but he was highly intelligent. He was able to use a spectator’s viewpoint to see things clearly.

Before this, Long Chen was angry because the Long family had not given him any information about what was going on in the Star Field Divine World.

However, now when he thought about it, the Long family was under no obligation to tell him those things. They were part of the divine families, and they couldn’t just expose their secrets to him.

It went without saying that Elder Long was truly skilled. With just a few words, he made Long Chen’s anger toward the Long family vanish.

“Many thanks for the reminder.” Long Chen nodded.

Elder Long smiled. “What’s between us is nothing more than a mutually beneficial collaboration. There is no need for thanks. Relationships with integrity and morality are between individual people and rarely between actual sects and powers. Remember, when it comes to large powers, only profit can draw them together. When the profits end, so does the relationship. I heard that you’re very close with the Huayun Sect, so I had assumed that you understood this principle. Never use feelings when it comes to business. Otherwise, you will become enemies with the other party.”

Long Chen nodded and then cupped his fists. “Many thanks for your wisdom. Junior is enlightened.”

This reminder from Elder Long was extremely useful to Long Chen. Just the fact that he would do this while standing from the position of the Long family showed that he had his own bottom line. He was an elder worthy of respect.

Elder Long simply smiled and didn’t respond. After that, the two of them passed through two more transportation formations before arriving at a mountain. This was somewhere Long Chen had never gone to before.

“I’m only sending you here. The rest of the path is up to you,” said Elder Long with a double meaning.

Long Chen nodded with thanks and walked toward the mountain gates. When he passed through them, the world changed, and a straight path appeared stretching toward the mountain peak.

All of a sudden, his body tightened when he saw that both sides of the path were filled with countless warriors of the divine families. These warriors were all true experts that had experienced countless battles. Right now, all of them had their hands on their weapons, killing intent exuding out of them. They were all experts at the peak of Netherpassage. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Is this an intimidation tactic? Tch, how immature. However, I have no choice but to say that you succeeded,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen truly was shocked. So the warriors that he had seen in the Star Field Divine World were just a fraction of the warriors of the divine families. Their power was truly astonishing.

However, Long Chen’s words caused their murderous faces to twitch. They almost tripped.

These warriors looked at Long Chen oddly, but they didn’t say a word. Usually, the killing intent of ten million experts was enough to make a person unable to move from the pressure, but it was useless against Long Chen. It seemed that he couldn’t even sense it. Perhaps he had killed so many people that he was already numb to killing intent.

Anyway, Long Chen knew that this was a show of might from the divine families. They wanted to shock him, to show him their terror.

Therefore, Long Chen ignored them. He was swaggering through their formation, making these warriors clench their teeth angrily. It seemed that they were nothing in Long Chen’s eyes.

The next moment, weapons came out of their sheaths, and space solidified with freezing killing intent.

However, Long Chen’s expression didn’t change. He continued walking according to his original tempo.

“The divine families really are powerful, but I don’t see the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion. It seems that they’re still holding back.” Long Chen’s divine sense spread, but he didn’t sense Sheng Chengfeng and the others’ auras.

“Nevertheless, if you’re trying to scare me, then you’re wasting your energy.” Long Chen shook his head. He disdained this way of handling things of the divine families. Did they view him as a coward?

At this moment, those warriors even began to circulate their Blood Qi, raising their auras.

“I’m warning you, don’t try using divine sense to lock me down, or I’ll slaughter you. If you don’t believe me, go ahead and try it. This is my only warning.” Long Chen suddenly stopped and turned toward one particular person amongst the crowd.

That warrior suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed on the ground.

Others didn’t know what had happened, but they knew that Long Chen had done something. In that instant, it appeared as if they were one step away from charging over and killing him.

However, Long Chen continued walking. In the end, those warriors didn’t attack, and Long Chen reached the end of the path.

As he stepped up the stairs, before he even saw what was at the top, pressure crashed down. The bricks beneath his feet shattered, and it caused Long Chen’s expression to change. This pressure was trying to force him to kneel. Moreover, this was a bloodline pressure, most likely the specific bloodline power of the divine families.

Furious, Long Chen roared and erupted with his own Blood Qi. A majestic dragon roar resounded throughout the world.

In the blink of an eye, the bricks around Long Chen exploded, and dragon scales covered his body. Right now, a blood-colored tide surged around him, blasting apart the pressure.

Only then did Long Chen manage to raise his head and look at his surroundings. However, this made him even more furious. This was a palace with over a thousand elders inside.

These elders all had Heavenly Dao runes revolving around them, seeming to be one with heaven and earth. They were all Heaven Merging experts.

“This is how the divine families treat their guests?! How fucking shameless. Why not just fight?!” Long Chen cursed and took out Evilmoon, pointing it at those elders.

The divine families were really going too far, trying to embarrass him. This many Heaven Merging experts were using their bloodline power to suppress him.

“Cheeky brat. Are the divine families really trying to work together with such an unrefined person?” An old woman snorted disdainfully.

“The divine families are actually working with someone so inferior? That’s practically the greatest insult in our history,” sneered an old man.

“As a human, he doesn’t even have human blood. He uses the blood of a beast. What a half-breed,” sneered another elder.

Just as everyone was insulting him, Long Chen made his move. Long Chen arrived right in front of that person.

With a simple slap, the elder’s face caved in, and one of his eyes even flew out.

As a result, everyone was stunned, not having expected that Long Chen would dare to attack in front of this many people. Furthermore, he wasn’t affected by all this bloodline pressure.

“Brute, face your death!” roared the slapped elder.

At this moment, Long Chen directly stabbed Evilmoon through that elder’s chest.

“Who dares to try and touch me?!” shouted Long Chen.
