Chapter 3421 Skinning

Long Chen’s fingers blinded the man from the Blue Eye Bright Scale race. Long Chen was fast and struck at an angle that left his opponent unable to even react.

“This is…!”

“That movement art…!”

The demonic beasts turned to the Lightning Falcon race. In terms of speed, the Lightning Falcon race stood at the peak of these demonic beasts. This was what allowed them to be arrogant. Not a single race here was capable of comparing to them.

Long Chen’s movements just now had vaguely been followed by the sound of rushing thunder. It was similar to the Lightning Falcon race’s movement art.

“Don’t look at me. I don’t know anything,” said the leader of the Lightning Falcon race coldly.

“AH!”

Just then, Long Chen pushed his fingers deeper into that man’s head. He was overflowing with killing intent.

That nine star heir was killed right in front of him while he was powerless to help. Long Chen was about to go crazy with rage. Now, all this fury was about to be unleashed on this unlucky fellow.

Suddenly, the Blue Eye Bright Scale man returned to his true form, transforming into a giant serpent with four bright scales on his body. That was the origin of their name.

In his true form, he escaped from Long Chen’s grasp. After that, he opened his mouth, and black mist shot out at Long Chen.

That black mist had just appeared when Long Chen vanished and reappeared on the serpent’s back. A lightning blade then manifested in his hand and hacked down.

Blood splashed. Those tough scales were unable to block his lightning blade, and a large gash appeared on the serpent’s back.

That serpent roared, trying to create distance from Long Chen, only for Long Chen to attack again. This time, Long Chen’s lightning blade destroyed the scales protecting his neck. Long Chen almost cut off his head.

However, with this, the serpent finally had a chance to strike Long Chen with his tail. That attack contained almost all his power.

The void collapsed wherever the tail went, but it suddenly stopped. Space returned to calm, revealing that a hand had caught his tail.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Idiot. You shouldn’t have provoked me. Since you want to die, I’ll help you out. I’m missing a snakeskin belt.”

Long Chen was infuriated. He didn’t want to get angry, but there were always people forcing him. This person had also provoked him before, insulting him. Just like that, Long Chen raised this person’s giant snake body into the air and then slammed it into the ground.

BOOM!

The earth crumbled, and a huge qi wave spread.

Grabbing his tail, Long Chen repeatedly whipped him onto the ground.

“Didn’t you say that I would die to your hands? Say it again! Say it again!”

Long Chen smashed him into the ground over and over again. The earth was constantly being destroyed, and the serpent hacked up blood.

Long Chen had crippled his eyes right at the start, resulting in him being unable to unleash many of his divine abilities. Even with his tough physical body, without the support of his eyes, his speed was impacted.

In truth, the Blue Eye Bright Scale race was very powerful, and their pupil arts were innate. Although their eyes couldn’t compare to the Three Flower Pupils, they were still very powerful.

Regretfully, this fellow was too overconfident and was instantly crippled by Long Chen right at the start, leaving him unable to unleash his power.

Long Chen was crazily venting his rage using his opponent’s body. This pitiful fellow became a tool for Long Chen’s anger management.

Long Chen had reached the verge of madness due to the nine star heir’s death. If he didn’t vent it now, he would be unable to control his own emotions. He would also be unable to fight in his peak condition.

With every smash, the serpent’s wounds worsened. His scales gradually broke off of his body, and his tough hide was being ripped off.

The experts outside the Divine Lord Immortal Realm all shivered. Long Chen wasn’t playing around. He really was planning on skinning the Blue Eye Bright Scale race.

BOOM!

Finally, all that was left in Long Chen’s hand was a complete snakeskin. As for the eyeless serpent, he had fainted.

Just then, a bolt of lightning flew through the air. Lei Yuner arrived. When she saw the snakeskin in Long Chen’s hand as well as the expert of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race lying on the ground, she covered her mouth in shock.

Everyone had been brought in at random locations. However, Lei Yuner had placed a mark on Long Chen’s body right before entering so that she could find him quickly. She had then immediately rushed over. It had only been a few breaths’ time, but Long Chen had skinned this expert of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race.

Although she detested the Blue Eye Bright Scale race, she had to admit that they were very powerful. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be the leading power of the scaled beasts.

Long Chen stabbed his lightning blade through the serpent’s head. Just like that, this future pillar of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race was killed.

“This is the snakeskin belt that I promised you. It’s colorful.” Long Chen tossed the snakeskin to Lei Yuner, completely indifferent to having killed the Blue Eye Bright Scale race’s top genius. He had at least vented.

Lei Yuner didn’t stand on courtesy. She took the snakeskin and grabbed his hand. “Don’t waste time. Let’s get to the core.”

The Lightning Falcon race and the Blue Eye Bright Scale race were mortal enemies. Other than in some special regions, they would always fight to the death when they encountered each other, so she didn’t feel any sympathy for their death.

In comparison, she cared far more about the core. Getting to the core and undergoing tribulation was the most important thing for them.

Lei Yuner then transformed into a Lightning Falcon. Spreading her wings, she brought Long Chen flying toward the core. They instantly vanished from their original location.

“Long Chen, I will tear you to pieces!”

In the plaza, the leader of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race roared furiously. The disciple that Long Chen had just slain was praised as a heavenly genius that only appeared once every ten thousand years in the Blue Eye Bright Scale race. However, he had been killed just like that.

Furthermore, it was such an insulting death. Long Chen actually skinned him. That was a huge humiliation to the entire Blue Eye Bright Scale race.

“What are you shouting here for? If you have the ability, go charge in and kill Long Chen right now,” sneered an expert from the Lightning Falcon race.

The death of that Blue Eye Bright Scale man was like honey sweetening the hearts of the Lightning Falcon race. They truly felt amazing now.

Any dissatisfaction that they had felt about Lei Yuner choosing Long Chen vanished. Hearing that he came from the High Firmament Academy and was actually the dean of a branch made them feel incomparably excited.

“It was your Lightning Falcon race that brought Long Chen here just to target the Sacred Pill Hall, wasn’t it?!” shouted the leader of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race suddenly.

At that moment, the expression of everyone from the Lightning Falcon race changed.
