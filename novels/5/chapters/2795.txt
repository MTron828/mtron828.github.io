Chapter 2784 Gambling Life

“Hu Feng, you…” Mo Nian had a bad feeling when he looked at Hu Feng.

“Brother Mo, you should go handle Ye Ming. Leave this place to me. To be able to have made friends like brother Mo, brother Yun, and brother Long in this lifetime, I, Hu Feng, have no regrets.”

“Scram!” The Alldevil Heavenwalker roared. That blow just now was incredibly strange. It had caused his power to simply bounce off. Hence, he unleashed a palm at Hu Feng.

However, the void shuddered suddenly and a giant die appeared in front of Hu Feng. It once more knocked aside the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s attack.

“Brother Mo, don’t hesitate!” shouted Hu Feng.

“Brother Hu, hold on as long as you can! Once I kill Ye Ming, I’ll immediately come to assist you!” Mo Nian shot off toward Ye Ming with the Central Plains Cauldron.

With him having left that side, the remaining fighters had been in a precarious position, so when he joined in again, the danger dropped quite a bit for every person. However, the feeling of unease in Mo Nian’s heart grew more intense when he looked at Hu Feng.

The giant die spun in the air. As it spun, a giant whirlpool appeared in the air, and a terrifying aura came out of it, causing the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s expression to change.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker then attacked the die with his full power. After that, he found that the die was something that existed between illusion and reality. Half his power was repelled, and the other half was absorbed.

“It’s useless. This is the strongest move of the Gambling Heavenly Dao, as well as the final move. I didn’t join the fighting all this time because I was waiting for the most critical moment. To tell the truth, I feel a bit unwilling to use this move on you, because I know that there might be even stronger existences later.” Hu Feng looked toward the four channels as the die spun. In the end, his gaze fell toward the silent immortal palace.

“What do you mean?” demanded the Alldevil Heavenwalker.

“The Gambling Heavenly Dao’s heirs have another name, the fifty-fifties. No matter how strong the opponent is, we always have a fifty percent chance of beating them. We gamble against heavens and earth, but the strongest move is to gamble our own life. Using my life as the stakes, I bet all my chips to grasp a trace of the ephemeral existence within the ten thousand Daos,” said Hu Feng. He was a bit skinny with his scholarly appearance, but he also gave off the feeling of an unbending warrior.

“What absolute nonsense.” The Alldevil Heavenwalker sneered and went around the die to attack Hu Feng.

However, he was startled to find that despite clearly having gone around the die already, when he attacked, his palm still landed on the die.

He didn’t know if he had simply not moved or if this space was being controlled, causing him to move with it.

He was shocked by Hu Feng’s die. He then coldly snorted, “I can’t be bothered to waste time with you.”

The Alldevil Heavenwalker abandoned him and flew toward Long Chen, only to find that no matter how he moved, Hu Feng and his die would appear in front of him. Spacetime seemed to have twisted around him, preventing him from passing.

“Life lies within the gamble. Using my life as the stakes, I gamble against you. Whether or not you are willing, you must accept this gamble,” said Hu Feng indifferently.

Just at this moment, the die began to stop spinning. The number of dots at the top side kept changing until it finally stopped at five.

“How regretful. It wasn’t six.” Hu Feng couldn’t help being disappointed. “In the end, I was never able to see the legendary six points. My gambling arts aren’t good enough. I’ve shamed the ancestors.”

“What kind of damn thing is this? It’s just a heretical sorcery! Let’s have a real battle of spears and blades!” shouted the Alldevil Heavenwalker.

This die gave him the chills. It was an extremely dangerous existence, and he had no idea how to counter it.

The die slowly opened. But at the next moment, this divine item of the Gambling Heavenly Dao actually started to dissipate in midair.

“Hahaha, just like I said, it’s just some sorcery to scare people! You can die now!” The Alldevil Heavenwalker was first dumbfounded, but then he laughed and unleashed a punch at the die to fully break it.

BOOM!

The die exploded, but it wasn’t from the Alldevil Heavenwalker. It exploded on its own.

After it exploded, a figure slowly appeared in its midst. It started out illusory but gradually grew real. It was a giant devil ape.

The devil ape’s body was pitch-black with a bright luster. The power of its Blood Qi was absolutely terrifying.

“Heaven Reaching Devil Ape?! This lifeform can’t possibly appear in a lower realm!”

The Alldevil Heavenwalker jumped in fright. The god inside of him recognized the origin of this devil ape.

BOOM!

The devil ape then unleashed a punch, sending the Alldevil Heavenwalker flying. He almost coughed up blood.

It roared, and an image of the scholarly Hu Feng appeared on its forehead. As for Hu Feng’s true body, it had strangely vanished. His Blood Qi and Spiritual Strength were both gone, and his aura had become one with this terrifying devil ape.

BOOM!

The devil ape stepped through the air, causing heaven and earth to crumble. It shot toward the Alldevil Heavenwalker like a black shooting star.

Seeing this scene, the Alldevil Heavenwalker was shocked and infuriated. This Heaven Reaching Devil Ape was a lifeform from the higher plane. Its bloodline wasn’t pure, but in the lower plane, its power was astonishing.

Even in his demigod state, it was extremely difficult for the Alldevil Heavenwalker to fight this devil ape. Furthermore, Hu Feng was controlling it, giving it plenty of combat experience. Hence, the Alldevil Heavenwalker wouldn’t be able to handle it the same way he had handled Little Snow.

The most shocking thing though was that the die had rolled a five. If it had been a six, he didn’t know what kind of terrifying existence would have come out.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker was blocked by the devil ape, while the Nine-Headed Lion was being chased down wretchedly. If it weren’t for Little Snow being unable to control its new power, the Nine-Headed Lion would have long since been killed. But the latter was only able to barely hold on.

The only one left was Ye Ming. He was pressing forward against the blockade of the Dragonblood Legion and the apex experts of the Martial Heaven Continent.

The High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, Ma Ruyun, the old man, and the other seniors were all fighting him. At the same time, Mo Nian, Wilde, Ye Zhiqiu, Zi Yan, and the other members of the junior generation were launching their strongest attacks at him. But in his demigod state, they were unable to stop him. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Ming’s expression was growing more and more unsightly. At some point, an expression of terror appeared in his eyes.

“No!”

Ye Ming let out a cry of despair. His flesh suddenly split open, and his body was exploding inside of him. After that, Ye Ming’s original aura and spiritual fluctuations were erased.

Suddenly, divine energy burst out of Ye Ming, blowing away the surrounding experts. He instantly created a giant open space on the battlefield around himself.

“Useless thing, such a useless immortal sprout can be destroyed. I’m not going to tie myself down. Let me personally destroy this world.”

Ye Ming’s voice was no longer his own voice. It was icy, dark, and bloodthirsty. The current him was no longer a demigod, but a full god.
