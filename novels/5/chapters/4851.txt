Chapter 4840 Gao Jianli

“Sect Master.”

Within a private room, the vice sect master of the Violet Palace Sect respectfully bowed before a figure seated before him.

The seated figure, massive in stature even while seated, had his back to the vice sect master. This imposing individual was none other than the sect master of the Violet Palace Sect, Gao Jianli—a major figure whose footsteps shook Devil Fall City.

Gao Jianli didn’t turn back. With a voice as heavy as a dragon, he spat out a single word. “Speak.”

If an ordinary Divine Venerate heard him speak, their ears would rupture.

“I tested him. This Long Chen is very troublesome. I wasn’t even able to say what I wanted to say before he sealed off my chances. I even feel like all my plans have been seen through by him. I don’t think the Violet Palace Sect will be able to use him,” sighed the vice palace master.

“Even you were unable to win him over, so it seems he really isn’t ordinary. No wonder he could become the High Firmament Academy’s youngest branch dean. Speaking of which, is there more detailed information on him?” asked Gao Jianli.

“For now, we only have this much. When Long Chen came out of the gate to the ninth heaven, he killed countless experts, including a heavenly genius of the Celestial race. He then slew a Mortal Saint, an Earth Saint, and had a brief clash with a Heaven Saint. However, his father appeared at that time, so Long Chen did not reveal his full power. Thus, we cannot determine just how strong he is.”

“Didn’t you personally witness his battle with Hu Yifei? Could you not tell?” asked Gao Jianli with a hint of contempt.

“I’m ashamed to say that Long Chen is truly powerful and did not reveal his true power until the end. All he showed was that he possessed dragon blood power and was capable of using their divine abilities. However, I couldn't discern the specific dragon lineage or divine abilities,” the vice palace master responded with a hint of helplessness.

“Fine. Cao Shaoqing is much stronger than Hu Yifei, so Long Chen will go all-out against him. When the time comes, we’ll naturally know how strong he is. However, we must first make a decision. What do you think?” Only now did Gao Jianli turn his head back.

If someone else saw Gao Jianli’s face for the first time, they would likely scream in shock. Half of his face was devoid of flesh and blood, exposing only bone. His remaining eye gleamed with a fierce light, adding to his intimidating presence.

The vice palace master carefully said, “If Long Chen cannot be persuaded to join the Violet Palace Sect, it would be better to inform the Brahma Pill Valley sooner. Delay may result in someone else reporting him first, leaving us with leftovers. However, this action could potentially offend the city lord. I leave this decision in your hands.”

Gao Jianli’s single eye flickered as he coldly snorted, “Hmph, Xing Wujiang has been in his position for too long. It’s time for him to abdicate. He doesn’t say anything only because he can’t do anything to us. Sooner or later, he will be forced to abdicate. Then the real problem will be which of us from the four great families can take his place. Send someone to inform the other three great families. If Long Chen can’t be used by us, it would be better for us to get this favor. Whoever obtains the support of the Brahma Pill Valley will definitely have a higher chance of becoming the city lord. That is the important point.”

“Alright. Then I’ll arrange it right now.”

“Other than that, inform our peak geniuses to come out and watch the fight. Even if they’re in seclusion, call them out.”

“Yes.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The vice palace master turned and left.

Once he was gone, Gao Jianli slowly stood up, his crooked mouth curling up into a sinister sneer.

“The number one academy beneath the heavens? Hmph, are you still lost in your former glory? How laughable.”

...

“Big Brother Long Chen, this is the Feather Spirit race’s territory. Welcome!”

When Long Chen and Mo Nian arrived before a large mountain, Yu Tong smiled and relaxed, gesturing for them to enter.

Long Chen looked ahead to see a mountain surrounded by mist and cloud. He couldn’t see any buildings on it, but within the swirling mist, he saw giant trees climbing to the heavens, with thick vines wrapped around them like dragons. This place was filled with a spiritual air.

Two enormous willows were twining around each other in front of the mountain, forming a giant gate. Above the willow branches were two giant, crossed feathered arrows that gave off a powerful pressure.

“The needle in the cotton? If people don’t offend me, I won’t offend them?” Long Chen couldn’t help smiling upon seeing those arrows.

Yu Fei looked at Long Chen worshipfully. “Big Brother Long Chen, you’re sharp! Yes, the Feather Spirit race is the protector of the Butterfly Spirit race, and while we are kind, we will not let ourselves be bullied. Just like cotton, if you are warm to us, we will treat you warmly. If you try to crush us, the needles in the cotton will stab you.”

Yu Fei and Yu Tong had already become Long Chen’s worshipers. Fortunately, they also treated Mo Nian very enthusiastically, or Mo Nian would definitely take a bite out of Long Chen.

“How fortuitous. I’ve never dreamed of being able to come to the Feather Spirit Sacred Mountain,” said Lu Ziqiong, sighing.

The Feather Spirit Sacred Mountain was located within Devil Fall City, but it was also the holy land of the Feather Spirit race, so outsiders were not permitted to get close to it. Even the Violet Palace Sect’s people couldn’t come here.

Just as Yu Fei said, the Feather Spirit race might be kind, but they were not so easy to bully. If anyone dared to injure one of them, the bully would face bloody vengeance.

Most of the Feather Spirit race’s experts were hidden within the Feather Spirit Sacred Mountain, rarely venturing out. Hence, they were extremely mysterious, and not many people were willing to provoke them.

Despite their reclusive nature, the Feather Spirit race was generally benevolent. They tolerated verbal insults without anger as long as there was no physical aggression. However, because of this, the disciples of the Iron Blood Gate had felt emboldened to speak with their filthy mouths.

When Long Chen and the others walked before those giant willows, the willows seemed to sense something and slowly parted, their branches swaying in the breeze and divine light sprinkling down from them.

“Heavens, the guardian willows are greeting us! Big Brother Long Chen, that is the highest form of greeting in our Feather Spirit race!” exclaimed Yu Tong and Yu Fei. This was their first time seeing this phenomenon.

The willow leaves weaved into a carpet with rippling divine light, leading up to the mountain. It was Long Chen’s first time being welcomed in such a grand manner, and it caught him a bit off-guard.

“Big Brother Long Chen, Big Brother Mo Nian, sisters, please come.” Yu Tong laughed delightedly, dragging Long Chen and Mo Nian up the path, while Yu Fei brought Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu behind her.

When their feet stepped on the willow leaves, Long Chen felt as if his soul had gone through a cleansing. All his accumulated negative emotions were slowly being washed away, and he felt relaxed.

When they reached the waist of the mountain, a beautiful woman with a bow on her back and her hair in a high bun appeared before Long Chen.

Yu Tong and Yu Fei immediately bowed when they saw her.

“Race Leader!”
