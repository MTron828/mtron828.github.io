Chapter 4533 Turning the Tides

“Protect Long Chen!”

When the golden monkeys charged toward Long Chen, Feng You shouted her orders. At the same time, countless other desolate beasts also concentrated on Long Chen’s side.

Even though the desolate beasts weren’t very bright, these monkeys managed to notice Long Chen, so they immediately gave the order to eliminate him.

Whether it was the desolate beast race or the mixed beast race, they started to gather around Long Chen. The surroundings grew even more chaotic.

“Tch, so what if you notice me?” Long Chen curled his lips and launched another arrow.

After that, Long Chen’s arrow missed and struck the buttocks of a Saint, causing it to shout. However, it wasn’t fatal.

“It’s a pity I don’t have Guo Ran’s skill. Otherwise, they’d be wailing in anguish while holding their butt!” Long Chen sighed to himself.

Although Long Chen had played with bows and crossbows before, he had never spent that much time on them. As a result, his shooting technique was rather simple. Moreover, he couldn’t lock onto them because they would sense it and be able to dodge it.

Long Chen’s ability to hit those targets before wasn’t solely due to his exceptional archery skills but rather because the targets were relatively large, and they were caught off-guard. That was why he had had an almost one-hundred percent hit rate.

Now that they had noticed him and were on guard, Long Chen found it challenging to strike them. Despite making multiple attempts, he either missed his target or the enemies managed to evade his arrows.

“If hidden arrows don’t work, we’ll do it openly!” Long Chen shouted angrily. The crossbow in his hands suddenly shook, becoming hundreds of meters long, resembling a mountain.

This was the original form of this crossbow and also its strongest state. At the start of the combat, Guo Ran would usually use it to pick out and kill the strongest opponents. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, in this state, Guo Ran couldn’t move it because of its immense weight. He had to construct a platform first before he could use it.

Fortunately, this weight was not an issue for Long Chen, but he still needed to use two hands to maintain its stability.

BOOM!

An arrow, three times thicker than a human waist, shot through the air and gave rise to a tornado. With an ear-piercing whistle, it barely left the crossbow and already collided with a huge desolate beast, triggering a powerful explosion.

The immense power of the arrow directly blasted the desolate beast’s mouth apart, causing flesh and blood to fly through the air. As the desolate beast was in immense pain, a Saint from the mixed beast grasped the opportunity to kill it.

Long Chen repeatedly shot arrows, and every time, his arms would almost go numb from the impact. This weapon wasn’t designed for such use, and even Guo Ran needed a platform to deploy it effectively.

Despite the substantial backlash, the killing power was remarkable. The ear-piercing whistle that was unleashed when it left the crossbow was especially invigorating and satisfying.

Even with his average archery skills, Long Chen couldn’t miss as the desolate beasts were so huge. Even if he didn’t strike it in a vital part, it was enough.

After all, the mixed beast race’s experts were on his side, so every arrow he shot would create an opportunity for them to slay another target. Just like that, they forced the desolate beasts further and further back.

This battle started to develop with Long Chen at the center, and they slew the desolate beast race’s top experts one by one. Because of him, the mixed beast race quickly took an absolute upper hand.

Long Chen also noticed that despite attacking with a huge number, the desolate beast race’s experts were a far cry from the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s experts in terms of individual power.

The mixed beast race had only been at a disadvantage due to being caught off guard and not fully recovered from their last battle. However, by relying on this giant crossbow, Long Chen directly reversed the tides. Even though weariness crept in on the mixed beast race’s side, their fighting spirit still burned strongly. So, in no time, the ground was littered with the corpses of desolate beasts.

“Careful!” shouted a mixed beast race expert who had been cooperating with Long Chen.

Amid Long Chen’s joyful shooting, a monkey cry suddenly echoed behind him, and a three-foot-tall creature covered in golden fur lunged toward him with a foot-long bone blade. The monkey’s scarlet eyes, exposed canine teeth, and sinisterly twisted face created an eerie sight as the bone blade effortlessly knocked aside all obstacles between it and Long Chen.

To Long Chen’s surprise, this seemingly unremarkable monkey had an exceptionally powerful aura. It was most likely the strongest existence of their junior generation aside from the two monkeys next to Feng You.

Seeing some runes flowing like dripping poison from the bone blade, Long Chen knew that it was anything but ordinary. In a swift move, Long Chen dodged backward, using his crossbow to parry the attack. But unexpectedly, the bone blade actually broke off a piece of the crossbow. This blade was, in fact, on par with Saint items in terms of sharpness.

After missing its first attack, the small monkey rolled through the air, nimbly avoiding the crossbow. It then repositioned itself and thrust its blade toward Long Chen’s throat with extreme speed.

On the other hand, Long Chen didn’t even look at its second attack after dodging the first one. He simply threw some red powder at the monkey’s eyes.

As the powder covered its eyes, the monkey screamed. Clenching its eyes, it randomly swung the bone blade around.

Following that, the mixed beast race’s experts who rushed over to save Long Chen immediately underwent coughing fits. A piercing stench assaulted their senses, accompanied by a sharp pain in their noses, akin to millions of ants crawling inside. It was both painful and itchy, so they hastily retreated.

“Tch, I actually thought they were strong. But one handful of spicy flower powder was enough to repel them,” sneered Long Chen.

This powder was actually a Saint medicinal ingredient harvested from the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s territory. Its pollen was exceptionally spicy and had the capability to corrode anyone made of flesh and blood, even igniting grass and wood. Most terrifying of all, it wasn't poison, making it not easily detectable.

The monkey was so close to Long Chen that the pollen directly hit its eyes, causing so much pain that it almost collapsed. The agony it experienced was even more excruciating than being struck by millions of blades.

“Scram!”

Long Chen grabbed the crossbow and swung it at the blinded golden monkey. With its spiritual perception in chaos, it couldn’t dodge and was launched into the midst of the mixed beast race, where countless blades instantly devoured it.
