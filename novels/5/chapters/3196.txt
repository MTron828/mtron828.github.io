Chapter 3185 The Academy’s Old Monsters

The sacred dragon might wreaked havoc, destroying two barriers. It only stopped at the third barrier.

“This child Long Chen’s luck is heaven-defying. The master of this golden dragon scale actually possesses an incredibly noble bloodline. They probably have a huge background,” said Bai Letian.

“This sacred might destroys all laws. The master of that dragon scale has to be an amazing figure. It seems that even the Huayun Trading Company can misjudge. They couldn’t see through the power concealed in the dragon scale,” said Bai Shishi’s mother.

The Huayun Trading Company had their own master appraisers, and their eyes were so sharp that it was almost unbelievable. However, they hadn’t noticed just how extraordinary this dragon scale was.

If they had known that this dragon scale possessed such a terrifying sacred might, its value was not something that the Nine Prefecture Convention’s funds would be capable of purchasing.

“It’s not the fault of the Huayun Trading Company. A true dragon’s might cannot be tested, or it will be considered a provocation. It will either kill them or kill itself. Hence, they were only able to judge its value based on its age, marks, and accumulated history,” said Bai Letian.

Space was still collapsing around Long Chen, and the dragon roar continued to ring out. A single barrier would have been unable to prevent that roar from being transmitted out.

Fortunately, Bai Xiaole’s mother had added an additional two barriers. Otherwise, if the sound spread, it might cause widespread panic.

Long Chen’s body was covered in golden dragon scales. His aura was astonishing. He was like a heavenly deity in golden armor and appeared incredibly domineering.

Those elders silently examined Long Chen for a long while before one of them said, “Master sweeper has actually chosen him, so there’s no need for us to come out. We trust in the master sweeper’s vision. However, has the opportunity really ripened this time? It seems that there’s still some time until it reaches maturity.”

“Immortal Elder is correct. However, this matter is so big that there cannot be the slightest carelessness. Do you have any pointers?” asked Bai Letian. He was extremely courteous. Despite being the dean, he still revered these old fellows because they were his seniors. They had made great contributions to the High Firmament Academy.

“There are no pointers. The High Firmament Academy has countless seniors like Zhao Tianlan who sacrificed their lives for this world’s peace. There are so many heroes who lost their lives fighting against the devil sea. If a person lacks respect and gratitude, they are actually the most evil lifeforms in this world. Long times of peace will make people forget about everything that the High Firmament Academy has done for the Heavenly Swell Domain. Now they’re even returning the name to the Dao Dawn Domain, showing that they lack any gratitude to the High Firmament Academy. Forgetting history is a betrayal. If the master sweeper thinks that Long Chen is our chance, then we can try it. After all, the Heavenly Daos are unclear, and the flow of fate is not obvious. Our old eyes still cannot see the omens of great changes in the world, so we don’t dare to say anything for sure, nor do we dare to bet the fate of the High Firmament Academy on it,” said the elder. “We old timers have been in seclusion for so long. Our eyes are no longer capable of seeing everything. Sometimes, the flapping of a single butterfly wing can cause a tornado in another place. Whether or not the immortal world will change because of a nine star heir has yet to be decided; we need to continue observing. Long Chen can be raised. We will observe the changes in the Heavenly Daos before deciding on the attitude of the High Firmament Academy. However, a nine star heir is a double-sided sword that’s easy to lose control of. It would be best if you take note of the scale and not let him learn too many of those ancient secrets. It’s not good for him. After all, the heads of the nine star heirs are even more rigid and stubborn than us old timers. They don’t know how to bend at all.”

“Immortal Elders, don’t worry. This Long Chen is different from normal nine star heirs. We will raise him properly. However, paper is unable to stop gunpowder. If the day comes that Long Chen’s status is exposed, the academy’s attitude will be…?” asked the dean.

“If he isn’t the destined one, even we won’t be able to protect him. We can only let him destroy himself. If he is the destined one, the High Firmament Academy will bet everything on him,” answered that elder.

“Understood.” The dean nodded.

That elder nodded in reply, and he and the other elders vanished, leaving behind only Bai Letian, Bai Zhantang, and his wives.

“Dad, if Long Chen isn’t the destined one, are we really going to cast him aside so heartlessly?” asked Bai Zhantang. Although Bai Shishi’s mother was secretly pinching him, he still asked this question directly.

“What do you think?” asked Bai Letian.

“That’s cruel. He is a disciple of our academy and has entrusted his fate to us. Is abandoning him midway something a human can do?” raged Bai Zhantang.

“Zhantang…!”

His wives’ expressions both changed. These words were too far. How could he speak this way to his father?

“You shouldn’t ask me about this. You should ask the master sweeper,” said Bai Letian, completely disregarding the rudeness of his son.

“Hey-!”

Just as Bai Zhantang was about to pursue this topic, two people dragged him back with all their might.

“You fool, what is there to ask about such a thing? When it comes to major powers, an individual’s power is tiny. The High Firmament Academy has been enduring all this time, for what? This head of yours can only be covered with weeds for the rest of this lifetime. Get back here.” Both of his wives dragged him away.

In a corner of the High Firmament Academy, an elder with a broom and turbid eyes stared in a certain direction. That direction was where Long Chen was refining the dragon scale.

“It bound its fate to that child. It can’t be wrong. The immortal world will change because of him. We are nothing more than spectators.”

This old sweeping elder smiled. After that, he continued sweeping. The fallen leaves blew in the wind, erasing his previous efforts, but he very patiently started sweeping from the start again. His rhythm didn’t change at all.

However, just then, he swept out a fragment of a broken blade from the cracks between the bricks. This fragment was still very sharp and left a cut in the bricks. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

His sweeping came to a stop. Staring at the broken fragment and the bricks, he picked up the fragment and shook his head.

“It seems that some uninvited guests are coming.”

Just a moment afterward, the alarm sounded. It was the alarm for an enemy attack. However, the elder acted as if he hadn’t heard anything and continued sweeping.
