Chapter 2555 Ape King Roars at the Nine Heavens

The flame lotus exploded and flames ignited the world. After that, countless runes appeared in the air, burning.

“The laws of the Heavenly Daos can also be ignited? What kind of flame is this?” Startled cries rang out.

The laws of flames were contained within the laws of the Heavenly Daos. In other words, they were under restrictions. However, the laws of the Heavenly Daos around Ye Liangchen were now burning.

“The flames of this world cannot possibly burn the laws. The only possibility then… is that these flames come from a different world,” guessed one expert.

The flames unfurled, filling the air. Within those flames, they saw a figure rapidly retreating. It was Ye Liangchen.

Ye Liangchen had shattered the World Extermination Flame Lotus, but he himself was blown back by its explosive power. At this moment, his right foot was covered in flames, which only slowly extinguished after a few seconds.

He snorted. “So you have a few tricks. These flames aren’t bad, but they can’t do anything to me.”

The stars behind Ye Liangchen revolved. It was as if he existed within the cosmos. As the river of stars flowed, limitless energy flowed toward him.

With this power, he could suppress the karmic hell flames that could otherwise burn any other expert. Hence, it could be seen that Ye Liangchen’s wild arrogance had true power to back it up. Standing there, the laws of the Heavenly Daos prostrated themselves toward him.

“Stars Illuminate the Cosmos. This is a manifestation from the immortal era, one that has reached the divine rankings and is ranked thirty-sixth. I didn’t expect that I would get to see such a manifestation in my lifetime,” sighed Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“Senior, what is so amazing about this manifestation?” asked Qu Jianying. Everyone else’s ears perked up.

“In truth, there are many starry manifestations but only one amongst the divine rankings. However, it is split into two names. One is called Stars Illuminate the Cosmos, while the other is called Stars Move the Cosmos. The former refers to laws, the latter refers to power. However, these are just legends passed down from that time. We’ll only know the truth if we keep watching,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“Senior’s knowledge is admirable.” Everyone sighed inside. Daoist Heavenly Feather was truly a god-like existence. It was as if there was nothing in this world that she didn’t know.

Most curious of all, the rumors had been that Daoist Heavenly Feather’s cultivation base was only at the peak of Netherpassage. However, now that more people had reached that realm, they were still unable to sense her cultivation base.

Her aura had always been flat, as if she was a mortal who didn’t know how to cultivate. Yet, it also felt like that of a supreme expert who had comprehended, life, death, and Samsara. It was impossible to see through her.

However, whatever her cultivation base was, her position, character, and learning had always been extremely admirable and respectable. That was why the Dongfang family head’s provocation toward her had drawn the ire of so many people.

With this explanation from Daoist Heavenly Feather, everyone stared closely at the two people in the sky. A battle on this level was something that might not occur once in many generations, so they had to watch closely. Those memories would be a precious experience for their descendants.

Two people stood in the air, one with a river of stars behind him and the other with a divine ring. Both of them were blazing with killing intent.

“Ye Liangchen, you stole the lead this time, but if you can’t handle him within an incense stick’s worth of time, I will have to make my move,” said Jiang Wuchen coldly.

He was one step slower than Ye Liangchen, but considering his status, there was no way he would attack now. Two Sovereign sprouts attacking the same person? No matter how that was explained, it would be considered a loss of face. He would then be turned into a laughingstock of the divine families.

He couldn’t interfere. Thus, he gave Ye Liangchen a warning.

“An incense stick’s worth of time? Are you looking down on me or overestimating him? If I wanted to kill him, it wouldn’t take the slightest effort-”

Ye Liangchen was suddenly interrupted by a hand reaching out of the void. It swung in a beautiful arc to strike his arrogant face.

Immediately, Ye Liangchen’s face distorted from the slap. The light of the stars around his face was shattered, and he shot back along with a sharp shriek, slamming into the ground.

A large hole appeared in the ground, and giant cracks spread far into the distance. Only now did Long Chen’s figure reappear.

“I’ve had enough of your unchanging act. Let’s not waste words. Whoever wants to kill me can come at me together. When have I ever been afraid of anyone?” shouted Long Chen, his voice filled with unquestionable domineeringness.

Everyone was dumbfounded by this sudden turn of events. One moment, Ye Liangchen had appeared exceptionally domineering, but in the next instant, he was sent flying by a slap to the face.

Furthermore, Long Chen had truly been impossibly fast. His movement looked like teleportation as there wasn’t the slightest ripple in space whatsoever.

Teleportation was just a saying for a kind of instant transportation. In the minds of most people, teleportation was the result of pushing speed to the pinnacle, making it look like instant movement.

However, that was not entirely true. Just like transportation formations, teleportation required folding the world. By finding the correct spatial node and accurately calculating the positions, it was possible to shuttle through space. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The difference was that no matter how fast you were, you had to accumulate energy. That would give a sign to your opponent that you were about to make a move.

On the other hand, true teleportation was said to only be possible for those above Netherpassage. In the Heaven Merging realm, perhaps some people could come into contact with the profundities of space.

The tortoise elder that had launched a sneak attack at Long Chen had used a kind of teleportation art to catch Long Chen off guard. However, at that time, people hadn’t had time to be shocked by that technique before he was killed by Long Chen. The death of a Heaven Merging expert had caused people to overlook his teleportation technique.

Therefore, now that Long Chen was also using a teleportation technique to strike Ye Liangchen, everyone was dumbfounded.

After that, Long Chen vanished once more, reappearing in front of Jiang Wuchen. He smoothly slapped Jiang Wuchen across the face as well, sending him flying.

“What?!”

Long Chen had slapped the faces of two Sovereign sprouts. He was truly heaven-defying.

Because Long Chen’s speed was so fast, he appeared like a phantom, and even two Sovereign sprouts couldn’t dodge his slaps.

“How can there be teleportation within the Netherpassage realm?” demanded an elder from the neutral faction, stunned. He was an elder who had reached the level of being called a living fossil. His cultivation base had also reached the Heaven Merging realm. However, it was because he had reached this realm that he was so shocked.

Even amongst those who could reach the Heaven Merging realm, not everyone could comprehend a teleportation art. This elder knew that the tortoise elder’s teleportation art was the result of a teleportation art merging with his innate divine ability. It was not a pure teleportation art.

However, what Long Chen was using was clearly a pure teleportation art. If someone as powerful as this elder could only grasp the slightest superficial understanding of such a technique, how could Long Chen freely use it? That was unbelievable.

“The Heaven Merging realm refers to becoming one with the Heavenly Daos. At that level, you must be able to control space and spatial laws as they are part of the Heavenly Daos. However, that does not mean that you must wait until the Heaven Merging realm to control space. As long as you possess a domain you are in absolute control of, you can do the same,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

After hearing this, the elder bowed toward Daoist Heavenly Feather. “Many thanks for clearing up the confusion, this junior is too foolish. Even within my manifestation domain, I cannot accomplish teleportation.”

The elder was actually calling himself a junior in front of Daoist Heavenly Feather. Hence, the entire scene looked like an old man bowing toward a young woman.

Daoist Heavenly Feather shook her head. “Although the world of a manifestation can be considered a kind of domain, a manifestation is still a manifestation. It is not a true world as the laws inside are incomplete. Furthermore, when it is unleashed, it will clash with the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent. Naturally, there is no way to be in complete control of the spatial laws to teleport. What Long Chen is using to teleport is not his manifestation but his own power.”

After that, the elder suddenly came to a realization and bowed deeply toward Daoist Heavenly Feather to express his thanks.

BOOM!

The earth exploded, and two figures charged toward Long Chen at the same time.

“I’ll slaughter you!”

Both Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen roared at Long Chen. At the same time, Jiang Wuchen summoned his manifestation, and a berserk roar rang out as the world darkened.

Jiang Wuchen’s manifestation was a towering black ape that beat its chest with its fist, unleashing a violent roar.

With every beat of its chest, the world shuddered. Every beat made people feel like their own hearts would beat out of their chests.

“Another manifestation of the immortal era, Ape King Roars at the Nine Heavens, ranked thirty-third on the divine manifestation rankings,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Everyone was startled. Jiang Wuchen’s manifestation was ranked even higher than Ye Liangchen’s. Could he be even stronger than Ye Liangchen?

As two Sovereign sprouts attacked Long Chen at the same time, their power caused the world to change color. Two manifestations on the level of the divine rankings raged.

Right now, all the experts present had retreated, afraid of being drawn into this terrifying current.

The Dragonblood warriors stood in the air, clenching their fists. They knew that their boss was giving a display of power by challenging two Sovereign sprouts at once.

Long Chen had said that the current Dragonblood Legion had been forced to the point of no return. If they wanted to survive, they had to launch a counterattack. They had to forcibly open a path of living within the chaotic tide.

Hence, the Dragonblood warriors’ blood had long since started boiling. They were prepared for a huge battle.

As their leader, Long Chen couldn’t retreat. Facing two Sovereign sprouts, he spread his hands.

BOOM!

The three figures clashed together at the same time, unleashing an explosion of divine light.
