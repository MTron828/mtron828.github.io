Chapter 4529 Anger To Death

“Stop that! You’ll hurt your mouth even more!” Seeing the red-haired man who called himself Xie Fei cough up blood, Long Chen hastily spoke up out of concern.

Long Chen had torn Xie Fei’s mouth as he had pulled it from both sides. After all, Xie Fei’s arrogant mouth was truly dislikable.

However, his mouth was unexpectedly sturdy. Long Chen had stretched it wide in an attempt to break it, but it didn't give way completely, showing only some small tears.

Xie Fei was so enraged that he coughed up blood, some of which originated from his wounds, giving the appearance as if his cheeks were oozing blood. After that, the droplets of blood were like glue, creating a shocking yet comical scene. Onlookers couldn’t help but stare at it, and one heavenly genius stared too long at Xie Fei’s face, causing Xie Fei to kill him due to his fury and embarrassment.

“Brat, report your name!” roared Xie Fei.

Long Chen smiled, flicking some dust off his robes. He said, “I bear the surname Long, with the name Chen. Among my friends, I’m Boss Long San. When Boss Long San appears, the earth roars and the heavens howl. When Boss Long San leaves, ghosts sob and gods weep. Child, it’s not good to be so arrogant at such a young age. Of course, being arrogant isn’t wrong, but surpassing Boss Long San in arrogance is impossible because the ceiling for arrogance is precisely Boss Long San. Just take a look at what happened when you tried to cross that ceiling! I’m sure it doesn’t feel good being slapped in the face.”

“You...”

Xie Fei gritted his teeth so hard that they creaked; his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. Never in his life had he suffered such embarrassment. Right now, his eyes burned with a scarlet intensity, and he was on the brink of insanity.

On the other hand, seeing Long Chen drive Xie Fei to the point of insanity, the mixed beast race’s people felt a deep satisfaction. After all, their enmities toward the Corrupt path ran deep, carved deep into their very bones.

“Don’t be like that. If you have guts, let’s fight one-on-one right now. I won’t bully you. How about I only use one arm?” suggested Long Chen, putting one hand behind his back.

Hearing this, Xie Fei felt even more incensed. He was still covered in wounds from his fight against Feng You. How could this shameless fellow challenge him now?

“If you feel like it’s unfair, I’ll also bind my mouth,” provoked Long Chen.

Xie Fei felt so much rage that he started to shake. Long Chen’s provoking art had practically reached the pinnacle of this world. He made Xie Fei feel like he was going crazy, but there was nothing he could do.

“You damn ant, once I recover my full strength, I’ll crush you with a single hand!” roared Xie Fei.

In Xie Fei’s eyes, although Long Chen was strong, Long Chen was not even close to a match for him. If it weren’t for that strange bronze cauldron, Xie Fei was confident in slaying him in just three moves.

“Tch, who doesn’t know how to talk big? Based on what you said, I’ll hereby declare that I am still hiding my true power, and if I were to stop holding back, I could choke you to death with my piss. Do you believe what I said?” exclaimed Long Chen disdainfully.

A burst of laughter erupted from the mixed beast race’s experts. Part of it was in response to Long Chen’s words, but another part was their desire to enrage Xie Fei further. Hopefully, they could make him simply die from anger.

Xie Fei shook violently and clenched his fists tightly. Seeing this, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s sect master hastily sneered, “Brat, you’re too ignorant. Do you know the consequences of provoking my Heavenly Corrupt Sect?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Old fogey, you’re too stupid. Do you know what kind of retribution awaits you after enraging Boss Long San?” Long Chen returned the sect master’s words with his own twist.

This time, even Feng You couldn’t help but laugh. She had never seen such an interesting person before.

In her mind, despite not being that powerful, Long Chen consistently demonstrated an uncanny ability to evade danger at the right moments. Furthermore, his words cut through the air like sharp blades, so she felt incredibly satisfied hearing him curse her mortal enemies.

She had never seen anyone like Long Chen who would tear someone’s mouth and slap them in the face. Let alone seeing such a thing, she had never even heard of it before. Her eyes had been opened to the world today.

The sect master’s expression darkened. Now, he knew that there was no use talking with this brat. Turning to his Sage King opponent, he coldly remarked, “I didn’t expect the prideful mixed beast race to beg an invader for help. Hehe, how interesting.”

The mixed beast race’s Sage King was enraged to hear that, but the Corrupt sect master already led his people away, not giving him any chance to respond.

“Hey, hey, that brother called Xie Fei, once you go back, make sure to properly recover and take care of your skin! That way, it will feel a bit better the next time I slap it!” shouted Long Chen.

“You fucking ***** ****** *****...”

The next master of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect was hurling out curses like a vixen on the streets. Having been pushed to the brink by Long Chen, he didn’t even care about his face anymore. If he didn’t curse, he felt like he would explode.

At first, the mixed beast race’s people were stunned by this, but they directly burst into laughter. To be able to anger the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s peak genius into this state was quite a great feat.

The sect master hastily dragged Xie Fei away, leading the rest of his troops in a hasty retreat. As the dust settled on the battlefield, it revealed a somber scene, with corpses littered across the ground.

After a brief pause, the mixed beast race’s experts started to go through the battlefield. They gathered their own people’s corpses but left the corpses of their enemies untouched.

“Little brother, thank you for helping. If it weren’t for you, my mixed beast race might have faced complete extinction.” The mixed beast race’s Sage King expressed his gratitude as he approached Long Chen.

“Truly, many thanks. I would have died at that bastard’s hands without you,” thanked Feng You as she also came over.

At this moment, the rest of the mixed beast race’s higher-ups and core elite disciples also came over to express their gratitude toward Long Chen.

“All of you are too courteous. I come from the outside world, and it just so happens that I was transported to the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s territory. Hmph, instead of greeting me nicely, they started hunting me down and shouting that they would torture me. Naturally, I’m not going to let them off so easily. Helping you was also helping myself,” replied Long Chen.

“You’re from the outside world?” Feng You was shocked. Hearing this, the others also shot over some strange looks.

“What? Don’t tell me you’re going to attack me for being an outsider!” Sensing their sudden mood change, Long Chen looked at them vigilantly.

“No, no! Our mixed beast race doesn’t reject outsiders. After all, the arrival of the outsiders signifies that a great era is about to come,” explained the Sage King.

“Oh, that’s good.”

Hearing that, Long Chen relaxed. It would be exhausting if, after getting help from him, they not only failed to express their gratitude but also wanted to harm him.

“That’s right, just now, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect has clearly lost. Why did you just let them leave instead of pursuing them to the end?” asked Long Chen.

The Sage King sighed, as if not knowing how exactly to respond. Feng You then said, “It’s a long story. Why don’t you come to our territory for a while to chat?”

Long Chen nodded. Just like that, he followed Feng You and the others away.
