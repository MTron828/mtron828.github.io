Chapter 4012 Heavenly Collapse Manifestation

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t move, but those two swords suddenly veered away from him and crashed into each other.

The two swords had appeared at almost the exact same time and had come from different directions, but a strange force suddenly changed their trajectory, causing them to clash in front of Long Chen and destroy each other.

“Why don’t you tell me now what kind of power this is?” asked the dragon expert.

Hearing this, Long Chen was stunned. He found that even with all the books that he had read, he was unable to explain this power.

Just as the dragon expert said, it was something between the power of the soul and mind. But it was a very vague concept.

This power had to have a source and a point to be unleashed from. But Long Chen was unable to find it.

Just then, another sword pierced toward him. Facing it, Long Chen suddenly formed hand seals, and a vortex appeared on his forehead.

That sword was then drawn into the vortex and crushed to smithereens.

“The source of the six spirits, the foundation of the six senses, the collection of the six feelings, merge two into one. Incorporeal but corporeal, tangible but intangible. Formless on the inside, controlling the six spirits. Tangible on the outside, controlling the six senses. Merge two into one, inner and outer. Feel the changes of the mysteries known only to the heavens, sense the cycle of the Six Daos. Heaven and earth in the palm of your hand, wrap your hand around the sun, moon, and stars…”

Suddenly, a mesmerizing mnemonic chant escaped Long Chen's lips, unbidden and beyond his control. The moment it happened, the world shifted and changed before his eyes.

The celestial dance unfolded as the stars above the nine heavens began to swirl, their cosmic choreography enthralling all who saw it. The sun and moon, once steadfast in their courses, now rocked in an otherworldly rhythm. As a result, day turned to night, and the once radiant sun and moon lost their light, casting the world into an eerie darkness.

But amidst this celestial upheaval, a wondrous sight unfolded. The stars, instead of being scattered, linked together in such a mesmerizing display, forming a celestial dragon that weaved its way above the very dome of the heavens.

In that instant, no matter which race and species, all creatures within the nine heavens and ten lands looked up at the starry sky.

Within the High Firmament Academy, countless disciples stared at the starry sky in terror, feeling like the heavens would collapse.

Meanwhile, an elder clad in hemp robes remained deeply engrossed in sweeping the ground, as though nothing else in the world held any significance to him but this simple task

Yet, as the stars began to shift in the night sky, he paused briefly. Behind his turbid eyes, there seemed to be a glimpse of the primal chaos essence that gave birth to all existence. It was then, when he saw the majestic manifestation of a dragon, that a faint smile slowly emerged on his ancient face. Without uttering a word, he lowered his head once more and resumed his sweeping.

“Heavenly manifestation covering the nine heavens! A peerless cultivation technique has been born.” Within endless darkness, a short-haired beautiful woman stared up at the sky, murmuring to herself.

She looked to be in her thirties. With her skintight black leather armor hugging her curves tightly, she was just like a leopard in the night.

Her hands clasped behind her back as she stood atop a cliff. A trace of shock appeared in her deep eyes.

This woman was the peerless assassin that caused countless experts in the nine heavens and ten lands to quiver, Ye Wusheng.

She was the master of the Shadow Sect and also Dong Mingyu’s master. She was a legendary existence in the nine heavens and ten lands.

“Oh?”

Suddenly, Ye Wusheng frowned. A touch of surprise appeared on her face. After a moment, she said, “Alert Mingyu. Her mission is starting.”

“Yes.”

A voice responded in the darkness. From start to end, the speaker never revealed themself.

…

“Hahaha!” The dragon expert laughed crazily, seemingly overwhelmed with excitement. “Good, good! Long Chen, I really didn’t misjudge you! My Dragon Soul Body Forging Art can finally be passed down, hahaha!”

Long Chen was still lost. What had just happened? He had spontaneously spouted a mnemonic that seemed to emerge from the depths of his mind, but even he wasn't certain of its origin or meaning.

“Senior, I don’t understand what you’re saying…”

“A cultivation technique can be passed down without words or diagrams, but it cannot be lacking a mnemonic. This mnemonic is like the path for people to follow. With this, others can walk the same path, and no matter how difficult the path is, people can still reach the end of it. As for myself, I simply flew over the path, so the actual process was vague to me, and I was naturally unable to explain the profound mysteries within it. But you are different. You walked to this point step by step, leaving footprints along the path. My path was not recognized by the Heavenly Daos, so I could not pass it down. But you comprehended the mnemonic yourself. That proves that the path can be walked. Furthermore, it has received the acknowledgment of heaven and earth. My Dragon Soul Body Forging Art can finally be passed down to future generations! Hahaha, Long Chen, do you know that in this lifetime, I feared nothing except the loss of my self-created peerless divine technique after my departure? It was this desire that fueled my determination to endure the humiliations of existence..” Suddenly, the dragon expert stopped speaking and switched topics. “In any case, you’ve accomplished my heart’s greatest desire. Long Chen, thank you!”

“Senior, don’t be like that. I’m the one who should be thanking you. You’re making me feel bad,” said Long Chen.

After learning a peerless divine technique, he was even being thanked? Despite not considering himself thin-skinned, he couldn't help but feel a sense of embarrassment.

“Hahaha!”

The dragon expert laughed with delight and gratification. It was its first time feeling such happiness in countless years.

“Keep going. Refining the will is the step that makes one a peak expert. After this trial, you will be completely transformed. I’m already brimming with anticipation to see you at full power with the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded and continued onward. When he reached the second step of the level, the tempo of the attacks increased, but he was fully capable of dealing with them.

Based on Long Chen’s understanding, the dragon expert’s so-called will was using thought as a guide. In fact, this was something that Long Chen had done back in the Phoenix Cry Empire. The qi gathering realm was the entry into cultivation, and it was to use the will to mobilize the circulation of true qi.

However, after cultivating for a while, people could easily sense the circulation of true qi, so they no longer thought of the will. They no longer needed it.

Long Chen didn’t expect that after his cultivation base had reached the Immortal King realm, he would actually return to the most basic thing of all. This could be considered returning to the essence.

When released outside, the will’s foundation lay in sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch, and perception. This kind of energy was truly profound, impossible to explain clearly.

Currently, it was like Long Chen was grasping tiny acupuncture needles with a numb hand. His movements were clearly clumsy and awkward, but having found the trick, Long Chen was no longer anxious. As time passed, his control got better.

While Long Chen walked forward, Huo Linger followed behind him, absorbing the flame energy here. She was like a dragon returning to the sea. This flame energy was an endless feast for her.

When Long Chen reached the sixth step, a ferocious beast suddenly attacked him.
