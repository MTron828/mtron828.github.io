Chapter 4819 Mo Nian’s Failure

“Mo Nian!”

Long Chen had never expected it to be Mo Nian. There he lay on the ground, with Bai Letian's hand on his chest. Bai Letian’s face looked quite grave. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Other than Bai Letian, the four Protector Elders, and Bai Zhantang and his wives were also present. Even people as experienced as them were appalled.

Mo Nian appeared black as coal as if soaked in ink. If not for his baby face, Long Chen wouldn’t have recognized him.

Most terrifying of all, his aura was almost gone, replaced by a sickening air of death. He looked like a corpse.

“What’s going on?!” Long Chen hastily rushed to Mo Nian’s side.

“According to a disciple’s report, he barely got here. After saying he wanted to see you, he collapsed,” replied Bai Zhantang.

“This is a terrifying corpse soul curse. My core energy cannot shake it, let alone draw it away.” After a while, Bai Letian slowly pulled his hand back and sighed.

To everyone’s surprise, Bai Letian’s hand was now pitch-black as well, looking like it was starting to wither.

“Dean!” Everyone cried out.

“I’m fine.” Bai Letian shook his head. Looking at his black hand, he explained, “This is a corpse soul curse, and it stems from the resentment of fallen spirits. Moreover, this resentment is firmly concentrated in this child’s body. I tried to take off a bit to test it, but I did not succeed.”

As Bai Letian said this, black qi flowed off his hand and returned to Mo Nian.

“Corpse soul curse...” Long Chen looked at Mo Nian speechlessly. This fellow had gotten up to his shady dealings.

“In order to expel the curse from his body, perhaps only the High Firmament Divine Sword’s faith energy can do it,” said Bai Letian.

“Dean, you absolutely cannot! The Brahma Divine Diagram is still a threat. If we use up that much karmic luck, we...” warned the Divine Lightning Elder.

Using faith energy for this was no joke, especially at this period. This might leave them open to a devastating attack.

“Everyone, don’t worry about this. I have a way.” After examining Mo Nian, Long Chen relaxed.

This was not the first time Long Chen saw Mo Nian infected by a corpse curse. Back then, Mo Nian had also been surrounded by death qi, and Long Chen had helped him deal with it.

Now, Long Chen didn’t know where this fellow had gone to provoke such a terrifying corpse soul curse. Most likely, Mo Nian immediately ran over to find Long Chen when he sensed something wrong.

After examining Mo Nian, Long Chen found that Mo Nian’s body was completely sealed by the curse. Outsiders were unable to penetrate it to sense his spiritual fluctuations.

However, this fellow knew that Long Chen would save him, so the moment Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength entered, he immediately felt the fire of Mo Nian’s soul.

Although the fire was extremely weak, it could still endure for a while. At the very least, there was no danger to his life for a short period.

“Do you have a method?” Bai Zhantang and the others were shocked. Even Bai Letian was powerless, but Long Chen had a way?

“Yes, I have experienced it before. It might be a bit thorny, but with some time and effort, it can still be cured,” answered Long Chen with a smile.

Bai Zhantang couldn’t help asking, “Just what did this fellow do to end up like this?”

“He’s an archaeologist. Um, I’ll explain it more when we have time. Saving him is more important.”

Long Chen picked up Mo Nian and bid them farewell. Finding a secluded place, he put Mo Nian in front of him.

Looking at his black face, Long Chen was speechless. “You really are a hard worker.”

It went without saying that when this fellow had gone underground to do more “archeology works”, he had encountered some terrifying existence. Even if one was a master graverobber, if they kept walking on the shore, they would get wet sooner or later. This time, Mo Nian had failed to fend off the curse of the graves.

Long Chen first fed him a soul-nourishing pill. An ordinary pill would be unable to penetrate the curse, but Long Chen’s pill was a peerless-grade treasure pill, so it could get through the curse and transmit its medicinal energy to Mo Nian’s soul. At the very least, it would guarantee that the fire of his soul wouldn’t extinguish.

However, the curse was so powerful that even a peerless-grade treasure pill could only transmit ten percent of its medicinal energy through the curse. Luckily, ten percent of a peerless-grade treasure pill was already extremely strong. Long Chen clearly sensed Mo Nian’s spiritual fluctuations growing a bit stronger.

When Long Chen pressed a hand on Mo Nian’s abdomen, the black qi around him instantly grew violent. A thunderous roar rang out in Long Chen’s ears, shaking his soul and stabbing his ears. After that, an icy chill covered his bones, causing his instincts to scream at him to pull his hand back.

“Damn, just what did you do?!” Long Chen was speechless. However, he couldn’t stop, or Mo Nian would die.

Despite knowing that he would have to pay an immense price, Long Chen clenched his teeth and drew the curse energy into him.

Bai Letian was unable to do this, but Long Chen could. That was due to Mo Nian instantly thinking of Long Chen the moment he was cursed. He knew that Long Chen was the only one who could save him, so he left a special seal for Long Chen.

Only Long Chen had the ability to draw this energy into him through this seal. As a result, Long Chen and Mo Nian’s auras instantly merged.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s clothes exploded as a berserk power entered him, causing him to feel like it would blow him apart.

“Divine ring!”

“Dragon Blood Battle Armor!”

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

His divine ring appeared, a sea of stars within it gushing violet qi. A dragon coiled around him. But despite this, the black qi quickly infiltrated his divine ring, causing the dragon to also turn black. The once-vibrant violet qi started to darken.

Long Chen’s body underwent a similar transformation, turning completely black. Apart from his eyes, which remained white, he was as dark as Mo Nian, with even his teeth turning black.

“Hey, what are you doing? This stuff isn’t good.” Evilmoon was disturbed and flew out, along with the Earth Cauldron. Neither of them wanted to be affected by this thing.

“Long Chen, this is very dangerous. If you cannot clean it up, your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone will be stained forever,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“I know. But what else can I do?”

Long Chen clenched his teeth. Despite knowing the danger, he had no other choice but to save Mo Nian. This fellow had really scammed him big time.

Suddenly, Long Chen pulled his hand off and slammed his hands together.

“Lei Linger, help me out!”
