Chapter 3647 Soaring Killing Intent

“AHH!”

Guo Ran had just fainted when he instantly woke up from the pain. He felt like every bone in his body was shattering and repairing. His soul was also in immense pain, as if it was being torn apart.

“I can’t, I can’t do this!” Guo Ran screamed, his eyes almost popping out from the pain.

“There’s no turning back now.” Xia Chen shook his head. Ignoring Guo Ran’s screams, he continued controlling the talismans, having the runes within Guo Ran’s body form a connection with the runes on the arm.

“I’m going to die, I’m really going to die!” screamed Guo Ran. His eyes were open, but he couldn’t see anything.

No matter how he screamed, Long Chen and Xia Chen ignored him. With Guo Ran’s current physical body, there was no way he would die.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

What kind of joke was that? Long Chen had split a portion of his true dragon essence blood with him. His physical body had reached a terrifying level.

Right now, Guo Ran was in the midst of switching out his skeleton. Although the power of his blood and flesh was strong, his skeleton was weaker. The injection of the dragon blood didn’t strengthen his bones enough.

Hence, if Guo Ran wanted this arm, he had to make his skeleton reach a level that could control it. Right now, Xia Chen was helping Guo Ran absorb the Supreme Bone’s power so that he could strengthen his whole skeleton. Just a single arm was useless. If he were to fight someone in that condition, in the first exchange, his Supreme Bone would fly off, and every other bone in his body would explode.

Guo Ran’s bones were constantly shattering and being reborn. Long Chen’s life energy was helping him recover.

Guo Ran couldn’t die, but he would wish he was dead. Who told him to choose this path? Since he had already chosen it, there was no going back.

Guo Ran was constantly screaming like a pig being slaughtered. It was unknown how many times he had fainted from the pain just to wake up from the pain again. In the end, he fully fainted and fell silent.

As for Long Chen and Xia Chen, they were covered in sweat. The Supreme Bone was finally connected to Guo Ran’s skeleton. His bones had broken and recovered hundreds of thousands of times before finally being able to match this Supreme Bone.

This Supreme Bone was actually rather long and not quite the same shape as the human race’s arm. But after merging, it grew to the same size and shape as Guo Ran’s original arm. Also, flesh started to grow on the bone. On the surface, it looked like a normal arm.

However, there were countless runes flowing within this arm. It was currently adapting to its new body, constantly changing its new home. Because of it, Guo Ran’s physical body was steadily growing stronger.

“Boss, this Supreme Bone has a heavy evil air. I’m worried that in the future…” said Xia Chen.

“It’s fine. Every person has a dark side. Although Guo Ran likes to show off, his inner heart is kind. He won’t be affected by this little bit of darkness. After all, this Supreme Bone was never fully awoken. It has a great deal of plasticity, and it won’t affect Guo Ran’s inner heart. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have let him keep it back then,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that, Xia Chen relaxed about this matter. When looking at the slumbering Guo Ran, he enviously said, “This fellow is so lazy. But now that he has a Supreme Bone, not even the heavens can contain him.”

With this Supreme Bone, Guo Ran would definitely be strutting around all day. A Supreme Bone was an unrivaled existence, and with the addition of his battle armor, there was simply no way to estimate Guo Ran’s combat power.

Furthermore, a Supreme Bone’s true power would only truly manifest in the Immortal King realm. Once this fellow became an Immortal King, he would definitely soar.

Seven days later, Guo Ran finally woke up, and when he saw his arm, he immediately grabbed it and felt it. Sensing the endless power within it, he almost didn’t believe it himself.

After that, he let out a simple punch in the air. A heaven-shaking explosion caused a mountain far off in the distance to crumble, and the ear-piercing sound didn’t fade for a long time.

“Boss, Xia Chen, punch me! Am I dreaming?!” shouted Guo Ran.

Long Chen immediately kicked him. This kick was actually filled with such power that Xia Chen jumped in shock. Guo Ran then cried out as he was sent flying.

He tumbled back like a shooting star, crashing through multiple mountains. He then vanished beyond the horizon, leaving only a line of dust. It was unknown just how far he was going.

“Boss, that was a bit vicious!” Xia Chen was gobsmacked. That kick was vicious. Was Long Chen not afraid of Guo Ran dying? It had to be known that Guo Ran didn’t have any defenses up at all.

Just then, Guo Ran came flying back in his Devil Dragon Battle Armor. “Hahaha!”

Guo Ran took off his armor and laughed. That powerful kick didn’t cause any damage at all. Even though he hadn’t been on guard, the Supreme Bone had automatically helped him block the majority of the impact. Other than that, even while smashing through those mountains, he wasn’t injured at all.

“I, Guo Ran, am unrivaled! Hahaha!”

Guo Ran raised his right arm. Right now, even he didn’t know just how much stronger he was. Thus, he had the urge to find a peak expert to fight with right now.

“Your arm is still getting used to you, so there’s a great deal of room for improvement. You should communicate with it more and learn how to control its power. Also, there are many runes on the arm that I couldn’t understand. You’ll need to study them yourself. Ah, your luck really is enviable,” said Xia Chen with a smile.

Although Xia Chen said that he was envious, he had a gratified smile. If Guo Ran got stronger, that made Xia Chen even happier than if he himself got stronger.

“Hehe, don’t worry, I’ll definitely study this! Just who am I? I am Guo Ran, the general of the Dragonblood Legion, a possessor of a Supreme Bone! Starting today, I will turn a new leaf!” declared Guo Ran proudly. He was almost incoherent.

“I wonder who was screaming for their parents just now, saying that he would die and wanted to give up?” Xia Chen curled his lips.

“Brother, are you my brother? If you’re my brother, then you should cheer me on, not drag me down!” said Guo Ran. Just thinking about his appearance before this made him feel embarrassed.

“Alright, don’t mess around. Guo Ran, you’ve just merged with the Supreme Bone. But since our time is rather limited, I’ll give you three days to get used to your new arm and power,” said Long Chen.

During the next three days, Long Chen personally trained Guo Ran, having him get used to his new power. As for Xia Chen, he took this opportunity to restore his power to its peak.

Three days were quickly over. Now, Xia Chen was at full power, and a sharp light was contained within his eyes. He had regained his old confidence.

As for Guo Ran, his confidence was completely inflated. With Long Chen’s training, he had reached an initial level of control over his Supreme Bone. Even without his battle armor, he was able to fight Long Chen evenly. It could be said that Guo Ran’s combat power had instantly soared dozens of times. If it wasn’t a fight to the death, even Long Chen wouldn’t dare to say that he could defeat the current Guo Ran. The power of a Supreme Bone was truly monstrous.

Once their preparations were complete, the three of them returned to their original location, their killing intent soaring. Their goal was to wipe away all their grudges.
