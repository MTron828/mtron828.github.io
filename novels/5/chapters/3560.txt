Chapter 3549

BOOM!

Heaven and earth exploded, and waves of violet qi poured into the world. Within this endless violet qi was a surging starry river. Also, the power of time seemed to be contained in this violet qi star diagram. It was just like the workings of the cosmos.

At that moment, the world shook and the ten thousand Daos fluctuated. The entire Heavenly Flame World quivered because of the appearance of this star diagram.

As the violet qi swirled around Long Chen, the light in his eyes twinkled. The current him seemed to be the son of the cosmos, the one in control of the world’s laws. It was as though a single thought from him could destroy the heavens and exterminate the earth.

Long Chen’s aura seemed completely different now, like he was precisely the cosmos, an existence that people didn’t even dare to look at directly.

“Three moves.”

Long Chen coldly spat out two words that no one understood. Long Chen then attacked, raising his Minghong Saber high.

The next moment, the Minghong Saber rumbled with endless violet qi wrapping around it. Countless stars appeared on top of it. After that, sharp Saber Qi soared into the clouds, piercing through the heavens.

When the hole in the heavens appeared, people couldn’t see the sun, moon, and stars. No, what they saw was endless darkness. It was as if the Heavenly Flame World was originally within the darkness. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone’s soul quivered when this saber stabbed the hole through the world, and a terrifying sensation of death filled them. As a result, they turned into frightened rabbits, scattering in every direction.

Fleeing alongside them were the Heavenly Flame Spirits. They seemed to have sensed something wrong as well.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

The Minghong Saber hacked down like a bolt of lightning, bringing with it a river of stars wrapped in violet qi. It appeared completely unstoppable.

Yan Hong’s expression finally changed. At this moment, his soul began to quiver. It was his first time feeling such an immense sensation of danger in his lifetime.

BOOM!

He raised his wings, and millions of black threads flew out, instantly enveloping the sky. They caused the surrounding space to twist. Also, the flame runes within the world were sucked up without leaving a drop by those black threads.

“Heavens, is the Yan Xu Flame truly capable of devouring and controlling all other flames?!” People were horrified by that sight.

Yan Hong was practically a god here. As long as the Heavenly Flame World wasn’t destroyed, his power was limitless. That was absolutely terrifying.

BOOM!

It was at this moment that Long Chen’s saber fell. A heaven-shaking explosion erupted, destroying people’s eardrums. After that, countless people screamed, but they couldn’t even hear it. Although they had fled far away, they were still affected.

Most terrifying of all was that it wasn’t just their hearing that was taken away. They couldn’t see anything either. Everything before them was black, and even their divine sense vanished.

Countless people cried out, thinking that they were already dead. But light quickly returned to their eyes albeit very little. Some people quickly realized that they had been buried.

When they came crawling out of the earth, they realized they were in a giant hole. At the center of it was Long Chen holding the Minghong Saber, calmly standing in the air.

As for Yan Hong, he appeared shocked. He suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood. His blood was as black as ink and automatically ignited as soon as he spat it out, causing it to vanish into heaven and earth.

“Yan Hong was injured?!”

Startled cries rang out. Yan Hong was Yan Xu’s son, an incarnation of flames, an existence said to be undying and indestructible. According to reason, physical attacks should be completely ineffective against him, and only flames should be able to harm him.

However, he was able to devour all the flames of the world, so flame attacks were also meaningless. He was completely unbeatable. It was a power that caused despair. Hence, seeing him cough up blood from Long Chen’s attack, everyone was shocked.

Long Chen’s attack had destroyed the land. As a result, flames spurted out of the land, filling this hole like waves crashing in from every direction.

People were shocked and delighted by this. Immersed within this sea of flames, they crazily absorbed this energy.

This was the world’s energy. It had originally been a tiny stream created due to Yu Qingxuan and Yan Hong’s battle. But that trickle was now crazily gushing out due to Long Chen’s attack. This was an incredibly rare opportunity for any cultivator. Despite knowing the danger, they still crazily absorbed it.

Those Heavenly Flame Spirits also came charging back when this flame energy appeared. It didn’t matter if it was the outside experts or the native Heavenly Flame Spirits, they all profited from this.

The three Divine Venerate Heavenly Flame Spirits had also been blown away. They were originally charging back furiously, but when they saw this flood of flame energy, their anger instantly vanished. They charged into that current, absorbing it with all their might, ignoring Long Chen and Yan Hong.

“I didn’t expect there to be such an energy in this world. It can actually harm my core. Interesting!” Yan Hong’s gaze was burning when he looked at Long Chen. His battle intent rose.

Although he had been injured, he was still filled with confidence. Endless flame energy whirled around him. He was like the flame god of this world, an unbeatable existence.

People’s hearts shook. Long Chen had unleashed such a terrifying attack, shaking everyone. But Yan Hong had received it. The two of them were absolute monsters.

Thinking about that last attack, not one expert present dared to try to receive it. They didn’t even dare to receive the shockwaves and would only flee.

Although Yan Hong had coughed up blood and been injured, he could still receive that attack. Furthermore, he had a flame body. With this place as his battlefield, he recovered faster than anyone. Victory and defeat had yet to be decided.

One battle god and one flame god, both emitting horrifying auras and possessing wills that shook the heavens. They also possessed an arrogance that looked down on all others. Now, these two monsters were pointed at each other.

“I told you, there is no such thing as an absolutely undying body in this world. All things have their bane. Just because you haven’t encountered it yet doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. With that last attack, you dispelled half my power. Your ability really is strange, but it won’t be enough to deal with me. Now, prepare yourself. The second move is coming.”

Long Chen once more raised the Minghong Saber. As a result, the endless violet qi that was scattered throughout heaven and earth was sucked into the Minghong Saber without leaving a single drop.

Just then, a sharp saber will shook the clouds, and a giant saber-image pierced into the darkness beyond the heavens.

The earth began to crack and the void wailed. After that, the ten thousand Daos crumbled. People were shocked to find that the flame runes were coagulating. They were unable to absorb them any longer.

“This is…”

People were horrified. What kind of power was this? Even before Long Chen’s attack fell, the entire world’s laws had changed.

They finally understood what Long Chen meant when he said three moves just now. He was going to kill Yan Hong in three moves!

“Split the Heavens 2!”

This time, Long Chen held the saber with both hands. Furthermore, the aura of this attack was several times stronger than the last. It felt like the Heavenly Flame World was about to collapse, so everyone once more fled.
