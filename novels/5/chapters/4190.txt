Chapter 4179: Sky-High Price

The speaker was also in a private room and didn’t show himself. However, there were intense demonic beast fluctuations coming from that room, showing that it was clearly an expert of the demonic beast race.

The devil expert had bid three demonic beast corpses, infuriating the demonic beast race, and now this expert was striking back, causing the devil experts’ expressions to change.

The atmosphere instantly grew rather odd, so Long Chen loudly announced, “Everyone, since you have a private room, it’s clear that you don’t want to show yourselves to others. Isn’t it precisely to not let others know who you are? Here’s my offer. If you are lucky enough to obtain the cauldron, you can leave with it with no one else being the wiser. It won’t bring any trouble to you or your family. As for the Eternal corpses in your hands, they are also not items that can see the light of day. Didn’t you bring them precisely because you are hoping to secretly sell them for things that you need?

“Devil corpses, demon corpses, everyone wants to get rid of them but are also afraid of slipping up and bringing about a calamity. So, you want to trade them for things that you want, yet you don’t dare to offer them up openly. Isn’t that tiring? These Eternal corpses are like treasures. Whoever finds them first is the keeper. You can trade them as you please. Why have so many misgivings? I will say it clearly right now, I am a rather direct person, and I don’t like being treated like a monkey to be toyed with. Stop interrupting me every time I’m about to count to three. I want to toss this hot potato to someone else, but if you keep interrupting me like that, I’m just going to smash my hammer down and accept whatever the current price is.”

This little speech from Long Chen had quite an effect. In truth, many factions had items that couldn’t see the light of day.

From the Huayun Trading Company, Long Chen had learned that some items had major implications if they were to be traded, and the Soaring Dragon Company would actually accept them in a black market trade.

On the other hand, the Huayun Trading Company never participated in such trades, because doing business in the black market always caused some inevitable bloodshed and darkness. Hence, the Huayun Trading Company refused to participate in it.

In contrast, the Soaring Dragon Company operated differently. They were willing to use any means necessary for money, even if it meant taking significant risks. However, dealing with such stuff could easily infect them with some terrifying karma. Thus, the Soaring Dragon Company charged an exceedingly steep fee for their involvement in these things.

As a result, many factions were dissatisfied when doing this business with them, contemplating ways to conduct this business independently without their involvement.

However, this kind of trade was extremely difficult, as one mistake could trigger a bloody battle. Thus, they were always cautious.

The demonic beast race also had some Eternal corpses from the devil race, which held no value to them. As a result, they wished to trade them for the demonic beast corpses of the devil race, who shared the same sentiment. But neither side had any connections to facilitate such exchanges.

Furthermore, even if they had those connections, they might not dare to do a direct trade. After all, how were they supposed to discuss the difference in price? If the trade didn’t go well, a bloody battle was all too likely to erupt.

Moreover, they didn’t just have corpses but also had divine weapons, cultivation techniques, bone books, and other priceless treasures that were useless to them, but trading them away was too difficult.

Now that the Sage King Convention had started, it was a good chance to get rid of those things. They hoped that they could exchange those useless items for treasures that they could use.

Long Chen saw everyone’s hesitation and directly exposed them, letting them set their misgivings aside and compete openly so they stopped wasting time.

“Alright, this friend bids four Eternal devil corpses. Are there any higher bids?” shouted Long Chen.

“Five Eternal corpses!” Someone instantly made a higher bid.

Clearly, Long Chen’s words were effective. Everyone was in private rooms, and they could shout their bids freely.

After all, these corpses were useless to them, so it was better to use them as chips here. Hopefully, they could win this gamble. If they really obtained the Heaven Earth Cauldron, it would be a turning point in their lives.

“Six Eternal corpses!”

Another person directly bid, stunning everyone. Were Eternal corpses really so worthless? Just how did they manage to get so many?

“Six Eternal corpses plus an Eternal divine saber.” An ancient voice rang out.

Upon hearing this, startled cries rang out. From the fluctuations of that voice, it was clearly a human. It turned out that the human race also had some hidden dragons and crouching tigers. They actually had so many Eternal corpses and an Eternal divine weapon.

Long Chen’s expression didn’t change, but inside, he was cheering. He was truly making a killing this time.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen had mixed expressions. They wanted to warn Long Chen and ask if he had taken out the wrong cauldron. That was because this Heaven Earth Cauldron in front of them was not the one they made.

“Ten Eternal corpses!”

With a cold snort, one person directly raised the bid to ten, wanting to scare off his competitors and express that he wanted this cauldron no matter what.

“Eighteen!”

As a result, someone was even more ruthless and directly bid eighteen, shocking everyone. It was a demonic beast expert.

“Excellent, eighteen corpses! This friend has taken the lead. Eighteen corpses going once, eighteen corpses going twice…” Even with Long Chen’s calmness, he couldn’t stop his voice from shaking.

If he had eighteen Eternal corpses, then the primal chaos space would probably undergo a complete transformation. All the vegetation inside would grow crazily, and he would have an unending supply of life energy.

“Eighteen corpses and six Eternal divine weapons.” Suddenly, a strange voice rang out and caused an uproar.

To their surprise, this bid didn’t come from a private room but from the seats in the back instead.

Everyone’s gazes searched through the seats. According to reason, a person in that spot was only there to watch the show. They wouldn’t bid.

When everyone looked, they saw that this person was wrapped in black qi, so it was impossible to see their face. In fact, it was impossible to even see what lifeform they were.

However, the deep eyes contained within that black qi raised goosebumps. Even innate Heaven Venerates felt a cold breeze on their backs when they saw those eyes.

Long Chen also jumped in shock. While he couldn't discern the person's origins, he sensed that their cultivation base was in the Immortal King realm. However, the pressure they gave exceeded that of innate Heaven Venerates. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“This person will probably be a tough opponent.”

Long Chen was shaken. But this person’s aura was too strange, and he couldn’t probe him here. The auction had to continue.

“Eighteen corpses and six Eternal divine weapons! Are there other bids? If there are no further bids, I’ll start counting. Going once. Going twice. Going three times. Sold!”

Bang!

Long Chen smashed his wooden hammer, his heart blooming with joy. He finally managed to sell off this Heaven Earth Cauldron.
