Chapter 4536 Black Rock Nine Underworld Python

The speaker was a bald, dark-faced man with dense scales covering his facial skin. His pupils were vertical just like a crocodile’s, looking rather scary.

Most frightening of all though was his violent Blood Qi, which resembled a volcano on the verge of erupting. As he blocked Feng You and her people’s path, the space behind him twisted, revealing one figure after another. After they all emerged, Long Chen saw that they also numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

“Black Rock Nine Underworld Pythons!” Feng You’s pupils shrank. In an instant, the mixed beast race’s experts turned serious, ready for combat at any moment.

“What are those?” asked Long Chen.

“Our luck really isn’t good to encounter an old enemy as soon as we come out. You should get back. If a fight starts, you won’t have time to get away,” whispered Feng You.

In Feng You’s eyes, although Long Chen had managed to turn the tides twice in their past battles, he had always relied on some small tricks, such as blasting people’s butts or using medicinal powder to blind them.

She believed that in terms of true combat power, Long Chen could only be considered a first-rate expert, not a peak one. He couldn’t rely on luck for too long, as someone could just land a lucky blow on him and kill him accidentally without giving him the chance to use his little tricks.

Long Chen very obediently went to the back and asked one of the mixed beast race’s experts some questions, but that person just pointed at Feng You. Seeing that person’s gesture, Long Chen instantly understood.

“Who is he?” asked the bald, dark-faced man.

When Long Chen retreated, the leader of the pythons immediately noticed him. After all, he was the only one to move upon seeing them.

“None of your business. Rock Underworld Pythons, since you’re blocking our path, do you wish to fight?” demanded Feng You.

“I asked you who he is!” shouted the bald man, his gaze becoming sharp.

Just now, Long Chen had been standing behind Feng You. However, when the bald man appeared, Feng You directly lowered her head to speak to Long Chen, prompting his retreat. The bald man witnessed everything, and it fueled his anger.

In truth, this man was the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python’s number one young expert, and he had exchanged blows with Feng You multiple times.

Despite these clashes, a clear victor had never emerged due to them holding back. And ever since then, this man developed a deep infatuation with Feng You. He even sent emissaries to the mixed beast race to propose marriage multiple times. However, Feng You felt an intense dislike for him, so she didn’t even let these emissaries pass the entrance.

Unfortunately, this person didn’t know when to give up, and they actually encountered each other here. Feng You loathed him, but she couldn’t just offend the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race as the latter was a powerful force.

While the mixed beast race wasn’t afraid of them, in the end, it was not a good thing to have mortal enemies all around them. Thus, despite her hatred for this bald man, she didn’t know how to get rid of him.

She was about to shout back at this rude interrogation when Long Chen answered for her.

“I’m your daddy!”

“What nonsense. My father is in my race’s headquarters. You dare to pretend to be him? Courting death!” roared that bald man.

Long Chen almost coughed up blood. Even though he considered himself eloquent, he had no idea how to respond to such a thing.

Feng You glared at Long Chen before turning back to the bald man. “Yan Baichen, don’t create trouble where none exists. My mixed beast race has no business with your Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race, and we are not afraid of anyone.”

“So you’ve already found a partner!” the bald man shouted furiously, pointing at Long Chen. “What’s with that look?! What kind of trash is he?! He isn’t even worth dirtying my hand! How can he be a match for you?!”

Seeing this comedy in person, Long Chen felt insulted but also couldn’t hold back his laughter. This fellow’s head really was interesting. After all, Long Chen wasn’t using medicinal pills to cover his aura, so anyone with eyes could tell that he was an outsider.

So, this fellow had failed to pursue Feng You multiple times and was now laying the blame on Long Chen. Did he not realize that the timing didn’t match?

For the bald man to accuse Long Chen of impersonating his father, it seemed that he really lacked the ability to think far ahead. Long Chen could only shake his head in disbelief. It was a pity that beneath the exterior of his oversized bald head, there was a noticeable absence of brain matter.

In response to Yan Baichen’s accusation, Feng You simply smiled. “That’s right, I’ve long since found a partner. So you should just give up on that thought!”

It seemed that even Feng You had learned how to scheme. She thought by saying Long Chen was her partner, Yan Baichen would give up on her. She could get rid of him this way.

However, to her surprise, Yan Baichen quivered with rage and then pointed at Long Chen. “Brat! Get out here! We’ll fight, and the loser has to leave Feng You!”

Hearing this, Long Chen almost lost it and burst into laughter. Just how childish was this fellow? If he could say such a thing, how could Long Chen possibly bear to attack him?

“Get out here! I’ll even give you one arm, you gutless coward!” Yan Baichen repeatedly roared.

Long Chen just stood there silently. He had long since stopped playing such childish games. This kind of provocation was meaningless against him.

Finally, he couldn’t help but say, “Child, listen to this uncle’s advice. Go be stupid somewhere else. I won’t fight you.”

“Courting death! First, you pretended to be my father, and now you think that you can trick me into thinking that you’re my uncle?! Come out! I’ll beat you to death!” roared Yan Baichen.

His roar was incredibly loud, but interestingly enough, he kept his aura suppressed to conceal his true power.

Despite this, Long Chen already had a general estimate of his power. For him to control his aura at this time only made Long Chen feel like he was an idiot.

After all of his angry shouts, Yan Baichen still refrained from making a move. No one knew if he was worried about not being able to beat Feng You or maybe he didn’t want to worsen his image in front of her. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Unable to hold back her frustration any longer, Feng You screamed at him directly. “Yan Baichen, just what do you think you’re doing?! If you really want to, I don’t mind exchanging a few blows with you!”

Finally, Feng You’s expression was icy-cold, but Yan Baichen kept glaring at Long Chen, even as she pointed her golden spear at him. He threatened, “Brat, just you wait. Don’t give me a chance, or I’ll flay your skin.”

Long Chen had been smiling while observing the entire time, but this guy was just too much. He had given this guy too much face, wasn’t he?

“Feng You, I’ve known you for so long but haven’t given you any gifts. Would you like it if I gave you a snakeskin armor set?” asked Long Chen.

Feng You was startled but quickly understood what he meant. Perhaps Yan Baichen also had a stroke of brilliance, or he simply was so sensitive to the word snakeskin that he instantly grasped what Long Chen meant.

“Die!”

Yan Baichen’s figure suddenly vanished, and a terrifying killing intent erupted.
