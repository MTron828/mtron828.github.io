Chapter 4789 A Warning to the World

Long Zhantian’s movements seemed extremely light, as if he didn’t use any power at all. This casual point of a finger did not seem like some sort of technique.

However, this seemingly casual attack flowed like water. When Long Zhantian made his move, the flow of time suddenly slowed down, and everyone felt their reaction speed becoming sluggish.

While Long Chen had experienced similar attacks, they did not actually possess the power of time. They were simply illusions to throw people off using speed, visual effects, and spatial senses.

However, this one finger of Long Zhantian’s truly contained the laws of time. In an instant, Long Chen understood that his father was showing him the difference between himself and Heaven Saints.

Long Chen had slain a Mortal Saint and Earth Saint. Working off that, he felt like he was qualified to challenge Heaven Saints. However, he now saw that Heaven Saints were in an entirely different dimension.

“A little clone dares to be so arrogant?!” the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint roared, perceiving Long Zhantian’s attack as an absolute insult/ It was like Long Zhantian was saying that he could kill him with a single finger.

The Heaven Saint then extended his right hand, and with a shake, runes covered his entire palm, causing his hand to look like it had been made of gold.

“Metal energy!” Bai Shishi was startled. As a fellow metal cultivator, she noticed that this Heaven Saint had sucked away all the metal energy of heaven and earth, trying to even grab her metal energy.

Bai Shishi had never seen such a terrifying power before. This Heaven Saint had not even summoned his manifestation, nor did he accumulate any energy.

When one finger and one palm collided, ripples exploded.

BOOM!

Long Chen was the first to be struck by the ripples. Despite his preparation, the impact left him dazed, nearly causing him to spit out blood. It felt as though an invisible hand was wringing his body and soul, such an indescribable sensation. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Nevertheless, Long Chen refused to retreat, so he forced himself to endure this blow. He wasn’t willing to forgo the rare experience of watching two Heaven Saints fight.

In fact, Long Chen welcomed the destructive power infused with the laws of the Heavenly Daos and the wills of Heaven Saints to rampage through him. He hoped to glean insights into the secrets of the Heaven Saint realm through firsthand experience.

The ripples reached the Dragonblood Legion, and each of them spat out a mouthful of blood. Although they were strong enough to block the impact of these ripples, their souls felt as though they were being crushed under the weight of the Heaven Saints' wills.

Seeing that even the Dragonblood Legion couldn’t endure this pressure, the surrounding experts were about to run when the various leaders shouted, “The will of Heaven Saints can strike you wherever you go. If you choose to flee, it will directly disperse your souls. Stand your ground if you want to live!”

When these ripples reached them, countless experts resisted with all their power, and many of them were sent flying like leaves in the wind.

Some people chose to flee, but their souls were instantly extinguished. When they fell to the ground, they were nothing but mere corpses.

In truth, by the time these ripples reached here, much of their power had dissipated. While it might appear mighty, the truth was that the Dragonblood Legion had endured a pressure a thousand times greater than them. There was even less that needed to be said about Long Chen.

Long Zhantian’s finger continued to press down on the golden palm of the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint. Ripples continuously scoured against heaven and earth, shaking the very world. The sky had already lost its original color.

“This is truly a power that can destroy the world!”

People were shocked to realize that during this clash, they could no longer sense any Heavenly Dao energy, as if the power of heaven and earth had been sucked dry by the two combatants.

In front of these two, everyone else was like an ant. The shock brought by Long Chen killing the Earth Saint was wiped away. In front of these Heaven Saints, that battle looked like children fighting.

After blocking Long Zhantian, the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint sneered at him, “You’re nothing more than a clone. After all that nonsense about being the future strongest Heaven Saint of the Long clan...”

He couldn’t finish his words as his palm started to shake. His face then swelled up like a pig’s as if he had been constipated for eight hundred years.

All of a sudden, Long Zhantian’s finger became covered in seven-color divine radiance. This light was applying powerful pressure on the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint.

“Our Long clan’s strongest seven-color Supreme Blood has appeared! Although it’s not my first time seeing it, it makes my blood heat up every time I see it!” exclaimed one of the Long clan’s experts behind the Heaven Overseer.

When Long Zhantian used his seven-color Supreme Blood, his aura didn’t change, but cracks appeared in the void beneath the Heaven Saint’s feet. He was slowly being forced back. In this competition of power, he was losing.

Long Zhantian eyed his opponent lightly. “I might just be a clone, but it should be no problem to kill someone without honor who can only bully those smaller than him. Long Chen is my son, one of the two most important people to me. He is my reverse scale, so I’m sorry.”

The Celestial race’s Heaven Saint suddenly roared, and he turned golden, divine light condensing behind him.

“He’s summoning his manifestation!”

“A Heaven Saint’s manifestation! This world is going to be destroyed! We’re going to die!” Only the Earth Saints were aware of what kind of devastation was about to follow.

Just then, Long Zhantian continued, “In order to let the whole world know that Long Chen is my son, I can only use your life as a warning to this world.”

Suddenly, Long Zhantian’s finger quivered, and a seven-color sword instantly pierced through the golden hand and through the Heaven Saint’s head.
