Chapter 4288: Lord Brahma’s Scheme

The battlefield was the same battlefield, but now, there was not even a shadow of a ghost present. Even the numerous divine items that had fallen on the battlefield were gone, including their fragments.

Clearly, someone had cleaned up the battlefield. In fact, multiple waves of people must have come, as the corpses of many experts had been taken.

Long Chen stood in the sky and looked at this vast battlefield. For some reason, he suddenly felt a sense of loss inside.

“In this world, can we do nothing but slaughter one another? Why cannot multiple races live peacefully?” Looking at the blood-soaked land, Long Chen couldn’t help murmuring to himself.

Slaughter brought no joy; it only brought pain. But in order to live, Long Chen could only continue to kill.

The Minghong Saber was gone. Long Chen had helped it achieve its long-cherished wish, but Long Chen’s heart was now empty.

Blooddrinker, Dragonbone Evilmoon, and now the Minghong Saber. They were all his comrades, but they were unable to accompany him to the end.

Every time he lost one of them, he felt a stinging pain in his heart. It felt like he had lost his direction.

Long Chen sat on a mound of earth, and a slight breeze blew by, lifting up the dust. The smell of blood still lingered in the air. Long Chen sensed countless resentful spirits swirling around him, either sobbing or cursing him.

However, Long Chen didn’t mind. He simply sat there like a statue. The sun rose and then fell, and a full day passed just like that.

During all this time, he didn’t even twitch. Many thoughts ran through his head during this day; his line of thought was extremely chaotic.

After a full day and night, Long Chen slowly rose. To his surprise though, his body had fully recovered. This entire time, he hadn’t even done anything to recover. He had just wanted to calm his heart and ponder upon a few things in his weak state, wanting to look at the world from a different view point.

However, in a short day and night, his body had fully recovered on his own, and even his overdrafted soul was at full power. He was in top condition.

“What’s going on?” Long Chen looked at his own hands in disbelief.

“The seven-color Supreme Blood has returned to you, and it possesses a natural self-recovery ability. With the power of the five elements added to Yin and Yang, it is essentially a natural formation. Have you not sensed it yourself?” asked the dragon expert.

Only then did Long Chen look within himself and notice that his body had gone through an astonishing change. The seven-color Supreme Blood was flowing through his body like a hardworking craftsman fixing anything it found lacking. It was like a child fixing up its home, excitedly decorating it.

However, next to it was the violet blood, and it was in a slumbering state.

“Wait, what about my dragon blood?!” Long Chen suddenly cried out. He was shocked to find that his dragon blood was gone.

“Don’t panic. The seven-color Supreme Blood is your natural essence blood and has the highest compatibility with your body. If the dragon blood were to be fused with it, they would only lower each other’s divinities, so I have drawn your dragon blood into your tendons,” said the dragon expert.

Only then did Long Chen notice that his tendons had become golden, and his dragon power had switched storage locations. After that, Long Chen relaxed.

“You should thank Long Aotian. No, actually you should thank the Long clan. They lost a fortune to activate your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone. In order to let them awaken without losing the slightest bit of their spirituality, they used the best resources possible. Now, it has all benefited you,” said the dragon expert with a chuckle.

“Hehe, it’s thanks to your guidance.” Long Chen also chuckled.

If it hadn’t been for the dragon expert stopping him, he’d have long since killed Long Aotian and taken back his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, harming their spirituality in the process.

Now though, they had been nurtured by others and then taken without Long Chen having to exert any effort.

Any dissatisfaction he harbored back then had vanished. In truth, everything the dragon expert had done was for his benefit. Thinking about his temper back then, Long Chen felt a bit bad.

“Senior, can I now merge with my violet blood and Supreme Bone?” asked Long Chen. The Supreme Bone was now in his body, right where it had been dug out.

“That's what I wanted to talk about. For now, don’t merge with them yet. Let us discuss some things,” said the dragon expert.

“Junior is listening,” said Long Chen hastily.

“There are many things that I have not told you for fear of the heavens grasping it. Inflicting you with unbearable karma would only harm you. However, now you have the Sage King karmic luck, so your bad luck is gradually being countered. You should be able to endure stronger karma now. The first thing I want to tell you is that the world behind that gate contains all the races other than the human race. Once that gate opens, they will slaughter your human race. The battle will be far bloodier than the one that you just fought on the martial stage.”

“Senior, was the previous Sage King Convention a scheme set up by Lord Brahma?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking.

“Yes.”

“If Lord Brahma set up such a thing, isn’t he shooting himself in the foot? He is from the human race, and his followers are also from the human race,” said Long Chen.

“Child, sometimes you are smart, but sometimes not really. Has the human race been completely unified by Lord Brahma?”

“Are you saying that Lord Brahma is doing this to wipe out any dissidents? He’s going to get rid of everyone who doesn’t rely on him?” Long Chen gasped.

If that was the case, Lord Brahma was truly ruthless. He was a pure dictator, the pinnacle of follow me and prosper, oppose me and perish.

“But how can Lord Brahma guarantee that those lifeforms don’t attack his followers?” asked Long Chen.

“Lord Brahma’s power isn’t something that you can imagine. When it comes to restraint, when it comes to pretending to be the pig to eat the tiger, he is the master. His followers are spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, so everything you have seen is only the tip of the iceberg. You have no idea just how much faith energy he has accumulated over millions and millions of years. However, you can extrapolate it based on Enpuda and Liao Bencang’s level. They were nothing more than some tiny bandits beneath him but possessed such faith energy that they could easily fight across realms. It’s not hard to guess just how much stronger Lord Brahma is,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen was shocked. Lord Brahma was actually far more terrifying than he had expected. Previously, he had thought that Enpuda and Liao Bencang were Lord Brahma’s left and right hands.

However, then the eight divine commanders appeared, and only then did Long Chen realize that those two were tiny figures beneath Lord Brahma. Were there even more terrifying forces above the eight divine commanders? Lord Brahma’s faction was enormous, so large that it was unimaginable. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Lord Brahma’s cultivation base is unrestricted by the laws of heaven and earth due to his immense reserves of faith energy. Faith energy is like accumulating specks of sand to condense an enormous tower. As for Lord Brahma, he is the existence that stands at the top of this tower. I’m telling you all this because I don’t want you to underestimate him. You have disguised your identity as a nine star heir very well, and even the eight divine commanders did not suspect you. You must continue like this. As once your identity is exposed, Lord Brahma will personally deal with you. Before growing up, you simply are not on the same level as him. In a direct clash, you will undoubtedly die.”

“Junior understands,” said Long Chen solemnly.

“Let us move on from Lord Brahma for now. Let me tell you about those lifeforms behind the gate. With your current power, within the same realm, you would only be considered above average when compared to those lifeforms,” said the dragon expert.

“What?!”

Long Chen instantly shot up, filled with disbelief.
