Chapter 4456 Once More Seeing the Heavens Weep Blood

BOOM!

The pill Long Chen had just devoured was the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill. The next moment, powerful medicinal energy spread throughout Long Chen, and his aura instantly erupted.

Long Chen’s realm instantly leaped from the fifth Heavenstage to the sixth Heavenstage, and his exhausted energy directly recovered to his peak.

From this, it could be seen that the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill’s medicinal effect was absolutely shocking. Not only did Long Chen fully recover his energy, but his realm also increased by a whole level.

Long Chen was incensed. His title as Sage King was dogshit, and the Heavenly Dao was so partial that it had helped Netherdragon Tianzhao to kill him, causing him to lose the last shred of his patience. If the Heavenly Daos were unfair, what could possibly be fair in this world?

In the end, witnessing a flood of experts converging to attack him, he couldn’t endure it anymore. His blood rushed to his head, causing his eyes to turn scarlet. Unbeknownst to him, specks of black also appeared within his eyes. All he knew in that moment was the overwhelming desire to embark on a slaughter of every lifeform before him.

“DIE!”

Long Chen let out a heaven-shaking roar, summoning a flame lotus in his left hand and a lightning sphere in his right.

BOOM!

Unable to bear the force of his raging power, the world rumbled and quivered.

As Long Chen forcefully slammed his hands together, the world lost all color, and the merged lightning sphere and flame lotus created an awe-inspiring spectacle.

“Lightning Flame World Extermination!”

Long Chen unleashed a sinister roar that echoed like a malevolent force from the depths of hell. A torrent of lightning and flames then surged, overwhelming the gathered experts.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As lightning and flames tore through the fabric of reality, the very void collapsed and the stars quivered.

In the heart of the tumult, everyone bore witness to the annihilation of thousands of experts. The blood of Eternal experts and budding Doyens showered the battlefield, and countless individuals coughed up blood, propelled backward in wretched retreat.

They stared at Long Chen in horror as if he was a wild devil god from the depth of hell.

Just then, rain fell from the nine heavens, but what left people in awe was its crimson hue.

“The heavens are weeping?!” Terrified exclamations echoed. According to legend, when tribulations befell and numerous heavenly geniuses died, the heavens would feel such grief that they wept tears of blood.

“You have the audacity to cry now?! Why do you pretend to care?! Your righteousness, your benevolence, your impartiality, they’re all nothing but a sham! Since you want to die so badly, I’ll make you cry until you drown in tears!”

Long Chen looked up at that rain of blood and unleashed a thunderous roar.

He had never provoked someone, but countless tribulations always befell him. He also refrained from bullying others, yet it seemed everyone wanted to bully him. Before this, Netherdragon Tianzhao clearly sought his demise, yet the Heavenly Daos inexplicably sided against him, attempting to orchestrate his demise.

A batch of suicidal budding Heavenly Doyens then wanted to kill Long Chen, only to be slain by him. However, the heavens wept tears of blood for them as if they were the heroes and he was the villain.

This pushed Long Chen to the brink of madness, to the point where he summoned his bloody manifestation. In an instant, his seven-color divine radiance lit up, painting the world with seven crimson hues. The very fabric of reality then caught fire as flames voraciously devoured the heavens.

“Boss is really angry!”

Guo Ran and the others let out startled cries, as they could feel Long Chen’s berserk killing intent enveloping Heaven and Earth.

“Supreme Blood Ignition, Ten Thousand Swords Fly!” Long Chen roared. With swift hand seals, he conjured millions of Seven Peak Swords, creating a vast sea of blades that surged in all directions.

“Not good!”

“Block them!”

“Run!”

Some were left only able to shout, while others sought allies, and the rest simply fled. It was chaotic.

Long Chen was so fast with his techniques because he was now strong enough, not fearing any backlash. This formidable move unfolded with minimal casting time, almost instantaneous, giving people no time to react. This sea of swords then fell upon those experts, and the air resounded with the cacophony of despair-laden screams and the sickening noise of flesh being torn apart.

After the torrent of blades passed, countless bodies lay strewn on the ground, dead. The surface of the region was littered with grim corpses and broken limbs.

“Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum!”

After that attack, a dragon cry rang out, and a golden dragon tail swept through this space.

Apparently, the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill not only increased Long Chen’s realm, healed his injuries, and nourished his soul, but it also replenished his mostly exhausted dragon blood energy.

In his fury, Long Chen unleashed his ultimate moves like they were freebies. He teetered on the edge of madness, consumed by a singular desire—to kill! That was the only way for him to quell the fury raging within him.

After the first onslaught, no one knew the extent of the carnage. While some experts managed to survive that first wave of attacks by joining forces, they had no time to celebrate before Long Chen’s next attack arrived.

The nether dragon race’s experts had a bad feeling. Long Chen was practically unstoppable, and a paralyzing fear now held sway over the experts from other races, making them hesitant to intervene. After all, Long Chen’s relentless assault had claimed the lives of nearly half of them, leaving the survivors demoralized and unwilling to continue the fight.

If this continued, the nether dragon race would stand alone against Long Chen. After losing their reinforcements, they didn’t know how long they could survive. If they couldn’t last until their race leader escaped, they would all go extinct.

“Block together!” shouted an elder of the nether dragon race. Whether it was seniors or juniors, they summoned their nether dragon power to form a shield.

They had to endure this attack to let their reinforcements see hope. Otherwise, everyone would flee, and there would be no way to gather them again to fight.

The nether dragon race had no other choice. In the end, saving these people was also saving themselves. In an instant, a colossal dragon-shaped shield materialized, forged from the collective power of thousands of their experts. This formidable barrier stood resolute before Long Chen’s Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s attack exploded along with that shield, causing the nether dragon race’s experts to cough up a mouthful of blood. They were pleasantly surprised though as they had managed to block Long Chen’s attack.

“Quick, now’s our chance to counterattack!” shouted an expert of the nether dragon race.

Immediately, the fleeing experts seemed to understand. With powerful shouts, they came charging back, but they instantly regretted staying here.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

An enormous dragon claw stretched out of Long Chen’s divine ring.

“How can this be?!”

The nether dragon race’s experts let out furious shouts. How could Long Chen unleash such powerful moves consecutively? There should at least be a brief moment that Long Chen was unable to unleash another technique like it.

BOOM!

Just as they were terrified and enraged, that dragon claw fell, wiping countless experts out of existence.

A powerful shockwave then rippled outward from the point of impact, incapacitating even those fortunate enough to evade the direct impact.

The death toll on the nether dragon race was devastating—less than a tenth of their once-numerous experts remained. Even among the survivors, many were half-crippled and unable to keep fighting.

They were scared shitless now, realizing that Long Chen was no human. He was a devil, a devil with limitless power!

“A Doyen controls the fate of the heavens? Then I want to see who can stop me from killing someone that I want to kill!” roared Long Chen.

With a powerful sweep of his Kunpeng wings, he shot after Netherdragon Tianzhao who was hidden in the rear.
