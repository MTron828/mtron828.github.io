Chapter 2538 A Feast

“Why is that?” asked Long Chen.

“The Sword Dao is not encompassed within the Heavenly Daos. Or rather… the Sword Dao exists outside the Heavenly Daos. It can be said to be above the Heavenly Daos. Hence, even if he came, he wouldn’t be able to benefit from the laws here,” explained Ling Xi.

“Can you explain that a bit clearer?” probed Long Chen. He felt like he had heard others say that the Sword Dao was above the Heavenly Daos, but he didn’t know what exactly that meant.

“I’m not very clear on it either. All I know is that the Sword Dao is not within the Heavenly Daos. I have some vague inherited memories that seem to say that the reason is related to the Sword God. But I don’t remember anything about the Sword Dao. It seems that it’s taboo,” said Ling Xi hesitatingly. It seemed she couldn’t be sure and didn’t dare to randomly say something for fear of misguiding Long Chen.

“Then can I cultivate here?” asked Long Chen.

Ling Xi smiled slightly. She just looked at Long Chen and didn’t reply.

Being looked at like that, Long Chen was embarrassed. As expected of the mother god of the Luo Spirit race. Even though she wasn’t used to communicating with humans, it didn’t mean she was so easy to fool. She wouldn’t reveal anything about the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

Long Chen awkwardly laughed. “Ah, I feel like I should be able to cultivate here. Yes, definitely.”

Ling Xi smiled. “I also feel like you can.”

Alright, it seemed that they had come to a tacit understanding. Long Chen gave up tricking any information out of Ling Xi. After all, she was an existence that had lived for countless years, and his little ploys couldn’t beat her.

In the distance, the sound of a zither began to ring out. The white-robed Zi Yan was sitting in the sky, and the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither was quivering in front of her, spreading ripples to their surroundings.

Zi Yan’s zither music was the music of the heavens, and she could use it to assimilate with the Heavenly Daos. As she played, the world was immersed in her music.

Long Chen sighed in amazement. Zi Yan was truly like a fairy from the heavens. Her music was sacred and transcendent, and just listening to it could cleanse the soul. That beautiful feeling could not be expressed with words.

Long Chen took a deep breath and drew himself from the music. If everyone else was cultivating, he couldn’t laze about.

Long Chen walked out to the very edge of space, which was the wall of the world. At first, the resistance wasn’t too bad. But the closer he got, the greater the pressure.

Rumbling rang out in his ears as he advanced. It was as if he was in a tsunami.

Flames and lightning burst out. Without Long Chen’s summoning them, a lightning dragon and a flame dragon flew out.

At the same time, the void shuddered. Flame runes and lightning runes gathered around them.

Those runes varied in color and shape. Every one of them represented a kind of law.

“Big brother Long Chen, this place can let me recover my energy much faster.” Huo Linger transmitted a message to Long Chen excitedly. Having used the nine star World Extermination Flame Lotus, she had used up all her energy. Hence, she was happy to be in a place full of flame energy that could help replenish her energy stores.

Lei Long was the same. Thunder boomed and the thunderforce here seemed to be willingly absorbed.

“Huo Linger, bring in the Moon and Star Refining Furnace with you as you recover. You can help me refine some more pills,” said Long Chen. He then sent the Moon and Star Refining Furnace flying over to the flame dragon. Without Huo Linger, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace couldn’t refine pills effectively on its own. It would just be a waste of time if it tried to refine pills with its core flame.

Now, Long Chen was preparing to attack the next realm. He had managed to activate the Six Star Battle Armor. However, in order to fully control its power, he would need to attain a higher realm.

“Bring me in too!” The Demon Moon Furnace flew out as well.

All this time, Huo Linger had been refining Nethergate Pills with the Moon and Star Refining Furnace, which made the Demon Moon Furnace go crazy. Now that Long Chen wanted pills to advance realms, it could also refine them.

The flame and lightning dragons coiled in the air, and their light grew brighter and brighter. Both of them absorbed all the various kinds of flame and lightning energy present.

These energies came from the Star Field Divine World. However, after observing for a while, Long Chen couldn’t help frowning.

“Ling Xi, why is the thunderforce here so much weaker than on the Martial Heaven Continent?”

“The Martial Heaven Continent is the core of the star-field. As for the Star Field Divine World, it is nothing more than a corner of the star-field that is no longer complete. The law representing the Heavenly Daos’ heavenly punishment has dispersed here. Hence, the remaining lightning energy can only strengthen your lightning dragon, but it will not allow it to break through its current bottleneck,” explained Ling Xi.

Long Chen nodded. Long Chen had heard that the Martial Heaven Continent was the core of a star-field before. Ming Cangyue had mentioned it, along with saying that the Martial Heaven Continent had a giant secret.

Long Chen felt like he could comprehend Ling Xi’s explanation, yet wasn’t sure that he fully understood it. However, he didn’t bother asking more questions, as he didn’t want it to become awkward if Ling Xi refused to answer again.

Long Chen then looked at the lightning dragon and the flame dragon. “It seems that there’s nothing here for me…” Long Chen’s gaze suddenly brightened. “Ling Xi, can you give me a tree branch?”

“Of course. Even if you want the toughest wood heart, it would be fine to give you a bit,” said Ling Xi.

“No, just a branch is enough,” said Long Chen, realizing that Ling Xi had misunderstood and thought that he wanted a weapon.

Ling Xi stared at him questioningly. After that, she pulled at her hair, plucking out a single strand and placing it in Long Chen’s hand. It then transformed into a three-foot branch the thickness of a thumb.

The wooden stick was dark green and heavier than an ordinary divine weapon. It pulsed with life energy.

Long Chen thanked her and carefully planted it inside the primal chaos space. However, its life energy rapidly faded and it withered, transforming into a pile of dust that dispersed into the soil.

“What…?”

Long Chen stared blankly. Just what had happened? He didn’t bury it in the black soil, so how could it wither so quickly?

“What is it?” asked Ling Xi.

Long Chen explained that he had a mysterious soil space that could grow all kinds of precious medicines but not this branch.

Ling Xi said, “Every part of the mother tree is blessed by the Luo Spirit race, and the mother tree is so powerful due to the Luo Spirit race’s faith energy. Hence, that branch was only useful within the realm of the Star Field Divine World where the mother tree’s energy can reach. Without faith energy sustaining it, its divine essence will quickly fade. The mother tree and I are manifestations of the Luo Spirit race’s faith. Without the Luo Spirit race, we would not exist. Without us, the Luo Spirit race would not exist. We are co-dependent existences.”

Hearing this, Long Chen sighed. His dreams of obtaining a forest of mother trees were destroyed. It seemed that he could only raise his demon trees.

“Alright, I give up. Are there any places in this world with particular evil creatures? I need a large number of corpses. It’s very important.” The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had withered, and Long Chen wanted to revive them as soon as possible.

Without them, he wouldn’t even have the power to use the Six Star Battle Armor. Without an unending stream of life energy, he couldn’t fight with it.

“There are plenty. The Poison Dragon Abyss, Heavenly Scorpion Canyon, the edge of the River of Darkness, or even a channel to another world, there are plenty of terrible beasts there. They are all enemies of the Luo Spirit race, and we used to fight with them when the Star Field Divine World was still complete. During that age, if it wasn’t for the king of the spirit dragon race helping us, we probably wouldn’t have been able to hold out. If you want corpses, I can gather my people for battle,” said Ling Xi.

Long Chen shook his head. “The Luo Spirit race has just endured a major battle. They should rest. Whether it is the Luo Spirit race or my people, they all need some time to recuperate.”

“Then what? The mother tree and I can only support the Luo Spirit race in battle. We cannot fight ourselves,” said Ling Xi.

“Sometimes problems don’t always have to be solved entirely by martial power. There are some tricks that can save a huge amount of manpower. Ah, speaking of which, can your gaze help me find Ye Ming? I want to return his favor.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I can’t do it right now. The mother tree’s current power is only enough to see the outline of the various lands. I cannot lock onto specific people yet,” said Ling Xi.

“Oh. Then forget about it. That lucky bastard, I have no time to handle him. Can you give me a detailed explanation about the three areas you mentioned, including the weaknesses, strengths, and habits of the lifeforms inhabiting those places? I’ll come up with a battle plan,” said Long Chen, a bit regretful. Having been led by the nose by Ye Ming for so long, he felt bad not paying him back.

However, there was no way around it. Ye Ming was now all on his own. In a place as large as the Star Field Divine World, it was like searching for a needle in an ocean.

After receiving a detailed explanation of the three areas, Long Chen descended down the mother tree. He then ordered the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance, the Xuan Beasts, and the Dragonblood Legion to gather.

With Ling Xi’s help, their injuries had healed and they were invigorated. Long Chen then sent them up the mother tree to cultivate. He only kept behind Guo Ran, Yue Zifeng, and Wilde.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to a feast.” Long Chen’s group of four quietly left the mother tree.
