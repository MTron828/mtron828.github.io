Chapter 2588 Terrifying Figure Arrives

BOOM!

A majestic dragon roar that contained the voices of ten thousand dragons rang out. The eight chains were instantly blown apart.

“You want to kill me, Guo Ran? Do you think you have that power?” Guo Ran sneered. Wings spread on the back of his armor, and he actually charged at one of the eight elders.

“What?!” Everyone was shocked. They had no idea what had happened. All they had seen was Guo Ran’s manifestation erupting with light, along with the roar of ten thousand dragons. Then those eight Heaven Merging elders were blasted back.

They were unaware that Guo Ran’s armor was now capable of absorbing even more power. With the Dragonblood warriors having undergone the tempering of the dragon pool’s essence blood, they had gone through a complete transformation as a whole.

Their manifestations were now even further linked together. In that instant, all the Dragonblood warriors’ power surged toward Guo Ran, which was why he dared to be so arrogant as to ignore eight Heaven Merging experts and still slay their Sovereign sprout.

Others were unaware of this, and so all they saw was that Guo Ran was capable of ignoring the attacks of eight Heaven Merging experts on his own. He was even more shocking than Long Chen.

The elder that Guo Ran attacked was sent flying and hacked up blood. An opening appeared within their enclosure.

“Then I won’t be accompanying you any longer.” Guo Ran laughed and shot out.

The amount of power he had just controlled was not sustainable. Such immense power was something his armor could only use once before they had to cool down. Within that period, half the Dragonblood warriors’ power was used.

Guo Ran sighed inside. If he could unleash seventy percent of the Dragonblood warriors’ power, perhaps he would have managed to kill one of those eight elders. Then this moment would be even more perfect.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

The two closest elders blocked his way. Guo Ran had killed one of their Sovereign sprouts. If they didn't kill him in retribution, that would be a serious blow to the Blood race’s morale, not to mention that they would have no way to explain themselves to the higher-ups.

Suddenly, the earth exploded and two giant hands reached out, filled with earth energy. They slammed into the two of them, exploding and sending them tumbling back.

After that, a spear pierced through the air, stabbing through one of them.

“Die!” The attacker was Gu Yang. The elder didn’t even have a chance to cry out before being blasted apart. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The earth collapsed and two giants climbed out, each holding a warhammer. They attacked the other elder.

“Save me!” shouted the elder. Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s warhammers were smashing toward him like two meteors.

The elder’s shout was drowned out by a powerful explosion. Everyone shivered. It was like two titans had smashed a fly to death. When the two warhammers separated, the elder was gone, crushed out of existence. All that was left of him was some blood left on the warhammers.

“Let’s go!” Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan didn’t tarry. They hastily retreated with Guo Ran. The four of them then quickly exited the battlefield, returning to the side of the Martial Heaven Continent.

Only then did everyone react. Explosive cheers came from the Martial Heaven Continent’s side.

“Hehe, showing off and then running really is satisfying,” said Guo Ran, feeling pleased.

Gu Yang and the others nodded along with a smile. It truly had been satisfying. They had escaped before the Blood race could use their world divine item.

“It was stimulating. I almost felt some terrifying thing was about to lock onto us, but we ran fast enough,” said Li Qi.

“We didn’t forget to get something extra before running too,” added Guo Ran. The four of them exchanged a look and laughed.

Seeing that the four of them had killed two Heaven Merging experts and were still talking cheerfully as if that danger was nothing, the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts felt even greater reverence and worship for them. What was an expert? This was it!

Such monsters were only capable of being united in unswerving loyalty by a monster amongst monsters like Long Chen.

“Despicable human race, you’ll pay a thousandfold for your actions!” roared the elder that Guo Ran had previously forced back.

“You’re noisy.” Guo Ran snorted and suddenly took out a crossbow. It lit up, and the elder hastily dodged to the side.

“Explode.”

The void exploded and rays of golden light shot through the air. All of a sudden, the elder let out a miserable cry. His whole body was covered in blood, which then quickly turned black. He pointed at Guo Ran, and his jaws moved a few times, releasing a few strange sounds before he collapsed.

Guo Ran put away his crossbow and shook his head. “I wish I could be low-key, but my power does not permit it.”

Another Heaven Merging expert was killed. Right now, the Martial Heaven Continent’s side felt like they had used up all their shock. They were starting to grow numb.

What was going on? Were these really the legendary Heaven Merging experts? Why was it that they were unable to endure in front of a few experts of the Dragonblood Legion? Were they useless, or were Guo Ran and the others too powerful?

“Amazing.” Even Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were surprised. The current Guo Ran was so powerful that he felt a bit foreign to them.

“Hehe, that old fellow was asking for death. If he hadn’t opened his mouth, I wouldn’t have wanted to kill him. My previous blow left him with quite a serious wound, thanks to all our brothers. With the power of ten thousand dragons flowing through his veins, his reactions were slowed. He himself was unaware of it until it was too late. Tell me, don’t you think he was asking me to kill him? I had no choice.” Guo Ran shrugged helplessly.

This explanation made Gu Yang and the others understand. They hadn’t expected such a thing to occur after going through the dragon pool’s baptism. Their combined power now actually had this added benefit.

“Guo Ran, when did you get so humble?” said Li Qi.

“Hehe, well this was all thanks to our brothers. Without them, I wouldn’t be anything. I’ll need more help from my brothers in the future,” chortled Guo Ran, the very picture of a petty person who had won.

Guo Ran’s own power was already extremely great. But with the support of the Dragonblood warriors, he was practically unrivaled.

Guo Ran was almost moved to tears from the feeling of being able to shatter the attacks of eight Heaven Merging experts. Thinking about it, he felt like he had reached the peak of his life.

“This humbleness of yours feels a bit strange,” laughed Gu Yang.

Guo Ran said, “Boss said that matured wheat droops, only withered wheat is so arrogant as to stand up straight. A full bottle doesn’t make noise, only a half-full bottle clatters. Now I finally understand how great the difference between myself and boss was. I still have a long way to go-”

“Someone’s coming from the Blood race!” Gu Yang suddenly pointed, causing Guo Ran to shut his mouth and look.

Guo Ran jumped. All the Blood race’s experts were kneeling. Guo Ran had an urge to say that they were kneeling to him, but when he saw the direction they were facing, he was no longer in the mood.

Even the Heaven Merging elders were kneeling, their faces pale. It seemed that they were terrified.

A blood sun appeared from deep within the Yin Yang World. Right now, screams rang out from the Martial Heaven Continent’s side as some people’s eyes began to bleed.

“Those below Netherpassage, don’t look at that sun! Don’t even think about using your souls to sense it either!” shouted a sect leader.

At this moment, the blood sun had reached the entrance to the Yin Yang World. It illuminated the battlefield, releasing demonic blood qi that wove through the air like strands of Sword Qi.

“Who is that?!” Guo Ran was shocked. Even before even seeing the person, this aura already filled the battlefield with such pressure that it was hard to breathe. Even though he had accompanied Long Chen in countless battles, he had never seen such a terrifying expert.

Gu Yang also turned grave as this aura was horrifying. Most shocking of all, it was still in the Netherpassage realm. In other words, such a terrifying existence had the same cultivation base as them.

“Even boss doesn’t have such a powerful aura. Just who is it?” Li Qi gulped. This aura was something that made others feel so terrified that they couldn’t even muster the courage to lift a finger.

Seven figures appeared around the blood sun, and an explosion of startled cries rang out.

“Seven Sovereign sprouts!”

Those seven people’s auras were clearly on the level of Sovereign sprouts. The seven of them respectfully stood to the side, as if welcoming someone.

After that, a figure appeared within the blood sun. The figure was unclear but seemed to be humanoid and sitting cross-legged. Despite that, he still gave off a feeling of unmatched terror.

“Greetings Devil Lord!”

The Heaven Merging elders kowtowed, their voices shuddering. It was unknown if it was from emotion or terror.

In an instant, a blood-colored light flew out and five heads flew into the air. Those remaining Heaven Merging elders were all killed in one move.
