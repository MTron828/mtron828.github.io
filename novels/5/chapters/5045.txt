Chapter 5034 Crushing Zhao Qingtian

Ye Lingxiao’s death stunned everyone, and Zhao Qingtian, trapped on the martial stage, quivered in fright. At this moment, he realized Long Chen had always been disguising himself as a pig to eat the tiger.

Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao had initially been sent to hunt down what they thought was an easy target. Both had their own trump cards and believed they could effortlessly kill Long Chen. To be safe, the Ye and Zhao clans had sent them both together. This should have been a flawless plan, but things had fallen to this point.

Ye Lingxiao had revealed his strongest trump card, even sacrificing his life to unleash the Lingfeng Sword’s full power, only to be slain by a single slash of Long Chen’s saber.

In fact, Ye Lingxiao was quite unlucky. Long Chen’s dragon blood power now contained a trace of sacred Sovereign might, and it had suppressed Ye Lingfeng’s power. Although the suppression wasn’t significant, it was enough to result in the destruction of both Ye Lingfeng and his sword.

If Ye Lingxiao were still alive, perhaps Zhao Qingtian would have the ability to fight Long Chen by joining forces with Ye Lingxiao. However, now that Ye Lingxiao was dead, Zhao Qingtian was terrified.

From ancient times until now, Zhao Qingtian had always controlled other people’s life and death. This was his first time being so close to death, and he was finally afraid. Standing there, he couldn’t help but tremble.

This scene caused Gui Jiu, Long Ziwei, and the others to look down on him. Just as Long Chen had told them, they shouldn’t idolize these so-called experts. In the face of death, these cowards had less courage than normal people.

They shouldn’t envy people for their privileged birth and grand family background. With no sense of danger, when disaster struck, they wouldn’t even recognize it, and death would be upon them.

They also shouldn’t envy geniuses for their ability to bully everyone else, because bad people would always be dealt with by other bad people. Sooner or later, someone worse than them would put them in their place.

Everything Long Chen had told them came true right before their eyes. A powerful heavenly genius like Zhao Qingtian was even more afraid than anyone when death came for him, as it had never happened before.

“It seems you need my help!” said Long Chen when he saw Zhao Qingtian’s terrified appearance.

“People like you always take other people’s lives like they’re worthless, but when it’s your turn, you’re more terrified than anyone. I don’t see a trace of your so-called courage now.”

With Evilmoon on his shoulder, Long Chen started walking toward Zhao Qingtian.

“It’s not over!”

Zhao Qingtian gritted his teeth, and a blood-colored rune appeared on his Heavenly Fate Disk. The moment this “Earth” character appeared, Zhao Qingtian’s bloodline power vanished without a trace. He had actually sacrificed his very bloodline.

Suddenly, the world of yellow earth vanished, absorbed by the rune behind him. The martial stage returned to its former appearance.

“Die! Heaven Earth Dominates the Heavens!” Zhao Qingtian roared. As he swung his glaive, his Heavenly Fate Disk directly appeared on top of it.

This was Zhao Qingtian’s suicidal attack, one that he put everything into. Its aura did not lose out to Ye Lingfeng’s final attack. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, in front of this suicidal attack, Long Chen didn’t use Split the Heavens. He simply swung Evilmoon horizontally.

BOOM!

A qi wave erupted, but there was no terrifying explosion like what people had expected. This seemingly overwhelming attack seemed more like empty bravado, only destroying seven of the barriers.

People were baffled as they saw Evilmoon block Zhao Qingtian’s glaive. Zhao Qingtian was clenching his teeth with a twisted expression.

Looking at him, Long Chen said, “You are terrified inside. Your anger and savagery are only there to cover up your fear. You don’t want to die, nor do you have the courage to throw your life away to kill me. You know that if you really did launch your full, final attack, you would be dead afterward, or at least crippled. That’s why you intentionally held back at the end. You are a coward. You are too conflicted in front of death. You might put on a tough appearance, but you are simply a worthless coward.”

Zhao Qingtian’s face twitched repeatedly. He wanted to keep acting furious, but he couldn’t. He was too afraid.

BOOM!

Long Chen suddenly pressed down with his saber, forcing Zhao Qingtian to his knees. Zhao Qingtian grunted and shuddered, his bones about to shatter.

“Please... don’t kill me...” begged Zhao Qingtian, his voice quivering with terror, barely able to speak under Long Chen’s oppressive strength.

This scene caused countless people to sigh and shake their heads. This was a peak heavenly genius? In front of death, he was weak, causing those who had worshipped him to feel perturbed.

Long Chen shook his head, his voice icy. “Obviously I won’t do that. If our roles were switched and I were the one begging for mercy, would you let me off? No, you would humiliate me as much as you could before ending me. You would then flaunt my corpse to show off...”

Suddenly, Zhao Qingtian spat out blood. Long Chen’s saber pressed down like a mountain, threatening to crush him. It seemed that his bones were about to explode.

At this point, he couldn’t even beg for mercy. The moment he tried to speak, Evilmoon would crush him to death.

Outside the martial stage, the Zhao clan’s experts were like ants in a boiling pot. But what could they do? They had set up the martial stage with a failsafe: all four keys were needed simultaneously to release it. But gathering the keys in time to save Zhao Qingtian seemed impossible.

Even if they could open the martial stage instantly, it would be meaningless. Zhao Qingtian was already at Long Chen’s mercy, and Long Chen had the freedom to end his life without interference.

“Is Long Chen planning to use Zhao Qingtian to blackmail the Zhao clan into opening the barriers?” asked Jiang Wuwang, looking at Feng Fei. He was now fully convinced by Feng Fei’s vision. After all, Feng Fei had shown an uncanny understanding of Long Chen’s intentions.

Shaking her head, Feng Fei replied, “It doesn’t look like it. Long Chen wants to kill Zhao Qingtian.”

The Zhao clan's experts were in a frenzy, with some shouting threats at Long Chen and others pleading for mercy. But Long Chen paid them no heed.

The Zhao clan leader suddenly looked outside the martial stage. With a wave of his hand, the Zhao clan’s experts disappeared.

Moments later, they reappeared, forming a massive circle around Qin Feng and the mercenaries.

The Zhao clan leader shouted, “Long Chen, release Zhao Qingtian, or they all die!”
