Chapter 4487 A Hard Battle

BOOM!

Long Chen’s lightning spear pierced through the void, but this mysterious expert employed some technique that rendered him illusory. As the void was pierced through, he simply vanished, sending shivers through everyone’s heart. He was practically a ghost, completely untraceable.

Amongst the spectators, Yue Zifeng was clenching the hilt of his sword, staring at a certain spot in the void. The veins on the back of his hand protruded, conveying his readiness to strike at a moment’s notice.

This was Yue Zifeng’s first time being so tense in a long while. After all, this mysterious figure was absolutely terrifying, causing Yue Zifeng to feel worried for Long Chen.

BOOM!

The lightning spear flew and pierced the spot that Yue Zifeng had been staring at.

The void repeatedly exploded as one hole after another was blasted into it. However, people only saw Long Chen, not that mysterious expert.

People got goosebumps. An invisible enemy was like a blade pressing against their throats at all times, exuding immense pressure.

“What new Sage King, you’re only-”

BOOM!

Just as a cold sneer rang out, Long Chen’s spear pierced the void again. However, this time, his power was many times greater, causing lightning to fill the sky.

Being hit by it, the translucent figure finally reappeared. At this moment, millions of Seven Peak Swords condensed behind Long Chen and shot toward him.

“Supreme Blood Ignition, Ten Thousand Swords Fly!” Long Chen roared. Through his probing blows, Long Chen finally grasped an opening, and the timing of his attack was so perfect that the translucent figure could not dodge.

“Lifehunter Spirit Slash!” the translucent figure snorted. All of a sudden, the space behind him collapsed, forming a waterfall-like whirlpool that erupted with terrifying Doyen power.

“He’s a Doyen!” Startled cries rang out. The translucent figure was finally forced to show his real power. It turned out that he was an absolutely terrifying Doyen, and his Doyen power was many times stronger than Netherdragon Tianzhao’s.

It was now evident that this mysterious expert didn’t just rely on his bizarre assassination arts to sneak into the academy. It wasn’t just skill; he wielded terrifying power as well.

The sword in his hand suddenly became straight and sucked the enormous whirlpool behind him. A ray of light then shot out from the tip, intercepting the barrage of Seven Peak Swords hurtling toward him.

BOOM!

An immense explosion rocked the world. It was the first time since the battle started that the two exchanged a head-on attack.

The High Firmament Academy’s grand formations were all activated now. The terrifying astral winds made those formations creak as if they might shatter at any moment.

Even the disciples felt suffocated while they were protected by the formations. For some of the weaker disciples, it felt as if their souls were being torn apart, and they clutched their heads in pain.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

A dragon claw stretched out of Long Chen’s divine ring. In response, the mysterious figure snorted, and a strange red light appeared in his eyes. Uttering incomprehensible syllables, he merged with his sword and swiftly propelled himself toward the dragon claw like a bolt of lightning.

With his eye as the core, numerous blood-colored runes cascaded across him, forming the silhouette of a tall and slender man. Colliding with the dragon claw, he seamlessly transitioned back into translucence. After that, blood-colored light ignited on his sword, merging his bloodline power into the blade.

BOOM!

A scene that shocked everyone occurred. The sword instantly pierced through the immense dragon claw and continued onward to Long Chen’s chest.

Startled cries echoed as Long Chen’s formidable Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw was shattered. The sword was already right at his chest.

Ignoring the imminent threat, Long Chen recklessly thrust his lightning spear toward the man’s chest. The onlookers’ hearts now clenched in anxiety.

Even the Dragonblood warriors’ expressions changed. This mysterious expert was absolutely terrifying, surpassing their understanding. Compared to him, Netherdragon Tianzhao was trash, unfit to even carry his shoes.

Everyone held their breaths, as time seemed to flow slowly. Two weapons steadily closed in on one another, moving at an identical pace. Meanwhile, Long Chen and the translucent figure were staring at each other coldly, devoid of the slightest emotion.

Just as the sword was about to pierce Long Chen’s chest, that person’s pupils shrank. He suddenly changed the course of his sword, stabbing it into Long Chen’s lightning spear.

BOOM!

The lightning spear detonated with a deafening explosion. Black lightning then surged forth, unleashing a formidable and destructive aura that instantly obliterated the surrounding buildings. The impact crushed the academy’s grand formations and sent the disciples behind the barrier flying.

“Saint power?!”

Xia Chen and the others were taken aback. Long Chen’s lightning spear actually contained the power of a Saint. However, Xia Chen didn’t know just how much stronger it was compared to his Saint talisman.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

That translucent figure coughed up blood, finally solidifying and revealing his true appearance. A short-haired man with pockmarks on his face stood before Long Chen and the others. Clad in gray armor, this man was skinny like a beanpole. His right hand was entirely gone, with blood flowing down his armor.

Seeing his true appearance, everyone didn’t fear him as much. After all, what people feared the most was the unknown. Once it was visible, the fear factor somewhat diminished.

Despite losing an arm, the Lifehunter expert didn’t panic and coldly remarked, “I didn’t expect you to have such a move. If I hadn’t reacted fast enough, I would have been the one to die.”

Just now, he had been willing to go through with that suicidal exchange, confident that he could slay Long Chen while, at worst, sustaining a severe injury.

However, as Long Chen’s lightning spear was about to pierce the Lifehunter expert, the latter’s soul suddenly quivered. His innate assassin instincts then kicked in, causing him to make a swift change in tactics—an instinct that proved uncannily accurate. The lightning spear imbued with Saint power had been set to detonate in advance. If the Lifehunter expert hadn't evaded in time, he wouldn’t have survived.

After devouring the corpses of so many Saints, the primal chaos space released the Saints’ tribulation lightning around. Although it was only a small amount, after being absorbed by Lei Linger, it was more than enough to kill this expert.

“Even if you react fast, it won’t alter the outcome. You’ll still die today,” declared Long Chen.

This time, Lei Linger didn't conceal her power. The formidable aura of a Saint was unleashed as Long Chen launched another attack.
