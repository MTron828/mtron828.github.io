Chapter 4088 Dragon Spirit Blessing

When the spiritual qi of heaven and earth was absorbed by the divine ring, the dragon-shaped runes in Long Chen’s body began to slowly awaken. Gradually, an invigorating force surged through his body, akin to a bottomless supply of energy.

Long Chen had refrained from cultivation for a long time, and thus, the profound impact of this phenomenon caught him off guard, leaving him in a state of awe and wonder.

“The Nirvana Overflow Heaven is ranked second within the nine heavens. It is currently the world with the most perfectly preserved Heavenly Daos. In the Darklight Heaven and the Violet Flame Heaven, due to the Heavenly Daos being incomplete, your cultivation speed is limited. It is a bad thing, but also a good thing. It might have slowed down your advancement rate, but the good thing is even with the incomplete Heavenly Daos, you could still merge with the power of heaven and earth, which causes your body to thirst for the complete Heavenly Daos without you even being aware of it. Now that you are in this world with the complete Heavenly Daos, your body will rapidly assimilate the power of the Heavenly Daos, drawing you closer to them and increasing your rate of advancement. This is an advantage that the native experts here do not possess. The path of cultivation is like a race, so no one loses at the starting line. Just like that, running fast might not necessarily be a good thing, and running slow might not be a bad thing. In the end, what matters is how far you can run. As for you, you have always been too impatient, always running with your life on the line. It makes it easy for you to miss important things,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen had been constantly trying to increase his cultivation speed and had no time to stabilize his base. This was a problem he had from the start.

“I can’t do anything else. Fate is like an invisible hand forcing me forward, and there’s a boulder behind it chasing me. The moment I pause, it will crush me to death. What else can I do? I wish I could slack off too,” said Long Chen sullenly.

The dragon expert didn’t reply, but Long Chen suddenly said, “Senior, why don’t you tell me about the Nine Star Master? Let me see a bit further, so I can plan my own future. Just like you said, I should follow the set order.”

“Give it up. Just pretend I didn’t say anything just now. Don’t try to dredge anything out of me.”

“...”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Long Chen had tried to get the dragon expert to divulge more secrets relating to the nine star lines many times, but the dragon expert’s mouth was air-tight. It didn’t let a single word slip.

Since the dragon expert refused to speak, Long Chen simply continued to absorb spiritual qi.

His body was like a dry riverbed greedily absorbing the rain. After receiving the nourishment of the spiritual qi, Long Chen felt like his body had become a part of heaven and earth.

Long Chen had never had such a feeling before, so he was pleasantly surprised. He felt like he had reached the realm of merging with heaven and earth, the realm belonging to Heaven Venerates.

“Senior, have I reached the height of a Heaven Venerate in advance?”

At this moment, Long Chen felt close to heaven and earth, as though their energy would follow his will. This energy was now swirling around his body.

When Long Chen extended a hand, Heavenly Dao energy instantly covered it. That feeling of having the world move as he pleased was beautiful.

“That is the dragon spirit blessing of the Heavenly Daos. When the dragon blood eggs first formed, they went to slumber. That is one reason I wanted you to wait; it was for the slumber to finish. The dragon blood eggs have now become dragon spirit eggs with the nourishment of the spiritual qi of heaven and earth, receiving special care from heaven and earth. Because of that, you naturally can control the power of the Heavenly Daos, and the feeling you have now does share commonalities with the power of Heaven Venerates. The only difference is the strength. Although my dragon race receives special favors from heaven and earth, we don't cultivate magical arts. Thus, even this special care will not provide you much help during battle, as it is only used to rapidly strengthen the physical body. As for using it in battle, I’ve never even thought of it. You can test it out yourself,” said the dragon expert.

Only then did Long Chen realize that it was the effect of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. Even so, he was delighted.

Looking inside his body, he found that the dragon blood eggs had become golden and translucent. He then saw strange runes within them.

After three days of secluded cultivation, an explosive sound came from within his body, shaking the void. The next moment, giant cracks spread in every direction.

The training room that Long Chen occupied quaked, its sturdy walls fracturing. At this moment, countless formations were blown apart, and the ceiling disintegrated, giving way to a golden pillar of light that soared into the sky.

After that, a majestic dragon cry resounded throughout heaven and earth, a sign that Long Chen had advanced to the first Heavenstage of the Immortal King realm.

However, the disturbance was so great that Long Chen himself was stunned. This was a top tier training room, but it was still blown apart.

At this time, Yu Qingxuan, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others ran in to see what was going on.

When they saw Long Chen’s cultivation base, they instantly understood. Thus, seeing the state of his cultivation room, they got even more excited.

“Boss, you advanced to the first Heavenstage, but you already caused such a disturbance! Hehe, boss really is the boss. Now, we’ll dominate the Nirvana Overflow Heaven,” chuckled Guo Ran.

The stronger Long Chen was, the more excited they grew. He had just reached the first Heavenstage but already caused such a terrifying qi wave. In the future, just how powerful would their boss grow?

Having recovered from his shock, Long Chen hastily apologized to the Huayun Trading Company. Fortunately, the guild master simply laughed him off and praised him for being powerful. The aura that erupted from him advancing to the first Heavenstage was comparable to when others advanced to the Earth Venerate realm.

With this, Long Chen felt even more embarrassed, and he swore inside not to keep cultivating in this kind of training room.

After advancing to the first Heavenstage, Long Chen felt like he had become one with the Dao. With every move of his, the power of the Heavenly Daos followed him, and he had a constant supply of energy. It was a wonderful feeling.

Long Chen even had a feeling that he would be able to fight directly against Heaven Venerates. The current him was completely different.

Although it was just the first Heavenstage, Long Chen could feel the power of the Heavenly Daos working with him, something that had never occurred before. Thus, it filled him with confidence.

“Guild master, thank you for your care the past few days.” Long Chen bowed to the guild master.

“Mister Long Chen, are you…?!”

“Yes. We’re leaving.”

“Are you sure? The Soaring Dragon Company and the Shadow race are waiting for you!” The guild master’s expression changed.

“The path of cultivation is originally one where you must face difficulties head-on. You cannot retreat. If they want me, I can’t let them wait too long.”

No matter how the guild master urged Long Chen to stay, Long Chen had made his determination. So, he directly left the gates of the Huayun Trading Company.

Seeing this scene, the guild master hastily alerted the higher-ups. In his opinion, by going out like this, Long Chen had signed his own death warrant.

Furthermore, as soon as Long Chen walked out, he felt several subtle fluctuations. As a result, a sinister smile appeared on his face.

“I’ll be able to get some practice now.”
