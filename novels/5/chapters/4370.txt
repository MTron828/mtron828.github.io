Chapter 4359 Unrivaled Dragonblood Legion

“What? How can he receive the attack of an Eternal expert?”

“How can this be? Even if his armor was an Eternal divine item, it wouldn’t be able to do that!”

“Indeed, the Eternal divine item would be undamaged, but he would be killed just by the shockwaves transmitted through it!”

Seeing that Guo Ran was completely fine, everyone was stunned, especially the Eternal expert who had just struck him.

No matter how formidable a set of armor might be, it couldn't fully nullify an Eternal expert's strength. Even a fraction of an Eternal expert's attack would be enough to annihilate the wearer through the armor.

However, Guo Ran wasn’t injured at all. Moreover, his tone was full of contempt and disdain, as if he didn’t place Eternal experts in his eyes.

“Courting death!” the attacking Eternal expert roared, summoning his manifestation—a Vajra Ape—behind him. After manifesting his true body, an enormous hand extended toward Guo Ran.

Guo Ran appeared incredibly minuscule in front of that enormous hand. He was ensnared within the grip of the Eternal expert, and veins throbbed on the expert's hand as he clenched.

This Eternal expert wanted to directly crush Guo Ran. The spectators’ hearts tightened in response to Guo Ran's apparent arrogance as he made no attempt to dodge.

Long Chen sneered upon seeing this. It seemed that the Vajra Ape’s brain wasn’t very good. In his giant form, no matter how great his power was, how could he unleash it properly?

For example, crushing an egg with a hand might be easy. However, how would you crush a sesame seed in the same way? There was no way to utilize your force effectively.

The Vajra Ape’s fist creaked as he exerted all his power, as if attempting to concentrate his entire strength within this one fist.

Suddenly, a streak of golden light flew out of the back of his hand, penetrating it and causing a lot of blood to spray out.

“AHH!” the Vajra Ape screamed in pain. Following that, the streak of golden light suddenly shot toward his head.

It was incredibly fast, so fast that the Vajra Ape didn’t even have time to react.

BOOM!

The impact smacked the Vajra Ape down to the ground, and only then did people realize that the source of the golden light was Guo Ran in his armor.

However, unlike before, Guo Ran now had a pair of golden wings on his back, and they were somewhat similar to Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings. Of course, Guo Ran had crafted them based on Long Chen’s wings.

While these wings might be a level below Long Chen’s in terms of speed, the runes Guo Ran had integrated into them granted not only remarkable speed but also formidable killing power.

“Eternal experts are only at this level I suppose.” Guo Ran stood in the air, looking unspeakably arrogant in his shiny armor.

“You… go fuck yourself!”

The Vajra Ape was still dazed from the previous blow, and a hill-like bump slowly rose on his forehead. Enraged, he sent a furious kick at Guo Ran.

The Vajra Ape’s kick created a whirlwind-like gust. However, the energetic kick hit nothing at all as Guo Ran instantly dodged, causing the Vajra Ape to stagger from the force of his own kick.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Guo Ran’s wings propelled him in a beautiful golden arc through the air, and he once more collided with the Vajra Ape’s head. Furthermore, he accurately struck that bloody bump once more.

BANG!

The Vajra Ape was sent stumbling backward. However, before he could fall, a streak of golden light struck him in the back of his head.

BANG!

Now, the Vajra Ape was sent reeling forward, and another bloody bump rose on the back of his head.

Furious roars came from it as it started to crazily swat and try to grab Guo Ran. However, Guo Ran was too fast. Like a shooting star, he was flying back and forth. His goal was obvious. He would either be striking the front of the Vajra Ape’s head or the back of it.

No matter how the Vajra Ape tried to dodge or defend, he was unable to stop Guo Ran’s attacks from landing. In no time at all, two horns of flesh quickly sprouted from its head.

However, unlike others with horns on the sides of their faces, the Vajra Ape's horns protruded from the front and back, creating a bizarre and somewhat comedic sight.

Everyone could see that the Vajra Ape was not a match for Guo Ran. Guo Ran was intentionally targeting those two spots because he was playing around. If Guo Ran wanted to kill him, he’d already be dead.

Ignoring everything else about Guo Ran, just his speed alone rendered this Eternal expert powerless. This was particularly evident in the expert's true form. While his power was formidable in this state, his movements became clumsy. No matter how strong he was, it meant nothing if he couldn’t hit his opponent.

The Vajra Ape quickly realized what was wrong and returned to his humanoid form. However, even when he reverted, Guo Ran still managed to beat him black and blue.

Guo Ran’s fists danced as he used his entire body as a weapon. Covered in flawlessly merged Eternal divine weapons, Guo Ran used this perfect formation to unleash his full power. Following that, as he got increasingly adept with his newfound power, he started to view his opponent as a suitable sparring partner for practice.

While Guo Ran dominated his enemy until the latter couldn’t fight back, on the other battlefield, Gu Yang had managed to force his opponent back, inflicting numerous wounds on the Eternal expert.

In the midst of surrounding conflicts, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan were controlling earth giants against their foes, engaging in a raw competition of earth energy against Eternal energy. These battles lacked finesse, with earth giants breaking apart and opponents left battered and bloody.

However, from all the battlefields, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s battles appeared the most satisfying as this was a pure competition of power.

On Bai Shishi’s side, the concentrated metal energy in her sword compelled her opponent to repeatedly retreat from the outset. As a result, her opponent was forced to passively defend without the slightest chance to counterattack.

Meanwhile, countless talismans whirled around Xia Chen. Heaven-shaking explosions would occasionally ring out, accompanied by furious roars, but the talismans blocked other people’s view. Yet, judging on the intensity of those roars and the scent of terror, they knew that Xia Chen had taken the upper hand.

When they looked again at Yue Zifeng’s side, a sudden, abruptly halted scream pierced the air.

His opponent’s wings had been cut off. Following that, Yue Zifeng resheathed his sword as his opponent’s enormous body slowly split into two halves.

Yue Zifeng had made a name for himself during the Sage King Convention and was called the strongest sword cultivator of the junior generation. Now, he demonstrated his power by cutting off his opponent’s strongest part—their wings and then killed them in one blow. The astonishing nature of this spectacle left everyone in awe, even though they witnessed it firsthand.

Yue Zifeng was clearly too powerful. After cutting off his opponent’s wings, he didn’t want to fight any longer and directly ended this meaningless battle.

The onlookers simply watched as Yue Zifeng walked over to Long Chen, then they looked at the calm Long Chen, thinking that perhaps only a monster like Long Chen could command the allegiance of a peerless talent such as Yue Zifeng.

“After watching for so long, have you given up?! Or have you pissed yourself in fright?!” Long Chen suddenly shouted into the distance.
