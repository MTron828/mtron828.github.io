Chapter 2772 Emperor Mo Nian

“What are they doing?!” Startled cries rang out. Their enemies were now killing their own people?

The High Priest sighed. “They truly are ruthless. We aren’t fighting them in order to slow down the blood soul energy absorption of their altars, so they brought out lifeforms from their own worlds to slaughter.”

“Wealth God, bless them with your protection. Don’t let them reincarnate there again,” prayed Ma Ruyun, unable to bear watching this but helpless to stop the slaughter.

For their goals, these experts were willing to do anything. With the lack of blood soul energy, their solution was to kill fellow members of their own races.

Some of the weaker lifeforms had yet to reach the Xiantian realm, but they were still sent over as lambs for the slaughter. This scene was one from hell.

Even though they were enemies, people couldn’t help feeling anger to see these lifeforms being slaughtered. But they also felt profoundly powerless.

Ma Ruyun, the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the other experts who had lived for so long had essentially had their cultivation bases solidified. They could only guard and watch what was happening.

Curiously, Ling Yunzi also didn’t cultivate. He just watched. It seemed that this scene was unable to cause his emotions to stir.

Other than them, the majority of the continent’s experts were in meditative states, unaware of what was happening. They were focused on advancing as quickly as possible.

Within the barrier, auras were erupting with every passing moment. After two hours, all of the Dragonblood Legion’s warriors advanced to the Venerate realm.

Furthermore, their auras were still continuing to climb. At this moment, Zi Yan, Mo Nian, and Ye Zhiqiu slowly awoke. The aura of Emperors swirled around them. They had advanced to the Emperor realm.

“Hahaha! I, Mo Nian, have become an Emperor! Ancestors of the Mo family, just watch me!” Mo Nian suddenly roared, unable to contain himself. “Ye Ming!”

Mo Nian suddenly charged out of the barrier. Seeing Ye Ming assaulting the barrier, he shot toward him.

Mo Nian knew that in every generation of the Martial Heaven Continent, only one person could possibly become a Sovereign, so becoming an Emperor was his limit. At this moment, he needed to fight for more time for Long Chen.

“Courting death!” Ye Ming’s fury soared. Seeing Mo Nian’s kick, he reached out to grab his foot.

BOOM! Mo Nian’s foot landed squarely on Ye Ming’s hand, causing Ye Ming’s body to shudder. However, he grabbed hold of his foot.

“Die!” Ye Ming sneered. Although Mo Nian’s power was extremely strong, he was just an Emperor. He still wasn’t a perfect match for Ye Ming.

However, just as he pulled, a sharp pain came from his cheek. Mo Nian’s Heaven Seizing Sun Hunting Bow had whipped across his face.

This technique was an imitation of Long Chen’s face-slapping art. With the longbow, it was much more convenient. With the kick to lay the groundwork, this bow slap was very well done.

As a result, Ye Ming’s face was badly lacerated. His head looked like it had been split open. Since he couldn’t see or hear anything, he naturally let go.

Mo Nian pulled back his foot and then unleashed a kick with his other foot, striking Ye Ming’s nose and sending him flying.

“Idiot, even now you only have a melon seed rolling in your head,” sneered Mo Nian. He had seen Long Chen’s fight against Ye Ming and clearly saw that other than having the power of a Sovereign, Ye Ming’s weaknesses were all the same as before.

After kicking him away, Mo Nian’s bow bent like a crescent moon, and an arrow shot out like a shooting star. After all, he wasn’t Long Chen. He wasn’t skilled in close-range combat. Hence, after getting an advantage, he immediately stopped. Otherwise, a slip-up would result in him being buried here. Knowing exactly how much to show off before retreating was the true wisdom of a hero.

At this moment, Ye Ming roared and punched Mo Nian’s arrow. It exploded, leaving his hand bloody. Ye Ming furiously cursed, “Bastard!”

Mo Nian was truly evil. That had been no ordinary arrow but an exploding arrow. Mo Nian had accurately predicted that in his current rage, Ye Ming wouldn’t dodge. He would definitely block it head-on to win back his face. But the arrow then exploded and bloodied his hand, further incensing him.

“Guo Ran’s wares really are top-notch,” praised Mo Nian. This exploding arrow was made with hundreds of different immortal metals, and there was a formation carved inside of it. Even Ye Ming who was now a Sovereign couldn’t ignore it.

“Tch, you, the idiot who became Sovereign, today I’ll show the world how I, Mo Nian, beat you! Remember the glory of how I fought across realms to defeat a Sovereign!”

Mo Nian waved his hand. At this moment, Ye Zhiqiu flew out with the Northern Source Sword, and Wilde charged at Ye Ming with the Western Desert Ax. All three of them attacked Ye Ming from different directions.

“You shameless bastard, didn’t you say you were fighting one against one?!” roared Ye Ming.

Mo Nian sneered, “Idiot, when did I say that? I said that I would beat you. Did I say anything about not having any helpers? Wow, a Sovereign is actually afraid of the three of us? You really are the most useless Sovereign I’ve ever seen. You were already slapped and kicked around by Long Chen. He made you flee like a rat. Now against three Emperors, you’re so scared that you want to fight one against one? Do you still have any face? Compared to the five Sovereigns of the Martial Heaven Continent, you’re simply an embarrassment. I won’t make things hard on you. I’ll give you a chance to simply kill yourself right here!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I… I’ll kill you!”

Ye Ming shuddered with rage at Mo Nian’s shamelessness. He was clearly using numbers but still made it sound so dignified. However, despite it all clearly being nonsense, Ye Ming wasn’t able to find a way to counter with words.

Ye Ming’s bone spear once more appeared. This time, the bone spear was even more demonic. It seemed that it was also absorbing blood soul energy from those being slain.

Ye Ming charged toward Mo Nian with Resentful Death City quivering behind him. However, he had just stepped forward when Wilde viciously hacked the Western Desert Ax at him.

“Scram!” roared Ye Ming.

BOOM!

Wilde was sent tumbling back, but Ye Ming’s arms turned numb. Wilde’s physical power had exceeded the realm of common sense.

While everyone else was cultivating, Wilde hadn’t cultivated, not like he knew how to. All he sensed was endless energy filling his body, and it was even faster than when he ate meat.

The Martial Heaven Continent had silently absorbed the Blood Qi in the air and sent it into his body, making his physical body absolutely terrifying.

“Again!”

What shocked and further enraged Ye Ming was that even before his numb arms recovered, Wilde was already hacking the Western Desert Ax toward him.
