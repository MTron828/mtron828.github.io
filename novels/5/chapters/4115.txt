No one had expected the seventh uncle to be so resolute and unyielding as to directly kill himself.

However, the instant he made his move, a powerful hand caught his wrist.

“Leader!”

Cries of relief rang out from the crowd. The race leader had stopped him just in time.

Although he was fast, there was still a bloody hole on the seventh uncle’s forehead. Fortunately, the race leader had managed to block the power from erupting.

“Seventh uncle, are you forcing me to use our race’s rules to discipline you?!” raged the race leader. “As a pillar of the Fullmoon race, your life is not your own. It belongs to the Fullmoon race. Who gave you the guts to throw your life away so easily?”

“Leader, I admit my mistakes. Please punish me,” said the seventh uncle shamefully.

The race leader took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. “Take your seat.”

“Yes.”

The seventh uncle respectfully bowed before returning to his spot.

“I am not telling you these things to shift the blame or flaunt my contributions. I am telling you that the intelligence of our ancestors is not something that any of us can compare to. Our vision cannot possibly reach further than our ancestors. I was originally in seclusion, but when Long Chen arrived in the Fullmoon race, I was awoken by the ancestral spirit totem. That’s the only reason I arrived in time,” said the race leader.

“What…?” Everyone was startled by this. They were all well aware that the race leader had been in seclusion. “Could it be…?”

The race leader nodded. “I didn’t know why the ancestral spirit totem would alert me at first. After I ferreted out those traitors, I tried to ask the ancestral spirit totem to kill them, but it didn’t even react. Clearly, it didn’t appear for those traitors, but for Long Chen and the others.”

After he said this, all the experts present were filled with disbelief. He continued, “I also don’t know why the ancestral spirit totem would react to Long Chen’s arrival, but our ancestor’s warning cannot be wrong. Also, I already spoke to Changchuan, and he has awakened the Fullmoon race’s strongest manifestation.”

“Could it be…?!”

“Changchuan is the hope for the Fullmoon race’s rise. Without Long Chen, Changchuan would have been killed by the traitors’ sinister schemes. Since he survives, it means that the Fullmoon race’s karmic luck is still protecting and guiding him. If Long Chen was someone who would endanger our race, the ancestral spirit totem definitely wouldn’t just ignore him. So… you should understand!” said the race leader.

Everyone immediately nodded. The reason they were against Xu Changchuan’s promise to Long Chen was because they were afraid of working together with the human race.

However, the ancestral spirit totem was the foundation of their faith. They would never doubt the ancestral spirit totem’s decisions.

“Don’t worry, we will still keep an eye on Long Chen. After all, we won’t leave our fates to others. The Fullmoon race’s fate ultimately rests in our own hands,” said the race leader.

After hearing all these, the Fullmoon race’s experts all relaxed. Most of their hostility toward Long Chen also faded.

Just like that, Long Chen and the others were allowed to enter the Fullmoon race. That very day, Xu Changchuan led them on a tour throughout the Fullmoon race’s domain. This place was called the Silver Moon World by them.

The spiritual qi in this place was incredibly dense, even denser than the Huayun Trading Company’s special training rooms.

Feeling the density, Yu Qingxuan, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran were all envious. Here, whether it was for refining pills, forging items, or inscribing talismans, the natural spiritual qi would make it much easier for them.

Normally, they could only cram themselves in small spaces specially made for such things, but that left them cut off from the limitless world. Like that, they couldn’t truly sense the Heavenly Daos. Although the high level training rooms had a miniature version of the Heavenly Daos injected into them, such an artificial thing couldn’t compare to the real thing.

After that, Xia Chen joked about renting a place from the Fullmoon race, offering to pay whatever price they wanted as rent.

Xu Changchuan was extremely embarrassed by the joke. After all, according to the rules, the Fullmoon race did not mix with any other races.

After they finished seeing the countless wonders of the Silver Moon World, Xu Changchuan led them to a dark gate.

“Behind this gate is the life-forbidden area, and it can be considered a cursed land. Other than a few particular races, others cannot set foot in this region, or their longevity will be stripped away instantly. But don’t worry, you have been blessed by the ancestral spirit totem. For a hundred years, the curse of the life-forbidden area will not be able to threaten you. Let’s go take a look inside,” said Xu Changchuan.

With Xu Changchuan leading the way, they entered that dark gate. Once they were in, the dense spiritual qi around them instantly vanished, replaced with a sinister aura that sent shivers down their spines. Guo Ran and the others couldn’t help but tremble.

“The spiritual qi is about the same density as in the Silver Moon World. However, due to the chaotic laws, this spiritual qi cannot be absorbed. You can only feel chaos,” said Long Chen after sensing it for a while.

“I understand. Is the high density of spiritual qi in the Silver Moon World related to the blockade of the dark gate?” asked Xia Chen.

“Brother Xia, you are completely correct. This dark gate blocks the chaotic aura and lets the spiritual qi through, resulting in the Silver Moon World having a high concentration of spiritual qi. However, for my Fullmoon race’s cultivation, the spiritual qi requirements aren’t particularly high, so this high concentration is rather wasteful,” said Xu Changchuan with a bitter smile.

Guo Ran was about to ask what the Fullmoon race required to cultivate if it wasn’t mostly spiritual qi, but Xia Chen pulled him. Realizing that he almost slipped, Guo Ran swallowed his question. Asking about other people’s secret cultivation styles was a great taboo.

“Other than the Silver Moon World, our Fullmoon race also has a couple of other worlds. Those worlds were claimed by our previous, previous leader. I’ll bring you over.”

They were traversing a dark world. Here, time seemed to stand still, and space was constantly twisting. With everything in chaos, they were unable to even find the path beneath their feet, let alone their sense of direction.

It was extremely uncomfortable not having any sense of direction. Fortunately, they had Xu Changchuan guiding them. Otherwise, Long Chen and the others wouldn’t dare to walk around in this place. They might miss the exit.

They walked through this chaotic space for over two hours before they saw a gate ahead of them. When they walked in, their vision brightened and they saw a desolate world.

Even before they managed to get a good look at the world before them, they heard a furious roar that shook the land. An ear-piercing alarm then rang out.

“The dark creatures have launched an attack.” Xu Changchuan’s expression changed, and he instantly rushed over.
