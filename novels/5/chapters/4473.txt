Chapter 4462 Don’t Go Too Far

The nether dragon race had started to withdraw. The higher-ups left first, leaving behind a group to pick up the bodies of their fallen experts.

The nether dragon race wasn’t the only one to do this; other races also wanted to gather the bodies of their fallen kin. Although some of the corpses were in pieces, if they were identifiable, they needed to be salvaged. Allowing the remains of their people to rot in the wild was unthinkable.

Hence, Long Chen’s words enraged them. How could he forbid them from retrieving the corpses of their fallen?

The higher-ups of the nether dragon race hadn’t gone far, so the race leader roared at Long Chen furiously.

“What are you intending?!” he demanded.

“Is it not obvious? This entire battlefield is my spoils of war. Since you all wanted to take my life, you have to pay the price,” replied Long Chen coldly.

“We will not allow others to humiliate our martyrs! A warrior can be killed, but not humiliated—!”

The expert was cut off midway through his words as a hole appeared in his head, causing him to drop dead on the spot. Guo Ran lowered his crossbow, sneering.

“Idiots. You were the ones who chose to attack us. You should accept the consequences. Cannot handle the humiliation? Well, who can then? Stand out, and my Dragonblood Legion promises to only kill you, not humiliate you. You can all die in peace.”

Guo Ran sneered at those people. These idiots coming from various worlds could only be intimidated through power; there was no point in talking reason with them. If one tried, it would be like playing the zither for a bull.

Hearing Guo Ran’s response, those experts were startled and enraged but didn’t know what to do, so they looked at the nether dragon race. Since the nether dragon race had suffered the most casualties, they wanted to see how the nether dragon race would react to such insults.

“Long Chen, don’t go too far!” roared the nether dragon race leader. He didn’t know that Long Chen really needed these corpses and thought that Long Chen was simply intentionally trying to humiliate them.

“And if I do go too far, what will you do?” asked Long Chen indifferently.

The nether dragon race leader was so enraged that his hair stood on end. He then turned to the palace master and coldly said, “We’re all part of the dragon race. Are you going to let him commit such an outrageous act?”

The palace master curled his lips. “Traitors like you dare to call yourselves part of the dragon race? It would have been better if you didn’t mention the dragon race. That only makes me want to kill you. Before I change my mind, you better scram!”

The nether dragon race leader could do nothing but quiver with rage. Gritting his teeth, he then turned and left, accompanied by the remaining nether dragon race experts, all filled with anger.

Unable to recover the bodies of their fallen comrades, it was a monumental humiliation for the nether dragon race. Yet, they were powerless to resist.

Seeing the nether dragon race abandon their deceased, the other races were left with no choice but to suck it up. They didn’t even dare to gather the divine weapons that were scattered throughout the battlefield. The taste of defeat was bitter and tormenting.

“Clean up the battlefield! Hehehe, we made a killing this time!”

Even before their enemies were gone, Guo Ran and Xia Chen already shouted excitedly. They shot forward and started to go through the battlefield with the Dragonblood warriors.

Clearly, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were doing this intentionally to enrage those people. The latter were truly incensed, but they could do nothing. They could only quicken the pace to get out of here.

“Do you want to say goodbye?” In the distance, within the Jiang clan’s camp, Jiang Wenyu probed Feng Fei.

Feng Fei shook her head. “If you didn’t have the courage to help when he needed it, attempting to curry favor after his victory would only make you appear small. Not only would others look down on you, but you would look down on yourself as well.”

He wanted to play this move now? What was he doing beforehand? All of them had acted badass before, but now wanted to suck up? Other than losing face, what else would this accomplish?

Feng Fei truly understood Long Chen. At least, by maintaining distance now, perhaps he would still feel a bit better toward her. If she were to go over, that trace of good feeling would scatter with the wind.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Let’s go!”

Feng Fei gathered the Jiang clan’s people. In any case, they hadn’t come for nothing. Watching such a shocking battle had benefited everyone.

The Jiang clan’s heavenly geniuses had been extremely arrogant when they first arrived. Even Jiang Wenyu, who did his best to stay humble, could not hide that it had just been an act. He only reserved himself to compete for the position of the clan leader.

In truth, he was no different from the other two budding Doyens. His only good point was that he knew how to act a bit better.

After witnessing Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s battle, these arrogant fellows seemed to deflate. The shocking battle had shattered their confidence, letting them know that there was a qualitative difference between them.

The most significant blow to them was the realization that they not only fell short in comparison to Long Chen but also lagged behind Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Yue Zifeng, and other members of the Dragonblood Legion. Even the ordinary Dragonblood warriors surpassed them, leaving them feeling like frogs at the bottom of a well.

The Jiang clan’s elders also had mixed feelings but mostly deep regret. If they had helped Long Chen when he was weaker, they would have had a good relationship with him.

However, now that Long Chen had reached this level, even if the Jiang clan used all their might to form a good relationship with him, it would probably still be futile. Once an opportunity had passed, sometimes, there was just no way to mend things.

Just as Feng Fei was talking sense to everyone in the Jiang clan, she suddenly sensed something and turned back. She saw Long Chen staring at her and nodding ever so slightly.

Immediately, Feng Fei’s eyes reddened as she almost teared up, but she did her best to stop those tears and remain calm. She then nodded back to him and turned away.

When the Jiang clan’s disciples saw that, they were excited. One of them exclaimed, “Big Sister Feng Fei, why don’t you invite senior apprentice-brother Long Chen over as a guest of the Jiang clan!?”

“Scram!” Feng Fei shouted at that person, actually feeling angry. That disciple was so terrified that everyone shut their mouth and no longer made a sound.

Feng Fei felt a deep bitterness inside. The nod from Long Chen was a form of pity, and she knew it as well. They understood each other, and it was this understanding that formed a bond between them.

However, while she appreciated the goodwill, she also felt a mix of happiness and sadness. As someone with her own pride, she didn't want others to pity her. The sense of charity in that good feeling was something she found difficult to accept.

The bitterness in Feng Fei’s heart was known only by Long Chen. However, these disciples actually thought that Long Chen was expressing his fondness for her, and they wanted her to invite him over as a guest? Feng Fei was so enraged that she almost wept.

Once Feng Fei led the Jiang clan away, the other spectators also felt like it was time to leave.

With only their own people left on the battlefield, Long Chen’s mind sank into the primal chaos space. He was eager to savor the rewards of his hard-fought victory.
