Chapter 3444 The Divine Lightning Elder’s True Power

Outside the outermost barrier, the red devils were being sent flying one by one. It was as if some even more terrifying lifeforms had come, sweeping them away.

“What’s going on? Aren’t these devils above Immortal Kings?!” exclaimed people.

The outermost barrier was specifically to stop the strongest devils from entering. It only permitted those at the Immortal King realm and below to pass through. Outside that barrier, it was a land of absolute death. Even the higher-ups of the academy were not permitted to set foot there.

Just then, saber-light erupted, sending blood and flesh flying through the air. Those red devils were blown apart one by one, and their blood rained down.

BOOM!

Following that, a flame lotus exploded and a sea of fire erupted. Screams rang out as countless red devils were ignited.

“That flame lotus…”

“Isn’t that senior apprentice-brother Long Chen’s trump card, the World Extermination Flame Lotus?”

Saber-light flashed within the sea of flames, slaughtering those red devils. After that, a black-robed figure with a blood-red saber on his shoulder walked out of the flames.

“Heavens, it really is senior apprentice-brother Long Chen! No, it’s Dean Long Chen!”

When they saw that figure slaughtering the devils with ease, startled cries rang out. It was precisely Long Chen.

Long Chen had long since reached the outer edges of the academy. However, it had taken him almost an hour to slaughter his way over to the barrier. Now, he didn’t even know how many of those red devils he had killed. If his sense of direction wasn’t so good, he might have gotten lost amongst them.

When he saw the barrier, he blessed his fortune that he hadn’t gone in the wrong direction. There were even more red devils in front of the barrier, tearing at it. But the barrier was extremely tough. They were unable to get a foothold in it.

Hence, when Long Chen appeared, they took out their frustration on him, only for his divine ring to appear. He then slaughtered his way through them just like that. When his saber swung through the air, the red devils collapsed. Putting his saber back on his shoulder, he took a few more steps before swinging his saber again, leaving corpses in his wake.

“Dean Long Chen is so handsome!” Countless female disciples couldn’t help shouting their admiration when they saw that sight.

Countless Divine Flame and Mortal Transcendence disciples within the academy weren’t qualified to set foot on the battlefield, and so they were only watching, gaining experience from it.

Some of them joined the academy later, so they had never seen Long Chen. But they had all heard of his name.

Now when they saw this major figure whose name had shaken the Heavenly Swell Domain, they were all moved and could only express their feelings by shouting.

After reaching the formation, Long Chen directly entered. Quite a few red devils behind him were still pouncing on him, but he ignored them.

This barrier was targeting those devils, so the academy’s disciples could pass through it easily.

“Good job. I knew that I didn’t misjudge you.” A muscular armored expert appeared before Long Chen right as he entered the barrier, laughing.

“Haha, Divine Lightning Elder, it’s been a long time.” Long Chen recognized this expert. It was the Divine Lightning Elder that had encouraged him not long after he joined the academy.

The academy had a Heaven, Earth, Wind, and Lightning Elder. Back then, Long Chen hadn’t been able to see the Divine Lightning Elder’s cultivation base. Now, he could tell that the latter was a terrifying Immortal King. It was no wonder that the Divine Lightning Elder hadn’t placed the Pill Institute in his eyes back then.

Long Chen was quite surprised to see him here. He had always remembered the elder’s praise from back then.

After seeing him here, sensing his vast Blood Qi, and hearing the thunder coming from inside his body, it was like the elder was a wild dragon. He was truly frighteningly powerful.

The High Firmament Academy was truly filled with hidden dragons. They had concealed their true power deeply.

The Divine Lightning Elder was also excited to see Long Chen. He patted him on the shoulder and even shook him lightly.

If Long Chen wasn’t strong enough, just this one pat on the shoulder might have smashed him into the ground. Sensing his powerful physical body, the Divine Lightning Elder smiled proudly. “I knew that I wouldn’t misjudge you. You advanced even faster than I expected. Moreover, you killed those half-step World Kings devils as easily as chopping apart vegetables. As expected, the younger generation would surpass the senior generation.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Divine Lightning Elder, you are overpraising me,” said Long Chen with a bit of embarrassment.

“Go to the academy and see the dean. This is just a small matter, and it is under control. They probably just want to train the children so that they don’t piss themselves when they see the real devils,” laughed the Divine Lightning Elder.

Hearing that, Long Chen suddenly felt that the situation was not as serious as he had anticipated.

He was thinking that with the Divine Lightning Elder’s power, killing those red devils should be effortless. It seemed that they had only let themselves be surrounded as a training opportunity for the disciples.

The Divine Lightning Elder was actually placed here to oversee things and make sure that the disciples didn’t panic.

As Long Chen walked through their midst, the disciples ran over to greet him. Long Chen then waved his hands and urged them to focus on killing their enemies. They shouldn’t treat this as a game. Their lives didn’t just belong to themselves as they also belonged to the people that cared about them. If they didn’t cherish this life, it wouldn’t be bravery but complete idiocy.

At first, Long Chen was quite pleased. But when he spoke of life and death, his expression grew colder. These disciples were not true warriors. Many of them were still spoiled and pampered. If he didn’t give them a stern knocking down, they could easily lose their lives in a moment of carelessness on the battlefield.

This stern side instantly made those disciples fight seriously. It was far more effective than even the harshest of warnings from the Elders or instructors.

Once Long Chen was past the barriers, all the new disciples in the Divine Flame realm and Mortal Transcendence realm had no misgivings at all and waved at him. Long Chen waved back, and an Elder brought him to see the dean.

When he was introduced to the dean, he was startled. Only now did Long Chen learn that the ordinary elder who had been clearing the books in the Divine Scripture Pavilion was actually the dean. He was also Bai Xiaole and Bai Shishi’s grandfather, Bai Letian.

Seeing his shocked appearance, Bai Letian laughed. “What? Are you very surprised, dean?”

“Dean, don’t call me like that, please. I feel like I can’t live up to that title. Just call me Long Chen, or it will make me feel strange,” said Long Chen.

Although he was also the dean, he never really viewed himself as one. That title was just for him to play around with. “Then I won’t stand on courtesy. In private, I will just call you by your name.” Bai Letian nodded. He then became serious. “Let me tell you our opponent’s goal this time. It isn’t the main academy but your seventh branch academy. Furthermore, the seventh branch academy is already surrounded by three major forces and is in a critical state.”

“Three major powers? Who are they?” demanded Long Chen angrily. So many powers were targeting him?
