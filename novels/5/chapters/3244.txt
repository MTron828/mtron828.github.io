Chapter 3233 Sharp Attack

“Just like this? What’s the plan? How are we supposed to cooperate?” Luo Changwu jumped in shock. Prepare themselves? What were they supposed to prepare?

Black lightning appeared on top of Long Chen’s left hand. He smiled. “There’s no plan. I’ll break the formation and immediately eliminate the idiots from the Bloodkill Hall. Bai Xiaole, bring them into the formation. Archers, ignore everything else other than blindly shooting at those altars. Take advantage of the chaos to destroy those altars. I don’t know what method they’re using, but they’re trying to summon lifeforms from the Netherworld. If those lifeforms descend, it will be too late for anything else. We’ll have to be pragmatic about it when the time comes. If we can fight, we’ll fight. If we can’t, we’ll run. But the altars must be broken.”

After saying that, Long Chen shot off and descended out of the sky, his left hand chopping toward the formation. At this moment, black lightning exploded.

Long Chen was like an arrow. These terrifying formations were as weak as paper in front of the black lightning. Over ten layers of defense were instantly pierced.

BOOM!

Long Chen smashed into the building where the Bloodkill Hall’s experts were gathered, and the building instantly collapsed.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

A flame lotus in Long Chen’s hand exploded, and flames devoured that entire building. It happened so fast that the Bloodkill Hall’s experts were still in the midst of discussing something when the flame lotus exploded.

As a result, an ear-piercing alarm rang throughout the entire Chu family. Long Chen was so fast that the flame lotus exploded first, and the alarm rang second.

Within the endless flames, a wretched figure flew out. However, just as he escaped the flames, a black saber pierced through his back and out his chest. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Blood splashed. Long Chen’s figure appeared behind that person. “Didn’t you say that I wouldn’t be able to find your true body? Now, are you convinced?”

With a light quiver, that elder of the Bloodkill Hall was blasted into blood mist. A translucent figure then flew out of his body and tried to flee.

However, that figure was shattered by another stroke of Long Chen’s saber.

“Idiot, after condensing a clone, your Yuan Spirit is no longer whole. Did you think that you could escape? Were you dreaming?” sneered Long Chen.

After killing that elder’s Yuan Spirit, using his saber as the bridge, Long Chen went through the fragments of the elder’s soul, trying to grasp some images.

In those images, Long Chen saw the elder exchanging some things with the Chu family. Then the altars were constructed. After that, someone came bringing some strange things from the devil sea.

Based on those images, the Chu family’s actions this time were incited by the Bloodkill Hall. Through those fragmentary images, Long Chen could get a general guess of what had happened.

This was clearly a scheme where the Bloodkill Hall was using the Chu family’s enmity against the Luo family to draw Long Chen out. Considering Long Chen’s close relationship with the Luo family, and that the Chu family was also mortal enemies with Long Chen, he definitely wouldn’t just sit still while the Chu family was making things hard on the Luo family. After all, youngsters all felt like they were capable of anything…

Once Long Chen was outside of the High Firmament Academy, they would have no more misgivings. After all, the High Firmament Academy was an extremely powerful existence, and they didn’t dare to attack him inside. But outside, everything was possible.

Unfortunately, the Luo family had a terrifying Immortal King like Luo Zichuan standing guard over it, so they didn’t dare to directly attack there. Thus, the Bloodkill Hall had come prepared. They had constructed these altars to summon the Netherworld’s Devil Kings to handle Luo Zichuan. After that, they would wipe out Long Chen together with the Luo family. That way, even the High Firmament Academy couldn’t interfere. After all, this was a personal grievance between the Luo family and the Chu family. The High Firmament Academy had no excuse to interfere.

This was a well-calculated scheme. Although Long Chen was unaware of all of it, just these images allowed him to guess this much.

“Enemy attack!”

Shouts rang throughout the Chu family. At this moment, one of those shouters was silenced just as he spoke, an arrow protruding through his head. That Divine Lord was killed with a single arrow.

Just as the formations were broken, Bai Xiaole seized the opportunity to silently bring everyone over to the altars.

There was no need for orders. The three hundred elite archers unleashed a torrent of arrows and shot the Divine Lords on the altars indiscriminately.

They shot using those wooden arrows as if they cost nothing. On the other hand, the Chu family’s experts roared and activated their manifestations, but then the wave of arrows struck them. By the time they reacted, it was too late. Even if they protected themselves with divine energy, it was useless. Their protective divine light was pierced through, and their bodies turned numb.

Quite a few of those experts directly fell to the ground, twitching. Some of them sprouted roots that dug into the ground. It was a terrifying sight.

As hundreds of Divine Lords collapsed, the other experts of the Chu family were shocked and immediately took out their weapons, activating their bloodline powers. As a result, saber-light flashed like lightning and sword-images filled the air like mountains, all collapsing on the Luo family’s experts.

The Primal Divine Lords unleashed their full power. As the very space collapsed, those arrows flying through space were no longer able to reach them.

“Archers, fall to the rear and continue shooting. Don’t let them get close!” shouted Qin Feng.

Only the initial wave could have such a large effect. Once the other side was prepared, the wooden arrows were no longer so threatening.

The alarm of the Chu family continued to ring out, so the Chu family’s experts and the experts of sects subordinate to them must be rushing over. In this case, these archers were in charge of buying Long Chen some time against them.

Luo Changwu, Luo Changwen, the Grand Elder, and the other Primal Divine Lords charged as well.

Suddenly, the void shuddered and the world changed color. A giant black saber-image then soared into the heavens, slashing down like an unstoppable heavenly blade.

Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen almost shouted when they saw that Saber Qi. They thought that their father had come. That domineering saber aura was actually quite similar to Luo Zichuan’s.

The saber slashed down like a starry river, slaying all the Chu family’s experts that were in their way. Countless people were blasted apart.

After the saber fell, one of the totems on the altar shattered. The altar instantly dimmed.

After breaking one totem, Long Chen rushed toward the next one.

“Stop him!”

The Chu family’s experts shouted in a panic. These five totems almost exhausted the resources they had been gathering for countless years. If the totems were destroyed, all their efforts would be for nothing.

“Can you stop me though?” sneered Long Chen.

A Primal Divine Lord had just reached Long Chen when Long Chen’s body swayed. Just like that, he flew past him with a flash of black light. As a result, that expert came to a stop, and a line of blood appeared down the middle of his body. Following that, his body split apart. He was cut in two.
