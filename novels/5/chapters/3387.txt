Chapter 3376 Forceful Visit

Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan were worried for Long Chen, but they knew Long Chen’s stubbornness. If they didn’t let him go, it would be equivalent to not trusting him.

Although they were gods, they had fallen for this fellow. Even as gods, they were still women.

Long Chen himself wasn’t worried at all. He was extremely confident and felt full of power. After advancing to the tenth Heavenstage, he found that the divine flame power of his 108,000 stars had changed.

Previously, he was completely bound by Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s combination technique. They were gods and in control of the laws. That was naturally a powerful suppression.

However, after reaching the tenth Heavenstage, his shaken confidence was boosted. Although he was still unable to counterattack against their combination, that was simply because their combination was so perfect. After all, not all Heaven tier Nether Kings could be such monsters.

If it weren’t for that combination technique, after reaching the tenth Heavenstage, Long Chen was confident that he had the power to fight a Heaven tier Immortal King. That was because even the pressure of a god was no longer so effective on him.

Long Chen took out a compass and rushed off in a certain direction. After a while, the mist in front of him gradually faded. This desolate land changed, and the aura of the divine Dao appeared. The laws of the Netherworld enveloped him.

“I wonder if my luck is still terrible in the Netherworld? I suppose I’ll know soon.” Long Chen continued, quickly seeing a giant city. He smiled.

He then found a place to hide. After waiting two hours, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue sent him a message. Everything was going according to plan. The other side was definitely too confident and hadn’t even activated their formations. They truly viewed them as merely a fat piece of meat.

Long Chen pulled up his hood, fixing his appearance. After his appearance was perfect, he walked toward that city.

The city was very ancient and had almost no guards. It was only when he reached the gates that people noticed him.

“Who goes there?!”

BOOM!

Long Chen simply kicked the gates in reply. The giant gates were blown off, smashing into the buildings behind them and destroying quite a few of them.

“Enemy attack!”

A startled cry rang out. In the panic, Long Chen saw countless experts rushing over. Things were chaotic. Long Chen had entered the city by the time the defensive formation was activated.

The city was in chaos. Countless experts came flying out of the buildings, and a cold shout suddenly shook the heavens.

“Brazen interloper, you dare to invade this king’s territory?!”

This voice was one with the Dao and contained unquestionable dignity. This was definitely the voice of a god.

Following that, six streams of divine aura descended and six black-robed experts appeared. One of them was particularly infuriated, but when he saw Long Chen, he was startled.

They saw a god, but this god was only at the peak of the Four Peak realm. And yet, he gave them quite a strong sense of pressure.

Long Chen smiled. As expected, his luck was as heaven-defying as ever. Wherever he went, it followed him.

Originally, Long Chen had been hoping to run into an empty city devoid of the six of them. Then he could just plunder it.

At that time, Leng Yueyan would have destroyed one city, Ming Cangyue would have destroyed one, and he would have destroyed one. Then three of these experts would lose the support of the Netherworld’s divine Daos. If that was the case, Long Chen could definitely handle the three of them.

At that time, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue would be able to handle two against three. Although they were fighting far from their territory, their seamless combination fighting style would still give them an advantage.

Then if the other side chose not to try and regain their lost territory, the two of them could directly condense new divine cores and gain even greater authority over the laws of the Netherworld.

It could be said that running into the six of them was the worst option, but he really did run into them. Just who could compare to him when it came to luck?

“You really are brazen. You dare to fight this lord over my meat?” Long Chen arrogantly looked down on those gods.

“What are you talking about?” The six of their expressions changed.

“This lord doesn’t like wasting time. Let’s get straight to the point. The territory that you’ve noticed is a gift my master left to me for when I advance to the Nether Lord realm. You dare to place your sights on it? Are you tired of living?” Long Chen arrogantly started walking toward the six of them.

“Bullshit! It was clearly a masterless territory-”

That god had just opened his mouth when Long Chen slapped him in the face. This wizened old elder was sent flying, smashing through countless buildings. Some people were unable to dodge in time and were directly killed.

They hadn’t expected that a little Four Peak weakling would dare to attack them. Let alone in his unguarded state, even if he had been prepared, it would have been very difficult for him to dodge Long Chen’s slap at this distance.

“You…!”

The other five were shocked and enraged. They had been bewildered by Long Chen’s cultivation base and how he managed to give them such a huge sense of pressure. There were many bizarre aspects of his appearance that befuddled them.

As they hadn’t expected him to suddenly attack one of them, their divine auras instantly erupted.

“What? Why don’t you try and touch a single hair on my body? My master is a World Master! The likes of you will be crushed by a single swat of him,” sneered Long Chen.

The five of them instantly froze. A World Master was equivalent to a World King in the immortal world. What was different from the immortal world was that a World Master possessed greater authority in the Netherworld. They were in control of countless territories. Many Nether Kings wanted to find a World Master as a backer.

With a World Master as a backer, a portion of their laws in their territories would be even more complete. It was very helpful to their future cultivation.

Nether Kings like them that relied on taking over wild territories like this were essentially like rogue cultivators in the immortal world. They weren’t qualified to even talk to a World Master.

Thus, when Long Chen mentioned a World Master, they stopped. If Long Chen really was a disciple of a World Master, then they truly didn’t dare to touch a single hair on his head.

“Bastard, die-”

Just then, the elder that Long Chen had slapped came charging back, his fingers clawing toward him.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The five of them hastily dragged him back. As a result, in the chaos, Long Chen effortlessly stepped forward and slapped that elder again.

The elder coughed up blood and was sent flying once more, this time going even higher and faster.

Just as Long Chen was looking at how far he was going to go, a sharp claw suddenly pierced out of the void, piercing that elder’s body. Long Chen and the others jumped in shock. Space twisted, revealing a sinister lifeform. When they saw that lifeform, the five gods were instantly terrified.

“Quick, activate the formation!” The master of this territory shouted in panic.
