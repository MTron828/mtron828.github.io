Chapter 4445 Heaven Shaking Clash

The giant dragon claw extended out of Netherdragon Tianzhao’s manifestation. The moment it appeared, a whirlpool of death enveloped this world.

This was Netherdragon Tianzhao’s killer move. But unlike his other moves, it was no longer purely backed by dragon blood power as it also contained the laws of the Netherworld.

This was the result of the dragon race’s divine ability being mixed with the laws of the Netherworld. Death Qi instantly locked onto Long Chen.

Long Chen snorted, “Hmph, this is why you betrayed the dragon race and joined the Netherworld? You blockheads really gave up everything for some scraps. When the dragon race’s divine abilities are refined to the pinnacle, their power isn’t something fools like you can imagine.”

Seeing this move, Long Chen instantly grasped that the nether dragon race was originally dark-elemental, and they joined the Netherworld’s faction to harness the support of their death qi. With this, the nether dragon race’s divine abilities would be near limitless.

Although the black dragon claw wasn’t a physical entity, it had been condensed to an unimaginable level, resembling a true solid dragon claw. Its individual claws and scales appeared lifelike, and most importantly, they contained immense dragon blood power.

“What does a frog at the bottom of a well know? Our nether dragon race chose to walk our own path, while the true dragon race is obstinate and refuses to evolve! Being stuck in their old ways, they will sooner or later be replaced by my nether dragon race!” roared Netherdragon Tianzhao.

His Blood Qi burst forth. As he rapidly formed hand seals, the dragon claw’s aura crazily grew.

“Die, you ignorant fool!”

The dragon claw crashed down.

“You’re the ignorant fool! Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!” Long Chen also roared. Now, he wasn’t battling as a human against Netherdragon Tianzhao; instead, he confronted this traitor as a member of the true dragon race.

A golden dragon claw burst out of Long Chen’s divine ring. Its sacred pressure radiated throughout the world, compelling people to bow in reverence.

On one side, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s dragon claw instilled terror, while on the other side, Long Chen’s dragon claw evoked reverence.

Both of them roared, their claws symbolizing the clash between two worlds and the pinnacle genius of each world. The two dragon claws then collided with tremendous force.

BOOM!

Golden and black divine light clashed, creating a wild hurricane that soared into the heavens. The impact pulverized stones and ores into smithereens, perhaps even the ten thousand Daos.

Amidst this devastating clash, an immense dragon roar echoed, overpowering all other sounds and shaking people’s souls. Even Eternal experts felt a sense of dizziness, nearly fainting from the intensity.

These two dragon claws didn’t just represent two kinds of power but also embodied two kinds of will. Hence, this clash was not something even the Eternal experts could endure.

As the hurricane raged and the world was thrown into chaos, Netherdragon Tianzhao formed hand seals, while Long Chen took a deep breath.

When Guo Ran and the others saw their motions, their expressions swiftly changed.

“Cover your ears!”

In an instant, every Dragonblood warrior knew what was about to happen. They then covered their ears and sealed their senses.

“Nether Dragon Heavenly Howl!”

“Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao and Long Chen let out resounding roars, their voices merging with the dragon cries emanating from their manifestations, creating a terrifying soundwave that filled the world.

Fortunately, the memory of how Long Chen had wiped out millions of experts with a single roar was carved deeply into the minds of Guo Ran and the others. As a result, they were well prepared.

Two soundwaves visibly struck each other like two opposing tides. They didn’t appear remarkable at first, but when they collided, the very void instantly exploded.

A giant hole formed in the space between them, followed by a terrifying ripple that spread in every direction.

The next moment, chaos descended upon the world—the sky flickered and the ground sank, as if the apocalypse was about to unfold. Luckily, the spectators had long since fled further, as the space they had occupied was obliterated. Staring in horror, they realized that if they hadn't retreated, the soundwave would have undoubtedly crushed all of them.

They were scared shitless. Both Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao had exceeded their wildest expectations. The aftereffects of their dragon claws had yet to fade, and they already unleashed their world-shaking dragon roars.

As a result, the world was in absolute chaos. Dragon Extermination Ridge had long since vanished, and the figures of Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao were also gone. While the spectators could sense that the two were still at the heart of the battlefield, they couldn’t see them.

The world once more quivered, shocking people.

Another clash? Could they unleash these kinds of terrifying moves consecutively? Are they monsters?

Just then, within the chaos, they saw a black and a golden dragon tail crash into each other.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Nether Dragon God Crusher!”

“Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum!”

Once again, they roared, and their enormous dragon tails clashed like divine whips. The impact caused the already shattered void between them to further splinter and expand, almost reaching beyond the realms of the nine heavens.

BOOM!

However, as this hole emerged, there was no wild Qi wave spreading in every direction. Instead, the hole seemed like a voracious maw attempting to devour everything in the world.

The powers of Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s power had created a scene of absolute devastation. The wild sand and rubble that had been flying about were now drawn into the giant hole, instantly restoring clarity to the chaotic world. But…

“Not good!” Frightened cries rang out. People were shocked to find that even at this range, a terrifying suction force was trying to suck them toward that hole.

They also saw endless spatial blades whirling within the hole as if they were waiting to crush them to mincemeat.

An ordinary spatial blade was not enough to threaten them. However, when they saw the spatial blades in that black hole, their souls quivered, and they instinctively knew that these spatial blades could easily kill them. This spatial hole was no ordinary spatial hole. If they were sucked in, they would definitely die.

“Run!”

People fled as fast as they could. However, they felt like something was pulling at them, resulting in them being unable to move quickly.

Fortunately, even though their speed was greatly reduced, they were still capable of fleeing. Once they got out of a certain range, they would escape the suction.

“KILL!”

Just then, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao once more roared. Ignoring that giant hole, they directly charged at each other.
