Chapter 4442 Terrifying Physical Body

Netherdragon Tianzhao was as quick as lightning, arriving in front of Long Chen in an instant. His hand was like a claw reaching for Long Chen’s throat.

He didn’t use any special technique, purely a combination of speed and power. Due to his terrifying speed, the space he had crossed actually twisted a bit.

In front of this attack, Long Chen simply unleashed a palm. When the dragon blood runes within him and on his dragon scales lit up, an overwhelming power burst out of him.

A powerful explosion erupted, causing wild gusts to fly out like sharp blades slicing the earth apart. The huge cracks then spread into the distance, headed straight for the spectators.

When they saw this scene, they hastily dodged. However, when the leftover wind blew by them, they felt a sharp pain as if they had been sliced by a blade.

Even at this distance, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s power didn’t dissipate, being incredibly concentrated. If the spectators were struck by the actual gust, it would be like withstanding their attacks, and they could easily lose their lives.

Just as everyone was shocked by their power, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao had exchanged dozens of blows.

Both of them fought barehanded, using their hands and feet in a wild assault against the other. Every clash would unleash a thunderous explosion and raging qi waves that tore through the landscape.

“That black fellow is so frightening. Big Brother Long Chen won’t lose, right?” Full of worry, Little Crane covered her eyes, peeking through the slits between her fingers. Naturally, this black fellow was Netherdragon Tianzhao covered in black dragon scales, launching a furious assault.

“Someone who can beat boss in close-quarters combat has yet to be born! Don’t worry!” comforted Guo Ran.

Hearing Little Crane’s silly question, the Dragonblood warriors smiled. They understood Long Chen very well. His hand-to-hand combat skills had been refined to the peak through actual combat.

Through countless bloody battles and life-and-death experiences, Long Chen had developed his own fighting style. Hence, for Netherdragon Tianzhao to fight Long Chen at close range, he was just asking for it.

Long Chen and the Netherdragon Tianzhao’s exchanges intensified as their speed and power were rising. The spectators could only see golden and black divine lights crazily clashing.

Dragon cries continuously reverberated, along with immense explosions. It was like a fight between two enormous dragons. Dragon roars would occasionally come from their manifestations as if encouraging the two of them to fight harder.

“What terrifying power. And it’s just a pure clash of physical strength. The dragon race’s physical bodies really are terrifying,” sighed a spectator.

Even though they were just spectating, everyone could gauge the power of their blows based on the changes in the laws of the Heavenly Daos.

In this battle, every single one of their moves had reached the essence of going from complex to simple—incredibly refined. As it turned out, Netherdragon Tianzhao was also an expert at close-range combat. There was nothing to pick on.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged hundreds of blows. The spectators were unable to find the slightest opening in any of their moves.

“I suppose we didn’t come for nothing. This is a real battle, and they’re true experts,” said another spectator. Their domain battle was boring, but this fight was worth the effort of traveling here.

As they were watching the two of them fight, they tried to imagine themselves using the same moves and fighting someone else like this. How could they digest this scene? Properly applying the insights that they were gaining now would help them improve quickly.

This was a real battle without any sloppiness, and it distinguished itself from their usual sparring sessions, providing spectators with valuable insights. In numerous aspects, the spectators could use both combatants as benchmarks to deepen their understanding. This explained why many Triple Supremes were willing to take the risk of witnessing the spectacle firsthand. Such a learning opportunity was exceedingly rare.

Eventually, their attacks started to slow down, but their techniques were even heavier now. Every impact shook the world, and the immense power was hard for the spectators to endure. Every impact made them feel their chests tighten, and it soon felt as if their insides were being gripped by some mysterious power.

Some of the Eternal experts started to shout at their young disciples to retreat. Many people were unable to endure the pressure here.

Such a thing couldn’t be forced. The senior generation sternly shouted at those disciples to retreat, but some disciples were unwilling to leave just like this. They thought that they could last a bit longer as every little bit of insight was important. Also, they didn’t want to go watch through formations. They wouldn’t have the same feeling of being there.

At this moment, the Jiang clan’s seniors also started to order some of their disciples away. The Jiang clan had set up their own grand formation to watch from another prefecture.

“Get going. If you were to lose your lives here, it would be a complete waste. The two of them are still warming up. Once the true battle starts, our seniors will not be able to protect you.” Seeing some of the disciples stubbornly wanting to watch a bit longer, Feng Fei finally spoke up.

“What?!”

“A warm-up?!”

“Big Sister Feng Fei, you’re not lying, are you?!”

Such a terrifying battle was just a warm-up? Then what would the real battle be like?

“I don’t know about Netherdragon Tianzhao, but I know Long Chen. I watched him grow up, so I understand his fighting style. He is definitely still warming up. Due to how much power he has, if he were to directly enter that state, his body would be unable to endure it. Don’t be regretful over leaving. Perhaps I will also be leaving soon and watching through a formation with you,” explained Feng Fei with a smile.

Hearing that, the Jiang clan’s disciples were shocked. Finally, they accepted their seniors’ suggestions and retreated.

Feng Fei did possess some influence in the Jiang clan, especially amongst the youngest disciples. Although she wasn’t the strongest, the junior generation was willing to listen to her and did trust her.

Now, over half of the spectators surrounding this place decided to leave. Many Eternal experts here were old fossils. Seeing through some clues, they directly shooed off some disciples who weren’t strong enough.

One aspect was that they were worried these disciples would be injured or killed by the shockwaves. However, the other aspect was that they wanted to focus on watching the battle. They didn’t have time to protect the weaklings.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void split open, and a giant dragon claw reached out from the darkness at Long Chen.

In an instant, an air of death filled the battlefield, shaking numerous hearts. The real battle was starting.
