Chapter 4137 Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed

Long Chen’s fist smashed into that rusty spear. However, just like a heavenly pillar, the spear didn’t budge in the slightest. Instead, Long Chen held his painful and throbbing hand.

“How hard!”

Intending to only test it, Long Chen hadn’t used that much power in this punch. However, the backlash was absolutely terrifying, almost breaking his fist.

This was just a light punch. If it was his full-power punch, this arm would probably be gone.

Even so, although it was painful, Long Chen was overjoyed. This spear was definitely a priceless treasure.

“Hahaha, I’ve struck gold!” Long Chen hugged the giant spear and laughed as if he had gone insane.

The experts watching were all dumbfounded. No matter what race they were, they all had odd expressions.

“Is this fellow crazy? Does he really think…?”

“He couldn’t be…”

A bizarre thought appeared in their minds, but it was absolutely impossible. However, that wild laughter seemed as if Long Chen really wanted to take the spear.

“Master, he couldn’t be thinking about taking that spear, right?” One of Xue Qingkuang’s subordinates spoke, his voice quivering.

“It’s impossible! That spear is an Eternal divine weapon! Its master is long gone, perhaps died with this Devil Saint. Moreover, this fellow is only an Immortal King. How on earth could he awaken an Eternal divine weapon?” sneered Xue Qingkuang.

However, Long Chen was almost drooling as he rubbed the spear, somehow looking fully confident in being able to obtain it.

Countless gazes concentrated on Long Chen. They had no idea what he was going to do.

Long Chen then took out a hammer and struck the spear a few times, causing some flakes of rust to fall. But after a few taps, his hammer shattered.

“Damn, World Domain divine items can’t even tap it a few times!”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen was gobsmacked. He hadn’t even attacked the spear, but even a few simple taps were no good. All he wanted right now was to remove the rust and see the runes on the spear.

However, this spear was too powerful, causing the hammer he was using to shatter. Hence, he took out another World Domain divine item, and it also shattered in a few taps.

Long Chen furiously took out a truncheon and smashed it at the spear, only for the truncheon to be blasted to bits. As a result, Long Chen’s hand split open, his blood pouring out of it.

The previous few taps had managed to knock off some rust, but that last blow didn’t cause the slightest speck of rust to fall.

“It’s no good. The rust on the surface has accumulated over countless years of erosion. Without clearing away the rust, there’s no way to see its true body. And without seeing its true body, there’s no way to activate its runes and pull it out.” Long Chen sighed. This rust was incredibly difficult to remove.

Although Long Chen had quite a few World Domain divine items, he couldn’t just waste them like this. Moreover, even if he did want to, he didn’t have that much time to waste. If he were to just tap them one by one, how many years would it take to complete the task?

“Hey, children of the Blood Devil race, would you be interested in discussing some business??” Long Chen suddenly shouted to the Blood Devil race’s experts.

However, his words were insulting, irritating the Blood Devil race.

“What business?”

Even so, Xue Qingkuang still had the patience to ask him what he meant. He wanted to see just what kind of drugs Long Chen was taking.

“I’ve encountered some difficulty here. If you can help me out a bit, I’ll take the spear, and you… hehe, you understand!”

“What nonsense. I do not believe that you can pull it out. Do you view us as fools?” sneered Xue Qingkuang.

That spear was something that couldn’t be pulled out even if every single expert here worked together, let alone Long Chen attempting it alone.

“You really are a fool. I, Long Chen, have never said any empty words in this life. If I say that I can pull it out, then I can pull it out. If you don’t believe me, fine. I’ll find some other devil race to collaborate with me.” Long Chen began to look around.

Xue Qingkuang’s heart shook. Did he really have such assurance? After thinking a bit, he coldly asked, “Why don’t you tell me what you want first?”

“I need two things. One is money, and the other one is items. If you can hand them over, I can extract the spear,” said Long Chen.

“If I’m bringing the money and items, what are you bringing?” demanded Xue Qingkuang.

“Naturally, my effort!” said Long Chen.

“Do you think that I’m an idiot? Who would believe such nonsense?” retorted Xue Qingkuang disdainfully.

Suddenly, someone beside Xue Qingkuang beckoned to him, causing him to look into the distance to see an elder waving to him from outside the barrier.

Xue Qingkuang was startled. That person was the leader of the Blood Devil race, and he actually wanted Xue Qingkuang to listen to Long Chen.

Long Chen also saw it clearly. Although he didn’t know what the two of them were talking about, he could guess.

“Speak. What do you want? I’ll consider it,” said Xue Qingkuang coldly.

“I want ten cubic meters of Scarlet Blood Essence Gold, ten cubic meters of Scarlet Blood Mithril, ten cubic meters of Scarlet Blood Wind Copper…” Long Chen listed off over ten kinds of immortal metal.

Those immortal metals were all products of the Blood Devil World, and they were almost impossible to find in the outside world. As soon as they appeared, countless people would fight over them.

“Are you mad? My entire Blood Devil Star-Field can only produce less than one cubic meter of Scarlet Blood Essence Gold in ten thousand years! Those materials you are asking for are equivalent to a million years of hard work! Do you think that I’ll just give them to you?” sneered Xue Qingkuang.

In his eyes, Long Chen was practically a madman with crazy dreams. The Blood Devil race definitely would not agree to such a thing.

“Don’t interrupt me. Other than those, I also need one of your sacred blood pool’s Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seeds,” continued Long Chen.

“Bullshit! My Blood Devil race possesses only a single Heaven Merging Blood Lotus! It takes three million years for it to flower and three million years for it to bear a single fruit! After that, the fruit matures only once every three million years, bearing only a single fruit each time! It is our supreme priceless treasure. I've never even seen it, but you dare to ask for it? Are you just amusing yourself?” Xue Qingkuang finally couldn’t endure it anymore and burst into curses.

That Heaven Merging Blood Lotus was their Blood Devil race’s totemic sacred medicine. As for the seed, it was a holy item that could revive someone on the brink of death. Even someone who had lost their body could use it to give birth to a new body as long as their Yuan Spirit still remained.

Furthermore, someone who revived their body through this method would possess the physique of the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus, having unmatched divine might. All in all, it was a priceless treasure that countless people in the Blood Devil race dreamed of obtaining.

However, obtaining it was an incredibly daunting task. Xue Qingkuang wasn't wrong; even he, the top expert among the junior generation of the Blood Devil race, had never laid eyes on its true form.

“Tch, I want the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed not for myself but for the Great Desolate Winged Devil. Only by awakening its instincts can it help me extract this spear. But since you don’t want to, whatever.” Long Chen shrugged.

At this time, the distant leader of the Blood Devil race gestured to Xue Qingkuang, giving him an order that he couldn’t believe.

Through clenched teeth, Xue Qingkuang spat out words that stunned even his subordinates.

“Fine, I’ll work together with you. But if you dare to trick my Blood Devil race, I guarantee that you’ll die a miserable death.”
