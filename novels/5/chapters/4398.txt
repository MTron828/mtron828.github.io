Chapter 4388 Who is the King of this World

“Senior, please speak.”

Long Chen knew that the academy had to have an important mission for him if they had called him back so urgently.

“Time is of the essence, so I will have to be rude,” declared the vice lightning palace master as he stuck out a finger.

Long Chen instantly understood. The vice lightning palace master intended to convey information to him through Spiritual Strength. Given the volume of information, using photographic jades would be time-consuming.

However, such a method of information transmission might come across as excessively rude. If Long Chen were an ordinary disciple, the vice lightning palace master wouldn't hesitate, but considering Long Chen's position as the dean of a branch academy, a figure of notable status, such an approach seemed inappropriate. So the vice lightning palace master had to ask for permission first.

Long Chen nodded and walked closer, letting the other party’s finger press against his forehead. A wave of information then poured into his mind.

This was all the important affairs that had occurred after the eighteen world gates to the Darklight Heaven opened. It included the strength of those races, as well as their attitudes toward the human race.

Of the eighteen worlds, seventeen were hostile toward the human race, and their relationship was like fire and water. Only the Yuyang World showed no particular hostility toward the human race. Instead, it was simple contempt.

It could be said that there wasn’t the slightest bit of friendship between the eighteen worlds and the human race. Other than the Yuyang World, the other worlds were just like the Great Desolate World and the humanless world.

However, there was a major difference here. Each of these eighteen worlds surpassed the humanless world and the Great Desolate World in size. It was rumored that these eighteen worlds were connected to an outer realm, and the primal chaos qi originated from that outer realm, resulting in all eighteen worlds having even stronger experts.

What shocked Long Chen the most was the revelation that each of the eighteen worlds housed not just one, but multiple Saints.

Furthermore, these Saints were in a league of their own, incomparable to the red-haired monster. They were true Saints who had achieved that realm countless years ago—true overlords.

Nevertheless, these formidable Saints would not casually leave their respective worlds. Thus, as long as people didn’t enter their worlds, there was no need to worry about encountering them.

The opening of the eighteen worlds threw the Darklight Heaven into chaos. Given that the human race here was comparatively weaker than that in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, as soon as the gates opened, countless humans eagerly threw themselves into the other side. Their zealous enthusiasm resembled a fear that others might seize their spots if they were too late.

These traitors had even offered the invaders to take over their entire family and sect as a token of their sincerity.

In the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, thanks to Long Chen, the majority of humans retained their rationality, and only a minuscule fraction betrayed the human race.

However, the Darklight Heaven was different. The minute the gates opened, humans rushed into them, pleading to become subordinates to seek superior cultivation environments and resources. They were prepared to sacrifice anything for their desires.

Right from the start, numerous humans willingly aligned themselves with the other races, and astonishingly, they were prepared to go to any lengths to achieve this, displaying no trace of embarrassment.

The current Darklight Heaven was filled with humans willing to sell themselves into slavery, and they even looked down on others for not selling themselves. Strangely, once enslaved, they felt superior to other humans.

That was not all. Hearing about the environment in those eighteen worlds, experts from other heavens even started to take the risk of crossing heavens just to come to the Darklight Heaven. They were willing to bankrupt themselves or become bandits just to get enough money to come over.

The price for boats that could cross heavens was already extremely high, but due to the demand, the price soared to extremes, yet that didn’t slow down the people wanting to come over.

In any case, the Darklight Heaven was now in complete chaos. Stepping out of the academy, one would encounter countless lifeforms previously unseen, and they would be running around rampantly as if they were strolling in their own backyard.

For the human race, getting into the other worlds was as difficult as ascending the heavens. Without powerful guarantees, they needed to have a spiritual seal placed on them, effectively turning them into slaves.

Even so, a line of experts formed, wanting to get into those worlds. Becoming slaves was a price they were willing to pay and even risk their lives for.

When Long Chen first saw those people being treated as livestock, he was enraged. However, that fury had now been doused with a bucket of ice-cold water. This chill was nearly sufficient to induce despair. Long Chen found himself unable to pinpoint a target for his anger. Looking at these people being taken advantage of, Long Chen could only feel pity, not anger.

“Dean Long Chen, this is the current situation of the Darklight Heaven—a pinnacle of chaos. However, these fellows are cunning, unlike the fools of the humanless world and the Great Desolate World. They are intentionally sowing discord among us, and it won’t be long before they start using these people to probe the High Firmament Academy. Morale is a problem. The cultivation world has always revered strength, but the human race’s experts are entirely overshadowed by the elites of those worlds, and this only encourages their overbearing attitudes. The heavenly geniuses of those worlds are setting up forces within the Darklight Heaven, gathering followers amongst the human race. Quite a few of our geniuses have submitted to idolizing the strong or pursuing resources, aligning themselves with their cause. It's only a matter of time before all human experts, except for Lord Brahma's followers, become their slaves,” conveyed the vice lightning palace master.

“Lord Brahma’s followers are exempt? The experts of those worlds don’t dare to touch Lord Brahma’s followers?” Long Chen’s heart shook.

“Correct. Lord Brahma’s followers ignore them, and they ignore Lord Brahma’s followers in turn. Once, some followers of Lord Brahma whose faith wasn’t strong enough decided to join the other worlds’ forces. As a result, those forces directly killed them for the betrayal.”

Long Chen sneered, “Interesting. The Sage King Convention was entirely a huge trap. Lord Brahma manipulated us to open the gates to those worlds, and now their experts won’t touch Lord Brahma. They can’t even be bothered to maintain a facade!”

Hearing this, the Eternal experts here fell silent. They were also aware of the schemes, but such matters were not to be spoken of casually. It was preferable for the younger generation not to bear the weight of such knowledge, as they didn’t want these youngsters to be under too much pressure.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Vice lightning palace master, why don’t you tell me what I have to do?” Long Chen stated, taking a deep breath and suppressing his anger.

“It’s very simple. Once you’ve finished recuperating, take a walk and tell them who the real king of this world is!”
