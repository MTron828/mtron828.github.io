Chapter 3771: Kun Tu

The Underworld Eye Giant actually recognized Long Chen and charged toward him. However, as his body was so huge, he was forced to move through a greater amount of lightning, causing resistance. Hence, his speed wasn’t very fast.

It was due to this that he ended up entangled by those demonic beasts. His power was terrifying, but he was unable to launch a killing blow on those Supreme heavenly geniuses.

“It seems that big brother Wu Tian’s influence in the Netherworld is growing.” Long Chen smiled slightly.

Long Chen was full of respect when it came to Wu Tian. He was a good friend whose word was solid, and he repaid gratitude and enmity. But rarest of all, both of them possessed a heaven-defying will to topple this entire world.

Ignoring the Underworld Eye Giant, Long Chen continued leading an army of demonic beasts forward.

The Underworld Eye Giant’s speed was its fatal weakness. It was instantly thrown behind as Long Chen continued deeper.

Long Chen saw more and more battlefields. He also found powerful experts of other races fighting the demonic beasts.

These experts were all terrifying, not at all weaker compared to the Underworld Eye Giant he had just seen. Even against dozens of the demonic beast race’s Supreme experts, they were not defeated.

“Why are there no human experts? There’s also not a single Dragonblood warrior!” After going through hundreds of battlefields, they didn’t spot a single person from the human race, let alone the brothers that they had long since anticipated seeing.

Long Chen also found it curious. With there being so many Dragonblood warriors, it was impossible that not a single one would come here.

All the Dragonblood warriors focused on tempering their Blood Qi. Hence, no matter how dangerous the Heavenly River Blood Sea was, surely some of them would come.

“Even boss Gu Yang isn’t here. He couldn’t have failed to come, could he?” wondered Jiang Lei.

“Let’s keep looking.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Long Chen continued roaming this land. In truth, the experts chasing him had long since started to grow impatient. They had originally been anticipating to see Long Chen and Jiang Lei struggle bitterly within their heavenly tribulation. After all, the human race’s physical bodies were weak compared to theirs.

However, when this heavenly tribulation landed on Long Chen’s body, it was like he didn’t even sense it. So, they were starting to get a bad feeling. They chased after them, but Long Chen didn’t even give them a chance to surround him. He just roved through the battlefields.

They had to chase Long Chen while resisting the heavenly tribulation and absorbing the lightning. It was very difficult, but they couldn’t give up either. They could only curse and shout at him as they chased.

“There’s a human expert!”

Suddenly, Jiang Lei cried out excitedly. However, once they got close, they were once more disappointed. This person might be human, but he wasn’t from the Dragonblood Legion.

He was a powerful beast cultivator with shocking Blood Qi. Although he was a human, his Blood Qi was even more terrifying than a demonic beast. Furthermore, it was very mixed. It seemed that he had absorbed the essence blood of countless demonic beasts.

Also, the demonic beasts attacking him were so crazed as though they had encountered the one who had killed their fathers. However, this beast cultivator easily blocked their assault with a wave of his hand. There was no sign of him being defeated.

“This person is very powerful. He’s still holding back.” Long Chen’s expression changed slightly. His intuition told him that this person was very dangerous.

This person also sensed Long Chen. Looking through space, he looked at Long Chen guardedly.

His eyes were very strange. They were like a falcon’s eyes yet also like a crocodile’s eyes. His pupils were constantly changing.

Although he was human, Long Chen had no desire to greet him. Hence, Long Chen continued moving through the Heavenly River Blood Sea, hoping to find people that he knew.

Seeing Long Chen leave, that person’s expression relaxed slightly. He was clearly very wary of Long Chen.

Long Chen continued searching when dozens of Supreme experts appeared in front of him and blocked his way. These people had blood on their bodies. It seemed that they had just slain some experts.

Afraid of being blocked by them and once more being surrounded, Long Chen took a sharp turn. He himself no longer knew where he was. There were increasingly many demonic beasts in the surroundings. Furthermore, their auras were also growing more powerful.

“Boss, do you think that we’ve entered their secret land?” Jiang Lei sensed their powerful auras. Although they were Supreme experts just like the others, the pressure they gave off was far greater. The demonic beasts here were far more powerful.

“Probably. The Heavenly River Blood Sea is enormous, so it’s definitely hiding some secret. I want to find it!”

For more demonic beasts to appear here, there had to be something up. Furthermore, the demonic beasts actually weren’t undergoing tribulation. It seemed that they were waiting for something.

Now that Long Chen had arrived here, the calmness in this region was shattered. Countless experts howled and attacked him.

“Boss, the blood sea here hasn’t started boiling!” observed Jiang Lei.

“It seems that this must be the core of the Heavenly River Blood Sea. They won’t let outsiders get here.” Long Chen also noticed this oddity. It seemed that some terrifying energy was hidden deep within this region.

“Long Chen? There was a path to heaven, but you didn’t walk it. There was no door to hell, but you still dove through it. Did you intentionally come to get killed by me?”

Suddenly, an icy voice came from the depths of the Heavenly River Blood Sea. The Heavenly Daos cried out as soon as this voice appeared.

Following that, the experts chasing Long Chen stopped and created a path. At the end of the path was an expert wrapped in lightning runes.

“Kun Tu!”

Long Chen couldn’t help but smile. He hadn’t expected Kun Tu to be viewed so highly by the demonic beast race. It seemed that these Supreme demonic beasts listened to his orders.

Kun Tu slowly walked over. Every step caused blood-colored cracks to appear beneath his feet and thunderous booms to shake the world. Even the sound of tribulations in the distance was covered up by this sound. Also, his Blood Qi was so powerful that it shook the sun, moon, and stars.

“You want to kill me? With your power, that sounds like a fantasy.” Long Chen shook his head at Kun Tu, stopping in the air.

Kun Tu was a true Kunpeng. Having experienced countless tribulations, he was an expert that had walked out of true hardships and trials. Although a true Kunpeng possessed the primordial Kunpeng bloodline, one might not appear even once in millions of years.

Because of the reasons above, all the demonic beasts here were reverent of Kun Tu. They were like subjects looking at their emperor. They didn’t even dare to form a will to resist him.

The Kunpeng bloodline had a terrifying bloodline suppression effect on countless demonic beasts. It was similar to the true dragon race’s sacred dragon might.

As for Kun Tu, as a first generation Kunpeng, his bloodline pressure was exceptionally strong. Even these Supreme experts respected him as their king.

“Hahahaha, interesting! Let alone with your mixed dragon blood, even if you had pure ancestral dragon essence blood, you wouldn’t be qualified to act arrogant in front of me. The true dragon race is nothing more than prey for my Kunpeng race, let alone a human who only absorbed dragon blood,” said Kun Tu arrogantly, like an absolute king.

“Prey? Then how come I’ve heard that the Kunpeng race once submitted and was subservient to the dragon race? Isn’t that the only reason your race wasn’t wiped out? Do you dare to swear on your soul that such a thing never happened?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“Courting death!”

Kun Tu was enraged and extended his hand. His sharp claws broke through the void, reaching toward Long Chen.
