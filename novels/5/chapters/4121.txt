Chapter 4110 Golden God Slayer Divine Arrow

BOOM!

A giant flame lotus exploded amongst the tide of dark creatures like a bomb. After that, waves of fire unfurled amongst their ranks, spreading in every direction and clearing out an entire area.

The dark creatures within this area were reduced to ashes, emanating a disgusting stench that filled the air.

After unleashing the World Extermination Flame Lotus, Long Chen didn’t even pay attention to those creatures. He knew that these flames would have an immense effect against dark attribute creatures.

His focus was entirely on the golden lotus seed. This time, he saw it clearly, after slaughtering them, the golden lotus seed clearly brightened, and its withered appearance regained some vitality.

Long Chen was overjoyed by this discovery. He finally found a way to strengthen the golden lotus seed. This was incredibly important.

The golden lotus seed was his greatest trump card against the Yan Xu Flame. Last time, breaking the Yan Xu Gate had exhausted all of its energy, so Long Chen had always been searching for a way to help it recover. He hadn’t expected to find it here.

“Just what kind of origin do these dark creatures have? Why does killing them help the golden lotus seed recover?”

Long Chen couldn’t figure it out and was too lazy to bother thinking about it. Although he had slaughtered countless dark creatures with his last attack, in just the blink of an eye, more dark creatures came flooding over from the distance.

Right now, the Dragonblood Legion had set up their formation. They were like a web of swords constantly slaughtering the dark creatures.

These dark creatures were no longer on the level of Mortal Venerates that they had slain at the start. Now, they were far stronger, and their numbers caused even the Dragonblood warriors to feel immense pressure.

However, what they were seeking from this battle wasn’t to kill them as fast as possible, nor was it to accumulate combat experience. Their only goal was to buy time for Xia Chen.

As the Dragonblood warriors were constantly forced back, Long Chen began to toss out World Extermination Flame Lotuses as if they cost nothing at all. The repeated explosions wiped out those dark creatures in huge numbers.

“What’s going on? Why is boss in such a rush?”

Guo Ran was busy at work on constructing his platform. Seeing Long Chen tossing out flame lotuses like crazy, he was shocked.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Having followed Long Chen the longest, he was profoundly aware of his character. He had never seen Long Chen act like this at the start of the battle.

Every flame lotus devoured an enormous area. As they smashed down one by one, the ground became littered in corpses.

Even though these creatures were endless, in just a few breaths’ time, Long Chen managed to clean up the battlefield, and the pressure on the Dragonblood warriors was greatly reduced.

As for the Fullmoon race’s experts, they were completely dumbfounded. He was repeatedly unleashing such a terrifying technique. Was he really human?

This was the result of Huo Linger’s growth after devouring the Moon Flames and Sun Flames. Her power had gone through a complete transformation, and her flame energy was as vast as a sea, allowing Long Chen to use it as much as he wanted.

Just then, heaven and earth quivered. As Xia Chen’s formation lit up, a crystalline pattern appeared on top of it, with every crystal containing countless runes flowing within it.

“Hahaha, success! Brothers, go ahead and slaughter them! I’ve spent everything on this grand formation. Unless an Eternal expert comes, this formation cannot be broken!” Xia Chen laughed, filled with pride.

The instructions that Long Chen had given him were to take this world at all cost. With this world as their foundation, the Dragonblood Legion would have a home. They would no longer need to wander the world.

Thus, Xia Chen had unleashed all his formation materials on this one grand formation. This was the strongest formation he had ever built.

Although he was now a poor wretch, he was still full of pride as he looked at his greatest masterpiece.

Just then, a furious roar shook the world, and a terrifying aura crashed over them. Upon feeling this aura, the Fullmoon experts’ countenance changed.

“Heaven Venerate creature!”

BOOM!

A monstrous dark creature appeared, resembling the others, yet distinguished by golden runes on its head. When it stepped into this world, it directly shot at Long Chen as quick as lightning, reaching him in an instant.

The Fullmoon experts cried out in shock. Its speed was too fast, and they were unable to reach Long Chen in time.

Seeing it approaching, Long Chen snorted and put away the World Extermination Flame Lotus. Just as he was taking out the Minghong Saber, two streaks of divine light shot over. It was a tree branch and a spear.

Before Long Chen even had a chance to attack, that Heaven Venerate creature had three bloody holes in its body.

“What…?”

The Fullmoon experts were stunned. The branch and spear had pierced that creature in the chest, but there was also a bloody hole in its head. Clearly, that was the fatal blow.

Uncle Tree and Uncle Xiong turned their heads back and looked at the platform at the same time. They then saw that a giant golden crossbow had been constructed on top of the platform, aiming at the Heaven Venerate.

“As expected, heroes will always appear from the junior generation. We acted for nothing.” Uncle Tree couldn’t help smiling bitterly.

His branch would cause that creature’s body to stiffen, leaving it unable to move, and Xu Jianxiong’s spear would instantly take its life. Thus, neither of their attacks needed to strike it in its vitals.

However, it seemed that even without them, Guo Ran would have been able to kill it in one blow as well. That arrow was as steady as a mountain, and his timing was also perfect, which clearly displayed his solid foundation.

“Nice job!”

Long Chen was also stunned. Guo Ran had been using his battle armor the entire time that even Long Chen had almost forgotten about his archery skill. Now, Guo Ran finally had a chance to show everyone what a life-reaping arrow was.

“Hehe, it’s all thanks to boss’s support. Since good things come in two, let me help liven things up a bit!”

The golden crossbow lit up, along with the entire platform.

With a light sound, the entire platform swayed ever so slightly. Even experts of Uncle Tree and Xu Jianxiong’s caliber couldn’t discern the arrow’s movement. All they saw was another Heaven Venerate creature rushing over from the distance, only to have its head obliterated by the arrow.

Guo Ran then cried out excitedly at his success and kissed his giant crossbow.

“It really was worth spending all that effort building you! You’ve won me some face!” Guo Ran hugged the crossbow and repeatedly kissed it, feeling overjoyed.

Having some time to spare, Long Chen took the chance to form hand seals, and the corpses on the ground were all tossed into the primal chaos space’s black soil.

Just then, a rumbling noise rang out from the distance, and countless creatures came charging over. Most terrifying of all, more and more Heaven Venerate creatures appeared in their ranks.

“Boss, no good! I’ve only made eighteen Golden God Slayer Divine Arrows! It’s not enough!”

Seeing so many Heaven Venerate creatures appear at once, Guo Ran cried out.
