Chapter 4876 Qianwu

A black heavenly screen completely blocked this mountain range. As far as the eye could see, there was only a dark haze, and beyond that haze was only darkness.

This darkness had the power to draw out the most primal fear in people’s hearts. It felt like this darkness had bloodthirsty devils hidden within it.

This was Heaven Screen Mountain, a realm that never saw the light of day—a tomb burying an entire era. An ethereal barrier prevented this place from ever welcoming the dawn.

This was a forbidden land, shunned by all. The black heavenly screen served as a curse barrier, and even Heaven Venerates didn’t dare to get close to it lest they provoked a massive calamity.

However, today, this place was packed with people. Countless young heavenly geniuses had flocked to this place, waiting for Heaven Screen Mountain to open.

Within Heaven Screen Mountain was an entire era—a buried battlefield within its vast expanse. Who could guess how many divine weapons lay hidden in its depths?

It was a land of both dangers and opportunities. Whenever it opened, hordes of adventurers would flock to test their luck.

In the past, many adventurers had to pay a certain fee to Devil Fall City to buy a spot to enter Heaven Screen Mountain. Rogue cultivators or poor ones who didn’t have the money could either contribute to Devil Fall City by completing certain tasks or trading devil crystals.

However, this time, the sudden opening of Heaven Screen Mountain came without any demand for fees from Devil Fall City. Everyone was free to come without hindrance.

Devil Fall City would normally start making a registration list ten years before the opening of Heaven Screen Mountain, overseen by the four noble families. However, due to the intense conflict between the noble families and the city lord—escalating to the point of weapons being drawn—they weren’t in the mood for such a thing.

As a result, the participation this time was one hundred times greater than usual, as no one wanted to miss this rare opportunity. Countless heavenly geniuses arrived, accompanied by their elders who would guide them into the mountain.

When the golden chariot representing the city lord appeared, the impatient experts immediately stomped over.

“Xing Wujiang, what are you up to? The set time has passed!” Cao Guofeng was the first to shout angrily.

Cao Guofeng wasn’t standing at the very front this time. Instead, he stood behind an elder with a sword on his back.

This elder’s robes had flames moving on top of them, pulsating with life. His eyes contained flame totems that appeared and vanished intermittently, surrounded by swirling flame runes.

This person stood out even amongst the powerful old experts. All on his own, his aura shook the world.

“Shut your mouth. Does your face itch for another slap if you don’t talk for a few days?” scoffed Long Chen, also coming out of the chariot.

“You...!” Cao Guofeng was about to curse him back, but the elder in front of him suddenly raised his hand.

Long Chen eyed that elder. Although the latter wasn’t showing his aura, Long Chen’s sharp senses discerned that this person was incredibly terrifying. Most likely, he was someone on the same level as Xing Wujiang.

Looking behind that elder, Long Chen spotted Jiang Yiban and the others, who had clearly called over reinforcements. This person’s position in the Flame Divine Hall had to be even higher than theirs.

The elder looked at Long Chen and said, “Long Chen, due to your cultivation base and talent, I am willing to use my status as the vice hall master of the Flame Divine Hall to accept you as my disciple. Your enmity with the Flame Divine Hall can be—”

“Hahaha!” Long Chen went through a laughing fit, like he had just heard the world’s funniest joke and simply couldn’t hold back. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Mo Nian couldn’t contain his laughter either and pointed at the elder. “My brother is the youngest branch dean of the world’s number one academy. You want him to join your Flame Divine Hall as a mere disciple? You really know how to raise your own status!”

“Vice Hall Master, it’s just as I told you. These people are wildly arrogant and don’t understand your kind intentions. These sick people should be eradicated as quickly as possible to prevent their disease from spreading,” said Cao Guofeng.

This elder was the vice hall master of the Flame Divine Hall. His prestigious status was matched only by his terrifying power. However, to everyone's surprise, Long Chen and Mo Nian openly mocked him in front of the crowd. As a result, chilling intent started to gather in the elder's eyes.

“Vice Hall Master, I will personally take this person’s life.”

Just then, a figure walked out from the ranks of the Flame Divine Hall—a woman whose beauty was shrouded with arrogance, as if she felt that all others were beneath her.

“My god...” Upon seeing that woman, Mo Nian couldn’t help exclaiming in shock. This woman’s aura was sharp and powerful, as if a slumbering beast was hibernating within her. She was a Heavenly Doyen, but her Doyen power was different from all other Doyens that Mo Nian had ever encountered.

Others had their Doyen power manifest in a gaseous state around them. However, this woman’s Doyen power was shockingly condensed, like a screen of water flowing around her. It was even vaguely possible to see Doyen runes prostrating toward her, which shocked Mo Nian even more.

“So today’s the day I see a Heavenly Chosen.” With an open mouth, Mo Nian was staring at her as if trying to see through her.

“If you keep up that rudeness, I’ll dig your eyes out,” threatened that red-robed woman.

Mo Nian turned back to Long Chen to whisper, “This girl doesn’t look like a good person! Brother, I leave her to you. I feel like you can take her!”

Although he was whispering, it was still loud enough for everyone here to hear. As the red-robed woman wasn’t deaf, she naturally heard it, and her killing intent erupted. Just as she was about to attack, the vice hall master stopped her.

“Qianwu, calm yourself. Why bother quibbling with some random commoners? You’ll lower your own status.”

“Commoners? I am a master archaeologist!” raged Mo Nian.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen chuckled, amused by Mo Nian's sweeping gaze and sudden claim.

The vice hall master paid them no mind, shifting his focus instead to Xing Wujiang.

“After killing people from my Flame Divine Hall, do you have any explanation for me?”
