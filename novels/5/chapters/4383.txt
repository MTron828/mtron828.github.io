Chapter 4372 Next Target, Humanless World

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we can’t accept it!”

“Getting revenge is all we ever wanted. If we demanded more than that, would we really be human?”

“That’s right, we’re already satisfied! The treasures must be left to the strongest senior apprentice-brothers and sisters!”

The majority of these experts instantly declined a portion of the battle spoils. They all knew that they had contributed practically nothing in this battle. With their pride, they wouldn’t shamelessly accept benefits that they hadn’t earned. After all, they didn’t want to be looked down upon.

Long Chen said, “I’ve made up my mind. This place has countless resources. If we don’t split them up, are you planning on leaving them to those useless fellows who just sat back and watched, doing nothing at all? While there are many of us, this place is enormous. Even gathering everything will take some effort. Hurry up. If you’re really going to be shy, just hand the treasures to me, and I will distribute them when it’s over.”

Hearing that, everyone stopped hesitating. Xia Chen had already drawn a map and was distributing these people according to the region. Together, they were sweeping this world clean of treasures.

While everyone was working hard, the Dragonblood Legion gathered together. They had just experienced an immense battle, including clashing with Eternal experts, so their comprehension had risen immensely. Now was the best time for them to undergo some seclusive training.

According to the normal protocol, the Dragonblood Legion would split up into small squads to prevent certain people from selfishly pocketing things. After all, the treasures in this world were quite shocking and could tempt the greed in many people.

However, Long Chen didn’t mind. Even if they took all the wealth of this world, he wouldn’t feel aggrieved. These heroic warriors had risked their lives to come here. Even if they did have some selfishness in their hearts, it would still go to strengthening the righteous side of the human race, forming a positive cycle.

Long Chen’s trust moved the experts sweeping through this world. Now, they understood why peerless heavenly geniuses like Yue Zifeng, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and others were willing to follow Long Chen.

Long Chen’s wits and charisma were truly inestimable. Just this one move taught them what trust was. With this trust, even if Long Chen wanted them to fight to the death, they would be willing to listen to his command.

Days turned into nights, and the cleanup proved to be a task more time-consuming than the actual battle itself. Although Xia Chen had made maps, it still took everyone a full month to do a rough cleanup of everything.

Once everyone brought back the treasures, even Long Chen jumped in shock. There were even more treasures than he had imagined: such as piles of spirit stones, immortal materials, and divine weapons. Long Chen simply took all the corpses and tossed them into the primal chaos space. Of course, those Eternal corpses had gone through Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s inspections before he took them.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran also took some of the precious immortal and divine metals—treasures that they didn’t have yet. As for what they did have, they still had ample stocks of them, so they didn’t take much.

The rest were distributed to the experts who had participated in the battle, and they were taken aback. Long Chen had done the most in this battle, but after claiming a few worthless corpses, he left the rest to those who had done the least. They vehemently objected to this.

In the end, under Long Chen’s forceful request, they split up the treasures amongst themselves, and every person got a portion.

Other than that, Long Chen also took the ancient bone books. He said that this information would be stored in an independent scripture pavilion of the High Firmament Academy, and every expert present would be allowed to study them as they pleased.

Once everything was dealt with, Long Chen had Xia Chen open the gate. After passing through, they saw numerous experts gathering on the other side.

When Long Chen and the others appeared, those experts didn’t hold back.

“Dean Long Chen, what is this? Why did you block the gate and prevent us from entering?”

“We’re all members of the human race! We also wanted to fight for the human race! Don’t you think you’re being too overbearing?”

“Were you holding negotiations with the other races inside? Did you take everything the Great Desolate World had to offer while giving us nothing? Without us, the Great Desolate World’s experts would never have considered a compromise!”

A lot of experts surrounded Long Chen and his companions. Amongst them were quite a few experts who had entered the Great Desolate World with them.

Those experts were of diverse cultivation bases, encompassing both the young and the old. Representatives from various major factions of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven were present, and Long Chen identified experts from the Eternal clans among them

“How shameless. When the critical moment came, you all ran. Yet now that it’s over, you immediately start talking about profit. How did such shameless people appear in our world?!” cursed one of the young experts who had fought alongside Long Chen before he could reply.

This youngster had seen shameless people, but their shamelessness was just off the chart. He and the others had just returned home with Long Chen after destroying the Great Desolate World, and their emotions were still running high. How could they tolerate such an insult? As a result, he couldn't help but vent his frustration with a direct curse.

“Shut up! Who do you think you are? Is this a place for you to speak?” reprimanded a half-step Eternal elder.

Seeing that the person cursing them was only a youngster with an ordinary cultivation base, this elder was incensed.

To everyone’s surprise, this little youngster was quite tough. He directly slapped that elder in the face.

“You old thing, when I was risking my life on the battlefield, you were hiding in some tortoise shell! Who do you think you are to even stand in this place!?” cursed the youngster.

His whole family had perished at the hands of traitors collaborating with the Great Desolate World. Having avenged them, he already realized his cherished dream. Hence, he stood resolute, unafraid of death.

“Courting death!”

When that elder was about to attack this youngster, all the experts behind Long Chen shouted, “I dare you to touch him!”

Having just undergone a bloody battle, all of them had an immense murderous aura. Thus, when they shouted in unison, that elder instantly turned pale and quivered. The next moment, a disgusting stench filled the air.

“Trash, all you can do is bully naive people. Scram! Don’t dirty senior apprentice-brother Long Chen’s eyes!”

Seeing this sanctimonious elder trembling in fear to the point of pissing his pants, that youngster kicked him away, refusing to even spare him a glance.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This elder held the position of sect leader in a middle-tier sect, boasting an exceptionally high status. However, he was actually so worthless, lacking even the ability to intimidate others.

“The Great Desolate World has changed masters. It is now the territory of the human race!” At this moment, Guo Ran stepped forward and made a loud announcement.

“What?!”

All those experts were filled with disbelief, not daring to believe their ears.

“Let’s go to the next place. We’ll see if the Eight Great Kings are stronger than the Six Great Lords.”

Long Chen waved his hand, and everyone followed him straight to the humanless world.
