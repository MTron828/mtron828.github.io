Chapter 1385 Which is Harder, My Fist or Your Life?

Translator: BornToBe

There was a large mass of experts gathered in front of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s gates. No one would be able to enter or leave without getting past them.

These people were all very young. The majority looked to be in their twenties, and their cultivation bases had reached the Jade Core realm.

These disciples’ robes were all different. Some were wearing ordinary robes, while some were wearing robes of their sects. Some were men and some were women, and they were all staring at the front.

At the front was a group of hundreds of experts wearing robes of the ancient family alliance. Their leader was precisely the rank nine Celestial that Meng Qi had almost killed last time, Luo Minghao.

Last time, Luo Minghao had almost been slain by Cloud when he was caught off guard. In the end, he had relied on a teleportation talisman to get away.

The results of their battle had filled Luo Minghao with rage. He viewed it as his greatest humiliation, so he had come again to challenge Meng Qi. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, Meng Qi refused to come out. In fact, not a single person acknowledged his existence. When he had erupted into curses, the Xuantian Dao Sect had kicked him out for his rudeness.

He was unable to swallow his fury at losing to Meng Qi, and he also didn’t dare to be reckless in the Xuantian Dao Sect. That was why he had brought a group of Jade Core disciples, with the excuse that this was an exchange of pointers amongst disciples. The Xuantian Dao Sect wouldn’t have a reason to suppress them with power.

After being kicked out of the Xuantian Dao Sect, Luo Minghao had blocked the entrance to the Xuantian Dao Sect. He and his group of ancient family disciples were constantly cursing the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples.

The higher-ups of the Xuantian Dao Sect had sent out orders to ignore them. Once Long Chen recovered, he would naturally put them in their places.

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples stopped going out. They did their best to avoid them.

This was fine for inner and outer sect disciples, but the workers often needed to go out to hunt down Magical Beasts or gather medicinal ingredients for resources.

The Xuantian Dao Sect had said that they were to not go out, and any of their lost wages would be compensated with double the amount.

However, some of the workers and outer sect disciples had already been outside when these people had sealed the entrance. Oftentimes, disciples would spend over ten days outside. Some would spend several months outside before returning.

They had left before Luo Minghao had arrived, but when they returned, the path was blocked. They refused to let them return. When the disciples showed the slightest resistance, they would beat them and heavily injure them.

Luo Minghao was very sinister. His people blocked the path, and if anyone tried to charge past, one of his people would pretend to be knocked down and shout that someone had attacked him. Then they would attack and beat that person. It was despicable to the peak.

Yet, the Xuantian Dao Sect maintained its silence, making the outside world believe that something had happened to Long Chen. Otherwise, with his character, there was no way he would hide like this.

As a result, Luo Minghao became even more arrogant, and under Pill Valley’s urging, more and more sects sent their elite disciples to keep watch over the Xuantian Dao Sect.

The sects that the Xuantian Dao Sect had obstructed before all sent their elite disciples over. This was their way of humiliating the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Last time, Pill Valley and the ancient races had been forced to leave dejectedly, and their Life Star experts had been slain. They had become laughingstocks.

This time, they naturally wouldn’t give up this opportunity to throw stones on them while they were down. Now, they were smart. Luo Minghao was the main character, and they were just watching the fun. However, this was humiliating enough.

During the past few days especially, quite a few disciples had mocked the Xuantian Dao Sect for having no warriors. Other than Long Chen, could it be that no one could come out to fight?

Some people also questioned whether or not Long Chen had died. If he had, then the Xuantian Dao Sect should hurry up and release the news so that everyone could celebrate.

Some of them even said more disgusting things, things that made the Xuantian Dao Sect’s people clench their teeth in fury.

Today, another worker who was returning from outside was blocked. After going around one person, he accidentally ‘knocked down’ someone else. He was given a vicious beating.

That worker was only at the Xiantian realm, while the attacker was a Jade Core rank eight Celestial. That worker didn’t have the slightest power to resist.

The rank eight Celestial controlled himself properly. The worker continuously coughed up blood, but he didn’t pass out, nor was there danger to his life.

“Idiot, is everyone in the Xuantian Dao Sect a coward? They only know how to hide inside the Xuantian Dao Sect and don’t even dare to stick out their heads?” sneered the rank eight Celestial. He intentionally spoke loudly to transmit his voice throughout the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Thousands of Jade Core disciples who came from various large sects all smiled mockingly. This scene was something they were accustomed to seeing now.

There were also hundreds of ancient race disciples smiling sinisterly. Last time, the Xuantian Dao Sect had caused the ancient races to lose face. That humiliation was something they would never forget.

Seeing the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples be tormented gave them a wicked pleasure.

The worker was once more beaten, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. He looked like he was on the verge of dying.

“Doesn’t Long Chen think himself to be so amazing? Then why doesn’t he come out and fight? He’s just a coward!” shouted the rank eight Celestial.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen... he’s not a coward, he’s an unrivaled hero! You’re the trash...” The worker didn’t have much life within him, but he still struggled, using his final bit of energy to roar.

“Damn worker, you think you’re tough, huh? Die!”

The rank eight Celestial hadn’t expected an insignificant Xiantian worker to contradict him. He punched him again, this time with fury. He no longer held back. If struck, it would definitely kill him.

The worker just stared coldly at the rank eight Celestial. There was no way for him to block this fist. Rather than fear, this killing blow made his back stand up straighter.

He knew that he would die. But before he died, he wouldn’t allow others to insult that god-like existence in front of him.

Pow!

Suddenly, a hand caught the fist. A black-robed man appeared in front of the worker.

“Long... Long Chen!” The worker’s voice trembled.

Long Chen’s gaze was icy cold. He looked like a demon king from hell, icily staring at the rank eight Celestial.

“What did you just say? You want to fight me? Come, let’s fight!”

“I... I...”

The rank eight Celestial felt like he had fallen into an iceberg. It was like a death god was staring at him. His voice shuddered, and he wasn’t even able to speak.

Long Chen’s appearance shocked everyone. The distant Luo Minghao instantly jumped out of his chair.

Everyone had thought Long Chen was already dead, or at the very least, on his deathbed struggling against the curse. His appearance came as a complete surprise.

Cracking sounds suddenly rang out. Everyone was horrified to see the rank eight Celestial collapse on the ground, all his bones broken.

Not only were his bones broken, but his Neidan had been shattered. His spiritual yuan now began to escape out of his body and into the world. He had been turned into a cripple.

A powerful rank eight Jade Core Celestial didn’t even have the slightest ability to fight against Long Chen. He could only lay on the ground, wailing.

“Junior brother, that was a good showing.” Long Chen gave the worker a medicinal pill.

The worker wept tears of gratitude. Having been called brother by Long Chen, he felt like even death was worth it.

“I still remember how he humiliated you. You can get your humiliation back. Not avenging enmity, repaying enmity with kindness, that’s not our style. Within the merciless cultivation world, using power is the most effective method.” Long Chen patted his shoulder.

“Can... can I really?” The worker was still afraid, not daring to attack.

“The brothers of I, Long Chen, can do anything. Don’t make me look down on you!” Long Chen frowned.

“Alright!” The disciple swallowed Long Chen’s pill and fully recovered instantly. He directly kicked the former rank eight Celestial.

“Bastards, you-”

PFFT!

Someone in the ground was about to speak up against them when a bolt of lightning pierced through his body, killing him instantly.

“No one is allowed to randomly fart in front of me. If you don’t want to die, keep your farts inside your mouths!” said Long Chen coldly.

At this time, the worker of the Xuantian Dao Sect had kicked that person a dozen times. Finally, his kick caused the rank eight Celestial’s head to explode, and the sound of screaming came to an end.

Just at this moment, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s gates opened, and countless familiar figures appeared in front of Long Chen’s eyes.

Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, Guo Ran, Gu Yang, Song Mingyuan, Li Qi, Hua Shiyu, Wang Zhen, and the others were all present. Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er were smiling tearfully.

“Dragonblood Legion, hear my orders! Kill them all!” Seeing those familiar faces, Long Chen felt a grand feeling, and he roared.

“Kill!”

Following Long Chen’s order, the Dragonblood Legion’s warriors roared as well, taking out their weapons and charging at the disciples who had come to watch the fun.

In truth, they had long since been filled with fury, but the Xuan Master had ordered them not to do anything in order to keep up the appearance that Long Chen was on his deathbed.

Now that Long Chen had appeared, it was time to vent all their fury. They charged at these bastards that had humiliated them.

“Long Chen, you dare?!” roared Luo Minghao. All the Dragonblood Legion, all the Xuantian Dao Sect’s elite disciples were attacking.

“Hmph, what a huge joke. Is there anything in this world that I don’t dare do?” Long Chen sent the worker beside him to safety. All their humiliation had been caused by him, so he owed them all a debt.

After sending that worker off, he charged toward Luo Minghao.

“Today, I want to see which is harder, my fist or your life!”
