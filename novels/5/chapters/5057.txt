Chapter 5046 Greed

The sound of Long Chen’s flame sword flying through the air was like thunder. Standing on top of it, with two long flame wings on his back, Long Chen appeared flashy.

His powerful flame fluctuations attracted many experts, and as soon as he switched to this style of travel, no one dared to fly past his head.

Even if they wanted to go past him, they went all the way around him to avoid offending him. After all, all cultivators knew that flame element cultivators had explosive tempers. The moment flame cultivators got angry, they exploded, so no one wished to provoke them lightly. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Just like that, Long Chen sped along. When he reached the city, he used its transportation formations for free. Experiencing such special treatment, Long Chen had to acknowledge that Pill Valley’s power was immense.

All the transportation formations heading for the Glacial Heaven Domain were now free of charge, sponsored by Pill Valley. On the way there, some young disciples of Pill Valley even provided tea and refreshments for travelers.

Those disciples looked young, but they were shockingly powerful. They acted courteously on the surface, but everyone could sense a powerful pressure coming from them.

When these nine star Doyens from the Pill Valley exuded an aura that could overwhelm a half-step Heavenly Chosen, countless experts were stunned.

Long Chen was startled as well. Since when did they become so low-key? However, from the arrogance deep within these disciples’ eyes, Long Chen realized Pill Valley had ordered them to act humble here to show just how warmly they accepted their guests.

A single glance was enough for Long Chen to see that these disciples were extremely strong. They were definitely not ordinary cultivators, but experts who had stepped onto true battlefields and experienced the baptism of blood and fire.

In contrast, during the Long clan’s elite competition, Long Chen didn’t see a single true expert, including Long Tianrui. None of them were elites tempered through the battlefield. Although they were powerful and had a great deal of combat experience, they lacked the viciousness and decisiveness that came from brushing past the boundary between life and death.

Long Tianrui’s power was unquestionable. Long Chen didn’t know her well, but he believed that even in the ancient era, the Long clan viewed her as a future successor to be raised. Thus, they would not permit her to come to any harm.

Zhao Qingtian, Ye Lingxiao, Jiang Wuwang, and the others were the same. They were powerful, but unable to bring out the full potential of that strength, lacking the decisive killing power.

However, these disciples of Pill Valley were true warriors who had stepped onto the battlefield. They had survived countless bloody battles, and their sharp gazes reflected that experience.

Although they were intentionally hiding it, they still exuded an aura akin to sheathed sharp blades. Of course, compared to the Dragonblood Legion, there was still a large gap. However, they were much stronger than the Long clan’s disciples.

The Brahma Pill Valley used this humble attitude to draw people in. But anyone who dared to disrespect these disciples would fall into a trap. Long Chen witnessed an expert of the demon race taking advantage of a female disciple while she poured him tea, touching her hand inappropriately.

As a result, the female disciple immediately turned hostile and cut that demon expert in half with her sword. The demon expert was a nine star Doyen, and as the sword sliced him, it exuded a terrifying heat that incinerated him to ashes. This scene shocked even Heavenly Chosens.

After killing him, the female disciple returned to her bright, amicable appearance. She continued pouring tea as if nothing had happened.

Long Chen curled his lips. There were countless tricks in this world, and the Brahma Pill Valley had many up its sleeve. Through this particular trick, they showed how warmly they treated guests while displaying their unquestionable might.

That way, once the guests entered the Glacial Heaven Domain, they would behave better. Otherwise, some people would think too highly of themselves and cause trouble in the Brahma Pill Valley’s territory.

After all, the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain belonged to the Brahma Pill Valley, and here, everyone had to obey their rules.

Long Chen approached the line.

When those disciples saw Long Chen, their pupils suddenly shrank. Anyone familiar with fire could recognize the fiery aura emanating from him.

The Sun Flame. Which alchemist didn’t know of it? Long Chen’s flame exhibited the Sun Flame’s fluctuations, yet it lacked its soul. Based on normal standards, it would be considered a seed of the Sun Flame.

Even with Huo Linger suppressing the fluctuations to around thirty percent, its aura still made these disciples salivate.

While these disciples tried to act normally, Long Chen could see the greed and envy in their eyes. Thankfully, there were many people around. Otherwise, Long Chen guessed they would immediately attack him for his Sun Flame.

“Friend, your flame energy is extremely pure. If you join the Brahma Pill Valley, under a master’s guidance and with the Divine Venerate’s light guiding your way, your future will be limitless,” probed one female disciple of Pill Valley.

It seemed that she wanted to recruit Long Chen into the Brahma Pill Valley. However, from her gaze, Long Chen suspected her intentions were not as straightforward.

If Long Chen were truly enticed, she would definitely act as a mediator, luring him into a trap to secretly kill him for his Sun Flame.

Fortunately, the flame runes on Long Chen’s face flowed naturally, masking his identity well.

In response, Long Chen sneered, “I’m not interested. With your hungry looks, I might end up as a meal before even stepping foot in Pill Valley.”

“You...” Her expression changed, mirrored by the other disciples. Long Chen had hit the mark, exposing their true intentions. After all, any flame cultivator would find the Sun Flame irresistible. Their discomfort was palpable now that they had been called out.

The female disciple hesitated. Should she move to apprehend Long Chen for provoking them? But it was obvious that the few of them wouldn’t be able to subdue him. Moreover, a brawl would cause a scene, which wasn’t desirable either. She was at a loss for what to do.

“Shuang-er, don’t be rude!” scolded an elderly voice.

When an elder wearing Pill Valley’s robes walked over, the disciples were reinvigorated, their gazes toward Long Chen growing even greedier.

Long Chen sized up the elder—a one-vein Heaven Saint. So what? Even after their show of humility, were they still unwilling to let him pass?

“Young friend, may I ask which sect or faction you belong to?” asked the elder as he scrutinized Long Chen. His expression was polite, but his powerful heaven vein energy locked onto Long Chen.
