Chapter 2944 Sending Charcoal in Snow

“Good child, you really are great!”

Long Chen was delighted. He had been worried about not having enough world source energy here, but this old fellow had actually come just for him!

Long Chen was admiring that sweeping elder more and more. Just as he said, bad things might be good things tomorrow.

If the academy hadn’t let off these two old ghosts, how could they have schemed against him here so delightfully? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Long Chen’s skin turned red as endless world source energy poured into him. This was the most primal energy of the world.

Long Chen had once encountered it in the Martial Heaven Continent. The Martial Heaven Continent had passed all of its energy to him so that he could protect all the lives that were born from it.

Although the immortal world’s source energy was different from the Martial Heaven Continent’s source energy, he still remembered this aura.

Furthermore, for some reason, he felt an indescribable familiarity with this world source energy.

Although it was torrential and practically trying to rip him apart, when it actually entered his body, it became gentle and warm. It constantly strengthened every inch of his body.

The world source energy could stimulate the latent talent within a person’s body. It was truly the most primal energy and critically important to a cultivator.

As this energy poured into his body, he sensed his essence blood being purified and his physical body rapidly growing stronger. Two dragons then appeared on his arms. Even Huo Long and Lei Long came out to absorb this energy.

This energy was the source of all things. The flame and lightning energies were only a portion of it, but this energy was immensely beneficial to Lei Long and Huo Long.

The elder saw everything that was happening to Long Chen, and he was shocked. He had already opened seven sluice gates. For ordinary experts, only one gate was opened, and three gates would instantly kill them.

However, Long Chen was still enduring with seven gates open. Now, when the elder saw the two dragon marks light up on Long Chen’s arms, he snorted and activated the formation disc, opening another ten sluice gates.

As a result, the space Long Chen was in rumbled, and water poured in crazily. It felt like knives were tearing apart his body. Anyone else would have long since died.

However, while Long Chen was clenching his teeth as if he was bitterly enduring, he was laughing inside.

He felt more and more world source energy pouring into his 108,000 stars.

As he anticipated, his 108,000 stars began to transform, and a rune lit up on one of those stars. Blazing with divine light, it branded itself at the core of the star.

After that rune was branded on his star, he could clearly sense that star had gained a trace of immortal spiritual aura. Furthermore, he sensed another kind of energy in his body.

This star had finished mortal transcendence. In other words, it was a star of the Immortal Dao. It would continue to generate more and more of this energy for him.

The second, third, fourth, and fifth stars began to transform one after another. Watching them transform, Long Chen almost cried out in excitement.

However, his excitement then faded. At this rate, even three whole days wouldn’t be enough to transform all his stars.

He was already aware that a person could only spend six hours here. After six hours, the pool would close down, but there wasn’t enough energy yet.

“Old ghost… you won’t be able to kill me! I refuse to believe that there’s no one outside! As long as I can last a bit longer, someone will notice, and you’ll be doomed!” shouted Long Chen.

Even as he shouted, Long Chen acted like he was reaching his limit. These acting skills could definitely be called another kind of power. It really looked as if he was about to die.

“Idiot, I’ve already arranged things. No one will notice me here, so just wait for death. Are you afraid you’re not dying fast enough? Then let me help you out.” The elder sneered and opened another ten gates.

BOOM!

This space rumbled intensely, but Long Chen was so happy he almost kissed that old ghost. More and more of his stars were transforming. This feeling of fortune couldn’t be described.

For his enemy to help him out so much, he would never be able to forget this feeling.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, Long Chen actually spat out a mouthful of blood and roared, “Old ghost, your daddy here is tougher than you. You can’t kill me. As long as I endure six hours, you’re definitely dead!”

A person could only stay here for six hours. Once the time was up, they would be automatically transported out. At this moment, the first two hours were almost past, so there were four more left. In truth, Long Chen was even more panicked than the elder. At this point, he had only transformed over three thousand stars. It was still too slow.

There wouldn’t be enough time at this rate. He had to further antagonize this elder.

As a result, the elder snorted and activated the formation disc once more. However, he was shocked. Just how strong was Long Chen’s physical body? He still hadn’t exploded?

He began opening gates one by one because he had activated too many. The current of the divine flame spirit pool might change and be sensed if he went too fast.

He quickly opened up fifty sluice gates, but Long Chen was still alive.

When he reached a hundred, Long Chen ‘fainted’ several times but then revived himself after just a moment. Seeing this, the elder was so furious that he wanted to smash the formation disc apart. Long Chen’s adaptability was extremely high. He got used to the new force every time.

The elder began to sweat. He had never seen such a monster before. Long Chen practically had an undying body, and even he was getting afraid.

Time passed bit by bit. The elder had opened one hundred and fifty sluice gates, but Long Chen continued to appear on the verge of death without actually dying.

The elder finally realized that something was wrong. Long Chen had remained in this state for too long, so he was starting to grow suspicious.

He suspected that there was something special on Long Chen capable of allowing him to slowly adjust to the power of the divine flame spirit pool. The time was going to be up soon, but Long Chen had yet to die.

“Fuck, just die!” the elder suddenly roared furiously. The runes on the formation disc all activated, and he vanished.

BOOM!

Long Chen felt like the spirit pool was exploding as endless world source energy poured toward him. It was like a volcano eruption.
