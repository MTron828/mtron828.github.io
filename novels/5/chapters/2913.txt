Chapter 2902 Using Money to Pave the Way

When Long Chen entered the mist, a faint spiritual pressure pressed down on him. And the further he went, the greater the spiritual pressure.

This spiritual pressure magnified the negative emotions inside a person’s heart. Adding the mist on the outside, any random thought could instantly manifest itself as an illusion around them.

However, this kind of spiritual pressure could be ignored by Long Chen. As he charged forward with the Berserk Blood Mammoth, Mu Qingyun and the others were quickly left behind.

There was no way around it. People without strong enough souls or wills would need to get used to this spiritual pressure bit by bit. If they charged forward recklessly like Long Chen, they would quickly become bewildered.

Seeing Long Chen charge forward on his own, completely ignoring the formation, Luo Bing and Luo Ning clenched their fists. They watched anxiously, their palms covered in sweat.

“Chu Kuang has also passed through the Devil Slaughter Path! He’s so fast!” A startled cry rang out and drew everyone’s attention. They looked over to see that Chu Kuang’s side had also opened the door and were rushing over.

Perhaps Chu Kuang had sensed something as he also quickened the pace, charging out.

Due to how fast Long Chen was going, his soul began to prickle. But it didn’t affect him.

He then ordered the Berserk Blood Mammoth to quicken the pace. As a result, the forest within this mist was being crushed as it rushed through. The sound of flying sand and stone followed him.

In an incense stick’s worth of time, Long Chen reached the top. There was an altar here, and the flag was stuck at the center.

Long Chen then rushed up and placed a jade plate in his hand into a notch in the altar. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After that, the altar lit up. The mist in this region slowly dispersed.

Long Chen was the first to reach it. He left a mark on the altar, and the pressure of the formation on Long Chen’s side began to weaken. This way, Mu Qingyun and the others could rush up easier.

There were eight lamps set up on the altar. As Long Chen pressed his hand on the jade plate, his immortal spiritual energy was flowing into it, and the first lamp slowly lit up.

The flag could only be taken when all eight lamps were lit. However, each lamp required a certain amount of time to light up. Furthermore, each person was limited in how much energy they could feed it. In other words, the more people sending energy in at the same time, the faster it would light up. It had nothing to do with a person’s cultivation base.

“What’s that?!”

Suddenly, someone cried out in shock. A white light had enveloped Chu Kuang, Gu Fei, Tang Yaochen, Li Chengbei, Xiang Kejie, Yang Fang, and the other experts on that side. They shot toward the core region like a shooting star.

“Barrier Piercing Shuttle Talismans! Those cost hundreds of thousands of immortal crystals! It seems that they’re using up over a hundred of them!” Someone recognized the white light. It was something formed by igniting over a hundred of such talismans.

Chu Kuang had actually ignited over ten million immortal crystals. Wasn’t that too crazy? Furthermore, it was clear to everyone that the reason Gu Fei, Tang Yaochen, Li Chengbei, Xiang Kejie, Yang Fang, and the others had joined him was due to a similar business transaction.

“This is definitely cheating! What is even the point of holding this competition in the future?! Whoever has more money would just win!” Luo Ning shot up furiously.

“Financial power is the foundation of cultivation. It is even more important than talent. Do you not even understand this? No matter how great your talent is, without any resources, what can you do? Chu Kuang’s actions have not violated the rules, so where do these accusations of cheating come from?” sneered the magistrate beside Chu Huairen.

All the disciples were infuriated. This was truly cheating, and completely brazen cheating at that. Using money to win this competition was practically blasphemy against the High Firmament Academy!

People couldn’t help looking toward the head judge, but they saw that he remained indifferent.

Feeling disappointed, they then turned to Heaven Master Yun Yang, hoping for some justice.

Heaven Master Yun Yang shook his head. “The path of cultivation is to seek something that will benefit you. To use any means necessary is not necessarily contemptible. Every scrap of resources that you fight for is another opportunity to increase your power, which increases your chance of survival. In front of your own life, the restrictions of morality are meaningless. Although this might sound cruel and shameless, it is reality. You will perhaps come to understand it in the future.”

Just at this moment, one of the lamps was lit up by Long Chen. However, just as he started lighting up the second lamp, the Berserk Blood Mammoth raised its giant tusk and smashed it down

BOOM!

Dust and dirt exploded. Gu Fei’s body was sent flying, while the Berserk Blood Mammoth was also knocked back a few steps.

“Long Chen, die!”

Gu Fei slammed his hands on the ground, causing countless golden swords to fly out of the earth toward Long Chen.

Long Chen was a bit surprised. Gu Fei was actually capable of using magical arts before igniting his divine flame. Furthermore, this technique meant that he was a metal attribute expert.

Long Chen instinctively retreated, avoiding the area of Gu Fei’s attack. However, at that moment, he instantly had a bad feeling. The space he was retreating into felt strange.

“Scram!” A sneer rang out. After that, Long Chen saw Tang Yaochen holding a formation disc pointed at him, and his expression instantly changed.

Long Chen vanished, reappearing right outside the door of the Devil Slaughter Path.

He was shocked and infuriated as he had been schemed against. Gu Fei had been nothing more than a distraction for Tang Yaochen to use a formation to send him away.

“Long Chen, I won’t kill you. I’ll let you watch as the divine flag is taken away by me, while you are powerless to do anything. Hahaha!” Chu Kuang’s arrogant laughter rang out from the top of the mountain. There was also the sound of the death throes of the Berserk Blood Mammoth.

Long Chen’s fists then creaked and killing intent exploded in his eyes. Chu Kuang and the others had intentionally tormented the Berserk Blood Mammoth before killing it just to provoke him.

“Since you all want to die so badly, I will make sure that you do.”

At this moment, thunderforce appeared beneath his feet, and a pair of lightning wings appeared on his back. Like a bolt of lightning, he rushed back to the core.
