Chapter 4237: Finally Here

“Mo Nian, you bastard! Face your death!”

When the crystal coffin opened, Yan Wuji came flying out and let out a furious roar.

However, his appearance startled everyone. The indomitable Yan Wuji was now pitch-black. His yellow robes were now black, and he looked like he had gone through a pit of coal.

Along with Yan Wuji, dozens of charred corpses also flew out. Upon seeing those corpses, someone cried out, “Immemorial Flame Devils!”

Those corpses were withered like dry firewood, and the runes on their bodies had already grown dim. However, they still gave off a frightening pressure.

“Those are corpses that have reached the innate Heaven Venerate realm!”

With just a glance, it was clear that these corpses had died countless years ago. Most likely, they had been refined into puppets.

These puppets seemed to have used up all their energy. After flying out of the crystal coffin, their bodies rotted away until they turned into dust.

Everyone was shocked by this. Mo Nian’s crystal coffin actually had such a terrifying mechanism inside of it. Although these puppets weren’t as powerful as real innate Heaven Venerates, their power was not bad.

As for Yan Wuji, he had probably been fighting them all this time. But although his outer appearance looked wretched, he wasn’t actually injured. His true power was shocking.

As soon as Yan Wuji flew out of the coffin, he turned to Mo Nian and shot toward him.

Just at that moment, the Grand Yan’s imperial experts let out startled cries. They were holding down the crystal coffin, but it suddenly unleashed a burst of divine light that sent them flying.

The crystal coffin then vanished, reappearing right in front of Mo Nian.

Yan Wuji was flying straight at Mo Nian. But when the crystal coffin suddenly appeared in front of him, his expression completely changed, and he hastily changed directions.

Just now, he had suffered immensely. The inside of the crystal coffin was its own world. If he hadn’t defeated those puppets, outsiders would have been unable to open the coffin.

Seeing it again, he was finally afraid. This coffin was too bizarre. Inside of it, his power was greatly reduced. Fortunately, he was powerful enough that even in that weakened state, he could still defeat those puppets and escape.

Still, he didn’t want to get caught in this crystal coffin again. Seeing the chance, he dodged and attacked Mo Nian from a different angle.

To everyone’s surprise, Yan Wuji’s attack speed was so astonishing that the crystal coffin couldn’t catch up with him. Having utmost confidence in his speed, he directly unleashed a punch that even encapsulated Long Chen within it.

“I’ll deal with him.”

Mo Nian was the one who spoke first. The next moment, his shovel reappeared in his hand, being used like a shield to receive Yan Wuji’s attack.

An explosive clang then rang out in the air, accompanied by the sight of giant sparks. Mo Nian was sent flying along with his crystal coffin.

“You just watch. Keep an eye on the surroundings. I’ll accompany this foolish child for a game,” transmitted Mo Nian to Long Chen.

Mo Nian suddenly put away the crystal coffin. As he flew back, he pointed his shovel at Yan Wuji and cursed, “You bastard! How dare you repay my kindness like this?! If it weren’t for me, you’d still be stuck in that damp coffin of yours! Keep acting this way, and I’ll start taking this seriously! I could dig you out of a hole, and I can bury you back in one as well!”

“Fuck you!”

.

Yan Wuji directly cursed him. Seeing Mo Nian put away his coffin, Yan Wuji was immediately reinvigorated and shot after him.

“Hmph, a mouth that eats shit really is smelly. Just how much did you eat that day? Are you full?” cursed Mo Nian.

“Die!” Yan Wuji’s fists danced through the air, unleashing wild gusts akin to blades that sliced through the void.

This scene stunned most people around. It had to be known that Yan Wuji had yet to summon his manifestation and was fighting only with his most basic power. However, this force was on par with a Triple Supreme fighting for their life.

“The descendants of the Human Emperors really are frightening. Even after defeating so many Flame Devil puppets, he’s not the slightest bit injured. He’s probably not even in his true combat state yet,” sighed someone.

“They all have the bloodline of the Human Emperors, inheriting the blessings of their ancestors. Who knows what kind of power he can unleash in his full-power state?”

“All that remains of the Five Emperors is the Grand Xia and the Grand Yan, but the Grand Xia has already declined. Apparently, all they have is Xia Guhong alone, a lovesick fool. After his loved one passed away, he spent the rest of his life alone. He doesn’t even have any heirs. Once he’s dead, the line of the Grand Xia will be fully gone.”

It was said that only two of the five Emperors’ lines had survived that ancient battle. The other three were so badly wounded that they ultimately faded away.

Now there were only descendants from the Grand Yan Human Emperor and the Grand Xia Human Emperor. The Grand Xia’s only heir was actually infatuated with love; this was something that people respected yet also felt pity for. After all, he was the hope of that entire line of the Human Emperor. It was a shame that this line would never continue.

In any case, the Human Emperors were the hope of the human race. People had been excited to see that Yan Wuji was one of their descendants, thinking that the human race had finally produced a suitable leader.

However, Yan Wuji’s incredible arrogance was too irritating. Furthermore, when Mo Nian appeared, he began cursing like a fishwife in the streets, leaving them speechless. No matter how strong such a person was, it would be difficult for them to unite the human race.

Even so, everyone was excited to see just how powerful the descendants of the Human Emperor were. They all wanted to know whether or not they had inherited the divine might of the Human Emperors.

After all, the Human Emperors represented an entire era for the human race. They were supreme existences.

The five Emperors were both born and faded in the same era. While two lines still descended from them, they were only descendants, not the true Human Emperors. After the five Emperors vanished, no more Human Emperors appeared.

Even so, all members of the human race felt profound reverence for the Human Emperors, and they hoped to be able to see a spark of their former light from Yan Wuji.

Yan Wuji repeatedly attacked with his fists, forcing Mo Nian back. But Mo Nian’s unremarkable shovel was constantly blocking his blows. Although it looked as if Yan Wuji had taken the upper hand, it was clear that Mo Nian wasn’t using his full power either.

“What are they doing? Yan Wuji keeps saying that he’s going to kill Mo Nian, but he’s not even using any killing blows?” Eventually, people grew impatient. The long-anticipated battle that they had been waiting for was boring.

“Yan Wuji is still probing Mo Nian. As long as Mo Nian reveals the slightest opening, Yan Wuji will launch an all-out killing blow. Unfortunately, Mo Nian is too crafty, and Yan Wuji isn’t able to lock him down. If Yan Wuji can’t lock him down, Mo Nian will just dodge any killing blow. As a result, they can only fight like this,” said an expert of the senior generation, explaining the crux of this matter.

Yan Wuji wanted to kill Mo Nian more than anyone here, but if he couldn’t lock him down, he couldn’t unleash his full power on him.

However, Long Chen didn’t agree with the senior’s assessment. He knew that Yan Wuji was warming up to enter his best fighting state.

Just then, the martial stage shook intensely and the karmic luck bead began to rapidly spin.

“It’s finally here!”

Long Chen’s pupils shrank. The thing that Mo Nian had mentioned was about to appear.
