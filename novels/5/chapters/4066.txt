Chapter 4055 Dragon Sparrow Divine Might

As the claw fell, a burst of demonic qi erupted. They couldn’t see the attacker, but from that giant claw, they could tell that it was a Heaven Venerate from the demonic beast race.

“You dare to steal from my Soaring Dragon Company?! Courting death!”

At this moment, the Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerate rose. His injury was not light, but he still roared when he saw someone come to take what was his.

Still, it was too late for him to rush over. Clearly, this demonic beast Heaven Venerate had been lying in wait for a long time just for this opportunity.

Long Chen’s emotions swirled with a mix of shock and fury. He had the urge to smash this fellow with the Earth Cauldron, but he was also afraid that they had come prepared and were baiting him into using it.

After all, Long Chen knew little about the Earth Cauldron. If others had a method to restrain it or instantly become its master, he would lose it.

However, he had no other choice at this time. His Blood Qi was still fluctuating wildly from unleashing those two previous attacks, so he couldn’t unleash another attack without some time to recover. Clenching his teeth, Long Chen stopped caring about his misgivings.

As Long Chen readied himself to strike back with the Earth Cauldron, an unexpected turn of events unfolded. The void suddenly tore open, and a brilliant flash of saber-light sliced through it with unparalleled precision, like a divine stroke.

The formidable giant claw, which seemed indomitable a moment ago, was no match for the overwhelming power of the saber-light. It was sliced apart with astonishing ease, as if it were no more than soft tofu. Blood then gushed forth, creating a crimson shower, accompanied by a gut-wrenching shriek that pierced the air.

“The Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow! Xia Guhong, you…!” The demonic beast roared furiously, but his words were cut short, becoming indistinct as fear gripped him. The sight of the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow had struck terror into his heart, and he could no longer bear to face such a formidable opponent.

On the other hand, Long Chen was delighted. He hadn’t expected Xia Guhong to take action at this critical time. With the attack that destroyed the claw of that demonic beast, he also cut open a gulch in heaven and earth, blocking the Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company.

“We’re leaving!” Long Chen knew that Xia Guhong had created this opportunity for him. With Xia Chen and the others, they got on the flying boat and whistled away, rapidly vanishing.

Long Chen and the others had just fled when the void repeatedly exploded behind them. One terrifying aura after another appeared as multiple Heaven Venerates were arriving, but they were one step too late. Long Chen had already fled.

These Heaven Venerates then looked at the endless heavenly river and hesitated. In the end, no one dared to enter the heavenly river.

The legends were that the higher your cultivation base, the more likely you would provoke some terrifying existence in the depths of the heavenly river. Perhaps Immortal Kings and World Kings would have some chance of survival, but a Heaven Venerate essentially had no chance of coming out alive.

Let alone entering the unexplored parts of the heavenly river, even if they were to use the safer shipping routes, Heaven Venerates would often face blockades. They would end up being targeted by terrifying existences within the heavenly river, and once they did, the other people with the Heaven Venerate would have difficulty fleeing.

The heavenly river was a place that caused even Heaven Venerates to feel fear. Thus, even the allure of the Earth Cauldron could not make them take the risk of entering.

They still had no idea where Long Chen was going. If he were to just run around randomly in the heavenly river, they would definitely draw out some terrifying existences.

“Xia Guhong, what do you think you’re doing?!”

The Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerate roared furiously, but no one replied. Xia Guhong did not appear in the end.

However, an attack that cut through the body of a Heaven Venerate as easily as tofu and tore open a spatial restriction that could not be crossed was definitely not something that could be done with an ordinary divine weapon.

As primal chaos qi still hung in the air, everyone could tell who had attacked. It had to be Xia Guhong who possessed the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s karmic luck.

While the rumor was that the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow had vanished, a trace of its karmic luck remained on Xia Guhong. It was said that this trace of karmic luck was enough for him to unleash three attacks.

After three attacks, he would need to recuperate for a long time to recover that karmic luck.

Back in the Violet Flame Heaven, Xia Guhong had used the might of the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow to intimidate all his enemies. He said that each attack would definitely take one of their lives. At the time, no one had dared to test him.

Now that the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s divine might reappeared, although it was just a trace of the power of its karmic luck, it was enough to stop them.

Xia Guhong didn’t speak or appear, but that simple attack was enough to stop these Heaven Venerates in their tracks.

However, as a result of this, these people were all filled with hatred for Xia Guhong. He had caused them to lose their chance to obtain the Earth Cauldron. Among them, the Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerate was particularly enraged. Failing to secure the Earth Cauldron was humiliating enough, but being injured by a group of brats was a grave blow to his pride and reputation.

Long Chen had entered the heavenly river. So, in theory, they should all leave now as their efforts were all useless.

However, not one of them left. Many of them refused to believe that Long Chen would really dare to cross the heavenly river. They suspected that Long Chen was planning on tricking people into leaving while he actually went in a loop and stealthily returned to the Violet Flame Heaven.

In the end, they didn’t loosen their traps throughout the heavenly river and continued to guard this area, waiting for Long Chen to return. However, it was fated that their efforts would go in vain.

At this time, Long Chen and the others had switched flying boats. In a giant ship, they started crossing the heavenly river.

“Heaven Venerates really is terrifying. The difference between Heaven Venerates and Earth Venerates really is immense,” said Guo Ran.

The others also felt a burst of fear. After all, Heaven Venerates were all unimaginably powerful. Their strength was so overwhelming that even when they all joined forces, they couldn’t beat one. So, if they didn’t flee this time, they wouldn’t even have a chance to survive.

Xia Chen had even used a formation to separate that Heaven Venerate from the Heavenly Daos, and then Guo Ran and Long Chen had attacked at the best times. But even then, they were unable to pose any fatal danger to that Heaven Venerate, leaving them feeling dejected.

Guo Ran in particular had thought that he would be able to sweep through the heavens now, only to be beaten so badly that his confidence was gone. He was listless.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s not that you’re too weak but that your enemies are too strong. To be able to fight across so many realms is already very impressive,” said Yu Qingxuan. She couldn’t help encouraging them when she saw how dejected they were.

A Heaven Venerate was an almighty existence, so it was already a huge accomplishment for them to be able to flee from one. But they still weren’t satisfied? They seemed to be brooding just because they couldn’t beat a Heaven Venerate.

“Qingxuan, ignore them. They’re doing it on purpose just to hear you say that,” laughed Long Chen.

Ignoring whether or not they could win, the fact that they had the courage to stand against a Heaven Venerate was already enough to make them famous.

Hence, their dissatisfied appearances were another way of showing off. They wanted Yu Qingxuan to see it and praise them, and she actually fell for it.

“Hehe, boss, what are you saying? We’re clearly very dissatisfied with our display…” Guo Ran awkwardly laughed.

Guo Ran's awkward laughter was a clear giveaway, so Yu Qingxuan couldn't help but shake her head in amusement. It was evident that their apparent dejection was staged, all for the sake of her attention.

“In truth, a Heaven Venerate is not unmatched. My formation just now wasn’t strong enough to fully cut him off from the Heavenly Daos. If I could fully separate him from the Heavenly Daos, we could launch all-out attacks and exhaust him. In the end, we might be able to kill him,” said Xia Chen.

“If we were prepared beforehand and willing to pay any price, perhaps we could beat a Heaven Venerate. But it is impossible for us to kill one. A Heaven Venerate is one with heaven and earth. So, if he wants to flee, we can’t stop him. I think if we wish to kill a Heaven Venerate, we cannot use technique. We can only use brute force,” said Long Chen.

“What kind of brute force?” asked Guo Ran.

“A force that can destroy a world. This can come from a magical art, a divine weapon, or a formation. In any case, the principle is that this power must destroy laws and the foundation of the ten thousand Daos. It must be truly apocalyptic,” said Long Chen.

“I understand. If our power doesn’t go through a qualitative change, it cannot pose a threat to a Heaven Venerate.” Xia Chen nodded.

“Not good! Boss, there’s a huge whirlpool up ahead! We’ve lost control of the battleship and are being sucked into the whirlpool!”

Suddenly, the Dragonblood warrior in charge of steering cried out.
