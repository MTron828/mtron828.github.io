Chapter 3408 Long Chen’s Betrothal GiftF0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You really are great! You won me face this time. Those two old ghosts have definitely received some bribes from the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. So, now that the race leader is on our side, I want to see just how they will explain themselves to the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, hahaha!” Lei Yuner clenched her fists excitedly as she walked with Long Chen.

“First, let me just say that we can be friends, but I cannot accept having children with you. Let me be entirely clear. I don’t want a misunderstanding to occur between us,” said Long Chen sternly.

Hearing this, Lei Yuner was instantly disappointed. Even her eyes reddened. “How can you be this way? We’re so familiar with each other already, right? What’s the big deal with having children? If you don’t have children with me, won’t I be laughed at by others?”

What’s the big deal with having children? Long Chen almost choked to death. It seemed that in the demonic beast race, having children was as casual as playing a game.

Lei Yuner was like an aggrieved child, leaving Long Chen speechless. It wasn’t as if he had ever agreed to have children with her from the start.

“Hey, don’t cry…” said Long Chen hastily when he saw tears.

“You don’t like me. Is that because I’m not beautiful? I know that I don’t meet the standards of the human race’s aesthetics… But I’ll treat you well! The Lightning Falcon race will not let you down. Why won’t you agree…” Lei Yuner seemed completely aggrieved as tears constantly tumbled down her face.

Long Chen felt like his head was exploding. As expected, not being from the same race led to some difficulty communicating.

“I’ll tell you the truth. I have a heart-devil, so I can’t have children,” said Long Chen helplessly.

“Really?” Lei Yuner looked up, feeling startled. She stopped crying.

A heart-devil could form in any race, but mostly humans. It was rarer amongst demonic beasts. Humans were the most contradictory race. Amongst demon beasts, it was rarer for contradicting states of mind to form.

Humans had a far higher chance of forming a heart-devil. Furthermore, in that state, it was taboo to have children, or it could too easily give rise to a devil fetus.

This so-called devil fetus was an existence that came into the world filled with hatred and resentment. They hated everything in the world, including their own parents. If a devil fetus did appear, they had to be killed instantly, or they would bring forth a calamity.

“Of course it’s true. That’s why if we have children, it might give rise to a devil fetus. Your cherished children will be killed for that, destroying your greatest hope,” said Long Chen.

To the demonic beast race, the first mixed-blood child was the most important. They would inherit the most divine abilities and would have the highest chance of inheriting the strong points of the father and mother.

With this, Lei Yuner’s expression improved. “You aren’t tricking me?”

“Look into my eyes.” Long Chen looked into Lei Yuner’s eyes.

Lei Yuner then stared back and her soul was drawn in. She instantly felt a power that made her soul shake.

“You… you really do have a heart-devil.” Lei Yuner was shocked. Her eyes could clearly sense that terrifying destructive power within his soul. That was his dark energy, and it was completely different from his current aura.

Let alone someone like Lei Yuner with her special abilities, even an ordinary person could have easily recognized it.

“Why don’t you ask some expert of your human race to help you with it?” asked Lei Yuner in confusion.

“Others cannot help me. The only one capable of suppressing this heart-devil is myself. So for now, I can’t have children. But we can be friends. Other than having children, we can work together on other areas,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Lei Yuner was silent for a moment. “That’s fine too. Once you get rid of your heart-devil, we can try again to have children. I’ll wait for you. But while I can put aside the matter of having children for now, you can’t have any with other races either! I will not become a laughingstock for those other races.”

Long Chen smiled. “No problem.”

Hearing that response, Lei Yuner smiled as well. Her low spirits were wiped away.

Long Chen sighed with relief inside. While the demonic beast race was more savage, their characters were also delightfully straightforward.

“Let’s go. We’ll stroll through the Sacred Pill Hall’s marketplace and see if there’s anything good. I can find a betrothal gift for you there.” Lei Yuner pulled Long Chen’s hand.

Betrothal gift? Long Chen rolled his eyes. Did she really view him as a wife? Just how would he live in this world now? If Mo Nian were to learn of this, Long Chen would never be able to raise his head in this lifetime again.

Lei Yuner was only as tall as Long Chen’s shoulder. She skipped and bounced as she held his hand, just like a child. Perhaps according to the human race’s standards, her mind might be on the level of a ten-year-old child. But such a little girl was thinking about children all day and night, leaving him speechless.

As Lei Yuner chatted with him, he learned that the demonic beast race viewed their inheritances as of the utmost importance. That seemed to be the most important thing in their minds, their life’s greatest mission.

The demonic beasts had also gone through countless tribulations. Those whose inheritances had been passed down relied on their powerful reproductive ability. That was why reproduction was so important to them.

Long Chen sighed emotionally inside. In this world, every single race had their own methods of survival. The demonic beast race was like this, and the same was true of the Netherworld’s Underworld and Nether races. They all relied on quantity to win.

Even the Nethergod race had their own way to survive. When Ming Cangyue was born, she was just a mass of primal chaos. She was then raised by other Nethergods.

At that time, she only controlled a low level plane. The Nethergod race needed to stick together. Ming Cangyue technically did have parents and a family, but that wasn’t based on bloodline. It was based on controlling the laws in close regions, the goal only being to avoid being devoured by other powers.

Later on, that family was attacked by Nethergods from other regions, almost wiping them out. Anxious to advance, Ming Cangyue separated her good from herself, resulting in Leng Yueyan being born. After that, Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan joined forces and got revenge on those that had attacked their family, unifying that region under their command.

In any case, every single race had their own abilities to survive which allowed them to continue to this day.

In comparison, the human race was definitely lacking. Their reproductive strength and physical bodies were inferior, and so were their lifespans. But they still stood at the peak of the nine heavens and ten lands.

No wonder it was said that the human race was blessed by the Heavenly Daos, and other races always transformed into human form to cultivate. To have reached their current position without any other advantages, it could only be said that it was thanks to the favor of heaven and earth.

Long Chen also learned quite a bit about the demonic beast races from Lei Yuner. She really didn’t have any scheming desire inside her. Whatever he asked, she would answer.

They quickly arrived at a building that looked like an imperial palace. It was like a skyscraper, a glorious display of extravagance. Seeing it, Lei Yuner instantly became excited.

“This is the Auspicious Cloud Trading Company, the largest business in the entire Integral Heaven Star-Field. They have countless treasures. Let’s take a look.”

She immediately dragged Long Chen. Looking at the large gates, Long Chen sucked in a cold gasp of air.

“Damn!”
