Chapter 4209 The Weak Should Die?

“Kill them!”

“If they don’t die, the martial stage won’t open!”

“That’s right, they should have died in the first place! This is all the will of the heavens. The weak are not qualified to live.”

“Everything about the Sage King martial stage was already perfectly calculated. But you, Long Chen, were so meddlesome that you broke the rules of the martial stage, making it impossible to activate it. You owe all of us a debt!”

Numerous experts, bearing grudges against Long Chen or the High Firmament Academy, shouted in his direction. After all, upon his arrival at the High Firmament Academy’s ruins, he had kicked out many insolent people. Remembering this grudge, they now took this chance to counterattack.

“You… you’re… spouting nonsense!”

A trembling cry rang out from behind Long Chen. They were all horrified to find that the ones who wanted them dead weren't the cruel devil race or the violent demonic beast race, but members of their own race.

They clenched their teeth, knowing that there was no way to seek assistance from their own factions. They had no means to establish communication with the outside world, and besides, those on the outside were powerless to intervene.

“Long Chen, you get one chance to kill those useless people to make up for what you’ve done! Perhaps we’ll spare your life then!” Xu Yifeng’s voice rose from the crowd.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The disciples standing behind Long Chen took a step back, bracing themselves for what might come next. Their eyes were fixed on Long Chen, as were the gazes of those from the other races. They could see that Long Chen’s gaze was icy with killing intent.

“A pack of fools, I’m not going to argue with you. What I have decided on, not even the heavens can change. Since I’ve helped them, I will carry all consequences for my actions. If anyone doesn’t like it, come at me. In truth, the essence blood of weaklings isn’t very useful. I feel like using the blood of the strong to activate this formation will have an even better effect.” Long Chen's cold response was aimed directly at Xu Yifeng. Long Chen was well aware of Xu Yifeng's sinister intentions, as the latter not only sought to spark conflict within the human race but also to make Long Chen a primary target.

In his fury, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to argue anymore. With his killing intent on the verge of going out of control, he didn’t want to explain himself. He knew that before talking reason, absolute power was required.

“Hahaha, what arrogance! You think that you can fight the entire human race by yourself? No, you will be fighting all lifeforms within the nine heavens and ten lands!” declared Xu Yifeng.

“What a loathsome fellow. He’s intentionally fanning the flames. Boss, let me kill him.” Even the ever-calm Yue Zifeng lost his patience.

All of them could see that Xu Yifeng was a sinister person. Once the other races came, did he really think that they would only target Long Chen? All humans would be their target.

What was most infuriating was the fact that numerous individuals were blindly supporting Xu Yifeng, oblivious to the fact that their actions were jeopardizing the entire human race.

Outside the martial stage, the human experts were frantic. They already had bad relationships with other races. If they were to face all their wrath together, the human race would take hideous losses. They might even be completely wiped out.

However, there was nothing they could do. They could only see what was going on, and their voices were unable to reach the inside of the barrier.

“There seems to be a problem with the Xu family.”

Bai Shishi’s mother watched from the plaza. Seeing Xu Yifeng trying so hard to cause trouble, she felt that this matter wasn’t so simple.

“It’s not just him. Many others are doing the same thing as them secretly,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother.

“Long Chen, are you even a man? Kill him!” Bai Zhantang felt like he might explode from rage. He knew that his voice couldn’t reach Long Chen, but he still felt the need to vent.

“Xu family, is your family’s brat an idiot?! Is he trying to get all the human race’s disciples killed?!”

Someone finally cursed the Violet Blood race’s Xu family. The speaker was an innate Heaven Venerate. His grandson was inside the formation and being protected by Long Chen, so he was naturally worried about him. This grandson of his was the only remnant of his bloodline.

The Violet Blood race’s Xu family didn’t have their own palace, standing in some abandoned empty land that they had claimed for themselves.

Countless curses rained down on them. However, their people were icily arrogant and ignored all the curses. But finally, one of them shouted back, “Are you blind? Long Chen has broken the rules of the Sage King Convention, and now the martial stage can’t be activated. Without it, how will my Violet Blood race’s heavenly genius obtain the title of Sage King? The path of cultivation is one where the weak are devoured by the strong. This is an iron law of the cultivation world. Who is Long Chen to act like some saint? You ants can only spray your saliva. If you don’t like it, go ahead and try to fight my Violet Blood race.” His shout echoed like rolling thunder, shaking people’s ears with its overwhelming and tyrannical arrogance.

“You… you’re going too far!” raged another expert. But they were powerless to do anything to the Xu family.

After all, the latter was too powerful. They had hundreds of innate Heaven Venerates on their side and tens of thousands of ordinary Heaven Venerates. Furthermore, even their ordinary Heaven Venerates had auras on par with regular innate Heaven Venerates.

This was to be expected as the Violet Blood race was one of the strongest bloodlines in the primal chaos era. Even the declined version of them wasn’t something that normal experts could contend with.

However, their tone still infuriated countless people. According to the Xu family's perspective, it wasn't just their disciples who should perish; even they, the leaders, should meet the same fate, for the weak did not deserve to survive.

“Palace master, you’re overseeing the High Firmament Academy. As a representative of the human race, could you oversee justice for this?”

Evidently, news of the palace master's ability to intimidate the head of the Xu family with just a glance had circulated widely, so someone shouted toward the High Firmament Academy’s side.

It was clear that the Xu family was afraid of this mysterious palace master. Thus, at this moment, with the Xu family acting arrogant, someone sincerely asked for aid from the palace master.

When everyone’s gazes fell on him, the palace master smiled and then said something that left everyone gobsmacked.

“The weak truly aren’t qualified to be arrogant.”

The palace master’s words were like a bucket of ice water over them, turning countless people’s hearts cold. What was going on? Was the palace master also afraid of the Xu family? He didn’t dare to fight them?

However, the palace master then turned to the Xu family’s people. He smiled widely, revealing his white teeth.

“That’s why, in a bit, when your Xu family’s disciples are slain, don’t come crying to me. Otherwise, I’ll wring your heads off one by one.”
