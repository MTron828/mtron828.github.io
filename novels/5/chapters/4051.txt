Chapter 4040 Retribution Comes

BOOM!

A powerful explosion shook the world, exuding streaks of golden divine radiance and white faith energy that tore through the world.

As a result, countless fragments of the Grand Dao spun through the air, and the void was riddled with holes. Within that devastation, Long Chen’s body was covered in cracks as he hacked up blood.

However, Dongfang Zichu was no better off. His sword was crushed by the impact, and its fragments turned him into a sieve.

Dongfang Zichu was heavily injured at this moment. However, his gaze was still as sharp as a sword.

“I thought that I had given you a high estimation, but I didn’t expect you to be able to injure me. Even so, it won’t change your fate.”

Dongfang Zichu formed hand seals, and the Yan Xu Gate quivered. Two currents of divine light then flowed into Dongfang Zichu.

“The power of Yan Xu destroys all creation! Let’s see what you can use to block this!” The Yan Xu Gate behind Dongfang Zichu actually heard his summons and lent him power.

Dongfang Zichu’s milky white faith energy vanished as he was surrounded by black flames, looking like a devil king from hell. He then shot at Long Chen.

Long Chen had been blown back in that last exchange. On the surface, it appeared as if they were both severely injured. But in truth, the one to suffer was Dongfang Zichu.

Long Chen’s wounds had only been superficial, and a single breath later, his wounds already healed. With the life energy of the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees, Long Chen was not afraid of being injured, even if his opponent used faith energy.

However, Dongfang Zichu was truly crafty. With his backup plan, he used the power of the Yan Xu Gate to fight Long Chen.

“Yan Xu energy? Is that so amazing? In front of absolute power, it’s just a joke.” Long Chen snorted and surprisingly put away the Minghong Saber.

In the distance, Lei Linger displayed her prowess, swiftly slaughtering the opposing immemorial beasts. In the blink of an eye, she appeared on top of Long Chen's hand, as if effortlessly teleporting.

Then, a magnificent flame dragon manifested on one of Long Chen's hands, while a majestic lightning dragon appeared on the other. As the two dragons elegantly coiled around his hands, the very heavens seemed to shift and transform. An ominous, apocalyptic aura then radiated from his palms, signaling the immense power he now possessed.

“What?!”

Dongfang Zichu had not expected Long Chen to possess another trump card, one even stronger than the last one. His expression changed, but he couldn’t stop his momentum anymore. So, he could only risk it all.

“Don’t hold back! Kill him! Double Dragon Destruction!” Long Chen roared, sending his full Spiritual Strength into Huo Linger and Lei Linger.

At this moment, the two dragons were no longer their old selves. Their power had grown by over ten times, so unleashing the full Double Dragon Destruction now exhausted a terrifying amount of Spiritual Strength.

However, Long Chen didn’t mind. He wanted Dongfang Zichu dead and would pay any price to make sure that bastard stayed dead.

“The Yan Xu Flame is the strongest flame of the nine heavens and ten lands! The person to die will be you!”

Dongfang Zichu roared, pouring all of his power into his fist. Without any path of retreat anymore, as retreat signified definite death, he could only gamble it all.

In front of countless horrified gazes, the two dragons coiling around Long Chen’s hand shot out like a sharp nail toward a fist covered in flames.

BOOM!

As multicolored divine radiance illuminated the world and a giant mushroom cloud covered the dome of the sky, people lost their vision, their scent, their taste, their hearing, and their sense of touch. Even three-flower Earth Venerates felt their heads turn white. It was like time was standing still, yet also like thousands of years were passing by in the blink of an eye.

The scene before them seemed to stretch into eternity, akin to being lost in the depths of primal chaos. Time itself appeared to stand still, leaving them uncertain of how long they had been trapped in this surreal state. Yet, eventually, their vision shifted, and time began to flow once more. The chaotic landscape gave way to the familiar sight of the battlefield

Long Chen was covered in blood and still in his attacking posture. As for the Dongfang Zichu in front of him, he was gone, turned into a bloody mist, but his aura still hung in the air.

Suddenly, Long Chen moved, shooting out in a certain direction. Looking in that direction, people saw a translucent figure.

“It’s Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit!”

Dongfang Zichu’s body was destroyed, but he had managed to preserve his Yuan Spirit. It was just that his Yuan Spirit was incredibly weak, seeming like it might dissipate at any moment.

“Long Chen, you destroyed my physical body and the foundation of my faith! I swear that you will pay the price!” howled Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit hatefully.

Long Chen unleashed a punch, but unexpectedly, his fist simply passed through Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit.

Long Chen suddenly raised his head. Upon seeing the figure behind Dongfang Zichu, killing intent exploded out of him.

“Lord Brahma!”

At some unknown point, an illusory image had appeared behind Dongfang Zichu. It was as light as mist and too vague to see who it was. However, Long Chen instantly recognized him. At that moment, he instantly understood why Enpuda would join forces with Dongfang Zichu. They were all Lord Brahma’s subordinates.

“With the protection of Lord Brahma’s faith energy, I have an undying body! No one can kill me! Did you think that you could kill me just because you could kill Liao Bencang? Keep dreaming! It was only because Liao Bencang-” Dongfang Zichu suddenly shut his mouth and changed the subject. “Long Chen, I’ll patiently enjoy watching you suffer as Qingxuan is killed, hahaha!”

Dongfang Zichu laughed crazily. That laughter was filled with so much rancor that it made people’s hair stand on end.

Long Chen repeatedly attacked, but they all passed through Dongfang Zichu’s spirit. It was like he was just a projection.

“Fool! Idiot! Release me! I’ll kill him!”

Just then, within Long Chen’s mind-sea, his heart-devil’s roar rang out. His heart-devil was actually capable of speaking to him.

“Can Lord Brahma guarantee your protection? Not necessarily!”

Just then, a clear, icy voice rang out. It wasn’t loud, but it still entered every single person’s ears crystal-clear over the ruckus of the battlefield.

An icy streak of light then flew through the air, seemingly slicing through the world itself. The severance point was precisely the space between Dongfang Zichu and Lord Brahma’s figure.

Seeing that, Long Chen didn’t bother asking who that was. Turning his fist into a claw, he hacked down on Dongfang Zichu.

The void was torn apart. Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit was now in Long Chen’s hand.

“Dongfang Zichu, your retribution has come.”

Long Chen’s gaze was frightening. A lightning needle appeared in his hand, and he stabbed it into Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit.
