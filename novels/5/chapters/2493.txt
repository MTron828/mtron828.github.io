Chapter 2483 An Arrow at the End of its Flight

Zhao Ritian’s body was no longer flowing with golden blood but a rainbow-colored fluid. It condensed below his Dantian. There was a root image there that formed a strange cycle.

“This is the merger of Spirit Blood and Spirit Root?”

“The Spirit Root is the root of life. It determines a person’s talent and divine abilities. How can it be merged with the Spirit Blood?”

The Spirit Root was a ball of Root Qi located below the Dantian. It was the innate foundation of a cultivator, something that was formed and activated while they were still in the womb. It was the talent that awakened the earliest.

It was like a seed that would start germinating immediately. It decided what kind of plant would grow from it.

A towering tree had to have an appropriate seed. A bean sprout couldn’t be trained into a tree that could reach the heavens. When large sects were recruiting, the main thing that they looked at was the Spirit Root.

However, those who were able to become Empyreans had to have at least violet gold grade Spirit Roots. By that level, the Spirit Root had reached a limit, so people were competing in Spirit Blood.

The Spirit Root was the Spirit Root, and the Spirit Blood was the Spirit Blood. There was little in common between them.

Now that Zhao Ritian was using his Spirit Blood to activate his Spirit Root and unleash unprecedented power, everyone was dumbfounded. This toppled their understanding of cultivation.

“We can’t do this, but that doesn’t mean that he can’t. Zhao Ritian came with Feng Fei, and he doesn’t talk to her courteously. They’re clearly experts on the same level, so he is also a Sovereign Sprout. I have heard that all Sovereign Sprouts have a Spirit Bone. It was one of the requirements to become a Sovereign. As for us, we have no Spirit Bone, so we can’t judge them according to our standards,” sighed one person.

Looking at Zhao Ritian in the sky, they felt a sense of profound despair. To be born in the same generation as such a figure was a kind of sorrow. There was no hope as they could only be suppressed.

A Sovereign sprout, a sprout that could grow into a Sovereign. There was a difference right from the start between them. Whatever they did, they couldn’t make up for that gap.

The void flickered as if the world was breathing along with Zhao Ritian. He no longer needed his manifestation. In this state, he was the automatic ruler of the world.

“Die!”

Zhao Ritian and Long Chen attacked at the same time. One blazed with multicolored divine light, while the other had a blood dragon coiling around him. They were like two shooting stars smashing into each other.

The two of them began to exchange a wild howling torrent of blows. Every time their fists or feet met, it would cause the world to shake.

“Even if I don’t obtain anything, just being able to witness this battle makes it worth it.” Someone clenched their fists. He had previously been dispirited because he had wished to compete with experts on this level.

However, upon seeing the difference and accepting his position as a spectator, he felt a kind of delight. Two peak powers were colliding, two unbeatable wills were clashing. He was bearing witness to a battle of peak experts. This alone was beneficial to him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, with one final explosion, it was like a star had exploded. A rain of divine light fell from the sky, and the two of them retreated at the same time. They stared at each other.

Long Chen had an azure dragon coiling around him like a protector. It made him appear even more attractive.

The main thing though was that he was facing a twisted Zhao Ritian who had transformed into a monster. That naturally made Long Chen look better in comparison.

“Long Chen is starting to pant. He has reached his limit. If this continues, his power will start to flag.”

“That’s normal. After all, he’s human and not even an Empyrean.”

It was unbelievable that he was only starting to reach his limit after such a long battle on this level. After all, a person’s power couldn’t be limitless.

“You’re out of energy, huh? Long Chen, you’re definitely dead.” Zhao Ritian glared at Long Chen, his eyes violet-red. They were like the eyes of a beast, sinister and fierce. Even his voice seemed like a growl.

He hated Long Chen. He hated Long Chen for forcing him into this state. He hated Long Chen for making him lose some of his source essence. Even if he killed Long Chen, it would take him a long time to recover from this.

Long Chen smiled and lightly said, “My dragon blood is starting to reach its limit. But what about you?

“Idiot, my Spirit Blood and Spirit Root have merged, not just giving a boost to my power, but also creating a cycle that automatically absorbs the world’s energy for myself. What are you supposed to use to compete with me?” sneered Zhao Ritian, once more shooting at Long Chen.

They began a crazy exchange once more. Zhao Ritian’s speech stunned people. If that really was the case, then wasn’t Long Chen’s defeat set in stone?

Zhao Ritian didn’t even need his manifestation. His manifestation’s power was locked within him, allowing him to enter this merged state. Or perhaps this should be considered a kind of manifestation that was impossible for the spectators to comprehend.

Zhao Ritian was constantly absorbing the power of the Heavenly Daos to support himself, making up for the energy he was using, while Long Chen’s dragon blood energy was being exhausted bit by bit.

“In comparison, Long Chen is stronger,” said someone suddenly.

Others nodded, even those who were enemies with Long Chen. When they had to compare, Long Chen was the real terrifying one. If he was an Empyrean with the approval of the heavens, he wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage.

“You’re the idiot. Even if you are absorbing the energy of heaven and earth, so what? Your output is far greater. There’s no way it’s balanced. It’s like repeatedly throwing a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood. Who are you trying to dupe? I’ll tear off your mask today.” Long Chen’s sneer rang out as he continued to fight. Zhao Ritian’s body was now so tough that he couldn’t break it, but his Azure Dragon Battle Armor was just as tough. Every time they exchanged blows, there was a metallic ringing, and sparks flew like fireworks.

Neither of them ceded an inch. Everyone could see that Long Chen was the main attacker. Zhao Ritian was only able to occasionally counterattack.

There were many times that Long Chen had managed to strike parts of Zhao Ritian’s body that would have been fatal in an ordinary person, but Zhao Ritian’s body was too tough.

When it came to skill in fighting barehanded, Zhao Ritian wasn’t on the same level as Long Chen. It was simply that his body had no weak points.

Long Chen had tried hitting Zhao Ritian everywhere, but he had not found any weaknesses. He hadn’t even managed to injure him.

After that, Long Chen landed a kick on Zhao Ritian’s abdomen and then smashed his elbow into Zhao Ritian’s nose, making him flip back.

However, this exchange in particular caused everyone to let out a startled cry. This time, Zhao Ritian’s nose had cracked.

“Long Chen’s right! Zhao Ritian has also reached his limit!” People were shocked at Long Chen’s sharp vision. It was the first time that Zhao Ritian was damaged since he had entered this state.

“Hmph, you’ve reached your limit, right? Let’s see how you will continue acting arrogant.” Long Chen continued to attack, once more landing a punch on Zhao Ritian’s face. The cracks on his nose had just healed, so Zhao Ritian hastily raised his arms to block.

However, Long Chen’s punch was a feint. He grabbed Zhao Ritian’s arms and smashed his right knee into his face.

This attack was solidly received. Zhao Ritian flew back, even more cracks spreading throughout his head as if it might explode.

“Zhao Ritian’s in danger!” Although that was what someone said, they all saw that Long Chen was sweating and panting. He had to have reached his limit as well.

Everyone tensed up. This world-shaking battle might be reaching its end. The victor and loser would quickly be revealed.

“Even if I have reached my limit, killing you isn’t a problem!” roared Zhao Ritian.

BOOM!

The distraction of shouting resulted in Long Chen landing a kick on his Dantian. The place where his Spirit Root had manifested rumbled. Zhao Ritian was sent flying.

However, just at that moment, the scales on Long Chen’s foot split apart. Blood dripped down.

“I’ve used up too much of the dragon blood’s power. I can’t maintain the Azure Dragon Battle Armor much longer.” Long Chen’s heart shook. His defensive power had just dropped. Without it, fighting with a body of flesh against a body of metal should be difficult.

“Hahaha, I was waiting for this moment! You’re just a normal person! Even if you have dragon blood, you’re just borrowing its power. Without it, you’re still trash! Die!” Zhao Ritian laughed, taking the initiative to strike.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
