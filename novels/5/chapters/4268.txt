Chapter 4257 A Sword That Breaks the Heavens

Long Chen had no chance to examine that other world. However, he had seen endless devil creatures inside. If that gate fully opened, the human race in this region would probably be annihilated.

Mo Nian was correct – this was a complex trap, an absolutely enormous and cunning one. Everyone here was being manipulated and ensnared within its web.

After all, the karmic luck bead had blinded people’s eyes. It was the bait, as well as the key to opening the gate.

The gate was slowly opening, powered by the karmic luck bead. Furthermore, the karmic luck bead’s power stemmed from the blood soul energy in this place.

Amidst this chaotic battle, countless lifeforms were dying, accelerating the opening of the gate. Thus, Long Chen could not wait any longer. He had to destroy the karmic luck bead immediately.

Wielding the Earth Cauldron, Long Chen charged toward the karmic luck bead, streaking through the air, unstoppable. Countless lifeforms in the midst of slaughtering each other were blasted away by the astral winds around him, and he smashed the Earth Cauldron at the karmic luck bead.

The karmic luck bead quivered, exuding a burst of divine light that shocked everyone. Their attention shifted to the bronze cauldron, and many people recognized it.

“Didn’t he sell that cauldron? How does he still have it?”

BOOM!

Just as everyone was bewildered by the bronze cauldron, the karmic luck bead bounced Long Chen back along with his cauldron.

“What?!” Long Chen’s expression completely changed. This was the Earth Cauldron! How could it not shatter the karmic luck bead? His mind turned blank.

“Hahaha, fool, do you think a counterfeit is the real thing? Do you take that broken cauldron of yours to be the true Heaven Earth Cauldron?” sneered some people upon seeing his dumbfounded shock.

Suddenly, a black streak pierced through the air, striking the karmic luck bead. The karmic luck bead once more caved in, and then a delicate figure was also sent flying.

Dong Mingyu had also tried to attack with the black dagger, but it was useless, causing her to be filled with disbelief. This mysterious dagger had yet to fail her. She had never encountered anything capable of blocking its attack.

“Senior, what’s going on? Even the Heaven Earth Cauldron can’t break it?!” cried out Long Chen in a panic.

“The Earth Cauldron is known for its gentle nature, and the karmic luck bead is also a flexible entity. Soft against soft? It lacks the strength to shatter the bead. That black dagger is capable of breaking it, but with your current power, it is impossible. Your offensive power is not concentrated enough,” said the dragon expert.

“Not concentrated enough?” Long Chen’s heart shook.

BOOM!

At this moment, a wind blade slashed onto the karmic luck bead. Tang Wan-er refused to believe that it was impervious, but she was also unable to damage it.

Long Chen found that as they attacked the karmic luck bead, the likes of Long Aotian, Lian Wuying, Ye Wuchen, Zhao Xingtian, the Shadow princess, the Ghost Dao lifeform, and the others were not stopping him. Instead, they were just watching disdainfully.

The runes around the karmic luck bead had been all absorbed, and the core of the karmic luck bead could not be touched by anyone. Since that was the case, countless experts turned their attention to the Dragonblood Legion, wanting the runes that they had just absorbed.

“Zifeng!”

Long Chen suddenly shouted.

“Leave it to me.”

Yue Zifeng’s figure appeared in the air. He looked at the giant karmic luck bead, and his hand slowly reached back for the hilt of his sword.

“What is he doing?!”

“He can’t possibly…!?!”

“Are they crazy?!”

This scene stunned the onlookers outside of the martial stage, but then contemptuous expressions appeared on their faces.

“Xia Chen.” Long Chen only needed to glance at Xia Chen, and he instantly understood. Clenching his teeth, he stealthily took out a whole pile of formation discs.

Yue Zifeng stood atop the karmic luck bead. In front of this enormous sphere, Yue Zifeng was as small as an ant.

Yue Zifeng’s white robes began to flutter, despite the absence of any wind. Two sharp sword images appeared in his eyes.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

To everyone’s surprise, strange sounds rang out around Yue Zifeng, and black threads materialized in the air, swaying around him. Upon closer inspection, the expressions of the onlookers completely changed.

“Those are… spatial cracks…!”

Yue Zifeng had not even unleashed any manifestation or mighty aura, but many spatial cracks already appeared around him. Furthermore, those cracks were not straight, akin to threads flying around him.

One, two… a hundred… a thousand… ten thousand…

Countless black threads flew through the air, allowing the Supreme experts to see the world inside those cracks.

These spatial cracks emitted no sound whatsoever, plunging the world into absolute silence.

Mu Qingyun watched worshipfully, using her heart to memorize every single one of Yue Zifeng’s movements.

Everyone in the Dragonblood Legion held their breaths. Only Long Aotian, Lian Wuying, and the others had contemptuous expressions, clearly knowing that this karmic luck bead was unbreakable. At the very least, no one in the Sage King Prefecture was capable of such a thing.

Yue Zifeng’s voice was icy and aloof, like the murmuring of the Sword God, like the edict of heaven and earth echoing throughout the nine heavens.

“Nine heavens. Ten lands. Three Dao worlds. There is nothing that I cannot cut.”

Yue Zifeng unsheathed his sword, and this time, he wasn’t fast. His movements were clearly visible to everyone.

As Yue Zifeng’s sword slashed down, ripples cascaded in heaven and earth. Everyone witnessed a crescent-moon-like streak of Sword Qi slashing through the wall of the heavens. In that moment, the ten thousand Daos, the laws governing the world, were all instantly erased. All runes of the Grand Dao vanished, leaving only a sword that shocked heaven and earth, a sword that made both ghosts and gods weep. It carried a certain will, a certain determination that proclaimed nothing could stop it.

Even as the sword cut through the air, an eerie silence prevailed, devoid of any audible friction. Time seemed to slow down, and everyone saw with utmost clarity as the crescent moon slashed the karmic luck bead.

BOOM!

As the silence was gone, in front of countless shocked gazes, the karmic luck bead that Long Chen and Dong Mingyu hadn’t been able to harm exploded.

The next moment, countless runes flew through the air, like a Grand Dao flower blooming. However, the eruption looked somewhat slow.

Along with the explosion of the karmic luck bead, space twisted around the core region, and a group of people appeared. They were the experts from Long Chen’s faction, and they had returned once more.

Without delay, they swiftly devoured the karmic luck runes that emanated from the explosion of the karmic luck bead.

Seeing this scene, the onlookers finally recovered from their shock. As for Long Aotian, Lian Wuying, and the others, they were both shocked and incensed. They couldn’t believe that the indestructible karmic luck bead would be destroyed by one slash of a sword.

“Quick… take… them…”

A furious roar rang out, but following that, a shocking scene appeared.
