Chapter 4236: Legacy of the Sovereigns

“What do you know?” asked Long Chen solemnly.

It was no wonder he was feeling like some calamity was about to descend. Moreover, that intense feeling of unease didn’t come from the surroundings but toward the distant future.

“I’m not sure about the exact details. However, when I surveyed the terrain of the Sage King Prefecture, I found that there was a problem. Based on just the fengshui, this is a treasure land with the very essence of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven gathering here. Furthermore, it grows and cycles endlessly. According to reason, this is a land of life. However, it seems that someone did something to this cycle, adding traces of death qi from deep underground. Even so, the source was too deep for me to get an accurate sense of it, and it’s not like I have the time to investigate. I thought that a few traces of death qi shouldn’t be enough to affect this place, so I didn’t even pay much attention to it. But once I entered the martial stage, I understood. The traces of death qi are nothing more than a vector. They have no power themselves, but they are gathering the blood soul energy of all the experts dying on the martial stage. Once the blood soul energy of the lifeforms of the nine heavens merges with the aura of the dark creatures, it will produce an unprecedented power. As for the karmic luck bead, it is very likely the crux for detonating this power,” said Mo Nian.

“Detonating this power? What do you mean? Is this to wipe out all the lifeforms in the Sage King Prefecture?” Long Chen gasped. Was this a trap to wipe out all the elites of the nine heavens in one go?

Mo Nian shook his head. “It’s not so simple. Once this power detonates, it will be pointed at a spatial gate.”

“A spatial gate?”

“Yes, a spatial gate. But this spatial gate is too far, and the wall of the heavens is in the way. All I know is that there is a spatial gate in that direction, but I didn’t have time to investigate any further. That’s why I said that the Sage King martial stage is actually the small trap. The real goal of the one who set up this trap should be that spatial gate,” said Mo Nian.

Long Chen was shaken. Just who could possibly make such a big play? They could actually take control over the Sage King martial stage? That was a heaven-defying power.

With Long Chen’s understanding of Mo Nian’s character, he knew that this fellow never spoke the truth when it came to small matters but never lied when it came to major matters. He definitely wouldn’t spout such a thing unless he was sure.

Mo Nian continued, “I don’t know who the person controlling everything behind the scenes is, or what their goal is, or what lies behind that spatial gate. However, considering that they are willing to sacrifice the lives of so many lifeforms for their plan, they can’t be a good person. If that spatial gate opens, the nine heavens will definitely be thrown into chaos. Chaos is one thing, but the main thing is that the person behind the scenes might have an even more terrifying plan later on, and we are all just their pawns. That is why we should think of a way to ruin their plans.”

To use the lives of all the lifeforms here to open a gate? The mastermind was truly brazen. Were they not afraid of drawing the wrath of all these races? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Tell me, do you think there are people who know about this matter on the martial stage?” asked Long Chen suspiciously.

Mo Nian immediately gave him a thumbs-up. “Not bad. You can think of this.”

Long Chen had only thought of it because of people who had repeatedly tried to cause trouble and stir up fights between factions.

“There definitely are some people who know, but none of us can say who they are. They also won’t foolishly step forward and reveal themselves to us. For them to risk their lives to enter this trap means that there must be some benefits to fight over, and those benefits must be immense enough to take such a risk. We should keep a close eye on everyone. Once the good stuff appears, we’ll take it. We won’t let them take advantage of us. As for that idiot from the Violet Blood race’s Xu family, I guarantee that he doesn’t know about it. If he did, he wouldn’t have fought you so early,” said Mo Nian.

“How do you know about him?” asked Long Chen in surprise.

“I already did some stealthy soulsearches, so I know everything that happened on your side. You should pay attention to the eight Eternal clans. They definitely know, or they wouldn’t be just standing around without making a move. As for the Grand Yan’s imperial line, it’s hard to say. They’re incredibly arrogant. They might act the same way whether they know about it or not,” said Mo Nian.

Long Chen nodded. Just as Mo Nian said, the eight Eternal clans had been acting very low-key during this time. Other than Long Aotian saying a few words, not one of them had done anything.

Even Feng Fei was in hiding. After arriving on the martial stage, Long Chen couldn’t find her. It was very abnormal.

Moreover, it wasn’t just the eight Eternal clans. Many terrifying experts were hiding themselves as well. The current martial stage was like a slumbering volcano that could erupt at any moment. When the eruption occurred, all kinds of enemies would appear, akin to unleashed monsters.

“Is the greatest benefit here the karmic luck bead?” whispered Long Chen.

“Most likely. The karmic luck bead is related to the karmic luck of the nine heavens. According to reason, it can’t be under someone’s control. Although someone was able to take control over the martial stage and borrow the power of the karmic luck bead, after they’re done using it, the karmic luck bead will remain, and everyone will fight for it. I just don’t know what kind of changes the karmic luck bead will undergo when the time comes. We can only keep a close eye on it,” said Mo Nian.

As they spoke, more and more dark creatures appeared, and the various races were forced to fight with their full power. After all, a chaotic battlefield could kill even experienced masters. Other than peak experts, anyone surrounded by these powerful dark creatures would definitely die.

“Brothers!”

At this time, Guo Ran and the others arrived, finally reuniting with everyone. Seeing them, the Dragonblood warriors were all overjoyed. They went from over two thousand people to over five thousand people.

Feeling overwhelmed, they thought back to how they were forced to separate back in the destructive battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, not knowing whether they would ever meet again.

Coming along with Guo Ran and the others were those weaklings from the staircase and the brave experts who had come to support Long Chen when he was in trouble. Actually, they were a rather large group on the martial stage. However, only thirty percent of them could be considered true experts, so coming here had taken quite a bit of time.

“You still like to be so meddlesome.” Mo Nian eyed the frightened cultivators amongst their ranks and shook his head.

Bringing along these weaklings would affect their overall efficiency and drag them down.

“This isn’t being meddlesome. This is a kind of legacy,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“What legacy?” asked Mo Nian in confusion.

Long Chen solemnly said, “The legacy of the Sovereigns. The five Sovereigns passed this mantle down to me. They said the strong must carry heavier burdens. Big Brother Yun Shang, Big Brother Qing Xu, Big Brother Mo Li, Big Sister Han Xue, and Big Brother Zi Yang. Which one of them wasn’t a stunning hero? If they weren’t so ‘meddlesome’, they’d have long since ascended to the immortal world and soared through the nine heavens. Even after all this time in the immortal world, fighting countless battles and seeing billions of so-called heavenly geniuses, I have not encountered anyone who can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them. If they weren’t so ‘meddlesome’, the Martial Heaven Continent would have long since been destroyed. Then where would we be?”

When Long Chen brought up the five Sovereigns, Mo Nian immediately grew respectful. He nodded. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have-”

BOOM!

Just as Mo Nian was about to apologize for his words, a deafening explosion resounded, eliciting a chorus of startled cries. The crystal coffin trapping Yan Wuji was forced open.
