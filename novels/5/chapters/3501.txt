Chapter 3490

“Eat then.”

Long Chen really released him.

That World King then used some secret art as soon as Long Chen let go, vanishing and reappearing beside the other World Kings.

“Idiot, you’re the one who’s going to eat shit! Your head is full of shit!”

After escaping, that World King instantly changed his tone, cursing Long Chen to win back the face that he had just lost.

“I gave you a chance to live, but you didn’t cherish it.” Long Chen snorted.

Just then, a violet ring made out of lightning appeared around the World King’s neck. At this moment, its power erupted.

“No-!” That World King only had a chance to scream a single word.

When the lightning ring exploded, everything from his neck up was turned into smithereens. His Yuan Spirit also crumbled. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Huayun Trading Company, how brazen! Are you declaring war on my Soaring Dragon Company?!” shouted the dark-faced elder furiously.

“You are the one called Yu Shu? I already said that I’m not from the Huayun Trading Company, but you keep trying to label me as such. Well, it’s fine. If you want to label me that, go ahead. Now, I’m not just going to take back what’s mine, but I’m also going to slaughter a few people as retribution for the millions of innocent lives that you ended.”

Long Chen extended his hand and a flame lotus appeared.

This attack wasn’t aimed at anyone. Instead, it smashed into the ground. Before this attack, the earth was already cracked, but there were still some buildings standing on it.

BOOM!

However, after the attack landed, flames exploded, ravaging this area. As the Soaring Dragon Company’s buildings were already tottering and had lost the protection of their formations, they were instantly turned into scorched earth.

Startled cries then rang out from the people in the distance. This black-robed youngster really was intent on completely destroying this stronghold of the Soaring Dragon Company. Just what kind of enmity did they have?

Beneath the ground was the Soaring Dragon Company’s karmic luck dragon meridian. Without the protection of the formations, that karmic luck would be released. But as long as the dragon meridian was repaired, this karmic luck would be replenished. Although there would be some loss, it was still possible to recover.

However, the destructive aura of the World Extermination Flame Lotus instantly ignited this karmic luck. This was an irrecoverable loss to the Soaring Dragon Company. Only someone with an undying enmity that would not rest until the other side was wiped out would do something so severe.

The Soaring Dragon Company was an enormous existence spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. It not only possessed immense wealth but also endless experts. Since they had raised countless heavenly geniuses, their power was unfathomable. In the past tens of thousands of years, not a single power had dared to challenge them like this.

Even the Huayun Trading Company, which had the same power level as them, only competed with them through regular means. Such a conflict had never erupted.

Just where did this black-robed youngster come from? As he dared to challenge the Soaring Dragon Company, countless people began to make guesses about his origins.

“Die!”

The dark-faced World King instantly shot toward Long Chen. He had been waiting this entire time for the forces behind Long Chen to reveal themselves. He refused to believe that a little Divine Lord dared to fight them.

However, Long Chen was constantly attacking, ruining their stronghold. As a result, they no longer had the luxury of waiting for Long Chen's reinforcements. The dark-faced World King’s armor lit up, and he attacked.

Runes appeared around him along with his manifestation. In that instant, the laws of the Heavenly Daos changed and the space around Long Chen in particular seemed to freeze.

A halo of light then appeared behind that dark-faced World King’s head. After that, heaven and earth shuddered, and the runes of the Grand Dao converged on him.

“He has activated the World King Divine Radiance. It seems that he is going all-out now. A little Divine Lord actually makes him unleash his full power. This youngster really is terrifying,” said another World King that was standing amongst the spectators.

The World King Divine Radiance was something that could only be unleashed by World Kings that had reached the third Heavenstage. When this divine radiance appeared, the ten thousand Daos merged, turning them into the king of the world, an irresistible existence.

When the World King Divine Radiance appeared, all those with lower realms than the users faced their will suppression. Hence, even from such a distance, people hiding in buildings and protected by formations still quivered when they sensed that pressure.

Long Chen was at the core of that pressure, so he was definitely enduring an unimaginably terrifying will. But his expression still didn’t change. Even when he was fighting a third Heavenstage World King, battle intent still poured out of him.

BOOM!

Upon facing this attack, Long Chen’s entire body shuddered. As his qi and blood flipped inside of him, his heart shook. He had slain second Heavenstage World Kings before, but a third Heavenstage World King was far stronger.

This dark-faced elder’s aura was very condensed. Moreover, his battle armor was a priceless treasure, and his World King pressure was very effective at compressing space. As the space around him was compressed, Long Chen was suffering quite a bit.

“Brat, hand over your treasures and I can spare your life.”

That dark-faced elder’s heart was shaken though. Just now, he hadn’t held back, but Long Chen still survived. Feeling like Long Chen’s status was definitely not ordinary, the elder left Long Chen a way out.

“Unfortunately, I have no plans on sparing any of you sharks that don’t even spit out bones when you eat people. Boss Long San will fight to the death with you.”

Long Chen thought of Bai Fang and Bai Rui, as well as those people that had been filled with hope for the future. The Soaring Dragon Company had obliterated them without remorse, sacrificing them to the Fiend Devil Eye. Although Long Chen had no relationship with anyone else on the ship other than Bai Fang and Bai Rui, he still felt unbearably furious. He could not forget those people. Just remembering their gazes of despair as they fell into the whirlpool, his fury soared. After that, he let out a heaven-shaking roar and repeatedly swung the Minghong Saber, unleashing all of his power.

One blow after another came out, all containing his full power. Even that World King was shaken.

After ten exchanges, Long Chen’s hand was bleeding. The immense backlash force of each blow was starting to injure him.

However, he didn’t care. The primal chaos space’s Wood Foundation Divine Trees provided him with endless life energy, and he had enough confidence in this regard.

As for the dark-faced elder, three of those attacks had struck his body. Despite the protection of his armor and being equipped to his teeth, he still coughed up a mouthful of blood.

The thing that made his heart shake the most was that Long Chen quickly found the weak spots in his armor. One was the center of his back, the other one was the crotch, and the last one was the neck. Long Chen’s attacks didn’t leave those weak spots after finding them. At this moment, he, a third Heavenstage World King who had fought countless battles in his life, was actually being suppressed.

“Senior Yu Shu pities him for being a genius and doesn’t want to use any killing blows! We’ll attack him together and capture him alive!” One of the Soaring Dragon Company’s World Kings sensed something wrong and joined the battle.

This person was quite crafty, giving the dark-faced elder some face by saying that the elder hadn’t subdued Long Chen after all this time because the elder didn’t want to kill a genius.

Following that, the other World Kings all joined in. Rays of divine light then weaved together, and the surrounding space compressed. With over a hundred World Kings joining forces, they used their combined pressure to suppress Long Chen, making him unable to move.

At that moment, Long Chen felt like countless currents were crashing down on him from all directions. With over a hundred World Kings unleashing their pressure on him at once, his body felt like it would be crushed.

“A group of bastards, just wait. I’ll remember this debt!” Long Chen roared. Although this dark-faced elder was a third Heavenstage World King, Long Chen didn’t feel any fear toward him. With his endless life energy, he could exhaust the elder to death.

But with the others joining in, he instantly fell into desperate straits, so his fury soared. These fools… Long Chen had killed one fellow that helped the big dog eat shit, but they still came.

“Brat, even if you grow wings, you won’t be able to flee. Take back those big words!” sneered one of those World Kings.

“If Boss Long San wants to leave, do you think you fools can stop me?!”

Long Chen frowned furiously. After a full-power exchange with that dark-faced World King, he suddenly put away his saber. Flames then appeared in his left hand and lightning in his right hand. A flame lotus merged with lightning.

“Lightning Flames Devour the Heavens!”

Long Chen roared. After that, a mix of lightning and flames was unleashed. It was like the sun was suddenly exploding. Time and space seemed to freeze.
