Chapter 3323 Full Power

Long Chen was practically cheating. His divine ring was sucking in ninety-nine percent of the rainbow hydrangeas. If this continued, wouldn’t everyone simply be offering the Heavenly Rainbow Flame to Long Chen?

Mo Yan didn’t want to be the one to sacrifice for this. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Long Chen, but he didn’t feel that it was worth it to kill Long Chen if it meant sacrificing his chance at obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

It went without saying that Mo Yan possessed quite the restraint. Even after being slapped in the face and mocked by everyone, he could still endure. It truly wasn’t something an ordinary heavenly genius was capable of.

With Mo Yan not moving, the others were caught in a difficult position. This was a bad position for them. They all wanted to hold back as they all had misgivings about each other. But this would only benefit Long Chen.

“Fine, why don’t we all join forces to kill Long Chen? Once he dies, his hydrangeas will scatter, and we can fight for them using our own abilities,” said one of the experts.

The others didn’t reply. They didn’t agree, nor did they disagree. It could be considered a tacit understanding. They truly had no other way of dealing with this.

They could all see that Long Chen was powerful enough that anyone who wanted to kill him would have to pay a price. No one wanted to pay that price alone, as that would only benefit others.

However, as long as everyone attacked together, they could kill Long Chen without having to pay any price. Then they could compete fairly. No one could take advantage of each other like this.

“I’m going.” Kun Wu was the first to move. His golden saber ignited, and with a flap of his wings, he shot toward Long Chen.

Mo Yan followed along with the others. In that instant, Bai Shishi and the others’ hearts clenched.

However, Long Chen had said that Bai Shishi was not to join this battle. She was his life-saving trump card and couldn’t be easily exposed. He would signal her when he wanted her to join.

Even when facing this many terrifying experts, Long Chen didn’t give her the signal. So, she could only watch. If she were to get willful and act contrary to his orders, that would definitely draw out a bad reaction from Long Chen. She was caring more and more about Long Chen’s opinion.

Every single one of those terrifying experts unleashed an aura that was not at all inferior to Mo Yan. The spectators felt like their hearts had stopped beating.

“A group of dancing clowns. Even if you come together, it means nothing.”

Long Chen’s voice was like thunder in the air, shaking everyone. His voice contained an arrogance, a domineeringness, a will that looked down on all others.

“Six Star Battle Armor!” Long Chen cried out inside, and six stars appeared in his eyes. At the same time, six stars lit up within his divine ring, and a pillar of light soared into the heavens.

Long Chen’s 108,000 scales were set ablaze along with the 108,000 stars burning within him. At this moment, Long Chen was finally using his full power.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s aura exploded. Kun Wu was then sent flying with a slash of his saber. The immense power tore apart the void, creating a perception of illusion and reality layering on top of each other and collapsing.

People saw a ray of light get blasted out of the barrier. It then pierced through the land, leaving a trail of smoke. After that, it pierced mountains, cut through rivers, and vanished beyond the horizon. In the end, Kun Wu was blasted so far that no one could even sense his aura.

As for the others, they were forced back by surging qi waves. The cultivators that were still bitterly enduring at the edges of the barrier were all forced out.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Even Bai Shishi was unable to protect everyone and had no choice but to retreat out of the barrier. If they forced it, the Yuhua Palace’s people would definitely be killed.

The world shook and quaked. It felt like the world was flipping around them. This was an aura that no one had ever sensed before. In that instant, both friends and foes shook inside. This kind of power was terrifying.

After blasting away Kun Wu, Long Chen raised his head and roared. That roar blew away the clouds and shattered mountains. There was a dragon roar vaguely accompanying it. After that, Long Chen’s Blood Qi grew stronger and stronger. His aura continued to grow crazily as if there was no limit.

Within this giant barrier, only experts on the level of Mo Yan were able to remain. The others were all forced out.

Mo Yan and the others were also forced back by Long Chen’s aura. Astral winds buffeted them wildly. They were all experts in their own respective domains, but even they had never seen such a terrifying aura.

“Boss is finally going all-out. Our familiar boss is finally back.” Qin Feng clenched his fists excitedly. Just seeing Long Chen like this set his blood on fire. “Ah, I feel like I’m going to explode. I have to do something!”

Qin Feng’s gaze looked around. His battle intent was on fire, and he was like a bloodthirsty beast whose blood had been stimulated. It felt like if he didn’t start fighting, he would explode.

Qin Feng eyed the devil race’s experts in the distance. Exchanging a glance with Qi Yu, both of them nodded.

Qi Yu patted Yu Xuan’s shoulder. “Stay with fairy Shishi. Don’t run around.”

Before Yu Xuan understood what Qi Yu was going to do, he and Qin Feng took out their weapons and charged at the devil race. Xu Zixiong and Bai Xiaole followed them.

“Dark world devil brats, face your deaths!”

Qin Feng roared, and he unleashed a wave of Saber Qi that shook the heavens. With a single blow, dozens of the devil experts were blasted into blood mist.

These devil experts were entirely focused on the battle inside the barrier and hadn’t expected that anyone would attack them. So, they were caught off-guard.

Qin Feng and Qi Yu were both affected by Long Chen’s aura. Their eyes were red, and their killing intent overflowed. They charged into the devil race’s army, and in the blink of an eye, killed hundreds of them.

Just as those devil experts were about to counterattack, space collapsed, forming a giant whirlpool. Three flowers appeared within this whirlpool. As a result, all the devil experts within this region became dazed and sluggish.

“Kill!”

These devils were affected by Bai Xiaole’s pupil art, so their bodies didn’t listen to their commands. Taking advantage of this, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and Xu Zixiong unleashed their powerful attacks, slaughtering them. In this state, those devil experts didn’t even move. They just waited to be killed.

Tens of thousands of them were killed. The devil experts began to panic. Only now did they realize that they were no longer in the barrier, and there was no longer any devil qi supporting them. They were completely suppressed by the laws of this place, and their combat power was reduced by at least half.

“Warriors of the human race, it’s time to slay devils! Do you want to stand out? Do you want to make a name for yourselves? Do you want your name to go down in history? Then what are you waiting for? If you miss this chance, you won’t get another one!” shouted Bai Xiaole as he continued to form hand seals, using his pupil arts continuously to disturb the devil experts.

As if awoken from a dream, the human experts dragged their eyes from the battle in the barrier.

“Kill! They were killing us so happily just now! Now it’s time for revenge!”

With Bai Xiaole’s reminder, these human experts that had been forced to flee and hide from the devil experts instantly charged.

“Fuck, I didn’t get a single rainbow hydrangea! But slaughtering some enemy lifeforms would make this trip worth it. Brothers, kill!”

Following Bai Xiaole’s encouragement, the human experts crashed down on the dark world’s lifeforms like the tide. Things instantly became chaotic.
