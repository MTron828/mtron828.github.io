Chapter 3320 Battling the Devil Race

When Long Chen’s giant divine ring appeared, all the falling rainbow hydrangeas were sucked toward him.

“Has Long Chen gone mad?! If he absorbs so many of the rainbow hydrangeas, he’ll become everyone’s target!” Bai Shishi was stunned. It was no wonder Long Chen was so confident about the competition. His divine ring could actually absorb the rainbow hydrangeas for him.

A seal of flowers appeared on Long Chen’s back. Others had to bitterly work to gather a few thousand rainbow hydrangeas, but Long Chen had instantly absorbed tens of thousands of them, and there were still more surging toward him. There was an endless tide. This drove people crazy.

Theoretically, Long Chen should have held back a bit longer. Once the natural phenomenon appeared, indicating that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was about to descend, he could instantly absorb the rainbow hydrangeas, and then there would be a high chance that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would choose him.

However, this was only the start, but he had revealed this trump card. That would naturally make him a target. Once he was killed, his rainbow hydrangeas would be free for others to take.

It wasn’t just Bai Shishi who was stunned. The Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts that were watching the fight were also dumbfounded. Such a method was truly shocking. Such a thing had never occurred in all of history.

“How regretful, he’s too young. If he could just hold back a bit… Revealing his trump card at this time, isn’t he just drawing killers to himself?” sighed an Immortal King, feeling that Long Chen was far too impetuous. Such a powerful trump card should be left to the end.

The appearance of the divine ring created a whirlpool that sucked the rainbow hydrangeas away without leaving a single one. Mo Yan’s eyes reddened. This was practically cheating.

“The human race really knows how to court death flashily! I’ll make sure that you get your wish!” Mo Yan exploded with killing intent. He spread his wings, and the face of a terrifying fiend appeared on both of them.

After that, a miserable wailing sound rang out. It was like millions of devil ghosts were wailing. Listening carefully, it seemed that these faces were composed of billions of twisted souls.

“You are the first to make me use my Ten Thousand Devil Diagram. You can die in peace.”

Mo Yan flapped his wings, and devil qi crashed toward Long Chen. At the same time, a black spear appeared in his hand. He charged over, bringing with him the pressure of an entire world.

“I don’t even know how many devil babies like you that I’ve killed. But you’re the first to say so many useless words.” Long Chen sneered. As his divine ring shuddered, he shot forward as well. His divine ring seemed to have the world clinging to it. The current him was supported by the Heavenly Daos, and he represented the immortal world.

BOOM!

A huge explosion occurred between the bone saber and the black spear. Divine light shattered laws, causing heaven and earth to cry.

As a result, the falling hydrangeas were sent flying. People only saw two translucent half-spheres clashing.

Long Chen and Mo Yan represented two different sets of laws. It was a clash of the laws of the immortal world against the laws of the devil world. Hence, heaven and earth shuddered, and the wind and clouds changed color. This was a world-shaking clash.

Countless experts were blown back all the way to the edge of the barrier. The astral winds were like knives cutting their faces.

However, they were pleasantly surprised to see that the rainbow hydrangeas had been blown to the edges as well. This gave them a chance to absorb more of them.

As for the spectators watching, they were too busy focusing on Long Chen and Mo Yan. This battle related to the glory of the human race.

The void shuddered. Long Chen absorbed Heavenly Dao energy, sending it into the primal chaos space. The Devil Eye Water Lilies then purified it for him. He truly felt like he was one with heaven and earth, as if the ten thousand Daos were his to control. This feeling was truly marvelous.

Furthermore, he found that in this state, he was able to truly control the divine flames of his 108,000 stars. He had finally found the correct path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

In front of Mo Yan’s attack, Long Chen’s saber was like an immovable mountain. No matter how Mo Yan pushed, his power growing in waves, Long Chen could not be shaken.

Seeing this, Mo Yan smiled cruelly. “Excellent. Your blood soul is great. Once I merge you into my Ten Thousand Devil Diagram, it should make it even stronger.”

Suddenly, countless runes flew out of his wings, transforming into ropes that were like vipers pouncing on Long Chen.

BOOM!

However, as soon as those ropes approached Long Chen, they shattered. Black lightning surfaced on Long Chen’s body, blocking them.

Mo Yan’s pupils shrank. He hadn’t expected that Long Chen could control thunderforce. Furthermore, it was the most terrifying heavenly tribulation lightning.

Just as Mo Yan was shocked by this, Long Chen’s left hand swung in an arc and slapped Mo Yan in the face again.

Mo Yan’s face deformed. People didn’t even see him, but Mo Yan smashed into the ground, leaving a giant ditch. The land rocked.

Everyone was stunned. Long Chen was able to block Mo Yan’s attack with one hand and still have enough power to slap him with his other hand? Was the power disparity between the two of them really so great?

Everyone could tell that something was off. Even an amateur knew that someone who could attack while defending meant that they had to be conserving half of their power. Such a terrifying clash was still Long Chen using less than half of his power? Was he really human?

At the same time as they were shocked, the spectators were excited. Long Chen being so powerful was a good thing. As long as the Heavenly Rainbow Flame didn’t fall into the hands of the dark lifeforms, it was a good thing.

The Yuhua Palace’s disciples with Qi Yu were all dumbfounded. They had not expected Long Chen to be so terrifying. When fighting Jiang Baihe, Long Chen hadn’t been fighting seriously. Otherwise, if he had been serious, one slap would have killed Jiang Baihe.

Mo Yan smashed into the ground, and the astral winds vanished. The rainbow hydrangeas once more fell everywhere. However, the majority were absorbed by Long Chen’s divine ring. The sea of flowers behind him grew.

Standing there with a saber on his shoulder, Long Chen was like an unbeatable battle god. His gaze swept over the entire barrier. He announced, “Humans started later, but grew, receiving the blessing of the Heavenly Daos. They are the spirit of the ten thousand races. As for you, you are nothing more than a tiny devil brat. You dare to be arrogant in front of the human race? To use the words of a senior of our human race, if you look down on the human race, then you can count your sphincter tight if you don’t get the crap beaten out of you. I, Boss Long san, am standing right here. I’m accepting challenges from anyone and any races. Anyone who doesn’t submit, come.”

BOOM!

As soon as he finished speaking, the earth exploded and a black light shot straight toward Long Chen.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Die!”

Mo Yan came flying out, his killing intent shaking the heavens. When his Blood Qi ignited, devil flames filled the sky. He was finally enraged and no longer holding back.
