Chapter 4290: Slaughter Descends Upon the Long Clan

The Heavenly Divinity race, represented by the Eternal clans, possessed absolute authority in the human race. However, it was said that the Heavenly Divinity race had already declined, leaving behind only the eight Eternal clans in the nine heavens and ten lands.

A while back, rumors had spread far and wide that the Eternal Long clan had produced a shocking heavenly genius that rose like a shooting star, his name eclipsing those of all the other monsters in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

He was Long Aotian, an ascender from a lower world, who possessed seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood that had reached the peak of purity.

Furthermore, he also possessed the strongest Supreme Bone and a mutated Spirit Root. Although the Long clan did not publicize anything about his Supreme Bone and Spirit Root, just his seven-color Supreme Blood was enough to shake the entire Nirvana Overflow Heaven. After all, the seven-color Supreme Blood was said to be one of the strongest bloodlines in the world, and it had suddenly appeared in the Long clan.

As a result, many young experts were attracted to visit the Long Clan, and all of them were defeated by Long Aotian. Amongst all those geniuses, not one managed to last more than ten exchanges against Long Aotian.

Once, Long Aotian fought for three days and three nights straight, defeating one hundred and forty-seven Triple Supremes in a row. After that, the name Long Aotian resounded throughout the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

At the time, many people were very curious about why the Long clan would spread his name and not conceal this terrifying trump card for a greater purpose.

It was during the Sage King Convention that people found the answer. In truth, the indomitable Long Aotian had been defeated by Long Chen many times, and the reason he had accepted the challenges from all those heavenly geniuses was to accumulate confidence, to use those victories to invigorate himself.

Long Aotian had always caused quite a sensation in the Long clan. However, his humiliating loss to Long Chen had left countless individuals shaking their heads in disappointment.

It wasn’t that Long Aotian lacked power; he was just unlucky to have encountered an absolute monster, someone capable of slaying half-step Eternals, a figure whose power had broken free from the limits of cultivation realms and surpassed people’s understanding.

In this Sage King Convention, the Long clan sustained tremendous losses, with their young elites almost wiped out. As for Long Aotian, he had his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone stripped from him, and in an instant, he went from a peerless heavenly genius to a cripple.

Rumor had it that when Long Aotian was brought back to the Long clan, the patriarch directly coughed up blood from rage, swearing to make Long Chen pay back this blood debt.

Now, it had been seven days since Long Aotian was brought back. The atmosphere in the entire Long clan’s territory was so tense that even the disciples guarding the gates were on edge, not daring to slack off in the slightest.

Moreover, the expressions of the higher-ups were all frighteningly dark. Everyone was on edge, afraid of saying one wrong word or doing something wrong.

The Long clan was located in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s Arrogant Dragon Prefecture, and the prefecture city was owned mostly by the Long clan.

Being the core of the prefecture, this was a land of immense natural wealth, blessed with nearly flawless fengshui. It featured mountains on one side and water on the other, with dragon veins coursing both beneath the earth and through the heavens.

However, this once bustling place now lay cold and practically empty. Amid this barren spectacle, two figures suddenly appeared, walking toward the Long clan’s gates.

“Who goes there!” The disciples at the gates shouted, but they couldn’t believe what they saw next. “Long… Long… Long Chen!”

The moment they saw Long Chen’s face, they were terrified out of their wits.

These two figures were Long Chen and the palace master. Long Chen had listened to the dragon expert’s instructions and then easily found the High Firmament Academy’s branch in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

At the branch, he found the palace master and told him what he wanted. Unexpectedly, the palace master directly accepted, even saying that he owed Long Chen a favor for helping him in the High Firmament Palace, and now he could repay the favor.

With the palace master supporting him, Long Chen was completely confident. Originally, he had been planning on having a battle of wits with the Long clan first. After all, his father was in their hands, so he didn’t dare to press the Long clan too far.

However, since the dragon expert made Long Chen ask for aid from the palace master, it was evident that it disliked using such methods, thinking that it was a waste of time and energy. It wanted Long Chen to act quickly and efficiently.

“Report to your family head that Long Chen has come,” said Long Chen lightly.

Immediately, one disciple flew away in terror and almost tripped over the doorstep.

However, Long Chen was stuck waiting for a full incense stick’s worth of time without reply. No one had come to receive him.

“What are you doing?!” shouted one of the Long clan’s disciples suddenly.

.

BOOM!

With a single punch, Long Chen obliterated the Long clan's gate, creating a massive hole in their grand formation. As for the disciples standing guard at the gate, they coughed up blood and were flung backward.

“Since you refuse to give me face, I suppose that I don’t need to give you face either. Hand over my father, or don’t blame me for being vicious!” shouted Long Chen threateningly. Just like that, he stepped past the gate.

For the Long clan to not give him a reply after an incense stick’s worth of time, this was a clear show of might. Long Chen naturally wouldn’t indulge them.

“Brat, how brazen!”

When Long Chen barged into the Long clan, a furious roar rang out, coming from an elder with a white beard. He was a half-step Eternal.

As soon as he appeared, he directly launched a claw toward Long Chen’s chest, shouting, “Little brute, this isn’t a place you can run wild in!”

“Old thing, it seems you feel like life is too long.” Long Chen sneered and also unleashed his own claw.

Since this elder didn’t use his Eternal energy, Long Chen didn’t summon his battle armor either. It was entirely a clash of physical strength.

BANG! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Suddenly, a sinister smile appeared on the elder’s face, and a net diagram appeared on his palm.

That net then shot out like thousands of vipers climbing over Long Chen’s arm, and in an instant, most of Long Chen’s body was wrapped up by it.

This elder was extremely sinister, using his Eternal divine weapon secretly. Seeing that the elder wasn’t going all-out, Long Chen had responded in kind, inadvertently falling into the elder's trap.

“Hmph, a genius that can slay half-step Eternals? What dogshit. Give up, or I’ll kill you!” ordered the elder, as he had absolute confidence in this technique of his. After all, this net was laced with poison, and once caught, it would sink thorns into its target, immobilizing them. He had conned an unknown number of experts to death with this move.

Aware of Long Chen’s strength, he wanted to exploit Long Chen’s youth, believing that the conceit of youth was a fatal weakness. He thought that Long Chen was directly caught because of it.

“Foolish idiot, in your next life, remember that schemes are garbage in front of absolute power.” Long Chen didn’t show the slightest panic upon being caught, his eyes full of disdain.

Upon seeing this, the elder’s expression suddenly changed and he hastily pulled back his net. There was a tearing sound, Long Chen’s upper garments were torn off, revealing his dragon scale battle armor. The golden dragon scales had seven-colored divine light flowing within them, and the thorns of the net were unable to pierce through them.

The elder was shocked and an ominous feeling swept over him.

“Stop!” A shout rang out through the air.

PFFT!

However, Long Chen’s claw already pierced through the elder’s head.

“There’s no stopping now that I’m here. What were you doing before?”

One half-step Eternal’s corpse of the Long clan fell to the ground limply.
