Long Chen could only face the giant hand directly. Despite knowing that he might very likely be turned to dust after this attack, it was not fear flowing out of him but a soaring will to fight instead. He felt no negative emotions. All he knew was that the only thing that could save his life was a full-power attack.

His eyes suddenly turned scarlet, and a berserk fury unfurled. Even within Devil Spirit Mountain with different laws of the world, the heavens were still affected by Long Chen’s anger.

The void rumbled. It was as if millions of stars were exploding, as if the god who had created the world was now destroying it.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

As a giant black saber-image pierced through the heavens, fury raged through the world. Black qi exploded out of Evilmoon, and a furious dragon roar rang out, causing a resonance with heaven and earth. Long Chen and Evilmoon’s combined power was fully unleashed in one blow.

BOOM!

The giant hand struck the heaven-splitting blade directly. As a result, the void shattered and cracked to the end of the world. Countless stars in the cosmos shuddered as if they were about to fall.

“Not good. The phenomenon that the old man warned me about has appeared. My power isn’t balanced.” Long Chen’s heart turned cold.

The old man had repeatedly said that he had to control his anger to unleash the ninth form of Split the Heavens. His power had to be balanced perfectly before he attacked.

Otherwise, although this technique could still be unleashed, it would leave behind a serious internal injury. If such injuries accumulated over time, they would slowly cripple a person.

Long Chen clearly hadn’t properly balanced his power just now. Adding on the pressure from his opponent, all his bones were crushed. He received an instantaneous heavy injury.

However, the fact was that Long Chen had managed to block that attack. Both the Martial Heaven Continent’s people and the devil race’s experts were shocked.

The devil race’s experts in particular knew who had just attacked. That was a peak expert of their devil race, and Long Chen had actually blocked their killing blow.

The hand crumbled, however, another hand condensed in the sky once more, reaching toward Long Chen, this time with even greater pressure.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen hastily used the primal chaos space’s life energy to heal. He raised Evilmoon once again.

Although on the surface he looked like he had recovered, Long Chen was well aware of just how serious his injury was. This injury was partially from himself and partially from that devil expert.

If he had to block his attack a second time, he would probably die. But space had been suppressed, and he had no other choice.

Just at this moment, a fluctuation spread from the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. It flew out on its own, surprising Long Chen.

“Long Chen, out of the way!”

Suddenly, a shout rang out. Long Chen looked over to see that at some point, the old man had entered Devil Spirit Mountain. The Heaven Splitting Blade blazed with light.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

The old man also unleashed the same technique, however, this time, the frozen space instantly collapsed. Long Chen was sent flying back toward the Martial Heaven Continent by the old man’s power and was caught by Chu Yao.

When a giant saber-image appeared in the sky, the void collapsed, fragments of spacetime flying through the air. That appearance was many times greater than what Long Chen had caused.

Seeing the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet appear behind him, Long Chen understood that it was supporting the old man’s all-out attack.

BOOM!

As the saber fell, the giant hand instantly shattered, and the saber-image continued. All those touched by it were blasted to bits.

The saber-image appeared as if it would continue to the ends of the world. It was as if the entire world was going to be cut in two.

“This attack…!”

Countless people were stunned by this attack. Just how was the old man capable of unleashing such an attack? He was only at the peak of Netherpassage.

When the saber was about to reach the army of the devil race at the rear, an elder suddenly appeared before them. He smashed a staff at the saber-image.

As a result, the saber-image exploded, unleashing a blast of astral winds that sent the nearby devil experts flying like falling leaves. Only the elder continued standing there.

“Shameless old thing, you actually attacked a child at your age? If you have the guts, why don’t you come over and fight me? Let’s see if I can cut you into nine-nine eighteen pieces!” shouted the old man furiously.

“It’s eighty-one,” reminded Long Chen.

“You shut up! You’ve lost the face of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. What kind of crap was that? Is the ninth form of Split the Heavens used like that? How many times have I told you about it, yet you still made that mistake? If it weren’t for this deed you accomplished, I’d really beat you!” shouted the old man.

Long Chen shrugged, cursing himself for being so bored as to find trouble for himself. The old man was in the Heavens’ Wrath state. Arguing with him about what nine-nine meant was truly stupid.

The devil elder glared at the old man. Light circulated in his eyes as his aura grew. It seemed that he was preparing for a battle.

However, when he looked at the Martial Heaven Continent, his rising aura suddenly stopped. He snorted, “The Martial Heaven Continent’s destiny has come to an end. You are just struggling on your deathbed. Enjoy your final moments. So what if you reclaimed the Western Desert Ax? A half-dead Western Desert Ax won’t save you.”

The elder waved his staff, and the giant army slowly retreated into the depths of Devil Spirit Mountain.

Long Chen followed the final gaze of that elder and saw the High Priest and Daoist Heavenly Feather. So he had been restrained by their existence.

“What? The Western Desert Ax?”

Others didn’t see the High Priest or Daoist Heavenly Feather, but hearing that elder mention the Western Desert Ax, it was like a bolt of lightning had struck them. They stared at Long Chen in shock.
