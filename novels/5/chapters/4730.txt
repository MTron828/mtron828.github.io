Chapter 4719 Mysterious Man

A thin man in a gray cloak stood before Long Chen, his face concealed. To Long Chen’s surprise, there was a strange energy flowing around him, blocking everyone’s senses. Even Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils were unable to see through it.

Of course, if Bai Xiaole and Little Nine worked together to use the Six Dao Heavenly Eyes, they would likely be able to see through this man’s origins. However, it was extremely rude to do such a thing to a guest, so Bai Xiaole simply alerted Long Chen.

“Dean Long Chen, your reputation precedes you. It is an honor to finally meet you. As expected, you are a dragon amongst men.” The mysterious man cupped his fists toward Long Chen.

His words were courteous, but his tone was rather apathetic. There was little sincerity, almost as though he were reciting from memory.

Observing the mysterious man, Long Chen reciprocated with a respectful cup of his fists. “You must have traveled a long journey. I’m sorry for the delay.”

Long Chen remained cautious in the presence of this mysterious individual. Although this man’s energy had completely rendered Long Chen’s senses ineffective, his intuition screamed at him that this man was an extremely dangerous figure. He was likely stronger than Wu Hun and the others.

“I know that you must be very busy, so I won’t waste your precious time. I have come to give you a piece of information. I believe that you will definitely be interested in it,” stated this man.

“Oh? Then please, go on,” Long Chen replied. He appreciated the directness, as he disliked beating around the bush.

“The Lifehunter race will gather three days from now in the Starry River Island inside the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea. At that time, all the elites of the Lifehunter race should be present.”

Long Chen was startled, but he maintained a neutral expression. “Is this information reliable?”

“Of course it is. I spent a great deal of effort to obtain this information. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have run all the way over to see you,” replied that mysterious man. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“May I ask what your goal is?”

“I have some issues with the Lifehunter race, but as I have something important to do, I don’t have the time to deal with them. I heard that you also have issues with the Lifehunter race, so I took the trip to give you this information. As for whether you believe it or not, whether you do anything about it or not, it is all up to you. I still have things to do, so I won’t disturb you any longer. Goodbye.” Not even waiting for Long Chen to reply, he directly turned and left.

Seeing such rude behavior, Bai Xiaole angrily protested, “Who does he think he is!? He hid his face, uttering such outrageous claims and then just leaving like that?”

The mysterious person neither showed his face nor said his name, and his tone also lacked any respect, angering Bai Xiaole. After all, Long Chen was the person Bai Xiaole revered the most, so it was only natural for him to feel displeased.

“Boss, we should ignore him! I feel like this is a scheme! If you go, you’ll fall for it,” said Little Nine with an angry tone.

Long Chen smiled and nodded. “Little Nine, you are correct. This is a scheme.”

“It really is? Is he from the same side as the Lifehunter race? Are they trying to make us jump into their net?” asked Bai Xiaole angrily.

This time, Long Chen shook his head. “No, he’s not from the same side as the Lifehunter race. His information should be very reliable as well.”

“Then... then what is the scheme?” asked a dumbfounded Bai Xiaole.

“I’m not sure. But it definitely is a scheme.”

“Are we going?” asked Bai Xiaole.

“We’re going,” confirmed Long Chen.

“Even though we know it’s a scheme, we’re still going?”

“Do you remember what I’ve told you?” asked Long Chen with a smile.

Bai Xiaole and Little Nine recited in unison, “In front of absolute power, all schemes are useless!”

“Hahaha, you remember it well,” laughed Long Chen.

“Hehe, I understand. Boss, you mean to say that whatever scheme there is, you’ll still do what you want!” Little Nine laughed. This little fox had a cute but sinister smile on its face now.

“Three days to get to the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea’s Starry River Island. Xiaole, inform the Dragonblood Legion. Tell them to get ready. We’ll move out in two hours!”

“Yes!”

Bai Xiaole excitedly ran over, and Little Nine was dancing with excitement on his shoulder.

“Evilmoon, what do you think of that guy?” asked Long Chen.

“That little fellow is very distasteful in my opinion. His gaze kept drifting toward me several times. It's as if he thinks I'm rather mouthwatering,” remarked Evilmoon.

“Mouthwatering...”

“You insolent brat, is there something wrong with your brain? Just because I'm not human doesn't mean I can't use common expressions! Why do you have to be so picky?!” Evilmoon snapped.

“Alright, my bad. So, on a serious note, did you sense anything from him?” asked Long Chen.

“No.”

After that, Evilmoon simply fell silent, clearly still offended despite Long Chen’s apology. Long Chen found that Evilmoon was different from how it had been back then. Its character was more lively now, lacking the unflustered calmness from their time in the mortal world.

“Boss!”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran came.

“How can we get to the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea’s Starry River Island?” asked Long Chen.

“The Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea isn’t that far from us, so three transportations should get us close enough. But to keep our movement concealed, I’ve chosen seven transportations that will take around six hours. As for the Starry River Island, I’ve never heard of it, but that shouldn’t be a problem. When we arrive, I can use a heaven-peering grand formation to sense the location of the strongest fluctuations. That should be Starry River Island,” replied Xia Chen.

After Xia Chen was done, Guo Ran said, “Once we’ve confirmed the position of Starry River Island, I propose that the four corps advance from four different directions. Each corps will be equipped with formation discs crafted by Xia Chen, enabling them to switch positions instantaneously. This way, it’s easier to make new strategies based on the enemy’s positions. I’ve taken a look at the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea’s terrain and come up with seven strategies that we can employ in battle.”

“Guo Ran, how is your armor?” asked Long Chen.

“All the materials have been prepared, and the blueprint is essentially set. Boss, you gave me way too many materials. This armor will involve thousands of different immortal metals, so the blueprint is extremely complicated. It took me a long time to figure it out. When this armor is complete, I will definitely sweep through the heavens,” boasted Guo Ran.

“Can you participate in this battle?” Long Chen frowned. Guo Ran’s old battle armor was broken, and he wasn’t done with his new one yet. That was a bit dangerous. After all, they would be facing the world’s most terrifying assassins this time.

“Boss, even without my battle armor, I still have my crossbow. I can attack from a long distance, directing the combat and providing assistance where it is needed,” said Guo Ran.

“Fine. I’m just worried you will want to stand out once we arrive at the battlefield.”

“Don’t worry, that won’t happen this time... as I don’t have the ability,” replied Guo Ran bashfully.

Hearing that, Long Chen was at ease. Wu Hun’s punch had moderated this fellow’s bravado, and it was a good thing. Otherwise, this fellow’s confidence would overinflate.

“Then we’ll move out. This time, we’ll take the initiative. The Lifehunter race will feel the hot blood of the Dragonblood Legion!” Long Chen declared with a smile, a fierce glint in his eyes.
