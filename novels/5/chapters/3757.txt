Chapter 3746 Descendants of the Sun

A group of demonic beasts was gathering. Amongst them was a Divine Venerate, who was saying something to the young demonic beasts.

Looking behind this Divine Venerate, Long Chen could see a giant altar with a burning divine stone on it. The flames emitted immense faith energy.

“Children, pray! Pray to our great Sun God! It will bestow its blessing on you! When you become Beast Kings, the great Sun God’s blessing will look after you, illuminating your path forward. You will no longer be lost, no longer be alone…”

The Divine Venerate shouted loudly, waving his hands. Millions of demonic beasts knelt and shouted loudly along with him.

There were hundreds of thousands of young demonic beasts praying devoutly. As they prayed, the divine stone on the altar shone even brighter, illuminating this world.

The Divine Venerate knelt and kowtowed toward the altar, emotionally shouting, “Great Sun God, do you hear your followers’ devout calls? They are your children! They are on the verge of breaking through to the Beast King realm and need your guidance! They need your blessing. Please…”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Suddenly, a ray of divine light descended from the heavens, illuminating the altar. Through the flames, they seemed to see a giant bird descend.

“Great Sun God, you’ve personally descended!” 

The Divine Venerate cried out excitedly upon seeing this giant bird. He then repeatedly kowtowed. The other disciple also fervently cried out the name of the Sun God.

“Don’t be emotional. If you want, I will come more often.” A mocking voice rang out from the altar.

The person to arrive at the altar was precisely Long Chen. He had noticed the divine stone on the altar from a great distance. At that moment, its flame fluctuations woke up the Ice Soul and Huo Linger in the primal chaos space.

As soon as they heard Long Chen’s voice, these demonic beasts felt like something was wrong. They raised their heads from their kowtows.

Just then, Long Chen reached out and grabbed the burning stone that was several meters tall. Following that, the altar dimmed.

“Friends, goodbye. If you really miss me, keep praying. If I hear you, I’ll definitely come.” Long Chen smiled warmly at the stunned demonic beasts. He then waved his hand, crushed a transportation talisman, and vanished.

It took several blinks of an eye before these demonic beasts reacted. Their faith divine stone was actually stolen in broad daylight. This was no god descent.

Heaven-shaking roars rang out.

“Chase!”

All the demonic beasts summoned their true forms and charged out in every direction.

Regretfully, Long Chen had used several transportation formations and completely escaped their territory.

“Big brother Long Chen, you’re amazing!”

Within the primal chaos space, Huo Linger cried out delightedly. She then transformed into a flame dragon and began to absorb the energy of the flame divine stone. But she was stopped by the Ice Soul.

“This is the faith flame of the descendants of the sun. If you absorb it, you will become the mortal enemy of the sun’s descendants. Think this through,” warned the Ice Soul.

Huo Linger was startled. She didn’t know how to respond. Long Chen’s voice then rang out this time. 

“What descendants of the sun? Isn’t it just the Golden Crow race? Are they so amazing? I don’t even know how many of their people I’ve slain before. We were never friends, so go ahead and absorb it.”

The Sun Flame was the ultimate form of the Golden Crow Flame. In the Heavenly Flame World, Long Chen had slain an unknown number of the Golden Crow race’s experts. He had long since stopped having any misgivings toward them.

Hearing that, Huo Linger was delighted. She hugged the divine stone and bit down. But then she was shocked to find that she was unable to absorb the divine stone’s flame energy.

The Ice Soul said, “This isn’t the ordinary Golden Crow Flame. It is the flame of the sun's descendants. Although it isn’t the true Sun Flame, it contains immense faith energy. It isn’t something that you can devour now. Since you are so set on absorbing it, fine. I’ll teach you a way to control flames. Once you devour it, split a bit with me.”

Long Chen was in the midst of flying when he heard the Ice Soul’s words. As a result, his body swayed, and he smashed into a mountain peak.

“You’re too shameless! We’re the ones risking the karma, but you’re just going to take the advantages?” raged Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen, don’t be like this. Big sister Bing Po is a good person. I’m willing to share this energy with her.” Even before the Ice Soul said anything, Huo Linger already explained for her.

Long Chen cursed inside. This child had been won over. Now, she even spoke for this outsider. Long Chen didn’t know how that made him feel. But since Huo Linger had said this, there was nothing he could do.

Bing Po transmitted a mnemonic chant to Huo Linger who then mastered this technique in just a moment. After forming hand seals, flame chains shot out of her and wrapped around the divine stone.

Flame energy was dragged out of the inside of the divine stone. They underwent a transformation through the chains before entering Huo Linger’s body.

After that, Huo Linger began to absorb the divine stone’s energy. What Long Chen hadn’t expected was for this stone to contain incomparably vast energy.

Huo Linger’s aura was climbing crazily. She didn’t just recover her old power, but terrifying flames began to burst out of her body. She was unable to control just how much energy she was gaining.

Bing Po then pressed her hands on Huo Linger’s body. The energy that Huo Linger couldn’t control was absorbed by Bing Po. This way, there wasn’t the slightest waste.

In just two hours, the two of them completely absorbed all the flame energy. After that, the divine stone lost all of its colors and turned to dust.

As for Huo Linger, she was like a completely different person. She was full of power. With a single raise of her hand, golden flames erupted out of her. She was still unable to fully control this power.

The Sun Flame was ranked sixth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking, even higher than the Ice Soul. Now, Huo Linger controlled a trace of the Sun Flame’s power. Although it was just a trace, it was enough to cause her power to rise to an absolutely terrifying realm.

Furthermore, Bing Po had also benefited. Originally, her body was a bit translucent, as if it might dissipate at any moment. But this energy caused her body to be a bit more condensed, and her complexion also improved. Even so, her aura hadn’t changed.

Huo Linger had absorbed half of the divine stone’s energy, while the other half that leaked out was absorbed by Bing Po. As a result, Huo Linger was completely transformed, but this was almost nothing to Bing Po. Bing Po was like a sea on the verge of drying up. She needed an immense amount of energy to recover.

Huo Linger became lively. She thanked Bing Po enthusiastically just like she was her big sister. If there was a conflict between Long Chen and Bing Po, she would protect this big sister of hers.

Bing Po didn’t stand aloof. She began to transmit some techniques for controlling flames to Huo Linger. Compared to Bing Po, Huo Linger’s flame control arts were crude.

Seeing Bing Po seriously teach Huo Linger these techniques, Long Chen felt a bit better. It seemed that risking his life to save her had been worth it.

The next day, Long Chen finally arrived at the marker of the city. When he reached the city gates, someone suddenly approached him. Long Chen instinctively protected himself with his spiritual yuan, causing that person to bounce off.

“Aiya!”

That person cried out and tumbled to the ground. Suddenly, a group of hostile faces surrounded him.

“An extortion scam?”

Long Chen frowned, a touch of killing intent appearing in his eyes.
