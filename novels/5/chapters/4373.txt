Chapter 4362 Resolving Things with Martial Power

BOOM!

When Long Chen passed through the spatial gate, the void thundered explosively, and the entire world quivered. After that, a powerful pressure crashed down on Long Chen.

In an instant, Long Chen understood that even with both worlds fully connected, the two worlds still had their original laws present. In the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, Long Chen could unleash his power freely. However, he was somewhat restricted here. Although it wasn’t that disturbing, it still affected him.

This was why those so-called Eight Great Kings and Six Great Lords simply shouted at Long Chen from through space but didn’t dare to actually enter the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

If they were to fight in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, they would be suppressed. While they were the strongest experts of their generation, Long Chen also wasn’t a weakling. Under those unfavorable terms, they had no assurance of being able to beat Long Chen.

At the same time, they were afraid of the palace master setting his sights on them. If the palace master were to personally attack them, they wouldn’t even have a chance to run.

That was why they could only shout and let some of their subordinates run around the Nirvana Overflow Heaven in an attempt to force Long Chen out.

After Long Chen had passed through the gate, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Yue Zifeng, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, and Bai Xiaole were right behind him. They also immediately sensed what he sensed.

However, they didn’t panic and had a disdainful sneer on their faces instead.

“Long Chen, you little coward, you’re finally willing to come out of your tortoise shell?”

Out of nowhere, Long Chen was surrounded by countless experts from the devil race, the beast race, the Blood race, and even the Ghost Dao. However, there was an unexpected race amidst them—the human race.

All these experts were World Kings. Each of them was a true expert, and their auras raged through the air. Their lineup stretched beyond the horizon, seemingly endless.

Within their ranks were some human experts, and they were easily identified by the distinct robes with marks. The marks could be seen on their faces as well, representing the faction they were loyal to.

Those people immediately puffed out their chests upon seeing Long Chen. Among them, one person wearing white robes with intersecting mammoth tusks stared at Long Chen coldly. He was the one to say those provoking words.

This expert’s aura was shockingly powerful as he was a formidable Triple Supreme. Most curious of all, he vaguely possessed the aura of a demonic beast.

Following that, Guo Ran pointed his finger at that person, a talisman appeared in Xia Chen’s hand, and Yue Zifeng’s hand slowly grasped the hilt of his sword.

However, Long Chen simply raised his hand, indicating not to attack. Long Chen then looked at that person.

“I really don’t understand why you refuse to act like a person and instead become a dog. After selling out your ancestors and betraying your soul, you dare to act arrogant here. Are you trying to bolster your own courage?”

Long Chen looked at those human experts mixed within their ranks and was infuriated, finding it incomprehensible. Just how did millions of humans join the other races?

Were they idiots? Did they not know that the humanless world and the Great Desolate World had once carried out a bloody massacre of the human race? Why were they willing to collude with these animals? Long Chen really wanted to know just how their brains worked.

Numerous human experts continued to flood out of the gate behind Long Chen. Initially, they exuded a near-zealous passion, but as they saw their enemies, a collective gasp escaped them.

They had gathered millions and millions of experts. However, compared to the Great Desolate World’s experts, they were outnumbered more than ten to one.

This was their first time in the Great Desolate World. So, when they sensed the suppression of this world’s laws, their confidence faltered. The hot blood Long Chen had raised within them also cooled down.

Seeing Long Chen glaring at those people, they wanted to know if Long Chen would give the signal to retreat upon seeing this disadvantageous situation.

The person Long Chen spoke to suddenly laughed. “Long Chen, stop acting so righteous. What do you mean by selling out my ancestors and betraying my soul? This is a world for the ten thousand races. The ten thousand races are the masters of this world, and the human race is just one of ten thousand. This world should be led by all ten thousand races, not dominated by one single race. Only harmony can bring about a peaceful world. Long Chen, you are constantly causing wars, causing countless lifeforms to lose their lives before their time comes. You are a sinner with the karmic debt of countless lives on your shoulders. Even the heavens want to kill you! What right do you have to criticize others?”

This person’s words were incredibly sharp and struck Long Chen perfectly, enraging everyone on the Dragonblood Legion’s side.

“What? You don’t accept the truth? The hand of the heavens even came in your tribulation! Everyone saw it! If Long Chen was not a supremely evil existence, why would the Heavenly Daos want to destroy him so badly?” sneered that person. “You’ve all been tricked. Long Chen is a conman, and he is using your kindness and ignorance. He deliberately instigated a war to break this world’s peace; his sins are countless and unforgivable. I’d advise you to wake up quickly. Don’t keep getting tricked by him.”

“Shut up! My boss has always disdained tricking others. If it weren’t for my boss, who knows how many people would have been killed by these animals? You don’t have any other skill, but your tongue is quite sharp!” Guo Ran cursed him.

“The gates to the Great Desolate World and the humanless world opened due to the will of the heavens. However, Long Chen defied the heavens and stopped them from opening. He even entered the humanless world and slaughtered innocent lifeforms, stealing their treasures. The humanless world originally had no enmity with the human race, but Long Chen deliberately sowed the seeds of dissent, dragging the entire human race into his scheming. It can be said that these two worlds’ lifeforms are all innocent. Long Chen is the main culprit. This disorder was all caused by him!” shouted that person righteously.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Are you an idiot?! The humanless world has no enmity with the human race?! Then why did they name themselves the humanless world?!” Guo Ran was so enraged that his teeth creaked from how hard he gritted them.

It was common knowledge that the humanless world and the Great Desolate World were once shared by the ten thousand races, including the human race. But then, the humanless world’s experts wiped out the human race, and the Great Desolate World enslaved them. Nevertheless, this person actually spoke up for these animals, inverting black and white. He was absolutely hateful.

“That… that is already ancient history. I’m talking about the present. Our human race has committed many mistakes throughout history, and we have to learn from them,” argued the individual, persisting in his viewpoint.

“You!”

Guo Ran felt like he would explode from rage. He had the urge to charge out and crush this facetious bastard.

“You cannot wake up someone who’s pretending to sleep. However, you can make sure he sleeps forever!” said Long Chen as he turned from Guo Ran to the other human experts. “The reason I didn’t immediately attack is that I wanted to know what they were thinking. Now, I know, and there’s no need to waste any more words. Martial power isn’t the most optimal method for resolving problems, but unresolved problems can only be fixed with martial power. Leave it to future historians to decide who is right and who is wrong today!”

“Seven Star Battle Armor!” As Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, seven sun-like stars illuminated this world.
