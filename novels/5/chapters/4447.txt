Chapter 4436 Primal Chaos Dragon Sovereign

For some reason, when the nether dragon race leader asked this question, Long Chen felt a tightening in his chest. He vaguely had a bad feeling, as if this question seemed to implicate that mysterious dragon expert.

The mysterious dragon expert, who had helped Long Chen countless times, was shrouded in mystery. Despite this, he knew he could fully trust it.

Long Chen wished to learn a bit more about this dragon expert from the nether dragon race leader, but he refrained from doing so. His intuition warned him that the karma entwined with this matter was far more formidable and terrifying than he could imagine.

“Call me daddy and I’ll tell you,” snickered Long Chen.

“Courting death!” the nether dragon race leader shouted furiously. Long Chen refused to submit to any of his threats or offers, so he was unable to get anything from Long Chen.

“Father, you should leave him to me. Only with absolute power can we make the human race submit.” Netherdragon Tianzhao finally spoke up. In truth, he had long since lost his patience and was on the verge of exploding. The powerful nether dragon race had come out in full force today to make a name for themselves. However, Long Chen’s continuous insults and disdain had enraged all of them.

“If you can capture him alive, do so. His dragon blood aura is weak, but its sacred energy is of an unimaginable purity—similar to that of the legendary primal chaos Dragon Sovereign. If we can obtain the secrets of the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign, then our nether dragon race will truly soar,” transmitted the race leader.

“I understand.” Netherdragon Tianzhao nodded.

At this moment, the enormous Ten Thousand Dragon Nest slowly fell back, leaving the center of the battlefield to Netherdragon Tianzhao.

When the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest reached the border of the mountain, numerous figures strolled out from its caves. Shockingly, tens of thousands of Eternal experts emerged from within.

Among the younger generation, there were over ten budding Doyens. As for the Triple Supremes, there were just too many to count.

They quietly stood behind the race leader, not saying a word. Even though the onlookers were aware that the nether dragon race was displaying their might, the sheer magnitude of their presence still sent shockwaves through the crowd.

Their power was truly incredible. Other than those ten-plus budding Doyens, the rest were all actual members of the nether dragon race.

Everyone was silent as their gazes concentrated on Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Seeing that the battle was approaching, the Dragonblood warriors also retreated to the edge of the battlefield.

For a moment, everyone was silent, staring at two people: one was this generation’s Sage King and the other was the first awakened Doyen of the nine heavens and ten lands. Today, there would be a life-and-death battle between the two of them. Even the spectators were so nervous that they found it hard to breathe. The only thing they could hear was the sound of their heartbeat.

Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao locked eyes from mere meters away. Their gazes were like four sharp swords clashing, and an imperceptible killing intent started to emanate between them.

“You shouldn’t have insulted the great nether dragon race. Now, it will be hard for me to leave with your intact corpse. Do you have any last words?” asked Netherdragon Tianzhao.

His voice was icy, devoid of any emotion. It was as if all his anger had vanished, leaving behind an air of absolute calmness.

“I have many last words, but there’s no need for me to say them here. As for you, did you bring your whole family with you so that they could save your life in the end?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“You’re overthinking it. In this world, no one in the same realm can match me,” asserted Netherdragon Tianzhao confidently.

“How coincidental. I feel the same way. From the mortal world to the immortal world, after countless battles, I’ve never encountered an opponent who could match me in the same realm. It's always been consecutive battles, group skirmishes, or fights across realms that posed a challenge. But no one in the same realm has ever bested me. So you will definitely lose. Bringing so many people here, to me, is just for them to save you when you lose,” replied Long Chen.

“Are you trying to provoke me? Long Chen, you’ve really disappointed me. You’re too naive,” remarked Netherdragon Tianzhao with a faint smile.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Provoke you? No, no, I often say that in front of absolute power, all schemes are worthless. I'm saying this not to hold you to any promise but just so that everyone can hear it. This way, when you do lose, we can all witness whether your nether dragon race values its reputation more than your life.” Long Chen shrugged.

Hearing their conversation, the spectators felt their hearts pounding crazily inside their chests. Both Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao seemed to have absolute confidence in themselves. However, in this decisive battle, one would definitely lose, perhaps even meeting their demise.

If Long Chen lost, without a backer to save him, he would die. On the other hand, Netherdragon Tianzhao was backed by his father and their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Supported by so many nether dragon race’s experts, even if he lost, death seemed like an unlikely outcome.

When people looked at Netherdragon Tianzhao and the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, they also wondered now. Could Long Chen be telling the truth?

“What a petty person’s view, the judgment of a fool. When has my proud nether dragon race ever been afraid? The winner is the king. If Netherdragon Tianzhao were to lose to you, he wouldn’t be worthy to be my son, and I would personally kill him,” sneered the race leader.

“Did you hear that? There’s no need to keep arguing. Your little schemes are really laughable,” said Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“No, no, no. This is not arguing. This is making it clear. So when I slap you in the face, it will be even more resounding,” replied Long Chen with a smile.

“Are you done talking?” asked Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“You can make your move at any time,” responded Long Chen indifferently.

As they were done talking, an eerie silence settled over heaven and earth. The world appeared to have fallen into an absolute silence, devoid of any sound. The spectators couldn’t even hear their own breath or heartbeat.

Suddenly, their hair and clothes started to flutter. Their expressions grew serious, and two pairs of eyes locked onto each other like leopards staring at their prey.

All of a sudden, majestic dragon roars resonated through the air, and a golden and black light erupted at the same time.

BOOM!

The two of them collided like two stars crashing into each other.
