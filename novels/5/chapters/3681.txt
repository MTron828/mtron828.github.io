Chapter 3670

Long Chen had originally thought that with the illusion formation that Xia Chen set up right before they left, the enemies would be deceived for at least a while. After all, no one else would be entering the trial while they were there.

He hadn’t expected someone to specifically take a look at the lightning pool. As a result, as soon as he looked closer, the illusion formation was broken. Everything was exposed. This power of expulsion was clearly trying to bring him out. At this moment, a black dagger appeared in his hand, and he stabbed it into the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror with all his might.

BANG!

What shocked Long Chen was that this mysterious dagger that had never failed to break any defense actually failed to pierce the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. A powerful backlash then shook Long Chen’s Blood Qi. He almost lost hold of the black dagger.

“Not good!”

Long Chen had never expected this. He had absolute confidence in the black dagger, but it disappointed him today.

However, this strike from the black dagger did cause a thumb-sized nick on the flat surface of the mirror.

Seeing that nick, Long Chen put away the dagger and pulled out the Minghong Saber, preparing to attack the broken part.

However, before he even attacked, cracks formed from that nick, instantly spreading through the entire Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. This mirror that reached even the stars in the heavens shattered with a final boom.

A mirror that had stood for countless years, overlooking the nine heavens and ten lands, was finally broken. Despite instinctively using its full power to resist Long Chen’s full-power attack, it was unable to defend against that dagger in the end.

The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror shattered, transforming into astral motes that dissipated into the cracks of space. The power from its explosion made Long Chen crash into a spatial wall and cough up blood. After that, he was forced out of the space of the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror.

When Long Chen reappeared on the Nine Underworld Island, a vast power unfurled and a ripple caused the world to flip. Waves from the sea soared so high that they swallowed up the river of stars.

Wherever the ripple spread, devastation followed. Mountains were turned into flat land, and the mist covering this land was instantly blown apart.

Enduring this ripple, Long Chen’s body was almost torn apart. Even as violet qi circulated throughout his body, he was unable to stop cracks from spreading across his body. The power of the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror’s shattering almost crushed him.

Fortunately, being blown back reduced a portion of the power. As he was blown further back, the pressure decreased.

Long Chen then coughed up blood as he resisted with all of his power. At the same time, the primal chaos space’s life energy poured into his body, helping him recover.

As he was blown back, Long Chen saw countless Nine Underworld Hall experts fleeing for their lives. But it was useless. They were quickly caught up by the ripple and blasted into nothingness.

Long Chen could sense Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s positions. However, he wasn’t worried about them. They were already forced out of the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror before the explosion occurred. They were also fleeing, but Guo Ran had his Supreme Bone, and Xia Chen had countless life-protecting talismans. At most, they would only be slightly injured.

Long Chen was flying for several breaths’ time before the pressure finally lightened enough for him to breathe. He then checked his body and was shocked to find that the majority of his bones were broken. His meridians were also damaged.

The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror’s explosion was too terrifying. It had almost blasted him apart. But no matter what, the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror was destroyed. He had accomplished his mission.

“DIE!”

Suddenly, the void quivered and a sword pierced through the void with icy killing intent. Even before the sword arrived, a terrifying killing intent completely locked Long Chen down.

“Chen Ming!”

Long Chen’s heart shook as he recognized his attacker. It was the island master of the Nine Underworld Island, the strongest person here.

“You weren’t killed by the explosion?” Long Chen snorted and swung the Minghong Saber at him.

BOOM!

Long Chen grunted. A burst of pain struck his arm, and the Minghong Saber almost flew away. He was too heavily injured.

“Long Chen?! It’s you?!” After that exchange, the furious Chen Ming was even further incensed.

The explosion of the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror had blown apart Long Chen’s mask, revealing his true appearance. Hence, Long Chen was instantly recognized.

“If it wasn’t me, who else would it be?” Long Chen might be injured, but he was still calm.

“You’re quite brave! But you won’t be escaping today!” Chen Ming roared. Suddenly, rays of white divine light shot out of the sea, covering this land in a giant heavenly net.

“Faith energy?”

Long Chen was a bit surprised. The island was already destroyed, and yet the faith energy remained. It seemed that their divine pool was beneath the sea.

“Nine Underworld Heaven Merger, Divine Descent!”

Chen Ming formed hand seals, and a giant divine platform appeared behind him. A divine statue then showed up on that platform. It was Liao Bencang.

When Long Chen saw that statue, his expression finally changed. Chen Ming was planning on using the statue to summon Liao Bencang. If Liao Bencang was brought back, then considering that this was his domain, the three of them would really be doomed.

“Old fellow, taste my fist!”

Just then, the void quivered and Guo Ran came charging over, his Supreme Bone quivering as he unleashed a punch.

BOOM!

Chen Ming blocked with his sword. As a result, milky white light erupted and both of them were forced back. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What?!” Guo Ran was shocked. The full-power attack of his Supreme Bone was something that not even half-step Divine Venerates could block. But the late stage World King Chen Ming had blocked it.

“He is Liao Bencang’s follower and can use Liao Bencang’s faith energy. He can bring out more power from a World Domain divine item. Don’t waste time on him! Destroy that statue!” shouted Long Chen.

Xia Chen was already moving before Long Chen finished speaking. Seven talismans shot out at the same time, landing on the statue. Their runes rapidly lit up.

“Explode!”

Xia Chen shouted, and the seven talismans detonated at the same time. The void collapsed. However, Long Chen was shocked to find that the statue wasn’t damaged in the slightest.

“Fools! This faith energy is condensed from countless generations of believers of the Nine Underworld Island. It can only be destroyed with other faith energy. All your efforts are meaningless! Just wait for the palace master to execute you!” shouted Chen Ming furiously.

Just now, Guo Ran’s punch had almost made him cough up blood. All three of them were absolutely terrifying.

“Kill him first then! Maybe when he dies, this statue will disappear!” shouted Long Chen.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran shot after Chen Ming together. Chen Ming’s expression twitched. He suddenly shot straight toward Long Chen. It seemed that he felt that the easier target right now was Long Chen.

“Die!”

As a result, he had just arrived in front of Long Chen when a pretty maiden in a violet dress stabbed a lightning spear toward his head.
