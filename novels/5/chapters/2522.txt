Chapter 2512 Snatching Gold

BOOM! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This attack was particularly strong. As a result, Zhao Ritian’s head was completely deformed and he tumbled back.

The golden giant that Zhao Ritian had turned into crashed through the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps, blasting the ones he touched to dust.

Coincidentally, he was sent blasting in the Dragonblood Legion’s direction. Seeing him flying over made Guo Ran cry out excitedly.

“Brothers, lend me some power!”

Ignoring the fragments of immortal metal, Guo Ran’s armor lit up and he attacked Zhao Ritian himself.

Just as he attacked, the Dragonblood warriors’ armor also lit up, sending energy toward him. Guo Ran’s armor blazed like a sun as his saber fell.

As Zhao Ritian’s golden giant tumbled back, Guo Ran aimed carefully. His saber landed on Zhao Ritian’s neck.

The combined force of all the Dragonblood warriors made this blow unstoppable. Guo Ran’s saber cleanly cut through Zhao Ritian’s neck, sending his head flying.

Guo Ran immediately grabbed the head and tossed it into his astral space, not giving Zhao Ritian any time to take it back.

Guo Ran’s heart almost burst out of his chest in joy. The moment he touched the head, he almost cried out.

Zhao Ritian’s body was money. The immortal metal of this giant had a purity level that was even greater than his sabers. If it weren’t for the combined power of the Dragonblood warriors supporting him, his saber might have shattered on contact with Zhao Ritian’s neck.

The value of this head was immeasurable. Guo Ran felt like he was dreaming.

“Heavens, what a giant gold piece! Brothers, snatch it!” Gu Yang charged over upon seeing Zhao Ritian’s headless corpse.

“Don’t!”

Guo Ran gave a warning, but it was too late.

Dozens of swords slashed into Zhao Ritian’s body, leaving only faint marks. However, those swords shattered.

This golden giant was condensed of Zhao Ritian’s strongest immortal metal, something that even Guo Ran’s weapons couldn’t compare to, let alone the swords in the Dragonblood warriors’ hands.

Gu Yang and the others turned green, aggrieved. The tip of Gu Yang’s spear had broken, and that was his treasure.

“You damn bastards!” Zhao Ritian’s ‘corpse’ suddenly roared and stood back up, punching the Dragonblood warriors.

“Get into formation!” The Dragonblood warriors were startled, not having realized that Zhao Ritian possessed an undying body. Even his head being cut off didn’t kill him.

BOOM!

Having left the main formation, the few hundred Dragonblood warriors that had charged over to Zhao Ritian’s body hastily blocked. Every one of them coughed up blood as they were sent flying.

“You poor ghosts, you can all die!”

Zhao Ritian went insane. He had never encountered an opponent who viewed his body as meat.

Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and the others of their level in the divine families had been busy fighting in other places. Those places were wastelands, and those lifeforms didn’t understand the concept of immortal metal.

Upon returning from that battlefield, Zhao Ritian immediately encountered Long Chen and ended up having Mo Nian profit off of his body.

At that time, there had only been one bandit. Now he had encountered an entire pack of them. With his head cut off and the source metal being stolen, he wasn’t just pained at the loss but also humiliated.

He, a great genius of the divine families, a Sovereign sprout, was actually viewed as bountiful meat by so many people. He was unable to accept this humiliation.

A new head formed on Zhao Ritian’s body, and he charged forward, roaring furiously.

However, he fell after just one step. One of his legs had been bound by countless branches at some point.

“Die!” Upon seeing that it was Chu Yao, he pulled, causing those branches to instantly explode.

Before he could reach Chu Yao, a cold flash descended from the sky, and Zhao Ritian stumbled. His head spun on his neck a few times before falling.

The head was still spinning when Guo Ran grabbed it. He couldn’t wait for it to fall to the ground.

“Wonderful! Little treasure Ritian, I really like you. Make some more heads!” Guo Ran almost started dancing on Zhao Ritian’s neck. That act of his could not be more infuriating.

Yue Zifeng had used his power to cut off Zhao Ritian’s head. However, he clearly turned a bit pale afterward. Using his Sword Qi to split apart such tough immortal metal was extremely taxing.

Just at that moment, more branches burst out of the ground, binding Zhao Ritian’s body. He fell once more, his giant form appearing clumsy.

Suddenly, his body shrank. Against the Dragonblood Legion, this giant form would only be a disadvantage.

Upon shrinking down, the branches were no longer binding him. With a punch, he blasted away the branches in front of him.

“Slut, I’ll make you long for death!”

Zhao Ritian was in the midst of saying some vicious words when a giant door bolt smashed into his head. Wilde smashed him deep into the earth as though he had used a pillar to smash a fly.

The Dragonblood warriors hastily retreated as a wave of earth erupted, but they were still buried.

“You’ve really pissed me off!” Zhao Ritian’s roar came from beneath the earth. The ground suddenly split apart as he summoned his golden giant form once more. He then smashed the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod at the Dragonblood warriors.

Zhao Ritian wasn’t afraid of Wilde, but he was terrified of these bandits who were constantly stealing his immortal metal. That was equivalent to stealing his source energy, and it was a detriment to his combat power.

Although his fight with Wilde had been difficult, with neither side being able to get an advantage, having the Dragonblood Legion have its sights on him was far more uncomfortable. He had to constantly be on guard against them stealing his immortal metal. Such a battle was far too stifling.

“You ignorant thieves, do you know what dignity and honor are? Do you have no sense of honor or shame?!” roared Zhao Ritian.

“You think you can talk about honor and dignity? The four of you joined forces against big brother Yun Tian. Why didn’t you talk about honor and dignity then? Are you even a Sovereign sprout? What right do you have to say such things?” retorted Guo Ran, but even as he said this, he led everyone in retreat.

Branches continued to sprout out of the ground thanks to Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan. Liu Ruyan had also summoned her true form, and through their efforts, Zhao Ritian was unable to effectively unleash any of his power.

Zhao Ritian only had time to curse them once again when Wilde caught up and knocked him to the ground. Guo Ran, who had been hiding amongst the branches, immediately struck, slashing Zhao Ritian’s neck.

However, this time, Zhao Ritian was on guard and blocked with the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod. As a result, Guo Ran was sent flying, coughing up blood. A large nick was left in his saber.

That damage aggrieved him. Once a divine item was damaged like this, it harmed the connection to its runes and seriously affected its power.

However, even though Zhao Ritian had been on guard against Guo Ran, he wasn’t ready for Yue Zifeng. The latter accurately landed his sword on Zhao Ritian’s neck, sending his head flying once more.

The head was immediately grabbed by countless branches and pulled away from Zhao Ritian.

“Hahaha, another one!” Guo Ran charged out and sucked it into his astral space with an excited cry.

Three heads of immortal metal. Added to their previous gains, it was enough to forge a completely new set of armor for the entire Dragonblood Legion.

Guo Ran also had quite a few other ores that he could later purify to increase the quality of this immortal metal.

Thinking of how the Dragonblood warriors could sweep through the Martial Heaven Continent in a new set of armor, Guo Ran was incredibly excited. He had an urge to hug Zhao Ritian and kiss him a few times. This was a wonderful enemy who could make them rich.

Having lost his third head, Zhao Ritian felt like he was going crazy. The worst thing was that after they were lost, the impact on his source energy caused his aura to drop. He was no longer in his peak condition.

He had sucked away all the immortal gold in the ground below this battlefield. Unless he found another place to replenish his energy, he would essentially be burning away his source energy if he continued fighting.

“You lowly bandits, how did Long Chen raise you all into such brigands?!” cursed Zhao Ritian. He surprisingly gave up on attacking the Dragonblood warriors and charged back at Wilde.

He would rather fight Wilde directly than these bandits. He was finally afraid of them. If he wanted to escape this predicament, the first thing to do was knock down Wilde. With him there, he couldn’t do anything to the Dragonblood warriors, and sooner or later all his immortal metal would be stolen.

Zhao Ritian was truly unlucky to have spent a lifetime fighting against people who never even thought about stealing his immortal metal. Upon returning to the divine families, he was viewed as a juicy piece of meat.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion came from the distance. Long Chen came flying out of the darkness, giving up on Ye Ming and charging at the altar.

“You only noticed now? Too late.”

Ye Ming’s voice came from within the darkness. His body slowly appeared, and he was forming several hand seals.

The altar quivered. The dragon corpses forming the altar began to uncoil and roar. Millions of poison dragons were being revived.
