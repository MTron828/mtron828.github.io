Chapter 2636 Restoring the Old Name of Glory

The High Priest indifferently smiled. “It should be congratulations to all parties.”

The High Priest merely spat out a few words as if this had nothing to do with him. It was as if he was just a spectator.

The Lord Venerate turned to Long Chen. “Long Chen, you’ve done a great deed for the Martial Heaven Continent. Who would have thought that the Western Desert Ax was trapped in Devil Spirit Mountain? Now that the laws of the other worlds are fusing with the Martial Heaven Continent’s laws, it won’t be long before the best time to break through to Heaven Merging comes. However, that is the same for our enemies. They will immediately make their breakthroughs when that time comes. Whoever finishes first will have an absolute advantage. Don’t be careless.”

“Many thanks for your warning, Lord Venerate. I understand.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

The Lord Venerate nodded. He said some courteous words to the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the Music Master before leaving with his people.

As they left, two people were glaring at Long Chen enviously. Those two were Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen.

The two of them had been defeated by the Alldevil Heavenwalker within the Martial Heaven Continent, so that was an extraordinary shame for them. Now, right after they had been beaten, Long Chen immediately gave a blow back to the devil race and even managed to snatch the Western Desert Ax from their hold. Their defeat only set off Long Chen’s success.

The two of them were furious, but at the very least, they were comforted by the fact that Long Chen hadn’t encountered the Alldevil Heavenwalker. If Long Chen had managed to fight him evenly without getting defeated or even defeat him, the two of them would need to find somewhere to kill themselves without anyone else seeing.

“Long Chen, don’t be too pleased. Once I advance to Heaven Merging and activate the Spirit Bone, I will awaken supreme divine abilities. You will be trampled beneath my feet.” Ye Liangchen stealthily transmitted a few words to Long Chen as he left. However, Long Chen didn’t even glance at him. It was as if he hadn’t received the message, which angered Ye Liangchen so much that he turned ashen.

The divine families’ people left. But the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts stayed. They were all excited as Long Chen’s power filled them with confidence.

Eventually, since no one was leaving, Qu Jianying was forced to give orders for some people to return to their posts. At the very least, they had to maintain enough forces at the entrances to the Yin Yang World and the Corrupt God Cemetery.

Ye Lingshan and Feng Fei had both activated the alarm of the highest urgency, resulting in everyone thinking that the devil race was launching a large-scale attack. That was why the majority of their battle power had been called over, weakening the other areas.

The High Priest said a few words to Long Chen, telling him to be careful before leaving. After that, Daoist Heavenly Feather and the Music Master also left.

“Old man, you really are badass today. How did you do this?” When there were just a few people left, Long Chen turned to the old man excitedly. This was his first time feeling such worship for the old man. That attack of his had been truly amazing.

“Hahaha, after wasting half a lifetime, how can I not be badass one time? Hahaha!” The old man was even more excited than Long Chen. With the High Priest and the others gone, he finally grew unrestrained.

“You old fool, you’re acting like this in front of children?” scolded Qu Jianying. If it was Long Chen acting like this, then fine. But an old fellow like the old man was also acting without the slightest presence of mind for what it meant to be an expert.

“What’s wrong with it? Men are coarse! Hehe, the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet is finally back! Who can still scare me?” The old man patted his chest heroically.

Qu Jianying originally wanted the old man to reserve himself a bit, but seeing how excited he was, her heart softened. She understood the old man the best. As the sect leader of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, just like his predecessors, he had seen his sect declining for many years. As a matter of fact, consecutive generations of sect leaders were unable to reverse the tide, dying with thoughts of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet in their minds.

Reclaiming the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet had been the dream of generations of experts from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. It was unknown just how many heroes had their bones buried in Devil Spirit Mountain for this goal.

Now, it had finally returned. If Qu Jianying was in his position, she would already be crying from emotion. Hence, she understood the old man’s inner emotions.

Qu Jianying patted the old man’s shoulder, whispering, “That’s right. No one can scare you any longer. You are the strongest.” Qu Jianying had a rare softness to her face now. She seemed to be recalling their youth, and it was like she could see the grand and domineering old man from back then again.

“Congratulations. Starting from today, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s name should be changed. The name of the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect will once more appear on the Martial Heaven Continent. No one will dare to question the name of the world’s number one sect,” said Li Tianxuan.

The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect had originally been called the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect. However, ever since the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet was shattered and half of it was taken away, the sect started to decline.

In the midst of that decline, misfortune suddenly began to befall the sect repeatedly, almost causing its destruction. That generation’s sect leader realized the reason and changed the name of the sect, turning it from the Divine Sect to the Battle Sect.

Although changing the name didn’t restore the glory of the sect, the string of misfortune finally broke.

Later on, everyone else realized that a sect couldn’t be called divine randomly. Without reaching the necessary level, karma would befall a sect.

That was why the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect had been renamed. Now that the divine tablet had been returned, it signified that its name could be changed back.

“That's right. The name of the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect is going to be reinstated. We’ll hold a grand ceremony.” The old man grabbed Long Chen and began to leave.

“Guo Ran, you can rest. Don’t worry about the Alldevil Heavenwalker. He’s in seclusion and won’t come out in a short time,” called out Long Chen as he was dragged away.

From the Horned King’s memories, Long Chen learned that the Alldevil Heavenwalker had entered seclusion after that battle. He was in seclusion at the entrance to the devil world at the bottom of the devil sea.

One reason Long Chen had chosen to sneak over there was to see if he could close the portal to the devil world, but the other reason was to see if he could eliminate the Alldevil Heavenwalker.

However, he didn’t end up encountering the Alldevil Heavenwalker. Instead, he found the Western Desert Ax, and in order to allow people to feel more confident, he didn’t hide this information from them.

“Old man, you really are amazing. How did you do this? You shattered the attack from a ninth Heavenstage Heaven Merging expert and almost injured him. What kind of trick was behind that? Can you teach me? Good things should be shared! Don’t be selfish. It really was amazing. That elder from the devil race almost pissed himself,” said Long Chen as he was dragged by the old man. He was still stunned by how powerful the old man’s attack had been.

“What’s so amazing about it? After that one attack, I used up all my energy. I was just scaring him off. If he had attacked, I would have definitely died,” transmitted the old man.

“Ah?”
