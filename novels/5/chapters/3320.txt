Chapter 3309 Nine Underworld Hall

Bai Xiaole and the others were enraged. This person was intentionally causing trouble and smearing Long Chen’s name.

He was clearly implying that Long Chen was an underworld ghost seed putting on an act. Although he didn’t say it explicitly, his meaning was understood by all.

Looking for the source, they saw a cloaked man deep within the crowd. He had two strange weapons on his back and a hood covering most of his face.

His clothes were skintight, and on the cuffs was a single word embroidered with golden thread.

“Nine Underworld Hunter!”

People’s hearts shook. This person was from the Nine Underworld Hall based on the Underworld character on his cuffs, and it was only when he spoke that people took note of him. Even the people beside him hadn’t noticed him before.

Just how was he able to hide within the crowd like this? It wasn’t that he was actually hiding, but no one could notice him even when he was just standing there.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The people around him immediately distanced themselves from him in a panic. Only once they were further away did they feel a bit safer.

Nine Underworld Hunters were existences that struck terror in people’s hearts. Although the rumors were that they only killed nine star heirs, they always came and vanished without a trace, without leaving even blood. Their killing methods were bizarre.

Nine Underworld Hunters very rarely appeared in the immortal world. Contrary to the Bloodkill Hall, they were more mysterious. It was due to this air of mystery that people felt even more afraid of them.

Long Chen clenched his fists tightly, and his killing intent exploded. He instantly thought of the battle of the Martial Heaven Continent’s destruction. He thought of his seniors and brothers that had sacrificed themselves.

At the same time, a hatred that stemmed from deep within Long Chen’s soul erupted. This person was infected with the blood of the nine star heirs. Long Chen could sense it.

As a fellow nine star heir, he could feel the fury of the nine star heirs that this person had slain. He could hear their unwilling roars in death. Moreover, he even felt vague scenes of their deaths appearing in his mind.

Long Chen’s gaze instantly became frosty, and the auspicious light of the plaza suddenly twisted. At the next moment, the heavens changed color, lightning boomed in the sky, and clouds covered up the sun.

Long Chen’s killing intent had actually invoked a manifestation of the Heavenly Daos. Countless people were shocked by this. They had never seen such a terrifying manifestation.

Those six Immortal Kings were also shocked. Long Chen’s killing intent was too terrifying, to the extent that even the Heavenly Daos were yielding. Such a scene was something that they could not comprehend.

“What? After mentioning your sore spot, you turn hostile and want to kill the speaker?” The Nine Underworld Hunter only smiled faintly in the face of Long Chen’s overflowing killing intent. He spoke so disdainfully as if he didn’t even consider Long Chen to be worthy of entering his gaze.

“It is forbidden to provoke others in front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy!” shouted one of the Immortal Kings.

They could also see that Long Chen had reached the limit of his control, and this fellow was intentionally fanning the flames. As for Bai Shishi, she was clenching her sword hilt, ready to attack at any moment. The moment she clenched it, even the Immortal Kings felt a chill. They had to stop this.

“Dean Long Chen, for you have such accomplishments at such a young age, some unhappy people will naturally try to denounce you. The greater the accomplishments, the more petty people will dislike you. You have to get used to people spreading rumors about you,” said one of the Immortal Kings.

His words were quite well-said. Only mediocre people wouldn’t have anyone jealous of them. So, he not only praised Long Chen but also expressed his support for him. It was clear that he did not believe those rumors.

Regretfully, Long Chen couldn’t even hear his words. All that was in his head was the roars of the nine star heirs that this person had slain.

He didn’t know those nine star heirs personally, but they were fellow nine star heirs. He could feel them being killed. It was the same as if he was dying over and over again. It was infuriating.

“Perhaps this is fate. As a nine star heir, I must carry this burden.”

Long Chen gradually recovered from his rage, and that overwhelming killing intent was also slowly retracted. Seeing that, Bai Shishi and the others also retracted their auras. The Immortal Kings sighed with relief.

Only now did they come to understand just how terrifying Long Chen was. To be given the title of dual champion, it seemed that it was not just all empty talk.

When the killing intent faded, the rainbow light once more covered the plaza. People’s hearts shook. Only now did they realize that Long Chen’s killing intent had eclipsed the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s auspicious light.

It had to be known that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was the faith of the entire Heavenly Rainbow Domain, so this auspicious light contained an unimaginable amount of faith energy. According to reason, it should be impossible to break. But Long Chen’s killing intent had eclipsed it.

“So you’re just trying to scare others? What a dogshit dean. A dog barking at others, backed only by the empty title of its master,” sneered the Nine Underworld Hunter.

Even the Immortal Kings’ expressions changed. This person was truly hateful. However, Long Chen flapped his hand at them, stopping them from doing anything. He said, “He came for me, so I don’t want to trouble seniors.” Turning to the Nine Underworld Hunter, he said, “I just destroyed the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s Bloodkill Hall. I have nothing else to do during this time, so why don’t you tell me where your Nine Underworld Hall is? I’ll go over and we can all get closer.”

Killing a single Nine Underworld Hunter was not enough to extinguish the rage in his heart. He wanted to pull the Nine Underworld Hall out by its roots. He would avenge all those nine star heirs. At this moment, the name of the Nine Underworld Hall had appeared on his list of undying enmities.

“What?!”

Even the Immortal Kings jumped when they heard this. They didn’t dare to believe it. The Bloodkill Hall in their domain had been destroyed?

This plaza was covered by the auspicious light of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, so everyone’s communication talismans lost effect within this area. Since that was the case, the people here were unaware of what happened outside, and a huge uproar erupted when Long Chen mentioned this. People were left questioning whether it was true or not.

“Are you threatening me? Hahaha!” The Nine Underworld Hunter laughed as if he had heard the world’s funniest joke. “Do you think that the Nine Underworld Hall is the same as the trash from the Bloodkill Hall? The Nine Underworld Hunters target nine star heirs. Those are existences whose power shakes the heavens. But they are still prey to us. The Bloodkill Hall’s Bloodkill Order is unable to deal with you, so naturally your head will be taken by the Nine Underworld Hall! As for being an underworld ghost seed, when you die, I’ll see just how you hide yourself at that time!”

The Nine Underworld Hunter suddenly grew transparent and faded just like that. There were no spatial energy fluctuations. This was no transportation; he simply vanished. Seeing this scene, even Immortal Kings felt a chill. This person’s terror far surpassed their expectations.

“God Dao incarnation? Interesting. Good, I’ll add the Nine Underworld Hall to my recipe book.”

Long Chen smiled slightly. There was actually a vaguely excited light deep within his eyes. It seemed that slaughter was what the deepest part of his soul liked.
