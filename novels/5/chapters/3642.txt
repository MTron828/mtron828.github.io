Chapter 3631 Supreme Bone

Nine half-step Divine Venerates self-detonated at the same time. As a result, blood soul energy erupted and the spatial gate crumbled. The runes that made up the spatial gate were demolished.

When the spatial gate vanished, it never reappeared again. At the same time, the nine half-step Divine Venerates that vanished with it were also gone forever.

“Dean, no…” Guo Ran wept. Xue Yifan had blessed him with his favor and had shown him his care. But he had known about it too late.

Other than Long Chen, it was Xue Yifan who cared the most about Guo Ran. He had been constantly secretly looking after and helping him.

However, Xue Yifan was now gone. In order to destroy the spatial gate, such a virtuous and important person was left without even a corpse to bury.

“AHH!”

Guo Ran suddenly let out a beast-like roar. “Brothers, avenge our seniors! Slaughter these brutes!”

“Kill!”

The human race’s warriors echoed his roar. Flames almost burst out of their eyes, and they clenched their teeth so hard that their gums almost bled. The only thing that could cool them down was to kill.

At this time, their lives were the least important thing to them. What they wanted was revenge. If they couldn’t cut off their enemies’ heads, they would probably die of their own rage.

The deaths of the nine seniors fully ignited the fighting spirits of the human race. They became madmen, throwing themselves at the Alldevil race’s experts and the devil beasts.

BOOM!

At this moment, a huge explosion suddenly shook the battlefield. When a giant tear appeared in the void, Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye appeared once more, flying out of that chaotic space.

“You want to save those old fogeys? Keep dreaming.” Alldevil Tianye pointed his staff at Long Chen.

Long Chen’s expression was dark at this moment. The killing intent in his eyes had almost condensed into physical form.

He had to fight at full power against Alldevil Tianye. The latter was too powerful, stronger than any opponent that Long Chen had previously encountered. But Long Chen still kept an eye on the entire battlefield.

When the spatial gate appeared, he immediately had a bad feeling and wanted to go out to destroy it first above anything else.

However, Alldevil Tianye read his intentions. Using some divine ability, he threw space into chaos, stalling Long Chen. When Long Chen finally pierced through his divine ability, it was too late. He couldn’t save Xue Yifan, the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, or the others.

“Boss!”

Seeing Long Chen come out, Guo Ran cried out and couldn’t stop his tears. He felt himself to be completely powerless. He couldn’t do anything.

Long Chen was enraged. Glaring at Alldevil Tianye, he shouted, “I misspoke before. I said that your Alldevil race would have to offer tributes to the human race every year as you survive off of our mercy. But I, Long Chen, hereby swear to all gods and devils to erase the Alldevil race from the nine heavens and ten lands!”

“Erase the Alldevil race from the nine heavens and ten lands!”

“Erase the Alldevil race from the nine heavens and ten lands!”

“Erase the Alldevil race from the nine heavens and ten lands!”

Long Chen’s final words resounded throughout the nine heavens, to the point that the ten thousand Daos resonated with them. It was like an imperial edict spreading throughout the nine heavens and the yellow springs.

This oath caused the world to change color, to cause time, both past and present, to quiver. This was a terrifying oath. All the Alldevil race’s experts felt their hearts pounding as an indescribable fear swept through them.

Long Chen was enraged. He had killed countless lifeforms in this lifetime, but no matter how heinous his enemies had been, no matter how they had enraged him, he had never done something like eradicating an entire race.

He had always believed that every race had both good and bad people. A person had to know respect. He greatly disliked those people who always said that they would wipe out a person’s entire race and family.

However, it was precisely because Long Chen had always left other people a chance to redeem themselves that he ended up pushing himself to the verge of destruction.

If he hadn’t received Aunt Gong’s pointers in the Heavenly Flame World, he would not be able to keep his heart clear. He had given some of the bad people a chance to change their fates. But this ended up causing countless good people to be thrown into danger.

Aunt Gong had told him that he could act according to his own heart, and then bestowed him the golden lily seed, allowing him to place down the burdens in his heart. He didn’t need to keep questioning himself or hyperfocus on the process. He just had to look at the result.

That was why Long Chen had directly given the order to kill the people questioning him. He knew that some people were simply manipulated into doing it. Their innate characters weren’t necessarily bad.

If it was before, he would have given them a chance. But this time, he directly hardened his heart. When did this world ever have so many innocent people? Even if they were innocent, their actions caused others harm. 

It was precisely due to ‘innocent’ people like this that Xia Guhong was forced away. Xia Guhong had been unwilling to subdue these ‘innocent’ people, and that resulted in countless years of battle, in the deaths of countless innocent people.

The current Long Chen could see further than before, and his heart was harder. Even so, Xue Yifan was an elder whom he greatly respected. For him to be unable to save Xue Yifan, the flames of fury in his heart erupted. Because of it, he directly made such a merciless oath.

“Big words! I think I’ll let the Alldevil race exterminate your human race instead!”

Long Chen’s oath caused even Alldevil Tianye’s heart to pound. He furiously roared, “Do you think that this is my full power? You little human, you can never imagine just how powerful the great Alldevil race is! Supreme Bone!”

Suddenly, Alldevil Tianye’s right arm began to shine. After that, the flesh on top of his arm vanished and a black bone appeared. It was covered in tiny, dense runes. Every single rune was as small as an ant, yet they covered his entire arm.

When this black bone appeared, the entire world grew heavy, and a terrifying pressure came from that black bone. Ripples then spread from Alldevil Tianye’s body.

At this moment, Guo Ran and the others felt an irresistible power flow out toward them. It was like they were on a raging sea and couldn’t stop themselves from being forced back. The devil beasts were also pushed back by that terrifying power.

There was no way for anyone else to approach where Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye were. They stared in horror at Alldevil Tianye’s arm. That black bone was like the arm of a fiend clutching their throats. They couldn’t breathe.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

For some unknown reason, when they looked at the current Alldevil Tianye, they couldn’t help feeling like they couldn’t win. It didn’t matter how staunch they were. They felt despair.

“Supreme Bone?”

Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. His gaze instantly sharpened. The immortal world also had experts with Supreme Bones?
