Chapter 4470 Barbarian Dragon Slaughters Saints

POW!

With an explosive sound, Long Chen’s palm solidly landed on the Corrupt Blood Tree Demon’s face. At that moment, even the vigilant Ye Ling was stunned.

The instant Long Chen dodged the wooden spear, he used seven different movement arts, creating afterimages that filled the air. The dazzling display left her unable to tell where he really was.

However, what perplexed her was why Long Chen would go through all the effort to get close to this Saint, only to slap him in the face.

BOOM!

Following that, an even more inexplicable scene occurred. The moment Long Chen’s palm struck the Corrupt Blood Tree Demon’s face, black soil burst out and buried the tree demon Saint.

“AH!”

All of a sudden, a miserable shriek came from that Corrupt Blood Tree Demon. When the black soil landed on him, it resembled boiling water being thrown on snow. Giant holes instantly corroded through him.

The Corrupt Blood Tree Demon roared. With an explosive sound, that black soil flew off, and a figure shot backward like a shooting star.

The black soil had been thrown off, but the Saint’s entire face had sunk in, leaving only half his head intact. His appearance now resembled that of a sinister ghoul.

As he flung off the black soil, the black soil filled the air, blocking everyone’s vision. The other Corrupt Blood Tree Demon was stunned by the state of his comrade.

“What are you looking at?”

Just then, the other Corrupt Blood Tree Demon felt a gust of wind behind his head. A hand then struck him in the back of his head.

More black soil poured out, drowning him as well.

Long Chen had known from the start that if he pulled off his first attack, the first thing the tree demon would do was fling off this black soil.

Thus, he had made a fake that was blasted away along with the black soil to make them think that he was no longer present amongst them. Just as their attention was drawn to the state of that Corrupt Blood Tree Demon, Long Chen used their obstructed vision to slip behind his next target.

“DIE!”

That Corrupt Blood Tree Demon roared and instantly swung his staff behind him.

The wooden staff exploded upon contact with a bronze cauldron, and the tree demon’s arm was broken due to the impact.

His counterattack was also within Long Chen’s expectations. He had long since been holding the Earth Cauldron in wait.

However, what Long Chen hadn’t expected was for the attack of a Saint to be so terrifying. Although the Earth Cauldron managed to block ninety percent of the attack’s power, the shockwaves still struck him, causing him to cough up blood. It felt like his insides were shifting, and he was sent flying.

“Die!”

Seeing the opportunity, the palace master punched the Corrupt Blood Tree Demon. Having just lost an arm, the latter was weakened and could do nothing but let the palace master’s fist blast his head apart.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This turn of events was too shocking. The other Saints had never imagined that a little World King could break the balance of the battlefield.

When the Corrupt Blood Tree Demon’s head exploded, a ray of light shot out of him. That was his soul and his Yuan Spirit.

Even if a Saint’s body was destroyed, as long as their soul was not extinguished, their power could still not be underestimated. His then Yuan Spirit moved toward his manifestation so that they could merge. If that were to happen, he could keep fighting.

However, his Yuan Spirit had just moved when an enormous mouth appeared and devoured him.

“No!” His Yuan Spirit cried out, but it was too late.

The palace master had transformed into a black barbarian dragon, instantly devouring his Yuan Spirit. After that, his aura instantly grew.

“Die!” The palace master’s dragon claw slashed through the air again, locking the space around the other Corrupt Blood Tree Demon. To the surprise of the other Saints, when the palace master consumed the Yuan Spirit, his aura grew explosively, going from the Eternal realm all the way to the half-step Saint realm.

The other Corrupt Blood Tree Demon had his head torn apart by the dragon claws. The palace master opened his mouth, and before his Yuan Spirit could even emerge, he directly bit off his head, devouring the Yuan Spirit.

Explosive rumbling came from the palace master after consuming both those Yuan Spirits. Black qi swirled around him. Black qi swirled around him, and his aura grew increasingly terrifying. It appeared as if he were undergoing some kind of transformation.

Seeing this scene, the other three Saints were terrified. The palace master was on the verge of a breakthrough and was now unrivaled. They could no longer defeat him.

“Run!”

One of those Saints turned to flee, but just as he moved, a sharp claw collapsed on him.

BOOM!

His head exploded, his Yuan Spirit was absorbed by an irresistible force, and his body was tossed aside.

The other two Saints also fled in different directions, and the palace master’s huge dragon form suddenly vanished.

“No!”

“Please- ah!”

Two screams rang out, and two auras disappeared. While holding the Earth Cauldron, Long Chen was completely stunned.

The palace master was actually capable of devouring other people’s Yuan Spirits to increase his realm? What kind of heaven-defying ability was that?

“Long Chen, I’m about to break through, so I must return to the academy immediately. I owe you a favor for this!” shouted the palace master.

Following that, there was an immense explosion near the entrance to the Esoteric Spirit World. Long Chen and Ye Ling hastily rushed back to see that the exit had been torn through, and the palace master was gone.

Ye Ling was stunned. The barrier surrounding the exit was made by the Esoteric Spirit World’s power, something that even over ten Saints working together might struggle to destroy. Yet, the palace master had instantly torn through it. Just how powerful was the palace master?

The five Saints had been killed, and of the seven Doyens, five had died. Numerous budding Doyens had also met their end here. The Esoteric Spirit World’s experts instantly crumbled, rushing desperately toward the open exit.

Anticipating their attempt to escape, Guo Ran had laid a trap for them. Like moths drawn to a flame, they found themselves ensnared in the trap, with no one making it through.

Recognizing the futility of their escape, they started to kneel and beg for mercy. Seeing them pitifully begging for mercy, the Earth Spirit race’s experts cursed them, “I don’t recall you giving our Earth Spirit race a chance to beg for mercy! A blood debt must be paid in blood! You can all die!”

The Earth Spirit race’s experts that had come were their elites, and they had personally witnessed their comrades die beside them. The haunting expressions of their fallen allies would forever be etched in their memories.

All they harbored for these people was hatred; there was no room for pity. Mercilessly, their butcher blades slammed down to settle the blood debt.

The battle continued, but Long Chen wasn’t interested in it, so he started to go through the battlefield.

“Hehe, the body of a Saint must be something good!”

Long Chen’s heart heated up when he saw some treasures.
