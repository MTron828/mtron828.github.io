Chapter 4215 Drawing Stars Into the Body, Thousand Star Fist

Long Aotian’s words shocked countless people. It seemed that to him, killing Xu Yifeng was nothing difficult at all.

It had to be known that the current Xu Yifeng had unleashed immense power. His attack just now was something that even innate Heaven Venerates would avoid.

Although Long Chen had managed to dodge it, that didn’t prove that he had the power to beat Xu Yifeng.

Now, Long Aotian simply appeared and made it sound like killing Xu Yifeng was very easy for him or Long Chen, stunning everyone.

In front of Long Aotian, someone who had stolen his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, Long Chen only wanted to tear apart his corpse into ten thousand pieces.

However, after his hatred reached the limit, he actually became calm. He indifferently said, “He is just a self-important ant. Killing him won’t take too much energy. Thus, if you wish to attack, you can start at any point. You don’t need to worry about him.”

Long Aotian and Long Chen’s words were like a bomb in Xu Yifeng’s ears. He felt like he would explode.

“DIE!”

With a furious roar, his manifestation quivered and he shot at Long Chen like a shooting star. After that, violet qi condensed into a violet domain around him and Long Chen.

Xu Yifeng had summoned a domain so that Long Chen couldn’t dodge, and then he smashed his fist at him.

Although he had a sword hanging on his waist, since Long Chen hadn’t used a weapon, even in his incensed state, his pride did not permit him to draw his blade first.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Drawing stars into the body, Thousand Star Fist!”

A thousand stars lit up within the endless stars behind him. At the same time, people felt the stars above their heads brighten as well. It seemed like the stars above the nine heavens were resonating with him.

Seeing this, the Starry River Sect’s disciples cheered. This was the pinnacle technique of their sect—drawing the power of the stars into their bodies, employing the strength of flesh and blood to harness astral energy.

However, even the most talented amongst them were only able to draw the power of a few dozen stars. Even the strongest was unable to reach the realm of a hundred stars.

In contrast, Long Chen had the capacity to directly tap into the power of a thousand stars. As they gazed upon his arm, they witnessed numerous stars gleaming upon it, coalescing into the starry arm reminiscent of the star diagram they had encountered in their palace.

BOOM!

A fist enveloped in violet qi clashed with a fist radiating the light of a thousand stars. A brilliant white light then erupted in every direction, akin to a sun exploding, blinding people.

Even before everyone’s vision returned, they heard the sound of someone coughing up blood. After that, they saw Xu Yifeng flying back, blood dripping down his mouth.

“How can this be?!”

The Xu family’s experts were left dumbfounded, including their family head. He was well aware of Xu Yifeng’s power. In that state, he was almost unrivaled. However, he continued to face consecutive defeats at the hands of Long Chen.

The Xu family’s people on the martial stage didn’t dare to believe their eyes. In front of them, the unbeatable Xu Yifeng was repeatedly blown back.

Long Chen didn’t chase him and instead looked at his own arm. The stars flowed on top of it with endless power.

“The dragon senior was right. As long as the physical body is strong enough, other divine abilities and Battle Skills can be grasped by reaching out a hand. The foundation of the Starry River of the Sky Art is a powerful physical body. Only when the physical body is strong enough can it contain the power of the stars. With the power of the stars, who could be a match for you?” Long Chen smiled.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s wings flapped, and he vanished without a trace. At that exact moment, Xu Yifeng’s hair stood on end.

His sword then came flying out of its sheath, accompanied by a violet streak of light that cut the void cleanly. Seeing this scene, countless people felt a stinging pain in their souls as if they had been cut as well.

“Eternal divine weapon!”

Startled cries rang out. That was definitely an Eternal sword, and an extremely terrifying one at that. Xu Yifeng was actually capable of using such a weapon.

However, after this attack, Xu Yifeng’s expression changed. He actually missed.

POW!

A hand covered in stars slapped him solidly across the face from a strange angle.

The power of this slap was absolutely vicious. Like a shooting star, Xu Yifeng was sent flying once more toward the Xu family’s camp.

“Dodge!”

Xu Xin-er shouted. But this warning came too late as Xu Yifeng already smashed into their midst. A few conceited experts of the Xu family actually reached out to catch him.

As a result, the moment Xu Yifeng touched them, they exploded. Dozens of the Xu family’s experts died in an instant, and only then did Xu Yifeng manage to stop himself.

When he did manage to stop himself, everyone was shocked to see that other than a very firm handprint on his face, he didn’t seem to be the slightest bit injured.

“How vicious. He used his own family’s people to dissipate boss’s astral energy. The Xu family really does follow their principles. The weak should die,” sneered Gu Yang.

Hearing this, only then did the others understand. No wonder Xu Yifeng wasn’t injured. It seemed that he had found a few scapegoats for himself. No wonder their souls had also been exterminated.

“How vicious. Amongst them were two Supreme heavenly geniuses!” People clicked their tongues. Xu Yifeng was truly a vicious character. He didn’t even let off his own people.

“Endless Violet Qi, Heavenly Sword Slash!”

Xu Yifeng bellowed with rage, raising his sword toward the sky before slashing it downward at Long Chen. He had used those disciples to unload Long Chen’s astral energy and had then seized this opportunity to launch a counterattack.

BOOM!

Just as Xu Yifeng’s sword fell, Long Chen’s expression completely changed. The next moment, his wings flapped and he vanished.

This startled everyone. What had happened? Did Long Chen not dare to receive Xu Yifeng’s attack?

However, their question was quickly answered. A while ago, the barrier on top of the martial stage had started quivering, and now a ray of divine light shot down at the center of the martial stage.

Long Chen and Xu Yifeng were located right there. Fortunately, Long Chen had immediately sensed it and retreated. Anyway, with Xu Yifeng’s will and Spiritual Strength, it was impossible for him to lock Long Chen down. Even his violet qi domain only allowed him to sense Long Chen’s position, not restrict his movements.

As a result, Xu Yifeng was dumbfounded by Long Chen’s retreat. Now that his sword was falling, there was no way to stop it.

Right now, it appeared as if his sword wasn’t slashing at Long Chen. Instead, it was targeting the pillar of divine light shooting out of the formation.

Xu Yifeng almost went crazy. No matter how conceited he was, he would not dare to go against the attack of an ancient formation.

Xu Yifeng suddenly spat out blood. Although he had managed to stop his sword, he had also suffered a fierce backlash. Yet, he paid it no heed and hastily fled the scene.

BOOM!

He had barely moved before that ray of divine light smashed down, instantly enveloping him.
