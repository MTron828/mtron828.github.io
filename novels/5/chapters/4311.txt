Chapter 4300 Violet Blood World

“Uncle Wen!”

When Long Chen saw who it was, he was pleasantly surprised. It was his mother’s older brother.

“Child, you really concealed who you are from us? I know that I’m your uncle now.” Luo Changwen looked at Long Chen with a bitter smile.

“You know?”

“Yes. Father told us everything. Long Chen, you really have done well,” praised Luo Changwen.

Luo Changwen now knew everything, and that was why he was filled with praise for Long Chen.

Previously, he had been very fond of Long Chen, feeling that he had both wits and courage. However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to be his own nephew.

“Is grandfather doing well?” asked Long Chen.

Last time, in the three thousand worlds, Long Chen had helped Luo Zichuan open a spatial path. However, because the three thousand worlds were on the verge of closing down at the time, he had no choice but to leave without knowing what happened next.

“He is doing very well. Most importantly, our Violet Blood race has its own territory now. The Luo family is no longer the old Luo family,” said Luo Changwen excitedly.

“Then the Luo family’s disciples…?”

“They have all been moved. Because we had to do it secretly, we didn’t inform Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the other disciples in the outside world. Father only sent me to find you so that you could all be at ease. However, I didn’t expect that I would also be finding the new Sage King.” Luo Changwen looked at Long Chen admiringly.

Luo Changwen had been hearing all kinds of rumors about the Sage King Convention on his way here, and most of them were about Long Chen.

Countless people had begun to regard Long Chen as a legendary figure. After all, he had single-handedly vanquished the heavenly geniuses of the ten thousand races, crushing them like melons. He had also crushed his mortal enemy in the most domineering and direct method, reclaiming what was rightfully his.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In any case, on Luo Changwen’s way here, as long as the Sage King Convention was mentioned, Long Chen’s name would resound as well. The current Long Chen had become the focal point of the entire human race.

To have such a nephew made Luo Changwen feel proud. He was filled with emotion upon seeing Long Chen.

“Then where is grandfather right now? Eh? Uncle, your cultivation base…”

Only now did Long Chen realize that Luo Changwen’s aura had grown extremely reserved, reaching the level of a Heaven Venerate.

“We are now thriving in the world that our ancestors opened. Within that world resides the totemic spirit of our Violet Blood race, which can awaken our violet blood and let our power soar. Moreover, the ancestors of our Violet Blood race are still alive there, and their power is astounding. We are now working hard on creating a teleportation channel to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. But as your grandfather was worried about things on your end, they all joined forces to send me over to tell you that if you encounter any enemies that you cannot beat, you should hide. Once we open the channel, we will settle things with them,” said Luo Changwen.

Upon hearing that, Long Chen’s heart warmed. His grandfather was always thinking of him.

“Seeing that you’re well is great. However, I also heard that you had offended countless experts during the Sage King Prefecture. You should be more low-key for now. As for the Long clan, once we connect the channel, Father will personally come, and we can settle things with them. We’ll save your father together,” promised Luo Changwen.

Long Chen smiled. “I have already settled things with the Long clan. Uncle, if you had come just a bit earlier, you would have met my father.”

“You’ve already saved him?” Luo Changwen was shocked.

Long Chen gave a simple explanation of how he had gone to the Long clan’s territory. With the palace master’s support, he had forced the Long clan to release Long Zhantian.

Upon learning that Long Zhantian had been saved, Luo Changwen slapped his own leg and cursed himself for not coming fast enough to see his brother-in-law.

“Dad is worried about Mom, so he is in a rush to save her. I trust that it won’t be long before our entire family is reunited,” said Long Chen.

“That’s right, that would be best. Junior sister has been alone all these years… Ugh, let’s not talk about it. It’s all in the past. In the future, things will only get better.” Luo Changwen smiled.

“Uncle, did you only come to find me for this?” asked Long Chen.

“Ah, that’s right, your grandfather was worried about you. He said that your explosive temper could easily overwhelm your intelligence. If your reverse scale is touched, your emotions will affect your decision-making, and it’ll be all too easy for you to suffer as a result. In any case, now the Luo family has the power to protect you, so there’s no need for you to risk your lives for nothing. He wanted me to tell you to wait before doing anything major,” said Luo Changwen.

Hearing this, Long Chen felt a bit embarrassed. His grandfather’s vision really was sharp. He had seen through his character, and his evaluation was almost the same as that of the dragon expert.

“Then does our Luo clan have any half-step Eternal experts?” probed Long Chen.

“Isn’t your grandfather one?” Luo Changwen smiled coyly.

“What?!” Long Chen jumped. But considering that Luo Changwen was capable of becoming a Heaven Venerate, it made sense that his grandfather was even stronger.

“If it weren’t because the primal chaos qi in that minor world was not ample enough, your grandfather would already be breaking through to the Eternal realm. Thus, opening the teleportation channel is a priority. Father simply was too worried about you, so he first sent me to inform you of this. Back when we opened a channel to that world from the Darklight Heaven, it was a simple one-way transportation. However, opening an exit in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven is more complicated. Fortunately, we have many ancestors in our Violet Blood race, so I believe that it won’t be long before the channel opens. After that, when primal chaos qi flows into the Violet Blood World, the disciples in the same generation as you can directly advance to the World King realm,” said Luo Changwen excitedly.

“They still haven’t become World Kings?” asked Long Chen.

“Correct. Father and all the ancestors said that they shouldn’t advance too early. They are to wait for their chance. On the other hand, us old fellows have no restrictions,” said Luo Changwen.

“That’s good.” Long Chen was delighted.

“What?”

As Long Chen waved his hand, thousands of Heavenly Dao Fruits appeared, stunning Luo Changwen.

“This is…” Luo Changwen was at a loss for words. He didn’t dare to believe what he was seeing.

He knew that Long Chen’s Heavenly Dao Fruits were priceless heaven-defying treasures, and he also knew about their nature. Hence, seeing the three-colored marks on them, he knew what they represented. He also wanted to become a Triple Supreme.

“Uncle, I won’t keep you here for too long. Bring these fruits back to the Luo clan for the brothers and sisters in the Violet Blood World. If they consume them now, it will align perfectly with the eruption of primal chaos qi. After that, when the laws of the Heavenly Daos are complete, the Luo family’s heavenly geniuses will also rise to a new level!” exclaimed Long Chen excitedly.

Long Chen had absolute trust in the Luo family, and now he didn’t need to worry about how to deal with his other Heavenly Dao Fruits. After all, these items that couldn’t see the light of day couldn’t just be given to anyone.

However, it was no problem to give them to the Luo family. The Luo family was part of the Violet Blood race, so with the violet blood as a foundation, they were capable of controlling all elements within the ten thousand Daos. These Heavenly Dao Fruits would definitely not harm them.

“Alright, I’ll go back right now!”

Luo Changwen was also excited, as he knew just what these Heavenly Dao Fruits represented. The Luo family’s disciples were about to soar. These Heavenly Dao Fruits would completely change the fates of the Luo family’s new generation, as well as the fate of the entire Luo family!

Following that, Luo Changwen carefully put them away. After imploring Long Chen to be careful once more and wait for the Luo family to open a channel to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, he left.

Once Luo Changwen left, Long Chen had one less thing to worry about. The Heavenly Dao Fruits were like hot potatoes, and he had managed to deal with them. Thus, he went into seclusion, preparing to undergo a brazen cultivation method according to the dragon expert’s idea.

Within a secret room, Long Chen held a pinkie-sized divine bone and pressed it against his chest.
