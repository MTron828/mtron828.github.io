Chapter 4219: What Long Chen was Waiting For

Seeing several furtive figures sneaking into the flood of dark creatures, Long Chen instantly had a bad feeling. He noticed that these figures were able to slip through the ranks of dark creatures without being attacked. It was as if the dark creatures didn’t even sense them.

Guo Ran immediately took out his crossbow. The next moment, a golden streak of light accurately struck one of them in the head.

That figure exploded, unleashing a wave of powerful devil qi. This was clearly an expert of the devil race.

Guo Ran repeatedly shot, unleashing golden arrows that accurately killed his targets.

However, Long Chen’s expression quickly changed as he sensed that there weren't only experts from the devil race; there were also members of the demonic beast race.

BOOM!

Another expert was accurately killed. However, before dying, they tossed out an object, a sphere that exploded in the air.

The next moment, a strange liquid flew through the air, and a disgusting stench rose.

In response, countless dark creatures seemed to be provoked. They roared and charged toward this smell.

“How sinister!” Guo Ran and the others were enraged. These malicious fellows actually found a way to draw the dark creatures to the human race’s side. They were trying to get Long Chen and the others killed.

Realizing that they couldn’t charge through the horde of dark creatures, they directly tossed the burden onto Long Chen’s side. More of those spheres exploded around them.

These hateful fellows had originally been hoping to toss the spheres amidst Long Chen’s companions, but now that they were noticed, they directly detonated the spheres once they were nearby.

With this, countless dark creatures were stimulated and attracted to this region. Even though this liquid wasn’t splashed directly on them, the effect was still quite potent.

The dark creatures on the martial stage seemed to go insane, charging at Long Chen’s side. As a result, quite a few weak disciples were terrified, their eyes full of despair.

“It’s over! We’re really doomed now!” A painful cry rang out. In all their lives, they had never seen such a terrifying thing before.

As for the human experts outside the martial stage, they were enraged but powerless to do anything. They could only watch.

What pleased them was the division within the human race's ranks, with Long Chen's group representing just ten percent of the human disciples. It was evident that these hateful fellows only targeted Long Chen and not the entire human race.

“Boss, should we start the counterattack?” asked Guo Ran.

“Wait a bit, there’s no rush. We will proceed with the original plan,” declared Long Chen. He coldly looked at those lifeforms that had thrown the spheres but refrained from killing them.

As countless dark creatures charged toward them, everyone on Long Chen’s side had to join the fight now, but there were just too many dark creatures. Their defensive line continuously shrank.

These dark creatures had gone crazy, ignoring all the others on the martial stage and relentlessly charging at Long Chen. Since the other races were under no pressure at all, they became nothing more than spectators.

As for the human experts, they watched as Long Chen and the others were besieged. Some even smiled, delighting in their misfortune.

“When the heavens go mad, there is a storm. When humans go mad, there is a tribulation. Long Chen, aren’t you very strong? Why are you cowering like a turtle now?” shouted someone.

“Maybe he’s so delusional that he’s thinking about conserving his power for the title of Sage King. Doesn’t that mean that he’s sacrificing all his subordinates?” sneered another.

“Ah, I see, so you keep those weaklings around to use them as sacrificial pawns! Haha, not bad, not bad!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“What trash. He acted so sanctimoniously, as if he was the savior of the world. What a disgusting man.”

Countless sneers rang out from the ranks of the human race. However, those people were all hidden, only speaking and not letting people know who they were.

“Shut up! You’re the trash! Everyone saw what kind of person Long Chen is very clearly. On the other hand, you’re hiding in the crowd, shamelessly spewing venom. What right do you have to criticize others?!”

Finally, someone amongst the human race spoke up for Long Chen.

“You idiots, the devil race, Blood race, and demonic beast race are trying to harm Long Chen. Anyone with eyes can see it, yet you sneer at him instead of helping? Are you even human?”

“That’s right, you’re all shameful trash. If you have guts, show yourselves! Let us know which faction you are from! What? You don’t dare? You must be afraid of Long Chen taking revenge on you. What useless trolls.”

“When Long Chen is besieged, can we really just watch? This is clearly a scheme. They’re trying to break us up piece by piece! If Long Chen and the others die, I guarantee that we’ll be next! Are you just going to watch?”

“That’s right, we’re all part of the human race. We should be united against our enemies, not watching as our fellow humans are killed one by one. If we all die, the human race will lose a portion of its power. Do you not know that people are only strong when they are together?”

“Hehe, nice words, but what do their deaths have to do with us? If Long Chen takes the title of Sage King, will he share the karmic luck with me? Anyone can say dignified words, but on the martial path, everyone is a competitor, whether it is fellow humans or other races. When it comes to the Sage King Convention, other than myself, everyone else is an enemy. You want to save them? Are you joking?” said someone disdainfully.

“You…! Fine, I can’t outreason you. But I know that I am human, and the human race should help and support each other. Even if we are to compete with each other, there is a bottom line. Everyone wants to become the Sage King, but I won’t throw away my bottom line for this title, especially not when we are surrounded by enemies. Just look at those devils and beasts. Do you know how many humans their ancestors have slain? Have you forgotten about the sea of blood between us? Has the title of Sage King blinded you to this enmity? Are you really human? If you aren’t going, then I will!”

Suddenly, one of the human experts really did fly toward Long Chen’s camp, stunning countless people.

“I’m coming too.”

Following that, a second person, a third, a fourth… A hundred… a thousand… ten thousand…

Countless experts formed a stream rushing to where Long Chen was.

“Brothers of the human race, don’t worry. We will support you!”

Seeing these people come to aid them, Yu Qingxuan smiled slightly. She then looked at Long Chen tenderly.

“What you were waiting for was them, right?”

Long Chen also smiled, feeling moved. “I’ve always said that the human race still has hope.”

Long Chen subconsciously clenched his fists. His blood began to heat up.
