Chapter 3605

Following Long Chen’s orders, those red-eyed starry river warriors carried out their heart’s desire, continuing to crazily chase down those traitors.

As a result, this battlefield became a slaughter ground. Just over three hundred experts hunted down tens of thousands of black-armored experts.

“No! You can’t do this to us! We’ve already surrendered!”

“If you do this, you aren’t in the right either! If you don’t allow surrender, you’ll only force more people to fight to the death against you!”

“If you kill us, what will happen to the people’s hearts? You’ll isolate yourselves! This is wrong!”

Long Chen’s execution order caused those black-armored experts to cry out in terror.

At this time, several of the college’s Elders came over to Long Chen and Guo Ran. One of them said, “Dean Guo Ran, since they’ve already surrendered, we should accept it. Otherwise, we’ll have no moral standing ground either. Other than that, this will push the traitors to fight to the death. In any case, they’re going to be dead, so they’ll do everything they can to drag us down with them. We’ll take greater losses in future battles. But by accepting their surrender, we’ll gain intel on the enemy as well as some new combat forces. Dean Guo Ran, you can consider it.”

These Elders had come to record the battle. That was their responsibility. For example, the process of the fighting, the numbers on both sides, and the strategies employed would all be recorded.

This was a very important matter. Through this record, people could learn the details of the battle and gain experience. They could draw on the experiences of the victor and the losers. They could know who contributed to the victory and who caused the defeat.

Naturally, this record was written by the elders of the college with the highest virtue and prestige. They didn’t have any combat power, and their longevity had essentially reached an end. However, they were still using the final glimmer of their life to do a bit of work for the college.

If they lost this battle, they would be slaughtered with everyone. But they weren’t afraid. For them, dying on the battlefield was the best end that they could ask for.

These elders were also quite stubborn, and they would definitely record the battle in an impartial way, not intentionally making one side look better or worse. They actually possessed quite the temper.

Since they only came to give a reminder, they were using a polite tone. They were definitely giving face to Guo Ran.

“Seniors, I know that you are warning me with good intentions because you don’t want me to carry this infamy. But my boss has given the order not to keep prisoners. Then he must have his own reasons. I might not know them, but I won’t question him. I will listen to my boss. As for what you record, I feel like you should record whatever you feel is correct. There’s no need for the ‘college’s desire to produce a hero’ to affect your work. All I know is that my boss is definitely not wrong, so please write down your record as you would,” said Guo Ran.

Guo Ran was also very courteous to these upright people. There weren’t that many upright people left in this world.

“Then mister Long Chen, this old man simply wishes to have an accurate record. I am not qualified to question your actions. But do your current actions have some deeper meaning? Can you explain it a bit to this old man for the record?” asked that Elder while turning to Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head. “There is no deeper meaning to it. Traitors must pay the price for their actions.”

“Perhaps they were simply unable to think clearly for a moment. Now that they have repented, is it not possible to give them a chance to wipe the slate clean and act properly?” asked the elder.

“Wipe the slate clean? Do we have the power to give them that chance? Could you forgive them in the place of the souls that they killed?” Long Chen looked at that elder coldly.

“Well…” The elder sank into thought for a moment. “After they surrender, they can make up for it with some contributions. The dead are already dead. Even if you kill them, the dead will not come back to life. But those that are still alive can have better odds of surviving. By accepting these traitors, you can turn them into our own combat power and strengthen our forces. That will lessen our casualties. At the same time, we are leaving a path for the other traitors, making it so that they won’t go all-out against us. It will affect their unity. Anyway, there will be more and more traitors over time. What is in the past is in the past. We should look into the future instead of-”

“Bullshit!” Long Chen shouted.

“Why are you cursing?!” demanded the elders angrily.

“I curse you for being idiots. I have the urge to kill you right now. To actually try to delude people with an army right in front of us, if it was in my Dragonblood Legion, people like you would be immediately executed. You are so foolish and you don’t even know it. Now, you want to be a good person advising others. But people like you cause the greatest harm. The damage that you cause to the human race is even greater than those traitors. One rotten good person really is more evil than ten bad people!” raged Long Chen.

“You… you… you better explain yourself! How are we rotten good people?!” demanded the elders furiously.

“Ever since ancient times, compassion was never able to command troops. Just how many good people have your so-called good intentions killed? How do you know that after they surrender, they’ll join forces with us? They betrayed us once, so why can’t they betray us a second time? How do you know that they won’t stab us in the back? Since they’ve betrayed the human race and can raise their blades against us, they are no longer humans. Whether they were pressured or enticed, it doesn’t matter. A wrong is a wrong. Every person must bear the responsibility for their mistakes. If I accept their surrender, I am leaving a path for those traitors to live. I am also leaving a path for the humans who are still wavering about what side to join. Then even if they betray us, who cares? They can just surrender when the time comes! They’ll only be cursed a bit, but they won’t die, right? Then the cost of betrayal will be cheapened. Why don’t you tell me just how many people in the human race are currently opportunists waiting to see how the wind blows? How many are waiting to jump to whatever ship they think is safest? What kind of effect will this have on the human race? How will the human race unite everyone’s heart against the Alldevil race like that?” Long Chen pointed and cursed at the elder.

“Well…” The elder was instantly speechless.

“Well what?! You don’t know shit, so don’t blindly fart! You are so foolish that there’s no saving you, so don’t implicate others. If you cause the destruction of the human race because of your influence, can you old fellows bear the responsibility? You think that because you’re old and have seen more, you can criticize others and give them pointers? You’re only here to record the battle. Tell me, if it was instead your history that was recorded, how would people judge and criticize you?” demanded Long Chen icily.

Those old fellows were instantly ashamed. They were using their own experience to advise Guo Ran, but they hadn’t expected there to be such grave consequences of their advice.

Although Long Chen was cursing them, they had no choice but to admit that his words were correct. They could not retort.

“Starting now, anyone who questions my orders is to scram. If they don’t scram, then they are to be executed,” said Long Chen coldly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Just then, the spatial gates rumbled. They suddenly widened and giant battleships came flying out of them. When Guo Ran saw the battleship at the front, he couldn’t help sucking in a cold gasp of air.

“Boss, not good! It’s the Luo clan’s Qingying Battleship!”
