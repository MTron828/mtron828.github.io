Chapter 3098 Catching One

Bai Shishi still had a single hand out. However, her hand had now turned golden as if it was made of pure gold.

The bone blade was caught solidly in her hand. With her golden dress fluttered around her, she was like a golden goddess, sacred and touchable.

As for Lu Xiaoxian, the veins on his arms throbbed as he tried to pull back his blade, but it was ineffective. After that, the Dark Tiger’s roar came from within his manifestation, shaking the sky. The martial stage shuddered and seemed on the verge of collapse.

Yet, no matter what he did, that bone blade seemed to have been stuck to Bai Shishi’s hand, and he couldn’t even shake it.

Suddenly, Bai Shishi’s hand flashed and golden liquid flowed out of her palm. The bone blade was slowly encased, turning golden.

“You…!”

Lu Xiaoxian was shocked. He then hastily let go of his blade and retreated.

He had only just retreated when the golden liquid covered the entire blade. It then dissolved, the bone blade vanishing just like that.

As a result, Lu Xiaoxian coughed up a mouthful of blood. That bone blade was connected to his soul, so its destruction also injured him.

He was infuriated. That bone blade was extremely important to him. All of a sudden, his arms shook, and two black tiger heads appeared on his fists. Black qi then erupted out of him like a flame devouring the heavens.

“Don’t force me to kill you.” Bai Shishi simply stood there. It looked as if golden lava was flowing out of the ground beneath her. However, her gaze was completely apathetic.

Lu Xiaoxian seemed to be accumulating power for an even more terrifying attack. However, when Bai Shishi said this, his expression once more changed.

In that instant, a dense feeling of death filled him. He could already smell death. That feeling was incredibly intense.

For a moment, he didn’t dare to move nor continue unleashing his power. But he was also unwilling to simply stop here.

Seeing him caught in such an awkward state, Long Chen shook his head. “This fellow still doesn’t understand Bai Shishi’s meaning. There’s a problem with his head.”

Bai Shishi had destroyed his bone blade as a warning. If she had only forced him back, he would definitely continue fighting. But by destroying the bone blade, she hoped for him to realize the difference in power and give up. This was only the third round of this stage, and Bai Shishi didn’t want to show off her power.

However, if Lu Xiaoxian still didn’t retreat, then Bai Shishi would be forced to kill him with one of her trump cards, slaying him in the simplest, most explosive method so that he was dead in an instant.

A person’s trump cards were extremely important in the Nine Prefecture Convention. Once they were exposed, the other side would be prepared, and the trump cards would be less effective.

Now, Bai Shishi looked at Lu Xiaoxian, and Lu Xiaoxian looked back at Bai Shishi. A vein throbbed on his forehead as hesitation filled his eyes.

He was no fool. He knew what Bai Shishi was saying. If Bai Shishi was forced to reveal a trump card because of him, she would make sure he was dead.

Fight? He had no confidence. The sense of danger that Bai Shishi gave him was too strong.

Give up? He was unwilling. Although he had lost his bone blade, he had many more powerful moves that he had yet to use. Perhaps there was a chance of victory?

He was caught in a difficult situation. With countless experts watching, if he simply retreated like this, he would be turned into a laughingstock.

Seconds passed and then minutes. Bai Shishi gradually lost her patience. At this moment, she formed one-handed seals, and a diagram appeared beneath her feet.

When that diagram appeared, Lu Xiaoxian’s expression changed. He then coldly said, “Whatever, I only have a grudge with Long Chen. I’ll let you off this time. Go back and tell Long Chen that I will take his head.”

After saying that, he directly admitted defeat and was sent out of the martial stage, causing an uproar.

“No way, he really admitted defeat?!”

“That’s the number one expert of the Dark Tiger Alliance! A Primal! He admitted defeat just like that?”

“What is wrong with him? How can he just admit defeat on this kind of stage?”

Countless people cursed him, because the clash between Bai Shishi and Lu Xiaoxian was the first fight in the Nine Prefecture Convention between two supreme experts.

One was the Dark Tiger Alliance’s number one expert, and the other was the High Firmament Academy’s number one expert. The audience had all been full of expectation for a world-shaking fight. Instead, they got a fight that had a strong start but a weak finish.

However, some of them saw the truth. They had all seen Lu Xiaoxian’s struggles. When Bai Shishi’s diagram appeared, he directly admitted defeat. That was very curious.

“It’s too bad. That diagram only appeared for an instant. Who knows what happened?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As countless people cursed and guessed, Bai Shishi returned to her spot. Lu Mingxuan, Luo Xue, and the others all congratulated her.

As for the High Firmament Academy’s disciples on the stands, they let out heaven-shaking cheers. With just one move, Bai Shishi scared off the Dark Tiger Alliance’s number one expert and made him admit defeat. That was glorious.

Bai Shishi had managed to scare off her opponent. But in the next two battles, Luo Bing and Luo Ning regretfully lost to their opponents.

Although their opponents weren’t Primals, they were truly powerful. Even after unleashing all their power, the two of them were still defeated. They were simply outmatched, and there was nothing to be done about it.

Luo Ning was a bit upset at her defeat, but fortunately, Luo Bing was good at comforting her. With their power, just being able to get to this spot was lucky.

Luo Xue and Luo Qing also faced very powerful opponents, but the two of them were supreme experts sent by the Luo family specifically to counter the four from the Chu family. They didn’t encounter Primals, and so they easily defeated their opponents.

Mu Qingyun also won her fight, but it was a narrow victory. If it wasn’t for the fact that her opponent didn’t dare to take the risk in a direct exchange, Mu Qingyun would have been the one to lose. In terms of power, the other side was clearly above her.

Mu Qingyun ended up having to pay quite the price to win. She had used up a great deal of her energy, so she probably wouldn’t be able to continue fighting.

As for Long Chen, his opponent was powerful. Long Chen received ten of his strongest attacks. Seeing Long Chen only defend and not attack, his opponent realized just how big the difference in power was, as he was unable to even shake Long Chen. Knowing that Long Chen had been merciful, he admitted defeat after ten moves.

The third round ended there. Other than Luo Bing and Luo Ning, everyone managed to pass to the next round.

After one hour of rest, the lots were rolled once more. This time, when Long Chen saw his opponent, a gratified smile appeared on his face. The name written on his tablet was Chu Gan.

“Hehe, I’ve caught one.” Long Chen smiled. He had been waiting a long time.
