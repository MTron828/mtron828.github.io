Chapter 4697 Sovereign Emperor Heaven

A deafening rumble echoed from the other side of the gate, accompanied by the sudden eruption of blood, resembling tiny blossoms in bloom.

Soon after, screams and curses pierced the air, followed by a frantic panic as the crowd on the other side vanished in chaos. No one knew how many people were killed or simply sent flying by the attack. All Long Chen and the others could see was chaos.

Long Chen withdrew Evilmoon, and the cut on the gate immediately healed. While Long Chen’s attack may have reached the experts on the other side, it was unable to damage the gate to the ninth heaven.

“Don’t waste your time. Prepare yourself. I’m going to send you a gift.” Suddenly, the Earth Cauldron spoke.

Before Long Chen could even prepare himself, the Earth Cauldron already appeared above his head. As soon as it materialized, Long Chen had a bad feeling. As expected, the moment the Earth Cauldron appeared, space twisted, and a giant blood-colored net appeared.

Long Chen was startled. This was too sudden, wasn’t it? It told him to prepare but gave him no time to do so. Long Chen was about to use his Purgatory Eyes when Evilmoon cried out in delight.

“You had something this good for me?!”

Dragonbone Evilmoon instantly leaped out of Long Chen’s hand and thrust itself into the net. When the net sensed Evilmoon, it seemed terrified.

However, before it could flee, Evilmoon’s blade sank into it, its sharp teeth digging into the net to prevent it from escaping.

After that, smoke started to come out of the net as it slowly melted, and ultimately, it was absorbed by Evilmoon.

After absorbing the Emperor Blood Silk Net, a net-like pattern appeared on top of Evilmoon, and its aura grew even more frightening. It laughed and thanked the Earth Cauldron.

“Hahaha, not bad, not bad. For a broken little cauldron, you’re pretty good. I’ll remember this favor.”

The Earth Cauldron didn’t get angry at what Evilmoon called it. Instead, it asked, “Do you recognize me?”

“Nope!” Dragonbone Evilmoon was baffled.

“Then it’s fine.”

After saying that, the Earth Cauldron directly returned to Long Chen’s spiritual space.

“Hmph, how stupid.” Evilmoon was somewhat speechless, but even after it thought about this carefully, it could not recall ever meeting this bronze cauldron before.

Meanwhile, Long Chen was shocked by the Earth Cauldron’s actions. It seemed to know Evilmoon. Was there some secret between them?

In response to the renewed shouts and curses, Long Chen swiftly drove Evilmoon into the gate once more.

Instantly, the angry outcries transformed into sharp screams once again. Long Chen hadn’t even attacked, but the people on the other side had already fled for their lives. Soon, silence descended once more.

“Evilmoon, can we really not break this gate?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking.

“I can’t say for sure. You should ask that cauldron,” said Evilmoon.

Before Long Chen could even ask, the Earth Cauldron said, “This gate is a sacrificial gate, and all that nonsense about being the chosen son of the ninth heaven is a lie. For you to have killed so many people and still not manage to open the gate, it appears the sacrifices are still insufficient. My guess is that both sides have been deceived. Unless the other side also has a huge amount of sacrifice prepared, this gate will remain closed for the time being. However, the gate has been activated. Based on what I see, if there is no interference, it will open one to three months from now. When this gate opens, the ninth heaven will be connected to your world.”

“So, this gate really does lead to the ninth heaven?” asked Long Chen, still grappling with the concept.

When it came to matters concerning the gate to the ninth heaven, its pathway, and the world beyond, Long Chen was still completely baffled. He knew nothing about them.

“Behind this gate is the ninth heaven, the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. It is the strongest plane of the nine heavens,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen’s heart shook, so on the other side was the ultimate world of the nine heavens. “Wait, no, that doesn’t make sense. If they’re the ultimate world, they must have the best resources inside. Shouldn’t they be afraid of us entering and taking their resources? Why would they want to open the gate as well?”

Long Chen was unable to comprehend this. The experts on the other side of the gate had been keen to open the gate urgently.

“Because the nine heavens are one, even the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, the ultimate plane, is not complete without being linked to the other eight heavens. When the nine heavens are connected with each other, the laws that the Sovereign Emperor Heaven is missing will be filled, and the Sovereign Emperor Heaven that has been lying in wait for millions and millions of years will undergo a nirvanic rebirth. Its environment will very likely be able to match the primal chaos era,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

“The primal chaos era?!” Long Chen was fully stunned.

“However, it will just be for a short time. Perhaps it will last a few centuries or maybe even less. Thus, everyone inside is anticipating the opening of the gate more than anyone. Moreover, the experts inside also have a pressing problem they need to deal with. Because the Sovereign Emperor Heaven is the most perfectly preserved heaven, after the battle of the primal chaos era, countless primal chaos races remain inside, including fiends and devils from beyond the heavens. Thus, the lifeforms inside also don’t have it easy. They are bitterly hanging onto survival, trying to prevent their entire race from being exterminated. When the gate opens, the lifeforms of the other heavens will be able to enter the Sovereign Emperor Heaven and return to their ancestral homes. The experts there also need some fresh blood. There might be a lot of resources inside, but there are constant battles as well. The constant battles resulted in significant casualties, hindering their growth. That’s why they wish for all of you to enter the ninth heaven as well,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing that, Long Chen understood. So the battle in the primal chaos era had resulted in the Sovereign Heaven Continent becoming a wild land where even the strongest factions were barely able to survive. The weaker factions had to become subordinates to the major factions or simply fight to the death in the cracks of the world.

No wonder those people on the other side of the gate wanted to open the gate so urgently. It seemed that they really needed some reinforcements.

“Tch, they acted so arrogant. I thought that they were actually strong. What idiots.” After realizing this, Long Chen sneered, thinking of their arrogant words just before. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen suddenly thought of something and asked, “Senior, my companions, what is going on with them? How did they help me?”
