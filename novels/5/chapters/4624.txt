Chapter 4613 Three Priceless Treasures

“Who is that?!” asked Yu Qingxuan.

Yu Qingxuan was startled. Just from that voice, she could sense explosive flame energy, as well as the tone of the Nirvana Scripture.

“It’s Lord Brahma’s disciple,” Long Chen answered, his voice laced with a simmering fury. “If my suspicions are right, he must be after this place. The temple was sealed by Lord Brahma himself, serving as bait to lure unsuspecting outsiders. With his seal in place, anyone who touched it would be like a fish caught in a net.” 

Now he knew why he had felt something calling to him here. Had he not found the skeleton and obtained the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid, he wouldn’t have been able to break Lord Brahma’s seal.

Although Long Chen didn’t know the exact details, he knew there was some powerful karma at play, guiding him right to this place.

The outer barrier bore Lord Brahma’s seal, imbued with his will. Long Chen had firsthand experience of its overwhelming power when he rescued Yu Qingxuan; its force was insurmountable. At his current level, breaking through it was impossible.

As Lord Brahma’s disciple, this white-robed man was very likely here to undergo some trial, but he was in no rush to get here, knowing that no one else could break the seal.

That was why he only had medicine slaves guarding this place, patiently awaiting unsuspecting prey to fall into his trap. Meanwhile, he busied himself hunting the surrounding beasts for their medicinal ingredients, all while contemplating how to track down Long Chen.

However, he had never dreamed that Long Chen would come to the temple and even manage to break into the hall.

“What should we do?” asked Yu Qingxuan. The hall was collapsing, and it wouldn’t be long before it completely caved in. With Lord Brahma’s barrier in place and the white-robed man outside, both of them were essentially trapped here.

Just then, the statue disintegrated, along with the golden lotus throne. Just as the throne collapsed, a golden sacred light illuminated the hall.

“This is…!”

Long Chen stared in disbelief at a golden lotus seed.

At the same time, the golden lotus seed in the primal chaos space quivered and flew out on its own accord.

Buzz.

The two golden lotus seeds merged, their union giving rise to a new seed that flickered between solid and illusory. Around this enigmatic seed, countless scripture characters materialized, intertwining to form intricate chains.

“It’s the Nirvana Scripture!”

The chains seemed to be made of the Nirvana Scripture’s characters.

Suddenly, the golden lotus seed vanished and reappeared in the primal chaos space, shining like a blazing sun inside. In an instant, the entire primal chaos space brimmed with life, and Long Chen even sensed the air of laws appearing in the primal chaos space. It seemed to have its own laws now.

BOOM!

As Long Chen’s golden lotus seed absorbed the golden lotus seed within the lotus throne, the entire hall disintegrated and collapsed instantaneously.

“DIE!”

At this time, space itself contorted and twisted, revealing the white-robed man, whose face twisted with fury. He lunged at Long Chen with such animosity that it seemed as if Long Chen had desecrated his ancestral tomb.

“I’ll smash your dog head today!” Long Chen’s own fury ignited upon seeing the white-robed man. Scales covered him as he summoned his divine ring. His starry sea quivered, resounding with the roar of a dragon that shook the heavens. With all his might, he unleashed a devastating punch.

BOOM!

Both Long Chen and the white-haired man grunted and fell back.

“How dare you destroy my trial?! You even stole my treasures! You shameless thieves! Go to hell!”

The white-robed man’s face twisted even further when he saw that the statue and the lotus throne had vanished. Swiftly, he formed hand seals and started to chant. The next moment, the entire hall vanished, and Long Chen found himself back in the outside world, encased within a translucent barrier bound by innumerable flame chains. He was trapped, akin to a bird in a cage.

Through the cracks, Long Chen could see that even the ruins of the temple had disintegrated into dust.

It seemed that once he took the golden lotus seed, this world was no longer able to stop the onslaught of time and finally broke down.

Suddenly, the space within the barrier twisted, condensing into flame arrows. Long Chen’s soul quivered. Without hesitation, he summoned lightning wings upon his back and lunged toward the white-robed man.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

As a dragon cry resonated through the air, a giant dragon claw stretched out of Long Chen’s divine ring.

When the dragon claw was about to reach the white-robed man, a pair of giant hands appeared in front of the white-robed man, blocking Long Chen’s attack.

“What?!”

These two translucent hands radiated with swirling runes.  A sacred and majestic aura then filled the air, as if a god had descended.

“It’s Lord Brahma’s power!”

“You damn little ant! My master left me three priceless treasures in this trial! The first one was his Brahma divine power, the second one was the original Nirvana Scripture, and the last one was that golden lotus seed!” The white-robed man spat out his words through the gap between his teeth.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“So that’s the case. I already took two of the priceless treasures. Brahma’s power is worthless to me, so I’m happy with what I have.” Long Chen snickered. Seeing the white-robed man’s furious expression, he felt unspeakably refreshed.

At the same time, he was probing the outer barrier. If he couldn’t break it, he and Yu Qingxuan would truly be in danger.

The Jewel Blood Jade Orchid had vanished after sending him in. If he wanted to leave, he would have to rely on himself.

This barrier consisted of Lord Brahma’s power, so only the white-robed man, as Lord Brahma’s disciple, was capable of freely coming and going. If Long Chen wanted to leave, he would have to think of something.

“Hand over the golden lotus seed, otherwise…”

The white-robed man suddenly turned to Yu Qingxuan, a lecherous smile appearing on his face.

“Fuck your mother!”

Long Chen’s killing intent surged uncontrollably before the white-robed man could utter another word. Swift as lightning, Long Chen materialized in front of him and delivered a vicious slap across his face.

The white-robed man never anticipated that Long Chen’s attack would surpass the speed of his protective divine light. Long Chen’s slap shattered half of his face, sending blood splattering through the air.

“Today, I'll show you the true meaning of death!” Long Chen bellowed, his voice resonating with raw fury as he launched himself at the white-robed man like a madman.
