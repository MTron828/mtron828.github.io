Chapter 4776 Six Forms In One

When a majestic dragon cry resounded throughout heaven and earth, blood-colored scales covered Long Chen, and a blood-colored cloak appeared behind him.

As the cloak fluttered in the wind, it felt like a piece of the very world—every time it moved, the world shook with it.

Long Chen’s Blood Qi overflowed. A giant dragon then appeared within his divine ring, but even the enormous divine ring could only display a few scales of this dragon, not its entire body.

The next moment, a majestic pillar of light soared out of him, blasting away the clouds and tearing apart the laws of heaven and earth.

When the horrifying ripples spread in every direction, starting from his feet, a terrifying pressure suffocated countless experts, causing them to involuntarily retreat.

At this moment, Long Chen looked like an invincible existence. With Evilmoon on his shoulder and the blood-colored cloak billowing behind him, he terrified everyone.

When Yue Wuxu displayed his manifestation, people were shocked. However, when Long Chen’s Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor appeared, terror was the only thing they felt. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After all, the aura of annihilation surrounding him was so thick. When they sensed it, they felt like he could destroy the entire world on his own. It was a suffocating feeling, a feeling of despair.

At this moment, Yue Wuxu’s giant sword crashed down with all his power, and his face was twisted like that of a fiend. He had not expected Long Chen to be this powerful, but it was too late to stop now. All he could do was concentrate all of his power on this attack.

“You rashly gambled everything before getting a grasp on your opponent’s power. Your defeat was fated from the start,” stated Long Chen. He then slowly lifted Evilmoon and let out a simple slash.

This attack looked light, but the moment Evilmoon swung through the air, a blood-colored dragon rune lit up on both sides of its blade.

As black qi gushed out of Evilmoon, a sinister aura filled the sky, and it slashed down like a bolt of black lightning.

BOOM!

The two divine weapons collided, and a spot of light was born between them, existing for an instant before it exploded like a sun. The collision caused the void to flicker and space to flip. This was a truly world-shaking exchange.

Within this devastation, one figure was hurtling back, his robes and hair in absolute tatters. It was Yue Wuxu.

“What?!”

Yue Wuxu had even summoned his manifestation and used a bloodline divine ability, but he still lost?

Moreover, Yue Wuxu had attacked first, and Long Chen only launched his attack afterward. Yue Wuxu was supposed to have a large advantage in that clash. As a result, the spectators had thought that Yue Wuxu would definitely turn the tide with this attack, but he was actually sent flying.

Yue Wuxu hacked up blood that consisted of countless colorful runes—his core essence blood. In other words, Long Chen’s attack had harmed his very foundation.

An expert on Yue Wuxu’s level had an exceptionally solid foundation, so even someone capable of killing him might not be able to damage his foundation because a nine star Doyens’ core energy was rooted in the Heavenly Daos.

Since that was the case, the foundation of these monstrous geniuses was always extremely difficult to damage. Thus, the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s experts were all shocked to see those runes in his blood. They almost couldn’t believe their eyes.

As the divine light in the sky faded, Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and started walking toward Yue Wuxu once more. The sound of his footsteps was like the overture of a killing god, capable of shaking people’s souls.

“That was the second move. If you can survive my third attack, I’ll spare your worthless life,” declared Long Chen.

Long Chen lifted Evilmoon toward the sky, and six runes on its surface illuminated simultaneously. As all six runes lit up, the dragon marks on the blade were absorbed into them.

As Evilmoon started to shake violently, a giant saber-image surged into the sky, piercing the dome of the heavens.

“Even the heavens have been pierced? Is he a demon?!”

“How can this be!? This is the Sovereign Emperor Heaven! He still hasn’t received recognition from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s laws! How can he do this?!”

“Even someone as strong as Yue Wuxu is unable to do such a thing. Is the difference between them really so great?”

The experts from the outside world might not feel so much shock, but the natives to the Sovereign Emperor Heaven were aware of just how terrifying it was for Long Chen to break the laws of this world.

Locked down by Long Chen, Yue Wuxu couldn’t even do anything. As he hacked up blood, there was finally terror on his face. He realized just how immense the difference between him and Long Chen was.

“To be so vicious at such a young age, wouldn’t you be a calamity once you grow up? Today, this old man shall remove a scourge from this world!” When this angry shout rang out, a figure appeared before Yue Wuxu.

The figure of an elder grabbed Yue Wuxu’s sword and swung it at Long Chen. When it fell, the Heavenly Daos rumbled, and a giant sword appeared within the heavens.

This giant sword was composed of the very laws of heaven and earth, and countless people cried out in shock upon seeing that heavenly sword.

“He summoned the blade of the Heavenly Daos! He is a Mortal Saint!”

Seeing this elder, Yue Wuxu clenched his teeth and roared furiously, his face twisted with hatred for Long Chen. “Seventh uncle! Kill that bastard!”

After all, he had lost very badly in front of countless experts. He could not accept this reality.

“Heaven Overseer...” At this moment, the Sage King who supported Long Chen spoke up. The Celestial race was completely shameless to even summon a Mortal Saint. As long as the Heaven Overseer gave him the nod, he would immediately rush out to save Long Chen. Several others beside him were already holding their weapons, ready to charge over at a moment’s notice.

Although they weren’t fond of Long Chen’s arrogance, the blood of the Long clan still flowed in Long Chen’s veins. They would not watch as he was bullied like this.

“No rush.”

The Heaven Overseer waved his hand, staring at Long Chen. He could sense the terrifying power hidden within Long Chen’s saber.

“A Mortal Saint?” Long Chen snorted and swung Evilmoon down.

“Split the Heavens, Six Forms in One!”
