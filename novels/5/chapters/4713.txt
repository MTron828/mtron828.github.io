Chapter 4702 Killing Some Small Fries?

“Tch, you’re talking about that baldie?” asked Evilmoon disdainfully. “Don’t listen to his bragging. I’ve devoured countless dragon souls, and based on their soul fragments, I know that there is no such thing as an undying, indestructible lifeform. Anything that has form can be destroyed, and only something formless can exist forever.”

“What do you mean by formless existence? Like what?” asked Long Chen hastily. He found that Evilmoon truly was different from before. It seemed to have reached a height that he couldn’t hope to reach.

“For example, jealousy, hatred, greed, desire, and such!” replied Evilmoon.

“Why are they all negative emotions?” Long Chen was speechless.

“Because that’s what I have!”

“There are also expectations, protectiveness, faith, and sacrifice, don’t you think?” Long Chen smiled slightly. That was what existed between them.

“Don’t be disgusting. Use those words on me again and I’ll shave your head and brows. I’m no longer the old Evilmoon. I won’t do something so foolish again!” declared Evilmoon.

Long Chen simply smiled at his answer. What a familiar banter. No matter how many dragon souls it had devoured, no matter which blade it had taken over, Evilmoon was still Evilmoon. It was still his most trusted companion.

“Stop smiling! Let’s be serious. We’ve reunited. I have a new body, and you’ve also gone through a transformation. Don’t you think we would be letting ourselves down if we didn’t do something big to celebrate it?” said Evilmoon.

“Alright, what do you have in mind?” asked Long Chen.

“Do you have any enemies? Let’s pay them a visit!”

Long Chen thought about it and couldn’t think of anyone he wanted to attack now.

“Hmm, I don’t think I have any enemies to kill right now. The ones that should be slain have been slain.”

“Then what about those that shouldn’t be slain?” probed Evilmoon.

“What the fuck? Even if we have the power, we can’t kill innocent people! Are you mad?”

“Cough, you misunderstand. I'm merely wondering if there are any remnants that you failed to eliminate thoroughly. You know... it's crucial to uproot the grass entirely, or it'll regrow in the spring!” clarified Evilmoon hastily.

“I’m sure there are some, but it’s just a bunch of worthless small fries.” Long Chen couldn’t think of anyone. The leaders of those he had enmity with had been killed, and he didn’t know if their factions still existed.

“Small fry is fine. Even a mosquito has some meat,” remarked Evilmoon nonchalantly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What’s the rush? Why do you want to kill people so badly?” Long Chen interjected, pulling Evilmoon in front of him.

“I didn’t get to kill enough in the Void Spirit World. Those fools were so pathetic that I couldn't even unleash my full power. It was all your power back then. I didn’t even get to activate my core runes before it all ended. Don’t you think it’s a waste?” answered Evilmoon.

Long Chen finally understood. Evilmoon was still adjusting to its new body and hadn't fully tapped into its abilities yet. It needed Long Chen’s help to get used to it, and it seemed that engaging in battles and killing was the fastest way for it to complete this process.

Regretfully, back then, Long Chen had been so overpowering that they directly crushed all their enemies. Evilmoon hadn’t even had a chance to warm up properly before it was over. That was why it was unwilling to leave things like that and wanted to kill more.

“You should focus on refining pills right now. After all, it is much more difficult for you to raise your cultivation base. You shouldn’t waste your energy on some small fries.” The Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out at this time.

“What would an old thing like you know? How is it a waste?!” raged Evilmoon.

“Evilmoon, don’t be angry. Senior is right. It’s important to deal with priorities first,” interjected Long Chen hastily.

“But the main thin—”

Long Chen interrupted Evilmoon, “The main thing is that you are Dragonbone Evilmoon. Back on the Martial Heaven Continent, did you ever kill a bunch of nameless trash?”

“No...”

“Then why would you start now? You’ve got a new body and have undergone a nirvanic rebirth. When your name spreads, it will definitely shake everyone’s ears, the type of name that resounds throughout the world. On the Martial Heaven Continent, you didn’t kill worthless trash. Now that you’re in the immortal world, you want to start killing some? Don’t you think that’s wrong?” asked Long Chen.

“You... Fine! Then I’ll wait until we encounter some real experts! Tch, it’s all your fault. You shouldn’t have killed all those people in front of the gate. They didn’t even get a chance to call their reinforcements!” grumbled Evilmoon.

Long Chen laughed. Evilmoon was still extremely prideful, and playing its pride off against itself worked wonders.

“What are you worried about? The only thing I’m not lacking is enemies. Have you forgotten those fellows behind the gate?” Long Chen chortled.

Hearing that, Evilmoon relaxed and returned to Long Chen’s back, no longer speaking. It was as if it went into seclusion.

“I didn’t expect you to have such immense karma with it... and it listens to you! Well done,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen was startled as he knew obtaining the Earth Cauldron’s praise wasn’t easy. He probed, “Do you know Dragonbone Evilmoon?”

“I do not.”

“Then you...”

“When I knew it, it wasn’t called Dragonbone Evilmoon. In truth, there were some grievances between us. Well, I won’t bother with such matters. It seems that it has experienced much worse than me. You should start refining Divine Venerate Pills. I don’t mean to discourage you, but you’re no longer cultivating just one technique. With three types of essence blood to cultivate, you’re no longer a normal nine star heir. Your physical body must accommodate all your diverse powers, which demands an immense amount of energy. Time is of the essence. A powerful exterior must be supported by a solid foundation, or it will crumble quickly,” advised the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen nodded to show that he understood. He also felt that he had experienced an enormous transformation after his tribulation.

If Long Chen’s body could be considered soil, then the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, and the Nirvana Scripture were all farm crops relying on his nourishment. Back then, he had only nourished the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but now, he had additional crops to tend to and had to provide them with ample water and fertilizer. Furthermore, he needed to tend to Huo Linger and Lei Linger's soil as well.

Perhaps it was because of all this that he could instantly unleash divine abilities upon advancing to the Divine Venerate realm. He seemed to have undergone some kind of transformation. While his power had significantly increased, so too had the requirements for further advancement in his cultivation realm.

“Time to start refining pills!”
