Chapter 3700 Selling Dirty Goods

It was a nine-inch-long hairpin with an ancient design, but it didn’t look very good. In fact, there was a great deal of rust on it.

The head of the hairpin was decorated with a small bird, whose tail looked like the ear of wheat falling naturally. However, due to there being too much rust, it was impossible to tell what kind of bird it originally depicted.

“Brother, are you selling this thing?” Long Chen pointed to the hairpin.

The vendor was a thin man with a thin mouth and monkey cheeks. Seeing that Long Chen had come with Yu Qingxuan and the others, his sharp gaze brightened.

“Brother, your vision is good. Let me tell you, this is a peerless treasure. Hey, don’t go!”

Just as he was going to start boasting about his wares, Long Chen turned and started walking away. The seller hastily shot up.

Long Chen gave Yu Qingxuan a meaningful glance. Yu Qingxuan immediately understood and continued walking away.

This sharp man was disappointed to see that Yu Qingxuan wasn’t with Long Chen. But he still pulled Long Chen closer and said, “Brother, don’t be in such a rush. Even if we don’t come to a successful sale, isn’t it still good to make friends? You won’t lose anything if you just hear my talk about the history of this Phoenix FengHuang Colored Glass Hairpin! Even if you don’t buy it, you’d still learn something! With this experience, you’ll be able to pick up better wares in the future. There are no drawbacks for you at all!”

Hearing all this, Long Chen was quite amazed. It seemed that this fellow hadn’t come to participate in the three thousand worlds. No, he was here to scam people into buying his wares.

Long Chen looked around. Seeing no one looking at them, he whispered, “Brother, we’re of the same profession. If you’re going to sell dirty goods, can you be a bit more professional? The FengHuang Hairpin is a pair. Only when the Feng and the Huang[1] are together is it complete. Who told you that a single hairpin could be called a FengHuang Hairpin?”

“Well…”

“Other than that, does your family’s colored glass also get rusty? How are you going to sell dirty goods with only this level of skill? For the person providing these wares to entrust them to you, I suppose you must have some skill.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Ah, so you’re a senior. My apologies.” That person hastily cupped his fists to Long Chen.

These so-called dirty goods naturally referred to things that couldn’t see the light of day. It wasn’t referring to things with unclear origins but treasures that were dug out from the ground. To put it more bluntly, they were things stolen from graves.

Naturally, the ones to provide these dirty goods were graverobbers. One robbed graves, and one sold the goods. Mo Nian was precisely of such a profession, and yet he called himself an archaeological scholar. In truth, whether it was on the Martial Heaven Continent or in the immortal world, this little fellow had sold quite a few of these dirty goods.

Some things had unclear value, or perhaps it simply wasn’t convenient to take them out, so he tossed them to people like this.

Because they couldn’t see the light of day, these dirty goods were provided to them at dirt-cheap prices. As for these sellers, they often went for crazy gains, aiming to sell their wares for sky-high prices.

As soon as someone showed interest in their wares, they would do their best to get as much money out of that person as they could. Because of that, as soon as Long Chen recognized this person’s profession, he exposed him to spare him from making up stories.

Although Long Chen had been wealthy on the Martial Heaven Continent, Mo Nian had been no inferior. He also had plenty of wealth thanks to people helping him dispose of his dirty goods. He kept what he could use and simply sold what he couldn’t.

As for this hairpin that Long Chen noticed, it was something from a large tomb. In the mortal world, perhaps people would feel that it was taboo. But here in the immortal world, where people had comprehended the principles of life and death, they didn’t care about this.

As a result, these goods that couldn’t see the light of day were simply called dirty goods. Some of these things might have astonishing origins and could be the treasure of some major power. If someone was discovered with such a thing, they would be hunted to the end of the world.

Some treasures were funerary objects meant to accompany their ancestors in death. If those objects were taken out, the descendants would know that their ancestors’ tombs had been robbed, and that would be an enmity with no rest until death. Thus, these treasures could only be secretly traded.

“Don’t be courteous. Let me tell you this, I’ve long since stopped doing this profession. After all, although the profit is immense, the risk is too high. It’s not a good long-term plan. I only came for the three thousand worlds, but seeing so many people, my hands are getting itchy again. I want to fleece a few rich sheep too, but I won’t do something like what you are doing. You are practically throwing out a net,” said Long Chen.

Hearing all this, that person’s wariness dropped slightly. He knew that Long Chen was truly an insider professional.

Long Chen was saying that he was eyeing a few targets, setting up plans and traps to draw them in step by step to sell some amazing treasure for a huge price.

As for this seller, he was just casting his net. In other words, he would have more opportunities at drawing in more people. But Long Chen’s targeting of a few targets would have a higher chance of success. It was simply that it required more preparation.

“Then senior is saying…”

“I’m just here to see if your items are suitable to help me out in this regard. Can you help me out?” asked Long Chen.

“Many thanks, senior! Pick whatever you want! I’ll give you the best price!” That person was delighted. Long Chen was clearly looking for things that could easily pass off as having some kind of ancient, sacred inheritance.

Long Chen nodded. “I’ll pick a few things that I like. I won’t make you lose out, but don’t go too far.”

Long Chen picked out seven things. Amongst them was the hairpin.

“Senior, your vision really is-”

“That’s enough. We’re all insiders, so you don’t need to keep the act. Give me a solid price.” Long Chen hastily cut him off.

“Sorry, it’s a professional habit.”

That person was a bit embarrassed. In truth, even if the buyer picked out a pile of dung, he would still praise them as having good vision.

“These things? Alright, I’ll give you the same price that I got for them. A hundred thousand, and I’m basically not making any profit,” he offered sincerely.

“Oh? What a fair price. Then I’ll haggle,” said Long Chen.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“You’ll still haggle? How much?” demanded the seller.

“Ten thousand.” Long Chen stuck up a single finger.

“Ten thousand? Senior, that’s wrong! Even if you kill me, that price is no good. No, at the very least, fifty thousand.”

“Fine, thirty thousand.”

“Forty thousand.”

“Thirty-five thousand.”

“Deal!”

“Not bad. Your acting is decent. Thirty-five thousand immortal king crystals. You’ve profited thirty-two thousand immortal king crystals from me.”Long Chen smiled.

As soon as he said this, that person’s expression changed. But when Long Chen really did hand over thirty-five thousand immortal king crystals, he smiled brightly.

“Senior, what are you saying? I’m really not making any money. Senior, maybe you should pick out a few more things. I’ll give you an even better price.” That person smiled.

Long Chen put away his goods and was about to leave when he saw a woman walking over from the distance. With a thought, he sent a message to the seller.

“Brother, my target has come. Work with me, and I’ll split the profit with you fifty-fifty.”

After that, Long Chen picked up a palm-sized bronze coffin. With a painful expression, he cried out, “Fifty million?! Can’t you go a little cheaper?”
