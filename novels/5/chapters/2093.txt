Chapter 2083 Heavenly Spirit Water

The auction was finally starting. It seemed it was starting a bit ahead of schedule. Perhaps it was because the atmosphere was too tense.

The middle-aged man that had walked in was someone that Long Chen recognized. It was the same person who had appraised his pill. He was now wearing his formal clothes and standing on the stage.

“Everyone present is an amazing heavenly genius with great experience. I’m sure your time is precious, so I’ll get right to it. The starting item is an ancient scripture. Everyone, please take a look.” Two beautiful attendants walked in, carrying a plate-sized tortoise shell.

A dense mass of characters was written on the shell. Through the projections of the walls, it was possible to see that they were immortal characters. Many people present were capable of translating it, but Long Chen was not one of them.

“Through our study and appraisal, this tortoise shell is a translation of part of an immortal scripture. It was translated from immemorial immortal characters. The regretful thing is that part of the shell is damaged, and even if that was fixed, it is still just a part of the immortal scripture. Thus, as a research tool, it is very valuable, but its practical value is low. If anyone is interested, you can buy it and research it yourself. Of course, if someone has had the good fortune of gathering the other parts of the scripture, that would be a different matter. The age and name of the scripture is unknown. The starting bid is ten underworld spirit beads, and each increasing bid must be five underworld spirit beads greater!” announced the middle-aged man.

This was not an auction for profit, so there weren’t too many exaggerations or ploys. The advantages and disadvantages were laid bare for everyone to see.

“Fifteen underworld spirit beads.” Nangong Zuiyue was the first bidder.

The middle-aged man sighed with relief ever so slightly. In truth, this was a very difficult auction to be hosting. The people present were all extraordinary figures of great experience. They had seen countless treasures. If no one was interested in their very first item, they would be even more indifferent to the rest of the wares. If no one bid the entire time, that would be awkward.

“Twenty underworld spirit beads. Apologies, fairy Zuiyue, I also want to research this tortoise shell,” said a man sitting in a corner.

“It’s not an issue. Auctions are fair, as is competition. The one with the higher bid wins. As long as the bid remains within my limit, I will just keep increasing mine,” said Nangong Zuiyue calmly. “Twenty-five underworld spirit beads.”

The man in the corner shouted out thirty underworld spirit beads after a moment’s hesitation.

Nangong Zuiyue immediately added another five, and in the end, her competitor shook his head. Going to forty would be above what he thought the shell was worth.

However, at least he didn’t make up some lie about being a gentleman and letting her have it. He chose to be silent.

“Congratulations on obtaining this treasure.”

Very quickly, the attendants brought the treasure over to Nangong Zuiyue. Long Chen looked closely at the tortoise shell, and his lips curled. “Thirty-five underworld spirit beads for this tortoise shell? It really doesn’t look worth it. You can’t even make a stew with this.”

There were three damaged spots on the edges of the shell. One of those spots was where the scripture was, and that was also the most important spot. With that part damaged, this shell was essentially trash.

Nangong Zuiyue simply smiled. “You can’t put it this way. Every scripture has its own history and is its own representation of the Dao. I like to research these things. The ancients’ wisdom isn’t something that we can imagine. Although this scripture is incomplete, just comprehending the slightest bit of its essence would be enough to benefit me. The thirty-five underworld spirit beads were worth it.”

“You like research so much? You make me think of someone very erudite that I know. If the two of you were to meet, I’m sure you would be friends.” Long Chen suddenly thought of Yue Xiaoqian.

Yue Xiaoqian’s learning was frighteningly deep. It was like there was nothing in this world that she didn’t know. However, there were also some things that she refused to discuss in detail.

“Who is that? I hope you can introduce me to them,” said Nangong Zuiyue. For a person to be praised by Long Chen like this, they had to be extraordinary.

“Ah... it will be up to fate. If there’s a chance, I’ll introduce the two of you,” said Long Chen.

Yue Xiaoqian’s status was special, and she couldn’t show herself yet. She was focused on advancing with the Profound Spirit Dao Scripture, the immortal scripture she had obtained in the Yin Yang World. As long as she fully comprehended it, she would be able to conceal herself perfectly. No one would be able to tell that she came from the original devil race. Then she could walk freely throughout the continent.

“I bid twenty underworld spirit beads.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A raspy voice drew Long Chen’s attention as he was talking with Nangong Zuiyue. The second auction item had gone out. It was a fist-sized stone egg covered in cracks.

Due to their chatting, they hadn’t heard the introduction, so they didn’t know what kind of treasure it was. The one bidding was Shi Lingfeng. That object had to be useful to him.

“Thirty underworld spirit beads!”

Someone also bid, causing Shi Lingfeng to immediately stand up and glare at the bidder. He was irritated.

“Are you trying to go against me?” demanded Shi Lingfeng.

The competing bidder looked at Shi Lingfeng and indifferently said, “No one’s interested in you. This place isn’t the Stone race, nor is it your era. You should reserve your temper, or it won’t be as simple as hiding from a beating. Even your ancestor, the Stone Emperor Shi Changsheng, was not qualified to be so arrogant. It was only because the Corrupt Emperor was a follower of a god that the Stone Emperor took his place amongst the three emperors. If it weren’t for the Corrupt Emperor refusing to be called emperor, there’s no way your Stone Emperor would have climbed into their midst. The so-called Stone Emperor is just a name your Stone race made for yourselves. The Martial Heaven Continent has never acknowledged him, so what qualifications do you have to be arrogant?”

Upon hearing this, Long Chen suddenly recalled that there was no Stone Emperor amongst the so-called three emperors. The three emperors were the Peng Emperor, the Corrupt Emperor, and the Blood Emperor. Long Chen hadn’t heard this story about the Corrupt Emperor though.

“What does he mean by the Corrupt Emperor refused to be called Emperor?” asked Long Chen.

Beitang Rushuang shook her head. “The Corrupt Emperor was a follower of the Corrupt God. Claiming himself Emperor would be disrespectful to his god. As for why it’s disrespectful, no one really knows.”

“This person is Luo Canghui and is said to be a strange genius. He awakened his manifestation at the age of fourteen. At that time, his cultivation base hadn’t even reached the Xiantian realm. His cultivation path is completely different from other people’s,” said Nangong Zuiyue.

Luo Canghui’s outer appearance was ordinary. His eyes were calm but also contained an ancient air to them that was a bit odd.

His words were said calmly without any anger, but they were a naked slap in the face of Shi Lingfeng. Furthermore, it was a very resounding slap.

“Luo Canghui, do you dare to fight me?!” Shi Lingfeng’s face was originally ugly, but now it got even uglier.

Luo Canghui indifferently said, “I’m not interested.”

The middle-aged man hastily said, “Luo Canghui has bid thirty underworld spirit beads! If there are no higher bids, this treasure will go to mister Luo Canghui!”

“Fifty underworld spirit beads!” snorted Shi Lingfeng.

Luo Canghui didn’t bid again. It was unknown if he felt that this thing wasn’t worth that much or he just didn’t feel like competing with Shi Lingfeng.

More treasures followed, none that were particularly outstanding. However, eventually a treasure appeared that made Long Chen’s eyes light up.

The middle-aged man was holding a transparent bottle. There was a drop of strange liquid inside that was roaming around like a tadpole.

“This is Heavenly Spirit Water. It is not a treasure from this world and is similar to meteorites that come from outside our world. This is a magical matter from the cosmos that contains pure life energy. Whether it’s for cultivation, comprehension, or forging, it can be immensely beneficial. I’m sure many people recognize this treasure, so I won’t over-explain or waste everyone’s time. One drop of Heavenly Spirit Water, starting bid of fifty underworld spirit beads,” announced the middle-aged man. This was the final treasure, and after it was sold, he would have accomplished his mission without any major mishaps.

“Sixty underworld spirit beads!” shouted Beitang Rushuang.

However, she was bidding for Long Chen. Long Chen saw Zhao Wuji, Huang Feiyan, and even Shi Lingfeng’s figures amongst the crowd. If he did it himself, whatever he bid on would be targeted by others.

“Sixty-five underworld spirit beads!”

“Seventy!”

“One hundred!” Beitang Rushuang instantly raised the price to a hundred underworld spirit beads. This was an indication that she would fight for it to the end.

As expected, after this high bid, the others bidding on it frowned. Although this Heavenly Spirit Water was rare, it was just a single drop. One hundred underworld spirit beads for it was a bit much.

Adding on Beitang Rushuang’s attitude, they didn’t have an urge to keep fighting for it. It wasn’t a must-have for them.

As a result, this drop of Heavenly Spirit Water really did go for one hundred underworld spirit beads.

The auction ended, and everyone began to leave. Long Chen asked Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue to wait a bit. They only left once everyone else was gone.

“Long Chen, how are you going to thank me?”

Beitang Rushuang waved the bottle of Heavenly Spirit Water at Long Chen, smiling naughtily.
