Chapter 2376 Reclaiming the Camp

Translator: BornToBe

The next day, the eighth legion moved out in high spirits. The warriors were completely different from before. Their broken-down armor had been replaced, and their weapons were also new. Their eyes were full of new confidence, which stemmed from their heavy pockets.

Following Long Chen’s suggestion, the legion itself had only kept a tenth of their gains from the last operation. The rest had been split between every individual warrior.

With their pockets full, their backs naturally straightened. They had equipped themselves and bought some helpful talismans and other items that could potentially save their lives.

They had had high expectations for Long Chen from the start, and he hadn’t disappointed them. Now that Long Chen was leading them on another expedition, they felt their blood heating up. It could be said that the entire eighth legion had undergone a transformation.

When they were getting close to their original camp, Long Chen waved his hand, and everyone immediately stopped. “Brothers, our camp is right ahead. That is the place where we once spilled our blood. That place is our pride and our humiliation. Countless brothers died in battle there, and we lost it. We’ve disappointed those brothers. Today, we will reclaim it and wipe away our humiliation. We’ll use the heads of the demonic beasts as an offering to our fallen brothers, use their blood to carve our brilliance, use their corpses as proof to everyone that the eighth legion is rising. Everyone who looks down on us will know that our fortunes have changed. Brothers, we fight for our honor!”

“For honor!”

The voices of the eighth legion’s warriors shook the land. Shen Chengfeng also clenched his fists. The eighth legion had always been full of potential, but he had never been able to draw it out. With just one battle, Long Chen had completely transformed them. He was ashamed of himself but also filled with anticipation for what was next.

He saw many things that he didn’t possess within Long Chen. He also saw a quality that none of the commanders of the Heavenly Dragon Legion possessed. It was the confidence that was built up within Long Chen’s bones that made it seem like there was nothing he couldn’t solve. That posed a fatal charisma to others.

“Excellent, this is precisely the state required to grasp victory from danger. Everyone, I’ll give you an hour to reach your peak state. Look over your bodies and your equipment. Send scouts to keep an eye on the surroundings. If there’s anything suspicious, report it immediately,” ordered Long Chen.

Everyone made their final checks before the battle. Some went out to scout the surroundings, and they quickly returned to report that there was nothing off.

Shen Chengfeng secretly said, “The tripwire we set before has been triggered.”

Long Chen smiled and didn’t say anything. An incense stick’s worth of time later, he waved his hand. “Move out.

“Didn’t you say to wait an hour?” asked Shen Chengfeng.

“That was just for others to hear. Did you believe it? Why would we need an hour to prepare for battle?” said Long Chen.

Reclaiming their camp would not be playing house. It would be a bloody battle. Who would really be so careless as to not check their equipment before coming? Such a lie would have been instantly seen through in the secular world. Not even a child would believe it.

However, in the cultivation world, where power was everything, it seemed that such a lie was believable. Since even Shen Chengfeng had believed it, Long Chen was no longer worried about his enemies not believing it.

They quickly arrived at a narrow pass. On one side, space was constantly warping, with a frightening black hole at the center.

On the other side was a giant mountain covered in ice. The icy air coming off of it made people feel like their souls would freeze if they even looked at it. That was also a place that no one could approach.

Between them was the camp of the eighth legion. However, all the buildings had been torn down. Countless demonic beasts were residing within the camp now.

This camp was a checkpoint that had to be passed in order to enter deeper into the Ancient Battlefield. Just defending it before had been taxing for the eighth legion. Now that they were forced to be the attackers, they would have to pay a terrible price considering how much of an advantage the terrain gave to the defenders.

Suddenly, a roar came from within the camp. Following that, the demonic beasts began to pour out.

“Little human race, coming here is sending yourselves to die. You should scram!” shouted one of the Titan Blood Bull demons.

“Long Chen, something’s wrong. It seems like there are fewer demonic beasts here than before. Furthermore, they’re telling us to scram instead of directly attacking,” said Shen Chengfeng. After the last sneak attack, the demonic beasts here had increased in number, but now they had decreased again.

“They’re baiting us. Even demonic beasts play these kinds of schemes? But their intelligence is far too low. Use the formation disc to check the surrounding space and see if there’s anything hiding,” said Long Chen. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Commander, there are countless terrifying auras in the surroundings. They are dozens of times greater than what they appear on the surface!” exclaimed one of the vice commanders suddenly. With their new wealth, Long Chen had had them buy a powerful sensing formation that now managed to sense countless powerful auras hiding.

Long Chen waved his hand. “Everything is within expectations. We aren’t hiding that we are going to reclaim our land. Weren’t we shouting over there as well just so that they could prepare themselves? But this little scheme of theirs is excellent. They’re practically cooperating with us. We don’t have to waste as many of the things as we have prepared. The time’s about right, so we can attack.”

Shen Chengfeng immediately gave the order. He summoned his manifestation and charged into the army of the demonic beasts.

As soon as Shen Chengfeng moved, the various crossbows set up at the rear unleashed long-distance attacks, tearing a path through the demonic beasts all the way into the camp.

Shen Chengfeng charged into the camp, only to find that the demonic beasts here were extremely weak, unable to bear a single blow from him. Those demonic beasts began to flee when he entered.

“Commander, the surrounding demonic beasts are starting to surround us!” shouted the vice commander with the sensor apparatus.

“No need to bother with them. Have the people at the rear slow down a bit. We’ll just all enter and follow the plan,” said Long Chen.

The eighth legion’s warriors slowly entered their old camp. The first wave immediately began setting up a tower.

This tower wasn’t an arrow tower. It was specially set up for extremely long range shots. Normally, it shot out distress signals asking for aid. After all, nothing was guaranteed on the battlefield, and other items used for sending messages might end up losing effect right when they were needed. This long range tower could save someone’s life at such a time.

This tower was able to shoot arrows with special runes for breaking through space, and that allowed them to shoot extremely far. But unfortunately, that was all. Its arrows didn’t possess killing power.

After it was set up, Long Chen stood on top of it and looked into the distance. At this time, those hidden demonic beasts were starting to surround them secretly. As long as all the eighth legion entered their camp, they would instantly pounce.

“Why are they so slow? Ye Lingfeng, you better not disappoint me.” Long Chen looked into the distance, his confidence starting to flag. He couldn’t have run into something unexpected, right?

“Have the warriors slow down and stall for more time,” ordered Long Chen.

A moment later, Shen Chengfeng’s expression changed. “The demonic beasts seem to be losing patience. They’re not waiting any longer!”

“Fuck, what is Ye Lingfeng doing? He can’t even do something so small? Have everyone get in,” said Long Chen helplessly.

Just at that moment, the surrounding demonic beasts came out from their hiding places and attacked from every direction.

“Hahaha, good, good, they also came.” Suddenly, Long Chen saw the space in the distance collapse. Countless demonic beasts were chasing a group of people over. Seeing Ye Lingfeng, Long Chen was delighted.
