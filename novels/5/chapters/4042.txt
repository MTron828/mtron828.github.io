Chapter 4031 After Beating the Junior, Beat the Senior

“A clone?”

Everyone was startled. So that was Long Chen’s flame clone. It had actually managed to trick everyone, including the Kunpeng patriarch who had experienced countless battles.

Long Chen’s flame clone possessed his aura as it contained his Spiritual Strength. Hence, without a closer examination, it was impossible to tell the difference.

Moreover, everyone's nerves were tense, a mix of shock and anger, causing them to be caught off guard by Long Chen's usage of what seemed like a low-level trick—a clone.

Even so, this basic maneuver had ended up fooling everyone. Long Chen then kicked away Kun Tu and grabbed his bloody wing happily, tossing it into the primal chaos space.

A pair of treasures that Kun Tu had yet to master now fell into Long Chen’s hands.

“Long Chen, I curse you to have a terrible death!” Kun Tu felt like his soul had been torn apart, and his face was twisted like that of a ghoul. Despite his powerful shout, having lost his wings, he was severely weakened, and a finger flick from Long Chen could crush him to death. So, even with all his fury, he didn’t dare to attack Long Chen.

“I, on the other hand, wish you a long life of a hundred years,” said Long Chen, smiling brightly at him.

Long Chen’s wings then flapped, and while everyone was still stunned, he rushed toward the hell flame barrier.

“Summon the fiend gates!”

The next moment, devil qi exploded and enormous gates broke out of the ground, completely blocking Long Chen’s path.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

These gates had a fiendish mouth branded on them, with countless chains around the gates. It was like all these gates had something sealed behind them, something that would devour all life in this world if it was released.

A total of nine gates had appeared in a row, blocking Long Chen. This was the unbreakable defense that the Alldevil experts had prepared for Long Chen.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

With a resounding roar, a dragon image appeared behind him, extending a dragon claw toward the gates.

The next moment, the sharp claw tore through these nine fiendish gates like slicing tofu and struck the flame barrier.

The flame barrier exploded. However, Long Chen was startled to find that despite the barrier being broken, the flames were still burning, and the spatial gate in the sky only quivered ever so slightly.

In an instant, Long Chen understood that the flames were immune to physical attacks. He then hastily told Huo Linger, “Gather the flames here!”

Huo Linger was in the midst of devouring the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf’s power. But since Long Chen needed her, she stopped what she was doing and came out to help him.

Huo Linger then transformed into a giant dragon that charged into the barrier. When she opened her mouth, the black hell flames flowed into her body in thousands of streams.

Just then, the Kunpeng patriarch transformed into a giant Kunpeng and attacked Long Chen with his wings, which had runes flowing on top of them like stars. It was like an entire cosmos was crashing down on Long Chen.

The Kunpeng patriarch was a true three-flower Earth Venerate, and his three flowers were perfectly linked with the world, their power being able to swallow up all of heaven and earth.

The Kunpeng patriarch was now fully enraged. After all, just how prideful was the Kunpeng race? They even dared to challenge the dragon race, and the two factions had been fighting for countless years. The Kunpeng race stood as the only flying bird race capable of posing a significant threat to the true dragons

The Kunpeng race indeed had a shameful chapter in their history, but they were so prideful that they took their revenge on the true dragon race, devouring them just to wipe out the humiliation.

So, when Kun Tu first targeted Long Chen, it was because of the true dragon essence blood in Long Chen’s body. Although Long Chen was a human, that trace of true dragon aura destined them to be mortal enemies.

Unfortunately for Kun Tu, he had repeatedly lost to Long Chen, a human. Perhaps if Long Chen was a true member of the true dragon race, the patriarch would be able to accept this.

However, Long Chen was just a little human who had absorbed true dragon essence blood, which meant an inferior race had actually beaten Kun Tu with just the power of the physical body—an absolute disgrace for the Kunpeng race.

Seeing that Kun Tu had lost his ability to keep fighting, the patriarch could only thicken his face and attack Long Chen despite being a senior.

“After beating the junior, the senior comes out. The Kunpeng race really is a shameful existence. No wonder you begged the dragon race for mercy back then.” Long Chen sneered at him and didn’t dodge. As his hand took the shape of a dragon claw, he raked the air.

His blood, qi, bones, spirit, soul, and will merged. Normally, these powers would clash and weaken each other, but when faced with powerful enemies, an intriguing phenomenon occurred—the clashes strangely diminished.

It was akin to a group of people who were at odds with each other suddenly setting aside their differences and uniting against a powerful enemy. All conflicts were put on hold as they joined forces and formed an alliance.

BOOM!

A dragon claw and a Kunpeng claw clashed. The moment they met, heaven and earth lost their original color.

After that, one of those two claws rapidly grew until it devoured the entire world.

As a result, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted, and a terrifying power raged throughout this battlefield.

The impact of the strike tore apart the void, sending astral winds flying and causing the earth to be completely deformed. Now, the human settlement was nothing but a memory, replaced by giant spatial cracks everywhere.

The Kunpeng patriarch grunted and was sent flipping through the air. He then furiously roared, “Impossible! Even if you have a trace of true dragon essence blood, you can’t possess such power! Even the dragon kings of the true dragon race don’t possess this power! Just who are you?!”

At this moment, he was starting to question whether or not Long Chen was a human. Was he perhaps a disguised dragon expert?

Just as he roared, a figure silently slipped behind him, wielding a saber that crashed down upon the root of his wings.

The next moment, blood sprayed through the air as the patriarch roared in fury. A deep cut was then left in the base of his wings.

After clashing with the Kunpeng patriarch, Long Chen almost coughed up blood. But he knew that his enemy would also suffer, so he had taken the risk to sneak attack the latter.

“Damn, I didn’t cut them off even with this.”

Even though the sneak attack had been pulled off, in that state, Long Chen’s Blood Qi had yet to settle from the previous exchange, so there was no way for him to unleash a full-power attack. In the end, he only left a giant cut on the Kunpeng patriarch’s wings, failing to cut them off.

“You despicable bastard! Die!”

With a roar, the Kunpeng patriarch’s wings lit up. But just as he was about to blast Long Chen away, Long Chen was already making his move. He had been prepared from the moment he launched his sneak attack.

His left hand grabbed the patriarch’s wing, while some dark red powder appeared in his right hand. The moment Long Chen placed this powder on the cut, the patriarch’s body shook and he let out a painful scream.
