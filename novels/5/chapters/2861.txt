Chapter 2850 Historical Records

Upon seeing Mu Qingyun blushing, Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. But acting indifferent, he said, “Speak. I’ll help if I can.”

Mu Qingyun nervously said, “I want… I want to know… if the Elite Group can join the Unfettered Alliance.”

Long Chen instantly relaxed and smiled. “The Elite Group isn’t mine. I have no opinion on that.”

Hearing that response, Mu Qingyun was delighted. She then grabbed his hand. “Thank you, brother San. I’ve asked them if they want to join before, but they always said that they needed your approval first.”

Many instructors formed their own groups, treating them as their accomplishments and using this as chips to rise in instructor rank.

For the Elite Group to join the Unfettered Alliance was like taking them away from Long Chen. Mu Qingyun wouldn’t even ask if she didn’t have a choice.

It was because the Elite Group’s display was truly stunning. They had all entered the divine rankings. Furthermore, their potential was even more shocking. The Unfettered Alliance’s power would instantly soar with them joining.

Mu Qingyun was delighted, but then she suddenly realized that she was holding Long Chen’s hand. She turned completely red and hastily let go, cursing herself for forgetting her manners.

Long Chen smiled very naturally. “Those fellows were lost in their own dreams before, using arrogance to cover up their feeling of inferiority. Now they can prove themselves, and they’re going to need others to recognize them. Your Unfettered Alliance has many beautiful women. Hehe, those fellows will definitely be working hard in the future.”

“Brother San, this is essentially taking away one of your cards for being promoted. Are you really not mad?” asked Mu Qingyun. Long Chen’s eyes were bright and clear. She could see that he was sincere.

“I don’t need such things,” said Long Chen.

“Brother San, you really are a good person,” Said Mu Qingyun softly.

Long Chen laughed. “I’m delighted to hear it. It seems that I’ve never been called like that in my time in the lower world.”

Long Chen had grown up being cursed at. When was he ever called a good person? Hence, this praise made Long Chen feel a little happy.

“Brother San is cold on the outside but warm on the inside. Your sharp edges and fierceness naturally make it seem like you don’t like getting close to others. But you really are a good person inside,” said Mu Qingyun genuinely. This was her evaluation of him after knowing him for this short while. Although she hadn’t talked to him for very long, she saw that he was a very simple person who disdained to play petty tricks. “Brother San, we’ve arrived at the Divine Scripture Pavilion. But I won’t accompany you inside. For me to enter requires money because I don’t have the privilege of an instructor.”

Mu Qingyun pointed to the large tower up ahead. She had come with him here for the matter of the Unfettered Alliance. Now that Long Chen had agreed, she had to tell everyone the good news.

Seeing her leave, Long Chen shook his head. Looking at her felt like looking at his past self. Now it seemed that he could rarely get excited about things like this.

The Divine Scripture Pavilion had nine floors, and its exterior was very simple. But when he walked in, he found that this place was its own world.

After he handed over his status plate, the disciple who checked it was startled. He then looked up at Long Chen and eyed him for a while before returning it. Clearly, this disciple had also heard of his name.

“The first floor’s scriptures are arranged by category. If you wish to find a specific one, you should look in the specific section slowly. If you just search blindly, you might not find what you’re looking for even after a few years,” reminded that disciple.

“Many thanks.” Long Chen received a jade tile from the disciple. After that, his Spiritual Strength entered, and information poured into his head.

This was the arrangement of the Divine Scripture Pavilion. When he saw the diagram, he jumped in shock.

The Divine Scripture Diagram was actually gigantic and contained countless tomes. There were countless classifications, from big to small. For example, there was forging as a major category, and then it was divided into soul items, spirit items, heavy items, devil weapons, Dao weapons, demonic weapons, etc. There were hundreds of further divisions, and then many more further classifications all the way down to specific topics such as foundational principles, the history of certain items, and introductory programs. Even a novice wouldn’t need a master if they came here. They could use these tomes to cultivate themselves.

From a sea of topics, Long Chen found the history section. He grew excited, but then he saw countless topics within this section, making his head buzz.

The reason he had come to this section was to find any information related to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, Lord Brahma, Fallen Daynight, and the other gods. He wanted to see if he could perhaps trace some clues to find out the truth.

However, there were countless regions, sects, nations, wars, and other topics here. They were arranged according to year. Looking at this, Long Chen was dejected.

“How am I supposed to search through this?” Long Chen had an urge to cry. Just as he felt a trace of excitement, a bucket of ice water poured over him.

Long Chen then thickened his face and entered the history section. The unending bookshelves were filled with ancient records. Someone claustrophobic would probably die of fright in an instant if they were here.

Looking at the vast sea of books, Long Chen felt lost. He didn’t know where the records of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight were located. He also didn’t know what section had information on cultivation techniques.

After wandering for a while, he suddenly noticed an elder with a cleaning rag. That elder carefully took out a book and wiped it.

Long Chen was startled. He curiously asked, “Senior, do the books here get dusty?”

“The books don’t get dusty. What gets dusty is the human heart. I’m simply checking to see if their core energy has gotten too low or not. When that energy reaches a critical level, it unleashes a noisy alarm,” answered the elder. He continued wiping the book with his head lowered. His movements were very light, very slow, but very steady.

After he finished wiping it, he returned it to its original location and picked up the next one. Only then did he seem to react and realize that someone was talking to him. He then turned to look at Long Chen.

The elder’s face was covered in wrinkles to the point that it looked like tree bark, and his eyes were filled with the vicissitudes of time. He looked like an ancient scholar who had seen through the world.

“Junior Long Chen greets senior.” Long Chen bowed. He rarely took the initiative to bow to others, but this elder somehow made him automatically feel a deep veneration. Even Long Chen didn’t know why.

“Haha, young man, you’re too courteous. An old man overseeing this scripture pavilion doesn't dare to accept such etiquette.” The elder laughed. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Senior is too humble. With your learning, junior will probably never be able to catch up even with a lifetime of studying. Your temperament already proves your power,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“Haha, you have some manners, unlike others who shout at this old man all the time. I’m very moved. However, if you praise me this much, I won’t dare to accept. Have you encountered some difficulty? Why not tell me and see if I can help you out,” said the elder kindly.

“Junior wishes to know if there are any records here related to Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight?” asked Long Chen directly.
