Chapter 4640 Returning to the Dragon Cemetery

“Hurry and gather all the ores! We have to move quickly!” shouted Long Chen.

“Boss, what is it?” Guo Ran and the others were startled.

“The best time to undergo tribulation is coming soon. Other than gathering these ores, we have more important things to do. We don’t have enough time!” Long Chen suddenly thought of the possibility of bringing the Dragonblood warriors to the dragon cemetery to undergo its baptism.

Back in the Sovereign clan’s dragon nest, Long Chen had undergone his own baptism. During that period, he had thought of having the Dragonblood warriors experience this baptism as well. The Dragonblood warriors would then enter a new era.

However, they had too many things to do, and Long Chen had actually forgotten about this possibility. When Guo Ran mentioned their upcoming tribulation, Long Chen immediately recalled this important matter and urged everyone to finish up as quickly as possible.

After that, the Sublime Spirit race started to bid farewell to Long Chen and the others. After all, they had come to this world for the Sublime Spirit race’s spirit source—the land of their faith. As they wanted to rejoin the rest of their people, they couldn’t stay by Long Chen’s side. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Long Chen was a bit uneasy about letting them go alone, but they were determined. As the imminent crisis had been resolved and they had recovered from their wounds, it was time for them to go.

Seeing their determination, Long Chen couldn’t force them to stay. However, before they left, Guo Ran and Xia Chen gave them many mechanisms and formation discs, along with thorough instructions on how to use them. These additional resources would serve as valuable trump cards in case they encountered danger once more.

Once the Sublime Spirit race’s women left them, the Dragonblood warriors threw themselves into a frenzy of excavating the underground ores. These ores were massive and diverse, comprising dozens of different immortal metals—a sight almost beyond imagination.

However, Long Chen only gave everyone three days to mine here due to how pressing the time was. Everyone only extracted the purest ores and left the ones with the slightest impurities.

This kind of barbaric mining was extremely wasteful, causing Guo Ran to feel a deep sense of sorrow. If given the luxury of time, he would have painstakingly extracted every last grain of ore.

After three days of crazy mining, the once-bountiful earth was left ravaged and depleted. Countless ditches scarred the landscape where ores had once lain buried. After taking only the best ores, the Dragonblood Legion left.

“My heart!” Guo Ran stared at those ores reluctantly as he left. To a Forging Master, this kind of action was practically a waste of a natural treasure.

“Alright, you’ve eaten the meat, at least leave others some soup,” comforted Long Chen.

The moment the mining finished, Long Chen had Xia Chen set up a supreme transportation formation. When Guo Ran and the others asked where they were going, Long Chen told them the name of the dragon cemetery.

Hearing that Long Chen wanted to bring them to undergo a baptism in the Sovereign clan’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, the Dragonblood warriors jumped in excitement. After all, they were called the Dragonblood warriors and had dragon blood flowing through their veins. While they had never heard of the dragon race’s Sovereign clan, the name alone was enough to tell them that it was a supreme existence.

“Boss, we don’t have dragon blood in us. Can we still undergo the baptism?” asked Bai Xiaole nervously.

“Of course. The dragon blood baptism isn’t just for the blood but also for the soul and will. As the emperor of the beast race, their inheritance offers many aspects for you to explore. You can select what resonates with you, and there’s no obligation for you to take in what you don’t like. The dragon race’s legacy holds countless treasures that will meet your expectations. You definitely won’t be disappointed,” promised Long Chen. “Just look at Zifeng. He also doesn’t have dragon blood in him, but he still wants to undergo the baptism!”

The prospect of the dragon blood baptism immediately ignited Bai Xiaole’s excitement, while Bai Shishi visibly relaxed at Long Chen’s assurances. With the completion of the formation, everyone stepped onto it.

Through several calibrations and dozens of transportations, Long Chen and the others arrived at the dragon cemetery. This time, Long Chen was familiar with the pathways and brought the Dragonblood warriors straight toward the depths of the dragon cemetery.

When they passed through the Ten Thousand Dragon Nests and felt the terrifying dragon might, the Dragonblood warriors’ hearts shook. They knew that this was a heaven-defying chance to change their fates.

“It’s a good thing that we got back in time, or we would have missed this chance,” said one Dragonblood warrior in anticipation as he gazed at the majestic Ten Thousand Dragon Nests.

This Dragonblood warrior had only rejoined the Dragonblood Legion within the Void Spirit World, along with their healing warriors. During their previous encounter with the Celestial race, the timely intervention of these healing warriors prevented any casualties on their side.

“We’ll always profit by following boss,” said one of the healing warriors with a laugh.

These healing warriors had been honing their skills in a secluded sect within a world that could be likened to a crack between worlds. Cut off from the outside world, they were isolated from much information and only managed to reunite with the Dragonblood Legion at this juncture.

Upon their return, their presence made a monumental difference. With the healing warriors on hand, the Dragonblood warriors could engage in combat without restraint. There was a huge difference from how restrained they had to fight before.

The ranks of the Dragonblood Legion had swelled from five thousand to over seven thousand members. However, despite this, both Long Chen and the others couldn’t help but feel a pang of sorrow deep within.

Long Chen had sent out calls for the Dragonblood warriors far and wide. Once they ascended to the immortal world, their priority had been to reunite with their brothers. After much time had passed, those who were able to return had already done so.

Regretfully, some may never return. The immortal world was not the wonderland they had envisioned in the mortal realm; it was a harsh and perilous place. Perhaps some brothers had silently fallen in the intense fights of the immortal world.

Nonetheless, it was a major accomplishment to be able to gather over seven thousand Dragonblood warriors, who were scattered throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. It was a testament to the deep longing harbored within the heart of every Dragonblood warrior.

“Heavens, what a terrifying reverse scale!”

When the Dragonblood warriors saw the first ancestral scale, they came to a halt. Some of them even gulped, their eyes full of thirst.

“Don’t look at this trash. Do you think I would mistreat you?” Long Chen directly pushed them onward. They hadn’t even reached the core region.

“Trash?”

Such a terrifying reverse scale was actually called trash by their boss. Then just what kind of treasure was their boss leaving for them?

When they reached the core, the Dragonblood warriors were taken aback by the aura of these ancestral scales. Long Chen found that the whole dragon cemetery was devoid of dragons, and even the ones undergoing the baptism in the white dragon race’s nest had left. Clearly, they had already all finished and were looking for a place to undergo their tribulations.

When Long Chen brought everyone into the Sovereign clan’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, a majestic dragon might crashed down upon them. Other than Long Chen, every single one of them spat out a mouthful of blood.
