Chapter 3784 Double Dragon Destruction

Weng Tianhao was shocked and enraged, unable to understand what was happening. How did the ancestral divine weapon of his Weng family suddenly end up in Lei Linger’s hands?

As the Wild Blade slashed at him, an ancient tower appeared in his hand. It was the exact same tower as the one in his manifestation.

BOOM!

The Wild Blade struck the tower, causing lightning to explode. Lightning then condensed into spears piercing through heaven and earth. That sight horrified countless people.

All of a sudden, Lei Linger formed a hand seal with her left hand. Upon seeing that seal, Weng Tianhao’s expression completely changed.

“You-!”

The Wild Blade suddenly rumbled as if it was coming to life. A ray of divine light then shot out of its tip at Weng Tianhao.

With no time to dodge, Weng Tianhao was struck by that light and exploded. Within the lightning runes that filled the air, a fist-sized golden human appeared.

“Death substitute puppet!”

When they saw that tiny figure, people jumped in shock. Some people didn’t cultivate clones, but as a life-saving measure, they would refine a puppet to take their place in death at a critical juncture.

However, it was extremely difficult to create such a thing, and it needed years of nourishment from the essence blood and soul of the true body. A normal person wouldn’t bother with such a thing, but it could save a person’s life when they needed it.

A person could only have a single death substitute puppet at a time. After it was used, it would take years to raise another one. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Weng Tianhao would not have used it unless he had absolutely no other choice. Now that he had, it meant that this last attack could have taken his life.

“No! How can you use the Wild Blade’s Soul Severing Art?!” shouted Weng Tianhao furiously.

“Starting today, the Wild Blade is mine. Naturally, I can use all of its abilities. Do you want to try the Wild Blade’s killer move?” Lei Linger pointed the Wild Blade at Weng Tianhao coldly.

“Bitch!” Upon hearing that, Weng Tianhao’s expression grew exceedingly ugly. He suddenly spat out blood and formed hand seals. This blood then transformed into countless runes.

“Wild Blade, return!”

He was using the blood sacrifice art of the Wild Blade. The Wild Blade was the Violet Lightning Empire’s ancestral divine weapon, and generations of experts had left a bloodline mark on it. His bloodline could forcibly call it back.

However, he was infuriated to find that there was no reaction. Lei Linger smiled. 

“Your Weng family’s bloodline mark was a slave seal to the Wild Blade. It has long since started to hate you guys. While you were using it to absorb the heavenly tribulation’s energy, I discussed everything with it. I used my core energy to help it escape its bindings, and now it will fight alongside me. No matter how much essence blood you ignite, it’s useless. You treated it as a slave, so it hates you.”

Suddenly, the Wild Blade swung behind Lei Linger. The Underworld Eye Giant had been creeping toward Long Chen and was accurately struck head-on. He coughed up blood and flew into the distance.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei were both shocked. The current Lei Linger possessed absolutely astonishing power. She could destroy heaven and earth with just a wave of her hand. 

Most importantly, her attack now contained an undefeatable will. That was somewhat similar to the nine star heirs. Just looking at her was enough to shake people’s hearts, making them lose confidence.

“A little lightning spirit also dares to be arrogant?!”

Kun Tu came flying over. His wings covered the heavens, and a monstrous fish mark appeared on his claws. He attacked Long Chen, Lei Linger, and Jiang Lei together.

“It’s the power of a seal!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. This attack was not ordinary. It seemed to be an attack specialized for an existence like Lei Linger. Long Chen didn’t dare to be careless against the Kunpeng race’s divine abilities.

But all of a sudden, Huo Linger appeared by Lei Linger’s side. The two of them then exchanged a glance and smiled. Lei Linger wielded the Wild Blade, while Huo Linger wielded the True Fire Sword.

“Double Dragon Destruction!”

Lei Linger and Huo Linger attacked together and crossed their swords. When violet lightning and white flames mixed, all sounds seemed to fade from this world. All colors faded into gray.

At this moment, the apocalyptic power of heavenly tribulation energy mixed with the Heavenly Flame energy of the Ice Soul. Spacetime began to twist and collapse because of their power. The entire world’s laws were shaken and the ten thousand Daos quivered.

Kun Tu’s expression completely changed. He had never witnessed such a terrifying power before. It had to be known that the current Lei Linger had absorbed the power of all the nine star heirs, so her thunderforce had risen to an unimaginable level.

As for Huo Linger, she had been absorbing the flame energy within this tribulation lightning the entire time. This pure energy helped her to rapidly climb as well. As the master of the Ice Soul, she was capable of using the power of the eighth rank Heavenly Flame. That was a flame that could truly break the order of heaven and earth.

Hence, when the two of them unleashed their full power, Kun Tu’s hair instantly stood on end. A terrifying threat of death made his soul quiver, and he directly abandoned his attack.

His body rapidly retreated with folded wings in front of him. Divine runes then flowed on top of his wings, forming a barrier. The giant Kun manifestation behind him grew, enveloping him and adding another barrier in front of his wings. This was his strongest defense.

BOOM!

Lei Linger and Huo Linger spun together and smashed into it. As a result, the giant Kun manifestation instantly exploded. Following that, his wings were also torn through, and blood rained down.

“What?!”

Seeing this, people couldn’t believe their eyes. Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s attack shattered the Kun manifestation and pierced his wings before striking his claws. In the end, Kun Tu’s claws were split open, and he was sent flying into the distance. He vanished without a trace, his aura gone. It was unknown if he was dead or alive.

After seeing that, everyone was horrified. Just how powerful was Kun Tu? It could be said that he was the strongest person here, but even he had been defeated miserably.

“He’s quite powerful. He’s still not dead,” said Lei Linger somewhat bitterly.

“It would be best if he wasn’t killed. Leave him alive. I still have a use for him.” Only then did Long Chen recover from his shock and smile.

“Attack together! Now is the best time to kill Long Chen!” Suddenly, Weng Tianhao came charging back, shouting at the others. 

The others had also noticed the problem with Long Chen. He had to rely entirely on Lei Linger and Huo Linger to fight now. However, Huo Linger had vanished, and Lei Linger’s aura was weakened. This truly was the best time to kill him.

The Underworld Eye Giant, the beast cultivator, and the others all attacked. However, Long Chen only looked at them and sneered.

“Weng Tianhao, thank you for your Wild Blade. Look after that tower in your hand. I’ll be taking it next time.”

Suddenly, Long Chen crushed a talisman. Spatial energy then wrapped around Long Chen and Jiang Lei, transporting the two of them away instantly.

Weng Tianhao’s attack missed. He looked around but couldn’t find a trace of Long Chen, so he let out a furious roar.

Just then, Kun Tu reappeared. He was covered in blood and filled with killing intent. However, he was one step too late. Long Chen was already gone.

“You idiot, you ruined everything! Die!” Kun Tu roared furiously and directly attacked Weng Tianhao.

“It’s all because of you, idiot! You’re the one who interfered! Just wait, in the future, I’ll kill any demonic beasts that I see!”

Having lost the Wild Blade and sacrificed a great deal of essence blood to try calling it back, Weng Tianhao didn’t wish to fight. It was because although Kun Tu was injured, there were still a large number of demonic beast experts here. As there was no point in fighting now, Weng Tianhao transformed into a streak of lightning and fled.

The other experts from other races also scattered. If they stayed, they wouldn’t just have to deal with Kun Tu and the other demonic beasts here. There were also the Divine Venerates outside. As a result, they scattered in an instant.

The Heavenly River Blood Sea was gone. The bones were gone. The heavenly tribulation’s rampage had turned this into a land of absolute death; the burial ground for one billion Beast Venerates was no more. No one back then would have imagined that millions and millions of years later, countless heavenly geniuses would undergo heavenly tribulation here, resulting in these ancient corpses losing even their bones. They were all transformed into specks of dust.
