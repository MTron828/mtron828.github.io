Chapter 2888 Immortal Institute Instructor Exam

“Long Chen, why have you suddenly come here? You didn’t send us word ahead of time. If you had, things wouldn’t have blown up like this,” said Luo Bing.

Luo Bing had set up a special method to communicate with Mu Qingyun. If Long Chen had simply messaged them through it beforehand, none of this would have happened.

“I’m not afraid of trouble. Time is pressing, and I came because I have something important to discuss. Today just so happens to be the day of the Immortal Institute instructor exam. Use your connections to get me a spot,” said Long Chen.

“You want to become an instructor of the Immortal Institute?” Luo Bing couldn’t believe her ears. What kind of time was it for Long Chen to waste time on this?

“Yes. Hurry and arrange it. If I don’t make it, I’ll have to wait a month,” said Long Chen.

“But the Immortal Institute’s exam…”

“Just sign me up for now. Leave the rest to me,” said Long Chen.

Luo Bing helplessly sent someone to arrange this. The result was that they really were too late. The last spot had been taken.

Fortunately, amongst them was one of Luo Bing’s people, and that person gave up their spot to Long Chen.

“Long Chen, will you really be alright? You should know that the exam is completely different from the God Institute’s,” said Luo Bing worriedly.

“To me, these are all minor affairs. Isn’t it just about control of Spiritual Strength and mental energy? As for hand seal techniques, I’m extremely familiar with them. Don’t worry. As long as no one targets me, I guarantee that I’ll pass. If there is someone targeting me, that would be even better. I’ll beat them until I pass. Oh, it’s starting, so I can’t talk for now. I’m going in. Oh, you can give this to that brother as compensation.” Long Chen tossed something to Luo Bing and rushed off.

Luo Bing shook her head. Long Chen always acted mysteriously. She then looked at the thing that Long Chen had given her and suddenly jumped.

“A top grade soul nourishing pill?!”

She couldn’t believe her eyes. Long Chen had actually handed over a top grade soul nourishing pill? Such a thing was practically impossible to find.

This kind of pill was often used by the Pill Institute’s disciples, and most of them could only use low grade pills. Using middle grade pills would be luxurious, and those capable of using high grade pills were definitely as rare as a phoenix feather or qilin horn. Even Luo Bing only used middle grade soul nourishing pills.

This top grade soul nourishing pill was something that she had only heard of but never seen. Such a pill was worth tens of thousands of immortal crystals. Who could afford to repeatedly use them?

“A top grade soul nourishing pill can not only nourish the soul all the way to its deepest core but also stimulate it to grow once more, strengthening the Spiritual Strength. Long Chen’s quite generous,” sighed Luo Bing.

“This fellow tosses it out like it is nothing, while others treat every single one as a treasure. Has this fellow suddenly struck gold? Or did he sell that Heavenly Flame seed?” guessed Luo Ning.

Luo Bing handed the top grade soul nourishing pill to that disciple, but the latter directly said that he didn’t want it. Luo Bing had no choice but to keep it for now. With everyone else, she went to the exam hall to await the results.

Luo Ning whispered, “Big sister, do you think that Long Chen will pass?”

Luo Bing shook her head. “It’s difficult to say. According to reason, the God Institute’s exam should be focused on the essence and qi, as that’s the foundation of using divine abilities, as well as their future development. But the Immortal Institute focuses on the qi and spirit. If the essence is too strong, it results in the qi growing while the spirit deteriorates. That’s why the Immortal Institute’s disciples mock the God Institute’s disciples for being simple-headed, while they mock us for having weak bodies. Long Chen’s body is like a wild dragon, and his Blood Qi is terrifying. He’s clearly a genius of the God path. But such powerful qi and essence will definitely limit his spirit. I don’t really think he has a high chance of passing. Furthermore, once the divine flame is ignited, the two follow completely different paths. I really can’t understand why he would make such a fuss just to get into the Immortal Institute as an instructor.”

Just at this moment, the sound of a bell rang out. It resounded three times, stunning Luo Ning.

“What’s going on? Isn’t it just one ring of the bell when the trial ends? Did the ringer get hit in the head?”

“Three strikes represent that someone passed with full marks…” said Luo Bing. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Just at this moment, Long Chen and a group of people walked out. Long Chen had a pleasant smile. He then cupped his fists toward Luo Bing and the others. “Thanks to everyone’s blessing, I passed with full marks.”

Luo Bing’s eyes widened. She couldn’t believe it. But Long Chen was with the examiners and the disciples who had come to take the test, and they were all looking at him like he was a monster.

“Are we all fools? Big sister, we forgot that Long Chen is also a Pill Institute disciple!” Luo Ning suddenly slapped her leg.

Only then did Luo Bing recover and bitterly smile. That was right. He was a Pill Institute disciple. Without powerful Spiritual Strength and mental energy, how could he refine pills?

“Long Chen’s essence, qi, and spirit are all so powerful? Isn’t it said that the heavens are imperfect, and humans all have advantages and disadvantages? You can only have two of the three talents. How can Long Chen be so strong in all three?” Luo Bing stared at Long Chen’s pleased smile with shock and bewilderment.

Just at this moment, another group of people walked out of the hall, and the disciples cried out in shock.

“Heaven Master Dong Ming!”

“Heavens, even Heaven Master Dong Ming has been disturbed!”

“Heaven Master Dong Ming is the head of the Immortal Institute’s four Heaven Masters! I heard that he hasn't revealed himself in over ten years, but he’s actually come out now!”

These disciples hastily bowed reverently toward this new group.

“Young friend Long Chen, this old man has been constantly hearing your stories for the past two months. You actually came to the Immortal Institute though. No matter what, I won’t let you go. Yun Yang is far too stingy, requiring a whole trial just for a set of robes! This old man is far more magnanimous. There’s no need for a trial. You can directly take your status plate.” Heaven Master Dong Ming walked over to Long Chen with a bright smile. It was like he had discovered a treasure.

“Then many thanks senior. I’m extremely reverent.” Long Chen also hadn’t expected to disturb a Heaven rank instructor the very first day he came to the Immortal Institute.

Furthermore, this elder’s eyes were clear and bright. His words fully matched his spiritual fluctuations. He was a direct and sincere person who said what he thought.

“You even dared to point and curse at the three bigwigs of the Discipline Institute. Do you think that I’ll believe those words? Hahaha, little fellow, properly grow in my Immortal Institute. I’ll give you the best benefits. To tell you the truth, last time I drank with Yun Yang, that fellow was so pleased that you fell into his hands that it irritated me. Little fellow, I won’t beat around the bush. I’m happy you came to the Immortal Institute. At the very least, I won’t have to see that old fellow Yun Yang show off in the future. If you encounter any difficulty in the Immortal Institute, you can come find me. As long as it’s not against the academy’s laws or rules, this old man will definitely help you resolve it,” promised Heaven Master Dong Ming.

Long Chen suddenly came to an understanding. It seemed that Heaven Master Dong Ming was old friends with Heaven Master Yun Yang. Although his tone did contain a trace of competitiveness, Long Chen could also tell that Heaven Master Dong Ming only treated him so well due to Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“Many thanks. Then could this little one take a look at the Immortal Scripture Pavilion?” Long Chen cupped his fists and directly got to his goal, the Immortal Scripture Pavilion.
