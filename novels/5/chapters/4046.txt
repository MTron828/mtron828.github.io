Chapter 4035 Must Kill

Long Chen was now worried. He suddenly realized that this plot was not planned by the eight empires. This huge scheme definitely had Enpuda behind it.

Only Enpuda would be so treacherous and capable of laying such a trap.

Everything had been a preparation. Even the Nether River Sacrificial Ceremony was a cover.

In order to achieve his goal, Enpuda had not just called over the Kunpeng race, Alldevil race, Blood race, and Netherworld race, but he had even dragged Liao Bencang into it.

When Long Chen killed Liao Bencang, as long as the latter’s faith energy remained, he could still be reborn. However, this time, he was truly dead, not because of Long Chen's actions, but due to Enpuda's cunning scheme.

Enpuda had craftily used Liao Bencang's life as a stepping stone to set the foundation for an even grander scheme, one that was aimed directly at Yu Qingxuan. Learning of this, Long Chen's heart turned ice-cold, but an overwhelming fury surged within him.

The realization that even Liao Bencang's death was part of Enpuda's calculated plan demonstrated the sheer terror and complexity of this treacherous trap.

Long Chen blamed himself. After cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, he got so confident that he neglected to consider this terrifying opponent.

“Enpuda, this time, I will not let you live any longer!”

Long Chen tore through the air, icy killing-intent filling him.

He knew that Enpuda was truly frightening. In comparison, Liao Bencang was no match for him, neither in terms of power nor intelligence. The vast disparity between them was evident, as Liao Bencang wouldn't have fallen victim to Enpuda's schemes if he stood on the same level as this cunning adversary.

This time, Long Chen was truly enraged. So, despite knowing that Enpuda was terrifying and had definitely come amply prepared, Long Chen had made his determination. He had to kill this scourge.

After all, Enpuda had touched Long Chen’s reverse scale, daring to target Yu Qingxuan. That made Long Chen crazy.

Long Chen flew through the air, space twisting around him. It was like he was passing through a spacetime channel, and he quickly arrived at the capital.

The capital had lost its former brilliance. The runes on the buildings were dark and dim, akin to a city of death.

Above the capital were two pitch-black spatial gates. One of them was emitting raging flames that could burn all things, to the point that even the laws of the Heavenly Daos were set ablaze.

Those black flames emitted terrifying divine might, and Long Chen instantly recognized its aura. It was the Yan Xu Flame, so this gate was the Yan Xu Gate.

The other gate was darker and more sinister, filled with death qi. This was the gate that had a strange flower on it.

Moreover, this peculiar flower possessed dozens of petals, each slender and elongated, resembling leaves yet not quite. Strangely, it did not entirely resemble a typical flower either. In its center, there were stamens that resembled the sinister eyes of a fiend, giving it an eerie and enigmatic aura.

This flower was the red spider lily, also known as the legendary Paramita Flower. It was said that when the Paramita Flower appeared, the gates of hell would open. In other words, this gate was the true hell gate.

Between the Yan Xu Gate and the hell gate was the Vermilion Bird Capital. At this moment, Yu Xiaoyun, Jiang Huixin, Xu Lanxin, and countless other experts of the Vermilion Bird Empire were gathered up in the air above the capital.

They stared coldly at the endless sea of experts surrounding them. These experts included the Empire Lords of the Violet Thunderclap Empire, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire, and the Eastern Light Empire. There were hundreds of experts on the level of three-flower Earth Venerates present.

Amongst them, two in particular stood out. One of them was the Bloodkill Hall’s Enpuda.

As for the other one, he was the one that infuriated the Vermilion Bird Empire the most. Yu Qingxuan in particular was filled with disbelief when looking at him.

“Dongfang Zichu! I treated you like a brother, and I entrusted my daughter to your teachings! Haha, I really never thought that I, Yu Xiaoyun, would be so blind!” Yu Xiaoyun glared furiously at the man standing beside Enpuda.

This person was precisely the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect’s master and Yu Xiaoyun’s master, Dongfang Zichu. No one had expected him to appear here and even stand on the side of Enpuda and Weng Taibei.

Jiang Huixin pointed her finger at Dongfang Zichu, clenching her teeth furiously. “Dongfang Zichu, we entrusted you to seal the Nether Emperor’s seal in Qingxuan’s body! But you were duping us the entire time! If you refused to help, why didn’t you decline? Why did you make such a solemn oath? You made us part with our flesh and blood for so many years, and still destiny cannot be escaped. If we had known, we would have had Qingxuan grow up with us. We would have seen her grow up. You… you are abominable!”

Even though she was the empress, Jiang Huixin was too overwhelmed by emotion to care about decorum now. She was sobbing, and Yu Qingxuan held her. Looking from her enraged father to her heartbroken mother, Yu Qingxuan didn’t even know what was going on.

In front of their fury, Dongfang Zichu indifferently said, “My apologies. People are all ambitious. When you sent Qingxuan over, I received a mission from the great Yan Xu. Rather than wasting energy on the seal, it would be better for the master of destiny to awaken sooner. When Qinguxan obtained the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, my mission was complete.”

Just then, the nine heavens quivered and the void exploded. Killing intent filled this space, covering the heavens. It was as if the heavens were about to collapse.

Within that furious killing intent, a roar rang out. “In other words, in the Heavenly Flame World, when Qingxuan was targeted by Yan Xu’s son, it was no coincidence but arranged by you?!”

Following that, a vengeful and murderous Long Chen appeared in the air. His black hair and robes billowed around him, giving him the appearance of a furious killing god, ready to unleash his fury upon his foes.

“Long Chen!”

When Yu Qingxuan saw Long Chen, she could no longer hold back her tears. Her heart was kind, but that didn’t mean that she was dumb; it was the opposite. She was exceptionally intelligent, and as soon as she heard their words, she knew the truth.

Long Chen appeared in front of Yu Qingxuan. Just like that, in front of everyone, he tightly held her.

“Long Chen, how can this be?!”

Yu Qingxuan wept in Long Chen’s embrace, unable to accept this reality. Her beloved master had used her so that Yan Hong could absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame?

Seeing her crying like a child, Long Chen’s heart was wracked by sharp pain. His fury surged and he turned to Dongfang Zichu. His hatred toward Dongfang Zichu might have even surpassed his hatred for Enpuda at this moment.

In front of that murderous gaze, Dongfang Zichu merely smiled.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I really didn’t expect you to be able to kill Liao Bencang. But you didn’t know that by killing Liao Bencang, you have also killed Yu Qingxuan, your beloved woman.”

“My beloved woman will not die. As for you, you won’t see tomorrow’s sun.”

Long Chen spat out every word with power. Each word was like the hammer of a god, striking this land to the point that it quivered.

This was a challenge, as well as an oath. Long Chen was determined to kill Dongfang Zichu here!
