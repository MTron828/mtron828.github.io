Chapter 3814 Skeleton

BOOM!

Long Chen’s black dagger stabbed into the barrier. As a result, the barrier was pierced through, and a giant hole appeared.

Mo Nian and the others were delighted. They were just about to charge through when Long Chen held them back.

Buzz.

That giant hole instantly sealed. It appeared for no more than the blink of an eye.

“What?! This is way too short! We won’t be able to get through!” Mo Nian’s expression changed.

What if the barrier devoured them right while they were in the middle of passing it? Then they would be doomed. Who knew what terrifying thing would happen to them then?

“How about this? I’ll go in first. I have the original devil race’s secret art, and I’ll have enough time to get to the other side. Xia Chen, give me a formation disc and prepare to do a spatial transportation. Once I’m on the other side, activate the formation disc to transport everyone over,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

“Are you sure?” Long Chen wasn’t too happy with that plan. If something happened, none of them could accept the consequences.

“Trust me.” Yue Xiaoqian smiled sweetly at Long Chen. She was full of confidence.

BOOM!

Long Chen took a deep breath. He once more stabbed the dagger into the Heavenly Dao Bewilderment Barrier, and it was once more pierced through. This time, he used even more power than last time. Just as he thought that he could buy a bit more time for Yue Xiaoqian to pass through, it suddenly slammed shut just like last time. The path was still the same size as last time, and the time to cross was still just as short.

“Xiaoqian!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. He wanted to tell Yue Xiaoqian to give up, but she was already moving. Her body shot through the path, surrounded by countless phantoms.

When the channel slammed shut, Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. He was afraid of something happening to her. That had been far too little time. He wasn’t even able to see if she had managed to get through in time.

“Big sister Xiaoqian is fine, and the formation disc has been set. Everyone, prepare yourselves. I’m going to activate the transportation formation,” said Xia Chen with delight.

Hearing that, they all sighed with relief. They really had been worried just now.

“Long Chen, you should save some energy. I feel like the reason you can create a path isn’t because of your own power. It is some special power of that dagger. The size of the path has nothing to do with your own power,” said Mo Nian.

Long Chen nodded. He had everyone prepare, and once they were ready and transportation runes appeared around them, Long Chen once more stabbed the dagger forward.

BOOM!

Just as Mo Nian said, this time, he didn’t use any power. After that, the Heavenly Dao Bewilderment Barrier shook, and a hole appeared, the exact same size as before. Clearly, his ability to create a hole had nothing to do with himself.

Long Chen’s vision changed just as the channel appeared. He then arrived in a peaceful world. Yue Xiaoqian was waiting for them.

After passing through the Heavenly Dao Bewilderment Barrier, Long Chen found that this place was completely different from the outside world’s environment. There were skeletons everywhere, but they weren’t eroded by time. There was no flying sand and dust. The entire world was so quiet that it was nerve-wracking.

This world was a world of death. There was no sound. They looked around and only saw endless skeletons. The only things that they could hear were their own nervous heartbeats.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

No one spoke. This place was so silent that it was terrifying. They were afraid of breaking that silence.

Crack.

Suddenly, Guo Ran moved his foot, only to step on a bone. As a result, that bone shattered. That sound was exceptionally loud in this silent world.

During normal times, it might be nothing. But here, it was like thunder, making everyone jump.

“Sorry, I…” Guo Ran hastily apologized.

“Everyone, calm down. I often come to places like this. We’re very safe,” comforted Mo Nian.

Long Chen then squatted down and picked up the bone that Guo Ran had stepped on. Looking at the marks on it, he said, “This is the bone of a human expert. It seems to be an arm bone. And for it to be preserved even after so much time has passed, it might be a Supreme Bone. The aura hasn’t fully vanished. Most likely, it was a Divine Venerate. A Supreme Divine Venerate would definitely have limitless glory when they were alive. But after dying, they can’t even keep their corpse intact. The cultivation path really is one of no return.”

Long Chen sighed inside. Supreme experts were born due to the flow of karmic luck in this world. They should not be taken to be ordinary simply due to there being plenty of Supreme heavenly geniuses running around in the three thousand worlds now. This was due to the workings of the Heavenly Daos.

Supreme heavenly geniuses sprouted in rapid succession one after another right now, but that was because they had been born at the right time. Without it being the right time, not a single one might be born in ages.

Of all the Divine Venerates that Long Chen had encountered, almost none of them were Supreme experts. Currently, the only ones he suspected of being Supreme experts were Xia Guhong, Dongfang Zichu, and Weng Taibei. Other than them, perhaps Silver Moon City’s lord was also a Supreme expert.

However, which one of them wasn’t an absolute monster? Which of them wasn’t an almighty expert that could look down on the rest of the world?

Even so, such an expert had actually died here, their corpse rotting away. It made him feel sorrowful. Just where was the end of the cultivation path?

“Boss, this is a winged devil!”

Guo Ran suddenly saw a giant skeleton in the distance. This skeleton was perfectly intact. It still gave off a terrifying remnant aura.

This winged devil was three meters tall. It had a pair of bone wings on its back, and those bone wings still had intact runes. They hadn’t been destroyed over time. That could only mean that this was a pair of Supreme Bones in the form of bone wings. This winged devil had also been a Supreme expert.

This skeleton was perfectly preserved. Its wings were spread, and it was kneeling on the ground. There was a sword stuck in its head, directly piercing it. This was clearly the killing blow.

When Long Chen pulled the sword out of its skull, he saw that it was covered in rust.

Buzz.

With a swing, that rust fell, revealing a bright sword. When this sword quivered, space boomed and threads of killing intent appeared.

“A treasure of a sword!”

Long Chen couldn’t help praising this sword. It was a World Domain divine item. Although its quality wasn’t on par with the Minghong Saber, what was rare was that it possessed its own overflowing killing intent.

It had produced its own consciousness. Moreover, it had inherited the will of its master. This was a true divine weapon for slaughter.

According to reason, without the nourishment of the soul of its master, this sword’s will should have slowly faded until it vanished.

However, this sword actually absorbed the skeleton’s energy to prevent the decay of time, allowing it to be perfectly preserved. It was just like a warrior that had suffered through indignity and humiliation in order to fulfill their duty. Thus, Long Chen praised it as a good sword.

The sword buzzed in his hands as if expressing something. Long Chen nodded in response. “My Dragonblood Legion is full of hot-blooded men who are unafraid of death. I’ll definitely find you a suitable master.”

With that, Long Chen put away the sword. This was their first harvest in the heavenly tomb. As expected, after investing so much effort, there were great gains to be found.

“Someone’s coming!”

Suddenly, Mo Nian, who was in the midst of looking around, cried out.
