Chapter 2153 Ximen Tianxiong

“What’s with the Corrupt God’s corpse?” asked Mo Nian.

When Beitang Rushuang explained it, Long Chen and Mo Nian both jumped in shock. The Corrupt God’s corpse had laid within the Corrupt God Cemetery all this time.

In truth, throughout the Corrupt path’s history, there had been many ‘Corrupt Gods’ to ascend. Those ascenders left behind their own mortal skulls, essence blood, or some other inheritance objects as they ascended.

However, those were not the true Corrupt God. They could be considered the heirs of the true Corrupt God’s Dao.

The true first generation Corrupt God had left his complete mortal corpse buried within the Corrupt God Cemetery for future generations of the Corrupt path to worship.

Future experts of the Corrupt path that managed to ascend had their bodies buried inside there as well so that they could continue to accompany the Corrupt God.

Legend was that the Corrupt God Cemetery was where the Corrupt path’s karmic luck was gathered. It was the strongest foundation for the Corrupt path, and there was an unimaginable amount of divine energy gathered inside.

If it was forced awake, then that corpse would probably absorb all the Corrupt path’s karmic luck to strengthen itself and then destroy the world. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is it really so terrifying?” Long Chen and Mo Nian couldn’t help asking. This had exceeded their expectations.

“It is. Even when the Corrupt path was in a weak state, the Righteous path did not dare to force them into despair because the entire world is afraid of the Corrupt God Cemetery. That is why they can run rampant and slaughter with the Righteous path only being able to defend. They cannot strike deep into the heart of the Corrupt path,” said Nangong Zuiyue.

“Alright, then we’ll shelve this matter. We’ll go once we’re stronger. No matter what, I have to go take a look at the Corrupt path’s ancestral tomb. This is my target, my belief, my life’s greatest challenge!” Mo Nian clenched his fists and swore an oath.

Even Nangong Zuiyue couldn’t help shaking her head. Had Mo Nian gotten addicted to graverobbing?

“Alright, remember to call me when the time comes.” Long Chen nodded. The Corrupt path was a group of brainwashed madmen. He also wanted to see what the founder of this brainwashed organization looked like.

“Go then. Have the Corrupt God’s corpse bite you to death,” said Beitang Rushuang irritably.

“Being bitten to death is better than being choked to death,” Long Chen mumbled to himself and glanced at Beitang Rushuang’s chest.

Beitang Rushuang was lightning quick. Her fingers were like hooks clawing at Long Chen’s arm, but this time, Long Chen was prepared and slipped away like a mud fish.

Long Chen laughed inside. Did she think he would fall for the same move twice? When he was on guard, Beitang Rushuang wouldn’t be able to grab him so easily.

“You shouldn’t keep fighting. Dongfang Yuyang has arrived,” said Nangong Zuiyue.

Long Chen saw a group of people slowly walking out of a flying boat that had just arrived. They caused quite a disturbance.

Dongfang Yuyang was as handsome as ever. He nodded toward the maidens who cheered at his arrival. With his warm smile and pure white robes, it went without saying that he was truly elegant.

Behind Dongfang Yuyang were thirty-some disciples of the Dongfang family. Every one of them was very young, but they were fully awakened Empyreans.

“The Stone race’s people have also come.”

Quiet voices rang out, and as expected, Long Chen looked over to see a group of large figures walking over. Long Chen immediately recognized the one-eyed Shi Lingfeng.

Shi Lingfeng also saw Long Chen, and his remaining eye smoldered with hatred.

“It seems that he’s become much stronger.” Long Chen was a bit surprised. His spiritual perception was telling him that Shi Lingfeng was more frightening than before.

“He has most likely started inheriting the Stone Emperor’s abilities. You should be careful around him. He’ll only get stronger,” warned Nangong Zuiyue quietly.

Long Chen nodded. These ancient powers definitely couldn’t be underestimated. Their foundations were extremely profound.

“The Pill Fairy has also come,” said Mo Nian. Looking at Long Chen, he sighed inside. Originally, he had thought that the two of them would end up together, but the Pill Fairy had gone from a kind person to a cold killer who wanted Long Chen dead.

Following the Pill Fairy were the disciples of Pill Valley. The surprising thing was that these disciples were covered in divine flames and exceptionally fierce auras. They were all powerful flame cultivators.

“When did Pill Valley get so many powerful Empyreans?” Long Chen was shocked. Each of these disciples was like a volcano ready to explode. Such powerful experts had not been present during the Brahma secret realm. If it was just one or two, Long Chen could understand as hiding one’s trump cards was normal. But there were over thirty of them, and they were all awakened Empyreans. This couldn’t be accidental. Their auras were all steady like they had awakened their manifestations a long while ago.

Long Chen looked at them. Although they seemed young, there was a certain look in their eyes, one that spoke of times past.

“Experts sealed during the ancient era.” Long Chen’s heart shook as he guessed the origin of these experts.

The Pill Fairy didn’t speak to anyone. She only glanced at Long Chen before finding a spot for herself, and someone set up a chair for her to sit in.

A few people had been standing in that general area, but they immediately scattered once the Pill Fairy went over, giving her a very wide space.

“She came to kill me.” Long Chen had a helpless expression.

“How do you know?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“The two of us control the same flame. Hence, the killing intent inside her can be sensed by my flame. Now I understand why Jian Wuchen would challenge Yue Zifeng at this time,” sighed Long Chen. The gaze in his eyes grew sharper.

“You mean they’re working together to target you?” asked Mo Nian.

“Most likely. Or they want to kill two birds with one stone,” said Long Chen.

“Don’t worry, with your brother here, no one will be able to touch you.” Mo Nian patted his chest.

“You have more enemies than me. If a fight starts, I’ll probably be dragged down by you,” said Long Chen.

“Long Chen!”

Suddenly, a familiar voice rang out. Ye Lingshan had also come, bringing with her thirty disciples wearing the robes of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

These disciples were also awakened Empyreans. However, their auras were clearly weaker, and they were fluctuating a bit.

Long Chen knew that these disciples had just awakened their manifestations recently, and they had relied on medicinal pills.

However, the pills that they had used weren’t ones refined by him. They had been refined by the Huayun Sect.

The Huayun Sect also had medicinal pills that could help an Empyrean awaken. However, their pills couldn’t compare to a top grade Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill, nor were they tribulation pills. Each person would need to consume ten of these pills to greatly improve their chance of awakening their manifestation.

The Huayun Sect had announced the matter of these pills, which caused quite some waves. The fact that they had the power to refine eleventh tier pills was shocking, and with that ability, they had helped raise a new batch of experts for the Martial Heaven Alliance.

These thirty disciples had become the perfect billboards for the Huayun sect. Wherever they went, they silently spread words of the Huayun Sect’s power.

The Huayun Sect was finally making a move and starting to stand on an equal level with Pill Valley in the medicinal pill market. Moreover, they also started wrestling away the business of the high grade treasures. Countless sects that had once conducted business with them were bearing witness to the Huayun Sect’s true power.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!”

Those disciples immediately bowed toward Long Chen worshipfully. Although Ye Lingshan was the future leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance, Long Chen was the pillar lifting that alliance up.

“I remember you. In the Yin Yang World, you took a saber attack to protect your brother. Well done.” Long Chen nodded toward one of those disciples and raised a thumb.

That person had a long scar on his face, which had been left there by a blade from a Corrupt path’s expert. The insidious energy contained within it had left a scar on his face permanently.

Long Chen still remembered it, as it had left quite an impression on him to see a disciple of the Martial Heaven Alliance take a blow for a fellow disciple.

As a result, that disciple was moved beyond words just by the fact that Long Chen remembered him. Long Chen patted him on the shoulder. There was no need to say any more.

The other disciples were also moved. In their eyes, Long Chen was a true hero, someone in touch with the common people. In their hearts, he was already like a god.

Compared to other experts that gave off a cold feeling of aloofness, they preferred the likes of Long Chen and Mo Nian who didn’t care about their status. They were unconstrained by such affairs.

“Long Chen, my master warns you to be cautious. She feels like this challenge is too sudden,” said Ye Lingshan to him quietly after greeting Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue.

“Hey, miss Lingshan, are you ignoring me? I’m so big. Is it possible that you didn’t see me?” asked an aggrieved Mo Nian. Ye Lingshan had forgotten to greet him.

Ye Lingshan merely glared at him, indicating for him to not interrupt. Long Chen nodded. “Yes, I feel the same way.”

Just at this moment, rumbling rang out from the sky. A giant war chariot came flying over like a shooting star.

“It’s the Ximen family’s Heaven Piercing War Chariot. Ximen Tianxiong must have come,” said Beitang Rushuang, startled.
