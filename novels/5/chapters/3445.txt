Chapter 3434 Divine Saber Minghong

The experts that could be here watching were the leaders of the various races or pillars of their races. Even the weakest was a late stage Immortal King. The only reason a late stage Immortal King was allowed was due to their power and prestige.

There were millions of them present. Demonic beasts favored heavy weapons, so they were fond of sabers, broadswords, spears, pikes, hatchets, warhammers, etc.

Amongst these experts were several hundred saber users. So, following Long Chen’s cry, the sabers on their backs and waists seemed to receive some sort of summons. They quivered, seemingly expressing their loyalty to Long Chen, as if they thirsted to enter his hands.

With the support of the core of the Integral Heaven Star-Field, Long Chen’s senses were extended, and he sensed countless sabers. So, he was calling out to them, seeing which of them was willing to fight with him.

A saber then flew out of the hand of a half-step World King. Just as he grabbed it again, that saber seemed to come to life. Its edge then turned, cutting off his wrist before it flew into the heavenly tribulation.

Just at this moment, eight Wu Yings charged at Long Chen and Water Qi filled the air. Moreover, space twisted as if this place was the depths of a sea.

The saber then entered Long Chen’s hand. Ignoring the others, Long Chen thrust it at one of the Wu Yings.

As a result, blood splashed. The nine-foot saber pierced through Wu Ying’s chest, and the other water-thorns in the hands of her clones smashed into Long Chen’s body. However, they merely caused some sparks to fly out, unable to break his golden dragon armor.

“You think yourself smart, but your head isn’t good. You decided to learn the body-splitting arts of the human race. Sure, the body can be split, but can a weapon be split as well? Distinguishing which weapon is real is far easier than finding the real body,” said Long Chen contemptuously.

Wu Ying was simply an arrogant fool. The way she split her body was not flawed. Against demonic beasts, they truly wouldn’t be able to tell which was the real one.

However, with Long Chen’s powerful Spiritual Strength, he could easily grasp the true body’s Blood Qi and spiritual fluctuations.

Even if he couldn’t sense that though, the weapons of her clones were fake. She couldn’t trick him regardless.

“I…”

Wu Ying had been full of confidence, so she hadn’t expected Long Chen to break her Water Dao Domain with a casual blow and accurately pinpoint her true body. With the true body injured, the power of the clones plummeted to the point where they couldn’t even break Long Chen’s defenses. Now, she was terrified.

“You look down on the human race, yet learn the human race’s techniques. You look down on me, but die to my hands. Go in peace!” said Long Chen coldly.

“No… don’t kill me…!”

Wu Ying’s body exploded. However, what killed her wasn’t Long Chen but the heavenly genius of the Golden Barbarian Bull race. He had attacked from behind Long Chen in a sneak attack, attempting to save her. However, Long Chen just flung Wu Ying’s body behind him, resulting in her smashing into the vajra scepter. As a result, she was directly blown to bits.

The Golden Barbarian Bull race’s expert was shocked and enraged. It had been too late for him to even hold back his power.

“Don’t feel bad, you’ll be accompanying her!”

Long Chen raised his saber and then slashed it down like a bolt of lightning. After that, countless runes lit up on the saber, and a dragon roar rang out of it.

“Dodge!”

The eighth prince cried out in shock and stabbed his spear at Long Chen. He saw that the Golden Barbarian Bull race’s expert had used up his power after killing Wu Ying.

Regretfully, Long Chen didn’t give that Golden Barbarian Bull any chance to dodge. Long Chen had already locked onto him, and golden light exploded along with blood mist. The golden vajra scepter was broken by Long Chen’s saber. Furthermore, the wielder was directly blown to bits.

After killing him, Long Chen’s saber spun through the air, perfectly blocking the eighth prince’s late attempt to save his companion.

After that, the eighth prince was forced back three steps before he managed to stabilize himself. He was shocked.

He had absorbed a huge amount of thunderforce, and his body was essentially fully satiated. If he left the heavenly tribulation, he would instantly become a Divine Lord.

Despite not having made that final breakthrough, his power had increased by over ten times. With his spear and manifestation resonating, his power was unimaginable. However, his attack just now seemed to have struck a star. Long Chen didn’t stagger in the slightest. Instead, it was him who almost coughed up blood from the exchange.

After blowing back the eighth prince, Long Chen didn’t chase him. Instead, he slowly raised his saber for a look.

The saber blade was nine feet long, while the hilt was one and a half feet. Its body was blood-red, and its style was very ancient. Moreover, this blood color contained a sharp killing intent. This was definitely a divine weapon that had killed countless lifeforms.

Furthermore, there were two Jiuli immortal characters carved into its hilt. They were third-generation Jiuli characters, Ming Hong.[1]

The entire saber was blood-red, but these two characters in particular were as red as fresh blood that had just come out of the body. Long Chen sensed the aura of the dragon race from these two characters. They were engraved with dragon blood.

“No wonder it feels so familiar.” Staring at this saber, Long Chen smiled. The saber felt heavy in his hand. It perfectly suited his current power.

Furthermore, with its length, it felt very comfortable to use. Most importantly, this Minghong Saber’s item-spirit felt extremely close to Long Chen. It was a top grade King item.

This half-step World King of the demonic beast race had obtained it countless years ago. He had been carrying it on his back all this time but had never used it. That was because he had never managed to subdue the dragon will on it.

The reason he had carried it on his back all day long was a display of his status. He would occasionally show it off to others, showing others that he was a stunning figure capable of controlling a weapon with a dragon soul.

However, never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined that this saber would actually fly toward Long Chen. Furthermore, it had even cut off his hand. Most likely, this fellow was so enraged he would cough up blood.

Ever since losing Dragonbone Evilmoon, Long Chen had never felt so accustomed to a saber, the feeling of man and saber being one. He finally had a companion that could fight alongside him again.

Just then, countless fiend spirits pounced on him. Although they were imitations made out of lightning, they appeared the exact same as when he saw them in the Netherworld.

With them filling the battlefield, the eighth prince and the others had no choice but to fight them as well as defend against Long Chen.

Long Chen’s saber then swept out and a dragon cry rang out once more. Everything in his way instantly vanished. Those fiend spirits turned into lightning runes with no suspense at all.

Furthermore, those lightning runes disappeared as soon as they appeared, as if they were silently absorbed by something.

“The old feeling is finally back.”

At this moment, battle intent burned in Long Chen’s eyes excitedly. He suddenly raised his saber. Thereafter, a giant saber-image pierced the tribulation clouds, and the entire world shuddered. A will to split apart heaven and earth soared, causing the nine heavens to change color. It was a will that caused gods and devils to quiver.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Split the Heavens!”

In front of countless stunned gazes, a giant blade cleaved apart the tribulation clouds and mercilessly slashed down upon the eighth prince and the others.

[1] The Minghong Saber (鸣鸿刀) is a legendary sword of Chinese mythology. The legend does not seem relevant at the moment, but to summarize: When the Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan forged his golden sword, there were still some leftover materials in the furnace. The high heat melted those materials, and they took the form of a saber at the bottom of the furnace after cooling off. The Yellow Emperor thought that its saber will was too strong, and it would consume anyone who tried to use it. Worried about it falling into the mortal world, he chose to destroy it. However, it transformed into a red skylark and flew off, vanishing amongst the clouds.
