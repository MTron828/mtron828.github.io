Chapter 4721 Not Missing a Single Drop of Water

“What is it?” asked both Long Chen and Guo Ran when they saw Xia Chen’s expression.

“These fellows are even craftier than I thought. Their headquarters is not located within the islands,” replied Xia Chen.

“It’s not here? Did that bastard lie to us?” raged Guo Ran.

“No, I don’t think so. I think he also doesn’t know the truth. Look, this is the surface of the world, but in reality, there is a spatial gate beneath one of the islands. It should lead to a minor world, which is their real secret headquarters,” said Xia Chen.

“Is it the place where the light spots are most concentrated?” asked Guo Ran, examining the map closely.

“No, they’re too crafty for that. This should be a trap specifically set up to trick formation masters. Their secret entrance should be here.” Xia Chen pointed to an island without a single spot of light on it.

“How can that be? They don’t leave a single person there?” Guo Ran couldn’t believe it.

“Perhaps their guards also have a way to screen off Heavenly Dao energy,” answered Long Chen.

“Boss is correct. For assassins that rely entirely on scheming, they must have a way to screen themselves from the Heavenly Daos. Perhaps a few aura-concealing masks are all they need. After all, they have set up a trap specifically for formation masters, so it’s not strange for them to have such a thing. I’d say that all the sentries spread throughout this region were actually bait,” mentioned Xia Chen.

“Damn, they really are crafty! It won’t be easy to deal with them. Once we’re exposed, everyone in the minor world will run. Given their characters, there must be more than one way in and out of that minor world. We won’t be able to catch them. Most hateful of all, they’ll definitely empty their treasury before leaving!” Guo Ran started to get anxious. After all, he had been eyeing their weapons for a long time.

“Don’t panic. Let me think,” said Xia Chen. However, he didn’t hope much as these fellows were just too difficult to deal with.

Long Chen’s goal was not just to kill a few people. Having mobilized the entire Dragonblood Legion, he wanted to annihilate all these assassins in one go. Letting one get away was a failure to him.

“There’s still a few hours until the show starts. Let’s keep observing,” said Long Chen.

According to that fellow, there would be a large group gathering here. Hence, there should be some kind of disturbance in this area.

Time passed bit by bit, but the disturbance was nowhere to be found. Even Xia Chen was growing impatient. While he might be able to endure, his formation discs couldn’t. In another hour, he’d run out of these formation discs.

The main thing was that he didn’t dare to stop his surveillance even for a moment, afraid of missing some important detail. Sweat dripped from his forehead, but there was nothing he could do. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Something’s wrong. Xia Chen, switch your observation method. Don’t sense the Heavenly Dao fluctuations, sense the changes in air current,” suggested Long Chen.

“That method won’t tell me the movement of Doyens. Furthermore, air currents won’t show much information,” retorted Xia Chen.

“I also don’t understand what’s happening, so just try it out,” replied Long Chen.

As Xia Chen switched formation discs, the light spots on the map vanished. All of a sudden, he suddenly let out a startled cry. “Impossible! So many people are moving at the same time!”

Although he didn’t see anyone on the map, he could see the faintest spatial twists that were normally the result of wind. However, the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea had neither wind nor other lifeforms. The only ones that could be moving here were experts of the Lifehunter race.

When Xia Chen switched to this kind of sense, he could see countless currents gathering toward the suspicious island.

“So they have a special means to block their Doyen aura and have long since started moving!” exclaimed Guo Ran.

“Now what? Should we attack directly? Kill as many as we can?” asked Guo Ran. Although there was no way to tell the exact numbers, based on all the air currents, there were definitely many experts here.

“They’re screening off their Doyen power...” Long Chen sank into thought and suddenly slapped his leg.

“I’ve got it!”

“Boss, what is it?” Xia Chen and Guo Ran were both delighted.

“They are using a special mask unique to the Lifehunter race to cover their Doyen power. In other words, someone who can conceal their Doyen power can easily slip into their ranks!” explained Long Chen.

“What? That’ll never work. They definitely know how to recognize each other. Most likely, they can tell based on their bloodline. Such a thing is next to impossible to replicate,” said Xia Chen, shaking his head.

“No problem. Leave it to me!” exclaimed Long Chen.

“Boss, are you planning on muddling your way in?” asked Guo Ran.

“What? Are you afraid for me?” Long Chen counterasked.

“I’m not. The main thing is how many people of the Lifehunter race we can kill. They’ve long since known how you look like. How could they not recognize you?” replied Guo Ran.

“Not a problem. I have my own means. Xia Chen, if I can slip into that minor world, how should I break the transportation formations?” asked Long Chen.

“Boss, if you really can slip in, all you need to do is detonate this spatial formation disc,” answered Xia Chen as he handed over a formation disc. “That will disturb the spatial laws of that place, and it will last for a few breaths. But once you detonate it, it will be the signal for us to charge in. Then I’ll make sure they can’t activate any transportation formations.”

“However, don’t act rashly! First figure out where the treasuries are!” reminded Guo Ran.

Long Chen shook his head. “That will be difficult. Our top priority is to kill them as quickly as possible when the time comes. We’ll kill them so fast they can’t destroy their treasures in time. Whether we can actually obtain the treasures will be up to luck.”

They didn’t have that much time, so there was no time for more arrangements. Within the Dragonblood Legion, only Long Chen and Yue Zifeng weren’t Heavenly Doyens, so both of them could slip in.

However, Yue Zifeng was a sword cultivator, the bane of all assassins. No matter how well a cat disguised itself, it wouldn't pass as a mouse. They would instantly tell that he was a sword cultivator.

In that case, the only one capable of doing this was Long Chen, and whether or not he could slip in would be up to luck. However, even if he did get in, it would be very difficult for him to find the treasuries.

The location of the treasuries would definitely be top secret in the Lifehunter race, known to only a few people. That was why Long Chen didn’t want Guo Ran to get his hopes up.

“Alright, wait for my signal. If it’s a failure, we’ll only be able to charge in and kill as many as we can,” conveyed Long Chen before vanishing.
