Chapter 4252 Eating Too Much

The Heavenly Tiger race actually had two major branches: one stationed in the life-forbidden area and the other stationed in the Thousand Gate Snow Mountain.

For the Sage King Convention, both branches had made plans to come together. However, the branch from the life-forbidden area had arrived at the meeting spot and waited for a long time, but the Snow Mountain’s branch failed to show up. After that, they were unable to find them.

Now hearing that this branch had encountered the Barbarian race, the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts were enraged.

“We didn’t kill them.” That Barbarian warrior shook his head.

“Then where are they?”

“Here.” The warrior pointed at Wilde’s stomach.

“What are you talking about?” demanded the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts.

“Our king ate them. Three hundred thousand tigers were consumed. He ate to the point of bursting, which is why he’s been sleeping for ten days,” said the warrior.

The Dragonblood warriors’ jaws dropped. They were well aware of Wilde’s appetite, but to have devoured three hundred thousand demonic beasts? It was an astonishing feat beyond their wildest expectations.

However, all the Barbarian race’s experts seemed like the honest sort. They didn't come across as individuals who would fabricate such a claim.

The people outside the martial stage were dumbfounded as well. That was the Heavenly Tiger race they were talking about. Their branch had to have dispatched multiple innate Heaven Venerates and thousands of World Kings to stand guard over their group. How could they all be eaten? How could they believe that?

“You’re spouting bullshit!” roared the Heavenly Tiger race’s expert.

“No, our Barbarian race doesn’t spout bullshit. It’s barbarian shit,” said the Barbarian race’s warrior openly.

“You…!” That Heavenly Tiger expert quivered with rage, believing that he was being deliberately taunted. However, in truth, he was wrongly blaming this pure warrior. The Barbarian race’s people didn’t have the brain capacity for that.

“Brother, what’s your name?” Guo Ran particularly liked this group of Barbarian experts.

“I’m called Windy. When my mother gave birth to me, the wind was particularly strong, so she called me Windy,” said the Barbarian warrior a bit awkwardly, scratching his head.

That appearance was practically identical to that of Wilde, so those familiar with Wilde instantly felt close to this Barbarian warrior.

“Hey, what is your Barbarian race doing? Are you planning on joining Long Chen’s side and becoming enemies with all of us?” shouted Ye Wuchen.

Windy shook his head. “I don’t know. Our leader already told us to listen to our king, and our king has said to listen to his Brother Long for everything.”

“What kind of nonsense is that?” Ye Wuchen frowned. He didn’t even understand what this Barbarian warrior was saying.

“Sorry, my head is slow. I don’t really know how to explain it. Why don’t you wait for our king to wake up? Then you can just ask him yourselves,” said Windy apologetically.

“Shut up! Since you want to stand on that side, just await your death!” shouted someone impatiently.

Although the Barbarian race had a terrifying reputation, these warriors looked like fools. Hence, despite being frighteningly large, they didn’t seem threatening.

“Thank you for your care. Our Barbarian race likes eating meat and we have large appetites. We have plenty of fat, so we won’t starve to death,” said Windy obediently.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Looking at his sincere appearance, Bai Shishi and the others almost burst into laughter. As for the one speaking, he gritted his teeth in rage, thinking that Windy was intentionally making fun of him.

“Brother Windy, don’t waste words on him. When they come, just beat them up,” said Guo Ran.

“Alright.” Windy smiled simply.

The Barbarian race joined their ranks just like that and found a place for Wilde to lie down. This large oaf was still snoring loudly.

According to Windy, their king particularly liked to eat. One meal for him was a full day’s food for thousands of them.

However, last time, he had eaten too much. Thus, he needed to enter a state of slumber to properly digest it.

When they asked them just how many powerful experts Wilde had consumed, Windy and the others could only look at them in confusion. They didn’t know cultivation base realms and only knew the size of the meat. The others were also stupefied by this response, so they had no way to figure out just what level of experts Wilde had consumed.

During this time, more powerful experts had gathered. The Shadow race’s princess, the Netherworld’s experts, and the Blood race’s heavenly geniuses all stepped forward.

Within the human race, the other experts of the Eternal clans other than Ye Wuchen also came forward. The only ones who didn’t were the Jiang clan and the Long clan.

“What are the Jiang and Long clans planning? We’re all moving out. Are you still planning to conserve your power? Are you not afraid of being attacked by everyone when the time comes?” sneered a heavenly genius of the Zhao clan.

This Zhao clan expert had not made a single move during this time. Although other heavenly geniuses of the Zhao clan had fought, he had remained hidden this entire time. But now that everyone was forced to make their move, he had no choice but to also come forward.

“The Jiang clan does not wish to participate in this matter.” Feng Fei stepped forward with a smile.

“What does that mean?” demanded the Zhao clan’s heavenly genius.

“Nothing. My Jiang clan’s guts are small. To tell the truth, I’m a bit afraid of that fellow. I don’t want to offend him. But you, Zhao Xingtian, don’t need to worry. When I say that the Jiang clan does not wish to participate in this matter, it means that we won’t attack Long Chen, and we also won’t participate in the fight for karmic luck fragments. To put it frankly, we are waiving our right to this opportunity,” said Feng Fei lightly.

Countless people’s expressions changed. Just what was going on with the Eternal Jiang clan? Including Feng Fei, the Jiang clan had three peak heavenly geniuses. That might not be the strongest lineup amongst the eight Eternal clans, but in terms of the overall power of the junior generation, they could rank in the top three.

With this power, they chose to give up this chance? It was incomprehensible.

It had to be known that despite the Barbarian race and the Fullmoon race joining Long Chen’s side, the situation was still dire for them. The power disparity was so immense that there was no comparison between the two.

After all, this would be a battle of the strongest experts; ordinary experts would be instantly slain. Perhaps Long Chen’s people could endure a bit longer, but the Starry River Sect, the High Firmament Academy, the Battle God Palace, and the other disciples who had gone to reinforce Long Chen would be instantly wiped out.

Furthermore, with their deaths, their blood soul energy would activate the karmic luck bead. After that, everyone would be able to easily snatch its fragments.

In other words, there was no need for them to kill an apex expert like Long Chen. They just needed to kill the weaklings beneath him to get all the benefits. However, Feng Fei didn’t want such an opportunity?

“Alright, you’re the one who said that. If you can’t help but join in the fight at the end, don’t blame us when we crush you together,” sneered Zhao Xingtian.

“Don’t worry. My Jiang clan always keeps our word. In this aspect, your Zhao clan cannot compare,” retorted Feng Fei.

“You…!” Zhao Xingtian’s expression sank. Feng Fei was mocking the Zhao clan, slapping them in the face in front of all these people.

However, Zhao Xingtian could at least count as smart and didn’t argue with Feng Fei. Instead, he turned to Long Aotian. Just as he was about to speak, Long Aotian coldly said:

“Shut your mouth, or I’ll kill you.”
