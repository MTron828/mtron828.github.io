Chapter 3086 Vicious

Long Chen’s expression turned cold. The Chu family really was skilled. They actually knew that this person was from the High Firmament Academy.

It went without saying that the host had given them their registration list and now anyone that was enemies with the High Firmament Academy knew the names of their disciples. When they saw the names, they would immediately launch a killing blow without giving Long Chen and the others a chance to concede.

This dagger was a war challenge to them and also to Long Chen. Although he had been prepared from the start, seeing this dagger still caused his anger to soar. He had an urge to find the Chu family’s people within the crowd and kill them all.

Seeing Long Chen’s furious state, even Lu Mingxuan was so scared that she didn’t dare to say anything.

As for the Battle God Palace’s people, as they returned one by one, seeing their slain comrade infuriated them. If they were killed, they could only say that their power was inferior to the other side. But to stab a dagger into a person’s forehead like this, it was clear that the other side wanted to humiliate them.

“Sorry. We implicated you.” Luo Xue apologized, sighing.

“It has nothing to do with the Luo family. The Chu family tried to sneak into the academy and observe us. This is the enmity between us,” said Bai Shishi.

Although on the surface it appeared as if the Chu family was targeting the academy because of the Luo family, the reality wasn’t so simple.

“You should all retreat now.” After a moment of silence, Bai Shishi turned to those Battle God Palace disciples.

“We…” Those disciples were shocked and angered. If they retreated now, it would be an even greater disgrace to them. They weren’t afraid of death.

“Don’t say anything. Fairy Shishi is the leader, and we have to listen to her,” said a dark-faced disciple amongst them. This disciple rarely spoke.

“Big brother Zhao…” Those disciples couldn’t help being aggrieved. This big brother Zhao was the strongest amongst them, as well as the one with the greatest prestige. They had no choice but to listen to him.

“These are the orders. Don’t distract senior apprentice-brother Long Chen. Because of us…” Big brother Zhao looked at Long Chen.

Only then did they pay attention. Long Chen’s expression was shockingly dark. The chilling killing intent made the people closest to him shiver.

They hadn’t expected Long Chen’s reaction to be even greater than theirs. They didn’t know what to say, so they fell silent.

“Long Chen, calm down. The Chu family is doing this on purpose to anger us,” said Luo Xue.

“They’ve succeeded.”

Long Chen nodded. He understood that it was intentional and that getting angry was falling for their trap. But he couldn’t stop himself.

Now the Battle God Palace’s disciples understood why Bai Shishi wanted them to leave. Long Chen was unable to tolerate this kind of provocation. If this continued, all of them would be used to repeatedly provoke Long Chen.

In comparison, they were far too weak. It would be all too easy for their opponents to instantly kill them without giving them a chance to concede.

Although it was a blow to their confidence, they had no choice but to admit that they were lacking compared to those top experts. Giving up was the wisest choice for Long Chen and the others.

The Battle God Palace’s tablets turned dark, their runes shattering. This indicated that they had given up.

“Don’t worry, the glory of the High Firmament Academy will be upheld by us in your place,” said Bai Xiaole. He felt bad seeing these people give up, so he patted his chest.

“Long Chen, you have to calm down. With your Blood Qi circulating so quickly, your judgment will be affected if you encounter an expert,” said Lu Mingxuan.

It had just been an ordinary disciple who had died. She didn’t know why he was so incredibly angry. After all, that person was not his friend or family.

Long Chen shook his head. “It’s fine. Anger will only cause my power to increase. I also don’t know why I’m so angry. Perhaps I raised my realm too quickly. Don’t worry, I think it might get better after killing a few people.”

Just at this moment, the next round started. Long Chen once more appeared on a martial stage.

As soon as he arrived, he shot forward, transforming into a phantom. He then grabbed his opponent’s throat.

That person had just appeared, and before he even saw Long Chen, he was caught. He didn’t even have a chance to concede.

Long Chen eyed that person. After a moment, he slowly let go. That person was absolutely terrified, thinking that he was definitely dead. But Long Chen let him off.

Only then did he see Long Chen’s face, and he hastily kowtowed. “Many thanks instructor Long Chen for not killing me.”

This person admitted defeat and left. He didn’t even realize that in that instant, his soul was already captured by Long Chen’s gaze.

Long Chen returned. Lu Mingxuan, Bai Shishi, and the others also returned. They exchanged a look and shook their heads. The atmosphere was a bit heavy, and no one said anything.

The Battle God Palace’s disciples had given up, but they could still stay here and observe the rest of the battles.

Half an incense stick’s worth of time later, the next round started. Long Chen once more appeared on the martial stage and attacked in an instant, subduing his opponent immediately.

Runes revolved in Long Chen’s eyes. He forcibly searched through this person’s memories.

“I’ve found it.”

Long Chen snorted and his Spiritual Strength erupted. A spiritual sword then stabbed through that person’s mind, causing his head to explode. A large number of memories entered Long Chen’s mind.

Long Chen returned and finally smiled. Seeing him smile, Bai Shishi and the others also smiled.

“I’ve obtained some names. I’ll share them with you,” said Long Chen.

“I’ve also found some people targeting us. I’ll share them with everyone,” said Luo Xue.

This time, three people amongst their opponents were part of the group targeting the High Firmament Academy. They all had the list of names of the High Firmament Academy's disciples.

Through forceful soulsearches, Long Chen and the others could rip out the list of their people. That way they could kill each other.

This kind of soulsearch was simple and crude. Since these memories were not sect secrets, there were no spiritual seals protecting them, and that made them easy to find.

At this time, the only ones participating in the competition were Long Chen, Bai Shishi, young master Changchuan, Bai Xiaole, Lu Mingxuan, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Luo Xue, Luo Qing, and Mu Qingyun. They were all experts.

Although Luo Bing and Luo Ning were a bit weaker in comparison, as long as they didn’t encounter any supreme experts, they should have no problem. Even if they did encounter a supreme expert, they at least had the power to admit defeat first. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Following this, they began killing their opponents. Long Chen would always check his opponents’ memories. As long as it was an enemy, he would do a berserk soulsearch to grab the list of his opponent’s allies.

“Long Chen, we seem to have been targeted.” Lu Mingxuan stealthily whispered to Long Chen. He looked around and sensed countless gazes full of killing intent.

Long Chen smiled and raised his fist, the middle finger raised high.

“Kids, come and fight!”
