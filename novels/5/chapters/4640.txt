Chapter 4629: Be Happy With What You‚Äôve Got

Long Chen, youre brilliant! You have completely conned this poor fellow!

Yu Qingxuan laughed as she watched Yu Zihao happily trade medicinal ingredients and pills with these people.Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

Hehe, I can't take all the credit. He's just too gullible. To be honest, most cons don't require much skill. It's all about making a good first impression. I was just testing the waters, but I didn't expect him to take the bait so easily. Well, all my other preparations were for nothing, chuckled Long Chen.

Long Chen had devised numerous other tricks to deceive Yu Zihao and ensure he didn't suspect anything. However, it seemed that those preparations had been in vain.

Long Chen, lets discuss something, the Earth Cauldron interjected.

Senior, please speak.

This matter must be kept secret between us. I cant afford to lose face, stated the Earth Cauldron with a sigh.

How could one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the supreme existences of the world, possibly be known for conning others? If that news were to spread, how would it survive in this world?

Hehe, indeed, this was a scheme I orchestrated and executed alone. It has nothing to do with senior, right? Long Chen reassured with a smile, putting the Earth Cauldron at ease. It was evident that Long Chen wasn't concerned about any potential damage to his reputation.

It seemed that the name of Lord Brahma was quite convincing, prompting the surrounding experts to quickly carry out trades with Yu Zihao.

Some of these people directly gave him their medicinal ingredients as their main goal was to form a connection with Yu Zihao.

After all, he was still a disciple of a venerate amongst gods. If they could make a connection with him, their family and sect would definitely soar.

Furthermore, some experts amongst them were already followers of Lord Brahma, so they naturally rushed forward to help after hearing who Yu Zihao was.

As a result, various precious medicinal ingredients flowed into the divine diagram, keeping Long Chen incredibly busy as he diligently planted them within the primal chaos space. With each addition, his farm expanded rapidly.

However, to avoid drawing suspicions, Long Chen instructed the Earth Cauldron to intermittently enhance the brightness of the final image, giving Yu Zihao the impression of nearing success.

Three days later, not only had Yu Zihao depleted his own medicinal ingredients, but the surrounding experts had also exhausted theirs in their efforts to assist him.

The divine diagram was shining brightly, looking as if it was on the verge of some transformation. Could this divine diagram actually require all the ingredients guarded by the beasts surrounding the temple? someone speculated, prompting a change in Yu Zihao's expression.

There were countless beasts in the surroundings, some of which even he hesitated to confront. If that were the case, this would be an insurmountable task.

Long Chen was taken aback by that persons hypothesis, but he quickly nodded along. What a good idea. That way, they could deal with the beasts, and he simply pocketed all the rewards. Would there be anything better than that in this world?

Be happy with what you have. Dont be too greedy. Many of these beasts possess immemorial bloodlines, and they also have numbers. Even if you were to give these people a thousand years, they would likely not be able to gather them all. We also dont have that much time. Have you not noticed it? said the Earth Cauldron.

With this reminder, Long Chen finally noticed that the sky had started to darken as if clouds were covering the entire world.

What is going on? asked Long Chen.

The laws of this world are starting to change, and the primal chaos qi is also growing denser, indicating that the optimal time for undergoing tribulation is approaching. At this moment, theres no point in drawing things out with them. You have to prepare yourself. Yu Zihao has also noticed this problem and is unwilling to waste more time. He clearly doesnt have any more fat for you to squeeze out, explained the Earth Cauldron.

In the Earth Cauldrons view, Long Chen had already accomplished an almost impossible featgathering so many ingredients without putting any effort.

But the ones that I want still havent appeared yet! complained Long Chen.

Are you hoping to gather the full set for the Nirvanic Charge Pill from them? asked the Earth Cauldron.

Yes!

Are you dreaming? Youve gathered the majority of the ingredients from them, which was already a huge stroke of luck. There are many ingredients that you wouldnt be able to find even if you flipped through this entire land. You cant rush this, reasoned the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen had gathered an astronomical amount of medicinal ingredients, but he still wasnt happy. He was actually hoping to get every ingredient for the Nirvanic Charge Pill from Yu Zihao.

Long Chen was truly ruthless. Having found such a fat pig, he was planning on bleeding Yu Zihao dry. Unfortunately, he wouldnt get what he wanted even if he did so.

Is that so? Then fine.

Although Long Chen was a bit unwilling, he could only accept this reality.

When Long Chen looked at Yu Zihao again, he was taken aback. Yu Zihaos expression was exceedingly ugly, as if he had just received news of his parents death and their burial in poop. With a heart-wrenching expression, he gritted his teeth and reluctantly tossed out the final dozen medicinal ingredients he possessed.

In truth, he no longer harbored any hope. He had heard rumors of how difficult it was to obtain the hidden rewards left behind by Lord Brahma. Even as one of Lord Brahmas disciples, he would still have to pass the test to obtain the reward.

When someone speculated that they might have to gather all the medicinal ingredients around the temple to activate this divine diagram, he instantly lost all hope.

The most agonizing aspect was the tantalizing sight of the reward dangling right before him, yet remaining just out of reach.

Buzz.

Just as Yu Zihao was about to give up, the divine diagram accepted the final medicinal ingredient and started to quiver.

What?

Yu Zihao and the other experts were startled, and his expression completely transformed into one of absolute joy.

As the divine diagram rapidly shrank, Yu Zihao stared with rapt anticipation. Didnt this mean that the reward was about to appear before him?

The divine diagram twisted and turned, shrinking as it did so. Finally, it transformed into a three-meter sphere.

The sphere of light slowly floated over to Yu Zihao. Seeing this, Yu Zihao reverently knelt with his hands pressed together.

Thank you, master.

After he said this, the sphere of light quivered, and a bright hand emerged from it, stretching toward him. In response, Yu Zihao also extended his hand out.

However, in a bizarre turn of events, that hand veered off course, flicking Yu Zihaos dirty hand away and delivering a resounding slap across his face.

Pow! Crack!

The sound of bones breaking reverberated through the air as Yu Zihao was sent hurtling through the air. The sight stunned all the surrounding experts.

As the sphere of light slowly faded away, it unveiled a single figure that triggered startled cries from everyone present.
