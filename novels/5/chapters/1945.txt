Chapter 1935: 1935

As time passed, more and more of the Dragonblood warriors passed the tests . They managed to defeat themselves three times in a row .

However, some of them failed many times . They might win the first time and then lose the second, and so they had to start over .

Even if they won twice but lost the third, they would have to restart . This was a condition that Long Chen had tacked on .

It could be considered a challenge with a heaven-defying level of difficulty . Each time they beat themselves, their power and will would rise .

However, the next time they tried the trial, their opponent would have grown equally strong . To defeat themselves three times in a row, they had to constantly grow stronger . That was incredibly difficult .

Long Chen was trying to draw out all their potential . In theory, this method was impossible, but Long Chen had never really believed in theory . His principle was to raise his saber and fight to the death . There were no reasons or excuses needed . All he had to do was win . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After three days, half of the Dragonblood warriors had managed to pass the three-consecutive-win condition . Some of them even challenged themselves over and over again to break through their limits .

The Dragonblood Legion’s power shook the original devil race’s disciples to the core . The difference between them was immense .

Some of them also started challenging the Devil Blood Pool . This time, they weren’t fighting for time but to win .

Very quickly, some of them also managed to defeat themselves, stimulating the rest of them . Countless disciples began to attempt the trial .

Time passed by, bit by bit . Most of the Dragonblood warriors managed to pass, but hundreds of them were now in a deadlock . They were constantly growing stronger but so were their opponents . They couldn’t win .

Long Chen gathered those Dragonblood warriors . They were ashamed . They had all managed to beat themselves twice in a row but lost on the third . They were angry enough to curse .

Having been specifically gathered by Long Chen, they were ashamed of themselves, as well as nervous, feeling like they had disappointed their boss .

“You are all excellent . The reason you weren’t able to pass isn’t because you aren’t strong enough, but simply because you were unlucky . It’s actually not a bad thing,” said Long Chen .

“Boss, you don’t need to comfort us,” said one of the Dragonblood warriors .

“I’m not skilled in comforting others, only randomly hacking them . ” Long Chen smiled .

That drew out a smile from them . Long Chen looked over at them . “Having bad luck isn’t a bad thing . This is a truth that I have profoundly experienced . My luck has always been terrible, and I would often complain about it . However, complaining had no use . It was only later that I realized that whether or not something is good depends on how you look at it . A lucky person has a smooth path, but after succeeding nine hundred and ninety-nine times, all it takes is one failure for them to stumble and fall miserably . I’m sure with your experience, you know about the so-called high and noble heavenly geniuses who look down on others . Their good luck makes them succeed easier than others, which fosters a condescending attitude of looking down on others . Before encountering you, they always succeed, but after encountering you, they were killed with a single stroke of a blade, their good luck coming to an end . On the other hand, someone with bad luck will fall nine hundred and ninety-nine times, but it only takes one success for them to soar . Their failures temper their will and mental realm, and once they step into a higher realm, their failures will become a solid foundation . One is a solid foundation, while the other is rootless duckweed . That’s why you shouldn’t be resentful of failure . Look at it from another point of view . Calm yourself down and find the source . ”

Guo Ran suddenly raised his hand . “Boss, I understand . You’re saying that failure is the mother of success . Even if I fail nine hundred and ninety-nine times, all I have to do is try again-”

Long Chen nodded . “Yes, if you try again, you can get an even thousand . ”

Guo Ran almost coughed up blood . “Boss, what are you saying?”

“What I just said doesn’t apply to you . A fellow like you with no willpower or integrity doesn’t follow this logic . If you want to say that failure is the mother of success, then you are definitely infertile,” said Long Chen .

“Boss, my heart! Without a hundred thousand spirit crystals... no, without a million spirit crystals, I’ll never recover!” Guo Ran lay like a ball on the ground without the slightest air of an expert .

Guo Ran was the clown of the Dragonblood Legion . He liked to mess around, but he was able to raise everyone’s mood .

“Fine, you win, I’ll give you the money when we get back . Let’s talk for real,” said Long Chen . Speaking to everyone, he said, “Being angry over this is meaningless and won’t solve your problems . At this time, you have to learn some new techniques . However, what I’m about to teach you, you cannot show to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s people, or they’ll definitely beat you . ”

For the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, power was everything . If you couldn’t beat your opponent, it just meant that you weren’t strong enough . They wouldn’t try to use any trick because that was a waste of time, a distraction from getting stronger .

First, he had to make sure that what he was about to say wouldn’t reach the old man’s ears . Only once everyone nodded did Long Chen continue, “The Devil Blood Pool’s rules are dead, while people are alive . You know your own weaknesses, and those weaknesses are duplicated . What if in the middle of battle, you were to break your limit by creating a new technique that is unique to you? You can come up with a completely deviant technique adapted to your weaknesses . In the end, the goal of battle is to eliminate your opponents . It doesn’t matter if you use a crotch kick, an eye jab, a nose hook, as long as it works, it’s fine . To tell the truth, back in the Eastern Wasteland’s Phoenix Cry Empire I had an exceptionally good crotch kick that knocked out quite a few balls . ”

Tang Wan-er and the others turned away, their faces red . Long Chen’s final words were a bit too crude . Chu Yao and Meng Qi both covered their smiles . Back in the Phoenix Cry Empire, Long Chen truly had often used this move . In fact, he had once used just this one move to take victory on the martial stage .

“Boss, we understood . We weren’t flexible enough,” said one of the Dragonblood warriors .

“Exactly . Rules are dead, but people are alive . Do you remember the Fate Princes that flustered Chang Hao and Bao Buping? Two of you were able to kill two Fate Princes easily . Why is that? Because people need to know how to break conventions, or others will use their experience to play you to death as you follow the same patterns over and over again . We don’t play by those rules . If someone wants to play chess with you, just break the chessboard,” said Long Chen .

Meng Qi and the others were speechless . When Long Chen was evil, was there anyone more evil than him? The things he could come up with were chilling .

“Boss, we understand!”

“Then go . ”

Those Dragonblood warriors once more charged into the Devil Blood Pool . This time, their battle style had clearly changed . People quickly ran back, exclaiming their victories .

“Don’t get happy too soon . You’ll only be able to use each move once because it will be duplicated the next time . You need to constantly think of new techniques on the fly . Furthermore, make sure to win, because as time passes, your opponent will only grow more evil as you do,” said Long Chen .

Those Dragonblood warriors felt their excitement vanish without a trace . They focused and ran back to the trial .

However, with just this one warning, they once more passed . They were constantly thinking of how to create a new method to target their own weaknesses .

The Dragonblood warriors all started challenging the Devil Blood Pool again, wanting to use this chance to think of new techniques . There was no risk to their lives, and they could gain more experience .

They were like divine weapons being constantly sharpened by the Devil Blood Pool . With each day, they made progress . They could clearly feel themselves getting stronger . Influenced by the Dragonblood warriors, the disciples of the original devil race also joined in .

Another week passed, and the Dragonblood warriors had all passed . After that, Long Chen took out a batch of Heavenly Dao Fruits, making the warriors who weren’t yet Empyreans refine them .

Due to their immense experience with refining the Heavenly Dao Fruits, it only took them a single day to refine them . Now the Dragonblood Legion was composed of Empyreans .

Over twelve thousand Empyreans were standing together . Their powerful auras caused heaven and earth to tremble . Long Chen felt a grand feeling in his heart . He had raised this unrivaled army .

“Brothers, let’s go . We’re undergoing tribulation . ”

Long Chen suddenly waved his hand, bringing the Dragonblood Legion out of the Skyscraping World .
