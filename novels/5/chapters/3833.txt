Chapter 3822 Immemorial Evil Corpses

“Lift!”

Long Chen clenched his teeth. He didn’t dare to summon his battle armor here. He was already using his full power, but the gate barely quivered. It was too heavy, many times heavier than the metal mountains.

Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and Yue Xiaoqian came to help. However, Xia Chen and Yue Xiaoqian weren’t able to put in much work. Fortunately, Guo Ran had his battle armor and Supreme Bone. Only then did they barely manage to lift the gate.

“Get in here!”

Long Chen shouted and pulled. The gate quivered and was sucked into the primal chaos space.

With a boom, it smashed into the primal chaos space’s earth, leaving a giant hole.

Long Chen didn’t even look at what it was doing and hastily checked on Mo Nian. This fellow’s entire body was flattened. Fortunately, he was wearing a drab helmet.

Long Chen pulled Mo Nian out, and only then did he begin gasping for air. He also spat out a mouthful of dirt.

“Next time, you keep the door up. It’s too heavy. I almost got crushed to death. After sweeping through all the large tombs of this world, if I were killed by a door, it would wipe away all my prestige,” said Mo Nian.

Everyone laughed at that. Mo Nian was powerful enough to survive after being flattened like that. It was no wonder he was still dancing around happily after being chased for so many years. His life force was truly shocking.

“You took the door? I haven’t helped you seal the curse runes yet! If they spread, your astral space will wither. Bring it out!” said Mo Nian suddenly.

This gate had terrifying curse runes. They had to be sealed with a secret art of the Limitless Palace, or those curse runes would cause endless harm.

Long Chen finally took a look at the wooden door in the primal chaos space. It was just lying there quietly. The runes that had been carved on it had been erased by some energy at some point.

Long Chen actually sensed a trace of life from this black wood. It was like a withered tree being revived in the spring, and Long Chen was delighted by this. It seemed that it really might work.

“I’m fine. I can handle it.”

This wooden door might be terrifying, but in the primal chaos space, it couldn’t cause any trouble. It was no different than ordinary wood.

“Everyone, get back,” ordered Mo Nian suddenly. Everyone hastily hid behind the remaining door.

Just then, the invisible airflow came back. This time, they were prepared, and it just blew by them without harming them.

After it passed, Long Chen began to cut off the other door’s axle. As for Mo Nian, he set up seals on the door.

The wooden door slowly fell, but this time, Long Chen borrowed its own weight to flip it through the air. The moment it was airborne, Mo Nian sucked it away.

“Hahaha, when us brothers are united, we’ll definitely profit. I knew that this treasure had a destiny with me!” After putting away the door, Mo Nian laughed delightedly.

Although he had also gained quite a few good items on the way here, his standards were high, and those items weren’t that valuable to him. But this was definitely a great treasure, which delighted him. If it wasn’t for Long Chen, he wouldn’t even dare to eye this wooden gate.

After putting away the doors, they hastily rushed through the path. Without the wooden gate to block it, that airflow might come again and leave them with nowhere to dodge.

As they followed the path, they suddenly reached a fork with nine paths to choose from. At this moment, Mo Nian took out a rusty compass. Countless runes lit up on it, and Mo Nian was comparing the runes on the compass to the runes on the paths.

“This way.”

After studying it for a while, Mo Nian led them to the third path on the right.

Once they were in the path, they heard ear-splitting rumbling. The entire path was shaking like a flood was coming.

“It’s death qi. But it’s not that powerful. We can endure it,” said Mo Nian.

Mo Nian had just spoken when another invisible current struck them. They hastily stabilized themselves. Although they were blown back a few steps, it really wasn’t as terrifying as the bursts of airflow outside.

After all, the airflow outside was the result of all nine channels’ flows concentrating together. This was just one path, so they easily passed through it.

They continued onwards. It was a very long path, and they were struck by those currents seven times before reaching the end. Here, the death qi was even denser.

It was a square stone gate at the end of the channel. It was a gate that closed from top to bottom. When they arrived at it, it slowly opened, but Mo Nian didn’t move.

The moment that it opened, they saw a great deal of powder beneath the gate. Due to how much time had passed, they couldn’t tell what exactly this powder was.

“It seems that we weren’t the only ones to enter the heavenly tomb,” said Mo Nian, eyeing this powder.

This powder was a mix of bone dust, decayed clothing, as well as broken weapons. Clearly, others had also reached this point. However, it seemed as if they had been crushed by the gate.

Perhaps if they tried to rush through this gate, it would slam shut and slice through them.

For there to be other people to reach this point, that meant that they had to be able to pass through the Heavenly Dao Bewilderment Barrier. It was unknown what method that they used, but one thing was for sure. Anyone capable of reaching this point had to be an outstanding figure with amazing abilities or some shocking weapon.

There was a great deal of powder with various colors beneath the gate, as even World Domain divine items could not endure the crushing of this gate. Also, based on the amount of powder, it wasn’t just one person that had reached this spot.

“The ground on the other side has quite a few things. Clearly, people tried to probe this gate using several methods. Based on this, objects can pass through, but if people try to pass, the stone gate will slam down like lightning. It must be impossible to dodge. But it’s a good thing that we obtained a certain treasure just now,” chortled Mo Nian.

BOOM!

Mo Nian took out the wooden door. Fortunately, the passage was big enough, and the wooden door perfectly blocked the bottom of the stone gate.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

If the stone gate were to fall, it would first strike the door. However, it was still unknown whether the wooden door would be able to receive that blow.

Mo Nian carefully crept forward. When the majority of his body was under the stone gate…

BOOM!

The stone gate slammed down ruthlessly. It was so fast that it didn’t give anyone a chance to react. They all jumped.

Fortunately, the wooden door was safe and sound. The stone gate once more rose.

Seeing that the wooden door was fine, Mo Nian instantly relaxed and walked in just like that. He easily passed through.

With Mo Nian passing, the others also passed through one by one. But each time, the stone gate would smash down. Although they knew that they would be fine, that terrifying speed and power made them jump as they passed through.

Once everyone was through, they all worked together to pull the wooden gate over. Despite being repeatedly struck by the stone gate, it wasn’t the slightest bit damaged. Its hardness was extraordinary.

The stone gate slowly fell behind them now that they were all through. It directly sealed their exit.

Just then, they heard a low roar, and a three-meter figure appeared. It was a horned lifeform. When it appeared, Long Chen and the others’ hair stood on end.

“Immemorial evil corpse!”
