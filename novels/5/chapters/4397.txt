Chapter 4386 Not Speaking Reason, Only Talking With Fists

Long Chen and the others were taken aback to find that all these hundreds of people were Eternal experts, and despite their middle-aged appearance, they were still in the prime of their lives.

They were different from the Great Desolate World and humanless world’s Eternal experts, who were already old fellows with regressed Blood Qi. In contrast, the Blood Qi of these experts remained vibrant and robust.

When Long Chen and the others walked over, a powerful Blood Qi crashed down on them. Had they never fought against Eternal experts, the intensity of this pressure would have paralyzed them.

Long Chen couldn't fathom when the High Firmament Academy had acquired such a formidable force. The sheer number of Eternal experts left him utterly astonished.

It had to be known that when Long Chen first arrived in the academy, their strongest expert was Dean Bai Letian, and he was supposedly only an Immortal King.

At that moment, Long Chen couldn't help but wonder how the academy had declined to a state where even minor powers dared to provoke them, and yet no powerful experts dared to come and wipe them out.

Now, he grasped the truth. The real powerful forces were well aware of how terrifying the High Firmament Academy was, and they couldn’t be bothered to warn the suicidal fellows who went to provoke them. Instead, they observed with a sense of satisfaction as these reckless challengers faced the consequences of their actions.

“Dean Long Chen, it’s been a long time, and your cultivation base only continues to soar. Admirable!”

Long Chen was still shocked by what he saw, momentarily forgetting his manners. Bai Letian, noticing Long Chen's astonishment, was the first to break the silence with a hearty laugh and a warm greeting.

“Greetings, Dean! Greetings, Seniors. This little one was so shocked by your powerful and heroic appearance that I forgot how to speak. Please forgive my lack of manners,” Long Chen expressed with a smile.

Hearing Long Chen’s genuine praise, these solemn experts cracked a slight smile, and the tense atmosphere diminished.

These people were all Eternal experts, while Long Chen was merely a World King. However, according to common etiquette, all of these experts needed to greet Long Chen as if he was their superior. After all, Long Chen’s status as a dean was special.

However, Long Chen chose to address himself as the junior instead, speaking humbly and respectfully. He even flattered them and made them feel fond of him.

All these Eternal experts had crossed paths with countless heavenly geniuses, yet never before had they witnessed someone with such extraordinary power and prestige effortlessly maintaining a low-key presence.

While some heavenly geniuses did treat them respectfully, the arrogance in their eyes could not be concealed. Those geniuses didn’t know just how high the heavens were.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

On the other hand, Long Chen was neither servile nor overbearing, devoid of arrogance or greed. He did not radiate any sense of superiority, yet no one dared to underestimate him. Rather, it left an impression that he possessed genuine internal strength, leaving people unconsciously drawn to him and feeling a fondness for his presence.

“Everyone, sit. No need to stand on courtesy.”

Bai Letian waved his hand, indicating for everyone to sit. Although the palace was broken down, there was ample space, so even with over five thousand Dragonblood warriors present, it didn’t feel packed.

Bai Letian’s gaze swept over Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole, and he was happy to see that they had gotten stronger. Bai Xiaole, in particular, finally had a light in his eyes—a confidence that only the strong had. Bai Xiaole had finally grown up.

Bai Letian wanted to praise them a bit, but this wasn’t the place to do so, so he held back. At this moment, the palace master sat down beside Bai Letian, and the latter asked, “Palace master, how is the situation in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven?”

The Darklight Heaven and the Nirvana Overflow Heaven were practically different worlds, so information traveled very slowly between them. The most recent news they had gotten here was about Long Chen and the others undergoing tribulation.

“The Great Desolate World has been decimated by Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion, while the humanless world has suffered extensive destruction. They can no longer recover from this blow,” revealed the palace master.

These experts couldn't help but be stirred by this revelation. A newfound respect shone in their eyes as they looked at Long Chen and the others.

An Eternal expert said, “Dean Long Chen truly is amazing. Those two worlds had quite a few Eternal experts. It’s no surprise that you have such severe internal wounds after fighting them.”

These experts could see that Long Chen and the others were still fatigued from their recent battle. Their spiritual fluctuations were not entirely stable, and it was evident that their injuries were far from minor.

“You’re wrong.” The palace master shook his head. “Those Eternal experts were unable to harm them.”

“Oh? The injuries weren’t caused by Eternal experts?”

“When they destroyed the Great Desolate World, everything went smoothly. However, when they attacked the humanless world, they got so unlucky and actually encountered a fellow who had just become a Saint,” said the palace master.

“A Saint?!”

Those Eternal experts jumped in shock, and even Bai Letian was startled.

“Isn’t the Nirvana Overflow Heaven a dead-end? The primal chaos qi cannot cycle there, so how can it produce a Saint?” asked an Eternal expert.

“That fellow is from the red devil race,” said the palace master.

Hearing that, these experts nodded in comprehension. They all knew of the red devil race’s innate divine ability.

The palace master then told them how Long Chen and the others had fought the red-haired monster. When they heard that the Dragonblood Legion’s combined might was capable of blocking the attack of a Saint, they were filled with complete disbelief.

Furthermore, when they learned that Long Chen managed to destroy that Saint’s head, their expressions lit up with genuine amazement. If they weren’t acutely aware that the palace master was not the kind of person to exaggerate, they would have assumed that he was just telling a story.

When they looked at Long Chen again, it was like they were looking at a monster. Their gazes were completely different from before.

“It was just luck,” said Long Chen with a smile.

The palace master also told about how Long Chen had dealt with the traitors of the human race. Following that, these experts nodded, feeling like Long Chen had done quite well.

Bai Letian smiled. “Dean Long Chen has always acted with humility and etiquette. It’s rarely seen in the junior generation. However, humility has to be reserved for the right people. This time, we urgently asked Dean Long Chen to return because we want a powerful spokesperson. Throughout the entire High Firmament Academy and the Battle God Palace, we cannot find anyone more suitable than Dean Long Chen, so we hope that Dean Long Chen can put aside that humble attitude and be a bit more arrogant when facing those from outside the academy. You can be a bit more unreasonable, a bit more domineering…”

Long Chen and the others were stunned, especially the Dragonblood warriors. They felt that their boss was already quite domineering. How was he supposed to be even more domineering?

The experts beside the palace master already wanted to speak several times and finally couldn’t help but interrupt, “Dean, I’m sorry for interrupting you, but may I speak?”

“Alright. We’ll leave it to the vice lightning palace master,” said Bai Letian, not minding the interruption.

The vice lightning palace master looked at Long Chen. “I will explain it simply. Previously, we talked reason to others. However, starting now, we’re no longer talking reason. We don’t have time to do so. In the future, we’ll be talking with our fists.”

Long Chen was still dumbfounded, not understanding what they meant.

At this moment, a large mirror appeared inside the palace, projecting a scene that left Long Chen and the others momentarily stunned. The sight was so intense that it felt like flames were about to erupt from their heads.
