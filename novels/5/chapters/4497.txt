Chapter 4486 The Qualifications to Fight

Luo Bing was startled awake from her seclusion and immediately sensed a bloodline call, causing her soul to nearly flee in terror. The sensation was accompanied by an alarming realization that Luo Ning’s soul was on the brink of extinguishing.

Rushing out, she directly saw Luo Ning in Long Chen’s grasp, her head hanging as if she was about to die at any moment. In that moment of shock, her head went blank, and she sprinted toward them.

The translucent figure also vanished, and Luo Bing felt an unsettling tremor in her soul, which rendered her unable to take another step. The mysterious sword, akin to a fiend’s life-ripping fang, lunged toward her chest.

An explosion of lightning erupted before his sword could reach her, and a lightning spear rushed over. Surprisingly, the lightning spear wasn’t aimed at that translucent figure but Luo Bing.

As this lightning spear was about to reach her, the translucent figure, who had clearly been below it at first, seemed to move up just to be hit by it.

“Oh?” This translucent figure seemed a bit surprised that Long Chen had predicted his path. Now if he wanted to kill Luo Bing, he would have to block the lightning spear first.

As the lightning spear gave him a sense of danger, his sword suddenly spun, and the point of the sword met the spear.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

BOOM!

After the translucent figure was sent flying, Long Chen appeared in front of Luo Bing, and only then did Luo Bing’s condition return to normal. She could finally move again.

“Use your bloodline power to stimulate Luo Ning’s blood and soul, quick!” Long Chen handed Luo Ning to Luo Bing.

Prior to this, Long Chen had chosen to endure the strikes from the mysterious expert’s sword rather than release his hold on Luo Ning. The reason was clear—her soul was on the verge of vanishing, and without his support, she would die.

However, Long Chen’s violet blood was too powerful to be absorbed by her. If attempted, it would rip through her meridians, and even if he did save her life, she would be crippled.

At best, he could sustain her life and prevent her from dying. However, with Luo Bing present, he didn’t need to worry any longer.

Luo Bing hastily grabbed her sister and infused her with her own violet blood. Luo Ning’s withered soul immediately showed signs of reviving, and the flame of her soul gradually rekindled.

Long Chen sighed with relief upon seeing that. As Luo Ning’s life was no longer in danger, he focused his attention on this mysterious expert. Killing intent exploded out of him.

“Do you know how foolish what you are doing is?” asked Long Chen, every word dripping with killing intent.

“Foolish? No, the true fools are you humans. Your bloodline has declined, but you aren’t even aware of it. Do you really think that you are as strong as the original violet blood race?” scoffed that mysterious figure.

He then shook his body a few times. After blocking Long Chen’s lightning spear, quite a few lightning runes stuck to him, unable to penetrate the surface of his skin. Nonchalantly, he flicked them off.

Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole were both shocked. They all knew that Long Chen’s thunderforce originated from heavenly tribulation, possessing incredible power. Yet, this mysterious expert seemed impervious to it, effortlessly flicking off the lightning runes.

Most importantly, he was not the strongest expert of Heavenly Province as he called Ying Tian “master”. In other words, he was at most just one of Ying Tian’s powerful generals.

The mysterious figure looked at the surroundings, and with an indifferent tone, remarked, “My Heavenly Province is back, and this is a declaration of war on the violet blood race. I am here because the High Firmament Academy has the violet blood prey we seek. Additionally, I am here to deliver Master Ying Tian’s challenge. But I didn’t expect that you, too, are someone from the violet blood race. Now, I am contemplating whether to forgo Master Ying Tian’s orders and slay you immediately. Your blood… is very important to me.” His sword, resembling a viper, remained in constant motion. Its pointed head aimed at Long Chen, as if probing for weaknesses.

Just then, the Dragonblood Legion also rushed over. When they saw this mysterious figure, their pupils shrank. They instantly sensed just how terrifying he was.

“Oh?”

When this mysterious figure spotted Yue Zifeng in their ranks, his eyes suddenly went red, and his pupils shrank to tiny dots.

As for Yue Zifeng, his expression turned grave, and he reached back for his sword.

“Boss, Leave this person to me!”

Yue Zifeng’s sharp senses told him that amongst all of the experts here, only he and Long Chen could accurately judge this mysterious figure’s true power.

As a sword cultivator, Yue Zifeng specialized in killing people in one blow and was the bane of all assassins. As a result, most assassination arts were a joke in front of him. In this aspect, he held a greater advantage than Long Chen.

His Sword Dao was something he had the utmost confidence in. However, this mysterious figure also emanated immense pressure on him. If they were to fight, no one could say for sure who would survive.

Yet, this feeling also profoundly stimulated him. True sword cultivators thrived under the threat of death, and Yue Zifeng found himself profoundly invigorated by the challenge.

Yue Zifeng had been following Long Chen for a while now, but not many people could make him feel such a sense of death, especially within the same generation.

“I’m sorry, brother. This isn’t just a personal battle between us. It’s a clash between our races, and I have to personally do this,” said Long Chen. As he stared at this mysterious figure, his killing intent intensified even further.

Long Chen had violet blood, making him a member of the violet blood race. However, he didn’t feel any bloodline hatred toward the mysterious figure. Even Luo Bing and Luo Ning didn’t sense anything.

Long Chen had only sensed danger from the violet blood fluctuations in Luo Ning when she was targeted. Although Luo Ning herself remained unaware of being targeted, Long Chen had swiftly rushed to her aid the moment he sensed the danger.

Long Chen didn’t know if it was because their violet blood energy had regressed to the point that they could no longer feel the bloodline hatred, or the Lifehunter race had been unable to leave a permanent mark on the violet blood race’s bloodline back then.

However, when Long Chen witnessed Luo Ning being pierced through the heart, when he held her cold body, and when he saw her lying there like she was dead, a surge of killing intent consumed him.

“Hehe, good. Go ahead and attack me. If you attack me and I just counterattack, Master Ying Tian can’t blame me!” the mysterious figure laughed. He pointed his strange sword at Long Chen as if not placing him in his eyes.

“Then let me see how strong the Lifehunter race is to challenge my violet blood race!” Long Chen exclaimed, swiftly springing into action as both his Dragon King Battle Armor and Seven Star Battle Armor instantaneously activated.
