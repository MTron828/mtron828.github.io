Chapter 2632 Impossible to Escape

The void exploded, forming a black hole. Long Chen then forced himself to fly out of it. Otherwise, if he was sucked inside, not even ten lives would be enough.

“Fuck, what kind of existence can force me out of a transportation midway?!” Long Chen was shocked. His whole body was wracked in pain.

Just now, he had clearly been in the midst of the transportation. He had almost been crushed when that power struck him.

“That’s a late Heaven Merging expert. According to the Martial Heaven Continent’s standard, it’s someone whose cultivation base has reached the ninth Heavenstage of Heaven Merging,” said the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet.

Damn, so this was the power of a late Heaven Merging expert. Long Chen had actually ended up provoking one, and one that had reached the ninth Heavenstage at that.

After Long Chen had escaped the suction of the black hole, relying on the memories of the Horned King, he flew toward the exit to the Martial Heaven Continent.

“Mingyu, are you alright?” Long Chen was carrying Dong Mingyu as he sped. Just now, that blow had been so powerful that he was really worried about her.

“I’m fine. Most of the power was blocked by you…” said Dong Mingyu.

Her eyes were a bit red from emotion. Just now, she had sensed Long Chen block the majority of that attack for her. From the beginning, she had always been alone. Even her father and mother were devout believers of the Bloodkill Hall, and she was viewed by them as a tool for worshiping the god. In the Bloodkill Hall’s emotionless cold-bloodedness, she had never known emotions even as a child.

Long Chen smiled toward her comfortingly. This girl really was pitiful.

At this moment, the void rumbled and lightning thundered. A terrifying aura filled the world, giving Long Chen goosebumps.

He could sense countless terrifying auras coming behind him. The devil race’s experts were chasing after them.

They were incredibly quick. In the blink of an eye, they had closed the gap. In another blink, they were even closer.

Right now, Long Chen recalled how Heaven Merging experts could tear through the void to travel. That was why they were so fast.

However, he also saw the exit up ahead. As long as he exited Devil Spirit Mountain, he wouldn’t need to fear these terrifying experts. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The stronger the expert, the greater the suppression of the Martial Heaven Continent if they entered. If these Heaven Merging experts entered the Martial Heaven Continent at this time, he could kill them as easily as killing Netherpassage experts.

However, just as he felt joy, it was extinguished. The exit was covered in countless experts.

Millions and millions of them were blocking the exit. Looking at this scene, Long Chen had no idea how the devil race had managed to react so quickly.

After that, Long Chen felt a chill. He could sense dozens of terrifying auras at the exit as well. Those had to at least be mid Heaven Merging experts.

Even with his guts, he felt like flying over there would be like a moth flying into a flame.

“Long Chen, don’t worry. I will activate the fragment of the head. It will suppress them to the same cultivation base as you. However, it will only last a single breath’s time, so you have to charge out in that breath’s time,” said the Western Desert Ax.

“There’s such a good thing? Then it’s no problem!” Long Chen was delighted to hear that. The Eastern Wasteland Bell was amazing. Just a fragment of it possessed such a heaven-defying ability. Fortunately, the Western Desert Ax was present, or he would have no idea how to activate this power.

Just as Long Chen was charging over, the Dragonblood Legion on the Martial Heaven Continent also launched a fierce attack.

Only the Dragonblood Legion was aware that Long Chen and Dong Mingyu had snuck into Devil Spirit Mountain. Hence, they were guarding this place, ready to receive him at any moment.

Suddenly seeing the alarms and movements inside Devil Spirit Mountain, how could they not know what had happened? Under Guo Ran’s orders, the Dragonblood Legion launched an all-out attack, striking like a sharp dagger.

Feng Fei and Ye Lingshan both paled when they saw the huge army of the devil race. They gave the most urgent order for reinforcements.

Only now did the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts learn that Long Chen had snuck into the home of the devil race, and the Dragonblood Legion was providing support for him.

The divine families tightly guarded the exit. However, the Martial Heaven Continent’s warriors readily followed the Dragonblood Legion into Devil Spirit Mountain.

As a result, once the warriors entered Devil Spirit Mountain, they realized that they had underestimated the devil race’s army. The devil army had plentiful Heaven Merging experts.

The auras of the mid Heaven Merging devils in particular made the warriors quiver. Just what had Long Chen done to invoke such a terrifying reaction from the devil race?

They charged into Devil Spirit Mountain, but the Heaven Merging devils ignored the commotion. They allowed the cannon fodder to block the Dragonblood Legion and were completely focused on preventing anyone from their side from charging through to the Martial Heaven Continent.

“I see boss! Heavens, what am I seeing?!” exclaimed Guo Ran. He almost fell from the sky when he saw Long Chen. Long Chen was like a bolt of lightning streaking through the air.

However, behind Long Chen was a black tide that filled the sky from top to bottom. Just the army in front of Devil Spirit Mountain was frightening enough, but compared to that tide, they were like a drop in the ocean. Just what had his boss done? Had he blown up the headquarters of the devil race?

“Go all-out! Open a path for boss!” roared Guo Ran. He began to unleash arrows like meteorites, blasting the devil experts apart.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan, and the others also launched crazy attacks. However, there were too many enemies. For every batch that they killed, another batch replaced them.

They began to panic. The devil race had created an iron wall of defense. Furthermore, this place was Devil Spirit Mountain, so they were powerless to charge through such a blockade.

“Can the High Priest or Daoist Heavenly Feather arrive in time? Otherwise, Long Chen might just fall today.” Ye Lingshan had also charged in. When she saw Long Chen, she turned pale. Right now, the only ones capable of saving Long Chen were the High Priest or Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“Brothers, don’t panic. Retreat back to the Martial Heaven Continent. Today, I will show you my true skill in killing devils. The unrivaled Long Chen is about to take the stage!”

Just as everyone was panicking, Long Chen’s arrogant voice rang out.

“What?” Everyone was stunned.
