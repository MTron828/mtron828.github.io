Chapter 3890 Unstoppable Sword

Everyone’s warning was too late. Yue Zifeng’s back was already pierced by that spear.

However, to everyone’s surprise, after his body was pierced, it dissipated like smoke.

A sword then struck the master of that spear from a bizarre angle, exposing it. It was another Long Qinian.

“A clone art?!”

This clone also dissipated as Yue Zifeng’s sword slashed through its fading image.

Just as everyone thought that this attack had no effect, they saw blood in the distance. The clone, which had already fled and dodged Yue Zifeng’s attack, was still injured by his Sword Qi. There was a large cut in its chest.

Long Qinian’s clone roared furiously with a voice that was not human. It was a dragon’s roar that contained furious dragon might.

“So you absorb that dragon’s essence blood and soul, and this clone is a puppet condensed from its dragon soul with your dragon blood as a foundation. As long as your dragon blood continues to exist, it will live forever. But so what? If this is your trump card, you won’t survive three moves,” said Yue Zifeng.

He stepped forward, vanishing. His speed seemed to have escaped the limitations of spacetime. People barely saw a glimpse of his sword as it slashed toward Long Qinian.

“You keep talking big! How shameless!” Long Qinian roared furiously. His traps had no effect on Yue Zifen, and he was even looked down upon. This was a huge insult to him. “Evil dragon protection, dragon bone golden body!”

In a sudden eruption of power, golden bone armor burst out of Long Qinian’s skin. The bone plates swiftly assembled, enveloping him in complete protection. Every bone plate gave off a terrifying aura, akin to a scaled armor made from World Domain divine items. When this armor appeared, his aura instantly erupted to a new level.

“The Supreme Bone is summoned as a bone armor! His Supreme Bone is actually defensive!”

Every person’s Supreme Bone had different abilities, with some emphasizing offensive prowess while others prioritized defense. Moreover, they had a vast array of attributes, offering endless special abilities.

On the other hand, Supreme Blood was something that could be directly summoned to increase one’s power. But the Supreme Bone could only bring out its true potential once it was merged with the Supreme Blood as a foundation for its power. The potential for diverse and extraordinary powers seemed limitless.

When Long Qinian’s bone armor appeared, streaks of lightning appeared in the sky and crashed down upon him.

“Heavenly lightning tempering armor?!”

A chorus of startled cries rang through the air. It was believed that when powerful magical arts and divine weapons were born into this world, they would inevitably attract the wrath of heavenly lightning.

The existence of some supremely powerful armor and armored magical arts would be viewed as a direct challenge to the Heavenly Daos and draw down heavenly punishment. If they could not endure the might of the Heavenly Daos, they would be destroyed, and the person who tried to summon them would also be slain.

At this moment, spears of lightning crashed down with shocking auras. Each of them was practically equivalent to a full-power attack of a city lord.

However, unexpectedly, those lightning spears would simply explode on contact with this bone armor, unable to cause any damage.

After thirty-six bolts of lightning failed to damage the bone armor, a new layer of resplendent light appeared on it.

“The bone armor finished the tribulation! It has obtained the approval of heaven and earth! What can possibly break it?!” A city lord cried out in shock. It was their first time seeing such a terrifying defense.

Yue Zifeng was now right in front of Long Qinian’s true body, his sword descending with formidable force. At the same time, Long Qinian’s clone also attacked Yue Zifeng’s back.

“What?!”

Startled cries rang out. What was Long Qinian intending? Was he really going to receive Yue Zifeng’s attack with his bone armor?

If Long Qinian could block Yue Zifeng’s attack, then Yue Zifeng would be met with the fatal strike of his clone. But if Long Qinian failed to block it, his true body would be slain while his clone would persist, still capable of killing Yue Zifeng. This was the unique characteristic of a dragon blood clone; it had its own consciousness and could even survive after the true body died. In this situation, regardless of the outcome, it seemed inevitable that Yue Zifeng’s fate would be sealed.

However, Yue Zifeng showed no sign of giving up. Seeing this, everyone instantly understood that a sword cultivator possessed their own pride and confidence.

If Yue Zifeng retreated, it would become a setback to his Dao-heart. As a sword cultivator, he couldn’t fear death, nor could he do anything to ruin his Dao-heart. Long Qinian had taken note of this point before setting up this trap for him.

However, Yue Zifeng was still indifferent. Without the slightest ripple in his eyes, his sword slashed toward Long Qinian’s head.

All of a sudden, Long Qinian made a move. He raised his hand, and to everyone’s surprise, a dragon spear appeared in his grasp. The very same dragon spear that was originally held by his clone now resided in his hand.

BOOM!

Holding his spear horizontally, he directly clashed with Yue Zifeng’s sword. As a result, a wave of Sword Qi exploded, tearing through heaven and earth, causing a black crack to spread all the way to the end of the world.

That black crack continued through Long Qinian’s spear and into his body. His bone armor became covered in cracks as well.

Long Qinian coughed up blood. In an instant, his bone armor’s divine light turned dim, and he was almost slain.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What?!”

Seeing this, the spectators’ eyes almost popped out of their sockets. It had to be known that Long Qinian’s battle armor hadn’t even been shaken by heavenly lightning, showcasing its astonishing defensive powers. But now, it was almost destroyed by one strike of Yue Zifeng’s sword!

“Sword soul?!”

Long Qinian retreated far into the distance, staring at Yue Zifeng in shock and disbelief.

His bone armor was covered in countless cracks, and his dragon spear now had a peanut-sized nick in it. This one blow had almost crushed him alongside his weapon.

Yue Zifeng’s sword possessed a supreme will, a kind of energy containing his full mind and spirit. It was something that transcended all laws. When Long Qinian blocked that sword, his soul almost crumbled, as if his soul was fleeing for its life.

Hence, he was shocked, angry, and terrified. Just now, if he hadn’t absorbed his clone’s power at the last minute, this attack would have wiped him out of existence.

“That was the first move. Here comes the second.”

Yue Zifeng’s sword trembled. In a seamless fusion of sword and man, he transformed into a shooting star, shooting toward Long Qinian with unmatchable speed and precision.
