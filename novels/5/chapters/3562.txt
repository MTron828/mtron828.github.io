Chapter 3551

Endless flame runes filled this world when all the Heavenly Flame Spirits perished. They instantly turned into a giant sea of runes.

Under Long Chen’s pressure, Yan Xu’s son unleashed his greatest technique, which caused even Divine Venerate Heavenly Flame Spirits to self-detonate, almost blasting Long Chen apart.

This was truly a terrifying power, and it exceeded the scope of people’s understanding.

The entire Heavenly Flame World was practically boiling. Now, two huge whirlpools appeared. One of those was in Long Chen’s divine ring, and the other was the gaping maw behind Yan Hong.

Both of them were crazily devouring this world’s flame energy. Everyone could see giant currents of flames gushing toward them.

Many experts’ eyes reddened. That was pure Heavenly Flame energy. Ignoring the crumbling world around them, they also began to absorb this energy.

However, they were like ants nibbling on a feast. Both Long Chen and Yan Hong were absorbing ninety-nine percent of the flame energy, sucking it in like whales.

Long Chen then formed hand seals and chanted the Nirvana Scripture. As a result, a holy voice rang out within heaven and earth, and endless flame runes were affected and poured toward him.

Seeing this, Yan Hong was shocked and enraged. He was the king of the ten thousand flames. All flames within heaven and earth were under his command. But as Long Chen chanted the Nirvana Scripture, he found that the world’s flame energy was no longer fully obeying him. Moreover, Long Chen was absorbing the flame energy a bit faster than him.

“You aren’t a flame spiritual body! Are you not afraid of absorbing so much that you explode?” shouted Yan Hong as he absorbed the flames.

As he absorbed these flames, his originally listless aura began to thrum once more. Furthermore, his aura was crazily rising. He was growing stronger and stronger.

As for Long Chen, he ignored Yan Hong. It was true that such terrifying Heavenly Flame energy wasn’t something that Huo Linger could directly absorb.

However, that didn’t matter. He sent this current of flame energy straight into the primal chaos space. Under the light of the golden lotus seed, this current was like a tiger stripped of its claws and fangs. It instantly became docile sheep, floating in the air obediently.

Thus, Long Chen felt disdain for Yan Hong’s taunt. He could absorb as much of this Heavenly Flame energy as he wanted.

Even so, seeing Yan Hong’s aura crazily climbing, Long Chen’s heart was shaken. This Yan Hong was absolutely terrifying. With his power that could control this world’s flames, he was practically an unrivaled existence.

However, Long Chen knew that no one could truly be unrivaled. Yan Hong had caused the three Divine Venerate Heavenly Flame Spirits to detonate, but that didn’t mean that he could control them.

If he could really control them, he wouldn’t have made them detonate. Just by making them attack Long Chen all at once, Long Chen would have instantly died.

If Yan Hong was truly omnipotent, he also wouldn’t need to go to such lengths just to absorb this Heavenly Flame energy to strengthen himself. He had to have his own weaknesses.

Despite that, his power was completely bizarre. It was so powerful that it truly did spark despair.

Long Chen was absorbing the Heavenly Flame energy to limit Yan Hong’s absorption. Otherwise, if Yan Hong was allowed to absorb all the power of the Heavenly Flame World, Long Chen would definitely die.

Fortunately, the Nirvana Scripture was also an existence that could control the ten thousand flames of heaven and earth. Adding on the divine ring, its range grew explosively.

Huo Linger had also transformed into millions of tiny flame dragons around the edges of the divine ring, increasing its power. As a result, Long Chen’s absorption rate was faster than Yan Hong’s. That was the only thing that gave Long Chen any sense of comfort.

As for the other experts, they all panicked when they saw the Heavenly Flame energy of the world rapidly diminishing under the absorption of these two.

It was like these flame runes were already branded by the two of them. These experts also tried to absorb the runes with all their might, but the result was miniscule.

Seeing that they were unable to get any benefits, countless people were enraged. They could see the feast right before them but couldn’t consume it. How unbearable!

Hence, countless people eyed Long Chen and Yan Hong. Suddenly, someone made their move and silently shot toward Long Chen.

“It’s someone from the devil race! Long Chen, watch out!”

A startled expert shouted a warning. Although these people had no relationship with Long Chen, the devil race was the enemy of the human race. Hence, quite a few people shouted warnings to Long Chen.

Just then, that devil expert actually switched targets from Long Chen to Yu Qingxuan who was right behind him.

“Courting death!”

Long Chen was enraged. This devil expert was precisely the Immemorial Flame Devil who had said that he would kill Long Chen before entering the Heavenly Flame World.

“Long Chen, don’t get distracted. Focus on absorbing the flame energy. Our greatest enemy is Yan Hong, so leave this one to me,” transmitted Yu Qingxuan.

“You…!” Long Chen was anxious.

Yu Qingxuan had just used up all her recovered energy to block the detonations of three Divine Venerate Heavenly Flame Spirits. She didn’t have much energy left. How was she supposed to block this expert?

“Trust me. Focus on Yan Hong, or we’ll all die.” After saying that, Yu Qingxuan slashed her sword down on the void. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As a result, rainbow light unfurled and that Immemorial Flame Devil’s rushing figure vanished. He reappeared far outside the battlefield.

“What…?”

Startled cries rang out. No one knew what Yu Qingxuan had done. That expert was forced out completely bizarrely. According to reason, Yu Qingxuan was already exhausted, and this devil expert had no reason for fleeing like this.

“No, it was fairy Qingxuan’s attack. It contained spatial energy that sent him out. He didn’t retreat,” said someone who saw the truth.

“Slut of the human race, go to hell!” The Immemorial Flame Devil’s devil qi suddenly erupted. He was originally planning on a sneak attack, but since that had been ruined, he unleashed all his power. With his devil sword rumbling, he once more attacked Yu Qingxuan.

“Rainbow Prison!”

Yu Qingxuan’s sword suddenly left her hand and split apart. After forming hand seals, the rainbow sword transformed into pillars that descended from the heavens and pierced the land, fully trapping the devil expert inside.

“Break!” The Immemorial Flame Devil roared and his devil sword crazily attacked the cage. Because of it, endless flame energy erupted and the void shook.

Yu Qingxuan’s face was pale, and she repeatedly formed hand seals. As the devil expert attacked, blood began to leak out of her mouth, staining her white dress like scarlet flowers.

“Heavens, even without any energy left, she can still trap this Immemorial Flame Devil. If she was in peak condition, just how strong would she be?”

“It’s not the time for that! Don’t we have to help fairy Qingxuan? After all, she’s also from the human race.”

“No need. Look, Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others are already being heroes saving the beauty.”

Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others were flying out. But people’s expressions quickly changed.

“They’re not going to help fairy Qingxuan. They’re trying to kill Long Chen!”
