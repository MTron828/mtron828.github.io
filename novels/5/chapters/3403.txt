Chapter 3392 Ying Bokong

Long Chen raised his head and looked around. He was completely surrounded. Also, the few fellows that had been shaking in fear were instantly revitalized.

“Brat, now you’re doomed! This is our Falling Star Gate’s senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong! He’s the ninth rank heavenly genius of our junior generation, a part of the sacred Silver Wing Hawk Eagle race! Kneel and repent!”

Thousands of experts had come in response to the distress signal, but of all of them, it seemed that this Ying Bokong had the strongest aura.

Long Chen eyed this Ying Bokong whose Blood Qi was like a sea. He had sharp eyes and a hook nose. He was looking coldly at Long Chen, seemingly seeing through his weaknesses.

The majority of those that had come were mixed blood. There were only seven pure-blood demonic beasts. The rest were humans, but those humans weren’t even qualified to stand at the front. They stood behind the other experts, showing their own inferiority.

“Brat, what are you just staring for? Kneel and beg for mercy. Perhaps senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong will pity you and take you in as a servant, hahaha!” laughed one of those humans.

“I’d advise you to recognize kindness when you see it. Senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong’s power isn’t something that you can imagine. If you kneel now, you can still be spared.”

“That’s right. Don’t hesitate any longer. Although I want to see senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong’s amazing power, I know that he is merciful. Don’t make things hard on him. Hesitation won’t help.”

More and more of the human experts chided Long Chen. At the same time as they chided him, they repeatedly praised Ying Bokong’s kindness and strength. They fawned all over him, enraging Long Chen.

Just when did the human race fall to such a level? They needed to fawn on demonic beasts to survive? They humiliated their fellow humans in order to ingratiate themselves with the demonic beasts?

Although Long Chen wasn’t sure why such a thing would occur in the Integral Heaven Star-Field, it didn’t matter. The human race had to have their own dignity.

“Shut your mouths!”

Long Chen roared thunderously. As a result, a sound wave shattered the nearby mountains, and the people chiding Long Chen instantly felt their heads buzz. They coughed up blood and held their heads, their souls on the verge of collapse.

“Rather than properly being humans, you just had to turn yourselves into dogs. When did the human race need to beg for other people’s charity?! You’ve lost the face of the human race!”

Long Chen’s voice shook people’s souls. Their expressions changed. These experts had not expected this human to have such power. Only now did they realize that he was actually powerful.

“I didn’t expect to run into someone tough. Excellent. It just so happens that I need a fighter. Let me place a contractual slave mark on you. I guarantee that you will rise like a shooting star. I won’t treat you badly.”

Ying Bokong stepped forward, pleasantly surprised by Long Chen’s shout.

In the Integral Heaven Star-Field, the demonic beast race’s power stood at the peak of the cultivation world. They would pick out powerful humans to be their fighters. It could be considered the same as how humans took in demonic beasts as housepets. After forming a contract, they would battle their comrades.

However, there were many kinds of contracts. The most unfair ones were naturally the ones involving a slave mark. The person with the slave mark could have their life and death decided by a single thought from their master.

“Brat, senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong actually has such a high opinion of you. Hurry up and kneel,” said one of the humans. He was furious about having his soul in such pain. But even in his rage, he didn’t forget to praise Ying Bokong.

“Die!”

With a single bark, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength surged, and that guy’s head exploded. His headless corpse then fell to the ground.

“You’ll even sell out your own race. It’s clear that you’ve often helped those beasts bully humans. Keep talking and I’ll kill you,” said Long Chen furiously.

Helping others bully their own race… this was something that Long Chen viewed as a betrayal. In this lifetime, betrayal was the thing he couldn’t accept the most.

“Hahaha, even your Spiritual Strength is so powerful. Good, I really found a treasure this time. I, Ying Bokong, will offer you a chance to have a fair fight. Are you prepared?” Long Chen’s display only made Ying Bokong feel more excited. His Blood Qi was already starting to circulate.

A powerful housepet was also very important to the demonic beast race. Not only was it a display of power, but it was also a display of status.

A powerful housepet had to be subdued with powerful martial might and great bait. The demonic beast race’s common practice was to first defeat one, and then offer status, position, resources, and perhaps even beauties, making it sound as if submitting to them led to glory and riches, while resisting only led to death.

It was a simple and crude way to subdue the human race. But it was very effective. So Ying Bokong was very moved.

“I’m prepared. Are your feathers prepared?” Long Chen’s fury soared. He didn’t hate Ying Bokong, but he did hate these gutless humans.

Of course, saying that he would take Long Chen in as a housepet was also a great provocation, so Long Chen couldn’t hold himself back. Although he knew that this star-field was under the control of the demonic beasts, he no longer cared.

“Hahaha, excellent, this is the character that I want! I’ll break this character of yours and make you mine.”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ying Bokong laughed and spread his arms. The next moment, an eagle cry rang out and his Blood Qi instantly ignited. The other experts quickly retreated to avoid being blown far into the distance by these qi waves.

“Senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong is truly amazing. This aura alone is terrifying.”

“Heavens, I really am fortunate to get to see senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong fight again!”

“To be able to see senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong’s heroism once more, even in death, I can rest in peace.”

“This aura is a height that we humans could not achieve even if we cultivated for ten thousand years. This is the power of a holy bloodline. It truly is admirable.”

“...”

With Ying Bokong’s aura surging out, countless humans started fawning over him. That endless boot-licking was nauseating.

This wasn’t admiration that truly came from within them; it was more like a slave bending the knee and scraping any favor that they could.

Long Chen had the urge to kill all of those boot-lickers. He had never thought that a person could reach such a level of shamelessness. As expected, the world was huge and full of countless marvels.

The void rumbled as Ying Bokong’s aura shook everyone. It went without saying that his Blood Qi was truly powerful. His bloodline was very pure.

“Are you prepared? I’m about to attack. Remember, the person to defeat you is the great Ying Bokong, the heir of the Silver Wing Hawk Eagle’s bloodline. Do you know how many humans have begged me to take them in? I can’t even be bothered to reply to them. But you are different. Following me will be your life’s wisest decision,” said Ying Bokong arrogantly.

“If you’re prepared, just make your move. Today, if I don’t pluck all your feathers, you won’t understand that Boss Long San isn’t easy to provoke,” sneered Long Chen.

“Courting death!”

Ying Bokong shot through the air, his fingers like talons. His hand then became a silver claw as he instantly arrived in front of Long Chen.
