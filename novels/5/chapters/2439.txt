Chapter 2429 Mysterious Man

Translator: BornToBe

Mo Nian’s arrogant challenge made Di Feng sneer. He no longer viewed Mo Nian as a real opponent. He didn’t even care about him. In his heart, his only real opponent was Feng Fei. He was about to say a few mocking words to Mo Nian about learning his place when Mo Nian suddenly pointed to Tian Xiezi.

“Little fellow, you dare to cause trouble for my brother? Have you grown tired of living? Do you not know that Long Chen is under my protection? If you anger me, I’ll crush you in an instant. Do you want to test me?”

Mo Nian’s arrogance shocked everyone. Just what gave him this confidence to challenge Di Feng and then say that he could crush Tian Xiezi?

“If you want to die, I don’t mind helping you out!” Tian Xiezi was enraged by this provocation from someone who had just entered the Netherpassage realm.

Tian Xiezi already had a bellyful of anger due to being defeated by Long Chen and was looking for a way to wipe out that humiliation.

During this time, he had been taught by the Corrupt Emperor and the heroic spirits of the past peak experts of the Corrupt path. It could be said that he was now a completely different person. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

With his power having grown explosively, he was confident in being able to kill Long Chen, so he hadn’t been able to hold himself back from taunting him. It was to anger Long Chen, as well as to announce to everyone that he wanted revenge.

Mo Nian suddenly laughed. “You’ll help me out? Hahaha, excellent. I have never encountered a real opponent in my years of domination. I have started to grow tired of this life. This world is full of bitterness and vexation. Come, I’ve lived enough. Come kill me.”

Long Chen smirked. Mo Nian’s ego had grown. Only a Sovereign was qualified to say something.

“Come out and face your death then-” Tian Xiezi stepped forward, but the silent cloaked man beside him suddenly grabbed his arm.

“You aren’t a match for him.”

This mysterious man’s voice was only audible to him. Tian Xiezi was filled with disbelief. “You’re saying that I can’t beat him?!”

“You’ve misjudged him. You are a divine son, but he is also one. The divine seal in his body is over ten times denser than yours.”

“But… but that’s impossible! Didn’t you say that my divine seal can be considered outstanding amongst divine sons? How could his divine energy be so much greater?” demanded Tian Xiezi.

“His divine seal is very strange. According to reason, this level of divine energy isn’t something that he should be able to control. However, he is. Perhaps only he knows the secret of why. Due to both of you possessing divine seals, he will absolutely counter you. You don’t have any chance of beating him.”

“Then…” Tian Xiezi clenched his fist and ground his teeth. He had been looking for a chance to wipe out his disgrace now that his power had grown, but instead he encountered someone who was a perfect counter for him. That feeling made him want to cough up blood.

“Don’t worry. I will kill Mo Nian. You just have to handle Long Chen,” said the mysterious man indifferently.

“Hey, what are you two whispering? If you’re afraid, I don’t mind going two against one. One sheep, two sheep, it’s all the same to me,” said Mo Nian loudly.

Tian Xiezi coldly said, “Brat, I’ll let you be arrogant for now. Once we enter the Star Field Divine World, I will kill you and all the Righteous path’s disciples.”

Suddenly, an arrow blasted toward Tian Xiezi like a bolt of lightning. It came without any warning.

Tian Xiezi snorted and raised his hand, catching the arrow. But in that instant, the runes on the arrow lit up, and a ferocious aura erupted. Tian Xiezi’s expression changed.

The arrow exploded. Black qi covered Tian Xiezi, having protected him. However, the hand that he had caught the arrow with was a bloody pulp now, making people gasp.

They turned toward the Dragonblood Legion just in time to see Guo Ran slowly lowering his arm. There was an arm protector with four cylinders attached to it. That attack had come from him.

Guo Ran sneered, “Since we’re all enemies, why wait to enter the Star Field Divine World? We can settle things right now. The army of the Martial Heaven alliance can have a fight to the death with your Corrupt path right here and now. Anyone who doesn’t want to get impacted should leave.”

Killing intent suddenly raged through the air. This was a killing intent that terrified the surrounding experts. When the Dragonblood warriors unsheathed their swords, their killing intent made it feel like they were seeing a sea of blood.

The Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts followed suit, taking out their weapons. The other experts retreated, not wanting to get caught in between. If they died to some shockwaves from this battle, it would be a far too meaningless death.

The most shocking thing was how unified the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance were. They had never possessed such cohesiveness.

“Under Long Chen’s lead, the Righteous path’s sleeping lions have finally awoken,” praised Nangong Zuiyue upon seeing the sharp light in the eyes of the Righteous disciples.

“The name of the number one alliance wasn’t for nothing. When the alliance was first formed, they dominated the continent. But after the crisis, the will of the people scattered, and no expert that could subdue everyone else appeared, resulting in the Righteous path becoming scattered sand. Now though, with the dark era at hand, they have no choice but to work together to unleash their full potential. Also, they have an outstanding figure like Long Chen to lead them. The number one alliance of this world has finally regained its own nature.” Beitang Rushuang nodded along with Nangong Zuiyue.

This time, the Nangong and Beitang families had brought a hundred thousand disciples each, while the Dongfang family and the Ximen family had brought one hundred and twenty thousand disciples each. The four everlasting families had brought over four hundred thousand people altogether.

They could be considered a terrifying force. Meanwhile, the ancient races had only sent two hundred thousand disciples. The ancient races were the ones in the most awkward position.

They had originally relied on the Xuan Beasts and became enemies with Long Chen. Now that the Xuan Beasts had accepted the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race as their leader, the ancient races could be considered to still belong to the Xuan Beasts in title, but the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race never gave them a second glance.

The other Xuan Beasts also looked down on them, viewing them as opportunists who fled at danger and only came for benefits.

As for the human race, the ancient races had long since burned any goodwill with them. Even the Corrupt path and the ancient family alliance didn’t care about them.

There were no outstanding disciples amongst the ancient races any longer. Two hundred thousand pieces of cannon fodder were not viewed as important. Therefore, the ancient races no longer had any value and could only continue being humiliated as they stayed beneath the Xuan Beasts.

The Xuan Beasts had sent three hundred thousand experts. Although it looked to only be a hundred thousand more, they were true elites amongst elites.

Previously, Que Yuzhu had asked Long Chen about this. The Xuan Beasts had possessed five hundred and fifty thousand people qualified to enter the Star Field Divine World, but Long Chen had proposed sending only three hundred thousand. The focus was on quality, not quantity. Furthermore, the focus was on those with better brains. Fools would only slow the others down. Because of a single person’s foolishness, a whole pile of people could be dragged down.

The ancient family alliance had sent four hundred thousand disciples, which could be considered astounding. But the inexplicable thing was that the Corrupt path had sent over six hundred thousand disciples. Their numbers were only second to the Righteous path.

The most frightening thing about the Corrupt path was that their people all had a level of faith that made them fearless in battle. Now, they also had numbers.

With Long Chen and Tian Xiezi going against each other, the Righteous and Corrupt paths were poised to start a battle right here and now. Everyone’s hearts shook, but they were also feeling anticipation for this battle. It would be a world-shaking battle that they would witness.

“Foolish brats, do you really think that the Corrupt path is afraid of you?” The mysterious man beside Tian Xiezi finally spoke up. He slowly walked forward. “Since you want to die, you can die right now.”

This man was clearly the true leader of the Corrupt path now. Tian Xiezi was just an accompanying character, so just who was this person? Had he really come from the Corrupt God Cemetery like Long Chen had said?

“Mo Nian, when the battle starts, you and I have to beat that fellow immediately. Don’t hold back in the slightest. We have to eliminate him as fast as possible,” transmitted Long Chen.

“No need? I can handle him myself,” said Mo Nian confidently.

“Don’t be stupid. If my guess is correct, he should be a Sovereign sprout that the Corrupt path has been nourishing for tens of thousands of years. His power is definitely no less than Feng Fei’s.”

“What?!”
