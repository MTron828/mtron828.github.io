Chapter 4117 : Secret Concerns

Even Uncle Tree and Xu Jianxiong were blown back by that terrifying power. Buffeted by the astral winds, Xia Chen’s grand formation rumbled and countless cracks appeared on it. Seeing this scene, Xia Chen turned pale. This terrifying blow came far too suddenly, catching him off guard.

When the light faded, they could see that the sky and the earth were covered in cracks. This entire world had almost shattered.

“How dangerous. That dark domain lord detonated the dark laws of this world in an attempt to drag us down with it. Fortunately, most of the dark energy was already exhausted by us beforehand. How strange though. How can a dark domain lord possess intelligence?” wondered Xu Jianxiong. He was lost in thought as he examined the cracked world.

He didn’t understand, and the others understood even less than him. The detonation of the dark domain lord had used up the entire world’s dark energy, even igniting the other dark creatures.

Now, the world was littered with corpses, and no more dark creatures appeared.

“We’ve struck gold!”

When Guo Ran and Xia Chen saw countless ores through the cracks in the ground, their eyes reddened. It seemed that this land was filled with treasures.

Most importantly, they had only seen the tip of the iceberg. Who knew how many more treasures lay at the depths of this world?

“I’ll take a look.”

Long Chen spread his Kunpeng wings and transformed into a streak of light, heading to the depths of this world. He flew for over two hours before reaching the end of this world.

Seeing that this world was enormous, Long Chen was excited. From today onward, he was the master of this world. He had finally found a place of his own.

At the end of the world, he saw a giant spatial gate with black qi swirling around it like black flames. Dark energy was constantly entering this world from it.

“This should be the seam to the dark gate. Through the seam is the dark passageway, and through the passageway is the legendary dark world,” said Xu Jianxiong, arriving not long after Long Chen. “Long Chen, you’ve managed to claim this world, but defending it won’t be easy. You must be ready for the invasion of the dark creatures at any moment. Be careful.”

After all, claiming this world was not the hard part; guarding it was. They had taken the initiative with the attack, but on defense, they would become the passive party, and it might come at an immense price.

Xu Jianxiong actually hoped for Long Chen to abandon this place. After extracting the ores here, he could leave, and they would actually profit. However, if they were to stay here for a longer period, those ores would not make up for the costs.

“Uncle Xiong, don’t worry. My Dragonblood Legion has the best formation master and Forging Master. We can use formations, traps, equipment, and other things to make sure that guarding this place is no problem,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Long Chen knew that Xu Jianxiong was just worried about him. After staying here for too long, this place would have little value. But abandoning it after investing too much in it would be a shame.

After all, the Silver Moon World was also open to Long Chen. There was no need for Long Chen to pay such a high price to defend this place.

However, Xu Jianxiong had only seen Xia Chen and Guo Ran fight in combat and not their specialty. As long as they were given enough resources, then the things that they came up with would obliterate all the emerging dark creatures. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After all, Guo Ran had many secret weapons that he had yet to use. Even Long Chen didn’t know how many sinister tricks Guo Ran had up his sleeve.

Thus, as long as they claimed this world, then let alone some dark creatures, even dark domain lords would only be conned to death once they set up their defenses.

Hearing Long Chen’s explanation, Xu Jianxiong didn’t bother trying to change his mind. He knew that Long Chen was no ordinary youngster, so there was no need for him to worry too much. Just giving him a warning was all he needed to do.

“Uncle Xiong, tell me, why do you think the dark domain lord suddenly self-detonated?” asked Long Chen.

“That is what I am most worried about. A dark domain lord possesses low intelligence. So, other than running back to its nest to recover its dark energy, it only knows how to fight. But it was abnormal this time. I suspect that there is an old monster of the dark race behind this gate that gave orders to that dark domain lord,” said Xu Jianxiong slowly.

“Some old monster?” Long Chen jumped. “Then will it come out as well?”

“It should be impossible. If it could do so, it would have long since come out and slaughtered us,” said Xu Jianxiong. “I suspect that this old monster knew that we were attacking this world, which was why it forced another dark domain lord to come through. If not for that, there should be no way for one world to give rise to two dark domain lords. Furthermore, the one who was forced through was still unable to beat us, so it received orders to blow up the world.”

Long Chen looked at the gate and felt a cold chill on the back of his neck. He felt like two sinister eyes were peering through the gate at him.

“Then can it send more dark domain lords at any time?” asked Long Chen hesitantly, his confidence shaken.

“It managed to force another dark domain lord, but this gate is nothing more than a seam in the dark gate. Don’t forget that my Fullmoon race’s seal is still on the gate, so forcing their way through the seams is not easy. The more powerful the existence, the more difficult it is to enter. I believe that it must cost a great deal to send a dark domain lord through the seam. The dark domain lord that forced its way here clearly had a stronger aura than the previous one, but its actual power was lower. It is precisely because forcing its way through the seam injured it a great deal, causing its power to drop. Furthermore, it was in a rush to kill us, so it had no time to recover. Thus, we easily managed to deal with it. Also, for that old monster behind the gate to react so slowly and clumsily, its own intelligence is probably very limited,” deduced Xu Jianxiong.

Long Chen nodded. If that was the case, he was much more at ease. If he was prepared, then even if a dark domain lord came every ten days, Long Chen and the others would still be able to kill it easily.

“Long Chen, since you want this world, I’ll activate the star-field core. But once it is activated, there’s no going back.” Xu Jianxiong took out a square crystal. As soon as it appeared, Long Chen sensed the laws of the Heavenly Daos swirling around it.

“Then many thanks, Uncle Xiong.”

Xu Jianxiong nodded and shattered the crystal that had countless runes on top of it. That was its seal. When the seal was removed, this world quivered intensely. The next moment, countless runes flew out of the crystal and merged into this world.

In the blink of an eye, this entire world seemed to come to life. The land healed, and the laws grew more complete, causing spiritual qi to flood through the spatial cracks.

When this spiritual qi entered this world, the Dragonblood warriors shouted excitedly. They were shocked to find that the spiritual qi here was actually several times denser than in the Silver Moon World.
