Chapter 4181: Exposed

“Thirty Eternal corpses and two Eternal divine weapons! Both divine weapons belong to your human race!”

Long Chen had barely finished speaking when someone immediately made a sky-high bid, one that could scare others to death.

“Are you crazy?!”

Startled cries rang out. Was this person intent on going bankrupt just to buy this cauldron?

Clearly, this person had placed their highest possible bid. Having missed out on the Earth Cauldron, they couldn’t afford to miss the Heaven Cauldron as well.

If there had been any lingering doubts about the authenticity of the bronze cauldron before, those doubts had now completely evaporated.

Some ancient powers were aware that the Heaven Earth Cauldron was split in two forms. So, now that the Heaven Cauldron had appeared, along with the images provided by the Soaring Dragon Company, they were sure that it was real.

The Heaven Earth Cauldron was a primal chaos divine item of incalculable value. In everyone’s mind, that Ghost Dao lifeform had gotten a great bargain by acquiring it at such a low price. As a result, no one was willing to let this opportunity slip through their fingers.

“Fifty-eight Eternal corpses and seven Eternal divine weapons, three of which belong to the human race!” Devil qi erupted along with an ancient voice.

“Heavens!”

Everyone was silent after this bid. This elder’s finances were unmatched, and his offer made everyone retreat.

Long Chen looked around and smiled. “It seems that there’s no need to count, as no one can offer a higher bid. Congratulations!”

Bang!

Long Chen then slammed his wooden hammer down, and this matter was done. After that, the private room was opened, and an elder with a silver mask walked out.

This was an innate Heaven Venerate from the devil race with an exceedingly terrifying aura. But even he didn’t dare to expose his face. His aura had gone through several transformations just to prevent others from telling who he was.

“Gimme.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Long Chen directly extended a hand, and the elder wasted no words and handed him a world stone. After grabbing it, before Long Chen could even sense what was inside the world stone, a terrifying sensation of death enveloped him.

Long Chen then roared furiously, thinking that this elder was scheming against him, so he smashed his fist forward.

However, the moment he attacked, he realized that he had wrongly blamed this devil race’s elder. That was because the latter was also roaring and retreating with the cauldron. He actually thought that Long Chen was the one sneak-attacking him.

BOOM!

The next moment, the entire stage exploded and terrifying qi waves unfurled. The immense power tore through the roof, causing countless experts to be sent flying.

This sudden change caught everyone off-guard. They had no idea what was happening.

“Long Chen, you swindler! Die!”

A sinister roar rang out, filling this place. When everyone heard that voice, they jumped as they recognized the speaker.

It was that Ghost Dao lifeform that had just vanished with the Earth Cauldron. However, it had come back and attacked Long Chen.

At this moment, Long Chen’s fist struck a strange barrier of light, and the impact caused his Blood Qi to churn within him, forcing him to retreat several steps.

However, when Long Chen saw that figure, he laughed. This fellow ended up coming one step too late. That was fortunate, or the second fake wouldn’t have been sold.

“What nonsense are you talking about? That Heaven Earth Cauldron went through the Soaring Dragon Company’s appraisers! How could I have swindled you?!” demanded Long Chen innocently.

“What dogshit Heaven Earth Cauldron!?”

That Ghost Dao lifeform suddenly extended a hand, summoning a bronze cauldron.

However, now it had lost its color. The cauldron no longer had its sacred might, and its aura had also changed. It was like it had lost all life.

BOOM!

With a shake, specks of rust flew off of the cauldron. When it happened, its original form was revealed.

“This garbage is obviously newly crafted! You dare to present this as a counterfeit?! Die!” The lifeform sent the bronze cauldron flying at Long Chen’s head.

BOOM!

Long Chen swung his fist, causing the cauldron to fly away and roll into the distance.

When it rolled in front of people, they let out startled cries. There was now a dent in the cauldron from Long Chen’s fist. In fact, its entire shape had changed.

Everyone was stunned. If it were the real Heaven Earth Cauldron, how could it be so weak? It had to be a fake.

As for the devil expert who was tightly holding the Heaven Cauldron, his expression also underwent a dramatic shift. All of a sudden, he found that the Heaven Cauldron’s sacred aura was fading away rapidly as well, its radiance diminishing.

He then unleashed a punch at the cauldron as well, causing it to dent. As a result, his body began to quiver with rage.

“Long Chen!”

A furious hiss-like roar came from him as his terrifying killing intent unfurled.

“Hey, don’t get emotional!” Long Chen hastily waved his hands. “Everyone, let’s discuss it. I found two bronze cauldrons, but I never said that they were the Heaven Earth Cauldron! I already discussed this with the Soaring Dragon Company-”

Long Chen’s expression ‘suddenly changed’, as if he had just misspoken. He hastily corrected himself, “This was all me… and the Soaring Dragon Company… and… and… That’s right, this matter has nothing to do with the Soaring Dragon Company!”

Long Chen seemed panicked, as if trying to speak up for the Soaring Dragon Company, yet being too panicked to explain properly. Upon seeing this, the Soaring Dragon Company’s experts were horrified. Long Chen was trying to get them killed.

Just then, rays of divine light rose from all eight directions, and a formation rose from the ground, causing Long Chen to feel a chill. He had been locked down by a grand formation.

“Long Chen, don’t spout nonsense! Today, don’t even think about leaving alive without giving everyone a proper explanation!” shouted an innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company. He was the one to activate the grand formation.

Buzz.

However, to his surprise, the formation suddenly went out of control. As soon as he activated it, it was no longer under his command.

The next moment, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others appeared beside Long Chen. Furthermore, the grand formation’s divine light concentrated on them.

“Boss, we should hurry! The Soaring Dragon Company already said that they’d cut off any chasers! As for dividing the loot, we’ll deal with it in the future!” shouted Xia Chen, crushing a talisman in his hand.

BOOM!

Countless experts shot toward Long Chen, but they were too slow. Their attacks didn’t even manage to touch Long Chen’s clothes before he and his companions vanished.

Furthermore, once Long Chen was gone, everyone’s gaze turned to the Soaring Dragon Company’s people.

“You dare to collude with him to swindle us?! You can all die!”

The Ghost Dao’s lifeform roared, and his black qi instantly devoured this space.
