Chapter 3798 Two-Headed Monster

Chains flew through the air, covering the sky, as well as three people. Of those three people, one wore armor, and one held a talisman in his hand. They were Guo Ran and Xia Chen. Both of them were covered in blood. Beside them was a graceful, long-haired woman.

Her eyes were bright, and her hair fluttered behind her. She was like a fairy with a bright rune shining on her forehead. At this moment, a powerful grand qi swirled around her entire body. She wielded her sword and repeatedly blocked the attacks of a powerful devil expert. This woman was the original devil race’s Yue Xiaoqian.

Waves of Sword Qi came flying out of Yue Xiaoqian’s sword, forcing back the devil expert in front of them.

This expert was a monster with devil qi swirling around him. He had two heads, and his green fur covered his entire body. His bronze eyes were filled with an ominous light. Whenever he opened his bloody mouth, his sharp sawteeth were revealed. Just looking at him gave others chills.

His devil qi was raging. Not using a weapon, he simply blocked Yue Xiaoqian’s attacks with his bare hands. However, her sword actually caused a clanking sound whenever it struck his body, as if it had struck metal.

Even so, this two-headed devil expert seemed to be very apprehensive of Yue Xiaoqian’s aura. Although her sword was unable to harm him, he didn’t dare to press her too far.

As for Xia Chen and Guo Ran, they were surrounded by countless experts from the demonic beast race, the Blood race, the Netherworld, and even the human race.

The human experts included the assassins from the Bloodkill Hall and the Nine Underworld Hall, as well as the experts of the Sacred Pill Hall. Thousands of them were attacking Guo Ran and Xia Chen. Hence, the two of them were in a miserable state. 

There were too many experts, and they were all top experts as well. If they weren’t Supreme Immortal Kings, then they were Divine Venerates. It was exhausting. As the two of them had been fighting intensely for a long time, they started to find it hard to endure.

Not far from the battlefield was a large red-haired man with a terrifying gaze. He was overlooking the battle coldly like a tiger waiting to catch its prey. His gaze was terrifying.

If Long Chen was here, he would instantly recognize him. He was the Sacred Pill Hall’s top genius, Yin Changsheng.

Yin Changsheng had yet to take action. Instead, he simply led a group of people standing at the edge of the battlefield, seemingly waiting for something.

Outside of the battlefield was an endless army of devil experts. They were forming hand seals and releasing devil qi that condensed into chains that locked down this region.

“We have to leave while the Heavenly Devil Hunting Space Formation is not yet fully formed! Otherwise, it’ll be too late!” Yue Xiaoqian eyed the chains covering the sky nervously.

“Sister Xiaoqian, don’t worry. Boss is about to arrive.” Xia Chen shouted as his talisman glowed and repeatedly blocked the attacks of multiple experts.

“It’s a trap! They’re doing it on purpose! Can you not see? That red-haired person is waiting for Long Chen!” said Yue Xiaoqian anxiously.

Just now, when Yin Changsheng arrived, someone pointed to Xia Chen and Guo Ran and whispered a few things to him. That was noticed by Yue Xiaoqian.

Last time, Yin Changsheng had suffered at Long Chen’s hands. Long Chen had stolen the Ice Soul from him, and that was viewed as a huge humiliation to him.

After that happened, he directly mobilized the entire forces of the Sacred Pill Hall to search for Long Chen. However, Long Chen ended up running off multiple times.

Even then, it had to be said that the Sacred Pill Hall’s power was truly enormous. Long Chen was famous in the Violet Flame Heaven, so it wasn’t difficult to learn about him.

After that, even the people associated with him were quickly investigated. Now, unable to find Long Chen, they ended up targeting Xia Chen and Guo Ran.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran had run over from Silver Moon City when they heard that the devil race was attacking someone from the original devil race. As soon as they came out, the Sacred Pill Hall’s people followed and surrounded them. They then informed Yin Changsheng, who quickly arrived.

Once Yin Changsheng arrived, he directly ordered for the three of them to be surrounded and not killed. What shocked people was that the devil race actually didn’t dare to defy his orders. They began setting up the Heavenly Devil Hunting Space Formation.

“Don’t worry. As long as boss arrives, everything will be resolved!” promised Guo Ran.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

His armor’s runes were already starting to dim. Having been fighting for too long, he had killed over ten Divine Venerates already, but his battle armor was running out of energy.

However, his Devil Dragon Battle Armor was still very powerful. Even after fighting for so long, it wasn’t the slightest bit damaged.

Regretfully, there were too many experts, so he and Xia Chen were powerless to bring Yue Xiaoqian out of their encirclement. They could only endure and wait for Long Chen to save them.

“Hahaha! How laughable. You’re already turtles caught in a jar, yet you’re thinking about leaving alive? Are you trying to make me laugh to death?” laughed that two-headed devil expert.

He actually spoke from both heads, causing his voice to layer. It stabbed into people’s ears like needles.

“Girl, we’ve hunted you for over ten days. I don’t even know how many experts we have sacrificed. You can die happy. Tell me where your tribe is and I can spare you from the pain of the corpse devil soul refinement. Otherwise, you will have to suffer that pain and become my puppet. Hehe, as a tool to sate my lust, I don’t know where to start with such a beauty.” The two-headed devil laughed lecherously.

“Damn devil monster, if I was in my top condition, would you have the guts to have a direct fight with me?!” Yue Xiaoqian clenched her teeth furiously. She repeatedly attacked, forcing him back some distance.

When Yue Xiaoqian arrived in the three thousand worlds, her goal was to undergo her special tribulation. She had to fully awaken her divine seal on her forehead during this tribulation. Only then could she condense the original devil race’s special Heavenly Dao Crown.

The quickest method for awakening her divine seal in the heavenly tribulation was to kill more experts of the devil race, especially the more powerful heavenly geniuses. Killing them would rapidly awaken her divine seal.

That was why Yue Xiaoqian had taken the risk of sneaking into the devil race’s territory to undergo tribulation. As a result, almost everyone who underwent tribulation with her died, and only two people managed to pass. One was Yue Xiaoqian, while the other was this two-headed monster.

During the tribulation, the two of them were fighting evenly, and neither side was able to suppress the other. But when the tribulation ended and Yue Xiaoqian’s divine seal lit up with holy light, that two-headed monster was immediately suppressed and forced to flee.

However, the devil race’s experts had also encircled Yue Xiaoqian in huge numbers during this time. They were even willing to use a self-sacrificial bloodline curse just to pollute the holy light of her divine seal, weakening her suppressive effect on them.

After over ten days of hunting, the devil race’s corpses littered the ground. It was unknown just how many of them Yue Xiaoqian had killed. But the devil race refused to give up and continued to chip away at her, grinding her down.

As for the two-headed monster, after resting a bit, he also came back like a tumor, refusing to let her off, not giving her any chance to breathe. This battle had continued all the way until now.

“Damn original devil race, you should never have been born! Let’s see if you can still act so aloof once I strip you of all your clothes!” The two-headed monster roared furiously, and devil qi erupted from his entire body. He forcibly charged through Yue Xiaoqian’s holy light, his claws repeatedly striking her.

Yue Xiaoqian repeatedly blocked with her sword. However, after fighting for so many days, she was already exhausted. With one slip, her sleeve was torn off, and three bloody marks appeared on her skin because of the two-headed monster’s long claws. Fresh blood then dripped to the ground.

The two-headed monster sniffed his prize and smiled sinisterly. “This is only the start. Slowly savor it!”

He once more attacked. Further away, Guo Ran and Xia Chen were enraged. They pushed themselves to break free of the encirclement of the experts around them. Those experts were sent flying.

However, both of them then let out a grunt as they smashed into an invisible wall. They were forced back.

“Faith energy?!” Xia Chen and Guo Ran were both shocked. They then looked at Yin Changsheng.

“Hahaha!”

Just then, the two-headed monster finally found an opening and reached a claw straight for Yue Xiaoqian’s collar.

“Fuck off!”

All of a sudden, thunder rumbled and a black figure appeared. When killing intent filled this entire world, a hand viciously slapped that two-headed monster’s face.
