Chapter 3585

In terms of power, Guo Ran wasn’t a match for Wang Zixu. Moreover, it wasn’t just Wang Zixu. Even Xie Liuer and Leng Hui were slightly stronger than Guo Ran.

That was because Guo Ran had spent too little time in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College and had been constantly suppressed by all sides, restricting him and leaving him unable to grasp certain resources.

Furthermore, Wang Zixu and the others’ battle armors were made out of the very best materials. It wasn’t just their own bodies that were powerful, they also had the support of their families. Hence, it could be said that Guo Ran didn’t lose in terms of talent and intelligence, but in terms of background and wealth.

Wang Zixu and the others naturally looked down on Guo Ran, but they were also deeply afraid of his forging talent. It was precisely due to this that they constantly suppressed him. Their sneers and mockery were to cover up their own worry. They were afraid of being surpassed.

Guo Ran didn’t even have any assurance against Leng Hui and Xie Liuer, let alone the strongest amongst them, Wang Zixu.

However, Long Chen’s words set him at ease. He had no confidence in himself, but he had absolute confidence in Long Chen.

Guo Ran was about to agree when a person walked out of the crowd and sneered, “What? Are you afraid? If you’re afraid, then hurry up and scram out of the Heavenly Dragon- Ah!”

“Fuck off!” Guo Ran kicked that person in the crotch, causing him to tumble to the ground and hold his crotch with both hands, rolling. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“All day, you only know how to help dogs eat crap. The price of crap has even appreciated in value due to your consumption!” Guo Ran kicked him away.

This person was quite the unlucky fellow. Normally, he was useless and only knew how to suck up. But this time, he had just arrived and joined the crowd. Seeing Wang Zixu challenging Guo Ran, he immediately jumped in to show his support for Wang Zixu, not knowing about Guo Ran’s current status.

“Wang Zixu, I’ve endured a long time. Since you dare to challenge me, fine, I’ll give you a chance. Don’t say that I’m bullying you. You just spent a batch of resources yesterday and fought a large battle, so I’ll give you three days to recuperate. Three days later, let us meet on the life-and-death stage. This time, we will determine who is higher and who is lower, as well as life and death,” said Guo Ran coldly.

Upon hearing Guo Ran’s words, everyone’s heart shook. Guo Ran had always been enduring silently in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. He had never dared to directly face the other three heroes. That was what resulted in his position being the lowest amongst the four heroes.

However, today, Guo Ran suddenly grew unyielding. Not only did he want to decide who was stronger between himself and Wang Zixu, but he also wanted to decide life and death. That was astonishing.

“Alright, then I’ll wait for you. Three days later, I will smash you and your garbage armor apart, showing you that a lowly ascender is not qualified to be mentioned in the same sentence as us,” sneered Wang Zixu.

Hearing that, Long Chen narrowed his eyes slightly. This fellow had also angered Long Chen with this sentence. Now, killing intent burned in his eyes.

Normally, if others insulted him, he wouldn’t care too much. But he was unable to accept someone insulting his brothers. Just from Wang Zixu’s arrogant tone, Long Chen could tell just how much grievance Guo Ran had suffered during this time.

The moment Long Chen’s killing intent was unleashed, the clear sky began to change color, and the air became cold and dark. People felt a chill deep in their bones.

As for Wang Zixu, his back suddenly turned cold, and his hair stood on end. It felt like an ancient beast had suddenly set its sights on him. Hence, an intense sensation of danger welled up within his soul. He stared at Long Chen in horror.

Long Chen hadn’t unleashed any aura at all. He was only looking at Wang Zixu coldly. However, the killing intent exuding from his body caused the space around him to twist. Everyone was stunned by that.

They were unable to imagine how a person’s killing intent could manifest physical changes and affect spacetime.

Only then did they take note that this person was so young that he didn’t seem fit to be the dean of the High Firmament Academy. In any case, he was an absolutely terrifying existence!

“I’ll give you a single warning. Keep your mouth clean, or I’ll kill you before the three days are up,” said Long Chen coldly.

His voice was heavy and icy. It didn’t contain the slightest emotion, yet it was filled with the powerful confidence of an expert. It shook people to the core.

Wang Zixu’s expression changed several times. He wanted to retort, sneer, and express that he didn't care about Long Chen in the slightest. But he didn’t dare to.

He had a premonition that if he dared to do that, Long Chen would strike like lightning. Thus, he didn’t dare to move. He was afraid that the slightest thing might bring forth Long Chen’s attack.

He even felt that he wouldn’t even have a chance to summon his battle armor before Long Chen’s attack landed. It seemed that none of the people around him could protect him.

“Hmph, big words. Let’s talk about it in three days!” Wang Zixu merely snorted and left.

However, many sharp-eyed people spotted the light coming from the back of his neck. That was the reflection of his sweat. Did Wang Zixu just get scared away? That made people gasp. The grand leader of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes had been scared to the point of sweating by someone. If this information spread, just how many jaws would drop to the floor?

“Boss is mighty!” Seeing that Long Chen was able to scare off Wang Zixu with just a gaze, Guo Ran chortled, feeling very pleased.

“What might? You were bullied for over a year by idiots like this? Just how did you survive in this world?” Long Chen looked at Guo Ran disappointedly, seemingly let down.

“Isn’t that only because I had no choice?! Boss, I’m not you!” Guo Ran shrugged, feeling a bit wronged.

Long Chen took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. The reason he was angry was because he just noticed how much his brother had suffered.

However, thinking about it carefully, Guo Ran truly couldn’t do anything. He couldn’t beat them. It wasn’t as if he could directly challenge them to a life-and-death match. Otherwise, it would be no different than sending himself to his death.

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen patted Guo Ran’s shoulder. He was very angry, but he also felt sorry for this brother of his. Guo Ran had never been very tough. For him to suffer humiliation here just to survive made Long Chen feel ashamed. The great general of the Dragonblood Legion had actually fallen to the point of being bullied by anyone. Thinking of this, Long Chen felt aggrieved. He wanted to smash the entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College apart.

“I’m sorry, boss. I’ve lost you face,” said Guo Ran shamefully when he saw Long Chen’s expression.

“Good brother, what are you talking about? It’s your boss’s fault. I didn’t look after you properly, causing you to fall to this point. Your boss swears that starting today, no one will dare to bully you. As for those people that bullied you before, I’ll make them kneel and beg for forgiveness.”

Long Chen eyed the surrounding experts, his gaze as sharp as a blade. As a result, those late stage World Kings felt their hearts pounding wildly. It felt like a sharp blade was pressed against their throats.

“Hehe, I know that with you here, I’ll never get bullied!” said Guo Ran with a simple-minded chortle.

“Let’s go. I’ll help you improve yourselves. Three days later, whatever grievances you have will be settled.”

After that, Long Chen and Guo Ran simply passed through the crowd, vanishing from their sight. Not a single person dared to block them.

As for the dean, standing in his palace, he saw everything. Right now, an unfathomable smile appeared on his face.

“The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College has been silent for so long like dead water. Now I can see some liveliness, hehe!”
