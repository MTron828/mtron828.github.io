Chapter 4393 Meddler

Little Crane cried out in fright and ran back. However, she wasn’t really running, as that spherical lifeform was carrying her away to protect her.

Initially, this spherical lifeform harbored intense resentment at the prospect of becoming someone else's housepet. However, it swiftly discerned that Little Crane possessed a peculiar aura, one that seemed to unravel a bottleneck it had been trapped in for countless years.

Displaying a remarkable level of intelligence, the lifeform observed that whenever Little Crane experienced joy, she emitted a rainbow mist. Remarkably, this mist played a crucial role in loosening its longstanding bottleneck.

In light of this discovery, the lifeform abandoned any aversion to its fate. Instead, it embraced the change with joy, diligently striving to make Little Crane happy.

Thus, when this person came flying toward them, it immediately retreated to protect Little Crane as she seemed to possess no combat power at all. As for Long Chen, it didn’t need to care.

Many people cried out in shock when that figure charged toward Long Chen. Just as they thought that he would be smashed into a pulp and directly killed, Long Chen extended a hand and easily caught that figure. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As it turned out, this person wasn’t attacking Long Chen, nor was he the one to shout just now. This person was an early World King just like Long Chen, and he was pale with fright.

Inside the shop, there were several muscular experts with wings on their backs, and they had powerful Blood Qis. With just a glance, it was clear that they were from the demonic beast race.

“Many thanks for saving my life.” That person hastily thanked Long Chen for catching him.

“Little fellow, are you trying to be meddlesome?” asked one of those experts of the Feather race, glaring at Long Chen hostilely.

“Sorry, sorry, it was just a misunderstanding! Please calm down. This old man can compensate you. He’s just a newcomer who doesn’t know the rules and offended you, so please have mercy. Zhang Zhao, shouldn’t you hurry over and apologize? If they didn’t have mercy, you would already be dead.” A half-step Eternal walked out from inside the shop, bobbing his head repeatedly in apology toward those Feather race experts.

In the past, the appearance of a half-step Eternal in the Darklight Heaven would have been a remarkable event. However, with the surge of primal chaos qi, numerous individuals seized the opportunity for advancement. Many hidden old experts capitalized on it, successfully reaching the half-step Eternal realm.

Even in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, half-step Eternals were not much. As for in the Darklight Heaven, with eighteen world gates opened, experts at the half-step Eternal level had become as numerous as grains of sand.

Therefore, this elder didn’t dare to use his higher realm to suppress others, bowing toward those World Kings of the Feather race. He only turned toward that fellow in Long Chen’s hand at the end, casting him an intentful glance.

Clearly, this elder was trying to smooth things over and didn’t wish to incur the wrath of these Feather race experts. He knew that Zhang Zhao was resentful over this, but this elder hoped that he could swallow that resentment and let this matter end here. After all, there were many lifeforms that they could not provoke here.

Seemingly inexperienced, Zhang Zhao didn’t understand the elder’s look. Hearing that the elder wanted him to apologize, he quivered with rage. “They are the ones who are wrong. When do people ever eat medicinal pills before paying? They’ve eaten the pills but refuse to pay, and they even said that our medicinal pills are fake! Now, they want us to apologize for it? Even if I have to die, I won’t apologize to these animals!”

Feeling aggrieved, Zhang Zhao could not contain his emotions, causing an immediate shift in the old shopkeeper's expression. Referring to these lifeforms as animals was a grave offense.

“You dare to argue with me, you scoundrel? I'll teach you a lesson!” scolded the elder.

As he lunged toward Zhang Zhao, someone from the Feather race intercepted the elder before he could reach his target.

“There’s no need for you to teach him a lesson. I’ll do it.”

The Feather race expert's razor-sharp claw extended toward Zhang Zhao's throat, accompanied by a surge of potent Blood Qi and intense killing intent, leaving no doubt about his intention to kill.

This expert was quite powerful, whereas Zhang Zhao was a mere shop assistant. Despite being in the same realm, Zhang Zhao had only attained this realm because he was born in the right generation. His inherent strength was extremely ordinary.

However, just as the Feather race expert’s attack was about to land, he suddenly found himself unable to move.

Just as everyone thought that Zhang Zhao was about to die, a hand caught the claw, dissipating its terrifying aura without a trace.

Everyone was shocked as they looked at the black-robed youngster with the strange hairstyle behind Zhang Zhao. They hadn’t expected this person to actually be a hidden expert.

“Brat, you are courting death!” the Feather expert shouted. He tried to pull his hand away, but he was unable to shake Long Chen.

Long Chen simply tightened his grip, and a scream ripped through the air. The Feather race expert's claw was forcibly torn off.

“Bastard!”

The other experts of the Feather race furiously shot forward.

“Master, there’s no need to waste your power. Let me do it!” The spherical lifeform actually took the initiative to attack.

At that moment, the sound of bones breaking resonated through the air. Long Chen's movements were so swift that people couldn't even perceive them. The Feather race experts who had been charging at him found their arms and legs ripped off, and a chorus of agonizing screams reverberated.

“It’s over… Everything’s over…”

The old shopkeeper was as pale as paper. For this matter to occur in his shop, there was no way for him to escape any connection to it.

“Gather the wares and get ready to run.”

The old half-step Eternal directly sighed and prepared to leave. However, the other assistants were too terrified to move. Looking at the Feather race’s experts lying on the ground screaming in pain, they didn’t know what to do.

“You’re quite vicious. If you have the guts, try to kill us all! Otherwise, the Feather race will chase you to the ends of the world and destroy your sect and family until no one remains!” declared the leader of this group through clenched teeth.

“Killing you would be boring. Let’s go bigger. Go and gather your people. I will wait for you here,” responded Long Chen lightly, not even displaying a hint of anger in the face of the threat.

Perhaps one would get angry if a monkey cursed at them, but would anyone take an ant seriously?

“You dare to let us off?” asked one of them, his eyes brightening.

“Are you stupid? I was going to let you off just like that, but since you’re so smart, I’ll give you some encouragement.”

Following that, screams rang through the air as Long Chen tore off their wings, splattering the shop with blood.

“Go gather your people. I’ll give you two hours. If you don’t return in time, don’t blame me for not giving you the chance to get your revenge. Scram!”

Long Chen kicked them out, leaving those experts filled with rage. Losing their wings was like crippling their cultivation bases, an absolute disgrace. Fueled by this disgrace, they hastily fled.

As they departed, numerous shops on the street shuttered their doors, and the entire city descended into a state of fear.

“Damn humans, how dare you bully my Feather race?!”

Long Chen had just walked out of the shop when more experts came charging over. A figure shot toward him like a shooting star.
