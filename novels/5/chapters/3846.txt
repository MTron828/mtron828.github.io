Chapter 3835 I’ll Fulfill Your Wish

Long Chen and the others had never expected this elder to suddenly wake up at this time. As soon as he spoke, he exposed their position.

Although the others could not see them, as long as they launched random attacks, the flying shuttle would definitely be exposed. Furthermore, other than fleeing, this flying shuttle didn’t have much defensive ability. With no other choice, Mo Nian put away the flying shuttle. Long Chen and the others appeared on top of the Fusang Tree.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate. The dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian. All the treasures here have a destiny with me. I’m sure you’ve heard that noble men don’t take other people’s things. Friends, I’d ask that you step back and not interfere in my matters, thank you!” Mo Nian smiled while looking at Yin Changsheng and the other people’s shocked expressions.

“Long Chen!”

Shi Yang, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and Ji Wuming all glared at Long Chen with blazing killing intent.

Of the four of them, three of them had suffered at the hands of Long Chen. The Nine Underworld Luocha in particular had been captured and tortured half-dead by him. Her hatred for Long Chen had reached an indescribable level.

“Hey, can you not be like this? Give me some face. I’m speaking here.” Mo Nian was embarrassed. These fellows actually acted like they didn’t see him, only glaring at Long Chen.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even the one that he had previously fought, Yin Changsheng, was acting like he didn’t notice Mo Nian. That made him want to curse.

At this moment, the void tore apart, and a sword came out of its sheath. The first to attack was the Nine Underworld Luocha. She didn’t bother saying anything and directly launched a killing blow.

As her sword fell, giant ripples appeared in the air. This sword possessed incredible power that was perfectly condensed; not the slightest bit of it was dissipating. All her power was firmly locked within the sword itself.

The Nine Underworld Luocha’s techniques were now completely different from before. Even such a terrifying power could be perfectly controlled by her. This level of control was astonishing.

The Minghong Saber also came out of its sheath, accompanied by a dragon cry that shook the world. When Long Chen’s seven-color divine ring lit up, the Minghong Saber slashed down.

BOOM! The moment the Nine Underworld Luocha’s sword met the Minghong Saber, earth-shattering power exploded.

Explosive power unfurled, causing the Fusang Tree beneath Long Chen’s feet to sway. The bodies that were originally lying on it rained down.

With this one blow, the Nine Underworld Luocha was blown back. On the other hand, thanks to the support of the seven-color divine ring, only half of the Nine Underworld Luocha’s power reached Long Chen, while the other half was dissipated into the void.

As countless corpses fell from the Fusang Tree, Long Chen reached out. After that, threads of lightning flew out and bound those corpses.

“Get in here!”

Long Chen shouted and forcibly pulled the corpses into the primal chaos space. They directly landed in the black soil.

“Die!”

Seeing Long Chen grab so many of the immemorial corpses, Shi Yang was enraged and directly attacked him with his fist.

Long Chen’s saber once more slashed down. When they collided, metallic ringing rang out along with the appearance of countless sparks. The immense power caused the void to collapse.

“Devil Suppression!”

Suddenly, Yue Xiaoqian cried out. Her Devil Suppressing Seal lit up.

When its light enveloped Shi Yang, countless runes on his body began to burn.

“AH! Damn original devil race!”

Shi Yang roared furiously. He had just obtained this new body and had yet to fully merge with it. Perhaps it was no problem to use for fighting considering how tough this body was, but the original devil race was his bane. Without full control of this body, he couldn’t resist Yue Xiaoqian’s Devil Suppression Seal. In this aspect, this new body was a far cry from his original body, so his fatal weakness was fully exposed.

Long Chen’s Minghong Saber then knocked aside Shi Yang’s fist and slashed down on his neck. Shi Yang’s head flew. Under Yue Xiaoqian’s Devil Suppression Seal, his body’s defenses were instantly broken. The corpse began to rot; it was no longer impervious.

“Kill that woman of the original devil race!”

Shi Yang roared. Even with his head off, he was fine. His voice came from his chest. Following his order, countless Supreme devil experts charged at Yue Xiaoqian.

A bright light then appeared out of their bodies. When it clashed against the light of Yue Xiaoqian’s Devil Suppressing Seal, their light barrier began to burn. But it did manage to block the fatal effect of her holy light.

Clearly, they were prepared. This light that they had summoned could help them resist her for a while. But they had to kill her before this light was burned away.

All of a sudden, Long Chen slashed his saber at Yue Xiaoqian’s head. This action caused Mo Nian to jump in shock.

“Xiaoqian, dodge!”

Long Chen shouted, and without hesitation, Yue Xiaoqian dodged to the side.

The next moment, the void quivered and a dagger appeared in the air. This dagger’s target was originally Yue Xiaoqian, but it was perfectly blocked by Long Chen.

After this dagger appeared, Ji Wuming’s figure also manifested. He stared at Long Chen with some astonishment. It seemed that he was bewildered that Long Chen could block this attack.

BOOM!

Long Chen slammed his knee at Ji Wuming’s body, but strangely, this knee passed right through. Furthermore, Ji Wuming’s body slowly vanished like smoke, dissipating into heaven and earth.

“Spacetime laws!”

Mo Nian’s expression changed. The moment Long Chen’s knee was about to touch Ji Wuming’s body, it was like time grew slow. This wasn’t just a time law or a space law. It was the two merged together.

Mo Nian finally understood why Shi Yang and Yin Changsheng had shown such trepidation. Ji Wuming had dual Supreme Bones, one controlling time and the other controlling space. And now that these dual Supreme Bones were merging with his Supreme Blood, he could unleash both powers at once.

“Ji Wuming, scram! I don’t need your interference!” shouted the Nine Underworld Luocha.

At this moment, the Asura mark on her forehead began to burn, and her manifestation burst into appearance. A giant figure radiating divine light ignited her Blood Qi.

In that instant, her power soared by several times, and it was continuing to climb. Her aura also grew even more sinister. It was like some strange energy was awakening within her body.

Long Chen blocked three of the Nine Underworld Luocha’s attacks at once. After that, he retreated three steps. Her attacks grew stronger and stronger as if there was no limit.

Suddenly, Long Chen stepped back, avoiding the Nine Underworld Luocha and once more swinging the Minghong Saber at Yue Xiaoqian.

Once again, a dagger silently appeared and was blocked by Long Chen.

Ji Wuming had attacked Yue Xiaoqian twice, and it made Long Chen’s fury fully blaze.

However, unexpectedly, the void shook and the Nine Underworld Luocha’s sword also fell. As a result, blood splashed. Ji Wuming, who had just started to merge back into the void, had his cheek cut by the Nine Underworld Luocha’s sword.

“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Nine Underworld Luocha roared furiously. She actually abandoned Long Chen and shot after Ji Wuming.
