Chapter 3313 Darklight Heaven

Through this conversation with the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, Long Chen found that he truly knew very little.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The High Firmament Academy had so many ancient texts. But even Long Chen was not permitted to flip through the higher level ones. He didn’t know why the academy restricted them.

“You saw the nine star clusters. They are called the nine heavens, the nine great domains of the immortal world. This heaven that we live in is called the Darklight Heaven. All those stars that you saw are worlds with their own lifeforms on them. However, after that ancient battle, the nine heavens and ten lands were reduced to the hundred domains and thousand prefectures. Some lifeforms went extinct, and other stars turned into the lands of death. Afterward, some stars revived, and some lifeforms returned to their old homes to continue propagating. Thus, the current term of the hundred domains and thousand prefectures isn’t quite accurate. This time, the appearance of the Heavenly Flame Rainbow has caused a phenomenon that even people from other heavens can see. Some of their best heavenly geniuses will very likely travel across the heaven’s domains to reach here. Furthermore, the struggle for this flame is not limited to the human race. Thus, my greatest hope is that the human race can obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. But I have no confidence in whether or not this hope will become reality,” said the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

Long Chen suddenly thought of Xie Qianqian. It seemed that back in hell, Xie Qianqian had asked him which heaven he was from. At that time, he was completely dumbfounded. Based on this, she was born within one of the nine heavens and not some simple lower plane ascender.

Long Chen sighed inside. A single heaven was composed of millions of stars, as well as an ocean of stars around them. Also, every star had its own lifeforms. In that battle, all of that was destroyed, reduced to the hundred domains and thousand prefectures. Just how terrifying was that battle?

“Big sister, don’t worry. We will do our best to take it. We won’t let it fall into other people’s hands,” said Huo Linger confidently.

The current her was in the midst of absorbing the Devil Eye Water Lily’s fire lily seed, so her power was growing explosively. It was already more than ten times greater than before.

“It would be best if the two of you could obtain it. Even if you can’t, don’t let it fall into the hands of other races, especially those that come from the dark worlds. It absolutely cannot fall into their hands,” implored the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

“There are lifeforms from the dark worlds?” asked Long Chen.

“Behind the nine heavens are the dark worlds. They were the ones who incited that ancient battle, as well as the black hands that wish to topple this world. I can’t say too much about them. Once you reach that realm, you will naturally know who they are. I only told you all this as a warning, to tell you what kind of enemies you are about to face. You must be mentally prepared. Amongst all these people, you have the greatest potential. Perhaps you can break the bindings of fate and create an unexpected conclusion,” said the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

She had the ability to see the future, but she was unable to see Long Chen’s. Furthermore, she was unable to sense the tie of destiny between Long Chen and the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. That made her a bit disappointed.

Despite that, she still hoped for him to create a miracle and keep the Heavenly Rainbow Flame in the hands of the human race. If not, it would become a calamity. This time, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame born of fate was incredibly powerful.

“Senior, don’t worry. I will do my best,” said Long Chen.

Just from how serious the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was acting, Long Chen could tell that this particular Heavenly Rainbow Flame was definitely not ordinary. The implications were immense. That was why the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was willing to say so much to him.

Even without her warning, with Long Chen’s character, all treasures were his. Anyone who tried to touch them? They would be playing with their lives.

With a light sound, Long Chen placed his fresh flowers on the ground. All that had happened just now occurred in no more than the time it took for him to set down his flowers.

Bai Shishi hadn’t sensed anything off. It was like nothing had happened at all. The statue was still a statue, but the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was gone.

Long Chen then pulled Huo Linger over and bowed deeply toward the statue to express his thanks and respects to this senior.

After that, people sent Long Chen and the others off. Only once they were gone did those people sigh in relief as if relieved of a heavy burden.

Just now, they had confirmed that the Bloodkill Hall was destroyed, and there were burnt corpses littering that area. The corpses that could remain intact were at least Divine Lords. There was no way to count how many Four Peak disciples and below had been killed.

They even found the charred remains of three Immortal Kings, and Enpuda’s divine statue had its head cut off. The glorious Bloodkill Hall had been turned to ruins. People didn’t dare to believe their eyes.

When they confirmed this news, no one dared to question Long Chen’s words any longer. With this one thunderous move, Long Chen shook countless people.

Outside of the plaza, experts from the Heavenly Rainbow Domain arranged the best residence for Long Chen and the others. They even provided guards, attendants, carriages, etc.

Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The Heavenly Rainbow Domain was doing all this for him just in hopes that he would give them face and not start a fight in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

Clearly, these experts had investigated him and knew his temper. Perhaps even information from the Vile Dragon Domain had reached this place.

Long Chen was someone who didn’t even place a World King in his eyes. There was nothing that he didn’t dare do. Rules? They existed in name only to him.

The Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts felt a headache just from him being here. How did a living Yama King come to their home?

They all hoped that Long Chen would rest quietly in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain until the Heavenly Rainbow Flame appeared. Then he could go out and kill as much as he wanted. But inside the city, he would hopefully give them some face and not mess around.

Bai Shishi smiled and secretly whispered, “Being ruthless really is nice. Everything’s going smoothly.”

“No, my ruthlessness is all just an act. In truth, I’m a very pure, kindhearted person,” said Long Chen righteously.

“Only a ghost would believe you,” laughed Bai Shishi.

“No, I don’t believe it.”

Just then, a voice rang out in Long Chen and the others’ ears. As a result, their hair stood on end. Someone had snuck up on them without them being aware?

When they turned though, they didn’t see anyone. When their divine sense spread, they didn’t sense anyone. They instantly felt a cold breeze on the back of their necks.

Just now, that had clearly sensed a certain unforgettable aura. That aura was something that they would never be able to forget in this lifetime. It was the aura of the Ghost Ship.

“Ghost!”

Bai Xiaole was green with terror. “Did a ghost from the Ghost Ship follow us?!”
