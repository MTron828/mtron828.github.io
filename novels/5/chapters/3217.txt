Chapter 3206 Collecting Corpses

“We’re definitely going! Senior apprentice-sister’s matters are our matters as well. I, Bai Xiaole, am willing to fight at the very front for senior apprentice-sister!” declared Bai Xiaole immediately, afraid that Long Chen would refuse.

Bai Xiaole was still childish. The more people there were, the more he wanted to show off. That was especially true after the Nine Prefecture Convention. His primal bloodline had awakened along with many divine abilities of his Three Flower Pupils. If he still didn’t show off, wouldn’t all of that be a waste?

“You can go. I’ll hold the line,” said Long Chen, taking out a silver bow.

Long Chen had come to investigate his mother’s case, not to show off. This bow was a Treasure item of one of the Divine Lords he had killed.

In its original master’s hands, it had been left to the side. The master couldn’t even draw it. In the heavenly tribulation, he had blocked the heavenly tribulation with the bowstring, trying to reduce his wounds. However, Long Chen then spotted it and found that it was actually not an ordinary bow. After that, he told Lei Long to kill him and take that bow stealthily.

With that bow, he indicated that everyone could charge forward without needing to keep an eye on the rear. They could slaughter as many sea demons as they wished.

Qin Feng and Bai Xiaole instantly charged out. Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils appeared and space twisted, sending him, Qin Feng, and Xu Zixiong into the midst of the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls.

Xu Zixiong didn’t even understand what was happening when he found himself staring into the nose of one of the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls. He jumped in shock, and before he could react, a single snort from the Deep Sea Crocodile Bull sent him flying like a cannon. He flipped through the air and smashed into the ground.

At the same time, countless experts were flying past him. Those were the Ying Prefecture’s Divine Lords and Four Peak Primals. As they passed him, they glanced at him oddly.

Xu Zixiong was shocked and enraged. As soon as he came here, he was embarrassed. Just as he got up, a giant black figure shot toward him. He jumped and hastily dodged. As a result, fresh blood splashed through the air.

That was a giant head, the head of a Deep Sea Crocodile Bull. When Xu Zixiong looked, he saw Qin Feng flying past a headless corpse.

In the blink of an eye, Long Chen had taken the head of one of the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls, while he was embarrassing himself.

With a furious howl, he took out his rod and manifestation, charging forward.

Just then, another Deep Sea Crocodile Bull was slain by Qin Feng. Seeing this, the Ying Prefecture’s experts were shocked. The Deep Sea Crocodile bulls had tough hides, and even Treasure items had difficulty piercing their flesh. But Qin Feng killed them easily.

Long Chen nodded as he watched Qin Feng kill the sea demons. He was quite smart. Long Chen had imparted the first form of Split the Heavens to him and told him to think of his own way to have his dragon blood energy activate his acupuncture points. Now, this fellow had reached an initial level of skill in this technique.

Every blow of his saber now contained the power of his dragon blood. His sharp Saber Qi was not something that a physical body could block. Once he fully mastered the first form of Split the Heavens, his power would definitely be astonishing.

Although it definitely wouldn’t be as powerful as the Split the Heavens that was unleashed with the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art as a foundation, it definitely wouldn’t be inferior to any other Battle Skill of the immortal world. Just with an initial level of skill, Qin Feng was stunning everyone.

With every stroke of his saber, Qin Feng killed a Deep Sea Crocodile Bull. His attacks were incredibly sharp. As for Bai Xiaole, he was forming hand seals in the air and murmuring something.

Suddenly, ten of the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls stiffened. The mark of the Three Flower Pupils appeared in their eyes.

Those Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls roared and began biting their fellow Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“He awakened such a divine ability?” Long Chen was startled. Bai Xiaole had actually gained a soul-controlling pupil art.

This was different from a Beast Tamer’s slave mark. This technique was even more domineering. Let alone against these sea demons with their weak Spiritual Strength, it could even be used against humans, turning them into his puppets.

Another Deep Sea Crocodile Bull was slain by Qin Feng, causing Bai Xiaole to cry out painfully. He shouted, “Big brother Qin Feng, can you look at their eyes first before killing them?”

This soul-controlling pupil art was an extremely high level technique, and in order to properly control these sea demons, Bai Xiaole shared their senses. Hence, the sensation of them being slain was also transmitted to his body.

Due to this being his first time putting this technique into practice, his control wasn’t that great. If he had reacted faster, he could have retracted his control just as it was slain. But he still hadn’t reached that level yet.

“Sorry. Xiaole, you should have your puppets go kill further away from the main battlefield to prevent more mistakes,” shouted Qin Feng.

This couldn’t be blamed on Qin Feng. That particular Deep Sea Crocodile Bull had yet to fall completely under Bai Xiaole’s control. By the time that Qin Feng noticed, it was too late for him to stop.

Hearing that, Bai Xiaole felt that it was reasonable. He sat down on one of the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls, and over a hundred Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls charged toward the sea demons at the rear.

Seeing that Bai Xiaole had gained control of so many of them in such a short time, the others were stunned. His pupil arts were truly terrifying.

Furthermore, as time passed, his control grew even greater. He actually managed to gain control over an army of Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls.

However, when he reached three hundred of them, he found that he had touched his limit. Any more and his soul energy would be spread too far, and there would be danger of a backlash.

The sight of Qin Feng controlling three hundred Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls charging through the rest of the sea demon race had become a focal point. It was an even more stunning sight than Qin Feng.

Behind the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls were a group of comparatively weaker sea demons. It seemed that the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls were there to tear open a hole in their defenses so that the other sea demons could charge through.

Mountains of sea demons piled up, larger than city walls. With such a huge number, the sea demons could directly step over their comrades’ corpses and step over the walls.

The old corpses had yet to be cleaned up, and now a new batch came. Things grew dangerous. Some people began to gather the corpses, preventing them from piling on top of the walls.

Seeing that his opportunity had come, Long Chen shouted, “You can focus on the battle. Leave the corpses to me.”

Long Chen extended his hand. Thunderforce spread in a net, and all the corpses within his range instantly vanished.
