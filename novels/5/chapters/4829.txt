Chapter 4818 Primal Chaos Fragment

“Let me devour it!” Evilmoon suddenly cried out. Black chains then shot out of Evilmoon and bound the jade.

The jade trembled violently, emanating immense power that sent chills down Long Chen's spine. If this jade exploded, everyone, including him, would be blasted to bits.

Xia Chen identified it—it was the energy source of the barrier. This jade possessed the power to seal the cultivation bases of Heaven Saints, suppressing them to the Divine Venerate realm.

Previously, Xia Chen had managed to connect with it, but he was rejected. Thanks to their enemies scattering, he finally had a chance to calmly communicate with it.

At first, everything was going smoothly. But for some reason, once he picked it up, it instantly turned hostile.

Evilmoon’s power was binding the jade, but it was still cracking. It seemed that there was no stopping it.

“What’s going on? I can’t devour it!” Evilmoon was shocked. There was actually something in this world that it couldn’t devour?

“That is a primal chaos fragment. With your power, you can’t absorb it.” At this moment, the Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out.

“Then can you do it?” asked Evilmoon.

“I can try.”

“Tch, if you want to, just say it directly. You’re annoying. Here.” Evilmoon irritably retracted its black chains.

The Earth Cauldron then appeared above the jade. Curiously, the Earth Cauldron didn’t seem to be using any power, but its light instantly calmed the jade calm, which obediently entered the Earth Cauldron.

Both Long Chen and Evilmoon were stunned. Evilmoon suddenly cursed, “You old cauldron, you’re absolutely sly! You definitely knew a way to subdue it but refused to tell me!”

“The main thing is that you didn’t ask,” said the Earth Cauldron lightly.

“You... Fine. You’re a sinister old cauldron.” Evilmoon didn’t even know what to say to vent its anger, so it directly vanished.

Long Chen was speechless. He hadn’t expected the dignified Earth Cauldron to also have a sly side. It seemed that there was some trick to subduing this jade, but only the Earth Cauldron knew of it.

However, for the Earth Cauldron to care so much about it, it seemed that this jade was beyond ordinary. It had to be immensely useful for both the Earth Cauldron and Evilmoon.

“Senior, what is this thing?” asked Long Chen.

“To put it simply, it is a fragment of primal chaos, representing the laws of primal chaos. However, it is incomplete. If you want more detail, it can be considered the cloth from when primal chaos first formed, surrounding... Well, the details don’t matter. In any case, this is something important to both me and Evilmoon, especially at this time. However, due to Evilmoon’s energy, even if it knew this secret art, it would be unable to subdue it,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen nodded. It seemed that he had found a treasure this time. The Earth Cauldron’s power would definitely rise after absorbing this jade.

“Long Chen, do you trust me?” asked the Earth Cauldron suddenly.

Long Chen was startled. “Senior, why would you suddenly ask such a thing?”

The Earth Cauldron replied, “Your heart-devil, I haven’t told you much about it. Are you not angry?”

Long Chen couldn’t help being speechless. “Do I look like someone who likes to get angry? I know you have your reasons for not telling me. You’ve helped me out countless times, so I’m not going to resent you when you don’t. In my heart, you are just like my brothers. I can leave my life to them and you.”

Long Chen had asked the Earth Cauldron about his heart-devil multiple times, but it always remained silent on the topic. Theoretically, since it had formally accepted Long Chen as master, it couldn’t betray his will. However, it still did.

The Earth Cauldron was silent for a long time before saying, “Thank you for your trust. I will absorb half the primal chaos fragment’s energy and then refine it into a treasure for you. You will definitely be delighted by it.”

The Earth Cauldron sounded very moved and gratified. It seemed that Long Chen’s trust gave it a sense of warmth that it hadn’t felt before.

“One that I will be delighted by. You don’t mean...”

“That’s right. However, it will be a one-time use item, and it can only remain active for a very short time,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“That’s good enough. Even if it’s just for a breath, I can kill several Heaven Saints before they can take the second breath!” Long Chen cried out excitedly. He could already guess what kind of treasure the Earth Cauldron was going to make for him.

This primal chaos fragment possessed the mysterious power to seal a Heaven Saint’s cultivation base. If the Earth Cauldron refined it, its effect would definitely be similar to it.

“You’re underestimating me. It will be able to stay active for the span of an incense stick burning,” replied the Earth Cauldron with a hint of pride.

“That’s amazing! Many thanks, senior!” Long Chen was delighted. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

With such an item, what would he have to fear? Even against Heaven Saints, he could be fearless.

“However, it will take some time. Before it’s done, you should reserve yourself a bit,” warned the Earth Cauldron.

“Don’t worry about it. Just do what you have to do,” said Long Chen hastily. The Earth Cauldron then returned to his mind-sea to start refining the primal chaos fragment.

Suddenly, a streak of sword-light sliced through the dome of the heavens like cloth, and a spatial gate appeared. When Long Chen saw Bai Letian and the others appear from it, he smiled.

“I didn’t let you down.”

Bai Letian and the others looked around. Seeing the mountains that were now full of life, they were extremely moved.

“Dean Long Chen, it’s been hard on you.”

Long Chen said some courteous words and asked about the situation on their side. When he learned that they only killed a few of those Heaven Saints, he couldn’t help being a bit disappointed. Unfortunately, the Brahma Divine Diagram had appeared all too quickly.

Bai Letian used the High Firmament Divine Sword to activate the formation. When its light filled this space, the vegetation on the mountains started to rapidly grow, and the land instantly became green and flourishing.

In just half a day, the surroundings had completely transformed. The sinister devil qi was gone. Without personally witnessing it, it was hard to believe what kind of transformation this place had just undergone.

After claiming this land, the High Firmament Divine Sword finally had a place to put down its roots. The High Firmament Academy’s karmic luck slowly sank into the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Unless the Brahma Divine Diagram’s true body descended, no one would be able to threaten the High Firmament Academy’s base here. They had found a stable place to rest.

Finally, Long Chen and the others could peacefully cultivate. However, Long Chen had only been in seclusion for three days when an urgent message reached him. Someone was looking for him.

When Long Chen saw who it was, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.
