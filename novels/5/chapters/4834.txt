Chapter 4823 Devil Fall City

“You graverobbing bastard, I’ll cut off your dog head today!”

An exceptionally tall and muscular bald man roared the moment he saw Mo Nian. Despite looking human, he possessed intense flame fluctuations, and his Blood Qi fluctuations were also different. Long Chen deduced that he was not human.

The way this bald man gazed at Mo Nian was filled with deep-seated animosity, as though Mo Nian were the one killing his father. With a battle-ax in his hand, his Doyen power erupted, showing that he was a powerful nine star Heavenly Doyen.

He immediately attacked with his full power, clearly hating Mo Nian to the bone. However, he also knew how powerful Mo Nian was, so he was vigilant.

“Tch, with your power, you aren’t qualified to fight me. If I use a single finger, it’ll count as my defeat,” sneered Mo Nian as he clasped his hands behind him, showing no intention of blocking the attack.

“Hmph, you are really skilled.” Long Chen admitted that he couldn’t match Mo Nian in this regard. Despite being in the midst of recovery and lacking the energy for combat, Mo Nian found a way to plead for assistance while making it sound so arrogant.

Dragon scales materialized on Long Chen’s hand as he grasped the battle-ax with one hand. Waves of qi surged around him, yet Long Chen stood firm like a boulder, enduring the bald man's powerful onslaught.

“You!”

The bald man's Blood Qi churned within him when Long Chen abruptly halted his weapon. Before he could respond, a sensation of sweetness rose in his throat. Almost coughing up blood, he quickly clamped his mouth shut.

“You can get going. Provoking him won't end well for you,” Long Chen remarked casually.

“He blasphemed my ancestors! I cannot exist beneath the same heavens as him! If you’re with him, you can die together!” The bald man suddenly opened his mouth, shooting out a blood arrow.

This blood arrow was not aimed at Long Chen or Mo Nian. When it hit the battle-ax, Long Chen’s expression instantly sank, and blood-colored divine light appeared on his hand.

BOOM!

The bald man had chosen to detonate the battle-ax and himself, sacrificing his own life and weapon to drag Long Chen and Mo Nian down with him.

Long Chen’s hand still hung in the air. Blood mist and weapon fragments lay scattered around him, but he wasn’t harmed in the slightest. However, his expression was extremely dark.

“Mercy only brings humiliation. You wanted to spare his life, but he wanted to drag you down with him. I, Mo Nian, might not be a good person, but I have my own bottom line. The graves that I rob are all specifically picked out,” said Mo Nian.

Mo Nian’s meaning was clear. Although he often robbed graves, he would always figure out the background behind the grave’s master first. To put it frankly, if he chose to rob someone’s grave, they definitely weren’t a good person. When Long Chen showed mercy to that person, in truth, it was a show of mistrust in Mo Nian.

If Long Chen truly trusted Mo Nian, he wouldn't have shown any mercy. Consequently, this action left Mo Nian deeply displeased and hurt.

“I’m sorry, brother,” apologized Long Chen sincerely.

“It’s fine. I’m not so petty. Well, the influence of your heart-devil can’t be erased in just a day or two. Take it slowly.” Mo Nian patted Long Chen’s shoulder.

Mo Nian knew that Long Chen’s condition was not that good. The prolonged influence of his heart-devil had taken its toll, so even with his realization, he needed some time to rectify himself. There was no rushing this matter.

“To encounter your enemies before even entering the city, you really haven’t been slacking during this period,” remarked Long Chen.

“When someone is hardworking, others naturally start to envy them. There’s no way around it. The heavens always reward the diligent,” Mo Nian replied with a shrug, sounding helpless yet proud in his gaze.

The two of them entered the worn-down city. There wasn’t even a grand formation here, only a few broken-down transportation formations.

There was no order in this city, nor was there any fee required for entry. Mo Nian explained that this was a lawless city due to occasional devil creature attacks, so no one was willing to set up camp here.

This place served only as a transportation node. When they arrived at a transportation formation, the guard demanded two hundred top-grade primal chaos spirit stones per person. Long Chen was taken aback by the steep price.

Top-grade primal chaos spirit stones were extremely precious, even in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Spending such a sum for transportation seemed exorbitant, not different from robbery.

However, Mo Nian took it in stride and casually paid the fee. After that, Long Chen and Mo Nian stepped onto the transportation formation. There were already two men and one woman waiting inside.

The three of them glanced at Mo Nian and Long Chen as they walked in, and they took a step back each to maintain a certain distance from each other. Clearly, the three of them were not friends.

Mo Nian explained to Long Chen that many places in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven were half wilderness. Most of the people who went there were adventurers, the kind that risked their lives, and they needed to make a profit for their cultivation expenditures.

This transportation node required a huge capital to set up. Normally, it took decades or even centuries to get back the capital that was invested into it. After that, it would only break even, and if the owner wanted to profit, they had to protect the transportation formation from the attacks of devil creatures. Thus, the price of each transportation was high, but still reasonable.

To put it frankly, both the adventurers who frequented this area and those managing the transportation formation were taking significant risks. Thus, everyone respected the rules. If someone really had no money or had some urgent affair they needed to get to, a credit line could be set up for them.

After a two-day wait, more than ten individuals gathered inside the transportation formation, prompting its activation. When it was done, Long Chen and the others found themselves atop a desolate mountaintop.

They were surrounded by a wasteland. Spiritual qi was scarce, and spatial fluctuations were erratic, reflecting the unstable laws of the Heavenly Daos in this region.

This place was not Mo Nian’s target. In the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, many areas were dominated by devil creatures, and most were uncrossable forbidden territories. Hence, when someone had to travel, they had to go around, which required multiple transportations.

Most of these transportation nodes were strategically positioned in areas avoided by devil creatures. Locations shunned by devil creatures tended to be inhospitable to humans as well. However, despite the harsh conditions, these sites were safer.

After this transportation, Long Chen and Mo Nian went to the next transportation node. Fortunately, Mo Nian needed to heal, so they were in no rush. On the way, Long Chen asked Mo Nian about the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

After multiple transportations, Long Chen found that the cities they were passing by gradually grew larger and more luxurious.

When the final transportation formation lit up, Long Chen saw an enormous city that reached high into the clouds. Even with all his experience, he was stunned by what he saw. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Mo Nian also stared in amazement at this unimaginably huge city. Although it wasn’t his first time here, every time he saw it, he was amazed.

“This is one of the three largest human cities inside of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, Devil Fall City.”
