Chapter 4907: Hand It Over!

Long Chen descended like a god, instantly kicking Huo Qianwu away. He was incredibly fast, and his kick contained no killing intent or even intent to harm. As it posed no threat to Huo Qianwu, she didn’t sense it at all.

Huo Qianwu tumbled through the air. When he heard Long Chen’s voice, the flames around her suddenly exploded.

“You goddamn bastard!” Huo Qianwu gnashed her teeth, stabilizing herself as quickly as possible. When she saw Long Chen, flames burst out of her eyes.

Mo Nian was overjoyed to see Long Chen here. Taking advantage of this opening, he slammed a talisman to the chain in his hand, and the cracks on his chain immediately healed.

“Wow, you want her to take off her clothes as soon as you see her? And you’re not hiding your bad intentions in front of me? You really are a loyal brother.” Mo Nian didn’t forget to taunt Huo Qianwu even now.

“Leave Huo Qianwu to me. Can you deal with that fellow?” asked Long Chen.

With a hint of disdain, Mo Nian replied, “Just him? If it weren’t for this devil corpse, I wouldn’t even need to move my hand to deal with him.”

“Then what would you move?” inquired Long Chen casually.

“I’d take off my pants and poke him to death,” answered Mo Nian confidently.

“Damn humans, die!” Fuming at being insulted, the devil expert thrust his serpentine spear through the air.

“Hey, Huo girl, that fellow just cursed you!” shouted Long Chen.

Huo Qianwu ignored Long Chen’s instigation, her face icy cold. She was muttering to herself as if chanting something, but no one knew what she was saying.

However, when Long Chen read her lips, he jumped. Countless chains then descended from the nine heavens like a cage around him.

“It’s the Nirvana Scripture! What a sinister woman!” Long Chen was startled. Although he had known that Huo Qianwu would definitely cultivate the Nirvana Scripture as a heavenly genius of the Flame Divine Hall, he had never thought she would be able to use a secret art to chant it. It was extremely deceiving and puzzling.

By the time he reacted, a giant cage had descended from the heavens, its terrifying pressure actually eclipsing the fluctuations from the devil corpse.

“Is she going all out already?” Mo Nian muttered as he used his golden bone shield to block the devil expert’s attack. He stared in shock at Huo Qianwu, who was now unleashing a terrifying move unlike any she had used before.

It was fortunate that she hadn’t used such a move on him when he was alone. Otherwise, he would have had to give up on the devil corpse in order to defend himself.

“Blood ignition!” Long Chen shouted, summoning his Dragon Blood Battle Armor. Huo Qianwu's attack was still in its initial state, and he knew he could escape its lock by moving out of the bounds of the cage. However, Long Chen wasn’t in the habit of running.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A dragon’s cry rang out as blood-colored flames soared around him. Evilmoon swung through the air repeatedly, its power growing with every stroke. The seven slashes of his saber were completed in an instant. At that moment, the cage crashed down, and Huo Qianwu’s furious cry echoed above the rumbling of the ten thousand Daos.

“Brahma Devil Prison!”

Millions of chains crashed down like the harbingers of the apocalypse. This was Huo Qianwu’s strongest attack. During her previous fight with Long Chen, she had thought she would easily crush him, and so she hadn’t unleashed her trump cards, believing that he wasn’t worthy.

However, as the battle progressed and she realized Long Chen’s power far exceeded her expectations, she no longer had the opportunity to use this move. Now, she used it to catch him off guard. Her defeat last time was her life’s greatest disgrace, and she resented it deeply. Convinced that her loss was simply due to underestimating Long Chen, she refused to accept her defeat.

This time, she immediately started off with her strongest move, as she wanted to crush him with brute power.

“Brahma Devil Prison? Fool, you’re using the wrong move. I’m not a devil. It should be a dragon prison at least.”

Long Chen still had the time to sneer at her, but his expression grew serious. His smile was replaced with a murderous air.

“Split the Heavens—Seven Forms in One!” Long Chen’s roar contained a dragon cry that resembled a heavenly god’s roar.

This was Long Chen’s strongest attack. Normally, Long Chen wouldn’t immediately unleash all seven forms right at the start, but he also wanted to know just how strong his attack would be in his peak state.

The cage descended like a heavenly net constricting a little ant. Unexpectedly, Long Chen’s heaven-defying saber image slashed down, slicing apart the very world. Not even gods could stop it, nor could the heavens. This attack represented an unbending defiance.

BOOM!

The collision shook heaven and earth, causing berserk power to erupt and even sending the enormous corpse staggering to the side. Flames raged, and astral winds tore through space. Cracks spread throughout the world, making it seem like the world would shatter at any moment.

Above the nine heavens, the cage was trying to descend, but a saber-image stabbed the top of it. These two powers were still competing.

BOOM!

In the end, the cage exploded as the saber-image tore through the chains. The saber-image was actually one level stronger than the cage, slicing through the very shackles of the heavens.

“Impossible! Brahma Arts are blessed by Divine Venerate Brahma! The Brahma God race is the greatest line of gods in this world! He is the heavens, and the heavens are him! No one can break his techniques!” exclaimed Huo Qianwu. She was dumbstruck, unable to believe what she was seeing.

She couldn’t believe this. Ever since she had learned this technique, no one had ever been able to break it. This technique could not be broken. It could be dodged, fought against, or drained of energy, but breaking it required the other side’s realm to be far above hers. However, even Heaven Saints were not qualified to do that.

In any case, because this was a technique backed by the Nirvana Scripture and blessed by Lord Brahma, it represented the heavens.

“How coincidental. It just so happens that my technique is called Split the Heavens.”

Long Chen swung Evilmoon through the air as he endured the waves of dizziness assaulting him. Resting Evilmoon on his shoulder, he gazed at the astonished Huo Qianwu, enjoying her stunned expression.

“Evilmoon, did you do that? How did all my dragon blood energy get exhausted in one attack?” asked Long Chen.

“What are you talking about? You said it yourself, this move is called Split the Heavens, and that technique represents the heavens. It was most likely an instinctual reaction from your technique,” replied Evilmoon.

Long Chen found Evilmoon’s argument to be reasonable. However, his dragon blood energy was now severely depleted. He was barely able to keep the Dragon Blood Battle Armor active, but he had to keep acting.

“Don’t be too pleased! Let’s see how you can handle this!” Huo Qianwu shouted as she recovered from her shock. She raised the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, which instantly stiffened. Countless flame runes lit up along its length, and a wild aura rapidly rose.

Just as Huo Qianwu fully activated the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, a large hand caught it.

“Hand it over!”
