Chapter 3600

“The great dean himself has said that the battle plan will be left to dean Guo Ran. We just need to listen to orders, and we’ll do whatever dean Guo Ran tells us to do. There’s no need for our opinion,” said Leng Hui.

Long Chen had killed Wang Zixu, and the dean had taken that chance to strike while the iron was hot, eliminating the spies within the college. They were no fools. They could see that the dean was planning on raising Guo Ran as his successor. Guo Ran would be the dean in the future, and the current dean had prepared the path for him.

The current Guo Ran was truly soaring like a shooting star. Anyone who went against him now would be an idiot. Thus, the two of them could only lower their heads.

“I only listen to my boss. Planning? I can’t be bothered. I’m just in charge of leading the battle!” Guo Ran shook his head and pushed the responsibility onto Long Chen, following things just like he had in the Dragonblood Legion.

“Then we’ll listen to senior apprentice-brother Long Chen,” said Leng Hui nonchalantly.

Surprisingly enough, Long Chen shook his head. “Since everyone has buried the hatchet, we will be comrade-in-arms in the future. Let us speak truthfully. Guo Ran is only a temporary proxy dean. If nothing unexpected happens, the future dean will be chosen amongst the two of you. Thus, while this battle appears to be something that the dean prepared for Guo Ran, in truth, it is for you two. The ones to profit the most will be you two.”

“What?!”

Xie Liuer and Leng Hui jumped in shock. “You mean that you’re going to leave? Can it be that not even the position of dean can hold you back?”

“How funny. Can a little college bind me, Guo Ran? That must be a joke. I am the general of the Dragonblood Legion! Even if I tell you now, you won’t understand. Let me put it to you this way: when the Dragonblood Legion gathers once more, when we fight throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, you will understand what real glory is. Do your best to suck up to me now because once my boss overlooks the heavens, I, Guo Ran, will also rise! I’m not going to be someone that anyone can suck up to then!” exclaimed Guo Ran proudly.

Xie Liuer and Leng Hui both had expressions of disbelief. The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was a famous and glorious existence. Just how much reverence did the dean of such an existence possess? But Guo Ran actually didn’t want that title.

“Getting back to the point, Guo Ran’s position is temporary. If the two of you can do a good job and stand out above the masses in this battle, then unless someone even more outstanding appears in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, the position of dean will fall to the two of you. Thus, you cannot just listen to orders. You have to make yourselves the main characters, make yourselves stand out. Most importantly, you have to look after everyone properly. Don’t just stand in the shade of a big tree. Otherwise, once this tree leaves, if you haven’t made any contributions at all, how will you win over everyone?” said Long Chen.

“Understood. Many thanks for your pointers, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!” said Leng Hui gratefully.

The reason why they had constantly suppressed Guo Ran as best as they could was precisely for the future position of dean.

Hence, now that Guo Ran had expressed that he had no interest in that position, and Long Chen had even reminded them to take advantage to stand out and make a name for themselves, they were completely won over.

When the two of them submitted to Guo Ran, that was because they had no choice. But with this, they were completely revitalized. They immediately followed Long Chen’s instructions and went to organize their own people, preparing for battles.

Seeing them leave so excitedly, Guo Ran chortled, “Boss really is the boss. Now you’ll direct me, and I’ll direct them. I just need to move my lips and nothing else. Hehe, I really like this feeling. The two of them have to listen to me, hahaha! I’m getting excited just by thinking about it. You know, I feel like if I were to use this opportunity to express myself to that girl Xie Liuer, she really might agree. Maybe I should try it?”

Guo Ran’s wretched smile at this time definitely required a beating.

Long Chen rolled his eyes at him. This little fellow only dared to talk and brag, but he didn’t dare to try anything.

However, now Guo Ran would be able to order them around, and the two of them wouldn’t dare to hesitate in the slightest. It could count as allowing him to vent.

“Guo Ran, tell me the truth. What do you think about the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College?” asked Long Chen solemnly.

Guo Ran sank into thought. “If it was before, I would say that the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was rotten to the bone and could not be cured. But now that I’ve witnessed the dean’s methods, I realize that what I saw was not the complete Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. The college still has a great deal of power in reserve. Everything is under the dean’s control, and it has immense potential. What is it boss? Are you interested in raising this college?” Having followed Long Chen the longest, Guo Ran had a certain understanding of how Long Chen thought.

“Alright then. Since that’s the case, I’ll put in some effort to raise them.” Long Chen thought about it and made his decision.

…

“What? Cultivate a different cultivation technique? That is unacceptable!” Within the assembly hall, there were hundreds of elders. When Guo Ran proclaimed the addition of a new cultivation technique to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, the entire assembly erupted in an uproar.

Of the assembly’s twelve Elders, three were executed and six were imprisoned. So, only three were participating now. Since that was the case, Guo Ran had to gather all the elders of the college to announce this.

As a result, this announcement caused almost everyone to shoot up and oppose it. One elder said, “Dean Guo Ran, this cannot be done. I know you have good intentions, but how can the rules created during the founding of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College and passed down for tens of millions of years be changed just like that?”

“Exactly! If something happens, the college will decline. The rules that our ancestors passed down cannot be broken.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

All those elders panicked when they heard Guo Ran’s announcement. They could not accept such a reality.

“I called you over to announce this matter, not to discuss it with you. All you need to do is carry out my orders. This is war. Anyone who goes against my orders will be executed. If my orders cause harm to the college, then I, Guo Ran, will kill myself to atone for my sins. But if someone goes against my orders, then don’t blame me for not being courteous and not caring about seniority. Alright, all of you can disperse.” After saying that, Guo Ran turned and left.

The next day, Guo Ran’s group of hundreds of followers were gathered by him. Amongst them were Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others.

They were all incomparably excited. That was because Guo Ran had told them that Long Chen would be teaching them a new cultivation technique, one that could shake heaven and earth. Hence, all of them were filled with anticipation.

It had to be known that the reputation of Guo Ran’s boss had long since shaken their ears. Long Chen had only been in the college for a few days, but Guo Ran had undergone such an amazing transformation. In their eyes, Long Chen seemed to be an omnipotent existence.

“I will pass down the Starry River of the Sky Art to you. Starting today, you will be the strongest starry river warriors of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.”

Looking at those expectant gazes, Long Chen smiled. If the Starry River of the Sky Art was combined with the Starry River Battle Armor, just what kind of glorious light would it produce?
