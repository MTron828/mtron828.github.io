Chapter 3419 Towering Killing Intent

“Haha… haha… hahaha!”

The nine star heir raised his head and laughed. Although he was powerless, his voice had not lost its domineering nature.

“Execution? The likes of you think you’re fit to execute a nine star heir? How satirically laughable,” he sneered.

“Hmph, you’ve killed countless lifeforms. It is only by committing countless wicked acts that you have your power. Do you not feel the slightest bit of guilt?” shouted the hall master.

He continued blaspheming nine star heirs. Seeing this, Long Chen was clenching his fists again. This was a huge insult to him.

He could see that the Sacred Pill Hall was planning on using this chance to turn the nine star heirs into the enemies of the demonic beast race.

The hall master was exceptionally shameless. He even infused pure Spiritual Strength in his words, which could easily draw out emotions from other people and affect their wills.

Let alone these Four Peak demonic beasts, even demonic beasts that had reached the World King realm could easily be swayed by him.

Alchemists innately possessed powerful Spiritual Strength, while demonic beasts had weak Spiritual Strength. Adding on their simple heads, it was all too easy for them to fall for it.

Now Long Chen knew that the Sacred Pill Hall had built a stronghold here precisely to plant the seed of hatred. Their goal was to turn the demonic beast race against the nine star heirs. 

Demonic beasts were spread throughout the entire immortal world, and they had many branches. By using this one stronghold, the Sacred Pill Hall would plant the seed of hatred and then use various means to make it grow, cultivating it until the entire demonic beast race was opposed to nine star heirs.

In other words, this Divine Lord Immortal Realm was nothing more than bait. In fact, it hadn’t even been attractive enough before, so the Sacred Pill Hall had spent a huge sum to include the star-field’s core in it as well, all just to create a holy land.

They were using this peak grade holy land as bait, and their goal was clearly the heavenly geniuses of the Lightning Falcon, Water Mallard, Mammoth Divine Elephant, and other powerful races. They were the future pillars of their races.

Planting this seed was only the start according to Long Chen’s prediction. They definitely had a much bigger plan set up. But he was still unaware of what exactly it was.

“Do you know how many innocent lifeforms were used to build your body of flesh? Did you ever think about the fathers, mothers, partners, and children of the demonic beasts that you killed? In your dreams, did you ever see the resentful spirits of the demonic beasts whose lives you claimed…” The hall master continued droning on righteously. At the same time, Long Chen felt his blood raging within him.

This old bastard was too shameless. Most importantly, his voice contained a bewitching power that was starting to inflame these demonic beasts. Their own anger was being drawn out, and they were tricked just like that.

Even Lei Yuner had her lightning runes appear in her eyes. She was also affected.

“Endure. You must endure. You know that our fatal weakness is not knowing how to endure.”

The nine star heir ignored the hall master’s sanctimonious droning, instead focusing on Long Chen. 

“I’m about to die. But I’m very happy. You let me see the flame of hope. Grow this flame day by day until it illuminates the nine heavens and ten lands. I do regret dying before I get to see just how powerful you will be with the seventh star. You are…”

Suddenly, his voice was cut off as a golden spear pierced his chest.

Long Chen saw the wielder of the golden spear. It was that detestable eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. He had actually charged onto the stage and stabbed the nine star heir.

“You damned human race, do you know what kind of end you’ll get for offending the great demonic beast race?!” roared the eighth prince hatefully.

The nine star heir slowly raised his head and looked at the eighth prince. He sneered indifferently, “Foolish fellow, I don’t know what my end will be, but I know yours will be a thousand times more miserable than mine.”

“Die!”

The eighth prince roared furiously. His spear then quivered, blasting the nine star heir’s body apart.

Long Chen clenched his fists so hard that they creaked, and his fingernails dug into his skin. The sharp pain tried to draw his attention away from his rage, but it failed.

At that moment, his soul quivered and black light flashed in his eyes. But it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Within his peak anger and sorrow, he didn’t notice the change in himself.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Long Chen crazily suppressed his rage, doing his best to appear calm. The death of this nine star heir was his own choice. He wanted to die with dignity.

However, Long Chen could not forgive the Sacred Pill Hall or the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince. He was simply waiting until he underwent his tribulation at the core of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. Once he reached the Divine Lord realm, he would get revenge for this iron-boned nine star heir.

“Excellent. Warriors of the demonic beast race, the demonic beast race needs warriors like you in order to stop the nine star heirs’ unrestrained slaughter,” praised the hall master.

The eighth prince suddenly raised his head and howled after receiving the hall master’s praise. It was like he was a lion that had defeated his opponent, showing off his bravery to everyone.

“This bastard, how can killing someone without the ability to resist count as something? If he had guts, he would have fought him for real,” said Lei Yuner hatefully.

This one roar from the eighth prince seemed to have awakened Lei Yuner from the hall master’s hypnosis. It also stimulated her hatred for him.

“If I kill him, will that implicate your Lightning Falcon race?” asked Long Chen.

“That’s impossible!” Lei Yuner was startled. “Even if we join forces, while we might be able to fight him, beating him would be as difficult as ascending the heavens, and that’s not even talking about killing him. He has the Elephant Emperor War Chariot. That’s the priceless treasure of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, one that possesses the power to destroy heaven and earth. We can’t stop it.”

Seeing Long Chen suddenly become serious, for some reason, Lei Yuner’s heart was pounding worriedly. She actually felt an indescribable fear welling up inside of her. The current Long Chen was frightening.

After the eighth prince was done roaring, the hall master suddenly sent him a message. “Once you enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, kill that black-robed human. I keep feeling like he’s a disaster in the making.”

“Yes.”

The eighth prince nodded. The two of them communicated naturally as if everything had been arranged.

“The evildoer has been slain! Now, the Divine Lord Immortal Realm will be opened!”

The hall master shouted. After that, the entire plaza lit up, and everyone was instantly sucked into the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.

Inside the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, Long Chen ignored the spiritual qi that had been concentrated to the peak. Instead, he stared at the expert of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race not far from him.

Long Chen looked at him, and he looked at Long Chen. The two of them then shouted at the same time, charging at the other.
