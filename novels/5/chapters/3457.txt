Chapter 3446 Divine Object of the Primal Chaos Era

The sound of a broom sweeping lightly across the ground rang out, along with the crinkling of some leaves being swept. No matter how great the vitality of a tree, no matter how long it could live without changing, its leaves would still be constantly replaced.

If more leaves were growing, then more leaves had to fall. It was a cycle that went around and around. Perhaps this was also another kind of interpretation of life.

The sound of the devils and screams of slaughter were loud, but the sweeping elder didn’t seem to hear them. He was focused entirely on sweeping. It seemed that even if the heavens were to collapse, it wouldn’t hinder his sweeping.

“Senior…”

Bai Letian arrived and bowed respectfully to the sweeping elder.

“What is it? What problem have you encountered?” The elder still had his head down as he continued sweeping. He spoke very casually.

“Long Chen has returned. He concealed what he had experienced,” said Bai Letian somewhat solemnly.

“And then?” asked the sweeping elder.

“The High Firmament Divine Sword sensed an aura on Long Chen that made it uneasy,” said Bai Letian.

“Oh?”

The sweeping elder was finally moved. He stopped sweeping, a trace of astonishment appearing in his turbid eyes.

“Something that could make the High Firmament Divine Sword uneasy? Most likely, only those divine objects from the primal chaos era could cause such a thing. Did the High Firmament Divine Sword say where this uneasy aura came from?”

“No. It wasn’t on Long Chen, but Long Chen has been stained by its aura. The High Firmament Divine Sword is unable to tell what exactly it is. Now that Long Chen is getting stronger and stronger, I am worried…”

“You are worried that Long Chen is a double-sided sword? He has powerful enemies outside and a heart-devil inside. You fear he will walk down the evil path?” asked the sweeping elder.

Bai Letian nodded. This time, Long Chen’s aura was completely different from before. He seemed like a sealed devil lord slowly breaking free from his seal bit by bit, revealing a sharp and dangerous light.

“Don’t be so afraid. Long Chen is a nine star heir, and he is also different from other nine star heirs. He is a Divergent, he is a Heaven-Defier, he is a gamebreaker. If he becomes an immortal, good; if he becomes a devil, fine. This deadlock of the nine heavens and ten lands requires someone with extraordinary means to break free. Who cares what method he uses? If you use someone, do not doubt them; if you doubt someone, then don’t use them. Ah, your guts are shrinking more and more. This is no good. When Zhantang becomes a World King, you should abdicate your position to him.” The elder shook his head, and he once more started sweeping.

“Senior, how can that be? That little fellow is far too hot-headed!” Bai Letian jumped in shock. He understood his son well. When his head got hot, he didn’t care about anything else. How could Bai Letian possibly entrust the academy to him?

“Haha, it’s just a joke. Don’t take it seriously,” laughed the sweeping elder.

Bai Letian rolled his eyes. After knowing this sweeping elder for so many years, he had never been so casual. So, for him to suddenly make a joke, Bai Letian was caught off-guard.

“Do you know? When I chatted with Long Chen before this, he said something that moved me greatly.” The elder suddenly paused and sat on the ground.

Bai Letian also quickly sat and asked, “What did he say?”

The sweeping elder shook his head. “These weren’t his words but the words that his adoptive father told him. Pigs run forward, chicks run back. Birds don’t even pee. Thus, every person has their own Dao.”

“Uh…?” Bai Letian was left dumbfounded. He had expected something profound. But the sweeping elder’s serious expression didn’t seem to be that of someone joking around.

The elder smiled. “In truth, many profound principles are contained within somewhat vulgar words. The lives of mortals are over in a flash. A person may not even live to a hundred, but the principles they comprehend during this time are quite shocking if you carefully examine them. On the surface, every single day, cultivators are comprehending the Heavenly Daos, grasping the profundities of the world, cultivating magical arts, training divine abilities, extending their lifespans, and flying through the air. In the eyes of mortals, we are omniscient, omnipotent. But in reality? Just how much of the Heavenly Daos can we truly comprehend?”

“Well…”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Bai Letian couldn’t reply. Even after cultivating to his realm, he wasn’t able to give a precise definition of the Heavenly Daos. Furthermore, his cultivation was done by standing on the shoulders of those who had come before him. His cultivation path was cleared by his predecessors, and this was true for all of them. They could just close their eyes and walk down this set path.

“Thus, no matter what lifeform it is, they have their own special means to live. It can be considered the path that the Heavenly Daos gave them. This is true of every person, but Long Chen has his own Dao. His Dao is unique, and his path is one that defies the heavens, changing his fate. For him to come to our High Firmament Academy, there are some things that are set by fate. You don’t need to think about how to help him, nor should you treat him like a child, requiring him to get your consent for every little matter. Give him his freedom.”

“Yes.”

Bai Letian respectfully bowed his head. Seeing the elder pick up his broom, he left.

Just after Bai Letian left, the image of a sword silently appeared in front of the elder.

The elder looked at that sword-image. “Do not tell Letian about these kinds of things. That is the aura of a divine item from the primal chaos era. If Letian learns too much, it will infect him with karma. If his life isn’t tough enough, he will lose it.”

The sword-image quivered slightly, as if nodding.

The elder stared at the sword-image. The two of them seemed to be communicating. After a moment, the elder narrowed his eyes.

“The aura of the Netherworld. Then it should be it. Even the divine objects of the primal chaos era have appeared. The nine heavens and ten lands are definitely about to enter a great era. All kinds of monsters will be appearing one after another. I wonder if these old bones of mine will be able to deal with them?”

The elder shook his head slightly before lowering his head and continuing to sweep.

…

The transportation formation lit up and Long Chen walked out of it. After that, countless startled cries rang out. Before he could even see anything, a burst of fragrance struck Long Chen, and a soft body crashed into him. Bai Shishi hugged him tightly.

“I knew that a scoundrel like you wouldn’t die.”

Long Chen was startled. The countless disciples around the transportation formation were also startled. As for Bai Zhantang, he froze. Only Bai Shishi’s mother and Bai Xiaole’s mother exchanged a look and smiled.

Long Chen saw countless experts in the surroundings, vigilantly guarding against the unexpected. For Bai Shishi to hug him like this in front of them, even he felt a bit odd.

Only then did Bai Shishi react. Her face was as red as an apple. She then viciously punched him, covered her face, and fled.

“Boss!”

Once Bai Shishi left, Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and Xu Zixiong surrounded him excitedly.

Ever since Long Chen had vanished within the spatial channel, their hearts had been clenched in worry. Now that he was back, they shouted in excitement.

“Boss, you even advanced to the Divine Lord realm?” Qin Feng was shocked. Long Chen had actually advanced first.

“No way! Boss, how could you do that? We were waiting to undergo tribulation with you!” cried Bai Xiaole disappointedly.

They had long since reached the point of being able to advance to the Divine Lord realm, but in order to obtain the most benefits from the heavenly tribulation, they were waiting to go through it with Long Chen.

“No worry. Gather everyone. I’ll bring you through your tribulation.” Long Chen waved his hand heroically.

Just then, the grand formation of the seventh branch academy rumbled.
