Chapter 1600 An Affair?

Translator: BornToBe

The woman brushed her right hand in front of her chest, most likely as some kind of strange and ancient etiquette. Long Chen didn’t know what she was saying, but based on her expression, he guessed she was thanking him.

“No need to be courteous... it was that... big, hairy fellow... he was too irritating... I didn’t like the way he looked... I was just venting...” Long Chen began to gesture as he spoke, telling a story with his arms and expressions, hoping she would understand.

“Maybe if you didn’t gesture, she would understand better. But the way I see it, it looks more like you’re trying to seduce her,” laughed Evilmoon.

“Tch, how could my communication abilities be so bad?” raged Long Chen. He thought he was showing what he wanted to say very clearly.

Seeing Long Chen’s expression, the woman laughed. However, seeming to feel it was impolite, she quickly stopped.

She began to speak again, and following Long Chen, also began to gesture.

However, he was unable to understand anything she was trying to say. Furthermore, he found that her spiritual fluctuations were completely different from his own. There was no way to communicate.

As a result, the two of them just looked at each other helplessly.

After a while, Long Chen felt like he had rested enough. He bade his farewell. “Goodbye, pretty lady.”

Long Chen didn’t want to waste any more time. He wanted to take the white water.

However, the woman grabbed him before he could leave. Holding his hand, she suddenly got down on one knee, causing Long Chen to jump in shock.

“Hey, are you proposing? That’s way too sudden! I’d have to go back and discuss this with my other wives first...!” cried Long Chen.

The woman ignored whatever he was saying. She closed her eyes and began to murmur something. A hallowed light began to shine from her face.

“Evilmoon, what’s she saying?! This couldn’t be a marriage ceremony, right?!” asked Long Chen.

“Stop dreaming. Although I don’t know what she’s saying, this is clearly a prayer. Perhaps she’s blessing your poser arts to continue improving beyond perfection so you can advance the entire art.”

“Fuck off!” cursed Long Chen. He found that Evilmoon was growing more and more unreliable, even though they were now getting along better.

The woman eventually opened her eyes. She actually left a deep kiss on the back of Long Chen’s hand, causing him to jump. He had never encountered such a situation and was dumbfounded.

An imprint of her lips was left on the back of his hand once she finished. Long Chen knew he was doomed. Once he returned, how was he supposed to explain this? What would Tang Wan-er do to him?

However, he then realized that this mark would disappear once he returned to his physical body, and there would be no proof of it ever happening. Could this be the legendary... secret affair?

After giving him this kiss, the woman respectfully bowed toward him, turned around, and left. In the end, that legendary affair never happened.

“Hahaha...” Evilmoon’s laughter was quite delightful.

“Shut up! Your laughter sounds too ugly!” raged Long Chen.

Evilmoon’s laughter only grew more delighted.

Long Chen cursed. Flame energy enveloped him again, and he rushed off.

With his previous experience with the invasion of the Ice Qi, his body seemed to have formed a certain resistance toward it, and it wasn’t as painful as the first time. Although the Ice Qi still managed to invade his body, he was able to resist it.

Long Chen quickly reached the end of the blue region. The red lake was ahead. This was the red lake that Qu Jianying had encountered.

Long Chen took out the black boat once more. He found that the primal chaos space’s black soil was really miraculous. Even the red lake was unable to do anything to it. Only then did he jump in the boat and start using it again.

He ran into trouble almost immediately after entering the red region. One of the fish monsters attacked him. He had already tested the water and found that it was strangely sticky. There was no way for his thunderforce or flame energy to run across it.

If he fell off the boat, it would probably be troublesome. Furthermore, he couldn’t kill this creature, or countless more of them would be drawn over. It would then become difficult to advance.

The fish monster was thirty-meters long. His tiny boat was like a plaything in comparison to it.

The fish monster wasn’t trying to eat Long Chen. It was actually playing with the boat, using it as a ball. It threw Long Chen left and right.

Long Chen ignored it at first, thinking that it would get tired of playing and leave. However, it seemed to be having great fun. Sometimes, it threw Long Chen into the air, making him nauseous.

“Fuck, did I give you too much face?”

Long Chen furiously slapped the fish monster, sending it flying. Its cultivation base wasn’t very strong, so Long Chen used only the slightest power to avoid killing it.

What irritated Long Chen was that since he had entered the Netherworld with the old man, he could only descend into the whirlpool from the black lake’s path.

In the other regions, he was unable to descend down. That was why the only thing he could do was go all the way around through the other regions. At the bottom of the whirlpool, he was unable to find any other path up. Then as soon as he had gone back up the staircase in the black region, even it had vanished, so he couldn’t even go back down.

This Yellow Springs Path was too strange. It had its own laws that Long Chen didn’t understand.

The fish monster let out a furious roar and charged back at Long Chen after being slapped.

“Fuck, just wait!”

Long Chen returned to the previous region. Using the black soil, he made chains and roasted them with the Heaven Incinerating Flame. It sounded strange as the Heaven Incinerating Flame was said to be able to burn anything in existence. However, it was unable to ignite this black, sticky soil.

Furthermore, using soil to form chains also sounded strange. The resulting chains were both tough and flexible. Long Chen made two three-hundred-meter chains, as well as two large hooks.

As Long Chen was working on the border between regions, the fish monster roared at him. It didn’t dare to go over to that region, but it was also unwilling to leave.

“Fuck off!” After finishing the chains, Long Chen flung them at the fish monster.

The sharp hooks at the end of the chains dug right into it, causing it to cry out and rush away.

“Pull my boat for me!” Long Chen sat in the small boat and held onto the chains. The boat began to speed along the water behind the fish monster.

However, the path it went was not a straight line. It was constantly winding as the fish monster tried to shake off the chains.

However, there were countless barbs on the hooks, and there was no way for it to escape.

Long Chen constantly pulled the chains, causing the fish monster to roar in pain. This fish monster was very strange. Its upper body was almost humanoid. It had two long tentacles, while its head was elongated and had a horn. Its mouth was full of sharp teeth, and its lower body had dozens of long tails. Each tail ended in a fin.

“Hmph, you want to go down? Get up here!”

Just as the fish monster tried to dive to pull Long Chen into the lake, Long Chen pulled up. The fish monster was immediately pulled into the air. It tried several times without ever escaping Long Chen’s control.

It could only swim forward. If it deviated, he would pull on the chains, and if it slowed down, he would zap it with a lightning needle.

In the end, the fish monster obediently pulled Long Chen’s boat forward.

There was a long-haired lifeform in the midst of crossing the red lake. He was blocking the attacks of a fish monster when he saw another strange fish monster speeding toward him. He immediately turned pale.

Although these monsters weren’t powerful, they possessed a strange power that ate away at his defensive barrier. Just one was his limit. If another came, he would be doomed.

“Mush, mush! Faster, what are you daydreaming for! My time is precious!”

An arrogant cry rang out. The fish monster shot past him, and then he saw another figure right behind it. The fish monster and the figure shot past him in just an instant.

“Heavens... what was that?” cried out the lifeform.

“Eh, it knows the human language?”

Long Chen managed to catch what the lifeform said. This was his first time encountering a lifeform that spoke the same language as him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He had an urge to go back and ask him questions; however, he also didn’t want to waste any time. He decided to just let the fish monster continue pulling him.

“Mush! Mush!”

As Long Chen urged it on, he saw that it was already frothing at the mouth from how exhausted it was.

However, Long Chen didn’t care if it died. Didn’t it think itself to be very badass? In the beginning, he had been forced to endure its attacks without being able to retaliate. Now the tables had turned.

This thing might not be very powerful, but its recovery abilities were quite amazing while it was inside this lake. As long as it didn’t die, it would recover quickly.

The white lake quickly appeared ahead of him. However, once he got close to it, the fish monster refused to advance no matter how Long Chen struck it. It seemed it was absolutely terrified of the white lake.

Long Chen could only release it. However, now his chains had two large chunks of flesh on it. The fish monster let out a roar and fled for its life. It didn’t dare to do anything to Long Chen anymore.

Long Chen slowly paddled his way across the remaining distance. He sensed vast life energy coming from the white lake.

However, just as he approached it, he sensed danger. A black light shot out of the water at him.
