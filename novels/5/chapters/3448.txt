Chapter 3437 Revolt?

“Lord Brahma, ah, Lord Brahma. Just look at how dusty your face is. Boss Long San will help wash your face.”

In front of countless dumbfounded gazes, Long Chen peed on the head of the divine statue and critiqued it.

“Long Chen, you are courting death!”

Long Chen had not just destroyed the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture but was also blaspheming his god. The hall master’s expression instantly twisted with fury.

This piss was done to Long Chen’s heart’s content. There was no helping that there was limited storage for such a matter, and ultimately, it ended. After that, Long Chen slowly tied his belt.

He smiled at the hall master, showing his teeth. “Are you mad? Are you angry?” Suddenly, Long Chen’s smile vanished, replaced with furious killing intent. “Do you know how enraged I am? Lord Brahma, the day that I cut off your head will come sooner or later!”

BOOM!

Long Chen swung the Minghong Saber down. Because of it, the divine statue shuddered and countless runes lit up. A divine aura soared. Long Chen was actually knocked away by those runes.

This divine statue was protected by faith energy, so nothing could destroy it. Long Chen almost coughed up blood from the impact.

“Courting death!” The hall master roared and a pill furnace appeared in his hand. He then smashed it at Long Chen. At this moment, diagrams of the sun and moon flowed on top of it. It was a Daynight Furnace with Fallen Daynight’s aura coming from it.

BOOM!

Long Chen fearlessly swung his saber, unleashing Split the Heavens again.

But this time, an immense force almost broke his arm. His insides were also shaken, and blood leaked out of his mouth. However, this also blew back the Daynight Furnace.

“He forcibly received the attack of a World King?!”

In the distance, the leader of the Lightning Falcon race was amazed. It had to be known that the hall master was currently crazy with fury. That had been a full-power attack from him, but Long Chen had blocked it.

Long Chen’s blood was flipping inside of him, and he was forced far into the distance. A true World King was far stronger than a half-step World King. Thus, Long Chen was at a great disadvantage.

“Die!”

The hall master once more sent the Daynight Furnace smashing toward him. At this moment, Long Chen saw a divine statue in a pillar of divine light behind the hall master.

Then looking back at the statue of Lord Brahma on the ground, he saw that it was glowing brightly. The hall master was using its power.

BOOM!

Long Chen once more exchanged blows with the hall master. And this time, he coughed up blood. The sacred power of the pill furnace now contained Lord Brahma’s power.

“Not good.” Long Chen’s heart shook. This fellow was a true World King. Although Long Chen had advanced to the Divine Lord realm, he was still at a disadvantage. After all, they were two realms apart. It wasn’t like in the Four Peak realm when he could easily kill Immortal Kings.

The hall master’s manifestation shone brightly, resonating with Lord Brahma’s divine statue. As the Heavenly Daos cried out, his aura continued to climb.

Suddenly, Long Chen shot toward Lord Brahma’s statue. Seeing this, the hall master snorted and formed hand seals. A barrier then appeared around Lord Brahma’s statue.

In truth, he wasn’t worried about Long Chen destroying the statue. The statue had been nourished by faith energy for tens of millions of years, so it was practically indestructible. Let alone Long Chen, not even a World King could destroy it.

This barrier he set up was merely to prevent Long Chen from further blaspheming his god before his death.

The hall master once more sent the Daynight Furnace smashing toward Long Chen. It was simply brute force, but it was even stronger than the last two blows. Now, the Daynight Furnace emitted such immense pressure that it was as if the world was about to collapse.

Long Chen ignored the Daynight Furnace. When he arrived in front of the barrier, he suddenly took out a dagger. This was that mysterious broken sword that he had found in the black sea of the Netherworld.

Long Chen threw the dagger. The black-as-ink tip silently cut through the barrier and the divine statue’s head, flying out of the back of its head.

Those powerful runes and the materials of the divine statue were pierced like they were tofu.

Lightning runes then flashed around Long Chen’s body. He vanished, reappearing behind the statue where he grabbed the dagger.

BOOM!

Just then, the Daynight Furnace smashed down perfectly into the divine statue. As a result, the statue crumbled. It was destroyed by the Sacred Pill Hall’s master.

The hall master’s head buzzed. Seeing this scene, he just stood there, dumbfounded. His head was blank as he had no idea what to do.

“Aiya, it seems that you want to start a revolt? By destroying Lord Brahma’s divine statue, are you going independent from him?”

Long Chen felt incredibly satisfied when he saw the hall master’s dazed expression. This fellow had executed the nine star heir before, so Long Chen wished to personally skin him and pull out every muscle in his body. But having him destroy the statue of his own god was also very satisfying.

The hall master suddenly coughed up blood. It was unknown if it was due to his mental state or if it was from losing his connection to the divine statue, but he suddenly turned as pale as paper. His face was twisted.

Long Chen’s gaze shifted. He then moved, appearing amongst the broken fragments of the statue and grabbing the Daynight Furnace.

“Courting death!” The hall master was further incensed, so he hastily formed hand seals. Regretfully, just as he formed his hand seals, he found that he could no longer sense the Daynight Furnace. He had lost his connection to it because Long Chen had tossed it into the primal chaos space.

This time, the hall master coughed up three mouthfuls of blood. That was his life furnace with his spiritual marks on it. But now that those marks were forcibly erased, his soul was damaged.

“I am confiscating the instrument of your crime. I’ll use this evidence to show Lord Brahma that you are preparing to revolt.” Long Chen laughed.

“You… you… kill him!” The hall master stuttered before roaring. After that, he took out a sword and charged at Long Chen. Halfway there, his two assistants cried out and hastily went to support him.

Just then, a blood-colored saber appeared out of nowhere right in front of the hall master.

“Isn’t that…!”

The expressions of the Lightning Falcon race’s experts changed. They recognized the technique that Long Chen had just used. It was an innate divine ability of the Lightning Falcon race, Lightning Teleport. Furthermore, the number of people qualified to cultivate this technique did not surpass ten, but Long Chen had actually learned it.

Long Chen had not displayed this secret art this entire time just to wait for a chance. Now, he had succeeded. The Minghong Saber then shuddered, and his power erupted within the hall master’s body like a volcano.

As a result, blood sprayed out and a large hole appeared in the hall master’s chest. However, he didn’t die. His two assistants managed to protect his life, pulling him back from the border of death. They then retreated, creating distance between them and Long Chen.

Just then, countless demonic beast experts charged over, and dozens of World Kings surrounded Long Chen.

“Die!”

Those World Kings attacked together. Their divine weapons whistled toward Long Chen with all their power.
