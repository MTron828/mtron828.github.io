Chapter 3718 Targeted by Everyone

Xia Guhong’s tone was calm but full of confidence and unquestionable domineeringness.

Even in front of his old enemy Weng Taibei, a Divine Venerate in the form of He Hongzhang, as well as threats like Liao Bencang and Enpuda present, Xia Guhong dared to make such a declaration. Countless people were shaken. At the same time, they also felt deep veneration.

Xia Guhong was a figure that had led an entire era, a hero filled with a legendary flavor. Perhaps only such an expert would have this kind of confidence. This was a true expert.

“I know that my big brother has that ability,” said Long Chen. “However, look at that damn fatty’s gaze roving around. He wants me to fight as a lesson to his disciples, for them to study my weaknesses. I’m not afraid of anyone in the same realm, but if someone is trying to con me, I’m not going to just foolishly jump in. That would be falling for this fatty’s scheme. It’s not worth it. I’ll let him live a bit longer. In any case, I’m in no rush to obtain that sword.”

Perhaps amongst all these people, the one that gave Long Chen the greatest sense of danger was Enpuda. He was more dangerous than anyone here.

They had fought before in the Darklight Heaven. At that time, Enpuda had been much more reserved and cautious than he was right now. The more Long Chen thought about it, the more he felt it to be off. This fellow was too sinister, so Long Chen had no choice but to be cautious.

Since Long Chen said this, Xia Guhong nodded and didn’t say anything further.

“Xia Guhong, I’ve searched for you for many years. So you were hiding in the Wine God Palace. Are you no longer planning on hiding now? Today, let’s decide who is stronger right here and now. Let us settle all our grievances.” Seeing Long Chen refuse to fight, Weng Taibei directly challenged Xia Guhong with an electric gaze.

Xia Guhong indifferently said, “I am now a disciple of the Wine God Palace. My old grievances have long since become smoke and clouds in my eyes. Ever since my wife left me, I’ve lost interest in this kind of battle.”

Everyone’s heart was shaken when they looked at this peak hero possessing ruler qi. They all sighed inside.

Just what kind of hero was he? But he was unable to get past his love. After Luo Qingying died, Xia Guhong’s fighting heart also died with her. A generation’s hero no longer had any interest in the world.

Even in front of his old enemy, he was still calm. Many people wished to once more see Xia Guhong’s grand figure.

“What? An old hero actually uses a dead person as an excuse? Xia Guhong, you’ve fallen.” Weng Taibei still didn’t give up after Xia Guhong rejected him.

At this moment, countless people’s expressions changed. Xia Guhong and Luo Qingying’s story was a pure symbol, and Xia Guhong’s undying love for Luo Qingying was something countless people felt admiration and longed for. Now, Weng Taibei was actually using Luo Qingying to antagonize him? That was absolutely despicable.

“You fucker, do you know how to speak? If you don’t, then shut your butt and stop spouting all that crap!” roared Guo Ran furiously, pointing at Weng Taibei. He looked to be on the verge of attacking him.

In just this short time together, Xia Guhong already treated both Guo Ran and Xia Chen like his little brothers. Hence, other than Long Chen, Xia Guhong was the person whom Guo Ran revered the most. He refused to allow Weng Taibei to insult him like this.

“My cultivation base is low right now. If I had your cultivation base, I’d change my surname to yours if I couldn’t crush you.” Guo Ran clenched his teeth.

It wasn’t just Guo Ran and Long Chen’s side that was enraged. There were countless experts who glared at Weng Taibei furiously now. Despite him being a powerful senior, his words were too sinister. They completely lacked the style of an expert.

“Guo Ran, leave it be. What is the point of quibbling with someone who hasn’t made the slightest improvement even after living countless years? He can only spit at others to keep up appearances. Let’s go drink.” Xia Guhong smiled slightly and patted Guo Ran’s shoulder, having him calm down. He also patted Long Chen and Xia Chen’s shoulders because he saw that Long Chen’s expression was a bit frightening.

What kind of figure was Xia Guhong? He instantly saw through Long Chen’s intentions. He was going to agree to Weng Tianyao’s challenge and kill him as a slap in Weng Taibei’s face.

However, when Xia Guhong patted his shoulder, Long Chen restrained his anger. Xia Guhong might have transcended such matters, but Long Chen hadn’t. Perhaps Long Chen would never be able to reach Xia Guhong’s height.

Since Xia Guhong had said this, Long Chen could only put aside his anger. Inside, he cursed them and swore to kill them.

“Qingxuan greets senior.” When Xia Guhong walked over, Yu Qingxuan hastily bowed.

“What senior? Call him big brother. Don’t mix up the seniority, or you’re going to have to call me senior too.” For some reason, seeing Yu Qingxuan’s face caused most of Long Chen’s fury to vanish. His mood instantly improved and he smiled.

“Yes, you can call me big brother.” Xia Guhong also smiled.

Yu Qingxuan blushed slightly. Long Chen was doing this on purpose. This would make them appear even closer. Yu Qingxuan then gave Long Chen a cute face before once more bowing to Xia Guhong. “Qingxuan greets big brother Guhong.”

Following that, the other disciples of the Vermilion Bird Empire behind her also bowed. They all had worshipful expressions. This was a legendary existence. How many experts in this world would have a chance to even see him?

After a few more courteous words, they directly returned to the restaurant to drink. As for Weng Taibei and the others, they no longer said anything else. They just watched as Long Chen and the others left.

This conflict ended with the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s prince being killed. Countless people had personally witnessed a Supreme heavenly genius fall. Although the next battle between Long Chen and Weng Tianyao didn’t occur, people were still shaken.

“Long Chen’s life is mine. I’ll kill anyone who dares to interfere,” declared Weng Tianyao coldly as he watched Long Chen leave.

Long Chen had said such arrogant words but refused to fight him. Hence, Weng Tianyao was enraged and directly announced that Long Chen was his target.

“What a joke. I’m the one who’s going to kill him. If you don’t like it, I’ll kill you too.” As a result of his declaration, the Nine Underworld Luocha was instantly provoked.

“Youngsters, don’t be too arrogant. Be careful of swallowing your tongue,” sneered Long Qinian.

“Long Chen is the most famous person from the Darklight Heaven. He represents the Darklight Heaven’s greatest heavenly genius. Whoever takes his head will instantly soar in fame. Do you think that people will let him off just because of you? You’re too naive. If you want to kill Long Chen, then you’ll have to use your real skills!” Ji Wuming also spoke up. However, just like his master Enpuda, he brought up all the benefits of killing Long Chen.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Following the declarations from the NIne Underworld Luocha, Long Qinian, and Ji Wuming, the other Supreme heavenly geniuses also added in their own words, clearly dissatisfied with Weng Tiangyao’s words.

“Hahaha, what a joke. If anyone disagrees with me, then just come. I’ll send you to your death,” laughed Weng Tianyao. His lightning sword came out of its sheath once more, and he pointed it at the crowd.

Killing intent instantly appeared in the Nine Underworld Luocha’s eyes. Just as she was about to step forward, she was held back by Liao Bencang.

“These tough words are meaningless at this time. Everyone can fight in the three thousand worlds!”

Following that, all the heavenly geniuses snorted and began to scatter. A satisfied smile slowly crept across Enpuda’s face.
