Chapter 4481 Golden Metal Soul Refinement

In front of the gates of the High Firmament Academy, countless people had pitched tents across the wilderness, turning this place into their temporary home. Other than that some empty land right in front of the entrance, the rest of this area had been occupied by lifeforms of various races.

Ever since Long Chen defeated the self-proclaimed first Heavenly Doyen, Netherdragon Tianzhao, his name echoed throughout heaven and earth. The revelation that a Heavenly Doyen was unable to defeat the Sage King drove countless experts mad. Furthermore, under their push, some people started to “speak up” for Long Chen, saying that so-called Heavenly Doyens were trash in front of Long Chen.

As a result, Long Chen was instantly pushed to the heart of the storm. Long Chen himself didn’t realize that he was being targeted by all Doyens and budding Doyens, including the human race’s.

By defeating the first Doyen of the world, Long Chen had essentially slapped the faces of all other Doyens. Hence, anyone who could defeat him would soar like a shooting star.

Fame and profit were the most enticing things to people. While cultivators might not care that much about profit, fame was something they would bleed for, and they would not hesitate to risk their own lives for it.

When a person died, their name would remain. However, within the long flow of history, most heavenly geniuses were nothing more than specks of sand that drifted away. Nevertheless, every person hoped to leave their own brilliant mark on history.

When Long Chen led the army into the Esoteric Spirit World, people had already gone to the High Firmament Academy to challenge him. Terrifying experts emerged from all around the world just to challenge him.

At that time, Long Chen was in seclusion in the Esoteric Spirit World, so he naturally didn’t do anything about it.

As a result, an increasing number of experts gathered. Terrifying heavenly geniuses were like ants here, surrounding the gates of the High Firmament Academy. If Long Chen didn’t come out, they wouldn’t leave.

However, Long Chen, being in the Esoteric Spirit World and unaware of the situation, naturally did not come out to confront them. As time passed, the crowd grew more chaotic.

That was because gathering so many heavenly geniuses was like mixing dragons and snakes. Many heavenly geniuses were arrogant existences who looked down on all others.

In the end, conflicts started to erupt amongst the challengers. Almost every day, multiple battles between Doyens would occur, leading to the death of some.

Meanwhile, the disciples of the High Firmament Academy simply watched from the other side of the gates, observing how Doyens fought.

The other experts also got to see a free show. Some older experts had specifically come to assess the battles and impart lessons to their juniors.

As time went by, the region in front of the High Firmament Academy’s gates turned into a neatly laid-out fighting ring for heavenly geniuses. As long as they didn’t get close to the entrance, the academy ignored them and let them fight.

These Doyens were clearly lacking compared to Netherdragon Tianzhao. After all, the academy didn’t even need to activate its grand formation when they battled, as they were unable to cause any significant damage to the surroundings.

As more time passed, people started to get bored. Just like the saying, “A full bottle doesn’t make noise when shaken; it’s the half-empty bottles that make the most noise,” these arrogant fellows were mostly second-rate, predominantly spoiled rotten brats.

Constantly praised by those around them as unmatched, they started to believe it as well. It was only when they engaged in actual combat that the truth became evident—they were not tigers but mere kittens.

Under the lead of some actual experts, those people were driven away. After the unruly group was kicked out, everyone’s focus returned to the High Firmament Academy.

Every day, people shouted, trying to provoke the academy into action with infuriating insults. To make things worse, the voices of Heavenly Doyens were echoed by the Heavenly Daos, so every word entered the academy, and not even the formation could block them.

It went without saying that this constant stream of curses could easily enrage others. The disciples weren’t the only ones who found it unbearable; even some elders were incensed.

After all, these bastards had gone too far, cursing the High Firmament Academy from top to bottom, not even letting off the attendants and cooks. Their cursing simply encompassed everyone.

The subjects of the curses were Long Chen, Bai Letian, and the palace master.

Fortunately, the palace master was in a secret room and couldn’t hear their cursing. Otherwise, he’d have long since started a slaughter.

As for Bai Letian, he completely ignored them as this level of insults was unable to affect him at all.

However, while he was fine with it, the others didn’t have that level of apathy. To insult their dean was to insult the entire High Firmament Academy.

As a result, the elders of the academy repeatedly asked Bai Letian to tell Long Chen about this. How could they simply permit these arrogant fellows to shout at their door?

Under their pressure, Bai Letian finally sent a message to Long Chen. Long Chen and the others returned just in time to see five Heavenly Doyens standing in front of the gates, taking turns cursing.

They cursed Long Chen for being a gutless rat, the High Firmament Academy for its decline to the point where they should just disband, and all the experts inside the academy to just die. They even claimed that they would spare them if they kowtowed to them.

At first, Long Chen and the others thought it was a mere provocation. However, hearing the curses, they were consumed by rage.

“Long Chen, I heard you have several beautiful women! Hand them over! You’ll be dead, so you might as well let us enjoy them, hahaha!” One sharp-mouthed expert who looked like a monkey laughed lecherously.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“He’s mine.”

Bai Shishi’s face instantly became icy, and killing intent exploded out of her. She then shot out of the flying boat.

The moment Bai Shishi flew out, the space around her twisted, and she vanished.

Within the flying boat, Bai Xiaole had three flowers revolving in his eyes. He had used a pupil art to assist his sister.

The monkey-like Heavenly Doyen was in the midst of cursing vigorously and was still lost in his lecherous delight. He didn’t even hear the startled cries in the distance.

Suddenly, the space behind him quivered, and golden divine light illuminated the world. From within the light, a goddess statue emerged along with a golden lotus throne.

Finally, the monkey-faced Doyen noticed something off. Knowing that he had no time to summon his manifestation, he took out a shield.

Runes flowed on top of this shield, emanating an ancient aura that gave off a heavy pressure, shaking people’s souls. This was a powerful Eternal divine item.

BOOM!

The moment he summoned the shield, a golden sword pierced into it, resulting in a tremendous explosion that shattered the powerful Eternal shield.

The monkey-faced Doyen had one of his arms obliterated in the blast. He cried out in terror and hastily fled. But it was too late.

“Golden Metal Soul Refinement!” Bai Shishi shouted furiously and formed hand seals, conjuring a golden divine pool in the sky. A terrifying heat twisted heaven and earth.

The monkey-faced Doyen retreated straight into that golden pool. However, the moment he did, he bubbled and let out a miserable shriek.
