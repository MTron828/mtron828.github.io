Chapter 4311: High Grade Primal Chaos Spirit Stone

A mountain of primal chaos spirit stones was in front of them. Its brilliance nearly blinded them, leaving them in awe.

Fist-sized primal chaos spirit stones were piled up into a large mountain. Seeing this, Guo Ran cried out excitedly and dove into the mountain of spirit stones, rolling about excitedly. It felt like a dream come true.

Long Chen and Xia Chen were also incredibly excited, and they almost couldn’t believe their eyes. There were so many primal chaos spirit stones here, and they were all in perfect condition.

Even Long Chen felt the urge to pinch himself, half-expecting to wake up from what seemed like an incredible dream. He had never encountered such extraordinary luck and obtained what he desired so swiftly.

There were hundreds of millions of primal chaos spirit stones here. As a result, Long Chen was like a poor beggar with a mountain of gold, feeling like everything was surreal.

“We’re rich, we’re rich!” Guo Ran cried out delighted as he grabbed fistfuls of spirit stones and threw them into the air like a madman.

“Wait, this is only one of the treasuries!” Xia Chen suddenly shouted, spotting something on the wall.

“There’s more?!” Guo Ran came flying out of the mountain of spirit stones, his eyes shining.

Long Chen directly tossed all the primal chaos spirit stones into the primal chaos space. Meanwhile, Xia Chen had already run over to the wall and taken out a formation disc. He then placed it on the wall and began to decipher the runes on it.

Suddenly, the wall shrank and moved to the side, revealing another treasury full of primal chaos spirit stones.

However, when the three of them saw these spirit stones, they felt their hearts stop beating. These were also primal chaos spirit stones, but their aura was completely different. When this treasury was opened, a majestic surge of primal chaos qi engulfed the three of them.

They ran over to this pile of primal chaos spirit stones, and Long Chen reached for one. This stone was as big as the previous stones. However, the mist inside of it was different.

Unlike the previous spirit stones, this one had a denser, slowly undulating mist inside, and the feeling it gave off was completely different. It felt as though these spirit stones contained strange laws within them and possessed greater spirituality, as if they were imbued with a life of their own. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

"It appears that primal chaos spirit stones are categorized into low, middle, and high grades as well. These must be high-grade primal chaos spirit stones. We've hit the jackpot this time," Long Chen exclaimed.

While there were considerably fewer primal chaos spirit stones in this chamber, numbering only in the millions, their value likely rivaled, if not exceeded, that of all the low-grade primal chaos spirit stones found outside.

Long Chen had just put away the high grade primal chaos spirit stones when Xia Chen opened another gate, revealing another pile of spirit stones.

When this gate opened, a terrifying current blasted them, sending them staggering back, almost blowing them away.

“Damn, what level of spirit stone is this?!” Guo Ran exclaimed in astonishment. This pile of spirit stones was merely as tall as a normal person in total, and there were only a few hundred of them.

However, the energy contained within these spirit stones no longer existed in the form of mist; instead, it resembled flowing water. Moreover, their fluctuations were many times stronger than the so-called high grade primal chaos spirit stones found earlier.

“I was wrong. The previous ones were low grade and middle grade, and these should be the true high grade spirit stones,” said Long Chen as he grabbed one of the high grade primal chaos spirit stones.

It possessed terrifying energy like the core of a star. If it was unleashed, Long Chen felt like it could destroy an entire world.

“Now, we are super rich. These high grade primal chaos spirit stones possess the complete laws of heaven and earth, akin to a miniature version of heaven and earth. With their help, our brothers can definitely awaken primal chaos manifestations and root themselves into the ten thousand Daos,” said Long Chen excitedly, his hand holding the primal chaos spirit stone shaking.

Long Chen couldn't contain his excitement, and he felt like he had never experienced such incredible luck before. It appeared that the Sage King's karmic luck truly was extraordinary, rescuing him from his streak of bad luck.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were equally thrilled, but Long Chen was the first to regain his composure. He urged, "We must swiftly clear this place out. Gather everything we can. If the lifeforms here detect us, it could lead to trouble."

It still wasn’t the time to be happy. The real celebration would only come when they safely transported these treasures back to Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

Xia Chen used a formation to continuously unlock the treasuries here. Regretfully, the weapons treasury turned out to be nearly empty.

Long Chen deduced that, anticipating the imminent final battle, the Heaven Battling Divine Sect had spared no effort and had likely taken out every single weapon from the treasury.

However, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were both delighted to see many high-class divine materials in another treasury. The assortment included an abundance of immortal and divine metals, ideal for crafting Eternal divine items, so they quickly cleared out this treasure trove.

What dampened their spirits, however, was the fact that many treasuries had been destroyed by the battle. Up until now, Long Chen couldn’t find any cultivation techniques, medicinal ingredients, or pills, leaving him feeling a bit disappointed.

It would have been amazing if he could obtain them. After all, such ingredients were likely to be ancient species that had long since been extinct in the outside world. If Long Chen had them, he could refine even stronger medicinal pills.

“What is this?”

Suddenly, the three of them opened a treasury and saw countless strange armored monsters. They were of various sizes and forms with strange runes on them.

“I know! They’re puppets, but they’re not fighting puppets. They seem to be used for digging,” said Xia Chen suddenly.

After opening another treasury, they found even more armored puppets. However, these puppets were holding sharp weapons and emitted a murderous aura that gave them chills.

“These are definitely the fighting puppets! And their runes are so dense!” Guo Ran was delighted to see them. Perhaps he could base his future battle armor on them.

However, there seemed to be a problem with these fighting puppets. For them to be piled here, they were probably defective goods, as the surrounding few treasuries were all empty. It seemed that the powerful fighting puppets had all been taken out for combat.

Even though they were defective, both Guo Ran and Xia Chen still carefully put them away. They had a thought to create their own powerful puppets. If they could really accomplish that, wouldn’t they be completely unrivaled?

After taking the puppets, the three of them realized that they needed primal chaos spirit stones to activate them. In other words, as long as they had primal chaos spirit stones, they could raise a powerful puppet army.

After emptying all the treasuries, they returned to the large hall, and Xia Chen didn’t stand on courtesy, directly taking all the formation discs on the platform. He would need to properly study them when the time came, and he believed they would definitely benefit him immensely.

BOOM!

Just as the three of them were about to leave, the ground shuddered and terrifying auras started to rise, causing Long Chen’s expression to change.

“Not good. It seems that we’ve been exposed.”
