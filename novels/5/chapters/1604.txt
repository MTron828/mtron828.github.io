Chapter 1599 Blood-Colored Three-Headed Lion

Translator: BornToBe

The figure that had appeared was a three-hundred-meter lion covered in blood-colored fur. It had three heads, one large one and two smaller ones, growing out of the side of its neck. It emitted a terrifying pressure.

All of its hair was standing on end. A strong flame energy came from it, twisting space around it.

“What powerful flame energy. It’s not inferior to the Heaven Incinerating Flame at all!” Long Chen was shocked by that sight. Ever since he had come to possess the Heaven Incinerating Flame, he had yet to encounter another flame as strong as it.

The lion let out a roar toward Long Chen. Although Long Chen didn’t understand what it was saying, he could tell its general meaning: if you don’t want to die, then scram! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The lion didn’t pause as it rushed forward. It didn’t give Long Chen or the butterfly woman a chance to get out of its way.

It was extremely tyrannical. Its red fur glowed, and flames were constantly surging out of it. There was no way the two of them could get out of its way on this narrow path.

Long Chen saw the pale face of the butterfly woman. Looking at her wings, he realized she had to be weak to fire.

Most likely, her wings would be destroyed if touched by these powerful flames, and that was where most of the power of her cultivation base was located.

However, if she jumped into the lake, she would instantly be frozen and killed. She panicked.

“Fuck, I’ve seen tyrannical people but not someone even more tyrannical than me!”

Long Chen grabbed the butterfly woman’s arm and flung her into the air. She let out a startled cry.

“Kneel!” Long Chen roared. He leaped into the air and smashed his fist into its large head.

BOOM!

Violet ripples surged on the lake, and waves of Ice Qi soared into the sky. Long Chen and the lion fell off the floating logs and into the lake.

Up in the air, the butterfly woman was still letting out startled cries. Although she didn’t understand what Long Chen was saying, she knew that he had saved her. However, she couldn’t save him now that he had fallen into the lake.

In this place, her powerful wings were useless. She reached her peak in the sky after being thrown and slowly descended.

The lion appeared, standing on top of the lake. Flames enveloped its body, and divine runes appeared on its feet. It wasn’t frozen.

Long Chen was also enveloped in flames, standing on top of the lake and looking at the lion.

The lion stamped down on the water, transforming into a red bolt of light shooting at Long Chen.

Just now, neither of them had managed to get an advantage over the other. However, Long Chen had attacked from a stationary position, while the lion had been charging forward. To be even in power after that showed that Long Chen’s raw power surpassed the lion’s.

“I thought you were so badass, but you’re only this powerful.”

A flame spear appeared in Long Chen’s hands, and he stabbed it at the lion. Its giant claw met Long Chen’s spear.

BOOM!

The lion actually flipped into the air due to Long Chen’s attack. It let out a pained grunt as it tumbled back.

The butterfly woman stared in shock. She had never imagined this seemingly weak human would be even more terrifying than the lion.

She immediately ran along the wooden logs once she landed and stopped near the whirlpool. If she went down, she would be safe. However, she didn’t immediately leave. Instead, she watched as Long Chen fought the lion.

The lion let out a heaven-shaking roar. All of its fur stood on end, and its body seemed to grow larger. Suddenly, its other two heads opened their mouths as well.

Three fiery rays of sword-light shot out at Long Chen. Long Chen felt a chill, sensing a fatal danger from them.

Long Chen immediately dodged. Lightning wings appeared on his back as he instantly accelerated to his peak.

Shockingly, a large cut appeared on the lake where the first sword-light struck. Water droplets filled the air and transformed into frozen crystals.

Long Chen immediately unleashed a wall of flames, blocking the ice crystals. He definitely couldn’t touch those.

If just the surface of the water was so terrifying, then what about the water that shot out of the lake?

Long Chen jumped forward, charging toward the lion. It opened its mouth, and three rays of sword-light shot out again. They looked like they shot out together, yet there was a strange interval between them. They came at different angles, and according to reason, no matter how he dodged, he would be struck by one. This was one of the lion’s divine abilities, and it was incredibly powerful.

However, Long Chen’s body twisted strangely, and he unfathomably managed to dodge all of them. His speed was too fast for one to see how he had done it.

“Having the sixth sense activated really is nice.”

If it was before, Long Chen would only be able to take this attack head-on. However, now he could use his sixth sense to dodge this move. Any move that involved any trickery wouldn’t be able to fool him.

His head was also clearer than ever. He could clearly calculate the timing of any attacks coming for him. So these three strange attacks weren’t able to strike him.

No matter how powerful the move, if it couldn’t hit him, it would be useless. Having this sixth sense was extremely helpful.

Long Chen felt like he had been an amateur before opening his sixth sense. Only now was he a real expert.

The lion seemed to be shocked that Long Chen could dodge its attacks so easily. Furthermore, his speed hadn’t dropped.

It suddenly roared, and its body grew explosively. It once more opened its three mouths, and three huge bolts of sword-light pierced through space.

At this time, Long Chen was already close to it, and now that its body had grown larger, this attack was far too large for Long Chen to possibly dodge.

“You want to force me into a head-on exchange? That’s fine with me! Split the Heavens 6!”

The flame spear in Long Chen’s hands transformed into a flame blade. A huge flaming saber-image soared into the sky.

The huge saber-image crashed against the three bolts of sword-light. Flames exploded, and the immense force caused the water around them to explode. Countless crystals shot out.

In the distance, the butterfly woman covered her mouth. She hadn’t expected two crazy fellows to start a life and death battle in such a place.

When the flames vanished, it revealed a huge hole in the lake. The surging waves had frozen.

Within those frozen waves were Long Chen and the three-headed lion. They had turned into frozen statues.

Cracking sounds rang out as the ice encasing the two of them shattered at the same time. Long Chen slashed his flame saber at the lion once more.

The lion’s fur had started to dim. Unleashing consecutive powerful attacks had taken up a great deal of its energy. Hence, it turned to run.

“You want to run? No matter, you have to leave something behind! Do you think you can make me do so much work for nothing?!” roared Long Chen. He shot after the lion.

The lion used some kind of secret art, and its fur began to ignite. It accelerated, going even faster than Long Chen.

However, Long Chen had taken the initiative, and the lion’s body was too large for it to dodge fully. Long Chen’s attack ended up taking one of its legs.

“Hahaha, a leg’s not bad either- aiya, what the fuck?!”

Long Chen had just caught that leg when it suddenly vanished into ripples.

“Are you an idiot? None of the lifeforms here are in their physical bodies. What did you expect to get after wasting that much time and effort?” Evilmoon’s sneer rang out in Long Chen’s head.

All of Long Chen’s trump cards had been moved into his primal chaos space before entering the Netherworld, and so Long Chen could summon Evilmoon whenever he wanted. Furthermore, Evilmoon could see everything that Long Chen could see.

Long Chen had actually forgotten about this and had been thinking of bringing back the lion to study it.

However, he quibbled, “Tch, what do you understand? This is called teaching a lesson. If you didn’t even vent after something like that, would you even be a man?”

Long Chen returned to the floating logs. Even after such an intense battle, he hadn’t gained anything.

Only at this time did he sense the immense pain radiating through his body. Without even being aware, the Ice Qi had already invaded his meridians. He immediately began circulating his flame energy to expel it.

Just at this moment, the butterfly woman slowly walked over to him.
