Chapter 3962 Selling Oneself

“What are you doing here?!” Zhu Yifeng’s expression instantly changed when he saw Yu Qianxue.

“Long Chen is not your training partner. He is mine,” said Yu Qianxue coldly.

“You want to fight over my big brother? Hmph, it’s useless. I’ve already signed the contract. You’re too late,” snorted Zhu Yifeng. He then waved the document in front of her face.

“Why don’t you look at that document again? Whose name is on there?” asked Yu Qianxue.

Zhu Yifeng was startled and hastily looked down at the contract. Long Chen did the same. Shockingly, it was Yu Qianxue’s name there, not Zhu Yifeng’s.

“What did you do?” Long Chen was dumbfounded as he looked at Zhu Yifeng. How could he possibly make a mistake?

“I…” Zhu Yifeng was too shocked to answer. He refused to believe that this was the document, but Yu Qianxue’s name was clearly stated there.

“Long Chen, you are now my training partner. I’ll probably accompany you.” Yu Qianxue walked over to Long Chen and looked into his eyes profoundly.

Long Chen then looked at the advocate. The moment he did, the advocate turned his face away. That one movement caused Long Chen to instantly understand.

It was highly likely that this advocate had been bribed by Yu Qianxue to replace Zhu Yifeng's original document. Moreover, since Zhu Yifeng was present during that time, Long Chen had assumed that everything was already taken care of, leading him to sign the document without bothering to read it.

Long Chen was speechless. He hadn’t expected that after being smart for a lifetime, he would end up selling himself in a moment of carelessness. Furthermore, each contract lasted three years.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen then grabbed the document and looked at it more closely. It was a very clear contract between two people. Yu Qianxue’s name was written right where it should be, and she hadn’t hidden her name at all. Thus, Long Chen could only blame himself for not paying attention.

“Of course, you can tear up the contract, but that would mean that your word isn’t worth anything. I trust that you won’t do something like that, am I right?” Yu Qianxue smiled at Long Chen.

Long Chen looked back at her and also smiled. “I, Long Chen, naturally disdain doing such a thing. Don’t worry.”

After saying that, Long Chen handed the document to Yu Qianxue. Yu Qianxue then received it and put it away. She looked at Long Chen without saying anything.

“Big brother, I’m sorry!” Zhu Yifeng had been schemed against and he was ashamed. He had the urge to slap himself.

“It’s alright. It was my fault as well. Since that’s the case, there’s no need to grumble,” said Long Chen indifferently. He truly couldn’t blame Zhu Yifeng for this.

Out of nowhere, a streak of light shot toward Long Chen. Reacting swiftly, Long Chen extended his hand and managed to catch it mid-air. To his surprise, it turned out to be a status plate.

“Starting today, you are one of my people, so my princess mansion is your home. Come report to me within three days.”

After saying that, Yu Qianxue left with her bodyguards. She acted cleanly and efficiently, striking like lightning and moving like the wind.

Long Chen knew that Yu Qianxue did not actually want him as a training partner. What she wanted was to gradually draw him under her command.

This woman knew that Long Chen had come for Qingxuan. So, for her to dare to do such a thing, Long Chen didn’t know what she was thinking. Was she trying to humiliate Yu Qingxuan?

“Big brother…” Zhu Yifeng looked at Long Chen with a clear shame on his face.

Long Chen patted his shoulder comfortingly. “It’s a minor matter. Even with this contract, it doesn’t mean that I’ve sold my body to her. She’s nothing to be afraid of.”

“Long Chen!”

Suddenly, a friendly shout rang out. Long Chen then saw Yu Qingxuan walking over with a sweet smile.

“Qingxuan, you’ve also come.” Long Chen was delighted to see her.

“Yifeng greets big sister Qingxuan.” Zhu Yifeng hastily bowed to her.

“Yifeng, why are you here?” Yu Qingxuan was surprised to see him.

“Ah, it’s a long story. I’ll take my leave first.” Zhu Yifeng was at least not that dense, so he found an excuse to leave the two of them alone.

“Qingxuan? How are you here? And you’re alone!” Long Chen was exceptionally happy that she had come without those dislikable eunuchs.

“Hehe, the palace has many rules and I have many lessons. But I also have some free time. Today, I can do whatever I want to do,” said Yu Qingxuan with a smile. She was as happy as a child at this moment.

“Haha, good! This is the Vermilion Bird City! Imperial princess, show me the local culture of the Vermilion Bird Empire!”

“Yes, I know the most famous restaurants in the empire and the best views.” Yu Qingxuan laughed and pulled Long Chen over to a transportation formation.

Yu Qingxuan was now dressed like a regular commoner, without the ornaments to show off her status. That meant that she would no longer have any imperial privilege and that the imperial rules would not bind her.

She then acted as a tour guide, introducing Long Chen to the culture inside the city. There were ancient cultural relics and all kinds of delicacies to enjoy. It went without saying that the Vermilion Bird Empire did possess an ancient history. Here, there were many places with historical stories and special origins. Long Chen was sighing endlessly over all of it.

“Long Chen, you’re a good haggler, right? I want to buy a hairpin. Can you help me get one?” When they passed by an ornament store, Yu Qingxuan stealthily pointed at the small hairpin collection inside.

Long Chen knew that Yu Qingxuan wasn’t worried about money. Even if the store demanded an outrageous price, she could still buy it. She simply felt that it would be fun to see Long Chen bargain for stuff, just like when they were in the Violet Flame Heaven Capital.

“Boss, how much for one of these hair ornaments?” asked Long Chen directly.

“Wow, young master’s vision is amazing! This is my priceless treasure-”

“Alright, alright, why don’t you just tell me your price?”

“I see that you’re a good man. Are you buying it for your wife? I won’t play any games with you then. I’ll offer it to you at the lowest price, three thousand, not one copper less,” said the shopkeeper solemnly.

“Eighty.”

“What? Are you joking? That is impossible!” The old man’s expression grew a bit unsightly.

Long Chen didn’t reply. He simply grabbed Yu Qingxuan’s hand and walked away.

The shopkeeper hastily cried out, “Fine, fine, count it as me being afraid of you! Take it!”

Yu Qingxuan almost laughed. This haggling technique was truly shocking, but the shopkeeper actually accepted this price.

“Here. Give me my change.” Yu Qingxuan picked out one of the hairpins from the selection, and Long Chen tossed out a single hundred silver coin.

The shopkeeper took it and suddenly said, “This is too much money. I don’t have enough change for you. Young man, why don’t you take another hairpin before going?”

Pfft!

Long Chen almost coughed up blood.
