Chapter 4234: Origin of the Grudge

BOOM!

The void was torn straight through. With a single punch from Yan Wuji, the void was shattered like a mirror, and all the dark creatures within ten thousand miles were wiped out.

Yan Wuji’s attacks were not only fast but also incredibly powerful, leaving countless people clicking their tongues in amazement. It had to be known that the current Yan Wuji had not even summoned his manifestation. However, just a casual punch from him was already on par with a Triple Supreme’s ultimate attack.

As a result, a lot of people jumped in shock, but despite the commotion, Mo Nian had yet to show up.

Long Chen had also jumped just now, thinking that Yan Wuji’s senses were even sharper than his. After all, even Long Chen was unable to sense just where Mo Nian was.

When Mo Nian spoke, his voice drifted with no origin point, so there was no way to track it. Even his general direction couldn’t be sensed.

Therefore, when Yan Wuji attacked, Long Chen actually thought that he had managed to grasp Mo Nian’s aura. But it seemed that Yan Wuji had been tricked by Mo Nian.

“You damn rat! Come out and fight!” roared Yan Wuji, embarrassed by his failure.

This roar unleashed his powerful emperor might, shaking even the dark creatures. For the first time, they seemed to show fear and actually avoid him.

“Tch, even if I come out, what can you do? Weren’t you powerless to do anything to me last time?” sneered Mo Nian. But he still did not appear.

Listening to their conversation, everyone was startled to learn that Mo Nian had fought Yan Wuji. And based on Yan Wuji’s enraged and flustered appearance, it seemed that the grudge between the two of them was not small.

“Last time, if you didn’t run fast enough, you’d have died in the imperial tomb! A defeated general also dares to say such big words?!” roared Yan Wuji.

“Tch, if you didn’t have numbers, would I fear you? After bullying me with numbers, you dare say that I shouldn’t even run? How laughable. Furthermore, you really repay gratitude with enmity. If I didn’t dig you out of the tomb, would you have managed to come to this Sage King Convention?” retorted Mo Nian.

Hearing this, Long Chen swiftly grasped the situation. It became clear that Mo Nian had successfully reached the Yan Emperor's tomb, and in the course of his grave-robbing expedition, he had somehow awakened the slumbering Yan Wuji.

In other words, Yan Wuji had not woken on his own but was disturbed out of slumber by Mo Nian. Based on Long Chen’s guess, these other fellows with ancient auras were also startled awake by him. It was no wonder that they were so enraged when they heard Mo Nian’s voice.

“Bastard! If you have guts, stop running and fight like a man! One against one, no stopping until one of us is dead!” roared Yan Wuji.

This flustered appearance of Yan Wuji’s made countless people shake their heads inside. Despite being a descendant of the Human Emperor, he lacked character.

While they didn’t know what had gone on between Yan Wuji and Mo Nian, even if Mo Nian were the one to slay Yan Wuji’s father or steal his lover, as a descendant of the Human Emperor, Yan Wuji displayed a disheartening lack of composure and steadiness. It was truly disappointing.

Moreover, such a person wished to unify the human race? Perhaps just as Long Chen said, this fellow had been buried for too long and hurt his head during the process. Was he still living in ancient times?

“Give it up. You said the same thing last time, but didn’t you still attack me with a group of people? The descendants of the Yan Emperor really are amazing. To use Long Chen’s words, for you to take back your own crap without the slightest shame is a skill that the likes of us cannot imitate,” mocked Mo Nian.

Mo Nian's response nearly caused people to lose their composure and burst into laughter. This fellow didn’t give the Human Emperor’s lineage any face.

“Die!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Unable to contain his anger anymore, Yan Wuji roared and unleashed another devastating punch, causing space itself to shatter in the distance, obliterating numerous dark creatures.

Yan Wuji then followed up with seven consecutive punches, each one blasting apart the very void. The unlucky dark creatures were caught in his blows and died miserable deaths due to his relentless onslaught.

Despite their seemingly nonchalant nature, these strikes exuded a truly terrifying might. Even a random blow possessed terrifying heavenly might, as if he was possessed by a divine emperor, one who was in command of the ten thousand laws and Daos. Every blow carried with it an apocalyptic power.

However, even with all of that power, people couldn’t help but laugh at how Yan Wuji was unable to strike his target. Let alone forcing Mo Nian out, he didn’t even touch Mo Nian’s shadow.

“Oh, you’re not even going to let people tell the truth? In the imperial tomb, weren’t you all attacking me? If it had been merely a group of people in the same realm, that would have been one thing. But you also deployed so many innate Heaven Venerates against me. Okay then, if it had been just innate Heaven Venerates, that would also have been one thing. But you even activated the tomb’s grand formation to kill me! Is this your so-called one-against-one?” said Mo Nian lightly.

“Fuck you! You snuck your way into my Grand Yan’s imperial tomb to steal out treasures! You shit in my tomb and even tried to awaken other slumbering seniors! Did you think that I’d let you live?!” roared Yan Wuji.

This roar left countless experts in shock. Mo Nian really was evil. Had he really done this?

“Cough, you can’t blame me for that. If you have to blame something, blame yourselves for lacking any functioning toilets! Even after they went bad, you didn’t switch them! I had a terrible stomachache. As a cultured person, I couldn’t just relieve myself anywhere. I had to use the closest coffin to handle my emergency situation. Who would have thought that there’d be someone inside there!?” cried out Mo Nian.

This time, even Long Chen’s jaw dropped. He finally understood why Yan Wuji hated Mo Nian so much. It seemed that Yan Wuji actually wasn’t bad. If it was someone else, they would probably have gone insane.

“Shut your fucking mouth!”

Yan Wuji roared furiously. His hair stood on end, and killing intent exploded out of him.

“Fine, if you want me to shut my mouth, I’ll do so. This matter really was my bad. I apologize. Starting today, we can just forget about it and mind our own business, alright?” Mo Nian immediately offered him a handshake agreement.

“Alright, my fucking ass! I’ll tear you to pieces and grind you to dust before my hatred is quelled!” cursed Yan Wuji with even more crudeness than before, his fury unabated.

This time, no one laughed at him for being flustered. After all, if they had to endure that kind of humiliation, they doubted that they would handle the situation any more gracefully.

“Fuck, I give you face but you don’t give me face? Is your mouth so smelly because you ate my shit, or did you grow up eating shit from birth?” This time, Mo Nian cursed back angrily.

As soon as Mo Nian cursed back, Long Chen sighed inside. The moment he did so, his emotional fluctuations instantly exposed his position.

“I’ve found you! Die!”

Yan Wuji’s gaze instantly sharpened, and with a single step, he vanished from sight.
