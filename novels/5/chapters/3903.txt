Chapter 3892 Masochist?

“Ji Wuming!”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran cried out furiously. Their worst fears had become reality—the fearsome assassin, Ji Wuming, had finished his merger.

Before this, Ji Wuming already had high talent in controlling spacetime. So, now that his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone had merged, his assassination arts were unstoppable.

Even Xia Chen’s formation had lost effect against him. He had managed to slip through them and get close to Long Chen without any of them being aware of it.

Fortunately, Yue Zifeng was here. Otherwise, if they allowed Ji Wuming to get to Long Chen, the consequences would be too terrible to imagine.

When Yue Zifeng’s sword stopped Ji Wuming, Ji Wuming sneered, his body slowly fading. Like a drop of water falling into the sea, not a trace of him could be found.

Yue Zifeng’s expression changed ever so slightly. When Ji Wuming vanished, even his Sword Dao failed to lock onto him. He could no longer track Ji Wuming.

“Protect boss!” shouted Xia Chen. The Dragonblood warriors retreated, holding a tighter encirclement around Long Chen. They didn’t know if being this close would interfere with his absorption of the dragon runes, but there were no other solutions. Long Chen’s safety was more important.

Ji Wuming’s voice began to ring out, coming from every direction.

“Interesting. So what? If I aim to kill Long Chen, you can protect him, but if I aim to kill someone else…”

Suddenly, Yue Zifeng vanished again, his sword piercing toward the void and at a figure that appeared for only a flash.

This time, Ji Wuming wasn’t aiming for Long Chen but a Dragonblood warrior. As for that Dragonblood warrior, he didn’t even sense anything. Ji Wuming’s ghost-like movement art was chilling.

“Idiot! If you have guts, come out and fight!” shouted Guo Ran furiously.

“Only an idiot would say something so idiotic. My goal isn’t to be number one. I only want that dragon scale. Hehe, as long as I kill Long Chen, all the energy that he absorbed will be released. All his efforts will have been for nothing. I want to know, how much power does an already injured sword cultivator have to be able to stop me? You should know that the initiative is in my grasp. As for you, you are forced to defend passively. You’re using up far more energy than me. How many of my attacks can you block? I can fail countless times, but if you fail once, it means that one of you will be slain…”

Yue Zifeng once more attacked, accurately blocking Ji Wuming’s next attack. The two of them were so fast that others only saw sparks fly. They didn’t even get a glimpse of Ji Wuming this time.

People looked at Yue Zifeng in shock. Sword cultivators were said to be the bane of assassins. Assassins could accurately kill their targets in one blow without them even being aware of it, but sword cultivators were the only exception.

Sword cultivators had frighteningly sharp senses that could render the concealing techniques of assassins ineffective. The latter might not even be able to get close before being slain.

Even so, Yue Zifeng was facing no ordinary assassin but the Bloodkill Hall’s greatest heavenly genius, someone who had merged his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone, along with the spatial and temporal energy.

However, even this terrifying assassin was blocked by Yue Zifeng, unable to harm anyone. People were amazed by both of them.

“Let’s see how you will guard this!”

Just then, Long Qinian grasped his chance and came charging over with his dragon spear.

Although he didn’t know Ji Wuming, the enemy of his enemy was his friend. As long as Long Qinian could hold back Yue Zifeng, even for just a moment, Ji Wuming would instantly kill Long Chen.

Long Qinian admitted that he wasn’t a match for Yue Zifeng, but he refused to accept this lying down. He would rather gamble, speculating whether Yue Zifeng would dare to focus his full power on him or if Yue Zifeng would prioritize dealing with Ji Wuming instead.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Guarding until you see the Yama King should be no problem.” Suddenly, a large figure appeared in front of Long Qinian and tossed something at him.

It was a human head with an expression of furious resentment. It belonged to the lord of Silver Moon City.

As for the one blocking Long Qinian, it was Gu Yang. He was covered in blood and had dozens of small wounds on his body. It seemed that he had paid a price to kill the lord of Silver Moon City.

But shockingly, even though he was covered in wounds, his aura was even stronger than before. He was like an injured wild beast. They were always the most dangerous once they were injured.

“Which trash are you to dare to block my path?! Scram!” Long Qinian roared furiously, not viewing Gu Yang as a serious opponent. He then stabbed his spear at Gu Yang.

To everyone’s surprise, Gu Yang simply stood there, neither dodging nor blocking. As a result, Long Qinian’s dragon spear directly stabbed through his shoulder.

“Gu Yang!”

Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others were dumbfounded. They didn’t understand why Gu Yang didn’t block this attack. Was he already out of energy?

Even Long Qinian was startled. What was this bald fellow doing?

“Hehehe!” Gu Yang’s laughter resonated, emanating a somber and eerie tone. Blood then slowly trickled down from his wound. When ten thousand dragon runes appeared in his eyes, his face reflected the visage of a fiendish being.

“Good, just like that, just like that! I’m close, keep going!”

Gu Yang suddenly took a step back, pulling the spear out. After that, he pointed at his own chest, indicating for Long Qinian to keep stabbing him.

“Are you a masochist? You know you can’t sue me, right?” Long Qinian was dumbfounded. He had never witnessed someone so crazy.

“If you don’t come, let me.” Without hesitation, Gu Yang fearlessly moved forward and allowed the spear to stab into his chest. More blood then gushed out of the wound.

Everyone just stared, thinking that he had gone insane.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion shook this world, causing everyone’s heart to tighten. It felt like someone had just viciously squeezed their insides.

“Hehehe, finally it’s enough!”

Gu Yang looked at the spear inside of his chest and laughed sinisterly. As the runes in his eyes weaved together, they were no longer the eyes of a human, but those of a fiend.

BOOM!

The next moment, another explosion erupted and countless heavenly geniuses coughed up blood. They didn’t even know what they were injured by. People only looked around in terror, not knowing what was going on.

The spear in Gu Yang’s body shook, almost forced out of his body. At the same time, Long Qinian’s palms met with an intense backlash. He almost lost hold of his dragon spear.

Gu Yang’s strange eyes were staring at him, making his hair stand on end. For some reason, an intense sensation of terror climbed within him.

“What… what kind of monster are you…?!” shouted Long Qinian.

BOOM!

As another explosion erupted, Long Qinian grunted and was blown back along with his spear. The sheer impact caused his feet to dig into the void, leaving behind a trail of smoke as he fought to regain his balance and stabilize himself.

When the spear was forced out of Gu Yang’s body, people could finally see the bloody hole in his chest. They then saw the source of that explosive sound—his heartbeat!

“Finally, success. Wrath of ten thousand dragons dyes the world! Ten Thousand Dragon Armor!”

Gu Yang roared, his voice piercing the clouds and splitting rocks. As the ten thousand dragons in his manifestation roared, the sky changed color.
