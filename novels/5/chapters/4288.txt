Chapter 4277: Long Aotian’s Scheming

“Zifeng!”

Long Chen and the others were delighted to see his aggressive assault, as it was a clear indication that Yue Zifeng had regained consciousness and recovered.

Given the formidable intensity of his Sword Qi, even half-step Eternals could not fully block it. As a result, this Eternal expert’s mask was gone.

“Die!”

Shocked and enraged, he hastily attacked once more, his blow covering all of them. He didn’t want others to recognize his identity.

“You’re the one who’s going to die!”

Suddenly, a resounding cry pierced the air as a menacing black dragon claw extended toward him. The elder was startled and directly countered by slashing his sword at the approaching dragon claw.

BOOM!

The elder was blown apart. As for his Eternal divine weapon, it pierced into the ground and vanished from sight.

The palace master had actually attacked from a great distance, leaving countless people perplexed. While engaged in a fierce battle against seven half-step Eternals, how could he spare the attention to look after them?

However, the aftereffect of his “care” wasn’t something that just anyone could endure. This claw shattered space, unleashing explosive astral winds that sent Long Chen and the others flying.

Fortunately, Liu Ruyan had long since been prepared. Her branches covered everyone, preventing them from scattering through the air.

Nevertheless, this strike took a toll on Liu Ruyan, leaving her with a slightly pale complexion. All her branches were destroyed.

Just then, dozens of powerful auras rose as experts from various races appeared, each one of them having the aura of a half-step Eternal expert.

“Kill these humans! They cannot leave this place alive! We’ll stall this fellow!” shouted a devil expert wielding a white bone shield. After that, all of these powerful experts were rushing toward the palace master.

BOOM!

That devil expert was then sent flying by a claw from the palace master, but his shield managed to block it. After that, the devil expert shot back once more.

This devil expert seemed to be specialized in defense. Having no confidence in beating the palace master, he only wanted to stall him and create chances for others.

The palace master was now surrounded by over thirty half-step Eternal experts. With such a concentration of power in one location, the air crackled with the reverberations of Eternal divine weapons, causing the palace master’s figure to disappear amid the chaos. It seemed as if the world would explode.

“Kill Long Chen and take the title of Sage King!” roared Ye Wuchen. He was the first to reach Long Chen. On the other hand, Lian Wuying, Zhao Xingtian, the Shadow princess, the Ghost Dao lifeform, and other powerful experts from the various races were crazily charging over as well.

After dealing with that half-step Eternal expert, Long Chen and the others were forced to pause, allowing their enemies to instantly surround them. Just like that, they had lost their chance to get away.

“Brothers, it seems that we’re out of luck today. Being able to fight alongside you is my honor. If we don’t die, let us all meet again. But if we do all die, let us be reborn and fight together once more. Kill!”

Long Chen roared. At this moment, any kind of plot was useless. They could only rely on power to fight and survive.

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors and the other experts roared at the same time. They knew that they couldn’t kill their way out anymore, so they wanted to see how many enemies they could drag down with them before they died.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and the others were no longer holding back, so their powerful techniques came out furiously.

Long Chen roared and summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor once more. As his powerful aura erupted again, his devil saber whistled toward a half-step Eternal expert.

“Die!”

A half-step Eternal expert from the Blood race had just charged forward when Long Chen swiftly closed the distance to confront him.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s devil saber struck his opponent’s divine weapon. The power of his seven stars then poured into the saber, causing it to suddenly shatter.

As a result, Long Chen’s Blood Qi flipped inside of him, but his opponent also staggered back, startled. A little Immortal King like Long Chen was actually able to fight him evenly.

If Long Chen were to grow up, it would be a disaster for the Blood race. Hence, killing intent suddenly exploded out of the Blood expert. He pounced on Long Chen while Long Chen fell back.

With his devil saber gone, Long Chen summoned an Eternal devil spear. Seven stars then surged upon it, and it emitted a thunderous, earth-shaking roar.

BOOM!

Ignoring the spear’s resistance toward him, Long Chen simply smashed the Blood race’s Eternal expert with all his power. As a result, that spear exploded, while his enemy was sent staggering back three steps.

Long Chen was at a disadvantage as he lacked a suitable weapon. After all, the power of his seven stars was too domineering, causing weapons below the Eternal level to be unable to endure it.

Devil weapons bore the devil race's inscribed runes, imbuing them with a potent Yin energy. In contrast, the power of the seven stars was a supreme Yang force. Naturally, using both together would result in contradicting power resisting each other.

Indeed, Long Chen was able to use the power of the seven stars to forcibly subdue the devil saber, but suppressing it also caused its power to weaken. As a result, it was destroyed in one clash, and it was the same thing with the spear.

While the Blood expert was still stumbling back, Long Chen took out a shield and smashed it at him.

BOOM!

The shield exploded in front of the Blood expert. From within those fragments, a sword pierced out like a viper’s fang, stabbing the expert in the chest.

The immense power directly tore through his body. As a result, he screamed and hastily fled.

BOOM!

The relentless brute-power clashes rapidly drained Long Chen’s energy, causing his aura to fall. In his peak condition, the moment that sword pierced the Blood expert’s body, Long Chen’s power would have erupted and taken his life.

However, Long Chen was currently fatigued, and even though his attack pierced his opponent's body, he lacked the strength to obliterate it, allowing his foe to escape.

“Damnable human race! Just die!”

The blood expert felt a burst of fear as he had almost died just now. However, he also saw that Long Chen was exhausted. With that, he forcefully slashed his sword at Long Chen, shattering Long Chen’s weapon. Long Chen then coughed up blood and staggered backward.

“Long Chen!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Seeing Long Chen injured, Mo Nian tried to rush over to help, but another half-step Eternal was blocking him.

“Die!”

The blood expert’s face twisted sinisterly. He closed in on Long Chen and smashed his weapon at him, leaving no room for anyone to intervene and save Long Chen.

“Star Soul Shield!”

All of a sudden, Meng Qi cried out, her eyes filled with an infinite number of stars. After she swiftly formed her hand seals, a translucent starry shield appeared in front of Long Chen.

BOOM!

The Blood expert’s attack struck the shield and actually deviated to the side, causing him to miss.

However, the shield then disintegrated upon impact, and blood trickled from Meng Qi's lips. Her face was devoid of color

Seeing that Long Chen was unconscious, countless experts went crazy in an attempt to launch the killing blow.

Then, in a sudden burst of violet energy, a figure manifested like a phantom. When everyone caught sight of this figure, they cried out.

“Long Aotian, you dare?!” roared Mo Nian.

The one to appear at this crucial moment was Long Aotian. At some unknown point, he had returned to the battlefield, and now, his fingers reached toward Long Chen’s head.

“The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Did you truly believe you had bested me? Everything you possess belongs to me," Long Aotian sneered with a sinister grin.

“Is that so?”

Long Chen’s eyes abruptly snapped open, revealing a profound darkness within. Within that abyss, the image of three ominous flowers bloomed.

Long Aotian was instantly seized by terror, his soul almost leaving his body.
