Chapter 4021 Blue Flame Empire Lord Lan Tianba

When the army of Lightning Thunderclap Battleships arrived, the Blue Flame Empire’s experts immediately came out to greet them. It had to be known that the Lightning Thunderclap Battleships were a symbol of the Violet Thunderclap Empire, so everyone here thought that the Violet Thunderclap Empire’s people had come.

However, what greeted them was an enormous flame lotus. When it appeared, those Lightning Thunderclap Battleships instantly vanished.

“It’s a fake! Activate-”

The first person to react quickly roared, but Long Chen gave them no time at all.

BOOM!

The World Extermination Flame Lotus that had been brewing for a long time smashed down, causing the grand formation, which had just been activated, to shatter. The flame lotus then smashed into the heart of the capital.

As a result, a wave of fire decimated the buildings, instantly turning this grand capital city into ruins. Even Zhu Yunwen and the others were dumbfounded.

Long Chen was too vicious. They had never seen such a terrifying sight before.

“You sons of bitches of the Vermilion Bird Empire, how dare you?!”

A furious roar rang out. After that, an elder in blue robes with a crown on his head charged out.

“The Blue Flame Empire Lord, Lan Tianba!”

Zhu Yunwen and the others’ nerves tensed when they saw this elder. After all, he was a three-flower Earth Venerate.

The Blue Flame Empire only had two three-flower Earth Venerates. One of them was besieging the Vermilion Bird empire, and the other was right in front of them.

“Bastards, you dare to disguise yourselves as people from the Violet Thunderclap Empire?! Not one of you will leave alive!” Another elder came out of the rubble and immediately charged at Long Chen.

He was a Double Supreme Divine Venerate, and his face twisted with fury. He had just gathered the army here and was admonishing them.

That was because just now, Weng Tianyao’s master had come and transmitted Weng Taibei’s words, calling for them to prepare for battle.

Weng Tianyao’s master had only given some simple orders, but the Blue Flame Empire was the weakest of the eight empires, so in order to express their loyalty and sincerity, they immediately summoned their forces.

Soon after Weng Tianyao's master departed, Long Chen and his companions arrived. Seeing them, the soldiers were surprised to see people from the Violet Thunderclap Empire returning so soon. However, their bewilderment turned to shock when Long Chen unleashed his devastating World Extermination Flame Lotus upon them.

Millions of their elites, the majority of which were World Kings and even over a hundred thousand Divine Venerates, were wiped out in an instant. They were caught off-guard and without any defenses.

In the end, they died without even understanding what was going on. They had never dreamed that they would all die within the safest place inside the Blue Flame Empire.

Other than those elites, there were also millions of soldiers within the buildings. It could be said that the current capital was filled with the empire’s elite soldiers, but the majority were slain with one attack from Long Chen.

Hence, they felt like they were going crazy. At this moment, the ruins exploded as hundreds of Divine Venerates came out of the ground. The majority of those survivors were Double Supremes.

It was only thanks to their immense power that they managed to survive Long Chen’s attack. However, they were still left in a wretched state. Even though they survived, they were injured.

When Zhu Yunwen and the others arrived at the capital, they could sense countless powerful auras. But now, only a few hundred survivors remained in the entire capital, and all the other auras had disappeared.

Although they had experienced the Vermilion Bird’s trial by fire and become true experts, they were still frightened by such ruthlessness.

Looking at that black figure standing in front of them, they all rejoiced that this figure was a friend, not an enemy.

At this moment, Lan Tianba attacked and blue flames exploded out of the space behind him, instantly covering the entire capital. Upon seeing this, Zhu Yunwen and the others’ hearts quivered. They felt like their bodies were suppressed by some kind of power.

“The divine might of a three-flower expert.”

This was the most terrifying aspect of a three-flower expert. Their manifestation was one with the heavens, suppressing the aid of the heavens toward all others. With the ten thousand Daos obeying them, only fellow three-flower experts could resist this.

However, Zhu Yunwen and the others were only Immortal Kings. They were blessed by talent, and with their Heavenly Dao Crowns, they were able to resist World King Divine Radiances, the pressure of Divine Venerates, and even the suppressive effects of faith energy. But the power of the three flowers was an entirely separate concept.

If it was before the trial by fire, they wouldn’t have been able to move a single finger under this pressure.

This pressure reminded them of the pressure in the trial. However, the pressure here was even stronger.

Fortunately, they were still able to resist this pressure, so they clenched their weapons and stored up energy. With the pressure being resisted by eight hundred thousand of them, the effects were diminished.

Although this would definitely affect their combat power, if they all summoned their manifestations and joined forces, they weren’t afraid of it.

Within this blue flame domain, Lan Tianba moved like a phantom, suddenly appearing in front of Long Chen. His hand, resembling blue lightning, aimed directly at Long Chen's throat with deadly intent.

In response, Long Chen calmly swung his hand, and in that instant, a dazzling golden light erupted. Lan Tianba's face contorted in agony as he was sent hurtling backward like a shooting star.

Seeing this, the experts that had followed him into battle were caught off-guard. Struck directly by his body, they were blown apart by the impact.

BOOM!

Lan Tianba slammed into the heart of the city. This capital, which had become a hole in the ground, now had a deeper hole smashed into it.

Upon seeing this scene, Zhu Yunwen and the others’ jaws dropped, and they stared at Long Chen in disbelief. He actually slapped a three-flower Earth Venerate away? Was he a monster?

It wasn’t just Zhu Yunwen and the others who were shocked. Even Long Chen stared at his own hand in disbelief, feeling like it was inconceivable.

However, Long Chen wasn’t shocked by his power. What truly astonished him was his reaction speed. Even in front of a three-flower expert, he felt as if everything was within his control.

He also found that his speed, reactions, perception, and everything else had gone up by more than one level.

“It’s nothing to be surprised about. You never intentionally trained your spirit, soul, and will. But in the Vermilion Bird Empire, you awakened their power, so your improvement will naturally be rapid,” said the dragon expert lightly.

However, while it spoke calmly, it couldn’t conceal how pleased it was. Clearly, for Long Chen to become so powerful was also something it was proud of.

“Die!”

Just then, the ground shook and Lan Tianba charged out of it. The moment he came out though, Long Chen’s figure vanished.

When he reappeared, he was already in front of Lan Tianba, slamming his foot into his abdomen. In an instant, Lan Tianba’s body curled up and slammed back into the ground ten times faster than he had charged out. The spot that he fell was exactly the same as before.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The earth exploded once again. But unlike before, the entire city suddenly began to rise out of the ground, like some monster was standing from beneath the city. Following that, a violent immemorial aura rose.

With a furious roar, a giant wolf broke free from the ground, its wild power causing the stars to shake.

“Blue Flame Voracious Wolf. Hehe, you’ve finally come.” Long Chen smiled sinisterly.
