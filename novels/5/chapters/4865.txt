Chapter 4854 Pierced Through

The moment Long Chen unleashed his fist, the dragon image within his divine ring shook. His dragon scales flared, their runes briefly blazing with light before dimming.

However, before fading, the runes sent all of their energy into the scales on Long Chen’s fist. Like rivers flowing into a lake, the energy of all his dragon scales converged on his fist.

When Long Chen’s fist struck the Ten Thousand Blood Flag, a dragon-shaped mark appeared on his fist.

BOOM!

In front of countless nervous gazes, a heaven-shaking explosion occurred, unleashing qi waves that reverberated and shook the world.

Startled cries filled the air as Long Chen was blown back. His feet carved two long tracks deep into the ground, and he was pushed all the way to the edge of the martial stage.

Just then, wild astral wind buffeted the spectator stands. Lu Ziqiong and the others hastily grabbed their seats, feeling like the astral wind would tear them apart.

Mo Nian extended a hand, blocking a portion of the impact for Yu Tong and Yu Fei. However, since experiencing it was beneficial to them, he didn’t block it all.

As the impact reverberated through the spectator stands, quite a few people ended up coughing up blood and some nearly fainted from the force.

Despite feeling light-headed and in pain, their attention remained fixed on the martial stage. They watched as Cao Shaoqing, still in his attacking posture, thrust his Ten Thousand Blood Flag toward Long Chen.

Meanwhile, on the martial stage, two long lines were etched into the ground, leading to Long Chen's position at the edge. He gazed intently at his fist, causing the spectators to stare wide-eyed at him.

“Heavens, he actually blocked it.”

“What kind of monster is he? He used his fist to block the Ten Thousand Blood Flag’s attack?”

“Has the world gone insane? How strong is he? What kind of physical body does he have?!”

Seeing Long Chen emerge unscathed, not even a hair out of place, left the spectators completely stunned. After all, the Ten Thousand Blood Flag was a renowned legacy divine weapon from the immemorial era, responsible for the death of numerous Heaven Saints. The fact that such a terrifying weapon was blocked by a mere fist was beyond their comprehension.

“Amazing. You even pierced my skin,” Long Chen remarked, looking at his fist with deep emotion. A bit of blood could be seen around the scales of his fist, though not enough to drip.

The spectators almost spat out blood to hear this. Long Chen actually praised his opponent for being amazing when all the latter did was prick his skin? To them, it was practically an insult.

Cao Guofeng’s expression once more shifted, and an intense sense of unease rose within his heart.

“This Long Chen is a monster. I must help Shaoqing!”

All of a sudden, Cao Guofeng sat down, and the surrounding experts of the Iron Blood Gate used their bodies to shield him. While everyone’s attention was on the martial stage, Cao Guofeng started to stealthily form hand seals.

Looking gloomy, Cao Shaoqing declared, “That was just a probing blow. You’re getting happy too early.”

“Yes, you’re entirely right. I am really happy at the moment. Fine, I’ll take out my weapon as well,” replied Long Chen with a faint smile. He then extended his hand.

When the pitch-black Dragonbone Evilmoon appeared in Long Chen’s hand, its frightening appearance and aura scared the hell out of the spectators.

“Heavens, what a sinister weapon! Its evil energy is even denser than that of the Ten Thousand Blood Flag!”

Although the spectators didn’t know the origins of Evilmoon, just based on its aura, they could tell that Evilmoon was an extremely terrifying weapon made for slaughter.

“What are you doing? I already told you that I’m in seclusion and not to bother me for nothin—Oh?” Evilmoon immediately cursed Long Chen, but when it saw the Ten Thousand Blood Flag, it instantly grew excited. “Damn, that’s a good meal! Long Chen, you’re not bad!”

Cursing me and then suddenly praising me... what a temperamental partner. Long Chen had the urge to throw Evilmoon away.

In a bitter tone, Long Chen said, “I felt that this weapon would be useful to you, which is why I called you out. Otherwise, the astral bone claw would have been enough to deal with it. But if you’re going to curse me for doing you a favor, I’m not going to tell you if I find something good next time.”

“No, no, I was just cranky because you woke me up so suddenly. I’m good now. Ah, is there a need for such pettiness between us? Can’t you even take a joke?” teased Evilmoon, its mood excellent.

Not being that angry, Long Chen replied, “That Ten Thousand Blood Flag is related to the old fellow up there. If we want to grab it, we’ll only have one chance. That fellow will take it away if we fail. Just look at him hiding behind his followers. He’s definitely planning something. Do you have any way to deal with it?”

“Hehe, no problem. I’m confident in succeeding in one go. As long as I can devour this flag, my power will increase, and then I’ll be able to refine the Emperor Blood Silk Net’s power as well,” remarked Evilmoon.

“Tell me what you’re planning,” said Long Chen. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Just as Long Chen and Evilmoon were conversing, the spectators thought that Long Chen was lost in thought, perhaps thinking about how to deal with the Ten Thousand Blood Flag. At this moment, Cao Shaoqing started walking over to him.

Each of his steps felt like a mountain smashing into the martial stage. Furthermore, the runes on the flag started to light up one by one, looking like a mighty beast awakening from a slumber.

Suddenly, Long Chen raised Evilmoon, pointing it at Cao Shaoqing. He sneered, “Are you trying to imitate me? Unfortunately, Boss Long San has been imitated by countless people, but never surpassed. If you like to imitate me, I’ll give you one chance.”

Long Chen assumed a half-squat position and drove Evilmoon into the ground.

To everyone’s surprise, Evilmoon really pierced the ground, shocking even the city lord Xing Wujiang.

“How can that be? He broke the stage just like that?!”

“The stage is made of Heaven Saint devil bones! Even a Heaven Saint divine weapon would have a hard time damaging it if it wasn’t wielded by a genuine Heaven Saint!”

Everyone was shocked to see Evilmoon piercing the martial stage. However, in just a moment, they saw an even more shocking scene.

BOOM!

When one of the Split the Heavens runes on Evilmoon lit up, cracks started to spread across the martial stage, emanating outward from Evilmoon.
