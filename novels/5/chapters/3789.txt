Chapter 3778: Dealing With the Present Predicament

Long Chen was delighted to hear the dragon expert’s voice, but he was a bit disappointed by what it said.

“You’re saying that I’ll die fighting Kun Tu?” Long Chen couldn’t believe his ears. Although he wasn’t unbeatable, he was confident that he could beat anyone in the same realm.

That was not conceit but confidence that came from winning through endless fights and struggles. For the dragon expert to say that Long Chen would die fighting Kun Tu, his competitive spirit was instantly ignited.

“If I say yes, will you immediately throw your life away to beat him?” asked the dragon expert.

“I don’t believe that I’ll lose to him,” said Long Chen, eyeing the distant Kun Tu.

“If you were to fight him, you would be evenly matched. Who lives and who dies would be up to fate. But as time passes, he is absorbing the essence blood here, stimulating his physical body. His power is continuously climbing. As for you? What have you obtained?” asked the dragon expert.

“I…”

Long Chen was shocked to find that when the lightning entered his body, there was no noticeable improvement in his strength.

At the start, he had assumed that it was due to the difficulty in the tribulation being too low. Hence, he had assumed that there would be a better effect later. However, it seemed that the dragon expert was saying that there was a problem.

“In your past tribulations, although the heavenly tribulations wanted to kill you, you would still get some benefits. That is a law of the heavenly tribulation that cannot be changed. Even my dragon race’s heavenly tribulations or the Kunpeng race’s tribulations bring benefits to the one undergoing tribulation. But your current tribulation is different. It is not benefiting you. Your heavenly tribulation has completely changed into pure destruction without nourishment. The moment you said that you would topple this world and create your own world, it was set that your heavenly tribulations would no longer bring you any benefits. The heavenly tribulation will only seek to kill you,” said the dragon expert.

“I don’t understand. I’ve said similar things before, but the heavenly tribulations never changed. Why is it different now?” asked Long Chen, his head buzzing.

“That was because, in the past, you didn’t have the necessary power, so the heavenly tribulation ignored your words. But now, you are infected by too much karma. You have started to gain the power to defy the heavens, and the heavenly tribulation is afraid of you. Even if you manage to pass this tribulation, you will at most find that your realm has broken through. But unlike before, you will not be able to use the thunderforce to temper your body and have it go through a complete transformation. Others will advance by leaps and bounds, while you will be stuck where you are. Now, do you accept what I said about you dying to that Kunpeng brat?” asked the dragon expert.

Long Chen’s heart sank. If this was true, if he couldn’t benefit from the heavenly tribulation, it wouldn’t be long before he died to a heavenly tribulation.

“My dragon race, Kunpeng race, and some other mixed-race experts possess the will to defy the heavens. We live and defy the heavens in order to break through the restrictions of the laws and rules of the world, allowing us to be free. Although our heavenly tribulations are terrifying, with a high chance of death, we will always be transformed if we pass the tribulation. Our power will grow explosively. It is different for you now. You do not wish to be free or be above the law. No, you wish to destroy it. You want to create your own laws. The current you is a kill-on-sight existence to the heavenly tribulation. It will use any means necessary to kill you. It is due to this that the Kunpeng race’s tribulation was devoured by your tribulation, and why even the skeletons of the demonic beast race were used by the heavenly tribulation. Moreover, this is just the start. An even more terrifying tribulation is oncoming. Although your lightning spirit will benefit immensely, no matter how great her power grows, it is not your power. That is why you have to think of a way to benefit from this as well,” said the dragon expert.

“Then many thanks, senior.” Long Chen hadn’t expected things to progress to this point. The heavenly tribulation was no longer letting him grow, but Kun Tu was advancing rapidly within it. Just like that, it was definite that Long Chen wouldn’t be a match for Kun Tu in the future.

After all, without advancing to the Immortal King realm, he wouldn’t dare to summon the Seven Star Battle Armor. The Seven Star Battle Armor was so powerful that he was afraid his body wouldn’t be able to endure it.

Originally, he was hoping for his physical body to be upgraded through this tribulation. That would be the foundation for condensing the Seven Star Battle armor. But this sudden change made him panic.

“I don’t know if this will work, but your current crisis must be dealt with. I will transmit the Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth divine ability,” said the dragon expert.

“I already know it.” Long Chen suddenly thought of this technique. Dragonbone Evilmoon had taught it to him.

“That’s nothing more than a superficial version. The true Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth does not require swallowing the target into the stomach. Don’t argue. There’s almost no more time,” said the dragon expert a bit anxiously.

Long Chen hastily focused on listening. After that, dragon scales suddenly covered his hands, and he formed hand seals. As he did so, golden mist floated out of his body, transforming into a giant dragon behind him. It was a five-clawed golden dragon. When it slowly opened its mouth, heaven and earth collapsed into a giant vortex.

As a result, the explosive power of heaven and earth was devoured by the dragon mouth like a whale inhaling water.

The golden dragon swallowed the heavens and devoured the earth. Meanwhile, Long Chen’s body began to crackle as endless energy poured into him. It felt like his body would explode.

This energy was extremely chaotic. There was thunderforce, essence blood energy, blood soul energy, as well as various runes and fragments. They were all absorbed into his body. It felt like a landslide was rolling inside his body. This explosive power then poured through his limbs and bones. His skin began to bulge as the power boiled.

“Senior, will this really work? This energy is polluting my dragon blood!” exclaimed Long Chen.

“At this time, such a thing can’t be bothered with. Staying alive is more important. As for those impurities, it should… In a bit, you’ll understand.”

Intense pain wracked Long Chen’s body. These violent powers were not nourishing his body. It was as if they were trying to destroy him.

Long Chen hastily circulated his true dragon essence blood, absorbing those mixed energies and expelling the damaging portion.

“How foolish! Pure essence blood is being ruined by you! Long Chen, I overestimated you! You’re an idiot!” When Kun Tu saw Long Chen absorbing the energy of heaven and earth, Kun Tu’s expression sank.

Although he looked down on Long Chen, he was very interested in Long Chen’s true dragon essence blood. In this world, the only thing worthy of him devouring it was true dragon essence blood.

However, by absorbing all of these energies, Long Chen was mixing the true dragon essence blood with the aura of the billion Beast Venerates. As a result, the true dragon essence blood would be contaminated, and Kun Tu could no longer devour it.

Kun Tu possessed the purest Kunpeng bloodline, so he naturally wouldn’t devour other bloodlines. He was only absorbing the thunderforce and constantly strengthening his physical body. Thus, seeing Long Chen absorb all these mixed bloodlines, he was shocked, enraged, and aggrieved. He had long since viewed Long Chen’s essence blood as his treasure.

Suddenly, explosive sounds came from Long Chen’s body. Violent Blood Qi energy soared like raging lava and nourished his body. After that, his physical body rapidly grew stronger, and his aura shook the void. The pressure that he gave off grew increasingly terrifying, causing everyone to jump in shock.

Suddenly, the immemorial demonic beasts roared in unison. Their withered eyes suddenly lit up with a strange light. Despite being nothing more than skeletons, they seemed to have been bestowed with spirits.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Long Chen, return my life!”

Suddenly, one of those immemorial demonic beasts spoke and charged at Long Chen, its sharp claws tearing through the void. An overwhelming resentful air came from it.
