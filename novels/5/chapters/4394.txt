“Palace master!”

Long Chen quickly rushed to the palace master’s residence and found that the palace master was in the midst of packing, gathering all the things he needed for cultivation. He had practically emptied his room.

Seeing Long Chen, the palace master simply nodded at him. “You’re back. I thought that you would keep wasting time on those senseless idiots. Good, I won’t need to push you. Hurry and gather your stuff. We have to go. You won’t have time to heal from your wounds.”

“What happened? Why are we in such a rush?” Long Chen couldn’t help but ask.

“I’m not sure about the details, but it seems to be related to your generation. I heard that eighteen world gates have opened on that side. Things will get very chaotic soon.”

Long Chen jumped in shock. “Eighteen world gates?!”

Long Chen had never really thought of the main academy ever since leaving the Darklight Heaven. Hence, it never occurred to him that, while the Nirvana Overflow Heaven had two world gates, the Darklight Heaven would have eighteen. Just what kind of chaos was undergoing in the Darklight Heaven?

At the same time, he had a thought. He had gone from the Darklight Heaven, to the Violet Flame Heaven, and then the Nirvana Overflow Heaven; each location grew progressively more powerful. Previously, he hadn’t been able to understand how an unfathomable existence like the High Firmament Academy would have its main academy in the Darklight Heaven instead of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. However, now he felt like he had grasped something.

Long Chen had assumed that the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was the core of the nine heavens, but it seemed like he had been thinking too simply. Some aspects were not as straightforward as they initially seemed.

“Palace master, if you leave, what about that red-haired monster? If it tries to get revenge in your absence, no one will be able to stop it,” said Long Chen.

“Don’t worry. Both it and the Red Fur Heaven Roarer have lost their heads. It will take them years to recover. Moreover, our departure is a well-kept secret, and even if they were to find out, it wouldn't make a difference. I’m not the only one in the academy who can take his life,” said the palace master with a slight smile.

Long Chen was taken aback. There were even more formidable experts within the academy, and he had been entirely unaware of their presence?

“Hurry and gather your things. We have to leave. The order came directly from the sweeping elder, so don’t tarry,” ordered the palace master.

From the way the palace master spoke, he felt utmost reverence for the mysterious sweeping elder. Despite his usual cold and indifferent demeanor toward others, he didn’t dare to show the slightest hint of disrespect toward the sweeping elder.

Hearing that everyone here would be fine, Long Chen was at ease. No longer asking questions, he hurried back to gather everyone.

Each Dragonblood warrior had their designated room in the academy, filled with the items essential for their cultivation. Now, these belongings needed to be packed.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen, in particular, possessed the most intricate and numerous treasures. Moreover, they couldn't let others help them, as it would likely result in chaos. As a result, they were in a frenzied rush to pack their things.

Fortunately, the moment Long Chen received word that something was happening in the main academy, he already told them to prepare. Hence, by the time he came back from the palace master’s residence, everyone had mostly finished packing up.

When the palace master arrived, the Dragonblood Legion had already assembled. As his gaze swept over the Dragonblood warriors, a hint of admiration appeared on his face.

His admiration wasn’t for their efficiency or their uniformity. Rather, it stemmed from the fact that, even after facing an immense life-and-death battle, with weariness hanging on their faces and wounds all over their bodies, all Dragonblood warriors still had sharp glints in their eyes.

Even in a weakened state, their fighting spirit remained unshaken. It was as if the instinct to fight had been etched into the very depths of their souls. As long as they still drew breath, they would never give up fighting.

They followed the palace master down a secret passageway and arrived in the depths of the academy. There was a grand transportation formation on top of the foundation stone.

When everyone stood on top of it, the palace master activated the formation. Following that, the foundation stone slowly lit up. However, even after waiting for a while, no one felt anything. They couldn’t help looking at each other.

“This is a transportation formation for crossing heavens, and it needs some time to activate. At the very least, it will only react two hours from now. Just wait,” said the palace master.

Hearing his words, everyone slowly relaxed their tense nerves. Since the formation wouldn’t activate soon, they started recuperating here.

“Palace master, what does this formation use to transport people across heavens?” asked Xia Chen curiously. He had yet to see any formations capable of crossing heavens like this.

“It uses karmic luck,” responded the palace master.

Everyone’s hearts shook. The notion of using something as intangible as karmic luck as a form of energy was entirely new to them.

“Palace master, I have a question for you, but don’t get angry,” said Long Chen suddenly.

The palace master was taken aback by this. “Go ahead.”

“Many people claim that you dislike talking, but I don't sense that you're as the rumors describe,” Long Chen remarked.

Hearing this sudden question, Bai Shishi glared at Long Chen. How could he randomly joke around with someone as serious as the palace master?

Acting like he didn’t notice Bai Shishi’s gaze, Long Chen finished his question, enraging her.

The palace master couldn’t help but laugh. “Who told you that I don’t like talking? Oh, it must have been that fool Bai Zhantang.”

Hearing the palace master call Bai Zhantang a fool, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole were embarrassed, but they didn’t dare to retort. After all, their father was the vice palace master, so the palace master was qualified to speak about him like this.

“Talking to that fellow is like playing the zither for a cow. That’s why I can’t be bothered to speak to him. Perhaps that led him to believe I don’t like talking. In truth, I rarely speak because others can’t understand me. There’s nothing to discuss between a chicken and a duck. However, in all of you, I see a reflection of my younger self and my hot-blooded brothers. It reminds me of the time when we all fought side by side,” the palace master sighed.

“Where are your brothers?” asked Guo Ran frankly. As soon as he started asking, Long Chen already had a bad feeling. Nevertheless, this fellow spoke too quickly, and Long Chen couldn’t stop him in time.

As expected, a flash of pain appeared in the palace master’s eyes. “They’re all dead, and I am the only one left. If it weren’t for the sweeping elder, I’d have long since joined my brothers as well.”

Long Chen had anticipated this outcome the moment Guo Ran spoke. Given the palace master's reclusive nature, it was quite obvious that he had gone through such an experience.

However, what Long Chen hadn’t expected was that the sweeping elder had actually saved the palace master. This revelation shed light on the deep reverence the palace master held for the sweeping elder.

This reply made the atmosphere tense back up. Guo Ran felt awkward, hating himself for not considering the implications beforehand.

In an attempt to shift the focus, Long Chen hurriedly changed the subject. "Palace master, was that red-haired monster an Eternal expert, or someone beyond the Eternal realm?"

This question instantly made everyone’s ears perk up.
