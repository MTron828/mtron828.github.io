Chapter 3257 Precious Sword Given to a Beauty

Long Chen’s wound was rotting the flesh around it. He then sliced off those parts, and new flesh quickly grew out, only to rot as well.

“Boss, what were you struck by?” asked Qin Feng in shock.

It had to be known that Qin Feng was very familiar with how amazing Long Chen’s regeneration ability was. Any wound could almost be instantly healed, so he had never seen such a thing occur to Long Chen.

“I misjudged. That fellow was an expert of the Sword Dao, and this is the result of him raising a single finger and unleashing Sword Qi through it. Fortunately, I dodged quickly and used my lightning blade to block it, deflecting most of the Sword Qi. Otherwise, half my body would be gone right now,” said Long Chen.

The instant that lifeform’s eyes opened, Long Chen felt an intense sensation of danger well up within his heart. Hence, he instantly fled and condensed a lightning blade, slashing it down in advance.

This was one of the moves that Luo Zichuan had taught him. Through Heavenly Dao energy, he grasped and cut off the orbit of his opponent’s attack.

However, that person was too powerful. A single flick of Sword Qi was enough to pierce Long Chen’s lightning blade and strike his shoulder.

The lightning blade had blocked most of it, but this Sword Qi still contained a powerful rotting effect that enveloped Long Chen’s wound with some strange law. That was why his new flesh was also rotting.

If he ignored it, his entire body would rot. This was a very terrifying ability.

Fortunately, the one to be struck was Long Chen. Anyone else would lose their life from the slightest prick.

Long Chen cut off his rotting flesh over ten times before the color of his new flesh gradually became normal. As that strange law was exhausted, the wound finally recovered.

“What kind of existence was that?” asked Qi Yu, feeling quite frightened. This was all too bizarre.

“They are not alive, but they aren’t lifeforms of the Netherworld either. Also, they are not like the death spirits we encountered on the Martial Heaven Continent. On the surface, they appear to be the same, but they actually are different. I can’t really say for sure what they are. But in any case, we’ve gained experience today. And it’s not like we lose out.” Long Chen smiled and showed off the sword in his hand with a pleased expression.

This sword’s entire body was golden, and there were ancient designs carved into it. They looked like written characters, but Long Chen didn’t recognize a single one.

The sword was heavy in his hand. Moreover, there was a halo of light flowing around it like it was alive. It was a divine weapon possessing immense spirituality.

“Pretty girl, your luck isn’t bad. This is a weapon made for you.” Long Chen smiled and handed the sword to Bai Shishi.

Hearing this, Bai Shishi was surprised and her expression grew a bit unnatural. “This is something you risked your life for. What are you giving it to me for?”

“Because you’re pretty!” declared Long Chen.

Bai Shishi glared at him, but the moment she saw this sword, she fell for it. She even felt a kind of summons. Her metal energy grew exceptionally active just from looking at it.

However, this was something that Long Chen had obtained after risking his life. So, she wanted it but also couldn’t accept it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Just take it. There’s no need to repay me with your heart. Just remember that you owe me a favor. If you obtain a treasure that I can use, you can simply give it to me,” said Long Chen, forcing her to take it.

“Those are the words I expected from a scoundrel like you.” Bai Shishi snorted but still received the golden sword.

When she touched it, the runes on the hilt and scabbard lit up. Golden runes then flowed around Bai Shishi’s entire body. A sharp aura forced back everyone else.

“A divine weapon accepting a master. This sword really is fated for fairy Shishi,” said Qin Feng enviously.

Bai Shishi’s entire body was surrounded by revolving runes, and the runes in her body resonated with them. At this moment, the golden light made her appear like a golden goddess, beautiful and sacred.

A golden mark gradually appeared in her eyes. It was something that also appeared on the sword.

“It really accepted her as its master?”

Long Chen was also envious. This sword’s aura was concealed, making it impossible for him to judge what level of weapon it was. But based on how tightly that terrifying expert had been holding onto it, it was definitely a peerless treasure.

The quality of this divine weapon definitely wasn’t inferior to his King item pill furnace. Furthermore, his pill furnace couldn’t even be used yet as the Demon Moon Furnace’s item-spirit had yet to awaken.

However, this sword had instantly accepted Bai Shishi as a master. This kind of luck was naturally something that he was jealous of. Jealousy was a vicious thing. Could it be that divine weapons also chose masters based on looks?

Holding the sword, Bai Shishi couldn’t help unsheathing it. With a light sound like a phoenix cry, despite only unsheathing a single inch of the blade, golden light erupted, blinding Long Chen and the others. It was as if a sun had suddenly appeared.

Crackling sounds rang out, and then there was an explosion. Bai Shishi hastily sheathed the sword back. When the light faded, the flying boat that they were on exploded, along with Qin Feng’s belt, Qi Yu’s arm bracers, and Xu Zixiong’s metal wristbands. Anything metallic simply exploded.

“Sorry…” Bai Shishi hastily apologized.

She hadn’t expected this sword to be so domineering. Just pulling out the slightest bit of it caused everything metallic to explode. That was absolutely terrifying.

It was as if it refused to coexist with ordinary metal. Its very presence caused them to explode.

“Good thing I put away my weapon first…”

Qin Feng and the others were shaken. At this close distance, perhaps even Treasure items would have been destroyed.

“Shishi, I feel like you’re still too young, too impetuous. I apologize for this, but I feel like you should return this precious sword to me,” said Long Chen with the expression of a mistaken elder.

“Nice try! Even if you give me your life, I won’t give you this sword.” Bai Shishi naturally knew that Long Chen was messing around. With his pride, how could he accept something that he had given away? Bai Shishi smiled happily. Bai Xiaole had never seen her so happy.

“You don’t have to give it, but my boss is lacking a bed warmer- aiya!” Bai Xiaole wasn’t even done speaking before he was kicked by Bai Shishi.

Bai Shishi held the sword fondly. Seeing her so happy, Long Chen was in a good mood. Although he couldn’t use it himself, equipping his allies was always good.

“Boss, while you were taking the sword, Qi Yu and I got some of the rust. Take a look. Is it useful?”

Qin Feng carefully took out a beast hide. Inside was a pile of rust.

Staring at this rust, Bai Shishi didn’t know whether to cry or laugh. As expected of Long Chen’s followers. It really was a case of bandits never returning empty-handed.

“Of course it’s useful! Good job! You have never disappointed me.” Long Chen chuckled. “This rust is infected by the power of time, so it possesses a terrifying law involving decay. If you made arrows with them, Divine Lords would instantly lose their lives when shot. Even Immortal Kings would have trouble with them. I was planning on gathering some myself, but I didn’t expect that fellow to be so terrifying. Well done.”

Bai Shishi took out a new flying boat, and they once more sped off with the Deep Sea Devil Shark.
