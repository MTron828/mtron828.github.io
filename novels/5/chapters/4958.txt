“Who are you?!” roared Huanghui.

Crack.

Suddenly, Huanghui’s broadsword snapped. With a flash of cold light, his arm flew into the air along with his blood.

Long Chen was so fast that no one saw him move clearly. At this moment, the snapped sword was already pointing at Huanghui’s throat. “I don’t like long-winded people. Answer my question. Next time you fail to do so, I’ll cut off your head.”

Huanghui was finally afraid. With a quivering voice, he answered, “He… he… he is called Saint Emperor Zhantian by the mercenaries, but he is the new Heavenly Saint of the Long clan: Long Zhantian, one of the four Heavenly Saints.”

Long Chen smiled. As expected, Saint Emperor Zhantian was his father. It seemed that he had gained a new title for himself.

“Shit!” Yu Ying cried out, and Long Chen turned to her.

“Qi Hua is gone!” said Yu Ying worriedly.

Qi Hua was the monkey-faced fellow. He had silently run off without any of them realizing it.

“He definitely went to report this. Long Chen, you have to run,” urged Fang Liude. Long Chen might be powerful, but if Qi Hua went to report this matter, the real experts of the Long clan would definitely come.

“Now you know how to be afraid? Shouldn’t you hurry up and let me go?” Huanghui instantly became fearless again at their panicked expressions.

Long Chen looked at Huanghui disdainfully. After that, Long Chen smiled and looked at Yu Ying. “Big Sister Yu Ying, do you still remember what I told you?”

Yu Ying was too nervous to recall what Long Chen had said. “I…”

Long Chen smiled. “I said that the strong always face people stronger than them, and evil people are also dealt with by more evil people. Sooner or later, they’ll kick a tough nail. If their luck is bad, they’ll be forced to reincarnate, and I don’t believe they’ll be lucky enough to reincarnate somewhere good again.”

“Yes, I remember you saying that,” answered Yu Ying hastily.

Long Chen continued, “Personally, I don’t have any strong points. I just like to help others. I actually specialize in sending others on the path of reincarnation, and now the chance has come.”

Long Chen smiled, but his words didn’t bring a smile to Huanghui’s face. Huang Hui threatened, “You dare to kill me?!”

Long Chen laughed. Just how stupid was this brat to be to ask such a thing?

Just then, rumbling rang out, and multiple golden war chariots arrived.

Seeing this, Huanghui knew his reinforcements had come, so he became fearless. “Hahaha!”

Suddenly, Huanghui’s head soared into the sky, his laughter abruptly cut off. The smile on his face froze in place.

“Your laughter is unpleasant,” remarked Long Chen. He disdainfully tossed the sword fragment in his hand to the ground.

All the people around Long Chen shook. Long Chen had actually killed Huanghui in front of all of them.

At this time, Fang Liude gave everyone a signal, and their small group immediately drew over to Long Chen.

With a smile, Long Chen said, “Brother Liu, there’s no need to be nervous. I can deal with them.”

Although Long Chen didn’t know what the signal was, from the way they were positioning themselves, he could tell they wanted to create a chance for him to escape.

Long Chen then turned to Yu Ying and Brother Song, winking at them. He said, “About that, remember to keep my secret.”

The two of them were baffled for a moment. Luckily, Yu Ying was a bit more clever and understood that Long Chen was asking them to keep quiet about seeing him crying.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At first, Yu Ying had thought Long Chen to be an expelled young master of a noble clan. She hadn’t expected him to be so terrifyingly powerful.

“You dare to kill the Long clan’s disciples? I’ll tear off your skin and grind your bones to dust!” A furious roar echoed, shaking the land. A group of people swiftly emerged from chariots, led by an individual whose head was at an odd angle. His Blood Qi emitted a formidable pressure, indicating his status as a nine star Doyen.

Upon seeing a nine star Doyen, Fang Liude and the others relaxed rather than tensed up. Their final hope was extinguished. There was no longer any pressure on them, as there was nothing they could possibly do against someone of this caliber.

Long Chen looked at the leader whose head was askew, pausing with a frown. Why did this fellow look a bit familiar?

The leader led dozens of the Long clan’s experts over, their killing intent evident. However, as he approached Long Chen, he suddenly stiffened, his eyes nearly bulging out of their sockets.

His jaw dropped, and even his tongue seemed tied. He stuttered, “L-Long… Long… Long Chen…”

Witnessing this powerful expert suddenly go pale and begin to quiver in front of Long Chen, with beads of sweat forming on his forehead, Fang Liude and the others were utterly flabbergasted.

Here stood a nine star Doyen, yet in the presence of Long Chen, he appeared as if he had encountered a Yama King. His terror was so palpable that it seemed he was on the verge of collapse.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen… I… I hope you’re well!” That expert squeezed out a smile.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Long Chen still couldn’t recall where he met this person before.

“No, no!” That expert almost jumped out of his own skin. He hastily said, “I’m not staring at you oddly on purpose. My head is just like this. I used to have two heads.”

He pulled back his collar, revealing a large scar on the other side of his neck. Suddenly, Long Chen realized where he knew this guy from.

“You remember now? On the pathway to the ninth heaven, I was deceived by the Celestial race and acted incredibly foolishly. You cut off my head as a warning. Even after so much time has passed, I can’t believe I never thanked you for that. I’m truly sorry. Now I can make up for it. Thank you for not killing me then.” This expert actually bowed to Long Chen.

This fellow had previously attacked Long Chen on the pathway to the ninth heaven, and Long Chen had directly crushed one of his two heads.

Actually, the idea that Long Chen had shown mercy at that time was nonsense. There had simply been too many people in his way, and he simply couldn’t finish them all.

Fang Liude and the others were growing increasingly baffled. Long Chen had crushed the head of a nine star Doyen before? It was no wonder this person was so terrified. They felt like they were dreaming. What was such a terrifying figure doing by their side?

“But your temper doesn’t seem to have improved much. Just now, I feel like I heard someone say that they would tear off my skin and grind my bones to dust. Is that so?” Long Chen frowned.

That person furiously looked behind him and cursed, “Who said that?! Who?! Get out here and kill yourself!”

His followers looked at each other, naturally not daring to say a word. It seemed that this fellow had a certain status amongst them.

“As you can see, no one said such a thing. Maybe you misheard…” Suddenly, his expression changed, and he hastily corrected himself, “No, that’s definitely wrong. You couldn’t possibly have misheard! Someone definitely said it! When I get back, I’ll properly investigate and teach them a lesson!”

Long Chen nodded. Seeing Long Chen nod, that person sighed with relief. At least, his remaining head wouldn’t leave his body just yet.

Long Chen looked into the distance and saw a figure fleeing rapidly. He then said, “Go grab that troublemaker for me.”
