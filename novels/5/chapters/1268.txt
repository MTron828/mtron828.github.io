Chapter 1269 The Amazing Pot Dominates

Translator: BornToBe

A golden fist collided with the green fist. Powerful qi waves erupted in every direction.

The surrounding creatures were blown back by the qi waves, and a few of the weaker ones were directly killed.

This incredible power was so great that even Bao Buping and Chang Hao had to stab Sword Qi into the depths of the earth to avoid being blown away. Yet, they still coughed up blood. They were injured by their clashing power.

The two of them couldn’t help being shocked. They hadn’t expected this golden creature to be so terrifying.

But fortunately, Long Chen was able to fight on even ground against it. They saw their fists still intertwined. Countless ripples were erupting from their fists, soaring like waves clashing against heaven and earth.

Clearly, the two of them were constantly increasing their power. With his hair fluttering in the wind, Long Chen looked like a god as he faced that golden creature.

The thing that made Bao Buping and Chang Hao uneasy was that the formation just tens of miles away did not shatter after enduring this immense power. It merely quivered ever so slightly.

Such immense power was unable to damage the formation. Was it really possible for them to break out of it? A bad feeling rose in their hearts. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If they couldn’t break the formation, the three of them would die here. Just death was one thing, but they would probably end up being used, turning into those corpses in the pit. Furthermore, all their efforts would have been useless.

But now that things had reached this point, their worry had no use. All they could do was place their hopes on Long Chen. They focused themselves, ready to attack at any moment.

The golden creature’s sneer of disdain had already vanished, replaced with an expression of shock. It couldn’t believe Long Chen was this powerful.

“Inferior human race, how can you possess such power?” The golden creature icily looked at Long Chen as it spoke, but it continued to increase its power.

This time, Bao Buping and Chang Hao clearly saw that this creature wasn’t actually speaking the human language. When it opened its mouth, it was able to unleash spiritual fluctuations that expressed its meaning, making it seem like it was speaking their language.

“Who do you think you are to look down on the human race? Is the winged devil race so amazing?” sneered Long Chen.

The golden creature’s expression suddenly changed. “How do you know of the winged devil race?”

Long Chen hadn’t expected this little test to actually reveal such a secret. So these creatures really were part of the winged devil race. But the previous winged devils he had seen were huge. How were these ones so small?

“Idiot, how could I not know? I also know you are nothing more than a brat of the winged devil race. The pure-blooded winged devils are far stronger than you,” sneered Long Chen.

Although he put on a disdainful expression, he was actually carefully paying attention to this winged devil’s countenance. When he spoke, he clearly saw its pupils shrink slightly. It was shocked by his words.

Then this meant that this golden creature was likely just a branch of the winged devil race, or perhaps the winged devil race’s descendants.

Based on its reactions, the skeletons of the winged devils he had seen in the deep abyss of the Jiuli secret realm should be the ancestors of this world’s creatures.

As for the Barbarian race expert, in order to slay those winged devils, he had sacrificed his own life. That must have been something related to a war waged in a time far more ancient than the dark era.

If these creatures were descendants of the winged devils, then didn’t that mean the battle in the dark era was related to that previous battle? Yue Xiaoqian had said that the so-called Motherstar had collapsed, and the Barbarian race had been exterminated. Just what were the causes and consequences of all this?

“Die!”

Just as Long Chen was rapidly thinking, the golden creature let out a furious roar, and a ray of light shot out of its forehead and at Long Chen.

Long Chen was startled, suddenly recalling that the winged devils condensed their cultivation base in the devil core located at their foreheads.

At such a close distance, there was no time for him to dodge. If struck, his head would definitely explode. Bao Buping and Chang Hao’s expressions changed. They hadn’t expected the golden creature to have such a terrifying attack.

Just at this moment, a refined medicinal cauldron appeared in front of Long Chen’s head, smashing into the light.

This was the Ancestral item, the Blazing Dragon Cauldron. After obtaining it from Dan Chu’s hands, Long Chen had been nourishing it in his mind-sea the entire time. He had used it to refine pills a few times, but after arriving in the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, he had almost forgotten about it.

He hadn’t placed a slave mark on the Blazing Dragon Cauldron. It could move on its own, and seeing Long Chen in danger, it actually took its own action to protect him.

The light was blown apart, while the Blazing Dragon Cauldron charged at the golden creature.

The golden creature jumped in shock. It had absolute confidence in its divine ability. It was confident in using it to kill Long Chen.

But instead, this powerful cauldron appeared and suddenly attacked. Its intuition told it that if struck, its head would definitely explode.

The golden creature’s wings shook, and golden runes lit up around its body. It transformed into a ray of light that shot back at incomparable speed, just narrowly dodging the Blazing Dragon Cauldron’s attack.

“In terms of power, you’re far too weak. Does the inferior winged devil race only have this little ability?” sneered Long Chen. He held one of the feet of the Blazing Dragon Cauldron and smashed it at the golden creature.

There was no way for him to truly control an Ancestral item. As for the Blazing Dragon Cauldron, it hadn’t recovered yet. Unless it had no choice, it wouldn’t want to use its power either. But with Long Chen’s power, a smash from the cauldron wasn’t something just anyone could endure.

“Inferior human race, you dare blaspheme the grand winged devil race?!” The golden creature let out a furious roar and charged Long Chen.

Now Long Chen and the golden creature began a fierce fight in the air, and seeing that they had distanced themselves, the other creatures charged at Bao Buping and Chang Hao.

“Fuck, do you think I’m a pushover?!” raged Bao Buping and Chang Hao. Raising their swords, they started a fierce slaughter. The creatures were slain one by one.

But there were too many of them, and more and more were joining in. Right now, their numbers surpassed twenty thousand. However, no matter how many there were, the number of them that could attack at one time was limited. At any moment, Bao Buping and Chang Hao were only fighting a few dozen of them. There was no danger to their lives for now.

Up in the air, seeing the golden creature charging at him, Long Chen suddenly threw the Blazing Dragon Cauldron at it.

“Fuck off!” The golden creature snorted and its wings lit up once more as it prepared to dodge.

As a result, the Blazing Dragon Cauldron suddenly grew in size, going from one meter to three thousand meters. It was now a mountain, dumbfounding the golden creature. It was too huge and instantly sealed all his possible dodging paths.

BOOM!

The golden creature felt like a shooting star had smashed into it. It shot to the ground, smashing apart its fellow creatures that it touched.

The golden creature vomited up blood, but unexpectedly, its black blood contained some golden color to it.

“It’s forbidden to crap here!” shouted Long Chen as he once more smashed the Blazing Dragon Cauldron at the golden creature.

The golden creature’s hair stood on end from fury, flames almost spurting from its eyes. Its sharp teeth were creaking.

“All the human race knows how to do is rely on outside power. You’re the most shameless race!” The golden creature suddenly grabbed its forehead and pulled. That appearance was like it was trying to tear its head in two.

Suddenly, a black bone appeared outside the golden creature’s forehead. That was its crystal core. A black arrow then shot out of it.

As soon as that black arrow appeared, Long Chen felt a chill. He even sensed the Blazing Dragon Cauldron’s fear.

“There’s definitely something up with that black arrow!” Long Chen’s heart shook. This black arrow contained a corrosive aura. For the Blazing Dragon Cauldron to also be afraid of it, it was clearly bizarre. This black arrow made him think of the Yama King Blood Curse that the Corrupt path’s expert, Xue You, had used on him in the Immemorial Path.

The black arrow also seemed to contain a kind of curse energy. This kind of thing posed a great threat to an item-spirit, which was why the Blazing Dragon Cauldron felt fear.

Long Chen suddenly realized why these creatures didn’t use all the treasures that they gathered. They were probably unable to use them. That was why the golden creature now cursed him for using outside power.

This move was definitely targeting his Ancestral item. Thinking of this, Long Chen knew what he had to do. With a faint smile, he put away the Blazing Dragon Cauldron and took out a certain black object.

“Watch how my amazing pot dominates!” Long Chen smashed the pot into the black arrow.
