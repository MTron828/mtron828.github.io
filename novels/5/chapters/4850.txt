Chapter 4839 The Violet Palace Sect’s Vice Sect Master

A refined, middle-aged man with a long mustache and beard appeared silently right beside them, startling Long Chen and Mo Nian.

This individual was an incredibly powerful Heaven Saint, capable of suppressing his aura to the point where Long Chen and Mo Nian were unable to detect him before his sudden appearance.

The middle-aged man smiled and waved at Lu Ziqiong and her companions before turning his attention to Long Chen and Mo Nian. He respectfully cupped his hands toward them.

“This child Ziqiong doesn’t know how to treat guests. She didn’t inform me of your arrival. I’m sorry for arriving so late here.”

Hearing this, Lu Ziqiong and the others were stunned. This middle-aged man was the head of the Lu family, and the vice sect master of the Violet Palace Sect. Why was he acting so courteously to Long Chen and Mo Nian?

Cupping his fists, Long Chen replied, “Senior is too courteous. When we arrived at Devil Fall City, we just happened to run into Miss Lu. At first, we only wanted to see the martial competition, and I didn’t expect to get drawn into it as well. However, we will remember Miss Lu’s favor. We’re just two roaming adventurers. While we might not be too bright, our vision is quite sharp. We don’t like causing trouble for others.”

When it came to weighing somebody’s words and judging their facial expression, Long Chen could be considered an expert. After all, he had experienced this kind of thing many times.

This vice palace master was definitely a shrewd one, hiding his true thoughts deeply. For him to appear now was definitely no coincidence. In fact, perhaps their initial clash with the Iron Blood Gate was all arranged by him. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Through that one clash, things grew to the point that Lu Ziqiong and Hu Yifei ended up fighting. However, Long Chen couldn't comprehend why a seasoned Heaven Saint like the vice palace master failed to discern Hu Yifei's true strength. Allowing Lu Ziqiong to engage in that battle was akin to sending her to her demise.

Now he appeared casually as if he had nothing to do with it. He clearly did not care about Lu Ziqiong’s well-being, which irritated Long Chen. Thus, he also wasn’t too courteous with his words.

Long Chen’s meaning was clear: he had no relationship with the Lu family. At most, he owed a slight favor to Lu Ziqiong. He refused to be exploited for their own problematic affairs and warned against treating him as a mere tool.

As for not wanting to cause trouble for others, he actually meant the opposite: he was telling them not to cause trouble for him.

The vice sect master laughed. “What trouble? Since you have come from so far away, the Violet Palace Sect will warmly greet you. If you don’t mind, why not rest in our sect? The sect master has prepared a feast, and I came to invite you as guests of honor. You wouldn’t make things hard on me, right?”

Li Ziqiong and the others grew even more shocked when they heard this. Even they couldn’t get to see the sect master so casually, but the sect master had personally prepared a feast for them?

Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a glance, both feeling that this vice palace master was a schemer. Long Chen had stated their intentions so clearly, but he shamelessly acted like he didn’t understand, continuing his invitation.

Both of them definitely couldn’t jump into his trap. Although Long Chen didn’t fear anyone, he didn’t want to be used by others.

Long Chen shook his head. “Junior is grateful for Senior’s invitation. But due to having to fight Cao Shaoqing, I need to find somewhere to rest. The Feather Spirit race has said that they would prepare a feast for us, but we declined. However, they have prepared a place for me to rest, and I can’t possibly refuse. Otherwise, it would be too rude.”

Yu Tong and Yu Fei clearly weren’t used to lying, so they looked at Long Chen in confusion. Fortunately, they weren’t so foolish as to say something that they shouldn’t.

The vice sect master once more laughed. “Aiya, so the Feather Spirit race got to you first! Haha, we have already prepared a feast and resting place for you. We even have weapons and medicinal pills if you require them. But if you’ve already agreed to go to the Feather Spirit race, I won’t force you to come with me. However, whatever you need, just tell Ziqiong and she will tell me. I don’t dare to say anything else, but as long as my Violet Palace Sect has it, we will definitely not refuse.”

After saying that, he turned to Lu Ziqiong and said, “Ziqiong, he is an important guest. He is the youngest dean of the High Firmament Academy. Treat him well, or people would mock our Violet Palace Sect for not knowing how to treat our guests.”

“The High Firmament Academy?”

Although Mo Nian had previously mentioned the world's number one academy, the significance hadn't fully resonated with these individuals at the time. During Lu Ziqiong's battle, their attention had been diverted.

Now hearing the name of the High Firmament Academy, Lu Ziqiong and the others were shocked. The High Firmament Academy had become a legend in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. As native experts, they had never encountered anyone from that place.

However, the name of the oldest academy in the nine heavens and ten lands was well-known, and everyone had to admit that the High Firmament Academy was the number one academy in this regard.

Lu Chengfeng and the others had heard of the High Firmament Academy. However, when they heard Mo Nian mention the world’s number one academy, they hadn’t linked that to the legendary High Firmament Academy. Now, they stared in disbelief at this young man who seemed like he might even be younger than them. He was the dean of the legendary High Firmament Academy?

Long Chen shook his head. “Senior is overpraising me. I’m nothing more than a branch dean. Furthermore, I only gained that position thanks to luck. It’s not worth mentioning.”

“Dean Long Chen is too humble. I’ve heard that the High Firmament Academy has established a foothold in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. You will definitely flourish in the future.”

The vice sect master then looked at Lu Chengfeng and the others. “All of you should learn from Long Chen. He’s even younger than you, but he is many times stronger. Look at his attitude, and then look at your own.”

Lu Chengfeng instantly blushed. Thinking of his previous provocations toward Long Chen, he had the urge to find somewhere to hide.

Previously, Long Chen had said that with his power, he wouldn’t be able to last three moves against him. While Lu Chengfeng hadn’t accepted it back then, now he realized three moves was a huge exaggeration. He knew he wouldn’t be able to last a single move.

Even Lu Ziyu was blushing. Just like Lu Chengfeng, she had looked down on the two of them at first, thinking that her big sister was overestimating them. However, other than embarrassment, she also felt great admiration for her sister’s vision.

“Senior, we...” Long Chen pointed at Yu Tong and Yu Fei.

The vice palace master clapped his forehead. “Oh, my apologies. When a person gets old, they just drone on and on. Please, go do what you need to do. Ignore me. Ziqiong, Ziyu, you can accompany Dean Long Chen. If he needs anything, just tell me.”

Long Chen wanted to refuse, but seeing Lu Ziqiong’s expression, he couldn’t refuse, so they left with two additional members.

Once Long Chen and Mo Nian left, the vice palace master’s smile slowly faded. He then sank into thought, turning and leaving.
