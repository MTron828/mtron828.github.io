Chapter 3332 Shocking Change

“How could I do that? Only you have the power to save me here,” said Long Chen with a smile. He knew that Bai Shishi was a bit angry.

“Quickly absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. I’ll buy you time,” said Bai Shishi. With a single swing of her sword, another terrifying expert was slain by her.

After absorbing the metal lily seed and advancing to the late stage of the Four Peak realm, her metal energy had grown strong enough for her to use the metal sword.

This sword of unknown origin could allow her to unleash the maximum power of her metal energy. With this sword, even Immortal Kings could be slain.

Right now, the human race’s experts also came charging over. A large battle instantly erupted. These dark lifeforms were their mortal enemies, so there was no need to hold back. The Immortal Kings charged in with their disciples.

There was an endless tide of enemy experts. But there also wasn’t a lack of human experts. Hence, rivers of blood flowed.

“Boss, quickly absorb it! We’ll protect you.” Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and Xu Zixiong also arrived, guarding the surroundings.

With Bai Shishi killing the supreme experts, people were too terrified to get close to Long Chen. Adding on Bai Xiaole and the others’ protection, Long Chen could calmly absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

“Don’t fall for it, everyone! Long Chen is an underworld ghost seed! If the Heavenly Rainbow Flame is absorbed by him, it will spell disaster for humanity!” shouted someone amongst the crowd.

When Qi Yu heard this voice, he turned ashen. He clenched his teeth and roared, “Jiang Weizhong, you shameless bastard, are you looking to die?!”

Although Jiang Weizhong had changed his voice and disguised himself, the spiritual fluctuations could not escape Qi Yu. He wanted to find Jiang Weizhong right now and tear him to shreds.

“Who cares if he’s an underworld ghost seed? Only someone with destiny can obtain the world’s natural treasures. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame has yet to accept a master, so everyone still has a chance,” sneered another expert while charging toward the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

The Heavenly Rainbow Flame’s seed had descended from the heavens. It was right above their heads. After no one had claimed it for so long, it had started to bloom and was spreading tentacles.

“Not good!” Long Chen suddenly found that after so long, his rainbow hydrangeas were starting to wither. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame was probably about to use another method to find a master. Then all his previous efforts would be for nothing.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a human expert reached out for the bottom of that rainbow lotus. There was an invisible chain there, and he cut it.

When he cut this chain, Long Chen instantly lost his connection with the Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed, shocking and infuriating him.

This human expert was actually such a sinister fellow. He knew more about the Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed than others and had been hiding this entire time, waiting for this chance.

“Long Chen, it seems that you really are an underworld ghost seed. This Heavenly Rainbow Flame has no destiny with you,” sneered that expert.

Just then, a rainbow lotus mark appeared on this expert’s forehead. He was actually starting to absorb it. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed had chosen him.

“Courting death!”

Long Chen was infuriated. After putting in so much work and risking his life, someone else was planning on reaping his harvest? Furthermore, he even intentionally slandered Long Chen by calling him an underworld ghost seed.

Long Chen’s foot stamped down on the air. He shot past the blockade of countless experts and charged toward that person.

At the same time, all experts attacking Long Chen gave up on him, and their target switched to the Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed. Everyone’s true goal was the Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed.

“Hahaha, it’s useless! I am the one chosen by fate! The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is mine!”

That person laughed and flames suddenly burst out of him. As those flames burned, his body became illusory. Along with the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, he began to fade, as if separated by space and time.

Countless attacks passed right through his body as if he wasn’t within the same spacetime as them.

“Hahaha, I told you it’s useless! The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is mine!” That person laughed arrogantly within the flames. At the same time, he looked toward Long Chen. “What? Do you not like when people call you out as an underworld ghost seed? Have I hit you in your sore spot? Come and bite me then, hahaha!”

“Long Chen, don’t fall for it! He’s just jealous and terrified of you. He’s going to draw you over so that others will kill you!” shouted Bai Shishi.

This person was truly sinister. Long Chen had used up most of his power. If he charged over now, someone might very likely use that chance to kill him.

This person was very pleased. As the flames burned around him, he continued, “My flame contains spatial laws and temporal laws. This is a divine ability passed down in an ancient relic of ancient times. For a short time, even Heaven tier Immortal Kings are unable to touch me. As for you, hahaha, you can only watch me absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. Long Chen, you are fated to be a loser.”

That person continued to provoke Long Chen as if he had some profound enmity with him.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

No matter how others attacked him, whether it was humans or foreign races, they were unable to touch him. They gnashed their teeth furiously.

Long Chen took a deep breath and slammed his palms together. His expression instantly became solemn and serene as he began to chant.

This was the Nirvana Scripture. As it rang throughout the world, the entire world changed color. Countless flame runes then filled every corner of this world. As for the pleased expert, his expression instantly changed.

The flames around him began to merge with those flame runes. His illusory body gradually grew solid.

Just then, seeing that he was no longer protected, dozens of attacks were launched at him. He didn’t even have a chance to scream before being killed without leaving a trace.

Even right before he died, he was unable to comprehend how the divine ability that he was most confident in could be broken by Long Chen’s Nirvana Scripture.

He was a generation’s genius, not at all inferior to Mo Yan and the others. He had waited all the way until this moment. He had also wanted to use this chance to eliminate Long Chen because he was truly afraid of Long Chen. If Long Chen didn’t die, he wouldn’t be able to be at ease. Thus, he repeatedly provoked Long Chen. As a result, his scheming caused his own death.

With his death, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed became a masterless item once more. Countless experts charged toward it.

Just then, right below the rainbow lotus, another giant lotus appeared. When it appeared, it ignited the entire world and wrapped around the rainbow lotus. Seeing it, those experts charging toward the rainbow lotus instantly turned around and fled, with a few reacting slightly slower and being incinerated.

This was Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus. Backed by the Nirvana Scripture, its power wrapped around the Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed. Long Chen then stood within it.

His face was as pale as paper, but he was excited. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed was shrinking until it was only the size of a hand. It slowly fell into his palm.

Just as it was about to fall into his hand, another hand reached out and grabbed it.

Long Chen was enraged. His bone saber was already swinging toward this person. But halfway there, his body suddenly shook and his head buzzed. When he looked at the woman in front of him, his saber fell from his hand. His vision turned blurry, and tears dripped down his face.
