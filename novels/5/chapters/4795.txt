Chapter 4784 Topple Mountains

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist gleamed with the radiance of countless stars, resembling an entire cosmos smashing into his opponent’s Saint weapon. Upon impact, it was like all those stars suddenly exploded.

The void shattered to bits as Long Chen and the Celestial race’s Earth Saint were both sent flying. When they regained their footing, they glared at each other.

Long Chen swung out his hand, blood dripping from his clenched fist. However, no one dared to underestimate him due to this injury; instead, they were utterly astonished by the incredible display of power they had just witnessed.

“He really managed to withstand that attack?”

“Does that count as heaven-defying?”

“Which part? Blocking a Saint weapon with just his fist, or fighting an Earth Saint with a Saint weapon while being a Divine Venerate?”

Although Long Chen’s hand was bleeding, the fact that he withstood that attack still stunned everyone. None of them had ever witnessed a Divine Venerate blocking an Earth Saint’s full-power attack barehanded.

“He’s a monster!” exclaimed the Sage King from the Long Clan

All of the experts from the Long Clan were gobsmacked. However, Long Chen’s following words made them almost cough up blood.

“Hmm, I am actually injured... It’s quite unexpected that you could break my defenses.”

With an inconceivable expression, Long Chen looked at his slowly healing fist and then at his opponent.

“Goddamn!” Guo Ran exclaimed, his eyes fixed on Long Chen with awe. For Divine Venerate to utter such words to an Earth Saint was perhaps unprecedented in the history of the nine heavens.

Although Long Chen appeared calm on the surface, he was actually filled with delight inside. Upon using the Seven Star Battle Armor, he felt closer than ever to the starry sky above the nine heavens. He felt a blessing from his astral energy. While it was rather weak, to someone who had always been rejected by the Heavenly Daos, it felt marvelous.

As for the Earth Saint Long Chen was facing, he was staring at Long Chen with a mixture of astonishment and fear. Even the power of his Earth Dao laws was unable to defeat Long Chen. He had never encountered such a terrifying genius before.

According to the laws of the Heavenly Daos, the Heaven, Earth, and Mortal Saints were all capable of crushing those one level below them. Even though they could all be considered part of the Saint realm, the chasms separating them were vast: Heaven Saints repressed Earth Saints, Earth Saints subdued Mortal Saints, and Mortal Saints dominated anyone below.

The hierarchical power structure was very difficult to defy, as it was ingrained in the rules of the Heavenly Daos. However, there existed a singular exception: possessing a power that transcended the confines of Heavenly Daos.

Long Chen’s dragon blood power was one such power. It came from within him and did not require borrowing the power of the Heavenly Daos.

However, while Long Chen’s dragon blood power was formidable, its reservoir was finite, unlike the boundless reservoir of Heavenly Dao energy. Recognizing this limitation, the Earth Saint keenly observed Long Chen’s Blood Qi. He knew that Long Chen could not maintain this state forever, so he planned to exhaust Long Chen’s dragon blood power before delivering the fatal blow.

Unfortunately for him, other than the dragon blood power, Long Chen harbored yet another source of power beyond the reach of Heavenly Dao restrictions: his astral power. His so-called Earth Dao law, which should suppress all those weaker than him, proved utterly ineffective against Long Chen's combined might.

“That was the eighth move,” said Long Chen before starting to walk toward the Earth Saint.

Just then, there was a huge explosive sound in the direction of Evilmoon and Yue Wuxu’s giant sword. Everyone looked over to see countless fragments flying through the air, and then a streak of black light flew toward Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t even turn back. Raising his hand, Evilmoon returned to his hand.

“What?!”

The two Earth Saints of the Celestial race were finally horrified, not daring to believe that their divine weapon of the ancient era had been destroyed by Long Chen’s black saber.

Holding Evilmoon, Long Chen heard its satisfied voice. “Hehehe, not bad, not bad. If only there were another one hundred and eighty of them.”

“Don’t worry. There will be more in the future. Let’s work together for the last two moves,” said Long Chen.

“Hmph, two moves? We’ll kill him in one! The blood of an Earth Saint will mark the start of our domination in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven!” roared Evilmoon.

All of a sudden, an array of countless stars materialized upon Evilmoon, and it turned into something resembling a mirror that reflected the starry sky, or perhaps it should be said that it held the starry sky in it.

As a majestic aura unfurled throughout the heavens, the stars above shook, and their astral energy poured into Evilmoon.

The Earth Saint’s expression suddenly changed as he had been locked down by the power of Long Chen, Evilmoon, and the stars. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There was nowhere for him to run. Despite him having another Earth Saint comrade nearby, he couldn’t even sense his ally’s existence any longer. He was completely isolated against Long Chen.

“The ninth move!” Long Chen poured all his energy into Evilmoon and swung it down, like a river of stars being brought down upon the Earth Saint.

“You bastard, do you really think you can beat me in ten moves?! Earth Dao, Thousand Mountain Plain Reflection!” the Earth Saint roared and swung his sword vertically, chanting as he did so. After that, endless mountains and plains appeared before him. At first, they appeared illusory, but as space quivered, one mountain after another appeared before him.

Originally, he and Long Chen weren't that far apart. But once these mountains appeared, it felt like he and Long Chen were in completely different worlds, isolated by endless mountains and rivers.

“He summoned real mountains and plains? What kind of divine ability is that?!” exclaimed a disciple. Magical arts and divine abilities could not possibly summon something real.

“They seem to have a formation around them. But even more important is their vast Heavenly Dao energy. Heavens, these are unbreakable divine mountains!”

As the mountains and plains expanded, people realized that every mountain was filled with Heavenly Dao energy and a majestic aura that could crush Mortal Saints to death.

“What is he doing? Is he switching to defense just to last ten moves? Isn’t that too cowardly?”

Seeing the Earth Saint switch to defense, the Long clan’s experts cursed him. They were more experienced than the average person in the crowd, so they knew that this technique was the Earth Saint’s strongest defensive art.

BOOM!

Just then, Evilmoon descended like a starry river. Every expert in the crowd stared intently as this one attack would perhaps decide who lived and who died.
