Chapter 2925 Moving Out to the Inner Academy

The Unfettered Alliance had obtained victory in the divine competition. Hence, all of them had become inner academy disciples, and today was the day to check in.

The check-in time was noon, but Mu Qingyun and the others were so excited that they were ready as soon as the sun rose. However, when Long Chen didn’t show up, Mu Qingyun went over to his house with Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu.

Long Chen silently recalled Huo Long. He was still sleepy and could barely open his eyes.

His final exchange against Chu Kuang seemed to have severely exhausted something within his body. It could only be replenished through sleep.

However, today was the day to check in, so he had no choice but to get up. Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu giggled and washed his face with water to get him awake, making him feel pampered.

“Brother San, you really are amazing. Even that monster Chu Kuang was killed by you,” said Mu Qingyun worshipfully.

Even though she hadn’t fully witnessed his final battle with Chu Kuang, she had learned the details from other people. Chu Kuang’s trump cards had come out one after another, but he had still been defeated. That battle had practically shaken heavens and earth.

However, Long Chen shook his head. “Chu Kuang’s power wasn’t his own; it all came from somewhere else. He wasn’t able to control it, so defeating him is only natural.”

“Hehe, I really like that attitude, unlike those so-called geniuses that start prancing like a peacock after the tiniest accomplishments,” said Zhong Ling. There were practically stars of worship in her eyes when she looked at Long Chen. In the entire academy, Long Chen’s name was practically known to all. This generation’s Human tier competition of the God Institute could be said to be the grandest of all history.

The three heads of the Discipline Institute had come, and the institute head of the Immortal Institute had personally descended. Because of it, Long Chen’s fame soared.

Having fought alongside him, they also felt extremely proud. Even now, they were unable to settle their emotions. Long Chen had slept for three days, but they were so excited for three days that they hadn’t even been able to sleep. In truth, they hadn’t even fully recovered their physical energy from how excited they were.

Long Chen smiled. “A full bottle doesn’t make noise, but a half-full one rattles when shaken. Mature weather bends, but withered wheat stands tall. The ones with no ability are those that try to stand out the most.”

Long Chen took out his robes. In the last battle, the final attack had blasted apart his sleeve. After that, he had picked up the scraps and now began to sew them back together.

With his shoddy workmanship, the tears were not well hidden at all. It was uneven and rather ugly.

Mu Qingyun knew how important these robes were to Long Chen and said, “Brother San, I can help you sew them back together. I didn’t really study those arts, but I have sewn a bit as a child. I should be able to sew them back together better and make it more comfortable to wear.”

“No, I want to do it myself. The work being ugly doesn’t matter to me. It’s not like I’m looking for anyone to like how I look.” Long Chen smiled.

Mu Qingyun couldn’t help feeling slightly disappointed. Clearly, Long Chen didn’t want others to touch these robes. Perhaps this was also another covert kind of rejection.

However, he had said that he viewed her like a little sister. Although she felt a bit bad, she quickly settled those feelings.

“Brother San, you said that these robes were made by your loved ones. What did you mean by ‘ones’?” asked Zhong Xiu with a giggle.

Long Chen also laughed. “No need to be so indirect. You can ask me just how many sister-in-laws you’ll have. I can tell you.”

“I just knew that a hero like brother San would have multiple wives. That’s the only way to match you,” said Zhong Ling. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen shook his head. “You’re still children. Real love isn’t wanting to be with someone because they look beautiful. That’s just liking someone, or more accurately, liking their looks. When you love someone, you don’t need to just like their beautiful side, but you also have to embrace all their faults. Many times love requires giving far more than you get. That’s why the fruit of love is oftentimes more bitter than sweet.”

“What? Why? If love is more bitter than sweet, who would want it?” asked Zhong Ling.

“Because just that bit of sweetness in the bitterness is enough to fully satisfy someone. A person can be wounded ninety-nine times, but on the hundredth time, when their loved one’s hand brushes past their cheek, that warmth is enough to settle all the pain in their heart and make it worth it. Rather than saying that love is a bitter fruit, it might be better to say it’s poison with no cure. Despite knowing it’s poison, you will still swallow it in one gulp with no regrets,” said Long Chen, brushing his sleeve with his hand.

Looking at these robes, he thought of Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, Yue Xiaoqian, Zi Yan, as well as Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue in the Netherworld. He also thought of Yu Qingxuan who may or may not have reincarnated in an unknown location.

He didn’t know where in the immortal world they were. The competition within the immortal world was even tougher than on the Martial Heaven Continent. He didn’t know if they were doing well.

He also thought of his brothers in the Dragonblood Legion. They had all been sent throughout the immortal world by the dragon race expert. He didn’t know if they had managed to grasp their own opportunities.

Long Chen wished to gather everyone immediately, but he also knew that it wasn’t realistic. He couldn’t possibly find them. In a place as vast as the immortal world, searching for them was like scouring the sea for tiny needles.

The only thing he could do was raise his fame to the point that the name of Boss Long San resounded throughout the entire immortal world. Once the Dragonblood warriors heard this news of him, they would definitely gather toward him.

Now, he had managed to take one small step in that direction. His name was now known throughout the entire outer academy. It was time to enter the inner academy, and through the High Firmament Academy, he would create a resounding name for himself.

Eventually, his name would spread far and wide, and the Dragonblood warriors would come to him one by one. Thinking of how he could be by the side of those brothers who had fought alongside him, he felt his blood heating up.

Long Chen quickly finished the sewing. It was definitely ugly, but he didn’t mind. As long as it was together, it was fine. He didn’t care what others thought about it.

After making himself presentable, even his damaged robes weren’t able to conceal his handsome air. Mu Qingyun and the others’ eyes shone. The current Long Chen appeared even more powerful than before.

When he walked out, he saw that the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples were already waiting.

“Boss San!”

Li Cai had fully recovered and led everyone in a cheer when they saw Long Chen. Through this battle, this group of youth soldiers had become true experts.

“Let’s go. I heard that the competition is even more intense in the inner academy, right? I want to see if there’s anyone even more arrogant than Chu Kuang in the Earth tier divine rankings.” Long Chen led everyone toward the inner academy in high spirits.
