Chapter 4177 Illustrative Records

The eight appraisers panicked a bit after being shouted at and just looked at that elder in the distance.

Seeing this scene, that elder felt like he had lost his face. Anyway, he was now under everyone’s gaze, so there was no way for him to transmit spiritual messages over.

In the end, he coughed and said, “Long Chen asked you a question. What are you looking at me for? Isn’t it simple for grandmasters like yourselves to tell the veracity of this treasure?”

Long Chen sneered. His subtle hint was a bit too obvious, wasn’t it? Did he view others as fools?

As expected, one of the appraisers instantly said, “The Heaven Earth Cauldron is a primal chaos divine item, its legends echoing throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. Yet, while its name is known to all, none have laid eyes upon it. Moreover, historical records provide diverse descriptions of the Heaven Earth Cauldron's appearance. So even with our skill, we are ashamed to say that we cannot determine if it is the real thing.”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“What?!”

Countless people roared furiously.

“Do you take us for monkeys to be toyed with?!”

“If you can’t even appraise it, how dare you summon us here?! You’re just wasting our time!”

“You can’t even tell if it’s the real deal when it’s next to you?! You were the ones who swore that the cauldron in Long Chen’s hands was the Heaven Earth Cauldron! So you were just spreading lies to get others to kill him?!”

“You can’t tell if it’s real or not? Is that your excuse?! So you shamelessly demand our money for this farce? Give me my money back!”

The crowd went out of control. The eight of them had examined the cauldron for so long, only to make such a conclusion? Who wouldn’t be enraged by it?

“Everyone, everyone, calm down! Let me finish first!” cried out the elder.

When the furious roars settled a bit, the elder continued, “Everyone, although you are not specialized in this area, everyone knows just how important the Heaven Earth Cauldron is. No one would dare to be so arrogant as to say anything for sure about it.”

“But you were the ones who confirmed it in the Violet Flame Heaven,” said Long Chen.

The elder pretended not to hear Long Chen’s slap in the face. He continued, “When we first released this information, we were not prudent enough and didn’t go through a detailed evaluation. For us to make such a declaration without conclusive proof, we can’t shed responsibility for our mistake. Thus, the branch head who released this information was immediately dealt with and removed from office. We did all we could to remedy this situation, but this information spread too quickly, and we were unable to suppress it in time. There was nothing we could do at that point. Now that this cauldron is in front of us, we can make a conclusion based on its shape, runes, aura, and other factors with the documents that our Soaring Dragon Company has.”

The elder intentionally paused here. He was quite the schemer, drawing everyone’s attention and trying to regain control over the auction.

“If you have something to say, say it!”

“Hurry up!”

“What is it?!”

Quite a few impatient shouts rang out.

Seeing that there really was no way to control everyone, the elder hastily continued, “The conclusion we made is that this bronze cauldron is not an item of the current era.”

“Are you fucking stupid?! Anyone who isn’t blind can see that! Get to the main point!” scoffed a voice from a private box.

The elder didn’t dare to argue and continued, “We have compared it to the information that we have. This bronze cauldron matches forty-seven of the one hundred and seven pictures of the Heaven Earth Cauldron that we have in our records.”

“What? Are all the pictures of the Heaven Earth Cauldron different?”

The appraisers didn’t reply and just looked at the elder in the distance once more. That elder announced, “I’m sorry, but this relates to one of the Soaring Dragon Company’s secrets. Forgive me for not being able to disclose it.”

Long Chen grasped this chance to say, “What dogshit secret? If you can’t bring out any proof, how is anyone supposed to believe you? How can we possibly trust your word when you lie and say whatever you want for profit? Everyone here came for the Heaven Earth Cauldron. If you cannot evaluate this cauldron and give any proof, aren’t you treating everyone like idiots? I took the risk of having a supreme treasure robbed from me precisely because I wanted to know just what this item was. Every single person here wants to know the same thing. No matter what, your Soaring Dragon Company must give us a satisfactory answer today.”

Long Chen was extremely confident at the moment. With the help of the Earth Cauldron, he wasn’t afraid at all. No matter what, he had to sell this fake for a good price. If the Soaring Dragon Company couldn’t control the crowd, then they could allow him to sell it himself.

“Long Chen is right! You must give us a satisfactory answer! Otherwise, who knows whether or not you are just conning us?! After all, we’ve never seen the Heaven Earth Cauldron, nor have we seen your records!” This time, even innate Heaven Venerates couldn’t sit still. The Soaring Dragon Company had to bring out proof. They couldn’t just skip over this.

After all, the matter of the Heaven Earth Cauldron was huge. If this cauldron really was the Heaven Earth Cauldron, it would be the first of the ten primal chaos divine items to appear in millions and millions of years.

It was said that after the great battle of primal chaos, all the ten primal chaos divine items vanished. Even inheritances relating to them disappeared within the river of time.

It was said that the final existence to be bestowed with anything from the primal chaos divine items was the Grand Xia Nation. But ultimately, Xia Guhong disbanded the Grand Xia.

Although it was rumored that Xia Guhong could control a trace of the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s power, in the end, the actual Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow never appeared. As a result, the ten great primal chaos divine items remained lost.

If Long Chen’s bronze cauldron really was a primal chaos divine item, this would be a matter that shook the nine heavens and ten lands.

Although people hadn’t believed it at the start, after seeing it and sensing its supreme divine might, they started to believe it. But in the end, whether it was real or not would have to be decided by professionals specialized in dealing with such matters.

However, these specialists were trying to get out of making a real decision today? How could they let that happen?

“Soaring Dragon Company, what do you think you’re playing at? Is this how you conduct business? Do you believe me when I say that I’ll tear down your tortoise nest?!” In the end, someone actually unleashed their terrifying aura. They seemed to be on the verge of exploding.

This was an innate Heaven Venerate from the devil race, and his terrifying devil qi burst out of his private room. His sinister killing intent shook people’s souls.

“Soaring Dragon Company, stop dawdling! Hand over the proof!”

Other Heaven Venerates began to shout, intimidating the Soaring Dragon Company’s people. But in front of their fury, they chose to compromise.

They then glared at Long Chen darkly, as if Long Chen had just slain their father. In front of their fury, Long Chen smiled inside, feeling much better.

“The Bai clan’s brother and sister were so kind and pure. Today, if I don’t con you to death, I’ll write my name backward.”

With no other choice, the Soaring Dragon Company obediently dragged out a bunch of picture frames of various sizes. When Long Chen saw the images depicted in them, his heart sank.

“Not good!”
