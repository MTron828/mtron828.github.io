Chapter 2641 Tribulations in Batches

Long Chen and the others rushed down the willow. After that, they saw that outside Devil Spirit Mountain, everyone was standing tensely. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The aura of the Martial Heaven Continent was still familiar but also foreign at the same time. It was because the laws of the other worlds had finished fusing with the Martial Heaven Continent. In other words, the experts from the other worlds would no longer be restricted by the Martial Heaven Continent’s laws and would be able to freely enter.

Qu Jianying, Li Tianxuan, and the old man all rushed over. Upon spotting Long Chen, Qu Jianying said, “The Dragonblood Legion doesn’t need to rush to finish their tribulation. First, protect the ordinary disciples.”

Long Chen was confused. Li Tianxuan explained, “With the world changing, with the laws in chaos, even Empyreans no longer have much of an advantage. They are chosen by the Heavenly Daos but not the Heavenly Daos of the other worlds. Thus, when they undergo tribulation, the heavenly punishment aspect will be stronger, increasing the danger. Right now, the ones to undergo their tribulations first will have it a bit easier since the Heavenly Dao energy is in chaos. However, as more people finish their tribulations, the fusion of the different laws will grow more complete, and there will no longer be any chaos to take advantage of. At that time, it will be difficult for ordinary disciples to get through their tribulations. That’s why it’s best for the comparatively weaker disciples to first undergo tribulation to maintain the highest possible success rate for everyone.”

So that was the case. Long Chen nodded. In any case, the Dragonblood Legion had him, so it didn’t matter how powerful the tribulation was.

“However, going later has its own benefits. The stronger the heavenly tribulation, the greater the benefits. Due to the other worlds’ energy entering, you will also be able to absorb that energy and use those laws to your advantage,” said Qu Jianying.

“Then you can arrange things for us.” Long Chen nodded. Since he didn’t know much about this, he would just listen to orders.

The Heavenly Daos quivered. Even from a great distance, Long Chen could see specks of light appearing. Long Chen sensed many familiar auras.

“People are starting their tribulations. The weaker ones must pass through right at the start, or once stronger ones go through and the Heavenly Dao energy grows stronger, they won’t be able to clear this tribulation,” said Li Tianxuan.

More specks of light lit up. Every speck of light represented someone undergoing tribulation.

They were like stars in the sky. Some were small, some were weak. The smaller ones were those with weaker tribulations, while the brighter ones were stronger tribulations.

“Should we prepare to stop our enemies from interrupting and causing chaos? If they attack while we’re undergoing tribulation, won’t that raise the difficulty? Experts like The Blood Fiend Devil Lord and Alldevil Heavenwalker will be able to stop the majority of us from passing,” said Guo Ran.

Li Tianxuan smiled. “You don’t need to worry about that. Experts on this level won’t waste this precious chance. They will definitely wait until the end to enjoy the strongest heavenly tribulation. As for the ordinary experts, if they come to the Martial Heaven Continent to undergo tribulation, they will be easily killed. Furthermore, the channels to all the worlds have been fully opened, but the joint laws are still differentiated by proportion. That means by undergoing tribulation in the Martial Heaven Continent, one will absorb a bit more of the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent in comparison to the other worlds’ laws. The same is true for us if we go to their worlds. If you do, you will be unable to receive the blessing of your original world, and it will increase the difficulty of the tribulation.”

“The divine families have discussed this with everyone. Everything is arranged. The first batch of experts is undergoing their tribulations. Based on weakest to strongest, the first batch is the weakest, the second is slightly stronger, and the third batch is the core warriors of the Martial Heaven Alliance. The fourth batch includes the strongest warriors, while the fifth batch is the greatest geniuses of every various power. The sixth batch will be left to Lingshan, Buping, Chang Hao, and experts on that level. The Dragonblood Legion is set to go with the fifth batch. That should be no problem, right?” said Qu Jianying.

“The Dragonblood Legion would be better suited to the sixth batch,” said Long Chen.

“Long Chen, that would be too dangerous. The heavenly tribulations will grow increasingly powerful. Most importantly, if your Dragonblood Legion undergoes tribulation together, it will be even more terrifying,” said Qu Jianying.

“That’s fine. Going through heavenly tribulation is something I’m extremely experienced with,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Although the individual combat power of each Dragonblood warrior might not be able to match the likes of Ye Lingshan, Bao Buping, and Chang Hao, they were definitely not inferior in terms of their physical bodies.

Long Chen wanted the absolute strongest heavenly tribulation to fully activate the ten thousand dragon blood in their bodies. They would be like rusty blades, and the tribulation was like a whetstone.

“Alright. In any case, your tribulation should be left to the end. That is because the final tribulation relates to the entire continent’s karmic luck. It will probably fully activate the continent’s karmic luck. At that time, the strongest experts will undergo tribulation all at once. However, you should be mentally prepared. The experts from the other worlds will very likely make a move to try to kill you at that time,” warned Qu Jianying.

“Kill me? They dare to enter my heavenly tribulation to kill me?” said Long Chen, almost unable to believe his ears.

“Yes. Don’t be careless. There is the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, as well as the Alldevil Heavenwalker. There’s even the sea demon race’s dragon woman. If your heavenly tribulation causes the phenomenon of all the world’s karmic luck gathering on you, they will definitely come to snatch it from you. If they kill you, they will be able to take that karmic luck and obtain anything that they want on the Martial Heaven Continent, because all the continent’s karmic luck will be supporting them. However, this is only a possibility. This karmic luck might end up supporting someone else, such as Yun Tian, Hu Feng, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, Jiang Wuchen, Feng Fei, or even someone like Ye Ming. In any case, no matter who it appears on, the other worlds’ experts will definitely come to fight over it. Most importantly, you need to be worried about people supposedly on our side. That is because whoever obtains that karmic luck is the future Sovereign,” said Qu Jianying.

Long Chen instantly understood this final sentence. So whoever obtained this karmic luck would be the Sovereign. If that was the case, then the ones he needed to be most wary of were Long Aotian and the others.

Furthermore, this karmic luck could be stolen? In other words, the other worlds’ experts could also take it. If they obtained it, then this war would be over before it even started.

The past Sovereigns had all gained the support of the Martial Heaven Continent’s karmic luck. That was what allowed them to reach the peak of the martial path, to become unrivaled existences.

This karmic luck support was the crux of becoming a Sovereign. It would also be the crux as to whether or not victory could be won in this war.

“Alliance head, which tribulation batch have you decided on?” Long Chen suddenly thought of Qu Jianying and the others. They were all at the peak of Netherpassage. They could also undergo tribulation.
