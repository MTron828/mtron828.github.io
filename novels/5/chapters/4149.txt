Chapter 4138: The Blood Devil Race’s Calculations

“Good, how refreshing! Bring them to me!” Long Chen extended a hand.

“How could I have so many materials on me? I need to get them from the race leader first. Wait here.” Xue Qingkuang snorted and started walking out of this domain.

Before leaving, he turned to his subordinates and shouted, “Keep an eye on him! If he does anything strange, leave. Don’t fight them here!”

Watching him leave, Long Chen slowly smiled. He hadn’t expected his bluff to really result in a harvest.

“Race leader, this Long Chen is a conman! Just look at him, he’s clearly untrustworthy! Why would we collaborate with him?!”

Xue Qingkuang arrived at the outside camp of the Blood Devil race, dissatisfied with the orders from the elder with a golden crown on his head.

“You don’t understand. I’ve investigated this Long Chen. Both his background and methods are extraordinary. Even though countless experts pursue him, he is still alive. He must be very shrewd. I also heard that he has the primal chaos divine item, the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Although the odds of the rumor being true are low, I always feel like it’s not as simple as a scam. That’s why I want to test him now…” said the race leader of the Blood Devil race.

“Race leader, the price of this test is too high! This bastard wants a lion’s bite out of us! What if he just consumes everything? Then we’ll not just lose so much, but we’ll also become laughingstocks!” Xue Qingkuang couldn’t help interrupting him.

“Ah, you, you’re still too young. Do you think his tricks can deceive me? He wants to borrow our power to pull out the spear. At the time, the spear will be his, and the Devil Saint’s corpse will be ours. How could there be such a good thing in this world? We want the corpse and the spear, as well as all of their lives.” The race leader laughed sinisterly.

“What?” Xue Qingkuang was startled.

The race leader confidently said, “Although I can’t get close to the corpse, I can see that if he wants to extract the spear, he first must disperse the Devil Saint’s curse energy. It’s because the spear and corpse are already one and cannot be separated. Actually, he’s quite knowledgeable to know that our Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed can absorb the devil curse. Then he might very likely take out the spear-”

“That’s only a possibility! What if he can’t take it out? Won’t we have lost everything for nothing?!”

“Stop interrupting me, brat! I’ll beat you right here and now! Can you not wait for me to finish before speaking?!” The race leader finally shouted at Xue Qingkuang angrily after being interrupted multiple times.

Only then did Xue Qingkuang realize just how rude he was being, so he hastily apologized.

“I know that you know how to be prudent. That is a good thing, but sometimes you need guts too. To use the human word’s saying, the more guts you have, the more wealth you can gain. Guts are wealth! Do you think that I would take risks for nothing? As soon as he uses the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed, it will absorb the devil curse. However, I have placed my spiritual devil seed on the lotus seed, and once it absorbs the devil curse, hehe, I will be able to use it to control the corpse of the Devil Saint. If we are lucky enough, it will still possess a trace of its soul essence. Even if it’s just the weakest trace, we’ll have a chance to refine it into a puppet! Hehe, a Devil Saint puppet! If we can control it, we can slay gods and immortals as easily as killing chickens!” The race leader laughed. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Xue Qingkuang was delighted. So his race leader had long since calculated things. If this really worked, the Blood Devil race would soar.

“If Long Chen does manage to pull out the spear, he and his companions will be wiped out of existence at that moment, only watching as the Great Desolate Devil Saint kills them. But if he fails to pull it out, that’s fine too. I will then activate the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed’s Blood Devil Rune. None of them will be able to endure the pressure of the Devil Saint when it activates. After that, wouldn’t it be simple for you to kill Long Chen?” The race leader laughed.

“Race leader is wise. Qingkuang is envious.” Xue Qingkuang immediately said some heartfelt fawning words. He truly was too naive compared to the race leader.

“Go. If you have a chance, keep Long Chen alive. He definitely has many secrets on him,” said the race leader.

“Understood!”

Xue Qingkuang nodded. After that, the race leader handed him a longan-sized bead.

The bead was covered in blood-colored marks and gave off a sinister aura, looking like the eyeball of a fiend that possessed apocalyptic power.

Seeing the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed, Xue Qingkuang was feverish. If he could refine this seed, his power would instantly soar.

“No need to look at it that intensely. If you succeed, this seed will belong to you,” said the race leader with a slight smile.

“Many thanks, race leader!”

Hearing this, Xue Qingkuang was surprised and delighted. He then brought the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed and blocks of immortal metal back to the corpse.

“Has Long Chen gone crazy?” demanded an elder from the Fullmoon race. “He’s collaborating with the Blood Devil race? Does he not know how deep the enmity between the human race and the devil race is? He’ll definitely be betrayed.”

“Perhaps it’s not so simple.”

At first, Xu Jianxiong was also frowning over this. Collaborating with the devil race was asking for it.

However, with his understanding of Long Chen, Xu Jianxiong knew that Long Chen wouldn’t do something so foolish. Furthermore, looking at his confident appearance, he believed that Long Chen had his own plans.

However, whether it was Long Chen or the leader of the Blood Devil race, they both looked like victory was in their grasp. It was simply unknown whose scheming was on a higher level.

“Master is too wise to do something so foolish. Don’t worry, the truth will soon be exposed,” said Uncle Tree with a slight smile.

None of them had been in contact with Long Chen for very long, but Uncle Tree’s understanding of Long Chen was definitely greater than that of the Fullmoon race. He had absolute confidence in Long Chen.

After all, Long Chen was able to save him from the fiend eye and had even released a legendary Warrior of the Starry Sky from a Ghost Ship. Since then, he had been convinced by Long Chen’s methods, and he didn’t worry about Long Chen in terms of intelligence.

At this time, Xue Qingkuang returned to the corpse. After clenching his teeth, he shouted, “Long Chen, the things that you asked for are here! If you dare to trick me, I promise that you’ll regret coming to this world!”

Long Chen walked down the corpse and came over to Xue Qingkuang’s side. Looking at the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed, he almost lost control.

This was an invaluable treasure and something he needed urgently. While the other materials were intended for Guo Ran and Xia Chen, the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed was the sole item he desired.

When Xue Qingkuang handed it over with a pained expression, Long Chen suddenly raised his head and laughed, causing Xue Qingkuang and the others’ expressions to change.
