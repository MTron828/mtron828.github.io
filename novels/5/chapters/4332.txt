Chapter 4321: Using Up Energy

When Long Chen summoned his divine ring, the throne quivered as a violent suction force caused the spring‚Äôs energy to surge toward him. It was possible to see all that energy flowing his way.

Like the gaping maw of a beast, a giant vortex appeared behind him, greedily devouring the energy in the spirit spring.

Long Chen had already tested the intensity of the primal chaos energy and could tell that he could endure it. Thus, he started going all out at absorbing it.

With this, Guo Ran and Xia Chen clearly felt the pressure on them lessen. They could sense that a portion of the energy pouring toward them was being sucked away.

Their joy was palpable. Despite their best efforts, they had been struggling to endure this energy flow, making it seem as though they were on the verge of exploding. However, with Long Chen absorbing it at full power, he succeeded in relieving them of a portion of the pressure.

While the two of them were happy about it, the other experts on their respective thrones seethed with rage. They cursed Long Chen and desperately tried to absorb more energy from him.

However, they clearly didn‚Äôt know how to expedite their energy absorption. No matter what they did, they could only watch as it poured toward Long Chen. Their furious roars echoed through the pool in vain.

After all, they only knew how to passively absorb the energy of the throne, not how to absorb it faster or how to control the flow of the energy.

‚ÄúWhat idiots. These thrones were made by the human race. They have formations around them, but after destroying the human race, you lost the method for controlling the thrones. You truly are hopeless fools,‚Äù sneered Long Chen as he absorbed the primal chaos energy.

BANG, BANG, BANG‚Ä¶!

The other two heavenly geniuses switched to attacking Long Chen‚Äôs seal, vainly trying to disturb him. Regretfully, their efforts came to nothing, and the giant vortex was completely unaffected.

As more primal chaos energy poured into Long Chen, his Blood Qi raged like a tsunami. Meanwhile, his tendons seemed to transform into small golden dragons with scales on them, each scale bearing a rune reminiscent of an egg. These runes awakened under the influence of the primal chaos energy, undergoing some kind of transformation. As a result, every single one of his tendons felt full of energy.

In his bones, some strange energy was flowing within the chaotic scars. Like dry riverbeds, they were rapidly absorbing primal chaos energy to repair themselves.

Meanwhile, his Dantian‚Äôs starry sea sparkled with fervor. Each star hosted a violet flame seedling that greedily absorbed this primal chaos energy.

Just like hungry wolves, Long Chen‚Äôs Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, Spirit Bone, and dragon tendons were devouring this vast primal chaos energy. It was as if they were worried about running out of it.

The boiling spirit spring then started to rumble intensely, and cracks appeared on its borders.

Countless experts had surrounded the area above and enclosed this region. But now, they were horrified by what they saw.

The land around the spirit spring was now cracking. It was a phenomenon they had never seen before.

The spirit spring was supposed to just boil, but now, it was like there was an earthquake. The ground shook intensely, and the entire world was trembling.

Two hours later, Long Chen‚Äôs divine ring still voraciously absorbed the primal chaos energy, not showing any sign of being satisfied. However, the seals around Xia Chen and Guo Ran were starting to weaken, causing their expressions to change. This signified that they were reaching saturation, and they would no longer be able to absorb more primal chaos energy.

Once they could no longer do so, the seal would be undone. Then, the two experts who didn‚Äôt have thrones would immediately attack them. Their gazes were already locked onto Guo Ran and Xia Chen with icy killing intent.

‚ÄúBoss, just ignore us! We can protect yourselves!‚Äù shouted Xia Chen.

He could see that Long Chen was crazily absorbing energy and shouldn‚Äôt be interrupted. If Long Chen came out in advance to save them, he would no longer have such a chance again.

Suddenly, Xia Chen pressed a talisman against the seal on his throne, and the seal suddenly vanished. He had undone his protection in advance.

‚ÄúDie!‚Äù

Seeing him reveal himself, those two experts immediately attacked him.

In response, Xia Chen activated a formation disc in his hand and unleashed a net that enveloped the two of them. In the water, their movements weren‚Äôt very nimble, so they were instantly caught.

However, the runic net, formed from an ancient formation disc, proved to be no match for their immense power. It was sliced apart in an instant, allowing them to break free.

Just as they escaped the net, Xia Chen arrived at Guo Ran‚Äôs throne. In that critical moment, the seal around Guo Ran vanished, and Xia Chen squeezed onto the same throne alongside him. Xia Chen then threw out thirty-six formation discs, arranging them around the throne. As they lit up, these lining-up discs conjured walls of light that formed a powerful defensive formation.

BOOM!

One of those lifeforms launched a relentless assault against the barrier, channeling all his might into it. The sheer force of the blow made the entire spirit spring tremble, and the barrier quivered in response, though it remained intact. Nevertheless, its divine light noticeably dimmed.

‚ÄúDamn, this one attack can annihilate a swath of half-step Eternals!‚Äù Xia Chen exclaimed in shock. It had nearly drained the majority of the formation‚Äôs power. If Xia Chen had to estimate it, its power was enough to wipe out a horde of half-step Eternals that had fought during the Sage King Convention. This fellow was absolutely terrifying.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how long you can hide!‚Äù

The other lifeform smashed on Xia Chen‚Äôs barrier with his fist. But before it happened, a cask-like object appeared beneath Xia Chen‚Äôs feet, and it was packed to the brim with primal chaos spirit stones. With its appearance, the dim barrier regained its light.

BOOM!

This lifeform‚Äôs fist caused the barrier to dim once more. Following the strike, the primal chaos spirit stones in the cask shattered, turning into debris. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Unfazed by the onslaught, Xia Chen took out yet another cask filled with primal chaos spirit stones. The runic symbols on the cask then activated, causing the spirit stones to burst into a brilliant glow. The previously dim formation once again regained its vitality.

It was evident that these casks served as fuel to sustain the formation. As long as he had a sufficient supply of fuel, the barrier would remain unbroken.

The two lifeforms relentlessly assailed the barrier, and Xia Chen continued to swap out his casks of primal chaos spirit stones. Even as he burned through this money, Xia Chen‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change. With his immense wealth, he could maintain this kind of expenditure for a century with no problem.

The two lifeforms persisted in their attacks but remained unable to reach Xia Chen or Guo Ran, further fueling their frustration.

At this time, the two of them found that the primal chaos energy coming from the spring was starting to weaken. Panic quickly set in as they realized there was no longer enough primal chaos energy to sustain all of them.

Other than Xia Chen and Guo Ran, no one else had reached full saturation. All of a sudden, one of the two experts attacking Xia Chen‚Äôs barrier shot toward Xia Chen‚Äôs empty throne.

‚ÄúHow can this be?!‚Äù

However, when he arrived, he was shocked to find that the throne didn‚Äôt react at all. In other words, the spirit spring‚Äôs primal chaos energy was no longer sufficient to activate this throne.

It had to be known that Xia Chen and Guo Ran had only absorbed very little of the primal chaos energy compared to the others. When combined, their absorption amounted to less than half of what a single one of them had consumed. Yet, the primal chaos energy within the spring was dwindling rapidly.

Just then, the moon-like core of the spring cracked.

BOOM!

Just as everyone was shocked by this, the core of the spring suddenly exploded.
