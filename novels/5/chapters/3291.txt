Chapter 3280 One Sword to Slay an Immortal King

Golden light flowed around Bai Shishi’s entire body. Within her manifestation, a beautiful golden goddess appeared and merged with her. She appeared sacred, holy, and untouchable.

In the face of an Immortal King, Bai Shishi didn’t hold back. Her metal energy was circulated to her peak state. With her at the center, everything within a thousand miles turned golden.

At this moment, Bai Shishi’s sword quivered. Its runes seemed to come to life, and they began to move on top of the sheath.

This was Long Chen’s first time seeing Bai Shishi going all-out since the Nine Prefecture Convention. Her metal energy was truly terrifying. When she activated it, the power of the Heavenly Daos automatically assisted her.

She was like a golden sun illuminating the world. Even Jiang Yuhe, Zhao Qinglong, and the other experts that hadn’t revealed themselves felt their hearts shake. They had never witnessed someone with such terrifying metal energy.

Upon seeing this, Qiu Yang’s expression changed. He suddenly had a bad feeling as a sense of fear that he could not suppress rose within his heart.

Qiu Yang’s hand seals suddenly changed, and millions of spirit swords condensed into a torrent flooding toward Bai Shishi.

Originally, it should have been forbidden to attack in this place. He had only unleashed his aura in order to extinguish the flame of Long Chen’s arrogance, and the true battle should have been fought outside.

However, he was unable to wait. He attacked in advance, while Bai Shishi’s aura was still climbing. He wanted to interrupt her.

In return, the golden sword came out of its sheath and golden light erupted. It slashed down, passing through the torrent of swords, going straight against the flow to slash at Qiu Yang.

The flow of millions of swords was cut apart by golden sword-light. The divine radiance annihilated all those swords. In front of the golden sword, they were unable to endure the slightest contact.

Suddenly, the golden light vanished. And with a light sound, Bai Shishi’s sword returned to its sheath. The golden light illuminating the world vanished without a trace. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After that, Bai Shishi’s own golden light vanished, revealing her true appearance. But then, her face was as pale as paper, and blood leaked out of the corner of her mouth.

Seeing this, Qin Feng and the others were startled. Bai Shishi was injured? Could it be that she was unable to endure a single blow from Qiu Yang?

“Why bother? Even if it has recognized you as its master, its power isn’t something that you can control yet. You injured yourself just to kill him.” Long Chen reached out to support the tottering Bai Shishi. He knew that this one blow had sucked up all her energy.

It had to be known that this was a King item. Only World Kings were capable of creating such a thing. How could a little Four Peak novice control it?

Bai Shishi had actually tried to activate the runes of this King item. As a result, she only managed to activate a single King item rune. She then unleashed one attack that used up all her energy, to the point that she didn’t even have anything left to resist the backlash.

Long Chen gave her a medicinal pill, and only then did her complexion improve slightly. Long Chen then sat her down where he was originally sitting.

Only then did everyone turn to look at Qiu Yang. He was just standing there.

Suddenly, the sword in his hand broke. It fell to the ground and shattered into golden dust. As for his own body, from the top of his head down to his abdomen, a golden line appeared.

Everyone stared at him in horror. Only now did they realize that his spiritual fluctuations had long since vanished. He was already dead.

Suddenly, Qiu Yang’s body exploded, like a statue packed in golden sand. As he collapsed, the golden powder scattered.

This golden powder slowly merged into the earth until nothing was left. It was as if the Little Spirit King Qiu Yang had never existed.

Whether it was Zhao Qinglong or Jiang Yuhe, they were terrified. That sword was something that would kill whoever it touched. A little Four Peak disciple actually possessed such power?

It had to be known that the sword in Qiu Yang’s hand was also on the level of a King item. Although it was considered to be a defective good amongst King items, it was still a King item. For it to have been broken like that, just what level was Bai Shishi’s sword?

For a moment, the world was silent. Everyone stared at the pale Bai Shishi who was in the midst of recovering. 

“Zhao Qinglong, your Little Spirit King Qiu Yang has died, and my friend has temporarily lost her combat power. Why don’t you try seeing if you can avenge your comrade?” Long Chen had given Bai Shishi his chair, so he took out another one and lazily sat on it.

Zhao Qinglong’s expression was ugly. He was infuriated inside. Just how was he so unlucky? He was just sitting at home when calamity descended from the heavens. Moreover, this calamity came all too suddenly. Why did it have to come for him?

Although Bai Shishi was injured and had lost her combat power, Long Chen appeared far too calm for Zhao Qinglong to think that he could take advantage of this. He was completely suppressed by Long Chen’s domineeringness.

After all, he was no blind man. He could see that Long Chen was the true leader of this group, and the leader was definitely the strongest. Even after all his years of experience, he had no idea what to do in this situation.

“Friend, what do you want? Just tell me. If you really want to go too far, then I, Zhao Qinglong, will definitely accompany you to death,” said Zhao Qinglong coldly.

For him to say such a thing, anyone with a brain could tell that he was afraid. He had no intention of avenging Qiu Yang. As long as Long Chen didn’t continue killing, he would let this matter go.

“Aiya, I didn’t expect that the world-shaking leader of the Azure Dragon Gang would also have a day when he waved his tail and begged for mercy. Don’t you remember the day you became sworn brothers? Didn’t you say that you would die together? What? After your brother died, are you not planning on accompanying him?” Jiang Yuhe immediately threw some stones at him while he was down.

Hearing this, Zhao Qinglong was ashen with rage. However, Long Chen’s group was too frightening. He was unable to see through their true power, so he didn’t dare to do anything.

With no way to retort to Jiang Yuhe’s mocking, Zhao Qinglong directly pretended as if he couldn’t hear it. He simply looked at Long Chen.

Seeing that, Long Chen laughed. “As expected of the leader, you know to avoid calamity. Being able to suppress your anger means that you can live longer. I really am inferior to you in this regard. Alright, Qiu Yang is dead, so my academy has cleaned up its mess. We’ve also finished killing the chicken to warn the monkeys. Other people like to use diplomacy before fighting, but I prefer to first fight and then talk peacefully. Now we can properly chat. I have some business I would like your cooperation with. Also, you two big shots, isn’t it time for you to come out and greet me now that you’ve watched for so long?”

Long Chen’s final sentence was shouted toward the inside of the Zhaoming Ancient City. It was for the heads of the Iron Blood Mercenary Group and the Blood Drinking Alliance to hear.

“Greet you? Sorry, but you don’t have the qualifications.” A disdainful sneer came from within the city. Hearing this, Qin Feng and the others’ expressions sank. Some people still couldn’t judge the situation properly.

Long Chen smiled and stood up from his chair. He indifferently said, “I will count to three. If you don’t come out, then starting now, the Vile Dragon Domain will no longer have a Blood Drinking Alliance and Iron Blood Mercenary Group. Boss Long San never says any empty words, but if you don’t believe it, you can try it. One!”
