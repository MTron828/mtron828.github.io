The world shook with every step Long Chen took. The lightning crackled ominously overhead, as if eager to unleash another devastating assault at any moment.

Long Chen seemed to be the master of the tribulation at this moment, and it didn’t seem like anyone could challenge him.

“You’re too arrogant! Do you think your little tricks can affect us the great Celestial race?!” Luo Changsheng shouted. As a genius of the heavens, an existence high above others from the moment he was born, he couldn’t tolerate being looked down like this.

It was akin to when Long Chen knew Luo Changsheng was intentionally provoking him by slandering the Dragonblood Legion, yet he couldn’t stop himself from being enraged. After all, they were all subject to their own weaknesses; an expert’s pride often made their tolerance weaker.

“Arrogance requires capital, and it just so happens that I have that capital.” Long Chen continued to walk toward Luo Changsheng. Lightning roared above him, as if he was brewing some big move.

However, Long Chen wasn’t even looking at the tribulation. He appeared as if he was just taking a leisurely stroll through a courtyard, as if everything was under control.

“You still refuse to attack? Are you still thinking of inciting others to fight for you? Stop dreaming. None of them are stupid enough to be bewitched by you. Just like you, they are waiting for others to use up their trump cards. Not a single person here is weak, different from those idiots outside. Those idiots don’t even see that the Celestial race is just sitting there while they throw their lives away,” mocked Long Chen.

Indeed, the Dragonblood warriors were massacring their enemies outside of the tribulation, filling the battlefield with corpses and rivers of blood. The Dragonblood warriors were unrivaled, but there were just so many enemies that they couldn’t kill them all.

However, when they heard Long Chen, those attackers couldn’t help looking toward a certain group—the Celestial race.

Tens of millions of experts of the Celestial race were just standing there, as if this battle had nothing to do with them.

Seeing this scene, those experts were enraged. They had been actively attacking the Dragonblood Legion, but the Celestial race was just sitting there. Their objective had been to unsettle Long Chen by targeting his subordinates. However, to their dismay, Luo Changsheng, the one who had instigated these attacks, had refrained from involving his own people.

“You bastards of the Celestial race, if you dare to just keep watching, we’ll kill you with the Dragonblood Legion!”

Only after that threat did the Celestial race unwillingly leave their defensive formation. They charged at the Dragonblood Legion with another group.

It was a group of giants with one eye—from the same race as the one-eyed giant Long Chen had previously killed. As their leader was gone, they could only choose to unleash their fury on the Dragonblood warriors.

“Annihilate the Dragonblood Legion!” one of those giants roared, leading the way with his warhammer. His strike directly shattered one of the Dragonblood warrior’s weapons. Following the flow of his attack, he charged in, trying to tear through the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses.

However, a figure suddenly blocked his path. With his hands clasped behind his back, Guo Ran gazed at that expert apathetically.

“A pea-brained idiot also dares to say such big words?”

“Die!”

The one-eyed giant roared and swung his warhammer at Guo Ran.

“This little bit of power is all you have? If I have to lift my hand against this hammer, it’ll count as my loss!” sneered Guo Ran.

In front of countless shocked gazes, Guo Ran really did just stand there and let the hammer strike his head.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, that warhammer shattered, leaving only its hilt. The giant’s singular eye was filled with shock.

“Now do you believe me?”

Guo Ran casually flicked away the scattered metal bits of the hammer from his robes, his demeanor suggesting that he was only brushing away some dust. He appeared unspeakably casual and indifferent.

“He’s showing off again.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Seeing this scene, Gu Yang and the others were speechless. Guo Ran was the Dragonblood Legion’s number one poser, and his timing was always perfect.

At this moment, everyone’s gaze turned solely on him. Guo Ran had successfully seized the spotlight from Long Chen.

Feeling all their gazes on him, Guo Ran was incredibly delighted, but he didn’t express it. Appearing completely apathetic, he shook his head at the giant.

“This is your so-called power? How foolish.”

“DIE!” the one-eyed giant roared. Runes covered his fist as he attacked Guo Ran again.

BOOM!

As a result, blood sprayed from his mouth, and he was sent flying.

“This is amazing!” Guo Ran cried out inside. The hidden dragon race’s defenses were indeed unrivaled, filling him with excitement. If he didn’t properly show it off, he wouldn’t be Guo Ran.

“You can’t even break my defenses. Ugh, you ants aren’t even worth my time. It’s really lonely being unrivaled!” Guo Ran sighed. He was basically bragging to be beaten.

“Go fuck yourself!”

His appearance triggered countless people, and they all attacked him.

However, no matter what divine ability or weapon landed on him, they simply bounced off. If it was a weapon with no flexibility, it would instantly shatter.

The hidden dragon’s defenses were truly monstrous, impervious to blade or spear, water or fire. Guo Ran just stood there, allowing those attacks to strike him. However, he didn’t forget to constantly insult them, enraging them, and they were unable to do anything to Guo Ran despite their rage.

In truth, Guo Ran did want to counterattack, but he couldn’t. After merging with the hidden dragon’s dragon soul, other than his Dragon Blood Battle Armor, he only had a few other divine abilities of the dragon race.

Unfortunately, using those divine abilities would require the hidden dragon’s cooperation. However, the hidden dragon was incredibly lazy, sleeping inside of him. When his life wasn’t in danger, he couldn’t wake it up.

With his armor and weapons already decimated in the previous skirmish against the Celestial race, Guo Ran found himself lacking offensive capabilities. In order to not expose this aspect, he could only use his mouth as his weapon to attack them.

“Take out your weapon. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance!” Guo Ran challenged, his voice carrying a hint of determination

Meanwhile, Long Chen closed in on Luo Changsheng, his icy killing intent already locking onto him.
