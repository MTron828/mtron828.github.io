Chapter 4305 Charging Through the Gate

Other than Long Chen, everyone else was stunned, including the armored Guo Ran and Xia Chen who was holding a talisman.

The devil expert’s sword ruthlessly struck Long Chen’s shoulder and broke the surface of his skin, but no blood trickled down. Instead, it was just stuck in Long Chen’s shoulder, leaving the devil expert in utter shock.

Although this attack was not the devil expert’s absolute strongest blow, it still represented at least eighty percent of his full power. He had intended to force Long Chen to block, whereupon he would launch his true killing blow. However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to not move at all and instead receive his sword with his body.

It felt as if he had just attacked a star, and a powerful backlash shook his arm. People were shocked to see blood dripping onto the ground, but it wasn't Long Chen's blood; it was the devil expert's hand that had split open from the impact.

“I gave you a chance, but it’s too bad that you didn’t use it well!” Long Chen looked at the “wound” on his shoulder and smiled.

Long Chen hadn't made any attempt to protect himself. In this case, his essence blood had instinctively formed a defensive barrier, but it could only intercept a fraction of the attack's power.

When the sword’s impact reached his bones, all the marks on his bones radiated a brilliant light. As a result, the devil expert’s attack was unable to harm his bones in the slightest, unable to even leave a mark.

“You…!”

The devil expert stared at Long Chen in bewilderment and suddenly had a bad feeling. Just as he was about to turn and run, Long Chen flicked his finger.

In the blink of an eye, a ray of seven-colored divine light pierced the devil expert’s head, and his lifeless body crumpled just like that, leaving his Eternal divine weapon still lodged on Long Chen's shoulder.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran could only stare in silence, their excitement surging. In just a few days, their boss had strengthened himself to the point where even Eternal divine weapons couldn’t harm him.

Suddenly, a flame lotus appeared in Long Chen’s hand and covered the sky, causing all the half-step Eternal experts’ expressions to completely change.

“Run!”

They shouted at the heavenly geniuses of the devil race gathered before the gate.

Long Chen’s flame lotus emitted an icy divine radiance as it hurtled toward the gate like a shooting star. Its target was precisely the geniuses of the devil race.

These talented disciples were seated in front of the gate, seemingly undergoing some kind of baptism. By the time they realized that the flame lotus was falling on them, it was too late.

BOOM!

White flames devoured those heavenly geniuses, and they didn’t even have a chance to resist. In an instant, they were reduced to ice fragments.

Long Chen’s flame lotus was unleashed at lightning speed, requiring no noticeable gathering of energy. Thus, even those half-step Eternals were unable to react in time to stop it.

“Hehe, after the violet blood Meridian Opening, all my divine abilities and magical arts can be unleashed almost instantaneously. Haha, it’s finally time for me to be a badass!” Long Chen’s expression was icy cool on the surface, but he was cheering excitedly inside.

Before his Meridian Opening, to unleash such an attack, he would have been required to prepare his meridians first, or risk injuring himself. Following that, he would need to draw in Heavenly Dao energy, combine it with his flame energy, bolster it with his Spiritual Strength, and then launch the attack.

However, with such powerful meridians, there was no need for it to be so complicated. He could just draw Heavenly Dao energy into him and merge it with his flame energy. The attack could then be directly unleashed.

Long Chen had harnessed his own body as the bow and the merged flame energy as the arrow. As for his meridians, they functioned as the bowstring. By merely drawing back the string, he could promptly release the arrow, resulting in the instantaneous unleashing of the World Extermination Flame Lotus.

“Ahh!”

Out of the hundreds of thousands of the devil race’s top disciples, only a few dozen managed to escape. However, even in their escape, they were not spared as white flames engulfed their bodies, eliciting agonizing screams.

“Damn human race! You dare to ruin my devil race’s affairs!”

A furious roar came from the other side of the gate. It seemed that whoever was on the other side knew what was happening here.

“Did I ruin your affairs? Then I’ll slaughter everyone from your devil race right now. If you have the ability, come and bite me!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Long Chen sneered and took out the Seven Peak Sword. Upon seeing it, the devil experts’ expressions immediately changed, and even the half-step Eternal devils directly fled. No one from the devil race remained.

“What…?”

The human expert who had just warned Long Chen was completely dumbfounded. He had felt despair upon being surrounded by so many powerful experts, but in the blink of an eye, even the half-step Eternal devils were gone.

Witnessing this, experts from other races were equally astonished. Long Chen's party consisted of only three individuals, yet he had instilled such terror in over ten half-step Eternal devils that they weren’t even thinking about avenging the deaths of their top disciples.

“Damn, why are they so gutless?”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were flabbergasted. They had wanted to see the sight of Long Chen fighting over ten half-step Eternals, but to their amazement, the opposing side had scattered in sheer panic, not even hesitating for a moment.

However, thinking about it, it made sense. After all, their opponent was no ordinary human; he was a monster who could receive Eternal divine items with his bare body. Running in terror was the only logical response here.

As all the surviving devil race experts hurriedly retreated, the space in front of the gate was now vacant. The white ice fragments around were still ablaze—the aftermath of the Ice Soul Divine Flame. The Ice Soul was quite domineering and wouldn’t go out until its target was fully incinerated.

Long Chen’s group walked to the gate, and a wave of primal chaos qi blasted them, causing their clothes and hair to flap around.

“Damnable human race, you won’t be able to stay arrogant for long! Once the gate opens, all that awaits you is death!” Another roar came from the other side of the gate.

Long Chen suddenly closed an eye, and a three-flower image appeared in his open eye, looking through the crack in the gate.

“One, two, three… Hehe, five Heaven Venerates and thirty-five World Kings. Alright, prepare yourself!” Long Chen then put away his Three Flower Pupil with a chuckle.

“Alright!” At this moment, Xia Chen took out thirty-six formation discs and placed them in the air according to a set distance. In the time it took for an incense stick to burn, he was done and nodded to Long Chen.

In the meantime, further curses erupted from the other side of the gate. As they were unable to go through the gate, they could only vent their frustration in this manner.

While Long Chen’s group of three set things up, the experts from other races could only watch in bewilderment, uncertain of the trio's intentions.

Buzz.

Xia Chen suddenly crushed a talisman, and divine light enveloped his body. At the same time, Guo Ran summoned his golden battle armor.

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen shouted. The next moment, the formation discs that Xia Chen had set up exploded and enveloped the three of them in divine radiance. With its protection, they surged forward against the current of primal chaos qi.

“What?!”

“Are they…?!!?!”

As a sense of astonishment settled over the spectators, they suddenly heard startled cries from the opposite side of the gate, coupled with the ominous sound of blades penetrating flesh.
