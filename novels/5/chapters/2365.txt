Chapter 2355 Playing Matchmaker

Translator: BornToBe

Zi Yan’s face reddened slightly and she waved her hand. “No need, no need. I…”

Long Chen rose from his seat. “Fairy Zi Yan, no need to be courteous. It just so happens that I have a few words I wish to say to you.”

Since he had gotten up, it wasn’t convenient for Zi Yan to continue declining. She waved goodbye to everyone else and walked away with Long Chen.

Once they were gone, Tang Wan-er finally said, “‘No need to be courteous, it just so happens that I have a few words I wish to say to you?’ I really look down on him.”

Tang Wan-er’s mocking made Meng Qi and the others laugh. Meng Qi asked, “What, are you jealous?”

Tang Wan-er curled her lips. “What is there to be jealous about? That bad scoundrel even needed you to remind him. It seems his skills have declined.”

“Really, you’re not jealous?” teased Chu Yao.

“Really. Big sisters, trust me. I also like big sister Zi Yan. Of course, I also like big sister Rushuang and big sister Ziyue…”

“Stop, stop, this matter has nothing to do with me,” exclaimed Beitang Rushuang. “Although Long Chen’s decent, I won’t be sharing a man.”

She had heard the suggestion in Tang Wan-er’s words. She didn’t want any such misunderstanding between them.

Although she did like Long Chen, she had her own pride. On her path to the top, she didn’t even know how many heavenly geniuses had prostrated themselves before her. However, she had not seen one she favored, and she would not be sharing the one that she liked. She was clear on her own character. If she didn’t find a suitable person, she was fine continuing to be alone.

“I am the same. The reason I helped Long Chen is partly because I like his loyalty and heroism, but I am only willing to listen to his orders because the Sovereign favors him. The Sovereigns will always be my greatest belief. The Sovereigns have an even higher position in my heart than gods. For a Sovereign to call him brother, I am willing to protect him with my life, but it has nothing to do with romance,” added Nangong Zuiyue.

“Ah? Then that’s too bad,” said Tang Wan-er.

Seeing her disappointment, Beitang Rushuang curiously asked, “Why would you want us to end up together? Aren’t you worried about Long Chen being pulled away by someone else?”

“If you want him, then take him. If you join us, we’ll get stronger. Long Chen… he has a lot on his shoulders. I wish for more people to share his burden,” said Tang Wan-er, getting emotional toward the end.

A person’s character wasn’t so easy to change. She remained someone of a jealous nature. But for Long Chen, she was willing to suffer.

Seeing her sincerity, Beitang Rushuang was moved. She held Tang Wan-er’s hand. “For Long Chen to have someone like you is definitely thanks to the fortune that he had accumulated for eight lifetimes. You all treat him better than he deserves.”

Nangong Zuiyue nodded as well. Women understood women the best. They were able to understand Tang Wan-er’s heart the most, and it was that understanding that made them feel especially moved.

The few of them were sitting behind a sound screen with Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Liu Ruyan, Dong Mingyu, and Cloud. On the outside, the Dragonblood Legion was eating happily without knowing what was happening on their side.

Tang Wan-er began to tear up. “The real fortune was for us to meet Long Chen in our lives. It is because of Long Chen that us sisters can be together. I am really happy. But Long Chen is different. He has many secrets in his heart that he has never shared because he doesn’t want to burden us. He has a great deal of pain inside, but he doesn’t show it, only suffering in silence. In our hearts, he is the only one. However, his heart doesn’t just have us, but all those brothers out there who are willing to follow him to the death. He is a fool who is willing to risk his life for any one of us and any one of them. Others see him as a peerless hero or a vicious fiend. He is admired and feared. But he also has times of fear and indecisiveness. He is afraid of losing us, so he doesn’t dare to stop his footsteps. He is constantly pushing himself onward. Although he is tired, we don't know how to help him with that burden. So when Long Chen participated in the Dongfang family’s gathering of past and present heroes, I told him to… do as he pleased.”

At that time, Tang Wan-er had told Long Chen not to have any misgivings about her, even encouraging him to do what he wanted to.

Hearing that, Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue exchanged glances. Beitang Rushuang sighed, “You feel so deeply toward Long Chen, but Long Chen feels the same way toward you.”

“Hm? What are you talking about?” asked Tang Wan-er, not understanding.

“I was wondering why Long Chen seemed like he had a mental problem when he encountered me for the first time,” said Beitang Rushuang with a smile. She explained their first interactions.

At that time, upon encountering Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang, he had meticulously maintained a certain distance, especially toward Beitang Rushuang. In particular, his repeated warning that he wouldn’t give her his heart over and over again had been used perfectly, almost driving her insane with rage.

Now that she thought back to it, she realized why he had been acting like that. He hadn’t wanted to draw anyone else’s attention, so he purposely gave them a bad first impression.

In that gathering, he was essentially the weakest. Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang were peerless geniuses who had suppressed their entire eras. All the ancient heavenly geniuses had come out. In his most helpless time, when even Tang Wan-er would rather suffer for Long Chen to pull in some reliable supporters, his pride had been provoked. Since when did he need to rely on seducing women to survive?

That was why he didn’t bother giving them a good impression when he first encountered them. It was the opposite. He was as crude as a rogue, and it had worked so well that Beitang Rushuang had almost lost control and shot him full of holes several times.

Hearing Beitang Rushuang’s explanation, Tang Wan-er was both happy and sad. She knew that her character wasn’t too likeable, which was why she was particularly afraid that Long Chen would stop loving her, creating a negative cycle.

She hadn’t thought that after she had given him her permission, he would intentionally pull away from peerless heavenly geniuses like Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue.

“Big sister Beitang, big sister Zuiyue, why not be with us? Why do we have to separate?” asked Cloud.

Meng Qi and the others smiled at her innocence. Although Cloud looked the same as Dong Mingyu, she was still a child and didn’t understand these things.

“Who said that we would separate? We’ll definitely be together often, especially against the dark era. No one knows if we’ll even survive as a Sovereign candidate has yet to appear. Hence, talking about romance isn’t for me. I am the heir of the Beitang family. I, Beitang Rushuang, am going to make some big moves to make sure future generations remember me forever.” Beitang Rushuang stood and patted her bow. “Sisters, there’s not much time left. We just saw another kind of realm from that red-haired man, so I’m going into seclusion. With my comprehension from this battle, I believe I will quickly reach the second step of Netherpassage. You all have to work hard too.”

After saying that, Beitang Rushuang hugged the crying Tang Wan-er. “Little sister, don’t cry. Work hard on your cultivation. Within this chaotic world, power is everything. If you want to love someone, the most important thing isn’t for him to know, but for him to live.”

“Yes, I’ll definitely work hard.” Tang Wan-er wiped away her tears and nodded cutely. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Nangong Zuiyue also rose from her seat and said goodbye. The others hastily got up to send them off.

…

Above a beautiful mountain range covered by an ancient forest, two figures slowly walked through the air.

“Actually, you don’t need to send me off. You’re very busy.” When Zi Yan looked at Long Chen, there was a faint redness on her cheeks that might just be their natural color. The Zi Yan today seemed particularly bashful and was especially enchanting.

Long Chen smiled. “That’s precisely why I am sending you off. I feel very relaxed with you. This way, I can forget all my vexations.”

Zi Yan’s blush deepened. She didn’t quite dare to look into Long Chen’s eyes. There was a hint of delight in her eyes but also unease.

“Do you remember when we first met?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

Zi Yan looked into the distance as if seeing through the years gone by. She covered up a smile. “Of course I remember. You’re definitely the person with the worst etiquette I’ve ever seen. I still remember how particularly amazing your answers to what the Dao, the Humane Dao, and the King Dao were.”

“Hehe, at that time, I was just spouting nonsense,” said Long Chen.

Seeing his embarrassment, Zi Yan couldn’t help laughing. Long Chen also had moments when he was cute.

“Zi Yan.”

Seeing her smile, Long Chen’s heart moved. He clutched her hand, causing her to stiffen. She looked at him nervously. “Long Chen… you…”
