Chapter 4066 Lost Heart-Devil

Long Chen was wary of his heart-devil suddenly trying to escape. Thus, he was rather reluctant to use the Earth Cauldron to refine pills, fearing that doing so would release his heart-devil. As a result, he suspected that his heart-devil was tricking him into fully opening the lid so that it would escape.

But to his astonishment, Long Chen eventually found that his heart-devil was truly gone, and the Earth Cauldron was completely empty. Even when Long Chen double-checked, he could find no trace of his heart-devil’s existence.

“How? How can this be?”

Long Chen was dumbfounded. His heart-devil was really gone? Had it been refined? However, Long Chen quickly tossed aside that thought. His heart-devil was another side of him, so it couldn’t just disappear like that.

“Did he escape when I used the Earth Cauldron to smash the hell gate?” Long Chen suddenly had a bad feeling. That was the only time the Earth Cauldron had escaped his control, which was also the only time the heart-devil had a chance to escape.

Long Chen felt a chill. Would he be like Leng Yueyan in the future? Would there be two of him?

Even after fully opening the Earth Cauldron, nothing happened. Long Chen was even hoping for his heart-devil to attack him. However, there was nothing like that; the heart-devil was really gone.

Long Chen was disappointed and frustrated, to the extent that even his delight at being able to use the Earth Cauldron to refine pills vanished. The disappearance of his heart-devil worried him, and somehow, he also felt like he had lost the most important thing to him.

Long Chen did resent and fear his heart-devil. But now that his heart-devil was gone, his heart felt empty. His soul was incomplete.

“Fuck, where could he have gone?! How could he leave without even saying goodbye?!” Long Chen muttered to himself as he examined the empty Earth Cauldron.

However, no reply came. Perhaps the Earth Cauldron knew where his heart-devil had gone. However, it didn’t tell Long Chen. It was like a weapon with no emotions, simply icy cold.

After a while, Long Chen suppressed his emotions. The fact that his heart-devil had disappeared was simply reality, but Long Chen believed that he would come to find him.

Without Long Chen, his heart-devil was incomplete. In the same vein, he was also incomplete without his heart-devil. Sooner or later, the two of them would have to face each other again.

Right now, what he needed to do was increase his own power, as he couldn’t afford to be beaten by his heart-devil.

Thus, Long Chen did his best to calm himself down. He then turned his attention to his next goal: refining pills with the Earth Cauldron.

When Long Chen sent flames into the Earth Cauldron, he found that there was no reaction at all. He then kept the flames burning for an hour, but the Earth Cauldron remained ice-cold.

“Tch, it seems that it’s still too early to use it to refine pills. I’ll need to use my flames to awaken its alchemy runes first,” realized Long Chen. With the cauldron still in slumber, unable to assist him, Long Chen would need to awaken the runes first.

As the heir to the Pill Sovereign’s memories, Long Chen naturally knew that this was a necessary step. With Huo Linger’s current power and his powerful Spiritual Strength, even a pill furnace that was a World Domain divine item would have its runes activated in the blink of an eye.

However, the Earth Cauldron had been in the middle of this process for an hour, and it didn’t even heat up in the slightest, let alone activate the runes. Seeing this phenomenon, Long Chen knew that it would be impossible to activate it without warming it up for a few days.

Long Chen then left the matter of heating the cauldron to Huo Linger. After all, he was in no rush. In order to not dwell on the matter of his heart-devil, Long Chen did his best to relax. He spent every day with Yu Qingxuan at the head of the ship, enjoying the scenery, or drinking with Guo Ran and the others. The rest of their journey across the heavenly river was treated as a vacation.

With them being on the Ghost Ship, the dangers of the heavenly river didn’t dare to bother them, directly fleeing at the sight of the Ghost Ship.

However, the Dragonblood warriors were still lively, and other than drinking wine with Long Chen, the rest of their time was spent on cultivation. They often exchanged pointers to corroborate each other’s theories.

After all, they had just consumed the Double Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits, and this rise in power was still new to them. Fully grasping it was not something that could be done in just a day or two.

As they merged this power with their own combat experience, they also trained their cooperation. The Dragonblood Legion was capable of following their boss because they were strong enough, and the important aspect of that was that they had to be able to make up for each other’s weaknesses. Together, they would unleash a combined power that was far greater than just a simple addition.

They knew that they were just normal people. The reason that they could reach their current level was, other than Long Chen’s contributions, thanks to them being able to work together flawlessly. Outside of the Dragonblood Legion, they were nothing compared to their enemies.

As the first gathered batch of Dragonblood warriors, they had to carry a greater burden on their shoulders, bearing the responsibility of finding more of their comrades and helping them return. But first, they had to find their old level of silent communication, letting the Dragonblood Legion become one iron plate once more.

Once all the Dragonblood warriors were fully gathered, with their combined forces, even a Heaven Venerate was an existence that they could challenge fearlessly.

During this time, Yu Qingxuan didn’t slack off either. She personally refined Immortal King Pills for everyone, and her pills were actually much better than Long Chen’s.

That was due to Long Chen not having the time to personally refine pills. The majority of his pills were refined by Huo Linger and his furnaces alone. When it came to alchemy, if you weren’t practicing, you were regressing. But Long Chen truly didn’t have that much time to spend on alchemy.

Yu Qingxuan was different. She focused on it and stubbornly went down the Dao of Alchemy. Otherwise, there was no way she could have refined a peerless grade golden pill at such a young age, shaking the entire alchemy world.

If Long Chen had the same focus on alchemy, his accomplishments would definitely not be inferior to Yu Qingxuan’s. However, he had too many things to do, and his attention was split across many things. He did not have Yu Qingxuan’s focus in this regard.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Other than that, Yu Qingxuan’s core flame was the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, and it was a very pure flame. On the other hand, Long Chen’s flame was an amalgamation of many flames. Its destructive power might be amazing, but for refining pills, it was like being a jack of all trades and master of none.

Yu Qingxuan spent her time refining Immortal King Pills. A portion were given to Xia Chen and the others, while the majority were kept for Long Chen. After all, Long Chen had told her that he would need an ocean’s worth of pills for when he started to raise his realm.

Half a month passed in this manner, and at this moment, the Earth Cauldron’s runes lit up, causing Long Chen to become excited once again.

“I can finally start! Let’s see what pills refined by a primal chaos divine item are like!”
