Chapter 2149 Jian Wuchen

Seeing the challenge, Long Chen stared blankly. Just who would issue a written challenge to him? When he opened it, he found that the challenge wasn’t issued toward him but to Yue Zifeng.

“Three days from now, in the Central Plains’ End of the Heavens Valley, Jian Wuchen of the Heavenly Sword Sect challenges Yue Zifeng.”

“Who is Jian Wuchen? Why would he challenge Yue Zifeng?” Seeing the challenge, none of the Dragonblood warriors understood.

“This Jian Wuchen is that masked sword cultivator who slew a supreme genius from the ancient era with one stroke of his sword,” said Long Chen, his expression serious. He had heard of this person from Qu Jianying.

“A sword cultivator!” Was this why he wanted to challenge Yue Zifeng? On the continent, the current brightest star of the junior generation’s sword cultivators was Yue Zifeng.

“Will Yue Zifeng accept the challenge?” wondered Meng Qi.

“Since the other side has issued such a challenge, he must be confident. Perhaps there’s some unknown reason behind this.” Long Chen clenched his fists.

“Long Chen, what are you thinking?” asked Meng Qi upon seeing Long Chen frown.

“This matter is coming too suddenly. Why would someone issue a challenge when the qi flow eruption is right around the corner?” Long Chen shook his head, feeling an intense feeling of danger.

“Then what should we do?” asked Meng Qi.

“We’ll keep acting according to normal. Three days from now, I’ll go take a trip to see what’s going on,” decided Long Chen.

The Dragonblood warriors were a bit disappointed that they wouldn’t be going, but they listened to his decision.

Just at this moment, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s transportation formation lit up. Three thousand Dragonblood warriors appeared on it.

“Haha, you’re finally back. Now it’s our turn.” The Dragonblood warriors on this side cheered.

The transportation formation had finally been successfully set up. This was all thanks to Xia Chen. Perhaps Xia Chen had worked himself to the point of white foam coming out of his mouth. He was really busy.

“Alright, it’s your turn. Hurry and get onto the transportation formation. Activating a double-sided transportation takes up a huge amount of energy. Don’t waste time!” shouted Long Chen.

The Dragonblood warriors on this side rushed over like a swarm of bees. The transportation formation was starting to shudder, and Long Chen was truly worried it wouldn’t work.

However, his worries were for naught. After a few seconds, space twisted, and those Dragonblood warriors vanished.

The three thousand Dragonblood warriors finally had a chance to rest. They had exhausted themselves, constantly fighting Magical Beasts or the devil race. Their taut nerves could relax at last.

“Xia Chen’s really amazing. He was able to set up a transportation formation to move so many people,” praised Meng Qi. Xia Chen was now someone the Dragonblood Legion couldn’t lose. He was very important to them.

“The barrier between worlds will need to heal. To activate this formation again will need at least seven days. Meng Qi, sorry, I wanted you to go too, but I’m a bit worried about the people here...” Long Chen looked at Meng Qi apologetically.

Originally, he had wanted Meng Qi to go to the Wild World and subdue a few Magical Beasts as housepets. With her powerful Spiritual Strength, she could control an army of them. That would make her power rise to a terrifying level.

However, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and Ye Zhiqiu were all in seclusion, and there were only three thousand Dragonblood warriors here. Long Chen wasn’t entirely at ease with just them here, so he had Meng Qi stay.

Having not discussed this with Meng Qi or even asked her opinion about it, Long Chen felt himself to be too tyrannical.

“A few days earlier or later won’t make a difference. With Wan-er and the others still in seclusion, I couldn’t go even if you wanted me to go.” Meng Qi smiled sweetly, knowing that Long Chen did care about her.

“How is Cloud these days? I haven’t seen her in a long time. I even miss that girl.” Long Chen smiled. Cloud had been in the Myriad Spirit Diagram for a long time now.

“She’s already in the final stages. However, to comprehend the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s strongest divine abilities and fully awaken her bloodline will probably take at least a month,” said Meng Qi. She was also full of expectations for Cloud.

The Myriad Spirit Diagram contained the strongest divine abilities of all kinds of races. Due to absorbing the Blue Eye Peacock’s essence blood, Cloud’s blood had transformed, returning to an ancestral state. She was the only one who had a chance to awaken her ancestor’s strongest divine abilities. If she did, she would be incomparably powerful.

Originally, Long Chen was planning on accompanying Meng Qi during this time and just peacefully passing the days. He rarely had time to accompany her.

However, Meng Qi, who understood what he was thinking, took the initiative in asking to refine pills with him. With the two of them working together, Long Chen was shocked to find that Meng Qi’s Spiritual Strength was now several times stronger than his.

Furthermore, her Spiritual Strength was incredibly pure. Even without summoning her manifestation, her power had risen to a shocking level.

With Meng Qi’s help, his efficiency in refining the Life Star Pills soared. He practically didn’t have to exhaust any of his own Spiritual Strength.

Meng Qi’s Spiritual Strength was replenishing itself as she used it. With her present, he could refine forever.

On this day, Long Chen finally came out of seclusion. Everything within the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was calm. They were all quietly cultivating.

Long Chen told Meng Qi and the others to stay on guard. Although the large powers were unlikely to start any battles with the qi flow eruption imminent, they still had to be careful.

Long Chen left, going straight toward the End of the Heavens Valley. It was a very famous location on the Martial Heaven Continent because many battles between experts had been fought there throughout history.

The End of the Heavens Valley was located in the Southern Xuan Region and was to the south of the Skywood Divine Palace.

When Long Chen flew by the Skywood Divine Palace, he saw the palace master speaking to the disciples about something. Due to the protective formation, he couldn’t hear what they were saying, but as he flew by, the disciples all looked up and saw him.

Long Chen’s flying boat was no longer the one he had plundered from Pill Valley, but a special dragon head flying boat that Guo Ran had made especially for him. It was like a golden dragon soaring through the sky and was very easy to recognize.

Long Chen stopped and bowed to the Skywood Divine Palace’s master from a distance. This was a bow in thanks for how she had treated Chu Yao like her own daughter for so many years.

The Skywood Divine Palace’s disciples all became emotional. Long Chen was the strongest and most famous expert of the current era. He was capable of competing with the heavenly geniuses of the ancient era and even came out on top. Due to various factors, Long Chen could be considered related to the Skywood Divine Palace due to Chu Yao.

This bow made the palace master smile slightly. Long Chen was still the old Long Chen. Even the endless slaughter that followed him hadn’t changed that wild yet pure heart.

After this bow, Long Chen smiled and waved to the disciples before continuing onward.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen is so handsome.”

“I feel like we should call him brother-in-law. Doesn’t that sound closer? He’s big sister Chu Yao’s husband after all. With his support, it would be easier for us to roam the continent in the future.”

The majority of the Skywood Divine Palace’s disciples were female, and they immediately began to chatter.

“Cough...”

At this point, one of the Elders loudly coughed a few times, and only then did the disciples reserve themselves a bit.

The palace master smiled looking at the excited disciples. Fortunately, Long Chen wasn’t in the Skywood Divine Palace, or these disciples of hers might not even have the desire to keep cultivating.

“My Skywood Divine Palace does not participate in worldly affairs, but we cannot miss the qi flow eruption. Sometimes it’s important not to pass on our responsibilities to others. I’ve gathered you today so you can see a battle between true experts,” said the palace master. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The disciples immediately began to cheer, causing one of the Elders to sternly shout, “Silence! The palace master hasn’t finished talking!”

Once people were quiet, the palace master continued, “Normally, I only ask that you calmly cultivate. I tell you not to cause trouble. This is to cultivate your heart. Being able to control your mental state is beneficial to your advancement. After all, the disciples of the Skywood Divine Palace are wood cultivators, and slaughter is against your cultivation techniques. However, this does not represent that the Skywood Divine Palace can escape battle forever. When the Martial Heaven Continent is in danger, we also have to bring out our own power. We cannot let an opportunity to strengthen ourselves go by. We have no intention of fighting against others, but we will not allow others to take away what is ours. I know some disciples from other sects have been provoking us these days, but I have not permitted you to attack them. That is because experts must know restraint. It is easier to counterattack when you patiently wait for an opportunity. You all saw, Long Chen is going to a battle between two sword cultivators. It is now time for the Skywood Divine Palace to make a collective move as well. We’ll show the world our power, or many people will want to bully us when the qi flow eruption occurs.”

The palace master slowly stood. She waved her sleeve, and eighteen beautiful women wearing emerald green robes also stood behind her.

“Move out!”
