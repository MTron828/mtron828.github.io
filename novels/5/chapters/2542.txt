Chapter 2531 Ye Ming’s Self Detonation

People suddenly noticed that at some point, Ye Ming had vanished. Even the Corrupt path’s disciples were curiously gone.

BOOM!

A black saber sliced through the void, revealing countless figures who had been hidden inside. Amongst the blood, people saw one figure in particular.

“Ye Ming!”

People were shocked to find that Ye Ming had actually brought the Corrupt path’s disciples away, hiding them within the void without anyone noticing.

Long Chen sneered as he slashed his saber at Ye Ming. “You want to leave? Are you dreaming?”

BOOM!

Ye Ming’s other arm exploded. At the same time, a wild qi wave exploded.

“No!” The Corrupt disciples instantly despaired.

In front of that wild qi wave, those disciples appeared incredibly weak and were instantly devoured. Just like the sea demon race, the Corrupt path’s disciples were wiped out.

“Long Chen, I’ll go all-out against you!” Ye Ming roared. Scales lit up all over his body, and his aura began to climb rapidly.

Long Chen was startled. This was clearly the sign of self-detonation. But this was too fast. He hadn’t forced him to this extent yet.

BOOM!

It was like a star had exploded. There was no time to get out of the way, and surging qi waves crashed over Long Chen.

“Not good!” Long Chen suddenly realized that what Ye Ming had detonated was not his own body but the corpse of the Heaven Devouring Fiend King. His true body definitely had a way to escape.

Long Chen was sent flying. Fortunately, the green leaves behind him folded around him, protecting him as he smashed a giant hole into the ground.

“Long Chen!”

“Boss!”

Meng Qi, Guo Ran, and the others immediately flew over. But they were comforted to see that Long Chen was wrapped by the green leaves.

The leaves crumbled, revealing Long Chen. He was safe. However, the power of the detonation of the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse had truly been shocking.

The Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples cheered upon seeing Long Chen safe and sound.

“That bastard Ye Ming, he actually wanted to drag the boss down with him. He should be thrown into a furnace that could burn his soul for eternity,” said Guo Ran hatefully. Ye Ming’s schemes came one after another. If Long Chen wasn’t strong enough, they all would have been killed.

“There might still be a chance to do that in the future,” said Long Chen.

“Eh? Boss, you mean he’s still alive?” asked Guo Ran.

“Someone as crafty as him wouldn’t die like this. Seeing that there was no hope, he didn’t even bother trying. He gave up on bringing the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse with him,” sighed Long Chen.

As expected of an existence that could become a god. Ignoring his actual combat power, his scheming ability was something that few people could match.

“Boss, the others are retreating. Should we chase them?” Gu Yang suddenly noticed that the divine families, the ancient family alliance, and Pill Valley’s disciples were fleeing.

“Let them go,” said Long Chen after a moment’s hesitation.

“Boss, now is the best time to kill them. Once we return to the Martial Heaven Continent…” said Gu Yang.

He meant that they should kill the Pill Fairy, Feng Fei, and the others now. He had the support of the mother tree right now, as well as the assistance of the Luo Spirit race. Killing them all was not out of the realm of possibility.

In that scenario, the entire Martial Heaven Continent’s junior generation would only be them. The others would be dead and unable to say anything.

“Let them go,” said Long Chen. Killing them all to silence them was impossible. Ignoring whether or not some people could escape, there was no way Long Chen could do that to the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion.

“Alright.”

Since Long Chen refused to give the order, everyone only stood there, allowing Feng Fei and the Pill Fairy to bring their people away. As for the Luo Spirit race’s warriors, they were ignoring everything else. They were still too excited by the return to the mother tree.

This giant battlefield was in ruins. Countless corpses littered the ground, and blood stained the ground red.

However, a wave of green grass spread, absorbing the corpses and blood to give birth to new life.

In the distance, the Pill Fairy looked back at Long Chen before she vanished. Pill Valley had taken heavy losses as half their elites had died.

As for the divine families, their losses were no better. A million of their disciples had their lives buried here, and Zhao Ritian had fallen into Long Chen’s hands. As a result, Feng Fei’s expression was extremely ugly. She didn’t know how she was supposed to explain things when she got back.

Most importantly, they had made a fatal mistake this time. It was something even she couldn’t bear the responsibility for, so her emotions were extremely complicated. When she looked at the distant Long Chen, she felt a touch of fear.

This man that she hadn’t even placed in her eyes at first now possessed the power to terrify the entire world. She had truly made a grave misjudgment.

Feng Fei brought the divine families’ disciples away. Millions of disciples had fought on this battlefield. Those that could leave were now leaving, and those that couldn’t would forever rest here.

Perhaps they would still live in the dreams of their families. But when the news spread, it was unknown how many people would be unable to accept this cruel reality.

The Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance had won. But this victory was marred by heavy losses. Their joy at victory was quickly replaced by anger and hatred, as well as endless pain.

The Martial Heaven Alliance and the Xuan Beasts had lost over three hundred thousand of their disciples. Those brothers and sisters would never be returning, so some people couldn’t help but sob.

The current Martial Heaven Alliance was like a solid brick. Every one of the disciples felt a close tie to each other. Now that so many of them had died, they were forever parted by the veil between life and death.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, why did you let them go? Why not kill them as vengeance for our brothers and sisters?!” Suddenly, a person cried out, her voice hoarse with pain.

“Qing Qiu, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen definitely has his reasons.” Someone pulled her back, trying to comfort her.

Suddenly, the leaves on Long Chen’s back vanished and blood spurted out of Long Chen’s body. Countless wounds split open.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!” Everyone cried out in shock.

Long Chen waved his hand. “It’s not that I didn’t want to, but that I couldn’t or I would have been exposed. If Ye Ming was hiding and hadn’t left yet, he would return and fight us. Then we would be the ones to suffer.”

Long Chen’s body had long since reached the point of breaking down. The mother tree’s energy had been supporting him, but without it, he instantly lost his ability to fight.

“Sorry, senior apprentice-brother Long… I was wrong… I…” The disciple that had cried out immediately felt lost.

“Long Chen!”

Just at that moment, more cracks spread all over Long Chen’s body. Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan immediately sent their life energy pouring into Long Chen’s body.

However, they were shocked to find that their life energy was nothing more than a cup of water on a burning cart. Long Chen’s body was fracturing too fast for them to stop. Chu Yao began to panic.

Just at that moment, a branch reached out and touched Long Chen’s back. Vast life energy poured into his body, stopping the cracking.

Although it wasn’t a complete recovery, at least he was no longer gushing blood. A bit of luster returned to his eyes.

“Many thanks.” Long Chen nodded toward the prophet who was walking over.

The prophet suddenly knelt down, his left hand holding his right shoulder in an extremely ancient and solemn etiquette.

“Respected prophesied son, you are the god of the Luo Spirit race. Please accept our worship.”

Just like that, all the Luo Spirit race’s warriors, male and female, knelt on the ground toward him.

“Senior, I cannot accept. You’re cutting my lifespan like this. I still want to live a few more years…”

Long Chen tried to stop the prophet, reaching out to pull him up, but the prophet’s figure retreated a few steps without changing posture.

The prophet repeated the ancient rite nine times before standing. He was about to speak when rumbling rang out.

The prophet’s expression changed. Everyone looked up to see that the withered mother tree was beginning to fracture.

“Mother tree, you…” The prophet stared at the mother tree, forlorn.

“The mother tree gave her final life energy to me,” sighed Long Chen.

“The mother tree is the root of our souls. Is she going to fade away like this?” The prophet was filled with pain. His previous joy vanished.

They had just reclaimed their home, but now it was about to collapse.

“No. I might have a way,” said Long Chen.

“You…” The prophet immediately perked back up.

Long Chen slowly stood and walked over. He then returned the final bit of energy the mother tree was feeding him. Although his body almost shattered, this allowed the mother tree to keep the slightest seed of vitality.

As long as this seed was activated, the mother tree could be revived. Long Chen then walked up to the mother tree and slowly formed seals in front of the giant hole in front of him.

The space behind Long Chen split open, and a torrent of yellow soil poured into the hole.
