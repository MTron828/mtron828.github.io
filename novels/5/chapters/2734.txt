Chapter 2723 Zither Soul

Upon arriving at the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, Long Chen saw that all its experts were gathered in its main palace.

“Long Chen!”

Zi Yan immediately welcomed him, introducing him to some of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s experts other than the Music Master.

What Long Chen hadn’t expected was that there were thousands of senior experts from the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, all in the mid Heaven Merging realm and above. There were even quite a few late Heaven Merging experts. Zi Yan gave particular introductions to some experts that could be classified as living fossils, existences with even greater seniority than the Music Master.

Due to the transcendent position of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, they had no need for that many experts standing guard. As a result, successive generations of experts had sealed themselves, all to come out at this moment.

These living fossils didn’t reveal much emotion to Long Chen, but he could see a touch of coldness in their eyes. Long Chen’s expression also wasn’t very good in response. Were they putting on airs in front of him?

If it weren’t for giving Zi Yan face, he would definitely have left at that moment. He felt like there was something wrong with these people’s heads.

Zi Yan noticed his reaction and stealthily transmitted to him some information to explain the cause of their coldness.

In the past, the masters of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace had to retain their pure bodies. This did not just refer to physically but also spiritually.

While Zi Yan had never done anything with Long Chen, her heart had long since been bound to Long Chen. That was already a violation of their ancestral teachings.

Although the Music Master had said that these times were not normal and they couldn’t ask too much of Zi Yan, some of those old-timers were stubborn and did not accept such reasoning.

Due to this, the Music Master had even gone directly against some old-timers, turning hostile just to suppress this matter. Naturally, those old-timers wouldn’t give Long Chen a smile upon seeing him.

Thinking about this, Long Chen sighed. In the beginning, Zi Yan had thought that he was her devil star, and the Illusive Music Immortal Palace had forced her to try killing him. It was all for the position of palace master.

Although he could understand things, the malice deep in these people’s eyes seemed off to Long Chen.

“Long Chen, I have finally found the reason why the Southern Sea Zither refuses to acknowledge a master,” said Zi Yan directly to redirect things.

“Really?” Long Chen was delighted to hear that. Of the four supreme divine items that they had, only the Southern Sea Zither had failed to acknowledge a master. If it did, Zi Yan would naturally get stronger, and the power of the four divine items combined would be unimaginable.

“Yes, really. In the ancient battle back then, the Southern Sea Zither lost one of its zither souls, so it is no longer complete. Just yesterday, I entered the Ancient Battlefield and sensed a strange fluctuation from the Southern Sea Zither. I reported this to the Music Master, and the Music Master-”

The Music Master stood. “Let me explain it. The Southern Sea Zither lost one of its zither souls, so it cannot acknowledge a master. That zither soul is in the depths of the Ancient Battlefield. However, we are unclear about where exactly in the Ancient Battlefield it is. We can only let Zi Yan go into the Ancient Battlefield with the Southern Sea Zither to search for it. As long as we find the zither soul, the Southern Sea Zither will fully recover, and acknowledging a master will be simple. However, the problem is how to enter so deep into the Ancient Battlefield and take the zither soul without the demonic beast race noticing. A forceful attack is definitely no good, so we can only sneak in. And since it must be done stealthily, we can’t use numbers. Zi Yan wanted to go in by herself, but we felt it to be too dangerous. There need to be at least two people to look after each other. Zi Yan didn’t wish to bother you, but we forced her. If she has no one to accompany her, we will not allow her to take such a risk. After all, she is the hope of the entire Illusive Music Immortal Palace and the hope of the Martial Heaven Continent. She cannot be lost.”

Long Chen nodded. “Of course. I will be the second person. I’ll accompany her.”

“Then you should go quickly to avoid anything unexpected arising,” said an old crone suddenly.

Long Chen glanced at her. She had a sharp chin and faint eyebrows. There was an indescribable expression in her eyes. In Long Chen’s words, this was no good egg.

He didn’t know if it was because they had been buried in the earth for too long, but these old-timers all had ill expressions, making Long Chen feel uncomfortable.

The junior generation of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace were all beautiful and refined, charming and graceful. Just looking at them made people relax. But these old experts lacked that refinement.

“This matter is extremely important. We cannot be sloppy. We’ll need to come up with a plan first,” said Long Chen.

Of course he couldn’t enter just like this. He had just finished refining pills and had yet to use them to advance. At the very least, he needed a few days to increase his realm a bit.

For the two of them to sneak into the Ancient Battlefield, the heart of the demonic beast race, was incredibly dangerous. One mistake and they would leave their lives there, so Long Chen naturally had to make his preparations.

“Senior, it seems that you’ve very impatient?” asked Long Chen, staring at the old crone.

Upon hearing this, her expression darkened and she barked, “How can I not be impatient? This relates to-”

“Shut up!” The Music Master’s expression sank. “Shut your mouth!”

The old crone fell silent. It seemed that her seniority was extremely high though, so she turned and left. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Once she was gone, the Music Master turned to Long Chen. “My apologies. Elder Song has always been very dissatisfied with Zi Yan’s matter. I will apologize on her behalf to you.”

“It’s fine. Junior can understand. But some things cannot be solved by rushing. They must be taken step by step. We no longer have the slightest leeway, so we cannot be careless,” said Long Chen.

“I understand. Elder Song is being unreasonable. It’s just that she’s been sealed for too long, and perhaps she… Well, anyway, I hope you can understand.” The Music Master pointed to her head, indicating that the old crone’s head was perhaps no longer flexible, hoping that Long Chen wouldn’t be the same way.

Long Chen naturally didn’t quibble with her over this matter. The Music Master arranged a palace for Long Chen to rest for a few days, but Long Chen declined.

He then found an excuse to leave, saying that he needed to make a plan. They had to maintain their current deadlock. After that, he left with Zi Yan.

“All those old experts of yours want to kill me.”

Once they found a secluded place, Long Chen suddenly came to a stop and turned to Zi Yan.

“What? No, although they don’t like you, they shouldn’t want to kill you. Are you overthinking things?” Zi Yan was extremely startled.
