Chapter 3990 Slapping the Face of an Earth Venerate

A peak heavenly genius, Weng Tianyao, had been crushed to death by Long Chen. His thunderforce exploded like a beautiful firework within the banquet hall.

A lightning dragon then appeared on top of Long Chen’s body, opening its mouth and devouring all the lightning. Once the lightning was gone, it vanished as well.

Weng Tianyao was gone and his soul had been extinguished. Moreover, his final power had been devoured by Lei Linger. Seeing this scene, Weng Tianyao’s master was quivering with rage. He couldn’t believe that Long Chen truly dared to kill Weng Tianyao in front of his eyes.

At this moment, divine light flowed within Yu Xiaoyun’s eyes, and an inconspicuous small smile appeared on his face. Long Chen’s domineeringness finally caused Yu Xiaoyun to like him ever so slightly. This was the boldness a man should have.

“Long… Chen…!”

Weng Tianyao’s master roared. Suddenly, he shot toward Long Chen, and violent pressure exploded out of him, crashing down on Long Chen like the weight of the entire dome of the heavens. A withered sharp claw then reached for Long Chen’s face.

Seeing this, Long Chen was prepared for an all-out fight, but he suddenly relaxed as a figure appeared in front of him. That figure was the emperor of the Vermilion Bird Empire, Yu Xiaoyun.

Yu Xiaoyun simply reached out and caught Weng Tianyao’s master’s attack. There was no explosion or wild qi wave, only a slight quiver in the hall. It turned out that Weng Tianyao’s master’s overwhelming power was absorbed by the hall.

Pow!

Just then, Long Chen let go of the Minghong Saber and ruthlessly slapped the face of Weng Tianyao’s master.

Weng Tianyao’s master didn’t see the slap coming. Let alone when his attention was focused on Yu Xiaoyun, even if he was fully focused, he might not necessarily be able to dodge this move.

Long Chen’s slap contained immense power. Thus, with an explosive sound, Weng Tianyao’s master smashed into the wall like a meteorite.

BOOM!

As the entire hall shook, its runes flared. In the end, the hall was undamaged, but Weng Tianyao’s master was flattened from smashing into the wall and hung there like a painting.

When an expert from the Violet Thunderclap Empire went to tear him down (yes, tear him down), they saw that his head was deformed.

It was like a frog that had been run over by a wheel. They could no longer tell what his original shape was supposed to be. There were imprints of quite a few runes on his body now.

Those were the runes from the wall. When he smashed into the wall, the defensive formation automatically activated, condensing those runes.

Weng Tianyao’s master was now unconscious, which caused the other experts to be stunned. They were unable to imagine just how powerful Long Chen’s slap had to be in order to cause such an effect.

In truth, while Long Chen’s power was terrifying, there was no way that he could compare to a three-flower Earth Venerate in peak condition.

However, Long Chen’s timing was perfect, striking just as Weng Tianyao’s master’s power was dispersed throughout the hall by Yu Xiaoyun.

That was precisely his weakest moment—when he had expended his current energy and had yet to summon new power. Furthermore, Long Chen hadn’t held back with his slap. All his power solidly struck his face without the slightest waste.

Actually, Weng Tianyao’s master had automatically triggered his three flowers to protect him, otherwise, anyone would be directly blown apart by the power of this slap.

“Your Majesty, what is the meaning of this?! We came as guests from so far away. You are practically bullying us!” shouted an expert from the Violet Thunderclap Empire. While he was shocked and enraged, he was also afraid.

If Yu Xiaoyun’s temper got the best of him, there was no way that they would survive. After all, this was the capital of the Vermillion Bird Empire. If the killing formation was activated, not one of them would leave to tell the tale.

The only reason that they had dared to be so arrogant was because according to their calculations, the Vermilion Bird Empire wouldn’t dare to actually attack them. But now that the emperor had personally joined in the fight, they were deeply afraid.

Yu Xiaoyun snorted. He was about to reply when his gaze suddenly fell on Long Chen.

“You can talk reason to them.”

After saying that, Yu Xiaoyun returned to his seat as if nothing had happened.

For a moment, everyone was simply stunned, including Long Chen. What medicine had this old fellow taken today?

As for Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin, their expressions were a bit odd. They then exchanged a look, seeing the other’s astonishment.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, Long Chen didn’t care about all that. He just sneered at the diplomats, “Bullying? What about what you’ve done? Is that not bullying? As for guests from far away, does whether or not you’re a guest have anything to do with distance? Aren’t you the ones who are most clear about whether or not you are guests? Why don’t you tell me what you’re here for? To mock? Bully? Oppress? Suppress? Probe? When you came to our home to bully us, did you expect us to just take it?”

“We were talking reason! When did we ever mock, bully, oppress, and suppress the Vermilion Bird Empire?!” raged one of the three-flower Earth Venerates.

“Talking reason? When we talked reason with you, you used your fists. Now that we’re replying in kind, you want to talk reason. When we talk reason again, you act like arrogant show-offs. However, now that I’m doing the same, you act like innocent victims. I am not that idiot Philosopher Sun. Not one of us here is some easy target for you to bully, so don’t bother with your childish schemes. You want to play such games with your little bit of intelligence? It must be nice not to care about others laughing at you. Peace between empires has never been gained through begging or talking reason. True peace is obtained through mutual respect and gratitude. But you eight empires came not as guests, but as bullies. You wanted me to be exiled to probe the attitude and strength of the Vermilion Bird Empire. If the empire takes a step back, you press them further. If the empire stands up for itself, you threaten the empire with your combined forces. To put it frankly, unless the Vermilion Bird Empire continues to concede over and over again, the only option is war. You are simply looking for an excuse to launch a combined assault on the Vermilion Bird Empire.”

“What nonsense! None of us was even thinking of such a thing! That’s entirely your own speculation!” barked an elder.

“Do you dare to swear that on your three-flower manifestation?” asked Long Chen.

“You…!”

The three-flower manifestation could not be sworn on lightly, as it was what connected the cultivator with the heavens. To swear on it was to swear on the heavens, so the heavens would judge whether or not the cultivator betrayed this oath or not. Not one person who had ever betrayed such an oath had a good ending. Thus, no three-flower Venerate would make such an oath.

That elder turned completely red. In his panic, he had no idea what to say, and that was already proof of what Long Chen said. Seeing this, the princes and princesses of the empire were even further incensed. This was truly bullying.

“Your Majesty, is this the attitude of your Vermilion Bird Empire?” The elder from the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire coldly asked, “Does the Vermilion Bird Empire really want to fight all eight empires at once? Do you wish to go to war? Are you not afraid of the Vermilion Bird Empire being wiped off of the map?”

“Hahaha!” Yu Xiaoyun suddenly laughed. After laughing, his face suddenly became covered in frosty killing intent. “If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”

“Good! Good! Good!”

That elder of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire then exchanged a look with all the other Earth Venerates who had come. After that, all the diplomats stood and left gloomily, leaving the banquet hall quiet once more.
