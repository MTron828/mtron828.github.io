Chapter 4595 Unable to Take a Single Blow

Long Chen’s clenched fist emitted a piercing soundwave as boundless power surged within him, far surpassing his previous limits.

However, consumed by fury, Long Chen didn’t even notice this. He was only thinking about reclaiming his bloodlines.

BOOM!

The middle-aged man’s palm easily blocked Long Chen’s indomitable power.

Despite blocking Long Chen’s full-powered attack, the man remained unshaken, and the impact forced Long Chen to spit out a mouthful of blood.

Long Chen seethed with rage as he realized that the blood he had vomited out was no longer rainbow-colored. Moreover, he couldn’t sense the familiar fluctuations of his violet blood. Because of the shock, his vision dimmed, and he nearly passed out.

The seven-color Supreme Blood and the violet blood had vanished. While the middle-aged man had forcibly strengthened him, both his bloodlines were gone.

“I really don’t understand why the great Dragon Sovereign would take a fancy to a fool like you,” commented the middle-aged man as he waved his hand.

BOOM!

Long Chen felt an irresistible force send him flying. Like a flat stone, he skipped across the magma and smashed into the wall of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Long Chen felt like all his bones were about to break. That one attack almost shattered him.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen let out a primal roar, and starlight enveloped his body. With a forceful slam of his hand against the wall, he propelled himself back toward the middle-aged man, not realizing that he was capable of fully becoming astral now. Before this, he could only materialize an astral fist or astral arm.

However, now that his entire body had reached that level, it could be considered a divine weapon. An endless starry river coursed through him.

The middle-aged man’s palm intercepted Long Chen’s fist again, triggering an explosive shockwave that caused the magma sea to churn. Waves surged outward from the point of impact between their fist and palm.

“Return my bloodlines!”Long Chen bellowed, his astral energy pulsating with increasing intensity. His power surged higher and higher, causing the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest to tremble.

For a fleeting moment, a hint of emotion flickered in the middle-aged man’s icy gaze. However, it vanished as quickly as it appeared, replaced by a disdainful snort.

With a shove, he sent Long Chen flying back into the same spot with ten times the power.

This time, Long Chen smashed straight through the wall, creating a new channel in the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Blasting through multiple walls, he didn’t even know how far he went before he stabilized. By then, he found himself in a different nest.

As he came to a halt, Long Chen spat out a mouthful of blood, his fury igniting like never before. It was his first time experiencing such humiliation. His bloodline was given to him by his father and mother, but it was tossed aside like trash. With a deafening roar, Long Chen prepared to charge back, determined to reclaim what was rightfully his.

“That’s about enough!” At this time, the Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out.

“What do you mean, enough? Do you think that this is meaningless?! My body is a gift from my parents and can’t be harmed! If I couldn’t even protect my own bloodline, how can I have the face to remain in this world? How am I supposed to face my parents?” roared Long Chen, his voice hoarse with rage.

However, that middle-aged man was too strong. Long Chen was like an ant in front of a dragon, having no ability to resist.

It was his first time feeling so powerless. He couldn’t even protect what was most precious to him.

“Fool, who said that your bloodline is gone?” sighed the Earth Cauldron.

“What?”

Startled, Long Chen tried to sense his body closely, but he found himself unable to detect any fluctuations from his bloodlines, let alone access their divine abilities.

Enraged, Long Chen was about to voice his frustration when he suddenly noticed two runes that had inexplicably appeared on the surface of his heart.

“This is...”

One rune was seven colors, and the other was violet. Long Chen was delighted to sense the fluctuations of his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood inside of them.

“That fellow was going to switch out your blood in the magma sea, erasing your seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood, making you a pureblooded member of the dragon race. However, he underestimated the human race’s bloodlines. When your bloodline was unable to resist, they chose to enter hibernation. They are waiting for their chance to reawaken and take their rightful place. Even your bloodlines were capable of enduring and retreating when they encountered an undefeatable foe, but you are like a fool who only knows how to attack despite knowing that you can’t win. It’s the pinnacle of foolishness,” sighed the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing that, Long Chen calmed down a bit and tried to sense those two runes closely. After sensing their fluctuations, he finally relaxed.

“Senior’s teachings are correct. I was a bit foolish this time.” Even Long Chen felt a bit embarrassed and scratched his head. “I should apologize to that senior.”

“Hmph, he doesn’t like you anyway. If it weren’t for some special reasons, he would have killed you,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“So, what does that mean for me? Am I still supposed to subdue the Sovereign scale?” asked Long Chen. If that fellow really didn’t favor him, there was nothing he could do.

Long Chen sensed disdain and contempt from that fellow’s eyes. It became clear that persuading him to hand over the Sovereign scale would be more challenging than ascending to the heavens.

“Ignore him. You have finished the first step in subduing the Sovereign scale. If you can defeat him, he'll have no choice but to surrender the scale, whether he wants to or not,” advised the Earth Cauldron.

“Defeat him? Is that even possible?” asked Long Chen. He was a confident man, but he was profoundly aware of the difference between him and the middle-aged man. There was an uncrossable gulf between them.

“It wasn’t as if I said to defeat him now,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

“You mean to have me...?” Long Chen suddenly thought of something.

“Yes. Undergo tribulation and then go beat him. That is the only way you can defeat him,” answered the Earth Cauldron.

“But Netherdragon Tianzhao and the others...”

“Don’t worry, they also need to undergo tribulation first before subduing their ancestral scales. Other than that, challenging the Sovereign scale requires gaining the qualifications to challenge it. You have obtained that qualification now, so before your challenge fails, no one else can get close to the Sovereign scale,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing that, Long Chen relaxed. If that was the case, then there was no rush.

"Let’s go. Time is precious. We have more important things to do,” said the Earth Cauldron. Long Chen nodded and set off.
