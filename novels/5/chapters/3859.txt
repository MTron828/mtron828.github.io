Chapter 3848 Three Eye Giant

Xia Chen was dumbfounded. He had set up a formation to confine death qi, but what was coming out was primal chaos qi.

Fortunately, he reacted quickly and changed his hand seals. Hundreds of talismans then flew out, taking the place of the original ones he had set up. The gushing primal chaos qi was firmly locked in.

“How could there be primal chaos qi?!” exclaimed Xia Chen.

Fortunately, he was fast enough, or if this much primal chaos qi suddenly appeared, people would definitely notice.

“I don’t know!”

Mo Nian wiped off some sweat. He had deduced that it should be a Netherworld expert buried inside here. But somehow, instead of death qi, primal chaos qi was the one coming out.

His Thousand Illusion Spirit Coffin had no defensive ability, and it could only be used as a disguise. There was no way for it to lock in the primal chaos qi. If they were exposed, all their efforts would be for naught.

Fortunately, Xia Chen reacted quickly enough, and the primal chaos qi was sealed. The four of them immersed their bodies within this primal chaos qi.

“Guo Ran, you can’t absorb the primal chaos qi now. If you end up activating your Heavenly Dao Crown, we’ll be exposed!” Seeing Guo Ran absorbing the primal chaos qi, causing a crown to slowly appear on his head, Mo Nian hastily stopped him.

Guo Ran hastily stopped. Only then did the Heavenly Dao Crown slowly fade. Guo Ran was currently only a single step away from condensing a Heavenly Dao Crown.

The primal chaos qi here was continuing to surge out, delighting Mo Nian and the others. They had just opened a single crack from the coffin and already made such a gain.

Mo Nian, Yue Xiaoqian, and Xia Chen delightedly absorbed it. Only Guo Ran was forced to just watch.

Looking outside, Mo Nian saw that no one noticed anything going on here. He then carefully pushed open the coffin further. They stuck their heads in.

When they did, all four of them gasped. This coffin was its own world. There was a giant figure seated cross-legged within a ten-thousand-mile space.

This enormous figure almost filled this space. It was their first time seeing someone so big.

“Guo Ran, sorry for this. Help us keep watch. We’re going in to take a look,” transmitted Mo Nian.

“Don’t worry. Leave this place to me,” said Guo Ran.

He knew that he had the least use in this place, so it would be better for him to remain up here and be the sentry.

Mo Nian and the others carefully crept into the coffin. Once they were right next to that giant figure, they realized that it had three eyes. It was covered in black scales, but where its three eyes were, there was a single sword stabbed into it.

Clearly, that was the killing blow. However, although this three-eyed lifeform was dead, the pressure it gave off still made Mo Nian and the others’ souls hurt. It felt like it was radiating some kind of pressure, making it difficult for them to get close to it.

“What kind of lifeform is this? Why is it still so terrifying even in death?” Xia Chen wondered in bewilderment.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If such a terrifying lifeform was alive, it probably wouldn’t even need to attack. With a single sneeze, how many people within the heavenly tomb would survive?

“This should be the legendary Netherworld’s Tripartite race’s Three Eye Giant race. That was a race whose might once shook the nine heavens in ancient times,” said Yue Xiaoqian, carefully examining it with a trace of shock. She couldn’t believe that such a terrifying existence would be buried here.

“Sister Xiaoqian, what is the Tripartite race?” asked Xia Chen. Yue Xiaoqian’s learning stretched far and wide. There was practically nothing that she wasn’t familiar with.

“The Tripartite race refers to the race with three arms, three eyes, and three heads. Ah, the three arms here refers to three pairs of arms. The Three Arm race possesses terrifying physical bodies. It is said that their arms can raise the heavens and stretch all the way to the stars. On the other hand, the Three Eye race possesses magical abilities, which overflow from their eyes limitlessly. Their three eyes contain three different laws, and they possess amazing pupil arts. As for the Three Head race, it is said that they are undying existences, existences with the same longevity as the very cosmos. Whether it is the Three Arm, Three Eye, or Three Head race, they also have many branches within them. This fellow should be from the Three Eye Giant race. They not only possess terrifying pupil arts, but their physical bodies are also very powerful,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

“Don’t look at its eyes!” shouted Yue Xiaoqian suddenly.

Unfortunately, her warning came one step too late. At this moment, Xia Chen coughed up blood. Yue Xiaoqian then waved her hand, and a white light barrier appeared in front of Xia Chen.

Mo Nian was also affected. He bent his waist and dry heaved, almost vomiting.

“What just happened?” asked a pale Mo Nian.

“The Three Eye Giant’s eyes might be closed, but even its eyelids possess innate blood runes. The moment you looked at its eyes and used Spiritual Strength to investigate, it drew out an automatic counterattack,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

“You can’t even look at its eyelids? Then what would happen if it opened its eyes?!” exclaimed Xia Chen. This was an incomprehensibly terrifying existence.

“Fuck, I also got affected. Even if a fallen lifeform’s physical body doesn’t decay, their blood should have already congealed. They shouldn’t have a consciousness to counterattack. Something is definitely off here,” cursed Mo Nian hatefully. Just then, he had been drawn into a manifestation and had seen something absolutely vile.

“The Three Eye Giant might be an existence with power beyond anything that we’ve ever seen. We have to be careful,” said Yue Xiaoqian a bit worriedly. The realm of this Three Eye Giant already exceeded their current understanding.

“We can’t care about it. Now, help me look after things. I’m going to start my archaeology.”

Mo Nian took out a set of tools. He then put on gloves and a belt that was covered in pockets and recesses for an ax, chisel, pincers, brush, tweezers, and other tools.

He also put on a strange set of chain mail. Once he was wearing this chain mail, he actually managed to directly jump onto the Three Eye Giant’s shoulder, completely disregarding its pressure. In front of Yue Xiaoqian and Xia Chen’s shocked gazes, he took off one of the Three Eye Giant’s earrings.

Then it was the wrist protectors, the heart protecting mirror, and a giant wolf-tooth club beneath its buttocks. It went without saying that Mo Nian truly had some skills. With his tools, he could even lift up such a giant body without the slightest effort. His movements were practiced and easy.

After gathering those treasures, he began to study the sword stuck between the three eyes. However, after studying for it a long time, in the end, he didn’t dare to touch it.

“It’s too bad. I don’t dare to take this corpse. If Long Chen saw it, he would definitely start drooling. Ah, whatever. I’ll have Long Chen take it later,” said Mo Nian helplessly.

Long Chen liked to gather corpses. This was known to all. Regretfully, no one dared to take this corpse. They left it as it was.

The three of them then summoned their manifestations and quickly absorbed all the primal chaos qi here. After that, they crawled out.

They had just come out when they heard a huge explosive sound. A figure then shot toward them. It was Long Aotian.
