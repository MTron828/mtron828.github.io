Chapter 3621

BOOM!

Long Chen and Guo Ran rushed to the west of Hongying City. They destroyed a palace and violently tore up the ground. This was the treasury of the Luo clan.

“Boss, you’re too brilliant! You even found this place!” Guo Ran cried out emotionally when he saw endless spatial trunks full of treasures.

“What brilliance? The Luo clan set up spies within the human race, but the dean also wisely played the same move and set up spies in the Luo clan. Without someone to provide support, how do you think we could so smoothly transport ourselves in? That fellow was also marked as a higher-up of the Luo clan. With a single soulsearch, all their secrets are exposed,” said Long Chen.

Only then did Guo Ran realize that this was all Xue Yifan’s preparations. He prostrated himself in admiration toward the dean. As the dean had said, everything was already prepared for Guo Ran. The dean had only been waiting for him to erupt.

However, thinking carefully, even if the dean had prepared this path for him, he wouldn’t be able to do it as well. He didn’t have Long Chen’s terrifying power

In truth, what Guo Ran didn’t know was that according to Xue Yifan’s plans, the best opportunity to make their move would only be after three to five years.

However, due to Long Chen arriving, the plan had changed. Everything was moving in advance. At this time, it could be seen just how terrifying Xue Yifan’s stratagems were.

The Luo clan’s people went crazy when they saw the treasury was exposed. They charged at Long Chen, but the starry river warriors stopped them. They were completely unable to get by. It was unknown just how many people were torn apart in this wild rush. Blood then soaked the city.

Guo Ran was gathering the spatial trunks as quickly as possible. He didn’t even care about anything else. To have been hidden by the Luo clan, these things were definitely treasures. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

On the other hand, Long Chen was rapping the walls with his hand. He quickly heard an echo from one area. The wall was clearly hollow.

“Boss, are there even better treasures?!”

Guo Ran had sucked away all the spatial trunks. Seeing Long Chen’s actions, he was even more excited.

Long Chen took out the dagger once more and cut it across the wall. When a large hole appeared, Guo Ran cried out in shock.

“Devil dragon black metal!”

This wall contained another trunk, and it was made out of devil dragon black metal and was supported by formations as well. Long Chen didn’t know how to unlock these formations, so he could only cut through them with his dagger.

“Damn, what is this dagger made out of?! Even devil dragon black metal is as weak as paper in front of it!” Guo Ran’s expression changed.

It had to be known that he was full of confidence in his Devil Dragon Battle Armor. Although he knew that Long Chen’s dagger was terrifying, he had not expected it to be so sharp. Even devil dragon black metal was cut through like tofu. Hence, Guo Ran lost confidence.

“Only a ghost would know what this thing is made of. Back then, it almost took my life. Although I don’t know its origins, such a thing is definitely extraordinarily rare. Your luck isn’t so bad, so you likely won’t run into a weapon like this. Don’t worry about it,” said Long Chen.

Despite not knowing this dagger’s origins, Long Chen could sense that it most definitely had an astonishing backstory.

“Why are there only two sheets of paper?” Guo Ran found that this trunk actually had nothing inside it other than two thin pieces of paper covered in words.

At first, he had thought that it was perhaps for some cultivation technique. But then he saw the top sheet was actually a list of names.

“Could it be…!” Guo Ran was shocked.

“Yes, it’s a list of traitors of the human race. Only the leader of the Luo clan is aware of its content. That leader should be rushing over here right now, hehe. Everything is under control. As for the other sheet…” Long Chen was just about to pick up the second piece of paper.

Just then, Hongying City quivered.

“Hahaha, they’ve arrived. Let’s go take a look.”

Long Chen and Guo Ran flew out of the treasury. There was a chaotic battle outside. As for outside the barrier, it was vaguely possible to see countless battleships. The seven Qingying Battleships were attacking the barrier at full power.

Seven rays of divine light converged on one point, and a concave depression appeared in the barrier. It seemed that they were trying to forcibly open a hole in the barrier. That way, they might be able to get through the apocalypse level of the barrier.

“Boss, let’s have a decisive fight with them today!”

Seeing that it didn’t seem likely for them to be able to get away from that huge lineup, Guo Ran’s battle intent soared.

“No need. They are dogs driven into a corner. If we really fight directly against them, even if we win, we’ll pay a steep price. After all, this particular battle is an internal battle within the human race. Even if you die in this battle, your name won’t go down in history as anything famous. That’s unfair to the starry river warriors. Gather everyone, and we’ll charge out the other way. I’ll open the path.” Long Chen had Guo Ran give orders, while he went to the other side of Hongying City.

Hongying City was filled with corpses. The starry river warriors were crazily chasing down the traitors of the human race.

As Guo Ran gave orders, they once more gathered. Like a furious arrow, they shot in the other direction.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s dagger stabbed into the barrier, instantly piercing it. Everyone then rushed out of it.

“Get onto the defensive battleship!”

Long Chen shouted. Guo Ran had long since summoned the Heavenly Dragon Battleship. This was the highest level battleship of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, and it was a defensive battleship.

Everyone jumped on. Just as they got on, they heard a huge explosion behind them.

BOOM!

If the barrier was simply pierced through by the black dagger, it would continue functioning. But due to Long Chen piercing the barrier while the Luo clan’s people also blasted an opening in the barrier at the same time, the barrier instantly lost any stability. It exploded.

The Heavenly Dragon Battleship was sent flying by the impact. It crashed through dozens of mountains, leaving a long gulch in the ground that spread all the way beyond the horizon.

As for Hongying City, the explosion directly blew it into pieces. Other than the Qingying Battleships, the other battleships were directly struck by that explosion and blown apart.

The detonation of the formation was like a sun exploding. Its destructive power caused the entire Alldevil Star-Field to quiver.

The Heavenly Dragon Battleship tumbled back an unknown distance away before crashing into a mountain and suddenly collapsing. Guo Ran and the others came flying out wretchedly like peas thrown out of a bowl.

“Damn, if it weren’t for the Heavenly Dragon Battleship, we’d have been killed!” Guo Ran was green with fear.

The other starry river warriors were now badly injured. Their battle armors were severely damaged. Even within the Heavenly Dragon Battleship, they had received an immense impact. That explosion was truly terrifying.

“Run!”

Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He had Guo Ran summon another battleship, and they rushed off.

Long Chen and the others had just flown into the air when they saw black clouds gathering in the distance. A terrifying aura made their souls feel cold.

“The Alldevil race has finally appeared.” Guo Ran and the others’ hearts rose up their throats.
