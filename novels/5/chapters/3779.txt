Chapter 3768: Chosen by the Heavens?

“Careful, this is the final wave of the heavenly tribulation! Hold on-!”

One of the demonic beasts shouted a reminder, only for another lightning beast to tear him to pieces.

Thousands of experts undergoing tribulation together would naturally cause its power to rise, and the extent of the increase was not limited to just a dozen times. For this many experts to undergo tribulation together, there was naturally a high chance of them being wiped out. However, while their tribulation looked mighty, it wasn’t particularly powerful. This was only the third wave.

Anyway, this was just a normal tribulation. If you compared this with the tempo of Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation, it was nothing more than a drizzle.

An ordinary person’s tribulation usually had three waves, each wave stronger than the last. If they could pass through all three, they would have succeeded.

However, this third wave was clearly more terrifying than they had imagined. Those lightning beasts descended from the nine heavens with murderous auras, crazily attacking them.

As the lightning beasts attacked, the demonic beasts collapsed. Amongst those terrifying lightning beasts, one in particular was very terrifying. It was in the shape of a lightning dragon, and not a single person was capable of blocking its attack.

This lightning dragon was Lei Linger. She finally found a chance to kill.

In just a few breaths, thousands of experts were reduced to a few dozen. This heavenly tribulation was too terrifying. They all despaired.

Even the Divine Venerates in the distance sighed as they watched this. They didn’t dare to try interfering in this tribulation or say anything, afraid of the karma from the heavenly tribulation locking onto them.

However, what shocked people was that the lightning dragon suddenly stopped massacring the demonic beasts. It actually changed sides, devouring the other lightning beasts. Seeing this scene, the demonic beast experts were stunned.

Only Long Chen knew that Lei Linger’s goal was to devour as many of the lightning beasts as possible. She had killed the demonic beast experts first, so they wouldn’t absorb too much of the tribulation’s power.

However, she also couldn’t kill them all because once they were all dead, the tribulation would end. She only left a few stragglers.

As Lei Linger devoured the lightning beasts, those stragglers that were in despair were revitalized. They fought all-out, blocking the lightning beasts with all their power. Although they didn’t know what was going on, this slight chance was worth fighting for.

This third wave contained the true essence of the heavenly tribulation, and these lightning beasts were all Immortal King realm existences, the perfect nourishment for Lei Linger. As she had received a full-power attack from a Divine Venerate before this, which caused her body to crumble, a great deal of her core energy was lost. Facing this third wave, she had not just replenished her core energy, but her power was also crazily rising.

However, even with Lei Linger devouring the lightning beasts, there were so many of them that the remaining twenty-some experts were quickly reduced to nine. That glimmer of hope that they felt faded.

“Hold on!”

Another expert shouted, only to be torn apart by a lightning beast.

All of a sudden, Lei Linger saw that those people were surrounded by lightning beasts. She panicked when she knew that they were going to be killed.

Hence, she barged in. With a rake of her claw, those lightning beasts exploded. In the end, one survivor of the demonic beasts remained.

Lei Linger protected him with her body as he devoured the other lightning beasts. An hour later, the lightning beasts were all devoured, and the tribulation clouds faded. All of a sudden, that person’s aura soared explosively.

“I… I advanced to the Immortal King realm!”

The surviving demonic beast looked at his surroundings in disbelief. He felt like he was dreaming.

Lei Linger released him and looked at him calmly. The distant demonic beasts, including the Divine Venerates, didn’t dare to believe their eyes. They had no idea what was going on.

“Could he be… the legendary chosen of the heavens? Did he have a heavenly lightning divine beast to protect him?” wondered a Divine Venerate.

“Quick, the heavenly tribulation is gone! Make yourself its master!” shouted another Divine Venerate.

That person only reacted now and shouted, “I am your master! Submit to me!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The lightning dragon’s tail instantly shot up in response. The demonic beast people were delighted, but that delight quickly vanished. That was because they saw the tail viciously smashing toward the sole survivor.

It was like a hammer striking a melon. Blood mist filled the air as that person was killed.

“Peh.”

The lightning dragon then spat on the remains of that person and its claw gestured disdainfully. Just like that, it vanished into the void, leaving behind a group of dumbfounded demonic beasts that were standing there like wooden statues. They didn’t know what to say.

“Hahaha!”

Long Chen and Jiang Lei couldn’t help laughing when they saw what Lei Linger did and the resulting dumbfounded expressions of the demonic beasts.

Lei Linger ate her fill and then actually looked at the demonic beasts disdainfully before leaving. Chosen of the heavens? Becoming her master? What a joke.

However, their laughter quickly faded away. That was because they saw the demonic beasts in the distance glaring at them with murderous gazes.

“They can see us?” Long Chen was startled.

“It seems so.” Jiang Lei fell silent as well.

Long Chen looked around and jumped. At some point, the surrounding blood-colored mist had vanished and the sky was clear. There were no clouds. He suddenly realized that he could see countless experts just like them staring blankly at the surroundings.

Long Chen’s formation disc was a mirror reflection formation disc. It reflected the mist around them so that it was as if they were merged into it. As long as they didn’t reveal their auras, they wouldn’t be seen.

However, now that the mist was gone, only they appeared to have blood-colored mist around them. Anyone who wasn’t blind could clearly see them.

“Damn human race, you did this!” roared a Divine Venerate.

“Even if we did, so what? What are you going to do? Come and bite me!” dared Long Chen.

With the mist scattered, Long Chen could now see a milky white ripple on the edge of the Heavenly River Blood Sea. This ripple was what separated the core from the outside. Only Divine Lords could cross through here, so Long Chen wasn’t afraid of them.

“Foolish human race, you’ll never understand just how terrifying the great demonic beast race is! All that awaits you is despair and death!”

The Divine Venerate snorted. He looked at them like they were already dead.

Just then, countless auras soared and demonic beasts crashed down on Long Chen from every direction. There were countless Supreme auras amongst them.

“The foolish one is you. I will use my actions to teach you what regret is.”

Long Chen’s blood instantly ignited when he saw these opponents. He turned and faced the oncoming demonic beasts.
