Chapter 3708 Too Many Wolves, Not Enough Meat

A life-and-death battle?

Countless people were absolutely shocked. There were endless heavenly geniuses here, and that meant there were countless conflicts as well. Big and small fights were a constant presence here.

However, no true life-and-death battles had been fought because all the major powers had experts protecting them. Their disciples might scuffle, but if their lives were truly in danger, their seniors would appear.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Although the heavenly geniuses all had their own tempers and were extremely conceited, none of them were willing to expose their trump cards in front of everyone. Hence, even if they encountered someone whom they had terrible enmity with, they would maintain their cool. They would settle things once they entered the three thousand worlds.

Thus, despite the constant conflicts, everyone restrained themselves. If they really were unable to do so, their seniors would appear and put a stop to their battle. That way, neither side would lose face.

As for something like what Long Chen was doing, directly declaring a life-and-death battle, it was very rare. So, everyone went quiet, staring at Long Chen in disbelief.

All the people with the stalls set up around them put away their wares, and they came over to watch. Countless experts guessed whether or not they really would fight.

“Interesting. That He Changtian is one of the seven Heavenly Ruler Seal Princes. The Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire has seven Supreme princes this generation; it is an unprecedented era for them. They’ve grown a great deal. Before this, they were basically a subordinate, a pitiful dog wagging its tail. Now though? The dog has a strong backer and is going to bite its master,” said someone with a mocking expression.

When it came to the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire, many people actually knew some information. This empire originally wasn’t powerful and had done their best to maintain a decent relationship with the Vermilion Bird Empire. In truth, they only survived thanks to the Vermilion Bird Empire’s protection.

Considering that they bordered each other, the Vermilion Bird Empire had no choice but to protect them. If their enemies occupied the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire, that would be like having a tiger outside their door at all times, and they would have difficulty ever relaxing.

When it came to matters between empires, it was always profit that decided things. If two empires had a good relationship, that was simply because they were both sharing the profit. It was a matter of whether it was still mutually beneficial or not.

Currently, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire was soaring in power. In the last few years, they had started to target the Vermilion Bird Empire, making moves that the Vermilion Bird Empire could not accept. That resulted in the relationship between both nations turning frosty.

When the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s people surrounded the Vermilion Bird Empire’s people, everyone knew what was going on. But what people were unable to understand was why the Vermilion Bird Empire, with all of its power, would simply accept this provocation without retaliation. Were the rumors true? Were there inner conflicts between the Vermilion Bird Empire’s royals?

As things had grown to this extent, more and more people came to watch in anticipation of a good show.

“But Long Chen isn’t from the Vermilion Bird Empire. Does it count if he wins?” asked one person curiously.

“You don’t even know about this? Long Chen is a vicious character. In the Heavenly Flame World, he slaughtered enemies from all sides, and the majority of the lifeforms that entered the Heavenly Flame World were killed by him. In the end, he even slew Yan Xu’s son. The reason why he did so is because of Yu Qingxuan. At that time, no one even knew that she was the Vermilion Bird Empire’s princess. Also, didn’t he just say that Yu Qingxuan’s matters are his matters? Let me tell you, this Long Chen is a supremely terrifying figure. There will definitely be a good show to watch today.”

Everyone was privately discussing things amongst themselves. Many people didn’t recognize Long Chen at first, but others quickly informed them. Of course, there were also people who didn’t recognize He Changtian and were asking about him as well.

Long Chen’s group of three stood together, gazing at He Changtian coldly. Guo Ran stealthily stepped back half a step before being dragged forward by Xia Chen.

“A person can’t be too shameless. How much have you shown off already? Do you not know what boss is planning?”

Clearly, Guo Ran was trying to act like the pig to devour the tiger again. He wanted He Changtian to challenge him. He had greatly improved during this time and was thirsting for a powerful opponent to prove his power.

Xia Chen might be low-key, but he had also been the greatest genius within the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. He had his own pride. However, on the Nine Underworld Island, he had suffered immensely. That was a blow to his confidence.

Later on, with the help of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, he started researching ancient talismans, restarting and rebuilding his arsenal. Because of that, he had entirely new formation discs and trump cards and also wanted to test them on a peak expert.

During normal times, he wouldn’t fight over the spotlight with Guo Ran. But he urgently needed a battle to test his new products, to show his results.

Seeing Guo Ran and Xia Chen bickering over who was to fight, people were shocked. Some people mocked them, thinking that they were too foolish to not know just how powerful He Changtian was. They seemed to be frogs at the bottom of a well.

As for He Changtian, he was still blazing with killing intent. Long Chen’s group of three clearly didn’t place him in their eyes. That was a huge insult to him.

“Since you all want to die, fine. All three of you can come at me together! We won’t rest until one side is annihilated!” He Changtian coldly pulled his robes off, revealing a set of fiery-red battle armor.

“One of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s four national treasures, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor!” Yin Ting cried out in shock. She recognized this famous World Domain divine item.

The Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor was a scaled fire-attribute set of divine armor. Every one of its scales had a flame rune carved into it.

Moreover, every flame rune was made with the life flame of one flame attribute divine beast. Hence, when this armor was revealed, flames exploded out along with the roaring of ten thousand beasts. People’s hearts quivered.

An uproar then exploded amongst the people. He Changtian was actually challenging all three of them. Just how confident was he?

When this armor appeared, Huo Linger awoke. After transforming into a small flame dragon, she stealthily wrapped herself around Long Chen’s neck beneath his collar and stuck her head out.

“Big brother Long Chen, his armor is good. It has many runes that I don’t have. I want it. Let me out and I’ll devour him,” transmitted Huo Linger. She had set her sights on this armor.

Long Chen was speechless. Now even Huo Linger wanted to fight. But seeing Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s itchy appearances, how could he fight over this chance with them?

Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen, and a sweet smile gradually appeared on her face. As long as Long Chen was present, there was nothing in this world that she needed to worry about.

It was that way when she encountered Yan Hong last time, and it was the same this time. With Long Chen present, her heart was steady. As for the problem between both empires, she no longer even thought about it. She chose to fully trust Long Chen. As a result, she ended up feeling incomparably relaxed. It felt good to have someone to rely on.

Long Chen, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen looked at each other. All of a sudden, they stuck out their hands, causing everyone to jump. However, when people saw what they were doing, they almost collapsed.

“Rock, paper, scissors!”
