Chapter 3824 Subduing Ghost Lifeforms

Mo Nian, Yue Xiaoqian, and the others were stunned. They didn’t know what happened. That lifeform was begging for mercy, and it looked very pitiable.

It continued to cry out as if saying something, but no one could understand what it was saying.

“Long Chen, try checking its soul,” said Mo Nian. However, Long Chen remained silent, so Mo Nian couldn’t help asking, “What is it?”

“I’m afraid that this involves too much karma, and all of us will be implicated by it,” said Long Chen.

When Long Chen first saw the Grand Dao Flower, he was using the Purgatory Eyes. And if it wasn’t for Xia Guhong’s warning, he himself didn’t know what would have happened.

If he used the Purgatory Eyes here and saw something that he shouldn’t, there was no Xia Guhong to save him. He might die and even drag all of them down with him.

In this world, if a person wasn’t strong enough, seeing something that they shouldn’t see was fatal.

Before this, Long Chen hadn’t fully believed it. But after last time, he didn’t dare to look at certain things for nothing, especially things that couldn’t be controlled.

“Then see if you can have it hand over the map of the heavenly tomb,” said Mo Nian, agreeing with this. Some taboos shouldn’t be touched.

Even if nothing happened right now, the karma would be settled in the heavenly tribulation. Some things shouldn’t be touched. But if they could obtain a map, it would be much more convenient.

This lifeform seemed to understand Mo Nian. It shouted but no one understood.

Seeing that they didn’t understand, that lifeform suddenly stood on Long Chen’s head and repeatedly kowtowed. It then brazenly went to Long Chen’s wound and absorbed a drop of his blood.

After absorbing a drop of his blood, it once more shouted. This time, although Long Chen still didn’t understand what it was saying, he had a subtle feeling that told him what it was trying to express.

This Ghost Dao lifeform revered and feared him. After biting him, it was terrified out of its mind and begged Long Chen for mercy and to not kill it.

When it learned that Long Chen wanted a map of this tomb, it volunteered to help him lead the way. It would also give him a general map of this place through its descriptions.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, it wasn’t able to express itself very well. As for Long Chen, he was no master painter. After drawing the map based on its description, he himself didn’t even understand it.

After discussing it, they decided to allow this lifeform to lead the way. Long Chen said that he wanted it to lead them to where there were many treasures. He also took out some things so that it could recognize them.

This lifeform was actually quite smart and repeatedly nodded to express that it understood. It suddenly shouted at the other Ghost Dao lifeforms, and they began to lead the way as well. But it stayed on Long Chen’s shoulder, like the fox borrowing the tiger’s might.

Yue Xiaoqian actually found it funny. This lifeform looked like a human that was only three inches tall. Its eyes were light green, and its mouth was a bit sharp, with two sharp fangs. It had been such a yes-man just before but was now threatening the other lifeforms fiercely. It made it seem quite slick.

Those lifeforms floated through the path, with Long Chen and the others following. Curiously, with those lifeforms leading the way, the evil corpses roaming within the tomb began to ignore them. It was like they didn’t even see Long Chen and the others.

However, when they passed by those evil corpses, they could sense their terrifying auras, so they still shivered.

These were lifeforms from the immemorial era, and they all had terrifying auras. Long Chen and the others deduced that these evil corpses should only be in the World King realm, yet the pressure that they gave off was hundreds or thousands of times greater than ordinary Divine Venerates. Every single one of them might be a match for Silver Moon City’s lord.

There were hundreds of evil corpses roaming this channel. Sometimes, they would brush right past Long Chen and the others. It would be a lie to say that they weren’t afraid.

“The people from the immemorial era are truly powerful. If we lived in that era, with our current power, we probably wouldn’t even count as average,” whispered Guo Ran.

“Tch, that’s foolish talk. If we lived in the immemorial era, we’d still be the top experts of that era. Experts are always experts, no matter the era. The reason we are so strong isn’t because we relied on luck. We relied on power to continue growing. If we were in the immemorial era when the primal chaos qi was still abundant, we also wouldn’t be at our current level,” said Mo Nian very confidently.

“You can’t put it that way. The main thing is, would there be that many ancient tombs for you to dig up in that era?” retorted Long Chen.

“You’re arguing for argument’s sake!” cried Mo Nian.

Everyone laughed. Mo Nian lived for his grave digging, and the immemorial era probably wouldn’t have that many big tombs for him to excavate.

Suddenly, they heard a giant gate open. But when this stone gate opened, a berserk and terrible aura struck them. Long Chen and the others felt a terrifying pressure crash down on them, so they all retreated.

“What the?!”

Once they stabilized themselves and looked toward that stone gate, they couldn’t help crying out in shock.

Beyond the gate was a giant space, easily hundreds of miles wide. As far as they could, the walls were embedded with countless corpses.

Those corpses had been dead for countless years, but their physical bodies were still intact. Some of them were a bit wizened but still gave off terrifying auras.

At this moment, the ghost on Long Chen’s shoulder said something and gestured to him. Its two hands pressed together and then spread.

“It’s saying that there are many such areas in this place. Furthermore, this is one of the small spaces. There are bigger ones,” explained Long Chen.

Only then did they understand that when its hands were pressed together, it was saying small, and when it spread them, it was saying big. This little Ghost Dao lifeform was quite interesting.

“It also says that the biggest area has terrifying evil corpses guarding it. Their comrades have been eaten by those evil corpses, so we have to be careful,” continued Long Chen.

“Evil corpses can consume the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms?” asked Mo Nian in surprise.

Long Chen looked at the Ghost Dao lifeform. It once more spoke and gestured, pointing at its own eyes, opening its mouth, and putting on a ferocious appearance.

“It’s saying that the evil corpses there can see them. They have some special abilities, and they eat them like rats,” said Long Chen.

Just from its frightened appearance, they could tell that it was very afraid of those evil corpses.

Once they walked into that spacious room, they saw that the walls were filled with notches, with every notch holding a corpse. They looked around, but they didn’t see any corpses of the human race.

“Devil race, Blood race, Nether race, Underworld race, half-beast race…” Mo Nian eyed the corpses, identifying which races they were from.

When he came to a half-beast expert, that corpse suddenly opened its eyes and jumped out of the wall. Seeing this, Mo Nian jumped in horror and instinctively smashed his shovel at it.
