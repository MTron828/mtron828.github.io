Chapter 1938: 1938

After merging the Life Star Beads, the astral space would naturally appear . This astral space could be likened to an embryonic minor world .

Condensing an astral space also indicated that you had advanced to the Life Star realm . At this time, they needed to absorb as much thunderforce to strengthen their astral spaces . The more thunderforce they could absorb, the larger their astral spaces, and the more world energy they could produce in the future .

Moreover, the five-colored lightning was an extremely powerful tribulation . This kind of lightning was something that not even every Netherpassage expert faced .

This kind of powerful lightning would cause one’s astral space to become much larger . It was several times more effective than regular lightning .

It would usually only appear in a Netherpassage expert’s tribulation . It was very rarely seen in the Life Star realm .

The original devil race’s experts had come to the conclusion that Long Chen had ordered the attacks against the heavenly tribulation specifically for this five-colored lightning . Just as they were feeling praise for his foresight, Long Chen’s shout left them dumbfounded . He actually didn’t want people to absorb this five-colored lightning?

“Boss, I really can’t do it . Please lend me some Spiritual Strength . I feel like my head is going to split open . Look, big sister Meng Qi helped Gu Yang, so how can you let me lose face?” pleaded Guo Ran .

Long Chen was speechless . Although Guo Ran’s Spiritual Strength wasn’t special, it wasn’t so terrible . He definitely had the power to pass on his own . However, his willpower was too weak . He felt like he was out of energy, when in truth, he had at least forty percent of his Spiritual Strength that was still untapped .

His laziness resulted in him not excavating his own potential . However, Guo Ran had never been a person with great willpower . Or perhaps it should be said that his willpower was never used on cultivation .

Helplessly, Long Chen stealthily gave Guo Ran a bit of Spiritual Strength . He even had to make it so that the others couldn’t sense it .

In the whole Dragonblood Legion, less than a hundred people had yet to finish their merger . They were all in the final stages though, so Long Chen had no choice but to help Guo Ran .

Guo Ran’s body suddenly lit up, and his aura changed . That was a sign of finishing the merger . After the merger was complete, he seemed to become another person, no longer looking as pitiful as before . Looking at the warriors that had yet to finish, he called out, “Brothers, are you alright? To wait for you, I suppressed myself as much as I could, but I couldn’t hold it any longer . Work hard . Success is just a little bit away . Remember, we’re the strongest warriors of the Martial Heaven Continent, and nothing can stop us...”

As Guo Ran shamelessly cheered on the warriors that had yet to finish, Long Chen sighed inside . However, very quickly, the final Dragonblood warrior finished the merger

“Xiaoqian, attack the tribulation clouds,” said Long Chen .

“Me?” Yue Xiaoqian jumped in shock . She was from the original devil race, and the Heavenly Daos of the Martial Heaven Continent rejected her . She was already getting special attention from this tribulation . If she attacked it, the consequences were unimaginable .

“That’s right . Go ahead, I’m here if you need me,” said Long Chen with a smile .

Yue Xiaoqian suddenly thought of when she had undergone tribulation in the Immemorial Path . Back then, because of four mysterious experts interfering, she had almost died during her tribulation . She had barely passed, and in his fury, Long Chen had attacked the lightning tribulation, enraging the heavens and even forcing those four mysterious experts to flee .

At that time, the heavens had chained Long Chen and bound him, however, he had torn apart the very fabric of the heavens . That was the moment Yue Xiaoqian’s heart was completely won by Long Chen . Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Seeing his smile, Yue Xiaoqian also smiled . As long as Long Chen was present, there was nothing to fear .

Her devil seal appeared on her forehead . After that, a ray of Sword Qi shot out at the heavens, accompanied by the specific energy of the original devil race .

The tribulation clouds were torn apart by Yue Xiaoqian’s attack . After seeing that, the expressions of Yue Xihan and the rest of the original devil race completely changed .

The original devil race’s experts were different from the Dragonblood warriors . They were rejected by the Heavenly Daos .

As expected, the heavens went calm for a moment, and the five-colored lightning slowly faded away . The tribulation clouds began to quietly brew . In the end, giant black lotus flower clouds began to bloom, forming dense layers in the sky . At the center of each lotus was flickering lightning .

A terrifying pressure grew . Yue Xihan and the others let out startled cries .

“Divine lightning!”

The lightning contained in these lotus flowers actually contained divine pressure . Even Netherpassage experts felt fear .

This wasn’t a matter of having the guts to face it as this was a spiritual suppression . Divine lightning was for ascending experts . In front of this divine might, it was impossible not to feel fear .

“The sacred daughter... . ”

The Netherpassage experts turned pale white . Yue Xiaoqian was the hope of the original devil race . If she died, what would happen?

At this time, Yue Xihan calmed down surprisingly . The fate of the original devil race was already intricately linked to Long Chen . Thinking of how smoothly things had gone until now, she felt it was a bit laughable to be so worried . She had already made her choice . She would leave everything to Long Chen .

Suddenly, the lotus flowers exploded, and lightning rained down like sharp swords .

The Dragonblood warriors’ bodies were blown apart, their flesh becoming a mangled mess . Even the Dragon Blood Battle Armor was unable to block this . Each drop of lightning was like a bomb .

Lei Long returned to its dragon form, wanting to devour this lightning . This was something that it really wanted .

“Lei Long, go eat to the side . Leave the middle to the others!” called out Long Chen . Although Lei Long didn’t like it, it went to the edges to devour the leftover lightning . The center was for the Dragonblood Legion .

“Don’t worry, now isn’t the time for your meal . Let others eat first,” comforted Long Chen . To everyone else, he shouted, “This lightning contains divine energy, so protect your heads . Use it to nourish your astral spaces . ”

Each drop of divine lightning was like a bomb, causing their flesh to explode . If it was someone else, a single drop would be enough to kill them .

Despite how much physical damage the lightning was doing, it would always transform into incomparably pure lightning energy after striking their bodies . Even without having to do anything, their bodies’ astral spaces would automatically absorb it .

If they actually focused on absorbing it, then the energy of this divine lightning would surge toward them like a flood, filling their astral spaces and making them grow .

“One meter . ”

“Three meters...”

“Ten meters...”

The astral spaces were like tiny worlds, while they were the masters of those worlds . They could clearly sense some kind of energy form a connection with them from this world .

As their astral spaces grew, that energy grew stronger . Although they were still unable to use that energy, they could sense that they were rapidly growing stronger . The larger their astral spaces, the stronger they grew .

“I want to get stronger!”

Gu Yang suddenly roared and spread his arms as if to embrace this world . He allowed the torrent of lightning to fall on him as he crazily absorbed the divine lightning .

“Be careful!” Long Chen suddenly shouted and flicked a finger . A lightning arrow shot out, knocking aside a drop of the divine lightning that was about to strike Gu Yang’s head . “Fool, make sure to protect your vitals . Otherwise, you might die!”

Due to his excitement, Gu Yang had forgotten just how dangerous this divine lightning was . If this divine lightning shattered his skull, it might cause his Yuan Spirit to dissipate .

“My bad, boss . ” Gu Yang blushed and properly protected his head .

The majority of the Dragonblood warriors were able to endure this torrent of lightning . However, the healing experts were in a miserable state . They were wood cultivators, and despite also possessing the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, their physical bodies were too weak . Each drop blasted bloody holes in their bodies . If three drops landed at the same time, they would be in danger of dying .

They were carefully blocking with their wooden staves, doing their best to make sure the lightning landed on them one drop at a time . Fortunately, their recovery abilities were amazing .

“Guo Ran, are you trying to get your armor destroyed?” shouted Long Chen at Guo Ran, who had tried stealthily putting on his armor .

Feeling like he was at his limit, he had summoned his armor to cheat, but as a result, two large holes appeared in his armor in an instant .

“But...”

“What buts? As long as I’m present, you won’t die, so hurry up and absorb the lightning!” ordered Long Chen .

Guo Ran felt helpless . Not even his armor could save him now . Each drop of the lightning was covering him in blood, breaking his bones . However, he actually acted tough and didn’t make a sound .

His previous attempt at showing off had ended up going so well that he wanted to prove to everyone that he had only been acting cowardly before . If he became weak now, it would indicate that he was actually cowardly, not acting .

Time passed slowly . Long Chen stood in the sky . If anyone was in danger, he would immediately go save them .

Long Chen didn’t mind the lightning that struck his body . It was barely an itch . After being rebuilt by the azure dragon essence blood, Long Chen’s body had reached an unimaginable level .

Finally, after two hours had passed, the healing warriors were no longer able to endure . Coughing up blood, they had reached their limit .
