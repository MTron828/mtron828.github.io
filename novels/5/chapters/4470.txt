Chapter 4459 Who Is the Idiot?

Bai Xiaole directly transported the Dragonblood Legion on the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. As his pupil arts were growing increasingly refined, even in this complex environment, he was still capable of easily transporting everyone.

It was all thanks to the elder of the Heavenly Eye race who had bestowed his inheritance on Long Chen. Wanting to respect that elder’s wish, Long Chen then passed the inheritance down to Bai Xiaole.

To tell the truth, Bai Xiaole’s talent was remarkable. However, a glaring flaw accompanied it—he had a penchant for playing around and an aversion to hardship, such a strangely familiar trait.

It was no wonder he was following Guo Ran everywhere; birds of a feather really flock together. Fortunately, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was keeping an eye on Bai Xiaole. Their connected souls allowed the fox to unleash its power through Bai Xiaole, but he was just too weak, limiting its potential Thus, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox compelled Bai Xiaole to work as if his life depended on it.

Approximately, eighty percent of Bai Xiaole’s power could be attributed to the support of the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox. When fighting alone, his strength would be way lower compared to when the two merged their abilities.

As soon as the Dragonblood warriors got in front of the nether dragons, they unleashed their sharpest killing blows.

They were like unleashed divine weapons. In just a few exchanges, the nether dragons were forced back, unable to break through the blockade, and dozens of their Eternal experts were cut apart.

This time, the Dragonblood Legion didn’t press the attack. After forcing the enemies back, they returned to their original location, guarding Long Chen.

At this moment, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was trembling intensely with Long Chen’s hands on it. This action left countless people stupefied. Could Long Chen truly control the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest?

If he really was capable of such a thing, then the nether dragon race would be in danger. After all, an attack from the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was not something that even the nether dragon race leader could block.

Thinking of this, many onlookers had a bad feeling and hastily fled. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest held unimaginable power; if Long Chen were to unleash it, the entire region would be obliterated. Time was of the essence—if they didn’t run now, it could be too late.

“You idiot, you can’t use the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!” shouted an elder of the nether dragon race.

The vice race leader whispered, “Ignore him. Let him waste his energy. We’ll kill him once he’s exhausted.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The vice race leader and other senior experts of the nether dragon race had noticed that even with Netherdragon Tianzhao’s essence blood, Long Chen couldn’t control the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Although its movement made them panic for a bit, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest’s nine core runes were still silent. They knew that unless Long Chen could activate all nine of them, he wouldn’t be able to control the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Seeing this, the vice race leader didn’t let others warn Long Chen, so he would be wasting his energy for nothing.

Runic chains flowed from Long Chen’s arms, intertwining and anchoring themselves within the nest. Once firmly bound, Long Chen pulled, and the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest slowly moved. The intense rumbling of the heavens and earth accompanied its movement, causing cracks to materialize in the void.

“What terrifying power!” startled cries resounded, as Long Chen used brute power to move such an enormous nest. That was absolutely shocking.

However, the nether dragon race’s experts wore sneers on their faces. Despite being shocked by Long Chen’s strength, they knew that brute power alone couldn’t control the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. It was a waste of power.

“Retreat a bit. Just help me hold the line,” said Long Chen.

Hearing this, Guo Ran and the others nodded and spread out while maintaining a defensive line around Long Chen. Anyone who dared to sneak attack Long Chen would be instantly blocked.

In front of countless shocked gazes, the enormous nest slowly moved, being lifted into the air.

The nest was truly enormous, resembling an entire world. Originally, it had been beneath Long Chen’s feet, but now it was slowly raised to the top of his head.

“What is he planning on doing? Is he going to use it to smash people?” frightened cries echoed. Astonishingly, Long Chen had successfully lifted the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

With his veins throbbing, Long Chen unleashed his full power. But as a result, the void beneath his feet fractured, unable to bear the immense weight of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was simply enormous. As it was lifted, it seemed so high above the nine heavens, almost reaching the stars. In the broader view, a single ant-like figure had lifted the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest—a scene so incredibly stunning that people would never forget in their lifetime.

“Idiot, if you think that you can use the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest to smash us, you are insane. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest is already locked in position. Once it leaves your hand, it will automatically go back to its original location,” sneered the vice race leader. He was very delighted to see Long Chen waste his energy.

Still, Long Chen’s power was truly astonishing. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest resembled an entire world, and any other individual would have been crushed attempting to lift it.

As Long Chen single-handedly bore the entire pressure of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, sneak attacking him now was their best chance. As soon as Long Chen was distracted, he would be crushed by the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

However, no one dared to take advantage of this opening. If he were to let go of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest suddenly, the attackers would also be crushed, and not even ten thousand backup lives would be enough to save them.

The void continued to rumble and shake, but no one knew what Long Chen was doing. At this moment, the cracks on Ye Ling’s seal grew, a sign that the nether dragon race leader was about to break free.

While Ye Ling didn’t know what Long Chen was doing, she chose to believe in him. She then gritted her teeth and summoned strange flames above her head. Despite the evident strain on her increasingly pale face, she burned her core energy to buy Long Chen more time.

In the distance, Little Crane was still dancing, though the radiant rainbow light surrounding her had diminished from its initial brilliance. Her aunts were covered in sweat, trying hard to persevere, but it didn’t seem like they would last much longer.

All eyes were fixed on Long Chen, yet everyone remained in the dark about his intentions. The entire world held its breath in anticipation.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void beneath Long Chen’s feet exploded, causing the enormous Ten Thousand Dragon Nest to rise several feet.

“Get in here!” Long Chen bellowed with fury. A colossal black hole materialized behind him, resembling a gaping maw as it gradually consumed the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

“What the fuck?!”

The spectators were left dumbfounded, their eyes nearly popping out of their sockets at the unexpected turn of events.
