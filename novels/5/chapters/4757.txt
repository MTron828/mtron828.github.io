Chapter 4746 Opening of the Gate

When the sharp sword struck Guo Ran’s chest, a chestplate instantly appeared on top of his chest, blocking the sword.

This armor had many dense scales on top of it—an attribute of Guo Ran’s hidden dragon triple-layer armor. However, no one knew how Guo Ran had condensed it into a chestplate.

Sparks flew when the sword struck Guo Ran’s armor. Despite the Lifehunter race's reputation for razor-sharp weaponry, their blade made no dent in Guo Ran's armor.

Just as the Sage King was shocked, a silent descent of Guo Ran's seven-color saber ensued. The Sage King raised his sword to block, but it directly exploded on contact with Guo Ran’s saber, becoming fragments that turned the Sage King into a sieve.

BOOM!

“Your weapons are excessively sharp, but they aren’t tough enough. In a frontal clash, they can’t do shit,” sneered Guo Ran, his left saber slashing out.

To Evilmoon’s astonishment, a saber-image shot out of Guo Ran’s saber as he swung it.

“What the fuck? He stole our technique!” exclaimed Evilmoon.

Long Chen shook his head. “No, I had taught it to him, but he used his own comprehension and understanding to create a new Split the Heavens.”

On the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen had taught Guo Ran the nine forms of Split the Heavens. During his lessons, he knew that Guo Ran was so lazy that teaching him this was like playing the zither for a cow.

However, Long Chen hoped that Guo Ran could merge his own insights into this technique. Back in the Alldevil star-field, Guo Ran had managed to do exactly that. However, now that his reliable support had returned, he started to slack again, not touching Split the Heavens again.

Hence, when Guo Ran used this technique, Long Chen was gobsmacked because this attack contained Guo Ran’s dragon blood power. In other words, Guo Ran had used some unknown method to force the lazy dragon inside of him to cooperate.

The saber-image streaked through the air, crushing the Sage King to dust. The leftover power of his saber then continued to strike the other Sage Kings, but they hastily blocked.

Only with several of them joining forces did they manage to block this attack. However, their formation was in complete chaos now.

“Out of the way! Leave them to me!”

Just as Guo Ran killed one of them and threw their formations into chaos, Bai Zhantang came charging over. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“All Encompassing Manifestation!” Bai Zhantang roared. The ghost creature behind him suddenly opened its mouth and stuck out a scarlet tongue.

Its tongue then split open, transforming into swords. Time seemed to stop, and the laws of the world froze. Even Long Chen and the others couldn’t move as the Sage Kings were obliterated.

The world fell into a deathly silence, and only after a couple of seconds could Long Chen and the others move. Guo Ran and the others simply stared at Bai Zhantang in shock. That move was absolutely terrifying, causing them to think that there was no way to block it.

After a moment of shock, Bai Xiaole shouted angrily, “What are you up to?”

The situation was already under control, and it was the perfect opportunity for them to showcase their abilities. However, Bai Zhantang had annihilated all the enemies. Bai Xiaole was unhappy that he didn’t get to test out his new toy.

Bai Zhantang simply sighed after killing them. It could be said that he had taken back some face, but Bai Xiaole’s shout made him blush.

“Xiaole, this isn’t a game. They are all terrifying assassins, so killing them as fast as possible is necessary to guarantee our safety,” explained Bai Shishi.

“Big Sister?” Bai Xiaole was stunned. Even he could tell that Bai Shishi was speaking up for Bai Zhantang.

Bai Zhantang also stared at his daughter in disbelief. In all his life, it was his first time hearing Bai Shishi stand up for him. He was so moved that he couldn’t speak.

“Boss, isn’t this strange? We just attacked the Cloud Rubbing Fantasy Sea. How could they recover this quickly and even have this many Sage Kings? It doesn’t make much sense,” asked Xia Chen.

The others also found it strange. These assassins had appeared with no warning at all, and Long Chen hadn’t expected such an attack.

“Furthermore, these Sage Kings didn’t seem as strong as we expected.” Guo Ran placed his sabers on his shoulder, crossing them behind him as if he were carrying a giant pair of scissors.

“That’s because they just came from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven and haven’t gotten used to the laws of the Heavenly Daos here,” explained Bai Zhantang.

This place had different laws from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Although the two worlds were connecting, they hadn’t perfectly merged yet, which resulted in a very large influence when crossing worlds.

Bai Zhantang was an expert of this land. After entering the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, he got used to its laws, so his return now only caused him a bit of discomfort. While it did affect his power a bit, it wasn’t too bad.

On the other hand, these experts had come from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, so the laws of this world affected them immensely. Based on Bai Zhantang’s estimation, they were at most capable of unleashing seventy percent of their power.

“That’s even stranger. They’re suppressed by the laws here, so why are they in such a rush to attack? Could they not wait until they grew accustomed to the laws here?” asked Bai Shishi.

Bai Zhantang shook his head and replied, “Who knows? If your mom was here, perhaps she could guess it.”

“You only know how to rely on mother and second mother. You can’t do anything yourself...” said Bai Shishi irritably.

Before, Bai Zhantang would have been greatly displeased. However, this time, he could discern that Bai Shishi’s voice wasn’t criticizing him; it was teasing him in a familial manner. This realization brought a smile to his face, and he chose not to respond.

“It seems they were in such a hurry to attack because if they waited any longer, they wouldn't have stood a chance. In that case, the most probable reason is that the gate to the ninth heaven is about to fully open,” Long Chen speculated after a moment of thought.

He had barely finished speaking when the world suddenly shook. All eyes turned toward a single direction as a pillar of divine light pierced through the sky's dome, illuminating the entire world.

“The gate to the ninth heaven has opened!”

Everyone, including Long Chen, felt their heartbeats quickening. A new world and a new challenge lay before them.
