Chapter 4556 Bloodline Heir

When Long Chen unleashed his killing intent, it felt like the world had dropped into the domain of death. Every person felt their soul shudder as if someone pressed an invisible blade against their throats.

Feng You and the others were utterly stunned. Long Chen’s killing intent possessed a physical force behind it, startling even the Heavenly Daos.

This showed that Long Chen had killed countless lifeforms. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to condense such a terrifying killing intent.

Feng You found herself looking at Long Chen in a new light, her eyes wide with astonishment. She struggled to reconcile this terrifying presence with the image of someone who primarily relied on concealed weapons and cunning tricks.

Glaring at this bald man called Wu Hun, Long Chen was overflowing with killing intent. However, he still hesitated on whether or not he should kill this traitor now. As Wu Tian’s little brother, Long Chen had a responsibility to help him wipe out traitors.

However, Long Chen also had something holding him back; he was not alone. The mixed beast race was here by his side. If a battle started now, it would definitely implicate the mixed beast race.

Although he hadn’t known them for long, he understood their characters. Once they started fighting, they wouldn’t retreat. Even if they knew they would die, they would not turn their backs to their enemies.

If Long Chen were to cause the deaths of the mixed beast race due to his own affairs, he wouldn’t be at ease. Under these conflicted feelings, Long Chen chose to leave the decision to Wu Hun.

If Wu Hun answered properly, Long Chen would accept it. If he didn’t, Long Chen would unleash his full power and kill all of them in the fastest time possible to keep the casualties to a minimum.

When Long Chen directed his threat toward Wu Hun, the latter’s subordinates brimmed with indignation. Never before had they encountered such blatant disrespect. The weapons they held trembled in their hands, reflecting their simmering fury.

Tension hung heavy in the air, suffocating any sound. Long Chen and Wu Hun locked eyes, their gazes icy and unwavering.

“I, Wu Hun, am a bloodline heir to the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast,” Wu Hun declared with a sneer. “I am answering your question not out of fear, but because my pride doesn’t permit me to lie.”

Feng You hadn’t expected Wu Hun to really answer Long Chen’s question. Although Wu Hun had said something arrogant in the end, Feng You could tell that Wu Hun was intimidated by Long Chen.

“A bloodline heir to the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast?” Long Chen’s heart shook. Wu Hun was clearly dodging the important point with this answer. However, how could Long Chen not tell the truth?

A bloodline heir? In other words, he wasn’t really part of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race. Long Chen now understood why Wu Hun only bore a slight resemblance to Wu Tian but was fundamentally different.

In other words, Wu Hun only had a portion of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race’s bloodline. As for where that bloodline came from, it was probably an absolute secret.

“My turn. What relationship do you have with the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race?” asked Wu Hun coldly. His gaze turned sharp.

“Have you thought this through? If I answer this question, you’ll need to answer another one of mine,” asked Long Chen lightly.

Immediately, Wu Hun’s expression changed. He had wasted his first question to get an absolutely worthless response, but Long Chen’s question had directly struck his secrets.

If Long Chen’s next question were to touch upon Wu Hun’s core secrets, would he really answer?

“Fine, we’ll stop here. Little fellow, I’ve remembered you. We’ll settle our business in the future,” replied Wu Hun gloomily.

His meaning was clear. He was no longer willing to exchange questions with Long Chen, and he also didn’t plan on fighting now.

However, the next time they met, there would be no misgivings; they would have a real fight. If he won, all of Long Chen’s secrets would be his.

To put it frankly, he had the same worries as Long Chen. He wanted a simple one-on-one fight with Long Chen, but the circumstances did not allow it.

Long Chen nodded. “Hopefully, we will meet again soon. I’m also very interested in you.” After saying that, Long Chen waved his hand. “Get out of the way!”

“You...”

The experts beside Wu Hun seethed with anger, but Wu Hun raised his hand, indicating for them to make a path for Long Chen and the mixed beast race’s people.

“Let’s go.” Long Chen swaggered past Wu Hun and the others, ignoring their furious gazes.

The mixed beast race felt the chills as they passed by. After all, Wu Hun’s subordinates were extremely powerful, surpassing the quality of the mixed beast race’s army by a lot.

However, despite their unease, they put on a strong front. This was their best chance to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.

With Long Chen leading the way, they walked past the camp of the Underworld race, attracting the shocked stares of many experts in the surroundings.

They all knew just how terrifying Wu Hun was. They were already prepared to get out of the way for him. Yet, as he showed no urgency to move forward, they just stood where they were. However, the moment Wu Hun’s army sought to advance, they would promptly clear the path for him.

Surprisingly, the terrifying Wu Hun actually got out of the way for Long Chen.

When Long Chen passed through, the people in front didn’t even wait for Long Chen to say anything and directly opened a path for him. What kind of joke was that? They couldn’t possibly provoke an existence that intimidated Wu Hun.

After passing through the third faction, Long Chen noticed that the factions in front no longer opened a path for them. However, Long Chen also decided to stop and have everyone rest there.

At this time, the mixed beast race’s experts were looking at him in a new light. Even the ones who liked to chat with Long Chen were now silent, nor daring to joke with him.

They were no fools. Although Long Chen had not displayed any of his power just now, just from his conversation with Wu Hun, they knew that his true power was not what he had displayed to them.

“Long Chen, thank you!” Feng You looked at him with a complicated expression and also a sense of loss. She now knew that Long Chen was a true expert.

From her point of view, Long Chen’s act of weakness was to look after her, helping her stand in the most glorious position in front of her people.

Reflecting on her previous words and actions toward him, she was overwhelmed with shame. How could she walk proudly now?

“There’s no need for thanks between us.”

Long Chen smiled and winked at her. He was really fond of this large beauty’s pure and straightforward nature. He found her presence comforting, although this sentiment had no romantic connotations.

While everyone rested here, Long Chen took out a formation disc, which revealed seven glowing runes. When Long Chen saw them, his smile widened. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
