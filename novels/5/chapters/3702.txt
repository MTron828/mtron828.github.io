Chapter 3691 Dreams Vanish Before Mo Nian

The flying boat quickly got closer. After a while, Long Chen saw two giant figures fighting. One was a humanoid giant a hundred miles tall, while the other was a bizarre lifeform.

This lifeform was like a fox and a dog. It had two heads, and its claws were as sharp as blades, leaving spatial cracks wherever they swept out. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“It’s an Ice Fire Fox Wolf.”

Long Chen was slightly surprised. This two-headed lifeform was an ancient demonic beast. One of its heads controlled flame energy, while the other controlled ice energy.

The Ice Fire Fox Wolf let out a furious roar. When both of its mouths opened at the same time, ice and flame energies erupted simultaneously. Two rays of divine light then shot at that giant.

BOOM!

A huge explosion shook the land. The ice and flame energies were shot out at the same time, yet they didn’t clash with each other. When they struck that giant, the two energies suddenly merged and exploded.

The cold of ice and the heat of flames merged, causing the void to splinter. This mixture of hot and cold was something that not even the void could endure.

As for the giant, he wore a beast hide and was fighting barehanded. At this moment, he actually used his bare body to receive this attack, which caused his upper body to turn red from the heat and his lower body to be covered in frost. He was sent flying.

After that, that giant spread his arms and let out a furious roar, blasting away the ice and flames covering his body. He seemed completely fine and once more charged at the Ice Fire Fox Wolf.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were both shocked by that. They had never seen such a terrifying physical body. This giant wasn’t using any magical arts and simply used his physical body to endure this attack.

It had to be known that let alone a body of flesh and blood, even a divine weapon would probably be shattered by that fusion of ice and fire.

Two enormous bodies then continued to clash. Their power caused heaven and earth to shake. But curiously, even this fierce clash was unable to damage the ruined buildings of the Violet Flame Heaven Capital.

According to reason, these buildings should be badly eroded by the passing of time and unable to endure a single attack. Yet, they seemed to be protected by some mysterious law.

“That giant belongs to the Wild Giant race. They don’t know how to cultivate and rely entirely on their physical bodies to fight. However, their physical bodies have natural Dao marks on them that function just like some kind of armor. Ordinary divine weapons are unable to harm them. In fact, some magical arts and divine abilities simply have no effect at all,” said Long Chen.

“Isn’t that just like Wilde? Speaking of which, boss, have you still not heard anything about Wilde?” asked Xia Chen.

Long Chen shook his head. “Wilde belongs to the Barbarian race. It is said that the Barbarian race was completely exterminated in the desolate battle. After the Barbarian King Ke Luo died, the Barbarian race’s warriors fought to the very last against their enemies. They were wiped out. I did see someone with the Barbarian race’s lineage in the High Firmament Academy, but his blood is extremely diluted. It was far from being able to be considered as part of the Barbarian race. I checked where he’s from, and they can only be considered a branch of a branch within the Barbarian race. By this time, they practically have no relationship with the Barbarian race. So right now, I don’t have any idea how to find Wilde.”

Long Chen was most worried about Wilde. This child didn’t have a home, so Long Chen didn’t know where that dragon expert had sent him. If there was no one to look after him, this foolish child would definitely end up suffering.

“Hopefully, we can run into Wilde in this opening of the three thousand worlds,” prayed Xia Chen.

“The opening of the three thousand worlds will cause channels to open throughout the heavens. Our current location is only one of the Violet Flame Heaven’s five entrances, and the other heavens have their own entrances. I trust that we’ll run into quite a few old friends inside, hehe. I’m looking forward to it!” Long Chen was also full of anticipation for this reunion.

Xia Guhong had told him that the opening of the three thousand worlds would cause entrances to appear in most places. Throughout the three Daos, six worlds, nine heavens, and ten lands, there were entrances all over.

However, the entrances had to be found before they opened. Otherwise, if they didn’t enter in time, the entrance would shut before they passed through. 

The entrances always appeared in different places. Also, some entrances could be sealed off by other factors, so people had to find a different entrance.

Some people might be so far from these entrances that they wouldn’t have time to detour. In the end, they would simply lose this great opportunity for nothing.

However, most people would be able to enter, so Long Chen was full of anticipation for this opening of the three thousand worlds.

BOOM!

The Ice Fire Fox Wolf once more attacked, sending the giant flying. However, unexpectedly, it turned tail and fled, vanishing without a trace afterward.

“What’s going on? It’s going to run before a victor is even decided?” Guo Ran couldn’t comprehend this.

Clearly, neither side had used their full power yet. The battle was ending before even coming to a climax.

“The Wild Giant race is the enemy of most devil beasts and demonic beasts. That is because the Wild Giant race relies on hunting to survive, and they often eat the beast races with powerful physical bodies to strengthen themselves. Because of this, the Ice Fire Fox Wolf instinctively attacked the Wild Giant upon meeting, but it was just a probing blow. If it really had the power to kill him, it wouldn’t let him off. For it to have run off, it means that it can’t beat the Wild Giant. It might even be in danger of being eaten. So it simply fled,” explained Xia Guhong.

“An instinctive attack? What’s up with that?” asked Guo Ran.

“Some races have inherited a kind of enmity, an enmity that is branded in their bones, their blood, and their soul. As soon as they smell the scent of those enemy races, they will instinctively attack. Some of those instincts are so strong that they will immediately start a life-and-death battle as soon as they meet. Our human race relies on our memories to remember enmities, but those enmities can easily grow dim over time. Thus, the human race has endured so much, from bullying, suppression, and slaughter. But unlike other lifeforms, our enmities are not carved into our souls for eternity. Many races actually look down on our human race due to this, viewing the human race as natural slaves. After the wound heals, we forget the pain,” said Xia Guhong.

Long Chen bitterly smiled. “That’s difficult to hear, but it really is accurate. No wonder those races look down on us. Our human race has far too many miserable wretches. In the Darklight Heaven, there was one star-field where I saw the human race wagging their tails to the beast race. They’ve already forgotten how the beast race used to slaughter our ancestors.”

“Those people have practically lost all the face of the human race! If I encounter them, I’ll probably teach them how to be human!” raged Guo Ran.

“If you could teach them anything, that would be limitless virtue.” Xia Chen smiled, but he knew that it was impossible.

However, just as Xia Chen said this, he heard someone cry out.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”
