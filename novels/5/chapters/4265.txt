Chapter 4254 Boss Nine’s Power

Long Chen looked at Long Aotian and indifferently said, “In your eyes, I see your anger, and I also see your fear. You wish to beat me, but you are also afraid of failure. You want to attack me in my top condition to fully wipe out your heart-devil, but you also don’t feel guaranteed to win. You don’t want to fail, and you don’t dare to fail. You fear that if you fail once more, you will never rise again, having no courage to fight me again. You feel very conflicted. The most important reason for this conflict is that you have no confidence in beating me.”

“Shut your mouth!” Long Aotian roared. The hand holding his sword quivered, but he didn’t draw it.

“How cowardly. You don’t even have the courage to fight, but you act like some bigshot. Long Chen’s life is mine. None of you can take it. If you keep wasting time talking, those people will fully recover. Do you even want to activate the karmic luck bead anymore?” interjected Xu Xin-er impatiently.

“Long Chen, you’ve really pissed me off. Hehe, well done. I’ll show what a life worse than death is.” Long Aotian suddenly smiled sinisterly, his gaze turning to the Dragonblood Legion.

The next moment, five-colored divine radiance appeared behind Long Aotian, and a powerful pressure erupted.

In an instant, Long Chen’s expression changed, and a cold murderous intent appeared in his eyes.

“Long Aotian, you despicable animal.”

Long Aotian sneered. He instantly found Long Chen’s weak point and shot toward the Dragonblood Legion.

“Courting death!” Long Chen was enraged. Not daring to fight him directly, Long Aotian actually went to attack the Dragonblood Legion.

“Stay behind!” Just as Long Chen moved, Xu Xin-er sneered and the three immemorial beasts attacked him at the same time.

“Die!”

With a resounding dragon roar, Long Chen’s dragon claw extended out of his divine ring.

This giant dragon claw reached toward the tiger that Xu Xin-er was sitting on. To her surprise, she found that her tiger was suddenly unable to move.

Long Chen’s roar contained the divine true dragon’s might. As a true dragon was the emperor of all beasts, even immemorial beasts were intimidated by it. As a result, these three immemorial beasts were instantly suppressed by Long Chen’s dragon might.

Although Long Chen did not belong to the dragon race and did not possess a true dragon's physique, his indomitable will, when combined with his dragon blood, gave rise to a unique form of dragon might that was equally capable of subduing other beasts.

This dragon might would only last for the blink of an eye and might not have as much range, but it was enough for Long Chen.

When the dragon claw fell, the Blood Mark Sabertooth Tiger didn’t even manage to make a sound. It was torn apart by the dragon claw, its blood and bones flying through the air.

“What?!” The ones watching were shocked. Such a terrifying existence was killed in one blow? This made them think of what Long Aotian had just said, that Xu Xin-er was dreaming if she thought that these three beasts could block Long Chen. Now, this scene proved that Long Aotian was right.

Xu Xin-er fled the moment the dragon claw fell, narrowly avoiding this attack. Her face turned pale. She had just been a bit away from being annihilated.

“Spiritual seal made of blood, I call you back!”

Violet qi erupted out of Xu Xin-er, and her other two beasts suddenly had runes explode on their foreheads. The seals suppressing their strength were undone. Astonishingly, Xu Xin-er undid the restraints on their power, ignoring the danger of them potentially rebelling against her.

At this moment, those two beasts exploded in power. People were shocked to find that they were both existences in the innate Heaven Venerate realm.

BOOM!

After their seals were undone, the Storm Heaven Devouring Python opened its mouth, causing a giant vortex that enveloped Long Chen and Xu Xin-er. Shockingly, with its seal undone, it no longer cared about its master.

Long Chen had been planning on chasing after Long Aotian after killing the Blood Mark Sabertooth Tiger, but that vortex was actually pulling at him, trying to suck him in and preventing him from flying away. He was enraged.

“Boss, leave these three to me.”

Just then, some light flowed around Long Chen, and he was pulled outside of that vortex.

Long Chen turned to see that Bai Xiaole had come, his eyes bearing three swirling flowers. Long Chen could also see a little fox sitting on his shoulder.

“Will you be alright?” Long Chen was a bit worried.

“Don’t worry. Her violet-gold bell is a treasure, and it’s going to be mine. Us two brothers will avenge our previous disgrace,” said Bai Xiaole before the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox could say anything.

“That damn woman, after offending Boss Nine, your retribution has come today.”

All of a sudden, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox's body expanded, reverting to its original size. As a legendary desolate species, it was renowned in history. Now, with its true form summoned, it emanated an intimidating aura, its nine tails flickering like soaring flames.

The next moment, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox opened its mouth, and a blood-colored ray of divine light shot toward the vortex of the Storm Heaven Devouring Python.

BOOM!

The Storm Heaven Devouring Python’s divine ability was interrupted, and it was sent flying.

“Die!” Xu Xin-er was startled to see the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox coming. Standing atop the Blue Eye Gold Scale Eagle’s head, she made it attack the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

However, Xu Xin-er was pale now, and violet blood oozed out of her eyes. Having undone the seals on her immemorial beasts, once more gaining control of them came at a terrifying price.

“Xiaole!”

When the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox shouted, Bai Xiaole immediately formed hand seals. Three flower marks also appeared in the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s eyes.

“Three Flower Wall!”

Both the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox and Bai Xiaole shouted at the same time, and the three flowers in both their pupils spun. The void then quivered, and a giant three flower diagram appeared in the void like a translucent shield.

BOOM!

This shield appeared out of nowhere, catching everyone off guard. Alas, Xu Xin-er had sent the Blue Eye Gold Scale Eagle charging over, leading it to smash into this three flower shield.

The impact caused the shield to shudder and giant ripples to spread along with an explosion of feathers. The collision tore apart nearly half of the Blue Eye Gold Scale Eagle's body.

As for Xu Xin-er, she had managed to summon the violet-gold bell just in time, bouncing off the shield. Although she had preserved her own life, she was left dazed.

Xu Xin-er was horrified, having never expected the little fox that she had wanted as a housepet back then would actually possess such terrifying power. It was even capable of unleashing pupil arts.

With her courage broken, she no longer had her previous arrogance or confidence. She actually turned around and fled.

“Where do you think you’re going?! Hand over that bell first!”

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox roared. Its nine tails quivered, and it prepared to chase after her.

However, just then, the Storm Heaven Devouring Python appeared beneath its feet, binding it.

“Nine Tail Lock Shed!”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s tails then lit up in various vibrant colors. Before the Storm Heaven Devouring Python could unleash any divine ability, it was blown apart by the nine tails.

“Hand over the bell!”

After escaping the bindings, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox shot after Xu Xin-er.
