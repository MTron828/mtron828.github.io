Chapter 3314 A New Pleasant Surprise

Even on the streets, they felt a sinister wind blowing past them. It was like someone was blowing cold air on the back of their necks. Hence, their hair stood on end, and the world seemed to have turned dark.

Long Chen looked in a certain direction, divine light flickering in his eyes. After a bit, he said, “It left.”

“You saw it?!” Bai Shishi and the others cried out.

Long Chen shook his head. “I can’t see it. But I can sense it.”

Even Long Chen was unable to see it. That made people feel even more uneasy. An enemy that they couldn’t see was the most frightening.

“What was it?” asked Bai Shishi, her voice quivering.

“I haven’t seen a lifeform like that either. It has no shape or form, no color or smell. It’s as if it’s fully merged into heaven and earth, making it impossible to sense. Most likely, it only randomly answered you when it heard our conversation.”

“What did I say to draw it out?” asked Bai Shishi, tensing. She was so nervous that she forgot what she had said.

“You said, only a ghost would believe him,” said Bai Xiaole.

“Was it really a ghost?” Everyone shivered. They looked at Long Chen.

“There’s no need to be so afraid. The Ghost Dao is one of the six Daos. We still know far too little about them. Some people like to use the Ghost Dao to scare others, drawing out their terror. It’s just to teach them what respect is. Whatever it was, it didn’t express any hostility toward us. If it had wanted to kill us, I would have sensed it,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen suddenly thought of the mortal world. He had encountered lifeforms of the Ghost Dao there as well. He had even used money to bribe them and make them lead him to where he wanted.

However, just now, he had also jumped. That voice had appeared out of nowhere, with absolutely no premonition.

At the same time, he thought of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s warning. This time, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame caused a huge disturbance. Experts from outside this heaven might come.

It wasn’t just the immortal world fighting for it this time. There were also the dark worlds behind the immortal world, and they were on it as well. But whether or not that ghost came from the dark worlds, no one knew.

Although Long Chen was shocked, he wasn’t afraid. He possessed lightning and fire, so he wasn’t afraid of such a lifeform.

However, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole seemed particularly afraid of these ghost monsters. That would affect their sense of danger and perception in a battle against them. That was a problem.

After asking about it, he learned that this fear was something they were born with. Apparently, it came from Bai Zhantang. As for why, it was some secret that the two of them had never uncovered.

No wonder Long Chen had felt Bai Zhantang’s aura to be strange when they had fought back then. It was as if his body was concealing some strange aura. It seemed that Bai Zhantang also had his secrets. None of those people were as simple as they appeared on the surface.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When they returned to their residence, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole felt a bit better. This residence was very extravagant and could overlook the majority of the city. Other than the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue, this building was the tallest one in the city.

It could be seen just how focused the Heavenly Rainbow Domain was on keeping Long Chen out of trouble. Everything was free. Whatever they wanted, people went out to get it.

They were all so courteous that even Long Chen felt embarrassed. It felt like if he were really to cause trouble here, it would be inhumane.

“Let’s all rest and enter our peak condition. When the Heavenly Rainbow Flame appears, it will probably be a true battle of tigers and dragons,” said Long Chen.

After thinking about it, he still decided to tell them a bit about what the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had warned him about, mainly the part about experts from outside this heaven coming, as well as the possible invasion of those terrifying lifeforms from the dark worlds.

He only told them so that they should be mentally prepared. Their enemies were not just limited to those in the immortal world. He didn’t want them to be surprised when they suddenly faced strange new opponents.

“This is going to be big. I wonder if it will draw our people over as well,” said Qin Feng excitedly.

After ascending, the Dragonblood Legion was spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. It was only through the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s story that Long Chen understood just how big of a concept this was.

Even for the Huayun Sect that was spread throughout the entire world, it wasn’t too realistic for them to reach every corner of the nine heavens and ten lands. Hence, gathering the Dragonblood Legion would prove to be very difficult.

However, Long Chen believed that they would rise once more. As his fame rose and rose, sooner or later, it would reach every corner of the nine heavens and ten lands.

Bai Shishi and the others started meditating. They then entered their peak condition, ready to fight at any moment.

As for Long Chen, he went into seclusion to test Split the Heavens. He tested just how he could use Heavenly Dao energy, and how he could break the barrier of the Heavenly Daos. He wanted to unleash the maximum power with the minimum backlash.

His 108,000 stars quivered, their divine flames burning. He stared at them quietly. He had always been thinking about a certain question.

Ninety-nine percent of the Heavenly Daos’ power rejected him or opposed him. Only the slightest bit helped him.

However, when he absorbed that trace of energy, no matter what he did, he would also absorb some of the opposing Heavenly Dao energy. That energy would wreak havoc on his body, and the backlash of Heavenly Dao energy was extremely harmful to him.

No matter what he did, he was unable to completely reject that power. If he fully expelled the opposing Heavenly Dao energy, he also would be left with no Heavenly Dao energy.

If that happened, he would simply be returning back to his old path. And under the pressure of the Heavenly Daos, Split the Heavens would be far weaker.

Long Chen sensed the changes as Heavenly Dao energy entered his body. It was a turbid mix. No matter what he did, he could not purify it. There were some dirty parts that couldn’t be removed.

He tried countless times but was unable to expel that dirty portion. Even his 108,000 stars were powerless.

As for the primal chaos space, he had no way of activating it and using it to purify this energy. He drew this energy into his flesh and blood, into his soul, into anything he could think of. But it was all meaningless.

With no other choice, he sent the turbid stream into the primal chaos space. It seemed that only the primal chaos space had a chance of purifying it. But countless failures told him that actually making it purify it was the real problem.

Just as he was going to think of some other way, the three Devil Eye Water Lilies in the primal chaos space shook. The turbid flow of Heavenly Dao energy was absorbed by them, and this turbid stream was instantly purified.

The resulting pure Heavenly Dao energy was all the energy that helped Long Chen. He almost jumped up.

“So the Devil Eye Water Lily requires that kind of dark energy to grow faster!”

He found that after the Devil Eye Water Lilies absorbed this turbid Heavenly Dao energy, they became even more vibrant. They were thriving.

“Hahaha, success, success! I can freely unleash Split the Heavens now!” Long Chen laughed excitedly.

He hadn’t succeeded in the past because the primal chaos space hadn’t had the Devil Eye Water Lilies before. Now that they were there, both the lilies and himself could benefit from this.

“Long Chen, you murderous underworld ghost seed, come out and fight grandpa Yang!”

Three days later, when Long Chen and the others entered their peak state and were ready to move out at any moment, a furious roar came from outside their residence.

“It’s Yang Zicong.”

Bai Shishi and the others were surprised. Just how had this fellow returned?
