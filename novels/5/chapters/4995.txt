“Impossible! This cannot be!” Long Xiangkun’s roar echoed through the battlefield. Gritting his teeth, he ignited his Heavenly Fate Disk. Under the threat of death, he became one with the Heavenly Fate Disk and got several times the power. Back then, Huo Qianwu had also used this move.

Yet, Long Xiangkun had overlooked a crucial detail: he had only recently awakened his Heavenly Fate Disk and had yet to fully acclimate to its power. His incomplete synchronization proved costly.

As a result, the moment they merged, he spat out blood. Nevertheless, he had no other choice.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber descended mercilessly, cleaving heaven and earth apart and hurling spacetime into chaos. A gaping spatial crack hung ominously, consuming everything within its reach.

This was a saber strike that made ghosts sob and gods weep—an unstoppable force. Countless fragments of a divine spear lay broken on the ground as a testament to its power

Long Xiangkun’s arms were no more; he resembled a mass of flesh and blood, and horror etched across his face as Long Chen approached.

“No, no! Don’t kill me! I don’t want to die…” Long Xiangkun’s voice trembled with fear and desperation. He was like a pile of mud now. Unable to resist anymore, he regretted everything and started to beg for mercy.

“You don’t want to die, but you were willing to kill. Brother Fang also didn’t want to die, but did any of you give him that chance?” Long Chen retorted coldly.

Long Chen swung Evilmoon down mercilessly, reducing Long Xiangkun to dust. Just like that, a newly awakened Heavenly Chosen perished.

While no one knew if Long Xiangkun was the shortest-lived Heavenly Chosen in the history of the human race, he certainly held that title in the Long clan.

Enveloped in a celestial light, a Heavenly Chosen was a legendary figure revered by many. However, the life of this new Heavenly Chosen was abruptly extinguished by a single stroke of Long Chen’s saber.

This scene left Long Ziwei and the others in utter disbelief. Weren’t Heavenly Chosen supposed to be the darlings of heaven and earth, blessed with immense karmic luck where misfortune invariably turned to fortune? How could such an end come so suddenly?

What had happened to Long Xiangkun? He hadn’t even had the chance to unveil his brilliance to the world before being struck down by a single saber blow. His journey as a Heavenly Chosen had barely begun before it was tragically cut short.

“Brother Fang, rest in peace,” Long Chen intoned solemnly.

Brother Song and the others held a case containing Fang Liude’s head. His body had been destroyed by Long Zaiye, and all that remained of him was his head.

After killing Long Xiangkun, Long Chen walked over to them. He asked, “Where are those people?”

He was asking about the Long clan’s disciples who had been whipping Yu Ying and the other mercenaries in front of everyone.

Long Ziwei answered, “I already killed them all.”

After following Long Chen, Long Ziwei adopted his decisive nature. As a result, the laws of the Long clan could no longer bind him. To him, there were only friends and enemies.

Against his enemies, he would show no mercy, eliminating them whenever the opportunity arose. Thus, Long Ziwei had shown no compassion to those motherfuckers.

From Long Chen, he came to understand a simple principle: the strong could be called experts because they were fearless even in the face of death, always ready to charge forward without hesitation.

“Long Chen, let us return Brother Fang to the earth so he can rest. You’ve avenged him, so I believe he can now smile in the yellow springs,” said Yu Ying as she rubbed the case in Brother Song’s hand. Thinking of Fang Liude’s smile, she suddenly burst into tears.

Vengeance was taken… the perpetrators were slain… but Fang Liude would not come back. The millions of mercenaries were all grieving.

“It’s our fault for being worthless. Even with so many of us, we couldn’t fight them off. Despite our increased power, we’re still inferior mercenaries,” cried one of them, stamping the ground in frustration.

With their newfound power, they had thought they would no longer have to be bullied. However, reality was cruel. With their new power came new problems. Now, they not only had to endure being bullied, but they could also lose their lives at any moment.

“Don’t be like that. Brother Fang told us to endure because the chance to improve ourselves is incredibly rare. We have to keep hold of it. One day, when we’re strong enough, we definitely won’t be bullied any longer!” comforted another mercenary.

Long Chen took a deep breath, trying to calm his emotions. He declared, “You are not inferior mercenaries. You are the descendants of the noble Jiuli race!”

“What?”

This declaration struck the mercenaries like a bolt of lightning, and they stared at Long Chen in confusion.

“Long Chen… what did you just say?” asked Yu Ying. She and the other mercenaries couldn’t believe their ears.

“All of you are descendants of the Jiuli race, and the runes in your Dantians are Jiuli runes. How else do you think your internal injuries vanished? How did your meridians heal so quickly? Did you really believe that the Starry River of the Sky Art was so easy to cultivate? Did you think your power multiplying tenfold, or even more, was solely due to your effort?” asked Long Chen.

Everyone, including Long Ziwei, was stunned.

“Don’t doubt yourself. The moment the rune activates, you are already full-fledged descendants of the Jiuli race. Your lives are not inferior to anyone else’s, certainly not to someone like this!” Long Chen declared, lifting Long Zaiye like a dead dog.

With shattered bones and Dantian, Long Zaiye was now a cripple. Had it been anyone else, they would already be dead. However, his half-heaven vein dragon qi was barely keeping him alive. Well, even if he wished for death, Evilmoon wouldn’t allow it.

Last time, Evilmoon had repeatedly told Long Chen not to kill him, so it could devour more of his energy.

However, Long Zaiye had caused such a calamity that even Evilmoon felt guilty. If they had killed him earlier, Fang Liude might still be alive. This guilt silenced Evilmoon, preventing it from advising Long Chen now.

Understanding that everyone needed time to process this revelation, Long Chen asked Yu Ying and the others their opinion about a specific location. This location had been Fang Liude’s favorite place while he was alive. He had even joked that if he ever died, he wanted to be buried there.

After Fang Liude was laid to rest, Long Chen tossed Long Zaiye into the grave. Ignoring the bastard’s pleas for mercy, Long Chen drove Evilmoon into his heart.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In an instant, the translucent heaven vein dragon qi around Long Zaiye vanished. He stiffened and then collapsed limply in the grave.

Long Chen stepped forward to say a few comforting words to Fang Liude’s spirit, but then countless powerful auras flew over their heads, causing Long Chen and the others to jump in shock. After all, several of those auras possessed heaven vein dragon qi.

Looking up, Long Chen saw many people flying through the air. Amongst them were several extremely powerful existences, and behind them trailed tens of thousands of youngsters.

“Long Chen?”

Suddenly, a pleasantly surprised voice rang out from their midst.
