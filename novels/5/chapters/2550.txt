Chapter 2539 Battle Plan

“Big brother Long…”

“Shh!”

Wilde had just opened his mouth when Long Chen gestured to be quiet.

At this time, Long Chen, Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, and Wilde were hiding behind a mountain, looking at a valley filled with ferocious beasts.

These beasts included dragons, phoenixes, tigers, wolves, and more. Every one of them gave off a sense of immense pressure.

Wilde involuntarily swallowed one mouthful of saliva after another while he stared at them. After waking up, Wilde was stuck in a weakened state, which was the only way for him to endure the pain of hunger. But that weakness was uncomfortable.

Right now, he needed powerful meat, and those beasts were perfect for that. Hence, he began to drool.

Moreover, Long Chen had brought them to take a look at the Poison Dragon Abyss and the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon. But they had left just after arriving. Now that they were here, Wilde’s stomach was rumbling like thunder. He almost couldn’t hold back.

Wilde didn’t know how to speak spiritually, and with his loud voice, even whispering was like shouting.

“Wilde, endure it. We’ll get you some food soon,” comforted Long Chen. He then turned to Guo Ran. “How is it? Can you handle it?”

“I can… but I’m worried about drawing over something we can’t deal with. Boss, I’m sure you can handle a single thirteenth rank beast, but if there are two or three, we won’t be able to endure. Wilde is currently too weak to fight,” said Guo Ran.

Long Chen had brought them to scout the area before coming up with a battle plan. He had decided against the Poison Dragon Abyss and the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon because they were too spacious, and the terrain was not favorable to them. If they were surrounded by thirteenth rank beasts, they wouldn’t be able to run.

“No need to worry. Ling Xi told me that these beasts came from a different world. The laws of this place are foreign to them, and they haven’t fully adapted yet. Even after so many years, they remain in this valley with a spatial channel at the back that feeds them energy. Do you see that faint blue barrier? Once they leave that region, they will be suppressed by the laws of this world. Even if multiple thirteenth rank beasts come, we’ll still be able to easily run. All I want to know is if you have some way to kill them in batches. I want a large number of corpses, the more the better. I’m in a rush too, so killing them one by one is too slow, do you understand?”

Since the mother tree had recovered some of its power, Long Chen’s group had been given a leaf that allowed them to move anywhere within the range of the mother tree’s territory. They hadn’t wasted any time traveling, so Long Chen hadn’t had the time to explain everything.

“Then it’s no problem. I still have quite a few bombs. With the exploding bombs providing support…”

“Fool, I brought you to the Poison Dragon Abyss and the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon to think of possibilities. For example, using the poison dragons’ poison against these beasts to kill them all. Ling Xi told me that the beasts have been accumulating here for tens of thousands of years, so they might outnumber the Black Armor Corps buried beneath the mother tree back then. Even if they didn’t resist and stuck out their necks for us to sever, how long would it take?” Long Chen shook his head.

“Oh. I’ve been working on new armor and weapons, so I wasn’t thinking properly. Cough, well, the beasts here seem to be mostly furred beasts, so they shouldn’t be particularly powerful when it comes to defense. As long as we get enough poison, my bombs can spread the poison and give them fatal wounds. With Zhao Ritian, I can gather the fragments of the bombs back. The main thing is that the poison dragons and poison scorpions aren’t so easy to handle,” said Guo Ran.

The poison dragons were definitely frightening. If someone was stabbed by them, that could be fatal. They could also spit out toxic gas. Although their physical bodies weren’t powerful, their toxicity was something they had to be cautious of.

As for the scorpions in the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon, their defensive power was extremely high. Armored beasts were always a headache as their bodies were difficult to pierce through. They had almost no weaknesses, so killing them could only be done with brute power.

“Okay, since you don’t have a better method, we’ll go with my plan. We’ll give up on the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon. There aren’t that many of them, and they lack flesh. I’ll take charge of the Poison Dragon Abyss. Although they also lack the meat we want, we can get poison from them. The three of you can start launching some probing blows here to test their bottom line and get some food for Wilde. For goodness sake, every time he opens his mouth, the smell of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders bursts out. Despite his appetite, I’m sure he’ll get tired of eating the same thing over and over eventually. You launch some probing blows here. Once I bring the first batch of dragon corpses back, you can launch the real attack,” said Long Chen.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Wilde immediately grew excited. Long Chen truly understood him. Although he wasn’t picky, he had truly gotten tired of eating the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders.

“Boss, I should go with you. There are countless poison dragons in the Poison Dragon Abyss. It’s too dangerous,” said Yue Zifeng.

If there were poison dragons that had reached the thirteenth rank there, then it could easily be fatal. If both of them went together, they could look out for each other.

“No need. I have Evilmoon, so those poison dragons can’t touch me. Let’s split up.” After that, Long Chen activated the leaf. A leaf-shaped rune appeared on his chest, and he vanished.

“Let’s start!” Guo Ran didn’t hesitate. He summoned his battle armor and charged toward the valley.

As soon as he appeared, the beasts inside the valley roared and attacked him.

“Damn, there’s this many?!” When he entered the valley, Guo Ran was shocked to find that there was a special spatial law inside the barrier. These beasts were actually many times larger than they had appeared on the outside.

Only once he was inside the valley did he see a giant channel in the distance. The channel was pitch black, but when Guo Ran entered the valley, he saw countless lanterns light up inside of it.

In truth, those weren’t lanterns but eyes, and they looked like stars in the cosmos. Guo Ran felt a chill, and he almost ran away.

Yue Zifeng was already attacking. An eagle was cut down as it flew toward them, its head leaving its body.

Wilde grabbed it before it even landed on the ground, sucking it into his bowl and devouring it.

“I’m finally getting some good meat!” Wilde sighed in gratitude. He had almost forgotten the taste of proper meat. The Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders had cast quite a shadow on him.

The first ones to arrive were the flying beasts. They let out heaven-shaking roars as they attacked the three of them.

Yue Zifeng’s sword danced in the air as he cut through them like tofu. His Sword Qi was even capable of cutting Zhao Ritian’s immortal metal body, so flesh and blood was easily sliced.

Seeing that Yue Zifeng was so powerful, Guo Ran relaxed slightly. His own weapons, dual sabers, had been destroyed by Zhao Ritian, so he was using two backup sabers for now.

Even peak twelfth rank beasts were nothing before Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi. Every slash of his sword killed a mass of them.

This was the terrifying power of a sword cultivator. Their Sword Qi was a special kind of energy, and its sharpness was not limited by laws. That was why they were said to be number one in terms of offense.

A cultivator’s magical arts or Battle Skills could not manage to concentrate all their power onto the thin edge of a blade like Sword Qi could.

While the larger hammer was definitely stronger, when it came to the ability to kill in one blow, a small knife surpassed it.

Yue Zifeng cut down countless beasts with his Sword Qi, which contained the will of the Sword Dao. Those struck had their souls extinguished.

Yue Zifeng was the main force, while Guo Ran provided support. Although Yue Zifeng’s killing power was terrifying, his defensive power was particularly lacking.

He killed those beasts easily, but if they got close to him, they had the potential to kill him in one blow.

Suddenly, a roar rang out that made those beasts suddenly retreat. The void exploded, revealing a giant claw that smashed toward them.

“A thirteenth rank beast!” exclaimed Guo Ran. He slashed with both his sabers.

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s backup sabers shattered, and he was smashed into the ground.

Just at that moment, the owner of the claw, a wild lion, appeared in front of Yue Zifeng. This lion’s fur was the color of blood, and it had two heads. Even its eyes were scarlet.

Guo Ran had managed to draw over and block its attack, while Yue Zifeng’s sword fell once more. Blood splashed.

“What?” Yue Zifeng was shocked to find that he could only cut open its skull with his attack. He wasn’t able to go any deeper.

The two-headed tiger then roared in pain, and a powerful soundwave resounded through the sky. It pounced on Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng was about to dodge when a furious roar rang out. All of a sudden, a giant door bolt smashed into the lion’s head.

The door bolt landed on the already injured head, causing it to explode. When one head was destroyed, its body began to spasm.

Wilde attacked with the door bolt again, striking the other head. That head caved in, and then Yue Zifeng followed up with an attack, cutting it in two. The three of them managed to kill a thirteenth rank beast by working together.

Wilde excitedly ran over and started eating the lion. Every bite filled him with energy.

“Wilde, eat later, run now!” Guo Ran crawled out. His armor was covered in cracks. When he saw the spatial channel in the distance, his soul almost fled from his body.
