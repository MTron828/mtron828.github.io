Chapter 4844 The City Lord’s Might

A crisp and clear sound reverberated through the air, seemingly freezing time in this otherwise silent world.

Lu Ziqiong, along with the Iron Blood Gate’s people, and the various experts in the streets were all struck dumb.

“DIE!” Cao Guofeng roared, his face twisted with fury. After all, being slapped in the face by a Divine Venerate junior was worse than killing him. He had never suffered such an insult before

As Cao Guofeng’s Blood Qi erupted, he sent a fist smashing toward Long Chen with the full power of a Heaven Saint. However, Long Chen just stood there, calmly watching.

At that moment, the bows of the four Protector Elders from the Feather Spirit race glowed. Ear-piercing whistles filled the air, resembling the deep roar of a beast or the haunting wail of otherworldly spirits thirsting for life.

Just as Cao Guofeng's fist was mere inches away from Long Chen, Cao Guofeng abruptly trembled and halted his fist forcefully.

With a derisive gaze, Long Chen reached out and patted Cao Guofeng’s face mockingly. “I knew that you didn’t have the guts. You’re afraid to face death with me. That’s why, in the future, you shouldn’t say such big words, alright?”

Long Chen exuded confidence, as if everything was under his control. He knew that Cao Guofeng didn’t have the courage to die with him. Even if Long Chen were to slap his face until it swelled like a pig’s face, he still wouldn’t dare to retaliate.

The only regretful thing was that Cao Guofeng was just too strong. Long Chen’s slap only left a faint handprint on his face, which quickly faded.

Enduring Long Chen’s humiliating actions, Cao Guofeng gritted his teeth so hard that they were almost crushed. However, he refrained from retaliating because his life hung in the balance under the threat of the Feather Spirit race's arrows. With those deadly arrows aimed at him, any misstep would be fatal.

Most importantly, the race leader Yu Luo was also present, restraining Cao Guofeng’s options. He felt like he would go crazy.

“Scram. I, Long Chen, disdain killing people using other people’s hands,” sneered Long Chen.

Cao Guofeng slowly retreated along with the people behind him. Once there was some distance between them, the four Protector Elders slowly put down their bows.

“All disciples of the Iron Blood Gate, hear my orders! Gather right now! Today, we will fight to the death with the Feather Spirit race!” roared Cao Guofeng, his voice resounding throughout Devil Fall City.

With one roar, all of Devil Fall City erupted into an uproar. Most of the civilians didn’t even know what was going on.

“If you want to fight, the Feather Spirit race will accompany you,” declared Yu Luo, not retreating even an inch.

Just then, a cold snort rang out. “Do you think that I, the city lord, no longer exist? When did Devil Fall City become a place where you can do whatever you want?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The speaker remained unseen, but his voice reverberated with such authority that it made all of Devil Fall City tremble. The voice seemed to emanate from the very city itself.

A name instantly appeared in Long Chen’s mind: Xing Wujiang. He was the master of Devil Fall City and also the one in control of the Square Heaven Seal.

“City Lord, you can see that the Feather Spirit race has clearly gone too far! Today, I must make them pay the price!” shouted Cao Guofeng.

“I did see it, and this matter can be put aside. The star cloud martial stage has been activated. I don’t want anyone to break Devil Fall City’s rules.” Xing Wujiang’s voice rang out once more.

“No, I must kill them today!” roared Cao Guofeng.

The next moment, the Devil Fall City quivered. When the city lord’s heavenly might raged, the world descended into darkness, and a heavy killing intent filled the city.

The absolutely terrifying heavenly might made even Heaven Saints feel like ants in front of it, suffocating Cao Guofeng.

“If you feel like you have the power to challenge me and take my position, why don’t you try it now?” Xing Wujiang’s voice became merciless, containing icy killing intent in it.

Cao Guofeng could only grit his teeth and glare at Long Chen, his expression looking dark. In the end, he snorted and led his people away.

After Cao Guofeng left, Lu Ziqiong, Li Ziyu, Yu Tong, and Yu Fei just realized that they were covered in cold sweat. They almost collapsed, their faces pale.

They had never seen such a terrifying sight before. In front of Cao Guofeng’s Heaven Saint might, they couldn’t do anything.

“This Cao Guofeng is a true idiot. Many people say that Xing Wujiang is no longer capable of using the Square Heaven Seal’s power, but Cao Guofeng has unwittingly proven the truth to everyone,” said Yu Luo lightly.

“Was that the might of the Square Heaven Seal?” asked Lu Ziqiong.

“What other weapon could calm a berserk Cao Guofeng down instantly?” replied Yu Luo.

Long Chen felt grateful toward her and vowed to repay this favor in the future when the opportunity arose.

“We should go. It’s almost time,” interjected Mo Nian.

Long Chen nodded. When they continued toward the star cloud martial stage, Lu Ziqiong said, “Long Chen, as a participant, you don’t need to enter the stage. The star cloud martial stage has a special space for you to prepare.”

“No need. I’ll just stick with all of you. It just so happens that I want to chat with race leader Yu Luo,” said Long Chen.

“The special space is able to let the fighters enter their optimal condition. You really don’t want to use it?” asked Lu Ziqiong.

“There is no need. Within the same realm, I am confident that I can beat anyone.” Long Chen smiled slightly.

As he said this, they reached the spectator stands. However, once they were in, Long Chen felt a sense of immense pressure.

“Heavens, this martial stage... it’s huge!” Lu Ziyu couldn’t help crying out when she saw the stage. It was ten times greater than the stage where Lu Ziqiong fought.

On the two sides of the stage were two giant devil heads, and every single brick of the stage had runes carved into it, exuding a terrifying aura. Even the barrier was unable to block it.

Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu found it difficult to bear the terrifying aura. Fortunately, Yu Luo was present, so she helped Yu Tong and Yu Fei block that pressure. Without her, these two would be unable to watch the battle.

Long Chen examined the stage and saw five special spectator platforms that were set up to watch the battle from an optimal spot. Every platform had hundreds of seats.

“Those five spectator platforms are for the four noble clans and the city lord. They usually watch high-level battles,” explained Yu Luo.

Just then, spectators started to be transported in. However, this time, they were unusually quiet.

“Race Leader Yu Luo, there’s something I want to ask you,” said Long Chen suddenly. “Is your Feather Spirit race related to the Feather race?”

Long Chen grew a bit anxious, his unease showing on his face.
