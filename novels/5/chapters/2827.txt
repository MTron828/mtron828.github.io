Chapter 2816 Killing

Another group of people came walking over. The one at the front was a handsome man of a fair complexion. While holding a white paper fan in his hand, he swaggered over like a young lord.

Regretfully, any air of nobility was broken by his smile, which looked like he needed a spanking.

Long Chen didn’t know how many people like this that he had killed. On the Martial Heaven Continent, such people were originally present in plague proportions, but he had slaughtered them until they almost became a protected species.

However, this species once more appeared in the High Firmament Academy in epidemic numbers. Would he need to start a new slaughter just like in the Martial Heaven Continent?

Mu Qingyun’s side glared darkly at this man. One of them shouted, “Zhong Changsheng, as the third ranking expert, you actually randomly say such slanderous words? You don’t live up to your reputation as an expert!”

This Zhong Changsheng’s aura was extremely powerful. Based on the divine energy fluctuations he gave off, Long Chen judged that he was around the same level as Mu Qingyun.

While Mu Qingyun’s people were filled with expressions of righteous indignation, Mu Qingyun herself didn’t react much at all.

“Slander? The rank two Mu Qingyun actually lowered herself to run here to pull over a newcomer. Doesn’t this prove you’re already targeting outside experts? Have you lost confidence in the divine rankings competition?” Zhong Changsheng snapped his fan shut and walked over. Someone immediately took out a chair that he then sat on.

Long Chen shook his head and sighed. He couldn’t help recalling a certain memory from the Xuantian Monastery. When they had been challenged by another monastery’s disciples, Guo Ran had worked with him to set up a similar display.

So many years had passed since then in no time at all. He was no longer that tender youth, so this person’s actions appeared incredibly childish to him. Just how many years had it been since he had messed around with such a play?

“You’re the one being so despicable that you actually interfered in this exam! He is nothing more than a surprise. If we still didn’t hit back after you’ve repeatedly provoked us, we’d be beaten black and blue by you, wouldn’t we?” raged that woman. Her anger showed that the conflict between the two sides was not a matter of just one or two days.

At the same time, Long Chen understood that the big-chinned fellow had been targeting one of Mu Qingyun’s people, making him fail so that he couldn’t even get second place. This Zhong Changsheng had to be the real instigator behind this matter. It seemed that Mu Qingyun had finally lost patience and was preparing to fight back this time, but then Long Chen appeared.

However, what Long Chen didn’t know was that amongst the examiners for this exam, while some belonged to Zhong Changsheng’s side, some also belonged to Mu Qingyun.

Mu Qingyun had received word that not only was the other side cheating to harm her people, but an astonishing figure had appeared, passing through the exams with full marks. Mu Qingyun had then rushed over to help her side and also see whether she could pull Long Chen to her side.

However, she had arrived one step too late. Long Chen had already knocked his opponent down, which meant that she had failed to arrive at the critical time to help him, not managing to make him owe her a favor.

Despite that, helping Long Chen handle the aftermath could also give him a good impression and pull him to her side. Thus, she and Zhong Changsheng were fighting.

The only thing that Long Chen found curious was that despite this clearly being an official examination, no one from the actual core of the God Institute’s management came. How was it that when two gangs of disciples appeared, no one came to control things? The God Institute’s management was even worse than the Pill Institute’s.

Zhong Changsheng slowly fanned himself as he sat in the chair. Ignoring that woman’s words, he looked at Long Chen. “Little fellow, I’ll give you two paths. Either kowtow and apologize to our people, or join us.”

Mu Qingyun frowned. The other side had also received information, which was why they had rushed over so quickly. They were also planning on pulling in Long Chen.

However, she then sneered, while the woman beside her grew anxious. Half their goal in coming here was Long Chen. If he was pulled away by Zhong Changsheng, that would be a giant humiliation for them.

Before she could speak, Mu Qingyun raised her hand, telling her to be quiet. She was ranked two on the divine rankings. She had seen and experienced countless people. Hence, she instantly saw through Long Chen’s character and knew what his reply would be.

As she expected, Long Chen said, “Thank you for giving me two options…”

Zhong Changsheng smiled, thinking that Long Chen was submitting since he thanked him. He was about to praise his intelligence when Long Chen continued.

“However, I can only give you one suggestion. You should change your name. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I’ve encountered quite a few people called Changsheng. However, they never lived long lives. Instead, they died after messing around. Your name isn’t auspicious.”

“You…!” Zhong Changsheng’s face turned dark. This sudden turn knocked his pleased smile off of his face.

The woman beside Mu Qingyun could barely contain her mirth at this response. She covered her mouth with both hands, but her shoulders quivered.

Mu Qingyun and the others also found it funny. Long Chen looked completely serious when he said this.

As a result, Zhong Changsheng’s fury soared even more at this silent laughter. “Kill him!”

As soon as he spoke, a dark-faced fellow behind him immediately charged out, his hand reaching toward Long Chen’s head. His fingers were like iron claws, and he was as quick as lightning, vicious.

This person was a true expert. At this moment, a sharp light flickered over his fingernails. If a head was grasped by this hand, it would surely be crushed by this killing move.

Upon seeing this, Mu Qingyun’s expression completely changed. She hadn’t expected this person to dare to launch a killing move. If he did kill Long Chen, she would also be slightly implicated. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

By the time she reacted, she was too late. Even as she moved, that person already arrived in front of Long Chen. Hence, she prayed that Long Chen could block this attack. If he was only injured, she could save him.

However, just as she moved, before her palm touched that person, his body suddenly turned stiff.

A sword had stabbed through his left eye and out the back of his head. He was already dead. As for the sword, it was in Long Chen’s hand. For a moment, everyone was deathly silent.
