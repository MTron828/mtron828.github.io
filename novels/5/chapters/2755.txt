Chapter 2744 Evil Woman

Deep within the divine families’ ancestral land, within a delicate pavilion, Long Aotian’s mother was carefully fiddling with something.

That something was a crown, whose body was made of sparkling gold. She was currently in the midst of embedding a strange divine gem inside.

“Aotian has reached the peak of the Saint realm. He’ll quickly become an Emperor, and on the day that he wears the crown of a Sovereign, the Martial Heaven Continent will be destroyed. I’ll have Aotian wear the crown that I personally crafted. Everyone will know he is the true king, and the spawn of that slut is nothing more than a stepping stone for my son.” Long Aotian’s mother looked at the crown in her hand with satisfaction.

“Madam is correct. That idiot Luo Ningshuang fell for our trap without even realizing it. What a fool. Once young master Aotian becomes a Sovereign, this star-field’s core will be in our hands. We’ll be able to return to the higher plane as heroes, and then we can enjoy the expressions of the Luo family, haha!” laughed another woman behind Long Aotian’s mother.

This woman was also from the higher plane. She had come with Long Aotian’s mother.

“The Ying Prefecture’s Luo family has been enemies with my Chu family for thirty million years. Even after forming such a boundless enmity between us, the Luo family still produced such a naive fool like Luo Ningshuang. Her father is a generation’s Immortal King with both vision and power, but he didn’t pass any of these down to his daughter. She’s just an idiot. Now even her son has fallen for my trap. Haha, I bet the news of Luo Ningshuang and Long Zhantian’s expulsion would throw all the face of the Luo family. That’s even better than killing her. But her spawn was surprisingly hardy. He actually survived. But I’ll definitely have Aotian record cutting off his head. When I return to the higher plane, if Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang aren’t dead, I’ll let them have a chance to see their son again, hahaha!” Long Aotian’s mother laughed.

“You might not have that chance.”

An icy voice suddenly rang out behind Long Aotian’s mother, startling her and the other woman. Long Aotian’s mother in particular felt a chill.

She turned back to see an image of a merciless death god facing her. At this moment, her soul almost fled in terror.

The woman beside her didn’t recognize Long Chen and instinctively reached out to grab Long Chen, only to be blasted apart by a single punch. She was only at the seventh Heavenstage and wasn’t even an ant in front of Long Chen.

“Save-!” Long Aotian’s mother suddenly shouted, his aura exploding as she fled.

However, she had barely moved before Long Chen’s slap struck her in the face, causing half her face to collapse. She smashed into the ground like a shooting star.

While Long Aotian’s mother had a high cultivation base, her physical body wasn’t particularly powerful. Long Chen’s slap had used very little force but still caused her to hack up blood.

She struggled up and started rushing away again. “Help! Save me!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

A hand flew out of Long Chen’s hand, piercing her back and coming out of her chest.

She was completely locked down by Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength. She felt like this world had lost all its color. Instead, she was in a black and white nightmare. Behind her wasn’t Long Chen, but a fiend in control of this world.

Furthermore, this fiendish demon wasn’t in a rush to kill her. No, this demon wanted her to experience terror and despair.

Countless formations activated at this moment. It was unknown if the divine families had noticed a problem with the channel or if they had been alerted by the disturbance here, but dozens of experts came charging over. They saw Long Aotian’s mother fleeing for her life as if she had just seen a ghost.

When they looked past her to see Long Chen slowly following, their hearts almost leaped out of their chests. They instantly turned pale.

“Save me!” Long Aotian’s mother screamed like a dying person who had grasped the last straw of life.

However, this trace of hope was quickly extinguished when lightning arrows blasted those experts out of existence.

“AHH!” She herself was also struck by a lightning arrow, but it was weak enough that it only broke her protective divine barrier, causing her to stagger.

As she frantically ran away, Long Chen calmly followed behind her like a hunter staring at his prey on its deathbed.

They quickly reached a large gate. Long Aotian’s mother once more felt hope and rushed over, practically slamming into it. After that, countless bloody ripples appeared on the gate. This place had a powerful formation set up.

“Hahaha, you can’t kill me! Don’t even think about breaking this formation. You vile spawn, you-”

Her laughter was suddenly cut off when Long Chen waved a nine-line Soul Calming Jade, causing the formation to open. He easily walked in.

“How can this be?!”

She was stunned to see this. This formation was something that only the highest level Soul Calming Jades of the divine families could open. The number of people who possessed such qualifications definitely did not exceed ten.

She did not know that Long Chen’s Soul Calming Jade had been left to him by Long Zhantian. Long Zhantian naturally gave his son the best.

Long Chen walked in calmly and kicked her while she simply stood there, stunned. She tumbled back. The other side of this gate was a large empty plaza. This place was bare but clean, and it gave off a somewhat sinister feeling.

The scent of blood remained here. This place had clearly been renovated and yet abandoned. Even those renovations were unable to remove the stench of blood.

This place had once been the main palace of the divine families. However, due to that battle back then, it had been filled with blood. Countless people died here, even Saints, so the air of resentment was too strong, and it had been abandoned.

“My father and mother must have been subdued here, right? Excellent, this is the best place for your execution.”

Long Chen examined the surroundings and felt a certain sorrow. However, he felt more rage.

BANG!

He then sent her flying with another kick. She was already on her last breaths and rolled to the front of the empty palace.

Suddenly, the void behind Long Chen shuddered. A golden hand silently appeared, slamming toward Long Chen’s back.
