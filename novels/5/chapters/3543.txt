Chapter 3532

Long Chen sensed that aura stealthily creeping in from the other direction. Hence, Long Chen quickly concealed his own aura.

His flame energy stemmed entirely from Huo Linger. As long as he didn’t expose Huo Linger’s aura, it wouldn’t be easy for others to notice him.

He quickly saw a furtive figure coming up from the other side of this mountain.

“Luo Zijun?”

When Long Chen saw his face, he smiled sinisterly.

This fellow was with Zhao Mingxuan and the others, the one who had made sarcastic remarks toward Long Chen in the Fallen Immortal Pavilion. After that, he threatened to kill Long Chen for the bounty. Enemies truly did cross paths often. He just had to encounter Long Chen here.

Luo Zijun was by himself. Sneaking over and looking around, he didn’t seem to sense any danger. After stamping his foot on the ground, he directly pounced on that devil expert and the Heavenly Flame Spirit.

That devil expert was focused entirely on the flame tiger. But just as he had the advantage, he was sneak attacked. With a furious roar, he swung his weapon behind him, only for the distraction to cause the tiger’s claw to smash into his body, blowing him up. As a result, flame energy erupted.

Luo Zijun seemed prepared. At some point, a large net appeared in his hands. He then cast it through the air. All that flame energy and the tiger were enveloped by that net.

Long Chen was startled. This flame net possessed a terrifying aura, and it was covered in runes. It was actually a World Domain divine item. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

That tiger struggled crazily. But that net simply tightened and its body exploded, transforming into flame runes.

When the net contracted, it actually gathered the flame runes from the Heavenly Flame Spirit and the devil expert together.

“Haha, that’s the sixth! The treasure that my master gave me really is perfect!”

Luo Zijun laughed wildly. The net then shrank until the devil expert’s flame energy and the Heavenly Flame Spirit’s runes were compressed into a fist-sized sphere.

After that, he took out a bottle and carefully put the sphere inside of it. Just as he was about to put the bottle away, a gust of wind blew by.

That bottle vanished. Hence, Luo Zijun was shocked and hastily looked around.

“Long Chen!”

He quickly spotted Long Chen standing on the mountain peak, holding his bottle. Luo Zijun was enraged. His treasure had actually been taken by Long Chen.

“Fuck, are the heavens blind? If I want to get something, I have to run all around and exhaust myself like a dog, all just to see a single Heavenly Flame Spirit fighting with someone else. You’re telling me that you’ve run into five before this?! Where is heaven’s justice?!” Long Chen looked at the six spheres inside the bottle and couldn’t help feeling envious. This bastard’s luck was too good, wasn’t it?

“Long Chen, die!”

Luo Zijun felt a mix of shock and anger. With a howl, he swung his giant net over Long Chen.

But all of a sudden, a flame spear pierced his back. Luo Zijun’s body quivered and he looked down at his chest in disbelief. Slowly turning around, he saw a pretty girl in a flame dress staring at him coldly.

“Have you gotten used to peaceful days? You’re so foolish. Do you not even know how you lost your item?” Long Chen scoffed at Luo Zijun’s lost expression with disdain.

Huo Linger had merged into the space here and snatched his bottle, giving it to Long Chen. Afterward, Luo Zijun only spotted Long Chen but didn’t see Huo Linger standing right behind him.

Any Dragonblood warrior in the same situation would have sensed something wrong. But Luo Zijun hadn’t even considered it, only thinking about taking back his bottle. Hence, he was easily done for.

Originally, Long Chen had been thinking of having Huo Linger draw his attention while he killed him, but he had overestimated this fellow who called himself an expert.

Luo Zijun was shocked to find that his flame energy was rapidly being sucked away by the spear.

“Long Chen, I have my sect’s jade talisman! If you kill me, everything here will be transmitted outside. If you kill me, you won’t live either. My sect will definitely avenge me. Let’s discuss it. I can give you those Heavenly Flame Spirits, and you can let me go. Then we can each mind our own business,” said Luo Zijun loudly.

Long Chen wasn’t moved. Looking at the six flame spheres in the bottle, he curled his lips. “Who are you trying to con? Four of the six people you killed were humans. Are you not afraid of their revenge?”

Long Chen found that there was one sphere with the aura of the devil race, one with the beast race, and the rest contained the aura of the human race.

Clearly, these six Heavenly Flame Spirits weren’t first discovered by him. He had simply used his net to kill the person and take their treasured discovery. Moreover, he hadn’t just taken the Heavenly Flame Spirits but also the flame energy inside the bodies of those experts.

“No, no, it’s true! I killed them because even if their sects found out, they wouldn’t dare to touch me!” shouted Luo Zijun hastily when he saw that Long Chen didn’t believe him.

His voice was already starting to become hoarse, and fear filled his eyes. That was because Huo Linger was rapidly absorbing his flame energy. That was his core flame. If too much of it was absorbed, he would be crippled.

“Oh, so that’s the case. You mean that you can kill people, but I can’t kill you?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

Luo Zijun wanted to say yes. But he didn’t dare to say it in the end for fear of infuriating Long Chen. The cultivation world was simply like that. There was no justice or law. Whoever was strongest was the law.

“Too bad. I can’t let you off. Just based on the fact that you want to kill me, I cannot let you off. You will definitely die today. Didn’t you say that a recording of just before you die will be sent to your sect’s experts? Then do you have any final words? Say them quickly, or don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“No, I don’t want to die! Please, let me go!” Luo Zijun cried. In front of death, his pride vanished like it had never existed.

“That’s obviously impossible. People like you think that you can control other people’s lives and treat them as nothing. I can’t even form the slightest pity for people like you. Now you know fear? Did you think about other people’s pain and thirst for life before you killed them?” Long Chen’s expression turned cold. He then nodded to Huo Linger.

BOOM!

Luo Zijun’s body exploded. Just as he was killed, a mirror design appeared in the void. That mirror caused time runes to fly about before it vanished.

“Good, this scene can be considered my declaration of war against those ignorant fools!”

Long Chen took away Luo Zijun’s net, and with a flash, he entered deeper toward the whirlpool. As for the other whirlpool in the entrance, just as Luo Zijun died, an uproar exploded there.
