Chapter 2642 The Heavenly Daos Change

Qu Jianying’s expression grew a bit unnatural as though she was embarrassed. It was the old man who said, “She is preparing to go through the second batch, while I’m going through the third batch. After all, we’re all old. Our Blood Qi has declined. There’s no way for us to compare ourselves to you, youngsters.”

Qu Jianying was embarrassed. After all, for a senior expert like her to go through the second batch was a bit embarrassing.

However, it was truly like what the old man said. They were old, resulting in their Blood Qi already declining. They couldn’t try to force it.

Furthermore, they absolutely had to be steady at this time. The senior leaders of the Martial Heaven Alliance like Qu Jianying, the old man, and Li Tianxuan had to survive. If they fell to heavenly tribulation due to desiring greater power, it would be a serious blow to the Martial Heaven Alliance.

“How about the Dragonblood Legion undergoes tribulation with you?” said Long Chen after a moment of thought.

“How can we do that? The second batch isn’t suitable for you… Brat, are you trying to get us to go through the sixth batch?!” Qu Jianying suddenly realized midway what Long Chen meant.

“You’re right, I misspoke. I meant that you could go through the tribulation with the Dragonblood Legion.” Long Chen corrected himself.

“Brat, have I cursed you so much that you want me dead? We won’t even have a trace of our bones left if we go through the sixth batch,” cursed Qu Jianying. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Woman, what are you worrying about? Since Long Chen brought it up, he naturally has confidence. Do you not even trust your own child?” The old man on the other hand was excited. The stronger the tribulation, the greater his power would be afterward.

Furthermore, with his understanding of Long Chen, he knew that Long Chen wouldn’t bring up something he wasn’t assured of. Hence, the old man was excited to go through tribulation with the Dragonblood Legion.

Long Chen said, “My power is limited. I can only bring three of you. So alliance head, old man, and Xuan Master, you can undergo tribulation with the Dragonblood Legion.”

Li Tianxuan smiled. “Then I will thicken my face and experience what a peak heavenly tribulation feels like.”

Li Tianxuan also understood Long Chen and had great confidence in him. In any case, he wasn’t undergoing tribulation together with Long Chen, so it was fine.

At this moment, the rumbling throughout the world grew louder. There were people in every corner of the Martial Heaven Continent going through tribulation.

The first batch of people quickly ended. As Qu Jianying said, their tribulations weren’t powerful and only lasted a short hour. It was as if the Heavenly Daos were skimping, simply giving them a quick pass. Right now, a new batch of Heaven Merging experts appeared on the Martial Heaven Continent.

When the second batch started, the power of the tribulation multiplied, but it was endurable. It then finished in two hours.

On the other hand, the third batch started to grow truly difficult. In the first two batches, essentially no one failed. However, things were different for the third batch.

The third batch of experts was strong, but the laws of the Heavenly Daos were also growing more and more complete, no longer allowing others to just slip through easily. Hence, failures began to appear, with experts turning to dust.

The fourth batch quickly got started thereafter. This batch contained the elite warriors of the continent, the main force on the battlefield. The Martial Heaven Alliance and the divine families’ disciples had created distance between them and began undergoing tribulation.

“No!”

A warrior covered in blood screamed and suddenly exploded, turning into bloody mist. This powerful warrior was killed by heavenly tribulation.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen couldn’t help sighing. That expert was an Empyrean. His status as an Empyrean had brought him accomplishments, but it also harmed him.

Before this, he was a supreme genius of the heavens, favored and pampered by the Heavenly Daos. He had formed a dependence on the Heavenly Daos as a result.

Now, the Heavenly Daos had grown emotionless. The previously kind Heavenly Daos became ruthless, and these experts were unable to adapt to this change. It was like a warm mother had become an evil stepmother suddenly. Because of this, holes appeared within their spiritual defenses, and they were wiped out.

“Everyone, listen well! You are the warriors of the Martial Heaven Continent! You are brave warriors fighting to protect your families behind you! You have no time to cower! The Heavenly Daos have changed, as the other worlds’ viciousness has soaked into it. To face this tribulation is to fight the war! What you are facing is not heavenly tribulation, but a challenge from the other worlds. Don’t expect them to have mercy on you. If you want to live, show your courage. The lifeforms from the other worlds want to take your lives and viciously slaughter your families. Can you accept that? Bring out your full power and go all-out against them! You are warriors, not cowards. Fight with all you have!” Long Chen suddenly shouted. His voice was backed by his spiritual yuan and Spiritual Strength. Even within the endless lightning, his voice rang out clearly.

His voice was directly transmitted into people’s souls. If it was anyone else who said the same thing, it wouldn’t have much of an impact. But these words came from Long Chen, someone who had created countless miracles, someone who had reached his level step by step through his own efforts. His words contained the power to stun and affect people immensely. Hence, their fear was suppressed, and they felt endless fury as well.

“Kill!”

They no longer passively endured the heavenly tribulation as they always did. Now, they attacked it, unleashing their full might.

BOOM!

A giant lightning sword crashed down from the black sky at Long Chen. By speaking to them, Long Chen had interfered with their tribulations. This was sensed by the Heavenly Daos, causing them to unleash heavenly punishment.

This was the executioner sword of the heavens that made people’s hearts tremble in fear. This sword was the heavens, and it was unavoidable.

Beside Long Chen, Qu Jianying’s expression suddenly changed. She was shocked to find that she couldn’t move. This sword had also locked onto her.

Despite the dire situation, Long Chen snorted. At this moment, lightning runes lit up on his hand, and with a single palm, that terrifying lightning sword was shattered into lightning runes.

After that, a lightning dragon appeared in the air. That was Lei Long. It sniffed them and then vanished again.

Meng Qi and the others smiled. Previously, Long Chen’s Lei Long was fond of devouring all lightning runes. But now it had gotten picky. It seemed that lightning on this level wasn’t even worth devouring.

This action stunned the nearby people of the divine families. Heavenly punishment seemed to be nothing to Long Chen. After that one attack, no further punishment came from the heavens.

What they didn’t know was that a lightning tribulation on this level was unable to lock down Long Chen. It simply wasn’t qualified. Long Chen had sensed this, which was why he gave the speech to those experts.

It was unknown just how many lives were saved due to his words. In any case, they were all grateful to him.

Following this, the fifth batch containing the top geniuses of the various powers also started their tribulations. With the experience of those before them, it went much smoother. The Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s disciples also went through collective tribulation and succeeded without a single person dying.

“Brothers, are you prepared? It’s our turn soon!” shouted Guo Ran heroically. Others were filled with fear for this heavenly tribulation, but the Dragonblood warriors were filled with anticipation.
