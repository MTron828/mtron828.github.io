Chapter 3365 Leng Yueyan’s Emotions

The barrier opened and Leng Yueyan brought Long Chen into the city. The black-armored experts knelt toward her, filled with reverence. Leng Yueyan was a supreme existence in their eyes.

Even inside the city, there were piles of corpses. Some of the buildings had been destroyed and the formation was on the verge of breaking, but fortunately, Long Chen had turned things around.

After kneeling at Leng Yueyan, these experts got to work. They cleaned up the battlefield, repairing the formation and recuperating from their wounds.

As for Leng Yueyan herself, she seemed to be indifferent to all of this. She didn’t say a single word and just brought Long Chen to the tallest building in the ancient city, the castle.

“Did you miss me?”

Leng Yueyan suddenly spoke.

“I missed you. I missed you a lot. I saw you in my dreams countless times, but every time I woke up from those dreams, I felt miserable.”

Long Chen nodded. This was true. He had seen her in more than one dream and always felt the same kind of disappointment when he woke up.

It wasn’t just her. He also saw Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, and the others in his dreams. He saw them and the Dragonblood warriors drinking and laughing together.

However, sometimes it was good dreams, and sometimes it was nightmares that woke him up in a startled terror. He didn’t know what exactly he felt inside.

Seeing that faint bitterness in his eyes, Leng Yueyan squeezed his hand. A rare warmth appeared on her face. “Everything will get better. We’re working hard on cultivation so that we can help you one day.”

This faint warmth on her face made Long Chen’s heart swell. It was like someone gave him a warm blanket in winter. That warmth clothed him in confidence and courage so that he could face countless dangers and enemies.

The two of them entered the castle. Many of the runes of the castle were already dim. It was most likely the core of the city, and today’s battle had exhausted a great deal of its energy.

At the very peak, the formation activated, and they were brought to Ming Cangyue. She appeared identical to Leng Yueyan. She was seated lotus style on the ground, divine light flowing around her, making her appear sacred and holy.

“Didn’t she already advance to Immortal King? Why is her aura so unstable?” asked Long Chen worriedly. Had a problem occurred with the breakthrough?

“We were in a crisis just now, so she had no choice but to quickly make her breakthrough. After advancing and scaring off Tuo Ming, now that we’re safe, she has to restabilize her cultivation base. The reckless advancement caused some side effects that must be corrected, or her foundation will be shaken,” said Leng Yueyan.

Long Chen nodded. Perhaps in order to advance faster, Ming Cangyue had used some sort of secret art. Such a thing would definitely leave flaws that would affect future advancements.

Since she had just advanced, she still had time to fix those flaws. She could stabilize her realm and reduce the damage to the lowest possible amount.

If she was instead forced to fight after such a breakthrough, then she wouldn’t have this chance. It would be difficult to ever recover from such a thing, and her future cultivation would be severely impacted.

Leng Yueyan examined Ming Cangyue. She looked closely at the runes around her and then brought Long Chen away. They arrived at the sun room of the castle. From here, they could overlook the entire city.

Countless experts were working to repair the city. Looking at those busy figures, Long Chen said, “Will Cangyue be alright?”

“She’ll be fine. It’s a good thing that you came when you did. Her realm has not fully stabilized, so there is a chance to correct it. Speaking of which, how did you even end up coming here?” asked Leng Yueyan.

The answer was a long story. Sitting down and holding her hand, Long Chen narrated what had happened, starting with the battle of the Martial Heaven Continent. He spent hours telling her everything.

Leng Yueyan smiled. Her beautiful face was like a flower blooming. She was very happy with Long Chen’s storytelling. She could hear the confidence he had in her and that he needed her.

Long Chen never told others about the bitterness in his heart. But in front of Leng Yueyan, he could set down his burdens and speak freely.

It was like Leng Yueyan was a fierce and powerful big sister. Although a bit violent, she still gave him an indescribable sense of security.

There was no need for him to fake anything. There was no need for him to force himself up. He could freely tell her what he had gone through, and that was precisely why she smiled. This story-telling was a kind of acknowledgment. Perhaps amongst all of Long Chen’s beauties, only she was able to handle this.

The reason why he didn’t need to hold anything back was because she was strong enough. Leng Yueyan liked that kind of acknowledgment.

“Don’t just listen to me talk. What about you two? How did you end up in a life-and-death battle against Tuo Ming?” asked Long Chen.

“There’s nothing to tell. We were unable to help you on the Martial Heaven Continent due to being on different planes. If we were to forcibly create a spatial channel connecting the two, the laws of the Netherworld would instantly destroy the Martial Heaven Continent. We could only hope that you wouldn’t die, somehow breaking free of the bindings of that plane and ascending to the immortal world. In any case, we sped up our cultivation and began expanding our territory…”

Through Leng Yueyan’s explanation, Long Chen learned that the laws of cultivation in the Netherworld were different from the immortal world.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Netherworld also had countless races, but there was a specific Nethergod race that could be considered the emperor race of the Netherworld. They were born with the laws of the Netherworld flowing within their bodies. That was what allowed them to be in charge of the six Daos of reincarnation.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue belonged to this innate emperor race, which was why when they were born, they were already a Nethergod. Their parents were the laws of this Netherworld.

The Netherworld’s so-called six Daos of reincarnation were the laws that maintained the nine heavens and ten lands. For example, when Long Chen was attacking the Netherpassage realm and entered the Gates of Hell trial in the Netherworld, that was one of the laws of the six Daos of reincarnation.

The one in charge of keeping watch and protecting these laws was Ming Cangyue. This passage was something related to the secrets of the nine heavens and ten lands. There were countless experts maintaining these laws.

Ming Cangyue was in charge of merely one miniscule portion, and it just so happened that the Martial Heaven Continent was included in that portion. That was why her clone was sent into the Martial Heaven Continent, to sever any goodness left in her. As a result, she ended up producing Leng Yueyan. Eventually, due to Long Chen, the two of them became two separate existences, but also one whole.

As Nethergods, the more laws of the Netherworld that they could control, the faster their cultivation, and the greater the karmic luck supporting them.

In order to get stronger, they began to expand their territory. They gradually grew stronger, but in the process, they also faced endless dangers.

Just like the immortal world, the Netherworld was a world where the weak were devoured by the strong. Naturally, their sudden rise would draw the attention of other experts, and they would bare their bloodthirsty fangs at them.
