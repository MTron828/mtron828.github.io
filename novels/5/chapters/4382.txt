Chapter 4371 Bloody Slaughter

BOOM!

After the collision, everyone felt like they could hear the sound of the ten thousand Daos weeping. Heaven and earth simply shattered like a mirror, leaving behind a giant void in the world.

Following that, countless spatial blades flew out of the void, unfurling throughout the world. The black torrent of spatial blades brought with it endless annihilation.

In the past, the holes resulting from shattered space would act like voracious mouths, sucking everything in the world. However this time, the spatial blades came pouring out from within the chaotic flow of space, destroying everything in this world.

“Heavenly Rainbow Barrier!”

“Sharp Golden Shield!”

“Heaven Earth God Seal!”

The moment those two apocalyptic attacks collided, Xia Chen, Yu Qingxuan, Bai Shishi, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were already prepared.

On the outside-most layer, Xia Chen set up an enormous formation that weakened that terrifying torrent. Following that were Yu Qingxuan’s flame barrier, Bai Shishi’s golden shield, and then Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s earthen walls.

BOOM!

These defenses had just been set up when the terrifying torrent engulfed them. The runic formation, the flame barrier, and the golden shield exploded one after another. Only the earthen wall barely managed to stand, albeit riddled with holes.

Fortunately, the experts sheltered behind the wall were perfectly safe. When the earthen wall crumbled, they saw that the once vibrant world had transformed into a desolate wasteland.

A giant hole appeared in the air, revealing an abyss of endless darkness. Everyone could see terrifying spatial blades spinning within it.

Suddenly, an enormous spatial blade came flying out of the hole. It was easily ten thousand miles long and cut the very earth in two. Its destructive power was something not even the Heavenly Daos could heal.

“That attack just now could probably wipe out an entire mass of Eternal experts!” exclaimed one of the Dragonblood warriors. While the Dragonblood warriors didn’t dare to call themselves unrivaled or say that they could wipe out many Eternal experts at once, they knew it was hard to find worthy opponents for them. Hence, they usually felt immense pride in themselves.

However, when that spatial blade flew out of that chaotic current, its terrifying power shook their hearts. Seeing the dark energy flowing from within that hole, everyone could make out a turbulent river, with spatial blades intermittently shooting out of it.

Fortunately, despite the enormous size of the hole, only occasional spatial blades flew out of it after the first leakage. They no longer caused huge devastation to the Great Desolate World.

When Xia Chen and the others regained their sight, they turned to look at where those Eternal experts were. They saw that all of them were in their true forms, lying there motionlessly.

They hadn’t died. However, that last attack had sucked up all of their Eternal energy, resulting in them entering an extremely weak state. Behind them was a mass of experts from the Great Desolate World. Those experts just stared in horror at the scene before them, not daring to believe their eyes.

“No… This isn’t real. This is a nightmare! Wake up!”

One of those experts screamed in terror and slapped himself with all of his power. His face deformed from how hard he hit himself, and blood splattered through the air. Unfortunately, this wasn’t a dream.

“The blood debt you owe must be paid. Had you left the human race a chance back then, even just one, I wouldn’t do something like wiping you all out. You are the ones who seal your own path. If you don’t give others a path to survival, others will also not give you a path,” said Long Chen without the slightest emotion.

“By killing us, aren’t you also carrying out an extermination? In the future, others will kill you as well!” A furious roar came from the Great Desolate World’s side.

“I am different from you. I don’t kill people for no reason. Actually, I have two reasons. One is as vengeance for the human race of the Great Desolate World, and the other reason is to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys. I’m telling those idiots that the human race isn’t so easy to bully. I won’t waste any more words. This is not something that can be decided by talking. Xia Chen, seal the exit. Everyone else, kill them! Treat them how they treated the human race!” ordered Long Chen.

Xia Chen immediately sealed the gate behind them. With this, people from outside couldn’t come in, and no one could leave.

“Kill!”

Countless experts immediately charged forward.

“You goddamn bastards, return my family’s lives!”

“My little brother was killed by you! You have to pay this blood debt back a thousandfold!”

“You animals, you kept repeating that you were carrying out justice while you erased my Cool Breeze Sect! Now, all that remains of the Cool Breeze Sect is myself. Even if I have to die, I will get justice for the eight hundred thousand lives of the Cool Breeze Sect!”

When the traitors of the human race helped the invaders infiltrate the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, these invaders simply walked around under the guise of justice, slaughtering the enemies of the traitors wantonly. As a result, many people here could no longer live under the same heavens as the Great Desolate World’s people.

Now that their chance had come, their killing intent exploded. Their eyes turned scarlet as they embarked on a ruthless massacre.

The Dragonblood warriors were at the vanguard and specifically picked out the comparatively stronger lifeforms to kill, leaving behind the ones that posed little threat to the others.

Afterward, this slaughter continued for seven days and seven nights. However, the Dragonblood warriors did not participate in the killing and just split up into many squads to protect the others.

Long Chen and his companions remained at the core of the Great Desolate World. After all, Long Chen didn’t want to kill them personally as he disdained killing weaklings.

Since he had no direct enmity with the Great Desolate World’s people, he left the vengeance to those who did.

With an unfathomable formation master like Xia Chen present, there was nowhere for them to hide. After seven days and seven nights, the slaughter came to an end, and the human race was all that remained in the Great Desolate World.

When everyone gathered once more, millions of experts suddenly knelt toward Long Chen, making him jump. He hastily told them to rise.

“What are you doing?!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you don’t know this, but my father, mother, wife, and son were all killed by them. Without you, I would have never avenged them. Even though I knew I had very little ability, I still came here, without the intention of leaving alive. I thought just killing one of them would comfort my family in the Yellow Springs…”

“We came for revenge. It's the same for all of us. Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we will never forget this favor!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Some people could barely speak through sobs, while others shouted their emotions out loud. In truth, many of these people didn’t care about righteousness. They only came for revenge. After what they had lost in recent days, they thought of nothing else. They just hoped that their revenge was enough to comfort those lost spirits.

Long Chen comforted them for a while, and once their hot emotions settled a bit, he announced, “This battle is over. Clean up the battlefield, and all those who participated in the battle will get a share of the spoils.”
