Chapter 2575 Forcing Enemies to Retreat

The Blood race’s army was instantly enraged, and they charged to the exit of the channel between the Martial Heaven Continent and the Yin Yang World. But they didn’t charge out.

“I could already beat you like dogs in the Yin Yang World. If you come into my world, I’ll beat your crap out through the top door.” Long Chen placed Evilmoon on his shoulder and disdainfully looked at the furious Blood race experts.

Although there was just a single step’s distance between the Yin Yang World and the Martial Heaven Continent, the two of them had different laws. Long Chen wasn’t an Empyrean, so he was capable of fighting in both worlds without much of a difference.

If Empyreans entered the Yin Yang World, it would be harder for them to gather Heavenly Dao energy to support themselves. They might not even be able to summon their manifestations. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

On the other hand, the Blood race’s experts were also stronger in the Yin Yang World with its laws. But if they came into the Martial Heaven Continent, the difference in laws would also affect their combat power.

This was why Long Chen had antagonized them by charging into their world to challenge them. He dared to enter their world, but they didn’t dare to come to his.

Daoist Heavenly Feather held back a smile. Long Chen truly had some skill when it came to his mouth. Sometimes he said such unexpected things that it made others laugh.

The Blood race’s experts didn’t get it as quickly as she did. Only after a while did they understand what it meant for crap to come out through the top door. When they understood, some of them couldn’t hold back and charged out.

The elder leading them shouted at them to come back, but ten thousand of them had gone crazy with rage and didn’t listen to his orders.

“A mere group of ants.” Long Chen snorted and swung Evilmoon. A saber-image blasted all of them to pieces.

Those powerful experts were nothing in front of Long Chen. They were instantly wiped out.

“Nice!”

Quite a few experts from the Martial Heaven Continent’s side had arrived. Seeing Long Chen slaughter ten thousand of them in one blow made them cheer.

Long Chen rested his saber on his shoulder once more as if he had just done something wholly insignificant. He then indifferently stared at the Blood race’s experts who looked like flames were about to explode out of them.

As expected, their power was reduced upon entering the Martial Heaven Continent. He also found that while these experts were not dumb, it seemed that their bloodline power could affect their minds, and they would lose their logic when they were angered.

Despite knowing that they would be suppressed upon entering the Martial Heaven Continent, so many of them had still charged out.

“This is the power of the Blood race? You were wiped out before even half of my attack’s power was used up. Trash like you wishes to conquer the Martial Heaven Continent? Are you trying to kill us by making us laugh to death?” sneered Long Chen.

“Human bastard!” The Blood race’s experts furiously gnashed their teeth.

Suddenly, a strange sound came from within the Yin Yang World, making the Blood race’s experts’ expressions change. Their fury was suppressed, and the red glow in their eyes also faded.

“You are Long Chen? Our world gate has already opened. Our world energy is pouring into the Martial Heaven Continent. When the time comes, the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent will be a mix containing our laws as well, and we will no longer be suppressed. Then you will be slaughtered like livestock fit to only beg for your lives before the Blood race,” said the young man from the Blood race that had a similar power level as a Sovereign sprout.

“So what? I could cut you once, and I can cut you a second time. You were lucky this time that someone saved you. If it weren’t for that shameless elder interfering, you would already be dead. I don’t dislike arrogant people, but I do dislike idiots who act arrogant without the power to back it up. If you disagree, then let’s fight right now. I’ll let you pick the location and time,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“You…!” The Blood race man raged, but he was already traumatized by Long Chen. Long Chen was correct. If it weren’t for that elder, he would have died.

At that time, they had been within the Yin Yang World’s domain. Even then, he hadn’t been a match for Long Chen. If they were to fight one against one, he would only be sending himself to his death.

“Hmph, I’m currently unable to unleash my full power. Just wait until this place has our laws as well. Then you will understand how terrifying the Blood race is, and just how foolish your arrogance is,” snorted the Blood race man.

“Whether or not you can unleash your full power, I swear that if you show yourself in front of me again, I’ll make you kneel and beg for mercy. If you are the top expert of the Blood race, I’d advise you to scram back to wherever you came from. I’m not even interested in raising my blade against people like you,” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen was now doing his best to provoke the Blood race’s experts. As a result, their eyes were glowing scarlet once more.

“Bullshit. Do you think you can imagine our power? I am merely one of the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s subordinates-” The Blood race man suddenly shut his mouth, his expression completely changing.

“The Blood Fiend Devil Lord? What an ominous name. I was born to slay devils and fiends. This name is taboo. When I see him, I’ll definitely beat him until he can’t tell which direction is north,” sneered Long Chen.

Although Long Chen was still acting arrogant, he was startled. The Blood race was truly powerful. It seemed that even an expert on the level of a Sovereign sprout was nothing more than a subordinate.

If the subordinate was already so powerful, just how powerful was this Blood Fiend Devil Lord? The stronger he was, the hotter Long Chen’s blood grew.

“You…!” The Blood race man was enraged that Long Chen would insult the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. However, before he could say anything more, the elder interrupted him.

“The human race is nothing more than fish on the chopping block. Being eaten is only a matter of sooner or later. Rather than wasting more time speaking here, it would be better to settle things next time with our forces.” The elder waved his hand, and the Blood race’s army began to retreat. The Blood race man then pointed at Long Chen, gnashing his teeth and telling Long Chen to just wait. After that, he left with the others.

The Blood race’s army of millions vanished beyond the channel. At this moment, the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent were still rushing over, and some of the latecomers only got a glimpse of the Blood race’s army’s backs as they left. They were confused, not knowing what had happened.

“Did the Blood race go to all this trouble just to intimidate us?” asked one of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s sect leaders.

Li Tianxuan explained, “Sect leader Zhao, you are correct. Their only goal was to strike fear into our hearts. The aura of their world has yet to fully invade the continent. Before the continent’s laws are changed to also support them, they will not undergo any large-scale invasions. This was just to apply pressure on us. It’s not too surprising. Their intelligence isn’t particularly high, so they often use such childish techniques.”

Li Tianxuan was publicly viewed as the brain of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Hence, its members all had faith and respect in him. His explanation made them nod.

Based on the Blood race’s character, they had very likely come with an army in order to catch them off guard. After killing a few people, they would retreat back within the Yin Yang World before the continent’s forces gathered. This would give a display of their power and make the continent’s people feel despair.

It went without saying that an army of millions had truly been a stunning sight.

However, their plans had gone awry, because as soon as they arrived, they met Long Chen. He had blocked them, killing a Heaven Merging expert and hundreds of thousands of their army. Even an expert on the level of a Sovereign sprout had been beaten badly.

Rather than shaking the continent, the Blood race had only given a blow to their own morale. Their depressing retreat made others laugh.

Although this loss was nothing to the Blood race, it was an invigorating piece of news to the Martial Heaven Continent. Now, people felt an even greater respect for Long Chen. Using his own methods, he had inspired them.

In the past dark eras, the Martial Heaven Continent had always been the passive defender. Although the Sovereigns had forced back the invaders, every dark era had resulted in the Martial Heaven Continent taking a grievous blow to its core. Countless experts had died on the battlefield.

Practically every person had ancestors that had been killed by the invading races. Hence, their hatred toward the invaders had reached the level of wanting to tear them apart and drink their blood. Long Chen’s victory made them grateful, as well as feel hope for the future.

“Long Chen, what do you think?” asked Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Long Chen shook his head. “Their divine abilities are focused on the bloodline. My own bloodline is unaffected by their suppression. But others might be affected badly.”

The Blood race’s experts had tested several moves against him, but the power of his dragon blood was too strong. Because of it, they had ended up fighting in the most direct confrontation, so he hadn’t gained any valuable information about their special techniques or such.

“The Blood race’s attacks are very strange. It’s impossible to keep track of their divine abilities. In the past dark eras, they always came with new techniques. Perhaps they are afraid of us grasping their weaknesses so they change their cultivation methods, or they send different races against us each time. In any case, our accumulated experience against them isn’t very useful. If we were to rely on that past experience, we would actually lose out. We can only rely on ourselves to test them out,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“Hehe, although I didn’t manage to figure out their trump cards, I did find some of their fatal weaknesses. The Blood race isn’t worth fearing.” Long Chen smiled mischievously.
