Chapter 4836 Boss San Fights

Mo Nian shouted excitedly, rallying everyone to join in the gambling fun. However, before he could finish, an ancient voice reverberated through the air, “The star cloud martial stage is a place for martial competitions, not gambling. If you cause any further disturbance, you will be expelled from the city.”

Mo Nian jumped in surprise, caught off guard by the unexpected interruption. It was unusual for a city to forbid gambling in martial competitions. It couldn’t be that they had their own in-house gambling setups, so they forbade his booth, right? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Since Mo Nian was in their territory, he knew he couldn't push the matter further. Reluctantly, he abandoned his plans for instant riches and complied with the rules.

“Cough...”

Just then, Lu Ziqiong woke up and spat out blood. After spitting out blood, she looked much better.

“Big Sister, you’re awake? Thank goodness!” Lu Ziyu was so emotional at seeing her sister awake that tears fell from her eyes.

“His medicinal pill is truly miraculous,” Lu Chengfeng and the others remarked joyfully. Lu Ziqiong had sustained severe injuries, so the fact that Long Chen's medicinal pill had improved her condition so quickly meant that it was extraordinary.

Lu Ziqiong’s thoughts were a bit muddled. It took her a while to recover, but when she saw Long Chen standing on the martial stage, she was alarmed.

“Why is he on the stage?!”

“That fellow provoked Long Chen, so he went up.” Mo Nian shrugged.

“Have him come back! That fellow’s power is more than what he showed just now!” cried Lu Ziqiong.

“Long Chen’s already on stage, so how can he come back empty-handed? That’s not his style,” answered Mo Nian indifferently.

“Are you not worried for him?” asked Lu Ziqiong anxiously.

“Why would I be worried for him?”

“Is he not your brother?”

“He is.”

“Then you don’t care if he dies?!”

Before Mo Nian could reply, the martial stage quivered, and the powerful devil pressure once more activated. Seeing this scene, Lu Ziqiong went pale. It was too late to call Long Chen back. He was now isolated from the outside world’s sounds.

Furthermore, this was Long Chen’s first time here, so he definitely was unaware that he had to crush the tablet on the stage to escape. In Lu Ziqiong’s mind, Long Chen would die on the stage.

Just like before, the martial stage’s devil bones lit up, causing the powerful devil pressure to rise. Everyone’s gazes concentrated on the stage once more.

“Will Big Brother Long Chen be in trouble?” Yu Tong and Yu Fei watched worriedly.

“You should be worried for Hu Yifei. That would make more sense...” Mo Nian was speechless.

On stage, Hu Yifei laughed, looking extremely pleased. “Haha, brat, you finally came. You should know that I intentionally let Lu Ziqiong off just to bait you in.”

Long Chen simply looked at him, not talking at all.

With a sinister smile, Hu Fei said, “Brat, I didn’t manage to figure out the full depth of your power in front of the gates. This time, I’ll personally cut off your head.”

“You really are a petty man,” replied Long Chen, shaking his head in amusement. He couldn't believe Hu Fei was holding a grudge over their brief spiritual battle at the city gates.

“Brat, you shouldn’t have gone together with that stupid girl. When you die, you can only blame your own bad luck,” sneered Hu Yifei with a sinister tone. After all, Long Chen had ignited a spark of clash between two major factions inside this city, so Hu Yifei wanted Long Chen dead.

Long Chen shook his head. “I feel like the youngsters in Devil Fall City aren’t very smart. Is it due to being surrounded by devil qi? All of you are incredibly arrogant. That would be fine if you actually had the power to back it up, but you’re less than dogshit. I don’t understand where this confidence stems from.”

Lu Chengfeng and the others were a bit embarrassed by this, a stinging feeling burning their faces. He was definitely talking about them.

Even Lu Ziyu reddened slightly. Seeing this, Lu Ziqiong was confused and then scolded, “I told you to escort them over! Did you...”

“Big Sister, I was wrong,” admitted Lu Ziyu immediately, lowering her head in embarrassment.

Lu Ziqiong was speechless. Back then, her intuition had hinted that Long Chen and Mo Nian were exceptional individuals, but she couldn't pinpoint what made them so special.

Due to having to focus on her battle, she had her younger sister entertain them to show her sincerity, but she had never anticipated this outcome.

On the martial stage, Hu Yifei asked, “A nameless soldier like you dares to strut around Devil Fall City? Just who gave you the guts?”

“Guts come from power. Well, I suppose it’s a waste of time talking to you. I’ll end this quickly!” Long Chen started walking toward Hu Yifei just like that.

Seeing him walking over, the spectators let out startled cries. “Fool, it hasn’t started yet!”

“This idiot, he doesn’t even know the rules. He’d probably be crushed to death by the martial stage’s pressure.”

“What a disappointment. I thought there would be a good show.”

Countless people grumbled through the crowd. Lu Ziyu and the others looked helpless. After all, this couldn’t be blamed on Long Chen, as no one had told him about this rule.

Lu Ziqiong’s hope faded upon hearing Mo Nian's words. She said, “The evenly spread pressure has completely shifted .”

“Hahaha, you really are an idiot!” Hu Yifei laughed. Just then, the martial stage’s pressure formally activated, and Hu Yifei summoned his manifestation to resist it.

A startling scene unfolded before the spectators. Despite the intense Heaven Saint pressure, Long Chen continued to walk forward effortlessly, seemingly unaffected by the formidable force bearing down on him.

“What?!” Shocked cries echoed throughout the venue, and Lu Ziqiong's eyes widened in disbelief. She had personally felt the crushing weight of this pressure; without her manifestation, she would have been unable to move.

Even as the entire martial stage shuddered, Long Chen continued to walk toward Hu Yifei. Dark currents seemed to swirl around Long Chen, yet he remained resolute and steady.

At this moment, an expert on Hu Fei’s side—the one with runes tattooed on his face—opened his mouth and shouted something. However, his words were lost amid the barrier of the martial stage, leaving everyone puzzled about what he was saying.

“What?!” Hu Yifei’s contempt was nowhere to be found, replaced with shock. Suddenly, he raised his hand, clutching a jade tablet.

“He’s going to admit defeat!” Lu Chengfeng and the others cried out.

However, before he could do so, a hand seized his wrist and violently tore off his arm. Long Chen’s icy voice then rang throughout the spectator stands. “When Boss Long San fights, there is no surrender, only reincarnation.”
