Chapter 5037 Pill Valley’s Experts

The disciples of the four divine clans found themselves surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people. All were clad in robes bearing the insignia of the Brahma Pill Valley, and thirty-six of them strode forward confidently. Sensing their formidable auras, the disciples quivered with apprehension.

Beside Feng Fei, the heavily injured Jiang Wuwang couldn’t help but cry out in shock. “Two-vein Heaven Saints!”

Thirty-six two-vein Heaven Saints stood before them, each exuding a daunting aura that dwarfed even the four clan leaders. Even Long Qihua, an extremely strong existence amongst two-vein Heaven Saints, paled in comparison to these experts.

The Long clan leader sighed in relief when he saw those thirty-six people. He said, “You’re finally here! Long Chen is right there! Kill him!”

In truth, they had arrived some time ago, but they had proceeded with utmost caution, even more so than the Long clan. They had meticulously set up multiple layers of heaven-encompassing nets. Even after Long Chen was confined within the martial stage’s cage, they remained vigilant, fortifying the surroundings with additional formations. They only acted now that their preparations were complete.

“Everyone unrelated can leave!” declared the elder with a dragon-head scepter, leading the group of thirty-six. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The pillars of light had already formed a massive barrier encompassing everyone present. The disciples hurriedly retreated toward the edges, only to find themselves drawn out by a powerful suction the moment they reached the barrier’s perimeter.

Clearly, the Brahma Pill Valley was clearing the battlefield. If these disciples didn’t leave now, then once the fighting started, they would be crushed by the shockwaves.

Actually, the Brahma Pill Valley didn’t care about these disciples. They would gladly sacrifice the disciples if they could kill Long Chen. By doing this, they wanted to give the four divine clans some face.

To avoid getting caught up in Long Chen’s fate, the disciples swiftly fled. Meanwhile, the thirty-six elders from the Brahma Pill Valley maintained an unwavering watch over Long Chen. Any suspicious move from him would trigger an immediate lockdown of their formation.

This was something the Brahma Pill Valley had agreed to do. They would kill Long Chen, but they wouldn’t harm the innocent. After all, if all these disciples died, the four divine clans would no longer have a future.

Long Chen remained silent in the face of the thirty-six two-vein Heaven Saints descending upon him. He just stared at them, with Evilmoon on his shoulder, showing no intent to break their encirclement.

The disciples were quickly evacuated. Feng Fei and Jiang Wuwang exchanged worried glances at Long Chen. Feng Fei’s anxiety was evident. “Long Chen...”

She had never expected the four divine clans would not just target Long Chen but also call over the Brahma Pill Valley. This formidable cage seemed insurmountable, even for Long Chen.

“Go. Don’t get splashed with blood,” said Long Chen lightly.

Hearing that, Feng Fei regained some confidence. She and Jiang Wuwang then walked to the edge of the barrier and were transported out.

Once outside, they were startled to find themselves far from the Long clan’s grounds. They were in the faraway wilderness. From this distance, they could only see a giant cage encompassing the heart of the Long clan.

Jiang Wuwang couldn’t help but ask, “Do you think he can escape?”

“Yes. He definitely can,” replied Feng Fei, her fists clenching.

Long Qianxue was transported out right after them. Her face was pale, and her eyes were dull. She was covered in blood, though no one could tell if it was Long Chen’s or someone else’s. Her sword was shattered, only half of it remaining in her hand.

“Senior, why have you come out as well?” asked Feng Fei curiously.

The disciples had rushed out, but the heaven vein experts were expected to stay.

“I’m one of those unrelated people. Why wouldn’t I leave?” Long Qianxue replied with a bitter smile. She stared at her broken sword and then flung it away. The shattered blade flew like a shooting star, disappearing into the distance.

“Why? Why did this happen?” Long Qianxue sighed, vexed.

Before this, she had been part of the encirclement against Long Chen. Long Chen had shattered her sword, but fortunately, she had been one step slower than the others, keeping her from being at the center of Long Chen’s attack. Otherwise, she would be a corpse now.

After Long Chen had arrived in the Long clan, it felt like she was trapped in a dream. She had walked this path step by step without fully realizing the consequences. Despite knowing that the Long clan’s actions were wrong, she hadn’t intervened. Now, things had escalated to this point.

Even if Long Chen was killed in the end, so what? The Long clan’s four Heavenly Saints had been reduced to just her, and Long Zhantian had become their mortal enemy. For the Earth Cauldron, was that really worth it?

As space quivered, another figure appeared. This time, it was Long Qianxue’s turn to cry out in surprise.

“Heaven Overseer!”

The Heaven Overseer had also come out, his expression dark as he clenched his teeth. After that, he helplessly sighed, “You fools. You’ve destroyed the Long clan.”

Feng Fei and Jiang Wuwang exchanged looks of confusion. Both Long Qianxue and the Heaven Overseer had retreated. What was really happening?

“Heaven Overseer, why is the Long clan targeting Long Chen?” asked Feng Fei.

The Heaven Overseer looked at Long Qianxue, but she winced and turned away. This was one of the Long clan’s secrets, and even the Heaven Overseer didn’t know about it. As a result, she couldn’t speak of it.

“All I can say is that the heavens toys with people!” Long Qianxue sighed.

“No, the heavens toy with people when they unleash natural disasters. This time, it was entirely a man-made disaster. You pushed my warnings into the back of your heads a long time ago. The profit in front of you might be big, but it can’t last. Furthermore, can you even obtain that profit? An inheritance requires a person to inherit it. Long Chen is a peak heavenly genius—no, calling him a peak heavenly genius doesn’t do him justice, but you still chose to turn him into your mortal enemy. Qianxue, I had high hopes for you. You’re a smart woman. I thought that with you present, they wouldn’t go too far. I’ve misjudged,” said the Heaven Overseer, his voice laced with disappointment.

Long Qianxue lowered her head in shame, filled with regret. If she had stuck to her own heart... if she hadn’t been tempted by outside influences and had stood with the Heaven Overseer from the start, things would have been different.

Unfortunately, there were not that many ifs in this world. The heavens gave them no chance to repent, and they couldn’t take back what they had done.

Although Feng Fei didn’t understand what they were talking about, she knew Long Chen well enough to make a guess. She also sighed, “Your Long clan is like this. But my Jiang clan is no better.”

She had repeatedly advised the Jiang clan leader not to be Long Chen’s enemy, but things had still progressed to this point. She could understand Long Qianxue and the Heaven Overseer’s feeling of helplessness.

Just then, they saw divine light erupt at the heart of the Long clan’s territory. That signified the beginning of the final battle. Feng Fei’s heart instantly tensed.
