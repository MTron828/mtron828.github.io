Chapter 3025 Drink While It’s Hot

Hearing that this terrifying existence was bestowing them with Heaven Merging Divine Elixir, Chu Yang and the others were overjoyed. They all prostrated themselves towards the statue, waiting for it to fall.

Just at this moment, from there the statue’s hands were clasped together in a seal, drops of dark yellow liquid slowly fell.

This liquid emitted a strong medicinal scent. Upon seeing this, Zhao Wuzheng and the others hastily received it with their hands.

“Every person gets ten drops. Don’t fight over it,” rumbled Long Chen as he tightened his belt once more. He kicked the medicinal ball in front of him forward.

There was a small hole in front of Long Chen that led to the hands of the statue. This was a stone statue, and the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit was easily capable of changing its shape.

It went without saying that the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit truly listened to Long Chen.

Hearing that they were getting ten drops, Chu Yang and the others were delighted. They took out jade bottles to store them. But in reality, every person ended up getting more than thirty drops.

“Many thanks, great senior!” cried out Chu Yang.

“There’s no need for thanks. I am one of the Divine Venerate’s subordinates, divine general Huyou. This Heaven Merging Divine Elixir is something I condensed from the essence of the world with the Starry River Sect’s karmic luck. It possesses the almighty power to bring you closer to the heavens. It can give a dead person life, extend your longevity, nourish Yin and strengthen Yang, activate all your meridians…”

This was clearly his piss mixed with some medicinal powders. Hearing him call it some almighty divine elixir, Bai Shishi and the others almost couldn’t hold back their laughter.

“Our meeting is destiny. As we work for the Divine Venerate, there’s no need to be courteous. Drink it while it’s hot,” urged Long Chen.

“While it’s hot?” Chu Yang and the others were a bit surprised. They didn’t understand what that meant, but they drank the divine elixir.

When they drank it, their expressions twitched. They frowned. The flavor was a bit strange. They glanced at each other, but no one dared to say anything.

“The divine elixir will activate your latent talent over the next hour and refresh your spirit, essence, and qi. Prepare yourselves to attack your bottlenecks. With your current cultivation bases, you will advance at least three levels,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that it had such a terrifying effect, Chu Yang and the others immediately sat cross-legged and prepared to welcome the medicinal effect.

Seeing them acting so seriously, Zhong Ling and the others almost couldn’t hold back. They covered their mouths with their hands, refusing to let their laughter escape.

Bai Shishi looked at Long Chen’s back speechlessly. This fellow was practically a devil. He was absolutely evil. If Chu Yang and the others realized what was happening, they would probably go insane. This was even worse than killing them.

However, even after an hour passed, the medicinal effect didn’t appear. It didn’t appear even after two hours.

After six hours, Chu Yang and the others were feeling that someone was off.

But just at that moment, the jade plate on Long Chen’s waist shook. Long Chen smiled. Bai Xiaole had arrived.

“Fine, it seems that the divine elixir was linked to the Starry River Sect’s karmic luck. Too much time has passed, so its effect is lacking. But this lord won’t be selfish with you. I’ll give you all this divine elixir. If there’s still no effect, then this lord also has nothing else.”

Long Chen waved his hand to Li Cai and the others. All the men immediately ran over. Bai Shishi and the others hastily turned around. As for the rest, they knew without looking.

The divine elixir streamed out like a small river, falling from the statue. A foul smell spread throughout the plaza.

Chu Yang and the others suddenly realized that something was off. This divine elixir didn’t have any medicinal fragrance. They looked up to see that the statue was gradually growing clear. Then they saw Long Chen’s bright smile that looked as if he had been blessed by the heavens.

“Long Chen!”

Chu Yang roared furiously. Zhao Wuzheng, Xie Tianyu, Lu Chunyang, Zhen Meilian, Lu Zihao, and that assassin of the Bloodkill Hall all erupted with killing intent.

“Now is there enough divine elixir?” asked Long Chen. This time, it was his own voice.

“Long Chen, I’ll tear you to pieces!” Zhao Wuzheng roared and shot through the air, unleashing a punch at the statue.

BOOM!

The statue exploded. Having lost the murals and its own defensive formation being out of energy, it had lost any defensive power.

Chu Yang and the others’ faces were contorted. They had drunk that divine elixir. If that news spread, then there would be no need for them to continue living.

“Die!”

Lu Chunyang took out a warhammer and smashed it at Long Chen. Its runes flashed, emitting shocking pressure. This was a terrifying divine item.

The other experts also charged over. They felt like they were going insane. They had never imagined that they were being tricked by Long Chen.

That was because they were all followers of Lord Brahma. The Starry River Sect and this world’s destruction were related to Lord Brahma. Their powers knew a bit about the Jialin Immortal Land’s history. Although they didn’t know the full story, they likely knew that the Starry River Sect was destroyed due to Lord Brahma’s orders.

Furthermore, the first impression was the strongest. Long Chen had used the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit’s voice to intimidate them. They really thought that some terrifying existence had been left here to make sure that no stragglers of the sect returned.

The Heaven Merging Stone Spirit’s voice in particular was so mighty that it felt like that pressure could easily crush them. That was why they hadn’t even considered that it was a trickster.

They hadn’t doubted that divine elixir at all when it fell. They directly drank it. Now that the truth was revealed…

“Everyone come out and slaughter them!” roared Xie Tianyu. Countless disciples poured out of the passageway. Chu Yang waved his hand, and the prayer beads on his wrist glowed. Those corpses throughout the palace vanished as if they had been purified.

Long Chen was startled. He looked at the prayer beads. He saw a figure carved into them. That was Fallen Daynight.

This was further evidence. Perhaps these devil kings were Lord Brahma or Fallen Daynight’s subordinates. Otherwise, with Chu Yang’s power, there was no way he dared to touch those corpses.

After the corpses vanished, countless experts of the five powers filled the palace. The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples as well as the disciples led by Luo Bing and Mu Qingyun charged out. This was the mission that Long Chen gave them. They just needed to handle those extras. The rest was left to him and Bai Shishi.

Long Chen and Bai Shishi faced off against those seven experts. Lu Chunyang’s attack was the first to arrive. His warhammer smashed towards Long Chen. This strike contained all of Lu Chunyang’s killing intent and hatred. His hatred for Long Chen had already reached a level that couldn’t be described with words.

“Why bother? I gave you my divine elixir, but you aren’t even grateful. What thankless wretches.” Long Chen sighed and shrugged his hands innocently.

BOOM!

A golden sword struck Lu Chunyang’s warhammer. It was Bai Shishi who blocked it. The entire palace trembled from the exchange. Dust fell from the roof as if the palace might collapse at any moment.

“Even a defeated general dares to act tough? Let’s have a battle to the death here.”

Bai Shishi’s white robes fluttered. Sword in hand, countless golden runes flowed around her. She was like a golden war goddess, noble and untouchable.
