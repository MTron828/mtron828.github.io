Chapter 4243: Most Trusted Companions

Long Chen’s Blood Qi ignited, unleashing a torrent of violent power in the form of a golden sphere of light.

BOOM!

To everyone’s surprise, Ye Wuchen and the Ghost Dao lifeform’s attacks simply exploded on contact with that sphere of light. Moreover, the sphere of light wasn’t affected at all and continued growing in every direction.

“What?! Their attacks were simply crushed by Long Chen’s aura?!” Shocked cries echoed through the crowd. Long Chen had only unleashed his aura, yet it had shattered both of their powerful attacks. This scene left everyone utterly stunned.

With Long Chen's Blood Qi raging, waves of astral winds radiated outward in all directions. He was in the eye of a hurricane, with the tempest of astral winds swirling wildly across the entire martial stage. At the same time, the deafening rumblings shook people’s ears.

Ye Wuchen and the Ghost Dao lifeform, being the closest to Long Chen, found themselves steadily pushed back by the force of the astral winds.

The space beneath their feet quaked as they tried to stabilize themselves, but they were still continuously forced back.

The current Long Chen seemed like a dragon god looking down on the rest of the world. Moreover, there was an enormous figure within his divine ring, a figure of a giant golden dragon. However, it was so big that people were only able to see a portion of its body through the divine ring, not its full body.

At this time, the various races’ armies were terrified by what they were facing, so they involuntarily slowed their assaults.

“Don’t be afraid! We will crush him in one blow!” It was unknown where this shout came from.

Following that, the experts of multiple races crashed toward Long Chen. In front of that endless tide of experts, Long Chen suddenly raised his head and roared.

“Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens!”

Simultaneously, as he let out a thunderous roar, a dragon's roar resonated from his divine ring. These roars then intertwined, producing a voice that seemed to echo from the primal chaos era. It carried the power of time and a wild bloodlust.

Soundwaves then rippled in front of Long Chen, resembling a tsunami

“Not good!”

Witnessing the soundwaves distort and rupture the very void, the expressions of many experts underwent a drastic change, and they hastily retreated. Wherever the waves went, countless experts blew apart. These soundwaves killed all enemies, regardless of their race and affiliation.

As a result, the various races fell into chaos. The ones at the front were trying to retreat, while those at the rear didn’t know what was happening and were still trying to advance. In the chaos, they could neither advance nor retreat.

The ones who witnessed the unfolding catastrophe were horrified, as they had never encountered such terrifying soundwaves before. Even Supreme experts didn’t have the slightest ability to resist them.

Countless experts were directly slain, turning the inside of the martial stage into a scene of scarlet chaos. No one knew just how many experts had carelessly lost their lives to this one roar from Long Chen.

BOOM!

Just then, the void quivered and lily leaves covered the sky. Hundreds of thousands of experts from the Devil Eye Water Lily race had summoned their true bodies and raised their defensive formation.

BANG!

However, those lily leaves were directly blasted apart by the soundwaves. Even the Devil Eye Water Lily race was unable to resist that attack.

Even so, after passing through their defenses, Long Chen’s roar had lost much of its power. Despite it continuing onward, it no longer had much killing power, at least not enough to threaten these experts.

“An insignificant trick! You dare to act arrogant with just this? I’ll deal with you!”

As the Devil Eye Water Lily race managed to suppress Long Chen’s dragon roar, Lian Wuying shot forward, her manifestation bursting into existence. Within an endless immortal pool, a heaven-shrouding water lily bloomed.

The lily glowed, and in an instant, she traversed the battlefield. In her hand materialized a peculiar weapon—a lily seed pod, within which flickered a divine radiance of five colors. With the speed of a meteor, she hurled it at Long Chen.

The void directly crumbled before the onslaught of this seed pod, leaving behind a visible scar in the void. The five-colored divine radiance contained five kinds of divine energy: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

“Although you aren’t a person, you also need to know reverence.”

Long Chen snorted and directly reached out a hand, his five fingers like claws closing in on the five-colored lily seed pod.

BOOM!

A burst of five-colored divine radiance erupted, causing the heavens and earth to shake. Gasps of astonishment filled the air as Long Chen securely caught Lian Wuying's five-colored seed pod. Observing the surging energy waves, everyone was left in awe and disbelief.

“What level of power is this?!” Even innate Heaven Venerates felt afraid in front of them.

Lian Wuying’s strength was unquestionable. After all, she had crushed a dark domain lord all on her own, easily slaying it.

As for that five-colored lily seed pod of hers, it caused even the Heavenly Daos to crumble, which meant that this attack was absolutely terrifying. However, Long Chen had forcibly received it.

Contrary to everyone's expectations, Lian Wuying's expression remained unchanged upon witnessing her weapon being caught. Her manifestation quivered as she recalled it back.

The void beneath their feet then shattered like ice. Lian Wuying was calling back her weapon, but Long Chen didn’t even budge. That five-colored lily seed pod seemed to have melded with Long Chen’s hand.

“Long Chen, this Lian Wuying is mine.”

Just then, Liu Ruyan’s voice rang out from behind Long Chen. She had already led the Undying race’s experts over to Long Chen’s camp, increasing their power.

“That isn’t important. What is important is that you have to protect my brothers,” said Long Chen without looking back.

“And why is that?” demanded Liu Ruyan furiously.

“Because we are companions who can trust each other,” said Long Chen.

Upon hearing this, Liu Ruyan’s expression became odd. She couldn’t help grumbling, “Only a ghost would be your trusted companion.”

However, Liu Ruyan did not continue acting stubborn. Although she wanted to personally fight Lian Wuying, she actually endured it because of Long Chen.

“Those who can risk their lives to help me are all my brothers and sisters. If they are willing to risk their lives for me, then I am also willing to risk my life for them. Please help me.” Long Chen’s voice softened. There was even a pleading note to it.

All the experts who had come to help him were moved when they heard this. It was now clear that with Long Chen’s power, there had been no need for them to help him.

Hence, these words struck them in the softest parts of their hearts. It felt like even if they had to die for Long Chen, they would be willing.

Liu Ruyan was also startled. In all her years knowing Long Chen, it was her first time hearing him speak like that to her. As a result, her own heart softened.

“Don’t worry, I will personally guarantee their safety,” promised Liu Ruyan. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Hearing that, Long Chen fully relaxed. But then, a violet sword pierced through the air out of nowhere, striking Long Chen.

BOOM!

Long Chen released the five-colored lily seed pod and shot back like a shooting star.

“Xu Yifeng!”

].

Guo Ran and the others were enraged. The attacker was the heavenly genius of the Violet Blood race’s Xu family, Xu Yifeng. He had been hiding for a long time, only to suddenly launch a sneak attack at this moment. Long Chen was actually struck by him.

“Stop him!”

Suddenly, a shriek rang out.

People were stunned to see Long Chen actually flying toward another light pillar.

After that, Long Chen slashed a black dagger at that light pillar.
