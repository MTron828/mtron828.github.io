Chapter 3498

“Sir…” Long Chen started.

“Who is sir?! Do you not see that I am a woman?!” raged that person.

“If you didn’t say, I really wouldn’t be able to tell.” Long Chen shook his head.

This person was short and thick. Within the crowd, it really was difficult to tell if she was a man or a woman. Furthermore, her voice was very rough.

“Cut the crap! You dared to take advantage of me. Today, if you don’t pay thirty immortal king crystals, don’t even think about leaving this place!” The woman pointed her finger, which was as thick as a summer radish, at Long Chen.

“Extortion?” Long Chen frowned.

“Little fellow, I clearly saw you touched her just now. Your taste is pretty heavy. Well, just spend the money and treat it as a lesson.” A man from the side joined in. He had a sharp mouth and monkey cheeks.

The people who had just gotten off of the boat with Long Chen looked at him sympathetically. It seemed that since Long Chen’s cultivation base was the lowest and he looked scholarly and weak, he was the first target of these people. They were going to force him to pay.

Theoretically, Long Chen could just pay the thirty immortal king crystals and be done with it. But on the flying boat, an expert had given them pointers.

If they took out any immortal king crystals, then all kinds of extortions would come until you had to squeeze out even your bone marrow.

If you encountered such a person, it would be best to run away. If you couldn’t, then hopefully you could state your status and scare them off.

That kind elder had said that they could always pretend to be disciples from some major forces. They should act a bit more tyrannical to scare the swindlers off.

If they tossed out one or two immortal king crystals with the attitude of shooing off beggars, then both sides could take a step back.

The other side clearly knew that you might just be acting, but they were also afraid of kicking an iron board. Thus, they would mostly choose to keep the peace. Getting one or two immortal king crystals was also profitable.

It was just a play, but if you didn’t act it out properly and the other side saw through you, then you could only count yourself as unlucky.

The people on the boat were just strangers who had briefly traveled together. Hence, they naturally didn’t speak up for Long Chen and just watched from a distance, trying to avoid falling for similar scams themselves.

Also, the few guards that were standing here had long since grown numb to such things and didn’t care. In truth, they wouldn’t care no matter what because they were also snakes. This kind of extortion came with benefits for them as well.

“When it comes to money, I do have quite a bit…” said Long Chen with embarrassment.

Upon hearing that, the woman’s eyes brightened, as did the eyes of the surrounding people.

It seemed that this person was a fat sheep with no experience at all. He even said that he had money.

“... But I don’t want to give it to you. So what can we do?” finished Long Chen.

“Brat, are you looking to die? Do you know what kind of place this is?!” barked a fierce-looking expert.

When they heard this person shout, the others hastily created an open space for him. Dozens of Immortal Kings instantly surrounded Long Chen.

“Brat, don’t regret it when it is too late. The Chaotic Star Sea has its own rules. Also, I’ve changed plans. You’ve touched me, and without three thousand immortal king crystals, don’t even think about leaving this place alive,” sneered the first woman. Hearing that Long Chen had money, she immediately increased her demand.

“I really don’t understand. Do you not have the slightest respect in your heart? Do you know that you are gambling with your lives like this? You think that this is a shortcut, without realizing that the shortcut is a gamble. No matter how many times you experienced the sweet taste of victory, just one loss and you’ll never make a comeback. Are you really so foolish?” Long Chen sighed.

Seeing that Long Chen was starting to talk reason with these fiends, countless people shook their heads. Was this person a bookworm? In their view, he was like a sheep trying to advise hungry wolves to become vegetarians.

“Who’s going to listen to your crap?! Hand over the money or die!” The woman finally lost her patience and reached out to grab Long Chen’s collar.

Her hand had just extended when a cold light flew out. After that, that woman shrieked like a pig being slaughtered. Her arm that was like a pig's trotter flew out.

Cold light continued to flash. When it was gone, every person around Long Chen had a bloody hole in their head.

Other than that fat woman and the monkey-faced man, everyone around Long Chen was dead.

“A sword cultivator?!”

The experts present were all shocked. The moment Long Chen made his move, the sharp sword intent stabbed their souls, making their minds dazed. At that moment, they felt like their lives were no longer their own and could be taken by Long Chen at will.

The noisy world instantly fell silent. People didn’t even dare to move.

They had originally thought that with Long Chen’s slim figure and low cultivation base, the giant saber on his back had to be nothing more than an accessory to scare others. They had even felt it to be comical.

But once he attacked, his sword will made everyone jump. That woman was so scared that she even forgot to shout or cry. She just stared in horror at him.

“I really don’t understand you. In this dangerous cultivation world, you carry no respect in your heart. For the tiniest of profits, you don’t mind bullying others, even killing them for money. Was it worth it?” Long Chen looked at her.

“Senior, don’t kill me, don’t kill me! I’ll give you money, I’ll give you all my money!” The woman finally cried, her snot and mucus flying out. She reached out to touch her spatial ring.

But the next moment, Long Chen’s sword flashed and his Sword Qi pierced her head. As she collapsed on the ground limply, the spatial ring on her hand slowly rolled off.

Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to waste words on her. He even used a sword because he felt that his saber would be wasted on such people. It was practically an insult to the Minghong Saber.

He had actually wanted to be a peaceful person. After all, he had more important things to do here, and so he needed to be a bit more low-key.

However, seeing their wretched faces, what he had planned to do and what he had done now had two completely different conclusions. In the end, his intelligence was still unable to beat his instinct.

“Senior, don’t kill me! I…” That monkey-faced man was so scared that his whole body turned limp.

“I won’t kill you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Many thanks, senior, many thanks-”

But all of a sudden, Long Chen kicked his Dantian. As a result, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, and everyone felt his cultivation base instantly turn to nothing.

Everyone’s heart pounded. This kick had crippled this man’s cultivation base. In this lifetime, he would never be able to cultivate again. He had become a cripple.

“You said that you saw me touch her. Then your eyes are useless.”

“AHH!”

The monkey-faced man screamed as his eyes were crushed by Long Chen. This seemingly scholarly black-robed man was actually so vicious. They had all misjudged him.

Suddenly, the crowd surged and a new group of people came charging in ferociously, with their leader being a half-step World King. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Who dares to-”

A streak of sword-light flew over and that person’s body quivered. His head then fell to the ground.

“I am Boss Long San. I’m fresh off the boat, and I’ll ask for some extra care from all of you.”

Long Chen didn’t even look back. After killing that half-step World King, he indifferently walked away, leaving behind a group of dumbstruck people.
