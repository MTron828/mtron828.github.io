Chapter 3834 Double Supreme

The arrogant Ji Wuming finally revealed a look of trepidation when he saw the Asura mark on the Nine Underworld Luocha’s forehead.

“Ji Wuming, you coward. You’ve already started merging your Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone, but you still dodge me. Are you planning on hiding like a tortoise your entire life? In the three thousand worlds, I have two things to do. One is to kill that bastard Long Chen, while the other is to defeat you, you turtle. Last time, Long Chen fled, and you did as well. Today, I followed you all the way to this tomb. Let’s see where you can run this time.” The Nine Underworld Luocha looked at Ji Wuming coldly, and blood-colored runes flowed within her eyes. Her aura was sinister and violent, without a shred of the human race’s characteristics within her. She seemed to have just finished some kind of metamorphosis.

“Can we not discuss our matter later? I know that you want to defeat me to win back face for your master. But it doesn’t seem that this is the right time, right? This heavenly tomb is hiding an unknown number of secrets and treasures. It would be a waste of time to fight now. Why not change the time and decide victory and defeat another day?” said Ji Wuming.

The Nine Underworld Luocha looked at him suspiciously. “Are you sure you’re not tricking me? You’re looking for another chance to run, right?”

“Hahaha!” Ji Wuming laughed arrogantly, disdainfully saying, “Nine Underworld Luocha, do you really think that I’m afraid of you? You’re wrong. You and your master are wrong. The two of you are far too naive. What you have seen of me is only what my master and I wanted you to see. My master has always told me to endure and not fight you directly. That is simply a kind of trial he gave me. He told me that when my bone and blood start to merge, this trial ends. Although the current me has yet to fully become a Double Supreme, this trial is already done with. I can fight you at any time I want. To tell the truth, I also have a temper. I also wish to decide which of us is stronger.”

“Double Supreme?”

Mo Nian and the others instantly understood why Yin Changsheng and Shi Yang were so afraid of Ji Wuming. So, he had actually taken that step and started merging his Supreme Blood with his Supreme Bone.

As they were in the flying shuttle, they were isolated from the outside world and hadn’t sensed Ji Wuming’s fluctuations. But now, they understood what was going on.

A Double Supreme was someone possessing both a Supreme Bone and Supreme Blood. It had to be known that ninety-nine percent of Supreme experts either had only a Supreme Bone or only Supreme Blood. Very rarely did people possess both.

Furthermore, even if they did have both, the chances of the two being able to merge were very low. A forceful merge would cause them both to be destroyed.

And even if the conditions were met for the merge, it would require a large amount of primal chaos qi as a buffer to prevent the two forces from clashing. Without that, there was no way to become a Double Supreme.

Double Supremes were a mix of both talent and financial power. Only some exceedingly ancient sects had managed to preserve a bit of primal chaos qi, and that bit of primal chaos qi was viewed as top secret by the sect. Perhaps only the sect masters would know of it.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

This trace of primal chaos qi was their last hope to produce a Double Supreme. A single Double Supreme was enough to directly lead a sect to glory.

However, in this world, Double Supremes were incredibly rare. Regular Supremes were already rare, but a Double Supreme amongst Supremes was even rarer. Also, people who had this potential and actually succeeded in becoming Double Supremes were next to none.

Ji Wuming was the first Double Supreme that Long Chen and the others had seen. Although he had just taken the first step to the merger, he could still be counted as a Double Supreme.

The first step was the most difficult step to become a Double Supreme. Now that he had succeeded, all that was left was to gather enough primal chaos qi, and he would naturally become a fully-fledged Double Supreme.

It was no wonder that the current Ji Wuming was so confident and unafraid of any of them. He no longer needed to be low-key as he had overwhelming power.

The Nine Underworld Luocha seemed to believe what Ji Wuming was saying. However, she didn’t seem to feel much pressure over this Double Supreme existence. She also confidently said, “Fine, I’ll trust you this time. If you dodge me next time and refuse to fight, although I won’t kill you, I’ll definitely make you pay a painful price for lying to me.”

Seeing her agree, Ji Wuming smiled and didn’t say anything. He then turned to Yin Changsheng and Shi Yang.

At this moment, Shi Yang’s expression was gloomy. Ji Wuming had killed his powerful subordinate, and that was like slapping his face in front of everyone. It was a huge insult.

“A Double Supreme? I, Shi Yang, refuse to believe in such nonsense. You must pay the price for killing my subordinate,” said Shi Yang darkly.

BOOM!

As Shi Yang’s body quivered, corpse qi erupted out of him. This violent power caused the ground to shake and cracks to spread throughout the land.

“The Corpse Devil Dao’s abilities truly are heaven-defying. He just obtained this immemorial corpse, but he can already control it. If Ji Wuming’s dagger is unable to pierce this corpse, he might not be able to win against Shi Yang,” said Mo Nian when he saw this.

Shi Yang’s first body had been destroyed by Long Chen, and he had found a new body. Based on what he had said before, he even profited from that death, which caused his soul to get even stronger.

After that, he abandoned that corpse for one of the immemorial corpses from this tomb. That meant that this corpse was even stronger than the last.

This new corpse was clearly incredibly powerful. With just a look, it was obvious that this corpse had belonged to a body cultivator.

A body cultivator’s body was impervious to blade or spear, fire or water. They could even use their body to receive a divine weapon. Hence, if Ji Wuming was unable to damage this new body, he would be restrained.

Even so, he wouldn’t necessarily be beaten. Whether or not Shi Yang was in an undefeatable position was based on whether Ji Wuming’s weapon was sharp enough.

For Shi Yang to dare to fight Ji Wuming, he clearly thought that his body was strong enough. As long as he could receive one attack, that would basically decide things.

Everyone was holding their breath as they watched Ji Wuming and Shi Yang. They all retreated, not wanting to get drawn into their battlefield. They quickly created a wide open space for them. Shi Yang’s aura continued to crazily climb. It seemed that this body of his had endless power.

“I can sense her. She’s right below.”

Suddenly, a voice rang out beside Long Chen and the others. They instantly jumped in horror.

At this climactic moment, the elder that Guo Ran was carrying suddenly spoke. As soon as he did, Shi Yang, Ji Wuming, Yin Changsheng, and the Nine Underworld Luocha’s eyes turned toward them like sharp blades.
