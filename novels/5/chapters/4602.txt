Chapter 4591 Blood Sacrifice Dragon Tooth

BOOM!

Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings spread as he shot at Netherdragon Tianzhao, starlight covering his entire body.

Startled, Netherdragon Tianzhao raised his dragon spear against Long Chen’s fist. With an explosive sound, the impact sent both of them reeling backward.

Netherdragon Tianzhao spat out blood, shocked to discover that Long Chen had more energy left than he did.

“Kill him together!”

At that moment, the Netherdragon race’s peak experts charged forward. Although they had used up all their energy in their last attack, within their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, their recovery was rapid. Hence, they had recovered to around sixty percent of their full power. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

While still not at their peak, the same applied to Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao. After enduring a grueling battle, they were akin to arrows nearing the end of their flight.

Suddenly, Huo Linger vanished, and Long Chen started to chant. A sacred scripture echoed across heaven and earth as flames surged in Long Chen’s hand, coalescing into a flame lotus.

“He still has energy left?!”

The spectators in the distance were shocked. While they hadn’t seen the entirety of Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s battle, just catching the end already left them speechless. In their view, neither Long Chen nor Netherdragon Tianzhao could have that much energy left.

However, when that flame lotus appeared in Long Chen’s hand, the world changed color. His flame energy scoured the heavens, shaking people’s souls.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!” Long Chen roared, and the flames in his hand expanded crazily, devouring this entire space. This was the result of the merger between Huo Linger’s flame energy and Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength plus flame will.

BOOM!

As the enormous flame lotus fell on the ground, a wave of fire spread in every direction, incinerating countless Netherdragon experts into nothing but ashes. Less than a hundred of them survived.

This attack even affected the other Ten Thousand Dragon Nests, melting some of them and exposing the ancestral scale at the core.

The spectators had previously hidden within the caves, and after seeing that devastation, they all gasped.

Long Chen was panting for breath as he had hit his limit. He felt like his soul would split open. Using the Purgatory Eyes really took its toll on him, especially on his soul.

Long Chen spread his Kunpeng wings and flew straight toward a lump of earth. That lump suddenly blew apart, revealing Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“He’s not dead yet?!”

The spectators were startled to see him. Long Chen’s attack just now had been targeting Netherdragon Tianzhao, so theoretically, the latter had borne the brunt of its impact. Yet, he still survived, showcasing an astonishing resilience.

Long Chen’s fist smashed toward him. Unexpectedly, Netherdragon Tianzhao lifted someone with his hand and flung them toward Long Chen.

Long Chen’s fist then blew apart a seven-star Doyen, causing a rain of blood to fall. Using this chance, Netherdragon Tianzhao quickly shot back toward the ancestral scale.

“Lei Linger, stop him!”

Long Chen suddenly realized something and shouted at Lei Linger. He knew he wouldn’t be able to catch up to Netherdragon Tianzhao in time.

Lei Linger had regained her freedom thanks to Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus, so she immediately formed hand seals upon hearing Long Chen’s command.

A wall of lightning formed around the ancestral scale, blocking Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Blood Sacrifice Dragon Tooth!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao spat a mouthful of blood onto his spear, igniting it with vitality. At the same time, the ancestral scale seemed to receive a summons and unleashed a ray of divine light.

The ray of divine light then pierced Lei Linger’s lightning wall, intertwining with Netherdragon Tianzhao like an ethereal rope. Before Long Chen’s follow-up attack could connect, Netherdragon Tianzhao had vanished without a trace.

However, a furious roar still echoed out. “Long Chen, just you wait! Once I subdue this reverse scale, I’ll make you kneel and repent!”

Long Chen slapped his leg in frustration. He had been just a step too slow, allowing Netherdragon Tianzhao to slip into the dragon scale’s space

“Senior, help me out! Shatter this dragon scale! I’m going to turn this fellow into stew!” exclaimed Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron retorted, “Don’t be foolish. I would be infected by its blood if I did that. My power is not even one ten-thousandth of my peak, so I wouldn’t be able to deal with the consequences. Furthermore, while you may have diverted the Emperor Blood Silk Net to another realm, it remains locked onto us. Who knows when it will reappear again? Furthermore, you should be mentally prepared. That net cannot be broken, and it will be like an unremovable maggot. Also, your eye is severely wounded. You should focus on what’s important instead of wasting time on this worthless fellow.”

“The net will still return?”

Long Chen was startled. He had been unable to draw the Emperor Blood Silk Net into the primal chaos space, so he had used the power of the Purgatory Eyes to send it into a crack in space.

According to reason, it should be lost in the endless chaotic flow of space, never to appear again.

“The Emperor Blood Silk Net is more formidable than you realize. Sending it into the chaotic flow of space won’t rid you of it. You’re too optimistic. It will return, and it will be even stronger. Time is running short. You must strengthen yourself, or it will catch us off guard when we refine pills together,” warned the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen’s heart sank at the warning. He had just obtained the eighth star’s pill formula and still needed to gather all the ingredients. Without the Earth Cauldron’s help, he would be doomed.

“Then what am I supposed to be doing?” asked Long Chen, his thoughts a mess.

“Fool, what did you come here for in the first place?” snapped the Earth Cauldron irritably.

Long Chen stared blankly. He didn’t know if it was due to using the Purgatory Eyes, but his thoughts were muddled and unclear.

“You’re after the Sovereign scale. What are you wasting time for?” continued the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen slapped his leg again, realizing his purpose. He was indeed after the Sovereign scale. As he was just about to set off, the Earth Cauldron interjected, “But it would be futile to pursue the Sovereign scale now. Seek out the white dragon race and harness their sacred energy to heal yourself.”

Long Chen nodded in agreement. When his gaze swept through the battlefield, he noticed that Lei Linger and Huo Linger had returned, having decimated the remaining Netherdragon forces without waiting for his command.

The corpses of the Netherdragon experts were everywhere, but the intact corpses were the elites among elites. Long Chen tossed them into the primal chaos space. Ignoring the astonished gazes of countless dragon experts, he departed.
