Chapter 3679 Three Thousand Worlds

Three thousand worlds?

Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran all had no idea what this place was.

Xia Guhong explained, “The three thousand worlds are worlds floating on a current, moving throughout the nine heavens. The surface is almost parallel to the Violet Flame Heaven. Also, the three thousand worlds are existences from the primal chaos era. Due to their constant movement, the tribulation from the desolate era did not reach them. In them, the laws of the three thousand worlds were not destroyed, and it also preserved the primal chaos energy which is extremely sparse in the Violet Flame Heaven now. This primal chaos energy is what you need the most urgently right now. Almost anyone who advances to the Immortal King realm within the three thousand worlds will condense a Heavenly Dao Crown. Furthermore, the Heavenly Dao Crowns are split between bronze, silver, gold, dark gold, and violet gold. If you want to resist the suppression of faith energy, you will need at least a dark gold Heavenly Dao Crown.”

“Big brother, you also know about what happened on the Nine Underworld Island?” asked Long Chen, feeling shocked.

“I don’t know. But based on the injury to your eye, I can guess what you did. To be able to break a faith net in the Divine Lord realm, perhaps you are the only person capable of it. It’s nothing surprising,” said Xia Guhong with a smile.

The Wine God Palace appeared to be isolated from the rest of the world, but it also seemed as if they were aware of every single thing that occurred in the outside world.

“Everyone can condense a Heavenly Dao Crown? Then won’t everyone be competing in the three thousand worlds?” asked Guo Ran.

“That is correct, and it’s not only limited to the Violet Flame Heaven’s people either. Many heavenly geniuses will come across heavens. They won’t give up this chance. When the time comes, ten thousand races will descend upon the Violet Flame Heaven. There will be countless heavenly geniuses. Demons, devils, ghosts, and monsters will all appear. Some particular fellows that have been sealed for countless years will also come out. When that happens, the very heavens of the Violet Flame Heaven will change. The Dao-protectors of those monsters will also come with them. The reason I summoned you wasn’t because I’m worried about you encountering those monsters. It’s because I’m worried that once your temper explodes and you kill those monsters, you will make those Dao-protectors interfere. Those fellows will come from powerful races and have no misgivings. Some are also natural enemies of the human race. I don’t want you to end up being at a disadvantage,” said Xia Guhong.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart warmed. This feeling of having a big brother looking after him was truly a blessing.

“Big brother, are you saying that great chaos is about to descend upon the Violet Flame Heaven?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. Some old monsters have started to silently infiltrate the Violet Flame Heaven. That means that they have also read the lines of fate and foreseen the general time of the gate’s opening. More and more experts will come from all kinds of races and powers. When that moment comes, heavenly geniuses will be as common as dogs. A battle will be difficult to avoid. If there’s a battle, there will be casualties, and if there are casualties, there will be enmity. And enmities are repaid with blood. The Violet Flame Heaven will be like a giant ball of gunpowder. The slightest spark will cause everything to explode. In order to protect their own heavenly geniuses, their protectors will all be old monsters. With your current power, you will only be able to flee in front of them. You might not even have a chance to get away. You cannot be careless,” warned Xia Guhong.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen nodded obediently. “I won’t be careless. This time, us three brothers were beaten badly by Liao Bencang. We don’t dare to mess around again!”

Hearing that, Xia Guhong laughed. “Your guts are already big enough. You actually dared to run to the Nine Underworld Island. That is where the Nine Underworld Hall’s faith energy is strongest other than the Heaven Gathering Mountain. Liao Bencang had the support of that much faith energy, and most Divine Venerates would have to flee from him. Hence, for you to live proves your power. If news of that spread, it will definitely shake the Violet Flame Heaven.”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen felt much better after hearing that. If even most Divine Venerates weren’t a match for Liao Bencang in that state, their wretched defeat wasn’t embarrassing.

“Big brother, do you know of the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror?” asked Long Chen.

“I do.”

Long Chen was startled. For Xia Guhong to make such a curt response, it seemed that the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror involved a lot of taboo topics. He didn’t dare to randomly discuss it.

“Then after it is broken, can it be repaired? Or can he build a new Star Peering Heavenly Mirror?” asked Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t even mention Fallen Daynight’s name. He was rather subtle.

“Repairing it is impossible. As for rebuilding a new one, it is impossible without ten thousand years of effort,” said Xia Guhong.

“Hehe, good!”

Long Chen was relieved. Ten thousand years? They might as well not even try rebuilding it.

This way, all the nine star heirs throughout the nine heavens and ten lands could grow freely. Thinking of how they would no longer be prey to be slaughtered, Long Chen felt like everything was worth it.

It could be said that his trip to the Nine Underworld Island had been more than just dangerous. Thinking about it carefully, he had been very lucky.

He didn’t know if he had benefited from Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s luck, but things had gone surprisingly smoothly. Furthermore, they even managed to flee thanks to the two of them. Without them, even if Long Chen had managed to destroy the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, he wouldn’t have been able to escape alive.

All this time, he had always been fighting alone. Now that he had found his brothers again, he felt that there was nothing that they couldn’t do together. It truly was good to have his brothers back.

Long Chen wanted to ask more about the three thousand worlds, but Xia Guhong didn’t reveal much. He only said that Long Chen would naturally understand once he entered.

He knew that Xia Guhong refused to speak for his own benefit. Any major secrets relating to the Heavenly Daos could not be randomly discussed. Accumulating that much karma was not good.

In the next few days, Long Chen accompanied Xia Chen and Guo Ran. Other than cultivation, they went to pay their respects to the Wine God Palace’s experts. They drank all kinds of wine.

When Guo Ran and Xia Chen saw that winged devil expert, they jumped just like Long Chen had back then.

Long Chen wanted to pay his respects to the High Priest this time, but he found that the High Priest had left on a wandering trip, so he only stayed within the Wine God Palace.

Half a month passed quickly. Long Chen’s cultivation base reached the eleventh Heavenstage. As for his aura, it didn’t change, but the Violet Tower Star had gone through a shocking upgrade. It actually reached the fifth star transformation. The speed stunned even Long Chen.

However, that also proved that the Violet Tower Star’s nine star transformations were related to his cultivation base. His seven-color divine ring was now completely stable. Although the violet divine ring was clearly a bit dimmer, Long Chen could sense that he would still be able to fight even in Liao Bencang’s faith domain. It would no longer be directly crushed.

“Boss, boss, someone has come to challenge the Wine God Palace!” Long Chen was in the middle of cultivating when Guo Ran ran over excitedly.
