Chapter 4028 Slaying an Earth Venerate

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist smashed down with overwhelming power, crashing down upon those three elders who had just forced back Jiang Huixin and were chasing after her.

Long Chen charged forward like a furious battle god, his speed so fast that it caused the very void to collapse. The ferocity of his strike enveloped all three of them, causing a wild wave of sand to rise and the Grand Dao runes to shatter. Within this wild tempest, they couldn’t see clearly, so they fell back.

“Who’s there?!”

All three of them felt their Blood Qi flipping inside of them, but they were surprised to not sense the other side’s three-flower aura. Thus, one of them shouted furiously.

This person was precisely the expert of the Violet Thunderclap Empire, Weng Tianyao’s master.

“Your dad!”

A sneer rang out. After that, a pair of golden wings appeared and a fist smashed toward Weng Tianyao’s master.

When this elder finally saw Long Chen, his eyes were full of disbelief. He refused to believe that the person to knock them back was actually this little Immortal King.

Seeing Long Chen actually dare to attack him, he furiously stabbed his sword at Long Chen’s chest. He didn’t believe that Long Chen would dare to ignore his attack.

Contrary to his expectations, the direction of Long Chen’s fist didn’t change, and an invisible force suddenly knocked aside his sword, forcing it off its original path.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist then smashed into the face of Weng Tianyao’s master, causing countless cracks to appear on his head. The impact was so potent that it nearly took his life.

His power had been focused in his sword, and he hadn’t anticipated some mysterious energy to cause his attack to miss. Thus, Long Chen’s fist came very close to shattering his head.

Weng Tianyao’s master was instantly sent flying and vanished without a trace.

“What a shame. I just missed a little bit.” Long Chen sighed inside. He had almost killed his enemy with this attack.

If Long Chen had summoned the Dragon King Battle Armor, this attack would have definitely blown him apart. But if he had summoned it, the latter would have sensed the threat of death and refused to fight Long Chen.

Just like that, Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings flapped, and he vanished, chasing after Weng Tianyao’s master.

“Three flowers condense, five qis are born!”

Weng Tianyao’s master was covered in cold sweat. He roared, and with just a thought, his almost broken head rapidly healed.

At the same time, flames erupted from his three flowers, as he no longer dared to be the slightest bit careless. He actually ignited the power of his three flowers.

Seeing Long Chen chasing after him, he knew that if he was forced into a passive position, what awaited him was a furious tempest of attacks.

Long Chen was the typical case of a frontal attacker who would push the enemy toward death through constant attacks once he took the advantage, not giving his enemy the room to recover.

As an expert who had experienced countless battles, Weng Tianyao’s master knew that if he dodged, he would only die faster. So, he had to counterattack, even if he was still injured.

“Violet Lightning Pierces the Clouds!”

As Weng Tianyao’s master merged with his sword, his three flowers quivered. He then attacked with his sharpest killing blow, fighting for his chance to recover.

As long as he could force Long Chen back, he would have a chance to recover. It would also buy time for his comrades to assist him.

To his surprise, his all-out attack struck nothing but empty air. The Long Chen who had been charging at him turned out to be just an illusory image.

“Not good!”

A chilling realization washed over him, causing his hair to stand on end. A dreadful sense of impending doom engulfed him.

“Three flower protection!”

He suddenly found that he had lost track of Long Chen, who was so fast that his perception couldn’t keep track of him. Hence, his three flowers spread above his head, forming a giant barrier around him.

He couldn’t sense Long Chen, so he had no idea where Long Chen would come from, leaving him only able to unleash an omnidirectional defense. But that caused his defensive power to plummet.

Even so, there was no way around it. He didn’t dare to gamble, afraid that by the time he sensed where Long Chen was coming from, it would be too late to block him.

Just as he summoned this protection, Long Chen’s hand was like claws tearing through his defense.

As the protective barrier around him crumbled, the three flowers that represented his power vanished, causing Weng Tianyao's master to cough up blood. But the moment his defenses crumbled, he sensed where Long Chen was, and his sword slashed toward him.

BOOM!

The impact shattered the arm of Weng Tianyao’s master and sent his sword flying.

“Die!”

Just as Long Chen was preparing to launch the killing blow, the other two elders arrived. However, Long Chen didn’t even look at them.

Long Chen’s foot simply stamped down on Weng Tianyao’s master, and the latter instinctively raised his arm to block, only for that arm to be broken as well.

It had to be known that in the trial by fire, Long Chen’s physical body had been strengthened crazily. So, even three-flower Earth Venerates were a far cry from him now.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Seeing Long Chen ignore them to attack Weng Tianyao’s master, the two elders were surprised and angered. They immediately prepared full-power attacks for him.

But before they could do so, the void collapsed and two flame swords slashed down. Yu Qingxuan and Jiang Huixin had also joined in the fray, attacking them from behind.

If the two elders wanted to attack Long Chen, the defenseless Long Chen might die. But they would also have no chance of survival.

In an instant, their hearts grew cold as they realized that everything was within Long Chen’s calculations. He had grasped the battlefield’s tempo perfectly.

Unless they were willing to exchange their lives for Long Chen’s, they could only give up on attacking him. Unable to make such a resolution, they chose to switch to blocking.

Two explosive sounds then rang out. As Jiang Huixin’s sword slashed down, her target hacked up blood, and even his weapon cracked. Clearly, on his own, he wasn’t a match for Jiang Huixin.

Jiang Huixin was powerful. If it was a one-against-one or even a one-against-two, she would have victory in her grasp. But she was at an immense disadvantage against three.

As for Yu Qingxuan, her Blood Qi flipped inside of her after the impact, but her target also didn’t get off lightly. Rainbow flames burned his body, consuming his core energy.

With Jiang Huixin coming, they didn’t dare to continue fighting in this condition and fled in fright. They simply didn’t have the power to save their comrade.

The next moment, Long Chen’s claw stabbed through the head of Weng Tianyao’s master, causing him to shriek. His soul was being forcibly read.

BOOM!

Suddenly, he exploded, transforming into a blood mist. Meanwhile, Long Chen’s expression had changed.

“Qingxuan, protect yourselves. They are carrying out a Nether River Sacrificial Ceremony. I’m going to stop them.”

“Nether River Sacrificial Ceremony?” Upon hearing this, the ever-calm Jiang Huixin’s expression completely changed.
