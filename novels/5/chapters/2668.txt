Chapter 2657 Copy of the Heavenly Daos

Feng Fei didn’t like Long Chen. But in the face of invaders from other worlds, her position was very clear. She wouldn’t place her dislike of him over her duty.

Just as she was about to go help Long Chen, he sent her such a message. Just what was he intending on doing? Save her energy to run for her life?

She didn’t understand, but she thought that Long Chen wouldn’t harm her, so it was most likely a warning out of good intentions. Thus, she chose to just watch like Long Aotian.

The core of the lightning tribulation had Long Chen fighting the Nine-Headed Lion, as well as Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen fighting the Alldevil Heavenwalker. Both those battles were relatively evenly matched.

Just like that, the terrifying lightning lifeforms didn’t even have a chance to approach them before being blasted apart.

“They really are terrifying. They can actually ignore those terrifying lifeforms.” The experts watching them fighting in the tribulation were all stunned. Every single one of those lifeforms was terrifying. Even if all these experts charged out, they knew they would be unable to handle these lifeforms.

However, they had become cannon fodder in front of Long Chen and the others, not posing any threat at all.

“They all came prepared. Some of them came with treasures that can block lightning, while the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the Nine-Headed Lion, and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord all have their respective world’s thunderforce within them. Thus, it is difficult for this lightning to harm them. As for Ye Ming, he’s the really strange one. Theoretically, he should be the one most suppressed by this lightning. But his body… Heavens! Look, he has black lightning runes on his body! What is that?” An elder was in the midst of analyzing things when he let out a startled cry.

Those black lightning runes were incredibly strange. They were visible yet also not visible. At this moment, other experts began to look more closely at Ye Ming and noticed that there really were some vague lightning runes.

Any sounds of shock were drowned out by the rumbling sounds throughout the heavens. Long Chen and the Nine-Headed Lion had soared into the sky to fight in front of the heavenly gate.

“Heavens, how are their auras still growing stronger?”

Even after fighting for so long, their auras didn’t decline. Instead, they only grew.

“I didn’t think that you were also capable of absorbing lightning. Alright, then once I kill you, I can take your lightning as well,” said the Nine-Headed Lion.

“It just so happens that my thought process is the same,” said Long Chen. This Nine-Headed Lion had a world’s heavenly tribulation power within him, and it was a priceless treasure for Lei Long.

Moreover, there were also the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s red lightning, Ye Ming’s black lightning, and the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s devil qi lightning. Those were all treasures for Lei Long.

After fighting against the Nine-Headed Lion for so long, Long Chen had absorbed quite a bit of his lightning. As for the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s lightning, it was too far, so Long Chen could only absorb a bit of it.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker hadn’t used his full power yet and was only passively attacking. Having a deeper understanding of this heavenly tribulation, he knew that the real terror was coming.

Suddenly, the heavenly gate closed and no more lifeforms appeared. As Long Chen and the others slaughtered the remaining lifeforms, they were quickly cut down until they were all destroyed. All that remained was a sea of lightning.

“The heavenly tribulation is finally over. That was really frightening.” The world returned to calm, and the silence was like a weight off of their ears.

Suddenly, light exploded out of the heavenly gate, enveloping everyone in the core region, including Yun Tian and the others.

“What? It’s not over yet?!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The light from the heavenly gate fell upon Long Chen and the others, and then streaks of light flew out of their bodies, returning to the heavenly gate.

“What’s going on?”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the heavenly gate opened once more. One figure after another fell from the sky.

“How is that possible?!”

Those figures were familiar faces. They were Long Chen, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the Nine-Headed Lion, the dragon woman, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, Yun Tian, Mo Nian, and the others. All those within the heavenly tribulation were coming out of the heavenly gate.

“The Heavenly Daos have copied them!”

“One, two, three, four… seven, eight, nine! Heavens, there are nine sets of them! This is a sure death tribulation!”

It was very rare for a heavenly tribulation to copy someone in the tribulation. However, such a thing had occurred throughout history. It was said only those that could threaten the Heavenly Daos would be copied so that they could kill themselves.

In those historical tribulations, only one copy would possibly be made. However, that copy would have limitless power and would simply exhaust the true body to death.

The power of the copy came from the Heavenly Daos, while the person undergoing tribulation had limited spiritual yuan. Furthermore, by that point in the tribulation, they would already be exhausted. People who encountered this kind of trial almost always died.

The copy possessed all the divine abilities of the original and was equivalent to another self in terms of combat power. However, this copy would never tire. Such a thing was enough to make a person feel despair.

To beat oneself would require making a sudden breakthrough in the middle of the battle or using some strange tactic to handle yourself.

All those who had faced such a tribulation were startling geniuses of history. Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue had experienced such tribulations and managed to defeat themselves. However, that battle had been extremely difficult.

At that time, they had only faced one copy. However, now there were nine, so they turned pale. This was an unbeatable battle.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the Nine-Headed Lion, Ye Ming, Long Aotian, and the others were also shaken by this change. Of everyone present, only Long Chen was indifferent. He had long since gotten used to his tribulations. He knew that his tribulation would never disappoint him.

Nine Long Chens attacked at once, and the other clones also attacked their originals. Right from the start, they unleashed their fiercest attacks, and all kinds of paragon arts raged.

In that instant, it became impossible for those outside to see anything. The area within the tribulation was in chaos. All laws broke down and spacetime shattered.

“Fuck!” Mo Nian saw nine of him condensing arrows on their bows. As the world shook, Mo Nian was shocked to find that he couldn’t move.
