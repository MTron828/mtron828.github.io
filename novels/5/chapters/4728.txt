Chapter 4717 Long Xihe

BANG!

In the wilderness, the elder of the Long clan smashed a boulder apart with a kick. He no longer had any of his amicable appearance as his face twisted with savagery, resembling that of an enraged beast.

“That goddamn bastard, he’s just as hateful as his damn father!” the elder cursed furiously. Seeing this scene, the young disciples beside him were so scared that they were shaking, not daring to speak.

“Just because I called myself an administrator, he really viewed me as a nobody?! Hateful!” The elder continued to curse, clenching his teeth so hard that it looked like he was going to bite someone.

This elder’s status was definitely not ordinary. However, to not let Long Chen feel like the Long clan cared too much about him, the elder hid his real status, greeting Long Chen with the position of an outer administrator.

Unexpectedly, before he had a chance to talk about his main agenda, Long Chen had kicked them out, enraging him.

“That Long Zhantian is already so arrogant, but his son is even worse!” shouted the elder, unleashing a punch that shattered a distant mountain. He could only vent his rage in this manner.

“Elder Xihe, what should we do now? Are we leaving just like this?” asked one of the female disciples. She waited to speak until he had vented a bit.

She only dared to speak now because she was a direct descendant of this elder. So, even in his enraged state, he wouldn’t vent his anger on her.

“Girl, is your brain made of tofu? We’re already here, and we’ve lost several lives crossing the sea of broken stars. Won’t we be cursed if we leave without accomplishing anything?” scolded the elder.

If someone else had asked this question, a torrent of abuse would have come their way. Prior to this, they had merely feigned their arrogance, pretending to ignore him. In reality, they were all intimidated by him.

“But what can we do? Challenge the High Firmament Academy to war? That Long Chen is quite ferocious.” Only the female disciple dared to speak. She visibly quivered, clearly terrified at the thought of fighting Long Chen.

When Long Chen killed Xiuyang, he seemed possessed by a wild god, terrifying all of them.

The elder then took a deep breath and did his best to calm down. After a bit, his expression improved slightly, and he replied, “That fellow Long Chen is dangerous, cunning, ruthless, and decisive—definitely not an easy target.”

“But he’s actually quite handsome when he’s not so vicious.” The female disciple seemed to recall Long Chen’s handsome face and smiled.

“Shut your mouth, you infatuated fool!” The elder instantly lost all the calm he had worked so hard to gather.

The female disciple instantly lowered her head like the others, looking at her feet without making a sound.

Elder Xihe took a few more deep breaths, but he still felt enraged.

“Fuck, I can’t calm down like this! We can’t make any decisions without more information. You fools, go dig up some information for me!”

“What information?” asked the female disciple blankly.

“You...!” Elder Xihe had the urge to slap her, but he was unwilling to slap his direct descendant because of this. He spat out, “You idiots, naturally I mean gather any information useful to us!”

“Like what? I don’t want to be cursed if I gather the wrong information...” she mumbled. The others cast grateful looks toward her.

“You really are pissing me off. How did I end up having such a foolish descendant? Go gather any information related to Long Chen, the High Firmament Academy, the major factions in this world, their potential, and their arrangements. Also, find out if there’s a family with the Long surname in this world. I want to know if the Long clan’s bloodline still exists here. If so, focus on them. They’ll be our future targets to sway to our side, understood?!” The elder’s voice rose until he was shouting and spraying spittle over all of them, but they didn’t dare to wipe it away.

“Scram!” roared the elder, and they hastily fled.

“Ah, fuck, I’m really pissed off!”

Once those disciples left, Elder Xihe seemed to lose all control and shattered the surrounding mountains like a madman.

“Long Chen, you little bastard, just you wait! I refuse to believe that you won’t return to the Long clan...”

...

“Achoo!”

Long Chen returned to the rear mountains of the academy. Just as he was going to start refining more pills, he sneezed intensely. “Hmph, those little rabbits from the Long clan are definitely cursing me behind my back.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Unbeknownst to Long Chen, it was the old rabbit that was cursing him, not the little ones. He had truly been tricked by Elder Xihe’s act, so he thought the old rabbit was nothing more than some random administrator.

Based on Long Chen’s guess, this was just a kind of probe from the Long clan. Of course, even if he knew this elder’s real status, he wouldn’t care.

“Boss!”

As Guo Ran came running over, Long Chen’s eyes brightened.

“Good, nine star Doyens really are different! This aura even gives me a sense of pressure!”

Long Chen rapped Guo Ran’s chest with his fist. Sensing the vast Blood Qi within Guo Ran, Long Chen was amazed.

“Hahaha, it’s all thanks to boss! My Doyen power was fully absorbed by the hidden dragon. Fortunately, I already discussed how to split the power with it. This time, it got sixty and I got forty. My offensive power will definitely not be inferior to anyone. Even if I have to fight against someone like Wu Hun now, I won’t be afraid!” declared Guo Ran excitedly.

“I should warn you, with the Three-Headed bloodline in him, his power can break all laws. No matter how strong your defense is, it’s still gonna be difficult to go against someone like him,” reminded Long Chen.

Last time, Guo Ran had taken a devastating blow against Wu Hun, almost dying at his hand. If he hadn’t been so confident in his defense, he wouldn’t have been injured so badly.

“Hehe, I’m confident. I’ve discussed it with the hidden dragon. With its help, I’m going to create a new battle armor and weapons. This will form a bridge between us, and it has promised that as long as it is absolutely safe, it is willing to give me all its power. That way, our powers will merge perfectly and be overseen by the battle armor,” said Guo Ran.

“Good idea!” praised Long Chen. Although Guo Ran was lacking in many areas, he was always coming up with crazy ideas in this aspect.

“Hehe, I’ve decided on the name of this battle armor. It shall be the Hidden Dragon Battle Armor! Boss, let me tell you, if this armor is completed, other than against you and Zifeng, I won’t be afraid of fighting anyone!” declared Guo Ran.

“Little fellow, did you run over here just to show off to me, or...?” asked Long Chen with a smirk.

“Of course not. There is a saying, even the best housewife cannot cook without ingredients...”

“Alright. I’ve got everything here.”

Before Guo Ran could finish speaking, Long Chen had tossed a worldstone to him. In truth, Long Chen had simply been too busy during this time, or he would have long since given it to Guo Ran.

“Thank you, boss!”

Guo Ran delightedly took the worldstone and ran off.

“Don’t just think about yourself! Make some good armor and weapons for our brothers as well!” shouted Long Chen.

“Don’t worry boss, leave it to me!”

Once Guo Ran left, Evilmoon fell from Long Chen’s back and floated into his hand, startling him.

“What is it?”
