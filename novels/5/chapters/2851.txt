Chapter 2840 Disciples of the Immortal Institute

“They are disciples from the Immortal Institute!” Li Cai tensed slightly, whispering urgently to Long Chen.

These disciples wore white robes like those of the God Institute, but the character on their chest was ‘Immortal’, not ‘God’.

In the High Firmament Academy, among the many institutes, it was the God Institute and the Immortal Institute that had the fiercest competition between them.

The God Institute cultivated divine abilities, while the Immortal Institute cultivated immortal arts. Their cultivation principles were extremely different.

Moreover, the God Institute and the Immortal Institute were the High Firmament Academy’s largest two institutes. They had the most disciples, so the unending friction between the two institutes led to the eternal conflict between the disciples from both sides. Oftentimes, there would be a fight sprung up between them.

“This is the Immortal Institute’s hunting area. Outsiders may not enter,” said the leader of this group, his gaze sweeping across Long Chen and the others. When he sensed how dense the mortal qi in Long Chen’s body was, his expression became clearly contemptuous.

“Instructor Long Chen, we should leave. If people are hunting here, we should find a different location,” whispered Li Cai.

The God Institute and the Immortal Institute were always at odds. It wasn’t worth it for them to fight. Furthermore, they were outnumbered.

Long Chen nodded. It seemed that the other side was preparing to face some powerful beasts. That was why they had even set up sentinels around to prevent the main team from being disturbed.

Long Chen was about to leave when the Immortal Institute’s disciple said, “One moment. Our senior apprentice-brothers and sisters are setting a trap up ahead. If you walk like this, you might disturb the beast. Take off your shoes and walk barefoot.”

“You!” Li Cai and the others were enraged. This was clearly an attempt to humiliate them.

“Sorry, I’ll ask you to cooperate,” said that disciple indifferently.

The rest of their disciples also looked down on Long Chen and the others. It was as if bullying the God Institute’s disciples was pleasurable to them.

“Instructor Long Chen…” Li Cai looked at Long Chen. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen waved his hand, indicating him not to speak. He then walked over to that disciple.

“Let me show you something.”

The Immortal Institute’s disciple looked at Long Chen and sneered, “You wish to show me proof that you are a lowly little Mortal-ranked instructor? Do you think I care? If you’re smart, you’ll leave now. Otherwise, we’ll toss you out.”

Long Chen nonchalantly extended a hand to him. The disciple glanced at it, only to find that Long Chen’s hand was empty. He then snorted.

“What is this supposed to be?”

“Do you know what this is?” asked Long Chen.

Pow!

Without waiting for a reply, Long Chen’s hand slapped across that disciple’s face. He was then sent flying far into the distance.

“Courting death!”

The other disciples of the Immortal Institute furiously charged at Long Chen. Li Cai and the others were also implicated.

“Kill them,” ordered Long Chen.

“What? We can’t!” Li Cai and the others were stunned to hear such a thing. Although the God Institute and the Immortal Institute were at odds, the academy forbade disciples from killing each other.

“Did I ask for a discussion? Kill them! I will handle the consequences!” shouted Long Chen.

Following that, a scream rang out. One of the Immortal Institute’s disciples’ legs was broken by a kick from Long Chen.

“Fuck it!” Li Cai saw the situation and roared. His sword came out, and he started ferociously attacking the Immortal Institute’s disciples. As soon as he did this, the other disciples of the Elite Group attacked as well.

The Immortal Institute’s disciples were originally just planning on using their fists, but then Li Cai and the others took out their weapons. This was no longer just scaring each other but truly killing each other. Hence, they hastily took out their weapons. But being caught off guard, quite a few of them ended up injured in the first exchange, and they were forced back wretchedly.

As for Long Chen’s side, with every punch, he knocked out one of them. Anyone who reached him had their bones broken.

These people were unable to bear a single blow from Long Chen. Seeing how vicious he was, their group of three hundred fled in terror.

Just at this moment, an angry roar shook the land.

“This bastard! Quick, kill him together!” Furious cursing rang out in the distance. That voice seemed to be that of a woman, and it sounded anxious.

Following her voice, rays of light flew out, and then they saw a giant explosion in the distance.

“You bastards disturbed the Lightning Lizard Beast, ruining all our preparations! Senior apprentice-sister won’t let you off!” The disciple that Long Chen had sent flying with a slap came crawling back, his body covered in mud.

BOOM!

Just at that moment, a giant lizard came flying over. Any trees in its path were flattened.

“A Divine Flame realm Lightning Lizard Beast! Instructor Long Chen, run!” Li Cai and the others cried out.

The Lightning Lizard Beast had a lot of disciples of the Immortal Institute chasing it. They numbered over a thousand.

This was a large hunting party of the Immortal Institute, and their target was this powerful Lightning Lizard Beast. They had stealthily approached it in order to sneak attack it and got off to a good start. However, the disturbance on Long Chen’s side had drawn its attention. Although these disciples tried to stop it, they were not fully prepared yet, so it charged through their blockade and fled.

The Lightning Lizard Beast was coincidentally rushing straight toward Long Chen. Perhaps it was because everyone else was wearing white and only he was wearing black, making him too conspicuous. It instantly reached him.

“Instructor Long Chen!”

Long Chen slowly rolled up his sleeves in the face of this lizard that was a dozen times larger than him. He then suddenly jumped up, unleashing a punch at its head. Lightning appeared on top of his fist. That was Lei Linger’s power. Although she was still in slumber, Long Chen could still use this power.

BOOM!

Li Cai and the others’ jaws dropped. They stared in shock as Long Chen’s lightning fist smashed the Lightning Lizard Beast into the ground.

As a result, a giant hole appeared in the ground. The Lightning Lizard Beast’s body continued to twitch for a while at the bottom before it stopped and its aura vanished.

Everyone present, whether it was the Elite Group or the Immortal Institute’s disciples, was completely dumbfounded.

The Immortal Institute’s disciples in particular could not believe their eyes. A novice whose mortal qi was so dense had actually killed this terrifying Lightning Lizard Beast in one punch.

Long Chen clasped his hands behind him and stood in front of the Lightning Lizard Beast. Staring at those shocked disciples, he indifferently said, “This Lightning Lizard Beast was killed by me. Are you planning on demanding a part of the spoils?”
