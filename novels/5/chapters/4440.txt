Chapter 4429 Descending Upon Heavenly Fiend Prefecture

“Race leader Ye Ling, Little Crane, why are you here?” Long Chen was surprised to see Ye Ling walking over while holding Little Crane’s hand.

Moreover, several other beautiful maidens were with them. They wore white robes, and rainbow light surrounded them. Their eyes were like clear springs capable of cleansing the soul.

“Big Brother Long Chen, these are my three aunts!” Little Crane ran over and excitedly introduced them to Long Chen.

In an instant, Long Chen found himself in an awkward position. These maidens looked like sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls. Seeing no other way around it, Long Chen could only thicken his face and say, “Greetings, aunts.”

If Little Crane called him big brother, then he couldn’t call them big sisters. That would throw the seniority into chaos.

He knew that these maidens only looked young, but they had lived for countless years, so calling them aunts wasn’t something weird. Still, Long Chen couldn’t help but feel embarrassed to do so.

These three beautiful maidens seemed very shy. After returning Long Chen’s greeting, they were all blushing and didn’t even dare to look at him.

“Big Brother Long Chen, are you going to beat up bad people? I want to go and cheer for you!” Little Crane looked at Long Chen excitedly. It seemed that she was getting a bit violent now. “I even dragged over my three aunts to help me cheer for you!”

Long Chen was speechless, but he couldn’t refuse her and just nodded. He then turned to Ye Ling and asked, “Race leader Ye Ling, how is Ye Xue?”

“She’s doing well, very well! However, she is at a critical juncture at the moment and can’t come to cheer for you. Please don’t feel offended by it,” answered Ye Ling.

“Hehe, race leader, what are you talking about? This is just a little scuffle. I don’t need a big cheer squad,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“You can’t put it that way. Your enmity with the nether dragon race stemmed from my Earth Spirit race. My Earth Spirit race must stand up for you no matter what,” remarked Ye Ling.

Long Chen realized that Ye Ling was here to intimidate her enemies. After all, there would definitely be people from the Esoteric Spirit World among the spectators, and she could show them her connection with the High Firmament Academy.

If Ye Ling didn’t do this, they would get even more arrogant, so even though Ye Xue was at a critical juncture, Ye Ling still wished to come with Long Chen.

“Well, let’s go!” said Long Chen.

“Are they not sending you off?” Looking around, Ye Ling saw that other than the Dragonblood Legion, no one else had come to send them off. She couldn’t help finding it curious.

“Why bother? It’s nothing big. I don’t need to disturb them for such a thing,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen knew why nobody came to see him off. Right now, his actions represented only himself and had nothing to do with the High Firmament Academy.

This way, Long Chen didn’t need to restrict himself based on the academy’s values and could do whatever he wanted. This act was like covering your own ears while stealing a bell, but sometimes, this was the best way to deal with shameless people.

As they stepped on a transportation formation, it activated and teleported them away. Once they were gone, multiple figures appeared around the formation.

Amongst them were Dean Bai Letian and the palace master. Behind them were the higher-ups of the academy.

The palace master couldn’t help but ask, “Are we really not going?”

Bai Letian simply smiled. “Sometimes, we need to learn to let go. Since we’ve left things to Long Chen, let him do as he pleases. Now isn’t the time to expose the academy’s power. We’ll wait until Long Chen can’t handle everything himself and fix the chaos left in his wake.”

After over ten transportations, Guo Ran summoned a flying boat, and they all flew off toward the Heavenly Fiend Prefecture.

They had to use the transportation formations of the large prefectures to get where they were, and every time, they would see countless experts around the formations. Apparently, the crowd had long since surrounded the transportation formations just to see Long Chen for a moment.

They were mostly weak cultivators who didn’t have the ability to go to the Heavenly Fiend Prefecture, so they could only hope for Long Chen to pass by here.

Every time Long Chen appeared, heaven-shaking cheers would erupt. Although Long Chen and his companions would only stop in one place for a while, the mere sight of him was enough to satisfy the cheering experts.

After all, Long Chen’s battle with Netherdragon Tianzhao was extremely significant. It was the ultimate showdown between the human race’s Sage King and the nether dragon race’s Heavenly Doyen. This battle would go down in history as one of the most influential battles of the new era.

Once Long Chen and the others stepped onto the flying boat, Little Crane was still as excited as ever, looking at Long Chen worshipfully. Seeing so many people cheer for Long Chen and shout his name as they passed by made her feel an unprecedented excitement.

“Big Brother Long Chen, you’re the greatest hero of the human race now! You’re amazing!”

Little Crane watched the city fade into the distance, but she felt like the cheers had yet to fade.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“The human race definitely needs a hero. However, I am not fit for it,” sighed Long Chen.

“Why not? I feel like Big Brother Long Chen is a grand hero!” Hearing this, Little Crane turned to him in confusion.

“Because being a hero is too tiring. Your big brother prefers to be free and do whatever he wants,” explained Yu Qingxuan.

Yu Qingxuan looked at Little Crane pamperingly and smiled. However, it wasn’t just her. Everyone’s attention was on her.

Every single one of her movements attracted their hearts. This little girl made them naturally feel close to her, giving them the urge to protect her.

“Big Sister Qingxuan, why can’t a hero be free to do whatever they please?” asked Little Crane as she ran over to Yu Qingxuan’s side and stared at her.

Yu Qingxuan directly picked her up and looked into her large eyes. She smiled. “You’ll understand once you grow up. However, big sister hopes that you’ll never understand them.”

“Why not?”

“Because your big brother likes you best when you don’t understand those things.”

“Oh! Hehe, then I won’t understand those things! I want my big brother to like me forever! Once I’m as big as my aunts, I’ll marry Big Brother Long Chen!” Little Crane giggled.

Everyone laughed while Long Chen was embarrassed. This girl really was so innocent that she could even say such a thing.

“Little Crane, how old are your aunts?” asked Guo Ran.

“I don’t know. But from their birth until now, they’ve seen eleven generations of your academy’s deans!” Little Crane counted with her fingers.

Everyone gasped. The rainbow crane race’s longevity was truly shocking. If they had to wait until Little Crane grew up, they would have likely vanished from this world.

“We’ve arrived at the Heavenly Fiend Prefecture.”

Suddenly, the flying boat quivered and started to slow down. At the same time, everyone’s blood began to heat up in anticipation.
