Chapter 4103 The Last Generation Leader’s Death

“My Fullmoon race has always kept its word! My decision is made, so don’t make a racket!” ordered the race leader sternly.

Countless members of the Fullmoon race were shocked by his declaration, but they were also powerless to resist, so they could only shut their mouths.

“Changchuan, bring your guests away to rest. We will discuss the concrete arrangements and process later,” ordered the race leader.

“Yes.” Xu Changchuan hastily rose and brought Long Chen and the others away.

Once they left the plaza, Xu Changchuan gratefully thanked Long Chen. “Many thanks for risking your life to save me, brother Long.”

Xu Changchuan was extremely moved that Long Chen would try to stop the race leader from killing him. Aware that his relationship with Long Chen was only so-so, Xu Changchuan knew that Long Chen only helped him due to his promise, which made their relationship look more like a transaction than one backed by a tie of friendship.

Even so, in that situation, Long Chen still dared to save him from the race leader, showing that he would risk death for Xu Changchuan.

“That was nothing more than a test from the race leader,” said Long Chen with a smile.

However, Xu Changchuan shook his head. “With the race leader’s power and wisdom, he definitely didn’t give you any time to think when he attacked. Even though it was just a test, you had no time to think about that. For you to have still saved me was entirely due to your own heart and instinct. Brother Long, you are a true friend.”

Xu Changchuan was solemn. It seemed that in so many years, only Long Chen alone had been willing to take such a huge risk to save him.

Long Chen nodded. Xu Changchuan normally seemed arrogant and childish like a spoiled child, but he did have some integrity. Inside, he was still a hot-blooded man.

Once Long Chen and the others had walked away, a Heaven Venerate of the Fullmoon race couldn’t help but argue, “Leader, you must reconsider this matter! The human race’s sinister schemes are endless!”

“That’s true. In terms of power, we’re not afraid of them. But in terms of scheming, we’re not a match for them.”

“If Lord Brahma really was willing to sacrifice some of his pieces as a scheme, then we’d have fallen for it completely if we let them in! Who knows if Long Chen only killed some clone or avatar of Liao Bencang and Enpuda?”

The other Heaven Venerates began to speak up as well. After all, the Fullmoon race never collaborated with the human race. Although they weren’t afraid of the human race in terms of martial power, they did fear the human race’s sinister schemes.

“Seventh Uncle, do you remember how I became the race leader?” The race leader looked at an ancient elder.

This elder was startled by this sudden question. Sinking into his memories, he murmured, “I remember that your martial talent was outstanding, but you were too stubborn and never listened to anyone’s advice. Many of your thoughts were also against the established standard of the Fullmoon race of that time. I remember that the previous leader disliked you, thinking that you would cause the Fullmoon race to decline if you were to succeed him. Later on, the ancestral spirit totem manifested on your body, making you the leader.”

This matter could be considered a secret in the Fullmoon race, and only some senior experts were aware of this matter. However, they had never mentioned it, so no one in the junior generation was aware of this.

Now that everyone heard this, the experts who were unaware of this were completely shocked. Was this not saying that the position of leader was not decided by the test and trials? Were they chosen by the ancestral spirit totem?

“However, ever since you took over the Fullmoon race, the Fullmoon race has truly declined a great deal. In overall power, we cannot compare to the last generation,” said the seventh uncle with a bitter smile.

The others were startled. Was this not a slap in the leader’s face? It was fine as long as he kept this thought to himself, so why did he have to say it out loud?

Fortunately, the race leader simply smiled and said, “Seventh uncle, are you doubting my leadership abilities? Why have we declined? After I took over the leadership position, we underwent three dark battles. Also, not counting this time, we’ve staved off seven attempts of Lord Brahma infiltrating our ranks. We’ve fought dozens of large and small battles, but I always act firm, not giving Lord Brahma any face, resulting in the Sacred Pill Hall completely locking down our supply of medicinal pills. Naturally, our power can only decline.”

The seventh uncle coldly said, “Had you continued the previous leader’s softer strategy, we wouldn’t be fighting Lord Brahma to death. The previous leader also wouldn’t have died on the battlefield.”

The seventh uncle’s tone was not polite at all. When the other experts heard this, their expressions changed abruptly. So the last generation had not appeared because they were dead? That was a heavy blow to them.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What nonsense! You don’t know anything!” The race leader finally lost his patience and roared, “What do you know?! What softer strategy?! That was bending the knee and fawning, begging for mercy at death’s door! When did our Fullmoon race need to rely on other people’s mercy?! Did you think that the last dark battle caused seventy-six Heaven Venerate Elders to die on the battlefield?! They died to the ancestral spirit totem!”

“What?!”

This time, everyone felt like they were struck by a bolt of lightning, including the seventh uncle.

“Those seventy-six Heaven Venerate Elders were all bought by Lord Brahma! They tried to carry out a rebellion in that dark battle, so they were executed by the ancestral spirit totem. Because it was on a dark battlefield, Lord Brahma’s holy form was unable to protect them. It was due to this that the previous leader was filled with guilt and could not endure it. To protect our race, he fought against two of Lord Brahma’s Divine Commanders. Even when he was severely injured, he didn’t retreat. As a result, he died on the battlefield, while one of the Divine Commanders was almost crippled. All you saw was that I was unable to save him. What you didn’t know was that while I could save him once, how could I save him from himself for a lifetime? I could only respect his decision, but I’ve had to carry the blame for so many years. Do you think that I’m happy about it?”

Toward the end, the race leader was practically cursing. He had clearly been suppressing this for a long time.

He continued, “I respect the last generation’s strength and character, but I will not be so polite as to lie about his plan. His strategy was trash. Once I took command of the race, I put on an unyielding attitude to the inside and the outside. Although our current power is weaker, the message that I have given to Lord Brahma is that my Fullmoon race would rather shatter as jade than live as a clay tile. Even so, Lord Brahma’s infiltration sneaks its way through every hole, and people are still brainwashed by him. If I was like the previous generation, then there would no longer be a Fullmoon race. We’d have long since become only one of Lord Brahma’s subordinate powers. Without blood and spine, we will no longer be the Fullmoon race. Do you wish to live disgracefully or die with pride? You choose for yourselves.”

Upon hearing this, the seventh uncle directly knelt on the ground. “I am to blame for misunderstanding and misjudging you. This disrespect to the leader of our race cannot be forgiven, but I won’t make you dirty your hands.”

Suddenly, he stabbed his own finger toward his forehead, causing countless startled cries to ring out.
