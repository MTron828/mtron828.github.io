Chapter 5052 Someone to Ring the Bell


Bai Yingxuan continued to tell Long Chen the story about how the Brahma Pill Valley’s recent actions had crossed the dragon race’s bottom line. 

It was similar to the betrayal of the Netherdragon race, who joined the Netherworld’s Emperor. That had caused huge waves in the dragon race, with many factions hunting down the Netherdragon race.

While conflicts among dragon races were not uncommon, they all shared a fundamental belief: the god of their faith was the Primal Chaos Dragon Sovereign. This entity held supreme authority within the dragon race, untouchable by any external force.

If the Netherdragon race’s betrayal had been a sudden shock, the Brahma Pill Valley’s infiltration was like slowly boiling a frog in a pot—a subtle and insidious scheme unfolding over time.

With their medicinal pills, the Brahma Pill Valley slowly enticed some dragon races into betraying their own kind. The dragon race would then split and ultimately fall under their banner.

To use Bai Yingxuan’s words, those pills were poison pills. Although they could increase the cultivation speed of the dragon race, they also eroded the dragon race’s willpower and soul. If the dragons were willing to compromise their integrity for power, could they still be considered true dragons?

Countless dragon experts understood this point and knew that their collaboration with the Brahma Pill Valley would one day lead to calamity. However, as more and more dragons followed suit, their sense of guilt faded. Whether it was through bait or force, this trend swiftly gained momentum.

Those who refrained from using the pills risked falling behind, while those who embraced the pills would essentially be under Pill Valley’s control. While their relationship with Pill Valley was good, they could buy medicinal pills. However, what if Pill Valley raised the price of the medicinal pills one day? With their heavy reliance on these pills, Pill Valley could gradually drain them of all their wealth.

In this case, they would have to comply with whatever Pill Valley asked them to do. If they didn’t, their supply of medicinal pills would be cut off.

“It seems Pill Valley is making a big play. They’re using medicinal pills to control the entire world,” said Long Chen.

Pill Valley’s power definitely wasn’t what it appeared to be on the surface. The factions that relied on their supply of medicinal pills would likely become their fighters in the future.

“That is correct. Pill Valley hopes that their medicinal pills will allow them to control everything. I don’t care about the other races, but the dragon race has always held its fate in its own hands. In the past, the Brahma Pill Valley has invited the white dragon race to their gatherings many times, but we have always refused. Then they started setting other dragon races against us, making many small movements behind our backs. Although it hasn’t caused much damage to the white dragon race, it is extremely enraging. This time, I lead half the white dragon race’s disciples to the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain. Now that we are here, none of us plan on leaving alive. That includes our Ten Thousand Dragon Nest,” said Bai Yingxuan.

Long Chen jumped in shock. Just what was the white dragon race thinking? Were they planning to fight to the death to defend their honor? 

Bai Yingxuan sighed, “Dean Long Chen. While the white dragon race doesn’t have grand aspirations of becoming the saviors of the world, we have the duty to warn the rest of the dragon race.”

“Senior, has the situation really become this grave?” asked Long Chen.

“It might be even graver than you think. You don’t know the Brahma Pill Valley’s origins, the immemorial secrets, and the karma behind things. While I know these things, it’s only because they are part of my bloodline and soul. I cannot speak of it, or it would bring a calamity upon the white dragon race and you. I tell you this so you know we are worthy of your trust. You can rely on us without worrying about implicating us,” replied Bai Yingxuan.

Long Chen’s heart shook. This world was truly hiding many secrets, and what he had touched upon so far was nothing more than the tip of the iceberg. Furthermore, some of those secrets were so significant that, let alone Bai Yingxuan, even the Earth Cauldron refused to reveal many things to him.

“If that’s the case, then let us join forces against our common enemy. In any case, now that I’ve come here, I’m definitely going to go big. This is for Big Brother Wujiang,” said Long Chen as he clenched his fists.

When Xing Wujiang’s face appeared in Long Chen’s mind, his rage toward Pill Valley seethed. Just as Bai Yingxuan said, wherever Long Chen went, Pill Valley’s shadow was present, haunting him.

It seemed that all the nine heavens and ten lands were either following the Brahma Pill Valley or being targeted by them. They were truly hateful.

If they wanted to enrage him, he’d return the favor. They wanted to play? He’d match them. As he put it, the goal wasn’t just to play—it was to play them to death.

“You should keep this scale. It will cover up your original aura, and whenever you use the dragon race’s divine abilities, the figure of a white dragon will automatically manifest, preventing others from recognizing your status,” remarked Bai Yingxuan as he handed Long Chen a jade plate made from a dragon scale. A deep divine light radiated from it, making it clear that it was a treasure.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Many thanks, senior.” Long Chen accepted it with respect. As he hung it at his waist, he sensed his aura being enveloped by a sacred light.

Extending his hand, Long Chen summoned his dragon scales. They were now covered by a white layer that masked their blood-red hue. Delighted, he realized he could summon the Dragon Blood Battle Armor without worrying about others recognizing him.

When Long Chen’s dragon scales manifested, the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest quivered slightly. Bai Yingxue jumped at the sudden movement, but when she glanced at Bai Yingxuan, she noticed a spark of excitement in the latter’s eyes.

“What pure Sovereign blood power! Just a single ripple is enough to resonate with the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest,” remarked Bai Yingxuan.

Long Chen hadn’t expected to cause such a phenomenon the moment he used his dragon blood. Embarrassed, he was about to speak when the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest shook with greater intensity. But this time, Bai Yingxuan’s expression darkened, and killing intent surged out of her.

Long Chen quickly looked outside and saw another giant Ten Thousand Dragon Nest flying alongside the white dragon race’s nest. Seeing that nest, he couldn’t help but remark, “Enemies indeed often run into each other.”
