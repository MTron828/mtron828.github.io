Chapter 2366 Bezoar Blood Ignition Pill

Translator: BornToBe

Shen Chengfeng and Long Chen hastily rushed over, and countless large figures quickly appeared within their vision. They were fighting the Heavenly Dragon Legion.

What surprised Long Chen was that while these beasts didn’t look different from Magical Beasts, their auras were completely different. They instead seemed a bit similar to the sea demon race.

Those beasts were gigantic and seemed to be pressing down on the Heavenly Dragon Legion.

Giant arrow towers were set up in a defensive line, unleashing huge arrows. A streak of light sliced through the demonic beasts, blasting apart those struck.

Suddenly, one of the demonic beasts avoided the layers of blockades to reach one of the arrow towers. Its sharp claw then slammed into the tower, almost bending it in half. Over ten of the crossbows were destroyed in one blow.

That demonic beast didn’t have time to unleash another attack before a dozen rays of sword-light slew it.

However, the destruction of that tower had created an opening within the defenses. The demonic beasts seemed to have sensed it and rushed that opening.

“Seven of the eighteen arrow towers have been destroyed! If this continues, the second defensive line will be broken as well. Long Chen, we have to stop them!” Shen Chengfeng was already charging into the battlefield. “Brothers, stand steady! Reduce the defensive line and protect the arrow towers!”

With a single blow of his sword, Shen Chengfeng killed one of the powerful demonic beasts. The Heavenly Dragon warriors finally had a chance to breathe.

A figure charged through the battlefield, with black saber-light flashing. With every flash of light, one of the sea demons fell.

“That’s…

“Long Chen!”

The Heavenly Dragon warriors were unable to believe their eyes. How was Long Chen here?

Lightning flickered beneath Long Chen’s feet as he passed through the battlefield, targeting the regions where the warriors seemed to be in the most danger.

Every time Evilmoon flashed through the air, more demonic beasts fell. Either they exploded in a burst of blood, or they were badly mutilated.

“Long Chen has also come? Haha, now we’re really fine.” The Heavenly Dragon warriors laughed delightedly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen and Shen Chengfeng didn’t cause an instant reversal of the battlefield. Instead, they supported everyone’s defenses, protecting the arrow towers.

Those arrow towers were treasures of the divine families, and they required a huge amount of manpower to build. They were the true killing weapons of the battlefield.

However, their repair cost would have to come out of the pocket of the legion guarding them. Hence, the Heavenly Dragon Legion did their best to slay demonic beasts to accumulate merit points, and if they had to spend those few points on fixing the arrow towers, they would have to go hungry.

With all the warriors protecting the arrow towers, a quick defensive formation quickly stabilized.

“Xie Feng, what happened here?” Only now did Shen Chengfeng have a chance to call out toward a dark-faced man.

Xie Feng was the vice commander of the eighth legion. He hatefully said, “We were facing our enemies with no problem when suddenly a new batch came from the side, completely messing up our tempo. We didn’t have time to set up any defenses. It was definitely the third legion. The sudden group of enemies came from their direction.”

“Those bastards!” Shen Chengfeng gnashed his teeth. The third legion had conned them here, wanting to make them lose even this second defensive line.

“We can talk about that later. Let’s stabilize our defenses first. We can’t allow any further arrow towers to be damaged, or we’ll have to go hungry this month. Ordinary warriors, focus on defense. Squad leaders, come with me. We’ll slaughter as many of these demonic beasts as possible to make up for our losses,” ordered Shen Chengfeng.

As long as they killed enough demonic beasts and took their Neidans, they could exchange them for the merit points required to fix the arrow towers.

“Brother Long, do you have any ideas?” Shen Chengfeng didn’t forget to look for Long Chen’s opinion.

Long Chen shook his head. “In this kind of chaotic battle, there’s no need for such a thing. Just kill them!”

Long Chen didn’t know much about demonic beasts, so he wanted to observe more. These demonic beasts weren’t that powerful. Even the strongest was only on the level of a second step Netherpassage expert.

The most threatening thing about them was their numbers and their tough physical bodies. As for divine abilities or magical arts? They weren’t powerful in that regard.

“Oh? Those powerful fellows in the distance, why didn’t they come over?” asked Long Chen suddenly while he was in the midst of killing the demonic beasts. He sensed several powerful auras just watching from the other side.

“They’re afraid of our arrow towers. Those stronger demonic beasts would naturally be targeted first. If one of the towers concentrates hundreds of god breaking arrows on one of them, then even a peak twelfth rank demonic beast would be killed. Those arrow towers are our greatest protection. As long as we have them, they don’t dare to come close,” answered Shen Chengfeng.

“Alright. Then I’ll go take a look.” Long Chen suddenly charged through the battlefield in the direction of those powerful auras.

“Long Chen! That’s too dangerous!” shouted Shen Chengfeng. That place was the land of the demonic beasts. But Long Chen was too fast, and he couldn’t stop him. Shen Chengfeng immediately gave the order to point the arrow towers in that direction. Once Long Chen retreated to their range, they could assist him.

Shen Chengfeng had a strange feeling of expectation. Having advanced to the Netherpassage realm, Long Chen should be able to retreat alive even in the face of a demon king.

Long Chen passed through countless demonic beasts. He didn’t bother getting tangled up with them.

“Shen Chengfeng said that the arrow towers have an effective range of eight thousand miles. Past that range, their power weakens.” Long Chen began calculating things as he passed through the demonic beasts.

The range of those arrow towers was half as far as Guo Ran’s crossbow attacks. However, they were focused on killing power in exchange for some range. There were some qualitative differences between the two.

Outside the range of the arrow towers, Long Chen saw thousands of powerful demonic beasts with auras so terrifying that even he didn’t dare to get close.

Based on their auras, they were all peak twelfth rank existences. Although their bloodlines weren’t pure, their combat power was definitely above ordinary fourth step Netherpassage experts.

Although Long Chen no longer cared about ordinary fourth step Netherpassage experts, these thousands of demonic beasts were so powerful that if he went over, he would be throwing his life away.

These demonic beasts seemed to be from the same species. They had a pair of giant wings each and the heads of a bull. However, their arms were that of a human’s and they were holding giant bone spears. Their eyeballs were bigger than a room.

Even existences as powerful as them didn’t dare to enter the effective range of the arrow towers. They were waiting for the arrows to be destroyed before attacking.

However, since Long Chen and Shen Chengfeng had returned, that plan had been ruined. The demonic beasts that had charged in were no longer able to break the Heavenly Dragon Legion’s defenses and destroy those arrow towers.

“Commander Shen, what are these bull-headed monsters called?” shouted Long Chen.

Shen Chengfeng shouted back, “They’re from the demon race, the-”

“Ignorant brat, you don’t even know about our mighty Titan Blood Bull race?” Suddenly, one of those bull-headed monsters opened its mouth.

“Oh? You can speak?” Long Chen stared in surprise.

“Hmph, inferior human race, you’re making too big of a fuss about nothing,” sneered another one of them, an expression of disdain appearing on its bull face.

“Damn, how demonic. So even a bull can grow a brain.” Long Chen was amazed.

“Wait, I’ve got an idea.” Long Chen suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He shouted, “Hahaha I remember now, doesn’t your Titan Blood Bull race produce bezoars?”

The bezoar of the Titan Blood Bull race was one of the main ingredients in certain twelfth tier medicinal pills. Long Chen instantly thought of the Bezoar Blood Ignition Pill. That was one of the best pills for purifying essence blood.

The Dragonblood warriors were in the midst of absorbing the immemorial essence blood to stimulate their Spirit Blood. That on its own was great, but even then, the immemorial essence blood came from the Blood race’s essence blood. Even once it was purified and ninety-nine percent of the impurities were extracted, there would still be the slightest bit left over with no way to remove it normally. Although everyone knew it would have an effect in the future, the benefits outweighed that.

However, the Bezoar Blood Ignition Pill could resolve the problem. It could cause the blood to ignite and automatically remove impurities. That was what he needed most at this time.

“Yes, every part of the Titan Blood Bull race is a treasure. Their demonic Neidan, horns, blood, pizzle, balls, they’re all priceless treasures. Actually, that bezoar you mentioned is their balls,” shouted Shen Chengfeng.

The pizzle and balls were particularly valuable parts of the Titan Blood Bull race. They were treasures that powerful cultivators wished to obtain, but money couldn’t buy them.

“It’s their balls? Don’t try to scam me just because I don’t read many books.” Long Chen wanted to believe Shen Chengfeng, but he had never heard this before.

“Bastard human race, you’re courting death!” The demonic beasts roared furiously. It seemed that mentioning how valuable their body parts were was taboo to them.

“Haha, so the bezoar is located there. Well then, old bulls, listen well. I’m going to beat your balls out.” Long Chen’s divine ring suddenly appeared. As the Heavenly Dragon warriors cried out in shock, he shot toward those Titan Blood Bull demons.
