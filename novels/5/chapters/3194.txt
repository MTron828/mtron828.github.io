Chapter 3183 Heavenly Swell Domain? Dao Dawn Domain?

Long Chen nodded.

“I sensed it. Outside of the heavenly tribulation was some sinister power. When Bai Shishi was injured, it secretly stole a bit of her essence blood.”

Long Chen hadn’t sensed anything odd during her tribulation until she grabbed that peak rank rune. The instant she was injured, that sinister energy appeared.

When she bled, a bit of it was silently stolen. Only then did Long Chen notice just how serious this matter was.

Bai Shishi’s mother said, “The auspicious qi of Crane Cry Valley repels that fiendish energy. Hence, it was only able to steal a trace of her essence blood when she was injured. It won’t affect Shishi, but if it hadn’t been for the auspicious qi, even if Shishi wasn’t injured, the fiendish energy would have slipped away with quite a bit of her essence blood. The most curious part is that the actual person can’t sense it. Our High Firmament Academy has Crane Cry Valley, but other sects don’t have such an auspicious land. They can only rely on formations to prevent too much blood from leaking away. In the Heavenly Swell Domain, it’s alright for the Four Peak realm, but if they try to advance to the Divine Lord realm, their primal bloodline will instantly be snatched away. After advancing, they will no longer be Primals. Some people call this phenomenon the devil’s curse. Most Primals will leave the Heavenly Swell Domain after reaching the Four Peak realm. That’s why it’s so rare for Primal Divine Lords to appear here in the Heavenly Swell Domain.”

“Senior, junior has a question. When I killed the city lord of Silver Moon City, I saw a part of his memories. Why do you call the Heavenly Swell Domain the Dao Dawn Domain?” asked Long Chen. He had read many books but hadn’t found anything about this.

Bai Shishi’s mother smiled slightly. “That relates to some secrets. This place is called the Heavenly Swell Domain, as well as the Dao Dawn Domain. Both names are correct. However, only a portion of people call it the Heavenly Swell Domain. Most people still call it the Dao Dawn Domain. The reason there are two names is because there was once an expert called Zhao Tianlan[1]. A long time ago, the Dao Dawn Domain’s devil sea suddenly erupted. Countless devils came out of its depths, and they wished to slaughter all the other lifeforms within the Dao Dawn Domain. This expert called Zhao Tianlan led an army against those devils and then used his own life to summon a barrier to seal the devil eye staring at the Dao Dawn Domain. As he had sacrificed himself to protect the Dao Dawn Domain, to remember him, the Dao Dawn Domain’s people changed the name of the Dao Dawn Domain to the Heavenly Swell Domain. Regretfully, people always forget with time. Once the scar heals, the pain is forgotten. Many people have stopped calling it the Heavenly Swell Domain and once more call it the Dao Dawn Domain. However, while others can do that, we can’t, because that Zhao Tianlan was our High Firmament Academy’s seventeenth dean.”

Hearing that, Long Chen understood. So the High Firmament Academy’s dean had sacrificed himself to protect the Dao Dawn Domain.

The High Firmament Academy was an extremely glorious existence. It was the oldest academy in the immortal world. However, now that it had declined, its former radiance was gone, and all kinds of evil monsters were crawling their way up its head.

Calling it the Dao Dawn Domain again was not as simple as changing its name. It was erasing the High Firmament Academy’s illustrious history and what they had done for the people.

“Is it related to Lord Brahma?” asked Long Chen.

Bai Shishi’s mother laughed. “Child, you’re a bit frightening when you’re smart.”

Clearly, he had guessed correctly. This was a scheme. Originally, the High Firmament Academy’s position within the Heavenly Swell Domain was untouchable, but as Lord Brahma’s forces grew, this oldest academy of the immortal world refused to bend to his will. Despite declining, it still stood tall against him.

“The desolate devils, the devil sea, and the devil curse, are they all related to Lord Brahma?” asked Long Chen.

“Even I cannot tell you that. I’ve only told you this much so you are mentally prepared. The immortal world has many secrets and many unknown forces. Don’t get deceived by a temporary victory. You’re smart, but it seems that you sometimes wish to have all the weaknesses of a hot-blooded youth. So I should still warn you even though it probably won’t be useful. Even if it offends you, I still have to do it,” said Bai Shishi’s mother.

Long Chen instantly felt a burning sensation on his face. It seemed that women always held grudges no matter how high their cultivation base or status was.

“Senior…”

“Haha, it’s just a joke. Don’t you also like to joke with my daughter? That’s all I’ll say for today. Seeing your divine flame power, it will probably take some time to settle. When you prepare for the Four Peak tribulation, the academy’s seniors will come to protect you,” said Bai Shishi’s mother. She then left, leaving behind a dumbfounded Long Chen.

He felt like the immortal world was far more mysterious than before. Everything he had seen so far was nothing more than the tip of the iceberg. However, for the academy to support him so much, he felt at ease. He then returned to his residence.

There, he found Qin Feng waiting for him. “Boss, Li Cai came and asked if he could join the Dragonblood Legion. He said that he would accept any conditions you wish. He simply wishes to get stronger. Even if he dies, he won’t regret it.”

Qin Feng had seen Li Cai’s worshipful gaze and found the latter to be not bad. If he was properly raised, it would be acceptable for him to join the Dragonblood Legion.

Long Chen shook his head. “It isn’t a matter of talent. I can turn him into a Primal, but the main thing is his will. He is lacking far too much in this regard compared to the rest of you that have experienced hundreds of battles. If he wants to become a Dragonblood warrior, he must go through the same kind of tempering. But we don’t have the time to help him. We have enough trouble looking after ourselves.”

“I said the same thing. But then he said that he would enter the Field of Bitter Reincarnation to temper his will.”

“The Field of Bitter Reincarnation?”

Long Chen was shocked. That was the highest level of punishment in the academy, but it was also capable of tempering a person’s will. Upon entering that place, a person’s soul would be endlessly tormented.

It was like being dropped into hell and revived after every death, only to suffer once more. It was a bit similar to his karmic flames tempering the soul.

If it was used as punishment, a person’s soul would directly dissipate within it. If it was used as a trial, a person had to endure that torment for around twenty days. But a normal person would have their will crumble after just two or three days.

Once the trial was started, there was no stopping it. They had to go through all the reincarnations for it to end. Moreover, the rate of failure was extremely high, and the cost of failure was death or a broken mind. The academy did not advocate for using this place as a trial.

“Alright. If he really has that courage, if he passes, I can accept him into the Dragonblood Legion.” Long Chen sighed. Every person had the right to pursue their dream. Although Long Chen didn’t look favorably upon Li Cai’s chances, he could not reject him.

“Haha, I knew that boss would agree. He already went,” said Qin Feng.

Long Chen was speechless. Qin Feng’s guts were also quite big. He actually dared to make such a decision. But he had truly read Long Chen’s mind perfectly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

During the next few days, the other heavenly geniuses of the High Firmament Academy started undergoing their own tribulations in Crane Cry Valley. As for Long Chen, he spent these ten days recuperating and finally obtained control over his explosive divine flame energy.

On this day, Long Chen found a secluded place for himself and took out the golden dragon scale.

“Merging with me definitely won’t be an insult to you.”

After saying that, he placed his hand on the scale. It shuddered and golden light erupted. After that, a clear dragon cry rang out. The surrounding mountains instantly shattered, and a sacred dragon might soared into the heavens.
