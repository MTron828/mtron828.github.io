Chapter 3349 Creating an Earth Tier Immortal King

“What?” Long Chen jumped in shock. He didn’t quite dare to believe it. This Heavenly Dao Fruit would lead to death if consumed?

“I’m not sure why. My intuition is telling me that I will instantly die if I eat it. It’s a fatal feeling,” said Luo Changwu certainly.

“Then don’t eat it. Let me take a look.” Long Chen took back the Heavenly Dao Fruit.

Every expert had a sharp sense of danger. They would naturally feel an intense crisis if they were going to eat something that could kill them.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In the immortal world, there was almost no such thing as poisoning someone’s food to kill them. It was far too difficult to succeed. Long Chen trusted Luo Changwu’s perception.

However, how could the Heavenly Dao Fruit be poisoned? It was impossible. Was it due to the aura of the other worlds? That didn’t seem likely.

Long Chen’s mind once more sank into the primal chaos space. Looking at the fruit, he suddenly realized something.

Only now did he find that amongst the 999 special fruits, there were some whose marks were not quite the same as the others. Long Chen had plucked one of those.

Looking carefully, he found 99 of them were somewhat different. But it wasn’t too easy to tell. It would be extremely easy to get them mixed up.

However, when he carefully sensed their auras, there was definitely a slight difference. With that, he checked even more closely and found that nine of these ninety-nine were also different. The one in his hand was one of those nine.

“9000 ordinary Heavenly Dao Fruit, 900 with the aura of Spirit tier Immortal Kings, 90 with unclear aura, and nine of the fourth class. Their aura is vague, but I do sense the slightest similarity with Bai Zhantang’s aura, as well as Xiaole and Shishi’s mothers. Are they Mortal tier, Spirit tier, Earth tier, and Heaven tier fruits respectively? But then that would mean Bai Zhantang is a Heaven tier Immortal King.”

Long Chen was dumbfounded. If that really was the case, then when Long Chen became an Immortal King, he could directly advance to the Heaven tier without cultivating those tiers.

Furthermore, it wasn’t just himself. As long as he had enough Heavenly Dao Fruits, he could create Heaven tier Immortal Kings. That was absolutely heaven-defying.

Long Chen almost fell from the shock. Such a heaven-defying thing could topple the nine heavens and ten lands. Long Chen looked at the Heavenly Dao Tree in disbelief. Just how terrifying of an existence was this tree?

“There’s a clear difference between the auras of the first class and second class fruits. But there isn’t much difference between the second class and the third class, and it’s even harder to tell the difference between the third class and fourth class. Does that mean that they aren’t fully matured?”

Long Chen sank into thought. He had killed countless heavenly geniuses from multiple worlds in the battle of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. Could it be that even after absorbing so much energy, it still wasn’t enough?

“Long Chen!”

Seeing Long Chen staring into space for so long, Luo Changwu eventually shouted at him. He didn’t know that Long Chen’s mind had entered a different world.

“I can try it if you want. Maybe it was a misperception.”

Long Chen woke up and then said, “Your intuition can’t be wrong. Martial-uncle, try this fruit instead.”

Long Chen handed him a different Heavenly Dao Fruit, one for the Spirit Tier. As a result, Luo Changwu sensed endless spiritual qi within it, and he also sensed his Spirit Root quivering in excitement.

“This is a treasure that I need!” exclaimed Luo Changwu. Even his Spirit Root had reacted. This was definitely a treasure.

Long Chen indicated for him to eat it. He also activated the formation, and endless spiritual qi poured into this room for Luo Changwu to use.

Luo Changwu’s body didn’t even twitch after consuming it, but his aura began to ripple. In the beginning, if it was a calm lake, first it began to ripple, and then it started to boil. Immortal qi also appeared around him. After an hour, his aura had completely transformed.

When he opened his eyes, they were glowing splendidly. He seemed to shine, as if he had completely changed.

“Long Chen… I… I… I really did upgrade my Spirit Root! I became a Spirit tier Immortal King?!” Although Luo Changwu knew that he had advanced, he still didn’t dare to believe it.

“Congratulations, martial-uncle!” Long Chen laughed. He was even more excited than Luo Changwu. He almost started jumping.

With such a heaven-defying Heavenly Dao Fruit, who did Long Chen have to fear? Once he gathered the Dragonblood Legion, he would have a legion of Heaven tier Immortal Kings. Then who would care about Enpuda? He could directly go find Lord Brahma.

Luo Changwu felt like he was dreaming. Just as he was still filled with disbelief, Long Chen took out another fruit.

“Martial-uncle, why don’t you try this one as well? Do you feel any danger from it?”

Luo Changwu jumped. He received another fruit and didn’t sense any danger. Furthermore, his Spirit Root once more became active. Although it wasn’t as intense as before, it was clearly longing for this treasure.

Since he didn’t sense danger, Long Chen had Luo Changwu consume it. This was a third class Heavenly Dao Fruit, or perhaps he should call it an Earth tier Heavenly Dao Fruit.

However, Long Chen was disappointed by the result. After the fruit was consumed, its energy was absorbed by Luo Changwu’s Spirit Root. There definitely was a certain change in the Spirit Root, and his aura did seem a bit different as well. But he didn’t advance to become an Earth Tier Immortal King.

Despite not advancing, Luo Changwu was still delighted. This fruit had still made his Spirit Root progress in quality. It was equivalent to years of bitter cultivation.

“I understand. Most likely, this Earth tier Heavenly Dao Fruit isn’t fully matured, so it doesn’t have the full effect.” Long Chen finally figured out why the auras of the third class and fourth class fruits weren’t that different from the second class.

He began to give Luo Changwu more Earth tier Heavenly Dao Fruit. Luo Changwu then consumed thirteen of them before his Spirit Root suddenly shook and a violent qi wave exploded out of him. Caught off-guard, Long Chen was blown back, almost coughing up blood.

“Long Chen, are you alright?” Luo Changwu ran over.

Long Chen waved his hand, indicating that he was fine. He was shocked. There was truly a difference between the Spirit tier and the Earth tier. Just Luo Changwu’s aura alone was enough to injure him. If they were to truly fight, he probably wouldn’t be able to receive a single attack.

The difference between a Spirit tier Immortal King and an Earth tier Immortal King was no longer something that could be bridged with quantity. It was a truly qualitative change.

Luo Changwu was also stunned. Just before this, he had been depressed about being an ordinary Mortal tier Immortal King. But now, he suddenly became an Earth tier Immortal King. He sensed endless energy thrumming within his body. Combining the power of his Spirit Root and the violet qi around his body, he seemed to be the master of heaven and earth. This kind of feeling was almost enough to make him weep out of emotion.

With this test, Long Chen came to several conclusions. One, the Heavenly Dao Fruit could not be consumed across levels or the consumer would die.

Second, the Heavenly Dao Fruits that weren’t fully mature were still useful, and their lack of maturity could be made up for with numbers to have the same effect.

Long Chen then turned his attention to the Heaven tier Heavenly Dao Fruit. But ultimately, he shook his head. The amount of energy inside them was far too low. Even if all nine were consumed, they couldn’t possibly allow Luo Changwu to reach the Heaven tier. So, it was better to keep them and have them slowly mature.

“Martial-uncle, when you go back, have uncle Wen come. You can also pick out nine thousand elites of the Luo family to come to my seventh branch academy.”

Long Chen’s eyes began to shine. Since the Dragonblood Legion had yet to come, he would first raise the Luo family’s disciples!
