Chapter 4011 A GambleVịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Senior, what are you doing?!”

Long Chen’s dragon scales were blocked by some mysterious energy, and he found himself unable to summon them. This sudden setback was dire, as his physical body alone was unable to block that sharp Sword Qi.

After all, unlike the challenges he faced on the seventh and eighth levels, the attacks here were ruthless and aimed directly at taking his life.

The dragon expert’s voice suddenly became heavy and grave. “To refine the will requires the threat of death. Long Chen, let me put it to you this way. The power of your enemies far exceeds your imagination. The nine stars have helped you accomplish your goals, but they have also drawn you into a giant storm. Sooner or later, you will face your true enemy. But with your current cultivation speed, even if you were given ten thousand years, you wouldn’t be able to fight your enemies. So, I decided to gamble. In any case, if you really cannot grow past this point, your father and mother will die. Rather than just watching as they die miserable deaths, why not be more straightforward and skip to the end?”

“Senior, what are you saying?!” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He had a bad feeling.

“If you are unable to pass this trial, you will not be able to escape the demonic claws of fate. I have gambled my hopes on you. Since that’s the case, let’s be direct. Let’s see if you have the qualifications to keep me gambling on you. If you really are the son of destiny, you naturally won’t die here. If you aren’t, you will die a terrible death sooner or later, so dying now might actually be a kind of release for you,” sighed the dragon expert.

“Senior!”

Long Chen suddenly found that he couldn’t move his body at all. A mysterious energy had sealed his movements, leaving him unable to even blink.

Just then, he was horrified to sense a ray of Sword Qi condensing behind him.

The next moment, a fire-red sword pierced out of his back and through his chest. Its violent power almost blew apart his body.

In his sealed state, he couldn’t heal nor defend, thus, he could only watch as that sword pierced his body.

“Senior, are you trying to kill me?!” Long Chen roared. But he was unable to speak, so this was a spiritual roar.

“Even if I don’t kill you, someone else will. Whether you are a dragon or a serpent will be seen right now. If you cannot activate your will, all your cultivation will be meaningless anyway, so let everything come to an end here! This is fate.” The dragon expert sighed helplessly.

Just then, Long Chen was horrified to sense space twisting in front of him. The invisible blade’s target was his head.

Sensing this, Long Chen grew frantic. He crazily struggled, but he had no idea what the dragon expert had done to him. He couldn’t move.

“No! I can’t die!” Long Chen roared.

However, the dragon expert ignored everything Long Chen said. After that, the invisible sharp sword condensed and shot at his head, its aura of death enveloping Long Chen. He knew that if this attack landed, he would definitely die.

The next moment, Long Chen’s vision turned dark as he descended into endless darkness. Within that darkness, he saw Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Yu Qingxuan, Zi Yan, Dong Mingyu, Ye Zhiqiu, and the others’ faces. Their faces were full of worry and fear, as if they could see him dying but were powerless to help him.

He also saw Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, Wilde, and the other Dragonblood warriors roaring, crazily rushing to him.

He saw the faces of his father and mother and heard the cries of his biological parents. Their voices were full of pain and unwillingness.

“I can’t die!”

With a heaven-shaking roar, the darkness dispersed and his vision returned. But at this time, the sword was already right on his forehead. Even if he could move, he couldn’t dodge it.

The next moment, blood sprayed as the sharp sword sliced through the air, leaving a long gash on Long Chen's cheek.

Long Chen's head remained immobilized; he still couldn't move. However, to his astonishment, the sword suddenly veered away from its original trajectory, as if forced off course by some unseen power, sparing his forehead from the deadly blow.

Just then, another sword condensed and shot at his head again, giving Long Chen no time to think.

When the sword was about to pierce his head, it came to an abrupt halt, as if an invisible hand had caught it, preventing it from moving even an inch forward.

In an instant, Long Chen felt the mysterious energy that had sealed his movements dissipate, and he found himself able to move again. However, he remained rooted in place, his gaze fixed on the sword in front of him, not daring to make a single move.

“It seems that we won our gamble.”

The dragon expert sighed with relief. Clearly, it had also been nervous.

“Senior, are you really trying to kill me?” asked Long Chen darkly as he stared at the sword right in front of him.

“No. If you were unable to awaken this power in front of death, I would save you. I’d then send you to your brothers and lovers so you could have your reunion, then you could face death together. You would no longer have any chance of winning, so you might as well have some joy before dying. You can enjoy your final time together,” said the dragon expert.

Hearing that, Long Chen felt much better. Just now, he really had almost died, causing fury and resentment to swell up within him. He didn’t like that feeling. Even if it was for his own good, he would not allow anyone to control his life or death.

However, after hearing these sincere words, Long Chen’s fury instantly vanished like smoke in the wind. The dragon expert’s origins were mysterious, and it knew countless secrets that Long Chen was unaware of. Deep inside, Long Chen always remembered everything that it had done for him.

It could be said that his life had been saved by the dragon expert on multiple occasions. Long Chen had even admitted that he owed the dragon expert this life.

“Senior, I’m sorry.”

Long Chen apologized for his anger. This life of his was saved by the dragon expert, so even if it wanted his life, Long Chen shouldn’t complain. His outburst of anger was akin to forgetting the gratitude he owed to the dragon expert.

“There is no need for courtesy between the two of us. I know that you don’t like being controlled by others,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded. He really hated that feeling, as it drew out his most hated memories. That feeling of powerlessness was worse than death.

Those memories seemed to be the painful ones of when he was bullied in the Phoenix Cry Empire. However, they also seemed to stem from the Pill Sovereign’s memories. In any case, it was very difficult to endure.

Just then, space quivered and two swords shot toward Long Chen from different directions, enveloping him with a sensation of death once more.
