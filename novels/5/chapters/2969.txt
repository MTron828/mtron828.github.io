Chapter 2958 Money Making Method

Luo Qingyang had actually caused Luo Bing to explode in fury. As a result, Luo Qifeng and the others were extremely embarrassed and could only leave with him.

Mu Qingyun sighed and said, “Now I understand why you had to set up your own Luo Gate. That person’s intelligence is severely lacking.”

Even at such a time, Luo Qingyang could say such a thing. He really was brainless.

Chu Yang had brought a coffin to humiliate the Luo family, and for Luo Bing, Long Chen had even slapped Chu Yang in the face, causing him to flee in disgrace. He had won this battle for them.

However, Luo Qingyang showed no sign of gratitude. After the third strongest guild came to find trouble for them, he actually said some heartless words, saying that Luo Bing had been implicated by Long Chen.

Wasn’t the reason Long Chen had formed an undying enmity with the Chu family mostly because of the Luo family? That was why Luo Qingyang’s words completely infuriated Luo Bing and Luo Ning, as well as Luo Qifeng and the other experts of the Luo family.

“I will not leave the disciples of the Luo family to the mercy of this person’s leadership. Three days from now, we are going to fight for rankings. At the very least, we need to get in the top hundred,” declared Luo Bing frostily.

“Ignore him for now. It’s not worth being vexed for him. Today is a day of celebration, and we’ve already prepared the food and wine. Let’s celebrate! Thank you everyone for coming.” In the end, it was Luo Ning who managed to settle things and invite everyone in.

It went without saying that as the headquarters of the Luo Gate, this immortal cave was very large. They weren’t packed at all.

There was even a dueling ring, classrooms, private rooms, and training rooms. This was the heart of a guild. Normally, disciples that were part of the guild would be active here, as this was the most convenient place for them to be.

However, this place was not cheap. It cost one million immortal crystals every month to maintain. Furthermore, such a mountain and immortal cave was only offered to guilds. An individual couldn’t apply for one. Only if a guild managed to enter the top two hundred guilds would this rent cost be removed.

Moreover, upon entering the top hundred, there was even a large reward every month. The higher your ranking, the greater the reward.

The Luo Alliance was ranked tenth, and their monthly reward was over three million immortal crystals. That was an eye-watering reward.

Most guilds were only built to fight for those rewards. The academy favored such actions.

This would unify disciples and make them strive to advance. Furthermore, when the disciples competed, it wouldn’t just allow them to see which disciples were talented in terms of cultivation, but it would also allow them to see who possessed the ability to unify and lead these disciples. Great leaders could be found through such a system.

They moved on to a banquet. Long Chen, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, Li Cai, and the others were sitting at a table. Luo Bing then asked Long Chen just how he had managed to form an enmity with the third rank guild.

Long Chen’s explanation made Li Cai sigh. “The inner academy is full of monsters. They’re so domineering and vile.”

Li Cai had seen quite a few cases of the strong bullying the weak in the inner academy. Those were powerful existences that others had no choice but to submit to.

“Vile? Aren’t they only acting like that for the weak to get into the habit of submitting? In the inner academy, if you want to stand tall, you must be ruthless. You need to be ruthless to others and ruthless to yourself. If someone bullies you, fight with your life on the line. Worst case, you bring them down with you. The soft are afraid of the tough, and the tough are afraid of the strong, and the strong are afraid of those who are willing to risk it all. Just bring out the zeal you had when I trained you, and I guarantee while you might suffer at the start, you will find very quickly that no one will dare to provoke you any further. If you show weaknesses, then you will have created a barrier to your future advancement. If you consider that those bullies are destroying your future prospects, do you have any reason not to go all out?” said Long Chen lightly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“That’s right. They are leaving a shadow in our hearts to set us back. This grave danger cannot be tolerated. Next time, I’ll directly go all out against them!” declared Li Cai.

Just being cursed and kicked a few times didn’t actually pose any danger to one’s life. Most people would endure it. But now they realized that those people were unforgivable. They were shaking their foundations, destroying their futures.

“No wonder brother San won’t give a single inch,” said Zhong Ling.

“What are you talking about? Under normal circumstances, I’m very amiable. Losing a little bit isn’t something to quibble about. However, if it impacts my cultivation, then I will view whoever caused it as my enemy. To kill my enemies is very normal. I’ve already failed once, and I won’t fail a second time. Those who block my way are not just trying to kill me, but they are trying to kill the people around me as well. I won’t pay the price for other people’s foolishness. I don’t want to join you because I don’t want to put you in danger as well,” said Long Chen.

“Brother San, join us. We’re not afraid of Chu Yang or Long Yanzong,” said Zhong Ling, clenching her little fist.

“Them?” Long Chen smiled and shook his head. “They’re nothing more than minor characters. Even the Chu family behind Chu Yang is nothing to me. My enemies are countless times stronger than the Chu family, and the Chu family is like an ant in comparison. Actually, there is no comparison.”

Compared to Lord Brahma, the Chu family wasn’t worth diddly squat. Lord Brahma was an unimaginably terrifying existence.

Long Chen maintained a distance from Mu Qingyun and the others to protect them. When he was exposed, he didn’t want to implicate them.

“Even more terrifying than the Chu family?” This time, even Luo Bing was shocked. Was Long Chen really an ascender from the lower world? How could he have such terrifying enemies?

“Long Chen, what are you planning to do in the short term?” probed Luo Bing.

“I’m going to think of a way to make money. Let me tell you, a person must read more books. But reading books in the academy is incredibly expensive,” sighed Long Chen.

“If you want to make money, I have a good way. Do you wish to work together?” Luo Bing’s eyes brightened.
