Chapter 3265 You’re Still Too Immature

Long Chen’s response pleased Jiang Baihe. But the patriarch’s expression grew exceedingly ugly.

Things had progressed to this point, so all his previous efforts were for nothing. Seeing Jiang Weizhong’s expression as if victory was in his grasp, the patriarch was ashen with rage.

No one could change Jiang Baihe’s haughty arrogance. The patriarch knew that he had been spoiled rotten. From his childhood, he had always had Jiang Weizhong supporting him.

If the patriarch used his status to forcibly stop this, Jiang Baihe would definitely refuse. He might very likely abandon his status as a disciple of the Yuhua Palace just to fight Long Chen.

The patriarch could only sigh and stop trying to fight it.

Seeing that the patriarch was silent, Jiang Baihe said, “Come, Long Chen. Show me what abilities the dual champion of the Nine Prefecture Convention has. I’ll show you that you are nothing more than a frog at the bottom of a well. In front of me, you being champion is nothing more than a huge joke.”

Long Chen coldly looked at him. “As you wish. Activate the martial stage!”

“Activate the martial stage? This martial stage is unable to endure my power. Let’s fight outside the palace.” Jiang Baihe laughed arrogantly and flew out of the palace just like that. His speed left people smacking their lips.

Long Chen snorted and also shot off. After that, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Qi Yu, Qin Feng, and Xu Zixiong followed.

When the palace master rose, the patriarch sighed. “Weizhong, your foolishness has finally resulted in the death of your great-grandson.”

Jiang Weizhong shook his head. “Patriarch, you’ve been in seclusion for too long, and you don’t know what’s been happening in the outside world. Jiang Baihe’s power is not to be underestimated. You’ll definitely be surprised by him. It would not be an exaggeration to say that with his power, he can sweep through the Heavenly Star Domain’s junior generation!”

Jiang Weizhong had absolute confidence in Jiang Baihe’s power. He didn’t think that anyone in the same realm could defeat this great-grandson of his. Moreover, he thought that the patriarch was already so old. As people got older, their guts got smaller. It was no longer his era.

“Today, I’ll show everyone just how terrifying Baihe is. Just wait and see!” Jiang Weizhong laughed and walked out.

The elders of the Yuhua Palace were shaken inside. Jiang Weizhong no longer seemed to have much respect for the patriarch. He actually dared to leave on his own? That was disrespectful.

However, many elders bowed to the patriarch and left as well.

These elders could see that the palace master seemed to be dissatisfied with the patriarch’s conservative methods. The two of them were starting to conflict.

Only a few dozen elders remained. They were mostly the older ones, and in the same vein as the others, they were dissatisfied as well, but not with the patriarch. The palace master was also ignoring them.

Yu Xuan and her master, the vice palace master, stayed behind. Yu Xuan then looked at the patriarch’s furious expression and knelt on the ground. With a sob, she said, “Patriarch, it was my fault. I was the cause of all of this…”

Hearing this, the patriarch recovered from his rage and shook his head. He walked over to her and lifted her up. “Good child. Although your talent isn’t as good as Jiang Baihe’s, your heart is pure. You are blessed with good fortune. In the future, I’ll probably be depending on you to be the pillar of the Yuhua Palace.”

When the patriarch said this, all the remaining experts’ expressions changed. How could he say such a thing?

“Patriarch, you…!” Yu Xuan’s first thought was that the patriarch had gotten muddled with rage.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The patriarch waved his hand. “Let’s go. We have to watch. Sigh, having big guts is good, but without care, these guts will cause a disaster. This matter is my fault.”

The outside of the Yuhua Palace was filled with mountain ranges spreading beyond the horizon. This was all the territory of the Yuhua Palace and also the hunting grounds of its disciples.

Long Chen and Jiang Baihe stopped in a mountain valley. Bai Shishi and the others were watching from not too far away.

Behind Jiang Baihe were countless experts of the Yuhua Palace, and Jiang Weizhong was amongst them.

When the patriarch appeared, it caused even further chaos. The patriarch was actually standing beside Jiang Weizhong. When he stood there, Jiang Weizhong maintained a polite expression, but there was a disdainful expression in his eyes. Clearly, he had won this round. The patriarch had no choice but to lower his head to him.

“Weizhong, do you remember when you were seven and joined the Yuhua Palace?” asked the patriarch suddenly.

“Yes, patriarch.” Jiang Weizhong nodded. He looked at the patriarch, not knowing what he was trying to say.

However, seeing his flat expression, Jiang Weizhong felt refreshed. It seemed that after this competition, the patriarch was planning on conceding to him. In the future, the patriarch would no longer disturb his matters.

The patriarch continued, “I remember that up until you were fifteen, there was no sign of your bloodline awakening. You were always bullied by others. There were several times when others almost killed you. Later on, your bloodline awakened and you soared. Anyone who had targeted you before was killed. At ninety-seven, you became an Immortal King. You were the seventh genius of the Yuhua Palace who managed to become an Immortal King before a hundred. You went through a grand journey throughout the Heavenly Star Domain. Eventually, you challenged Wild Saber Luo Zichuan. However, you were defeated by a single blow of his saber, and your soul was badly wounded. It took four hundred years for you to recuperate…”

Jiang Weizhong’s expression sank. He coldly said, “That was my carelessness. Luo Zichuan was also despicable. He simply attacked without saying anything…”

When Jiang Weizhong ascended to the Immortal King realm, he saw a boundless future before him. As a result, he challenged Luo Zichuan. However, Luo Zichuan ignored him until he destroyed one of the towers by the Luo family’s gates.

In his fury, Luo Zichuan almost killed Jiang Weizhong with a single blow. If it hadn’t been for a protective divine item protecting him as he fled, he would have lost his life.

After returning to the Yuhua Palace, Jiang Weizhong tucked his tail between his legs and quietly healed. He no longer dared to go out and mess around. That battle had turned him into a laughingstock, one of Luo Zichuan’s stepping stones to fame.

That was his life’s greatest humiliation. Hence, when the patriarch brought this up in front of so many people, he was enraged.

The patriarch calmly continued, “Winning and losing is common among warriors. When you unsheathe your sword, you must be ready to resheathe it as well. Only someone who understands how to retreat will understand how to go on the offense. After that battle, I found that you had reserved yourself and felt that you had matured. Thus, I recommended you to be promoted to the position of palace master. But I didn’t expect history to repeat itself again. You didn’t pass on your bloody lesson to your great-grandson. He is just as arrogant as you were back then, and just like you from back then, he lacks any respect. Even the path he is walking is the exact same. Could it be that this identical story was fated? Haha, you lost to Luo Zichuan back then. Do you know that just before this, Long Chen received Luo Zichuan’s guidance? He just destroyed the Chu family.”

Jiang Weizhong’s expression changed. He rarely bothered with things outside of the Heavenly Star Domain, so he had no idea about Long Chen’s relationship with the Luo family. But he quickly sneered, “You mean that Long Chen is Luo Zichuan’s apprentice? Then that’s excellent. Once Jiang Baihe kills Long Chen, he will avenge the humiliation of that saber blow from back then.”

“Child. You are still too immature.” The patriarch sighed.

Just then, Jiang Baihe’s entire body began to shine brightly. His Blood Qi raged and he entered his combat state.

“It’s begun!” Everyone instantly tensed up.
