Chapter 3696 Business Opportunity

“That’s not her most terrifying aspect. Her character is not at all like that of an assassin, as she doesn’t have the slightest cool. I’m afraid that if you force her, she will try to drag you down with her. Perhaps she will use a life-sacrificing summon. That kind of summoning can bring forth a monster several times stronger than her. When I was young, I encountered someone with the Asura bloodline. He was capable of doing a life-sacrificing summon. He was far from a match for me, but his final summoning almost took my life. Although this summoning comes at the price of the user’s longevity to use, and using it will cripple them, that woman is just like her master. I estimate that if you force her, she will be willing to use this technique. Unless you have no other choice, don’t back her into a corner. If you want to kill her, it would be best if you directly killed her before giving her a chance to use that technique,” warned Xia Guhong solemnly.

Long Chen, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen were shaken. Even Xia Guhong had almost died to that life-sacrificing summon. They couldn’t believe it.

“Is the Asura race really so powerful?” asked Guo Ran.

“The Asura race lives for killing, and every single one of them is a natural-born warrior. In the Asura world, there are not just the Asura race but also divine beasts that are just as brutal. The beasts that they summon are all elites amongst elites. But there are huge differences in their power, and no one knows what kind of existence they will summon. Anyway, I was unlucky against that Asura expert. That person summoned a great desolate species, one that could kill the summoner with a wave of its hand. But he still managed to summon it. Thus, the life-sacrificing summon is unreasonably terrifying. If your luck is good, she might not be able to summon anything as strong. But it would be best if you were cautious,” implored Xia Guhong.

As soon as Xia Guhong mentioned luck, Long Chen’s expression sank. Guo Ran and Xia Chen looked at him, both knowing that Long Chen’s luck was heaven-defying.

“Boss, I think you should keep your distance from that woman. Let the two of us deal with her,” said Xia Chen.

Based on Long Chen’s heaven-defying luck, perhaps the Nine Underworld Luocha would summon some terrifying, unprecedented monster.

Just then, they heard a familiar sound. There was drumming and then another voice rang out.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

Long Chen and the others were startled. Hadn’t those people already been killed? How did they come back? Were they revived?

Looking over, they noticed that it was a completely different group. But even from a distance, they could see the curses on their bodies. This was another group made by Mo Nian.

“Oh? Why are there people from the Nine Underworld Hall with them?” Guo Ran noticed that there were assassins of the Nine Underworld Hall present around that group.

Long Chen was speechless. “Liao Bencang really is shameless.”

When Long Chen said this, Guo Ran and Xia Chen instantly understood. Liao Bencang found that these groups were humiliating Enpuda, so he actually sent people to protect them just to anger Enpuda.

In terms of intelligence, he couldn’t beat Enpuda. But now that he had a chance to anger Enpuda, he naturally wouldn’t let him off. Hence, he ordered these people to shout as loudly as possible to draw as much attention as possible.

“Liao Bencang has opened my eyes to the world.” Xia Guhong shook his head. Even for an existence that had lived for countless years, it was his first time seeing such an existence.

“Mo Nian’s fame really is going to soar now. I’m jealous.” Guo Ran watched as this group beat their drums and shouted for Mo Nian.

“Just looking at them, you can tell that they aren’t good people. Mo Nian is killing two birds with one stone like this.” Xia Chen smiled.

“Don’t worry, I trust that we’ll definitely see that flashy man in the three thousand worlds.” Long Chen also smiled. He wanted to see Mo Nian as well, so he was full of anticipation.

Last time, if it hadn’t been for Mo Nian, Long Chen would have been caught by Enpuda and dragged through space. At that time, Long Chen was worried for Mo Nian. But now that he thought about it, his worries had been for nothing. Perhaps Mo Nian’s accomplishments were not at all inferior to his own.

“Boss, there’s someone who set up a big building over there. It looks to be a restaurant. Let’s take a look.” Guo Ran pointed in the distance.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When they looked at where he pointed, there really was a tall building. But curiously, there had been no buildings there before. It somehow appeared in the blink of an eye.

Just as they spotted it, they saw people building a whole marketplace on top of the ruins. Long Chen even saw the signboard of the Huayun Trading Company.

“As expected, businessmen have the sharpest noses. Their first thought is that this is a business opportunity,” praised Xia Chen.

This place was an entrance to the three thousand worlds. The entrance hadn’t even appeared, but a huge number of experts from different places had already gathered. There would be a huge number of people here to do business with.

Furthermore, not everyone was fully prepared for this opening of the three thousand worlds. There would be plenty of people rushing over in a hurry, and they would need to buy some life-saving talismans and items. If the demand was high, the Huayun Trading Company could make a huge profit.

“Boss, we should get a good spot for ourselves while we have the chance. Perhaps we can get some useful things,” said Guo Ran somewhat urgently. Xia Chen was the same. The two of them could sell some things in exchange for some useful treasures. Perhaps they might get an unexpected harvest.

“Alright, go. I’ll accompany big brother,” said Long Chen, waving them off. In truth, Long Chen also wanted to take a look, but to leave Xia Guhong here alone would be far too rude.

As soon as Long Chen assented, Xia Chen and Guo Ran ran off, finding a good place to set up a shop.

The good spots had been taken by the major merchant companies. Hence, Xia Chen and Guo Ran occupied a place that wasn’t particularly conspicuous but also wasn’t bad. In a bit, once more people came, this region would definitely be considered a central place. Guo Ran then set up his wares. There were some weapons, concealed killing instruments, and some particular ores and crystals from the Alldevil Star-Field.

As for Xia Chen, he put all sorts of talismans on display. In order to drum up business, he had a talisman illuminate them with divine light. Even from a great distance, people would be able to clearly see them. They were very flashy.

“It seems that the two of us can’t go too far. For these two to put on such an arrogant show, they might get robbed in a bit.” Seeing Xia Chen’s method, Xia Guhong smiled. Xia Chen had many life-saving talismans here, and they were all very expensive. They would definitely attract a crowd soon.

“It would be best if someone did try to rob them. Then we could openly rob them back.” Long Chen laughed with anticipation.

The two of them came to the entrance to the restaurant, and a beautiful attendant immediately came to receive them. This restaurant’s master was actually a true Divine Venerate. Most likely, only a Divine Venerate would be capable of keeping things orderly here.

Long Chen and Xia Guhong went to the third floor and found a table by the window. From here, they could overlook everything around Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s shops.

Long Chen ordered a few dishes. Although they were a hundred times more expensive than in the outside world, Long Chen didn’t mind. When the food came, Long Chen took out wine and was in the midst of pouring it for Xia Guhong when he saw Xia Guhong’s expression become a bit odd.

Following his gaze, Long Chen saw a man with a scar on his face. He wore golden robes, a golden crown, and a golden belt.

When that man appeared, he also spotted Xia Guhong, and his gaze instantly became as sharp as a blade, filled with hostility.
