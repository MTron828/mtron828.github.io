“Fuck, this choice isn’t so easy. I’ll still offend one of them or maybe both.”

Long Chen didn’t know why Nangong Zuiyue was helping him, but he wouldn’t be so narcissistic as to believe that she had really fallen for him. Nor would he believe that she was helping him over some random phrase he had said. Even if she was just lending him the money, wouldn’t repaying it take several lifetimes for someone as poor as him?

Perhaps Nangong Zuiyue knew that Long Chen could refine pills, but she definitely didn’t know his true level. If she was truly investing in him, then she must be a great risk-taker.

Long Chen didn’t know Nangong Zuiyue’s goal. On the other hand, he liked Beitang Rushuang’s direct manner of doing things. Her goal was always clear.

“How about I borrow half from each of you? Once I have money, I’ll repay whoever needs it urgently first. Of course, if you need my help, as long as it’s not too much, I will help. Just treat it as interest. To tell the truth, compared to two rich people like you, I’m just a little beggar. I can’t offend either of you, but this pill furnace is truly important to me. So, please, I hope that you two beautiful, kind, and generous rich people will stick by me,” said Long Chen. After thinking about it, he felt that this pill furnace was more important. Even if he had to owe them a favor, he needed it.

Perhaps borrowing from just one of them would be too dangerous, but if both of them lent him half, that would leave room for negotiation and wouldn’t offend either of them.

Furthermore, owing money to two beautiful women with transcendent statuses shouldn’t be a bad thing.

“Hmph, slick.” Beitang Rushuang snorted, but she was able to accept this condition.

As for Nangong Zuiyue, she didn’t display any reaction. She simply handed over a jade bottle to Long Chen.

Long Chen accepted the bottle with his thanks. He carefully opened it for a look and saw fifty semi-transparent water droplets.

Each droplet had a tiny dragon swimming within it, and a burst of pure natural energy came out of the bottle when he opened it. This was the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva.

Long Chen’s left and right hands shook at the same time. Lei Long and Huo Long actually sent him a message at the same time, requesting this Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. It was very beneficial to them.

This was an extremely precious natural treasure, something that had only existed in the ancient era. In the current Martial Heaven Continent, it was almost impossible for it to appear again.

“Endure it. Once I’m stronger, I’ll definitely help you get more of it.” Long Chen could only comfort the two of them like this. Lei Long and Huo Long were both intelligent enough to understand, but they couldn’t help begging him for it. That meant that it was extremely important to them.

“What? Are you hesitating?” Beitang Rushuang also handed over her portion, only to find him staring at the bottle in a daze. He looked conflicted.

“I’m suddenly not willing to part with it. The Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva is also useful to me,” said Long Chen bitterly.

Beitang Rushuang was speechless. “For good or bad, you are the top genius of your generation. Can you have more integrity and be decisive?”

“Ah, rich people don’t know the struggles of the starving people. Fine, I’ll carry out the trade, so don’t look down on me.” Long Chen could only painfully hand those two bottles to the attendant of the Dongfang family.

The attendant smiled, thinking that Long Chen was just acting poor to tease the two peerless women beside him. She didn’t know that Long Chen was truly poor. “Alright, then this Star Refining Furnace is now yours.”

“You don’t even need to check it?” asked Long Chen.

“No need. I trust the characters of fairy Rushuang and fairy Zuiyue.”

Long Chen asked, “Does it mean that you don’t trust my character? Ah, if I had known this would happen, I would have faked the two bottles of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva and kept the real stuff. Ah, so sad, I didn’t think of that.”

“Long Chen...”

Long Chen’s regretful expression seemed to say that he could have stolen the Peak Dao Transformation dragon Saliva and then blame the two of them for it, making Beitang Rushuang angry.

Long Chen hastily waved his hand. “Ah... it was just a joke. Am I, Long Chen, such a person? So since the pill furnace is mine now, can I have it?”

This platform was restricted. Others couldn’t touch what was inside.

“Of course, it’s yours now. However, the divine light barrier will take an incense stick’s worth of time to dissipate. I’ve already started the process, so please wait a moment,” answered the attendant.

An incense stick’s worth of time was a short time, but Long Chen was filled with too much anticipation to wait.

He could openly sense just how amazing this pill furnace was. The starry images on top of the pill furnace filled him with emotion. His hands were already getting itchy.

To the side, Beitang Rushuang frowned. Just how was it possible that Long Chen didn’t have any of the mannerisms of an expert? All his emotions were written on his face, and that lacked any of the charms of a supreme expert. She even suspected that she had made a mistake. Had she wasted her money by lending him the fifty drops of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva?

“A Star Refining Furnace actually managed to sell for a hundred drops of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. How unexpected.”

At this moment, a mocking voice rang out. Long Chen looked back to see a man walking over.

“Zhao Wuji, this pull furnace was yours?” Beitang Rushuang’s frown deepened. She hadn’t expected to have actually benefited Zhao Wuji. That irritated her.

This pill furnace was fundamentally not worth that price, but since Long Chen wanted it and she wanted something from Long Chen, she had lent him the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva.

If her action benefited someone else, she was alright with it, but for Zhao Wuji to be the one getting an advantage over it made her feel disgusted. The Mechanism Sect’s people were trash, but no one could do anything about them.

“Mister Zhao, you came at the perfect time. The transaction has already been completed. This is yours.” The attendant handed over the two bottles to Zhao Wuji.

Zhao Wuji received the bottles, and upon looking inside, he smiled. He took out a drop of the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. Grabbing the attendant’s hand, he placed a drop of it into her hand, smiling. “This is my thanks. You really are my lucky star. A broken furnace was actually bought by an idiot, hahaha.”

“Mister Zhao, you can’t...” The attendant felt chills at being grabbed by Zhao Wuji. She had long since heard of Zhao Wuji’s infamy. As for the drop of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva, it was too precious for her to accept.

“Since I, Zhao Wuji, wish to give it to you, why can’t I?”

Zhao Wuji pressed the drop into her hand, touching her hand much longer than he needed to, seemingly without realizing it.

The attendant turned red out of embarrassment. Fortunately, Zhao Wuji didn’t go too far before letting go.

Just at this moment, the divine light protecting the pill furnace dissipated. Zhao Wuji looked at the pill furnace and then smiled at Long Chen. “You are Long Chen, correct? Perhaps you don’t know who I am, but that’s not important. I should tell you that this pill furnace is a garbage furnace that cannot be used to refine pills. In other words, your one hundred drops of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva were wasted.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Hearing that, Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang’s expressions changed.

“It’s fine. In any case, it wasn’t my money.” Long Chen smiled and reached out to touch the pill furnace.

As soon as he touched it, a majestic medicinal energy poured into his body. It was even stronger than he had expected.

However, when he reached toward the lid, he was startled. He wasn’t able to move it. Could the furnace not be opened?

“Hahaha, now do you understand? There’s no way to open the pill furnace. It possesses its own locking runes, and without understanding how to open it, it’s just a decoration. As for the name, the Star Refining Furnace, it’s something I came up with. Who knows where this stupid furnace came from? An unopenable furnace actually got me one hundred drops of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. Just thinking about it makes me laugh.” Zhao Wuji was incredibly pleased.

“If you didn’t know its origins, how could you take it out to sell? Zhao Wuji, you’re incredibly shameless,” said Beitang Rushuang frostily.

“Shameless? How am I shameless? I simply brought out my treasure to sell, and I didn’t make anyone buy it. For an idiot to buy it without understanding it, it can only be said that he’s blind. He killed disciples of my Mechanism Sect, so this is just the first step of my retribution,” said Zhao Wuji indifferently.

Only then did Long Chen understand why Zhao Wuji felt such hostility toward him. So he was actually from the Mechanism Sect.

One of the people Long Chen had killed was from the Mechanism Sect, and he had detonated his Yuan Spirit in order to send word back to the Mechanism Sect. Hence, Zhao Wuji definitely knew what had happened.

“What? Are your people allowed to kill others, but others aren’t allowed to kill them?” demanded Long Chen.

“Long Chen, don’t try to act innocent. Someone stole my Mechanism Sect’s flying boat, and you were nearby. For the disciples present to feel suspicious of you is only natural. If you had simply revealed your identity, everyone could have properly discussed it and avoided a confrontation. But you, Long Chen, like to bully others, and hiding who you were, you killed those disciples. You’ve offended the dignity of the Mechanism Sect, and you’ll have to pay a painful price.”

“Idiot.”

Long Chen spat out a single word in response, making Zhao Wuji’s expression turn even colder. He began to walk closer to Long Chen.
