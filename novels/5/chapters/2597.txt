Chapter 2586 How Do You Want to Die?

An ear-piercing explosion shook the void. Divine runes filled the sky.

“What?!”

When the runes exploded, they revealed two figures and a giant hole in the ground. The Blood race’s Sovereign sprout’s spear was stopped at Guo Ran’s chest, while Guo Ran was simply standing there. The spear was unable to pierce through him.

“He blocked it just like that?”

People’s heads were blank. That was a full-power attack from a Sovereign sprout but had been stopped just like that. For a moment, people could only stand there in dumbfounded silence. The only thing still moving was the whirling dust.

The Sovereign sprout of the Blood race was also stunned. He couldn’t believe his own eyes.

The head of a strange creature had appeared on Guo Ran’s chest, protecting him. Its mouth was open almost as if in a silent sneer.

If Long Chen was present, he would instantly recognize it as the door knocker they had taken from the Netherworld. Guo Ran had made it part of his armor, using some special runes to draw out its potential. It was capable of receiving an all-out attack from a Sovereign sprout.

Other than feeling a bit uncomfortable on his chest, this attack didn’t cause him any damage. The painful feeling quickly vanished.

Guo Ran almost cried out in excitement. This new armor was so powerful that endless possibilities were now whirring about within his head. The main factor in his new power was actually his strengthened physical body.

Long Chen’s con had given him a much stronger physical body. Without the strengthening, this attack would have inflicted some wounds, most likely making him cough up blood. But since he would be in his armor, no one would see that, so he would still appear badass. However, his new physical body was so powerful that with the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, he was able to easily receive the attack of a Sovereign sprout.

“This is all the power you have? The Blood race really is foolish,” said Guo Ran disdainfully. It was as if the Sovereign sprout before him was nothing.

All of a sudden, the tip of the spear began to crack, and then it shattered. That sound was exceptionally heavy in people’s ears.

“Isn’t this crazy? Long Chen sliced apart his spear with a saber, and now his new one is silently shattered by Guo Ran without him even moving.” The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts’ jaws dropped.

“Scram!”

Suddenly, Guo Ran’s hand swung out. The Sovereign sprout raised the shaft of his spear to block, only for it to break apart as well.

“The difference is too great compared to boss. If he was the one doing it, this slap would have definitely struck his face.” Guo Ran sighed inside. Even if Guo Ran managed to imitate all of Long Chen’s movements, his divine face-slapping art simply wasn’t able to reach the same level. He was unable to stroke his opponent’s face.

However, it was good enough. Shattering his weapon and sending him flying also made this slap a very domineering one.

“When did Guo Ran get so powerful?” wondered Li Qi.

“His physical strength has reached above the average of the Dragonblood warriors. With his armor multiplying his power by dozens of times, maybe even a hundred times, it becomes this powerful,” said Gu Yang.

Originally, Guo Ran’s power was at the bottom of the Dragonblood Legion, and by a large margin at that. Now it was like a sparrow had transformed into a phoenix. Even they were forced to envy him.

More and more of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were congregating, and most of them belonged to powers that were part of the Martial Heaven Alliance. There were no longer neutral powers. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As for the Dragonblood Legion, they were the soul of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Hence, as the general of the Dragonblood Legion, everyone naturally knew who Guo Ran was. Seeing him so easily force back a Sovereign sprout, they felt new confidence in the Martial Heaven Alliance. His display was arrogant and tyrannical, so their blood was heating up just by watching.

The Sovereign sprout felt a mix of anger and shock. Just one of Long Chen’s subordinates was actually this powerful? He trembled with rage.

“Bastard, you’re intolerable!” Suddenly, the Sovereign sprout went crazy. He spread his arms, and black clouds condensed within the Yin Yang World.

“Not good!”

The Blood race experts in the Yin Yang World immediately began to cry out when they saw those black clouds.

“You can’t! The damage to your bloodline-!”

“Shut up!” The Sovereign sprout roared furiously. His eyes were scarlet as if he was bedeviled. “You ants have no idea just how powerful the Blood race is. The aura of the Yin Yang World has yet to fully spread into this place, so my bloodline power is suppressed by the vile aura of the Martial Heaven Continent. Did you really think that the Blood race only had this little bit of ability? You’re wrong! Whether it’s Long Chen or you, you’re all trash unfit to challenge me! I’ll show you our true power without the suppression of your laws!”

A blood-colored rune appeared on the Sovereign sprout’s forehead. At this moment, black clouds were spreading out of the Yin Yang World and into the Martial Heaven Continent.

“He’s drawing in the power of their world to the battlefield! The Martial Heaven Continent’s laws are being stripped away. Have Guo Ran retreat!” shouted an elder at Gu Yang.

The aura of the Yin Yang World filled the battlefield, and the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent were being forced back.

“No need to worry. Guo Ran is a person who slays devils and demons, someone who plucks the stars and moon. Other than boss Long Chen, he won’t lose to anyone else. Hehe, this minor matter is nothing to him. You just need to watch the fun,” said Gu Yang.

Suppressing the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent might gravely affect others, but Guo Ran relied on his armor. As long as he could still summon his manifestation, he was completely unaffected by such a thing. He didn’t rely on magical arts.

Furthermore, the Dragonblood warriors’ manifestations were different from ordinary Empyreans. Their manifestations didn’t rely so much on Heavenly Dao energy as others.

“Ha, haha, hahaha, I swept through the four seas and crossed a thousand mountains, what kind of devil haven’t I seen? What demon haven’t I killed? If this is your trump card, then fine, I won’t attack or interrupt you. Go ahead. I will defeat you in your strongest state to allow the Blood race to see just how great the difference between us is. I’ll show you how inferior you are compared to the mighty human race,” sneered Guo Ran. Just like that, he stood there with his arms clasped behind him, waiting for his opponent to accumulate energy.

Gu Yang and the others had some cold sweat on them, but that was from embarrassment. They exchanged a glance and shook their heads. The way that Guo Ran was talking about himself, it was like he thought himself a Sovereign.

However, the more arrogant Guo Ran was, the more excited the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were. Their hatred for the invaders was boundless. In the past, the invaders had caused repeated harm to the continent, killing countless experts.

Their ancestors had used their own lives to protect them, and the Sovereigns had led generation after generation to repel the invaders. It was the Martial Heaven Continent that was always the victim. The experts of the Martial Heaven Continent both hated and feared these invaders. Hence, Guo Ran’s domineering display made them cheer in satisfaction.

“Boss Guo Ran is mighty!”

“Boss Guo Ran is domineering!”

“Boss Guo Ran, we support you!”

“Wipe out these invaders! Eat their flesh and drink their blood as vengeance for our ancestors!”

The disciples were starting to grow too impassioned, to the point that their elders sternly warned them not to get any closer, worried that they would get impetuous and charge onto the battlefield. It was all too easy for someone to get muddleheaded in this fervor.

Guo Ran continued to stand there and look up at the void. Under his armor, he had an expression that was almost like crying.

“This feeling is so good. Everyone’s looking at me. Today, I’m the main character of this world. All their cheers are for me…” Guo Ran almost had an urge to let out a maniacal roar. This was the grandest moment of his life.

Just at this moment, black clouds finished covering the battlefield, and the Sovereign sprout was covered in flickering runes. After that, his berserk power caused cracks to appear in the void as if it would explode.

Seeing such a phenomenon, the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts tensed. Even their cheers dwindled.

The Sovereign sprout extended a hand, making heaven and earth shudder. Black energy then condensed into a spear in his hand, and an invisible pressure locked onto Guo Ran.

“Speak, how do you want to die?” The Sovereign sprout’s pupils had turned vertical. They were like the eyes of a viper, and icy killing intent flowed out of him.
