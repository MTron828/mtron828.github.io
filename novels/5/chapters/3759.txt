Chapter 3748 Powerful Huo Linger

A figure was forcibly dragged out of the city by Long Chen. The immense power directly blasted apart many buildings.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This figure roared furiously. When his snake bone whip lit up, Long Chen felt that it suddenly grew slippery. A soft, greasy energy came out of it. It was like he was holding onto a mud fish, and it slipped out of his grasp.

The whip easily escaped Long Chen’s grasp. This was Long Chen’s first time encountering such a greasy energy.

The master of the whip appeared. It was a tall and slim man with long hair and a gloomy expression. He also had two horns.

“The drake race?” Long Chen instantly recognized his identity.

This long-haired man looked at Long Chen greedily. He then suddenly raised his head and roared. His manifestation burst into existence behind him, and scales covered his entire body. A giant drake appeared in his manifestation.

His Blood Qi instantly ignited. He swung his snake bone whip, and it actually pierced toward Long Chen like a sword.

“Your true dragon essence blood is mine!”

Hearing this, Long Chen snorted. Just as he raised the Minghong Saber, he heard Huo Linger.

“Big brother Long Chen, leave him to me.”

A cute figure appeared in front of Long Chen. As soon as Huo Linger appeared, this world was filled with a terrifying heat. It was like everyone had fallen into a sea of fire.

What Long Chen hadn’t expected was for Huo Linger to actually be wearing a white dress. It was the same thing that Bing Po wore.

As soon as she appeared, she slashed the True Fire Sword at the snake bone whip.

BOOM!

The whip quivered and a layer of frost covered it. The frost rapidly spread until it reached the drake expert.

Seeing this scene, that expert was shocked. He repeatedly shook his arm, unleashing his Supreme Blood to shake off the frost.

However, he was shocked to find that it was impossible to shake it off. Most terrifying of all, the frost was burning. The more he shook it, the more intensely the flames burned. His Supreme Blood actually became its fuel. He had never seen such a terrifying flame before.

Just as the frost was about to cover his hand, he roared and let go of the whip. A blood-colored ray of light then shot out of his mouth at Huo Linger.

That light was like a viper spitting out its poison. Just looking at it gave people ominous chills. They instinctively fled even further away, as they sensed a mortal danger from it.

“Drake poison?”

Long Chen was a bit surprised. Even he retreated. He didn’t want to get touched by that.

A drake was not a true dragon. It still retained the snake’s fangs and poison. That was one of its life-protecting trump cards. Many of the powerful drakes in this world relied on this poison to threaten others. It was a powerful threat that drove off enemies.

BOOM!

In the face of that attack, Huo Linger simply swung the True Fire Sword. A layer of ice covered the True Fire Sword as it struck the blood-colored light.

As a result, blood mist filled the air. This mist burned before transforming into black smoke.

“Even the mist is toxic!”

People hastily retreated even further. The black smoke spread, corroding a hole in the void. Some drops sprayed to the ground, leaving holes in the ground and buildings.

Long Chen was shocked inside. This drake’s poison was truly terrifying. Fortunately, when he grabbed his whip, he covered his hand in dragon scales. Otherwise, it would be troublesome for his hand to be poisoned.

Bang!

Suddenly, a sound made everyone jump. Huo Linger had shattered the blood-colored light with a slash of her sword and then grabbed the whip. She then attacked the drake with his own weapon.

However, Huo Linger had never used such a weapon. Her fierce swing caused the whip to swing through the air and cause an explosion above her head. Huo Linger almost hit herself. She jumped and hastily tossed the whip to Long Chen.

Long Chen had just grabbed it when he found that the frost on top of it was gone, and it once more grew slick. Long Chen knew that the drake was trying to control it. However, Long Chen didn’t give him that chance and directly tossed it into the primal chaos space.

The drake coughed up blood once the whip entered the primal chaos space. He roared. That was his innate life weapon. When he lost his connection to it, a part of his soul was essentially ripped away.

He was shocked and enraged. This injury meant that he could no longer keep fighting.

“You inferior human, just wait!”

The drake roared and turned to flee.

“Ice Soul Phantom.”

Huo Linger snorted and her body swayed. A figure flew out of her body.

That figure had just appeared when a sword appeared beside the drake and cut him in two.

After that, the phantom returned and merged back into Huo Linger. People barely saw a blur. Even Long Chen didn’t know what Huo Linger had done.

A giant drake thumped to the ground in two pieces. Even his Yuan Spirit was destroyed by this attack.

His corpse caused dust to rise into the air. Countless people looked from the corpse to Long Chen. Many of them were already starting to flee.

Long Chen waved his hand. Those two pieces of the corpse then flew into the air. He solemnly said, “You’re an expert worthy of respect. I won’t let your corpse rot in the wild.”

After saying that, he righteously tossed it into the primal chaos space’s black soil. It instantly devoured it and unleashed a shocking amount of life energy. Just as Long Chen had estimated, this corpse was very valuable.

At the same time, a scarlet fruit appeared on his Heavenly Dao Tree. He had another Supreme fruit.

Long Chen then stood in the air and looked down on the entire city. Seeing countless experts of various races hiding in the dark, he sneered.

“Other races bully the weak and cower from the strong. But the scum of the human race only knows how to bully people of the same race. You people will be the first to betray the human race in the battle against other races. Fools. Don’t run into me again, or I’ll kill you,” warned Long Chen darkly.

After saying that, he pulled Huo Linger back into the primal chaos space, and in front of countless gazes, walked onto the transportation formation.

Long Chen’s vision then changed. He saw a sea of people around him. However, before he even had a clear view of everything, a fuming voice rang out.

“Long Chen, let’s see where you will run now!”
