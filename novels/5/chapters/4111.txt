Chapter 4100 Test

Previously, the race leader had stated that he looked down on the likes of the human race’s scheming.

At the time, Long Chen had been irritated with his statement, but thinking about it, compared to other races, the human race really did fight and scheme amongst themselves the most, so there was no room for him to argue.

However, now these people were actually doing the same to Xu Changchuan, and they even did it so sanctimoniously as if they had the moral high ground. Long Chen laughed at the hypocrisy. Covered in fur, they insulted others for being furry?

“Boss, they didn’t mix right and wrong, but directly flipped black and white. They’re allowed to use shameless schemes, but if others were to ask for aid, well, that would be completely disgraceful! Even the human race would have to admit our inferiority in this regard,” added Guo Ran delightedly.

The race leader’s expression sank, as this slap in the face was truly resounding.

His expression was quite frightening now. He had secretly told his people to keep this matter to themselves in front of outsiders like them. This matter was supposed to be dealt with after Long Chen and the others left.

However, it seemed that they couldn’t give up the chance to kill Xu Changchuan here, so they disregarded his order.

“The internal affairs of my Fullmoon race aren’t for a brat like you to interfere with!” roared a Heaven Venerate.

Long Chen curled his lips. “Who would want to get involved in your family’s stupid affairs? I’m just responding to the race leader. But from one corner of the picture, the whole scene is revealed. It seems that the Fullmoon race is only on this level. To be able to so shamelessly flip right and wrong, it seems that there is no way to get any reciprocation for my favor. Well, I don’t wish to participate in your family’s affairs. Brother Changchuan, we came from the same sect at least, and it doesn’t take much effort to send you here, so don’t mind it. Let us meet again.”

Long Chen stood up to leave. Xu Changchuan couldn’t help standing as well and angrily said, “Brother Long, you can’t leave like this. Then wouldn’t I, Xu Changchuan, become a petty little person whose word counts for nothing?”

Xu Changchuan suddenly knelt to the race leader and announced, “Race leader, if you truly think that I have lost the dignity of the family, then I have no words. I have no other strong points, but my word has always been golden. After I promise someone something, I always do it. If I can’t do it, then this life should simply be given to brother Long.”

“You… you dare to threaten the leader?! This is a revolt!” roared a Heaven Venerate. But while he appeared angry, he was actually quite delighted by this turn of events.

As for Long Chen, he also hadn’t expected the seemingly weak Xu Changchuan to have such a tough spine. He dared to say such a thing to the race leader? Before this, Long Chen didn’t know that he was such a man.

With just that one move, Long Chen felt that this trip had been worth it. As for whether he could get anything out of it, he didn’t really care.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Then are you not afraid of me executing you?!” raged the race leader.

“You taught me that if a person’s word is not solid, they can have no solid place in the world. In the Fullmoon race, our words must be kept. This time, I was willing to pay any price to return home, not because I coveted the position of race leader, but because I couldn’t allow the position of leader of our race to fall into the hands of such schemers. If they were to succeed your position, then with their treachery and shamelessness, the Fullmoon race will only be brought to destruction. Then I, Xu Changchuan, would go down as a failure condemned by history. If my competitors truly surpass me in talent and character, then I won’t even ask to compete for this position! I would rather return to my free days of wandering the world. You said that everything is for our race, then why would I be afraid of dying for our race? Kill me if you wish, but I can openly tell you that there is not one person amongst my competitors who can become the race leader!” cried out Xu Changchuan.

Several Heaven Venerates sneered delightedly when they heard Xu Changchuan’s emotional plea. They knew that their leader hated the arrogance of youth the most. After all, Xu Changchuan’s words were truly quite arrogant. It was like without him, the Fullmoon race would be doomed. This kind of speech would only enrage the race leader.

“You lack respect for your superiors! If you want to die, then you can die!”

Suddenly, the race leader slammed a palm at Xu Changchuan’s head, causing everyone to jump. This was too sudden.

After that, the sound of a blade coming out of its sheath rang out, accompanied by a burst of divine light. Long Chen swiftly launched an attack on the race leader.

“Courting death!”

The Fullmoon race’s experts were enraged to see someone attack their leader, so all of them took out their weapons.

BOOM!

Uncle Tree manifested his true body, while the Dragonblood warriors summoned the Dragon Blood Battle Armor and unsheathed their weapons, a sign that a great battle was about to erupt.

Long Chen’s saber wasn’t wielded defensively. After all, he could only save Xu Changchuan by attacking the race leader and forcing him to pull back his killing blow. Although Long Chen’s relationship with Xu Changchuan wasn’t deep, he respected the latter as a man, so he wouldn’t allow Xu Changchuan to die because of being implicated by him.

However, when Long Chen’s saber was about to reach the race leader, the race leader’s hand suddenly changed direction. He lightly pressed two fingers around the Minghong Saber.

In an instant, Long Chen sensed his Blood Qi churn within, a formidable force nearly forcing him to cough up blood. The might of this Fullmoon race leader was utterly immeasurable.

Shocked, Long Chen was about to summon the Dragon King Battle Armor, but the race leader let go, a touch of astonishment appearing on his face. After that, the overwhelming power vanished.

“Stop!”

When the race leader shouted, all the Fullmoon experts paused their attacks.

The race leader’s expression was originally dark, but now he smiled, looking at Xu Changchuan and then Long Chen before nodding.

“Not bad.”

Long Chen was startled, suddenly realizing the race leader’s intention. Not saying anything, he simply sheathed the Minghong Saber and returned to his seat.

Just now, he had instinctively moved to save Xu Changchuan. Now that he thought back to that moment, he knew that the race leader had no intention of killing Xu Changchuan. His goal was to test Long Chen.

Xu Changchaun’s reaction was much slower in comparison. He had already closed his eyes and accepted his death, so now, he was lost.

“Starting today, you are true friends of my Fullmoon race,” said the race leader, looking at Long Chen and the others.

Those experts who had been delighted twitched. Many of them didn’t understand what he was saying.

“Good child. It seems that I didn’t teach you for nothing. Go stand over there for now.” The race leader patted Xu Changchuan’s shoulder.

Xu Changchuan was still stunned. Just being patted on the shoulder by the leader of his race was probably the greatest achievement of his life.

After he blankly walked to the side, the race leader’s expression suddenly changed. His smile was gone and sharp killing intent replaced it.

“There are no outsiders here now. Let us probably settle any debts! Ancestral spirit totem!”

All the experts who had howled for Xu Changchuan’s death instantly became terrified, their bodies quaking where they stood.
