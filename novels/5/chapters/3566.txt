Chapter 3555

Seeing Yu Qingxuan flying over, those two elders were delighted. They hastily caught her and brought her flying away from the battlefield.

“No! I don’t want to leave Long Chen! Elders, please save Long Chen!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As Yu Qingxuan was dragged away, her tears overflowed. She saw Long Chen be drowned by countless experts.

Those two elders exchanged a glance, both seeing the other’s profound powerlessness. They had to protect Yu Qingxuan at all costs. As for saving Long Chen, the two of them were completely unable to do so.

The valley master of the Magnificent Cliff Valley was currently reclaiming the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net. Just as he was about to erase Long Chen’s spiritual seal, black smoke suddenly came out of the net, wracking his soul with sharp pain.

Just as his mind went blank, the Minghong Saber stabbed through his head from a strange angle. The valley master didn’t even get a chance to grunt before being killed.

The Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net then appeared in Long Chen’s hands. It was quivering, crying out as if wailing, yet also as if it was pleading for mercy.

“I dislike traitors the most. The spiritual mark that I placed on you isn’t an absolute slave mark, but you didn’t recognize this kindness and decided to betray me. As expected, mercy to your enemy is cruelty to yourself. Fine, since you want to die, you can die.”

Long Chen expressionlessly flung it out. The next moment, the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net instantly stretched to its maximum size, covering everyone attacking him, including Zhao Mingxuan and the others.

“Not good!”

Killing the elder, reclaiming the net, flinging it out, all these occurred in an instant. Long Chen didn’t give them any chance to react.

Zhao Mingxuan and the others were charging over crazily. When the net was thrown out, they flew straight into it. Zhao Mingxuan and the others appeared as though they had taken the initiative to simply fling themselves into the net.

By the time they reacted, they were all caught. Tens of thousands of experts were contained within this net.

“Break out of this together-!” shouted Zhao Mingxuan.

“Explode!”

Before they could even wave their weapons, Long Chen’s cry rang out and the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net exploded. All its threads crumbled, with a single strand remaining. It quickly pierced through the air.

This thread was the main thread of the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, and it was the only one that came from a Divine Venerate Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silkworm. It whipped through the air, emitting a sharp sound.

At the same time as the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net exploded, space was compressed. Zhao Mingxuan and the others were squeezed from all sides. As for that single surviving thread, it whipped through this space like a bomb, cutting them in two.

BOOM!

This silk that came from a Divine Venerate Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silkworm then exploded. Even with World Domain divine items protecting them, Zhao Mingxuan and the others were unable to endure that terrifying force. Tens of thousands of experts exploded at once, and a rain of blood fell.

Long Chen lost a top grade World Domain divine item. As for Zhao Mingxuan and the others, they lost their physical bodies. The weaker experts caught in the explosion lost their souls as well.

Due to having protective World Domain divine items, Zhao Mingxuan and the others managed to keep their Yuan Spirits intact. Feeling horrified, they fled with their World Domain divine items.

“You think you can run?”

Long Chen clenched his teeth and swept out the Minghong Saber. A giant saber-image then came crashing down.

BOOM!

Dozens of World Domain divine items were sent flying. They pierced through the void, fleeing in every direction.

The World Domain divine items didn’t break. But the Yuan Spirits in control of them received such an impact that some of them directly shattered.

Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and two other powerful human experts had their Yuan Spirits covered in cracks, but they didn’t die. Their Yuan Spirits were stronger than the others.

“Long Chen!”

At this moment, countless World Kings came charging out of the crowd. They were all mid and late stage World Kings, and they had come to receive their disciples. But then, Long Chen killed tens of thousands of heavenly geniuses from various races, enraging them.

Suddenly, heaven and earth collapsed and a sun blazed, igniting the world. A giant Golden Crow appeared, one of its claws reaching toward Long Chen.

That expert of the Golden Crow race wanted to save Wu Yang, so he immediately unleashed his manifestation. This claw covered the battlefield, freezing its space. He was the fastest and his attack was the first to arrive.

Wu Yang was delighted. However, Long Chen’s black eyes contained icy killing intent, and violet qi continued to come out of him. When his aura gushed out, that frozen space instantly unfroze.

“Not good!” That expert of the Golden Crow race was shocked. His innate divine ability actually failed and was unable to lock Long Chen down. “Yang-er, run!”

Regretfully, Long Chen didn’t give him any such chance. The Minghong Saber slashed toward Wu Yang.

“No!”

Wu Yang cried out. He was completely locked down by this saber. He couldn’t flee and was powerless to resist. He could only watch as this saber ended his life.

Wu Yang’s Yuan Spirit was blasted apart. As for his World Domain divine item, at this critical moment, it abandoned him and flew toward that expert of the Golden Crow race.

Clearly, that World Domain divine item possessed a certain spirituality and knew that it couldn’t protect Wu Yang. Thus, it saved itself the effort.

“Long Chen, I’ll tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces!” The expert of the Golden Crow race unleashed a heaven-shaking roar. His killing intent exploded. Long Chen had actually killed Wu Yang right in front of him. This was an unprecedented humiliation for the Golden Crow race.

“Someone who wishes to kill me must be prepared to be killed by me. Today, I will teach you just how important it is to have respect in your heart.”

Long Chen snorted, and just as he was about to attack Zhao Mingxuan and the other two, the world suddenly quivered. All the experts within the Heavenly Flame World, regardless of cultivation base, felt their bodies shudder. An irresistible power struck them, sending them tumbling out of the exit.

BOOM!

The Heavenly Flame World’s exit slammed shut, and millions of experts were sent flying out.

The outside of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture had long since been packed with experts of various races. They were waiting for the people of their races. Since many of them weren’t flame attribute cultivators, they couldn’t enter the Heavenly Flame World, so they were stuck waiting here.

What they hadn’t expected was for the spatial gates to suddenly explode, and then countless experts came flying out in a current of flames.

This scene shocked countless people. They didn’t know what had happened. This seemed to be different from the past openings of the Heavenly Flame World.

After a moment of shock, someone cried out, “Heavens, isn’t that young master Mingxuan?! How does he only have a Yuan Spirit left?!”

BOOM!

Before they could get a clearer understanding of the situation, a saber wrapped in violet qi slashed down. As a result, Zhao Mingxuan screamed in despair as his Yuan Spirit crumbled. That scene caused countless jaws to drop.

“It’s… Long Chen!”

When they saw the attacker, cries of terror rang out…
