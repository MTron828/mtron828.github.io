Chapter 2674 Outside This World

“They should be alive,” said Long Junwu hesitantly.

“What does that mean, should be alive?!” roared Long Chen, his eyes scarlet.

When it came to his birth parents, he only remembered their voices and two pairs of warm hands. However, that short scene had allowed Long Chen to sense their love for him. He could feel his father’s expectations for him and the tenderness of his mother. To his parents, he was the heavens, the world.

Although Long Chen didn’t have children yet and so he hadn’t experienced what it meant to be a father, he knew that if anyone dared to touch his child, he would become crazy. In that state, he wouldn’t mind destroying the entire world.

He hoped that his parents were still alive. But considering that they had not communicated with him in so many years, they had to be in a bitter situation.

“Long Chen, don’t get emotional. Your father and mother have left the Martial Heaven Continent. They are in the divine world. I say ‘should’ because I also don’t know what their current situation is like,” said Long Junwu.

The divine world? People were startled. How was that possible? The path to the divine world had been severed. People from the Martial Heaven Continent were no longer able to ascend to the divine world.

“A brat still wet behind the ears also dares to say such big words? You dare to question the Lord Saint? What about the dignity of the divine families? Lord Saint, are you not indulging him too much?

Suddenly, space twisted and a woman appeared, looking icily arrogant. She wore imperial robes and had her hair tied up in an ornament. Although she looked beautiful, the innate arrogance exuding out of her gave off an extremely uncomfortable feeling.

She immediately began to target Long Chen, surprising people. Just who was she to dare say such words to the Lord Saint? Her cultivation base was merely at the late Heaven Merging realm.

“Someone from outside this world.”

Daoist Heavenly Feather’s pupils shrank. That woman’s aura was different from the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent.

Furthermore, her aura was a bit similar to Long Aotian. Daoist Heavenly Feather was sure that she was Long Aotian’s mother.

Long Junwu’s expression sank. “This place has nothing to do with you.”

“Oh? How could that be? Long Zhantian’s spawn is still alive. Back then, Long Zhantian slaughtered the Long family’s experts, causing rivers of blood to flow. Later on, the four families’ Saints were forced to take action, and only then was he suppressed. Even then, four were killed, and two were seriously injured. Only you escaped unscathed. Are you thinking of protecting Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang’s spawn due to him having mercy on you back then?” said the woman indifferently.

Gasps rang out. Long Chen was already terrifying enough, but who would have thought that his father was even more terrifying? He had actually fought against four Saints, killing four and injuring two?

“Shut up! Who do you think you are to insult my parents?!” raged Long Chen, pointing Evilmoon at her.

“Long Chen, if you dare to be disrespectful to my mother, I will kill you right now!” shouted Long Aotian.

As expected, Daoist Heavenly Feather’s guess was correct. This woman was truly Long Aotian’s mother. Long Aotian also no longer bothered hiding his killing intent toward Long Chen.

The woman suddenly laughed at Long Chen. “Oh, that appearance of a wild dog that wants to bite people is truly like your dead father. Let me tell you, your mother was a slut who very likely died upon returning to the divine world. As for your father, after committing such a grave sin, he was detained in the divine world and executed. His corpse has long since grown cold. As for you-”

“Shut your mouth!” Long Junwu shouted furiously, his voice so powerful that it caused countless people to faint.

“Lord Saint, you wish for your granddaughter-in-law to shut up, so I will naturally obey. However, what’s the point of being so loud? Is it a show of might toward my family? The Luo family has been fully offended by you. Are you planning on offending my family as well?” said Long Aotian’s mother indifferently.

“You… you… just scram.” Long Junwu shuddered from rage. He clenched his fists like he might crush her, but he didn’t. That was because her origins were extremely terrifying. Killing her might be easy, but the power behind her couldn’t be provoked.

Long Aotian’s mother knew this, which was why she was so fearless.

“You don’t need to scram. Although I don’t know the whole story, I will not permit anyone to blaspheme my parents. I don’t know why you hate my parents so much, but my style isn’t to care why. I have always believed a blood debt must be repaid with blood. The enmity between your generation actually caused you to harm a newborn baby who wasn’t even a month old, so whatever reasons or law behind that are inconsequential. My vengeance starts today. Long Aotian, you have what is mine. First, I will take it back.” Long Chen’s killing intent suddenly vanished, replaced with a frightening calmness, which made it feel like time and space had frozen.

Long Chen didn’t know about the enmities in his parents’ generation, but he didn’t care about those either. If they managed to implicate a newborn baby, it already showed all he cared to know.

The cause wasn’t important. The process wasn’t important. Right and wrong weren’t important. What was important was that Long Chen had to find justice for himself.

Heaven and earth were calm, and the five Sovereigns stood there, quietly watching. The five of them were the final wave of the heavenly tribulation.

At this moment, the dragon woman, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and Ye Ming stared in shock at Long Chen. Everything that had occurred today was unbelievable.

Long Chen actually possessed such a terrifying origin. His Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone had been taken, but he had still managed to cultivate to this level. That was heaven-defying. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Long Aotian sneered, “No wonder I’ve always found you displeasing to the eye. Fine, I’ll end you today so you can reunite with your family.”

Long Aotian’s dragon spear buzzed, and dragon roars shook the sky. As the nine dragons in his manifestation changed, a sharp pressure shot out.
