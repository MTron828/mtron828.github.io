Chapter 4830 Terrifying Martial Stage

Long Chen stared into the endless starry sky, watching the celestial bodies sway. Shooting stars occasionally streaked over the night sky, like sharp blades cutting through the dome of the heavens.

This starry sky gave Long Chen an unprecedented sense of shock. He found that this starry sky seemed to be a manifestation.

“Wait, this starry sky....” At this moment, Mo Nian also noticed something off with it.

“It is the star cloud manifestation left behind by a fallen expert in the primal chaos era. Even though the person has died long ago, the manifestation remains eternal. The starry sea’s floating clouds represent all life. As a result, this martial stage was set up here to ensure impartial supervision.” A voice rang out not too far from them. Mo Nian and the others then turned to see an icy-faced woman walking over.

“Miss Lu— Oh, sorry, you’re not her.” Mo Nian hastily waved but realized that he got the wrong person.

This woman was extremely similar to Lu Ziqiong, especially her icy expression and tone, yet their spiritual fluctuations were different.

“I am Lu Ziqiong’s little sister, Lu Ziyu. Are you the four people that my big sister mentioned?” She looked up and down Long Chen and the others, frowning slightly. She didn’t seem too friendly.

Originally, Mo Nian was about to warmly greet her, but her appearance made him feel snubbed. He indifferently said, “Miss Lu personally invited us here. Do you have something against it?”

Mo Nian intentionally put emphasis on the fact that he had been invited. It was to make his position clear. After all, he had been planning on buying the tickets himself and had no intention of taking advantage of anyone else.

Seeing this girl’s contempt, Mo Nian was somewhat irritated. Long Chen also felt a bit uncomfortable as he didn’t like owing favors, especially to strangers.

“No, I was simply wondering about what kind of individuals merit my sister's personal request for me to look after them. Come with me,” replied Lu Ziyu calmly.

Lu Ziqiong had asked Lu Ziyu to look after them, leading her to believe that they were some peerless experts. However, upon seeing them, she felt disappointed. Long Chen lacked any Doyen fluctuations, while Mo Nian’s Blood Qi was clearly deficient as he had yet to recover from his injuries.

As for Yu Tong and Yu Fei, they weren’t weak, but they hadn’t reached the level that caught Lu Ziyu’s eyes. Her innate coldness also prevented her from extending a warm welcome, especially when receiving individuals weaker than herself. Her expression didn’t look very good.

As Lu Ziyu led the way, Long Chen frowned and looked at Mo Nian, asking, “What a mess... what should I say about this?”

Lu Ziyu's expression darkened. She wanted to scold Long Chen and the others for their apparent lack of gratitude, but before she could open her mouth, Long Chen scolded her first.

“Shut your mouth. Your big sister was the one inviting us. We didn’t ask to come. If you can accept it, then hurry up and do so. If you can’t, then scram. We’re here to watch a fight, not suffer your mistreatment.”

“You...!” Lu Ziyu was enraged. However, when she looked at Long Chen’s eyes, her soul suddenly quivered. An intense sensation of danger enveloped her, causing her to shut her mouth. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s fine. Why bother quibbling with her? After all, Lu Ziqiong invited us and hasn’t offended us. If we were to leave like this, it would be too rude,” Mo Nian interjected, knowing that Long Chen was angry. Just who was Long Chen? He was the High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean in all of history, a genius with countless halos of light around him.

Although Long Chen never cared about those things, if someone treated him with such ridicule, he wouldn’t be able to accept it.

Most importantly, this was just the start. Who knew what this woman would say later on? Who could possibly tolerate that?

While Mo Nian’s temper was a bit better, he also wouldn’t let others look down on him like this. He then looked at the shocked Lu Ziyu and said, “We’ve accepted your big sister’s favor. However, you shouldn’t look down on people, or something good might turn into something bad. We also don’t expect you to treat us grandly. Just try not to talk too much, or you won’t be able to take those words back. I don’t want a falling out here.”

Mo Nian’s tone was calm, backed by a certain confidence that only supreme experts possessed. Although he was still in recovery, an injured tiger was not something that could be bullied.

Only then did Lu Ziyu realize that she might have misjudged. These seemingly unremarkable men might be exceedingly terrifying beings.

However, her pride did not permit her to lower her head. She just snorted and didn’t reply, turning around and leading the way again.

Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a knowing glance, both nodding in agreement. Meanwhile, Yu Tong and Yu Fei appeared flustered and uneasy, like startled chickens.

After all, Lu Ziyu was a nine star Heavenly Doyen, and her recent display of anger had left them intimidated. Long Chen reassured them silently, indicating that he and Mo Nian were there to handle the situation.

The four of them followed Lu Ziyu, who led the way silently until they reached a door.

Lu Ziyu pressed her tablet on a platform at the edge of the door, and Long Chen saw that it was a silver tablet. In other words, she had killed an Earth Saint devil creature alone. It was no wonder that she was so arrogant.

Long Chen and the others followed Lu Ziyu’s action, placing their tablets at the edge of the door before walking in. When Lu Ziyu saw Mo Nian’s golden tablet, despite doing her utmost to remain calm, she was unable to conceal her shock. Now, she finally understood why someone as strong as her sister would invite the four of them.

Lu Ziyu’s demeanor clearly improved after seeing that golden tablet, and she no longer acted like they owed her money. This was perhaps one of the unwritten rules of the cultivation world—respect was earned through strength.

Once they were past the door, they saw an enormous martial stage that was covered in runes. A heavy and ancient aura exuded out of it, as well as a dense murderous aura that made their blood boil.

Unexpectedly, Lu Ziyu pointed at the martial stage and said, “This stage is made of the bones of Heaven Saint devil creatures. It is incredibly tough, and it is said that Divine Venerate disciples cannot damage it in the slightest.”

“The bones of Heaven Saint devil creatures?!” Yu Tong was gobsmacked.

“Where did you think the corpse of the Heaven Saint devil creature you submitted went?” stated Lu Ziyu.

Long Chen looked at the martial stage. As expected, those bricks and pillars looked like they were made of bone. However, they were covered by a formation, which rendered them imperceptible to the naked eye.

“This is definitely the strongest martial stage I’ve ever seen,” remarked Yu Fei, his tone a mix of astonishment and admiration.

“That only shows that you lack experience. This is the strongest one? You've seen nothing yet of the world,” a voice of contempt interjected from behind them.
