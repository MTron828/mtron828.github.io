Chapter 3686 Entering the Primal Chaos Space

The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree suddenly vanished from Long Chen’s hands and appeared above his head. Furthermore, his seven-color divine ring automatically appeared.

Long Chen’s seven-color divine ring was illuminated by the seven-colored light from the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. In the end, they slowly merged into one, and the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree appeared at the core of the divine ring.

However, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree was so small that it was barely visible after merging with the divine ring. It then grew smaller until it finally vanished.

After that, Long Chen’s primal chaos space quivered. The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree somehow appeared within the primal chaos space.

The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree then took root in the soil. It was originally only three inches tall, but it began to rapidly grow and became over a foot tall. The leaves also grew lusher. But after reaching a height of three feet, it stopped growing.

With a thought, Long Chen tossed the devil beast corpses he had gained from the Alldevil Star-Field into the black soil.

Last time, Long Chen had simply stored the devil beast corpses because the Wood Foundation Divine Trees had grown to their limit. They were no longer growing. Furthermore, the Devil Eye Water Lilies were also no longer growing past the fifth rank. Thus, he decided to simply store the extra corpses.

When the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree entered the primal chaos space, it was like a whale sucking in water, absorbing all the excess life energy. However, the primal chaos space had its own rules and would not permit a single plant to absorb the life energy of others for itself.

Thus, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree exhausted all the excess life energy within the primal chaos space in order to grow to three feet tall. After that, there was no longer enough life energy to promote its growth.

Long Chen then tossed mountain-sized corpses into the black soil, and endless life energy filled the primal chaos space. The Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree began to grow once more. However, there were so many corpses that it would take days for the black soil to devour them all.

“So junior brother was the person I was waiting for. This Seven Color Qilin Tree has finally found its master. I have accomplished the mission that the Tea Saint gave me.”

When the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree entered Long Chen’s hands, it was just like a divine weapon recognizing a master. That startling phenomenon gratified the patriarch.

As for the other experts, they were also moved. Just how were they supposed to explain what had just happened? Even the Wine God Palace’s experts were dumbfounded.

Only the High Priest had a trace of comprehension in his eyes. He slowly raised his wine cup and drank, a profound smile appearing on his face.

Hearing the patriarch’s words, Long Chen also felt it to be inconceivable. Had the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree really found its destined person? Was that person really him? That was all too unbelievable, no?

“Thank you, old brother!”

This treasure that the patriarch had kept for hundreds of thousands of years had been given to Long Chen. For Long Chen to call him brother was only right.

“The complete Tea Scripture is in the High Firmament Academy. Old brother, you can send a disciple to their main academy in Darklight Heaven to obtain a copy of it,” said Long Chen.

“The High Firmament Academy? As expected of the number one academy of the nine heavens and ten lands, its reputation is well earned. However, I have no relationship with the High Firmament Academy. They probably won’t let me make a copy of it…” said the patriarch.

“Hahaha, you don’t know? My boss is the dean of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch. If you go to the High Firmament Academy, you only need to report my boss’s name and no one will stop you from copying it.” Guo Ran laughed.

“So junior brother is a dean of the High Firmament Academy! I’ve been rude.” The patriarch jumped in shock.

“In truth, even without my permission, if you went to the High Firmament Academy with a clear and sincere heart, the dean would probably let you study the complete Tea Scripture. The High Firmament Academy is not like an ordinary sect. Our library is open to the entire world. As long as you come in goodwill, we will not disappoint you,” said Long Chen with a smile.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“So that’s the case. Many thanks, dean Long Chen!” Now that Guo Ran had reported Long Chen’s status, the patriarch no longer dared to call him brother. He directly called him dean.

“You fools, shouldn’t you hurry up and apologize to dean Long Chen?! You’ve offended dean Long Chen, and you want to act like you didn’t do anything?” The patriarch suddenly turned to scold his disciples.

Qing Yu and the others scratched their heads. He was clearly the one who had brought them to challenge the Wine God Palace, but he was scolding them for his actions now?

However, since he was their patriarch, they didn’t quibble. They thickened their faces and cupped their fists to Long Chen.

“Sorry, dean Long Chen…”

The patriarch suddenly kicked their knees, forcing them to kneel. He barked, “Is the name dean Long Chen something that the likes of you can just say? He is brothers with your patriarch. You don’t even know how to treat others with the proper seniority? What have I taught you?”

Qing Yu and the others were forced to kneel, all of them feeling aggrieved to the point of wanting to cry. Long Chen looked even younger than them, but their patriarch actually wanted them to view Long Chen as someone of the same seniority as him. Furthermore, it was to be done in front of everyone.

“Senior, junior knows his wrong. Our eyes were unable to see Mt. Tai. I hope you won’t hold a grudge against this little person. Starting today, we will turn over a new leaf and repent for our sins… we will be new people…” Qing Yu’s voice even contained a sobbing tone. This poor child felt wronged, but there was nowhere for him to vent his feelings.

Long Chen laughed inside. This patriarch of the Tea Divine School really was a fool. He forced his disciples to carry the burden of his own wrongs instead of assuming them himself. But Qing Yu and the others could only suffer in silence.

“Rise!”

Long Chen waved his hand, and an invisible force lifted Qing Yu and the others up. Seeing Qing Yu’s bitter expression, Long Chen suddenly felt this dislikable fellow to be quite pitiful.

“I feel bad to have you suffer so much during our first meeting. You are decent in other areas, but your Spiritual Strength is lacking a bit. This is a Nine Revolution Soul Nourishing Pill. You can have it.” Long Chen gave Qing Yu a medicinal pill.

Qing Yu originally thought that Long Chen was just randomly waving him off, but when he received the pill, he saw that it was actually a treasure pill. Many cultivators would never even see a treasure pill in their lifetimes.

“This is… many thanks, senior! Many thanks, grand-senior!”

Qing Yu was shocked and delighted. This pill was precisely what he needed. He naturally knew his own situation. This pill could make his Spiritual Strength, which naturally lagged behind his other areas, go through a complete transformation. He then received the pill with both hands and kowtowed to Long Chen. This time, he did it completely willingly.

Seeing this, Guo Ran and Xia Chen also felt bad. Guo Ran then gave Qing Yu an elaborate hand crossbow, while Xia Chen gave him a life-protecting talisman. Hence, Qing Yu was overwhelmed with favor. As for the other disciples, they were all envious.

“Many thanks, dean Long Chen. There is still another matter that I need your help with. Can dean Long Chen help me answer this question?” asked the patriarch sincerely.
