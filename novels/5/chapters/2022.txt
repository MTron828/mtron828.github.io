When Long Chen said this, Qi Fengxue’s expression completely changed. She also understood and was filled with fury.

“Despicable!” she shouted at the elder.

This was clearly a trap targeted for Long Chen. Because Long Chen knew Qi Xuan, who was like a child, he definitely wouldn’t let her be taken advantage of by such a pervert. The fact that Long Chen hadn’t killed him was already great restraint. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If it was Man Batian, considering his own perverted tendencies, he would have only watched with a smile. He definitely wouldn’t have saved her.

As a result, Long Chen’s identity was completely exposed. Pill Valley had actually used her little sister to test Long Chen. This was an absolute humiliation to Qi Fengxue.

“This enmity will be remembered by the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle! Pill Valley, well done!” Qi Fengxue shuddered with rage and killing intent.

As for Qi Xuan, she still didn’t understand what had happened or why her big sister was so angry.

“Miss Fengxue, don’t listen to Long Chen’s nonsense. He is merely trying to sow dissension-” said the elder indifferently.

“Who do you think Long Chen is? Would he care about sowing dissension between us? Not everyone is as despicable as Pill Valley. The Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle is retreating from the Brahma secret realm! Although we might not be some heaven-shaking power, we won’t allow ourselves to be humiliated like this.” Following Qi Fengxue’s words, thirty-some disciples came to stand by her. Those disciples of the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle all had furious expressions. Pill Valley had gone too far this time.

Qi Xuan was actually extremely talented at cultivation, but when it came to her soul, she had an innate deficiency, limiting her intelligence. They viewed her as a child and doted on her. For Pill Valley to do something like this to a handicapped person?

“Hmph, inverting right and wrong. It was just a test, and it drew out this devil, Long Chen. What’s wrong with it? You can’t even sacrifice this much? It’s not like your little sister actually lost her-”

One of the ancient race experts had opened his mouth only for Long Chen to send a lightning arrow through his head before he finished speaking. He collapsed, dead.

“If you want to help a dog eat shit, I won’t oppose you. But you should take note of the setting. When my mood’s not good, I might just end up taking your life if you don’t eat it properly,” said Long Chen indifferently.

That attack was so quick that no one could react to it. There wasn’t the slightest warning or killing intent. A powerful Empyrean was slain with just a wave of Long Chen’s hand, causing the other experts to retreat even further.

“Big brother Long Chen, thank you!” Qi Xuan suddenly ran over to Long Chen’s side.

“What are you thanking me for? This matter was my fault. I’m the one who implicated you. I’m sorry.” Long Chen tenderly rubbed Qi Xuan’s head, comforting her like a big brother.

“Big brother, you...” Qi Xuan was about to speak, but she was interrupted when a gentle force came from Long Chen’s hand, sending her back to Qi Fengxue. Now wasn’t the time for them to speak.

He turned back to the elder of Pill Valley. “Where is Yu Xiaoyun? Why hasn’t he come?”

“You think a little Life Star disciple like you is worth disturbing the valley master? People say you’re smart, but in my eyes, you’re only at this level,” sneered the elder. “At the very least, you’ve made three fatal mistakes.”

“Oh? So many? Then I want to hear what they are,” said Long Chen with some faint interest.

“Alright then. In any case, you can’t run, and I’m in no rush. First and most obvious mistake, you shouldn’t have come to Pill Valley. I suppose I can tell you the truth. When we recorded your spiritual fluctuations, our main goal was to find your location. Since Heavenly Fate Island is gone, it’s very difficult to confirm your position. So we were making long-distance sensing tools to find you based on your spiritual fluctuations. These tools aren’t complete yet, but when you arrived here, they suddenly sensed you. We actually thought that they were mistaken, but over a hundred of them sensed your spiritual fluctuations at once, so we were sure you had truly come.”

Long Chen nodded. “I was truly careless, I admit to that. However, the reason you’re trying to sense my position probably isn’t limited to just that!”

Long Chen looked closely at the elder’s expression. As expected, there was a trace of shock that was quickly covered up. From that, Long Chen was sure that the reason why they were making those tools wasn’t to find him but the original devil race.

They wanted to use him to find the original devil race’s lair. After all, Long Chen could walk the continent openly now, and they couldn’t touch him. There was no point in such a thing unless it was for this.

The elder didn’t directly reply. Instead, he continued, “Your second mistake was that after exposing a clue at the start, you didn’t immediately run. If you had run at that time, you would have had some chance to get away. After all, that was the outer regions and they had weaker defenses. But you missed that chance. Your third mistake was that you fully exposed yourself to save that girl. I was watching you the entire time. You clearly hesitated. That means you knew it was a trap but still decided to take the risk, throwing yourself deeper and deeper into a hole. After saving her, you should have immediately tried to flee. Then there would have been the slightest chance you could have escaped. However, you didn’t, instead continuing to stay here. But even I don’t know why you suddenly attacked Xiong Tianba. Were you worried I wouldn’t notice that you were Long Chen?”

Hearing that, people looked at Long Chen suspiciously. They were truly unable to wrap their heads around this.

“I didn’t want to either, but he simply took the initiative. When he stretched out a head bigger than a butt at me, I couldn’t control myself.” Long Chen shrugged, his expression so helpless that it made Xiong Tianba roar with fury.

Xiong Tianba had an urge to charge over right now and attack, but after learning that Man Batian was Long Chen, he didn’t dare to. Long Chen’s name was just too great.

“Long Chen, do you know why I’m in no rush to attack?” asked the elder indifferently.

Long Chen smiled and pointed at the sky. Runes were slowly forming there. “Because you are stealthily activating the grand formation. Once its barrier is condensed, then even if the entire Martial Heaven Alliance charged over, they wouldn’t be able to save me, right?”

The elder’s smile slowly vanished as he vaguely sensed something off. Long Chen seemed to know about everything. A faint sense of unease began to grow within him.

Long Chen clasped his hands behind him. Smiling at the elder, he said, “I’ve never said that I’m smart. To tell the truth, I’m not too used to using my brain to resolve problems. However, I’m also not a fool. Just because I don’t like using my head doesn’t mean that I don’t have a brain. Old fellow, your little tricks aren’t special in front of me. You don’t have the qualifications to act wise in front of me. Well, to tell the truth, with your little brains, I’d beat you with a single toe. Remember this: the goal isn’t to play with you; it’s to play you to death. Well, after saying so much, my throat’s dry. I’m going to leave first and there’s no need for you to send me off. In any case, I’ll return.”

“Leaving? Hahaha!” The elder laughed like he had heard a huge joke. “The dual divine chain formation has already been fully activated. It uses the god power of the divine statues. Let alone you, even a Netherpassage expert of the fourth step wouldn’t be able to escape from here. Do you think that you can?”

Long Chen cried in shock, “Even a Netherpassage expert of the fourth step, someone in control of Samsara energy, said to be able to reverse the cosmos and destroy heaven and earth can’t escape from here?! But... I feel that I can!”

Just as people thought that Long Chen was finally afraid, his last sentence almost made them cough up blood.

Qi Xuan, with her childish nature, almost laughed. The elder also laughed, but his was a furious laugh. “Good, then let me see just how you will leave! None of my Pill Valley’s experts even need to do anything. We’ll just watch how you fight this many of the continent’s heroes. Aren’t you claimed to be unrivaled within the same realm? Today, I’ll watch how that legend shatters!”

Leng Wufeng of the Blood Spirit Sword Sect let out a cry, his translucent sword suddenly attacking. “Long Chen, face your death!”

Long Chen sneered, “You and I have no enmity, so why do you want to kill me? When my saber cuts off your head, hopefully, you’ll remember that you provoked me first.”

Long Chen didn’t look at Leng Wufeng’s sword. He didn’t even seem to look at Leng Wufeng. He just stood there.

That icy disdain stunned everyone. Had Long Chen really reached the point where he could completely ignore Leng Wufeng?

As for Leng Wufeng, he was even further infuriated at this disdain. As his sword was about to strike Long Chen, Long Chen suddenly raised a single finger at him.

“Scram!”
