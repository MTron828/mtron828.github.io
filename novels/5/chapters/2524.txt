Chapter 2514 Soul Assimilation Reincarnation

The ball of flames that Long Chen had tossed out was the karmic hell flames from Purgatory. They ignited the altar.

Curiously, the red karmic flames actually began to burn blue after igniting the altar.

Ye Ming’s expression instantly changed. The karmic hell flames had spread to cover the entire altar. He then condensed his dark energy into a hand, and it fell on the flames to extinguish them.

However, when the hand covered the altar, Ye Ming was shocked. The hand was instantly incinerated.

Ye Ming hastily retreated, finally a bit afraid. If he hadn’t severed his connection to the hand just now, the flames would have continued and reached him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had experienced the karmic hell flames once before. They had almost taken his life back then. However, the karmic hell flames here didn’t seem to be condensed into a magical art. Despite that, he had an intense feeling of mortal danger when his hand touched them.

“What kind of flames are these?!” Ye Ming roared, unable to maintain his calm.

He had suffered the karmic hell flames twice now. The first time was when Long Chen had used them in the World Extermination Flame Lotus and heavily injured him.

This time, the feeling of danger when he had attacked them was even greater than with the flame lotus. He was unable to comprehend how Long Chen could control these flames.

“They’re called karmic hell flames, and they come from the Netherworld. As their name implies, karmic flames burn the karma contained in all things. The Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s karma was ignited, and you dared to try to extinguish them? You’re fortunate that you weren’t instantly burned to death upon touching the burning karma of the fiend king,” said Long Chen with an evil laugh.

Long Chen could not fully control the karmic hell flames, or perhaps he should say that Huo Linger was unable to fully control them. He could only let them burn where he placed them.

The karmic hell flames were something that transcended ordinary laws. It didn’t matter what kind of lifeform it was, they could not escape the burning of their karma. Not even a god could do so.

This was related to the cycle of karma. The Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s body was being burned, representing his karma being burned. Just now, Ye Ming had tried to touch that burning karma. If he hadn’t severed his connection to that hand just now, the karma would have followed and consumed him.

Ye Ming began to sweat. He had almost died to an unremarkable ball of flames.

The blue flames flickered. They weren’t intense but gave off a bizarre feeling. It was as if they could be blown out with a breath of air, but no one dared to touch them, not even Long Chen.

The karmic hell flames were just the seed, which was now attached to the Heaven Devouring Fiend King. The fuel was all the karma accumulated by it during its lifetime, so touching it would be fatal.

Although Ye Ming didn’t fully understand the true power of the karmic hell flames, he knew that if this continued, the fiend king and his four divine generals would become impossible to revive.

The little bit of life energy they were extracting from underground was unable to keep up with the burning of the karmic flames. His plans were instantly thrown awry.

Suddenly, Ye Ming tossed out a formation disc behind him. It rapidly expanded into a giant transportation formation.

The formation lit up, and one group of Corrupt experts after another appeared. Using some special means, Ye Ming was pulling in the Corrupt path’s disciples.

Long Chen didn’t know what Ye Ming was planning, but it was definitely not for the Corrupt experts to come pay their respects to him. He slashed Evilmoon at the formation disc.

“Seal the Heavens, Lock the Earth, Invert the Cosmos.”

Ye Ming was prepared, and his figure appeared in Long Chen’s path. His manifestation spread to cover the formation disc. He actually put down his jagged sword to form hand seals. His body became illusory.

Long Chen’s attack exploded in another area of Ye Ming’s black manifestation, having been displaced by this strange technique.

“What kind of damned technique is this?!” Long Chen was startled. Ye Ming truly did have many bizarre magical arts that he had never seen before.

“It’s a kind of dark divine ability. He can move your attacks elsewhere. There’s practically no way to counter it. Don’t worry though, he cannot move during this time, and the time is limited. He can only last a few more seconds before he becomes solid once more. At that time, the technique will naturally be released,” said Evilmoon.

As Evilmoon said, Ye Ming’s body gradually became solid. Long Chen attacked again.

This time, the jagged sword appeared in Ye Ming’s hand once more, and he was sent flying.

“Disciples of the Corrupt path, hear my orders! Activate the Soul Assimilation Reincarnation Grand Formation! Send your life energy into the altar to revive the fiend king!” shouted Ye Ming.

Those Corrupt experts that he had summoned still didn’t even know what was going on, but they listened to his orders. Blood-colored flowers began to appear on their foreheads.

Following the appearance of those flowers, their Blood Qi flew away, as if being summoned by the altar.

“Ye Ming is sacrificing their lives to hasten the revival of the fiend king!” warned Evilmoon.

Long Chen didn’t need Evilmoon’s warning. He could tell just by looking. Ye Ming was truly ruthless. Unable to extinguish the karmic flames, he actually began to sacrifice others. It seemed that he didn’t care about those disciples’ lives.

Over five hundred thousand Corrupt experts had been summoned by him. He had clearly arranged this in advance. Ye Ming truly had many backups prepared.

Just at that moment, divine light shot out of the altar and enveloped those disciples. It was unknown if this was something else Ye Ming had done in order to protect them before they were killed.

“Although there were some accidents, everything is still within my control. Long Chen, no matter how you struggle, you can’t beat me. I won’t bother wasting time with you either.” Ye Ming retreated into the protective light of the altar as well.

The karmic flames continued to burn despite the support of the Corrupt experts, but they were growing weaker and weaker.

Karmic hell flames could not be extinguished by external power, but Ye Ming was strengthening the fiend king’s lifeforce to suppress the karmic flames.

“Long Chen, continue burning them,” said Evilmoon.

“It’s useless. I can’t really control the karmic hell flames, and I can’t bring out their full power. I can only have them ignite the fiend king’s karma but not his actual body. Even if I try to spread more karmic hell flames, it won't stop them.” Long Chen looked around. He saw the giant tree, the endless army of the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps, and the long-tailed poison dragons. “All I can do is have these karmic flames resonate with the karmic hell flames within my body. I’ll use my Spiritual Strength as fuel. But that will cost me my ability to fight. Furthermore, by myself, my own Spiritual Strength won’t be enough to have a good effect. I’ll need the help of my friends.”

“What are you going to do?”

“I’ll send out the distress signal for everyone on my side to come help. But there are too many things in the way right now, so I’m going to help clear up the obstacles.”

Long Chen raised his hand. A flame lotus blossomed, and sacred chanting filled heaven and earth, as if gods were murmuring.

Long Chen’s body slowly rose through the air. The world turned red from the chanting, and flame runes slowly appeared in the air before flying toward Long Chen.

The flame lotus grew larger and larger. At the same time, spheres appeared on top of the petals.

When fifty-four spheres had appeared on top of the lotus, it quivered once. Every sphere dimmed slightly, and then a seventh set of nine spheres appeared.

The aura of the flame lotus instantly soared when the seventh set of spheres appeared. For the first time, Long Chen had reached the seven star World Extermination Flame Lotus.

Based on Long Chen’s previous technique, his limit was the six star World Extermination Flame Lotus. Any more and the slightest fluctuation would blow him up.

However, by relying on the Heaven Shrouding Mirror’s divination ability, he had managed to see how to disperse a portion of the first six stars to condense the seventh star.

In truth, when the seventh star was first born, the amount of energy of the lotuses was still equal to the six stars before it appeared. So this trick did not have high requirements for energy. It could be likened to climbing uphill. Before this, Long Chen was forced to reach the top in one step, but now he had a set of stairs he could climb.

It was only when his energy was slowly sent into the seventh star that the aura of the lotus soared once more. When it reached the limit, the seven stars’ energy was extracted to condense the eighth.

With this trick, everything became much easier. His six star limit was instantly broken.

When the eighth star appeared, the aura of the lotus shook the giant tree above Long Chen. Flames whirled toward him, igniting space. It was as if the entire world had been set ablaze.

“What kind of magical art is that?!”

Within the protective light, Ye Ming stared in shock at the giant flame lotus. He was finally truly terrified.

At this time, even Feng Fei, Mo Nian, Wilde, and Zhao Ritian stopped their fights to stare in shock.

All they saw was Long Chen holding a giant flame lotus. It was as if a flame god had descended to destroy the entire world.
