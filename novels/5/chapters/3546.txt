Chapter 3535

“Damn…”

That giant mouth caused the heavens to collapse and a giant vortex to appear. Fortunately, Long Chen fled quickly enough. If he had been slower, he definitely would have been devoured by that vortex.

“Five kinds of runes?”

Long Chen was shocked. No wonder it had given him such a terrifying feeling. It was a Heavenly Flame Spirit comparable to a fifth Heavenstage World King.

At this moment, a powerful suction force tore at the sky. Long Chen felt like his body would be torn apart. Fortunately, he had fled early enough, or he would be doomed.

That Heavenly Flame Spirit let out a heaven-shaking roar. It was actually a giant python. Failing to consume Long Chen in one bite, it actually swung its tail and chased after him.

“This fellow seems a bit too big. Huo Linger, I don’t think we can eat it,” said Long Chen as he eyed that python.

“It seems that we really can’t,” said Huo Linger obediently.

Even if they could catch this thing in their net, they might not be able to subdue it. If it was during a normal time, they could still try it.

However, they couldn’t in this place. Who knew whether or not geniuses of other races were lying in wait here? What if when Long Chen used up all his power subduing this terrifying existence, he was suddenly sneak attacked?

Thus, although Huo Linger wanted to devour this terrifying python, she didn’t want Long Chen to take the risk. After all, there were too many enemies here. Furthermore, in the process, they might draw even more terrifying Heavenly Flame Spirits.

The python continued to chase Long Chen, refusing to let him off. It was constantly roaring at him.

“What is it saying?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s cursing you, saying that you ate all of the food that it was raising. It says that you’re a vile interloper and must be eaten,” said Huo Linger. As a flame spirit, she could understand the words of Heavenly Flame Spirits.

“What is it cursing me for? I’m not the one who ate them! It should be cursing you!” laughed Long Chen.

Huo Linger also laughed. “Ah, that’s right, it does seem to be cursing the two of us.”

It seemed that Long Chen’s laughter provoked that python. Its killing intent soared as it continued to chase.

Lightning then appeared beneath Long Chen’s feet. His speed was faster than the python’s, but he wasn’t able to shake it off.

Long Chen was still hesitating about whether or not he wanted to take the risk to devour it anyway. After all, the greater the risk, the better the gains. If Huo Linger absorbed it, Long Chen was sure that she would be able to fight a third Heavenstage World King all by herself.

Long Chen then spread his senses far and wide and was unable to find any sense of safety. His intuition was telling him not to play with fire.

Suddenly, Long Chen spotted a group of people in the distance. Without even thinking about it, he rushed off in that direction.

He found that it was a group of over thirty humans. One of them was actually his old friend, Zhao Mingxuan.

Zhao Mingxuan and the others had surrounded a region of the lava sea, seemingly paying close attention to something. They didn’t even notice Long Chen.

“Long Chen, they’re driving the fish together to collect and annihilate them,” transmitted Huo Linger.

“Oh? There’s such a good thing?” Long Chen was surprised.

Huo Linger told Long Chen that Zhao Mingxuan and the others were using their own flame energy to drive those fish together. As they didn’t have the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, it was unknown what they were planning to do after bunching those Heavenly Flame Spirits together. But that wasn’t what Long Chen was thinking about.

“Huo Linger, tell that python that my reinforcements are here. That fellow with the crown is our leader, and now it’s definitely dead,” transmitted Long Chen.

Huo Linger immediately transformed into the form of a dragon and roared at that python. As a result, after she was done, smoke came steaming out of the python’s body and it roared back.

“What is it saying?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s cursing us,” laughed Huo Linger.

“Tell it that the crowned fellow says that he will rip out its bones, skin it, and take over its territory. He will eat all of its food.” Long Chen added some more spice into the mix. At this time, Long Chen was getting very close to Zhao Mingxuan and the others.

Only then did Zhao Mingxuan and the others notice Long Chen. When they saw his sinister smile, they instantly had a bad feeling. Then they saw that terrifying python.

Huo Linger roared a few more things at the python, and Long Chen was pleasantly surprised to find that the python’s killing intent really did slide off of him and lock onto Zhao Mingxuan.

A mountainous pressure instantly vanished from his body. Seeing Zhao Mingxuan’s shocked expression, Long Chen reacted quickly. He threw out his net and instantly captured thousands of Heavenly Flame Spirits that Zhao Mingxuan and the others had bitterly worked to bunch together.

“Thank you, brothers! Don’t feel bad, this is just the soup. I’m leaving the big piece of meat for you!”

Long Chen and Huo Linger pulled in the net and immediately fled. As for the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace’s experts, they had yet to understand what was going on before Long Chen was already far off in the distance.

“Watch out!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just as they were bewildered, Zhao Mingxuan’s startled cry broke them out of their reverie.

That python’s scales lit up. It then opened its mouth, and a giant flame sphere came out of it. After that, heaven and earth seemed to flip. The immense power made the ten thousand Daos weep.

Clearly, this python believed Huo Linger’s words and viewed this all as Zhao Mingxuan’s fault. It immediately launched its strongest killing blow.

BOOM!

The flame sphere was like a sun exploding. Huge waves erupted out of the sea, making it impossible to see anything else.

Long Chen had long since fled far away but was still flung into the distance by that terrifying qi wave.

“That fellow’s attack is really vicious!” Long Chen jumped in shock. Although he had known that it was an existence on par with a fifth Heavenstage World King, he was still stunned by this attack.

The shockwaves from tens of thousands of miles away were still able to make his qi and blood flip inside of him, almost making him cough up blood. If he was struck directly, there was no way he could keep his life.

“What a terrifying attack. Good thing that we didn’t fight it. Even with the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, we wouldn’t be able to suppress it,” said Huo Linger.

Although the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net was powerful, with Long Chen and Huo Linger’s current power, there was no way for them to draw out its full potential. At that time, they might be able to capture it inside, but it would only turn into a battle of attrition.

That terrifying attack just now was enough to prove its power. There was no way the two of them would be able to outlast it.

Furthermore, if they did encounter other geniuses who attacked them in the process, they would be doomed.

“Did Zhao Mingxuan die?” asked Huo Linger as she watched the lava waves rage.

“No. That fellow definitely has treasures. Do you see that python flying off in the other direction? Clearly, that fellow didn’t die, and it’s chasing to kill him.” Long Chen pointed out. The python’s killing intent had not diminished, so Zhao Mingxuan clearly hadn’t died.

To be able to take on such a terrifying attack without dying, that showed Long Chen that Zhao Mingxuan, Luo Zijun, and the other heavenly geniuses on their level all had terrifying trump cards. Their backgrounds were truly amazing.

“Linger, it seems that I’ll be depending on you in this Heavenly Flame World. Let’s keep going.” Long Chen saw that if he wanted to crush these people, he would need to improve Huo Linger’s power. They couldn’t waste any moment.

Long Chen and Huo Linger continued flying deeper into the Heavenly Flame World.
