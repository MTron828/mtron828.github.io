Chapter 4506 Weakness?

Just as Long Chen’s foot slammed down, the ugly man swayed once to the left and right, leaving behind a mass of afterimages, causing Long Chen’s kick to mysteriously miss its target.

Just as he was about to launch a counterattack with his flag, Long Chen’s hand viciously struck his face.

BANG!

The ugly man could dodge Long Chen’s foot but not his bizarre yet powerful face-slap. As a result, the ugly man’s head exploded.

Long Chen’s slap was unprecedentedly powerful, possessing the force to instantly crush a mountain. However, what astonished Long Chen was that even after losing the head, the ugly man’s body exhibited no signs of hesitation or pause.

His headless body still controlled the violet flag to wrap around himself, and the two vanished.

The moment he vanished, the other three clones clearly strengthened slightly. Seeing this scene, Long Chen sighed inside. Even with this kind of attack, he was unable to eliminate one of the ugly man’s clones.

The three clones that Huo Linger was blocking suddenly enveloped themselves with the violet flags as well. In an instant, their auras vanished, and they were able to ignore Huo Linger’s flame barrier.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

BOOM!

On the other side, Lei Linger engaged in a frenetic battle with the initial clone. Berserk lightning created destructive ripples, and a colossal mushroom cloud erupted, shrouding the sky.

Long Chen and Huo Linger immediately rushed over. The ugly man had recalled all of his clones, consolidating his scattered power. It was evident that he intended to kill Lei Linger.

Fortunately, Lei Linger still remembered Long Chen’s words. If she wasn’t confident in being able to eliminate her target, she had to hold back a bit, waiting to deliver a decisive blow to her target.

When the ugly man tried to kill Lei Linger, she finally had to risk it all and unleash all her power in a wild explosion.

The ugly man had long since realized that Lei Linger was a lightning spirit, not a human. However, he hadn’t expected her intelligence to be so high that she could hide her true power adeptly. Just when he believed he had unraveled her actual strength and was about to deliver a fatal strike, he realized he had just kicked an iron board.

Lei Linger’s lightning sword clashed with his weapon, triggering two powerful bursts of energy that shattered the world around them. The ugly man coughed up blood and was propelled backward.

He was shocked to realize that he had been deceived by a spiritual body. He was at a disadvantage in that clash. Furthermore, now Long Chen and Huo Linger rushed toward him.

“Not bad, but I won’t be accompanying you any longer. I’ll take your head in the pathway to the ninth heaven.”

Long Chen, Huo Linger, and Lei Linger attacked the ugly man from all sides, but with a quiver of the violet flag, the void twisted, and he vanished.

Their attacks collided with each other, leaving all three stunned as the ugly man successfully evaded their onslaught. Long Chen’s expression darkened with frustration.

“How can this be? Space was in chaos! How can he teleport?!” Lei Linger gritted her teeth. In that clash, she had clearly injured the ugly man, but the latter could still escape.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger were both depressed, especially Huo Linger. The ugly man was as slippery as a mudfish. Huo Linger wanted to fight him directly, but the latter didn’t give her the chance. Having all that power and being unable to use it made her go crazy.

“That violet flag has accumulated generations of the violet blood race’s essence blood, so it contains their divine abilities all the way back to the immemorial era. We don’t know many of them. At the very least, we know that your Ice Soul energy can restrain it. Next time, he won’t be so lucky,” comforted Long Chen.

Although that was what he said, in truth, he was also extremely unhappy. If he didn’t need to comfort them, he’d have long since started cursing.

The ugly man’s most despicable aspect was that he used the power of violet blood against descendants of the violet blood race, making Long Chen grind his teeth.

At the same time, Long Chen felt like when it came to the violet blood race’s terrifying abilities, he had only seen the tip of the iceberg. That flag had just absorbed some violet blood yet was already such a terrifying weapon. This raised the question: what kind of power did a genuine expert of the violet blood race possess?

In front of this violet flag, Long Chen’s violet blood grew agitated, disrupting his concentration. It definitely affected him.

Long Chen knew this as a result of a bloodline resonance. It gave him the urge to immediately destroy the flag and free the sealed power of the violet blood inside.

This was a weapon made specifically to use against members of the violet blood race, just like that strange sword. They both disturbed Long Chen, making him unable to bring out his full abilities against the Lifehunter experts.

“I need to learn how to seal my violet blood temporarily. Otherwise, if it gets chaotic, it will affect me.”

Long Chen couldn’t find any effective means of countering this aspect. Hence, Long Chen had to seal his violet blood, or he would always be at a disadvantage whenever he fought the Lifehunter experts.

The ugly man was far stronger than the previous expert of the Lifehunter race. The two were simply not on the same level.

Most importantly, he was even craftier and was an even greater assassin. From the start, he had not unleashed his true Doyen power. In other words, it was just a probing attack this time.

Furthermore, although the ugly man was at a disadvantage against Lei Linger, it didn’t really affect him in the end.

His injuries were minor, and instead of utilizing Heavenly Dao energy for healing, he opted to flee. This demonstrated his prudence and marked him as the epitome of an assassin.

He was unfathomably powerful and skilled, not letting anyone grasp his weaknesses—definitely a source of frustration for Long Chen.

From the start of his attack until his retreat, he had not admitted that he was the Heavenly Province’s number one expert, Ying Tian. This aimed to intentionally apply psychological pressure on Long Chen.

Despite this, Long Chen was sure that the ugly man was the Heavenly Province’s number one expert. His certainty stemmed from his intuition as a peak expert. However, the ugly man’s Doyen level remained a mystery because he had never used his Doyen power.

Not only did the ugly man keep his Doyen power concealed, but he also refrained from exposing the top assassination arts of the Lifehunter race. While Long Chen managed to discern certain weaknesses in his cloning technique, it was only a partial understanding.

Long Chen didn’t dare to even say if those weaknesses that he had grasped were real or mere bait set by his opponent.

To sum it up, the ugly man was terrifying. After he left, Long Chen looked up at the sky, and his expression suddenly changed.

Without hesitation, Long Chen shot upward toward the sky, akin to a shooting star.
