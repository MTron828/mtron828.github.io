Chapter 3063 What is Called Arrogance

The surrounding people stared at Long Chen in stunned silence. Just where did this person come from to be so brazen? He dared to slap the face of a Divine Lord expert and even made him faint from anger.

“Report your name! Get on stage. I challenge you to a battle to the death!” One of the disciples of the Dark Tiger Alliance roared, divine light suddenly erupting from his body. After that, a tiger roar came from within that light.

“It’s actually an awakened Primal!”

Long Chen indifferently smiled. He swaggered over to him and turned his head back, looking down on him.

“All of you, stand steady. My surname is Long, and my given name is Chen. Everyone in my home calls me Boss Long San. I am from the High Firmament Academy. I don’t mind telling you that Boss Long San came here to become famous. Anyone who doesn’t like it, step onto the martial stage. Boss Long San will accept any challenge.”

Long Chen had completely changed from his previous low-key act. Luo Bing and the others were all befuddled. Was this really the Long Chen that they knew?

“Brat, you’re crazy!”

“Too arrogant!”

“Take care to not ruin yourself in the search for fame!”

“When the heavens are wild, it rains. When a person is wild, calamity descends. Take care to not die here!”

Even before the Dark Tiger Alliance’s people spoke, the people in the crowd began to curse Long Chen.

If it weren’t for the rules, they would probably have attacked.

After all, these people were all outstanding heavenly geniuses in their own right. Who didn’t have a bit of arrogance? None of them viewed themselves as inferior, so Long Chen had essentially challenged all of them.

“You think that just this is arrogance? What frogs at the bottom of a well. Don’t be anxious. Boss Long San will soon show you what true arrogance is,” said Long Chen, his gaze sweeping over the crowd disdainfully. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen had originally just been acting arrogant on purpose. But now he found that acting this way was truly refreshing. Toward the end, it wasn’t even an act. At this time, he found that he simply wasn’t someone who could be low-key.

Seeing their gazes full of rage, yet being unable to do anything, he felt incredibly comfortable inside.

“Fuck, I was stuck watching other people act arrogant all this time. It’s finally my turn.” Long Chen was refreshed inside.

“Boss is mighty and domineering!”

Seeing Long Chen looking so unrivaled even amongst all these heavenly geniuses, Bai Xiaole cried out worshipfully.

“Low-key, low-key… hehe, hahaha!”

Even as he muttered about being low-key, that pleased expression of his made people want to throttle him.

Bai Shishi’s mother was speechless. They had just arrived at Silver Moon City, and things had gone out of control. Long Chen had managed to draw hate from everyone. What was going on with this child? He was normally so smart, but now he became an idiot.

These experts glared at Long Chen and replied with various provoking gestures and expressions. However, Long Chen continued to simply look down on them, driving them crazy.

Luo Bing and the others didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. They felt that this Long Chen was quite unusual.

Luo Ning couldn’t help asking him why he was acting so arrogant. Long Chen’s reply was. “My creed in life is to never bully the weak. I have to bully the strong. And just look, there are so many strong people around. If I don’t bully them now, what will I have learned all these abilities for?”

Luo Bing and the others were speechless. But thinking back, Long Chen had never put on airs with them. Nor would he suppress the weak to make his own status appear grander.

However, here he seemed to go out of control. It was as if he wanted to challenge all the nine prefectures’ heavenly geniuses on his own. It was as if he felt that this world couldn’t contain him.

Countless sharp gazes pierced him. If looks could kill, he would have long since been turned to dust.

However, Long Chen ignored them. In line, he took out a crystal cup and poured some wine for himself, drinking as he waited. His gaze continued to roam, as if everything here was his territory. It was almost like he was marking his territory.

Bai Xiaole immediately started learning from him, taking out his own cup of wine and swaggering behind Long Chen. It really was a good imitation.

The two of them were like two ducks waddling through the crowd. That appearance made even the icy Bai Shishi sneak a laugh, while Luo Ning was already crying from laughter.

However, while they laughed, the others were glaring at Long Chen. Veins throbbed on their foreheads.

“This child…”

Bai Shishi’s mother didn’t know what Long Chen was doing. But with her understanding of Long Chen, she knew that he had his own goal.

It was just that Bai Xiaole was now foolishly following him. That happy expression of his made Bai Shishi’s mother unable to hold back a smile.

Her smile also contained some gratification. Due to his innate issue, in order for his bloodline to not be crippled, Bai Zhantang had used violent means to clear his channels and help him advance.

Bai Xiaole had spent so many years growing up under the fear of violence. Just as Long Chen said, he was very rebellious and felt inferior due to this. It could already be considered a heart-devil.

However, the current Bai Xiaole didn’t seem that way at all. It had only been a few months since he had activated his Three Flower Pupils. In just this short time, Long Chen had dragged him out of his heart-devil, and his bloodline was quickly awakening. Long Chen was truly capable of miracles.

“Brother San, stop swaggering. You’re making me dizzy,” said Mu Qingyun with a bitter smile. The two of them showed no signs of stopping even after a long time.

“It’s fine. If you’re dizzy, then they’ll be even dizzier. For millions of people to accompany you, we’re clearly profiting. To tell the truth, I’m getting dizzy and tired too, but seeing their expressions, everything is worth it,” whispered Long Chen. He continued swaggering around.

Luo Bing and the others laughed. Seeing the furious gazes from everyone, seeing those gazes follow Long Chen wherever he went, they started to feel it was even funnier.

Due to the number of people here, it was taking quite a bit of time to enter the city. Everyone had to show their status plates before they were allowed in.

After half a day, when they were under ten miles from the city gates, a pack of people had lined up behind them. The scene was even more chaotic and bustling than before.

However, at this time, a path suddenly opened amongst the crowd. A group of people walked through arrogantly, entering the city without lining up.

“What is going on?” Luo Bing and the others were startled. Just what kind of people were given such privilege?
