Chapter 4691 Everything Hanging By a Thread

"Ignite your dragon blood!” Guo Ran roared. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Dragonblood Barrier was a condensation of every Dragonblood warrior’s dragon blood, and it marked their final stand. The use of the Dragonblood Barrier signified that they had been forced to the brink. After all, the energy of this barrier stemmed from the dragon blood in them. Once it was broken, they would essentially be powerless.

Multiple attacks rained down on the Dragonblood Barrier, causing the world to shudder. The heavens were torn here and there; it was the scene of the apocalypse.

The Dragonblood warriors gritted their teeth, feeling their essence blood dwindling rapidly. These attacks were too powerful, and it wouldn’t be long before they used up all of their essence blood. When that time came, all that would await them was death.

“Don’t worry, boss will avenge us!” Guo Ran roared as he burned away his essence blood. At this moment, he knew that their chance of surviving was low.

“I refuse to believe that I can’t break your tortoise shell!”

Luo Changsheng and the others couldn’t believe that the barrier would hold on this long. According to their expectations, it should have instantly collapsed under their full-power attacks.

However, the Dragonblood Legion managed to hold one, shocking all the experts who participated in the attack. At the same time, a sense of fear filled them as they knew this legion shouldn’t survive another day. Otherwise, all of them would be doomed.

“Kill!”

Luo Changsheng and the others roared, once more raising their Saint weapons.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, the Dragonblood Barrier finally shattered, unable to endure their powerful attacks. The Dragonblood warriors instantly collapsed, their essence blood exhausted. Fortunately, before shattering, the Dragonblood Barrier exhausted this wave of attacks, so no one was injured.

“Metal energy, Endless Sword Sea!” Just as the barrier exploded, Bai Shishi unleashed the technique that she had been preparing all this time. The lotus throne beneath her feet and the goddess statue behind her both exploded, transforming into a torrent of swords that shot out in every direction.

Bai Shishi was well aware that he couldn’t block all these people, and this attack could only buy her some time. However, for this slight bit of time, she detonated her own manifestation, harming her core energy in exchange for a stronger attack that could slay all of her enemies.

As a result, many of the charging enemies met their ends among the torrent of swords. As every sword contained Bai Shishi’s core energy, even nine star Heavenly Doyens didn’t dare to look down on them. This attack instantly halted their advance as they were forced to defend.

“Big Sister!” Bai Xiaole cried out. After that all-out attack, Bai Shishi directly passed out.

“Die!”

When the torrent of swords vanished, Luo Changsheng and the others roared and charged over once more.

All of a sudden, the air reverberated with the sacred and divine recitation of a holy sutra as Yu Qingxuan appeared above the Dragonblood Legion. She wove intricate hand seals while chanting ancient incantations, summoning forth swirling flame runes that danced around her.

“Slut, fuck off!” Seeing Yu Qingxuan using the Nirvana Scripture, Yu Zihao produced a strange flame rune and slammed it into the ring of flames.

“Break!”

To his surprise, the ring of flames didn’t break, and he was pushed back instead.

“How can this be?!” Yu Zihao roared furiously as the specialized rune taught only to Lord Brahma’s disciples failed to work. Apparently, it was supposed to break down all flame divine abilities in an instant, and it had never failed Yu Zihao.

However, to his dismay, the flame rune was ineffective today. Not even Fallen Daynight’s disciple could penetrate the ring of flames, and alongside other heavenly geniuses, they found themselves steadily driven backward.

The ring of flames didn’t possess much killing power, but it was extremely tough. Luo Changsheng unleashed a series of saber strikes upon it, only to witness his attacks bounce off every time.

The collective shock and frustration added up among their ranks. Just how was it that the Dragonblood Legion had so many monsters in it? How could they survive this long?

“Big Sister Qingxuan!”

At this moment, Bai Shishi’s eyes snapped open, a cry escaping her lips as she observed Yu Qingxuan's complexion growing increasingly pale. Her lifeforce was draining away, depleted to sustain the ring of flames. If this continued, she would die.

“DIE!”

Just then, a giant fist covered in three-colored divine light struck the ring of flames, and it exploded.

Yu Qingxuan spat out blood, and it stained her robes like tiny plum blossoms. Her beautiful eyes dimmed instantly as she collapsed to the ground.

“Big Sister!”

Bai Shishi hastily caught Yu Qingxuan. Fortunately, she was still alive.

“You’re both Long Chen’s women, right? Good, I’ll personally kill you in front of him. That should teach him just how foolish it is to provoke the Three-Headed race!”

Wu Hun walked over. The wound to his head had healed, but the fury of being stabbed by Yue Zifeng still gnawed at him. With every step he took, heaven and earth boomed.

“Little Nine, we can’t be afraid! Charge!” Bai Xiaole shouted. Blood still came out of his eyes, but he endured the pain and continued to form hand seals.

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s giant figure appeared behind Bai Xiaole, and both of their pupils had a strange mark within them.

“Scram!”

Just then, Wu Hun shot forward and unleashed a punch, blasting apart a three-flower diagram that had just appeared in the void.

Its destruction sent Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox flying back. Wu Hun had successfully interrupted their pupil art.

“Die!”

With Bai Xiaole out of the picture, no one else could get in Wu Hun’s way. His fist smashed toward Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi mercilessly.

BANG!

In a resounding collision, a hand filled with blood-colored dragon scales intercepted Wu Hun’s ferocious blow, and a figure appeared in front of Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan.

“Long Chen!”

“Boss!”

Seeing that figure, the entire Dragonblood Legion cheered, while Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan were overcome with relief.
