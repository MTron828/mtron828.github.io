Chapter 2887 Blood Spirit Bone Armor

Hold a class? Luo Bing instantly understood. If he was provoked on his way to teach, it would be fundamentally different than if he was provoked while just on a stroll.

“Alright.”

Luo Bing didn’t know why Long Chen had come here, but this wasn’t the place to discuss it. Hence, she then walked away with Long Chen.

“Hold it!”

Suddenly, an extremely thin and tall person walked out of the crowd. Even his hands and feet were long like a stretched-out person.

Long Chen couldn’t help being startled when he looked at him. This person possessed a strange aura, and it was vaguely demonic.

“He is Gu Fei, ranked two on the immortal rankings. He’s extremely powerful. I haven’t exchanged blows with him in half a year, but I can tell he’s only grown stronger. I don’t know if I can still beat him,” whispered Luo Bing into Long Chen’s ear.

“So another person acting like the pig to eat the tiger,” said Long Chen.

“What?” Luo Bing and Luo Ning were shocked. They instantly thought of Chu Kuang. Was this Gu Fei the same? He was concealing his true power?

Gu Fei walked out with a group of people, and Long Chen eyed them. All of them had suppressed auras. Even from a distance, Long Chen could smell the scent of medicinal pills, so he shook his head inside.

Luo Bing was probably going to lose the immortal competition on her side. There were several fellows here whose auras were extremely powerful. They might be able to conceal it from others, but they couldn’t conceal it from the senses of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

They were using medicinal pills to suppress their auras and make their opponents lower their guard. But when Luo Bing and the others confidently faced them in battle, they would unleash their full power and crush them in an instant.

This would shatter Luo Bing’s group mentally. If the other side took advantage of this moment to say some provoking words, they could even rattle their Dao-hearts and give rise to a heart-devil.

“Instructor Long Chen, you said just now that you had two statuses. One is a Pill Institute disciple, while the other is an instructor of the God Institute. When the disciples provoke you, they must be punished. But you have publicly admitted that you will be joining the divine competition. If you are joining it, you are a disciple of the God Institute. For you to come here under the guise of your instructor status is shirking responsibility, don’t you think?” said Gu Fei.

Although he used a courteous tone, his gaze was filled with clear hostility.

“That’s right! You’re joining the divine competition, so you’re a disciple of the God Institute! Yet you dare to bring out your instructor status to suppress others here. The God Institute’s people grow more and more shameless!” sneered one of the disciples beside Gu Fei.

After that, Long Chen’s palm slapped across his face, causing such a giant explosive sound that everyone jumped.

That disciple shot back like a cannonball, slamming into a giant stone pillar. Half his face was a bloody mess, but the thing that shocked everyone was that there were bone-like runes on top of that side of his face.

Those runes were what blocked a portion of Long Chen’s slap, otherwise, his head would have exploded.

“Blood Spirit Bone Armor!”

Luo Ning cried out in shock. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“How can he have trained in the Blood Spirit Bone Armor?!” exclaimed the disciples beside Luo Ning.

The Blood Spirit Bone Armor was a very famous defensive art inside of the Immortal Institute. Using blood essence and bone runes, one could freely activate a layer of defense. It was a practical technique, especially on battlefields where you had to exchange injuries. You might be able to defend freely with this one move, while your opponent would be killed.

This slap had actually exposed the trump card of this disciple, stunning Luo Ning and the others. This person was nothing more than rank twenty-six on their rankings. He wasn’t remarkable at all. Luo Bing couldn’t even recall his name.

However, such an unremarkable person had silently mastered such a powerful defensive art. Then the others… Luo Ning didn’t dare to imagine it.

“Let me repeat myself: if you want to play, let’s play. Don’t think that you can play with your lives just because you have some Blood Spirit Bone Armor. Even if you had an undying vajra body, I could still slap you to death. I said that I would participate in the divine competition, but the list hasn’t been handed in yet. In other words, I am still not a disciple of the God Institute and am still an instructor. Whoever doesn’t like it can step forward. Boss Long San has roamed the world for over twenty years and has specialized in medicine for all kinds of ailments.”

Gu Fei’s expression sank. He had forgotten this point. If Long Chen hadn’t made any official application to join the divine competition, then he still couldn’t count as a disciple of the God Institute.

Just at this moment, the disciple that Long Chen had slapped coughed up a mouthful of blood and slowly slid down the pillar, leaving a long bloody line. It was a somewhat alarming sight.

“Sorry to you two, I’m not intentionally provoking the Immortal Institute. But some people do things that make me feel bad if I don’t give them a beating. Since I still have things to do, I’ll take my leave. I’ll treat you to a drink another day.” Long Chen cupped his fists to the two Elders who were awkwardly standing there. The two of them only replied in kind.

Only then did Long Chen leave with Luo Bing and the others. Gu Fei stared at his back hatefully.

“This Long Chen is too arrogant!” Someone helped the disciple that had been slapped, but the latter was already unconscious. The state of his face was quite frightening, and the person supporting him couldn’t help shouting angrily.

“Long Chen, is it? Just wait. You will regret this.” Gu Fei spat out some vicious words and turned to leave with his people.

“Hold it. You can bring him away but not the others!” The law enforcement disciples stopped them. Gu Fei was actually planning on leaving with the others who had been injured this time as well.

“What? Are you not afraid of alliance head Gu Fei finding trouble for you in the future?!” cursed one of the disciples.

That law enforcement disciple smiled. “I’m afraid. How could I not be? But I’m even more afraid of instructor Long Chen. He has said that these three must be sent to the Discipline Institute. We must send them, or we’d have failed in our duty. As for this brother, instructor Long Chen didn’t say anything about him, so we won’t bring him. If you stop us from taking them away, I’ll shout for instructor Long Chen to come back. Decide whether you want us to bring away three people or four people.”

“You… you’re courting death!” raged one of those disciples. The law enforcement disciples actually dared to act so tough in front of them today.

“That’s enough!”

Suddenly, the two Elders shouted coldly, “Everything will be done according to the rules! Do you think the two of us are nothing more than empty air? Don’t think that your own little connections are enough for you to do whatever you please. I’d advise you to reserve yourselves a bit. Don’t die like those inner academy disciples of the God Institute. At that time, your lives would simply be exchanged for immortal crystals.”

These disciples were actually ignoring the two of them, enraging them. Hence, after shouting at them, both of them left.

Gu Fei could only watch as those law enforcement disciples carried away the three people that Long Chen had slapped. Although those three were not exactly trusted aides, it was still a slap to his face that he couldn’t protect them, especially since it was in front of so many people.

“Long Chen, just wait. You will pay the price for your arrogance.” Gu Fei clenched his teeth and led his people away.
