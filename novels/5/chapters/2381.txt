Chapter 2371 Falling Into the Con

Translator: BornToBe

“Retreat!”

The eighth legion’s warriors were about to slaughter all the demonic beasts that they were surrounding until someone shouted. Without hesitation, everyone flew away.

Their bodies suddenly vanished mysteriously as if space had enveloped them.

Those warriors had entered an illusion formation that had been activated from near a spatial crack. Without getting close, there was no way to tell.

At this moment, a war chariot came racing over. Ye Lingfeng was standing atop it, only to see a mass of corpses from the demonic beasts. There were still some straggling demonic beasts fleeing.

“Hm? Curious, where are they? They retreated without even cleaning up the battlefield?” The person who had reported this in the first place couldn’t understand it.

“Something seems off,” said one of the vice commanders. But he was unable to say what was off.

The eighth legion was famous for their poverty. When they cleaned up the battlefield, they wouldn’t leave a single thing. But now they had run off without even picking up a corpse?

BOOM!

Suddenly, space exploded. Runes filled the air, causing them all to jump. Upon seeing those runes, Ye Lingfeng’s gaze turned cold. “Mirror image runes.”

Ye Lingfeng instantly recognized them. No wonder he had felt it was odd. What they had been seeing was just a mirror image.

Those runes exploded and roaring filled the air. A mass of Titan Blood Bull demons came charging over. They had been here the whole time, and upon seeing a lone chariot rushing over, they had first been dumbfounded. But then seeing it was all alone, they didn’t overthink it and attacked.

“How stupid. They spent this much money just to give us some food?” Ye Lingfeng sneered. A group of Titan Blood Bull demons was nothing to him.

However, he had yet to finish talking when another Mirror Image Formation appeared behind them, splintering apart to reveal a group of black four-legged lizards. Those lizards spat out black mist that surged toward them.

“Activate the chariot’s defenses to block the poison mist!” ordered Ye Lingfeng.

The most terrifying aspect of those lizards was their poison. Even armor could be corroded by it. It wasn’t the actual armor itself, but the runes that gave it its power that would be corroded.

Suddenly, strange sounds came from the distance. Someone cried “Arrow Bone Rats!”

Giant rats with bone spurs coming out of their backs were rushing over. Those bone spurs were just as sharp as arrows.

As soon as they appeared, those bone spurs came shooting over. They exploded on contact with the chariot, and although the chariot was not damaged, it was shaking intensely. The Magical Beasts carrying it were wiped out.

Ye Lingfeng was infuriated. Everyone other than him was forced to hide within the chariot. The chariot’s runes lit up, unleashing runic swords that killed the closest Titan Blood Bull demons.

The unfortunate thing was that the lizards’ poison mist was extremely effective against human flesh and armor, but other demonic beasts didn’t seem to mind.

The most terrifying opponents for them were the Arrow Bone Rats. Their bone arrows were almost equivalent to the attack of the arrow towers. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Through a formation disc, Long Chen watched everything going on. He couldn’t help smacking his lips. “Those Arrow Bone Rats are so powerful.”

Beside him, Shen Chengfeng said, “Of course. They’re very terrifying existences that we have never dared to get close to. When we see them, we immediately retreat to focus on defense. They’re the only ones that can wipe us out instantly if we’re not careful. Fortunately, their range isn’t that great. That’s why it was possible to lure them over here. Long Chen, I’m pretty amazed you managed to calculate everything so perfectly.”

To lure the demonic beasts over so accurately, Long Chen had used multiple Mirror Image Formations, making them come here without even noticing it.

“These are just some meaningless tricks. I don’t like using them because they’re so childish, but sometimes they can be fun to play around with. Hiding here while watching the fish get lured in bit by bit, hehe, it really feels quite good,” laughed Long Chen.

It had been a while since he had played some schemes. Hiding while conning others, if the old man were to learn of this, he would definitely curse him to death. But Long Chen did feel quite successful inside.

Ye Lingfeng’s group was being thrown about within the carriage from the attacks of the Arrow Bone Rats.

“Bastard, do you think this is enough to make things hard on me?! You’re too immature!” Ye Lingfeng roared and slammed the core of the chariot’s formation. He was going to unleash the full power of the chariot.

However, just at that moment, a jade plate on his waist began to rapidly blink, causing his expression to change.

“Our defensive line has been attacked!”

The chariot tumbled away, wretchedly managing to get away from the attacks of the demonic beasts. However, those demonic beasts followed. Their intelligence wasn’t very high, and seeing one lonely war chariot, they felt that this was a chance they might not get again.

The chariot sped through the air, with three groups of demonic beasts in hot pursuit. As the chariot fled, more groups of demonic beasts appeared in their way, and when they saw the chariot, they immediately attacked.

“Bastards, they definitely did something here!” raged Ye Lingfeng. Their retreat path had also been set up. He didn’t even know where these demonic beasts were coming from.

More and more of them were appearing, causing him to panic. If their defensive line was lost, taking it back would be very difficult.

“Long Chen, you little bastard, just wait. Once I settle things here, don’t even think about leaving the Ancient Battlefield alive!”

With his understanding of Shen Chengfeng, Ye Lingfeng was sure that he couldn’t come up with such a scheme. One reason was because Shen Chengfeng didn’t have the head for it, while the other was because he didn’t have the guts. This was definitely Long Chen’s idea.

More and more demonic beasts appeared, but fortunately they had the war chariot. If they hadn’t, they would have been doomed.

Ye Lingfeng didn’t dare to tarry. If they were trapped in a battle against these demonic beasts, once the chariot’s energy was all used up, it would become a scrap of useless metal.

Perhaps he himself would be able to escape with his power, but everyone else would die.

Countless runic swords were shooting out of the chariots, forcibly carving a bloody path through the demonic beasts. They didn’t even have time to pick up the corpses.

It was like Ye Lingfeng had angered a hornet’s nest, except it wasn’t hornets but millions of demonic beasts.

From a distance, Long Chen saw a line of dust appear in the sky as Ye Lingfeng fled. He sighed.

Shen Chengfeng also sighed. This was a sigh that represented the slightest relief from years of resentment.

The Heavenly Dragon warriors were starting to clean up the battlefield. One of them excitedly said, “The third legion’s Flying Dragon War Chariots are really powerful. If we had one as well, wouldn’t we be able to reclaim our lost territory?”

“If we had such a thing, we would never have lost our territory.”

“Don’t dream. Such a treasure couldn’t be bought even if we saved all our points for three years. Be more realistic and clean up the battlefield. Hehe, it seems that we’ll not only get back our investment but also make some profit.”

All the Heavenly Dragon warriors felt great satisfaction looking at Ye Lingfeng’s wretched sight. Not only that, but they were also picking up the corpses of powerful demonic beasts that could be exchanged for enough points to make up for what they had spent.

“Long Chen, that’s about enough. If we get any closer to the seventh legion’s camp, the formation will sense us,” said Shen Chengfeng.

Right now, they were still on the edge of the region that the seventh legion’s camp could sense. The divine families had rules, and taking corpses that they hadn’t killed would be considered stealing.

Of course, if no one saw, then rules became powerless. It would be troublesome though if they were noticed.

“Based on our current profit, we haven’t lost out at all. We even profited a bit. We can leave now,” said Shen Chengfeng.

“Leave now? Do you think that when I go out, I’m satisfied with so little? It seems you really have gotten used to your poor days.” Long Chen looked at Shen Chengfeng with surprise.

“Brother Long… what did you plan to do?”

Long Chen was speechless. “How refreshing. This is just the start, and the good show has yet to begin. How could we stop now? We still haven’t used quite a few of the things that we bought.”

“Ah? Then what’s next?”

“Next? Next, we can just watch the fun. At this time, Ye Lingfeng should have returned to his camp.”

…

Ye Lingfeng truly had returned. However, when he did, he saw that there were no demonic beasts attacking. Everything was still calm. The warriors stationed there stared at him in shock.

Behind him was an army of demonic beasts charging over. Ye Lingfeng’s expression changed. He knew he had been scammed again.

“Activate all the defenses! The arrow towers, war chariots, divine crossbows, and the dragon cannons must be unleashed!” roared Ye Lingfeng.
