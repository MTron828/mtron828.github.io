Chapter 3513

“Long Chen, you actually say that the swallow nest I prepared for fairy Qingxuan will harm her?! If you don’t give me a satisfactory explanation, then I, Feng Xiang, swear that you won’t leave the Dragon Blaze Prefecture alive!” declared Feng Xiang angrily. He didn’t even bother concealing his killing intent.

He was pushed to his limit. The Golden Silk Blood Swallow’s nest was something that even he normally couldn’t bear to eat. But Long Chen actually said that he had malicious intent by preparing it for others? How could he not be infuriated?

“That’s right, if you don’t give us a satisfactory explanation, then I, Zhao Mingxuan, will not spare you for accusing young master Feng Xiang!” said Zhao Mingxuan.

The others also stood, saying a few words. They looked like they were just about to kill Long Chen.

They had finally grasped the chance that they were waiting for to get rid of Long Chen.

In front of all their anger, Long Chen continued to appear indifferent. He was so calm that even those two fourth Heavenstage World Kings felt impressed.

It had to be known that facing so many terrifying heavenly geniuses wasn’t something that even the two of them dared to take casually. But Long Chen seemed to view them as inconsequential. Furthermore, Long Chen had continuously given them an unfathomable feeling of mystery. When Long Chen’s killing intent erupted, even the two of them were shaken. Hence, they were very curious about his origins.

Ignoring Feng Xiang and the others’ furious glares, Long Chen looked at Yu Qingxuan. “Do you know the origins of this swallow nest?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Isn’t it when the swallow uses the essence within their body to make a nest?” asked Yu Qingxuan with confusion.

“Yes. But the Golden Silk Blood Swallow is different. They are spirit beasts of heaven and earth. When they lay eggs, they will spit out the energy of their own bodies to make the nest. Hence, this nest will contain its essence blood. The essence blood is used to nourish its descendants. Thus, while there are many kinds of swallow nests, only the Blood Swallow’s nest is exceedingly precious. It is because that essence blood is its life. When it creates a nest and someone takes it away, it will spit out more essence blood to create a new nest. As someone continuously takes it away and it spits out more essence blood to create more nests, the nests it creates grow redder. That is because its energy is running out, and it can only use increasingly more of its essence blood to make up for it. This nest is the final one that the Golden Silk Blood Swallow made right before its death. It left its entire life to this nest, because without this nest, its child would be unable to incubate. It spat out all its life and died for this goal. For this nest to appear before us represents that the Blood Swallow and all its children in its stomach died powerlessly just like that.” Long Chen’s voice was heavy with emotion.

Yu Qingxuan’s heart ached. She hadn’t expected that this precious swallow nest was obtained through such cruel means.

“Sorry, I can’t eat this swallow nest.” Yu Qingxuan pushed the swallow nest in front of her away. Considering her kind nature, she couldn’t accept such food.

Feng Xiang was instantly embarrassed and looked at Long Chen with increasing hatred. This fellow was absolutely hateful, constantly going against him.

“Long Chen, what are you saying? In the cultivation world, the weak are devoured by the strong. Are you a vegetarian? Who are you to act like some saint?!” demanded one of them.

“I’m not vegetarian. I eat meat, and I’ve killed more lifeforms than all of you have seen in your entire life. But there is one thing. I never harm kind lifeforms. I always feel like kind lives should be treated as warmly as possible. The Golden Silk Blood Swallow is a good species amongst spirit beasts. It does not compete with the rest of the world and simply relies on absorbing the spiritual qi of heaven and earth to live. They are also auspicious beasts of heaven and earth, close to the human race. Sometimes when humans are in trouble, they will even appear to help the human race. Humans need to have respect and gratitude in their hearts. If you eat their lives, they might not hate you, but the Heavenly Daos will settle this debt with you. Right now, those calamities have not befallen you yet, but you are already far from fortune,” said Long Chen, shaking his head.

Although the Golden Silk Blood Swallow was not as famous as the Butterfly Spirit race, it was still a species of auspicious beasts, and a very kind lifeform at that.

“What a huge joke. When has my Golden Crow race ever been afraid? We’ll kill and eat whoever we want. The cultivation world is a cruel world where the weak are devoured. That’s the truth of the Heavenly Daos. If you are eaten, it only proves that you aren’t strong enough. That is your fate,” scoffed Wu Yang.

“If you eat it, I won’t stop you. I’m simply warning fairy Qingxuan. I’m afraid that she will regret it for the rest of her life if she eats it. As for the rest of you? To tell the truth, your life and death means nothing to me. Don’t treat yourselves as so important,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Long Chen, truly thank you. If you hadn’t warned me and I learned of it in the future, I would definitely feel guilty for the rest of my lifetime.” Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen gratefully.

Long Chen smiled and indicated that it was nothing more than a minor matter. He continued eating as if nothing had happened.

But Feng Xiang and the others were so enraged that they were about to explode. How could they still eat? Seeing Long Chen eating so nonchalantly, they had the urge to flip the entire table into his face. This fellow was truly hateful.

“Long Chen, how are you so amazing? How do you know so much?” Seeing Feng Xiang and the others’ fury that was barely contained, while Long Chen acted as if all of that had nothing to do with him, Yu Qingxuan hastily interjected.

Long Chen was in the midst of stuffing meat into his mouth. As he didn’t chew it enough and ended up swallowing too quickly, it was stuck in his throat. Yu Qingxuan hastily passed a cup of wine to him. He only managed to swallow the meat with the help of that wine.

Long Chen smiled. “Thank you. Ah, in truth, I don’t have much power, and my looks aren’t so great. My mom told me that ugly people need to read more books. When I arrived in the immortal world, I ended up spending some time in an academy. I conned the dean there, managing to sweet-talk him into making me a Heaven Master of the academy. Just think about it! As a Heaven Master, I have to have some learning at least, right? I was forced beyond my skills, afraid of being exposed. So, I studied and taught, studied and taught. As a result, I ended up learning a great deal but not too much of any category. It’s the typical model of jack of all trades, master of none.”

Even as he talked, he continued eating. He was very expressive, giving off a humorous and particularly amiable feeling.

Yu Qingxuan had never met someone like this. All the people that she had encountered were very respectful toward her and were careful with their words. But Long Chen was particularly relaxed, as if they had no statuses to bind each other. They could chat with no other thought other than the conversation. This was a feeling that she had never had before, so she felt particularly interested.

Feng Xiang and the others watched as almost all the good stuff on the table was eaten by Long Chen. This table had become his display stage. Hearing Yu Qingxuan’s occasional laughter, they were so enraged that their eyes turned green.

“I heard that someone commented on this lowly one’s humble wine? May I see them?”

Suddenly, a clear voice resounded throughout heaven and earth. When they heard that voice, Feng Xiang and the others instantly smiled delightedly.

Yu Qingxuan was startled. She instantly realized that someone from the Wine God Palace had come. Someone had definitely spread the word that Long Chen had criticized the Pear Flower Wine. Based on Feng Xiang and the others’ expressions, it was clear that they had done it secretly.

Feng Xiang and the others were smiling, and so was Long Chen. He announced, “It was I who casually judged your wine. If I’ve offended you, please forgive me! If senior doesn’t mind, why not come chat with me for a bit?”

Space suddenly shook and a figure appeared. When they sensed that person’s aura, the two fourth Heavenstage World Kings instantly stood up and appeared beside Yu Qingxuan.
