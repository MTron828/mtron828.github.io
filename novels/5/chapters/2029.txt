The ground exploded over and over again. Long Chen tore through the Brahma secret realm’s trial regions, destroying the trials and taking the final rewards.

Those trials were supposed to give a single reward to anyone who passed before transporting them out. The remaining treasures were for others. But Long Chen ignored that rule, directly destroying the formations and taking the treasures.

This Brahma secret realm was one of Pill Valley’s inheritance lands. Everything here was man-made. However, for some reason, Pill Valley had lost control of it, and only Life Star disciples could enter now.

As for those Life Star disciples from Pill Valley, many of them were in the middle of the trials when Long Chen barged in, terrifying them.

However, Long Chen didn’t kill them. As he had said, having taken their money, as long as they didn’t attack him, he wouldn’t attack them.

That didn’t stop him from crushing hundreds of the trial regions. Those trial regions were told to him by other disciples who were filled with anger toward Pill Valley. If it hadn’t been Long Chen, they might have fallen for their trap and be bound to their will.

Telling Long Chen where Pill Valley’s trial regions were didn’t benefit them in the slightest, but seeing those trial regions be destroyed one by one allowed them to vent some of their rage.

After passing on the information to Long Chen, the majority of the disciples chose to find a secluded place and calmly attune themselves to the Grand Dao that was present here. They hoped to awaken their manifestations quicker.

After flipping through some of the trials, Long Chen started showing people what the rewards were. They were treasures only to Pill Valley’s disciples. Outside of Pill Valley, they were essentially useless.

As for that legendary eleventh tier medicinal pill, it never appeared. It was just nonsense. He didn’t find a hint of it.

Pill Valley’s con this time had been exposed by Long Chen. They had been hoping to draw a portion of these neutral experts to their side, but now they had ended up offending them without having the so-called god’s oath to bind them. The chances of them ever joining Pill Valley in the future had sharply dropped.

Long Chen’s guess was that Pill Valley’s goal had been to draw these people in, and when those people realized that all the good things here were kept from them, they would be forced to listen to orders thanks to the god’s curse.

Other than that, while the treasures here couldn’t be obtained by them, there was the energy of the Grand Dao present that helped them awaken their manifestations, and afterward Pill Valley could always give some further compensation to calm their anger. After all, they would have already sworn the oath. Furthermore, after being tricked, would these prideful heavenly geniuses really say what had happened? That would only further embarrass them.

What these geniuses feared most was having their Dao-hearts influenced by some god’s curse. Even if the god’s curse was fake, it would leave a seed of doubt that would affect their futures.

It was precisely due to this that the disciples felt great hatred for Pill Valley. They would rather give Long Chen information about the trial regions for free just to vent.

After a few days of work, everywhere Long Chen had gone was in ruins. The disciples around to see it all felt very refreshed.

Some of those disciples even followed Long Chen to see him destroy more trials. It was a beautiful sight to them.

In fact, some people even felt that just watching Long Chen fight was beneficial to their own cultivation. Quite a few people activated photographic jades to record the sight.

Long Chen obtained plentiful rewards. He had gained over three thousand of the Earth Flame Spirit Birthing Beads, and over two hundred flame divine items. He had also killed dozens of powerful Earth Flame Spirit Beasts.

Huo Long was benefiting immensely. It was growing stronger and more intelligent.

As for Long Chen, he was quite generous. If people gave him information on the trial regions, he wouldn’t mind giving away what he had found if it wasn’t useful to Huo Long.

At first, those people politely declined, as just watching Long Chen destroy these trial regions was satisfying. But then Long Chen just tossed those things to them. Those things were not cheap. If put on the market, they would be worth quite a bit of money. They were priceless treasures to flame-attribute cultivators.

Seeing Long Chen toss such things to them, those disciples were even more motivated to find the locations of the trial regions.

...

“Bastard!”

When news of what was happening within the Brahma secret realm reached Pill Valley’s experts, they were infuriated. Elder Tianqi clenched his teeth so hard that they creaked. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He could no longer act like a calm sage. Instead, it looked like flames were about to burst from his eyes.

Long Chen was destroying the entire Brahma secret realm, and they couldn’t stop him. There were dozens of Elders nearby, looking nervously at Elder Tianqi.

“Perhaps we should alert the divine daughter!” probed one Elder cautiously.

“Are you an idiot? The divine daughter is currently being blessed by the divine light within the Brahma Divine Palace. How could we disturb her right now?!” cursed Elder Tianqi.

That Elder immediately shut his mouth, but inside, he cursed Elder Tianqi who had failed to capture Long Chen in the beginning. Now he was spreading his rage at them.

“Then what should we do?” demanded another Elder.

That Elder’s status was too high for Elder Tianqi to rage at him. He took a deep breath and said, “Long Chen cannot be allowed to leave Pill Valley. Right now, he’s being a miserable rat destroying as much as he can. He has also ruined the valley master’s plans, and those who should have become loyal subordinates are now hostile. Tch, those thankless wretches, do they not know that we are the ones who gave them the chance to enter the Brahma secret realm? We let them enter for free!”

Elder Tianqi suddenly burst into curses. He had cursed more today than he had over most of his life.

“Well, there’s nothing we can do about it right now. We can only wait for the divine daughter to come out of seclusion, or for some people to awaken their manifestations and challenge Long Chen. We can only wait.” Elder Tianqi sighed helplessly. “However, it’s only a matter of time. The pillar of the Martial Heaven Alliance is Long Chen. As long as he dies, the Dragonblood Legion will become a headless dragon and fracture, with the Martial Heaven Alliance’s morale plummeting. So no matter how much damage Long Chen causes, as long as we capture him in the end, we will still be the winners. Elder Qi Li, you’re in charge of the grand formation. If there’s the slightest mishap, you know the consequences.”

That Elder Qi Li smiled faintly and calmly said, “Elder Tianqi, don’t worry. I have thirty-six of my disciples keeping watch, as well as one hundred and sixty thousand disciples of the Flame Divine Palace guarding eight divine formations. It is not impossible for Long Chen to leave Pill Valley. Even the valley master himself wouldn’t be able to leave without the tablets of every one of us.”

Things had been raised to their highest level of caution. The grand formation was fully activated. To go through the formation would require the tablets of thirty-six Elders from Pill Valley and seventy-two Elders from the Flame Divine Palace. Furthermore, eight checkpoints needed to be closed before the entire formation would be released.

The Brahma secret realm only had one exit, and it didn’t border any other world. Even breaking through space wouldn’t work.

Once the Brahma secret realm closed, everyone inside would be brought out. At that time, Long Chen would be caught.

“As long as you understand. Remember, because the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle’s people have already left, people know that Long Chen has come here. We have to be able to stop an attack from the outside as well. There can be no mistakes this time,” said Elder Tianqi. There was a sinister light in his eyes. Perhaps he was considering just how to torture Long Chen once he was captured to release the rage in his heart.

...

Long Chen spent seven days destroying the trial regions. On the seventh day, he encountered a terrifying Earth Flame Spirit Beast in an underground space.

It was actually the Black Illusion Dragon Flame. Its power was astonishing, and Long Chen spent several hours fighting it before working together with Huo Long to draw it into the primal chaos space.

It was unknown just how many years it had been alive. Despite how powerful Huo Long was, devouring it was very difficult.

In the end, Huo Long had furiously swallowed it in one gulp and then entered a state of slumber. It was clearly focused on digesting its energy and would be unable to assist Long Chen for a short while.

Adding on all the other flame beasts it had consumed, Huo Long was full. It couldn’t eat any more.

During the time that Long Chen had been destroying the trial regions, the majority of experts had settled in. They vanished, finding their own places to enter seclusion.

The Brahma secret realm was huge, and Long Chen couldn’t just go around breaking trial regions. With Huo Long in seclusion, Long Chen decided to calm down. He looked in a certain direction and began rushing toward the center of the Brahma secret realm.
