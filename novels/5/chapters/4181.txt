Chapter 4170: The Battle God Palace’s Master

This heavenly genius had not expected Long Chen to get right up next to him just to slap him.

Furthermore, Long Chen had laid a trap with his words. He was precisely waiting for this response.

The next moment, Long Chen’s slap sent him tumbling into the distance, leaving him dazed. As he struggled to regain his footing, he raised a trembling finger to point at Long Chen, intending to unleash a barrage of curses. However, before he could utter a single word, a sudden burst of blood sprayed from his mouth. He then felt the world spinning around him, and his eyes rolled back, causing him to collapse on the group.

“You…! How despicable! This was a sneak attack!” One of his friends hastily went to support him and shouted at Long Chen angrily.

“Even without sneak attacks, none of you are my match. I can’t be bothered to waste words with you. You think you're a badass? Then why did you come to the High Firmament Academy? Who granted you the audacity to display such arrogance while seeking our knowledge? If you really were a badass, you wouldn’t have come to our High Firmament Academy. Since you’ve come to learn, then you better cultivate some humility. If you can manage that, then you can stay. Otherwise, scram. Slapping you is a light punishment. If you really anger me, you won’t get to live another day.” Long Chen smiled coldly at those arrogant heavenly geniuses.

Those people had to be stupid. They had come here to learn but still had such an attitude? Were their brains replaced with crap?

“Who are you?! Do you think the High Firmament Academy is your home?!” shouted someone stubbornly.

“Correct, this is our home. You don’t like it? Even if you don’t like it, you have to accept it. If you want to study in the High Firmament Academy, you have to take the attitude of a student and respect the rules here. Starting now, anyone who disobeys the academy’s rules will be kicked out. Mercy will not be given. If anyone from a certain faction breaks the academy’s rules, then they will all be kicked out,” declared Long Chen. He then ignored these people and continued on with Bai Shishi.

These heavenly geniuses were all shaken, unable to imagine just what kind of status this black-robed fellow had to say such big words.

Walking alongside Bai Shishi, Long Chen eventually reached the core of the ruins. He saw quite a few disciples from other factions and not many from the actual academy.

“What is going on? Has the High Firmament Academy been occupied by other factions?” Long Chen couldn’t help frowning.

Long Chen saw quite a few jealous gazes on the way, as well as quite a few provoking ones. He truly did want to kick them all out.

However, before understanding what was going on, he should endure for a bit. But his patience was wearing thin.

“It doesn’t count as ‘occupied’ yet!”

Just then, the kindly-looking Bai Letian appeared in front of Long Chen. Long Chen and Bai Shishi immediately bowed.

Bai Letian laughed and said, “When the High Firmament Academy was founded, we had the support of various major powers. Like rolling a snowball, the academy grew stronger and stronger. Only then did it come to possess its vast sea of knowledge. So, it could be said that the High Firmament Academy belongs to the entire world, and we can’t be selfish. Our hearts have to be a bit wider.”

“But these people are taking advantage of our kindness. I’m not happy about it.” Long Chen couldn’t help but frown.

“You’re not happy about it? Haha, I share your sentiment, but I must abide by our founder’s will. My authority is limited. However, you earned your position through merit rather than inheritance, so you aren't bound by our ancestral traditions. Also, I'm not here for the Sage King Convention; I have a separate mission. Therefore, everything here is up to you,” said Bai Letian with a smile.

“You’re saying…?” probed Long Chen.

“I’m not saying anything. It’s all up to you.” Bai Letian smiled profoundly.

Long Chen’s jaw dropped suddenly. He recalled that Bai Letian had the aura of an Immortal King, and the latter had even fought Enpuda’s clone like that. However, now he noticed that Bai Letian not only had the Immortal King's aura but also the aura of a World King and a Heaven Venerate. Long Chen was utterly incapable of discerning Bai Letian's true cultivation level. It was his first time encountering such a thing.

Seeming to grasp Long Chen’s thought, Bai Letian said, “Sometimes, what you see in this world is only what other people want you to see. Your eyes might not see reality. This time, the Sage King Convention descended rather suddenly. It’s a bit odd, so I had no choice but to personally take a trip. But now that you’re here, I feel good about leaving. Everything here will be up to you.”

“Dean, you can’t! I still have a great deal of affairs to deal with!” Long Chen jumped in shock. Before the convention actually started, he still had a lot of work to do. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“No problem. The Battle God Palace’s master is overseeing this place personally, so the High Firmament Academy is in no danger. However, the palace master doesn’t like to deal with politics and is only in charge of the safety here. He won't meddle in other matters, so your main duty is to maintain order here. Feel free to pursue your own objectives!” said Bai Letian.

“But…” Long Chen still didn’t want this burden. He was very busy with the matter of the auction right now.

If he were to be here, he would be acting as a dean of the High Firmament Academy. Then it wouldn’t be convenient for him to scam people.

“No buts. Youngsters should follow their desires instead of becoming like us, always burdened by excessive caution and worry. If a youngster doesn’t have a youngster’s drive and daring, they wouldn’t be called a youngster. Do what you want. Status and position are nonsensical constructs. Since I still have matters to deal with, I’ll take my leave. Go greet the palace master.” Bai Letian left and directly sent them off.

Long Chen and Bai Shishi could only leave. Looking at Long Chen’s bitter expression, Bai Shishi couldn’t help but laugh.

“What is it? You’re not the Long Chen I know. What happened to that fearlessness of yours?”

“Shishi, I’m about to do something very bad. I’m worried about damaging the academy’s reputation,” said Long Chen finally.

Bai Shishi laughed. “As if you’ve ever done anything good.”

Long Chen was speechless. But thinking back, it truly did seem as if he had never done anything good in the presence of Bai Shishi.

“It’s fine. Whatever you do, I’ll be with you. Whether you become a hero or a villain, I’m not afraid, so what are you afraid of?” Bai Shishi blushed slightly after saying that. It was embarrassing for her to disclose the words of her heart.

“Hehe, is this the saying if you marry a chicken, you must follow the chicken, if you marry a dog, you must follow the dog?” laughed Long Chen.

“Who said that I’d marry you?! Shameless!” Bai Shishi snorted and turned away.

“Cough…”

Just as the two were talking and laughing, they heard some awkward coughing sound. Unbeknownst to them, three people had silently appeared before them.

One of them was Bai Shishi’s father, Bai Zhantang, while the second one was a large, muscular man. However, it was the person standing between them that caused Long Chen to startle.

“Greetings, palace master!”

Bai Shishi dragged Long Chen to bow toward this person together.

“Palace master?”

Long Chen was shaken. The palace master was actually an expert of the dragon race.
