Chapter 3598

“Heavens, this is dragon blood essence gold! High purity hundred refinement mithril! Double essence fire wind copper…!”

Long Chen was taking out all the forging materials he had plundered from the Soaring Dragon Company. When they all appeared on the ground in their private room, Guo Ran’s eyes almost popped out.

Guo Ran was a forging grandmaster, and ordinary materials were no longer able to enter his eyes. But the materials that Long Chen simply tossed to the ground were treasures that he had dreamed of obtaining.

“Boss, do you really have a collaboration with the Soaring Dragon Company? Why didn’t that little fellow Qian Duoduo inform me?” asked Guo Ran, feeling vexed.

“Qian Duoduo? You are in communication with him?” asked Long Chen in surprise.

Guo Ran was also surprised and asked, “Boss, did you not first find Qian Duoduo before looking for me? Qian Duoduo has an important position in the Soaring Dragon Company. I thought that…”

When Long Chen said that the Soaring Dragon Company was his personal treasury, Guo Ran had thought that it had a collaboration with him just like the Huayun Trading Company. After all, Qian Duoduo was present there and could pull some strings for Long Chen.

Just half a year ago, Qian Duoduo had come to the Alldevil Star-Field, representing the Soaring Dragon Company to buy some resources from the hands of the major powers.

At that time, although the Alldevil Star-Field’s situation had started to grow serious, it wasn’t so severe. The outside world and the Alldevil Star-Field’s experts still had opportunities to travel between star-fields.

When Qian Duoduo came to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College to talk about business, he recognized Guo Ran. The two of them instantly began to weep on each other’s shoulders.

The news of Long Chen in the Darklight Heaven was also transmitted to Guo Ran by Qian Duoduo. The latter was in the Soaring Dragon Company, which was a competitor of the Huayun Trading Company. As a result, he naturally wouldn’t miss any news that came from the Huayun Trading Company.

Qian Duoduo had asked Guo Ran how he was back then. At that time, Guo Ran was having a difficult time, and he hadn’t entered the four heroes yet.

Mentioning it now, it was rather funny. Qian Duoduo had come with countless guards and attendants, while Guo Ran had been doing so badly that he didn’t even have the face to see him.

At that time, Guo Ranhad simply said that everything was going fine in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. When Qian Duoduo asked him what he needed, thinking of using his personal authority to get Guo Ran some benefits, Guo Ran thickened his face to the point of saying that he wasn’t lacking anything, rejecting Qian Duoduo’s help.

Afterward, Qian Duoduo left, but he would often send letters to Guo Ran to maintain communications. But in the last two months, the Alldevil Star-Field was fully sealed off, which cut off all kinds of communications with the outside world.

Long Chen had never expected Qian Duoduo to be doing so well in the Soaring Dragon Company. He actually had such an important position that he was surrounded by guards wherever he went.

Back then, Qian Duoduo had met Long Chen in the sect’s recruitment trial. He then sold Long Chen a map, and that was how they had met. Long Chen felt that this fellow was truly good as an accountant, so Long Chen had him take charge of the entire Dragonblood Legion’s financial affairs.

Qian Duoduo was a natural business expert. Back then, Zheng Wenlong had even joked about taking Qian Duoduo away. For him to waste away as a fighter in the Dragonblood Legion was a waste of a genius.

“How did this fellow end up in the Soaring Dragon Company? With his smarts, wouldn’t he be in a good spot if he went to the Huayun Trading Company?” asked Long Chen.

“Hehe, boss, you don’t know? I actually asked the same thing. Why don’t you guess what he said? He said that the Soaring Dragon Company doesn’t conduct its business cleanly, and he is preparing for when the opportunity comes to suck up their wealth and leave. He wants to reestablish the savings of the Dragonblood Legion,” said Guo Ran with a chuckle.

Long Chen’s heart warmed. Qian Duoduo was only an ordinary warrior of the Dragonblood Legion, but he was always thinking of the Dragonblood Legion. To have such a brother, this life had been worth it.

“Boss, with these materials, I can spend a long time upgrading my armor. You should know that my Devil Dragon Battle Armor can be repeatedly upgraded. I’ve only set up a tenth of the runes, and I don’t know how strong it will be at its full potential. However, I still haven’t figured out all the designs, so I don’t quite dare to be rash. After all, once those runes are carved, they can’t be changed. I really want to find Xia Chen. If I can get his help, there are several problems that can be instantly resolved,” sighed Guo Ran.

Forging was something that Guo Ran had immense talent in, but runes weren’t his specialty. Although he had also learned many inscription techniques, as that aspect related to forging, he was lacking compared to Xia Chen. Even though in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, Guo Ran had reached the peak in this regard even amongst his peers, he knew that he was a far cry compared to Xia Chen. He could forge the complete Devil Dragon Battle Armor, but he couldn’t inscribe all the runes without Xia Chen’s aid.

The current runes that he had inscribed only occupied a very small portion of the armor. He didn’t dare to inscribe too many because the current Devil Dragon Battle Armor was like a sheet of white paper. He wanted to wait until Xia Chen was present before finishing the design. Without the complete design, he only inscribed the most basic runes.

“That’s fine. Just improve your basic runes so that you can unleash the maximum power of your physical body, and that’ll be enough. As for Xia Chen, I feel like he shouldn’t be that hard to find. Once the matter in the Alldevil Star-Field ends, we’ll go find him. Then the three of us brothers will join forces to handle a major affair,” said Long Chen.

As soon as Long Chen found Guo Ran, he thought of a certain possibility. That mysterious dragon expert had brought them into the immortal world and scattered everyone throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. The weird thing was, Guo Ran was skilled in forging, and he just so happened to fall into the Alldevil Star-Field where the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was.

If that was not a coincidence, then the others must have been sent to places that suited their strengths. In this case, Xia Chen would be sent to the place most suitable for him. In the Violet Flame Heaven, Long Chen happened to know of a place that stood at the pinnacle of runes and formations.

“Really?” Guo Ran instantly grew excited.

“He should be close, but let’s not think about that right now. Focus on raising your power quickly. I came to the Alldevil Star-Field for two goals. One is to gather certain ingredients for alchemy, while the other is to experience the power of the Alldevil race. I want to see what connection they have with Lord Brahma,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that Long Chen wanted medicinal ingredients, Guo Ran immediately sent people to check the storehouses. It went without saying that no one dared to ignore the orders of the current Guo Ran. They were very quick, and in just half a day, all the ingredients that Long Chen needed were gathered.

Seeing the mountains of medicinal ingredients, Long Chen nodded. Coming here was the right choice. Having come to the source, the precious and rare medicinal ingredients weren’t difficult to obtain at all.

This still wasn’t enough for Long Chen, but he wasn’t worried. This was only the stock in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. The other powers must have quite a bit in their hands as well. As long as Long Chen got them all, he estimated that it would be enough to condense the Violet Tower Star.

“Senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran, Xie Liuer and Leng Hui are outside asking to see you. Do you wish to see them?”

After Guo Ran took out all the ingredients for Long Chen, the two of them walked out of the room. Tu Hu immediately gave them a report.

“Tell them to scram. Why do I need to see them?” said Guo Ran darkly.

Tu Hu immediately turned, but Long Chen shook his head. “Call them in. You can’t hide from them forever. You have to face some things directly.”

Tu Hu looked at Guo Ran. Hence, Guo Ran helplessly said, “Go. It’s not like I dare to not listen to boss’s words.”

Tu Hu left and Long Chen patted Guo Ran’s shoulder. “If you can’t get over your anger, when you meet them, you can always give them a beating. I will support you.”

“Really?” Guo Ran was delighted.

“Definitely!”

Guo Ran laughed when he heard that and walked out with Long Chen.
