Chapter 3541

Long Chen finally saw a volcano with hundreds of Heavenly Flame Spirits concentrated on top of it.

They were all obediently kneeling around the mouth of the volcano, absorbing flaming lava that was slowly flowing out of it.

The lava had countless runes within it, and its flame energy was incomparably pure. It was definitely a great tonic for the Heavenly Flame Spirits.

Huo Linger’s eyes also lit up when she saw that lava. She told Long Chen that the runes inside of it were very pure, and she could absorb it freely.

Lava gushed out constantly. There were dozens of Heavenly Flame Spirits with five kinds of runes on their bodies right at the mouth of the volcano.

Behind them were a group of Heavenly Flame Spirits with four kinds of runes. Clearly, the strongest Heavenly Flame Spirits occupied the best spots. The weaker ones could only eat what the others left behind.

Although there were many Heavenly Flame Spirits, they still didn’t manage to eat it all. The lava flowed down, and Long Chen saw a large group of people using a formation to absorb the remaining lava, extracting those runes.

Within that group, Long Chen saw Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and hundreds of other experts. They had set up a huge formation that covered all of them. They were quietly absorbing those flame runes that flowed past them.

Other than them, many other lifeforms in the surroundings of the volcano were also absorbing the flame runes that gushed out of this volcano.

Everyone was in tacit agreement not to attack each other here, just like the Heavenly Flame Spirits. They were all afraid of breaking this fragile peace.

If those Heavenly Flame Spirits were to be provoked, they would have to flee. Right now, they were eating food from the tiger’s mouth, so they were paying constant attention to the Heavenly Flame Spirits. They were also watching the volcano’s eruption tempo. If it started to drop, they would immediately flee in case the Heavenly Flame Spirits decided that they were more appetizing.

It could be said that every single one of them was walking on thin ice. Eating this kind of meat was truly nerve-wracking.

By the time Long Chen arrived, there were already tens of thousands of experts standing around this giant volcano. There were no longer any spots. The lifeforms of the various races had occupied the best spots away from the Heavenly Flame Spirits, leaving only some corners and edges with a few flame runes.

“Hahaha, a group of fellows with no morals are actually picking through the dregs of what the Heavenly Flame Spirits eat? Isn’t that embarrassing?” Long Chen appeared, laughing up in the sky at these people.

This place was originally very quiet, with only the sound of the lava flowing. Hence, this shout made everyone jump. Some of them almost fled.

It was only when they saw that the Heavenly Flame Spirits were ignoring Long Chen and still devouring those flame runes that they relaxed. But there was already cold sweat on their foreheads. Just now, they had been given quite the fright. They all glared furiously at Long Chen.

Zhao Mingxuan and the others’ killing intent instantly exploded when they saw Long Chen. But they knew that now wasn’t the time to kill Long Chen. They could only endure.

“What are you looking at me for? You lack the ability to eat meat, so you eat the crap coming out of people’s butts. Can it be that others can’t point that out?” sneered Long Chen disdainfully.

Just like that, he swaggered straight toward the mouth of the volcano from the sky. That made everyone’s expression change.

“Stop right there! You idiot, if you disturb them, none of us will get any benefits!” shouted one lifeform furiously.

“You’re the idiot. Your whole family is idiots. Who do you think I am? I am Boss Long San. When Boss San arrives, the lands quake and the heavens howl. When Boss San leaves, ghosts sob and gods weep. Who can possibly stop Boss San’s footsteps? Some little Heavenly Flame Spirits? Let alone a fifth Heavenstage World King Heavenly Flame Spirit, even a Divine Venerate Heavenly Flame Spirit was subdued by Boss San! All of you shut your mouths. Why does a summer bug dare to talk?” Long Chen sneered. He had reached the area surrounded by Heavenly Flame Spirits.

The laws of the Heavenly Daos had started to change there, so Long Chen couldn’t fly in the air any longer. He walked right past a giant flame lizard.

His actions caused quite a few people to turn green. The cautious people were already leaving, afraid that Long Chen would anger these Heavenly Flame Spirits, implicating all of them.

“Stop!” People continued to roar at him.

Long Chen had reached the area of the Heavenly Flame Spirits. That was the current above all of them, so absorbing the flame runes there was better. But Long Chen still wasn’t satisfied and continued onward.

Seeing Long Chen arrogantly swaggering on top of the lizard’s back, not being careful at all, countless people’s eyes almost popped out.

Fortunately, that lizard remained focused on absorbing the flame runes and ignored Long Chen. Everyone then sighed with relief. However, their gazes were as sharp as blades when they looked at Long Chen now. If looks could kill, Long Chen would have died countless times already.

“A group of cowards.”

Seeing how frightened those people were, Long Chen displayed a disdainful expression toward them. He then continued onward, jumping onto another flame beast’s body before continuing to walk to the mouth of the volcano.

“This bastard, what is he trying to do?!”

Everyone was enraged. Long Chen had walked to the largest flow of lava. Its current was the one that flowed to Zhao Mingxuan and the others’ area. That should be the strongest place, yet he was still walking forward.

Suddenly, Long Chen came to a stop. Everyone sighed with relief, but Zhao Mingxuan and the others’ expressions changed. Long Chen was going to stop their current.

However, what infuriated them even more than that was that Long Chen actually didn’t absorb those flame runes. Instead, he pulled down his pants and directly pissed into the current. Seeing this, Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others were so enraged that veins almost popped on their foreheads.

“This goddamn bastard, I’ll kill him!” Flames raged in Wu Yang’s eyes. Long Chen was intentionally humiliating them.

However, at this point, Long Chen had reached the mouth of the volcano. There were fifth Heavenstage World King Heavenly Flame Spirits all over here. If they attacked now, it would be sending themselves to their deaths. They would only attack if they wanted to die along with Long Chen.

Clearly, they were unwilling to do such a thing, so they could only endure. However, they were reaching their limit. Long Chen hadn’t really damaged their lava current. The pee merely caused some steam on the lava, but it was still disgusting to think about it. If they continued to absorb it, wouldn’t it be like drinking his pee? If that spread, wouldn’t they be laughed at to death?

“Let’s go switch locations. We’ll go take a look.” Seeing that Long Chen was still safe and sound, Zhao Mingxuan clenched his teeth. Together with the others, they gave up this excellent location and walked upward.

When they gave up their spot, countless lifeforms quickly took it over, not standing on courtesy. But some were so brazen as to climb up as well.

“Oh? What are you lot thinking?!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen suddenly shouted and the immense sound shook the heavens, causing the void to rumble. Countless experts’ hearts almost leaped out of their chests. Without even thinking about it, countless people fled.
