Chapter 3538

At this time, Long Chen couldn’t even bother with whether the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net could endure. He first charged toward the gate with the fox. Once they got close to the gate, Long Chen grabbed the little fox and was about to throw it in.

However, before he threw it, the gate suddenly unleashed a strange suction force that drew him in.

“Hey, I don’t want to enter!”

Long Chen was startled, but before he could even struggle, the scenery around him changed. Golden light filled his eyes, and it was so bright that he couldn’t even open his eyes.

After a while, Long Chen gradually got used to the light here. When he saw the world that he was in, he was dumbfounded.

This was a peaceful and auspicious world. The ground was covered in golden lotuses, and they were endless. Some of them were large and some were small. The large ones filled the sky, while the small ones were only the size of a palm, swaying ever so slightly on the pools.

After Long Chen appeared, countless small foxes stuck their heads out from behind the lotuses, staring at Long Chen curiously. When they saw the little fox in Long Chen’s hand, they let out startled cries and flew over.

As for that little fox in his hand, it also grew excited and shot out, rejoicing with those other foxes. They ran atop the lotuses, seemingly expressing their joy.

Seeing that the fox had returned to its home, Long Chen turned to leave. He had no idea how long the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net would endure. If the vile dragon had yet to escape it, then he would still have a chance to escape with his life.

“Noble guest, please wait.”

Just as Long Chen was about to leave, a gentle voice rang out. A beautiful woman in a golden dress then appeared before Long Chen, standing on a golden lotus platform.

As soon as she appeared, the little fox jumped into her embrace and cried out excitedly.

“This child, you’re too naughty. How many times have I warned you not to get close to that spatial gate? But you never listen. If it weren’t for this noble guest’s aid, you would probably have died in the Heavenly Flame World. Now, are you going to listen?” The beautiful woman rebuked the little fox in her hands, but her gaze was one of love.

“Senior, I still have some urgent matters to attend to, so I’ll be leaving. Any thanks can wait until later.” Long Chen didn’t want to tarry any longer, so he cupped his fists to her.

“Don’t worry. I have frozen the time at the exit. Your net won’t be damaged, so you can rest easy,” said the beautiful woman.

Long Chen couldn’t help being stunned. Frozen time? What kind of heaven-defying ability was that? Just who was this woman?

“Noble guest, there’s no need to worry. Let me introduce myself. I am the one in control of this Golden Lotus World. All the lifeforms here are my children. You have risked your life to send my child back, and I am endlessly grateful.” The woman actually bowed to Long Chen, and Long Chen hastily returned it.

The Golden Lotus World? There was a Golden Lotus World within the nine heavens and ten lands? How come he had never heard of it?

Long Chen looked more closely at this world. This was a world of flames, but the flames here were not explosive. They gave off endless warmth. Standing here, he felt like his soul was being constantly cleansed.

“Noble sir is the first human to come ever since the Golden Lotus World was born. I have a few questions I wish to ask you. Can you give me some guidance?” The beautiful woman was very courteous. She was so respectful that Long Chen was getting embarrassed.

“Senior is the master of an entire world. There’s really no need to be so courteous. Otherwise, I’d feel restrained,” said Long Chen humbly.

He could not sense this woman’s cultivation base or spiritual fluctuations. She seemed to be one with this world. Long Chen had never seen such an existence before.

Furthermore, for some reason, he felt a certain reverence toward her. This reverence came from deep within his soul.

“What do you think is the kindest existence within the world?” asked the woman.

After a moment of thought, Long Chen said, “Water is the source of all life. It profits all things but doesn’t ask for anything. Thus, this little one believes that if we are talking about the kindest existence in this world, it would have to be water.” He didn’t know what her intentions were by asking such a question.

“Then what do you believe is the most evil existence in this world?” asked the woman.

Long Chen was dumbfounded. “This junior really has no way of answering that.”

If it was about the kindest existence, then his first thought was water. Because in the mortal world, all lifeforms had to stay close to water. Water was the source of all life. Thus, everyone knew just how important water was.

However, the most evil existence? Long Chen really was unable to say.

It didn’t matter if it was the devils, ghosts, or demons. They might be evil, but Long Chen had a feeling that their evil was not the worst of all.

“That’s alright. We are just casually chatting. Even if you are wrong, it won’t matter,” encouraged the woman.

Her smile was very warm. It was like an autumn breeze cleansing the soul.

“I’ve encountered many evil lifeforms, and I’ve also killed many. Rather than saying that their innate characters are evil, it would be better to say that they have lost their original characters after being clouded by desire, causing them to sink into becoming devils. Devils are not just one kind of race. All lifeforms who lose their core nature end up as devils. Sometimes, I even feel like I am the most evil existence in this world,” said Long Chen with a bitter smile.

“Why do you say that?” asked the woman curiously.

“Because when some people enrage me, I can’t help wanting to crush them. I don’t even know where such an evil desire comes from. I pity them, but they don’t pity me. I can let them off, but they will always try to kill me. Sometimes, I feel an impulse to kill everyone who opposes me in this world. I want all lifeforms to prostrate themselves beneath my feet. I want them unable to even form the thought of defying me,” said Long Chen.

“Isn’t this what all experts want? Follow me and prosper, defy me and die? That seems to be the style of many experts,” said the woman with a smile.

Long Chen shook his head. “My current opponents are precisely those kinds of experts. They make a fool out of other lives. I hate them, and I look down on them. If I were to be the same as them, wouldn’t I have turned myself into an existence that I hate and look down on?”

“Do you sometimes feel very lost, not knowing what exactly you should do? Also, you don’t know if what you’re doing is right. You are afraid of doing something wrong and afraid of ultimately becoming an existence that you detest. Especially when you are lonely, do you keep questioning your heart?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“How… how did you know?” Long Chen was shocked. In that instant, he felt like all his secrets had been seen through by her.

Furthermore, when he looked into her eyes, he felt his dark energy crashing angrily like waves. She seemed to have seen through the other self within his body.

“You are a good child. Perhaps you are the one I am waiting for… This seed is yours. I hope it can illuminate a path within your dark world.”

She then opened her hand, revealing a golden lotus seed. At that moment, the entire Golden Lotus World’s lotuses instantly blossomed. Endless golden light dripped down from the stamens and pistils of every lotus and flowed into this lotus seed.

That golden lotus seed seemed to come to life. It slowly floated into Long Chen’s hand.
