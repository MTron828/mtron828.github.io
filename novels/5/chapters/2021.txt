People were somewhat surprised by this reaction. Causing a fuss was brushed off with just a word? Shouldn’t the two of them be punished or at least harshly warned?

They looked toward Long Chen. Could Man Batian have some secret connection with Pill Valley?

As for the wretched man, he cursed as he walked away, looking back to make a throat-slitting gesture at Long Chen. But after being glared at by the elder, he obediently walked into the channel.

Very quickly, Di Feng and the others all entered. Di Feng casually looked back at Long Chen, but he didn’t say anything.

After the ancient family alliance’s experts walked in, the second batch was the Xuan Beasts. They had drawn the second lot.

When these Xuan Beasts walked by, Long Chen saw Xiong Tianba glaring at him viciously. He said, “Man Batian, just wait. Once we’re in the Brahma secret realm, I’ll make you regret being born in this world!”

“Fuck off!” Long Chen slapped him in the face. The two of them were too close, and Xiong Tianba hadn’t expected Long Chen to attack in front of the Pill Valley’s Elders.

An explosive sound rang out as Long Chen threw his whole force behind this slap. Xiong Tianba not only flew back, but the force knocked back the surrounding Xuan Beasts as well. Hundreds of people tumbled back, causing chaos.

“Stop!” shouted the elder furiously. When the dust settled, it revealed Long Chen standing in his original location, with Xiong Tianba lying in the distance, half his head caved in.

The hundreds of Xuan Beasts were lying on the ground as well. This infuriated all the Xuan Beasts present as this was a slap to all of them. Hence, they took out their weapons, about to attack Long Chen when the elder’s shout stopped them.

“This Man Batian goes too far! I don’t mind not entering the Brahma secret realm. I still have to kill him! The Xuan Beasts’ pride cannot be trampled upon!” roared one Xuan Beast. The others agreed. Although not all of them were fully loyal to Peng Wanli, when a human bullied them, they were strangely united.

The Xuan Beasts surrounded Long Chen. As long as one person gave the order, they would tear him to pieces.

“Everyone, calm down. I have a few things to say first.” The elder looked at something in the sky and then smiled.

“It doesn’t matter what you say, Man Batian must die.” Xiong Tianba crawled and roared. That slap had been exceptionally vicious. It had almost crushed his head.

“You’re wrong. He isn’t Man Batian. He is the one claimed to be the Martial Heaven Continent’s strongest junior expert, the one who dominates other peak heavenly geniuses in the same realm. Well, am I right?” The elder looked at Long Chen with a confident smile.

“Long Chen, he is Long Chen?” All the experts were shocked. Even Xiong Tianba was stunned.

As expected, he had been noticed. Long Chen smiled. He wiped his face, revealing his true appearance. At the same time, his aura changed from Man Batian’s aura.

“Big brother Long Chen!”

Qi Xuan let out a startled cry as she hadn’t expected Long Chen to really come. However, she immediately turned pale. She knew that there was no escaping from here with so many experts present and considering that this was the core of Pill Valley.

Qi Fengxue couldn’t help sighing deeply. She didn’t know why Long Chen would do such a thing. Was this any different than sending himself to his death? She wanted to save him, but she didn’t have the ability.

“Long Chen, hahaha, I didn’t think that you would actually come. Let’s see just how you escape today.” Xie Luo couldn’t help laughing. His aura erupted as he prepared to fight.

“If it weren’t for me being busy last time, I would have killed you already. A defeated person doesn’t have the right to speak.” Long Chen glanced at Xie Luo indifferently.

“Long Chen, you’re quite arrogant. Today, let me, Leng Wufeng, test just how strong you are.” From amongst the crowd, a man walked forward. Long Chen had seen him on his way here. The light of the Sword Dao hung around him, and thousands of sharp swords were surging within the light around him.

“It’s the Blood Spirit Sword Sect’s Leng Wufeng.” People whispered, recognizing this person. He came from a neutral sect. The Blood Spirit Sword Sect hadn’t made an appearance on the Martial Heaven Continent in many years. Now that they reappeared, only a few people knew of them.

“It would be best if you didn’t. Anyone who attacks me will be viewed as my enemy. If you want to attack me, you should be prepared to die first,” said Long Chen.

“Haha, truly arrogant. You’re already a trapped turtle, yet you can still say such a thing,” laughed Leng Wufeng. The light around him began to sharpen.

“Wait!” Long Chen suddenly raised a hand.

“What? Are you finally afraid? Is your fame all fake?” sneered Leng Wufeng.

Long Chen frowned. “You should be a sword cultivator. Sword cultivators are arrogant, not out of pride but out of confidence. However, it can’t be out of overconfidence. Based on what a fool you are, it’s clear you’ve never suffered before. If you had encountered me earlier, you would have become a better person.”

Long Chen’s words were definitely arrogant. However, they could not be called inappropriate either because he had the qualifications to be arrogant. Those qualifications were earned through his battles in the past few years. Whether they were his enemy or not, everyone had to agree that the name of the Eastern Madman suited him.

“Arrogance!” Leng Wufeng’s eyes grew cold, and he suddenly took out a translucent sword. Not only was it hard to track with the naked eye, but it was even difficult to sense spiritually.

Despite being right there, it was almost impossible to sense it. Once it was attacking, who could block its attack trajectory? Quite a few experts were shaken.

They had truly entered the great era. All kinds of monsters were being born, each more monstrous than the last.

The other experts retreated. They wished to see just how powerful Leng Wufeng was to dare to challenge Long Chen. Although the power he was showing was very strong, not one person thought that he could beat Long Chen. In their minds, there might not be anyone in their generation who could defeat Long Chen alone.

The concept of Long Chen being unrivaled within the same realm was firmly imprinted in their hearts. In fact, many people were wondering just how many people would be accompanying Long Chen to his death here today. Those people retreated especially far.

Other than those with great confidence, no one would dare to face Long Chen directly. Even Xie Luo retreated, afraid of being the first unlucky fellow to be targeted by Long Chen.

Many people wanted to defeat Long Chen to wrest away his current glory, the main thing was that no matter how great that glory was, their lives were more important.

The ones who could come here were all monstrous geniuses. However, other than Leng Wufeng, no one went forward to fight.

As for the fact that Leng Wufeng dared to challenge Long Chen, no one praised his bravery. In truth, they sneered at him for his rashness. He was giving others a chance to see Long Chen’s power.

Long Chen didn’t even look at Leng Wufeng who was in his attack posture. Toward the elder of Pill Valley he asked, “How did you recognize me?”

The elder laughed. “Long Chen, although you are Pill Valley’s enemy, I have to admire your courage. You really dared to come here. In truth, we knew you had come the instant you entered Pill Valley. To prevent what happened last time, we imprinted your spiritual fluctuations into the grand formation. Your disguise was excellent though, and we couldn’t tell who you were. But we knew you had come.”

Only then did Long Chen realize that because of the matter of Long San, Pill Valley had made some new preparations. Considering how much he fought in public, Pill Valley was definitely capable of recording his spiritual fluctuations.

Each cultivator’s spiritual fluctuations were different. Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was extremely strong and special, so it wasn’t strange that they could sense it.

However, while they had sensed it, it hadn’t been good enough for them to pinpoint where he was. That was because his spiritual fluctuations were disguised with Man Batian’s. Although a trace of his own spiritual fluctuations had leaked out, it was too small and dispersed for them to track. Moreover, to find his specific spiritual fluctuations amongst a crowd of million experts? Impossible.

This made Long Chen’s guard rise. In the future, when he disguised himself as someone else, he would have to fully seal his Spiritual Strength.

The elder said, “The first time we suspected who you were was when that faker was killed. Your expression was too calm at that moment. However, it was just a suspicion, and we couldn’t be sure...”

“So, you sent that pervert to test me.” Long Chen nodded with a faint smile.
