Chapter 4725 Confidence

Hundreds of thousands of experts filled the plaza, and most of them remained seated in silence, their gazes apathetic. Only a small portion of them were whispering to each other.

Upon their arrival, Long Chen and Qian Feng found a suitable spot for the two of them to sit. Shortly after they did, another batch of people entered, led by Qi Yifeng. He glared at Long Chen before walking to the front and claiming a seat. As Qian Feng had guessed, Qi Yifeng had arrived early and taken a seat for himself, only stepping out momentarily to "greet" Qian Feng upon receiving news of his arrival, which ended in a humiliating slap.

Long Chen examined the surroundings and saw that everyone here was young with an elusive aura. To his surprise, many of them were nine star Heavenly Doyens.

However, despite their lofty status, they lacked a certain depth of power, appearing somewhat superficial in comparison. It was akin to the disparity between a muscular man and an obese man. The difference was visible to Long Chen.

Their auras paled in comparison to the nine star Heavenly Doyens he had encountered at the gate to the ninth heaven. This realization puzzled Long Chen. Could it be that the Lifehunter race possessed their own method of cultivating nine star Heavenly Doyens?

All of a sudden, a realization struck Long Chen, prompting him to check the Heavenly Dao Tree, and as expected, he saw three nine star Heavenly Doyen Fruits on it.

Among these fruits, one originated from the Lifehunter race’s ambush on the academy, while the other two came from the two guards he had slain during his journey to this island. With the Dragonblood Legion having consumed his Heavenly Doyen Pills, Long Chen hadn’t paid much attention to these fruits.

However, as Long Chen observed these fruits, he was stunned. Unlike the others, these fruits appeared shriveled and discolored, bearing folds and wrinkles as if they were decaying. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

There really is a problem. They are man-made nine star Heavenly Doyens. No wonder their auras are strange.

No wonder Long Chen didn’t sense anything when he killed that fellow in the academy. All of these nine star Heavenly Doyens were defective, which meant that the Heavenly Doyen Fruits coming from them were essentially useless. Long Chen was about to pluck them when he saw one of them suddenly fall on its own.

When it landed on the ground, the black soil instantly devoured it. Long Chen observed this scene with keen interest, realizing that the Heavenly Dao Tree was absorbing the fruit as nourishment for its growth.

When the Heavenly Dao Fruits filled the tree, some would naturally fall. However, the black soil wouldn’t absorb true Heavenly Dao Fruits. Otherwise, Long Chen wouldn’t have managed to accumulate so many of them.

At this moment, someone interrupted Long Chen’s thoughts.

“Boss San, that fellow is the one in charge of the treasury. He is the grandson of the Soul Assassination Hall’s hall master,” whispered Qian Feng, gesturing at one figure in front of their seats.

Following Qian Feng’s line of sight, Long Chen noticed a short figure seated prominently at the forefront, mostly covered by the chair. He wondered how Qian Feng could spot this guy when this shorty was barely visible from their seats.

In any case, Long Chen’s target was the treasury, not this guy, so he just glanced at the map of this minor world. It was quite problematic to move around as there were too many people here. One wrong step and his identity would be exposed. Hence, Long Chen couldn’t help but feel a bit anxious.

How do I get to the treasuries...? Long Chen eyed his surroundings, seeing countless sentries stationed around the area. It seemed impossible to bypass them unnoticed.

All of a sudden, Long Chen’s eyes brightened, and he called the Earth Cauldron. “Senior!”

“What?” responded the Earth Cauldron, its tone somewhat wary.

“Senior, with your omniscient divine abilities—”

“You... are you suggesting that I steal the treasury for you!?” interjected the Earth Cauldron.

“This isn't stealing, it's...snatching! We're doing it openly!” Long Chen retorted with a mischievous grin.

“Stop joking. I am one of the noble ten great primal chaos divine items. How can I do something as immoral as robbing people? If this news were to spread, how would I have the face to live in this world?”

“Don’t you think it’s too late to say this kind of thing? It’s not like it’s the first time...”

“What are you talking about?” asked the Earth Cauldron.

“Cough

, do you remember a certain medicinal field...”

“Alright, don’t talk about that!”

The Earth Cauldron instantly recalled how it had helped Long Chen “pick” some medicinal ingredients from some medicinal field so that it could recover faster.

“Anyway, I’m not stealing anything for you. At most, I’ll help you seal off the entrance to the treasury and prevent others from entering.”

Hearing its answer, Long Chen was delighted. If the Earth Cauldron agreed to be his partner in crime, then the treasury was basically already in his hand.

Since there was nothing to worry about, Long Chen relaxed into his chair, casually crossing his legs and propping them up on the back of the chair in front of him.

However, someone was sitting there, and he instantly stood up to glare at Long Chen.

Without hesitation, Long Chen used his hand as a support and delivered a swift kick to the poor guy's face. “What are you staring at?” he snapped.

Caught off guard by the unexpected attack, this guy had no time to react, and the kick sent him hurtling toward the highest platform of the plaza.

Several elders appeared on the platform the moment that person came flying over. One of them caught him and shouted furiously, “What do you think you’re doing?!”

The kick left this guy bloodied and in a state of shock. Seeing the elder holding him, he instantly turned pale and stuttered, “Enforcement Elder, I... I... No... it was him...”

He was so nervous that he couldn’t even speak clearly. The Enforcement Elder’s expression darkened as he listened, before abruptly tossing the guy aside.

“The hall master and emissary are about to arrive. All of you better behave yourselves. If anything else happens, I’ll flay your skin,” threatened the elder.

The poor guy hastily flew back to his seat, quivering with fear. He was well aware of the Enforcement Elder’s cruelty, and the mere thought of facing his wrath sent shivers down this guy’s spine.

“Stay down and don't block my view,” Long Chen commanded, maintaining his arrogant posture with his feet resting on the chair of the intimidated poor guy.

The poor guy didn’t dare to say anything or even ask Long Chen to put his feet down. He remained frozen in place, silently hoping that the Enforcement Elder would notice Long Chen’s disrespectful behavior.

Unfortunately, due to their distance from the platform and the crowded surroundings, the Enforcement Elder remained oblivious to it.

Beside Long Chen, Qian Feng was really taken aback, unable to fathom the background of someone who would dare to act so arrogantly in this place.

As the entire plaza fell into silence, Long Chen’s gaze shifted toward the platform where two figures had just appeared.
