Chapter 4070 Repaying Kindness With Enmity

As the Ghost Ship sped forward, endless demonic beasts appeared ahead of them. To their surprise, the majority of these demonic beasts had reached the Immortal King realm, and their numbers were staggering.

When those sea demons saw the Ghost Ship, they fled in terror. However, they were too slow compared to it. Thus, when the Ghost Ship passed by them, their bodies stiffened, and they simply floated on the surface of the water, dead.

The Ghost Ship’s terrifying aura was something that even Heaven Venerate demonic beasts didn’t dare to underestimate, so these Immortal King sea demons simply died after being exposed to its aura.

Wherever the Ghost Ship passed, sea demons floated to the surface of the water. There was no need for the Dragonblood warriors to do anything.

However, they didn’t slack off either. They dragged the corpses on board, as they knew that Long Chen was always gathering corpses.

Long Chen directly tossed them into the primal chaos space, letting the black soil devour them. After all, the growth of the Fusang Trees and the Moon Trees required an incredible amount of life energy. They were like bottomless pits. Long Chen could use as many of these corpses as he could get his hands on.

Although the Fusang Trees and the Moon Trees were still in their youth, the amount of life energy that they provided him was also incredible. Other than his eye, any wounds to his physical body could simply be ignored now.

Long Chen and the others rapidly approached the landmass and saw that millions of sea demons had already climbed onto the land.

Through the masses of sea demons, they were vaguely able to see rays of saber-light and sweeping Sword Qi. So, there were human experts fighting the sea demons. At this moment, the ground was already dyed red from fresh blood, and mountains of corpses were piling up.

“There is at least a Heaven Venerate here. It seems that we came for nothing.” Long Chen sensed a powerful aura deep within the battlefield and couldn’t help smiling.

Although there were many sea demons here, even the strongest one was only at the level of an Earth Venerate. Thus, as long as there was a single Heaven Venerate here, then everything was under control.

However, the Ghost Ship was already charging to the shore, so there was no time to turn around. They simply allowed the Ghost Ship to smash into the land.

The Ghost Ship then smashed a ditch into the land, killing all the sea demons around the ditch.

Thanks to its speed, in an instant, the Ghost Ship came crashing thousands of miles into the land, only coming to a stop at the heart of the battlefield.

This was where the human race had set up their defenses. Here, countless experts were borrowing the power of special equipment to fight off the sea demons.

When the Ghost Ship arrived, countless sea demons died, and only some stronger ones and those that were further away managed to flee like the retreating tide, leaving the battlefield empty.

At this moment, tens of millions of human experts could be seen in the defensive formation, staring in shock at the giant Ghost Ship. They were terrified. For them, this Ghost Ship was even more terrifying than the endless sea demons.

“Uncle Tree, keep your cultivation base concealed,” transmitted Long Chen. Uncle Tree nodded and then suppressed his aura to the peak of the World King realm.

“Who are you?!”

After a moment, the people defending finally noticed Long Chen and the others standing at the head of the Ghost Ship.

The speaker was a fair-skinned man with an acceptable appearance. However, he appeared incredibly arrogant, as if he didn’t place anyone else in his eyes.

Long Chen and the others had brought the Ghost Ship to drive away the sea demons, essentially helping them out, but that person wasn’t the slightest bit thankful. Instead, he seemed like he was interrogating criminals.

“It seems that we were being meddlesome.” Guo Ran curled his lips. Looking at the experts before them, he detected expressions of shock, curiosity, and hostility. But the only thing he didn’t see was gratitude.

The feeling of being snubbed despite their good intentions irritated them. With no other way to steer the Ghost Ship any longer, Long Chen and the others got off and prepared to leave.

However, while Long Chen and the others wanted to leave, the human experts didn’t allow them to go. As soon as they came off the Ghost Ship, that fair-skinned man led his people to block them.

“I asked you a question! Who are you? What is this Ghost Ship?! Are you mute?!” he shouted, angry at Long Chen and the others’ disregard.

“I have no duty to answer you. If you don’t want to die, scram.” Long Chen frowned and looked at this man coldly.

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others were also irritated. Were these people fools? Was this how they treated people who helped them?

If Long Chen and the others hadn’t come, who knew how many of their people would have died? Were they even humans? Even animals wouldn’t repay kindness with enmity, right?

“Hahahaha, what a huge joke! Who do you think you are to talk to me, Ye Wenxuan, like that?!” This fair-skinned man was a late stage Immortal King. Despite that, his aura was extremely powerful. He was a Double Supreme, and he intentionally unleashed his divine pressure when he laughed so that his voice shook the sky.

Before this, he had been leading everyone against the tide of sea demons, unstoppable on the battlefield. But just as he was in the zone, Long Chen and the others suddenly charged in, driving away all the sea demons and taking away his glory.

Furthermore, they were actually driving a Ghost Ship, shocking him, as well as making him feel a bit envious. However, the thing that truly drove him mad was the beautiful Yu Qingxuan. She had her arm wrapped around Long Chen’s arm the entire time.

“I don’t care who you are, what your status is, or which backer you have. Don’t try to probe who I am, and don’t try to anger me to test my bottom line. Otherwise, by the time you regret it, it will be too late.” Long Chen looked at Ye Wenxuan frostily.

As expected, the information about this place was accurate. The native experts here could instantly tell who was an outsider to this heaven. Although they were all part of the human race, these natives would not welcome you and would even think of ways to make things difficult for you.

Seeing that Long Chen could drive a Ghost Ship and also came from outside this heaven, it seemed that this Ye Wenxuan wanted him to hand over his secrets first.

Long Chen intentionally glanced at a certain location behind the defenses. It was the place where he sensed the powerful aura of a Heaven Venerate.

However, this Heaven Venerate did not reveal themself, intentionally leaving things to Ye Wenxuan. Clearly, they didn’t view Long Chen and the others seriously. They simply wanted him to hand over his secrets.

“It seems that you’ll refuse until you’re forced to. Then I won’t waste more words with you. Capture them all!” Ye Wenxuan sneered and waved his hand. As he did so, dozens of experts stepped forward.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The next moment, with a flash of cold light, dozens of heads flew into the air, accompanied by a rain of blood.
