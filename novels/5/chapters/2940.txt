Chapter 2929 You Talk Too Much

The flying boat sped off, passing by many cities from above. From the sky, Long Chen and the others could see countless disciples rushing about, but they looked like ants working on their lair.

“Before this, I thought that they would be the ultimate peak of my life,” said Li Cai as he watched those figures rushing about.

Those people were wearing robes of the inner academy, but they were just ordinary inner academy disciples. After reaching the Divine Flame realm, they were directly brought in with no test.

However, even as inner academy disciples, their treatment was only slightly better than outer academy disciples. It was a far cry from the privilege of the elite disciples.

The area that the flying boat was passing through was filled with ordinary disciples. It was because the elite disciples occupied different areas. The two of them were simply worlds apart.

Li Cai was feeling emotional. He had thought that in this lifetime, becoming one of these ordinary disciples would be the best thing he could ever do.

In fact, just before they met Long Chen, they were already preparing to break through into the Divine Flame realm and become ordinary inner academy disciples.

However, due to Long Chen, their destinies had completely changed. Now, they were already core disciples of the inner academy, and even the hands of their families couldn’t reach here.

They had fully escaped the bindings of their families. The High Firmament Academy’s elite disciples were existences that their families wouldn’t dare to touch.

“Starting today, I’ll work hard at cultivating with boss San. Once I control my family, I’ll bring Ying Bao, Luo Cang, Li Yi, and the others’ close family in so that they can be at peace.” Li Cai clenched his fists. The people he mentioned were all existences that were part of the ‘Elite Group’. However, they had died in the divine competition.

They all had similar experiences and their own worries. With their deaths, their wishes would be passed on to others to accomplish.

“We’ll all strive to become experts together. We won’t endure other people’s suppression. I am not going back to those days where anyone could slaughter me.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The other disciples were also emotional. Long Chen had truly transformed them. Now, they saw hope that they had never seen before. Rather than returning to their former days, they would rather die.

Originally, they should have become any one of those bustling figures within the cities. But due to one person, everything had changed.

Seeing this, Long Chen smiled and raised his thumb at them. These fellows were finally starting to become manly after the baptism of the battlefield.

“Boss San, you really are my lucky star,” said one disciple sincerely.

“You’re wrong. I am a star of calamity. Wherever I go, blood and slaughter follow. Only people with tough enough lives are able to survive beside me. If you wish to follow me, you better be prepared to risk your life. There is no such thing as reaping without sowing in this world. If you wish to be dignified, you must endure hardship that others don’t see.” Long Chen shook his head. With his terrible luck, to say that he was a lucky star was the greatest irony.

“Brother San, you must have suffered a lot before,” said Zhong Ling.

“Remember, the greater a person’s light, the greater the shadow cast behind them is. You always have to invest more than you gain. Don’t envy others for their amazing backgrounds, talents, or resources. No one can obtain more than others without effort. You might think that Chu Kuang obtained many things that others couldn’t obtain in their entire lifetime, but just because he didn’t pay for it doesn’t mean that the first generation patriarch of the Chu family didn’t pay an unimaginable price to guarantee the safety of his descendants. You might not be a rich second generation, but you can work hard to become the rich first generation. Furthermore, is being a rich second generation really so amazing? Your boss San likes to put those arrogant second generation fellows in their place,” said Long Chen.

The disciples laughed. Li Cai and the others could be said to have decent backgrounds, but compared to Chu Kuang, there was a huge gap. The ordinary disciples of the Unfettered Alliance were even further away.

“From a point of self inferiority, many people feel jealous, envious, and defeated, simply blaming their origins for not being good enough, blaming the heavens for not being fair. They often think that if they were born in that person’s spot, they would be so and so. That kind of thinking is very dangerous. After thinking like that, you can let yourself think that all your losses weren’t your mistake, but simply your bad fate. Remember, luck is what the modest victors say, while fate is what the losers use as an excuse. Be prepared. This world is fair, and good things must be fought for. The better the resources, the more intense the fighting. If you think that just by entering the inner academy as elite disciples that you’ll have an easy life, then you are gravely mistaken. I can promise that the competition in the inner academy is even more intense and crueler. You also saw those fellows just now. Four Peak experts are simply patrolling around like they’re nothing. If you don’t work hard, then you might be stuck being a dung picker in the inner academy,” warned Long Chen.

Although some of his words were a bit exaggerated, they were reality. Despite having not entered the inner academy yet, he could already smell blood. Hence, he had to give these excited children a dose of reality now.

“Brother San, we understand. We’re not afraid. We were ready to give up our lives during the divine competition. If the path ahead of us is filled with pitfalls, then we will cross them fearlessly,” said Mu Qingyun while grabbing the hilt of her sword.

Long Chen nodded. This warning was just to avoid them being caught off guard and resulting in a calamitous drop in morale. That would be bad.

Their current morale was soaring, and that had to be maintained in order to keep a strong unity and drive. Only then could they obtain better lives in the inner academy and gain better resources.

At this moment, another barrier appeared in front of them. After the flying boat passed through, they saw a giant gate ahead of them, and over ten people were guarding this gate.

It was forbidden to travel using flying boats further. Hence, Mu Qingyun stopped the flying boat here, and everyone walked off.

“Did you come to check in? Where did you come from?” asked one of the Four Peak experts guarding the gate frostily.

Everyone was startled. What did he mean by where did they come from? Was that not obvious?

Mu Qingyun saw that this person was standing in front of Long Chen. Worried about Long Chen slapping him in response, she hastily said, “We are outer academy disciples who passed through the divine competition. We’re here to check in.”

Mu Qingyun passed over a special tablet that was proof of their new status.

That person received it and then eyed Long Chen oddly. “Why are you not wearing disciple robes?”

“This is senior apprentice-brother Long Chen. He also has another status as an instructor of the God Institute and is permitted to not wear disciple robes,” said Mu Qingyun quickly.

That person eyed Long Chen up and down. He sneered, “The outer academy’s instructors are all a bunch of useless scammers. Such a person can also enter the inner academy?”

“You talk too much.”

Finally, Long Chen slapped him in the face. As he crumpled to the ground, the surrounding experts immediately surrounded Long Chen and the others.

“Capture him!”

These Four Peak experts attacked Long Chen at once, their fists hurtling toward him.
