Chapter 3369 Ghost Sovereign Mark

Even without looking back, Long Chen could sense an aura similar to Leng Yueyan’s. But it possessed a gentleness that Leng Yueyan did not have. Long Chen then rubbed her hands. “Cangyue, I missed you.”

Long Chen looked back and stared into Ming Cangyue’s eyes. There was a gentle and soft emotion within that cold gaze.

Leng Yueyan’s gaze also had warmth in it when she looked at him, but that warmth was sharp. That was the greatest difference between the two of them. Even without sensing their auras, just their eyes were enough for him to differentiate them.

Leng Yueyan had left at some point, as if giving them space. Ming Cangyue then gently rubbed Long Chen’s gaze. She smiled sweetly. “Originally, I also hated you, but Yueyan has punished you, so I won’t punish you again.”

Ming Cangyue tightly hugged Long Chen, pressing her face against his chest and listening to his powerful heartbeats. At this point, it seemed that any spoken words would be superfluous.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen brushed Ming Cangyue’s hair and kissed her forehead. Smelling her fragrance, he suddenly had a strange thought.

He couldn’t help asking, “If you and Leng Yueyan are one, and she is your good side… I feel like this seems a bit mixed!”

Ming Cangyue giggled. “You mean she seems more evil than me? Are you not afraid that she will continue to stab you?”

“I am afraid, but she definitely won’t kill me. If I don’t ask though, I might die from curiosity,” laughed Long Chen.

“You fool. How can you not know? Have you forgotten what you told me to do?” Ming Cangyue scolded Long Chen with a smile.

“What did I tell you to do? I actually have forgotten. Are you going to hit me for that?” Long Chen scratched his head awkwardly. He really forgot what he had said all that time ago.

Ming Cangyue glared at him. “Your memory is terrible. The two of us were originally two opposite extremes. I sent my good side into the Martial Heaven Continent’s Corrupt path so that she would be dyed black, erasing that goodness. But because the two of us… with you…” She blushed and glared at him viciously before continuing, “Because of our relationship with you, we became two separate souls. Your appearance changed our fates. Just as you said, there are no absolutes in this world. There is no absolute good or absolute evil. Based on what you said, I am evil, but my heart has goodness. My goodness is all used on you, while she…”

“Are you saying that the bit of evil in her is all focused on me?” Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Wasn’t that too much of a con?

“Well, it’s not entirely because of you. If she didn’t torment you a bit, she would feel like she was the same as me. She wants her own special position, you know,” said Ming Cangyue, covering a smile.

“Oh? What is that mark on your forehead?” Ming Cangyue suddenly stiffened and stared in shock at Long Chen’s forehead. Long Chen actually thought it was somewhere that Leng Yueyan had bitten him, and just as he was about to explain, Ming Cangyue’s expression changed.

“This is the mark of the Ghost Dao?! You have had interactions with the Ghost Dao?!”

“I went onto a Ghost Ship…”

Long Chen was also surprised. He quickly explained what had happened with the Ghost Ship. Was this mark left behind by the Ghost Ship? Had he really become an underworld ghost seed?

“Yueyan, that fool, she didn’t notice?! This mark is the most terrifying mark of the Ghost Sovereign! This is trouble.” Ming Cangyue’s smile vanished, replaced with shock and worry.

Just at this moment, Leng Yueyan returned. She came to Long Chen and carefully examined his forehead. Her expression also became grave. “How can this be? How can the Ghost Sovereign have set its sights on Long Chen? Isn’t that-”

Leng Yueyan suddenly shut her mouth, as if she couldn’t speak of something taboo.

“It hasn’t set its sights on Long Chen, but on his heart-devil. Long Chen, do you have a heart-devil?” asked Ming Cangyue.

“Yes. Is that a problem?” admitted Long Chen.

“How can it not be a problem?! Don’t you realize that the Ghost Sovereign’s mark is focused on your heart-devil? The Ghost Sovereign is the master of one of the six Daos, the ghost world. This mark will constantly draw out and seduce your heart-devil. Once you are devoured by your heart-devil, you will become a puppet of the Ghost Sovereign. Fortunately, it has been noticed in time. We don’t dare to touch that mark, however, Leng Yueyan and I can temporarily seal your heart-devil. That way, you will be safe for now at least. We can think of something else later,” said Ming Cangyue. The two of them began to form hand seals.

“No, no!” Long Chen hastily waved his hands.

“What?” The two of them were startled.

“My heart-devil is another will of mine. He is me, and I am him. If I use your power to seal him, he will look down on me. I believe that he will not be influenced by the Ghost Dao’s mark because he is also afraid of me looking down on him,” said Long Chen.

If his heart-devil was sealed, it would be like losing a part of his soul. Then his Dao-heart would never be clear again. It wasn’t worth it.

Furthermore, that mysterious dragon expert had long since warned him that his dark energy could not be suppressed. The more he suppressed it, the greater it would fight back.

His experience also agreed with the dragon expert’s words. The more he suppressed his dark energy, the more it grew. If Long Chen allowed the two of them to seal his heart-devil, when his heart-devil broke free of its seal, he would definitely be doomed.

Furthermore, his heart-devil could be considered a case of inner turmoil. If he managed to figure out the conflict, his heart-devil would also disappear. There was no need to be so nervous.

As for that so-called Ghost Sovereign’s mark, he wasn’t afraid. He and his heart-devil were a part of him. No one understood him better than himself.

“Alright.”

Since he was so sure, the two of them acquiesced. Now also wasn’t the right time to seal his heart-devil. Doing such a thing would use up a great deal of their core energy. As a large battle was going to start soon, they couldn’t be so careless.

Furthermore, Long Chen was not afraid of his heart-devil, nor did he dislike it or view it with hatred. He was surprisingly relaxed, to the point that Ming Cangyue wouldn’t have noticed Long Chen’s heart-devil without the Ghost Sovereign’s mark.

When Long Chen asked for more details about this Ghost Sovereign’s mark, Ming Cangyue simply shook her head and said it was a very taboo name. It would be best not to mention it in the future.

The Ghost Sovereign’s mark made the two of them nervous, but Long Chen seemed very relaxed. He then told them about some interesting news in the immortal world to relax them.

Just as Long Chen was spouting a bunch of nonsense, the ancient city’s grand formation suddenly activated. An ear-piercing alarm split the air.

“They’re here!”

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue shot up and gazed into the distance. A spatial gate had opened there, and countless figures were pouring out of it.
