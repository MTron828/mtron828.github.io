Chapter 3342 Auspicious Crane Dance

The scabbard glowed and countless ancient runes lit up on it. After that, an ancient desolate aura erupted, forming a light barrier.

The five Devil Eye Water Lilies’ attacks could destroy stars, but they shattered on contact with that barrier, unable to shake it in the slightest.

“It seems that it really is the scabbard of the High Firmament Divine Sword.” Long Chen stared closely at it. This was a priceless treasure with a deep background and history.

Back then, after Enpuda’s clone had descended, the dean used this scabbard to drive him away. Enpuda was so terrified of it at that time.

Since Bai Zhantang had brought it out as well, clearly, the High Firmament Academy was set on reclaiming the seventh branch academy.

Furthermore, the academy had also sent thirty-six Immortal King elders as reinforcements. They activated the scabbard with their combined forces, summoning an indestructible defensive domain. With this, the High Firmament Academy finally revealed its terrifying foundation!

“Damnable human race, you’ve invaded our territory! Are you declaring war on the Undying race?!” A furious roar rang out, but it was unknown from which Devil Eye Water Lily it came.

“Can the Devil Eye Water Lilies represent the entire Undying race? You’re overestimating yourselves, no? Furthermore, this place was originally the territory of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch academy. When did it become your territory?” sneered Bai Zhantang.

“We’ve occupied this place for tens of millions of years! It is ours!” roared that Devil Eye Water Lily.

“The human race has lived here for a trillion years. For you to forcibly occupy it for so long, it’s already nice of us to not charge you rent. Now you have the gall to refuse your eviction? Did we give you too much face? Starting today, the High Firmament Academy is formally taking back its land. You can scram.” Bai Zhantang sneered at them mockingly with the scabbard in hand.

“Since you want to die, we’ll accompany you!”

That Devil Eye Water Lily roared furiously. In its fury, its leaves transformed into a giant hand. As a result, the giant spatial cracks behind them were torn even bigger.

Endless black qi poured out from the other side of those cracks. At the same time, the black dragons flew crazily toward Bai Zhantang.

Those black dragons exploded upon contact with the barrier. However, after dying, their black blood tainted the barrier, turning into corrosive runes.

“They want to use the power of dragon blood to ignite their Undying Qi and demolish the formation. Quite vicious!” Long Chen was startled.

“The aura of the Undying World possesses a strong destructive power. Moreover, this place has an ancient corpse. They have merged their power with the death qi of the corpse to fight us.”

At some point, Bai Shishi’s mother had appeared beside them, but she wasn’t the slightest bit worried.

“Mom, you’re all Immortal Kings?” Bai Shishi looked at her mother in disbelief. They had concealed themselves for so long.

“You’ve done well. Your metal energy is even purer now, and you’ve obtained a divine weapon. Even a Spirit tier Immortal King isn’t a match for you,” said Bai Shishi’s mother with praise.

Bai Shishi had given her a pleasant surprise this time. That sword in particular made even her heart shudder. After leaving her side, her daughter had grown so much.

Just then, more and more specks of corroding rust appeared on the barrier. Long Chen couldn’t help asking, “Senior, is there no defense against this dragon blood corrosion?”

Long Chen saw that those spots of rust remained and even seemed to be spreading. He couldn’t help being worried. The death qi within them was truly frightening.

“The corpse poison of that ancient corpse lies underground, and they have drawn it out. It is something that even the scabbard of the High Firmament Divine Sword cannot expel,” said Bai Shishi’s mother.

“Then what can be done?” asked Bai Shishi. It had to be known that they had risked their lives to reclaim these ruins. If they were to lose them, it would be an absolute waste.

“Don’t worry. Our reinforcements are almost here.” Bai Shishi’s mother smiled. Just as she said this, rainbows appeared in the air one by one.

“The rainbow cranes!” Bai Shishi cried out in delight. The rainbows appeared to be between illusory and reality. The rainbow cranes had actually come here!

As they appeared, this gloomy world brightened, and the aura of death and decay slowly dispersed. An auspicious qi gradually spread as the rainbow cranes danced.

The rainbow cranes moved beautifully through the air, just like the dance of the fairies. A peaceful air then settled over the world.

This ominous land instantly became a blessed land due to their appearance. The rainbow cranes were the favorites of heaven and earth. They carried an auspicious halo wherever they went that drove away all the dark energy of heaven and earth.

Hence, dark qi was driven away and warm sunlight fell from the heavens. This land of death was revived.

The ground was originally barren, but all kinds of greenery sprouted out of that dead ground now. The sinister forest in the surroundings withered and fresh greenery replaced it. Even the spatial cracks slowly closed.

“Bastards! Just wait, you have offended the great Devil Eye Water Lily race. When we step into the immortal world next time, we will definitely make rivers of your blood flow!”

The Devil Eye Water Lily roared, but its roar was rather powerless. That was because they were hiding within the spatial cracks. When the spatial cracks finally closed, they were gone.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Big brother Long Chen!”

Suddenly, one of those rainbow cranes transformed into a girl and fell into Long Chen’s embrace. She was the girl that had given him the original true feather.

“Little Yu-er[1], it’s all thanks to you this time.” Long Chen hugged her. Looking at her childish face, he couldn’t help smiling and praising her.

The rainbow crane race’s power was truly unfathomable. If he hadn’t personally witnessed it, he wouldn’t believe it.

They didn’t have powerful combat power. Instead, they possessed a natural auspicious qi that could revitalize even lands of death.

“Big brother Long Chen, did you miss little Yu-er?” Little Yu-er looked up into Long Chen’s eyes, her pure eyes filled with excitement.

“Of course I missed you. Big brother is doing his best to create a peaceful world. Once big brother settles the nine heavens and ten lands, big brother will accompany you to play every day,” said Long Chen.

The ‘picture’ he painted made little Yu-er very happy. She was still a child and very pure, so she believed whatever other people told her.

“Big brother Long Chen, little Yu-er is tired. I want to sleep. When I wake up, I’ll come to find you.” Little Yu-er’s black and white eyes clearly contained a trace of weariness now. She yawned.

Only now did Long Chen realize that expelling the dark aura from this place had used up the core energy of the rainbow cranes. He immediately comforted her, promising to accompany her once she woke up.

Little Yu-er happily nodded and transformed back into a crane. She then flew around Long Chen a few times before leaving together with the other rainbow cranes.

The Devil Eye Water Lilies had fled and the rainbow cranes had also left. Now, Bai Zhantang put away the High Firmament Divine Sword’s scabbard and came up to Long Chen. Looking him up and down, he nodded.

“Little fellow, not bad.”

“You’re not lacking either.” Long Chen smiled slightly.

“Hahaha!” These old Immortal Kings couldn’t help laughing when they heard Long Chen’s response.
