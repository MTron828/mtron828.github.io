Chapter 3041 The Arrogant Boss Long San

There were dozens of elders sitting in a palace hall, their expressions gloomy. They were from the Clear River Palace, Silver Moon City, Nine Cauldron Church, and Amethyst Heart Island. Not one of their disciples had returned, so they were here to demand an explanation.

Other than them, there was one particular middle-aged man. A sharp light shone in his eyes, and he stood out amongst these elders.

This person was not an expert from those four powers. He came from the Chu family as their representative.

There was also another particular person in black robes, his cloak covering most of his face. Even so, the wrinkles on his face showed that he was not young. His aura was strange, sometimes it was there and sometimes it wasn’t. It was as if he might vanish at any moment. This was an expert from the Bloodkill Hall.

People from the Clear River Palace, Silver Moon City, Nine Cauldron Furnace, Amethyst Heart Island, Chu family, and Bloodkill Hall had all come. However, even after waiting a long time, no one from the academy came to receive them. Just as they were growing impatient, someone made an announcement.

“The High Firmament Academy’s Heaven Master Long Chen has arrived.”

The black-robed Long Chen walked in with his hands clasped behind his back. He swaggered in with a large escort.

Behind him were Heaven Master Yun Yang, Heaven Master Dong Ming, the head judge, as well as some other higher-ups. Behind them were Luo Bing, Luo Ning, a barely mobile Bai Xiaole, and the others.

In front of their astonished gazes, Long Chen swaggered over to those people, looking down on them arrogantly. His expression was one full of disdain. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

When Long Chen arrived in front of the expert from the Bloodkill Hall, he suddenly swung his hand.

It then landed firmly on that person’s face. He clearly hadn’t expected Long Chen to attack, so his hood was destroyed, revealing an extremely ordinary old face.

“What is this? To dare conceal yourself in front of Boss Long San, are you tired of living?” After slapping him, Long Chen returned to his previous exceedingly arrogant expression.

The elder’s face swelled. Killing intent exploded out of him. He was one of the higher-ups from the Bloodkill Hall. He hadn’t expected this novice to be so brazen. Furthermore, this novice’s hand was as quick as lightning, striking without any warning. Even this terrifying assassin that walked the line between life and death was unable to dodge it.

“Ignorant junior, do you believe me when I say that I’ll kill you right here?!” shouted the elder.

“Do you believe me when I say that if I give the order, all of you will lose your heads here?” sneered Long Chen, completely ignoring his harsh killing intent.

Heaven Master Yun Yang told him that he was in charge of receiving these people, so he could do whatever he wanted with them. With so many experts on the level of Heaven Masters guarding him, why would he be afraid?

At the same time, he learned that the academy was not afraid of them at all. The higher-ups just couldn’t be bothered with them and didn’t want to waste time on them.

That was why they let him come out. One reason was that Long Chen was a witness to the events and so had a right to speak. But the other reason was a campaign for him to serve as a foundation for the Nine Prefecture Convention, so that he would have certain fame and prestige when he attended.

With such a privilege, if he didn’t take proper advantage of it, he wouldn’t be Long Chen.

“What are you talking about?” One of the Clear River Palace’s elders stood up.

However, just as he stood, Long Chen slapped him. Unexpectedly, he spun twice through the air before falling.

“When Boss Long San is speaking, do you think you can just interrupt?” asked Long Chen arrogantly.

Heaven Master Yun Yang, Heaven Master Dong Ming, the head judge, and the others exchanged a glance. They were all full of shock.

It had to be known that these old fellows were all extremely powerful existences. Their cultivation bases were many levels above Long Chen’s, and they all possessed sharp combat instincts as well. However, neither the elder from the Clear River Palace nor the old assassin from the Bloodkill Hall was able to dodge his seemingly ordinary slap. This move was truly shocking.

These two slaps fully established Long Chen’s dominance. Now, all the experts’ expressions changed. Their hands instinctively reached toward their weapons. It seemed that they would attack at any moment.

“What a pack of fools. I’ll give you to the count of three. If you’re still in such an idiotic posture, I, Boss Long San, swear to the heavens that not one of you will leave alive,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“One.”

“Two.”

Long Chen directly started counting. Just as he was about to say three, those experts clenched their teeth and retracted their hands from their weapons.

Long Chen sneered. He then swaggered over to the throne of the room, looking down arrogantly on them. Crossing his legs, he received a cup of tea from Mu Qingyun. After he took a sip, he indifferently said, “Speak. What are you here for?”

This disdain and arrogance completely infuriated those experts. They didn’t know what the High Firmament Academy was doing.

Heaven Master Yun Yang and the others made them afraid of attacking. Furthermore, this was the High Firmament Academy’s territory, so they didn’t dare to run rampant. They had no choice but to accept this humiliation.

“Who are you to represent the High Firmament Academy?” asked the middle-aged man from the Chu family.

“You look human, so how did you say something so dog-like? I came here just to represent the academy in resolving its problems. Otherwise, do you think I would be so bored as to accompany a pack of fools like you?” said Long Chen.

“You…” That expert from the Chu family almost coughed up blood. “Fine, since you represent the High Firmament Academy, we can talk fairly. We represent Divine Venerate Brahma to ask you where did the High Firmament Academy get the guts to annihilate the experts of the five powers, lowering the number of believers of the Divine Venerate!”

Long Chen smiled. Right at the start, this guy took out the card known as Lord Brahma? Was he trying to scare kids?

“That’s right, the High Firmament Academy must give us an explanation today!” shouted an expert from the Silver Moon City.

“Don’t think that the High Firmament Academy is unrivaled! Let me tell you, if you infuriate Divine Venerate Brahma, your High Firmament Academy will be turned to dust!” sneered an expert from the Amethyst Heart Island.

“What nonsense. Who do you think you are? Do you not know how worthless you are? Do you think the High Firmament Academy is full of fools? How can the likes of you represent Divine Venerate Brahma? Let me put it to you this way. I can give the order to kill all of you, and Lord Brahma won’t say a word to the High Firmament Academy about it. If you don’t believe me, let’s try it right now.” Long Chen patted his throne, and the palace hall’s runes lit up. Divine runes condensed into sharp swords pointed at those experts, causing their expressions to change.
