Chapter 3710 Talisman Cultivator’s Divine Might

He Changtian immediately started off with a full-power attack, not holding back. The violent flame energy caused the world to change color.

Even other Supreme experts were moved. To be able to instantly unleash such power with no warm-up was very difficult.

It had to be known that in any battle between experts, their Blood Qi would need a few circulations to enter a combat-ready state.

Without a warm-up, instantly unleashing their full power would damage their meridians. They would end up injuring themselves without even hurting their enemies.

However, He Changtian instantly entered his peak condition, and his aura was astonishing. This shocked everyone.

Even so, people quickly realized that the reason why He Changtian was capable of doing this was due to his Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor. This battle armor helped him resist any backlash.

His spear pierced out like a dragon, causing huge ripples to appear in the void.

In front of this powerful attack, Xia Chen simply raised his right hand. A golden talisman then appeared in it.

“Ignite.”

Xia Chen’s golden talisman suddenly exploded, forming a golden light that seemed to be liquid. It covered his hand, making it look like it was made out of liquid gold.

BOOM!

In front of everyone’s stunned gazes, Xia Chen’s palm met the spear just like that. A huge explosion then shook the land.

Xia Chen’s left hand was still behind him. Millions of tiny cracks appeared in the space behind him, stretching into the distance like a web.

People then saw flames burst out of Xia Chen’s left hand and follow those cracks. The web instantly became a web of flames.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“He shifted He Changtian’s flame energy?!”

Everyone was shocked. The full-power attack from He Changtian had actually been dealt with like this? Xia Chen wasn’t the slightest bit injured. Burning cracks appeared behind him like blazing divine light. 

“A talisman cultivator! He’s a talisman cultivator!”

A startled cry rang out. People finally recognized Xia Chen’s status. When he extended his hand, he was holding a talisman in his left and right hands. Just like that, he easily blocked He Changtian’s attack.

Long Chen smiled. Talisman cultivators were truly mysterious. A tiny talisman actually had the power to twist the laws of heaven and earth to its advantage. Even now, he did not understand the true profundities of this.

BOOM!

At this moment, He Changtian suddenly took advantage of their close range to smash a fist toward Xia Chen’s face. His reaction was very fast. He was actually a close-range fighting expert.

BOOM!

Xia Chen slammed his hands together, and a talisman appeared between his hands. After that, He Changtian’s fist smashed into Xia Chen. Luckily, a shield already manifested on top of Xia Chen’s hands, perfectly blocking He Changtian’s attack.

With another explosive sound, both of them retreated three steps. He Changtian sneered, “You’re just relying on external items. Let’s see just how many talismans you have.”

Xia Chen had lost three talismans just like that. These talismans were all single uses. After they were used, they were simply gone. Although they were powerful enough to block two of the attacks, in the end, they were quickly used up.

“As I am a talisman cultivator, you don’t need to worry about that. You should worry about yourself,” sneered Xia Chen.

Suddenly, he spread his hands and crossed them in front of his chest. Eight talismans appeared between his fingers.

“Eight Ghost Devil Exorcism!”

Those eight talismans exploded at the same time, and a translucent lifeform shot out of every single one of them. They were like human skulls with long tails charging toward He Changtian with a peal of strange laughter.

That strange laughter gave everyone chills. That was like the sound of devils demanding lives. It instinctively terrified people.

Most terrifying of all was that this sound directly pierced their souls. There was no defending it. Everyone’s expression changed.

“A soul energy attack?!”

A startled cry rang out. This was a specific kind of energy, soul energy, a mix between Spiritual Strength and mental energy. Others couldn’t defend against it.

“You dare to bring out such an insignificant trick?”

He Changtian sneered in the face of those eight bizarre lifeforms. The Heavenly Ruler Seal Wild Lion then roared within his manifestation.

After that, a ring of fire spread out of his manifestation, instantly devouring those eight lifeforms.

When the ring of fire touched those lifeforms, those lifeforms instantly exploded. However, just as they exploded, He Changtian coughed up blood.

The space between his eyebrows split apart, and blood poured out of it. It was as if something had exploded in his head, almost blowing it up.

When those lifeforms exploded, countless experts screamed and clutched their heads in pain.

“A Ghost Dao art?! Detonating the soul?!”

Shocked cries rang out. Legend had it that only the Ghost Dao had the ability to affect a person’s soul without a god or ghost being the wiser. The Ghost Dao was capable of taking control of people without them being aware of it. This situation was a bit similar to a so-called ‘being possessed by a ghost’ in the mortal world.

Even in the immortal world, the Ghost Dao was unfathomable. It was full of unknowns that terrified people.

The reason why people were able to link this technique to the Ghost Dao was because of what Xia Chen had just shouted, Eight Ghosts Devil Exorcism. On top of that, only the Ghost Dao would have such a bizarrely terrifying attack method.

This attack didn’t just affect He Changtian. The experts with weaker Spiritual Strength also felt like their heads would split apart. It was like their souls were trying to escape the coils of their physical bodies.

Even Long Chen jumped in shock. Was this a technique that Xia Chen had just developed? Or was it something that he had long since had up his sleeve but never exposed?

“All you know are sinister tricks! Despicable fellow, don’t think these little tricks can harm me!” He Changtian raised his head and roared. After that, a wave of flame energy exploded out of him, and the world became a sea of flames.

“He Changtian has activated his flame domain!”

Summoning this domain showed that he was truly going all-out. It could not be dealt with easily. In this domain, He Changtian was the ruler.

BOOM!

Flame wings appeared on He Changtian’s back. He then appeared in front of Xia Chen in an instant as if he had just teleported. His spear stabbed toward Xia Chen.

However, what shocked everyone was that this incredibly fast spear missed. Frightened cries then came from the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s people. Xia Chen had appeared behind He Changtian at some point.

When his spear missed, He Changtian also felt something wrong. He suddenly stepped back and swung his spear above his head, arching his back. His spear then shot toward Xia Chen in a shocking arc. The tip reached Xia Chen’s face in an instant.

This was not a profound technique, but his quick reaction, the angle of his attack, and his accurate judgment all showed that He Changtian had immense combat experience. Furthermore, he had unleashed such a strange attack easily and gracefully. He truly was an expert.

However, his spear once more missed as Xia Chen’s figure had vanished.

All of a sudden, Xia Chen reappeared above He Changtian’s head and stamped his foot down.
