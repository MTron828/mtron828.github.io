Chapter 2824 All a Misunderstanding?

They had come directly to Long Chen and the others and were staring right at them, but they first asked who Long Chen was. Their apprehension was obvious.

“I am Long Chen.”

Long Chen spoke. He already knew what they had come for.

He had just beaten Pan Mingxiong, so it was too early for law enforcement disciples to appear for that. Even if Pan Mingxiong reported it, the response wouldn’t be so fast.

For these law enforcement disciples to come now, it was clearly due to the matter of smashing the flying boat. That timing sounded about right.

“Ah… instructor Long Chen, let me first make it clear: we are only in charge of investigating some testimony. We have no intention of targeting you. If those people say some offensive things, I hope you won’t mind. We’re just carrying out our duty,” said the head disciple. The fear in his eyes was clear.

Long Chen had injured hundreds of people by attacking the flying boat. Those people all had broken bones.

After that, those people had reported Long Chen to the Discipline Institute. As for the Elder on duty, it was the one that Long Chen had previously slapped.

That Elder had also been the one to report Long Chen to the Divine Lightning Elder. The fury of being slapped had made him come up with a plan to incite a conflict between the two of them. Hence, he vaguely reported that Long Chen was an emissary of the Pill Institute who had come to cause trouble in the God Institute.

Considering that their relationship was bad from the start, and adding the Divine Lightning Elder’s explosive temperament, his plan went well. The Divine Lightning Elder had furiously gone to find Long Chen.

However, not long after, the Divine Lightning Elder returned. Before the discipline Elder could even ask the Divine Lightning Elder how it went, the latter kicked him so hard that he coughed up blood and almost died.

The Divine Lightning Elder furiously swore, “Next time you treat me like an idiot, I’ll kill you.”

The kick left the discipline Elder with serious injuries, and he had to quickly consume some medicinal pills to suppress them.

After investigating, he almost died of rage. Using some unknown sorcery, Long Chen had actually become brothers with the Divine Lightning Elder.

When he heard that news, he coughed up blood and directly fainted.

The disciples then hastily supported him, feeding him medicinal pills. He was unconscious for over two hours before he woke up.

Unfortunately, as soon as he was awake, another disciple came to report that people were accusing Long Chen of attacking their flying boat, injuring them and almost costing the lives of everyone on the flying boat.

If it was before he was kicked by the Divine Lightning Elder, he would definitely jump in excitement. But now he was afraid. The Seven Star Elder was not an easy existence to provoke, while the Divine Lightning Elder definitely couldn’t be provoked. As for this evil star known as Long Chen, he no longer wanted to provoke it either.

Due to some connections, he was supposed to stand on these disciples’ side. However, he was now afraid.

He had an idea to pretend that he was ill and couldn’t go out, but if that happened, the news of him being kicked by the Divine Lightning Elder would spread like wildfire. That would be too embarrassing.

After thinking and thinking, he decided to first send people to probe Long Chen’s attitude. Once a full investigation was done, he could make his decision on how to toss away this scalding sweet potato.

He could easily stall this matter a few days and leave it to a different Elder. Then he could relieve himself of this responsibility and just watch the show.

However, the disciples he told to ask Long Chen about what happened turned green. Just what kind of existence was Long Chen? He killed people without batting an eye. Wasn’t questioning him just asking to die?

If done well, they would just be slapped a few times. Done badly, their lives would be gone. No one wanted to take this task.

In the end, the task had fallen to this unfortunate fellow. But he had no way to decline because that Elder was his master. If he didn’t go, he would have no way of living in the God Institute. So he could only thicken his face and come. That expression of his looked like he wanted to cry.

The other disciples who came with him stood far behind, as if too afraid to even get close to Long Chen.

“It’s fine. You can ask your questions. I’m actually a very even-tempered person,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Even-tempered? That disciple’s expression turned odd. Were the stories just scary ghost stories?

Seeing the law enforcement disciples quivering, Mu Qingyun and the others almost laughed. Just who was questioning who?

Due to their special status, law enforcement disciples always appeared arrogant. Although they didn’t usually cause trouble themselves, they were so tyrannical that they always spoke with an interrogating tone.

Although Mu Qingyun and the others could be considered courteous, the other disciples on this floor couldn’t be described in that manner. Law enforcement disciples were not well-liked within the God Institute. Hence, seeing them looking like they were going to piss themselves from fear, these disciples laughed. It was unknown just how hard it was for Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu to hold themselves back.

The law enforcement disciple took out a notebook and carefully said, “A small hunting squad reported that instructor Long Chen, you, wanted to kill them. I myself definitely don’t believe such an accusation, nor will our Discipline Institute be biased and only hear one side. So, we want to hear your explanation. Is it convenient for you to explain?”

“Did they not mention why they decided to kill our flying mount?” asked Long Chen.

“They said it was due to loss of control. It was a misunderstanding,” answered the law enforcement disciple.

“A misunderstanding? Yes, this matter was truly just a misunderstanding.” Long Chen nodded with a smile.

“Uh… what does that mean?” asked the disciple.

“We were just riding on a flying immortal beast when something flew out and tried to smash into us. Fortunately, I was fast enough to run, or we would have been killed. Just think about it: if someone wanted to kill you, wouldn’t you counterattack?”

“Yes.” The disciple nodded.

“Exactly. My first thought was that someone was invading the academy and killing people! So I attacked back. After my attack landed, senior apprentice-sister Qingyun told me that it was actually a hunting flying boat, but by that time, everything was over. So just like they said, it really was a misunderstanding. I’m glad that the misunderstanding has been cleared up. Since no one was damaged, this matter can be concluded here,” said Long Chen magnanimously.

Those law enforcement disciples stared at him oddly. They had personally seen those hunting disciples. Their injuries were severe. Some people were crushed into pancakes, and some had almost lost their lives. This was considered no damage?

“Are there any questions? If not, we’re about to eat. Would you like to join us?” asked Long Chen.

“No! I mean, no, we won’t disturb you any longer. Have a nice day,” said that disciple.

With this, it was clear that it was the hunting party causing trouble. But they had caused trouble for the wrong party. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The hunting party couldn’t possibly admit that they had intentionally crashed into someone. As for Long Chen, he acted like he didn’t recognize their flying boat. By saying that he thought they were invaders, they couldn’t do anything to him, considering his background.

This matter would definitely be glossed over just like this. In any case, they had a rough understanding of what happened. As for any real decisions, it would be up to that Elder. They had finished their mission without being beaten. That was enough for them to light incense.

Just as they were about to leave, another group of law enforcement disciples furiously stamped up the stairs.

“Who is Long Chen?! Get the hell out here!”
