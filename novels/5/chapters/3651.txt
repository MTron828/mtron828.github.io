Chapter 3640

Long Chen and Guo Ran had just come out of the transportation formation when they were swarmed by a group of people. It wasn’t just them. The people who had taken the transportation formation with them were also flabbergasted.

“Brother, it’s your first time coming to our Heavenly Talisman Star-Field, isn’t it? I can see that you are exceptionally talented. Based on your bone structure, you are a good seedling for becoming a Talisman Master. Our sect is currently recruiting, and the admission fee is very cheap! It’s just thirty immortal king crystals, and once you pass, you’ll have direct access to the sect’s talisman arts!”

Someone enthusiastically grabbed Guo Ran. He was so excited it looked like he was reuniting with an old brother from many years ago.

“No, no, no, I’m not here to learn talisman arts…” Guo Ran hastily shook his head.

“You’re not here for learning? That’s fine too! Having just arrived, you must not be aware of the situation on our side. Let me give you introductions! Don’t worry, it’s all free. Brother, do you see? Here are the best goods! Anything you want can be found here!” That person directly opened a small pouch on his waist when Guo Ran said that he didn’t come to join a sect. Inside was a pile of talismans.

Some of these talismans were the size of a fist, while the smaller ones were the size of a single thumb. They also came in different colors, bright and gaudy. They were very attractive.

Long Chen and Guo Ran were intrigued. They weren’t afraid of being cheated.

Seeing that he had piqued their interest, that person delightedly said, “Brothers, take a look at this! This is a Titan Talisman! Here is a Voice Alteration Talisman! This is an Appearance Changing Talisman! Ground Contracting Tasliman, Fixed Space Transportation Talisman, and many more! Hehe, this is one that men like the most, the Golden Unbreakable Spear Talisman!” That person pulled out a certain talisman with a rather wretched smile.

“Golden Unbreakable Spear Talisman?” Long Chen and Guo Ran were flabbergasted.

“Hehe, just stick this to your waist, and you can move forward and backward ten times in the blink of an eye! Put two, and it’s twenty times! But I don’t recommend going past ten of these at once…”

“Why?” asked Guo Ran.

“Because if you go too fast, you might start a fire!” laughed that person.

Long Chen and Guo Ran almost laughed. This little fellow’s eloquence wasn’t bad. Even as a seller, he was quite humorous.

“What do you think? Do you want a few? I sell them in sets of a hundred, with each one costing six immortal king crystals. But seeing that we have a destiny together and I haven’t started selling yet today, I still have plenty of extras! I’ll sell them half off for you! One set for three hundred immortal king crystals! How is that? Isn’t that a good deal?” That man patted his chest.

“I really can’t use this. When I was with my brothers, they always bragged, saying that they didn’t lose even after an hour. Others said that they did it seven times in one night! When they asked me how many times I do it, I told them just once and they looked down on me. So I told them that every time the sun starts to rise, my Dao-companion asks for a break,” said Guo Ran helplessly.

“...”

After eyeing Guo Ran for a bit, he felt that the latter looked like a chicken and wasn’t very strong in that regard. But he didn’t feel good exposing Guo Ran. Otherwise, this conversation would run into a dead-end, and his business efforts would end in failure.

“Hehe, I was wrong, I misjudged. So brother is so amazing. Junior brother apologizes. However, I also have many other goods here. Look at this Earth Contracting Talisman! Put one on your left and right legs, and your legs will be like wheels! Your speed will at least double! This Shield Talisman, when it’s crushed, it forms a spatial shield that can block the full-power attack of a Divine Lord! This Titan Talisman, it’s even more powerful! Put one on each arm! Don’t think that I look like some weak chicken. With these talismans, I can lift up the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field!” bragged that fellow.

“What nonsense. How can a talisman possibly have such an effect?” Guo Ran naturally refused to believe such a thing. Long Chen was first startled but then smiled without saying anything.

“Do you want to bet? We’ll just have a small wager of a hundred immortal king crystals. I’ll immediately put on the talismans and show you,” declared that fellow, seemingly angered at being called a liar.

“No problem! Go ahead!” Guo Ran refused to believe it.

“Look closely!”

That person placed a talisman on each of his arms. Guo Ran then saw the talismans light up, and this fellow’s arms instantly thickened a whole level. Veins throbbed on them. Guo Ran jumped in shock, having never seen such a sight before.

After taking a deep breath, that person placed his hands on the earth and then cleanly did a handstand.

“What the fuck?! You… Fine, here are a hundred immortal king crystals. I’ll treat it as a lesson.” Guo Ran was speechless. How did lifting up the entire star-field become such a thing? He actually fell for it.

Guo Ran directly tossed out a hundred immortal king crystals, delighting this fellow. Although he often used this move to make a little money, most people wouldn’t give him so much. At most, they would give half. Most people just threw out a few immortal king crystals, treating it as giving money to a beggar. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Sometimes, he would misjudge and pick a tough person who might give him a beating for this. It was his first time running into someone as refreshing as Guo Ran.

After receiving Guo Ran’s immortal king crystals, he even felt a bit embarrassed. “How about I give you ten Golden Unbreakable Spear Talismans? You can test the result, and if you want more, come find me. I’ll give you the lowest price.”

“You can give up on that. I don't have a Dao-companion, so I have no use for it.” Guo Ran shook his head.

Seeing that the two of them had done their idle talk, Long Chen said, “Junior brother, as a native to this place, you should have more information about it. Tell me, do you know of the Spirit Rune Pavilion?”

“Of course I know it! The Spirit Rune Pavilion’s name is known to everyone within the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field!”

Long Chen asked, “Then do you know someone called Xia Chen? The Xia character is for summer, and the Chen is for daybreak.”

Upon hearing Xia Chen’s name, an expression of comprehension came across that person’s face. “So you came from outside to hunt down Xia Chen?”

“Hunt down Xia Chen?”

Long Chen and Guo Ran’s hearts shook. Long Chen hastily asked, “I want to know everything about Xia Chen.”

Seeing that this fellow was a bit hesitant, Long Chen directly tossed him a bag. When he opened the bag, he jumped in shock. There were a full ten thousand immortal king crystals inside.

“It seems that the two of you have some amazing origins. Alright then. There are too many people here, so let’s switch locations!” That person looked to his left and right.

Long Chen nodded and entered the city with this person. They then found a secluded teahouse with a private room for the three of them.

Just as that person was about to speak, Long Chen first said, “I need to know everything. I’ll add another ten thousand immortal king crystals after. But if you treat me as a rich fool, I’ll simply do a soulsearch.”

That person jumped. He just had a thought about making more money this way when Long Chen’s gaze seemed to see through his soul. He felt a chill.

He even began to sweat and hastily said, “Alright, I’ll tell you everything. I won’t conceal anything. Xia Chen was originally a disciple of the Spirit Rune Pavilion. However, after committing the grave sin of betraying his sect and master, there is now a warrant for him throughout the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. If he’s alive, he’s to be captured. If he’s dead, they want to see his corpse.”

This news caused Long Chen and Guo Ran’s expressions to change.
