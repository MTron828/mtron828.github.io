Chapter 4380 Unrivaled Palace Master

Enraged, the palace master summoned his true form—the black barbarian dragon, an existence with the most potent and mysterious dark energy among all dragons.

The origins of the palace master were shrouded in mystery, and only a handful of individuals knew what his true form looked like. Even those closest to him, such as Bai Zhantang and others, possibly only knew about his true form, yet none of them had ever laid eyes upon it.

Now that an enormous black barbarian dragon covered the sky, its dark energy infecting this world, everyone finally saw the true form of the mysterious palace master.

The sheer size of the black dragon was staggering; only its head was visible, with the tail hidden from view. Even the once-considered enormous Red Fur Heaven Roarer now seemed small in comparison to the palace master. It was like a rabbit standing in front of an elephant.

“The Nirvana Overflow Heaven is not a place where you can run rampant! The great dragon race is also not an existence that you can blaspheme!” the palace master shouted. His enormous body quivered, and the world shuddered with him. Within that dark qi, he appeared mysterious yet also wildly arrogant.

BOOM!

A dragon claw descended out of the nine heavens, actually looking much larger than the Red Fur Heaven Roarer.

“What’s the point of becoming bigger? Who do you think you’re trying to scare? I’ll crush you!”

The Red Fur Heaven Roarer fearlessly spread the wings on its back, and its red fur lit up. The next moment, a ray of red light shot out of its mouth.

Some people noticed that this attack also contained that red-haired monster’s power. In other words, the two of them had merged their power.

BOOM!

The dragon claw swiftly shattered the Red Fur Heaven Roarer’s attack and continued to smash it, slamming it into the ground. A wave of earth rose in the aftermath.

“Does that fellow only know how to brag?” Guo Ran couldn’t help being shocked by this result.

The Red Fur Heaven Roarer had boasted to the extent of sounding mightier than the heavens themselves. Hence, everyone thought that this would be a clash of absolute power. However, the palace master effortlessly subdued it with a single palm, asserting complete domination.

BOOM!

When the dragon claw rose from the ground, the earth rose with it, pulling a wretched figure out of the ground.

The Red Fur Heaven Roarer was no longer red, as it was covered in mud. However, what shocked the onlookers was that even after receiving this blow, there didn’t seem to be the slightest wound on it. Its physical body was absolutely terrifying.

The palace master’s claw had pushed the Red Fur Heaven Roarer into the ground and then pulled it out. Now, ominous sounds echoed from the darkness. Abruptly, the black qi swelled, and an immense black dragon tail sliced through the air with formidable force.

“Red Devil Blood Shield!”

“Heaven Roarer Divine Seal!”

Seeing that attack, both the Red Fur Heaven Roarer and the red-haired monster shouted in shock. They clearly sensed an immense threat from it.

A blood-colored barrier and a divine light shield appeared in front of the Red Fur Heaven Roarer, and they quickly merged. This was clearly their strongest combined defense.

BOOM!

This defense had barely formed before that heaven-covering dragon tail whipped into it.

There was no suspense at all. The collective defense proved utterly futile, shattering instantly. Following that, the Red Fur Heaven Roarer and the red-haired monster screamed.

BOOM, BOOM!

Two figures were sent flying, crashing into the ground and creating sizable craters.

“Their merger has been forcibly broken!” exclaimed the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

It had to be known that a merger effectively transformed two people into a single entity, intertwining their souls. Hence, despite only looking like a mere display of brute force, the palace master’s attack had to possess the power of laws as well. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to dispel their merger.

BOOM!

Abruptly, the Red Fur Heaven Roarer shot out of the ground like a bolt of lightning, heading directly toward the gate, paying no heed to the red-haired monster.

Just as it reached the gate, thinking that it could escape to the humanless world, the gate quivered intensely. The Red Fur Heaven Roarer was knocked back by some strange force.

At that precise moment, a dragon roar came whistling over. The Red Fur Heaven Roarer instinctively dodged, but it was one step too slow. One of the claws sliced through its head.

Its head was gone, and it tumbled back, leaving everyone stunned. How did the Red Fur Heaven Roarer suddenly become so weak?

They quickly realized that it had to have sustained severe injuries moments before. With the disruption of their merger art and their inability to support each other, the palace master seized the opportunity to crush its head in a single blow.

BOOM!

At that moment, the red-haired monster appeared, having surfaced from the ground unnoticed. It unleashed a powerful palm strike at the gate, and with an explosive sound, Xia Chen's formation shattered.

“Let’s go!”

The red-haired monster grabbed the Red Fur Heaven Roarer’s tail, as it had shrunk to a manageable size. Just like that, the red-haired monster dragged it into the humanless world.

Seeing two headless monsters flee into the humanless world, people found it comical, but they were also incomparably shocked.

At this moment, the enormous dragon claw came to a stop in front of the gate. The palace master’s attack was one step too late.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In the distance around the humanless world’s gate, numerous experts had gathered. Seeing the palace master drive away those powerful experts, they were all stunned. The palace master had hidden his power well.

His power was like a bottomless hole. The stronger his enemies, the stronger he became, and he hadn’t reached his limit yet.

"The red-haired monster had his head obliterated by Dean Long Chen, and now, the Red Fur Heaven Roarer met the same fate with its head crushed by the palace master. Is this the legacy of the High Firmament Academy?"

It was a teasing line, but no one laughed at it. They all knew this person only said this to express his awe.

After all, just how terrifying were the red-haired monster and the Red Fur Heaven Roarer? However, Long Chen and the palace master had still destroyed their heads. It seemed that they were even more terrifying than the two monsters.

If it was just the palace master, it was understandable. After all, his cultivation base was unfathomable, and he was a legendary black barbarian dragon.

However, Long Chen had just broken through to the World King realm but was already able to destroy the head of a terrifying monster. Actually, he was the real monster.

“Nirvana Overflow Heaven, just you wait! This Saint will remember this enmity!” The red-haired monster’s roar came from the other side of the gate.

Clearly, he was unconvinced by his defeat, and it seemed that he would find the palace master in the future for another fight.

However, that threat didn’t scare anyone. The palace master’s victory was no coincidence; he clearly highlighted their power disparity, and everyone saw how he beat them with ease, like beating children. Such an empty threat was meaningless.

“Thank you, little brother. I almost didn’t manage to break its head. I didn’t think that it’d be so gutless and run so fast,” said the palace master to Xia Chen as he appeared before them. The black qi in the sky then faded, and the world brightened once more.

Had Xia Chen’s formation not blocked them for a moment, the Red Fur Heaven Roarer would have fled instantly, and the palace master wouldn’t have managed to crush its head.

“Palace master, why did you show them mercy?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking, stunning countless people. They then stared at the palace master in shock.
