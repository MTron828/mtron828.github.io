Chapter 2117 Getting Rid of the Lair

The Zhao Wuji that was charging at Long Chen was just another one of the Mechanism Sect’s puppets, while the true body fled, trying to conceal himself within an empty space. However, Long Chen had still noticed him and knocked him out of his hidden space.

Seeing that he was unable to escape, Zhao Wuji roared. His armor lit up, and he summoned his manifestation. As a fierce aura burst out, he hacked his sickle blades at Long Chen.

Long Chen blocked both blades with Evilmoon, sneering, “Zhao Wuji, I’ve memorized all your moves. If this set of armor of yours doesn’t have any new abilities, then I’ll be sending you to hell right now.”

“You’re the one going to hell!” Zhao Wuji suddenly smiled sinisterly, and his armor burst off his body, surrounding the two of them.

“Boss, be careful, those are demolition runes!” shouted Xia Chen.

“Die!”

Zhao Wuji’s body suddenly shrank slightly, and another set of armor appeared around him, turning him into a defensive sphere.

The fragments of his armor exploded, and every explosion caused huge ripples in space, all of which layered upon each other where Long Chen was. As a result, a zone of absolute death formed as the explosions echoed.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors were alarmed as the explosive power just now had been too terrifying. Cracks appeared in the surrounding space, making it seem like the entire battlefield was about to tear itself apart.

“Hahaha! Long Chen, I said that you would be the one to die!” Zhao Wuji appeared flying out of the fragmented space. His armor had crumbled, and he was covered in blood. One of his arms was gone now, but he was still laughing as he coughed up blood.

In the midst of his wild laughter, a sinister-looking black blade stabbed through his back and came out of his chest, cutting off his laughter.

Zhao Wuji looked at that blade piercing his body in disbelief. He then turned to see Long Chen standing behind him.

Long Chen was also covered in blood. He was so badly wounded that his bones were exposed in several locations. The destructive power of those continuous explosions had been extremely powerful.

Xia Chen was pale with fright, as he was the one clearest on just how powerful those demolition runes had been. It was an extremely ancient rune that he had seen before but never used, and it could only be inscribed on one of the toughest divine materials known as blood rain scarlet blood. He never imagined that Zhao Wuji’s entire armor had been made out of it, and every scale had been inscribed with that terrifying rune. If it was anyone else, they would have been blown out of existence.

“It should be time for you to go to hell now. Sorry, but I won’t be giving you a chance for any final words...” said Long Chen.

“You think you can kill me?! You aren’t qualified!”

Zhao Wuji suddenly split in two from his chest. His upper body and lower body flew away, causing Long Chen’s killing blow to miss.

It was extremely strange. It was like Zhao Wuji no longer possessed a human body, but was a mechanism himself that he could control, dismantling and rejoining as he pleased.

The two pieces merged together after dodging Long Chen’s attack, forming a complete body once again. Zhao Wuji’s expression was malevolent, and a large formation disc appeared beneath him. “Long Chen, you missed your only chance to kill me. You’ll regret it for the rest of your life. Just wait, I’ll make sure your life is an endless nightmare.”

Guo Ran suddenly shot an arrow that pierced straight through Zhao Wuji’s chest. It went right through him without hurting him. Zhao Wuji then made a throat-cutting gesture and vanished.

As for Long Chen who had been rushing toward him, his attack struck nothing. He wasn’t able to make Zhao Wuji stay behind.

The rest of the Mechanism Sect’s experts tried to run, but with the Dragonblood warriors blocking their path, only a handful managed to escape. The rest were killed.

“Long Chen, just wait, next time I’ll definitely wash your entire race with blood!” howled Shi Lingfeng. His crystals lit up, forming a pillar of light that enveloped the survivors of the Stone race. There were only a few dozen of them remaining. The pillar of light tore through space and brought them away. Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and Gu Yang were unable to stop him.

In the blink of an eye, all the remnants of the Stone race and the Mechanism Sect had vanished, leaving behind only a wretched battlefield.

“Boss, are you alright?!”

Xia Chen and the others flew over to the bloody Long Chen. This was their first time seeing him in such a wretched state.

Long Chen silently activated the primal chaos bead, healing himself with the life energy inside.

“I’m fine. That was really close,” sighed Long Chen.

The plan had been good, but there were always some unexpected things. Long Chen hadn’t thought that Zhao Wuji would bring out such a trump card.

Fortunately, the Azure Dragon Battle Armor was extremely strong. Not only did he have the scales, but it also strengthened his flesh and bones. This attack didn’t actually pose a fatal threat to him, but experiencing it once was enough for him.

“Brothers, how was it? Was it satisfying?” Long Chen smiled at the Dragonblood warriors.

“Fighting the Stone race’s people was alright, but those people from the Mechanism Sect were annoying to fight against,” cursed one of the Dragonblood warriors. The Mechanism Sect’s people had countless sinister tricks up their sleeves.

Fortunately, they had Long Chen’s antitoxin pills, or quite a few of them might have died to their mechanisms.

Even now, some of them still had parts of their bodies that were black and numb. They were even starting to rot. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

If they died to a supreme expert, then fine, there was nothing to say. But dying to people like that? That would be far too irritating.

“It’s too bad Shi Lingfeng and Zhao Wuji got away,” sighed Gu Yang.

Shi Lingfeng was just too powerful, and even the three of them were unable to beat him. Even tying him down was difficult. If it hadn’t been for Li Qi and Song Mingyuan managing to steal away a portion of his earth energy, then Gu Yang wouldn’t have been able to fight him at all. This was the power of a supreme genius.

Hearing Gu Yang’s sigh, Long Chen and Xia Chen smiled. Xia Chen said, “It isn’t that they escaped, but that boss intentionally let them off.”

“Hmm?”

Long Chen nodded. “What else? You think I couldn’t kill them with one attack? You think I’d waste time talking? Do you think I’m Guo Ran?”

To the side, Guo Ran was speechless. He hadn’t even said anything, so how did he end up getting pulled into this?

“Boss, are you casting a long line to hook a bigger fish?” asked Gu Yang.

“That’s about it. But I’m not looking for one fish, I’m looking for the whole school of fish. I want to catch them all in one net. Otherwise, what would be the point of us spending so many resources?” Long Chen smiled.

At this time, the Dragonblood warriors that hadn’t had a chance to participate in the battle began to clean up the battlefield.

“Boss, should we take the corpses of the Stone race?” asked one of them.

“Of course! Those are priceless treasures!” Guo Ran immediately shouted.

This was Guo Ran’s first time seeing the Stone race, and as soon as he saw them, he fell in love with them.

Every inch of their bodies contained the essence of a divine ore. If he could extract that essence, he could imbue a rare spirituality into the things he forged. That kind of essence was something that Guo Ran had never seen before, but it was definitely a priceless treasure.

The Stone race were lifeforms of stone, and as for how they came to being, no one knew. Their origins were extremely mysterious.

There were historical records of several battles between the Stone race and the human race. When the Stone Emperor Shi Changsheng had reached his peak, it had caused a tempest of blood. However, everything regarding Shi Changsheng was unclear. There were no historical records specifically about him. As for Long Chen, he had never been interested in studying history.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were both very interested in the Stone race’s corpses. Xia Chen in particular was interested in their crystals. They had natural divine Heavenly Dao runes, something that he had never seen before. On the other hand, Guo Ran wanted to smelt their bodies and see what kind of materials he could extract from them.

When the sets of armor of the Mechanism Sect were picked out, Guo Ran was like an excited child. Some of them were still complete, and he could learn many things from them.

As for the broken ones, he could always melt them down for their precious materials.

Cleaning up the battlefield took two hours. The battle had been exceptionally intense even though it had been short. Some corpses had even penetrated many miles into the ground.

During this time, the Dragonblood warriors that had participated in the battle managed to expel the poisons invading their bodies and healed themselves.

Long Chen’s injuries also healed in just half an incense stick’s worth of time. Although his injuries looked horrifying, those demolition runes of Zhao Wuji’s armor didn’t contain Heavenly Dao energy or divine energy. Those kinds of energies would stick to injuries and continuously break down the body. Without them, healing was much easier.

As Guo Ran took charge of cleaning up the battle spoils, Xia Chen kept a close eye on a formation disc. There were two spots of light moving on the disc.

“Boss, Zhao Wuji has stopped, and the response has grown weak. He has most likely entered a minor world!” declared Xia Chen.

Long Chen smiled. Standing up, he announced, “Brothers, break time is over. This time, we’re going to get rid of the Mechanism Sect’s lair.”
