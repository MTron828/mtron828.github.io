Chapter 4183: Terrifying Ghost Dao Lifeform

Long Chen’s flying boat was silently approaching the human race’s territory with its stealth abilities. So, for them to have been noticed meant that this Ghost Dao expert had a special tracking art.

This expert had just appeared when a certain thing flew toward Long Chen, startling him.

To his surprise, it was a head that belonged to the innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company. This Ghost Dao expert had actually slain him.

For an Immortal King to defeat an innate Heaven Venerate was an immensely challenging feat. Therefore, the fact that this Ghost Dao expert had killed one indicated that his power far exceeded that of the innate Heaven Venerate.

Long Chen dodged the head quickly because he noticed that the head had strange runes on it. He didn’t dare to rashly touch it.

BOOM!

That head suddenly exploded, erupting with the divine might of an innate Heaven Venerate. It was like the self-detonation of an innate Heaven Venerate.

Long Chen was completely shocked. He hadn’t expected this Ghost Dao expert to have such terrifying methods. Now, there was no way for him to dodge this attack. If he did, the terrifying qi waves would blast Bai Shishi and the others.

Perhaps Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen could endure it. But Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Zhong Ling, and Zhong Xiu would very likely be crushed to death.

BOOM!

Golden dragon scales appeared on top of Long Chen’s body as he summoned the Dragon King Battle Armor to block this terrifying explosion. Bracing the impact, Long Chen felt like he was struck by a star and almost coughed up blood.

The space behind Long Chen cracked like a mirror and then spread straight up into the dome of the heavens. Long Chen was at the center of that web of cracks.

Following that, Long Chen's Blood Qi surged like a tsunami, and an immense power ran amok like wild horses breaking free from their reins. Amidst the chaotic energy coursing through his meridians, Long Chen found himself losing control over his body.

“Die!”

The Ghost Dao expert seemed to have expected this and stabbed a white bone dagger toward Long Chen’s head. His movement art made him seem like a phantom.

Long Chen could only watch as the dagger pierced toward him. Even as it was about to stab him, his body wouldn’t listen to him.

Long Chen was shocked and enraged. In the end, he still fell for this expert’s trap, unable to unleash any of his power.

But just as the bone dagger was about to strike Long Chen, a golden sword swung through the air, knocking the dagger aside.

It was Bai Shishi. She saved Long Chen’s life, but she was also covered in cold sweat. Fortunately, she had already merged with her sword, and it followed her very will, allowing her to attack in an instant. Otherwise, she would have been too late.

However, when her sword knocked aside the bone dagger, Bai Shishi let out a muffled grunt. Black qi unexpectedly enshrouded her golden sword, creeping along its blade toward her hand.

This expert seemed surprised that Bai Shishi could block this killing blow. Bai Shishi’s metal energy actually forced him back involuntarily.

“Die you little ghost!”

Guo Ran roared, and with his battle armor on, his battle sabers whistled down. Just now, it really had been dangerous. His boss had almost lost his life, so Guo Ran furiously swung a saber down on this expert.

Guo Ran’s speed was fast, and he grasped the timing well. However, he was shocked to find his saber pass straight through his opponent’s body. As this expert transformed into black mist, he was unable to harm him.

“He can freely switch between a solid and illusory body?!” exclaimed Guo Ran. Just what kind of origin did this expert have?

“Heaven Shaking Talisman!”

Xia Chen suddenly let out a shout, and his talisman blasted apart the black mist.

However, the scattered black mist rapidly regathered, completely unaffected by Xia Chen’s talisman.

“Heavenly Eye Seal Heaven and Earth!”

Suddenly, a giant pupil appeared, within which three flowers converged. Following that, all that black qi instantly froze. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“A pupil art!”

A frightened cry came from the black mist. Bai Xiaole’s pupil art managed to restrict his movements.

“However, with your skills, don’t even think about binding me!” That lifeform sneered. His figure then materialized once more, and he quickly formed hand seals.

“Ghost Spirit Chains!”

Bai Xiaole’s pupil arts were ultimately lacking some maturity, and he was unable to fully bind this expert. However, just as this expert escaped from the bindings, a ray of Sword Qi pierced through the void, accurately striking his head.

His head burst open, but instead of blood, black mist billowed from the wound. This attack was also unable to harm him.

Mu Qingyun was stunned. That had been her full-power attack, an attack containing her entire heart and spirit, as well as her purest will of the Sword Dao. But even so, she was unable to shake this terrifying lifeform.

“A sword cultivator? It’s too bad, your realm isn’t high enough. You cannot harm my source yet. Perhaps if you keep growing, you will reach that level. But you won’t have that chance!” That Ghost Dao lifeform suddenly vanished.

When he reappeared, he was in front of Mu Qingyun, his bone dagger stabbing toward her like a viper’s fang.

Despite knowing that it would be useless, Mu Qingyun prepared to launch an all-out counterattack. But all of a sudden, a lightning sword thundered past her with a will of utter annihilation.

BOOM!

That Ghost Dao lifeform was finally blown back by Long Chen’s lightning sword. Now, Long Chen was filled with killing intent. After forcing back that expert with a lightning sword, he threw the lightning sphere in his left hand.

“World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

BOOM!

The sphere of lightning shot toward the Ghost Dao expert, causing him to instantly have a bad feeling. After all, thunderforce had a restrictive effect on the Ghost Dao lifeform. He wanted to run, but Long Chen had timed it perfectly, so it directly detonated.

The next moment, lightning filled the sky, leaving the Ghost Dao lifeform no longer able to transform into black mist. He was then blasted into the distance.

As he coughed up blood, the black qi around him vanished. But when they saw his appearance, everyone was shocked.

He was not a human but a corpse, and his face had decayed to the point where bones were visible. He actually resembled a corpse that had just crawled out of a tomb.

The blood he coughed up was as black as ink, with many things mixed inside it. It looked extremely frightening.

“It would be rude not to reciprocate. You can have a taste of my attack as well!”

After a short moment of shock, Long Chen raised his sword, and all the thunderforce of the world was absorbed into it.

“Split the Heavens 4!”

Long Chen then slashed down with a boundless will of annihilation at the Ghost Dao lifeform.
