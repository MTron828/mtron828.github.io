Chapter 3920 Fighting Powerful Enemies

Dong Mingyu caught the dagger and smoothly used it, perfectly intercepting Ji Wuming’s attack.

Ji Wuming’s dagger was covered in a layer of white light, representing his faith divine radiance, which effortlessly cut apart Dong Mingyu’s daggers.

However, now that she wielded the dagger that Long Chen had given her, that impervious, unstoppable light actually had a nick cut into it. It turned out that Dong Mingyu’s dagger displayed great resistance toward faith energy.

With the dagger in her grasp, Dong Mingyu was revitalized. She then executed a movement art, summoning multiple figures that swiftly unleashed a tempest of attacks toward Ji Wuming.

Facing this, despite the support of his faith energy, Ji Wuming found himself retreating in a state of panic. His faith energy was terrifying, but no matter how great the power was, it was meaningless if it couldn’t strike its target.

Even with Ji Wuming’s control over spacetime and his status as a Double Supreme, his movement art and speed were clearly a level lower than Dong Mingyu’s. Thus, now that his faith energy was rendered ineffective, Dong Mingyu’s onslaught left him gasping for breath and on the verge of coughing up blood.

On the other side, Long Aotian, Kun Tu, Shi Yang, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and Weng Tianyao were still attacking Long Chen.

All of them were unleashing their full power: burning their souls, igniting their blood, and summoning their faith energy. All kinds of trump cards were used at this moment. They knew that this was no longer a matter of maintaining their dignity or getting the dragon blood.

If they were to lose today, with so many of them joining forces against Long Chen, their Dao-hearts would be broken. If that happened, a heart-devil would very likely emerge during their next tribulation. In fact, Long Chen might be replicated by the Heavenly Daos to face them in their heavenly tribulation, and in the end, they would still die because of him.

As everyone fought, Long Aotian and Kun Tu’s power continuously rose, as if power was welling out of them limitlessly. It was as if they were using Long Chen to temper themselves, to grasp a better understanding of their own power.

Not willing to be outdone, Shi Yang, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and Weng Tianyao unleashed a barrage of devastating techniques, showcasing their own formidable powers.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Weng Tianyao in particular was attacking crazily. His lightning tower was unleashing rays of divine light, constantly interfering with Long Chen. In fact, he was trying to suck Long Chen inside the tower.

“Bad fellow, take this!” Suddenly, Lei Linger appeared and attacked Weng Tianyao, using the Wild Blade in her hand to stab him.

Contrary to everyone’s expectation, seeing Lei Linger come out, Weng Tianyao was actually delighted. “I was waiting for you! Lightning Seize Curse!”

Lei Linger then let out a startled cry. The Wild Blade actually escaped her control and flew toward Weng Tianyao.

As Weng Tianyao firmly grasped the sword, a torrent of lightning erupted from its surface, illuminating the battlefield with its brilliance. At the same time, his lightning tower was rumbling along with him. When these two divine items formed a resonance, their berserk power flowed into Weng Tianyao, causing his aura to grow explosively.

This tower and blade were a set of lightning divine items, one used for offense and the other for defense. Hence, it was only once Weng Tianyao had both of these divine items that he could unleash his full thunderforce.

“Die!”

Wielding the Wild Blade, Weng Tianyao let out a furious roar that summoned raging lightning, which actually forced back Long Aotian, Kun Tu, Shi Yang, Yin Changsheng, and the Nine Underworld Luocha.

As the Wild Blade slashed down, lightning unfurled and an ear-splitting explosion shook the world.

Facing it, Long Chen unleashed a punch and was actually forced to retreat by the impact. With every step, the void beneath his feet collapsed.

“Long Chen, why don’t you keep acting arrogant? This is my true power, and it is time for you to die!” Weng Tianyao laughed almost like a madman.

When his Wild Blade was snatched, he was incredibly aggrieved. Without it, he couldn’t properly unleash his thunderforce. Although the lightning tower was powerful, it wasn’t a true offensive divine item, so using it to fight was naturally difficult.

Now that he had finally reclaimed the Wild Blade, he could no longer suppress the furious rage inside of him. As lightning flashed beneath his feet, he shot at Long Chen alone. It seemed that he wanted a one-on-one fight against Long Chen.

In front of the indomitable Weng Tianyao, Long Chen slowly raised his hand and beckoned slightly. Everyone looked at him oddly.

Seeing this gesture, Weng Tianyao smiled sinisterly and then lit up the lightning runes on his sword and the lightning tower behind him. As his power crazily climbed, the two lightning divine items grew brighter and brighter.

However, just as the intensity of their light reached its peak, both of Weng Tianyao’s lightning divine items vanished.

“What?!”

Weng Tianyao was dumbfounded. He was originally charging toward Long Chen confidently, so in an instant, he panicked when he found himself unarmed and defenseless.

However, while he panicked, Long Chen didn’t. Now, the hand that he had raised viciously struck Weng Tianyao in the face, sending Weng Tianyao flying like a shooting star that left behind a streak of lightning in its wake.

Mo Nian and the others were also surprised and found it funny. This odd scene was truly surprising.

Just how arrogant had Weng Tianyao been just now? But in the blink of an eye, he was sent flying miserably. It was quite the visual impact.

“Weng Tianyao, why don’t you keep acting arrogant? This is my true power, and it’s time for you to die!”

To everyone’s surprise, Lei Linger held the Wild Blade in her hand, and a lightning tower materialized behind her. With a pleased expression, she spat back Weng Tianyao’s words to himself.

BOOM!

Struck by the Wild Blade, Weng Tianyao hacked up blood and was blown even further back.

“Bitch!” Weng Tianyao roared crazily.

“You’re the bitch! You’re going to curse people just because you fell for their trick? What a bitch, what an idiot! Did you think that I would return the Wild Blade to you so easily? You’re too naive. I just wanted the Wild Blade to commune with your tower so that they could both renounce the dark and join the light. Come to realize the truth, you bitch!” Lei Linger shouted back at him before continuing to attack with the Wild Blade. Having lost his weapons, Weng Tianyao was forced back miserably, repeatedly coughing up blood.

He tried to reclaim his divine weapons using secret arts multiple times, but in Lei Linger’s hands, the Wild Blade and the tower didn’t even seem to recognize him. No matter what technique he used, they ignored him.

Weng Tianyao roared furiously, but mere roars couldn’t do anything. He was forced back miserably by Lei Linger, unable to even counterattack. He wanted to run, but he was also unwilling to lose both of his peerless divine weapons. Thus, he was still doing everything he could to reclaim them.

On the other side, with Weng Tianyao out of the picture, Long Aotian, Kun Tu, Shi Yang, Yin Changsheng, and the Nine Underworld Luocha’s attacks grew smoother as they fought Long Chen.

Suddenly, Shi Yang’s wings exploded, and countless black blood runes transformed into millions of corpse insects that burrowed into his body. As a result, Shi Yang’s body cackled and creaked.

“Hahaha! It’s finally complete! Although I lose the two wings, it’s worth it to truly awaken this divine ability! Long Chen, take this!”

As Shi Yang raised his head and laughed, his immemorial aura erupted like a volcano. However, this corpse of his actually withered.

Following that, a withered hand reached toward Long Chen. At the center of its sharp claws was a horrifying rune that looked like the eye of a devil. When it appeared, a terrifying deathly will instantly locked onto Long Chen.
