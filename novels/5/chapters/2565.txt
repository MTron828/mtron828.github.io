Chapter 2554 Heaven Merging Realm

Countless eyes were locked onto Long Chen, unable to believe what they were seeing. An expert above Netherpassage had just been killed in one blow?

The fact that Ye Liangchen was able to silently injure that expert had shocked them. But Long Chen was even more exaggerated, blasting him apart with one punch.

For a moment, everyone was silent. They could only stare as the bloody mist fell and dispersed. That was the final brilliance of an expert above Netherpassage. It was exceptionally bright and spectacular.

Daoist Heavenly Feather shook her head, lightly saying, “The sea demon race has a short-term memory. Ye Liangchen didn’t kill that guy, instead injuring him as a warning. He didn’t realize though that Sovereign sprouts possess the power to fight across realms. If he was not on guard, they could kill him. After that, he wanted to use his realm advantage to trick Long Chen’s senses and capture him. Considering that he was suppressing his aura, even though the tortoise race specializes in defense, he couldn’t endure an attack from Long Chen. Not even ten lives would have been enough.”

Through Daoist Heavenly Feather’s explanation, everyone realized that he had been vainly trying to capture Long Chen. Considering his full power had been suppressed, it was understandable how he could be killed in one blow.

The other tortoise elder suddenly began to shine, and that light transformed the world’s Heavenly Dao energy. It became foreign, as if the Heavenly Dao energy had now given themselves to a master.

After that, the tortoise elder roared and attacked Long Chen. The laws of heaven and earth were compressed under his palm, and multicolored runes enveloped it.

Those runes contained metal, wood, water, fire, and earth energies. In this world, no one was capable of controlling so many different energies at the same time because the different energies would suppress each other. One slip up would instantly cause a backlash.

However, this tortoise elder’s palm was clearly covered by those energies. In fact, those energies seemed to be supporting him of their own accord. As a result, the void rumbled and a huge palm-image appeared, covering heaven and earth.

At this moment, the earth began to sink. This palm seemed to possess the power to destroy the land.

“This is the power of those above Netherpassage? With the wave of his hand, all the Daos are summoned. It is one with the will of heaven and earth. How could anyone block this palm?!” Startled cries rang out.

The death of the other elder of the sea demon race had infuriated this tortoise elder. In his fury, he directly unleashed a full-power attack, not giving a damn about Long Chen’s life or death.

However, even in the face of this berserk attack, Long Chen merely snorted. He then unleashed his own palm.

Had he gone mad? Everyone was startled. Long Chen was definitely crazy to face the attack directly.

BOOM!

The two palms crashed together, shaking the land and the stars, but the intense explosion everyone was expecting didn’t occur.

The space surrounding Long Chen and the elder was covered in black cracks. Countless black ripples were surging around them.

Within that mass of chaos, Long Chen appeared completely emotionless, while the tortoise elder was filled with shock. Even as runes lit up on his shell and the veins on his arm bulged, he was unable to shake Long Chen.

Both of their energies were concentrated on one point, and black ripples continued to flicker around them, emitting a terrifying pressure.

“He actually blocked it.”

Jaws dropped. Long Chen was able to receive the full-power attack of an expert above Netherpassage, and seemingly without any effort at that.

“Using world energy to make up for the difference in realms. How shocking.” Daoist Heavenly Feather mumbled to herself, nodding in praise.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Of everyone present, perhaps only she was able to see that Long Chen’s current power stemmed from his world energy.

After reaching the twelfth Heavenstage of Netherpassage, Long Chen had finally learned how to perfectly control his world energy. He now knew how to link together his astral spaces with his Six Star Battle Armor.

Not only did this allow his power to soar, but it also gave him unprecedented control over that power. Furthermore, on the Martial Heaven Continent, he clearly felt that it was no longer such a burden to summon the Six Star Battle Armor.

Although there were still some sharp pains throughout his body, it wasn’t the same as in the Star Field Divine World when his flesh was literally exploding off of him. One reason was due to the increase in his realm, but another reason seemed to be that the Martial Heaven Continent’s laws were more suited to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

In this state, Long Chen didn’t even need to draw out the life energy of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees. He could maintain this state easily, filling him with greater confidence.

In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Chen was facing the sea demon race’s elder. Black runes whirled around them, emitting a space-tearing sound.

Although no one got close to the battlefield, they could still sense the apocalyptic power contained within those black runes.

After a while, Long Chen narrowed his eyes and looked at the black runes around him. He suddenly smiled. “I understand. To become one with the spirit of the world in order to control the laws, to use life and death to merge into the Heavenly Daos. My guess is that the next realm is called the Heaven Merging realm.”

When the name of the Heaven Merging realm came out of Long Chen’s mouth, Qu Jianying, the old man, and the other experts of the senior generation twitched.

At this moment, the void up in the sky was torn open, and a giant black sword mercilessly slashed down toward Long Chen.

“It’s over.”

Qu Jianying bitterly closed her eyes. Long Chen was never smart around her. Why did he have to be smart enough to guess the name of this realm?

This was a forbidden name. The first person in every generation to spit it out would face the wrath of the heavens. In every generation, some people died because their mouths were too loose. This time, it was Long Chen.

In that instant, the world froze and no one could move. Heavenly Dao energy flooded the air, and people could only watch as that black sword fell.

That black sword contained the might of the heavens and represented the will of the world. In front of it, people appeared insignificant, and they couldn’t even form an urge to resist. This was a power that sparked despair. This was the wrath of the heavens.

If the Heavenly Daos wanted to kill a person, no one could avoid it. So when Long Chen said the name of the Heaven Merging realm, everyone’s heart turned cold.

At this moment, the black sword slashed down, and Long Chen as well as the tortoise elder were both devoured by it. As a result, a bottomless hole appeared in the ground where the black sword fell.

Even the walls of this hole had turned black, emitting a destructive aura.

“Fuck, did I say something wrong?” Long Chen’s curse rang out from within that black hole, shocking everyone. They saw him safe and sound.

“The wrath of the heavens has been dodged? How is that possible? No one can escape such a thing!” Seeing Long Chen still standing there, everyone was stunned. This was in defiance of an iron rule.

Qu Jianying and the others were overjoyed to see this, especially Li Tianxuan. He was the one who was aware that Long Chen would very likely die to the Heavenly Daos, so that attack just now had been truly frightening.

“I didn’t think that you actually have some ability. It just so happens that I, Ye Liangchen, don’t kill nameless nobodies. Only now are you worth me killing.” Ye Liangchen stepped forward, appearing in front of Long Chen in an instant and sending a kick at Long Chen’s face.

Right at the start, Ye Liangchen already used an insulting attack. It was unknown if he truly didn’t care about Long Chen or if he was simply trying to antagonize him.

“A loser also dares to say such big words? If you didn’t flee like a dog back then, you would have long since died to heavenly tribulation. Are you a pig with no memory?” sneered Long Chen.

In the face of Ye Liangchen’s kick, Long Chen didn’t move to receive it. If he received it, then he would be truly humiliated.

Instead, he flicked a finger, and a small blood-colored lotus flew out at Ye Liangchen.

It was very small, the size of a longan fruit. Despite that, it contained a terrifying power, as this miniature lotus was the World Extermination Flame Lotus.

Using Long Chen’s essence blood plus Huo Linger’s soul essence as a foundation, it was instantly condensed. This was a technique that Huo Linger had learned after absorbing the myriad flames within the Star Field Divine World.

Although this attack didn’t possess the full power of the World Extermination Flame Lotus, its killing power could be said to be even greater due to its brief casting time. Even a peak expert could be killed in an instant if caught off-guard.

Sixty-three stars floated above the lotus. This was a seven-star World Extermination Flame Lotus.

It was particularly strong because Huo Linger had fully recovered thanks to the mother tree’s help. She was even absorbing the karmic hell flames to strengthen herself further.

At this moment, Ye Liangchen was startled to sense immense danger from this small lotus. However, he was already unleashing his kick, and if he dodged, it would cost him the initiative. Seeing no other way around it, he summoned his manifestation.

“Stars Illuminate the Cosmos!”

A field of stars appeared behind Ye Liangchen. Those millions of stars seemed to even pack the dome of the heavens within them.

BOOM!

Ye Liangchen’s foot slammed into Long Chen’s flame lotus. Flames unfurled, devouring the heavens.
