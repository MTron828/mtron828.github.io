Chapter 2196 Barbarian Blood Silver Body

“Fool, I’d advise you not to go.” Seeing the man from the Six Horned Sea Serpent man leave him, Long Chen smiled.

“Worry about yourself.” Dongfang Yuyang was pleased with this turn of events and even used the Astral Ancient Castle to keep Long Chen tied down here so he couldn’t help the Dragonblood Legion.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man flew straight to the Dragonblood Legion. Seeing that, Qu Jianying was about to give the order to support the Dragonblood Legion when Yu Xiaoyun and the others appeared in front of them.

“What? Does the Martial Heaven Alliance wish to continue harboring rebels?” sneered Yu Xiaoyun.

All the experts from Pill Valley, the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, and the Xuan Beasts had come. The old man smiled and reached for the Heaven Splitting Blade on his back.

“Hahaha!” Just at this moment, Guo Ran’s arrogant laughter rang out. “Little fellow, you couldn’t beat my boss, so you want to run rampant here? Are you sure you weren’t dropped on the head as a child? Be careful of being beaten to the point that not even your mother recognizes you.”

“Die, ants!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent man roared, raising his trident.

“Wilde, wake up! Someone’s stealing your meat!” Guo Ran suddenly shouted into the ear of the Sleeping Wilde.

“What?!”

Wilde instantly shot up, furious. He immediately saw the Six Horn Sea Serpent man.

“No, he’s the real food!” When Wilde saw him, his eyes lit up. Looking like a hungry beast, Wilde shot toward him without any further prompting from Guo Ran. “Stop and let me eat you!”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man stumbled, almost tripping. His expression twisted in fury. Long Chen’s slaps had been infuriating enough, but now he was actually being treated as food? He slammed his bone trident at Wilde. “Die!”

Wilde smashed his giant bone club forward. As a result, Wilde went flying, flipping through the air.

This result shocked Qu Jianying and the others. This giant foolish oaf was actually able to block the Six Horn Sea Serpent man? In their opinion, Wilde should have been directly killed by his terrifying power.

BOOM!

Wilde crawled up from the ground, roared, and once more charged forward, a bloodthirsty light in his eyes.

As he charged forward, his body began to grow. A terrifying Blood Qi rose out of him, and spots of silver started to appear on his skin until his entire body turned silver. He had transformed into a three-hundred-meter giant.

“He...?!” Seeing this silver giant, everyone, including the Six Horn Sea Serpent man, jumped in shock. How could a human become so big?

“Is he from the legendary ancient barbarian race? How is that possible? Weren’t they all killed off a long time ago?!” cried out an extremely old-looking elder.

“I’ll beat you to death!” Wilde’s bone club grew with him, and he smashed it down. Only then did the Six Horn Sea Serpent man recover from his shock and hastily raise his bone trident.

A huge wave of earth exploded beyond the horizon. The distant experts were forced to dodge.

As others were stunned by the sight, Long Chen smiled ever so slightly. Wilde had eaten so much that he started to get picky about his food. He only wanted peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts to eat now, and only those with powerful physical bodies at that.

He had transformed from his original copper body to silver body, and furthermore, there was some faint gold color on his hands, feet, knees, elbows, and shoulders.

From Yue Xihan, Long Chen had learned that due to eating so much, Wilde had broken past the limit of the Barbarian Blood Silver Body and was starting to turn golden.

Yue Xihan said that Wilde possessed the emperor bloodline amongst the barbarian race, the blood barbarian. They awakened the power of their bloodline purely by eating meat. As long as Wilde had enough meat, he could eat to the peak of the Martial Dao.

In the entire Dragonblood Legion, the only one who could match Long Chen in power was Wilde. The outsiders present had not expected there to be another such existence within the Dragonblood Legion.

“Bastard, die!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent man was shocked and enraged. This blow had caused his arms to feel numb. Using some unknown secret art, he also grew larger and once more raised his trident.

As a result, Wilde’s club came sweeping toward him, and Wilde didn’t even look at the trident. It looked like a suicidal exchange of death blows, dumbfounding the Six Horn Sea Serpent man. They had just started exchanging blows; was this oaf really a fool?

He naturally refused such an exchange. His hurried block resulted in him being blown into the distance.

He furiously got back up and stabbed his trident at Wilde’s chest, the tip shining with a cold light.

However, Wilde continued to ignore him. No matter what attack the Six Horn Sea Serpent man used, Wilde would simply launch his own attack and ignore the Six Horn Sea Serpent man. As his trident was about to stab into Wilde’s chest. Wilde’s club also reached his chest.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man felt like he would explode in fury. Was this fellow an idiot? At that critical moment, he hastily switched to defense, resulting in him being sent flying once more. The experts in the distance stood with their jaws hanging open. So the Dragonblood Legion had been hiding such a terrifying expert. It even seemed that Wilde was stronger than Long Chen, as he had sent this terrifying expert flying twice in a row.

“Bastard, do you want to try it again?!”

This time, the Six Horn Sea Serpent man went through with his attack, stabbing his trident into Wilde’s chest. However, he suddenly found that he was unable to push it more than a few inches in. Wilde’s physical body had reached an unimaginable level. It was even tougher than a divine item.

Just at that moment, Wilde’s club smashed into his ribs. He felt a sharp pain and was once more sent flying.

Fresh blood flowed out of Wilde’s chest. However, he simply rubbed his chest forcibly and the blood flow ceased. With an angry howl, he charged forward once more, seemingly fine.

The two of them began a fierce fight. After a while, the Six Horn Sea Serpent man coughed up blood, not from being injured but from rage.

Wilde was fighting like an idiot, thinking only of how to attack without caring about being struck. He had no variations at all. The Six Horn Sea Serpent man had never encountered such a fighting style, and worst of all, Wilde’s physical body was even stronger than his. His injuries simply automatically healed.

The reason the Six Horn Sea Serpent man had coughed up blood in particular was because after one exchange, Wilde had taken out something and popped it into his mouth. He had seen it clearly. That was a peak twelfth rank Magical Beast that had been compressed by spatial laws. Wilde had actually gotten hungry and was really viewing him as food.

“Fuck you all, you bastards conned me!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent man refused to keep fighting. He ran back toward Long Chen’s battlefield, cursing Dongfang Yuyang and the others.

At first, he had thought that they weren’t that bad, helping him hold back Long Chen while he vented his rage from Long Chen’s dragon might. However, there was actually someone even more terrifying in the Dragonblood Legion, a complete idiot who couldn’t be reasoned with. The Six Horn Sea Serpent man felt used.

His bone trident went smashing for Kun Pengzi. Shocked, Kun Pengzi’s hasty block resulted in him coughing up blood.

“Have you gone crazy?!” raged Kun Pengzi.

“You dare to curse me?! I’ll kill- hey!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent man was about to attack Kun Pengzi again when Wilde caught up to him, once more smashing with his club and sending him flying.

At this moment, the other sea demons charged forward in a wave. Seeing their leader at a disadvantage, they were no longer content to keep watching.

Those sea demons collapsed on Wilde, Kun Pengzi, and Long Chen. Some of them even went after Dongfang Yuyang, Tian Xiezi, and Shi Lingfeng. The battlefield was submerged by their giant army, throwing everything into chaos.

“What is going on?” Qu Jianying and the others were simply dumbfounded. They didn’t even know how to react to such a twist. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“You water-headed idiots, why are you attacking us?!” cursed Shi Lingfeng.

Immediately, a mass of sea demons attacked him from every direction. It seemed that they didn’t like being called water heads.

“There’s a chance!” As the battlefield was thrown into chaos, Long Chen’s eyes suddenly brightened. Forcing back Dongfang Yuyang, he turned into a bolt of lightning, charging through the sea demons toward Shi Lingfeng.
