“Long Chen... are you alright?!”

Being suddenly hugged by Long Chen, Ye Zhiqiu cried out in alarm. Long Chen’s eyes were even slightly red, frightening her.

Long Chen hastily looked around. Hesitating, he decided to quickly pull Ye Zhiqiu to the auction room.

Ye Zhiqiu looked at Long Chen oddly, not knowing what had happened to him. The two of them walked in and saw that the middle-aged man had been waiting for them.

“Here are your underworld spirit beads...”

“May I ask if you can help me purchase Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva with these underworld spirit beads?” asked Long Chen, not accepting them.

“I can, but exchanging so much isn’t something I have the authority for. I’ll need to get permission from higher-ups,” said the middle-aged man hesitatingly.

Long Chen nodded. “That’s fine. Please go request permission. I’ll leave these underworld spirit beads with you for now. If it’s convenient, can you arrange a private room for me?”

Seeing Long Chen pull Ye Zhiqiu away quickly like a wild monkey, the middle-aged man and the other disciples of the Dongfang family present had odd expressions.

“Youngsters really have a lot of energy,” said the middle-aged man in the end. He suddenly turned to those other disciples. “What are you looking at? Do you think just looking will allow you to become experts? Being envious is useless! Get to work!”

After chiding those disciples, the middle-aged man left to see if he could convert the underworld spirit beads into Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva for Long Chen.

...

“Long Chen, what are you in such a rush for?” Ye Zhiqiu had been pulled into an alchemy room by Long Chen. Seeing his excited appearance, she was lost.

“Take a look.”

Long Chen took out a small thing that looked like a yam. It was only the thickness of a thumb and three inches long, but Long Chen looked like flowers were about to bloom out of his smile.

“This is...?” Ye Zhiqiu looked at it. There was still some mud stuck to it, so she vaguely felt it to be familiar but didn’t recognize it.

“It’s the Infinite Eight Bitters Root!” chortled Long Chen.

“You actually managed to grow it?!” Ye Zhiqiu was stunned. Although she didn’t know of the primal chaos bead, she knew that Long Chen had the ability to grow precious medicines.

“Hehe, it actually worked.” Long Chen clenched his fist excitedly.

When he had first planted it, he had come to the conclusion that the Infinite Eight Bitters Root was already fully dead. There hadn’t been any reaction.

However, the withered root that he had planted had split apart, becoming multiple smaller roots. Long Chen had assumed that it had simply rotted, but within those rotten parts lay one tiny seed after another. The parent body had withered, becoming nourishment for them, and they rapidly grew.

Just now, the reason why Long Chen had shouted suddenly was because he had randomly checked the primal chaos space and had seen them.

This Infinite Eight Bitters Root in his hand wasn’t fully grown yet. Once it was mature, it would be the thickness of a baby’s fist and be a foot long. Only then would it possess enough medicinal effect.

Fortunately, that wasn’t a problem in the primal chaos space. He circulated his spiritual yuan, making the Infinite Eight Bitters Roots rapidly grow. The first batch quickly matured.

The Infinite Eight Bitters Root was very interesting. There were actual male and female roots. The male ones grew faster and didn’t grow leaves. They were just one isolated root.

As for the female roots, once they grew large enough, a straight pole would grow out of it. It wouldn’t grow leaves either, but it would have flowers. The flowers would bloom, and every flower had different designs. The flowers didn’t bear fruit.

Once the female roots were fully matured, the root would quickly wither. Then there would be dozens to hundreds of tiny seeds inside it that would slowly grow by consuming the original root’s nutrients.

Normally, those roots would have very stringent requirements for what kind of environment they would grow in. Even in the ancient era, it couldn’t be planted in large numbers. But that wasn’t a problem in the primal chaos space.

“Zhiqiu, I’m going to refine pills. Just keep an eye out for any intrusions and help me when I run out of Spiritual Strength,” said Long Chen.

“Alright.” Ye Zhiqiu nodded. Her spiritual yuan contained ice energy, so it couldn’t be shared. But her Spiritual Strength was the same as an ordinary person’s Spiritual Strength as long as she didn’t deliberately activate her cultivation technique.

Long Chen took out the Moon and Star Refining Furnace and directly started refining. This time, he added in a bit of the Infinite Eight Bitters Root’s powder.

This medicinal powder contained eight kinds of bitterness, which were eight kinds of realms. It was extremely profound.

What Long Chen added in was the bitterness of birth, of life. It had a cohesive power, which allowed more medicinal powders to merge together.

This bitterness matched the Pill Dao. Hundreds of ingredients would merge into one furnace and have their essence condensed, being born into a pill.

The Infinite Eight Bitters Root was a priceless treasure for alchemists. After refining out its bitterness of birth, adding it would increase the chances of a successful refinement by thirty percent. That was a heaven-defying ability.

In just an incense stick’s worth of time, he had finished merging the powders. He closed the lid and gradually increased the power of his flame.

“Before this, it took me two hours to finish the merger, but this time, it was done in just an incense stick’s worth of time. Furthermore, there were several moments where I was treading on thin ice last time, but they are much easier now. This Infinite Eight Bitters Root really is a priceless treasure.” Long Chen was ecstatic. Just this treasure alone was enough to be worth him coming to this gathering.

As his flame energy grew more intense, the starry runes on the Moon and Star Refining Furnace slowly lit up. After being nourished by the Heavenly Spirit Water, it had started to instinctively help him more, saving his Spiritual Strength.

The flames grew increasingly intense. The furnace was rumbling and shaking. Rather than letting up, Long Chen increased his flame energy.

More runes appeared on the furnace, and they were like flower petals. The rumbling caused the entire room to shake.

“Zhiqiu, help me out!” shouted Long Chen.

Ye Zhiqiu, who had been prepared, formed a hand seal. Spiritual Strength surged out of her, forming a spiritual chain between her and Long Chen.

With her Spiritual Strength helping him as well, Long Chen felt the pressure lighten. He continued increasing his flame energy.

BOOM!

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace suddenly shook intensely one final time before becoming silent. Long Chen slowly opened the lid.

There was a plump pill lying quietly at the bottom, with countless flower marks flowing around it. Its color was constantly changing.

“How beautiful.” Ye Zhiqiu couldn’t help praising it. The marks moving around the pill looked like they were alive.

“It’ll get even more beautiful in a bit.” Long Chen smiled.

Nine tiny lightning dragons appeared, circling the furnace. Thunderforce slowly flowed inside.

As the thunderforce entered the Moon and Star Refining Furnace, the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill inside shuddered slightly. Light blossomed out of it. It was like a slumbering spirit was being woken by the thunderforce.

This was the special ability of pill lightning. It stimulated a pill’s sense of danger, and to survive the pill carved out all its potential. It was a forceful awakening of the spirit.

Using a formation over a long time to slowly nourish the spirit was different. Although it could also awaken a pill’s spirituality, without that sensation of standing beside death’s door, the potential that could be carved out was limited.

Having its potential carved out by a formation was passive. On the other hand, being surrounded by pill lightning and wanting to survive, the pill would actively do its best to carve out its potential. So there was a large difference in medicinal effect between tribulation pills and ordinary top grade eleventh tier pills.

As Lei Long increased the power step by step, the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill’s power also grew. Flowers of light appeared around it, blocking the thunderforce.

Eventually, the pill came out of the furnace. It was covered in beautiful flowers that blocked the lightning dragons. That scene stunned Ye Zhiqiu. She had personally witnessed a pile of medicinal powders become this terrifying spirit pill.

Finally, the lightning retracted and a beautiful pill appeared in Long Chen’s hand. Everything within a one-foot radius was filled with a hundred different kinds of petals. The petals resonated with the Heavenly Daos, filling the room with its Dao charm.

“Come test the effect.” Long Chen tossed the pill to Ye Zhiqiu.

“Me? Isn’t that a waste?” Ye Zhiqiu’s eyes opened wide, not daring to accept.

After all, Long Chen had put the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill up for auction, and it had sold for a huge sum. How could she be willing to consume a pill of similar value?

“Go ahead. Top grade eleventh tier tribulation pills might be priceless to other people, but they’re like cabbages to me. If you want to eat more, just ask!” Long Chen smiled. “Just eat it. Because I cannot sense the Heavenly Daos, I won’t get an accurate understanding of its effect. I need to know whether this pill will be effective for our brothers and sisters, and if it can help them awaken their manifestations to become true Empyreans.”

This was Long Chen’s ultimate goal in refining the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill. If it worked, then as long as he had enough time, he would have a powerful legion that wouldn’t fear any power or expert.

Ye Zhiqiu swallowed the pill, and flowers bloomed all across her body. Every flower had fine black strands that absorbed the surrounding Grand Dao energy and poured it into Ye Zhiqiu.

“What powerful Grand Dao energy! I can clearly sense it. The Heavenly Daos have instantly become clear, and even my mental realm is advancing explosively. Long Chen, this is definitely effective. As long as they have enough of these pills, every Dragonblood warrior can awaken their manifestation!” exclaimed Ye Zhiqiu.

“Haha, good! So what if those monsters have come out? Once my Dragonblood Legion rises, I’ll still slap whoever messes around!”

Long Chen laughed, a grand feeling filling his heart. He finally had the power to be confident once more. Come! Let’s see who’s afraid of who!
