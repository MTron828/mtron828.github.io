Chapter 3765: Out of Control World Extermination Flame Lotus

“We’ll blast through them!”

Long Chen’s gaze swept out. He didn’t see that many experts amongst these people. Even the strongest ones were only half-step Divine Venerates.

BOOM!

Jiang Lei attacked one of the half–step Divine Venerates with his lightning sword and destroyed the latter’s weapon. He hacked up blood and flew back.

It went without saying that after experiencing so much this year, after struggling by the border of death for so long, Jiang Lei’s combat experience was incomparable. He directly challenged that expert in his weakest area, striking accurately and ruthlessly. Even against an opponent just as strong as him, he would probably be able to determine victory or defeat in just a few moves.

That half-step Divine Venerate was severely injured in just one attack. He couldn’t help being shocked. Suddenly, he waved his hand, and a ray of divine light soared into the sky, exploding like a firework. It illuminated the heavens.

“A signal?”

Long Chen was slightly startled. He immediately shot forward and unleashed a follow-up attack on that half-step Divine Venerate. The Minghong Saber pierced through his head.

“Not good. There are seven Divine Venerates in the surroundings.” After killing him and checking his memories, Long Chen’s expression changed.

“Let’s go!”

There was no time to deal with the riff-raff. Long Chen and Jiang Lei shot through them. If a Divine Venerate were to appear, Long Chen might not be afraid. If he couldn’t beat them, he’d run.

But against two Divine Venerates? They might not even have a chance to run. Long Chen randomly chose a direction.

As a result? The more you worried about something, the more likely it would happen. Long Chen actually ended up running into three groups, all of them led by Divine Venerates.

“Damn human race, have you come to send yourselves to your deaths?!”

The three Divine Venerates didn’t give Long Chen any chance. They directly attacked, seeking to kill the two of them in an instant.

“Divine ring, battle armor!”

Long Chen roared and unleashed his full power. He directly charged at one of the Divine Venerates. At the same time, Huo Linger and Lei Linger went after the other two.

“Split the Heavens 3!”

Long Chen pointed his saber at the heavens. He immediately started off with his strongest attack. When violet qi wrapped around his saber, stars danced. Holding his saber with both hands, he slashed down like a heavenly river of stars.

BOOM!

That Divine Venerate seemed startled by Long Chen’s power. The moment that he was locked onto by Long Chen’s attack, it was too late to take out his weapon. Long Chen’s saber landed directly on his arms, and both of them exploded into blood mist.

“World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

After the Divine Venerate’s arms were destroyed, Jiang Lei smashed a lightning sphere into his body. The demonic beast screamed and was blown back. He smashed into the sea of blood, leaving giant ripples.

Just then, another huge explosion unleashed a wave of lightning. Lei Linger was blown apart by her opponent’s divine weapon.

Clearly, the current Lei Linger could not challenge a Divine Venerate. As for Huo Linger, she exchanged a direct blow with the True Fire Sword against her opponent and was also knocked back a few steps. Her opponent staggered. This moment showed off Huo Linger’s new power.

“Let’s go!”

As the blockade was broken, Long Chen grabbed Jiang Lei and charged forward. He chose to go for the weakest one amongst the three to break through.

However, just as they were about to break through, a huge net appeared in front of them. The other demonic beasts in this group were using some unknown divine ability. Joining forces, they actually summoned a barrier.

“Courting death!”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Long Chen was enraged. If they were blocked by this net, even for just a single breath, they would definitely die.

The Minghong Saber once more accumulated power, and Split the Heavens slashed down. However, Long Chen was shocked to find that the barrier was flexible and elastic. It was like he had struck a faith barrier. Not only was he blocked, but his attack actually rebounded.

The two Divine Venerates roared and charged at the two of them. Their weapons whistled toward them.

Long Chen suddenly shoved Jiang Lei, and using that force, he also retreated. They both dodged the attacks of the Divine Venerates. It was only thanks to the fact that their fellow demonic beasts were nearby that the two Divine Venerates weren’t unleashing their full power. They were afraid of injuring their own people.

Clearly, these people were prepared. Not only were there Divine Venerates, but even the other experts knew combination techniques. This was all to prevent outsiders from entering the Heavenly River Blood Sea.

“Boss, I’ll block them. You go!”

Seeing a Divine Venerate in front of him and the net barrier behind him, as well as the blood sea starting to ripple, showing that the other Divine Venerate was about to fly out, Jiang Lei shouted and prepared to charge out.

“No need!” Long Chen shouted. He held his left elbow with his right hand, and his left hand was raised toward the heavens. A snow-white lotus appeared in his hand, as sacred chanting filled the air.

When the chanting rang out, the blood sea roared and the void rumbled. The blood-colored sky was actually torn apart by a mysterious energy. Countless cracks appeared.

Flame energy then poured through those cracks, gathering toward Long Chen. In just the blink of an eye, his lotus covered the sky.

Long Chen was using the Nirvana Scripture, but he himself was shocked. The flame energy of heaven and earth seemed to go crazy this time. It was flowing to him in such an amount that it was out of his control.

Most terrifying of all, this was no more than the third volume. Let alone the newly learned fifth volume, he didn’t even dare to use the fourth volume.

Just as Long Chen was shocked, the flame lotus instantly grew to a size of ten thousand miles. The white lotus was surrounded by black cracks and ripples. It was like the world could not contain its power.

“Big brother Long Chen, the World Extermination Flame Lotus is about to go out of control!” Huo Linger cried out in shock. She was panicking as well. This huge stream of energy was overflowing.

Long Chen didn’t dare to tarry. He directly tossed out the rapidly expanding lotus. It was no longer under control.

BOOM!

As soon as it left his hand, it exploded. Long Chen himself was blasted back, almost being killed. If it weren’t for his powerful physical body, he’d have definitely died.

A white ripple devoured this world. Those demonic beasts didn’t even get a chance to scream before they were turned into ice fragments.

Long Chen didn’t even know how far he was blown back. He felt the world spinning around him, and he hacked up blood.

Huo Linger transformed into a flame dragon and carried Jiang Lei. Even with her protection, Jiang Lei was no better off than Long Chen. Cracks covered his body as if he might shatter at any moment.

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen and Jiang Lei didn’t bother looking at the aftermath. They directly used their thunderforce to run.

BOOM!

The two of them had just left when three wretched figures appeared out of the unstable void. It was precisely those three demonic beast Divine Venerates. Only the three of them had survived this attack.

“Chase!”

The three of them roared and shot after the two of them.
