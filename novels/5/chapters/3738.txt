Chapter 3727 Grand Dao Flower

Long Chen, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and eighteen Dragonblood warriors stood together. Xia Guhong was also standing by their side.

“The gate is about to open. Take care. The spatial gate will automatically draw you in, so you won’t even need to enter it yourselves. You just have to be wary about other people launching sneak attacks at that time. That is because you will be sucked into a spatial current once you’re in. This spatial current cannot be controlled. When the time comes, you will definitely be separated and end up clashing with experts from other races. A chaotic battle is unavoidable,” warned Xia Guhong.

Long Chen nodded. That was something to be wary of. He wasn’t worried about the others, but the Dragonblood warriors had to be careful.

“The three thousand worlds are different from the minor worlds that you’ve entered before. You are entering a major world with laws that are almost the same as that of our nine heavens and ten lands. However, the three thousand worlds are usually sealed, resulting in it using up very little of its core energy. There is primal chaos qi from the very birth of that world inside. That is why it is the best place for breaking through to the Immortal King realm. You’re lucky to be born for its opening, so cherish it properly. Furthermore, just like the nine heavens and ten lands, there is the human race inside as well as the devil race, Netherworld race, Blood race, demon race, spirit race, beast race, and others. There are unending battles inside. Once you enter, don’t end up in the territories of other races. If you end up there by yourself, your only option will be to slaughter your way out,” implored Xia Guhong.

“My luck is good. I’m just worried about boss!” laughed Guo Ran.

“Even if my luck isn’t good, I can kill my way out. Furthermore, I have the blessing of the Spirit Butterfly race. My luck definitely won’t be bad. Just listen to big brother Guhong. Don’t be careless. This time, a battle inside the three thousand worlds is unavoidable,” said Long Chen.

Other than the Spirit race, Long Chen had almost no friends amongst the people entering. If he wanted to obtain more goods from the three thousand worlds, he would need to rely on his fists.

“Other than that, let me warn you that other races are very dangerous in the three thousand worlds, but the most dangerous ones are still those from the same race,” warned Xia Guhong gravely.

Long Chen understood this, so he smiled bitterly. The human race truly was ironic. The only ones who liked to kill each other like this was probably the human race.

Suddenly, the heavenly gate hanging far above them opened. There was mist on the other side, so no one could see clearly what the situation was. But as it opened, the world on the other side gradually grew clear.

Through the gate, people saw an endless world with mountains and plains. After that, they caught a glimpse of seas, lakes, and rivers. They even saw worlds of ice, as well as mountains of fire.

This world was absolutely enormous. This huge gate that filled the sky was only a tiny mirror allowing them to see the tiniest fraction of it.

Suddenly, people sensed a pure aura coming from the other side. All their pores automatically opened and greedily sucked in this aura.

This aura poured through their bodies, cleansing their flesh and bones. It was like a person that had been constantly drinking muddy water was suddenly drinking clean water. They felt purified.

Everyone was moved. At this moment, countless experts sighed over not being born at the right time for this event. They had passed the Divine Lord realm and were not qualified to enter the three thousand worlds. Hence, they could only get a few breaths of this air.

As for the Divine Lords, sensing the aura of the three thousand worlds, they were all incredibly excited. This was the world that they were about to enter. This was the place that would change their fates.

Suddenly, the three thousand worlds quivered. At some unknown point, a giant lotus had appeared, and it seemed to cover the entire three thousand worlds.

The lotus was simply enormous. Through the gate, they could only see a portion of it. It was slowly revolving and the grand primal chaos qi came out of it.

However, these experts could only sense that primal chaos qi and not absorb it. Countless people’s hearts became itchy.

“The Grand Dao Flower. The legendary Grand Dao Flower has appeared!” exclaimed an elder.

“The Grand Dao Flower has three thousand petals corresponding to the three thousand Major Daos. Look at how many layers of petals it has. It must be it!”

“The gate is too small! We can’t see the whole picture. It is said that those that can see the full shape of the Grand Dao Flower can comprehend the secret workings of the universe, the principles of the ten thousand Daos!”

Even Divine Venerates were moved. They couldn’t help staring at it, hoping to learn some secret from it.

Regretfully, while one petal after another roved past their gaze, let alone the entire Grand Dao Flower, they couldn’t even see a single petal in its entirety.

Suddenly, the Grand Dao Flower’s petals emitted light that flew out of the gate and illuminated this world. It enveloped everyone.

Following that, one spot after another appeared on the Grand Dao Flower. When one looked at those spots very closely, they seemed to be names.

“It’s doing a roll call?”

Long Chen looked and found his own name on the Grand Dao Flower.

However, while he saw his name, he was unable to see other people’s names. When he tried, he only saw spots, and that disappointed him. He was hoping to see Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others’ names. But he couldn’t. After the Grand Dao Flower revolved a bit more, he couldn’t even see his own name.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Countless heavenly geniuses cried out excitedly when they saw their names appear on the Grand Dao Flower. Every single Divine Lord present had their name appear on it.

The Grand Dao Flower revolved and Long Chen continued to stare as more names appeared on it. For every name, a ray of divine light would shine on the Grand Dao Flower.

Long Chen saw only ten petals, but that was enough for every Divine Lord present to have their name branded on it. No further rays of light appeared.

Long Chen’s heart shook and Xia Chen also took note of this detail. His voice shook as he asked, “Just how many people are entering the three thousand worlds?”

They noticed that the other petals were also scribed with countless names. If there really were three thousand petals, then the Violet Flame Heaven Capital was only taking up ten petals, which was one in three hundred.

According to that, wouldn’t there be three hundred entrances with just as many people as there were in the Violet Flame Heaven Capital? Everyone who thought about this point was shocked. They finally understood just how big this world was.

“This is good. We’ll definitely see more old friends like this. Our Dragonblood Legion will slaughter our enemies inside,” said Long Chen, smiling slightly.

Originally, he was a bit worried about the others when he didn’t see them here. He didn’t want them to miss this opportunity. However, it seemed that this worry was for naught. Even that troublemaker Mo Nian hadn’t appeared here, but he was definitely at another entrance.

If there were that many entrances, then there would definitely be countless elites. Long Chen believed that the Dragonblood Legion would once more unite.

Suddenly, the Grand Dao Flower quivered. Rays of light shot out of it and illuminated the crowd. Every person was struck by the light corresponding to their own name.

“It’s starting! Prepare for battle!” Guo Ran immediately summoned his battle armor and entered his combat state.
