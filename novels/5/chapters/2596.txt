Chapter 2585 Dragon Battle Armor

BOOM!

The arrow exploded, unleashing a wave of flames that blasted away the hand. After that, a figure was revealed behind the hand.

When that figure appeared, startled cries rang out from some of the senior experts of the Martial Heaven Continent. They recognized him as the guy that Long Chen had previously defeated.

Last time, he had almost been killed by Long Chen. He had slinked away with heavy wounds. But now, his aura was even stronger.

“The contemptible human race actually launches sneak attacks?” The Sovereign sprout-level expert snorted, and a spear appeared in his hand. It struck toward Ling Weifeng like a viper in the night.

Even upon facing someone this strong, Ling Weifeng’s expression didn’t twitch. His manifestation rumbled, and his sword slashed through the air.

Space quivered as the two divine items met. The power caused waves to ripple out of the void.

Ling Weifeng was unable to keep hold of his sword, and it went flying along with him.

“What? He actually blocked the attack of a Sovereign sprout-level expert?!” The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were stunned. Although Ling Weifeng was injured, his opponent was an expert on the level of a Sovereign sprout.

The Sovereign sprout of the Blood race furrowed his brow. He had thought that he would easily wipe out Ling Weifeng with this attack, but he hadn’t expected Ling Weifeng to be so powerful.

Even the bloodline pressure of a Sovereign sprout was unable to suppress Ling Weifeng’s bloodline power.

“Die!” The Sovereign sprout appeared in front of Ling Weifeng, practically teleporting. His spear stabbed toward his head.

Even in his weakened state, even with death at hand, Ling Weifeng didn’t show any fear. He raised his right hand, and light condensed in his palm.

“There’s no need for that. This trash isn’t worth you sacrificing your life.” Guo Ran’s lazy voice rang out.

Just when that spear was no further than three inches from Ling Weifeng’s hand, a blood-colored hand caught it. The spear could not go forward the slightest bit in its hold.

At this moment, the world turned silent. Guo Ran was standing in front of Ling Weifeng, his right hand holding the spear.

Armor slowly appeared around Guo Ran’s right arm. The rest of him was still in normal battle robes.

Wind whistled. Even without summoning his manifestation or the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, Guo Ran had easily caught the Blood race’s Sovereign sprout’s attack.

The Sovereign sprout was stunned. His arms trembled as he tried to pull his spear, but he was unable to budge it. It was like his spear was now linked to Guo Ran’s arm.

Runes revolved around Guo Ran’s arm. At this moment, the Sovereign sprout felt like all the force he was sending into the spear was falling into a boundless sea. It vanished without a trace.

“Brother, you can go back. You’ve shown off enough, so leave things here to me.” Guo Ran smiled at Ling Weifeng.

Ling Weifeng nodded and retreated, leaving only Guo Ran and the Sovereign sprout on the battlefield. The atmosphere instantly tensed.

“Guo Ran’s power has grown, so his showing-off skills have also grown with it. He has managed to almost replicate boss’s air,” said Gu Yang.

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan nodded. The current Guo Ran was probably the one with the greatest killing power in the Dragonblood Legion other than Long Chen. Even Yue Zifeng could no longer match him. This time, Long Chen had managed to drag out his potential.

Right now, the Sovereign sprout refused to let go of the spear as that would be admitting defeat. But suddenly, Guo Ran let go. As a result, the Sovereign sprout shot back violently, not having expected such a thing. He tumbled back, raising a line of dust.

To outsiders, it looked as if Guo Ran had silently sent him flying without moving. That stunned everyone.

After a moment of shock, the Martial Heaven Continent’s side cheered. Even a Sovereign sprout had been sent flying by Guo Ran. Now they were truly stunned by the Dragonblood Legion’s power.

“Who are you?! Report your name!” demanded the Sovereign sprout. Such a terrifying opponent had to be famous on the Martial Heaven Continent.

He was still not over his defeat to Long Chen. Hence, after recuperating, he had come back to have his vengeance against Long Chen.

He still refused to accept his defeat. Last time, he hadn’t had a chance to unleash many of his divine abilities.

Originally, he had thought that Long Chen had to be the strongest expert of the Martial Heaven Continent’s rising generation. But now he found that another terrifying fellow had appeared.

As soon as his opponent asked for his name, Guo Ran puffed out his chest and clasped his hands behind him. He then looked into the sky, looking lonely and aloof. Seeing his expression, Gu Yang and the others covered their faces. This again…

As expected, Guo Ran loudly chanted, “I swept through the four seas and crossed a thousand mountains, causing huge billows in heaven and earth. I slaughtered demons, eliminated devils, plucked the stars and the moon. The protector of all races is me-Guo-Ran!”

Guo Ran added extra emphasis to the final three words, spitting them out with his powerful spiritual yuan and dragon might. His voice resounded through heaven and earth like raging waves.

Gu Yang: “How embarrassing.”

Li Qi: “I’m getting goosebumps.”

Song Mingyuan: “Although he often changes his last phrase, he’s never made it not embarrassing. To tell the truth, I kind of want to go back now.”

“Absolutely shameless,” said the three of them together.

Now they understood why Yue Zifeng had awkwardly declined to join them on this incursion when they were gathering.

Yue Zifeng definitely didn’t want to endure this kind of embarrassment, so he had tactfully declined. It seemed that Yue Zifeng was the smartest among them.

While Gu Yang and the others were embarrassed, the rest of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts grew even more impassioned, their cheers growing louder. The young men and women in particular were shouting to the point that their voices were hoarse, but they didn’t care.

“What kind of dogshit introduction was that? A surname of Me? I’ll show you the terror of the Blood race!” The Sovereign sprout was infuriated by Guo Ran’s particular way of acting badass. His spear’s runes slowly lit up, and his aura climbed crazily.

“Surnamed Me?” Guo Ran was confused at first, but then he cursed, “You idiot, do the Blood race’s people not read books? I’m surnamed Guo, not Me! I’m your daddy Guo, Guo Ran!”

The mighty, domineering atmosphere that Guo Ran had created for himself was instantly shattered. Gu Yang and the others bitterly smiled. In the end, if he was just acting, he couldn’t keep it up for long.

The Dragonblood warriors heartlessly laughed at him. Had the Sovereign sprout been intentionally trying to infuriate Guo Ran? He could not have done better.

“Who cares who you are? Last time, I was careless to lose to one of you humans. This time, I’ll kill you before moving on to that Long Chen,” said the Sovereign sprout coldly. His aura continued to climb, seeming like it had no limit.

“Idiot, Long Chen is our boss. He wasn’t even fighting you seriously last time, or a single fart would have blown you to pieces,” said Guo Ran disdainfully.

“So you’re comrades! Good, very good! Then I’ll get some interest before killing him!” The Sovereign sprout’s fury soared. His Blood Qi exploded out of him like flames, igniting the void. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Big words. Your Blood race should change your name to the Bragging race. You just keep bragging. My boss only let you escape with your pitiful life due to a moment of carelessness. Once I kill you here, you won’t have another chance to challenge my boss.” Guo Ran snorted. His armor spread to cover his entire body.

Guo Ran’s voice rang out from within the armor, and it changed, becoming metallic. It was icy and domineering. He seemed to become a machine built for slaughter. “Tremble in fear as you wait for death. I’ll use absolute power to show you that your so-called power is nothing more than a joke before me.”

Guo Ran’s armor had changed a lot from before. Now, his helmet had two wings that were inspired by Wilde’s horns.

There was multi-colored immortal metal on his shoulders, elbows, and knee joints. Immortal qi could be seen inside of the metal along with some vague dragon-shaped runes within the mist. Due to it, the metal gave off a divine glow.

Startled cries rang out when the Martial Heaven Continents’ experts saw the new armor. Guo Ran’s wares were constantly improving. His battle armor was now one layer smaller, no longer looking so clumsy. It also gained a new grace and elegance to it.

The armor shone with divine light once it was fully summoned. It was like the rising sun, emitting a dazzling light. This was the first time anyone had seen such beautiful and formidable battle armor.

“Only useless beings rely on external power. In front of me, this armor of yours is nothing more than a flimsy decoration.” The Sovereign sprout sneered. He had finally finished accumulating power. As a result, the heavens twisted as if they were boiling. “I’ll finish you in one move!”

The Sovereign sprout charged at Guo Ran like a meteor. His spear was stabbing toward Guo Ran with all the power that he had accumulated.

“It just so happens that I also want to test just how strong my new dragon battle armor is,” said Guo Ran casually.

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Guo Ran simply stood there, allowing the spear to stab into his chest.
