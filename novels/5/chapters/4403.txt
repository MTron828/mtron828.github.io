Chapter 4392 Feather Race

“What are you doing?! Release me!”

The spherical lifeform screamed in terror as it was stamped into the ground by Long Chen. Its form was deforming as if it would explode at any moment.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“A little Heaven Venerate dares to act arrogant in front of Boss Long San? Who gave you that courage?”

Long Chen continued to press it down with his foot. While the spherical lifeform had a higher cultivation base, it was unable to unleash any of its power in front of Long Chen’s absolute strength.

“Stop, stop! Boss Long San, I submit! Spare me! You’re my daddy, okay? Stop, stop! I’m going to explode!” begged that lifeform.

“You scared my little sister. Apologize to her,” said Long Chen coldly.

“Little sister, I’m sorry, it was my bad for scaring you! I didn’t know any better! I should die for my sins! I apologize! Please spare me!”

It had never dreamed that some little fellow in the first Heavenstage of the World King realm would have such a terrifying power. It had no ability to resist.

Had it known of this beforehand, it wouldn’t have dared to provoke them even if it was beaten to death. But now, its life was in Long Chen’s hands, and no one could save it.

Worst of all, it was alone and didn’t have anyone from its race by it. It couldn’t plead for aid at all.

“I don’t accept your apology! I thought you were cute, but you’re actually so terrible! And you also insulted my big brother! I don’t accept it!” Little Crane, still seething with anger, refused to back down.

She wasn’t provoked when she was cursed, but the moment it insulted Long Chen, her rage flared up. Despite not being a part of the human race herself, this insult toward Long Chen was something she couldn't tolerate.

“My two ancestors, I was wrong. My eyes were blind, and I shouldn’t have offended you. Please don’t kill me. I’ll do whatever you want!” the spherical lifeform begged.

It was really afraid as Long Chen’s power exceeded its understanding. It had thought of countless ways to counterattack, but it knew that none had the slightest chance of success.

“I’ll give you a chance. If you can make my little sister happy, I’ll spare your life. If you can’t, you can just reincarnate.” Long Chen raised his foot.

The lifeform was overjoyed and was about to run when it shrieked.

“Idiot. You want to run? Think about that one more time and you can run to the afterlife!” sneered Long Chen.

This spherical lifeform recoiled in horror as it discovered that Long Chen had somehow placed a spiritual seal on it. Every thought it harbored was laid bare, and with just a thought, Long Chen could end its life.

Facing such a predicament, it instantly became obedient. It then rolled in front of Little Crane, putting on a show for her.

In the end, Little Crane hadn’t seen the world, so after just a few moves, she was laughing. Seeing this, the spherical lifeform sighed with relief and worked harder to please her.

As she laughed, the spherical lifeform lifted Little Crane into the air and started to roll around with her on top. It was extremely fast but stable.

Little Crane cried out in delight. The lifeform then rolled around with Little Crane for a long time before coming back, pitifully looking at Long Chen. Its unspoken meaning was clear: “Are you satisfied?”

“Alright, you’ve kept your life. Accompany my little sister for a few more days, and you can go,” said Long Chen, intuitively grasping the creature's intent.

“Many thanks, many thanks!” The spherical lifeform repeatedly thanked him for sparing its life.

“Big Brother Long Chen, why don’t you let it off now? I’m not that angry,” said Little Crane, feeling compassionate. Having been amused, she seemed to have overlooked its sinister side.

“Many thanks, many thanks! Truly thank you…!” The spherical lifeform immediately thanked Little Crane.

“Oh?” Long Chen looked at it profoundly.

That lifeform instantly shivered, but it reacted quite quickly. “Many thanks, many thanks, but being able to accompany you is my life’s honor, my blessing, my life’s mission! If you don’t dislike me, please let me stay with you for a bit longer! It would hurt me if we were to part so quickly…”

“Alright, that’s enough.” Long Chen interrupted its begging. Just listening to it gave him goosebumps.

Its low-level fawning would only be able to trick a pure-hearted lifeform like Little Crane. Little Crane actually took it seriously and happily accepted its “wish”. Following that, the spherical lifeform brought her rolling around.

Long Chen watched as Little Crane laughed happily, and he was happy to see it. The closer they got to the city, the more strange lifeforms they saw. However, they hardly found any humans.

This city had essentially become the land of these lifeforms, and any humans that Long Chen saw were very subservient toward these lifeforms. Some people would greet Long Chen warmly only to be mercilessly mocked by these lifeforms.

However, those people didn’t mind and continued to call out to him. They were either selling wares specific to the human race or asking other humans to take them along. Some people were even shamelessly begging, and they would be beaten if they got too annoying.

Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head as he saw these scenes play out. Although this city couldn’t count as flourishing before, it still bordered the High Firmament Academy and could be considered a middle-tier ancient city. Hence, its history was quite deep.

In his prior visits, Long Chen found this city bustling with activity, teeming with life. All kinds of wares could be found in the marketplace, and the city witnessed a continuous flow of experts coming and going.

However, the city was now occupied by these foreign races, as if its master had changed. A feeling of loss then washed over Long Chen. This place felt foreign, and it was as if the world was changing rapidly around him.

Little Crane was originally laughing and smiling, but when she saw the change in Long Chen’s emotions, her smile vanished. She pulled his hand and softly asked, “Big Brother Long Chen, what is it? Are you not happy?”

“It’s just that I haven’t come out in a long time. I’m not used to it.” Long Chen shook his head and took a deep breath, pushing away his complicated emotions. He then brought Little Crane into the center of the city.

Reaching the main street, they saw more humans in stores along the street. The persistent hustle and bustle of people peddling their wares filled the air with a continuous hum.

There were many experts of the other worlds here as well, seeming very interested in the human race’s wares. This place was bustling. Little Crane had never seen many of these things before, so she pulled Long Chen over to take a look.

The moment that they entered the first store, a strong gust blew over them, accompanied by an enraged roar from within.

“Damn humans! How dare you insult my esteemed Feather race?!”

Following that, a figure flew out, smashing straight toward Long Chen and Little Crane, making her cry out in fright.
