Chapter 3879 The Situation Turns Critical

Ninety-nine talismans transformed into a flame lotus, which then erupted amongst the incoming experts, unleashing a ferocious wave of flame that devoured them whole.

Even as these experts went all-out, some were still torn asunder by the explosive flame. The majority, however, succumbed to the overwhelming impact, coughing up blood as they were blown back.

“It’s too bad I’m not a flame cultivator. If I could use boss’s Nirvana Scripture, the flame lotus’s power would be a hundred times greater, enough to wipe them all out. Compared to boss’s move, this one is greatly lacking.” Xia Chen couldn’t help but sigh when he saw this result.

Empowered by the Heavenly Dao Crown and the support of the dragon blood, Xia Chen felt himself to be invincible. In his Dragon Blood Battle Armor state, he possessed the ability to directly inscribe runes onto his dragon scales, granting him the freedom to unleash a vast array of magical arts. As long as he could inscribe the runes, he could effortlessly unleash any talisman at his disposal. He was no longer constrained by the limitation of traditional paper talismans.

However, some things could only be replicated but not truly mastered. He could imitate Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus, but it was just the form, not the essence.

Without innate flames and the Nirvana Scripture, although Xia Chen’s talismans could draw out the flame energy of heaven and earth, the effect was much worse than the Nirvana Scripture. As a result, the eruption of the ninety-nine talismans wasn’t as good as he had expected.

With this attack, he understood his shortcomings. As a talisman cultivator, although the Heavenly Dao Crown and dragon blood power enhanced his combat versatility, his true essence still resided in the realm of talismans. They were the embodiment of his path, his Dao.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

Xia Chen had just unleashed the World Extermination Flame Lotus when Guo Ran’s saber descended with decisive precision. A giant saber-image then cleaved through the world, resembling a giant crescent moon cutting through the fabric of reality.

BOOM!

The devastating impact shattered over ten powerful lifeforms, reducing them into fragments along with their weapons. A mist of blood then spread, staining the air with a gruesome taint. On the other side of the battlefield, countless other experts were sent flying, hurtling through the battlefield in disarray.

“Those who aren’t afraid of death can come!”

Harnessing the might of his swinging saber, Guo Ran bellowed with an intimidating roar.

Unfortunately, there were thousands of them this time. Although the power of Guo Ran’s saber was shocking, it wasn’t enough to fully stop them.

The thing that troubled Guo Ran and Xia Chen the most was the incessant rumbling of the surrounding space, a sign that more and more experts were coming over. Like vultures drawn to the scent of decaying flesh, their numbers swelled with each passing moment, an unyielding tide of adversaries steadily closing in.

“Just two people think that they can stop us? What a joke! We’ll blast through them and take that dragon scale for ourselves! Time is of the essence; we must act quickly before the peak experts appear. Otherwise, we won’t have a chance. You all, boldness begets fortune. Whoever is the luckiest will get the biggest piece of meat!”

At this moment, a powerful demonic beast shouted and took the lead to charge over. He was extremely powerful. With a surge of unleashed Blood Qi, akin to a blazing fire, his wings spread as he tore through the sky with unmatched ferocity. The sheer force of his qi wave blew back the other experts around him.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Since you want to die first, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Guo Ran was enraged. As expected, the very concern that troubled them really happened before his eyes. With this one rallying shout, the other lifeforms came charging over, joining the fray. The golden dragon scale indeed possessed a fatal attraction to everyone.

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s saber slashed down with tremendous force, descending upon the mighty demonic beast’s own weapon. A heaven-shaking explosion then erupted between them.

As a result, that demonic beast coughed up blood, and cracks covered his body. A touch of fear appeared in his eyes after this blow. He finally experienced just how terrifying the current Guo Ran was.

On the other hand, Guo Ran was cursing inside. He realized that his inability to kill this demonic beast in one blow would only stoke the others further.

As expected, seeing that demonic beast survive fueled the confidence of countless others. After all, they had numbers. With newfound determination, they crashed down upon Guo Ran and Xia Chen.

“Courting death!”

In the face of overwhelming odds, Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s rage ignited like an inferno. They knew that there were too many enemies for them to stop all at once.

Nevertheless, the two of them began unleashing a torrent of attacks. Each of their attacks could kill dozens of these lifeforms, but they couldn’t hold them off forever.

As one expert was about to reach the dragon scale, a sudden quiver rippled through the void. In a split second, a barrier of light appeared, obstructing his way to the dragon scale.

He then struck the barrier, and without a single sound, was blown apart into a crimson mist. He ended up triggering the formation that Xia Chen had set up.

Even so, those experts refused to give up. They still took out their weapons and struck that barrier ferociously. As a result, violent power coursed through their weapons and into their bodies, blowing them up.

Only then did these lifeforms grow a bit more cool-headed despite the fatal attraction of the dragon scale. They no longer simply charged forward. As for Guo Ran and Xia Chen, they were slaughtering these lifeforms as fast as they could.

These lifeforms might be powerful, but they weren’t a match for the two of them in individual combat. Just like that, dozens of them were slain with every passing moment.

However, these lifeforms seemed to have gone insane. They were lunatics. Despite knowing the danger, they didn’t know the meaning of retreat. It was like they were afraid that they would lose any chance to obtain the dragon scale if they ran away. After all, experts were always crazy when presented with a chance to get even stronger.

“Don’t attack the formation directly. Use long-distance attacks to exhaust the formation’s power and then we can break through!” shouted a human expert.

“You traitor!”

Hearing this shout, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were both incensed. The two of them had pushed these experts to the limits of their courage, but someone just had to drive them even crazier. Moreover, as this person was from the same race as them, their fury was indescribable.

“Die!” Guo Ran furiously shot toward him like a shooting star.

“You want to kill me? Keep dreaming!”

That person sneered and took out a jade talisman, crushing it.

However, the moment he crushed it, his smile stiffened. To his dismay, his transportation talisman failed to activate. In that instant, translucent talismans manifested around him, forming a barrier that blocked any attempts at spatial transportation.

“Die!”

Xia Chen had ruined his talisman from a great distance. At this moment, Guo Ran’s saber fell, and that person screamed. But nothing he did could stop the scythe of the death god.

Alas, although he was dead, because of his reminder, countless lifeforms were now unleashing rays of divine light at the barrier.

Countless runes glowed on top of the quivering barrier, blocking these relentless attacks. However, those once-glowing runes were rapidly dimming. All the attacking experts had already condensed their Heavenly Dao Crowns. As a result, their formidable power was taking a toll on the formation, draining its energy reserves at an alarming rate.

Now, Guo Ran and Xia Chen began to panic as they couldn’t think of a way to kill all of them swiftly. Once they broke through the barrier, the consequences would be unimaginable.

BOOM!

Overwhelmed by the attacks of thousands of experts, the barrier exploded in a sudden burst, unleashing a surge of wild dragon qi. Upon sensing it, those experts descended into a frenzy and charged at Long Chen like hungry wolves, their rationality forsaken.

However, just as these wolves were about to touch the dragon scale, one figure after another descended from the heavens with remarkable speed. Like celestial beings, their weapons tore through the void, striking down these experts with unparalleled precision and efficiency.

“The Dragonblood Legion has arrived! If anyone seeks death, come forth and fulfill your desire!” The arrival of these formidable warriors was announced by a chorus of heroic and hot-blooded voices.
