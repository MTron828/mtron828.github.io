Chapter 1908 The Dragonblood Attack

Translator: BornToBe

Wild lightning poured out of the channel, turning the world into a sea of lightning.

All of a sudden, terrifying roars rang out as millions of lightning drakes flew out of the channel, running rampant and attacking the Life Star Empyreans as well as the rest of the coalition army.

Long Chen was immersed in the lightning. Lei Long continued to spin behind him. He was like a god of lightning.

These lightning drakes were the lifeforms of the Morning Dao Lightning Field. Long Chen had previously made an agreement with the master of the lightning field. As long as he needed it, the lightning field’s lifeforms would have to listen to him.

Long Chen was finally unleashing this trump card. The lightning drakes crazily attacked the coalition army.

“What are these things?!” The Life Star Empyreans roared. They were forced to defend against the lightning drakes’ furious attacks. Although the lightning drakes were temporarily unable to injure them, they did cause their bodies to go numb and slow their movements. The invasion of thunderforce was very uncomfortable.

When they attacked the lightning drakes, the lightning drakes would explode and then immediately reform to attack them once again. There was no end to them.

Suddenly, a pair of lightning wings appeared on Long Chen’s back. They were exceptionally bright and tore through the air.

“Die!” Long Chen suddenly flew forward.

“Attack together! This lightning sea will only disappear once Long Chen is dead!” shouted Huo Lieyun. He was the first to attack Long Chen.

As a result, Huo Lieyun was sent flying by Long Chen’s saber. At the same time, the huge lightning wings on Long Chen’s back slammed down.

Huo Lieyun coughed up a mouthful of blood. The flame giant he had summoned was cracked, almost shattering.

“The Sundering Lightning Heavenly Wings are as powerful as expected.” Long Chen was delighted. Perhaps this paragon art could only unleash its full potential in this lightning field.

Just at this moment, True Immortal Jiaoqi and Xie Luo came charging over. However, Long Chen’s wings shook, and he vanished. When he reappeared, he was already amongst the group of Life Star Empyreans.

Heavenly saber-images soared out of Evilmoon. At the same time, his lightning wings hacked up and down, forming a ring of death.

Those Life Star Empyreans were unable to receive a single blow from him. As a result, each of Long Chen’s attacks killed someone.

“Heavens, Long Chen is heaven-defying! Just how terrifying is this paragon art?!” The neutral camp’s experts were standing outside the sea of lightning. Their voices shuddered as they witnessed this terrifying sight of Long Chen slaughtering the Life Star Empyreans.

The lightning drakes, the Sundering Lightning Heavenly Wings, and Evilmoon were creating a song of death. That song sounded like exploding flesh, and it was hair-raising.

“Long Chen’s invincible! On his own, he’s actually able to stop this army. Even without the Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance, he’d be able to beat all these experts.”

Hu Feng, who was staring closely at the seemingly undefeatable Long Chen, shook his head. “No matter how strong a person is, they still have a limit. A powerful move comes with a large price. Long Chen might look invincible now, but it doesn’t mean he can stay in that state forever. He’s burning up energy as he fights, and he can’t last long. Furthermore, there are three thousand Life Star Empyreans. It’s difficult to say how long he’ll be able to hold out for.”

Long Chen was unleashing a barrage of attacks. Over a hundred Life Star Empyreans had been slain by him.

However, after all, they were Life Star Empyreans. Each of them was an amazing genius who had given up their future prospects for their current power. It was all to kill him.

Their power might not be a perfect match for Netherpassage experts, but they were only slightly weaker.

Long Chen’s power was truly shocking, but he was using up a huge amount of energy.

“Don’t be afraid. This is just his final burst of energy! Spread out and exhaust him!” shouted Huo Lieyun. He resummoned his flame giant and charged back into the battlefield.

“You’re right, I can’t last that long. At most, I can only keep it up to the sixth month of next year,” said Long Chen as he attacked. The Sundering Lightning Heavenly Wings weren’t just useful for killing, they were also a movement paragon art.

Within this lightning field, he could move freely. Those Life Star Empyreans listened to Huo Lieyun’s orders and spread out, as a result, killing them became much easier. He no longer needed to worry about being attacked by others when he struck, resulting in his efficiency going up.

“Gather together and protect each other!” Huo Lieyun suddenly noticed that spreading out was a mistake. They had to stick together to make Long Chen worried about facing counterattacks. There might even be a chance to injure him.

Those Life Star Empyreans hastily re-gathered. However, some of the more isolated ones were still picked off before they could gather.

After the experts gathered, they concentrated their attacks. As a result, Long Chen was forced to retreat. Seeing that, the Life Star Empyreans were delighted. They had finally found a way to counter Long Chen. This way, he wouldn’t be able to approach them, and they could exhaust him.

Long Chen tried charging over three times in a row, but before he could even launch an attack, they would launch a collective strike, forcing him away and making him cough up blood.

Long Chen had killed over three hundred Life Star Empyreans, but that was only a tenth of their numbers. Now that they were gathered together, even someone like Yan Nantian would have to treat them seriously.

“Kill him just like this!” shouted Huo Lieyun upon seeing that this was effective. Now that everyone was attacking together, if they could land a good blow, there might even be a chance of killing Long Chen.

“Hmph, I refuse to believe that someone can block me!” shouted Long Chen. He charged back at the army of Life Star Empyreans.

“Die!” The Life Star Empyreans were delighted. Raising their divine items, they activated their power. The energy of over two thousand experts was gathered. This power was enough to annihilate anyone, and Long Chen was no exception.

BOOM!

Their attacks gathered and blasted forth, and Long Chen was instantly devoured by that wave of divine power.

“It’s over!” The neutral camp’s experts sighed. No one would be able to survive such concentrated attacks.

Qi Xuan let out a wail, crying. She closed her eyes, not wanting to see Long Chen’s corpse.

Qi Fengxue also shut her eyes sadly. Long Chen was too arrogant to actually charge directly at so many terrifying experts. Amongst them had even been Xie Luo, True Immortal Jiaoqi, Huo Lieyun, and other peak experts.

However, at the next moment, space twisted, and Long Chen’s figure reappeared in another location.

“What?!”

Startled cries rang out. Long Chen had only been faking his attack. The instant that they had launched their collective attack, he had used the Sundering Lightning Heavenly Wings to dodge.

Long Chen had Evilmoon on his shoulder. He waved toward the Life Star Empyreans in goodbye with a sinister smile.

“Not good, we’ve been taken in!”

Huo Lieyun’s expression suddenly changed. He sensed mortal danger, and it was coming from behind them. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Suddenly, a roar rang out. The Dragonblood warriors shouted in unison, all their dragon scales shining brightly.

Guo Ran was standing at the front, and all the Dragonblood warriors’ energy was pouring into him. Guo Ran then crossed his sabers before him.

A giant cross-shaped beam of energy shot out. The center of the cross was those Life Star Empyreans who had gathered together for their own protection.

BOOM!

The giant cross beam slammed into them. They had just unleashed their strongest move and relaxed upon thinking that Long Chen was dead, not realizing that the real danger was behind them. As a result, flesh and blood flew.

This was an attack using all the Dragonblood Legion’s energy. Hence, it left a ripple of death as it passed through the air. The Life Star Empyreans struck at the core of the attack were instantly annihilated.

As for the rest, the ripple of death also blew them apart. Only those at the very edge managed to escape this tribulation. However, they were heavily injured. Some of them had even lost half their bodies.

After this one attack, the originally twenty-six hundred experts were cut down to just five hundred. Furthermore, half of them were heavily injured. Some people only had their heads left.

This attack was absolutely vicious. It had displayed unimaginable killing power when used against this concentrated group of unprepared experts.

The neutral camp’s experts were dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe their eyes. This shocking reversal was outside any of their expectations.

However, some had already realized that this had been planned by Long Chen.

At first, Long Chen had been slaughtering those Life Star Empyreans, and so Huo Lieyun gave the order to gather together. After that, Long Chen acted like gathering together put him in mortal danger, and so he baited them into attacking him, drawing their attention for the Dragonblood Legion to launch their sneak attack.

Using himself as bait, Long Chen had drawn all the attention of the Life Star Empyreans. As a result, right as they unleashed their all-out attack, the Dragonblood Legion suddenly scattered their defenses, instead launching a peerless attack. The cooperation between the two had been seamless. By the time Huo Lieyun reacted, it was already over.

“Kill!”

Just at this time, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Ye Lingshan, and the others charged toward the chaotic leftovers of the Life Star Empyreans.
