Chapter 3052 Someone From the Luo Family

The feather in Long Chen’s hand was an original true feather. It was the most precious feather of a rainbow crane, equivalent to a true dragon’s reverse scale.

The rainbow cranes were blessed by the Heavenly Daos, and Legend was that their feathers were auspicious signs. The rainbow crane race almost never interacted with the human race, so their original true feather was something that only existed in legends. Almost no one had ever seen it before.

Holding the original true feather and feeling the energy within it, Long Chen instantly realized that he could absorb its auspicious energy.

“If I use it, it will call down a blessing of the heavens. All ten thousand Daos will merge, and the world will be under my control.”

Long Chen muttered to himself. Just holding it, he could tell what kind of phenomena would occur when it was activated.

The Heavenly Daos were the most unfathomable existence in this world. But with this original true feather, by using the rainbow crane race’s auspicious blessing, he could achieve a level of complete control. Long Chen almost didn’t dare to believe that such a power existed.

“This gift from the rainbow crane race is too precious.” Long Chen looked in the direction that the crane girl had gone. She had actually sent him a life-protecting talisman.

Although he didn’t know the exact effect of this original true feather, he was certain that it possessed the power to shake heaven and earth.

He put away the original true feather solemnly. Just as he was leaving, he heard hurried footsteps rushing over. He turned to see Luo Bing and Luo Ning running over.

“Long Chen, our Luo family’s Protector Corps has sent a commander over!” reported Luo Bing.

Previously, Long Chen’s Spirit Awakening Pills had helped the two of them awaken their bloodline power. Hence, Luo Bing had sent word back to the family, and now the family finally managed to send people over. Working together with Long Chen was an extremely important matter to the Luo family. Now it was time to discuss it.

In the outer academy, Long Chen met this expert of the Luo family. He was a handsome man who looked to be in his thirties, and he stood as straight as a ramrod, like a javelin. His eyes were calm, but there was a light within them like a sheathed sword. Despite him not unleashing any aura, Long Chen felt immense pressure from him. He wore white robes, giving him a feeling of transcending the mortal world yet also a feeling of closeness. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You must be mister Long Chen. From the moment I set foot into the Martial Heaven Domain, I’ve heard of your name. Such a promising junior is truly rare.” This man was Luo Changwu. He praised Long Chen, his expression sincere. It was not just an elaborate praise for courtesy.

“Long Chen, let me introduce you. This is our Luo family’s Protector Corp’s commander and also our family head’s second son. He definitely has the authority to make decisions in the Luo family,” said Luo Bing.

Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. The family head’s second son? Then wasn’t this his mother’s big brother? His own uncle? No wonder he felt such a sense of closeness with just a look.

“Junior Long Chen greets senior.” Long Chen hastily greeted him according to the proper etiquette of a junior. Seeing him be so courteous, Luo Bing and Luo Ning were delighted. Considering Long Chen’s untamable character, he didn’t give anyone face. They had been worried about this matter collapsing due to this, so they were very grateful that Long Chen was so humble. They actually thought that Long Chen was giving them face by being so polite to him.

Luo Changwu immediately propped Long Chen up, smiling. “Junior brother, there’s no need to be so courteous. To be honest, my Luo family was rude to you this time. After receiving the news, we should have come sooner. After all, this matter relates to my Luo family’s fate. We don’t dare to tarry. However, there were two intense battles against the Chu family during this time. I could only rush over here after dealing with those trifles, wasting quite a bit of time. Actually, my big brother should have been the one to come this time, but he was injured during those battles, so I was sent instead. I hope you won’t blame us.”

“We’ve fought against the Chu family again?” asked Luo Bing in surprise.

Luo Changwu waved his hand. “Nothing more than some crooked dishonesty from the Chu family. We didn’t want you to be distracted by such a thing, so we didn’t inform you.”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning’s expressions changed somehow. Even the son of the family head had been injured, so that was definitely not a minor scuffle.

Seeing their expressions, Luo Changwu softly said, “You’re good children. You want to carry the burden of the family. But now isn’t that time yet. Now, you need to work hard on your cultivation and grow up quickly. Don’t worry, the family has my father and us holding it up. The family is still safe and steady. Just properly cultivate. As for Luo Qingyang, don’t blame yourselves. The Luo family has tens of millions of disciples. For one or two to get befuddled is natural. It has nothing to do with you two.”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning instantly thought of those disciples that had died because of Luo Qingyang, and lines of tears dripped down their faces. They had always felt a great deal of guilt over this matter.

“Alright, we can discuss this matter later. Won’t this junior brother laugh at us if we get so emotional? Let’s talk business.” After comforting them, Luo Changwu looked at Long Chen. “Junior brother, your Spirit Awakening Pills are very important to our Luo family. Our Luo family will work with you frankly. Just tell me what you want in exchange. As long as it is within our limits, the Luo family will not refuse.”

If this was a negotiation, then this would be sticking out his own neck to be slaughtered. But Luo Changwu was a very smart person and instantly saw through Long Chen’s general character. He had investigated what had happened in the Martial Heaven Prefecture since Long Chen’s arrival, and so he was confident enough to directly toss out the Luo family’s sincerity.

To put it frankly, it was an attitude of if you had to slaughter me, then slaughter me. I wouldn’t retaliate. The question was whether or not you would be embarrassed to do such a thing.

Long Chen looked at Luo Changwu, his uncle, and felt a mix of emotions. He didn’t know what to say. A price? What kind of price? Could they possibly pay the price that he wanted? If he wanted to know his mother’s whereabouts, would they tell him? The Luo family had tossed his mother to the land of bitter cold, leaving her life up to fate. He didn’t even know if he should hate them or not.

Luo Changwu was a bit curious about Long Chen’s complicated gaze. It seemed that there were many things hidden in his deep eyes. Luo Bing and Luo Ning both got nervous

“I’m not lacking anything right now, so I don’t know what to ask for. How about I give you the secret formula for the medicinal pill, and your Luo family will owe me a debt?” asked Long Chen after a long moment of thought.
