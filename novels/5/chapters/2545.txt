Chapter 2534 Resolving Hatred

BANG!

With every strike of the hammer, metallic fragments flew out. Those fragments varied from about the size of a thumb to a single grain of cereal.

“Is this really fun? How do you play?” Mo Nian took up the hammer and struck a few times. Zhao Ritian screamed with every strike, delighting Mo Nian. He started to smash more and more.

“Stop, stop, stop!” Suddenly, Guo Ran cried out. Mo Nian had struck too much. Fewer and fewer fragments were flying out, and the final two strikes didn’t even produce a sound from Zhao Ritian. “You can’t keep hitting, or he’ll die. Then my precious cornucopia will be gone.”

Guo Ran hastily put away the forging table. Sensing Zhao Ritian’s weak aura, he relaxed. “It’s a good thing this fellow’s quite tough. He won’t die so easily.”

“Nice job, Guo Ran. This forging table of yours actually has such a use?” Mo Nian looked at the forging table curiously.

Even Long Chen was quite surprised by this. Guo Ran explained, “This forging table actually has many runes that I haven’t managed to figure out. Xia Chen has helped me out quite a bit. Recently, I found a space within it for breaking down immortal metal. Most likely, it’s for the shattered remnants of divine items. But the runes are incomprehensible to me, so it’s not too useful. Currently, it can only break down already smelted divine items, and not break them down directly. It’s a laborious task to smelt down weapons, so I haven’t really used this space much. But as soon as I saw Zhao Ritian, I thought of throwing him inside, using him as a chicken to lay eggs. And the result, hahaha…” Guo Ran laughed, very pleased with himself. This grand aspiration of his had been achieved.

“But if he doesn’t have any more ores to absorb, won’t the eggs stop coming?” asked Gu Yang.

Guo Ran had exposed his plan to Zhao Ritian. If Zhao Ritian refused to absorb more immortal metal, wouldn’t it be useless?

Xia Chen shook his head. “With Zhao Ritian trapped inside, it’s not up to him. I managed to learn some more about the runes in that decomposition space. Some of them are gathering runes that I’ve seen before. My best hypothesis is that the forging table itself might be able to gather, refine, and smelt items all on its own. But the runes are too ancient for us to know how to activate them. Moreover, there are some parts of the forging table that seem incomplete. When Zhao Ritian tried to sneakily absorb the metals, I noticed that he could be controlled within the forging table. Let me show you something. Guo Ran, take out the immortal metal ores.”

Guo Ran summoned piles of ores. They were the most primitive ores that had yet to be refined in any way.

Xia Chen patted the forging table a few times. He then took out two palm-sized formation discs and placed them on top of the forging table. After that, one particular part of the forging table lit up, its runes activating.

Following that, the ores began to glow, and the light from the ores poured into the forging table. They were entering an iron bucket within the forging table.

In the end, those ores turned dim and shattered, falling apart like mud.

In just a few breaths, those piles of ore were completely absorbed and turned into trash.

“How strange. If Zhao Ritian has absorbed the ores, why hasn’t his aura changed?” said Gu Yang.

BANG!

Guo Ran smashed his hammer on the forging table, and Zhao Ritian’s scream immediately rang out. Everyone laughed.

“You wretches, you won’t have good deaths! Just wait, the Zhao family will not let you off! You’ll definitely…” Zhao Ritian cursed furiously. The sounds of his curses made everyone smile brighter.

They all felt admiration for Guo Ran. Every existence had its counter, and Zhao Ritian was perfectly countered by Guo Ran’s forging table.

“Boss, you can busy yourself. I have some work of my own to do. I’m going to turn all the ores I have into real metal. Then I’ll go out looking for metal for Zhao Ritian. My goal isn't big. I just want to extract all the Star Field Divine World’s immortal metal to create the best equipment for the Dragonblood warriors. That’s the only way to make it up to our fallen brothers,” said Guo Ran.

“That’s a good idea. I’m at ease with your display. But don’t just play around yourself. There are quite a few people who hate him outside. Let them vent and hear his screams as well,” said Long Chen.

“You little fuckers!!!”

Zhao Ritian heard it all and cursed. He, a Sovereign sprout of the divine families, was being treated as a tool for gathering metal and venting anger. He practically died from rage.

Zhao Ritian was once more answered by a flurry of hammer blows. Fragments of metal flew through the air.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen went to find a quiet place to purify their ores. With Zhao Ritian, those ores were quickly purified, and to an extremely high degree at that.

However, many people followed them, saying that they wanted to help, when in reality they wanted to get a few smacks in as well. Hearing Zhao Ritian’s screams, even Liu Zongying ran over.

Mo Nian was going to follow Liu Zongying when Long Chen grabbed him. “Can you grow up a bit? You’re going to fight with them over this chance?”

“Don’t I have nothing better to do? You already stole the spotlight and are now the god of the Luo Spirit race. I didn’t get anything.” Mo Nian shrugged with a strange flavor.

“That nonsense isn’t important. How were the losses of your Mo Gate?” asked Long Chen.

“We’re all archers, and we had your people’s protection. Some of us were injured, but there were no casualties,” said Mo Nian.

Mo Gate’s disciples specialized in long-range attacks, so the Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples had taken care to look after them, keeping them at the center so they could unleash their attacks to help areas that needed it the most.

“Brother Long.”

Just at this moment, Hu Feng walked over, apologetically saying, “I’m truly ashamed. My luck was terrible this time. The Heavenly Fate Die actually summoned a low-low grade beast. I wasn’t able to help at all.”

“What’s a low-low grade beast?” asked Long Chen and Mo Nian.

“Ah… it’s not worth explaining. I wasn’t able to help this time, but I won’t let that happen next time. Brother Long, I’m going to leave now. I’m going to see if I can test my luck elsewhere. When we return to the Martial Heaven Continent, I will definitely stand by your side,” said Hu Feng. He turned and left.

“He just has to act so mysteriously,” snorted Mo Nian.

“Eh, where’s Yun Tian?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“Curious. He didn’t even say goodbye. He’s another fellow who likes acting mysterious,” muttered Mo Nian.

“The Sovereigns are unsolved mysteries. As a Sovereign’s son, he definitely knows something. I’ve always felt that the Martial Heaven Continent is hiding many secrets, but no one dares to reveal them,” said Long Chen heavily.

Ever since stepping into the cultivation world, the feeling that the Martial Heaven Continent was filled with many secrets grew.

He had encountered people like the Wine God Palace’s High Priest, the Huayun Sect’s Ma Ruyun, the Divine Ice Palace’s Daoist Heavenly Feather. They all gave him an extremely mysterious feeling.

He was closest with the High Priest, but the High Priest did not reveal what he knew about many things.

In the Netherworld, Ming Cangyue had said that the Martial Heaven Continent was the core of a star-field. After a terrifying battle, it had fractured, leaving only the core. It could be said that the Martial Heaven Continent was just a broken piece of a whole.

However, the Martial Heaven Continent had gone through many battles throughout its history. Why were there no solid records of this past?

Had those records been lost in the flow of time, or had someone intentionally destroyed that history? Why was it that the people who knew of it refused to say anything? What was taboo?

The five Sovereigns were mysterious existences. People only knew their names, but concrete things about them and their accomplishments could not be verified.

As his cultivation base increased, Long Chen came into contact with more and more things. The waters of the Martial Heaven Continent were extremely deep.

It was precisely due to this that Long Chen had started to grow cautious. But this cautiousness made others think that he was a coward, resulting in some trying to take advantage of him.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Long Chen was filled with fury inside. He hadn’t wanted to stand out. He just wanted to secretly develop his and the Dragonblood Legion’s power, preserving his own trump cards for any future crisis.

However, there was always a group of people who refused to let him do as he pleased. They forced him to the brink until he had no choice but to strike back.

In this kind of situation, Long Chen’s full power had been exposed to everyone, while he knew nothing about other people’s hidden power. That was the most dangerous state to be in.

His trump cards were exposed, and others could easily counter them. This feeling was not a good one. But idiots like Zhao Ritian just had to provoke him.

If Long Chen took one step back, they advanced two steps on him. The rage had only accumulated this entire time.

What Long Chen needed was time, but his enemies wouldn’t give him that time. So what he needed was to find some way to quickly increase his power.

After chatting a bit with Mo Nian, the shameless Mo Nian said that he wanted to go see his wife. But Long Chen knew that this was an excuse to go see Guo Ran torment Zhao Ritian.

Mo Nian currently possessed the power of the Nethergod Hong Yaoyang’s mortal husk, but he didn’t truly inherit Hong Yaoyang’s power.

Instead, he was using Hong Yaoyang’s divine energy to nourish his own energy. His core energy was currently in a transformative state, and what he was using to fight was just Hong Yaoyang’s power.

Long Chen wanted to ask him what kind of situation he was in and how long it would take him to awaken his power, but that fellow refused to talk about it.

Mo Nian had just left when Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, Zi Yan, and the others walked over.
