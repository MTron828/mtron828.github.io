Chapter 3466 Chaotic Scene

It felt as if two suns were colliding. Blinding pain stabbed countless people’s eyes, and they instantly lost their vision. It felt like the world was being torn apart.

Following that, they felt like the space around them was twisting, as if their bodies and souls were twisting as well. Even the experts of the Battle God Palace coughed up blood.

As for those half-step World King sea demons and devils, they simply exploded and a bloody stench filled the air. When everyone’s vision was restored, it seemed as if the entire world had turned red. It was as if they had fallen into hell.

The terrain had completely changed. If it weren’t for the barrier still standing, they might not know where they were.

The academy's formations shuddered. Fortunately, they were far enough from Long Chen that the barrier held on. But many cracks that had just healed reopened again.

Everyone then looked at Long Chen. His black hair and robes fluttered around him, and his saber was once more pointed at the heavens. Although his face was a bit pale and his aura was not as steady as before, his gaze was electric. He was still overflowing with battle intent.

As for the Nine Underworld Luocha facing him, blood leaked out of the corner of her mouth. Also, the head covering veiling her face was destroyed, revealing her true appearance.

What no one had expected was that her veiled face was covered in countless spots. Some even seem connected like ferocious reptiles. Just that sight made people feel afraid.

However, her arm was covered in fresh blood. Long Chen’s saber had almost made her arm explode.

“I told you, who cares if you’re the Nine Underworld Luocha or the Ten Underworld Luocha? In front of me, you have no right to be arrogant,” sneered Long Chen.

Just then, another saber-image soared into the heavens and came slashing down. Even before it landed, a ferocious heaven-splitting will caused the ten thousand Daos to wail.

“What?!”

The Nine Underworld Luocha was shocked. She had assumed that Long Chen’s flipping Blood Qi from that exchange had yet to recover. That should be the case according to reason. How was he able to unleash such a terrifying attack again in such a short time?

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t give her time to consider this question. The heaven-soaring saber-image came crashing down mercilessly, so the Nine Underworld Luocha spat a mouthful of blood on her dagger. The next moment, the Luocha image behind her that was originally starting to dim grew condensed again. With an explosive sound, the ground beneath her feet crumbled.

The Nine Underworld Luocha was smashed into the earth by Long Chen’s attack. Before, the two of them had been even, but this time she was unable to stop Long Chen’s power. She had no choice but to fall back, borrowing a bit of Long Chen’s force to retreat.

A bottomless abyss had appeared in the ground from Long Chen’s saber. However, the Nine Underworld Luocha had vanished. Long Chen was about to chase after her with the Minghong Saber when the void once more rumbled.

That huge spatial channel above the academy had finally finished condensing, so the aura of the Netherworld came gushing out. Following that, a tide of Netherworld experts flew out.

At the head of this group were five World Kings. Seeing this scene, Long Chen’s heart plummeted. He was incensed. He had once more fallen for Enpuda’s scheme. Compared to this old fellow, he really was lacking some maturity.

Enpuda’s schemes came one after another in an endless tide. They didn’t give Long Chen any breathing room. This time, there really was nothing he could do.

“Long Chen, I’ll now give you your last chance. Join Divine Venerate Brahma, and I can spare all your lives. All I will do is destroy the seventh branch academy. Otherwise, you will only be able to watch as all your academy’s people are killed here!” announced Enpuda.

He could see further than Liao Bencang, and he saw that Long Chen’s talent was amazing. At such a young age Long Chen already had such power, a power that was greater than the Nine Underworld Luocha. His potential was limitless.

If Enpuda could have Long Chen join Lord Brahma, then his mistake this time would be completely forgiven. In fact, Lord Brahma would probably be delighted.

“Nine Underworld Luocha, where are you?! Hurry up and kill Long Chen! I order you to use your trump card!” Liao Bencang ignored Enpuda and shouted.

“Long Chen?”

What no one had expected was that the newly descended army from the Netherworld didn’t immediately attack the academy. Instead, they heard Long Chen’s name and were surprised.

“Long Chen! Master Long Chen, is that you?” One of the World Kings looked at Long Chen in disbelief.

“You’re…! Damn, it really is you!”

When Long Chen looked closely, he finally recognized this World King. The latter had helped Long Chen row the boat across the black sea when they had gone to Wu Tian’s city.

However, he wasn’t one of Wu Tian’s important generals, so Long Chen hadn’t paid him much attention. Fortunately, his memory was decent, or things would be awkward now.

“Hahaha, what a coincidence! I didn’t expect to encounter you here again!” That World King was delighted and shouted.

Hearing that this World King actually recognized Long Chen and even called him master with such a reverent tone, Enpuda and Liao Bencang were dumbfounded.

Let alone them, even everyone in the academy was dumbfounded. Long Chen knew World Kings from the Netherworld? That was unimaginable.

Just then, the earth erupted and the Nine Underworld Luocha came flying out. After that brief delay, her aura seemed to have recovered, and her attack was once more incredibly sharp.

Hence, Long Chen’s saber slashed down again, and the Nine Underworld Luocha was sent staggering several steps back.

“Master Long Chen, what is going on? Do you need us to do anything?” After his excitement, that World King realized that Long Chen was in battle.

“Then I won’t stand on courtesy! Help me lock down this area! Kill all the fellows other than the human race. Other than that, there’s a damn fatty and a damn skinny there, as well as that dog thing and this spotted woman. They are all enemies! Don’t let them flee!” Afraid that this World King wouldn’t be able to differentiate between friend and foe, Long Chen specially pointed out Enpuda, Liao Bencang, Jia Luo, and the Nine Underworld Luocha.

“Alright! Master, don’t worry, we’ll definitely handle this perfectly!”

That person didn’t hesitate. He directly gave orders, and this army of the Netherworld took out their weapons and collapsed on the sea demons, devils, and even the Devil Eye Water Lily race.

Enpuda roared with a mixture of shock and rage, “Bastards, what are you doing?! Aren’t you the Black Nether race?! You’re Divine Venerate’s subordinates-!”

BOOM!

His reply was a hammer that struck him like a shooting star. “What subordinates?! Kneel! Divine Venerate Brahma? All we care about is Master Wu Tian! The Black Nether race betrayed Master Wu Tian and was just destroyed by us. You are their friends? Then you are our enemies.”

The five World Kings pounced on Enpuda and Liao Bencang. The scene instantly became chaotic. Liao Bencang was dumbfounded, so he furiously cursed Enpuda.

“You damn fatty, tell me what’s going on?!”
