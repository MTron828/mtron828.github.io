Chapter 5031 Unrivaled Long Chen

When Long Chen’s hand grabbed the Lingfeng Sword, all the power in the Lingfeng Sword instantly erupted, causing the bricks beneath Long Chen’s feet to shatter and astral winds to explode in every direction, slicing through the air like blades.

This sight left everyone too stunned to make a sound. They stared at the figure standing like a boulder, the only movement coming from his black hair and robes as he held the blade with one hand. The mouths of the onlookers were open, but no sound emerged.

Even Jiang Wuwang’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. Long Chen had actually blocked the Lingfeng Sword barehanded.

The four clan leaders and the other heaven vein experts were equally shocked. They knew exactly how strong Ye Lingxiao was. Yet, even Ye Lingxiao in this state could not best Long Chen. Long Chen appeared completely at ease, effortlessly blocking Ye Lingxiao’s attack. It was unbelievable.

With great difficulty, people closed their mouths and gulped, unable to believe their eyes. How could Long Chen be this powerful?

“Is he a monster?”

Even through the barrier, they could sense Ye Lingxiao’s terrifying aura. They all felt they would be killed instantly if they were to fight him. In fact, his aura alone could crumble their wills. Yet, Ye Lingxiao’s first attack after using the Lingfeng Possession was easily blocked by Long Chen barehanded.

Even Zhao Qingtian was dumbfounded, and Ye Lingxiao’s pupils shrank. He was filled with disbelief.

“Is that it? Long Chen looked at Ye Lingxiao indifferently. “If your attacks are only at this level, I can at least block it eighty-seven times.”

Long Chen swung his hand, sending Ye Lingxiao flying along with his sword. However, Ye Lingxiao sliced the air several times to counteract Long Chen’s force, preventing himself from smashing into the barrier. 

The cross on Long Chen’s hand slowly faded, unnoticed by anyone but him. While Long Chen appeared calm on the surface, he was overjoyed inside. His mastery over God Slaying Cross had finally reached the point where he could use it at will.

Ye Lingxiao’s attack had been absolutely terrifying. Before mastering the God Slaying Cross, Long Chen would have been forced to block it with Evilmoon. After all, while his Dragon Blood Battle Armor was strong, it couldn’t withstand the concentrated power of the Lingfeng Sword.

However, the God Slaying Cross could. When Long Chen said he could block the Lingfeng Sword eighty-seven times, he wasn’t bragging. He could now unleash the God Slaying Cross at this level eighty-seven times in a row.

This was the least amount of power he could put into it, making it the weakest form of God Slaying Cross. Yet, it was still capable of blocking the Lingfeng Sword’s full power. Even Long Chen felt excited enough to dance; the God Slaying Cross was truly terrifying.

Long Chen blocked this attack as a test, and they were perfectly evenly matched. If the God Slaying Cross had been slightly stronger, the Lingfeng Sword would have been sent flying. If it had been weaker, Long Chen’s hand would have been injured.

The two forces canceled each other out perfectly. Long Chen easily caught the Lingfeng Sword, demonstrating that the two of them were relatively evenly matched.

Ye Lingxiao was shocked. He had thought this attack would be enough to kill Long Chen or at least leave him half-dead. But unexpectedly, Long Chen easily blocked it. This was even more humiliating than the previous slaps.

All the Ye clan disciples who had boasted earlier now felt a burning sensation on their faces.

Long Chen looked at the shocked Ye Lingxiao and said, “You wanted to use this move to beat Long Tianrui? You must be dreaming.”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“AHHH!” Ye Lingxiao went crazy. His sword danced, unleashing a tide of Sword Qi. With a furious roar, he charged at Long Chen, unleashing nineteen slashes at once.

Ye Lingxiao’s sharp Sword Qi sliced through this space, leaving the barrier riddled with sword marks. It was a horrifying sight.

Yet, despite his sword technique being fast and sharp, Ye Lingxiao couldn’t harm Long Chen. Long Chen lightly stepped around, moving like a phantom while dodging all the attacks.

As Long Chen dodged, he didn’t forget to mock his opponent. “That’s it? I thought you would get stronger after your ‘possession’. But it’s just a group of amateur sword cultivators directing a crazy idiot.” 

“The ten moves ended a long time ago! It’s my turn!” shouted Zhao Qingtian.

To the side, Zhao Qingtian suddenly charged over, but the red-eyed Ye Lingxiao ignored him, continuing to attack Long Chen.

“Bastard, his life is mine!” Zhao Qingtian roared. With a glaive in hand, he summoned dark gold mist around his Heavenly Fate Disk.

BOOM!

A sharp earthen spike then pierced out of the ground, separating Long Chen and Ye Lingxiao. At the same time, Zhao Qingtian swung his glaive toward Long Chen.

Dust and dirt whirled through the air. It was unclear when it happened, but all the bricks on the martial stage had vanished, replaced by a landscape of yellow earth.

“No wait, the martial stage has been switched out!”

“The martial stage has been switched into a heavy earth stage. As expected, they came prepared. Their mission is to kill Long Chen,” sneered Feng Fei frostily. Did they really think that this was enough to kill Long Chen?

BOOM! 

BOOM!

Ye Lingxiao was struck by the earth energy and knocked back. Meanwhile, a cross appeared on Long Chen’s palm again as he defended against Zhao Qingtian’s attack.

With an explosive sound, dust and dirt erupted as Long Chen was knocked back several steps. The God Slaying Cross was able to block Ye Lingxiao’s attack, but it couldn’t stop Zhao Qingtian’s strike completely.

The glaive in Zhao Qingtian’s hand was also a legacy divine weapon. With the support of this heavy earth terrain, it was even stronger than Ye Lingxiao’s Lingfeng Sword.

“That’s too unfair!”

“How shameless!”

Gui Jiu and Long Ziwei both broke into curses. It was a two-against-one, and they actually switched out the field to their advantage. Could they get even more shameless?

“Scram! Long Chen’s life is mine!” roared Ye Lingxiao, furious at being blocked by Zhao Qingtian.

In response, Zhao Qingtian refused. “You’ve gone past the ten moves we agreed on. Long Chen is mine.”

“Bullshit! I’ll kill him right now!”

“Scram!”

After bickering for a bit, Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian charged at Long Chen.

Long Chen calmly patted the dust off his clothes. Looking at Qin Feng outside the martial stage, Long Chen said, “You’ve all improved at such lightning speed. As your boss, I naturally can’t slack off. Today, I’ll show you my true power!”

“Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor!” Long Chen’s shout was like a heavenly god’s roar, shaking heaven and earth.

BOOM!

Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao barely reached Long Chen before it felt like they had collided with a star. The impact sent them tumbling backward, unable to withstand his immense power.
