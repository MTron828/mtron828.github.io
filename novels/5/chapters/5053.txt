Chapter 5042 The Curtain Drops

As Long Tianrui vanished, the eyes of the Long clan’s disciples grew dark and clouded. The recent events had shattered the glory of the Long clan, making it seem like a distant dream. The disciples felt abruptly awakened from their dream and confronted with harsh reality.

Long Chen also departed, leaving nothing but ruins behind. Thankfully, the Long clan still had their patriarch. Without him, the Heavenly Desolation Long clan would quickly fall prey to the surrounding major factions.

Though Long Tianrui maintained her usual expressionless demeanor as she left, everyone could sense her deep disdain for the Long clan. The elite competition had resulted in the deaths of two ancient peak heavenly geniuses and the majority of heaven vein experts from the four divine clans. Thinking of their losses, the disciples wished they could wake up from this nightmare.

“Let’s go,” Jiang Wuwang sighed helplessly.

The Jiang clan was both unfortunate and fortunate. At the very least, Jiang Wuwang was still alive. The thought of what could have happened filled him with fear.

There was something he had kept from Feng Fei the entire time: the Jiang clan leader had secretly approached him and hinted that he should enter the martial stage and join forces with Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian to kill Long Chen. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Thankfully, he had refused. One reason was because of Feng Fei’s warning, and the other was his own pride. If he wanted to kill someone, he would not use such a scheme, nor would he join forces with others.

This pride had ultimately saved his life and also planted a beautiful seed for the Jiang clan’s future. He and Feng Fei had risked their lives to save Long Chen, and Long Chen had clearly witnessed it. He would definitely remember that favor. All they wanted in return was for him not to seek revenge on the Jiang clan because of this matter.

However, it was different for the Long, Ye, and Zhao clans. Long Chen had already stated that he would personally take the head of the Long clan’s patriarch.

As for the Ye and Zhao clans, although Long Chen might not necessarily go to their territories for revenge, if the opportunity came, he would definitely not hesitate to eliminate any of their members.

In this context, the Jiang clan had suffered the least losses. This was thanks to Feng Fei’s warning and Jiang Wuwang’s wisdom.

Before Jiang Wuwang and Feng Fei led the Jiang clan’s disciples away, they didn’t forget to say farewell to the Heaven Overseer. In their eyes, the Heaven Overseer was truly wise. Unfortunately, wisdom without power was meaningless.

The Ye and Zhao clans had lost their leaders, and with the Long clan in disarray, there was no one to seek advice from.

Judging by the patriarch’s expression, it was clear his mind was blank. He couldn’t even take care of himself, let alone others.

As a result, the Ye and Zhao clans also bid farewell to the Heaven Overseer. As they left, they recalled how glorious and beautiful this land had been when they first arrived.

Now, all they saw was devastation. Long Chen’s attack had crippled the majority of the Heavenly Desolation Domain. The air was still filled with destructive energy that would take hundreds of years to dissipate.

In other words, within this timeframe, not a single blade of grass would be able to grow here. The laws of the world in this area had been wrecked.

Thinking of how Long Chen had a cultivation base identical to theirs but was able to slaughter the four divine clans’ strongest experts and destroy the foundation that the Long clan had built up for countless years, these disciples couldn’t help but be shaken.

At the same time, they felt a burst of fear. Many of them had once mocked and looked down on Long Chen. Reflecting on it now, they realized how foolish they had been. In terms of power, they weren’t even fit to carry Long Chen’s shoes.

When Feng Fei and Jiang Wuwang reached the border of the Heavenly Desolation Domain, they both looked back and sighed.

“You were right. In front of Long Chen, no one else can call themselves a genius. The difference is too great,” said Jiang Wuwang.

Feng Fei stared at Jiang Wuwang and noticed that he seemed to have suddenly aged a great deal. Much of the luster in his eyes was gone.

With a smile, Feng Fei replied, “In truth, every person is the main character of their own world. There’s no need to compete in everything and feel like you must win all the time. If you change your viewpoints, didn’t we win against Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian? In comparison to the other three clans, didn’t our Jiang clan win? As a spectator, we got to watch a battle of unprecedented brilliance, a spectacle that happens once in tens of thousands of years. Shouldn’t we feel blessed about that?”

Feng Fei greatly sympathized with Jiang Wuwang because she had felt the same way. She had also once tried to compete with Long Chen and had been extremely unwilling to be thrown behind.

However, she had come to comprehend another way of life. This new perspective felt full of sunshine. She didn’t complain or grumble; she didn’t get jealous or feel like she had lost. It was only with this new mindset that her cultivation base rapidly soared.

Jiang Wuwang was startled. He was a smart man, and with her pointers, he suddenly laughed. “You are absolutely right. I’m going to learn from you.”

“Hehe, if you wish, I can teach you how to be a spectator as well. However, I have to warn you, while you can worship Long Chen, you must maintain a boundary...” Feng Fei suddenly grew stern.

“What is it?” Jiang Wuwang was baffled.

Feng Fei suddenly gave him a teasing smile. “There are two points. One, Long Chen is the man that I like, so you can’t compete with me over him. Two, he doesn’t like men...”

“...”

Feng Fei laughed. Waving her hand, she led the Jiang clan’s experts away heroically. That appearance was as if they were heading home after a victory.

...

Space twisted, revealing Long Chen’s figure. The moment he appeared, he spat out blood, his face so pale as if all his blood had been sucked away.

“Is a three-vein Heaven Saint really this terrifying? Even you couldn’t block it?” asked Long Chen, shocked.

Earlier, the patriarch of the Long clan had slammed his palm against Long Chen. Although the Earth Cauldron blocked the attack, a trace of its power still entered his body.

Long Chen had been acting fine, but the moment he was out of sight, he couldn’t endure it any longer. Three explosive energies ran rampant through his body, threatening to blow it apart. His already badly wounded body could not endure it.

“It’s not that I couldn’t block it; I intentionally let a trace through. One reason is to show you the difference between a three-vein and a two-vein Heaven Saint. But the other reason is because your power has risen too quickly with the aid of the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool and the Jiuli Tower. Although they are both priceless treasures, such rapid advancement is not good for you. I have locked a portion of these three heaven veins’ purest energy inside you. Now, I will teach you how to circulate Earth energy. Using your own body as the furnace, refine their energy.”

Divine light fell from the Earth Cauldron, enveloping Long Chen.
