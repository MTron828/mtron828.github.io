The news of the Brahma secret realm rapidly spread thanks to Pill Valley’s efforts. Practically everyone knew of it, and countless experts began to look forward to its opening.

Originally, Long Chen’s tribulation and the ensuing battle that had resulted in the deaths of Ji Wuming and countless heavenly geniuses had greatly setback Pill Valley’s alliance. Their morale received a heavy blow. Yu Xiaoyun had even been told to scram by Long Chen, and he had listened.

Just as everyone thought that the Martial Heaven Alliance’s rise was set in stone, while Pill Valley and the others would be unable to do anything to them, the news of the Brahma secret realm caused the wind to change.

The title of a divine daughter shook people’s hearts. It was no wonder there hadn’t been any news of the Pill Fairy for so long. So she was receiving a god’s inheritance.

The Pill Fairy had originally been a peak heavenly genius blessed by the Heavenly Daos. If she had god power supporting her as well, using that god power to control the Brahma Divine Diagram and the Daynight Furnace, just who would be able to fight her?

People guessed that the reason Yu Xiaoyun had left under Long Chen’s threats was because he was leaving Long Chen to the Pill Fairy.

Regardless of the reason, the continent finally started to grow lively again. Pill Valley and the others no longer dared to cause trouble with the excuse of looking for Long Chen.

Even if Long Chen were to walk down the street, no one would dare to touch him. As for the so-called arrest warrants that had been put out for him? Those became an absolute joke.

The Clearwind City returned to its original state. Countless people were walking along the streets, and small businesses opened their doors once more. Things were no longer so tense.

Long Chen was strolling through the streets with Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Cloud, and Liu Ruyan. They were looking through the marketplace. Other than Liu Ruyan who was as icy as ever, the others were very excited. Cloud was especially excited, amazed by everything new to her. She held Tang Wan-er’s hand, asking questions left and right.

Meng Qi and Chu Yao were holding Long Chen’s arms, smiling. It seemed that they had forgotten the feeling of strolling through the streets ever since they had stepped into the cultivation world. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Chen felt ashamed at this. By following him, they had spent all their time in cultivation and fighting. They had given him their best years, and now just a simple stroll was enough to satisfy them. As a man, this made him feel vexed.

“As long as you’re by our side, it’s a blessing. As long as you’re well, it’s like spring,” said Meng Qi softly, seeming to read his thoughts.

“Good, there was no thunder at the end.” Long Chen couldn’t help chortling.

“What thunder?” asked Meng Qi.

When Long Chen told them what had happened to Mo Nian, they laughed. Tang Wan-er had to support herself or she would fall down laughing.

“Ah, let’s keep this matter to ourselves. If everyone learns of it, especially Guo Ran, Mo Nian will definitely bite me the next time we meet,” said Long Chen. Family shame shouldn’t be spread. Just having the family know of it was enough.

“Long Chen, look at Mo Nian. He knows how to write love letters to people. Why haven’t you made any moves in that regard? You’re even inferior to Mo Nian,” teased Tang Wan-er.

“Tch, love letters are so low grade, only used to trick children. I wouldn’t bother with writing down my love for you... I’d rather show it to you in person.” Long Chen glanced at Tang Wan-er’s curves.

That gaze of his immediately made Tang Wan-er redden. She wanted to run, but if she avoided it, it would be saying that this was a weak point. She stood up straight and righteously said, “Pervert.”

Meng Qi and Chu Yao also blushed. Cloud didn’t understand, while Liu Ruyan acted like she hadn’t heard anything.

Chu Yao, Meng Qi, and Tang Wan-er had long since given their hearts to Long Chen. However, due to various reasons, they hadn’t taken the final step.

They had sworn to wait until Ye Zhiqiu was with them once more. However, it seemed that reality had changed faster than that. More women had popped up by Long Chen’s side, so now they didn’t even know what to do. It wasn’t as if this was an easy topic to discuss.

There was still some time before Ye Zhiqiu finished receiving the Divine Ice Palace’s inheritance. However, once she was back, things would become awkward.

“Hey, don’t be so dirty-minded. I was just saying that after we finished strolling through the streets today, we can go see my parents and little sister,” said Long Chen.

“Long Chen...”

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er immediately became nervous, especially Meng Qi.

“Don’t worry, my parents are very nice. They won’t make things hard on you,” guaranteed Long Chen.

Despite his comforting words, the three of them couldn’t help being nervous. They weren’t even in the mood to keep strolling.

Just at this moment, a voice rang out from around the corner. “Guest, you are looking at my shop’s supreme treasure, a true and authentic Lightning Dragon Whip. Legend is that it was created by a lightning dragon’s bones. The price is 2185000 spirit crystals. But it just so happens that this is the five hundredth anniversary of my shop, so if you want it, I can deduct five thousand spirit crystals.”

Lightning Dragon Whip? Long Chen and the others were startled. The so-called lightning dragon was not a true dragon, it was actually a kind of snow lizard that lived in lands of bitter cold. Its spine was very tough and possessed powerful cold energy.

When it was fully matured, it was a tenth rank Magical Beast. Its spine could not only be refined into a weapon, but it could also be used as a precious medicinal ingredient.

Long Chen looked over, only to see one man in a store recommending a whip to another person. When he saw the whip, he couldn’t help shaking his head. How was that a Lightning Dragon Whip? It was clearly an ordinary lizard’s spine that had been embedded with ice crystals.

However, when he saw the person being conned, Long Chen laughed. It was actually Guo Ran.

“Guo Ran wouldn’t fall for this, right? It’s clearly fake,” whispered Meng Qi. As a Beast Tamer, she was clearer on that than anyone else.

“I doubt it. Otherwise, Guo Ran would be too stupid,” muttered Tang Wan-er.

Guo Ran had originally been strolling the streets with an unpleasant expression, then someone had suddenly come to sell him something. He took a look at the whip.

“2185000 spirit crystals reduced by five thousand spirit crystals? Do I look like someone lacking those five thousand spirit crystals?” said Guo Ran disdainfully.

Hearing that, the seller was delighted. “Ah, this little one misjudged you. It seems you’re definitely-”

“I’m lacking 2180000!”

After saying that, Guo Ran lowered his head and continued walking. He had also seen that it was a fake item. That seller was dumbfounded, while Meng Qi and the others laughed.

“Boss!”

It was only now that Guo Ran noticed Long Chen and the others. He walked over.

Long Chen and the others had changed their appearances to avoid causing a ruckus, but those familiar with him could recognize him based on his aura.

“What’s going on? Were you beaten? You don’t look good,” questioned Long Chen. Guo Ran’s appearance was very strange.

“I’ve been very unlucky these past two days. The day before yesterday, I ended up falling asleep and having a nightmare. I dreamt a bunch of people beat me, startling me awake. When I realized it was a dream, I went back to sleep, only to dream of those people again. They shouted at me, ‘You dare to come back?’ and then I woke up again,” sighed Guo Ran.

Meng Qi and the others laughed once more. Long Chen wasn’t too surprised. The Dragonblood warriors were all under immense pressure, and normally when they cultivated, there was no way for them to sleep. Only by drinking until they were drunk could they relax enough to dream.

Although Guo Ran was already very powerful, his inner heart was still weak and cowardly, which was why he had such a dream.

“That’s not all. I also ran into something vexing just now,” said Guo Ran.

“But you didn’t fall for the con?” asked Tang Wan-er.

“Not that, something before that. There’s a building, the Spirit Cleansing Medicinal Pools. They claim their baths can completely relax someone, so I went in...” said Guo Ran.

“What? Was the pool not clean?” asked Tang Wan-er.

“No... actually... let’s not talk about it,” sighed Guo Ran.

“Hurry up and tell us. It’s annoying when people only say things halfway!” raged Tang Wan-er.

“It’s embarrassing. When I went in and asked the price, they said that the man’s bath costs a hundred spirit crystals, while the woman’s bath costs ten thousand spirit crystals. I said that it was a robbery, but the host asked me whether I wanted to go to the man’s bath or the woman’s bath. After hesitating... since I’ve never been to a woman’s bath before, I... I... I went in to take a look, only to see a pool full of men. They cursed me, cursing me for being another man and making them even more crowded... I was actually conned.” Guo Ran covered his face pitifully.

Now even Long Chen laughed. “Fool, you even jumped into such a hole. How can I be at ease with you leading the Dragonblood Legion?”

“It’s not me being a fool, it’s that they’re too crafty! Tell me, what happened to people’s integrity and sincerity? Clearwind City is a con!” cried Guo Ran.

“You deserve it. Who asked you to be a pervert? Good thing you disguised yourself first, or it’d be embarrassing if others recognized you,” said Tang Wan-er without the slightest sympathy.

“For men, this is normal. Just don’t fall for it next time.” Long Chen magnanimously patted Guo Ran on the shoulder in a consoling manner.

“I’m planning on leaving for a few days. Be careful and supervise everyone’s cultivation. Don’t let this victory get to people’s heads. Our enemies retreated, but it’s not a true retreat. They have only taken a single step back to accumulate energy for the next strike. Once everyone’s had a chance to relax, make them focus again. Don’t let them get drunk on other people’s worship,” said Long Chen seriously.

Although the Dragonblood warriors were already incredibly strong, they were still young. Being surrounded by the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance and their worship, there was danger of them growing overconfident.

If that happened, it wouldn’t be long before the Dragonblood Legion fractured. So Guo Ran, Gu Yang, and the others had to occasionally give them a blow so they continued to work hard.

After giving instructions to Guo Ran, Long Chen led the women onto a transportation formation. They went straight for the Grand Xia Ancient Nation.
