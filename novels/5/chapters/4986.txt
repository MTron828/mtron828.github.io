Long Chen suppressed them with all his might, only to find they were completely out of control. They fought like madmen, completely ignoring Long Chen.

Only now did Long Chen realize just how much they had grown. They had absorbed too much of the divine pool’s power. The seven-color Supreme Blood in particular had reached the point where it could rival the dragon blood.

As they clashed, Long Chen’s meridians started to fracture. If he didn’t suppress them now, his meridians would disintegrate soon.

“Senior, what do I do?!” Long Chen could only ask the Earth Cauldron for aid.

“It’s fine,” responded the Earth Cauldron calmly before falling silent.

It’s fine? My meridians are about to explode, but it’s fine?Would things only be bad when I actually die?

Long Chen felt panic creep in. Meridians were crucial to cultivators; any damage to them would cripple most cultivators.

His dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood continued their fierce battle. Most terrifyingly, they persisted in absorbing the divine pool’s energy relentlessly. They seemed tireless, growing stronger and increasingly uncontrollable. Long Chen realized he couldn’t sever their connection to the divine pool; they were absorbing its energy autonomously.

Desperate, Long Chen tried to leap out of the divine pool to slow down their absorption. He hoped to buy himself some time.

To his surprise, he found that he couldn’t move. His dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood had gathered all their power together, and he had lost control over his body.

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” shouted Long Chen. In his entire lifetime, he had never encountered such a thing before. He was stunned.

“Senior, save me!” Long Chen shouted for aid again.

The Earth Cauldron replied, “You have to let them grow to the limit. Otherwise, there would be no point in entering the Jiuli Tower. Even if you do go, you’ll die inside.”

“Eh?” Long Chen was even baffled now.

“Don’t panic. Let them fight. Your meridians will be damaged, but the divine pool’s energy and your healing abilities will prevent them from exploding,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen quickly calmed himself down, focusing on using the primal chaos space’s energy and the divine pool’s energy to continuously repair his meridians.

Just as the Earth Cauldron said, as long as he focused on healing, the damage caused by his dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood could be healed immediately.

Although they would be damaged after healing, as long as he maintained this tempo, not letting the damage get too bad, it wasn’t a large problem.

Furthermore, through this repeated cycle, his meridians were strengthening. Despite their damaged appearance, the meridians could withstand the growing power of the dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood.

With his unruly seven-color Supreme Blood and dragon blood behaving like mischievous children, Long Chen patiently endured their antics. Time passed bit by bit, though he lost track of how much time had elapsed.

Suddenly, a powerful burst of energy erupted, sending Long Chen flying. He crashed into the stone steps, nearly losing consciousness.

Light-headed, he looked up to see Huo Linger and Lei Linger transformed into beautiful maidens. Behind each of them loomed a giant disk—one fiery and the other crackling with lightning.

“They’ve become Heavenly Chosens?”

Long Chen’s jaw dropped in joy. However, just then, the Earth Cauldron’s angry scolding snapped him back to reality.

“Fool, hurry up and heal your meridians, or they will be destroyed!”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen quickly checked his meridians, and his soul nearly fled in fright. In the blink of an eye, his meridians were riddled with tears, on the verge of bursting at any moment. Hastily, he started healing them.

For a while, Long Chen did his best to save his meridians. Finally, he returned to the previous deadlock, but now he was sweating.

During this moment, he spared a glance at Huo Linger and Lei Linger, only to discover they had returned to the primal chaos space. Floating mid-air, they sat with their Heavenly Fate Disks spinning behind them. They exuded a divine and sacred aura, akin to newly born goddesses of flame and lightning. Their auras had completely transformed, their strength leaving even Long Chen stunned.

“Let them get used to their new Doyen power. Once they are done, they will give you a pleasant surprise,” said the Earth Cauldron.

If even the Earth Cauldron described it as a pleasant surprise, then it would definitely be shocking. Long Chen was filled with anticipation.

Long Chen’s dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood continued their intense struggle. However, he noticed that the damage to his meridians was starting to lessen.

“Have they reached their peak?” Long Chen wondered aloud. Previously, their power had been constantly increasing, and along with it, the strength of his meridians. Now that the injuries were diminishing, did that mean their power had stopped rising?

“Yes, they have reached full saturation. Now, you should awaken your violet blood’s power to calm them down,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen slapped his leg in realization. He had actually forgotten about his violet blood. It possessed a miraculous, balancing power that had always kept his different bloods in check. With the Earth Cauldron’s reminder, he immediately attempted to harness his violet blood.

His violet blood was gentle as ever, not resisting despite its newfound strength.

However, when Long Chen used the violet blood to balance the other two, it didn’t have its usual magical effect. Previously, his violet blood had effortlessly mediated between them. Now, it seemed the spark of conflict had been ignited, and neither side was willing to yield. Although they did not reject the violet blood’s power, they refused to stop because of it.

The Earth Cauldron seemed to have anticipated this outcome. It advised, “Ignite your foundation to help your violet blood.”

“Did… did I mishear? You want my cultivation base to regress?!” Long Chen couldn’t believe his ears. It was already challenging enough for him to raise his realm. Regressing would make it a thousand times harder to climb back up.

“There’s no time to explain it all. Hurry up. Someone is coming!” urged the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen gritted his teeth. His violet blood suddenly ignited, and the violet flames enveloped his seven-color Supreme Blood and dragon blood. Long Chen’s aura rapidly fell. Just like that, the wall between his realms collapsed, and his cultivation base plummeted.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a muffled sound came from within Long Chen’s body. Long Chen felt a wave of weakness wash over him. He had actually fallen from the third Heavenstage to the initial Divine Venerate realm.

At this moment, his dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood finally calmed down.

All of a sudden, the stone gate opened, and a group of people walked in. When they saw the situation in the divine pool, their expressions all changed.

Long Yaoting furiously roared, “What the hell are you up to?!”
