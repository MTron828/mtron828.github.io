Chapter 3274 The Fisherman Profits

“Damn, those are Immortal King devil beasts!”

Those roars caused Qi Yu’s expression to change. It had to be known that they were barely on the edge of the Vile Dragon Domain, but there were already Immortal King devil beasts here? Then what about deeper?

The Vile Dragon Domain was an extremely dangerous land. The majority of it was occupied by various devil beasts, and the human race was at the bottom of the food chain here.

Only some special places here possessed auras that devil beasts disliked, allowing the human race to establish cities. Such places were paradise for adventurers.

This giant domain was filled with devil beast territories and very few people. That meant countless precious medicines and fruits were just waiting to be plucked.

Some people might be lucky to encounter some rare immortal grass and instantly soar.

Thus, the Vile Dragon Domain had countless adventurers gathered within it. However, countless people also died within the wilderness. This was a dangerous land filled with allure.

Right now, Long Chen and the others already heard roars right as they entered. They didn’t know if this was simply an intimidation tactic to dissuade them from entering.

“There are so many of us. We’re not afraid of Immortal King devil beasts, right? After all, boss even slew Jiang Baihe’s psychic beast,” said Bai Xiaole.

However, Long Chen shook his head. “You’re thinking too simply. Jiang Baihe’s psychic beast should be called the most foolish psychic beast at the Immortal King realm. Otherwise, with his Spiritual Strength, there would have been no way that he could control it. Although its Blood Qi was shocking, it didn’t possess any divine abilities. To put it frankly, it could only be used to scare others. If Jiang Baihe wasn’t controlling it, then any one of you could have easily slain it if you simply didn’t fight it directly. There are also differences amongst devil beasts and humans. For example, despite both being in the Four Peak realm, is your combat power on the same level as an ordinary disciple of the academy?”

“No…” Bai Xiaole was left at a loss for words. He truly had been thinking too simply. Just like amongst humans, there were differences between devil beasts. Despite being in the same realm, the difference between their combat powers could be as great as a heavenly chasm.

“However, Xiaole’s chance has come. If we can obtain a youngling of an Immortal King devil beast, Xiaole will have an Immortal King mount. Hehe, are you moved?” Qin Feng smiled.

Bai Xiaole’s eyes instantly lit up. Last time, he had wanted one of the six horn sea serpents as a mount, but Long Chen had killed them all. Now that they were in the Vile Dragon Domain, his chance had come. Qin Feng’s reminder made him feel anxious and start looking.

His Three Flower Pupils were able to control any devil beast, as long as his Spiritual Strength was strong enough to endure the impact of the devil beast’s mental energy.

The flying boat slowly entered the domain, and they no longer dared to fly so quickly. If they charged into the territory of an Immortal King devil beast with full speed and couldn’t beat it, they might not be able to run.

“The spiritual qi here is surprisingly dense.” Bai Shishi looked outside. There were quite a few places where immortal mist lingered.

The immortal spiritual qi was dense, making this place perfect for cultivation. But why did no powerful sects set up roots here? It was curious.

“Hey, can you speak?” Bai Shishi looked at Long Chen, who was silently staring out of the window.

“Speak? About what?” asked Long Chen.

Only then did Bai Shishi realize that she hadn’t even asked her question. Seeing his confused look, she was embarrassed. “I was saying, the spiritual qi here is very dense, and it’s suitable for cultivation. Why are the large sects not setting up a base here?”

“The spiritual qi is dense but also contains a wild aura. That’s due to the influence of the devil beasts’ bloodline pressures. If you cultivate here and absorb too much of the spiritual qi, you will become irritable and easy to anger. And when you attack higher realms, heart-devils can easily appear. Moreover, any large purification formations that are set up here will affect the cultivation of the devil beasts, so they will attack. Unless you are prepared to drive out all the devil beasts in the Vile Dragon Domain, no one dares to do such a thing,” explained Long Chen.

The berserk aura within this spiritual qi was suitable for the cultivation of devil beasts but not humans. Hence, purification formations that affected this aura would definitely not be allowed by the devil beasts.

“Then you mean that our academy is prepared for such a thing?” asked Bai Shishi in shock. She hadn’t expected that the academy that had always been low-key would have such daring.

“Most likely. I also don’t know why the academy would choose the seventh branch academy. The academy naturally has its own considerations. I can’t read their intentions, but that doesn’t matter. The main thing is that this move definitely isn’t easy to make. If we try to do it through normal means, it definitely won’t work. So let’s just see what will happen,” said Long Chen.

He was unable to see through the thoughts of the academy. As the world’s number one academy, they could endure all the way to this point. But he also knew that they definitely had their own terrifying trump cards that they relied on behind this. Otherwise, if the High Firmament Academy really had declined to the point that it appeared to, Lord Brahma would have conquered it by now.

As for the intentions of those old monsters in the academy that had lived for countless years, it would be strange if Long Chen could see through them.

Hence, Long Chen didn’t even bother trying to read them. He just needed to do his own work. Accomplishing this mission was all that was required of him.

After flying for a while longer, Long Chen had Bai Shishi put away the flying boat, as the sound it made as it passed through the air was too loud. They had already heard several warning roars.

The flying boat’s sound had clearly disturbed them. Furthermore, a flying boat could not maneuver fast enough. It would be better for them to travel without it.

They then began flying individually. All of a sudden, Long Chen waved his hand, and they all came to a stop. He made a gesture to not make any sound.

After a bit, there was still no movement. But the earth then began to quiver and a distant mountain exploded. An enormous figure came out of the earth.

It was a giant python and it had actually been hidden beneath the earth. When it came out, its target was a leopard.

The leopard had been resting on the mountain peak, but the sudden sneak attack sent it flying into the air. It then clawed the python in the head. Although it had been sneak attacked, it reacted shockingly fast.

As a result, the python’s head smashed into the ground. The mountain range collapsed, and astral winds blew the nearby trees and boulders to dust.

Just at this moment, the ground beneath Long Chen and the others’ feet also exploded. A long tail whipped out from underground, passing by Long Chen and the others. It then wrapped around the leopard.

The leopard managed to avoid the toxic fang but not that tail. Its body was instantly bound.

“It’s done for.” 

Long Chen knew that this leopard was essentially doomed after being bound. They were both Immortal King devil beasts. That leopard was clearly smaller than the python, and the python also clearly viewed the leopard as weaker, which was why it became the target for the python’s hunt.

As expected, the leopard was unable to escape this time, and the python’s fang stabbed into its body.

The leopard roared, but its body was bound. It was unable to break free.

Suddenly, Long Chen made his move. With a flash, he appeared on top of the python’s head. A red glow appeared on his bone saber, and he stabbed it into the python’s head. As a result, its body quivered and its aura slowly faded.

“Damn, is my luck so good today?” Long Chen took advantage of the python not being on guard toward him to launch a killing blow. He was almost unable to believe it. Did he really gain two Immortal King devil beast’s corpses just like this?

Just as he was excited, an alarm rang in his heart. The next moment, his body swayed, and a silent arrow flew right by his neck.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
