Chapter 4820 Curse Arrows

When lightning flickered around Long Chen, the black qi raged, sticking to the lightning like tar.

“Big Brother Long Chen, this curse is so hateful. I can hardly get rid of it,” said Lei Linger angrily.

Long Chen had previously helped Mo Nian expel corpse qi. Thinking that this curse was some kind of corpse qi, Long Chen believed that it wouldn’t be too difficult to get rid of it.

However, he soon realized that the situation was far more complex than expected. Unlike the corpse qi, which behaved like water vaporized by lightning, this curse was like glue sticking to all his manifestations. Removing it was extremely difficult.

“Don’t grumble. We have no other choice as we can’t just watch as he dies. Don’t worry, once he wakes up, we’ll definitely make sure he pays us for this,” replied Long Chen through clenched teeth.

Long Chen had the urge to kick Mo Nian. Just what had he done to get hit by such a terrifying curse?

However, Mo Nian’s life was truly tough. Even after being struck by such a curse, he managed to reach Long Chen so that Long Chen could save him.

Hearing this, Lei Linger unleashed her full power. Millions of lightning runes swirled around Long Chen, slowly pulling out the curse strand by strand.

However, even after the curse was pulled out of him, it didn’t give up. Strands of curse energy revolved around Long Chen, brimming with resentment and ferocity. It was as if they were waiting for Lei Linger’s power to weaken so that they could sneak into Long Chen.

Once Lei Linger extracted them, Huo Linger took over. The strands of curse energy looked like relentless ghouls, and Huo Linger used the Sun Flame to burn them.

However, after burning them for a while, she sensed something wrong.

“Big Brother Long Chen, look!”

Within the Sun Flame, Long Chen beheld a peculiar sight—a large head resembling a tadpole with a long tail adorned with sharp-toothed runes.

As Lei Linger extracted the curse energy, Huo Linger purified it. However, some runes remained, incredibly thin like a single hair, yet brimming with chilling curse energy.

Despite Huo Linger's attempts to refine or burn them, these runes resisted any change. Most frightening of all, they refused to leave and kept their sights on Long Chen.

“Evilmoon, do you want it?” asked Long Chen hopefully.

“Why would I want something like that?” Evilmoon directly refused.

Long Chen’s eyes suddenly lit up. “You can absorb it, and then—”

“I’m not absorbing that thing. Don’t even joke with me,” retorted Evilmoon irritably.

“Hey, Evilmoon, do you have any secret arts capable of transferring these runes to a weapon?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“Wait a moment. I’ll flip through,” said Evilmoon.

“Flip? Flip through what?”

“My memories. I devoured so many dragon souls, and I’m checking to see if any of them have any such technique,” replied Evilmoon, visibly annoyed.

Back then, Evilmoon had devoured countless dragon souls. Unable to merge with so many memories, Evilmoon had chosen to seal them, so it could flip through them in the future.

“Huh, there actually is one. The Evilmoon Curse Art. There’s a section about drawing curse energy into a dragon claw, but it’s a secret art of the dragon race. I don’t know if you can use it to transfer curse energy into a weapon,” remarked Evilmoon.

“Who cares? I have to try it!”

Long Chen had Evilmoon transmit this secret art to him. It might be a divine ability of the dragon race, but to Long Chen, who had merged with the Sovereign clan’s blood, it wasn’t anything difficult.

Long Chen quickly grasped the trick behind this technique. Looking through his inventory, he realized that he had tossed all his weapons to Guo Ran and Xia Chen to study.

Feeling helpless, Long Chen used a secret communication channel to ask Guo Ran to send him his finest arrowhead, and Guo Ran immediately rushed over. Seeing Long Chen surrounded by black qi and terrifying curse energy that was corroding the very heavens, Guo Ran almost pissed himself.

“Boss!”

“I’m fine. Don’t come over here. Just toss it over,” warned Long Chen. Even when he spoke, black qi came out of his mouth.

After delivering the case, Guo Ran rushed off. Long Chen opened the case and saw a mass of palm-sized, rainbow-colored arrowheads inside.

“This fellow works hard. He’s managed to create so many exploding arrows in this short time,” praised Long Chen as he saw thousands of arrowheads in the case. This fellow might be deathly lazy in terms of cultivation, but he worked like his life was on the line when it came to forging.

These arrowheads were all made of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s divine materials, so the runes on them were imbued with the laws of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

When Long Chen picked one arrow up, it rapidly expanded, reaching the same size as an average person as it left the case.

Divine light flowed on top of the arrowhead, and those runes gave off a shocking pressure. Long Chen was amazed. “This is probably his secret weapon. It’s too bad he didn’t get a chance to use it last time. He must be feeling aggrieved about that.”

The amount of energy contained within this arrowhead was alarming. If it exploded in front of a Mortal Saint, they would definitely perish. Even an Earth Saint might die if struck in a vital spot.

Regretfully, Guo Ran hadn’t had a chance to use it. If Long Chen hadn’t told him to bring him his best arrowhead, he wouldn’t have brought it out.

Huo Linger placed her hands on the arrow as she forced the remaining curse runes into the arrowhead.

However, these runes were very stubborn, resisting to the very end. Huo Linger had to unleash her full power to force them into the arrowhead. But even then, they refused to merge with it.

“Big Brother, it’s no good. I can’t get them to merge with it,” grumbled Huo Linger. She was unable to do anything to these curse runes.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen suddenly had a thought and flicked his finger, sending a drop of his blood into the arrowhead. When his blood merged with it, those curse runes went crazy, and without any further prompting, they chased after Long Chen’s blood, merging into the arrowhead along with the blood.

The rainbow arrowhead now bore blood-colored lines intertwined with dark strands, enveloping it in a sinister and deathly aura.

“It’s done!”

Seeing his creation, Long Chen felt delighted and relieved. He continued expelling the curse energy from his body. After being refined by Huo Linger, the curse energy turned into curse runes, and then Long Chen used his blood to draw them into the arrowheads.

It took over thirty arrowheads for Long Chen to expel the curse energy in him. However, there was still a dense curse energy within Mo Nian, so Long Chen had no choice but to do it all over again.

Repeating the process, Long Chen extracted the curse energy ten times before he managed to purify Mo Nian. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Having used over three hundred arrowheads, Long Chen finally sighed in relief. Just as he was preparing to sit and rest, Mo Nian’s eyes flew open and looked at Long Chen excitedly.

“Brother, I’m going to bring you somewhere big!”
