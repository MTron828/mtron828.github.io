Chapter 4562 Slaughtering the Feather Race

“Bastard!”

Wielding the white bone bow, the leader of the Feather race roared furiously. But other than seething with anger and shouting, he couldn’t do anything else. He could only watch as the flame lotus exploded in front of him.

BOOM!

The engulfing flames devoured the space, roasting all members of the Feather race to a crisp, save for the young leader and his eight generals. In an instant, a nauseating scent of charred flesh permeated the air.

The young leader, however, was truly resilient. He withstood Long Chen’s attack head-on, sustaining minimal injuries aside from his wings turning a bit black.

At this moment, a young maiden in a colorful dress appeared, brandishing a blood-red sword. In an instant, she slew the injured eight generals of the Feather race as well.

Those eight were the strongest subordinates of the Feather race’s young leader. While they had somehow survived the first World Extermination Flame Lotus, their injuries were severe.

Facing Huo Linger, they were horrified to find that they couldn’t even move, unable to even flinch as the flame sword cleaved through their bodies.

“You damn bastard, do you have any idea what you’ve done?!” The Feather race’s young leader roared, pointing his bow at Long Chen, his face contorted with fury.

“To not avenge enmities is not a nobleman’s style. Were you sleepwalking when you sneak-attacked me? Why did you ask such a dumb question?” asked Long Chen lightly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Die!” As the Feather race’s young leader roared, a white bone arrow suddenly appeared on his bowstring.

When he nocked the arrow, the entire world seemed to collapse, as if the arrow had sucked the world’s power dry.

Unexpectedly, this peak expert of the Feather race had done a blood sacrifice for the white bone bow to unleash its full power, holding nothing back in his anger.

Seeing this scene, all the surrounding experts hastily fled, including the ones originally fighting the Feather race. This fellow had gone crazy.

In response, stars flowed along Long Chen’s arm, and it slowly gripped the hilt of the saber on his back.

BOOM!

All of a sudden, Long Chen and the Feather race’s young leader made a move at the same time. Both of them were as quick as lightning, and a blood-colored saber collided with a white bone arrow.

A ripple of death erupted, causing the world to flash and twist as it knocked both Long Chen and the Feather expert back.

This ripple unleashed a wave of destruction. From within the wild wind and dust, a figure slowly appeared.

Long Chen stood there like an undefeatable battle god, his blood-colored saber lazily resting on his shoulder. Despite taking that arrow head-on, he appeared unscathed, his black robes swirling around him.

He looked down arrogantly at the Feather race’s young leader. “You lack power, so you rely entirely on your ancestors’ power. I really don’t know where you got the confidence to provoke everyone left and right. Is it so bad to live a good life? Must you constantly seek death?”

“Die, you idiot human!” the Feather race’s young leader roared. An explosive sound emanated from his back, and a pair of enormous wings emerged, exuding an ancient and desolate aura that filled the world.

Following that, just as the onlookers were shocked by his growing aura, a streak of blood-colored lightning flashed, abruptly halting his rising power.

He suddenly stiffened and stared in horror at Long Chen. Following that, a line of blood appeared from the center of his forehead, nose, jaw, throat, chest, and abdomen.

Long Chen slowly returned the blood-colored saber back to its sheath.

Suddenly, the bow ignited with a bright light, transforming into a streak of luminance. Astonishingly, this divine weapon was trying to flee.

“You...” The Feather expert stared at Long Chen hatefully.

“What? You’re going to blame me for not giving you a chance to display your full power? Weren’t you the same when you sneak attacked me? Go die in peace. In your next life, remember not to recklessly cause trouble without having the necessary power,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Just as he finished speaking, the body of the Feather race’s young leader split into two halves and fell to the ground.

A million experts of the Feather race’s army were obliterated by Long Chen alone, and not a single one managed to survive. All the experts around were fleeing for their lives, not daring to block Long Chen’s path.

As Feng You and the mixed beast race passed by, witnessing Long Chen's annihilation of the Feather race, their jaws collectively dropped in awe.

“Let’s go.” Long Chen waved his hand and led them forward in a rush.

The death of that young leader was rather unjust. He was actually extremely powerful, but his fatal weakness was that his power stemmed from his ancestors’ bloodline.

In order to summon the power of his ancestors, he needed time. But just who was Long Chen? Faced with such a clear opening, how could he not exploit it?

In truth, the Dragonblood warriors’ strength lay in their almost monstrous reaction speed. In this scenario, not only Long Chen but even an ordinary Dragonblood warrior would have seized that opening to strike and defeat the Feather race’s young leader.

Oftentimes, in evenly matched battles, a person’s combat experience and reaction speed were the deciding factors.

The starlight around Long Chen seemed to harness the power of heaven and earth, making him resemble a giant ship parting the waves. Ripples continuously spread from Long Chen.

Guided by Long Chen, the mixed beast felt minimal resistance, easily entering this space. This not only provided them with a chance to breathe but also afforded them some buffer room to acclimate to their surroundings.

Like an arrow piercing through the battlefield, they were now only a few miles from the spatial gate. They could almost see every line on the spatial gate.

The further they went, the stronger the experts around them were. Based on Long Chen’s estimate, the weakest Heavenly Doyens here were at least four-star.

When Long Chen and the mixed beast race arrived, they were surprised to find that while everything behind them was a mass of chaos, the region right in front of the gate was peaceful.

Feng You’s instincts immediately kicked in, sending a shiver down her spine. All the experts in the vicinity abruptly directed their attention toward Long Chen and the others simultaneously.

Standing at the very front of them was that white bone warhorse, its withered eyes locking onto them.
