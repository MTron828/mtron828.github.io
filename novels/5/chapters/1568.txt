Chapter 1563 Strange Formation

Translator: BornToBe

The four pillars of light shot into the sky, blowing apart the clouds.

“That direction, isn't it the Grand Han’s capital’s city walls?” cried someone.

The Grand Hand’s capital’s city walls were square-shaped, and its four corners corresponded to the four rays of light. However, now that the capital had vanished, the light seemed to come out of nowhere.

Divine runes filled the sky and fell, covering the world. At this time, a huge barrier had enveloped everyone, including Long Chen and the others.

The first expert who had fled was at the front, but when he slammed into the barrier, he exploded into bloody mist.

“What?!”

The experts rushing to flee hastily stopped themselves. However, the barrier had appeared too suddenly, and quite a few people weren’t able to stop their momentum and struck it.

Continuous explosive sounds rang out as those people were all blown to bits. Even their Ancestral items exploded.

The appearance of this sudden barrier shocked everyone, including Long Chen. Was it to keep everyone here?

However, when he looked at Yan Weishan and the others, he saw that they also had surprised expressions. They clearly hadn’t known about this beforehand.

“Peng Wansheng, isn’t this formation supposed to be used for trapping Long Chen? Why is it trapping all of us?” cried an expert from the ancient family alliance.

Peng Wansheng was also befuddled, and he roared back, “Sha Guangyan was the one who arranged this barrier! It was only supposed to be used to trap people within the city. How am I supposed to know what happened?!”

Sha Guangyan had invited an expert to set up a killing formation within the Grand Han’s capital, turning it into a giant cage that Long Chen would never be able to escape from.

All the matters were left to the mysterious expert Sha Guangyan had invited. Apparently, that formation master was extremely mysterious, but his enmity with Long Chen was like a sea of blood, which was why he had come to help Sha Guangyan. However, that mysterious expert hadn’t revealed his face the entire time. And since Sha Guangyan was dead, no one knew where that mysterious expert had gone to.

Now the formation had ended up covering a huge space ten times greater than it was supposed to. No one could escape now.

“Send out the distress signal!”

“You idiot, the formation blocks our messages!”

Panicked cries rang out. Someone tried launching a ranged attack at the formation, but the barrier caused his attack to rebound and kill him.

“Dragonblood Legion, ignore the formation. Kill all these people!” shouted Long Chen. Although he didn’t know the situation behind the formation, at least currently, it didn’t matter.

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!

“No!”

The Dragonblood Legion’s rhythm didn’t change. They were like one giant slaughter machine, slaying these experts in droves. Their so-called alliance was thrown in complete chaos and they were unable to form any effective defense. More and more of them were dying.

“Zither Fairy, your Illusive Music Immortal Palace is also one of the protectors of the continent! Are you just going to watch these murderous devils do as they please?!” Yan Weishan suddenly let out a furious roar. The three of them were unable to do anything to Long Chen, and they couldn't help their people.

The experts standing in the neutral camp turned to Zi Yan in surprise. Did Zi Yan have some sort of relationship with Pill Valley? What did it mean for them to be the protectors of the Martial Heaven Continent? They had never heard of such a thing.

“How despicable,” snorted Yu Tong disdainfully.

Zi Yan didn’t react. It was like she hadn’t heard Yan Weishan’s shout. It was unknown what she was thinking.

“Zither Fairy, please-!”

Pfft!

“Zither Fairy, save me-!”

Pfft!

Although there were many experts on that side, the Dragonblood Legion cut them down like wheat, harvesting their lives. They had nowhere to run now and began to beg Zi Yan for help, but their begging ended up splitting their attention, causing them to die even faster.

Twang!

The sound of a zither suddenly rang out as heavy as a bell. People felt like their spiritual yuan and Heavenly Dao energy were instantly stripped away. As a result, the magical arts and Battle Skills that were in the midst of being unleashed dissipated.

Everyone was shocked and involuntarily paused, turning to look at Zi Yan in shock.

Long Chen also stopped fighting and flew back to the Dragonblood Legion. He stared at Zi Yan coldly.

Yan Weishan, Hu Xiaolin, and Jin Mingwei also returned to their own groups. The other experts hid behind them like chicks behind their mother hen.

Previously, they had been full of disdain toward the Dragonblood Legion. Now, they only had fear.

Yan Weishan couldn’t help sighing with relief inside upon seeing Zi Yan interfere. On the other hand, Hu Xiaolin’s eyes were spitting flames. The experts he had brought from the Darkwing Devil Tiger race had been cut down. Only three of them remained.

That was partially the result of the Darkwing Devil Tiger race’s experts being too conceited. They had charged to the very front of the battlefield, so naturally their losses were greater. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Miss Zi Yan, are you becoming enemies with me?” Long Chen took a deep breath, doing his best to keep his voice calm. However, he was unable to do so. His voice contained a kind of anger that could not be described with words.

Long Chen didn’t fear any of his enemies, but he didn’t want to become enemies with people he knew. Most importantly, there was a faint relationship between himself and Zi Yan that was very unclear. For Zi Yan to interfere made him feel extremely aggrieved and even indignant.

“None of you are to participate.” Zi Yan looked back at Yu Tong and the others she had brought before slowly walking out.

Zi Yan walked to the middle of the two camps. She lightly shook her head. “I don’t want to be your enemy, nor have I ever wanted to be. I hope that this matter can end here. You’ve already done what you’ve come to do. Your friends, you’ve saved. The person you wanted to kill, you’ve killed. You’ve gotten your vengeance, you’ve established your power, you’ve intimidated everyone. Your light will drown out everyone else in the Eastern Xuan Region. There is no one in the junior generation who can compete against you any longer. You’ve already done everything you can do, so you can release these innocent people.”

Zi Yan looked at Long Chen with a complicated expression. There was even a touch of panic in her eyes as she didn’t know what she should do. However, she had no choice but to come out because she was the future successor of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace. There were some things that she had to face. She couldn’t run.

“Tell me, who is innocent?” demanded Long Chen.

Seeing Long Chen’s current appearance toward her, Zi Yan was pained. However, she had no choice but to force herself to say, “There are many people here who didn’t know what exactly happened. It was Sha Guangyan who-”

Long Chen interrupted, “Are you telling me that people can do whatever they want as long as they don’t know what’s really happening? Not knowing allows them to do whatever they want to suck up to others? Not knowing allows them to raise their butcher’s blade against my brothers? That’s just a huge joke. A person isn’t free from their crimes just because they don’t know the details. If that were true, I would simply kill them all and say that I didn’t know the details, so no one could get vengeance on me.”

Long Chen’s voice grew louder and louder until it was a furious roar filled with killing intent.

“Are their heads just for show? You want me to let them off because they’re innocent? However, even if they didn’t know the truth, they still came to kill us. If we weren’t strong enough, we’d have been annihilated, and who would come out to say that we were innocent then? So don’t talk to me about how people are innocent. That word is nauseating. Don’t bring up anything about truth either because there is no truth in this world. Whoever’s mouth is larger, whoever’s fist is harder is the one telling the truth. What did they do when Pill Valley slandered me? They curried favor, not caring about the truth to suck up to Pill Valley. Since they had the conscience to do this and be enemies with me, wanting to kill me, tell me why exactly I am supposed to let them go?”

Long Chen’s voice rose in waves and crashed down like a tsunami. It was like the entire world was echoing his roar. His roar was like that of a demon god, and the killing intent in his eyes showed his hatred.

Long Chen never told others about his grievances. He didn’t need to explain himself to others. However, being blocked by Zi Yan infuriated him to the point that he needed to vent his rage.

“Long Chen, slaughter isn’t able to solve problems. The great era is coming, but each time a great era comes, it’s followed by a terrifying tribulation. The heavenly geniuses that rise in each great era always give birth to a Sovereign in the end. However, no Sovereign walked to the peak through slaughter. They were unrivaled due to their humanity. Long Chen, I don’t want to be enemies with you. I’m begging you not to slaughter these innocent people,” said Zi Yan.

Long Chen looked at Zi Yan, staring into her eyes. The atmosphere was so tense that it was possible to hear the drop of a pin.

The Dragonblood warriors didn’t make a sound. Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er exchanged looks, not knowing what to say.

In truth, they had long since learned of Long Chen’s relationship with Zi Yan. Back in the Eastern Wasteland, Zi Yan had sent him a photographic jade with a recording of a soul calming song. It had been extremely beneficial to the Dragonblood Legion’s growth back then. Each of them had benefited from it.

As women, they saw Zi Yan’s special feelings toward Long Chen. Chu Yao suddenly opened her mouth, but she saw Meng Qi wave her hand.

Meng Qi knew about Chu Yao’s gentle nature. She wanted to let Long Chen take a step back. It was as Zi Yan said. Up to now, Long Chen was the greatest winner. He had gotten everything he wanted to get.

However, Meng Qi understood Long Chen and knew not to advise him when he was angry.

“Fine,” said Long Chen suddenly.

Everyone was shocked. Long Chen was actually conceding? Zi Yan was relieved, but his next words made her heart grow cold.

“I can let off the innocents. I’ll have Meng Qi investigate their souls, and if they really didn’t know anything and thought I was truly wrong, I’ll release them. But if they knew I was wrongly accused but still targeted me for ulterior motives, then sorry, I’m not in the habit of letting off my enemies. They must die!” Long Chen’s gaze swept across Yan Weishan and the others, his voice capable of cutting iron.
