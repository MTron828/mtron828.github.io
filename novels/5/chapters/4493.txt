Chapter 4482 Reckless

The golden divine pool seemed to be scalding. As it enveloped the monkey-faced Doyen, the immense heat caused him to start bubbling.

BOOM!

He finally summoned his manifestation. However, to everyone’s surprise, this golden liquid was melting his manifestation as well. As a result, he was unable to use his Doyen power.

“AHH!”

The monkey-faced Doyen struggled frantically, but the golden liquid stuck to him tightly, continuously burning him and his soul.

He couldn’t blame anyone for this; his provocations had been too infuriating. Bai Shishi’s killing intent was at full power. While she could kill him in one blow if she wanted to, she refused to do so. This golden liquid was her core energy and could transform into all kinds of forms. In this particular state, it wasn’t at its strongest, but it inflicted the most excruciating pain.

This was a kind of torture. The golden liquid slowly burned away all of his power, stripping away his life bit by bit. He was experiencing unimaginable pain at the moment.

It was Bai Shishi’s first time using this move as she truly hated this monkey.

The Dragonblood Legion descended as well. In groups of eighteen, they started to choose their own Doyen targets. The first four squads attacked at the same time, catching the four Doyens off-guard with their overwhelming power. The Doyens were instantly left flustered, retreating in a panic.

Sharp blades slashed through them, bringing with them a rain of blood. These swords exuded a sharpness that sent shivers down the spines of those witnessing it.

The edges of these swords now incorporated special materials—the Saint-level materials from that mysterious world. This addition greatly increased their offensive speed and power.

Although those swords were still Eternal items, the addition of the new materials made them absolutely top grade. Just like that, a slash from a Dragonblood warrior cut a Doyen’s Eternal spear in two. Their weapons were simply not on the same level.

The Dragonblood warriors’ assault looked chaotic, completely different from their usual fighting style. Yet, their killing power was even more terrifying.

Eighteen sharp swords approached a Doyen from different directions and with different timings. If the Doyen blocked one, he or she couldn’t defend against the others. In the end, the Doyens struggled to protect themselves but were swiftly drenched in blood.

The Dragonblood warriors were in no rush to kill them. Their swords repeatedly sliced through flesh. In a matter of breaths, the four Doyens practically became pork chops, their flesh cut off piece by piece.

“Save me!”

One of those Doyens cried out in terror, wanting to form an alliance with the others beside him. However, no one paid him any attention.

The Doyens were weakening bit by bit as their injuries mounted. At this moment, the Dragonblood Legion wasted no time. Their attacks intensified, and they swiftly killed those four Doyens, slicing their Yuan Spirits apart.

“No!”

Just then, a terrified and unwilling roar came from the golden pool. The monkey-faced Doyen let out one final scream before being turned into mist, his soul extinguished.

Five Heavenly Doyens met their demise in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, the ones to slay them were not Doyens or even budding Doyens. This revelation shocked everyone.

People looked toward the flying boat and saw Long Chen looking over things apathetically. As they observed him more closely, a shiver ran down their spines. Long Chen’s aura was even more terrifying than during his battle with Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“A group of reckless idiots. You don’t know what respect is. If you all want to die so badly, why can’t you just do it yourselves? At least, you’d be able to leave your corpses intact that way. Now, you just had to get yourselves killed by others. Why bother?” Guo Ran sneered at those stupefied experts.

“You can’t put it that way. People are born with nothing, and they will die with nothing. I feel like doing this isn’t bad. At least, it saves them from stinking somewhere up when they die,” replied Xia Chen.

The two played off each other’s words, shocking and enraging these experts. The Dragonblood Legion actually didn’t place them in their eyes, viewing Doyens as ants.

“Damn humans, what right do you have to be arrogant?! Long Chen, I challenge you to a battle! Do you dare to accept?!”

A furious roar suddenly rang out, and a muscular man with two hatchets on his back and a face covered in facial hair walked out. His Blood Qi was shocking, and veins wriggled beneath his skin like snakes. The pressure he exuded far surpassed that of the recently slain Doyens.

When this guy appeared, Long Chen’s eyes gleamed with excitement, but he wasn’t the only one who did this. Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and Bai Xiaole’s eyes also lit up.

This was a powerful Heavenly Doyen. Based on what they saw, his power could be on par with that of Netherdragon Tianzhao. They were all tempted to fight him.

“Boss, you wouldn’t…” started Xia Chen.

Long Chen was speechless. When did this fellow become so sinister? Xia Chen immediately used words to prevent Long Chen from ruining their fun.

“Fine, go ahead. But remember, I don’t want him alive,” said Long Chen helplessly.

If he was going to be their boss, he had to act like one. He couldn’t fight with his brothers over resources.

Hearing that, they were all delighted. Guo Ran was itching to get started.

“We’ll do it fairly! Rock, paper, scissors!”

“Damn!”

As a result, Guo Ran, the one to propose this competition, was the first to be eliminated. He retreated sullenly and turned away, drawing circles on the ground sadly.

After a few rounds, Xia Chen became the final winner. The others could only accept their defeat and stare at him enviously.

“Don’t worry, your time will come. After all, fortunes come and go!” said Xia Chen proudly.

Their actions left people stupefied. The hatchet-wielding man was one of the main pillars of their alliance this time, and he was extremely powerful. However, the Dragonblood Legion actually treated him like this.

Rather than Long Chen himself fighting, his subordinates were using such a method to decide who would fight him? Did they view him as nothing more than a piece of meat?

After staring in confusion for a while, the hatchet-wielding man was enraged. Steam almost burst out of his ears, and his killing intent exploded. If looks could kill, the Dragonblood Legion would have been killed countless times over.

“Remember, don’t let him run. His life is useful to me,” transmitted Long Chen.

Xia Chen nodded and walked through the air toward the hatchet-wielding man. It presented a stark contrast—the Heavenly Doyen was a robust and muscular figure, while Xia Chen appeared frail in comparison. His aura was feeble, and it looked as if that man could crush him in his hand.

“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll kill you first!”

The large man roared and summoned his Heavenly Dao manifestation. Within it, an enormous figure emerged—a formidable greater demon. Seeing this, everyone suddenly comprehended the source of his potent Blood Qi.

As his hatchets materialized in his hands, his Doyen power surged. Innumerable runes illuminated his hatchets, and he swung one down toward Xia Chen.

Facing that powerful attack, Xia Chen raised a single hand, as if wanting to block that hatchet barehanded.

“What?!”

At that moment, both friends and foes alike jumped in shock.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
