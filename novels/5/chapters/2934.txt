Chapter 2923 I’ll Give You Half

“Alright. Our Chu family admits defeat. Long Chen, you are a generation’s hero. The grudge that formed between us is due to the Luo family. Although those two girls are young and pretty, they aren’t nation-toppling beauties. As long as you agree, the Chu family will give you ten thousand beauties like them. Their talent and looks will definitely not be inferior as well. If you are willing to release Chu Kuang, the Chu family is even willing to bestow you with unimaginable wealth. The Chu family is willing to form good relationships with someone of limitless potential like you. You can have everything. But if you let your temper get the better of you and you kill Chu Kuang, not only will you become the Chu family’s mortal enemy, but you will also be provoking Divine Venerate Brahma. When the Chu family reports this to the Divine Venerate, the Nine Underworld Hunters will be dispatched. Then no matter where you run, you won’t be able to escape. I trust that you’ll make a wise choice,” said Chu Huairen, his words containing both threats and rewards. He gave Long Chen both face and a way out.

“Nine Underworld Hunters?” asked Long Chen with interest.

That expression of his gave Chu Huairen some confidence. He calmly said, “It seems that you know of the Nine Underworld Hunters. They are the number one assassination organization within the nine heavens and ten lands. Their assassins are spread throughout every corner of the world. If they set their sights on you, they will become your worst nightmare. You won’t even be able to close your eyes for fear that you’ll lose your life with a single blink. Of course, you don’t need to worry about this. The Chu family will live up to its promise. As long as you release Chu Kuang, everyone can benefit.”

Everyone stared at Long Chen, only to see him smile and say, “In truth, I don’t want to offend your Chu family. You’re right. In truth, I’ve been infatuated by those two beauties from the Luo family…”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning’s hearts sank. They turned pale. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“But for the Luo family, I’d have to offend the Chu family and some Divine Venerate, as well as get chased down by some Nine Underworld Hunters. I’m getting afraid. Actually, I was just bragging when I said there’s nothing I’m afraid of. Don’t take it seriously…” Long Chen laughed.

The spectators couldn’t help sighing. So Long Chen really was compromising. But not many could feel contempt for this. If the positions were changed, they also wouldn’t dare to kill Chu Kuang because Divine Venerate Brahma was not someone they could provoke. Not even the academy could provoke him.

Otherwise, they wouldn’t be the only ones that were killed. Their families would be wiped out as well. Although Long Chen was a lower world ascender, if he was investigated, then whatever world he had ascended from would probably be destroyed.

This was the cultivation world, and power was everything. Reason? Principle? Justice? They were meaningless.

“Hahaha, that’s good. In the future, you will be the Chu family’s most respected guest.” Chu Huairen laughed, concealing his disdain and ruthlessness.

Once Chu Kuang was handed over, he would definitely think of some way to kill Long Chen. Today’s battle had made Long Chen and Chu Kuang enemies that could not rest until one side was killed. How could they really let Long Chen off?

“I was originally thinking of letting him off, but that laugh of yours sounds like it contains hidden blades. It’s a bit frightening. I suddenly don’t feel so sure.” What kind of person was Long Chen? How could he not understand what Chu Huairen intended?

Chu Huairen’s smile stiffened, and a bad feeling rose within him once again. But he still put on an innocent expression. “No need to be afraid. Our Chu family is known for always keeping our word. Do we look like people who would break promises?”

Long Chen looked into the distance and hesitated. Clenching his teeth, he said, ”Then how about this? In order to be safe, I’ll only give you half of him for now. That way, I’ll have more confidence.”

“Half? How can you give us half?” asked Chu Huairen.

Long Chen then tightened his hand, and Chu Kuang’s head was ripped off of his body. After that, Long Chen tossed the part below the neck to Chu Huairen. “I’ll keep his head. Once you fulfill your promise, I’ll return my half to you.”

Chu Kuang had yet to advance to the Divine Flame realm, so his divine flame seed was still in his Dantian. With his head ripped off, he instantly died. He didn’t even have time to make a sound.

Originally, he was already starting to feel safe when he heard Long Chen and Chu Huairen’s conversation. He even had a small smile on his face.

Now, the expression that remained on his head was that of bewilderment. The light within his eyes slowly faded.

Chu Huairen almost instinctively received Chu Kuang’s body. His head was blank, and everyone was silent. It was as if time had stopped.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning covered their mouths, staring with wide eyes at this sudden turn. Just as the discussion ended, the main topic was killed.

“Long Chen!”

Chu Huairen and the other magistrate instantly exploded with killing intent and attacked. The Heavenly Daos rumbled.

Long Chen instantly found that he couldn’t move, and he felt miniscule compared to this power. Yet, he didn’t show any fear. As expected, Sword Qi slashed through their auras.

Two hands were pierced by this sword, and the locking power was instantly destroyed, giving Long Chen his freedom again. However, the only difference was that the head judge was now standing in front of him.

“To disturb the exams of disciples and even try to kill a disciple, you have knowingly broken the law as the heads of the Discipline Institute. Kneel and face your punishment!” shouted the head judge.

“You…!” Chu Huairen was alarmed. Just now, they had attacked, thinking that one could stop the head judge, while the other could kill Long Chen.

However, with a single sword, the head judge pierced both their palms. He was too fast for them to even track with their eyes.

Despite being in the same realm, their actual combat power was worlds apart. This head judge that came from the Battle God Palace was simply far too powerful for them.

“Kneel and face your punishment. This is your second warning!” barked the head judge.

Chu Huairen and the other magistrate’s expressions suddenly changed. They thought of a certain matter.

“Kneel and face your punishment. This is your third-!”

Without a word, the two of them knelt down.

The three heads of the Discipline Institute had actually fought here, with two of them kneeling in defeat.

The head judge’s expression was cold, but he sighed inside. The two of them had reacted fast enough. If they hadn’t knelt with the third warning, he would have been able to righteously kill them. It was a shame.

Just at this moment, in the distance, the clouds shook. A pillar of light soared from the altar.
