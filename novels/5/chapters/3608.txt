Chapter 3597

The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was fully shaken. The discipline hall spent three days collecting evidence. As a result, of the three hundred and forty-seven traitors, nineteen of them were executed for causing the deaths of their fellow sect members.

The rest had reported secrets of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College to the Luo clan. Although that was also a betrayal, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College had not made any major movements during this time, thus they had not suffered any losses.

Even when Tu Hu’s group was suddenly ambushed, in truth, that mission was no secret. It couldn’t even be blamed on those people, as the information could have been gathered elsewhere.

In other words, although the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College had had so many traitors, Xue Yifan still managed to control things. During the time that the Alldevil Star-Field was sealed, the college didn’t make any major movements, resulting in these spies not contributing any value to the Luo clan. It was all under control.

The discipline hall’s judgment came down as soon as the three days were up. Other than the nineteen people that were executed, the rest were also punished. Some had their cultivation bases crippled, some had the mark of traitors branded on them, and some were imprisoned. Even those that hadn’t managed to cause any real damage to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College were expelled.

When the sentencing came down, countless people begged and wailed for mercy. These experts that were normally arrogant and aloof, experts that possessed great authority within the college, no longer had any of their previous dignity. It made people sigh that it was a shame. But sympathy did not quell their rage.

Originally, the sentencing of the discipline hall should be personally overseen by Guo Ran. That was to show off his dignity as the proxy dean.

However, Guo Ran detested such things and refused to go. He was not planning on being the dean. Now that Long Chen had come, he felt that he no longer needed to think about anything other than living happily.

While the discipline hall sentenced the traitors, Guo Ran, Long Chen, and the others returned to Guo Ran’s residence. Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the others gathered those that they trusted for a grand feast in celebration.

Although Guo Ran had been the weakest of the four heroes, as long as a person was strong enough, they would still have quite a few followers.

Other than Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the others that he absolutely trusted, there were quite a few other loyal followers. Having slain Wang Zixu, he had satisfied all of them.

Although Guo Ran had wept and bawled on the martial stage, which was a bit embarrassing and damaging to his image, those who understood him knew that it was his grief due to not being able to protect Tu Bao. Hence, none of these people felt Guo Ran to be embarrassing. They only felt even closer and even greater reverence for him.

Even though he was the lowest of the four heroes, he treated those beneath him as brothers. Thus, even though Guo Ran’s side was targeted on all sides, there were still hundreds of people willing to follow him.

These hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate him. They were even happier than Guo Ran about him becoming the proxy dean. They no longer needed to be bullied.

Now, when others looked at them, they would look with reverence. Others that had treated them badly before were now extremely courteous. As for those that had bullied them, they were now full of terror and unease. Those gazes were truly refreshing to them.

Guo Ran was also excited. He had no interest in being the dean, but the feeling of having vented all of his emotions was amazing.

Long Chen wasn’t stingy. He directly took out a few jugs of wine and distributed them for the celebration. But he didn’t give them bowls to drink out of. Instead, he distributed small cups, otherwise, everyone would go crazy for it.

This was the Wine God Palace’s wine. Let alone seeing it before, many amongst these people had not even heard of the name of the Wine God Palace. As soon as this wine entered their stomachs, the powerful wine energy spread throughout their bodies, reinvigorating them. Their essence, qi, and spirits merged, promoting each other. That feeling felt like paradise.

Although they didn’t know what this wine was, they knew that a wine that could increase their power just from drinking it had to be an absolute treasure. Long Chen had told them to sip it slowly. Feeling that this wine was too precious for them, they didn’t feel good drinking more of it. Every person only drank three cups before stopping.

Long Chen smiled when he saw that. “I have plenty of wine, and it’s enough to bathe in. Don’t worry about my costs. I told you to drink it slowly because I didn’t want you to rush and not digest it. If you directly collapsed from being drunk, you would miss this rare chance. This is divine wine, and it has the best effect the first time you drink it. As long as you don’t collapse from it, drink as much as you want. But if you feel like you’re going to collapse, take a break before drinking more.”

Hearing that, those disciples were delighted and began drinking slowly once again. Every time they drank a cup, they felt their bodies change. That feeling was euphoric.

“Boss really is the boss. Following you, there’s food and drink. I don’t have to worry about anything!” Guo Ran laughed delightedly as he drank this fine wine.

“That’s right, you little fellow. How did you manage to merge Split the Heavens with your battle armor?” asked Long Chen.

Guo Ran chuckled, feeling very pleased. “Hehe, I’m not bragging, but other than myself, no one else could have imagined this. In my Devil Dragon Battle Armor, I created eighty-one core parts to take the place of the body’s acupuncture points. Then I found a suitable path through the 108,000 scales to embed runes. Boss, I won’t lie to you, this took endless testing and experimentation. The failures are definitely greater than a million. But I persevered and I succeeded.”

Guo Ran was unable to use the nine forms of Split the Heavens himself, but he was very smart and split the unleashed power into three parts: the inner, middle, and outer.

The inner was his own body, the middle was the portion connecting his body and his battle armor, while the outer was his armor’s scales.

Split the Heavens was too ferocious. His physical body wasn’t strong enough to endure the strain that it placed on the body. But relying on the battle armor, without the physical body as the lead, there was no way to activate the Split the Heavens.

Guo Ran had blazed his own path, using his physical body as the start of the attack, his battle armor as the support, and his saber as an extension. Through countless failures, he finally found his own unique activation method.

Guo Ran didn’t possess Long Chen’s powerful physical body, nor did he feel such an affinity for the Heavenly Daos. Hence, once he used Split the Heavens, he would receive a backlash from the Heavenly Daos. But this fellow had designed a set of runes to block off the backlash of the Heavenly Daos, placing all the strain on his battle armor, while he himself suffered no pressure.

After hearing this explanation from Guo Ran, Long Chen couldn’t help feeling admiration for him. At least, this fellow had some good points. At the very least, when it came to forging, he was willing to work hard.

It had to be known that Split the Heavens was a Battle Skill from the mortal world. The immortal world’s laws were different, so the original activation method no longer worked.

Even Long Chen had spent a long time testing in the immortal world before finding a method for unleashing it.

As for Guo Ran, he was unable to even use this technique. But just based on the principles, he managed to use the first form of Split the Heavens with his armor. This fellow was undoubtedly a genius in this regard.

“Regretfully, my Devil Dragon Battle Armor can’t even be considered a half-finished product. There are still many arrangements that I haven’t finished. It’s like a bottomless pit of potential that I haven’t tapped into. Boss, are you poor or rich right now?” Guo Ran’s eyes suddenly brightened.

“I suppose I can count as rich!” said Long Chen. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“How rich?”

“The Soaring Dragon is my family. I can take out anything from them,” said Long Chen with a laugh.

Guo Ran’s eyes widened. “Boss, the Soaring Dragon you’re talking about, is it the Soaring Dragon Company?”

“Yes. That’s my personal treasury. Although the majority of the treasures are still stored there, I’ve withdrawn a few. Just tell me what you’re lacking right now!”

Long Chen laughed. Could it be that Guo Ran had known that he had too much money to spend, so Guo Ran was helping him take care of this problem?

“Hahaha, boss, as long as you have money, I’m not afraid of anything!”

Guo Ran raised his head and laughed heroically. His Devil Dragon Battle Armor had endless potential. As long as he had money, he could increase his combat power limitlessly. Hence, Guo Ran’s confidence soared.
