Chapter 4765 There is no Surrender, Only Reincarnation

The place where the light was coming from was the entrance to the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. However, this entrance had countless lifeforms blocking it at the moment.1

They seemed endless and had fully sealed the entrance. Anyone who wanted to pass had to obtain their approval first before being let through.0

Due to the large number of people trying to get by, there was a large blockade. It seemed that they were in no rush to let everyone through.0

When Long Chen and the others arrived, those people blocking the gate instantly erupted into roars.2

“It’s Long Chen! He’s here!”1

Their voices were quivering with emotion as they had waited eagerly for Long Chen's arrival.1

Long Chen’s appearance caused a wave of experts to come toward him, each one brimming with killing intent as they regarded him as prey.1

The disturbance drew the attention of everyone stuck by the gate. They had been irritated at being blocked, almost starting a fight just to get by. However, seeing this scene, they were no longer in any rush to charge in and just paused to watch.1

“Children, your chance is here! The Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s three thousand clan alliance has put a death warrant on Long Chen! Whoever takes his head will be treated as a V.I.P. by all those factions! They will be treated like the vice clan head, enjoying profits every month and year for a hundred years from three thousand clans! You can become famous overnight! The path of cultivation is a path of proving yourself by trampling over other experts! Long Chen is right in front of you! What are you waiting for?” A Sage King passionately urged the crowd, directing his own subordinates at Long Chen.11

“Do you want to be famous the moment you enter the Sovereign Emperor Heaven? If you want a foothold in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, you need a certain amount of prestige! Kill Long Chen, and you’ll have everything you need!” roared another Sage King.2

These Sage Kings, though flushed with anticipation, refrained from leading the charge. After all, the reward offered by the three thousand clans came with specific conditions: only those in the Divine Venerate realm could claim it by killing Long Chen; Sage Kings wouldn't qualify.0

Hailing from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, these Sage Kings were profoundly aware of the power of those clans, so they knew how great this reward was.0

Even these Sage Kings felt that the income of a vice clan head was extravagant. The allure of receiving three thousand portions of the vice clan heads' income, for a century no less, drove some people to the brink of madness.0

“Warriors of the Celestial race, Long Chen slaughtered our people! We must personally avenge this enmity! We will be the ones to take his head!” roared an expert with a face like coal.0

No one knew what technique this coal-faced expert used, but the world suddenly grew murky, and his saber came slashing out of that murky space.0

The moment this vague saber-image flew out, it grew by millions of times. This saber possessed boundless destructive will, and it directly slashed toward Long Chen despite the distance.0

“The Celestial race has warriors? Aren’t you a group of contemptible trash?” Long Chen snorted and extended a hand straight toward that immense saber.1

BOOM!2

Long Chen's grip tightened around the edge of the saber, sending shockwaves reverberating through heaven and earth. A powerful ripple emanated from his palm, causing astral winds to surge in all directions and blast back the robes of the Dragonblood warriors, yet they stood firm like immovable boulders, not even batting an eye in front of this attack.0

“What?!”0

The fact that Long Chen blocked this attack shocked countless experts, especially the Celestial race.0

After all, the dark-faced expert was the Celestial race’s peak heavenly genius, and ordinary nine star Doyens were not even qualified to challenge him. He could definitely be classified as a monster in the Celestial race.4

Although his attack was nothing more than a probing blow, its might was still terrifying. Hence, for Long Chen to block it with ease stunned them.0

“It seems that your Celestial race really is a group of pigs that only remember feedings, not beatings. Last time, my lesson wasn’t painful enough for you, is that it? Alright then, this time, I’ll make sure that you remember it.”0

Long Chen then clenched his hand and crushed the enormous saber-image into Heavenly Dao runes that dissipated back into heaven and earth, looking like a brilliant firework.0

Everyone was startled by this. This place might not be the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, but everyone here still sensed the influence of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s laws. As a result, the majority of newcomers were unable to even unleash magical arts and divine abilities here. Even if they were capable of using them, their power was a far cry from usual.0

Seeing these Heavenly Dao runes, everyone knew that the dark-faced man’s power was beyond their comprehension. Someone who could unleash such a powerful technique had to be extraordinary, but Long Chen had crushed such a powerful divine ability barehanded, so his power had to be even more extraordinary.0

The dark-faced man shook intensely when Long Chen crushed his attack, and he involuntarily took a few steps back, his expression growing serious.0

After waving his hand for a bit, Long Chen looked at the mass of experts charging toward him and declared, “It doesn’t matter what reason you have. Anyone who raises their blade against me shall meet their end in the bloodsoaked yellow springs. When the Dragonblood Legion attacks, there is no surrender for you, only reincarnation.”21

Long Chen then grabbed Evilmoon and placed it on his shoulders. Just like that, one man and one saber stared down upon the masses, their killing intent filling the sky. 0

The moment Long Chen took out Evilmoon, all the Dragonblood warriors grasped their own weapons, their movements in perfect unison. In front of this crowd of experts, none of them exuded the slightest fear, only merciless bloodthirst.0

“Don’t listen to his bullshit! If every person here spits on them once, we can simply drown them! Attack together! The lucky one will cut off his dog head!” shouted a Sage King to raise the troops’ morale.0𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, right after that, he exploded.0

BOOM!1

“I really hate people who talk like crows.” 0

Behind Long Chen, Guo Ran slowly lowered his crossbow, switching it out for his dual sabers. Due to how sneaky Guo Ran’s actions were, not many people knew that he was the one who killed that Sage King. So, these people continued their charge.4

“Brothers of the Dragonblood Legion, we shall embark on our journey to supremacy in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven with this slaughter! Kill!”2

“Kill!”0

“Kill!”0

“Kill!”1

The battle cries of the Dragonblood warriors reverberated through the heavens. Divine weapons were swiftly drawn from their sheaths and scabbards, hurtling toward the approaching horde of enemies.
