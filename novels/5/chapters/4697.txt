“Were the rumors true? So, Long Chen really has the Heaven Earth Cauldron?”

“Weren’t those rumors squashed when he scammed some people?”

“People can be scammed but not the heavens! There’s no way the Heaven Earth Cauldron would manifest in Long Chen’s tribulation if he didn’t have karma connected to it!”

First, the nine star heir and then the mythical Warrior of the Starry Sky—both were existences who should have never appeared in someone’s tribulation. After their appearances, the spectators thought they were already numb to the impossible.

But when the Heaven Earth Cauldron appeared, they lost their minds. The Heaven Earth Cauldron was unlike the nine star heir or Warrior of the Starry Sky; its name was known to all, and quite a few people had seen illustrations of it.

After all, the experts that could come here were all extraordinary figures, so most of them recognized the Heaven Earth Cauldron. However, their shock quickly transformed into greed.

“With Long Chen’s character and power, how could he have the Heaven Earth Cauldron?!”

A furious roar split the air. Jealousy was always able to completely change people. With greed glinting in their eyes, even Luo Changsheng and his companions found themselves unable to suppress the heavy anticipation building within them.

The Heaven Earth Cauldron was one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, revered as the mightiest of divine weapons across the nine heavens and ten lands. How could any mortal resist its allure? Upon learning that the Heaven Earth Cauldron was in Long Chen’s possession, a frenzy overtook all within the tribulation, their expressions twisted into madness at the prospect of obtaining unparalleled power.

When the Heaven Earth Cauldron appeared, the Ghost Ships and ancient lifeforms exploded, transforming into lightning runes that surged toward the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Other than the Warrior of the Starry Sky, all the energy within the heavenly tribulation was fully absorbed by it.

At the same time, the aura of Luo Changsheng, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yin Jiushang, and the others suddenly grew explosively. They were all Divine Venerates now.

“The tribulation is over?”

Sensing the qualitative change in their power, Luo Changsheng and the others didn’t dare to believe it. After all, the heavenly tribulation wasn’t over yet, but they had already become Divine Venerates.

They couldn’t feel even a hint of happiness. Since they had advanced before the tribulation was over, didn’t that mean that they were rejected by the tribulation? They were simply unqualified to keep going.

Hence, the only one in the tribulation was now Long Chen. Seeing this scene, they felt like they had been slapped in the face, having a profound sense of defeat and humiliation. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Heaven Earth Cauldron quivered, with lightning runes flowing around it. People could see through the cauldron to behold Long Chen bound by countless chains.

After struggling a bit, Long Chen was fully bound by countless chains. Lei Linger used the Warrior of the Starry Sky to attack those chains, but after a few strikes, the indomitable whale spine exploded.

The very fabric of heaven and earth quivered as Long Chen’s bones creaked under the pressure of the chains. The intensity was so overwhelming that he felt as though his eyes might be forced out of their sockets, and he was no longer able to even speak. The moment he opened his mouth, he felt like he’d be crushed.

“Senior, how can this be happening?!” Long Chen asked the Earth Cauldron.

“Hold on. If you can endure this, everything will end. These are heavenly fate chains, and they are composed of your karma. You cannot break them, so you can only endure,” replied the Earth Cauldron gravely.

The Earth Cauldron wanted to help Long Chen but couldn’t. If it were to strike these chains, it would only summon even greater karma, making things even worse for Long Chen.

The Heaven Earth Cauldron spun in the air, and an enormous whirlpool grew out of it, seemingly sucking in the very world. It was like watching the end of the world.

When the whirlpool tore the void apart, people could see the walls of the world. Those translucent barriers rumbled and creaked under the Heaven Earth Cauldron’s pull. At this moment, the energy of different laws started to enter this world.

“All three worlds’ laws have merged!”

At this moment, everyone could sense the auras of the Void Spirit World, Fantasy Spirit World, and Esoteric Spirit World merging into one. In other words, there were no longer any barriers between the three worlds.

To everyone’s astonishment, Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation had merged three worlds into one. Many of them were shocked, as well as jealous. They should have been the main characters of this world, but now they were relegated to the position of spectators. The pang of loss hit them hard, gnawing at their core.

With all three worlds merged together, their laws collided with such intensity. Everyone felt the discomfort as their auras were growing chaotic due to the merge.

Following that, countless cracks suddenly appeared throughout heaven and earth, terrifying everyone.

“Is the world going to explode?!”

“Just what kind of heavenly tribulation is this?! Is it trying to drag everyone in this world down with it?!” Cries of despair rang out.

“Don’t panic! This fellow can’t endure much longer! As long as he dies, everything will end.” A voice suddenly rang out, seemingly coming from an entirely different space.

This voice resonated with authority, cutting through the destructive sounds booming throughout the world.

Clearly, this voice came from a Sage King. However, no Sage King should exist within these three worlds.

“Who is there?!”

“It’s the gate to the ninth heaven!”

Startled cries rang out. When people looked at the gate, they saw that it was no longer blurry. It was in fact growing clearer and clearer that they could now see countless vague figures behind it.

Hearing the voice from the other side of the gate, Luo Changsheng excitedly cried out, “Patriarch, is that you?!”

“Child, you’ve done very well. Just a bit more and the gate will open. This is the critical juncture. Whoever breaks open this gate will become the chosen one,” replied the vague figure.

The Dragonblood warriors’ hearts shook, and Guo Ran’s expression darkened as he spoke. “So they already planned this out in advance!”

Yue Zifeng and the others were solemn when they sensed spiritual fluctuations coming out of the gate. The experts on the other side were clearly communicating with the people from their side.

Perhaps only a Sage King would be capable of sending messages through the gate. In other words, there were countless terrifying existences on the other side.

Moreover, it seemed that these terrifying existences were related to the people undergoing tribulation. If this gate opened, then... Guo Ran and the others didn’t even dare to think of the consequences.

BOOM!

Just then, the Heaven Earth Cauldron quivered, and everyone hastily turned their attention back to Long Chen.

“Boss!”

Witnessing the scene unfolding within the cauldron, the Dragonblood warriors’ eyes widened to the point of nearly bulging from their sockets.
