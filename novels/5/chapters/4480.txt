Chapter 4469 Slapping a Saint in the Face

Two enormous trees hung in the air, exuding a malevolent aura that tainted the entire world.

However, these trees weren’t tangible; they were manifestations behind two elders. Wielding emerald walking sticks, the two elders launched relentless attacks on the palace master.

Ye Ling’s fury exploded when she saw those two elders. In fact, she was so enraged that she was shaking.

“They’ve actually colluded with the Corrupt Blood Tree Demon race, aiming to completely destroy the foundation of my Earth Spirit race! No wonder I couldn’t sense the ancestral blessing upon my return!” Ye Ling gritted her teeth. It was Long Chen’s first time seeing her so agitated.

The Corrupt Blood Tree Demon was universally despised by countless races and deemed inherently malevolent. They liked destroying things, especially sacred lands. They would first infect their purity and transform that holy energy into fertilizer for themselves.

Seeing them, Ye Ling had a bad feeling. The Earth Spirit race’s ancestral land was very difficult to destroy, so temporarily losing that land hadn’t been a major concern for her.

However, the Corrupt Blood Tree Demon race posed a different threat. If they destroyed the foundation of the Earth Spirit race, it would be a nightmare for Ye Ling.

Amidst the turmoil, three additional Saints joined the siege against the palace master. Summoning his barbarian dragon manifestation, the palace master unleashed dragon claws that tore through the heavens, rending the fabric of the world. With every devastating punch and kick, his dragon blood energy erupted. Even one against five, the palace master didn’t appear to be at a disadvantage.

Finally, the palace master showed off his terrifying side. The barbarian dragon within his manifestation executed a relentless onslaught, its movements resembling a dance that conveyed a sense of limitless power as he battled against the five Saints.

The two enormous tree demons were constantly splashing black liquid onto the palace master’s manifestation. After that, his manifestation would light up, driving away this black liquid. Long Chen could see that this liquid possessed a terrifying corrosive effect, causing black spots to emerge in the surroundings of the palace master’s manifestation.

“Even a manifestation can be corrupted?” Long Chen was startled.

“That is the special divine ability of the Corrupt Blood Tree Demons. They’re extremely hateful and can corrupt everything in the world, whether it has form or not,” explained Ye Ling.

“Scram!”

Suddenly, the palace master roared, and with a single punch, he blew away the two old men. His fist then smashed toward one of those tree demons.

The palace master seethed with anger as these two were too hateful. They were constantly corroding his manifestation. Their incessant corrosion of his manifestation weakened its support, thereby diminishing his overall combat power.

They had just been fighting for a few minutes, but countless spots had appeared on the edges of the palace master’s manifestation. His power was clearly weakening. At this moment, he could only use ninety percent of his maximum power.

He felt a twinge of regret. He should have swiftly eliminated these two troublesome fellows upon entering. If he had dealt with them promptly, he could have relied on his own abilities to dispatch the other Saints without concern.

One of the tree demon Saints formed hand seals, creating eighteen muddy water shields in front of him. As they were blasted apart, rotten branches and leaves flew out of that muddy water, along with an incomparably repulsive stench that could make a person vomit with a mere whiff.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In an instant, the entire sky was filled with the air of decay. Despite being sent flying by the palace master’s punch, the tree demon remained unharmed after the impact had been softened by his shields.

“This barbarian dragon is only this strong. Today, I will corrode you into bones, and I’ll be absorbing your flesh for myself, hahaha!” That tree demon laughed arrogantly.

“Long Chen, what do we do? Their power counters mine, and we only have one chance for a sneak attack,” said Ye Ling frantically.

As a member of the Spirit race, her power relied on purity. Hence, if the Corrupt Blood Tree Demons corrupted her aura, her power would plummet as well.

Despite his inherent dark aura as a black barbarian dragon, even the palace master was not immune to their corruption. So, Ye Ling would be even more affected by them.

Moreover, she had just started recovering her Saint power and wasn’t at her peak yet. If corrupted, her realm would instantly plummet from the Saint realm. Therefore, she genuinely only had one chance to launch a sneak attack.

Long Chen understood. These two Corrupt Blood Tree Demons were a pain in the butt. Without their special divine ability, even facing them in a one-against-five scenario, the palace master would be able to beat them black and blue.

“You don’t need to join in. If I can’t endure, remember to save me,” said Long Chen.

“You…!”

Ye Ling was startled. She didn’t know what Long Chen was planning on doing, but he suddenly charged toward one of those Corrupt Blood Tree Demons with his Kunpeng wings.

The instant he joined the battlefield, a terrifying pressure struck him, almost crushing him.

This was the power of Saints. Without being one as well, an individual wouldn’t even have the power to stand against them. Hence, the moment Long Chen entered this region, it was like he had become a mortal again, the pressure almost shattering his bones.

It was at this point that Long Chen truly comprehended the formidable nature of a Saint. The disparity between him and a Saint was immense.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen didn’t bother concealing himself. If he didn’t unleash his full power now, he wouldn’t be able to reach the center of the battlefield. If that happened, his sneak-attack plan would instantly crumble.

“Where did this ant come from? Scram!”

Too focused on the palace master, the Corrupt Blood Tree Demons truly didn’t take note of where Long Chen had come from. But the moment Long Chen summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor, he drew their attention.

A wooden spear shot toward Long Chen like a bolt of lightning, and violent killing intent instantly locked onto him.

Seeing this attack, Long Chen let out a shout and sent a seven-color sword to intercept it. Then the sword exploded upon contact with the wooden spear, unable to endure a single blow from it.

However, that was within Long Chen’s expectations. The moment he stepped onto the battlefield, he already knew the difference between him and a Saint. He wasn’t so arrogant as to believe that he could block the full-power attack of a Saint.

The wooden spear’s path was deviated by the Seven Peak Sword, and it flew past Long Chen.

“Oh?” That Corrupt Blood Tree Demon was startled, not expecting Long Chen to deflect his attack.

Most importantly, his attack had locked onto Long Chen, but the timing and angle of Long Chen’s counterattack were perfect. This caused the lock on him to temporarily lose its effect, and that split-second was just enough to make the attack miss.

Just as the Corrupt Blood Tree Demon was startled, Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings flapped, and he shot toward the elder, sending a kick at the elder’s face.

“Brat, you’re asking for it!” The Corrupt Blood Tree Demon was incensed, revealing fingers like claws that were grabbing for Long Chen’s foot.

However, to his surprise, Long Chen’s attack turned out to be a feint, and the elder’s hand closed on nothing but thin air. At that moment, a hand viciously slapped him across the face from an inconceivable angle.
