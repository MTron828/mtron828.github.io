Chapter 4278: Taking Back What Is Mine

A golden dragon claw then pierced Long Aotian’s chest, while he just foolishly stood there, not even able to move. It was like his soul had been extracted.

“Did you think that I didn’t know you were holding back? When I was going to kill you, you clearly still had the power to fight, but you chose to give up. I knew you were holding back so that others could create a better opportunity for you. You aren’t a match for me, so you could only hope for others to exhaust me first before you attack. That would be your only chance to kill me, and I have also been waiting for this chance as well to tell the truth. If I had chased you back then, my chances of killing you would have been very low because of the Long clan’s interference. But as usual, you have never disappointed me,” explained Long Chen, a sinister smile appearing on his face.

Suddenly, Long Chen pulled his hand from Long Aotian’s chest, holding a bone within his grasp. Multicolored light then began to flow on the surface of this bone. It was only the size of a thumb, but it illuminated the world in its light.

“Supreme Bone!”

That tiny bone actually caused the entire world to change.

Just then, the Blood race expert recovered from his moment of shock and attacked Long Chen once more.

“Three Flower Deathblow!”

.

Long Chen closed one eye, while the other displayed three spinning flowers. In the air, a three-flower diagram materialized, ensnaring the half-step Eternal expert within it. After that, the three flowers entwined and the surrounding space contorted.

That Blood expert was instantly killed by the three flowers, shocking everyone. They hadn’t expected Long Chen to have such terrifying pupil arts, capable of one-shotting a half-step Eternal.

Blood flowed out of Long Chen’s eye. The attack of the Purgatory Eyes was terrifying, yet the backlash was equally dreadful.

However, Long Chen didn’t mind. He returned his attention to Long Aotian while still wearing his sinister smile. “Back in the underground tomb, you had lost to this move, and now you still fell for it. In terms of power, you aren’t a match for me, while in terms of intelligence, you can’t even compete. What qualifications do you have to take what is mine?”

Long Aotian was quivering, clearly terrified. However, he still wasn’t moving. The onlookers then noticed that at some point, a three flower diagram had manifested in his pupils as well.

Only then did everyone grasp the situation. It seemed that the moment Long Aotian attacked, he was struck by Long Chen’s pupil art, rendering him paralyzed.

Blood was still pouring out of Long Aotian’s chest, and his face was covered in fear. It seemed that he was struggling, but his body wasn’t listening to him.

“Long Chen, release Aotian. We’re all members of the Long clan. We can talk about this.” Finally, the Long clan’s Grand Elder spoke.

Following that, the Eighth Elder appeared beside him. Although he had survived, his face was as pale as paper, filled with intense hatred. Long Chen’s attack had actually damaged part of his cultivation base, causing him to drop from an innate Heaven Venerate to an Earth Venerate. He cried out furiously, “Long Chen, release him! Don’t forget that your father is in our hands! If you kill Aotian-!”

Pfft!

Long Chen furiously clenched Long Aotian’s neck, raising him in the air. His face twisted savagely.

“You dare to threaten me with my father? If anything happens to him, I will slaughter the Long clan until no one remains!”

Suddenly, Long Aotian’s body stiffened, and countless fluctuations flowed out of his body into Long Chen.

“Long Chen, you are courting death!” roared the Eighth Elder.

“Long Chen, can we really not talk about it? By doing this, you are making the situation worse,” advised the Grand Elder earnestly.

“There is no room to talk about this. This talent was a gift from my parents, so everything he stole belonged to me from the beginning. I'm merely taking back what’s rightfully mine. What do you have to say about that??” raged Long Chen.

“I…” The Grand Elder was at a loss for words.

“Long Chen, if you dare to kill Long Aotian, just wait! You will regret it!” shouted the Eighth Elder.

“Die!”

Long Chen suddenly opened his injured eye once more. Seeing this, the Grand Elder was horrified and hastily shoved the space in front of him.

Unfortunately, he was one step too slow. The space around the Eighth Elder already twisted, crushing him to death.

To kill someone from such a distance, without them even sensing it, this scene left the Long clan's experts utterly silenced in terror.

The Grand Elder couldn’t help but sigh. In the end, he was still helpless to do anything. He knew that Long Aotian was definitely dead now.

Suddenly, Long Chen released his hand, and Long Aotian fell like a dead fish. The three flowers in his eyes were gone, replaced by a bewildered look.

Long Aotian no longer had any of his former arrogance. His aura was incredibly weak, even weaker than that of a Divine Flame disciple.

Contrary to everyone’s expectation, Long Chen left him alive. “I won’t kill you. I disdain killing you. You are now a cripple, and I want to see how you will live in the Long clan. What kind of revenge will the people you bullied take on you now that you’ve lost your identity as a peerless heavenly genius?”

Suddenly, space twisted and Long Aotian vanished, reappearing in front of the Grand Elder.

“Take your people. Look after him and make sure to look after his mental health. Don’t let him kill himself.”

The Grand Elder caught Long Aotian and sighed. His Spirit Root, Spirit Blood, and Spirit Bone were all gone.

As a result, Long Aotian's physical body would slowly wither. He was fully crippled. Even with all the Long clan’s abilities, they couldn’t save him.

Even if they paid a huge price, he would still be crippled. Most importantly, even after all those efforts, he would only live for at most a few months.

By not killing him, Long Chen tortured him even more than killing him would. A peerless heavenly genius had fallen from the peak of the heavens into the depths of hell. That kind of disparity would make him live a life worse than death.

“Even if you take his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, so what? They’ve been apart from you for so many years. You can’t even use them. I refuse to believe that you can have them support you.”

Lian Wuying appeared, rushing at Long Chen with her manifestation at full power. A five-color seed pod then appeared in her hand, and specks of divine light flowed around it. To everyone’s surprise, Lian Wuying’s power still seemed to be at its peak. She had actually been holding back as well.

Looking at her rushing figure, Long Chen simply extended a hand, and a seven-colored sword appeared in his hand. It was Long Aotian’s Seven Peak Sword.

At the same time, the seven-colored divine ring behind Long Chen blazed with power, and the image of a sun and a moon appeared behind him. The sword in his hand then rumbled, and a ray of Sword Qi rose into the heavens and slashed down. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
