Chapter 2620 Dragon Breaking Claw

Two figures soared up into the sky and smashed into each other, unleashing a heaven-shaking explosion.

As a result, the black clouds covering the sky were blasted away, and then a blinding light made everyone turn away.

It was the sunlight that had not been seen on the Martial Heaven Continent in a long time. Ever since the dark era had begun, the Martial Heaven Continent had been covered in black clouds, turning the world into endless dusk with no night or day.

With one punch from Long Chen and the dragon woman, the layer of black clouds was destroyed, revealing the blazing sun. The warmth that they had missed for a long time entered their hearts once more.

Long Chen and the dragon woman stared at each other beneath this blazing sun. From the ground, the others could see the two of them with the sun as background, their auras both climbing. Even the sun became illusory in the twisted space around them.

“I’ll give you one last chance. Hand over the essence blood!” shouted the dragon woman.

Long Chen’s gaze gradually grew colder. His killing intent was no longer just from his own anger but also being summoned from his blood. The true dragon essence blood in his veins would not permit that he suffered such a humiliation.

As for this foolish woman, she had yet to realize that her actions were causing the will of the true dragon inside of him to slowly rise.

“Long Chen, control yourself! Revealing your trump cards for this woman is completely worthless! Those four fellows might be allied with you for now, but they aren’t really on your side!” warned Evilmoon.

Long Chen didn’t need Evilmoon’s reminder to know that the divine families could not be trusted, especially with Long Aotian and the others’ current actions. They were just standing there with no intention of helping.

However, this woman made it so that he couldn’t control his anger. On the other hand, the dragon woman’s fury also rose when Long Chen refused to respond to her. She then sent a claw toward Long Chen.

Space was instantly torn apart. Her hand had transformed into a claw at some point without him being aware. At the same time, Long Chen hastily blocked, only for a sharp pain to be transmitted from his fist. Fresh blood then dripped down his hand. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen’s fist was hard enough to block divine items, but it was unable to block her dragon claw.

The dragon woman licked his blood off of her claw, smiling in rapture. However, in Long Chen’s eyes, that was exceedingly insulting. His blood began to rumble as if it were about to explode.

“Since you refuse to hand over the essence blood, I’ll have to take it myself.” The dragon woman once more attacked. Both her claws were now falling, reaching toward him.

Long Chen’s foot suddenly swung toward her abdomen. Looking at his attack, the dragon woman sneered and sent one claw toward Long Chen’s face and another toward his chest. Neither of her moves was defensive.

“You’re playing this game with the human race? Do you know how foolish you are?” Long Chen sneered. His foot suddenly turned, striking her claw.

BANG!

Astral winds exploded and sparks flew. Long Chen’s scales were broken due to just how sharp her claws were, but they were unable to penetrate any deeper.

However, Long Chen didn’t care about that injury. At this moment, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her arm.

Just like that, the dragon woman’s arm cracked. He had exchanged injury for injury.

As a result, the dragon woman’s expression changed. Her other hand reached toward Long Chen’s neck, trying to force him to retreat. Long Chen did retreat, but he didn’t let go.

In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Chen pulled her arm off from her shoulder, unleashing a spray of blood.

“How vicious!”

Long Chen tossed the arm to the Dragonblood Legion. As it fell, it transformed into a giant dragon claw.

Wilde immediately let out a delighted cry and grabbed it, immediately starting to munch on it.

“AHH!” The dragon woman let out a terrible shriek, part pain and part fury. Her arm quickly grew back. After that, her horns lit up, and a black ripple spread.

“This dragon woman has gone crazy! She’s using her core essence blood!” shouted Evilmoon.

A bone whip suddenly appeared in her hand, looking like a pitch-black dragon’s spine. As she wielded it, a horrible aura filled the world, one that made everyone feel like an ancient beast had suddenly emerged.

“Die!”

She furiously swung her whip at Long Chen. Thousands of whip-images filled the air, leaving him with nowhere to run.

Long Chen didn’t dare to block it with his bare hands because it gave him a hair-raising feeling. Therefore, he summoned Evilmoon in his hand.

Explosions rang out as Evilmoon repeatedly met with the dragon bone whip, and intense light filled the sky.

BOOM!

The whip-images vanished, revealing Long Chen with blazing killing intent and Evilmoon with black qi swirling around it.

At this moment, Evilmoon was in the Heavens’ Wrath state, looking as if a fiend that had been sealed for millions of years had been unleashed.

“Dark evil dragon!”

The dragon woman’s expression changed because she recognized this aura.

She was familiar with Evilmoon’s aura because the black dragon race was close to the evil dragon race. As a matter of fact, she was from the emperor race of the black dragons, just like the dark evil dragon was the emperor of the evil dragons.

For this reason, she was especially shocked. Long Chen had not only obtained the approval of the true dragon, but he even had a divine weapon created from the dark evil dragon’s bone, blood, and soul?

“Girl, if you’re smart, you’ll leave immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for starting a slaughter,” said Evilmoon coldly.

Evilmoon’s name was famous on the Martial Heaven Continent. But they only viewed it as a terrifying evil weapon that Long Chen had subdued.

It rarely spoke out loud to others. Hence, when its sinister, dark, berserk, and bloodthirsty voice rang out, even the people on Long Chen’s side felt like hell had suddenly manifested in the world. Their bodies grew ice-cold.

“As the emperor of the evil dragon race, you are willing to be used by the human race? What happened to your dignity?!” roared the dragon woman.
