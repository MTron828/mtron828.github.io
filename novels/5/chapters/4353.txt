Chapter 4342 Finally Here

“Isn’t that the gate to the humanless world?!”

As the enormous gate slowly opened, people saw a group of figures inside it. However, upon closer inspection, even Yue Zifeng and the others were struck dumb.

“No, it’s not a gate! It’s a mirror!”

Within this gate, they saw a world that was an exact duplicate of their own. Inside that mirrored world, they could see Yue Zifeng, Gu Yang, and all the other members of the Dragonblood Legion. It seemed that every individual here was replicated within this surreal reflection.

“It’s not a mirror! It’s a replication formed by the Heavenly Daos. This is their heavenly tribulation!” exclaimed an elder.

“Kill!”

Suddenly, Gu Yang and others from the mirror world roared. With a torrent of killing intent, they charged through the gate.

The disciples of the Battle God Palace, High Firmament Academy, and Starry River Sect had never seen such a thing before. Seeing copies of themselves, they were stunned.

“It’s nothing more than a copy from the Heavenly Daos. Fight!” Gu Yang led the charge against his own copy. This scene was not unfamiliar to the Dragonblood Legion, and they met it with unwavering battle intent.

“DIE!”

Both Gu Yangs let out thunderous roars, launching identical techniques with matching weapons. It was like two mirrored figures colliding in an intense clash.

BOOM!

A giant black hole exploded into the void, resembling the mouth of a monster that wanted to devour this world.

Gu Yang's arms trembled as blood seeped from his wounded hands. His duplicate's power proved to be no less formidable than his own.

Just then, the heavens split open, and everyone in the heavenly tribulation felt a sharp pain in their souls. When they looked up, they could see Sword Qi tearing through the void and actually encapsulating all of them.

In response to this, Yue Zifeng unsheathed his sword. His Sword Qi cleaved through the void, and the two Sword Qis collided, causing the tribulation clouds to shatter before gradually mending once more.

“Find your own opponents! Don’t mix them up!”

At this time, the disciples of the High Firmament Academy, Battle God Palace, and Starry River Sect were in a mess. They had never confronted a heavenly tribulation like this and were uncertain of how to respond. The sight of their duplicates launching an assault against them left them in a state of panic.

Just then, multicolored divine radiance illuminated the void, and a terrifying flame rose.

“It’s the Heavenly Rainbow Flame!”

Yu Qingxuan’s copy appeared and formed hand seals. The next moment, her rainbow divine radiance raged, seemingly about to ignite the very world.

“Heavenly Rainbow Slash!”

Seeing this move, the real Yu Qingxuan was shocked. It was a divine ability she had recently gained insight into and had never used before. But astonishingly, the Heavenly Daos managed to replicate it. If she allowed this move to be unleashed, the consequences would be unthinkable.

BOOM!

A rainbow light flew out of her duplicate’s hand. However, before that rainbow divine radiance could fully gather, Yu Qingxuan pierced it through, and it exploded like a firework.

“Don’t touch the sparks!” warned Yu Qingxuan.

With that warning, the others hastily got out of the way. When the fiery sparks landed on the ground, they scorched deep, leaving behind bottomless pits that continued to burn with searing intensity

Suddenly, the land exploded and two earthen giants rose as if enraged by the sparks, towering high into the clouds.

“Not good!”

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s expressions changed upon seeing those earth giants. Their duplicates had made the first move and sucked away the earth’s power, leaving none for them to use.

They had never dreamed that the heavenly tribulation would be able to replicate all of their techniques. Furthermore, without any hesitation, these duplicates unleashed their strongest trump cards as soon as they appeared.

“Metal power, peak of the Heavens, born of the great earth…”

Two Bai Shishis chanted in unison and formed hand seals at the same pace.

“... Golden Lotus Buries Heaven and Earth!”

The moment the final syllable left their lips, two holy golden lotus platforms broke the surface of the earth, causing the world to shudder as if the ten thousand Daos were weeping. Those two enormous lotus platforms then flashed with divine light and smashed toward each other like two shooting stars.

As this scene unfolded, countless people let out cries of shock and fear. The sharp metal energy contained within the two lotus platforms sent a chill down the spines of even the half-step Eternals. This force was not something that they could receive.

Furthermore, this was the result after the world’s metal energy was split between the two of them. What would happen if the metal energy was concentrated in one attack?

BOOM!

In front of everyone’s horrified gaze, the two golden lotus platforms collided with a resounding impact. Countless beams of golden light then illuminated the heavens, causing even the stars in the sky to tremble.

As a blinding flash engulfed everyone's vision, the shockwaves blew apart the earth giants situated near the epicenter of the collision. The clumps of earth then flew through the air and transformed into lightning runes.

“Many thanks!”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan delightedly charged toward those lightning runes. As soon as they got close, they instantly absorbed the runes, and their auras rose tremendously.

BOOM!

However, before they could feel too delighted, an earth giant deployed by their duplicates struck both of them with a massive pillar. Despite their combined effort to defend, they were still sent flying. It turned out that their duplicates had merged into the foreheads of two earth giants and came after the two of them.

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan had lost the initiative and were unable to summon any earth giant. As a result, they could only rely on their divine weapons and powerful physical bodies to fight their duplicates. Just like that, two earth giants attacked ferociously, repeatedly driving them backward. There were several instances when the two of them came dangerously close to being flattened.

The other experts undergoing tribulation were in no better position. Guo Ran was attacked by an armored monstrosity and was constantly fleeing, refusing to face his copy head on.

However, Guo Ran had the upper hand. In each clash, some lightning runes would shed from that armored monstrosity, and Guo Ran immediately absorbed them. If this continued, he would definitely win.

Meanwhile, Xia Chen faced a more challenging situation. With a wave of his hand, his duplicate summoned so many talismans that they filled the sky, and every single one of them was capable of crushing the void. As a result, Xia Chen didn’t dare to receive them directly and could only face them with his own talismans.

The most hateful thing was that his duplicate seemed to have limitless talismans, while he was losing talismans at a painful rate. These were trump cards that he was unwilling to reveal, but now he was forced to. His heart was dripping blood. Even if he could pass this tribulation, he would be broke.

The Dragonblood Legion descended into a bitter battle, and the other experts were also caught in dire straits. Their duplicates seemed to have limitless power, while they were pushing themselves through their limits. Their defeat seemed inevitable.

Buzz.

Just then, furious roars rang out in the distance, causing a commotion among the crowd. A group of lifeforms breached their encirclement and surged forward.

“They’re finally here.” A cold smile appeared on Long Chen’s face.
