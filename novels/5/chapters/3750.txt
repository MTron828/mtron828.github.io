Chapter 3739 Borrowing Power to Fight

“What?!”

Long Chen was shocked, unable to believe what he was hearing.

“Those experts of the Sacred Pill Hall that I killed had their faith energy dissipate back into heaven and earth. This person is the heir to this faith energy and is now utilizing it. Do you think you can beat the combined faith energy of over forty million experts?” The white-robed woman’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s head again.

Long Chen now understood how Yin Changsheng was so powerful. This wasn’t his own power, so Long Chen felt better now.

“Most importantly, before all of the faith energy of those forty million experts is used up, it will be very difficult for you to actually harm his body. His faith energy is protecting him, and now his power is probably not inferior to those three Divine Venerates outside. It is meaningless for you to fight him directly,” said the white-robed woman.

With that, Long Chen no longer cared to fight. Otherwise, he would definitely decide who was stronger today.

“The current you is not a match for him.” However, then the white-robed woman added another line.

That resulted in Long Chen’s anger being ignited once more. “Isn’t that all thanks to you?! You injured me in a way that I cannot instantly recover from. Otherwise, how would I be at a disadvantage even with his faith energy?!”

If she hadn’t mentioned this, he wouldn’t have brought it up. But now he was enraged. Long Chen had wanted to save her, and Huo Linger was a flame spirit just like her. Supposedly, they were on the same side, so he hadn’t been on guard against her.

It was precisely due to this that when the white-robed woman unleashed her Ice Soul energy, he was severely injured. His physical and spiritual bodies were badly damaged. Even with the primal chaos space’s energy, he wasn’t able to instantly heal.

If his power wasn’t reduced due to this injury, even with this faith energy, Yin Changsheng would not be able to make Long Chen cough up blood from that attack. This all started with Long Chen being injured by her. For her to unashamedly say that he wasn’t a match for her, Long Chen was naturally enraged.

The white-robed woman fell silent. She gathered the foundation stones that Long Chen had gathered into a special formation. She then sat lotus style, holding the listless Huo Linger as well. The two of them began absorbing the energy of the foundation stones to recover. She actually began to ignore Long Chen.

Just then, a heaven-shaking spear once more pierced toward Long Chen. As for the flame qilin, it was at the rear to Long Chen’s left. It opened its mouth, unleashing a flame sword at Long Chen. Its explosive power compressed space to the point where it felt like the world almost exploded.

The flame qilin was quite intelligent. Its attack was intentionally one step slower than Yin Changsheng’s, and at a difficult angle to block. At most, Long Chen would only be able to dodge one of these two attacks.

If Long Chen dodged the first, he would definitely be struck by the second, and the first attacker would then have time to attack again.

Furthermore, after blocking one, Long Chen would definitely have no time to properly block the next attack. Hastily blocking would definitely put him at a disadvantage. Together, this beast-and-man combo was working seamlessly.

Suddenly, Long Chen began to chant, and a sacred scripture rang out. Long Chen’s sword met Yin Changsheng’s spear once more, and Yin Changsheng was shocked to find that his spear’s power was being drawn to the side.

BOOM!

Yin Changsheng’s spear directly smashed into his flame qilin’s attack.

“Get out of the way!” shouted Yin Changsheng. Long Chen’s True Fire Sword was attached to Yin Changsheng’s spear now, and together, they pointed toward the flame qilin. A terrifying ray of divine light then shot out of the spear head.

Seeing this, the flame qilin howled. Its body was directly pierced through, and blood sprayed out of it. Its body then flew into the distance.

“You!” Yin Changsheng’s fury exploded. His flame qilin was severely wounded, perhaps even dead.

However, before he could even do anything, Long Chen’s hand slapped him in the face. Yin Changsheng was sent flying along with his spear.

Hundreds of Supreme experts were rushing. Just then, Yin Changsheng blasted into their midst, startling them. They hastily got out of the way.

“Split the Heavens 3!”

A giant saber-image tore through this underground world, slashing toward Yin Changsheng. The timing of this attack was perfect, striking just as Yin Changsheng had yet to stabilize himself. As for the others, they were getting out of his way. This attack from Long Chen contained his undefeatable will, forcing even hundreds of Supreme heavenly geniuses to scatter in trepidation.

BOOM!

Heaven and earth were cleaved apart. When the underground world collapsed, fragments of the glacier flew out along with the Supreme heavenly geniuses.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The saber-image continued to push through the ground, so the earth continued to be cleaved apart. Right in front of the saber-image, Yin Changsheng was roaring and blocking it with his spear. He was pushed back hundreds of miles before he managed to stabilize. After that, with a swing of his spear, the saber-image was shattered.

“Long Chen!”

Yin Changsheng roared furiously. He shot back to the core of the battlefield because Long Chen was now standing right at the core, lightning flowing around him. Long Chen was looking down on him disdainfully.

“What dogshit Changsheng? Even with faith energy, you are only at this level. Since these three fellows are here, I’ll take your little life another day.”

Long Chen’s figure suddenly shook, and he rushed out into the distance. His speed was astounding.

“You think you can flee?! Keep dreaming!”

Just then, the three Divine Venerates in the air snorted. One of them moved to block Long Chen.

All of a sudden, in the opposite direction, a ray of light shot out. Its speed was even greater.

“That’s the real one!” The white-haired elder and the other Divine Venerate immediately attacked at the same time. Long Chen was going precisely between the two of them. Afraid that one person might not be enough, they both moved to stop him.

However, at that moment, the earth erupted and a third Long Chen appeared. Everyone’s expression changed.

“Idiots. I’m the real one. This was a good first meeting. Let us meet again. But next time, I’ll be taking your corpses.”

Long Chen sneered and waved the talisman in his hand. He then vanished.

Just as he did, a ray of sword-light slashed down where he was. Fragments of spacetime flew about.

Regretfully, the white-haired elder’s attack landed on nothing. Long Chen was already gone.

Two more explosions rang out. The first Long Chen to appear transformed into lightning runes that dissipated, and the second Long Chen transformed into a bloodied talisman.

The first Long Chen was a lightning clone, while the other was a substitute talisman. The lightning clone had his aura, making it indistinguishable, while the talisman had his essence blood attached to it, making it also indistinguishable.

As a result, even surrounded by hundreds of Supreme heavenly geniuses and three Divine Venerates, Long Chen easily escaped.

“Long Chen, I’ll tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces!”

Long Chen vanished, leaving no trace of himself. Seeing this, Yin Changsheng roared furiously. His wild killing intent caused the wind and clouds to change color.
