Chapter 1943: 1943

“Not good, it’s a twelfth rank Magical Beast! Quick, activate the formation!” shouted a Life Star expert of the original devil race . When a powerful twelfth rank Magical Beasts appeared, the disciples would lead them here and kill them with the formations .

“No need . Using your formation will waste more spirit crystals than that Magical Beast is worth . ” Xia Chen shook his head .

Guo Ran had summoned his golden armor . Transforming into a golden shooting star, he shot toward the Magical Beast

“A little twelfth rank Magical Beast also dares to get arrogant?”

Guo Ran unleashed a giant saber-image at the Magical Beast .

There were seven disciples of the original devil race fleeing . They were originally ten, but three of them had been slain by that Magical Beast . 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Magical Beast was a white rhinoceros, and it was like a galloping mountain . The ground rumbled and ruptured because of it .

Guo Ran’s saber ruthlessly slashed into its head . A powerful shockwave spread, and the rhinoceros was sent flipping through the air .

However, Guo Ran also suffered . He was knocked back into the distance .

The rhinoceros let out a furious roar . Its horn suddenly lit up, and a white light shot at Guo Ran .

“Guo Ran’s about to suffer . ” Long Chen’s lips curled as he watched Guo Ran go all-out to block .

The white light passed straight through Guo Ran . A layer of white rock had covered him as he had been turned to stone . He was still in his defensive posture .

After landing this attack, the rhinoceros charged toward Guo Ran to smash him apart .

However, a flash of sword-light swept through its neck . Its head went flying, and blood soaked the earth .

Yue Zifeng slowly sheathed his sword . After advancing to the Life Star realm, his attacks were even sharper and faster . He could one-shot a twelfth rank Magical Beast .

Cracking sounds rang out . Guo Ran was still floating in the air as if he had been fixed there . His statue was shaking, and faint cracks spread along it . Eventually, the layer of stone on him blew apart .

“What happened?” asked Guo Ran in confusion .

“You don’t feel shame asking? That white rhinoceros was a Full Moon Stone Rhinoceros, and its divine ability is able to transform its enemies to stone . Even if you didn’t recognize it, how could you not sense those spatial fluctuations? You just took its petrification ray head-on . If you were alone, you would have been smashed apart,” scolded Long Chen .

“Sorry boss, I got a bit arrogant . ” Guo Ran was ashamed . After advancing to the Life Star realm, he felt twelfth rank Magical Beasts to be beneath him, and he thought that he could crush it with pure power .

Although Long Chen usually didn’t bother with everyone’s fighting styles, he was very strict with their battle attitude . They could not get careless . That could be a fatal mistake, so Guo Ran hastily admitted his mistake .

Long Chen snorted and didn’t say anything else . Such a low level mistake was truly a bit infuriating, but he couldn’t criticize Guo Ran too harshly . He reached out and tossed the white rhinoceros’s corpse into the primal chaos space .

The black soil devoured the corpse, unleashing plentiful life energy that nourished the withered World Trees .

However, a single twelfth rank Magical Beast’s corpse wasn’t enough to cause too much of a change .

The seven disciples immediately thanked Long Chen and the others upon being saved . Yue Xiaoqian asked them how they had encountered a twelfth rank Magical Beast . It had to be known that it had been a long time since they had seen a twelfth rank Magical Beast in this region .

There had been twelfth rank Magical Beasts before, but they had been slain by the Elders of the formations . Now that twelfth rank Magical Beasts weren’t seen very often, the original devil race had begun spreading and exploring more of this world .

“Reporting to the sacred daughter, we met with a sudden attack twenty-one thousand miles southwest of the seventh transportation formation,” answered one of the disciples .

The original devil race had set this place as a base as they explored further . In the relatively safer places, they had established some small transportation formations . That saved them quite a bit of time .

Using the channel as the base, they searched further and further . This squad of disciples had been searching unknown territory beyond the seventh transportation formation .

“Let’s go take a look . ”

Long Chen and the others stepped onto the transportation formation . However, it wasn’t a large formation, so it could only fit five hundred of them at once . They would have to go in batches .

The formation runes lit up, and Long Chen found himself standing atop a mountain . This transportation formation was situated in a mountain range .

Once they were there, Cloud transformed into her true form and brought them flying away .

As soon as Cloud started flying, they were unable to see anything clearly . Cloud was too fast, and their vision was unable to track anything . They could only use their divine sense .

Having advanced to the eleventh rank, Cloud had grown larger, and her body now emitted a primordial aura . This advancement had greatly increased her power .

Before this, she had only been able to refine a portion of the Blue Eye Peacock’s essence blood . The majority of it had been sealed and stored inside her body . After advancing, she had managed to refine and absorb that stored energy .

In the blink of an eye, Cloud appeared at the location that had been specified . Here there was a lake .

Cloud returned to human form . Yue Xiaoqian looked at the marks on the ground and said, “This is definitely where they encountered the Magical Beast .

“This lake’s fluctuations are a bit strange . Let’s go take a look,” said Long Chen . They had just approached the lake when the earth split open . A ferocious mouth flew up at them .

However, that mouth had just opened when Liu Ruyan waved her hand . Branches shot out, binding the mouth tight .

“What a big serpent!” exclaimed Guo Ran . This serpent had some strange bark-like patterns on its head . Half its body was still hidden in the ground .

“Get out here!” Liu Ruyan pulled and the earth shuddered . The ground split open, and a giant Magical Beast was pulled out .

“What is this thing?!”

Startled cries rang out . Originally they had thought that it was a serpent, but it was actually a giant tortoise with a snake-like head .

Suddenly, its shell lit up, and rays of divine light shot out like heavenly swords . Their hair stood on end .

Long Chen shot into action, smashing the giant shell with his fist . The shell was blown apart, and the rays of light crumbled .

This strange tortoise actually died from having its shell broken . Long Chen tossed it into the primal chaos space .

This tortoise wasn’t that far from where the white rhinoceros had been . For two twelfth rank Magical Beasts to be so close to each other was definitely not ordinary .

This made Long Chen think of the circular mountain range in the Yin Yang World where many Magical Beasts had gathered . Little Snow was currently being nourished in the egg at the center of that mountain range .

“This might be a land of treasures . Everyone, be careful . Guo Ran, you lead the way,” said Long Chen .

Guo Ran jumped, thinking that he was being punished . “Boss, I was wrong...”

“Stop messing around . You’re the one with the best luck, so if you lead, we should find the treasures faster,” interrupted Long Chen .

If Long Chen was the one leading the way, they would definitely run into trouble . Hearing that he was taking the lead because of his luck, Guo Ran immediately swaggered to the front .

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, Guo Ran didn’t encounter any problems . They bypassed a twelfth rank Magical Beast and it didn’t attack them . It seemed to be slumbering .

Long Chen was speechless . The existence known as luck was truly difficult to explain, but Guo Ran was leading them through a peaceful path .

They quickly arrived at the edge of the lake . Yue Xiaoqian bent down and touched the water with her hand . After sensing it for a moment, she said, “This water really is strange . There are some fluctuations of divine energy . It’s very gentle and can be directly absorbed by the body . However, I don’t know why this is the case . ”

Even the erudite Yue Xiaoqian wasn’t sure of what was going on . Long Chen scooped out a bit of the water and sniffed it . He then tasted it .

“This water contains a kind of mineral . If it is consumed over a long time, it can strengthen the bones and flesh . However, there are too many impurities, and it is not suitable for human bodies . It seems these twelfth rank Magical Beasts are here because of the water . Maybe the reason why they were able to advance to the twelfth rank is because of this water . So these surrounding Magical Beasts aren’t here to attack the Skyscraping World . They’re defending their own territories around this lake . What we should do is investigate this lake’s secrets . After all, this water is useless to us,” said Long Chen . He turned to Guo Ran .

“Boss, just tell me what you need and I’ll do it! I won’t shirk from a mountain of blades or a path of flames!” guaranteed Guo Ran .

“Alright then . Put on your armor . ”

Immediately, Guo Ran regretted his words . He had a bad feeling, but he had said his big words .

Guo Ran had only just put on his armor when Long Chen kicked him in the butt, sending him flying out .

Like a skipping stone, Guo Ran bounced across the lake, eventually plummeting into the water .

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!” Meng Qi and the others cried out in shock .

“It’s fine . I’m just testing his luck . If his luck is really good, just this kick of mine should settle things,” said Long Chen with a chortle .

Suddenly, a golden light flew out, and Guo Ran was now holding a golden rock . He excitedly cried out, “Boss, I found the treasure!”

Everyone became petrified . So even this method could work?
