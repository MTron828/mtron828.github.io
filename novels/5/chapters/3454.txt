Chapter 3443 A Strong Return

The devil’s corpse split in two. For a moment, everyone was simply stunned.

They looked behind the elder as a black-robed figure with a huge sword sheath had appeared there. He was holding a blood-red saber.

“You are… Dean Long Chen?”

Long Chen’s name had long since spread as the youngest-ever dean of the High Firmament Academy. Hence, cheers rang out from the countless experts of the Yaohua Prefecture.

Just then, a furious roar rang out, and more devils in the distance flooded over them from all directions. There were three devils with red scales leading a new army to this place.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Not good! Dean Long Chen, follow us back into the city! We’ll use the formation to stop them!” said the elder.

“Everyone, please retreat into the city. This junior will embarrass himself here,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen then raised his left hand and a flame lotus appeared. After that, flames were summoned from every corner of the world, and the lotus instantly grew to an enormous size. A terrifying pressure crashed down, twisting heaven and earth.

The elder was pleasantly surprised. Not wasting any more time on courteous words, he directly ordered the experts fighting to crush their jade talismans. They were all transported into the city.

Just then, the three devil generals charged over and Long Chen shouted, “World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

The flame lotus fell, exploding amongst the army of devils. As a result, a giant mushroom cloud soared into the air. At the same time, a ripple spread on the ground.

It was a wave of fire that washed across the entire devil army. Now, only the three leaders remained on the ground. Their whole bodies were black and they were on their last breaths.

It was a thunderous and domineering move that made the experts watching feel fired up.

“Senior’s sword isn’t sharp enough. I hope that this sword can help you.”

Long Chen’s voice was ringing out from the distance. After that, a cold light flew through the air, piercing through the three devil generals’ heads and killing them before flying toward that elder’s hand.

It was a sheathed sword. That meant Long Chen had killed those devils with just the sheath. It had to be known that those devils had almost no weaknesses because their only vital part was their heads. Furthermore, their skulls were shockingly tough, and even King items couldn’t break through them. That was why so many of them were unable to stop a single half-step World King devil that had almost no divine abilities.

The elder then pulled out a few inches of the sword. The sharpness that suddenly came piercing out made his soul shiver.

“What a treasure!”

Countless startled cries rang out. That sword’s runes hadn’t even been activated, but it was already leaking such a sharp air. It was definitely a top tier sword.

“Dean Long Chen actually gave us this sword.” The elder was extremely moved. With this weapon, they shouldn’t need to fear similar red-scaled devils.

Suddenly, the elder shouted, “Dean Long Chen, after this tribulation, I, Zhao Yixiang, will personally return this to you!”

“This treasure blade needs a good master. Senior was willing to sacrifice his life for the people, so only a divine weapon of this caliber can match your character.”

Long Chen’s voice rang out once more, but it came from so far away that it was a bit indistinct.

“Dean Long Chen is so young but already has such power. He even cares for the common people. Just how many generations has it been since such a figure has appeared in the human race?” sighed an Earth tier Immortal King.

Looking at the ruins outside the city to the three corpses of the red-scaled devils, everyone in the city had worshipful expressions.

He had such power but was not arrogantly aloof. Moreover, Long Chen didn’t just save them from their present predicament, but he even bestowed them with a divine weapon to protect themselves. Thus, all of them were completely won over.

At the same time, they felt even greater admiration for the High Firmament Academy. When it was first announced that Long Chen had taken up the place of the dean of the seventh branch academy, they had all felt that the High Firmament Academy was playing around too much. Now, they saw that the academy was truly wise.

“Clean up the battlefield! The bodies of those devils might be ruined, but their devil cores should still be intact!” ordered the elder.

As expected, within the black and burnt land, they began to find fist-sized devil cores. That was where the essence of the devils was condensed.

After purifying the devil qi, they could be refined into pure energy, so they were very valuable.

The Yaohua Prefecture’s experts quickly cleaned up the battlefield. However, Long Chen was even more excited than them.

He had only slightly tested the World Extermination Flame Lotus, but that slight test already gave it immense power. He hadn’t even used the Nirvana Scripture, so it could be seen just how much the World Extermination Flame Lotus had improved.

The power of the World Extermination Flame Lotus depended on his own control. The greater his power, the greater his control over flame energy.

Previously, the World Extermination Flame Lotus’s limited power was due to him not being able to control so much power. If it went out of control, it would damage himself.

However, after advancing to the Divine Lord realm, even Long Chen himself wasn’t sure just how strong he had grown. If he hadn’t been surrounded by so many World Kings back in the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture, he would have definitely fought to his full potential.

But there was no way around it back there. He could not challenge a group of World Kings yet. However, this devil army wasn’t something he was afraid of. He was returning to his home territory in glory, and he was excited to finally have a place to use his power.

…

The High Firmament Academy’s barrier had already been activated, and countless devils were attacking it. The grand formation was split into four layers in total, creating three regions.

Countless experts were fighting devils in these three regions. At the same time, the tablets on their waists were constantly flashing.

“How many have you got?”

“Ninety-seven thousand. What about you?”

“Fuck, are you intentionally provoking them to you?”

These experts fighting the devils still had the time to chat as they fought. Their tablets were being used to count their kill points. Once the battle was over, they could exchange the points for treasures.

This time, the academy was giving them luxurious rewards. As long as they continued to kill these devils, they would get the treasures that they dreamed of.

Thus, everyone was doing everything they could to kill more devils. Fortunately, there were enough devils that people didn’t start fighting over them.

These three regions were split into those for the Four Peak realm, the Divine Lord realm, and the Immortal King realm. The academy had used a formation to split the devils according to their realms, so people could choose the battlefield that best suited their power.

“If senior apprentice-brother Long Chen were here, do you think he would enter the Divine Lord battlefield?” asked someone suddenly.

“Don’t call him that. He’s the dean!” shouted another person.

BOOM!

Just then, a huge explosion shook all three regions, causing everyone to jump.

They saw a red devil smash into the barrier like a shooting star.

After that, the devil slid off the barrier just like that. It had actually smashed itself to its death.

That sight stunned everyone. Just what was going on? When they looked further into the distance, their jaws dropped.
