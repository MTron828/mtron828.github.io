Chapter 1906 Mo Nian’s Power

Translator: BornToBe

The giant skeleton unleashed a powerful divine might. People felt a cold chill. It was like an ancient beast had reappeared and was staring at them.

“Zhiqiu, be careful! It’s the Blue Eye Peacock’s corpse!” warned Meng Qi. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A blue ray of light suddenly shot out from where the eyes would be on the Blue Eye Peacock.

“Get out of the way! That’s its divine ability!” shouted Meng Qi.

The blue light cut across the sky. Ye Zhiqiu’s expression changed, and instead of facing it head-on, she dodged to the side.

The earth was torn asunder. Wherever the blue light passed, the world was split apart. The sky now looked displaced as even the flow of spacetime was torn apart.

“Watch out!”

The neutral camp’s experts let out startled cries and hastily flew into the air. The blue light streaked past where they were, annihilating that area. Their expressions changed.

“Xie Luo, are you forcing me to take action?” demanded Hu Feng, his expression icy.

“It’s just a misunderstanding,” said Xie Luo indifferently.

Xie Luo was standing on top of the Blue Eye Peacock’s head. He was finally exposing his trump card.

This skeleton was the corpse of the Blue Eye Peacock he had obtained from the nest. He had refined it into a puppet.

The Heavenly Evil Sect had a secret art to refine corpses into puppets. It could retain a portion of the corpse’s divine abilities, and most terrifying of all, the corpse’s power might even be able to match its power while it was still living.

Regretfully, this corpse was not fully intact. Its original divine feathers had been incinerated. There wasn’t even one feather thanks to Long Chen.

Xie Luo had had no choice but to refine it into a skeleton puppet without its feathers. He could only activate the runes on the skeleton of the corpse to activate its divine abilities.

As a result, its power had sharply dropped. The Blue Eye Peacock could only unleash fifty percent of its original power.

However, even fifty percent was enough for him to dominate those in the same realm as him. The Blue Eye Peacock was a primordial beast. No one could block its divine abilities.

As soon as the Blue Eye Peacock appeared, Ye Zhiqiu was forced to retreat. Xie Luo immediately sent the Blue Eye Peacock flying toward Long Chen.

Long Chen was in the midst of fighting against Huo Lieyun and True Immortal Jiaoqi when a blue light shot toward him.

BOOM!

Long Chen crazily hacked Evilmoon but was still forced back by the blue light.

The sky rumbled behind Long Chen. Despite trying to stabilize himself, that blue light was too powerful, and it pushed him into the distance.

When the light finally ran out of energy, Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood. The Blue Eye Peacock’s power was truly immense. Even in his current state, he was injured.

After wiping away the blood, Long Chen’s eyes blazed with battle intent. He smiled. “You actually turned a plucked bird into such a thing. Xie Luo, you have some skill.”

Xie Luo’s killing intent intensified. Originally, the Blue Eye Peacock’s corpse had been perfect, but it had been half ruined by Long Chen’s flames.

If its corpse was intact, then even without the original true feathers, he would have been able to preserve eighty percent of its power. If that happened, who in the Yin Yang World would be able to block him? And if the corpse still had its feathers, Long Chen would probably have died from that attack. He would have never had a chance to mock him.

“Stop wasting time! Kill Long Chen immediately!” shouted Huo Lieyun, once more attacking with his flame giant.

“Qilin-drake merger, bloodline summoning, ancestral spirit possession!” True Immortal Jiaoqi also let out a shout. An image of a qilin and a drake appeared on his forehead.

The power of his Blood Qi skyrocketed. It was like divine flames were burning around him.

“He’s actually using his ancestral power. They’re not planning on stopping until Long Chen is dead.” The neutral camp’s experts were shocked.

“They treat Long Chen as someone they must kill here. Clearly, they’re alright with leaving anyone other than him alive.”

When comparing Long Chen to the Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s geniuses, they clearly cared more about eliminating Long Chen. They viewed him as a greater threat than everyone else added together.

“Huo Lieyun’s tactics aren’t wrong. As long as the Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance are present, with Long Chen’s character, he won’t leave even if he has to fight to the death. However, if they get destroyed, Long Chen won’t have anything holding him back. He’d leave, and then considering his talent and ruthless character, those powers would have to live in fear for the rest of their lives.”

It was no wonder Huo Lieyun wasn’t focusing on the Dragonblood Legion or the Martial Heaven Alliance. He was using those people to keep Long Chen here. He truly understood Long Chen.

“Hmph, I only view Long Chen as a real hero. The rest of them are fakes,” said one Empyrean. In his eyes, Long Chen was the only one worthy of that title.

“It’s too bad his character is too obvious. His enemies already know how to bait him into traps easily.”

“Long Chen is Long Chen. This is his flaw, but it’s not always a bad thing. It’s because of this flaw that he has a group of people willing to follow him unto death. Other than the Sovereigns, has there ever been someone with such charisma? Someone capable of making countless people risk their lives alongside them?”

For a moment, the neutral camp’s people were silent. From the Eastern Wasteland to the Central Plains, Long Chen had fought through countless despicable traps and countless life and death battles. But this characteristic of his had never changed. He never bowed his head.

Such a person looked a bit foolish and lacked flexibility. However, there was no choice but to admit that he possessed unmatched charisma.

They looked at the Dragonblood warriors slaughtering their enemies on the battlefield. Even this new army of the Martial Heaven Alliance possessed amazing morale. That was his charisma.

Even as spectators, they were unknowingly affected by it, having an urge to join the battle.

“Long Chen, you’ll be dying without a burial today!”

On the battlefield, Huo Lieyun, True Immortal Jiaoqi, and Xie Luo had surrounded Long Chen, making sure he had nowhere to run.

“Having a burial isn’t important. What’s important is that you don’t have that ability,” said Long Chen fearlessly.

Just as the three of them were fighting, on the other side, Di Feng was fighting Mo Nian. Divine light flowed around Di Feng. He was wearing divine armor, wielding his divine spear, and now there was a giant five-colored divine ring behind him.

This divine ring was different from Long Chen’s. Its five colors were absorbing the energy of the five elements for Di Feng.

His spear, armor, and divine ring were a rare set of divine items. They were part of the Di family’s inheritance and relied on bloodline power to be activated.

His three divine items were at full power, but he was unable to charge past Mo Nian’s blockade.

The two large figures in Mo Nian’s manifestation were forming hand seals, transmitting divine light into Mo Nian’s body.

As for the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow in his hand, each arrow it shot out caused the world to dim. It was blazing as intensely as the sun.

Rumor was that when the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow was at full power, it could shoot down the sun and pierce the moon. It was unknown what trump card Mo Nian had activated, but his power was so great that he was evenly matched against Di Feng.

Mo Nian’s power was out of Huo Lieyun’s expectations. His original plan was for the four of them to go all-out and kill Long Chen before eliminating the others.

This was the mission that Pill Valley had given him. He was to make sure that the other powers suffered a bit so they would go against the Martial Heaven Alliance.

Once Long Chen and the others were dead, those powers would band together to deal the final nail in the coffin to the Martial Heaven Alliance.

He had gone above and beyond the first part of his mission. The large powers had suffered immense losses, far beyond any expectations. Now the question was whether or not they could kill Long Chen.

“Attack!” Huo Lieyun suddenly shouted, his spear piercing toward Long Chen.

True Immortal Jiaoqi and Xie Luo followed. Long Chen was the crux. He had to be killed. Now that things had developed to this point, they could not permit him to leave here alive.

As long as the Dragonblood Legion was still here, there was no way Long Chen would flee on his own. This was their best chance to kill him.

With the three of them joining hands, divine light exploded. Each attack was a peerless killing blow.

Evilmoon was also shining with divine light, and a dragon cry resounded through the air. Long Chen was unleashing all his power. Dragon might soared out as he blocked their attacks.

“This isn’t his power but his saber’s. He won’t be able to last long!” shouted Huo Lieyun, noticing this oddity.

Evilmoon was emitting a grand dragon might, and the majority of their attacks were blocked by it. Long Chen himself was enduring very little of their power. So even though he was fighting three against one, he was able to last for a while.

Just as they were fighting, the sky shuddered. A group of experts came flying over. When that group appeared, the remaining thirty thousand members of the coalition army let out a cheer.

“Bastards of the Martial Heaven Alliance, now you’re dead!”
