Chapter 2122 The Old Man’s True Strength

“Patriarch, kill them!” shouted Zhao Wuji upon seeing the Mechanism Sect’s patriarch regain awareness.

Zhao Wuji was currently covered in blood and in a miserable plight from Gu Yang’s attacks. Without his armor, his combat power had been reduced by eighty percent. He couldn’t even match Gu Yang.

“I know you! You’re Long Chen!” The patriarch finally recognized who Long Chen was.

Suddenly, the world trembled and the giant black hole in the sky exploded. The ruins on the ground poured toward that black hole.

At this moment, as those broken fragments of buildings were sucked into the black hole, it was possible to tell that millions of invisible blades were slicing within that collapsed space. Everything that was sucked in vanished without a trace.

The sky was like a dome that had been pierced through. It was now gradually collapsing even further. The hole grew, sucking in everything around it. It was like the very world knew that it wasn’t going to survive much longer and wanted to bring everything within it along. It was truly a sight that caused despair.

“Those who destroyed my Mechanism Sect, you’ll all die!”

The patriarch roared. Having regained awareness, his Samsara power was no longer chaotic. Long Chen felt the world spinning around him as if he was stuck in a giant whirlpool. He could only watch as the patriarch charged toward him, and he was powerless to dodge.

Before this, he could rely on his sharp spiritual perception to dodge his attacks, but now, he was experiencing the true power of a fourth step Netherpassage expert. This Samsara power was not a kind of energy, but a kind of law. Long Chen’s power could not contend with this law.

The old man finally interfered. The Heaven Splitting Blade slashed down, destroying the space binding Long Chen. He hastily retreated from the battlefield.

The old man’s blade came to a stop when it met the patriarch’s blood-colored sword. When their two attacks collided, it was like a star had exploded. The world shuddered, and the black hole in the void grew quite a bit bigger from the impact.

The old man stood in the air, unshaken by the attack. As for the patriarch, he was forced back three steps, each step causing the space behind him to collapse.

“Who are you?!” demanded the patriarch, shocked. He instantly saw through the old man’s cultivation base and couldn’t believe that a third step Netherpassage expert had stopped him.

“Someone who only relies on external power to cultivate isn’t fit to know my name,” snorted the old man. Ignoring the shocked patriarch, he turned to Long Chen. “Look well. Once before, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect was called the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect, while the Heaven Splitting Blade was called the Heaven Splitting Divine Blade. Back then, the nine forms of Split the Heavens were known as a divine art. However, without the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, there was no way to bring out their full potential, so we gradually declined. However, even without the divine tablet, a divine art is still a divine art. As long as you immerse yourself fully within it and trust it, it can give you unlimited power. Watch.”

Just like that, the old man began to walk over to the patriarch, holding the Heaven Splitting Blade. With every step, his indomitable aura cloaked him, and the world shuddered.

“Die!”

The Mechanism Sect’s patriarch was startled as he sensed a frightening killing intent lock onto him. Black rays of light shot out of his scales, emitting ear-piercing sounds.

Those black rays directly pierced the old man’s body, making Long Chen jump.

However, he quickly realized that they hadn’t pierced him. He didn’t know what technique the old man was using, but his body would always move the slightest bit to dodge them. It was just that he was so fast that it looked like he was being struck.

“Wearing armor to cover your weakness only says that you have no confidence in your own power. The Samsara runes carved into your armor say that you aren’t confident enough in your own Samsara power. The hidden mechanisms within your armor say that you aren’t confident in the runes on your armor. The poison on your hidden weapons says that you aren’t confident in their power. Do you not have any confidence? Is someone like you fit to be a sect leader?”

The old man’s aura continued to rise as he walked forward. His voice resounded through the air like thunder.

“Long Chen, listen well. Using the sixth sense to sense the heavens doesn’t mean sensing the Heavenly Daos, nor does it mean attuning to the Human Dao. It is a realm where the Heavenly Daos are merged with the Human Dao. I cannot explain it any further. If you understand, then you understand. If you don’t, then you don’t. After I taught you the eighth form of Split the Heavens, you assumed that you had mastered it since you could use it. In reality, you’re wrong. The reason the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect could stand tall just from the nine forms of Split the Heavens is because the profundities within this divine art are unimaginable. Even I can not say that I’ve comprehended more than a tenth of it. You used the eighth form just now; so I’ll show you my eighth form.”

“Bastard!” The patriarch suddenly noticed that the old man’s aura had risen to a frightening level. Every step he took caused his aura to jump.

After the seventh step, rumbling rang out from the old man’s body. The space behind him split open as an image of the Heaven Splitting Blade appeared behind him.

That giant Heaven Splitting Blade caused the collapsing space to actually slow down. In the end, space froze, as a will which subdued heaven and earth filled this world.

At that moment, the old man seemed to become the master of this world. Sounds faded away. The only thing that could be heard was the resonance between the Heaven Splitting Blade in the old man’s hand and its projected image behind him.

Finally, the old man took his eighth step. He raised the Heaven Splitting Blade, and it merged with the projection behind him.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Sharp divine light erupted out of the Heaven Splitting Blade as it finally slashed down.

The patriarch let out a howl, and all the scales on his body suddenly flew off, gathering into a giant shield in front of him.

Layers of energy whirled on top of the shield. That was his Samsara power. He had merged several layers of this power in front of his shield. Having sensed just how terrifying the old man’s attack was, he was going all-out with his defense.

Like a bolt of lightning, the Heaven Splitting Blade sliced down. A light sound rang out.

“This move...”

Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. This attack from the old man contained a different kind of will. That was something that he had only sensed from one other person, Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng specialized in the Sword Dao and placed all his trust in his sword. That kind of fanaticism was like that of a madman. Every strike of his Sword Qi contained all his power compressed into one line, which made it so frightening.

As for the old man’s attack, he had also compressed all his power into one thin line. Long Chen didn’t know how he had done it.

The old man’s attack went straight through. The patriarch of the Mechanism Sect split in two along with his shield. He had been killed.

Just at this moment, the minor world’s collapse hastened. The entire minor world had been split in two, and it could no longer endure this damage.

“Let’s go!” Long Chen waved his hand. He grabbed the patriarch’s corpse, wanting his armor, but more importantly his spatial ring.

This old fellow had been attempting a breakthrough. No one could guarantee a one hundred percent chance of a breakthrough, so they would pull certain treasures out of their astral spaces and place them within spatial rings. That way, if they died, they wouldn’t be bringing those treasures with them. Some rare spatial rings possessed great defensive power and were difficult to break. This patriarch was wearing one such ring.

“Gu Yang, stop fighting. Run!” Long Chen saw that Gu Yang was still fighting Zhao Wuji. Zhao Wuji wasn’t able to counterattack, but he was still able to hold on.

“I’ll go all-out!”

Gu Yang suddenly roared and actually used his own body to receive Zhao Wuji’s sickle blades, while his own spear pierced Zhao Wuji’s body. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Zhao Wuji’s body exploded, his Yuan Spirit killed along with him. As for Gu Yang, he was left with a large hole in his body from Zhao Wuji’s blade.

“Why bother?” Li Qi was speechless.

“If I couldn’t even cut down an injured fellow, I’d be embarrassed.” Gu Yang’s current state was quite frightening as his flesh began to rot around his wound. But he was still smiling.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran also returned. From their excited appearances, it seemed that they had struck gold.

“Boss, what do we do with these people?” Li Qi pointed to a group of people.

The women and children had already fled. The ordinary disciples had also been let out. Only some of the higher-ups were blocked by the Dragonblood warriors.

They numbered in the few hundreds, but they were Netherpassage experts. They were looking at Long Chen in fear. With one word, Long Chen would decide their fates.

Long Chen coldly said, “The Mechanism Sect has committed countless evil deeds. At the slightest urge, you’ll annihilate a person’s entire family. People like you should be killed to the last, but my Dragonblood Legion doesn’t like killing people who can’t resist. I’ll give you a way to live, but as for what you choose in the future, it’s your own matter. Scram!”

Those experts were overjoyed to hear this. Quite a few of them bowed deeply to Long Chen before flying off.

“Boss, you’re just letting them off like this? Aren’t they a group of evil people?” said Gu Yang unwillingly.

Long Chen said, “Do you think they’ll live just because we let them off? Do you know just how many people the Mechanism Sect has offended in the past? After escaping this minor world, they’ll probably be hunted down by the entire world. There are plenty of sects who hate the Mechanism Sect to the core. There’s no need for us to worry about it. Let’s go!”

Long Chen and the others flew out. They had just left the minor world when it collapsed behind them. The Mechanism Sect had forever vanished from this world.
