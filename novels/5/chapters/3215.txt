Chapter 3204 Luo Family Grand Elder

The scent of blood hung in the air. It was like a wet market where people constantly killed fish in it.

As soon as Long Chen, Luo Bing, and the others stepped out of the transportation formation, people immediately came up to confirm their status.

When Luo Bing showed her status as a disciple of the Luo family, they immediately let them through.

During normal times, there was no need for such strict checking. However, this was a special period.

The Ying Prefecture was jointly guarded by three large powers, but they all blindly followed the lead of the Luo family. It could be said that the Ying Prefecture was rather safe under the leadership of the Luo family.

Thus, a status plate of a disciple from the Luo family was the greatest confirmation. After that, they entered another transportation formation that brought them into an ancient city, and then there was another transportation formation.

This transportation formation was the one that could bring them throughout the Ying Prefecture. Long Chen had Luo Bing bring them to the Luo family’s fortress. He wanted to see just what kind of existence came from the devil sea.

The scent of blood grew even denser after the next transportation formation. They then got on the flying boat again and flew for two hours before arriving at a boundless shore.

The sapphire blue water was part of the famous devil sea. The more you looked at it, the more frightening it became.

It was like a bottomless abyss. No one knew what sort of monsters lay within its depths.

However, this was different from the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. There was no tide nor waves; it was just a body of dead water.

Even from a distance, they could see countless figures cleaning up the battlefield by the shore. There were countless corpses piled up, and their blood soaked into the seawater.

Those giant corpses were oddly shaped sea demons. Some were armored manatees, sea serpents with giant fangs, crocodiles with a blue flap on their backs, and many others that Long Chen had never seen before on the Martial Heaven Continent.

When their flying boat got closer, they saw that over ten giant crossbows were pointing at them. Those crossbows were hundreds of meters long. Based on their auras, even a late stage Divine Lord would probably be killed by them.

“Stop! Who goes there?!”

After Luo Bing stopped the flying boat, Long Chen and the others stepped down. However, as soon as Long Chen appeared, countless startled cries rang out.

Long Chen was currently the most famous expert of the entire Heavenly Swell Domain’s junior generation. His fame had soared with the Nine Prefecture Convention, and he had countless worshippers and people who viewed him as an idol.

Thus, as soon as he arrived, he caused a ruckus. None of them had expected Long Chen to come here.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, what are you doing here?”

At this moment, Luo Xue flew out of the crowd and came to him, pleasantly surprised. She had also advanced to the Four Peak realm and had reached the second Heavenstage. However, she was currently still covered in blood and had many wounds on her. Even so, those wounds didn’t cover up her delight when seeing him.

“I managed to finish some of my more pressing matters, so I was hoping to come to the Luo family for a look,” said Long Chen. “My apologies, I didn’t expect the Luo family to be so busy. I hope I didn’t disturb you.”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning exchanged a glance. This was clearly to cover up Luo Ning telling him that secret.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you are always welcome. Come, let me introduce you. This is our Luo family’s Grand Elder,” said Luo Xue, introducing him to an old man with a sharp face and a sharp gaze.

He was a late stage Divine Lord, and his gaze was as sharp as a blade. With his thin lips and stuck-up nose, he seemed like a very stubborn person.

The elder’s gaze showed no emotion. Long Chen was originally going to bow and exchange some pleasantries, but with that reception, he couldn’t be bothered.

Seeing that, Luo Bing, Luo Xue, and the others tensed. But they didn’t dare to say anything.

“Have I offended senior?” asked Long Chen directly.

“Luo Qingyang was my grandson.”

Long Chen was startled. No wonder his gaze wasn’t friendly.

The Grand Elder said, “Luo Qingyang was a disgrace to the Luo family. I don’t blame you for that matter. But I am not happy. I dislike you, but as an Elder of the Luo family, I also cannot be rude. Thus…”

Long Chen smiled. “I understand. If the positions were reversed, I would be the same. Luo Qingyang went down the path of no return. Although I didn’t lead him, it cannot be said that it had no relation to me. I do not mind that senior doesn’t like me. As long as someone does not harm me or the people beside me, I won’t mind at all.”

From the Martial Heaven Continent to the immortal world, Long Chen had seen all kinds of people. As for this old man, his stubbornness was practically etched across his face.

Luo Qingyang had betrayed the family because of his pampering, so this old man was definitely enraged by the betrayal, more so than anyone else. That was why he didn’t show a friendly face toward Long Chen, regardless of this betrayal not having much to do with him.

“Then I’ll thank you. I’m busy, so I won’t accompany you. Xue-er can keep you company.” The Grand Elder left just like that.

Luo Xue stuck out her tongue and said to Long Chen, “This elder’s temper is very explosive. When he learned of Luo Qingyang’s betrayal, he coughed up blood and almost became bedeviled. If it hadn’t been for the family head, he might have followed Luo Qingyang’s footsteps to the afterlife. He was originally the vice family head, and he was the one who requested to be demoted to Grand Elder. Moreover, he also punished himself with three hundred beatings of the wooden staves. He really isn’t bad. Don’t take his stubbornness to heart.”

“Haha, naturally. I like this character,” said Long Chen, not minding at all. He wasn’t so petty.

“Long Chen, I didn’t expect that you would come here.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Just then, the void shook and a middle-aged man appeared. It was the Luo family’s commander of their Protector Corps and the second son of the current family head. He was also Long Chen’s maternal uncle.

Luo Changwu was pleasantly surprised to see Long Chen come here. The latter was currently blazing as brightly as the sun in the Heavenly Swell Domain.

Long Chen immediately greeted him and asked him how he was. He learned that Luo Changwu came to take over the guard duty.

The people here had just fought a huge battle. They were being switched out so that they could rest and recuperate.

“Senior, are these corpses useful to you?” Long Chen pointed to the sea demons. Those things were trash to others, but they were treasures to him.

Before Luo Changwu could answer, an ear-piercing alarm rang out. All the experts that were in the midst of changing shifts instantly tensed.
