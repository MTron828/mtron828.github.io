Chapter 4550 Terrifying Power

“Come! Boss Long San will beat you one against three!”

Long Chen swaggered over to them. He still wasn’t releasing his aura, giving the impression that anyone who attacked him could easily overpower him. However, the shockwaves from when he killed that expert completely terrified the three of them.

BOOM!

Feng You didn’t slack off either. When she attacked, her golden spear emitted a brilliant phoenix cry, and half of the void collapsed around the three of them.

As Long Chen had drawn their attention, Feng You’s attack caught them off guard. With only three of them joining forces in a hasty attempt to block her attack, Feng You instantly blew them away.

In a four-against-one, their chances of victory were quite decent. However, they didn’t want a direct clash because that would result in large casualties.

This was why the mixed beast race could reach this spot without losing many experts. They weren’t strong enough to crush all the people in front of them; these people just didn’t want to clash with them so early.

In the same vein, the Blood Gauze Sect had occupied a territory and didn’t want to fight the mixed beast race. They just wanted to take advantage of the mixed beast race’s average intelligence to extort Feng You. If they had some hostages, they would have control over the battlefield.

It was a nice idea, but their vision was truly lacking to choose Long Chen as their target. Just count it as their tragedy. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Feng You sent three of their top experts flying, and one of them coincidentally flew toward Long Chen. That person screamed and slammed his weapon toward him.

However, before his weapon could strike Long Chen, Long Chen already stepped to the side and landed a clean slap to his face. The moment Long Chen’s palm touched the poor guy’s cheek, a lightning rune flashed on his palm.

BOOM!

When the lightning rune detonated, it blasted the poor guy’s head into smithereens, but its wild power numbed Long Chen’s palm as well.

“Linger! You have to be gentler!”

While this attack indeed killed the poor guy in one move, the rune that Lei Linger used was too terrifying—many times stronger than the last one, leaving Long Chen’s palm bloody.

“Oh! Sorry! It wasn’t intentional. I was just testing the power of a Saint rune.” Lei Linger hastily apologized.

During this time, Lei Linger had been absorbing the heavenly tribulation’s thunderforce from the Saint corpses, and he had comprehended several runes from them.

It had been a while since she had fought anyone, so she wanted to know just how strong these new runes were. After she tested it on Long Chen’s opponent, she found that its power was absolutely terrifying, injuring even Long Chen. It was really out of expectation.

After all, she had layered some defenses on Long Chen’s palm before detonating the rune. According to her estimation, Long Chen would at most endure ten percent of the impact, and ninety percent of it would blast their opponent.

Even then, the recoil power still injured Long Chen’s palm; no wonder it instantly crushed their opponent’s head.

While the stinging pain on his palm was unbearable, it was also a pleasant surprise for Long Chen, indicating that Lei Linger had grown to an unimaginable level. In the future, he would be able to run rampant with her by his side.

“How despicable! Using hidden weapons to kill people! He has something on his hand!” shouted the other two top experts of the Blood Gauze Sect.

They hadn’t seen it clearly before, but this time, they noticed something lit up on Long Chen’s palm as he slapped their fellow clansman.

Assuming that Long Chen was using a mechanism, they directly cursed him. However, they didn’t forget to flee while doing so.

“If you have some guts, don’t run!” Long Chen shouted. At this moment, a fist-sized sphere appeared in his hand, and he tossed it into the ranks of the Blood Gauze Sect’s experts.

“Watch out!”

BOOM!

The sphere exploded, instantly decimating countless disciples of the Blood Gauze Sect in a large area.

“You cowardly bastard! Stop using hidden weapons and fight like a man!” roared the two peak experts of the Blood Gauze Sect.

This sphere was a bomb crafted by Guo Ran for Long Chen using Saint-level materials.

After hearing them accuse him of using hidden mechanisms, Long Chen decided to play along. As a result, this explosion caught even Long Chen off-guard. It had obliterated hundreds of thousands of experts in one go.

“God damn... I didn’t know that little crook was so powerful!” exclaimed Long Chen.

Usually, Long Chen would engage the strongest experts from the other side in combat, while Guo Ran would direct their comrades on the other battlefield. As a result, Long Chen had never taken note of the terrifying effect of Guo Ran’s killing tool. Now that he had used one himself, he found it to be too terrifying.

Seeing Long Chen use that bomb, the onlookers realized how he could slay top experts with a single slap. They also assumed that he had a hidden mechanism in his hand.

“If you want to fight one on one, you can come at me!” shouted Feng You as the other side cursed. She then appeared by Long Chen’s side, pointing her spear at them. Seeing her, the two top experts of the Blood Gauze Sect instantly shut their mouths.

Even the four of them had been unable to beat her. So, now that half of them were dead, if they were to challenge her again, they would be courting death.

“Using hidden weapons to kill people is the mark of a shameless fellow. Just you wait! Our Blood Gauze Sect has an inheritance stretching back millions and millions of years. We have seventy-two branch sects. To dare kill our people... just wait for your retribution!” roared one of them.

This shout immediately triggered Long Chen’s memories. The Blood Gauze Sect? Didn’t it sound a bit familiar? Did he happen to hear it in the mortal world or maybe the immortal world?[1]

If the Blood Gauze Sect’s inheritance really did stretch back as far as this person claimed, then it could be true. Furthermore, just one of their seventy-two branch sects already possessed this many powerful experts? How monstrous was the main sect?

However, Long Chen scoffed at this person’s threat. “Who cares about the Blood Gauze Sect? Can a group of ants challenge Boss Long San? Tch, you don’t know whom you have provoked.”

Long Chen turned his nose up at those experts, appearing incredibly arrogant. Those experts then retreated further back.

Having lost two of their top experts, the Blood Gauze Sect’s people were unable to remain here. After all, they could only stay in a region if the surrounding factions didn’t pose as much of a threat to them.

The territory of the Blood Gauze Sect was now under the control of the mixed beast race, so the latter felt incomparably excited. This was a level of glory they had never experienced before. They even felt like even if they fought to the death here, it would be worth it.

Just as they were looking at Feng You and Long Chen worshipfully, several experts amongst them suddenly walked toward Long Chen.
