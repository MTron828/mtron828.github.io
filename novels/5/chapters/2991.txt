Chapter 2980 An Instructor’s Vocation

“Don’t worry about that. The two don’t overlap each other. First is the Dao discussion and then the competition. There is ample time participate in both categories,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“Then this little one will do his best. However, if I do badly, will I be punished?” asked Long Chen.

“No. The Dao is ephemeral and limitless. We feel like all the senior instructors have become too spiritless. Even now, no one has thought of any new questions for the upcoming convention. Our thinking is too old. Thus, we wish to bet on a new representative,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang.

From his tone, it didn’t seem as if Heaven Master Yun Yang cared too much about the Nine Prefecture Convention. However, the entire academy seemed to have taken the attitude of being alright with just getting by, rather than striving for excellence.

Long Chen originally felt a great distaste for that attitude, but after talking with that sweeping elder, he understood that not everyone was intoxicated with the feeling of being number one. There were still plenty of people smarter than him. If he didn’t understand, then it just meant that he hadn’t reached that realm yet.

Even the dean didn’t seem concerned about this. With such an immense benefit, how could Long Chen possibly give it up? He naturally accepted.

“This is a special status plate. Starting today, you can freely go through all the scripture pavilions in the academy without paying…” Heaven Master Yun Yang gave Long Chen a violet status plate with the words ‘High Firmament’ carved onto it. This was actually a status plate outside of the Heaven, Earth, Human, and Mortal rankings.

Long Chen delightedly received it and thanked Heaven Master Yun Yang. This new status plate would help him out immensely.

“The academy has scripture pavilions in the outer academy as an introduction point, while the inner academy’s scripture pavilions are for building a foundation. As long as you can comprehend the tomes in the inner academy’s scripture pavilions, it is enough for you to master the core of the ten thousand Daos. Above those scripture pavilions are an even higher level of core techniques, but we are not planning on letting you come into contact with those. One reason is that your realm isn’t high enough, and diving into them will only harm you. The other reason is that due to us researching those higher level core techniques, our way of thinking grew stiff and inflexible. It is as if we bound ourselves with chains that we cannot break. Due to that, we will not apply any pressure on you. Read whatever you want. No one will give you direction. Even if you do badly during the convention, it won’t matter. The High Firmament Academy doesn’t care about such meaningless prestige. However, there are two matters that I must discuss with you.” Heaven Master Yun Yang suddenly grew solemn.

“Junior is listening,” said Long Chen respectfully.

“The first thing is that starting today, you are no longer permitted to directly transmit the academy’s magical arts to other disciples,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang.

Long Chen was startled. If the academy didn’t care about prestige or money, why would they restrict him in this aspect? Wasn’t that limiting the growth of its disciples?

Seeing his confusion, Heaven Master Yun Yang said, “To transmit the Dao, to instruct, to guide, this is the heavenly duty of an instructor. But your Dao is not other people’s Dao. Your path only suits you. If you draw others onto your path, ask yourself, how many of them will survive?”

“Well…” Long Chen was at a loss for words. Heaven Master Yun Yang was correct. If everyone learned from him, then unless they could always stay with him, anyone who learned his temper but didn’t have his power would quickly die.

“As an instructor, the highest realm is to lead people to the correct realm seemingly without doing anything,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang profoundly.

“Junior understands.” Long Chen nodded.

The Unfettered Alliance and Luo Gate’s disciples were not like the Dragonblood warriors. If they stayed by his side, when they encountered some terrifying opponent, they would only be cannon fodder.

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. Was the academy doing this specifically to prevent this kind of situation?

After all, as those two guilds grew stronger, they would draw more experts that wanted to join them. Their influence would also grow. Hence, the academy didn’t want him to influence that many disciples’ futures.

Thinking of that, Long Chen found that the academy’s higher-ups truly did have profoundly wise people. Despite the academy appearing completely muddled and out of control, the truth was everything was under their control. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Although he didn’t know the true goal of the academy, he was sure that it wasn’t as simple as it appeared on the surface.

As for the Chu family’s infiltration, perhaps to the true higher-ups, they were nothing more than dancing monkeys. The academy had to have its own reasons for not stopping them.

Thinking of this, Long Chen gradually smiled. If the higher-ups really were that smart, then things would be easier for him. His main worry had been idiots in high positions here.

Seeing Long Chen nod, Heaven Master Yun Yang also nodded. Long Chen was a smart person. With just a little hint, Long Chen understood his meaning. He then continued, “That was the first point. The second point is that the academy and the Battle God Palace are almost two separate entities. Other than the dean, no one in the academy can manage the Battle God Palace. Any outstanding disciples in the inner academy are snatched up by the Battle God Palace. Thus, the inner academy’s disciples are viewed as promising sprouts. Adding you to our group of instructors is actually not as simple as it sounds. If the dean had not personally sent word, we would not have dared to do so. If you become a Heaven Master, you must be prepared for when the Battle God Palace comes for you.”

“Comes for me? For what?” asked Long Chen.

“They will likely tell you to reject your status as a Heaven Master. Other than matters of the battlefield, the Battle God Palace is greatly disgusted by everything else. Thus…”

Long Chen understood and smiled. “Heaven Master Yun Yang, don’t worry. I am not someone to destroy the bridge after crossing the river. If I promise to do something, I will definitely do it. I have never broken my word in this lifetime.”

Heaven Master Yun Yang was indicating that when the Battle God Palace came to apply pressure on him to reject his status as Heaven Master, he had to say no.

From the Battle God Palace, Long Chen had met the Divine Lightning Elder, the Discipline Institute’s head judge, as well as that expert called Zhan Feng. He could tell that they were real men, and they naturally detested the academy’s convoluted and overelaborate workings.

He believed that the entire Battle God Palace was the same. But that was fine. He needed to get stronger, so why would he refuse such a good opportunity? If the Battle God Palace was willing to accept his admittance as a Heaven Master, good. If not, it was fine as well.

Furthermore, as long as he was strong enough, would the Battle God Palace really reject him just because he was a Heaven Master?

Seeing him agree, Heaven Master Yun Yang was at ease. Long Chen took his new status plate and happily left, going straight for the Divine Scripture Pavilion.
