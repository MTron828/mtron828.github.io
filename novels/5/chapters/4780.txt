Chapter 4769 Attacked on All Sides

When Bai Shishi and the others passed through the gate, they were immediately met with an overwhelming sight: an endless sea of figures stretching as far as the eye could see.3

Never before had Bai Shishi ever seen so many people in her life. Among them stood countless Sage Kings, their auras surpassing any she had ever encountered.3

Clearly, even though two individuals might both hold the title of Sage King, those from the Darklight Heaven paled in comparison to the ones here.4

In fact, some Sage Kings they had seen in the passageway seemed to transform after passing through the gate. It was like their auras were unsealed and started to grow rapidly.2

At this moment, Long Chen emerged with Evilmoon on his shoulder, and fresh blood dripped down its tip, slowly splashing to the ground. The ground was littered with corpses.2

Countless experts went crazy when they saw Long Chen. Eyeing the mass of corpses on the ground, they didn’t seem to believe their eyes.1

“Long Chen, you murderer! You’ve slaughtered countless people! Do you think you can beat all the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s experts by yourself? Do you believe your talent entitles you to look down on all the heavenly geniuses of the world? Do you think strength gives you the right to strip others of their lives and trample over their dignity?”1

At this time, one expert stood out, condemning Long Chen with righteous indignation. He was the Celestial race’s expert who had attacked Long Chen before. The moment he managed to get everyone to turn on Long Chen, he retreated and was the first to pass through the gate.3

At first, he was worried that Long Chen might not fall for his scheme. However, seeing Long Chen slaughter his way out of the gate, using Split the Heavens to kill the heavenly geniuses blocking him, this Celestial race’s expert was overjoyed. He almost laughed and broke his act.0

In the end, Long Chen had fallen for his trap. All those people blocking him belonged to countless factions within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. In other words, Long Chen had already offended countless factions.0

Those factions were all waiting for this fresh blood to join them and help them deal with their pressing crisis. However, all their hopes were ruined now.0

Seeing their people killed by Long Chen, all of them exploded with rage.0

However, Long Chen simply looked around, his gaze finally resting upon that expert of the Celestial race. He sneered, “I don’t care if it’s a hidden scheme or an open scheme. I’ll just blast through it. If you want to kill me, just come at me. In this world, is there really such a thing as reason or truth? In this dog-eat-dog world, right only exists within the range of my saber. I’m not going to bother trying to explain myself or correct your lies. I disdain doing so. In the end, everything must be settled by blood and force. Since that’s the case, is there a point to all this nonsense?”1

Standing there against these endless experts, Long Chen appeared fearless. His voice wasn’t particularly loud, but it resounded throughout the sky, causing every person to clearly sense the confidence and pride in Long Chen’s soul. One man and one saber shook all of them.1

Amongst these people, many of them had no enmity with Long Chen. After all, the people Long Chen had slain were not their friends or family members. For such a heroic figure to suddenly appear within the human race did make them give each other a certain look.0Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Seeing that everyone was shaken by Long Chen, the Celestial race’s expert immediately followed up. “Everyone, do you see? Do you see how arrogant and bloodthirsty he is? If he is left alive, no one will be able to rest in peace. This is the Sovereign Emperor Heaven where we are constantly fighting off the invasion of devil creatures. If a devil were to appear within our ranks, who could leave their back unguarded?”3

In response, Long Chen said, “Why do you spout so much bullshit? I already said that I’m not going to explain anything. If you want to attack, just attack. Don’t keep barking like a dog and sacrifice other people.” 0

“Everyone, do you see? You see how wild he is? He doesn’t need a reason to kill people! Your people died because of him! Are you just going to watch?” shouted the Celestial race’s expert.0

“How loathsome. Do you only know how to use others? Then today, I swear that no matter how many people are protecting you, you will not live to see tomorrow’s sun,” declared Long Chen.0

Long Chen didn’t want to waste words anymore, but this fellow’s provocation skill was truly strong, igniting Long Chen’s suppressed anger.0

“Hahaha, kill me? Alright, then I, Yue Wuxu, look forward to it!” Yue Wuxu then turned to everyone and said, “You all see how he is! Since you all wish to cower, my Celestial race will make the first move.”4

The Celestial race’s bewitching abilities were indeed supreme, causing many people to blaze with killing intent.0

“Slow down! Everyone, do not be bewitched by the Celestial race and fall for their trap. I swear to everyone using the name of the Heavenly Desolation Long clan that this is a trap, a huge sinister trap.”0

Just then, something that Long Chen hadn’t expected occurred. A certain someone had rushed forward to defend him, and shockingly, this person was Long Xihe.5

Countless people’s hearts shook when they heard the name of the Heavenly Desolation Long clan. The Heavenly Desolation Long clan was clearly quite strong on its own, at least strong enough to intimidate them.0

The disciples of the Long clan who had come with Long Xihe were also baffled. They couldn’t believe that the person who had been cursing Long Chen behind his back would protect him at this time, even throwing the name of the Heavenly Desolation Long clan as a guarantee.0

Long Chen stared at Long Xihe in confusion, having no idea what drug this dude had taken this morning. After all, back in the passageway, Long Xihe had been glaring at Long Chen like he wanted to tear Long Chen to pieces.3

This sudden change caught Long Chen off-guard. Furthermore, Yue Wuxu’s expression also changed when Long Xihe appeared. Just as he was about to reply, Elder Xihe continued, “Do people not know what kind of people the Celestial race is? They’ve promised riches to make people take Long Chen’s head. However, when the battle started, they were the first to leave. He wants all of you to be killed by Long Chen and then use the factions behind you to keep attacking Long Chen, while the Celestial race won’t lose a single warrior. Are you willing to be used by the Celestial race?”0

“What bullshit! Long Chen already killed so many people! He could stop at any moment, but he hunted them down to the last! A murderer like him cannot be left alive, or he will eradicate many races and clans! Everyone should be united against this common enemy and wipe him out. Since you protect Long Chen like this, do you think we wouldn’t realize that Long Chen is from your Heavenly Desolation Long clan?!” shouted Yue Wuxu.0

“What?”0

All the experts present were started. Was the Celestial race really planning on fighting the Long clan? Both sides could be considered great factions in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. However, no one had ever heard of their enmity.0

“We don’t care about the enmity between the Heavenly Desolation Long clan and the Celestial race. But Long Chen must give us compensation today!” declared a Sage King darkly.0

“What compensation?” asked Elder Xihe, his expression changing.0

“Long Chen must die!”
