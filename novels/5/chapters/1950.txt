Chapter 1940: 1940

“Brother Long, I knew that you wouldn’t forget us . ”

Those lightning drakes excitedly pounded upon the tribulation beasts . They were the lightning drakes of the lightning field, and the strongest existences below the silver drake king . Back when Long Chen had come to an agreement with the drake king, they had even helped him gain the paragon art .

They had also helped him out immensely in the Yin Yang World . It just so happened that Long Chen could now repay them with this tribulation .

These tribulation beasts contained divine lightning within them . That was the most precious type of energy to these lightning drakes . They crazily devoured them .

Although these tribulation beasts were very powerful, they lacked intelligence . They only charged at Long Chen because Long Chen’s attack just now had provoked the wrath of the heavens, causing the will of the tribulation to turn on him . These tribulation beasts only had one thought, and that was to kill Long Chen .

They ignored the lightning drakes until the lightning drakes had already coiled around them . By then, they would just be devoured easily .

“Lei Long, lend me ninety percent of your energy, and send ten percent to devour the lightning runes . ”

After saying that, Long Chen raised Evilmoon . Lightning surged along Evilmoon as he slashed it toward a tribulation beast . The divine power of Lei Long and Evilmoon combined .

The tribulation beast was blown apart into divine lightning runes and then devoured by Lei Long . Before Lei Long was even finished devouring those runes, Long Chen had moved onto the second . With Lei Long and Evilmoon working together, it was easy for them to kill the tribulation beasts .

“Brothers, hurry up . Time’s almost up . ” Long Chen saw that the tribulation clouds were growing sparse . By this time, any further attacks against them would be useless . He had exhausted all the power of this tribulation .

If it was just one person undergoing tribulation, then there would have been little chance for even the five-colored tribulation lightning to appear . The reason the tribulation had so much energy was because there were over ten thousand Dragonblood warriors undergoing tribulation together .

All the energy had now been forced out by Long Chen, and the energy of the heavens was fading . It could not punish Long Chen .

The lightning drakes frantically devoured as much as they could . Sometimes, the tribulation beasts would be half-devoured and still charge toward Long Chen while the lightning drakes moved on . It was easy for Long Chen to kill those stragglers .

Only half of the tribulation beasts had been slain, but the tribulation was already starting to fade . The tribulation beasts began to return to heaven and earth .

Suddenly, a silver claw stretched out of the channel, and a silver ripple spread, blowing apart those tribulation beasts .

A large mouth then came out of the channel and devoured those lightning runes . The silver drake king had come .

“Long Chen, how could you not call me!” The silver drake had attacked through the channel and taken the lightning runes . The channel that Long Chen had made this time was too small to fit it through though .

“What the, why did you come?” Long Chen was startled .

“Long Chen, you had best give me an explanation!” raged the silver drake king . It was speaking spiritually, so others couldn’t hear .

“How could I possibly call you over something so tiny? This kind of snack shouldn’t interest you . That’s why I only invited your little brothers, and I’ll invite you for the real feast later . Didn’t you notice that this isn’t even my own tribulation, it’s the tribulation of my brothers . Only once I break through will there be a real feast . Hehe, to tell the truth, I’m a bit worried that your stomach isn’t big enough,” said Long Chen .

“Are you telling the truth?” questioned the silver drake king .

“I disdain lying . ” Long Chen frowned .

“Cough, then it was my mistake . Now it’s a bit awkward,” said the silver drake .

“It really is a bit awkward . This little bit is barely enough food to get stuck between your teeth, but it’s a good piece of meat to your brothers . As the boss, you can’t be selfish,” said Long Chen .

“Then what do I do?” The silver drake king didn’t know what to do now . It would be a blow if it admitted it was stealing food from its brothers .

“Fine, I’ll help you . However, you have to help me when I need it too . ” Long Chen didn’t give the drake king a chance to reply before announcing, “How dangerous! Just now, the divine lightning beasts were about to fade away, but fortunately your king came to capture them in time . Quick, go back . Your dragon king is going to share the divine energy with you . Due to the dragon king attacking, the channel is about to reach its limit . I really envy you for having such a good boss . ” Long Chen seemed to sigh emotionally, giving a thumbs-up .

His words were very brilliant . The drakes naturally had no idea if they were true or false . They immediately became grateful to the drake king .

“Many thanks . ” The drake king expressed its thanks to Long Chen before leaving as well . His conning ability was unrivaled and had given it face .

The tribulation disappeared and the lightning channel faded . All the energy of the tribulation had been spent, and the Dragonblood Legion’s people had absorbed as much as they could for a perfect advancement .

Quite a few corpses were floating on the surface of the sea now that the tribulation was over . Those corpses belonged to the sea demons that had been near . Due to the Dragonblood Legion’s tribulation descending suddenly, some of the weaker ones hadn’t had time to flee .

“Let’s go . ” Long Chen waved his hand, and everyone went over to the spatial channel that Yue Xihan had already summoned .

They returned to the Skyscraping World . All of them were excited enough to shout . Most Life Star experts only had astral spaces around a hundred miles wide at the start . Even rank nine Celestials would only have around three hundred miles .

The astral space contained one’s world energy, but usually those below rank nine Celestials were not qualified to actually use their world energy . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

That was why the Dragonblood warriors were able to easily slay Life Star experts while in the Soul Transformation realm . Those Life Star experts were usually only around the level of rank seven or eight Celestials .

Those experts had not managed to catch the great era, and their cultivation bases had reached their limits . So those Life Star experts were not able to compare to today’s heavenly geniuses .

As for the Empyreans who were called heavenly geniuses, their astral spaces would normally be around three thousand miles . Only at that level was it possible to bring out the full potential of the world energy in their astral spaces .

In the Yin Yang World, the army of Life Star Empyreans that had charged over was so powerful because they were able to control a bit of their world energy . However, since they had only recently advanced, they could only control a bit of it . This was why Huo Lieyun was so terrifying in comparison . His realm had already stabilized at the first Heavenstage of Life Star, allowing him to control his world energy . If Long Chen hadn’t obtained the azure dragon reverse scale, he would have been crushed .

No one knew how large Huo Lieyun’s astral space was, but right now, even the weakest healing warrior had reached an astral space of thirty thousand miles .

The Dragonblood warriors had all achieved astral spaces over a hundred thousand miles, with some reaching one hundred and fifty thousand miles . As for Gu Yang and the captains, they had astral spaces three hundred thousand miles wide .

However, one person was so monstrous that their astral space was almost one million miles wide . That was Yue Xiaoqian . When that news spread, the original devil race was overjoyed .

Gu Yang and the others were a bit upset by this immense difference, but Yue Xihan explained that it was due to the special cultivation technique of the original devil race . It had nothing to do with talent .

The one to benefit the most from this tribulation was Yue Xiaoqian . She even had a deeper understanding of the Profound Spirit Dao Scripture after experiencing this tribulation . Many areas that she hadn’t understood were now clear to her .

Long Chen told everyone not to care too much about the size of their astral spaces . That was just a portion of the power of the Life Star realm . There was something even more important, which was awakening their manifestations .

Only upon reaching the Life Star realm was it possible to awaken their manifestations . However, that would require comprehension and luck .

The tribulation had ended, so Yue Xihan found a secluded place for them to enter seclusion . They had to stabilize their realm first .

Long Chen also didn’t laze around . He went to the ancestral land of the original devil race and took out a mountain of medicinal pills .

Opening his mouth, he activated the divine ability Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth . Those pills were like a flood entering his stomach .

Runes lit up on his stomach, forming a foundation . This was the divine ability of the dark evil dragon race .

Huo Long had been refining pills constantly, giving Long Chen a giant stockpile . Now, it was time to use it .

“Let’s see what Heavenstage I can reach now . ”

Rumbling sounds rang out within Long Chen’s stomach, like a volcano was erupting . Endless energy flowed through him .
