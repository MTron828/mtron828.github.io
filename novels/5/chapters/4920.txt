Chapter 4909: Masked Man

There was an explosive sound, but no actual explosion. It was actually the sound of a rune detonating on her, releasing countless thin threads that bound her.

“Stop! Release me! I’m going to kill them!” Huo Qianwu struggled crazily, but she was quickly immobilized.

Seeing this, Long Chen had a bad feeling and swung Evilmoon at her.

However, his attack passed right through. It seemed that those white threads made Huo Qianwu enter an ethereal state, and her figure rapidly faded away.

“Long Chen, you’ll pay the price for your foolish actions!” The vice hall master’s icy voice rang out.

“Tch, do you think I’m afraid of you?” Long Chen scoffed at the vice hall master’s threat.

Long Chen was confident that the vice hall master’s power could only affect Huo Qianwu. Otherwise, he’d have helped her kill him.

“We’ll see!” The vice hall master snorted, and then Huo Qianwu’s figure vanished.

At this moment, Mo Nian let out a startled cry, and Long Chen hastily looked over, only to see that Mo Nian’s chain had been severed. Mo Nian was standing there, dumbfounded.

Long Chen’s head buzzed. Without thinking, he directly rushed toward the devil corpse.

“Long Chen, careful! There’s someone on the corpse!” roared Mo Nian as he charged over.

Suddenly, the devil corpse turned and unfurled its giant wings, its resulting astral wind smacking away Long Chen and Mo Nian like two houseflies.

Both Long Chen and Mo Nian coughed up blood and smashed into the ground, leaving two long ditches in it.

“What’s going on?!” shouted Long Chen.

“Fuck, so even I can end up like this. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind—we were schemed against!” Mo Nian gnashed his teeth.

BOOM!

Just then, the devil corpse quivered. It raised a foot and slammed it down at the two of them.

With a single step, it crossed the enormous distance between them. This one stomp covered the heavens, and a wild devil pressure locked the two of them down in their place.

“Now what?!”

Even Long Chen started to panic. After all, the revival of this devil corpse was related to Xing Wujiang’s fate. They couldn’t allow the slightest mishap to happen.

“Think of a way to eliminate that fellow on the corpse,” said Mo Nian. Waves of killing intent raged in his eyes as he couldn’t accept that someone had actually schemed against him successfully. After he had worked for so long, someone else would reap all the benefits at his expense.

Both Long Chen and Mo Nian slammed a palm at each other, pushing each other out.

BOOM!

A giant foot appeared where the two of them had just been, almost crushing them.

“Charge!” Long Chen and Mo Nian shouted at the same time.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen, having exhausted his dragon blood power, directly activated the Seven Star Battle Armor. His divine ring appeared, a sea of stars within it, with seven stars in particular blazing like suns.

Mo Nian also summoned a manifestation: a resplendent palace, accompanied by an ancient pine that pierced through the dome of the heavens. The pine was so huge that the manifestation could not contain it, revealing only a small portion of its grandeur.

Like two streaks of lightning, Long Chen and Mo Nian ran up the giant devil corpse’s leg, reaching its knee in the blink of an eye.

Suddenly, runes lit up on its leg, and Long Chen and Mo Nian jumped at the same time, not waiting for the runes’ power to erupt. They wriggled through the gaps between the runes.

These runes bore the essence of the Emperor Dao. Even brushing against one of them would be too much for Long Chen and Mo Nian.

The duo moved in perfect synchronization. Despite having to evade the runes, their speed remained unaffected. In an instant, they reached the devil corpse’s waist.

As they gathered at its waist, the devil corpse’s arms lunged toward them. Reacting swiftly, they propelled each other, sending themselves shooting across its waist.

BOOM!

Just as the devil corpse’s attack missed, the devil corpse suddenly quivered, and a halo of light burst out of it.

Long Chen and Mo Nian retreated at almost the same time, leaving the corpse alone. If they were to stick to it, they could easily be injured.

The two of them were extremely experienced fighters and familiar with each other’s techniques. Although they rarely fought together, when they did, their cooperation was flawless.

Long Chen saw the devil corpse bend down slightly and said, “He’s going to run!”

“Leave it to me!” Mo Nian raised his hand, summoning a bow swiftly. With precision, he shot an arrow, its tip secured with a sturdy rope.

Long Chen and Mo Nian grabbed hold of the rope. Just as they did, a powerful force brought them flying through the air.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mo Nian’s arrow landed under the devil corpe’s armpit. Although it was unable to penetrate its skin, it firmly stuck to it.

The devil corpse leaped into the air but didn’t manage to throw off the two of them. Instead, its momentum only dragged the two of them flying on its shoulder. When they landed on its shoulder, they saw a cloaked figure wearing a silver mask there.

“A human?”

Long Chen and Mo Nian were startled. Although this person was wearing a cloak and mask, hiding his aura, from what they sensed, he was truly a member of the human race.

“Friend, this corpse relates to the life and death of one of my brothers. I hope you can endure the pain of parting with it. If you feel like it’s a loss, I, Mo Nian, will owe you a favor. I can give you another Emperor-level devil corpse in the future or whatever else you want,” said Mo Nian.

“Who do you think you are? Is your name worth that much? I want this devil corpse, and that’s that. You want to save Xing Wujiang? You’re quite loyal. Unfortunately, what I like most is watching others struggle in despair,” snorted the masked man, his voice icy and aloof, as if he was a god looking down at ants on the ground.

Holding back his anger, Mo Nian asked, “As a member of the human race, are you unaware that once you undo this seal, you will bring forth a calamity to the human race?”

“Are you deaf or does your head not work? Did I not just say I like watching people struggle in despair? If I don’t let it out, how will I get to enjoy the sight of calamity?” The masked man scoffed at Mo Nian.

Mo Nian took a deep breath. He had suppressed his rage enough to almost plead with this bastard, all for Xing Wujiang’s sake. However, what he got in return was insults and mockery. Mo Nian could no longer suppress his anger.

“Then there’s nothing more to say. Kill him.”

Long Chen pointed Evilmoon at the masked man, his killing intent locking onto him.
