Chapter 3912 Life Sacrifice

Yin Changsheng's spear whistled through the air, hurtling toward Mo Nian with the ferocity of an enraged lion. Flames were dancing and flickering around its blade

In that critical moment, Mo Nian felt as though the very space around him had transformed into impenetrable iron walls, holding him captive. A powerful faith energy had locked him down, leaving him unable to dodge or escape.

BOOM!

Mo Nian’s bow quivered as he used it to block Yin Changsheng’s attack, but he was blown back and coughed up blood.

Mo Nian then stabilized himself and wiped away the blood from his lips. His gaze sharpened as he said, “So that’s the case. Your companion spirit beast was just a pawn for you. Now that it’s dead, you’ve taken back your power along with some interest. You’ve even gained the flame qilin’s core energy. With both your energy and its energy together, you can now truly control your faith energy.”

Yin Changsheng’s faith energy came from outside of himself. As he wasn’t the faith god, he was only borrowing this power.

After all, considering how much weaker Yin Changsheng was than his god, even with all the faith energy at his disposal, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to fully control it. While he could easily overwhelm ordinary experts with his faith energy, when it came to facing someone like Mo Nian, his lack of control rendered his faith energy almost ineffective.

But now that the flame qilin was dead, Yin Changsheng’s power soared. Finally, he could control his faith energy, and this attack left Mo Nian with a significant injury.

“You are right, my faith energy is my master’s. However, now that I have merged the qilin flame and my faith flame together, I can finally control more faith energy. Understand that all that awaits you now is death.”

After blowing Mo Nian away, Yin Changsheng didn’t chase after him. Instead, he turned to Little Snow. “Brute, you killed my flame qilin. Killing you will be my vengeance for it.”

To answer him, Little Snow opened its mouth and spat out a crescent-shaped wind blade. It was rapidly absorbing the world’s wind energy to grow, akin to a heavenly blade slicing through the air.

BOOM!

Yin Changsheng’s spear quivered as it shattered the wind blade. When the wind energy exploded, its ripples struck the world like the tide.

“Hmph, you could kill my flame qilin due to the attributes of wind and fire. It was too careless. But your wind element divine abilities have no effect on me,” sneered Yin Changsheng.

Just as he said, the mountain fire only grew more intense when a powerful gust stoked it. But if the wind was concentrated, it could blow out the fire. Thus, the relationship between wind and fire was quite miraculous.

Flame energy could be extinguished or blown out according to the will of wind energy. Thus, flame cultivators often didn’t like fighting wind element experts.

However, Yin Changsheng was not a pure flame cultivator as his flame energy contained faith energy. As a result, normal wind energy was unable to shake him.

Unfortunately for him, he had barely spoken when his expression changed. A dozen wind blades were slicing through the air at him. The moment he blocked the first wind blade, Little Snow already spat out a dozen more.

Yin Changsheng hastily swung his spear to block them, but he was shocked to find that these wind blades were growing stronger and stronger. Heaven and earth gradually became filled with whistling astral winds.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“A self-created domain?!”

Yin Changsheng’s expression changed once more. As Little Snow spat out more wind blades, the flame energy in the world grew increasingly powerful.

The wind rose, disturbing the void. All the world’s wind energy was slowly affected by Little Snow. After being set in motion, there was no stopping the current.

As Little Snow continued to unleash wind blades, it was like stoking the fire. The flames grew increasingly intense as the astral winds formed a giant maelstrom around Little Snow.

Yin Changsheng had shattered over ten wind blades when a wind blade suddenly cut across his cheek, leaving a large cut on his face. Even his protective divine light was unable to block it.

Yin Changsheng finally shuddered as he looked at the maelstrom around him. The next moment, he roared and stabbed his spear through this twisted space.

BOOM!

After shattering some wind blades, the spear passed through the maelstrom and continued toward Little Snow. Yin Changsheng was finally afraid after he saw how terrifying this move was.

Little Snow’s maelstrom had yet to fully form but already possessed such terrifying power. If it fully formed, there was no way to imagine just how powerful it would be. Hence, without hesitation, Yin Changsheng unleashed the power of his manifestation in a full-power blow to interrupt it.

BOOM!

To everyone’s surprise, it was Mo Nian’s arrow that intercepted Yin Changsheng’s attack. A rare serious expression could be seen on his face.

“Little Snow, guard Long Chen. Leave this fellow to me.”

Little Snow was planning on fighting Yin Changsheng, but seeing Mo Nian come, it rushed to Long Chen’s side. After all, countless experts were now assaulting the Dragonblood Legion, and Long Chen’s safety was the most important thing.

At this time, Meng Qi, the Pill Fairy, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others had pulled back their defensive line. Rather than fighting for themselves, they had to focus on an absolute defense around Long Chen.

Right now, an extremely brilliant golden light was coming out of Long Chen that even Mo Nian’s coffin became see-through. They could see that Long Chen was absorbing the third true dragon rune.

When Long Chen started absorbing the third rune, the remaining five slowly dissipated. People guessed that Long Chen had felt that he didn’t have enough time, and so he had chosen to absorb the three most important runes, abandoning the other ones. By incinerating them, they aided his absorption rate.

Based on his previous speed, he shouldn’t have even finished absorbing the second rune by now. Yet, to everyone’s astonishment, he was already on the third one. Once this rune was absorbed, Long Chen would probably come out.

It wasn’t just Meng Qi and the others who took notice. Countless experts also noticed this, and a sense of urgency gripped them, making their attacks become even more frantic.

At this moment, Little Snow returned to the defensive line and began unleashing wind blade after wind blade. As countless experts were slashed apart by those giant wind blades, their blood filled the ground and air. Its killing power was astonishing.

BOOM!

Suddenly, in the distance, a giant explosion occurred and another giant figure came tumbling out. When Meng Qi saw that figure, her expression completely changed.

“Cloud!”

It was Cloud who was sent flying backward, her body bearing the weight of a grievous wound on her chest. It was vaguely possible to see the beating of her heart through it.

“Everyone, watch out! Shi Yang has changed!” warned Cloud.

Within the shrouds of ominous black qi, Shi Yang's sinister figure materialized, leaving onlookers in awe. What astonished them even more was the fact that his aura had intensified several times over, surpassing his previous strength. The golden horn atop his head gleamed radiantly, resembling a resplendent sun. He seemed to have transformed into a different being.

“He killed countless experts of the devil race as a life sacrifice to him!” shouted Cloud.

“Hahaha, all of you can die now! I’m no longer holding back!”

Shi Yang laughed and unleashed a single claw. In that instant, a giant claw-image covered everyone, and a sensation of death crashed down on all of them.
