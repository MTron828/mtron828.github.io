Chapter 2373 Coughing Up Blood from Anger

Translator: BornToBe

“It’s Sound Explosion Light Bombs!” Ye Lingfeng roared furiously when he recognized what the blinding light was, as well as recognizing that the hateful voice came from Long Chen.

He had given up the first line in order to draw the demonic beasts into a narrow opening between two spatial cracks. Those spatial cracks contained the terrifying wills of two experts who had once fought to the death here. Despite the time that had passed, their wills remained.

Thanks to the erosion of those two wills, this place had a special effect on other people’s wills. By putting bewitching smoke here, it was possible to make even powerful demonic beasts collapse.

“Bastards, you’re stealing our spoils of war!” Everyone from the third legion was enraged.

The Sound Explosion Light Bombs were especially effective in this place. The demonic beasts would lose their hearing and sight temporarily, and their souls would become sluggish for just a breath’s time. But that effect was amplified by the smoke. Clearly, Long Chen had included it all in his calculations.

As for the third legion, the smoke continued to block their path, making Ye Lingfeng so furious that he felt like he might explode.

“Those bastards! Kill them all! Use our long-range attacks to clear out the battlefield!” roared Ye Lingfeng.

“Commander, we can’t. How are we supposed to explain ourselves if we kill them?” The vice commanders and the others all jumped.

Although it was possible for them to bully the eighth legion, they definitely couldn’t kill them. The killer would definitely be executed. After all, this was a competition amongst members of the divine families, and it had restrictions. Killing each other was not permitted.

Ye Lingfeng simply continued to curse. They had lost their first line of defense, sacrificed their arrow towers, exposed their secret trump card, and the moment for them to reap the harvest had been taken by others.

The bewitching smoke had yet to scatter, so he didn’t dare to go over. Most hateful of all, he heard the voices coming from the other side.

“Our eighth legion will not sit by while our comrades are killed! We will fight together for the divine families!”

“Even if we have to sacrifice our lives, it doesn’t matter. When our brothers are in trouble, we must assist them. This is our duty.”

“Although some people are inhuman, would we be so petty as to quarrel with such little people? We will show everyone what it means to repay enmity with kindness.”

“Brothers of the third legion, don’t worry. We’ll risk our lives to hold back your enemies! You must flee!”

These were all phrases that Long Chen had come up and rehearsed with the eighth legion. Yes, they were extremely moving.

Ye Lingfeng's vision darkened. He almost fainted. The warriors around him cried out in shock.

“Commander, are you alright?!”

Ye Lingfeng’s face was twisted into a frightening expression. He was hysterical. “Long Chen, you’ll pay the price for your foolish actions!”

“Aiya, commander Ye Lingfeng, why are you shouting like a rabid dog? We risked our lives to come help you, but instead of thanking us, you act so hostile? It truly makes a person’s heart cold.”

Long Chen’s voice came from within the smoke, and Ye Lingfeng didn’t even have the power to retort. He suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“Commander!”

“Aiya, commander Ye, your moral character is far too narrow! How could someone with so little ability and such a bad temperament be a commander? It really is inconceivable.” Long Chen’s voice rang out once more. Ye Lingfeng began to spasm.

“Quick, place the commander in the chariot and block out all sounds!”

The vice commanders were pale. Ye Lingfeng was showing signs of becoming bedeviled. If Long Chen said any more, he might just die from anger.

One of the commanders clapped Ye Lingfeng in the back of his head, causing him to faint. They brought him into the carriage and isolated him from the sounds of the outside world.

“Long Chen, you son of a bitch, you are openly stealing our spoils! We’ll report this to the Heaven Executioner! And the eighth legion, you really are idiots. Are you not afraid of our reprisal?!” cursed the vice commander that had previously taunted Long Chen and Shen Chengfeng.

Long Chen had truly been vicious this time. Even with their powerful fortifications, they had still lost over seventy warriors, as well as the arrow towers and the camp.

If Long Chen hadn’t come, then killing these demonic beasts would have allowed them to make up for some of their losses. But Long Chen had actually come to take their painfully won fruit.

Long Chen didn’t respond. Instead, Shen Chengfeng sneered, “How laughable. Your reprisal? When did the eighth legion provoke you into causing us to lose our camp? Why weren’t you afraid of our reprisal? Now that you forced us to the point of no return, why aren’t we allowed our vengeance?”

“Cough, this isn’t vengeance. Yes, we are in no way admitting to that. We came to save you. Yes, that’s it,” corrected Long Chen. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Shen Chengfeng had slipped up due to his anger. Sometimes rules really were a case of burying one’s head in the sand, but there was still no choice. Long Chen’s meaning was clear. Yes, they had come for vengeance, but they weren’t admitting to it. What could you do about that?

“Brothers, kill! Protect our brothers of the third legion! Even if we have to fight to the death, we won’t hesitate!” shouted Long Chen.

Arrows rained down on those demonic beasts that were lying powerless on the ground from the bewilderment smoke and Sound Explosion Light Bombs.

The eighth legion’s warriors were holding giant crossbows. It took over ten people to carry each one, but they were shooting crazily.

The ones who had charged to the front were amongst the strongest members of the demon race. As for the ones at the rear, they had fled. As a result, the only things to shoot were essentially live targets. They were quickly killed.

Although these crossbows had been taken out of the arrow towers and so they weren’t as powerful without it as a base, the good thing was that they were mobile and still possessed enough power to kill the demonic beasts.

The eighth legion’s warriors had never had such a successful operation. Some of them were tasked with cleaning up the battlefield, and they quickly picked up the corpses.

After all, those corpses were money. A torrent of money was entering their pockets with every blink.

“Hurry, the effect of the Sound Explosion Light Bombs is about to fade,” urged Long Chen.

The problem wasn’t that the demonic beasts would awaken. The problem was that the bewildering smoke would return while they were in the midst of cleaning up the battlefield. Then they would also be affected.

“Those corpses aren’t yours!” demanded one of the vice commanders. Based on the rules, they couldn’t take what they hadn’t killed.

“Who said that they weren’t ours? Any corpse with one of our arrows on it is ours,” said Long Chen innocently.

The eighth legion’s warriors’ eyes brightened. That was true. Even if they didn’t kill the corpse, they just had to make it look like they had.

“Hurry, hurry!” pressed Long Chen.

If Long Chen gave them a medicinal pill to eat, it would have been possible for them to resist the effect of the smoke. But he didn’t want to use his own power. He wanted to use the power of the eighth legion to con Ye Lingfeng.

“Ah, there’s no need to be miserly. Let’s go.” When the battlefield was essentially cleaned up and Long Chen saw some of them looking for pieces of corpses in the ground, he shook his head. Long Chen was truly experiencing just how poor the eight legion was and their habits. “Brothers of the third legion, through our bloody battle, our tenacious effort, the spilling of our blood, we’ve finally managed to help you stop your enemies. You’re safe now and can come out of hiding. There’s no need to thank us with a meal, as we’ll be going now.” The eighth legion’s warriors cried out in unison and then left.

An hour later, the bewildering smoke faded. The third legion’s warriors charged through the narrow pass. Up to a certain point, there were still a few corpses left behind for them. But eventually, it was like the battlefield had been severed with a knife, and everything on the other side was gone.

“Damn Long Chen, damn Shen Chengfeng! Just wait!”

Ye Lingfeng had just woken up. He saw that fewer than a tenth of the corpses remained. Ninety percent of the spoils had fallen into Long Chen’s hands. He was so furious that he once more coughed up a mouthful of blood.
