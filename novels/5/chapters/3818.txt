Chapter 3807 Heavenly Tomb

The flying boat slowly flew through the air, and only Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian were in the rear room. Yue Xiaoqian was nestled against Long Chen’s chest with a warm smile.

Yue Xiaoqian narrated what had happened to her after ascending. She had directly landed in the original devil race’s ancestral land, obtaining the original devil race’s most complete inheritance.

With her divine seal, she could even suppress experts like Shi Yang. In her peak condition, someone like Shi Yang would not even be able to flee from her.

This time, it was only because she had used up a great deal of her energy on other devil experts and had been attacked by other races, resulting in her being at a disadvantage.

Even surrounded by the devil race, she hadn’t been in any real danger. It was only when the people of the Nine Underworld Hall, Bloodkill Hall, and Sacred Pill Hall came that the pressure increased. Fortunately, Xia Chen and Guo Ran directly rushed over. Otherwise, she would have been in danger.

Long Chen also told her about his journey in the immortal world. As soon as he mentioned that he had seen Yu Qingxuan, Yue Xiaoqian sat up in delight.

Back in the Martial Heaven Continent’s final battle, Yu Qingxuan had sacrificed herself to take the blade that would have killed Long Chen. She then died right in front of him. Yue Xiaoqian and the others were all heartbroken when they saw that.

It was only later that they knew Yu Qingxuan had actually sacrificed so much for Long Chen. She had gone through reincarnation after reincarnation for him. Such deep feelings made them feel great admiration for her.

Thus, Yue Xiaoqian was especially delighted when she heard of Yu Qingxuan. Yue Xiaoqian immediately said, “Long Chen, this time, you have to treat big sister Qingxuan properly. Don’t let her suffer any pain again.”

“Don’t worry. I won’t.” Long Chen nodded. In this lifetime, he would treat her as well as he could.

“Speaking of which, is that Bai Shishi your new lover in the immortal world?” asked Yue Xiaoqian with a smile.

Long Chen instantly blushed and nodded awkwardly. “She should count as one.”

Yue Xiaoqian laughed. “Don’t worry, I’m just asking a few questions. I’m not Wan-er. I won’t pinch you.”

Hearing this, Long Chen was further embarrassed, but there was nothing he could do. In truth, he had intentionally maintained a distance from Bai Shishi. But later, they still ended up together.

Love was truly something unrivaled. No matter how high your cultivation base or talent, there was no beating it.

“Just Bai Shishi alone?” asked Yue Xiaoqian.

“Just one, I promise!” said Long Chen solemnly.

“Hehe, what are you so nervous about? Someone like you who is wild, outstanding, and dangerous is especially attractive to women. To only gain one new lover after all this time, you must have held back as much as you could,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

Long Chen bitterly smiled. “This praise makes me feel ashamed. Doesn’t a real man try to be faithful to just one spouse in their life? Sometimes, I even look down on myself for falling in love with more than one person. To marry a single one of you is a fortune for multiple lifetimes. So, to love so many of you, I feel like I’m sinning. I really do feel guilty toward all of you.”

“Fool, what guilt? Do you know when I fell in love with you?” asked Yue Xiaoqian softly, caressing his cheek.

“If I say that I don’t, will I be beaten?” asked Long Chen awkwardly because he really didn’t know.

Yue Xiaoqian glared at him. “When have I ever beaten you? Back in the Jiuli secret realm, you refused to leave despite staring death in the face, placing your body between death and me. It was then that I knew that my fate was set. You used your life to protect me. That is fatal to any woman, and there’s no cure. Just how many women can resist someone mysterious, wild, domineering, and also willing to sacrifice his life to protect them? The only thing I find strange is that you only ended up with one. Based on my expectations, you should have gained just as many women as on the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Yue Xiaoqian while covering a smile.

The more Long Chen heard, the guiltier he felt. He even had the urge to cry. His women truly treated him well, so well that not even ten thousand deaths would be enough to repay them.

The two of them talked a bit more before leaving the rear room and joining the others. As for Mo Nian, he was currently gesturing enthusiastically to Xia Chen and Guo Ran in another room, sketching out a diagram.

“Trust me, this is definitely some big business to gain! Furthermore, this treasure definitely has a destiny with us! Our union is so sharp that we can cut metal! We can definitely do this. If we do, we’ll have a lifetime of pleasures awaiting us!”

Seeing Mo Nian solemnly acting as if he was conning them, Yue Xiaoqian couldn’t help laughing. This fellow’s combat power was truly terrifying. He was actually able to fight on par with the Sacred Pill Hall’s heir, and yet he acted like a swindler on the streets without the slightest air of an expert.

“Let’s ignore whether or not we can have a lifetime of pleasure. First, I want to know if you can teach me how to be a poser like you!” exclaimed Guo Ran. He was completely won over by how flashy Mo Nian had been this time, and he was incredibly envious. “Oh, can you come up with some lines for me too? Let alone some tomb, I’ll go through mountains of blades and pools of boiling oil for you!”

“No problem! Between brothers, it’s nothing!” Mo Nian patted his chest.

Only then did he take note that Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian had arrived. Mo Nian then pointed at the diagram.

“You came at the right time. We’re studying the plan. This tomb is not human-made. It’s a heavenly tomb.”

“What is a heavenly tomb?” asked Guo Ran.

Unexpectedly, it was Yue Xiaoqian who said, “A heavenly tomb refers to when the Heavenly Daos are unwilling to allow the corpses of peerless experts to lie in the wilderness. The earth splits open, the heavens collapse, and a special world is formed for them to rest in. However, Heavenly tombs are very dangerous and will very likely produce evil corpses. Those so-called evil corpses are experts whose soul essence refuses to dissipate and their physical bodies refuse to die. Once they are awoken, they usually cause a calamity in the world of the living. Think this through.”

“No need to worry. I’ve checked over the heavenly tomb. It sits in the north, facing the south. Contrary to most Yin tombs, it is actually a Yang tomb and is overflowing with Yang Qi. There’s not much chance that evil corpses will appear. Furthermore, there are nine dragon veins around it, forming the nine dragon spirit containment manifestation. The Heavenly Daos wish for those lifeforms to rest in peace. We’re only plundering the wealth, not the corpses. As long as we don’t touch the bodies, everything will be safe,” said Mo Nian confidently.

Hearing that, Yue Xiaoqian nodded. It seemed that she agreed with Mo Nian’s opinion. With that, this plan was finalized.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Stop the flying boat for an inspection!”

Just as their flying boat was about to reach Silver Moon City, giant siege crossbows appeared and pointed at Guo Ran’s flying boat.
