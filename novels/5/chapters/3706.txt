Chapter 3695 The Asura Race’s Spirit Calling Art

The Nine Underworld Luocha’s aura was completely different from before. Her aura was colder, without the slightest emotion.

Her eyes in particular were different. There were blood-colored spots inside of them now. When those spots were looking at someone, that person would feel like their soul was about to be torn out of their body.

When Long Chen encountered the Nine Underworld Luocha last time, she was still a human. Now, other than her human form, she was not a human at all.

The current her was a humanoid lifeform filled with a dark and sinister murderous aura. She was like a completely different person.

“You said the same thing last time, but I still beat you like a dog. If they didn’t save you, you’d already be dead,” sneered Long Chen.

“Shut your mouth! At that time, I had yet to awaken the Asura bloodline and wasn’t a true member of the Asura race. But now it’s different. I’ve awakened my Supreme Bone, and my bloodline has completely changed. I am no longer an inferior human. And you, you will die at my hands,” sneered the Nine Underworld Luocha.

“What a joke. You were originally a human. Even if you’ve awakened the Asura bloodline, you remain human. You’ve forgotten yourself, turning yourself into a beast. As expected, considering the person raising you. You’re just as foolish as your master. Your master is a far cry from Enpuda, and you are a far cry from Ji Wuming.” Long Chen shook his head disdainfully.

“Bullshit! Who do you think you are to judge my Asura race? If he dared to run wild in the three thousand worlds, I would kill him just like you!” The Nine Underworld Luocha glanced at Ji Wuming with derision.

Ji Wuming narrowed his eyes. Her words were extremely displeasing. He was about to speak when Enpuda stopped him.

“When the three thousand worlds open, there will be countless monsters. Supreme geniuses will be everywhere, so that will be the time for everyone to show their divine abilities. Saying vicious words now is only inviting humiliation. Don’t get embarrassed when you’re beaten up by other heavenly geniuses. In any case, fighting here means nothing and will only cause you to be laughed at by others. The truth will come out in the three thousand worlds!”

After that, Enpuda looked at Long Chen. “Brother Long Chen, perhaps this will be our last time speaking with each other. To tell the truth, I really admire you. You are brave and fearless but also meticulous. Most importantly, you have a solid conviction. Once you decide on your target, you throw everything at it. You don’t let any obstacles rattle your determination. I know I have no power to draw you over, so I have always been hoping to give you a direct referral to Divine Venerate Brahma. Perhaps only Divine Venerate Brahma is qualified to talk you around. Regretfully, fate has other plans. You’ve committed a grave taboo. Even the Divine Venerate will not be able to forgive you. Thus, the next time we meet, I will make sure that you die. There will be no escape then. Everyone calls me the despicable Killing God for a reason, and this name isn’t for nothing.”

Everyone was surprised by this speech from Enpuda. It seemed to contain a strange sympathy that people were unable to comprehend.

“Many thanks for the warning. Since fate always has other plans, let’s just listen to fate. On the way to the peak of the martial path, everyone has different positions. It’s simply impossible to come to a conclusion through reason, so there can only be a conclusion through weapons. To put it frankly, this is a world where the person with the bigger fist is the one deciding who is right. Although I, Long Chen, am young, I have fought countless battles. As for you, you are definitely one of the enemies that causes me the most trouble in this lifetime. Although I loathe you, there are some areas in which I admire you. Let us not say more words and simply meet on the battlefield. In the three thousand worlds, I will first kill your disciple. Later on, we can settle our enmities,” said Long Chen.

It went without saying that despite Enpuda’s despicable qualities, his sinister schemes were quite brilliant. He was a very difficult opponent to deal with. Even Long Chen had almost lost his life to him several times. Right now, Enpuda was his most dangerous opponent.

“You’re the only one who’s going to die in the three thousand worlds!”

The Nine Underworld Luocha and Ji Wuming shouted at the same time. The two of them then glared at each other. Killing intent burst out of these two young apex assassins.

In truth, the two of them were fated enemies. One was a peak expert of the Bloodkill Hall, and the other was the future hope of the Nine Underworld Island. There would definitely be a battle between the two of them. But although the two of them could decide who was stronger between them, they couldn’t decide who could die.

It didn’t matter how much enmity there was between their masters; it didn’t matter how much enmity there was between themselves. They were all disciples that Lord Brahma had set his sights on, so they would not be allowed to kill each other.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was precisely due to this that they didn’t dare to be too ruthless. But using other means to beat each other down and vent was allowed.

Enpuda didn’t say anything in response. He simply smiled slightly and brought his disciples away.

Seeing Enpuda leave, Liao Bencang left behind some vicious words before also leaving. Only the Nine Underworld Luocha eyed Long Chen, seemingly unwilling to let him off. But she was dragged away by Liao Bencang.

“Be careful of that fatty. His scheming ability is frighteningly deep.” Xia Guhong watched as Enpuda left.

“Big brother, don’t worry. I won’t be careless.” Long Chen nodded.

However, although that was what he said, he felt a bit helpless inside. Currently, his greatest weakness was that he was lacking time.

If he had ample time, couldn’t he simply scheme back at Enpuda? When had he ever been afraid of fighting in this regard? The main thing was that he didn’t have time to be playing schemes and setting up traps.

His limited time was spent entirely on cultivation. There was no time to play schemes as that would definitely slow down his cultivation. In the end, it wasn’t worth it. Thus, the old man’s words were true even in the immortal world.

“Other than that, also be wary of that girl,” warned Xia Guhong.

“Oh? I didn’t feel that she was stronger than Ji Wuming.” Long Chen was a bit surprised.

“In terms of power, perhaps not. But she has awakened the Asura bloodline. Other than being able to summon the Luocha Possession, you have to be careful of forcing her to use the Spirit Calling Art,” said Xia Guhong.

“What’s that?” asked Guo Ran. This was his first time hearing of it.

Xia Guhong explained, “The immortal world’s spirit link beasts can be summoned even through the wall of the heavens. She might not have the power to use the Asura race’s Spirit Calling Art yet, but once she becomes an Immortal King and condenses a Heavenly Dao Crown, she will have that ability. If she doesn’t use that technique, she probably isn’t a match for Ji Wuming. But once she does, who knows what kind of existence she will summon from the Asura world? The Asura race’s Spirit Calling Art doesn't simply summon contractual beasts. She can summon whatever fits the situation. Moreover, the beasts that she summons will be in the same realm as her, but their power would not be inferior to hers. They might even be stronger.”

“That powerful?”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were amazed. To be able to summon a beast even stronger than herself, if they joined forces, who would be able to fight her?
