Chapter 3307 Utmost Righteousness

Long Chen’s knee smashed into that person’s face, and a crunching noise rang out, filling the plaza.

That person let out a painful grunt, his face covered in blood and caving in. But Long Chen still didn’t let him off. Still holding his hair, Long Chen repeatedly struck him with his knee.

He tried to escape, but Long Chen didn’t give him any chance. After Long Chen was done hitting this person with his knee, he finished off with some slaps. Those smacks resounded throughout the plaza clearly, making Bai Shishi’s expression change.

It was forbidden to use martial might in this place, so no one dared to fight here. Otherwise, they would be viewed as the enemy of the entire Heavenly Rainbow Domain. The Immortal Fairy Plaza was a sacred place that could not be blasphemed.

For Long Chen to attack in a place like this instantly stunned everyone.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Isn’t that the Seven Sea Domain’s Yang Zicong? He’s being beaten up.”

“Yang Zicong is definitely trash, and his petty nature is infamous. But he’s still one of the Seven Sea Domain’s peak heavenly geniuses. With that power and background, no one has dared to provoke him. Who would have thought that someone would be beating him up here?”

“Who is that black-robed fellow? He probably doesn’t know who Yang Zicong is, or he definitely wouldn’t dare to do this.”

“That black-robed fellow… Heavens, isn’t that Long Chen that has been causing an uproar lately?!”

“Long Chen?!”

Hearing his name, everyone was shaken. The fact that Long Chen had gone to the Yuhua Palace and slain their top genius, Jiang Baihe, exposing the fact that the latter was an underworld ghost seed, had caused huge waves. That was partially due to the profound terror people felt toward underworld ghost seeds and also because Jiang Baihe had been one of the top geniuses of the Heavenly Star Domain. For Long Chen to have gone to his sect and killed him, no one could question his power.

Afterward, a rumor that Long Chen was very likely an underworld ghost seed as well spread. True experts didn’t really believe in random rumors, but in any case, Long Chen’s name was firmly imprinted in their minds now.

After a detailed investigation, they learned that Long Chen was actually an ascender with no background to rely on. Using his own power, he had joined his sect as a worker and still managed to reach his current level, becoming the dual champion of the Heavenly Swell Domain’s Nine Prefecture Convention. People were very curious whether or not a lower plane ascender could really be so powerful.

However, now that they saw Long Chen beating up Yang Zicong like some ruffian, the lack of any air of an expert made them question whether he really was such a powerful expert.

After gaining this opportunity, Long Chen didn’t let go of the initiative, and his opponent couldn’t even manage to get away. As he beat him up, he shouted, “You bastard, how dare you say such disgraceful words in front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy?! You’ve blasphemed the fairy. Even ten thousand deaths aren’t enough to wash away your sins-!”

“Stop!”

The disturbance here had alarmed the Immortal Kings standing guard over this place. Hence, six Immortal Kings descended at the same time. They were all infuriated, looking as if they wanted to directly kill Long Chen and Yang Zicong.

They were the loyal protectors of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. Anyone who dared to show any disrespect to her would not be treated with any courtesy from them.

Six Immortal Kings had descended at once, and their immense pressure shook people’s souls. These experts didn’t even dare to move.

“I won’t stop! This person has blasphemed the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy! I cannot tolerate such a thing! The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy sacrificed her precious life for the survival of the human race, and her holiness cannot be blasphemed. If I didn’t want to dirty this holy land, I would slaughter this bastard right now! But even if I can’t kill him, I must turn him into a meat cake so that he remembers this lesson and tells others that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy cannot be blasphemed. If you feel that I’m going too far, you can kill me as well. To be able to bring down a blasphemer of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy with me, I could die with no regrets!” Long Chen cried out righteously. Even in the face of these Immortal Kings, he didn’t stop striking Yang Zicong.

Long Chen then reached out and pressed a finger against Yang Zicong’s BaiHui acupuncture point. That was a fatal weak spot, no different from the space between one’s eyebrows.

As long as Long Chen unleashed his divine energy here, Yang Zicong would definitely die. Yang Zicong had never dreamed that Long Chen would dare to attack him and even press down on such a threatening spot. He was unable to unleash any of his abilities. 

Long Chen’s righteous air and fervent desire for justice left those six Immortal Kings dumbfounded. No matter how furious they were, they wouldn’t kill someone who was respecting the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

However, Long Chen had struck someone in this place, a place where fighting was forbidden. What about propriety? It was damaging to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s dignity.

“Young friend, let’s take a step back now and talk. Even if he did act wrongly, you cannot be said to be right in beating him here. Furthermore, beating someone like this is also a poor act. Give this old man some face. Right and wrong can be discussed impartially,” said one of the Immortal Kings.

Only then did Long Chen indignantly stop. It was unknown if it was fake or if he was really angry, but his body was quivering.

Bai Shishi almost laughed. This fellow’s acting skills were truly amazing. This was clearly the result of him not having anywhere to vent his anger at being pinched by her, so he was using Yang Zicong to vent. But he even put on such an aggrieved and indignant appearance.

“Die!”

As soon as Long Chen released Yang Zicong and the latter regained his freedom, Yang Zicong instinctively took out his weapon and attacked Long Chen.

As a result, just as he took out his weapon, an Immortal King pressed a hand against his shoulder. He became unable to even move an inch. “How brazen! You dare to use a weapon in front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy?!”

It was forbidden to reveal weapons in front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue. This was known to all within the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. No one in this domain could accept such a thing.

As for Yang Zicong, after being beaten by Long Chen, his head was completely muddled and his senses were in chaos. He wasn’t even aware of the descent of the Immortal Kings. As for Long Chen, he seemed to have expected this, and he immediately jumped out and slapped him in the face again.

Considering that Yang Zicong couldn’t even move, there was no way he could dodge. Well, he wouldn’t have been able to dodge even if he could move. This slap then knocked him unconscious. It was unknown if it was from the slap or from the bottled-up rage.

“Just look, this fellow doesn’t have the slightest respect or gratitude for the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. When it comes to such a person, how can you not beat him up?” declared Long Chen righteously.

“Bring this fellow away. Whether he lives or not will be up to his own fortune,” said one of the Immortal Kings angrily. Someone immediately came up and dragged away the unconscious Yang Zicong.

After Yang Zicong was brought away, the six Immortal Kings turned to Long Chen. Their expressions were not all that friendly.
