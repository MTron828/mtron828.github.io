Chapter 4564 Star Lines

Xie Fei seemed to have come prepared. Divine light flowed around the manifestation of a divine statue behind him, signifying that Xie Fei was at full power

Having previously fought Long Chen and suffered, he harbored a deep grudge, desiring nothing more than to tear Long Chen apart.

While Long Chen had managed to trick the mixed beast race about his power, he couldn’t deceive Xie Fei. The latter was well aware that Long Chen’s true power was not what it had appeared to be. That was why Xie Fei had been holding back until Long Chen took off his mask.

Long Chen also didn’t dare to be reckless against such a powerful enemy. He directly activated his Seven Star Battle Armor and divine ring, coating a layer of starlight on the blade of his saber. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

BOOM!

The collision of the two divine weapons unleashed shockwaves that rent the world asunder. At the same time, brilliant divine light exploded like a sun, blinding everyone and disrupting their spiritual perception.

A giant vortex appeared in the ground, accompanied by a flurry of Grand Dao runes swirling outward in all directions.

“Get behind me!” Feng You shouted. Her golden spear grew and pierced the ground, shielding them like a giant pole in front of them.

Feng You had barely erected her defense before a terrifying astral wind blasted them. She then spread her wings, causing a golden light of protection to flow around her. However, the terrifying force almost broke her wings.

The astral wind was like blades cutting across her cheeks. The mixed beast race’s experts just huddled tightly behind her, bitterly enduring thanks to Feng You’s protection.

Some factions were too slow to react on time, and the astral winds blew them back. They were unable to stabilize themselves in this space.

BOOM!

Long Chen and Xie Fei clashed once again, their exchange resonating with a deafening boom. Their forces were even greater than before.

BOOM!

As a result, another formidable shockwave ripped through the void, sending both Long Chen and Xie Fei staggering backward.

Feng You could only stare at Long Chen in awe. It was only now that she truly grasped the terrifying extent of his power.

“You damn human, so you have some ability, but I’ve gone through the Corrupt God’s baptism and have fully awakened my Heavenly Doyen power. You are nothing but a slightly stronger ant in my presence!”

Divine light materialized on the back of Xie Fei’s head, forming seven stars that streaked like shooting stars, leaving long tails behind. As these stars flowed, the power of heaven and earth gathered, and the myriad Daos and laws converged. Xie Fei seemed to become the master of this world, where one thought from him could give rise to life or extinguish it.

“How can this be?!” exclaimed Feng You, staring at those stars behind Xie Fei’s head. “Long Chen, watch out! He has awoken the Doyen Stars! It’s like he has awakened a portion of a Divine Venerate’s power in advance!”

“Foolish and filthy mixed beast woman, so you know about this. But so what? It will take a while for the gate to fully open. I have enough time to kill all of you,” sneered Xie Fei, his scythe spinning through the air and pointing at Long Chen. His killing intent locked onto him.

However, Long Chen showed no hint of panic at all. He simply rested his saber on his shoulder, coldly looking at Xie Fei. “Seven-star Heavenly Doyen? Gaining a portion of a Divine Venerate’s power in advance? Then it seems I have to be a bit more serious.”

“Foolish fellow, you still dare to talk big at this time.”

At this moment, Xie Fei’s seven stars twinkled, and he suddenly vanished. But to everyone’s surprise, once he was gone, the Corrupt God manifestation remained in its original location.

Long Chen simply swung his hand, exuding ripples that exploded midair and forced a figure flying back with a slap. When the surrounding experts saw who it was, startled cries rang out. It was Xie Fei.

“Idiot. After leaving the range of your Corrupt God statue, you cannot lock me down. I see that you have awakened your star lines in advance and have greater Heavenly Doyen energy now, but the energy of the Corrupt God affects this power. The power of a fish and a bear cannot mix. You’ve indeed gained more power but have to sacrifice other power to use it.” Long Chen swung out his slightly numb hand indifferently.

Even though Long Chen appeared calm, he was actually shocked. The power of this slap should have crushed half of Xie Fei’s face. However, his power mysteriously vanished, as if blocked by some other power. It was as if the world’s power helped Xie Fei to block this attack.

Thus, even though the slap sent Xie Fei flying, he wasn’t injured. This was what surprised Long Chen. After condensing these star lines, Xie Fei had become stronger.

Although Xie Fei wasn’t physically injured, Long Chen's slap had struck with the force of his astral energy, leaving Xie Fei’s head buzzing and feeling as though stars were spinning around him. He staggered under the impact.

By the time he recovered, he saw countless peak experts casting odd gazes his way, which instantly fueled his rage, causing his eyes to turn blood-red.

“I’ll tear your corpse to pieces!”

Long Chen had slapped him in the face last time, which had left him so humiliated he wanted to die. However, this slap was even worse. Compared to the wound to the physical body, the damage to the mind was far worse. That was especially true this time since all the peak experts of their world were here.

He would rather die than suffer this kind of humiliation, so he went insane.

Once again, the manifestation of the Corrupt God appeared behind him. With the star lines swirling behind his head, Xie Fei launched another attack. This time, he locked on Long Chen once more.

Long Chen realized that the source of this lock wasn’t Xie Fei but rather the will of the Corrupt God. So, he ignited his saber with starlight again.

“Let me see just how much skill you have!”

“Die!”

Long Chen and Xie Fei shot at each other at the same time, their weapons slashing in unison as if they were in a suicidal pact.

These two divine weapons transformed into enormous heavenly images, crazily clashing with each other. Long Chen and Xie Fei then vanished from view, leaving behind only the echoing clash of their divine weapons and the frenzied howl of berserk killing intent.

Just as they were fighting, a golden figure shot over like a shooting star—it was that golden monkey with violet pupils!

“Darn humans, this king doesn’t have time for the two of you. Since you’ve offended the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race, you should just hurry up and die!”

Feng You and the others were shocked to hear the violet-pupil golden monkey speaking human language.
