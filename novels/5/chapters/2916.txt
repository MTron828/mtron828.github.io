Chapter 2905 Fighting Spirit Items

“He activated the power of his Spirit item?! Is he really trying to kill her?!” The spectating disciples were stunned.

Spirit items were normally only capable of being controlled by Divine Flame experts, but Mortal Transcendence experts could also activate them with some special means.

As for Gu Fei, he seemed to have activated his Spirit item with his bloodline power. Hence, the spectators’ hearts clenched.

The Spirit item had completely locked onto Mu Qingyun. There was no running away, nor was there anyone who could help her. Some disciples even closed their eyes, unable to bear watching.

In the face of Gu Fei’s attack, Mu Qingyun took a deep breath. Her gaze grew sharper and determined. She murmured, “Brother San said the heart wields the sword, and the sword has a soul and a will. I have the sword, the sword has me. A sword cultivator knows no fear. A sword cultivator has nothing that they cannot cut. Heaven, hell, laws, Daos, all untold dangers, all binding shackles, they are to be broken by the sword.”

Every single one of her words contained her staunch will. There was an unbreaking determination in her words.

In that instant, the world seemed to turn still. The head judge, Heaven Master Yun Yang, Heaven Master Dong Ming, and a few other experts all stared in shock.

Mu Qingyun’s current cultivation base wasn’t even worth mentioning in front of them. But this determination she revealed—along with the merger of the body and the Dao that occurred when she spoke, as if she was merging with the very heavens—deeply moved them.

“As long as she doesn’t die, her future prospects are limitless,” murmured the head judge.

“Long Chen really is a miraculous existence.” Heaven Master Yun Yang looked at Long Chen who was still rushing back to the core. As a Heaven Master, he was fully convinced by Long Chen’s methods.

Just at this moment, Mu Qingyun’s sword shuddered. No runes lit up, and no manifestation of the heavens appeared. But in that instant, her sword seemed to come to life.

The sharp will of the Sword Dao erupted. Even through the formation, everyone felt that sharpness.

Just at that moment, Mu Qingyun’s sword met Gu Fei’s Spirit sword.

BOOM!

Runes exploded. Mu Qingyun and Gu Fei were blown back at the same time and coughed up blood.

“They’re actually evenly matched.”

“Mu Qingyun only has an ordinary sword, but she received the full-power attack of a Spirit item!”

“Heavens, just how did she do this?!”

Countless people were stunned by this. That attack by Mu Qingyun was absolutely marvelous.

Mu Qingyun and Gu Fei were blown back a dozen steps. The next moment, Gu Fei forcibly stabilized himself and suddenly began to vomit blood.

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Gu Fei’s Spirit item split in two.

A Spirit item had actually been severed by an ordinary sword? How could that be possible?

It was like a paper knife and a steel knife clashed, only for the steel knife to be cut apart. It was inconceivable.

Just at this moment, Mu Qingyun’s own sword began to crack, until it was covered in cracks and shattered into dust.

A sword of ordinary metal and a divine weapon had actually destroyed each other. This result was unbelievable.

Mu Qingyun also turned pale as paper at this moment, followed by an unhealthy redness appearing on her cheeks. Clearly, she had also paid an immense price for this.

“AHHH!” Suddenly, Gu Fei screamed. His forehead split open and blood dripped out. Moreover, his eyes turned scarlet like he had been bedeviled.

“Mu Qingyun, I will tear you to pieces!”

Gu Fei had activated his Spirit item with his bloodline power. Hence, with his sword broken, his bloodline power also received a backlash. Almost half of the inheritance runes within his ancestral blood were gone.

In other words, this one attack from Mu Qingyun gravely damaged his Dao foundation. In the future, he might very well be no longer able to inherit the innate divine abilities of his family.

When he thought of this, hatred overflowed from Gu Fei. He agreed to help Chu Kuang because his family had received a letter from the Chu family asking for it. The Chu family not only brought up some business collaborations between them, but they also promised a reward that was extremely enticing to Gu Fei.

The pressure from his family and the great rewards were why Gu Fei had abandoned defeating Luo Bing and his chance at fame.

However, he had never imagined that in his fight against Mu Qingyun, not only would his Spirit item be destroyed, but even his bloodline runes were damaged. That was something completely unacceptable. It meant that the highest realm he would ever reach was the Divine Flame realm. He would never ascend to the Four Peak realm.

To a genius, this was even worse than death. He almost went insane.

“Die!”

Gu Fei roared like a wild beast, and another sword appeared in his hand. It was also a Spirit item. This was actually his personal item and not some supreme Spirit item he had borrowed.

He spat a mouthful of blood on to his sword. It buzzed and awoke. He actually used his essence blood to use this Spirit item. He had definitely gone crazy. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Mu Qingyun was severely injured. Right now, the best choice was to dodge and wait for the others to arrive so that they could charge the altar together.

However, she didn’t do that. Instead, she took out another sword and faced Gu Fei directly.

BOOM!

Mu Qingyun’s sword exploded. The fragments of her sword stabbed into her body, dyeing her clothes red.

“What is she doing? Why is she fighting him head-on?” Luo Ning clenched her fists worriedly. Li Cai and the others would be arriving soon, and Long Chen was getting closer and closer. In just a bit, she would have reinforcements. Fighting directly like this was foolish.

“Mu Qingyun has already chosen the path of a sword cultivator under Long Chen’s direction. In battle, if her sword is unsheathed, she cannot retreat. She can only attack. If she chose to retreat, her Sword Dao would be severely impacted. It might even cause a heart-devil. So even in death, she won’t retreat, unless she wishes to abandon her path as a sword cultivator,” sighed Heaven Master Yun Yang.

Weren’t sword cultivators a bit too stubborn? They couldn’t even retreat? Even if they would die? How was that different from a fool?

“Die!”

Gu Fei was sent reeling back, but seeing Mu Qingyun on her last legs, he once more attacked without hesitation.

Mu Qingyun solemnly took out another sword. Her body was already swaying, but her hand was steady. Her gaze was as determined as it was at the start. There was no fear on her face.

“Don’t!” Some of the female disciples cried out in horror, unable to bear watching her blood fall.
