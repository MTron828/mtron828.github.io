Chapter 3989 Crushing Weng Tianyao

That Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s prince didn’t even know that death had arrived before him, as did the elder by his side who failed to react in time.

Long Chen was too fast, so fast that he escaped everyone’s perception before blowing apart that prince with a punch.

Even a three-flower Earth Venerate didn’t react fast enough. By the time he did, he was only able to watch as the blood mist exploded.

Everyone was stunned. Long Chen actually dared to kill people here, not caring about any laws or rules.

“Courting death!”

That Earth Venerate furiously slammed a palm at him. But Long Chen was already turning and shooting toward Weng Tianyao.

“How brazen!”

Weng Tianyao’s master and the three-flower Earth Venerate of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire were enraged. For Long Chen to attack Weng Tianyao here was clearly not placing them in his eyes.

The next moment, the sound of a saber coming out of its sheath appeared like a dragon cry, accompanied by killing intent so intense that even gods and devils would tremble in its presence.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This saber was as quick as lightning, instantly stabbing toward the three-flower Earth Venerate of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

By the time people heard the saber being unsheathed, it was already piercing toward the body of that Earth Venerate.

The Earth Venerate was stunned. Long Chen was so fast that it had escaped human limits. Even a three-flower Earth Venerate was unable to produce such speed without activating their manifestation.

With a roar, that Earth Venerate’s power poured through his arms. When the Grand Dao runes appeared on his hands, he slammed them together.

BOOM!

The entire banquet hall quivered. To everyone’s surprise, Long Chen’s saber was only an inch away from that Earth Venerate’s chest, but it was firmly caught by his hands.

Just then, a lightning sword appeared in Weng Tianyao’s hands, and he stabbed it at Long Chen. Having lost the initiative, Long Chen was in danger now.

Long Chen snorted. Completely ignoring Weng Tianyao’s attack, he directly let go of the MInghong Saber. He then spun, causing Weng Tianyao’s sword to merely flash by him.

Using the power of the spin, Long Chen’s left elbow, which was covered in golden scales, smashed into the hilt of the Minghong Saber.

Before this, the Minghong Saber was tightly grasped by the Earth Venerate. However, the sheer force behind Long Chen's strike was overwhelming, surpassing the Earth Venerate's strength. As a result, the Minghong Saber forcefully broke through his grip.

The Minghong Saber then stabbed through his chest, and the tip of the blade was a full foot out of his back.

When that happened, explosive power erupted within his body. Even as an Earth Venerate, without his manifestation active, his innards were blown apart, causing him to hack up blood.

While everyone was still in a state of shock, Long Chen already returned to his seat like a phantom. Most shocking of all, not only had he pulled the saber back from the Earth Venerate's body, but he had also brought someone back with him.

That someone was Weng Tianyao, which stunned even Xu Xiaoyun, Jiang Huixin, Xu Lanxin, and the other three-flower Earth Venerates. Their attention had been on the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s Earth Venerate the entire time, and they didn’t notice how Long Chen had caught Weng Tianyao.

At this moment, Long Chen gripped Weng Tianyao's throat firmly with his hand, blood trickling down his fingers. Weng Tianyao, deprived of his sword, was trembling uncontrollably. The once arrogant demeanor he had displayed was completely gone, and fear was all that remained in his eyes, rendering him unable to utter a sound or even think about begging for mercy.

Everyone was deathly silent and merely looked at Long Chen. Those princes and princesses even forgot how to breathe.

As they had never seen such a thing before, they were completely stunned. During a state banquet, in front of this many three-flower Earth Venerates, Long Chen actually dared to kill and capture a diplomat, injuring an Earth Venerate in the process. That was unimaginable to them.

Yu Xiaoyun had never liked Long Chen. However, when Long Chen attacked, he saw that Long Chen’s moves were clean, efficient, and filled with the style of a peerless expert. As a result, even he had no choice but to admire Long Chen’s skills.

It had to be known that Long Chen’s true combat power was still a far cry from three-flower Earth Venerates. However, he was so fast that he managed to strike before they even had a chance to unleash their power. Using just the power of his physical body, he crushed his enemies.

Everything—from when he attacked, to when he was blocked and in danger, to his perfect counterattack—was incredibly fast, and these reactions could only be honed through constant battle. Moreover, there wasn’t the slightest flaw, which showed his combat awareness and profound experience that was accumulated through a lifetime of fighting.

Jiang Huixin, Xu Lanxin, and the other experts on their level were all stunned. How many years had it been since they had seen such a terrifying young expert?

“Long Chen…!”

When Weng Tianyao’s master roared, the violent pressure belonging to an Earth Venerate crashed upon the hall. It was like everyone had suddenly sunk into the deep sea, the pressure capable of directly crushing them.

The princes and princes, as well as the other young heavenly geniuses, felt like they couldn’t breathe. Their bones creaked as if they would break at any second.

“This is the pressure of a three-flower Earth Venerate?!”

Those princes and princesses felt like their bodies would explode, as if their souls would be torn apart. Thus, they were filled with fear inside, having never faced such power before.

However, Long Chen didn’t even look at that elder and only stared coldly at Weng Tianyao in his hand.

“I told you, if I want to kill you, not even gods or devils could protect you. Now, do you believe me?”

Weng Tianyao could only unleash a strange sound from his throat. He couldn’t even speak. At this moment, blood poured out from his seven orifices, and his eyes were filled with terror.

“I should have killed you back in the three thousand worlds. But Lei Linger was kind and let you off. Unfortunately, you didn’t know how to repent. Instead, you despicably harmed someone by my side to anger me. Do you feel like you still get to see tomorrow’s sun?” Long Chen gazed at Weng Tianyao with his icy killing intent.

Weng Tianyao’s master furiously roared, “Long Chen, release Weng Tianyao, otherwise-”

BOOM!

Before he could finish speaking, lightning exploded, causing Weng Tianyao to blow up and turn into nothingness.

“Otherwise what?”

After crushing Weng Tianyao, Long Chen turned to look at his sluggish master.
