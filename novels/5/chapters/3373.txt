Chapter 3362 Fish in Troubled Water

BOOM!

The void exploded, and Long Chen was dragged out of the chaotic flow of space by some power from the outer world. Long Chen then felt a terrifying pressure that almost crushed him.

Before he could even get a clear look at what was going on, he shot out like a meteor. After that, he blasted through fragments of spacetime and crashed into the ground.

A giant hole was smashed into the ground. Long Chen saw stars revolving in his head and was almost crushed by the impact.

“Kill!”

Furious roars shook the land and countless experts were roaring. Only now did Long Chen realize that he was on an immense battlefield.

He saw countless lifeforms with black and red armor fighting. Corpses littered the ground.

Smelling the air, Long Chen was startled. “This is the aura of the Netherworld! And these lifeforms look similar to the human race, but they don’t have any immortal qi. Instead, it’s Nether Qi.”

Long Chen climbed up a mountain. Looking far and wide, he saw a giant black city in the distance.

The black city had a barrier of divine light around it and a towering castle inside. Moreover, a multicolored ball of light at the top of the castle was like a strange eye overlooking this world.

The eye glowed. It seemed to be the core of the castle, but it was different from the cores of the immortal world’s formation. This core was actually exposed.

The black city had countless lifeforms wearing black armor pouring out of it. It seemed that they were defending, and the lifeforms in red armor were attacking.

In the distance, spatial cracks were appearing. Sharp blades cut through the void, as if wanting to cut apart heaven and earth. That was a battle of peak experts.

Seeing those huge cracks, Long Chen understood that it was their fight that had shattered space and allowed him to escape.

However, that distant battlefield was still twisting violently, with runes constantly exploding. He was unable to see who was fighting.

All of a sudden, Long Chen felt a gust of wind. A lifeform in red armor had noticed him and was attacking.

That was a Divine Lord, but he was instantly killed by a slap. After a soulsearch, Long Chen learned that these red armor lifeforms were attacking the city. But this little grunt had no idea who the leader was or who the real target was.

An idea then popped into Long Chen’s head. He took off that person’s armor and put it on. Their figures weren’t that different, so it was enough for him to muddle in amongst them.

Long Chen then grabbed his spear, which felt cold in his hand. The materials were very different from the weapons of the immortal world.

“Kill! Kill them all! There’s no need to fear!”

Wearing the red armor, Long Chen instantly began to shout. Having come to the Netherworld before, he also knew the language here.

However, once he shouted, he saw that no one listened to his orders. Instead, he drew a late stage Divine Lord’s anger.

“What are you shouting for?! Get going! The city gates will fall soon! If you dare to be lazy, I’ll kill you.”

The armor that they were wearing had ranks, and everyone could tell a person’s status just from their armor. Long Chen had simply been unaware.

Long Chen directly smashed that person with his spear. “Fuck, you dare to howl at your Boss Long San? Have you not died before?”

The other lifeforms around jumped in shock. A subordinate had actually attacked a superior? That was a major criminal charge.

“What are you looking at? I’m one of your disguised generals. I was put here to keep an eye on all of you! Anyone who slacks off will be personally killed by me! Do you know who stands behind me?” shouted Long Chen.

Those Divine Lords were shocked by Long Chen. His realm was clearly lower than theirs, but he could crush a late stage Divine Lord.

“What are you looking at?! Charge!” Long Chen waved his spear. Those people that were originally following the person that Long Chen had crushed just now could only follow him.

Long Chen led hundreds of them in an assault, and they got closer to the city walls. Long Chen wanted to see what was going on. It seemed that the city defenses had been raised to their peak, and the attackers were piling up their lives to drown the city. That meant the city was in imminent danger.

Seeing that the city was about to be broken into, Long Chen’s old disease popped up again. He wanted to see if he could dredge up any benefits. After coming empty-handed, he couldn’t leave with nothing. That wasn’t his style.

“Are you blind? Don’t randomly run around! The left flank is the weakest! Attack the left flank!”

Long Chen led his group straight toward the city gates, only for an Immortal King to bark orders at them.

“What do you know? The weak left flank is to bait us! The frontal gate is our real goal!” Long Chen ignored him. Who cared if it was weak? Entering through the gates was the fastest path.

Otherwise, when the city was broken into, he would be stuck on the edges. Wouldn’t the good stuff be taken by others before he could get there?

“You’re not listening to orders? Die!” The Immortal King furiously reached toward Long Chen.

Seeing this, Long Chen snorted and unleashed a punch. As a result, that Mortal tier Immortal King screamed. His arm was destroyed.

Grabbing his neck, Long Chen lifted him up like a chicken. He shouted, “Master Tuo Ming has ordered me to oversee the battle! I am in charge of secretly controlling the tempo of the attack. You fools have wasted so many warriors for nothing without taking the city. You’re all trash. Master Tuo Ming is already very dissatisfied. I am ordered to take down the city gates within an incense stick’s worth of time. Otherwise, all of you will die. If you don’t want to die, then you better listen to my orders. If you want to die, just nod and I’ll send you on your way.”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

On the way here, he had heard quite a few people shouting the name of Tuo Ming, which was why he used this name to intimidate them.

That Immortal King’s head was buzzing from Long Chen’s words. He was terrified as he was incredibly weak in front of Long Chen. He felt like Long Chen might even have the power of an Earth tier Immortal King.

“Senior… please spare my life. We’ll listen to you!” That person shuddered, finally believing that Long Chen was Tuo Ming’s trusted subordinate. Otherwise, with Long Chen’s power, there was no way he would be wearing the armor of a normal grunt.

“Summon our people. Smash into the gate!” shouted Long Chen. He then released him, and that person immediately started gathering people.

BOOM!

Just then, an explosion shook the heavens. Two figures came out of that battlefield of twisting space. When Long Chen saw one of them, he almost cried out.

“No way!”
