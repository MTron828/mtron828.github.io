Chapter 3797 Yue Xiaoqian’s Crisis

The tablet Xia Chen had given Long Chen was finally reacting. That meant that they were no longer far from each other.

Hearing that they were near, Mo Nian was even more excited than Long Chen. It had to be known that if it weren’t for Long Chen needing a few days of seclusion, he’d have dragged Long Chen away to go search for them.

“Let’s go! We’ll reunite with them right now!” urged Mo Nian impatiently.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Alright. But I first have to arrange some things!”

Long Chen directly gathered the Dragonblood warriors and ordered them to cultivate within the city during this time and wait for more Dragonblood warriors.

He also left hundreds of Heavenly Dao Fruit, instructing Jiang Lei on how to differentiate them so that the right ones were given to the right warriors based on their attributes. It was only after this that Long Chen left with Mo Nian.

The tablet’s fluctuations were very weak. Long Chen was unable to determine an accurate direction from it. After testing it, they decided to first do some short distance transportations. If they were wrong, they would just go back.

After arriving at a mid-sized city, the tablet’s fluctuations were slightly clearer. It gradually began to point in one direction.

They then took out a map and transported themselves to the next human settlement. With every city they arrived at, Mo Nian would buy some ads to direct the Dragonblood warriors to Clear Sky City.

After seven cities, Long Chen finally confirmed Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s location. The two of them were in another human city, one comparable to Clear Sky City: Silver Moon City.

This Silver Moon City was not the Dao Dawn Domain’s Silver Moon City. This Silver Moon City possessed an extremely ancient history. It was said that the indigenous members were descendants of the immemorial Silver Moon race. The Silver Moon race might not be able to compare to the Jiuli, Violet Blood, or Heavenly Eye races, but they were still a powerful bloodline with terrifying power.

However, Silver Moon City was not like Clear Sky City in that it did not reject other races. As long as the various races were willing to abide by Silver Moon City’s rules, all races could enter.

Although the human populace was in charge, they didn’t have dealings with Clear Sky City. That was because the city lord of Clear Sky City was too domineering and even looked down upon Silver Moon City.

“This place is a bit distasteful. There’s a wild land between us that blocks transportations. We’ll need to go around,” said Mo Nian, frowning as he eyed the map.

This wild land was one where space was still shattered, and the laws were in chaos. There was no way to make a spatial channel between them. If they wanted to get across, they’d need to travel through it themselves or go around.

If they were to fly, it’d take at least a few days. But going around would also take two or three days.

“Is there a way to get them to come over? After all, the tomb is closer to Clear Sky City,” said Mo Nian.

Long Chen shook his head. “We should go over. They probably have quite a few Dragonblood warriors with them. I don’t like the idea of them traveling alone.”

Mo Nian nodded. If they were in a large group, it really wouldn’t be convenient.

The two of them could also leave behind more signs for Dragonblood warriors throughout the cities that they passed through if they went around, so it wasn’t a waste of time.

In one day, the two of them went through almost a hundred cities. Even with their power, they were almost vomiting by the end. The taste of space constantly twisting was difficult to bear. Anyone else would have long since reached their limit.

Fortunately, they were getting closer and closer to Silver Moon City. If they kept preserving, they would arrive eventually.

Just as Long Chen needed seven more transportations to arrive at Silver Moon City, Long Chen’s tablet began to rapidly blink.

“What is it?” asked Mo Nian.

Long Chen’s expression changed. “Guo Ran must be in trouble. We have to increase the pace.”

Under normal circumstances, the two of them would pay a fee and then line up after arriving at each city. But after receiving this urgent distress signal, they directly cut the lines, knocking aside anyone who would stop them.

In each city, they had to knock down a few experts before they felt like they could safely use the transportation formation. They finally arrived at Silver Moon City, but Long Chen found that Guo Ran had already left. Only Xia Chen’s tablet was still present.

But when they arrived, it wasn’t Xia Chen who welcomed them. It was a group of Dragonblood warriors.

“Boss, not good! Guo Ran and Xia Chen received word that Yue Xiaoqian is being attacked by the devil race! As the two of them couldn’t wait for you, they immediately set off. They only left us to wait for you and give you this tablet,” reported a Dragonblood warrior.

“Yue Xiaoqian?”

Long Chen was startled. Yue Xiaoqian was from the original devil race. With the devil suppressing seal on her forehead, she was the natural bane of the devil race. Furthermore, the devil race hated her race. They would definitely launch an all-out attack if they discovered her.

“Boss, take this! This is boss Xia Chen’s tablet, and it has stronger sensing capabilities. We can switch, and you rush over!” That Dragonblood warrior pressed the tablet into Long Chen’s hand.

Long Chen then handed him his tablet. He didn’t have much time. There were over a hundred Dragonblood warriors here, so Long Chen gave them the Heavenly Dao Fruits and told them to secretly consume them when they could. He also implored them to be safe and search for other Dragonblood warriors in the city when they were done. After that, he left them a mass of money.

Long Chen and Mo Nian charged into the city. As soon as they entered, a group of people blocked their path.

“If you don’t want to die, then scram!” Long Chen roared and a wave of killing intent erupted.

Those people were from the demonic beast race. They had clearly come to provoke Long Chen, but this one roar shook their eyes to the point that they didn’t dare to move. Their souls almost collapsed.

“Who dares to cause such a ruckus-”

A group of patrolling experts came by, but one look from Long Chen caused them to shut their mouths.

Long Chen urgently needed to go, so he no longer cared about who was in his way. He would not show mercy.

Long Chen and Mo Nian shoved their way onto the transportation formation. There were originally several demonic beasts on it, but Long Chen and Mo Nian grabbed their throats and threw them aside like trash.

Long Chen directly activated the transportation formation, and in front of countless shocked gazes, vanished.

BOOM!

Long Chen struck the void, and the two of them came flying out of space. Long Chen then checked the tablet and nodded.

“We’re not far. Let’s go.”

Long Chen had borrowed the transportation formation and left midway. As long as the direction wasn’t off, they would save quite a bit of time like that.

Mo Nian took out the map and said, “This should be the forbidden land of the devil race. It seems that Xia Chen and them are already in the depths of this territory. A battle will be difficult to avoid.”

“Then let’s just destroy this land.”

Long Chen looked at his tablet. They were not far from Guo Ran and Xia Chen, so the two of them hastily flew off.
