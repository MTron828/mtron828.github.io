Chapter 4814 Furiously Slashing a Heaven Saint

The Heaven Saint divine weapon tore through the very shackles of the world, piercing toward Long Chen with boundless killing intent.

This Heaven Saint was none other than the one whose Heaven Saint foundation had been destroyed by Long Zhantian in front of the gate to the ninth heaven. He had also lost an arm to Bai Letian.

The intense hatred in his gaze toward Long Chen was as though Long Chen had personally slain his father. His old face contorted with fury, with flames nearly spewing from his eyes.

Because of the intervention, Long Chen couldn’t continue to attack Zhang Benzhi. With stars swirling around it, Evilmoon twisted, redirecting the attack intended for Zhang Benzhi toward the Heaven Saint instead. Saber and spear collided with a resounding, earth-shaking explosion.

BOOM!

The two divine weapons clashed, unleashing qi waves that blasted out in every direction.

“Foolish old fellow, I haven’t even had the chance to come looking for you, yet here you are at my doorstep. If you want to trade your life for his, I'll gladly accept,” said Long Chen with a dark tone.

Just as Long Chen blocked the Heaven Saint’s attack, Zhang Benzhi crushed a talisman and vanished. Bai Shishi and the others tried to stop him, but they were too late; Xia Chen only managed to grab a leg.

Seeing Zhang Benzhi escape and feeling the Heaven Saint's intense anger directed at him, Long Chen himself became furious. With a roar, a starry sea appeared behind him, and violet qi rose. As he finally summoned his starry sea manifestation, his astral energy erupted to a new level. Evilmoon was also affected, emitting gushing black qi. The Celestial race’s Heaven Saint was unable to overpower them.

“Old fool, do you know why my father didn’t kill you back then? It’s because your life is mine, so he left it to me to personally end you. Your Heaven Saint foundation was already destroyed, and you lost an arm. While your realm might not have fallen, you’ve essentially lost half of your cultivation base. Did you think you could do anything against me in this state?” Long Chen’s aura raged. In terms of pure aura, he was actually overpowering this Heaven Saint.

Long Chen’s aura continued to grow, causing the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint to retreat step by step. With every step, the ground beneath him shattered.

For a Heaven Saint to be repeatedly forced back by a junior with a Divine Venerate cultivation base, news of such an event would shock countless onlookers.

Long Chen seethed with anger. It seemed this world was always conspiring against him. Zhang Benzhi clearly was not a match for him, yet just as Long Chen was about to finish him, someone like this Heaven Saint appeared, allowing Zhang Benzhi to escape.

The heavens were always going against him. No matter what he did, it wouldn’t go smoothly for him. There were always various mishaps.

At this moment, the white-robed Long Chen’s words rang out in his mind. Wherever you go, you are targeted like a stray dog. Tell me, have you ever had a day of peace since you ascended? The human race and the other races of the myriad world attack you wherever you go; even the heavens want to destroy you. There’s nowhere for you to flee throughout heaven and earth.

“Why don’t you tell me how much of a coward you are? You don’t even have the guts to topple heaven and earth. What qualifications do you have to control this body? What qualifications do you have to call yourself Long Chen?

At this moment, Long Chen’s killing intent burned fiercely. Despite knowing that his heart-devil’s words were just a psychological attack, they still echoed with a painful truth he couldn't refute. Reflecting on the endless trials and tribulations he faced since arriving in the immortal world, he felt overwhelmed, as if fate itself was a merciless hand constantly trying to kill him.

His fury surged uncontrollably as if he might burst into flames. Encouraged by his heart-devil, Long Chen could no longer contain his emotions. All of his pent-up rage was fully unleashed on this fellow before him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a pair of wings appeared on the Heaven Saint’s back. With a quiver of those wings, he regained his footing and was no longer forced back. He pressed his weapon against Evilmoon and Long Chen.

“Even if I am only half a Heaven Saint, I can still kill a brat like you!”

At this moment, a star diagram appeared on Long Chen’s left hand, and with it, he slapped the Heaven Saint’s face. “Go fuck yourself!”

BOOM!

Long Chen’s palm landed firmly, crushing half the Heaven Saint’s face and sending him tumbling back. The Heaven Saint had never imagined that despite using his full power in their clash, Long Chen still had the energy to launch a sneak attack.

Unbeknownst to him, Long Chen possessed a wealth of combat experience. In close-range combat, he was nearly unmatched. As for his divine face-slapping art, it had reached the pinnacle of divine techniques.

Suddenly retracting the power of his saber, Long Chen drew in his opponent's energy and directed it back at him in a powerful slap. While the technique sounded straightforward, executing it was exceptionally complex. Not only was the chance of failure high, but it could even lead to injury or death.

This technique required a powerful body to redirect the opponent’s energy, and Long Chen happened to be someone with big guts and utmost confidence in this regard. This one slap was essentially a conglomeration of both of their powers.

The Heaven Saint almost died from this slap. Even so, he was still a Heaven Saint, and even if his realm had half-fallen, he was incredibly tough.

“Little brute!” the Heaven Saint roared. He no longer cared about his injuries and went crazy, igniting the very fire of his life. He had clearly lost all rationality and was only thinking of killing Long Chen. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Seven Forms in One!”

As Long Chen roared, Evilmoon rumbled, and seven runes lit up upon its surface, drawing in a huge amount of astral energy.

A giant saber-image tore into the sky, descending like a river of stars with the intent to cleave heaven and earth. This marked Long Chen's first time using all seven forms of his technique simultaneously.

Such a thing was something Long Chen wouldn’t do if he was being rational. However, he was so enraged that if he didn’t unleash it, he felt like he would explode. As a result, Evilmoon slashed down, filled with the will to split the heavens.

“Blood Ignition Soul Forge, Heavenly Fate Deathblow!”

With a roar, the Heaven Saint poured all his power and life into his spear. After this exchange, whether he won or lost, he would be dead.

BOOM!

The saber descended like a river of stars and exploded like a firework at the end. After the collision, the spear exploded with it, and the Heaven Saint turned to dust, dead in body and spirit.

In an instant, Long Chen turned pale as paper, his aura plummeting yet his gaze still sharp.

Just then, the void in the distance twisted, revealing several figures with terrifying Heaven Saint auras.

“If you aren’t afraid of my father annihilating your entire sect and family, come and try me!” shouted Long Chen. He then raised Evilmoon, staring at those figures darkly.
