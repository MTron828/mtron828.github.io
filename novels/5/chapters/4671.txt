Chapter 4660 Impossible to Endure

“Luo Changsheng? Do you mean the monster of the Celestial race? That Luo Changsheng!?” Startled cries rang out.

“But the Celestial race hasn’t appeared in countless years! Is he really from the Celestial race?”

“It’s true. This time, the Celestial race came out in full power and was clearly prepared. They want to use this opportunity to make their name ring throughout the world once more.”

“Just who is Long Chen?! I’ve never heard of him before, but all these monsters seem to have encountered him before!”

A commotion erupted among the guards as Long Chen made his entrance, instantly becoming the center of attention. He directly countered anyone who dared to curse at him, refusing to yield an inch and leaving his enemies seething with frustration.

In his brief exchanges with Yu Zihao, Gengjian, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yin Jiushang, and Luo Changsheng, it seemed that they all harbored enmities toward him. Hence, all the guards instantly felt like their duty had become much more interesting, and they already anticipated the start of the heavenly tribulation.

“Haha, my Celestial race has many abilities, but they can’t compare to your Dragonblood Legion’s vile practices. You guys don’t even let off the kind Spirit race’s women. Such barbaric actions are completely intolerable,” said Luo Changsheng.

“If the subordinates are perverts, the leader is definitely not any better. No wonder,” sneered Fallen Daynight’s disciple.

“Not only are you sinister and malicious, but you are also despicably shameless. Other than conning others, what talent do you have?” added Yu Zihao.

“Long Chen, I never imagined you to be such a despicable individual. A malevolent being like you must be eradicated,” Netherdragon Tianzhao declared, seizing the opportunity to retaliate.

“An evil leader who condones his subordinates preying upon the benevolent Spirit race. Your earlier big words were just to cover who you truly are—a big hypocrite! What a despicable bastard!” added Yin Jiushang with vengeance in his voice.

In reality, none of them were aware of the truth behind that incident. However, if it wasn’t in favor of Long Chen, they would undoubtedly rally behind it.

Previously, Long Chen had bruised them with his cutting remarks, leaving them without a way to retort. Now, they took this chance to launch their own verbal attacks.

As they threw accusations at him, despite his need to maintain composure, Long Chen could feel his anger steadily rising. He clenched his fists tightly.

He only had one mouth, so against this torrent of abuse, none of his eloquence mattered. A chilling aura of murderous intent pulsed in his mind, threatening to erupt from within him.

Now, all the guards were following this trend as well, pointing at Long Chen as if the Dragonblood Legion had really taken advantage of the Spirit race’s women.

Although Long Chen didn’t particularly care about his reputation, the Dragonblood Legion’s reputation could not be sullied. They were all upright men, and for Long Chen, their honor was more important than his life.

Hence, Long Chen couldn’t endure this insult. If this rumor were to spread, the reputation of the Dragonblood Legion would be tarnished.

“Why aren’t you talking anymore? Feeling overwhelmed by guilt, perhaps? If you truly regret your actions, you should consider taking your own life here as an act of repentance.” Luo Changsheng’s voice took on a gentle tone once more, as if he was kindly advising Long Chen.

Long Chen could no longer suppress his fury. Luo Changsheng wielded a bewitching art with his words that went beyond mere manipulation. It was a strange divine ability that defied any defenses.

His voice possessed a unique skill in evoking emotions such as anger, fear, self-blame, irritability, despair, and other negative emotions. No matter how strong one’s heart might be, any emotional ripple could be exploited by this technique. Long Chen remembered how Yue Zifeng had succumbed to this tactic.

Anyway, Long Chen no longer gave a shit about containing his fury. His killing intent saturated the air like a suffocating fog.

An invisible killing intent seemed to have taken solid form and spread throughout this region. Every expert, whether encased within tribulation spheres or sheltered behind protective formations, sensed their souls quivering in response. All their gazes turned to Long Chen’s lightning sphere in shock.

“Do you think I'm unaware of your scheme? I may not know your intentions, but I will not tolerate anyone tarnishing the reputation of the Dragonblood Legion, or my brothers...” Long Chen’s voice was like the devil’s whisper, icy and merciless, piercing deep into the hearts of those who heard it. Countless individuals shuddered involuntarily.

“So what? Facts are facts!” retorted Luo Changsheng indifferently.

“Intentionally slandering my brothers will make me angry,” declared Long Chen.

“So what?”

“When I get angry, I even feel afraid of myself. You should really learn about respect, young man”

“Hahahaha!” Luo Changsheng laughed like he had just heard the world’s most absurd joke.

“Only the ignorant feel no fear. What I seek to safeguard is not merely the lives of my people, but also their dignity and honor. Yet, you distort black and white, twisting the truth to defame the Dragonblood Legion.” Long Chen’s voice remained calm, devoid of any emotion. Within its quietness, however, lay a bottomless well of killing intent.

“I’m just stating facts. You—”

“Shut up!”

Long Chen's once subdued voice erupted into a thunderous roar, akin to a whispering devil suddenly bellowing. A shocking soundwave erupted from him, causing those around him to lose consciousness for a bit. However, his voice continued to echo within their minds. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Shut up!

Shut up!

Shut up!

...

Time appeared to come to a standstill as the two words echoed relentlessly within everyone’s minds, refusing to fade for a long time. With just a shout from Long Chen, their thoughts ceased to function, and their senses numbed for a while.

Everyone’s expressions changed as they realized that Long Chen’s killing intent had reached the point of influencing the world. It had even invaded their senses.

It was like an invisible blade tempered through the lives of countless experts. Never before had these experts encountered such a condensed and potent manifestation of killing intent.

Despite being shielded by a formation, the guards couldn’t fend off his killing intent. If Long Chen had decided to attack the moment they lost their senses, they would have been dead now.

“How laughable, you—” sneered Luo Changsheng.

However, before he could finish his sneer, a thunderous roar shattered the air. An explosive sound erupted from Long Chen, his aura surging skyward like a volcanic eruption.
