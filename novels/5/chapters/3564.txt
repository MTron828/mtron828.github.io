Chapter 3553

Long Chen’s killing intent soared. The terrifying Yan Hong had injured Yu Qingxuan, and in order to not be an inconvenience to Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan had exhausted herself just to let him absorb more flame energy and restrict Yan Hong’s growth.

However, at this critical time, groups of people stabbed blades in Long Chen’s back. But even that wouldn’t have enraged Long Chen this much. It was when their hands reached for Yu Qingxuan that he lost control. Now, he was fully enraged.

“I’m not afraid.”

Yu Qingxuan leaned against Long Chen’s back, gently pressing her face on Long Chen’s shoulder and smiling slightly.

“You should still close your eyes. I wish that as long as I am present, your beautiful eyes only see beautiful things. I don’t want this dirty world to infect your eyes. Just let me face the darkness myself. Count it as me begging you,” whispered Long Chen.

Hearing that, Yu Qingxuan finally closed her eyes. She wrapped her arms around his neck tightly, smiling sweetly.

At that moment, even if she was facing an endless army, even if sharp blades were about to pierce her body, Yu Qingxuan would still feel at peace and happy.

“Die!”

Seeing that Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan were still flirting at such a time, Zhao Mingxuan and the others were enraged. But the first one to charge forward was actually the Immemorial Flame Devil.

“Flame Devil energy, Blood Devil Possession!”

The Immemorial Flame Devil’s manifestation burst into existence behind him, and endless devil qi ignited. It was like an ancient devil had been released from a seal. After that, thirty percent of his devil sword’s runes lit up.

He had actually used his trump card, activating his World Domain divine item. At this moment, his devil sword roared.

“Split the Heavens 3!”

Black runes could vaguely be seen in Long Chen’s eyes, and his aura became sinister and merciless. The Minghong Saber then slashed down.

There was no gust, no whistle, and no sign of any immense power. The Minghong Saber’s violet qi was completely condensed. When this saber fell, it was as if every sound was gone from this world.

Crack.

Everyone was shocked. This silent blow of Long Chen’s instantly unleashed an explosion of violet qi when it struck that devil sword, severing it and slaying that Immemorial Flame Devil.

“What?!”

Zhao Mingxuan and the others were appalled. A World Domain divine item had actually been severed? How was that possible?! Furthermore, that Immemorial Flame Devil had clearly activated thirty percent of its runes!

They were also capable of activating around thirty percent of their World Domain divine items’ runes. That way, they could unleash immense power that could shake the world.

However, activating that many runes would come at a terrifying price. Normally, they only unleashed ten percent of their World Domain divine items’ power.

By igniting their essence blood, they could activate around twenty percent of their power. However, activating thirty percent of it would not just require igniting their essence blood, it would also require igniting their souls. It was something that used up their longevity and was incredibly damaging.

Even then, this Immemorial Flame Devil was unable to block Long Chen’s attack. His devil sword was severed, and his physical body was destroyed. The power difference between the two was too great. At this time, they finally understood just how terrifying Long Chen was.

Although the Immemorial Flame Devil’s sword and physical body had been destroyed, his Yuan Spirit hadn’t crumbled. It transformed into a streak of light that flew away.

However, he had barely started flying when Long Chen’s saber swung out. A violet saber-image then shot out, chasing after that Yuan Spirit. In the end, the Yuan Spirit exploded and transformed into devil flames.

After slaying that Immemorial Flame Devil, Long Chen’s gaze was still icy. He turned toward Zhao Mingxuan and the others.

“Where is that brother from the Lava Giant race?”

At this time, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength swept over the battlefield, but he didn’t sense the aura of that Lava Giant. In that instant, the black runes in Long Chen’s eyes increased by a bit.

Zhao Mingxuan and the others were terrified. They felt a devil god was staring at them. That intense terror filled their hearts.

That Lava Giant had helped Long Chen and enraged them. Thus, they joined forces to kill him. Now that Long Chen asked about him, they were terror-stricken.

“Run!”

That was their first reaction. Long Chen’s attack had not just killed that Immemorial Flame Devil, but it had also destroyed their confidence.

Before Long Chen had unleashed a terrifying power in his fight with Yan Hong, they ultimately felt that as long as they activated their World Domain divine items, they should also possess power that could destroy heaven and earth.

Even if they weren’t a match for Long Chen in a one-against-one, there were so many of them. Long Chen should still be dead once they fell on him.

However, Long Chen’s saber was capable of severing even World Domain divine items. Only now were they shocked to find that Long Chen’s terrifying power was completely incomprehensible.

Hence, they spat out blood on their weapons at almost the same time. After that, their divine items quivered and brought them flying away straight to the exit. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“A group of idiots. Do you think that you can run? If you kill people, you must pay with your own life. Leave your life behind!”

Long Chen clenched his teeth and shot after them. He no longer cared about Yan Hong. That was because most of the flame energy had been absorbed out of this world. Stopping him at this point would be meaningless anyway.

Hence, he cast all his anger on these idiots that didn’t know respect. Long Chen’s speed was raised to its peak. Although they shot off first, he quickly caught up to them.

Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others were so terrified that their souls almost fled out of their bodies. Ignoring everything else, they directly started igniting their souls, causing their divine items to shine even brighter.

They were willing to sacrifice their longevity just to increase their speed. It could be seen just how terrified they were now.

They had thought that at this moment, Yan Hong would come to attack Long Chen. However, they seemed to have overthought it. Yan Hong was already done absorbing the flame energy of the world and was simply sitting in the air, seemingly digesting it.

As for them, they became stray dogs. Seeing Long Chen refusing to let them off, they were filled with regrets. If they had known that Long Chen was so terrifying from the start, they would have never provoked him.

“Quick! As long as we reach the exit, Long Chen’s definitely dead!” Wu Yang clenched his teeth.

Although he was a Three-Foot Golden Crow, it was actually faster for him to ignite his essence blood and soul to flee with his World Domain divine item.

A group of peak heavenly geniuses were burning their essence blood and souls just to run. That was definitely a huge humiliation for them.

Moreover, they didn’t dare to fight Long Chen head-on. Even if they all joined forces, they didn’t dare to do so. They were afraid of Long Chen killing them one by one. If that happened, then they might all die within the Heavenly Flame World.

Suddenly, the Heavenly Flame World quivered, and everyone inside felt a burst of power. There was no need for them to run. It was like a merciless hand was shoving them directly to the exit. The world rapidly shrank and the exit appeared right before them.

At the exit, countless experts were gathered, staring in horror at what they were seeing. They saw space twisting and collapsing. It was like a giant mouth was trying to devour this entire world.

Then they saw a group of heavenly geniuses fleeing like stray dogs out of this crumbling world.

“Long Chen, return Luo Zijun’s life!”

Very quickly, these elders spotted Zhao Mingxuan and the others, as well as Long Chen. One elder in particular immediately roared in fury, charging through just to attack Long Chen.
