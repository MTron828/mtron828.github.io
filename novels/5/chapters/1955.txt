Chapter 1945: 1945

Long Chen didn’t see any signs of intense battle as he flew through this world . Wilde’s battle style was completely different from Magical Beasts, so it should be easy to tell if he had been somewhere .

Only once Long Chen had been flying for a while did he find that this world was lacking any civilization . There were no advanced lifeforms here . Magical Beasts ruled this world .

He encountered quite a few twelfth rank Magical Beasts that blocked his path, but they were all killed by him .

The Magical Beasts in this world were much more concentrated . Hence, even twelfth rank Magical Beasts only had a tiny bit of territory .

Some of the weaker Magical Beasts were forced to roam on the edges of the more powerful Magical Beasts’ territories .

“The spiritual qi in the air is very dense . The earth is fertile enough to give rise to spirit grasses that can raise so many Magical Beasts, but it hasn’t given rise to a food chain collapse . How curious . ”

In any world, there needed to be an equilibrium . The big fish ate the small fish, the small fish ate the worms .

He couldn’t comprehend how this world was able to maintain its order when there were so many powerful Magical Beasts present in such close quarters .

The further he went, the stronger the Magical Beasts became . Although they were still at the twelfth rank, there were immense differences in their level .

For humans, the Netherpassage realm was split into four stages, the initial Life and Death realm, the Life realm, the Death realm, and the Samsara realm . The difference between these four levels was immense .

Of all the experts that Long Chen had encountered, the only ones he knew that had reached the third step, the Death realm, were the grand Elders of the Martial Heaven Alliance .

As for the fourth realm, the Samsara realm, he knew of no one who had reached that level . However, Long Chen did guess that the High Priest was a legendary existence at the peak of Netherpassage realm based on how he had so easily resolved Yu Xiaoyun and the old man’s attacks .

However, that was just a suspicion, and he couldn’t say for sure .

As for twelfth rank Magical Beasts, their ranking wasn’t as clear, but the human race had also divided them into four levels .

They were split into the early, mid, late, and peak stage twelfth rank Magical Beasts . Usually, their bloodlines decided their limits . Some Magical Beasts would never be able to advance past the early twelfth rank due to their bloodlines .

The Magical Beasts he saw as he was flying were still all at the early twelfth rank . But even though they were still at the early stage, their actual combat power was increasing as he went in deeper .

“Perhaps this world has a terrifying existence in control of it . No wonder aunt Han doesn’t dare to go openly explore it . ”

BOOM!

Long Chen was in the midst of thinking when a giant flame sphere shot at him .

Hence, he unleashed a punch, blowing apart the flame sphere . As soon as he did so, a giant mouth swallowed him .

The mouth had just closed when a saber-image pierced its head . Long Chen cut off the majority of this giant head .

A giant figure fell to the ground . It was a lion in golden fur .

“The Explosive Flame Golden Lion!”

Long Chen was startled . This Magical Beast was quite famous for its power . For its fur to all be a perfect golden color, it clearly had quite a pure bloodline . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Hesitating, Long Chen decided not to throw it into the primal chaos space . Its hide was a luxury item that could be sold for a great profit .

Such Explosive Flame Golden Lions were almost gone from the Martial Heaven Continent . He could sell it for a tidy profit . Consuming it for life energy would be a pity .

He had just flown away when he suddenly noticed a giant lair on a mountain . There were five furry fellows lying inside .

“Young ones?”

Long Chen was delighted and immediately flew over . A giant cave had been dug into the mountain, and a giant hideout had been made out of bones . The smell was difficult to bear .

Five Explosive Flame Golden Lions were lying inside, and they were sound asleep . Each of them was only a couple dozen meters long .

“Hahaha, I’ve found a treasure!” These five Explosive Flame Golden Lions would definitely possess great killing power if they were raised properly and fought alongside their masters .

Long Chen placed them inside a life ring . They were still too young to resist .

“Amazing . They’re much more impressive than the Blood Pattern Lion Vulture that Guo Ran and the others had found before . And it just so happens that Guo Ran, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and Yue Zifeng can each have one . ” Long Chen smiled . He could already see the day when they raised them into powerful beasts .

Furthermore, with a Beast Tamer like Meng Qi present, they would be raised perfectly, with special resources that would stimulate their bloodline . They would be much stronger than if they grew up in the wild .

This truly was a good place . Long Chen suddenly had a thought . What if he could find each Dragonblood warrior a powerful twelfth rank Magical Beast as a steed? Just how awe-inspiring would they appear then?

Long Chen continued onward . He didn’t know if the five Explosive Flame Golden Lions had ended up using up all his luck or not, but he didn’t encounter any particularly powerful Magical Beasts again, let alone young ones that could be captured .

For three days, he continued flying, and the Magical Beasts started to grow sparse . Long Chen gradually began to have a bad feeling . He smelled danger ahead .

He was about to continue carefully exploring this region when he suddenly took out a jade plate . “Wilde’s been found?”

Long Chen didn’t care what danger was ahead . He returned down his original path . When he arrived at the ore deposit they had found, he saw millions of experts from the original devil race busy excavating the ore and bringing it to the Skyscraping World .

“Boss, we’ve found Wilde’s whereabouts, but we’ve run into trouble . Wilde’s being chased down by some terrifying monster and is in a critical situation . These are the coordinates . ” One of the Dragonblood warriors immediately gave Long Chen another jade plate upon seeing him .

“I understand . You continue waiting here for the others . ” Long Chen nodded and rushed off in the direction indicated by the jade plate .

He was flying as fast as he could, but it was a full twelve hours before he arrived at the coordinates . Wilde was nowhere to be seen . Instead, all Long Chen saw was a ruined battlefield .

Sensing the surroundings and disarray, he suddenly flew to the left . After an incense stick’s worth of time, he heard intense rumbling sounds coming from in front of him . The ground was shaking intensely .

Once he was closer, he saw a giant figure . It was actually a giant pitch-black ape . It had thorn-like fur and a pair of golden eyes . There were runes flickering within its golden eyes . It held a bone club and was crazily roaring .

In front of the giant ape, Long Chen saw Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Xiaoqian, Liu Ruyan, Chu Yao, and over two thousand Dragonblood warriors .

Everyone was rushing over here as fast as possible, but the others were still on their way .

Behind them, Long Chen saw Wilde, who was covered in blood . His original robes were nothing more than tattered rags, so he was wearing a beast hide .

He held a giant bowl and was crazily eating from it . The bowl held twelfth rank Magical Beast corpses that had been shrunk down . Wilde was scarfing them down like a hungry wolf .

BOOM!

The giant ape’s bone club smashed down, and Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s earth giants were blown apart by that one attack . Both of them were forced to hastily block with divine items .

As a result, their divine items also exploded . The two of them let out a muffled groan as they were sent flying . Even after advancing to the Life Star realm and gaining control of a bit of world energy, they were unable to block that ape’s attack .

The ape’s bone club once more smashed down, but wooden stakes suddenly shot out of the ground like pythons, binding the ape .

At the same time as Chu Yao took action, Liu Ruyan unleashed waves of branches that were like chains, also attempting to bind the ape .

The ape suddenly roared and a savage aura erupted . The runes in its eyes lit up, and Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan’s bindings were blown apart .

“How is this possible?!” exclaimed Chu Yao as she fell back . Just why was this giant ape so powerful?

Suddenly, a black light-sword pierced down from the sky . It accurately struck the giant ape right in the head, but the giant ape was only knocked back a bit . That attack barely caused it to bleed .

The ape was enraged, and it swung its club through the air at the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow that had just come .

Cloud twisted through the air, narrowly avoiding this attack . Meng Qi called out, “Everyone, be careful! This is a Golden Eye Berserk Ape! It’s an ancient species, and although it’s a Magical Beast, it’s incredibly powerful . There are already three golden spots in its eyes, meaning it has advanced to the late twelfth rank and is comparable to Death realm Netherpassage experts . Its bone club is also very strange and possesses its own divine abilities . Even half-step divine items will be smashed apart upon contact . ”

As a beast Tamer, Meng Qi even knew Magical Beasts that only existed in legend .

Hearing that it could match Death stage Netherpassage experts, everyone jumped in shock . No wonder it was so powerful .

“Sister Meng Qi, what is its weak spot? How can we beat it?” asked Chu Yao .

“It has no weak spots . We have to take advantage of while it still hasn’t gone berserk to run . Cloud can swallow us again and-”

“Watch out!”

Just at this moment, the Golden Eye Berserk Ape grabbed its giant bone club with both hands, and divine light lit up on it . That light enveloped Meng Qi and Cloud . In that instant, they were shocked to find that they couldn’t move .

The Golden Eye Berserk Ape roared and smashed the club at them . Wilde put away his bowl, shooting out like a bolt of lightning at it .

However, just as Wilde shot out, an evil air filled the world . A black saber slammed into the bone club .
