Chapter 3547

Long Chen arrived with killing intent that filled the heavens. It was as if the Heavenly Daos were about to collapse. That killing intent shook people’s souls.

Yu Qingxuan was even more important than his own life. He would not permit anyone to harm her in the slightest.

Back on the Martial Heaven Continent, Yu Qingxuan had died right in front of him. That image deeply pained his heart. Having met her again, he swore to protect her for a lifetime, letting her live a peaceful life of joy.

Hence, when he learned that she was in danger, he charged right over. Seeing those two giant spheres of light clashing, he instantly saw that Yu Qingxuan was affected by those black flames, causing her core energy to flow out. She was in crisis.

“It’s Long Chen! You goddamn bastard, die!” Zhao Mingxuan and the others were shocked and enraged to see Long Chen charging in. Without hesitation, they attacked him.

“Those who block me will die!”

Long Chen’s killing intent exploded. At this time, this group of bastards were still sticking to him and blocking his path.

“Scram!”

BOOM!

The void suddenly exploded as a giant fist smashed down, piercing the void. As for Zhao Mingxuan and the others, they hadn’t expected to be sneak attacked from behind and hastily flew to the sides.

Feeling shocked, they saw that it was a flame giant. It was that Lava Giant that had spoken to Long Chen just before the Heavenly Flame World appeared. He actually appeared now to help Long Chen.

Long Chen was originally enraged at being blocked by Zhao Mingxuan and the others. He didn’t fear them, but they would delay him from saving Yu Qingxuan. After all, if they joined forces on this chaotic battlefield, quite a bit of his precious time would be lost. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Many thanks!”

This unexpected punch from that Lava Giant created a path for Long Chen. He was delighted and hastily thanked the Lava Giant as he shot by like a bolt of lightning.

“Lava Giant race! Do you really think that we don’t dare to kill you?!” Zhao Mingxuan and the others were enraged at being sneak attacked. Wu Yang in particular roared and transformed into a Three-Foot Golden Crow, attacking the Lava Giant.

“Is the Golden Crow race very amazing? Does my Lava Giant race need to discuss our actions with you beforehand? If you want to fight, then I’ll accompany you.” The Lava Giant’s body instantly grew explosively. A fist smashed toward Wu Yang.

Two enormous figures fought, unleashing shocking flames. With the two of them fighting all-out, the chaotic battlefield grew even more chaotic.

In the distance, a figure watched as Long Chen flew past. There was a touch of rancor in that gaze.

He was Feng Xiang. He had fallen to this point thanks to Long Chen. Now, he was a laughingstock, and Wu Yang and the others looked down on him. At this moment, he could only hide in a corner with a mask on, absorbing the Heavenly Flame energy amongst the crowd.

BOOM!

Long Chen reached the core, and with the True Fire Sword, he attacked Yan Hong.

“Don’t! He will disperse your power into the void!” shouted Yu Qingxuan when she saw Long Chen attacking so recklessly.

That little distraction caused the black threads entangling her to instantly become the thickness of an arm and envelop her. At the same time, rainbow flames soared into the heavens.

Long Chen’s True Fire Sword pierced through the flame protection around Yan Hong. However, Long Chen was shocked to find that the moment this sword touched the flames around Yan Hong, the True Fire Sword’s flame runes were all extinguished. Moreover, Huo Linger’s power that was attached to it was also stripped away, vanishing without a trace.

It was like a brush covered in ink was passing through a waterfall. That barrier completely stripped away the ink. But in this case, that ink was all of Long Chen’s power.

“Scram.”

Yan Hong didn’t even look at Long Chen. The black spear in his right hand stabbed toward Long Chen. At the same time, he extended his left hand, sending countless black threads toward Yu Qingxuan.

BOOM!

The black spear smashed into the True Fire Sword, causing a huge explosion. However, Yan Hong’s body was sent flying like a shooting star.

Seeing the True Fire Sword in Long Chen’s hand, Yan Hong had assumed that Long Chen was a flame cultivator. That made him lower his guard toward Long Chen because the Yan Xu line specialized in countering flame cultivators.

Thus, he hadn’t placed Long Chen’s attack in his eyes and had thought that his spear would send Long Chen flying, at least heavily injuring him if not killing him. His target was Yu Qingxuan.

However, Long Chen wasn’t a flame cultivator, and his physical body was not weak. Instead, it was the opposite. Hence, Yan Hong was sent flying by Long Chen’s physical strength, smashing into a sixth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit.

That Heavenly Flame Spirit was directly smashed through. Its giant body was unable to bear a single blow from Yan Hong.

Long Chen ignored Yan Hong and swung the True Fire Sword, cutting through the black threads around Yu Qingxuan’s body. She was finally freed.

“Qingxuan, I’m sorry. I was late.” Seeing the pale Yu Qingxuan whose eyes had almost lost all their luster, Long Chen was enraged and aggrieved.

He had no idea what power this Yan Hong had used, but he had almost stripped away all of Yu Qingxuan’s core energy. She was exceptionally weak right now, and Long Chen had to support her just to prevent her from collapsing.

“Why did you come here? You aren’t a match for him. He is Yan Xu’s son and possesses bizarre techniques. He can strip me of my flame energy. You have to run!” Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen worriedly.

She now realized that Yan Hong’s strange energy was like poison, causing her flame energy to pour into the void.

It was like how people absorbed the energy of heaven and earth to cultivate. But Yan Hong’s ability was the opposite. He could disperse people’s energy back into heaven and earth.

This was a technique that didn’t benefit him at all. It only harmed others. Returning other people’s energy back to heaven and earth was extremely bizarre. Yu Qingxuan had never thought that such a power would exist in this world.

Perhaps it truly was as Yan Hong said. Without awakening the Heavenly Rainbow manifestation, she was completely restrained by him.

Now that Yan Hong had displayed his power, Yu Qingxuan understood that he wasn’t lying. All throughout their battle, he had only been probing her, wanting to see if she had awakened the Heavenly Rainbow manifestation or not.

Only when he had finished testing her bottom line did he unleash his trump card. Yan Hong was even more terrifying than she had expected.

“I said that I wouldn’t let anyone harm you. Since he dared to harm you, I will make him pay the price. Whatever I say, I can do. Don’t worry. With me present, I guarantee your safety,” said Long Chen solemnly, looking into Yu Qingxuan’s eyes.

Yu Qingxuan was incomparably weak in this state, but looking into Long Chen’s steady gaze, her frenetic heart instantly calmed down. Long Chen’s gaze gave her an endless sense of safety.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth exploded and endless flames raged. After that, Yan Hong’s figure appeared in the air and black runes swirled in his eyes. Like a death god, he stared at Long Chen coldly.

“How do you want to die?”
