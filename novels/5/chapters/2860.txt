Chapter 2849 Despicable

“Hahahaha! Long San, is it? You’re an instructor now, so I can’t directly challenge you to a battle. Do you dare to challenge me?” asked Chu Kuang disdainfully.

“Chu Kuang, you bastard, you’ve already ignited your divine flame, yet you force your realm to stay at the peak of Mortal Transcendence just to block other people’s paths! You’re indescribably despicable!” raged Mu Qingyun.

Long Chen had also noticed that Chu Kuang’s aura was fluctuating. It was like a volcano on the verge of erupting, but some seal was keeping it suppressed.

Through Mu Qingyun’s words, Long Chen understood. This person was already half a step into the next realm, but he had used a secret technique to pause his realm right in between the Mortal Transcendence realm and the Divine Flame realm.

Even though Chu Kuang hadn’t displayed his power, Long Chen could sense an extremely powerful force within him. It was a kind of hidden power.

“What a joke. Didn’t I already give you a chance to submit to me back then? You refused to see my kindness, so you naturally must pay the price,” snorted Chu Kuang.

“I, Mu Qingyun, will not submit to any person,” said Mu Qingyun coldly.

“Haha, aren’t you submitting right now? It seems that you’re about to take your clothes off for him,” sneered Chu Kuang.

“You!” Mu Qingyun was enraged. When cursing involved a man and a woman, it was always the woman who came out at a disadvantage.

Hence, Long Chen patted Mu Qingyun lightly. If they continued cursing, Mu Qingyun would probably cry in rage.

He then looked at Chu Kuang and shook his head. “You’re just an idiot who was spoiled rotten by the seniors in your family. Someone like you has never suffered in their entire life. However, I’ll still give you a piece of advice. Such a thing is very bad for you. Once you finally do meet your comeuppance, it will be very bad. Youngster, be careful.”

“Hahaha!” Chu Kuang raised his head and laughed. He then looked at the people behind him. “Someone dares to give me a lesson? Hahaha! You’re making me laugh to death!”

The people behind Chu Kuang also laughed, seemingly finding Long Chen’s ignorance to be hilarious.

Long Chen also laughed, but he didn’t say anything. He just walked away with Mu Qingyun. Rather than wasting time on these idiots, he was more interested in finding what he wanted in the Divine Scripture Pavilion.

“Hold it! The young master has not finished talking! Who said you could leave- AH!”

One of those people blocked Long Chen’s path, only to be kicked in the crotch. A loud sound then rang out as his bones broke. He rolled away.

Those in the Mortal Transcendence realm could be considered to have a body between the immortal and mortal. In this state, healing was more difficult, and their body was more sensitive.

This one kick directly destroyed that person’s life rod. Other than the pain, he would probably be cut off from his ability to procreate for the rest of his life if he didn’t spend a large sum on medicine.

“Courting death!”

Chu Kuang and the others furiously took out their weapons. However, just at this moment, hundreds of law enforcement disciples came rushing over.

These people were about to curse whoever was making a ruckus when they suddenly saw it was Chu Kuang and Long Chen. A shiver then ran through their bodies.

Chu Kuang was ranked one on the Human tier divine rankings and was renowned for his viciousness. His background in particular was tough, so he was an existence that was almost untouchable in the God Institute. No one dared to provoke him.

As for Long Chen, he was a shooting star amongst the newcomers and had caused huge waves as soon as he joined the academy. He was merciless and domineering, able to kill people with a wave of his hand. He also couldn’t be provoked.

Hence, the law enforcement disciples cursed their bad luck. This just had to occur on their shift, forcing them to come.

“I don’t dare to try to mediate whatever enmity lies between the two of you, so I’ll immediately report this to the Discipline Hall. I’m sure the hall master will judge things for you,” said one of the smarter law enforcement disciples. If he didn’t want to get burnt, he would just have to toss this burning potato to someone else.

“No need.” Chu Kuang waved his hand. He didn’t conceal any of his killing intent when he looked at Long Chen. “Long San, don’t think that you can do as you please with just your little ability. I’ll teach you that in the God Institute, you are nothing more than a bug that can be crushed at any moment. The God Institute is not just what you see. Here, you are nothing more than rootless duckweed. I, Chu Kuang, can crush you to death as easily as turning my hand. If you wish to go against me, then just wait. I will slowly play with you to death.”

Chu Kuang didn’t give Long Chen a chance to reply. He left with his people.

Watching him leave, Long Chen shook his head. “I don’t even know how many people like him that I’ve killed. But there are always more begging to be killed. Not killing them feels like letting them down.”

“Chu Kuang is dangerous. He has a powerful background that protects him from all his sins. But he also meticulously makes sure not to break the rules of the God Institute, so nothing can be done about him. In this divine competition, we must beat the Prime Glory Alliance. We lost last time. If we lose again this time, we’ll no longer have a chance to win,” sighed Mu Qingyun. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“What is this competition?” asked Long Chen. He didn’t pay much attention to such things, but Mu Qingyun had brought it up so much that he was curious.

“This competition relates to your qualifications in the inner academy. Brother San, you seem unaware, but the High Firmament Academy is frighteningly big. We are currently in the outer academy, but there is still the inner academy which is the core of the academy. Entering the outer academy isn’t hard, but entering the inner academy is on another level. In particular, the God Institute and the Immortal Institute’s competition is extremely fierce. Only one side that obtains the crown gains the qualification to take the exam, and if they pass the exam, they can enter the inner academy. Last time, we lost. The Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples passed through to the inner academy, but Chu Kuang intentionally failed the exam to stay in the outer academy. Hence, he can continue participating in the competition. His goal is to block us from entering the inner academy. Furthermore, the people in his alliance only get stronger after a year of cultivating in the inner academy. There’s already a year’s difference between us. If we lose again, the difference will only grow, and there will never be a chance for us to reverse the tides. Then Chu Kuang will have achieved his goal,” said Mu Qingyun.

“Chu Kuang doesn’t mind wasting a year of his time?” asked Long Chen curiously.

“He has a powerful enough backer that even in the outer academy, he obtains the same amount of resources as that of an inner academy disciple. He just wants to stall us,” sighed Mu Qingyun.

Long Chen shook his head. “This person really is shameless. Isn’t he just drawing hate for himself? Is he not afraid of someone cutting him down for this?

Greed could destroy a person, but first it drove a person crazy. This Chu Kuang’s greed seemed so great that it didn’t leave him any chance to live. By blocking everyone here, he was just courting death.

Long Chen didn’t know what Mu Qingyun was thinking, but she suddenly blushed slightly and said, “Brother San, I’d like to ask for your help.”
