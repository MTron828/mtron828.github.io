Chapter 2071 The Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix’s Huang Feiyan

When the black clouds in the sky had begun to scatter, it meant that the tribulation was about to end. Long Chen would have obtained a supreme top grade eleventh tier medicinal pill.

However, just as the tribulation was about to end, Long Chen actually grabbed the pill furnace. The furnace suddenly grew explosively, and he smashed it at the tribulation clouds.

BOOM! The tribulation clouds blew apart from Long Chen’s blow.

The experts present couldn’t help gasping. Just what was Long Chen doing?

As expected, the world shuddered. Heavenly might gathered as tribulation clouds filled the sky as far as the eye could see. Their pressure was ten times greater than before.

“What is Long Chen doing? Is he trying to destroy the medicinal pill?!” exclaimed Beitang Rushuang. She couldn’t understand at all, and it wasn’t just her. No one present knew what Long Chen was thinking by courting death like this.

The sky split open, and lightning crashed down in the form of an executioner’s blade. It fell straight toward Long Chen.

Just at this moment, the lotus flower of light enveloping the pill suddenly appeared above Long Chen’s head.

“The pill is actually protecting him?!”

Startled cries rang out. This medicinal pill had actually accepted Long Chen as its master so quickly? How was that possible?

Higher quality pills all had some level of spirituality. But they were mostly like wild Magical Beasts. As long as they had a chance, they would flee from or even consume their masters.

However, this medicinal pill didn’t attack Long Chen, nor did it flee. It actually helped Long Chen block the lightning. This was unbelievable.

Zhao Wuji’s black face was filled with envy. His eyes looked like they were burning. For a pill to protect its master like this was heaven-defying. Its value was inestimable.

The heavenly lightning raged. Berserk swords of lightning slashed at the lotus, causing the petals to constantly shake. However, it seemed that the lotus was more than capable of blocking it.

Just as everyone was sighing in amazement over Long Chen’s luck at picking up such a priceless treasure, the lotus flower actually exploded from the wild lightning.

However, rainbow light flowed out of the pill once more, enveloping it and Long Chen, blocking the lightning.

Enveloped in the light, Long Chen had his hands clasped behind his back, looking like the very picture of a calm expert. In reality though, he was so excited that he almost shouted.

This pill was even more amazing than he had expected. This was his first time feeling that his luck was amazing. Could it be that the heavens had gone blind this time?

After all, a medicinal pill’s defensive abilities were naturally weak. That was why they were mostly destroyed by pill lightning.

For this pill to be so powerful defensively meant that it was truly heaven-defying.

Unfortunately, the lightning that Long Chen had drawn was growing increasingly powerful. The medicinal pill was finally unable to endure any longer, and its defensive light shattered.

Long Chen immediately grabbed the pill with his hand. The lightning immediately enveloped him. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, Lightning runes appeared over Long Chen’s body, forming a powerful armor that protected him.

“No wonder he dares to do this. He can control thunderforce.” People nodded, but they still didn’t understand what Long Chen’s goal was. To show that he could control thunderforce? That didn’t seem to be the case. Something as childish as that didn’t suit him.

If it wasn’t that though, what other goal could he have? He had brought on even stronger lightning that the medicinal pill couldn’t endure. That should have been within his expectations. Just what was he thinking?

Bathed within the lightning, Long Chen didn’t resist at all. He simply endured it silently.

As the lightning crashed into him, it was absorbed by Lei Long. This was Long Chen’s goal.

This thunderforce was very different from the thunderforce of cultivator tribulations. He wanted Lei Long to absorb this different kind of energy and come to control it. Then he would be able to have his pills experience pill lightning without fear of destroying them.

He simply held the pill. He couldn’t put the pill away, nor could he resist any further. That would change the nature of the tribulation. The nature of the lightning would also change.

So Long Chen simply stood there while holding the pill, allowing the lightning to fall on him and be absorbed by Lei Long.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, the lightning finally slowed down. This time, Long Chen didn’t continue attacking the tribulation.

One reason was that Lei Long had managed to control this kind of energy and replicate pill lightning. The other reason was that if he attacked it again, its nature would completely change. It would be true heavenly punishment.

The tribulation clouds scattered, and the world returned to calm. Dongfang Yuyang was the first to speak.

“Congratulations brother Long Chen. You’ve obtained a precious furnace and a precious pill. Fortune truly comes in pairs.”

“You’re too courteous. Actually, my luck has always been garbage, but my vision is just a bit better. I’m at least capable of telling trash from treasures,” said Long Chen. Those humble words were completely betrayed by his pleased expression.

Furthermore, his words contained hidden arrows for the Mechanism Sect and Zhao Wuji as they couldn’t tell what a true treasure was.

“Hmph, even if you’ve obtained a treasure, you’ll need a life to enjoy it. Long Chen, we’ll see what the future brings.” Zhao Wuji snorted and left.

“Zhao Wuji, your eyes are baleful and your face is turning black. Based on my years of reading faces, I fear that a bloody calamity is about to befall you. I’d advise you to return to your home and hide for a while,” said Long Chen.

Zhao Wuji almost fell from the sky. Grinding his teeth furiously, he acted like he hadn’t heard and vanished from sight.

Beitang Rushuang was quite delighted. Long Chen was the perfect kind of wicked to handle Zhao Wuji. She wondered whether Zhao Wuji would ever manage to fix his black face. If he couldn’t, he would probably go crazy. He was quite a vain man, and although his looks were ordinary, he had some blind confidence in his looks. He probably wouldn’t be able to face others with his current appearance.

Dongfang Yuyang returned to the ancient city after expressing his congratulations. He had many things he was busy with right now. The other experts nodded slightly toward Long Chen before leaving.

“Long Chen, are you selling this pill? I can offer you a very moving price.” As the other experts left, one woman walked forward.

She wore a dress that was the red of blood. Having a beauty mark between her eyebrows, she was both beautiful as well as haughty. She possessed a natural divine aura around her that made people too afraid to approach her.

Long Chen looked at her with surprise. The woman was also surprised when she looked at him more closely. “You have azure dragon essence blood on you, and it’s unbelievably pure.”

“You’re from the Xuan Beasts?” probed Long Chen.

“This is Huang Feiyan of the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race. Thirteen thousand years ago, she swept through the continent. She is a grand and famous expert of the Xuan Beasts. Long Chen, I’m sure you’ve heard of her,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Beitang Rushuang said this kindly. Not only did she tell him this woman’s identity, but it was also a warning. After all, Long Chen’s relationship with the Xuan Beasts was not good.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Huang Feiyang’s origins were truly great. Legend was that the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race was the descendant of the ancient divine beasts. They had inherited some terrifying divine abilities.

Since ancient times, there had always been a saying that phoenixes and dragons were auspicious symbols, but when Huang Feiyan approached him, Long Chen felt some hostility. His dragon blood automatically activated.

“Let’s return to my question. Are you selling this pill?” Huang Feiyan didn’t seem to want to discuss herself and asked once again. There was a haughty air about her, as if she was used to ordering people around. No matter how she suppressed that, Long Chen could sense it.

“Sorry, I’m not selling this pill. One of my lovers needs this pill,” said Long Chen.

This pill had the effect of nourishing the soul, and it was definitely the perfect treasure for Meng Qi. It was just as important to her as the furnace was to Long Chen.

Huang Feiyan frowned slightly. “This pill is very useful to me. I hope you can sell it to me.”

Although her words were tactful enough, her tone was filled with arrogance. Clearly, she did not accept Long Chen’s refusal.

“This pill is even more useful to my lover. Sorry, I hope you won’t make things hard on me,” said Long Chen.

After being refused twice, Huang Feiyan’s expression became colder. She nodded. “Alright, I understand.”

Huang Feiyan turned and walked away. However, midway, she turned back.

“I heard you’re very close with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race? I should warn you to do your best to distance yourself from those traitors, or you won’t have a good ending.”
