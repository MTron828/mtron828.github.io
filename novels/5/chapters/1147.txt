Chapter 1148 Timely Reinforcements

Translator: BornToBe

“What kind of attack is this? It can actually avoid the defenses of magical arts!”

Long Chen saw Cloud’s attack clearly. If its attack merely destroyed the defenses, that was one thing. After all, it was a Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow. But when Cloud’s claw reached the shield, it was like some mysterious energy had allowed it phase through the shield to land on the rank six Celestial’s body.

The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples had powerful magical arts, but their physical bodies were very weak. It was a fatal weakness, and so this rank six Celestial was instantly killed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Long Chen had no time to reflect on this. After a brief moment of shock, he shot into motion, charging at the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples who were now panicked and running in every direction.

Long Chen’s arrival instantly reversed the tide. The enemies’ two top experts were instantly killed, and the remaining ones had no will to continue fighting.

They fled, but with Cloud present, fleeing was in vain. With a flap of its wings, it transformed into a rainbow-colored light that swept back and forth, killing the ones who had fled the furthest.

“Stop! We’re disciples from the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect! If you kill us, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect won’t let you off-!”

PPFT!

One of them was killed in the midst of his shouting by one of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples. That disciple cursed, “Fuck off! You can kill us, but we can’t kill you?!”

With Cloud blocking others from fleeing and Long Chen slaughtering anyone remaining, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples rapidly fell. No matter how powerful they were, no matter what technique they used, Long Chen would kill them with a single slash of his saber.

They were quickly whittled down to just over two hundred people. In truth, even at the start, there hadn’t been many of them. They had simply relied on a combination magical art to trap all the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples. Perhaps in a one on one, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples were still slightly weaker, but now they had over ten times their number now. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples were slaughtering the panicked Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect disciples.

“Long Chen, do you still recognize this bastard?”

The battle ended quickly. All of the attackers had been killed except for one that Wang Zhen had captured alive.

As soon as Long Chen saw that person, he slapped him across the face and nodded. “I recognize him. We’ll leave him to Hua Shiyu. I’m sure the Heaven Female Alliance has many methods to make him live a life worse than death. If we kill him, it’d be a waste.”

“Do you want to do a soulsearch?” asked Wang Zhen. A soulsearch could allow them to learn why the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had suddenly attacked the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples.

Long Chen shook his head. “A core disciple like this is under the protection of his sect’s divine item. It’s the same as the Xuantian Tower Blessing we received when we joined. Others are unable to use soulsearch to see their secrets, and forcing it will end up killing him without learning anything. Time is still pressing, so I’ll mark a path. Bring your people to meet up with the Dragonblood Legion. My guess is that you’re not the only one who’s being attacked. I’m going to group up with Hua Shiyu.”

As soon as Long Chen finished speaking, he called back Cloud and the two of them vanished in a ray of light.

Seeing Long Chen leave, a slightly forlorn expression appeared on Wang Zhen’s face. When it came to leading people, he could only stare at Long Chen’s back. “He’s a true leader.”

“Guild head, Long Chen’s a leader, but you’re also a leader. You’re both equally outstanding in our hearts. You sacrificed so many of your housepets that you raised for many years because of us, and even risked your life to hold back those two rank six Celestials. Just that is enough for us to follow you forever. Even if we had to choose again, we’d still follow you!” cried a disciple.

The other disciples also stood up and agreed. Wang Zhen was a rare insect cultivator, and his housepets were like his life. But in order to reduce his people’s casualties, he had lost practically all of them. And yet, he hadn’t even frowned before doing so. That touched all of them.

“Good brother, there’s no need for such words between us. Let’s go gather with the Dragonblood Legion.” Seeing all these disciples looking at him with zealotry, Wang Zhen was moved.

He had always been a somewhat icy person. He had merely established the Ten Thousand Insect Guild because it was part of his duties as a core disciple. Beyond that, he had never had any wild thoughts of fighting for supremacy.

But Long Chen had changed Wang Zhen’s way of thinking, as every member of the Dragonblood Legion was following Long Chen to the death. Thus, for the first time in his life, Wang Zhen thought of leading a group of people that he could treat as life and death brothers.

Later, he was fully convinced by Long Chen’s charisma, but at the same time, he was feeling more and more ashamed of himself, feeling like he wasn’t a capable leader.

However, today, he could feel the trust and support that all his people gave him. Just like Long Chen, he also had a group of hot-blooded brothers that were loyal to him.

Wang Zhen began to lead them according to the direction Long Chen had indicated. As for Long Chen, he was rushing straight to Hua Shiyu’s position with Cloud.

Fortunately, the distance between them wasn’t that far. Cloud quickly reached Hua Shiyu’s group with its peak speed.

“What are you doing here, Long Chen?” Hua Shiyu was surprised to see him arrive.

“My Dragonblood Legion has too many men, making life too boring. Hehe, you understand,” joked Long Chen.

Long Chen jumped onto their flying boat while leaving Cloud to hide itself above the clouds. Perhaps he had arrived too early. But that was good in any case.

Hua Shiyu didn’t know what was going on, as the distress signal had only gone out to Long Chen’s master jade tablet. Hua Shiyu was capable of using her jade tablet to send out a distress call, but she couldn’t receive it. Their jade tablets were only able to sense each other’s locations.

There was no way around it. If all their tablets could receive distress signals, their effective range would have to be greatly shortened. In order to keep their range as great as possible, their flexibility had to be reduced.

“Aren’t you worried about Meng Qi and Wan-er coming to find you?” Hua Shiyu might not like any men, but she treated Long Chen differently. She actually joked back.

“Haha, I’m not afraid. But in any case, they’ll never know,” laughed Long Chen. It was unknown whether or not it was because of the touching that had occurred last time, but Hua Shiyu was much warmer to him now.

Long Chen’s arrival caused the Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples to erupt into cheering, and they charged over.

That made Hua Shiyu roar, “Are you all done with your work?! Have all the sea demons been killed? or you don’t even care about this chance to make money?!”

“Long Chen is the Xuantian Dao Sect’s most outstanding figure. If his wise eyes start to favor one of us, who would care about points? They’d be nothing in comparison, hehe!” Some of the women immediately retorted.

Although Hua Shiyu was icy to outsiders, especially men, she treated her own people very well. After being together for so long, her disciples had long since realized her character. Her exterior was like a blade, but her heart was soft inside. They weren’t afraid at all.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, when are you going to win over our alliance master? Then all the Heaven Female Alliance’s beauties would attend to you!” One of the particularly brazen maidens shouted such a valiant thing.

Long Chen was struck dumb. There was such a possibility? By winning over one, he’d win over tens of thousands of other beauties? No, there was no way he could think of such a thing. But if he didn’t think of it, wouldn’t he be less than a beast?

Hua Shiyu turned red, and she searched for the person who had just shouted. But that woman was smart, and she had run immediately after shouting.

“Hahaha, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s women are all here? Excellent! Not one of you will get away today! Brothers, we’ll be able to play to our heart’s content tonight!”

Suddenly, a huge flying boat appeared in front of them without any warning.

Buzz.

Over ten thousand figures appeared in the air, and each one of them waved a staff. Together, they formed a spherical barrier to envelop the whole Heaven Female Alliance.

At the same time, ice began to float in the air, condensing into huge icicles that sealed the world.

“Girls from the Xuantian Dao Sect, come receive your guests.”

Just as the Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples were shocked and panicked, a group of people appeared outside the barrier.

Seeing the person speaking, Long Chen narrowed his eyes. It was once more a familiar person. This was the person with the disgusting mouth who had fought against Tang Wan-er. Although he was masked, he didn’t conceal his voice at all.

“You’re that bastard from the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect! Don’t think we won’t recognize you just because you’re wearing a mask!” shouted the Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples.

Long Chen shook his head. Perhaps he had done this on purpose in order to make the Heaven Female Alliance’s women guess their status. Then they would think this was a battle, not a slaughter.

Long Chen saw that whether it was Hua Shiyu or Zhao Ziyan, no one had recognized the severity of this attack. Right now, they were all just furiously cursing at the figures outside the barrier.

If they had immediately launched an all-out attack when the barrier first formed, there would have been a chance to escape.

But that chance vanished quickly. By guessing their opponent’s status, they lost sight of the fact that they were currently in a death trap.

Long Chen couldn’t help but feel a bit helpless. Perhaps Wang Zhen had also been baited like this. Taking advantage of when they were shocked and still didn’t understand, their death trap was perfectly set up. By the time they understood, it would be too late.

Long Chen continued to hide amongst the crowd. None of these attackers had seen him yet. And at this moment, another figure appeared outside the barrier, one that caused Hua Shiyu and the others’ expressions to change.
