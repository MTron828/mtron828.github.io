Chapter 4163 Incomparable Genius, Starry River Sage

“How can this be?!”

When Long Chen saw countless people collapsing on the ground in the palace, clutching their heads and howling in pain, he was completely stunned.

“I don’t know either. They looked at the starry sea diagram at the heart of the palace and immediately collapsed like this. I’ve already forbidden others from entering the palace!” said Huang Hui hastily.

“Starry sea diagram?”

Long Chen immediately ran into the palace that was still growing out of the ground. Now, there was a divine pool at the heart of the palace, and you could see stars within the divine pool that moved like the workings of the cosmos.

Actually, the star diagram did not look like a diagram and more like a true starry river. The more Long Chen looked, the deeper and further it seemed, giving him a hair-raising feeling.

It felt like he was lost deep in the sea, as if some monster would devour him whole at any possible moment.

“They looked at the star diagram and then turned into this state. They said that it made their heads feel like exploding,” said Huang Hui. Contrary to Long Chen, his head was lowered, as he didn’t dare to look at the divine pool.

“This is the true divine diagram of the Starry River. The Starry River Sage probably created the Starry River of the Sky Art based on it. This is the true beginning and the true end. Also, the star diagrams in the side palaces are steps toward this divine diagram. Without taking those first steps, jumping straight to the final step results in this,” said Long Chen, beckoning to the fallen disciples.

Long Chen checked their bodies and found that their astral energy was in disarray. However, it wasn’t too serious; only their souls were shaken.

Long Chen then took out some medicinal pills and had people distribute them. After consuming those pills, these people slowly recovered from the pain.

With this lesson, everyone became much more careful and didn’t dare to randomly look around. Long Chen then directed them to start with the two characters on the gate, the Starry River characters.

Whether or not they could comprehend these two characters was not that important. Long Chen would give them a more detailed explanation later. The main thing was not to mess up the order of starting from the basics before going into deeper waters.

It would be best if they could comprehend things themselves. But if they couldn’t, it wasn’t a huge deal either. It was just that they could not vainly try to continue onward without comprehending the steps before it.

Long Chen also started off with the Starry River characters, which was the most foundational entry point. It was also the simplest to comprehend. With one look, you would understand.

However, the actual realm inside of it was not so simple. Compared to the ruins of the Starry River Palace, the inheritance here was actually more complete. Even Long Chen was benefitting immensely after observing it.

After looking at the Starry River characters, Long Chen went into the first side palace and looked at the first mural, then the second mural, and the third.

Every side palace had nine murals, and there were a total of nine side palaces. Overall, there were a total of eighty-one starry murals to look over.

The star diagrams started off simple but gradually grew more complex. At first, they were clear, but then they grew seemingly messy. By the ninth palace, the star diagrams were chaotic, giving people a headache with just a look.

Huang Hui managed to follow Long Chen all the way to the fifth palace before he was forced to stop. Here, he was unable to instantly comprehend the diagrams any longer.

As for the ordinary people, they were still stuck at the first palace. Fortunately, the palace was big enough to fit them all.

Long Chen stayed in the ninth palace for three full days. In the end, he found that the nine starry murals were nine kinds of divine arts.

However, these nine divine arts had many problematic areas. With the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, Long Chen was able to understand the Starry River Sage’s intent. But after examining these nine murals for a long time, he came to the conclusion that these nine divine arts were actually incomplete.

In other words, the Starry River Sage himself was unable to use these nine divine arts. He hadn’t reached that height and had relied entirely on his intelligence to deduce these techniques.

“The Starry River Sage’s intelligence really is unfathomable. He clearly had only taken three steps, but managed to deduce all the way to the ninth step. This kind of intelligence is something that I will never be able to reach.” Long Chen couldn’t help sighing in amazement.

Although there were some mistakes in the ninth step, the first eight steps were perfect, and the ninth step was also mostly correct. After seeing it, Long Chen was filled with admiration.

Long Chen then summoned his own starry sea manifestation. Using the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art as the foundation, he corrected the Starry River of the Sage Art. In the end, he managed to deduce these nine techniques.

As Long Chen raised his hand, a star diagram appeared on his palm. In this state, his hand almost couldn’t be seen because it was entirely covered in tiny stars.

“What power. Although it’s not on the same level as the Dragon King Battle Armor, it’s only one level weaker.” Looking at this starry palm, Long Chen was amazed. “The Heavenly Daos change, but astral energy remains eternal. It is more reliable than Heavenly Dao energy.”

Long Chen slowly reached out and clenched his hand, causing cracks to appear in the void. This high concentration of power shocked Long Chen, and he felt even greater admiration for the Starry River Sage.

Moreover, this was only one technique of the star diagrams. The rest of them could unleash astral energy through fists, feet, elbows, heads, and other areas.

Some were offensive and some were defensive. But coming up with these divine arts was the Starry River Sage’s limit, and these techniques still had many flaws. If they could all be merged into one technique, then it would be perfect.

Even so, getting this far on his own was already very amazing. If Long Chen wanted to connect all these moves into one, he would have to think about it himself. After all, the Starry River Sage had opened up a path that was unimaginable for him.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The Starry River of the Sky Art was created based on the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, so it was at least a good consultation point for Long Chen.

However, if this powerful technique came from the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, then where did the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art come from? The Starry River Sage was already so incredible, so what about the Nine Star Master?

Long Chen was almost unable to believe it. Compared to these seniors, he felt miniscule.

When Long Chen arrived at the main palace, he found that it was already erected nicely. The central divine pool had the divine radiance of a starry river flowing within it, illuminating the ceiling above.

The ceiling had no designs on it, but when the divine radiance illuminated it, Long Chen could see a starry river slowly flowing. It was as if it was following a set path, flowing in an endless loop.

“So that’s the case. This is the original form of the starry river. To go from one to nine, and then back to one. However, this one is not the old one. The Grand Dao is simple. You start at one, end at nine, and return to one. But without going through the first one, you cannot understand the last one. Cycle after cycle, you understand more and more layers. Although it looks like you’re just repeating the same thing, the height is different. The Starry River of the Sky Art is like this, and the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art should be the same. Does that mean that there is a return to the start after cultivating the nine stars? But what is the start?” Long Chen was lost in thought.

The final mural was actually the beginning of the Starry River of the Sky Art, and it was also a new starting point. After all, the Starry River repeated itself in an endless loop, giving Long Chen some inspiration.

“Boss, the Soaring Dragon Company’s people have come.”

Long Chen was in the midst of pondering this new enlightenment when Guo Ran came running in.
