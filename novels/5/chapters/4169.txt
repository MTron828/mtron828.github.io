Chapter 4158 Ice Soul Flame Lotus

BOOM!

When the snow-white lotus smashed into the barrier, the latter was like a thin layer of ice being crushed by a roller. It was instantly pierced through.

On the other hand, the snow lotus was like a beautiful ice statue smashing into the experts of the Pelican race, blowing countless people into smithereens. Like shattered ice statues, blood-red ice fragments flew through the air.

BOOM!

The snow lotus then exploded, unleashing a torrent of white flames that swiftly ravaged the Pelican race's camp. Just like that, ice covered the land, and flames burned the skies. Hundreds of thousands of experts were obliterated from existence.

The screams of terror from the Pelican race seemed to echo in people’s ears, but they slowly faded away.

“Truly worthy of being the rank eighth Ice Soul. It truly possesses apocalyptic power.” When Long Chen looked at the devastation around him, he was astonished. After all, he hadn’t used the Ice Soul’s power in a long time.

Huo Linger’s power had grown immensely during this time. Although this one attack was a bit overboard, it was all to display his power.

Such a terrifying attack was probably something only an innate Heaven Venerate could block. Unfortunately, the Pelican race’s only innate Heaven Venerate was already slain, leaving them with only a messy rabble.

The attack from the Ice Soul shook heaven and earth, making all the surrounding experts quiver, including the innate Heaven Venerates.

“I, Long Chen, don’t cause trouble, but I’m not afraid of it. If you talk reason with me, we can talk reason. If you talk fists, we can also talk with fists. But if you want my life, don’t blame me for being merciless. If anyone thinks that I am a soft persimmon, just try and crush me.” Long Chen’s gaze roved around the crowd, and his voice echoed throughout heaven and earth.

As this was the demonic beast race’s territory, Long Chen’s words were truly a bit wild. However, not one of the experts present dared to say anything.

Innate Heaven Venerates didn’t dare to attack Long Chen for fear of the curse, and ordinary Heaven Venerates and below were too terrified to move after that attack. Hence, the entire battlefield was silent; no one dared to speak.

The Pelican race had tried to use the enmity between the demonic beast race and the human race to get all of them to attack Long Chen together. Had Long Chen not decisively crushed the Pelican race, their plan might have succeeded. Nevertheless, Long Chen had no intention of squandering his time battling a group of clowns. Although he wasn’t afraid of them, it was still a waste of effort.

Seeing that no one dared to make a sound, Long Chen waved his hand and brought the Dragonblood Legion away, continuing on their way.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As for the demonic beasts around them, they didn’t say anything. No one dared to insult them, and no one dared to get in their way. The tyrannical demonic beast race was very obedient now.

“It really is the case of kind people are bullied just like good horses are ridden. Against these people, you can’t give them any face. You should just directly slap them, then they’ll be obedient,” said Guo Ran with a sneer.

Previously, because of the Fullmoon race, they had treated the other beast races a bit friendlier. But while they acted friendly, others viewed them as being subservient. Now though, those people could no longer be arrogant. Seeing Long Chen destroy the Pelican race with one attack, these people didn’t dare to say a word.

Long Chen and the others continued on their way. But before they got out of this region, more beast races began to warn and even curse them.

Shaking their heads, Long Chen and the others ignored them. They were already prepared. As long as anyone dared to attack them, they would start a slaughter. In the cultivation world, only slaughter could win respect. Talking reason with them was like climbing a tree to catch a fish.

Unfortunately, although these demonic beast races warned and cursed them, none of them dared to attack. That made Guo Ran and the others feel a bit disappointed.

Guo Ran had said that the next time they encountered an innate Heaven Venerate demonic beast, they should attack together and make them bleed first. That way, they could gather more high-level demonic beast essence blood.

Also, their essence blood had to be gathered before the curse struck them. Once they were cursed, their essence blood could no longer be used.

“It seems that the Pelican race is fated to run into this tribulation. We’ve passed through the camps of so many demonic beast races, but only they attacked us.”

“Boss, tell me, is luck really dependable?” asked Guo Ran.

“This thing is quite mysterious, so I can’t say anything for sure. If it really exists, then it means that some things are fated by an unseen world and can’t be changed. However, if many things are already set in stone by the time we are born, what is the point of us cultivating? We are all normal people. Normal people are born, grow old, and die. However, to cultivate is to defy the heavens. A mortal becomes an immortal by going against the Heavenly Daos. If the Heavenly Daos were to punish people for such a thing, wouldn’t all of us already be dead?” said Long Chen.

“Then boss, are you saying that luck doesn’t exist?” asked Guo Ran.

“No, it definitely exists, or how the fuck would I always be so unlucky?” said Long Chen firmly.

Everyone laughed at that.

“However, this matter with the Pelican race really is a bit strange. Perhaps their race’s karmic luck was already on its downfall, causing all kinds of unlucky things to follow them. Did you notice that before we even arrived, their neighbors also weren’t very friendly toward them? Also, once their patriarch died, according to reason, they should act much more obedient as they have no one else to depend on. As all the surrounding experts were just watching, unwilling to take the slightest risk for them, they continued to provoke us in a suicidal manner. All these things made it seem as if they were truly trying to die. It doesn’t really make sense. It’s like there was an invisible hand pushing them into the abyss. Now, we’ve killed the Pelican race’s elites, and without them, the Pelican race will probably die out. When their enemies come, they’ll very likely go extinct,” said Long Chen solemnly.

Everyone else was solemn as well. The existence known as luck was truly ephemeral. It was invisible and couldn’t be touched. But it was a power that others revered.

After flying for four hours, Long Chen and the others finally reached the end of the demonic beast race’s domain. They also began to sense human auras.

When they left the domain of the demonic beast race, they saw a crazy battle between the demonic beast race and the human race’s heavenly geniuses. They were killing each other.

At the dividing line of both races’ domains, dozens of human heavenly geniuses were fighting the demonic beast race’s heavenly geniuses, all one-on-one. All experts in the surroundings were cheering them on.

“The Sage King Convention hasn’t even started, but people are already impatient? Is this some kind of training?” asked Guo Ran somewhat speechlessly.

Guo Ran had just spoken when a demonic beast expert clawed the chest of a human expert, tearing the latter apart.

“It’s not training.”

Long Chen shook his head. This portrayed the enmity between the human race and the demonic beast race. They were fighting with their lives on the line.

“That’s the seventh one. The human race really is trash, only fit to prostrate toward the demonic beast race.”

After slaying that human expert, the demonic beast expert sneered at the group of human heavenly geniuses.

“He’s too arrogant! I’ll deal with him.”

A Dragonblood warrior stepped out from the Dragonblood Legion.
