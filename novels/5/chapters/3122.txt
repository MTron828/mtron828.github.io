Chapter 3111 The Lecherous Wuji

When Long Chen was sent to the martial stage, countless cheers rang out. Long Chen’s reputation preceded him now. They were all full of anticipation to see him fight.

As for his opponent, it was a white-robed man. Looking at Long Chen, he smiled bitterly.

“Ah, whatever. Brother Long is one of the people I admire the most. I admit defeat in this battle.” That person sighed and directly admitted defeat.

The only reason he had gone onto the stage was to greet Long Chen. Or perhaps he had had an urge to fight before, but upon seeing Long Chen, he gave up.

Long Chen cupped his fists toward that person to express his thanks. This person was an expert. If they were to fight all-out, Long Chen would need some effort to beat him. He might even need to expose some trump cards. So Long Chen had accepted a favor from this person.

Long Chen passed easily, leaving others disappointed. But there was no way around it. The terrifying power that Long Chen had displayed against Chu Gan had intimidated his competitors.

If they fought Long Chen and forced him to reveal his trump cards, then he might just kill them. While ranking was important, their lives were more important. Everyone had their own goals, and there was no need to be so reckless in this competition. After all, this round wasn’t even for deciding the top hundred.

Hence, the good start to the show didn’t appear. Long Chen passed just like this. The second round then started, and it was much more intense. Both fighters were Primals who were power types, and they instantly started a fierce fight. After hundreds of exchanges, one of them finally admitted defeat, but Long Chen and the others shook their heads.

The two of them were so evenly matched that they were forced to unleash all their trump cards. The winner had even ignited their essence blood to obtain victory.

After this victory, they probably wouldn’t recover in time. There was no chance that they would win the next round, so doing this wasn’t entirely worth it.

The third round started. Unexpectedly, one of them was Gui Yun. But his opponent admitted defeat before they were even sent onto the stage.

“I asked around. That deadly fatty Gui Yun and the giant Ku Wuya didn’t even have to fight once. Anyone matched against them directly admitted defeat. Who would have thought that no one would dare to fight them even at this stage?” said Lu Mingxuan.

“It’s so exaggerated? Then they’re on track to win just by lying down,” said Bai Xiaole.

“The Elders have probably warned their disciples to avoid those two. However, they won’t be able to be so relaxed for long. When they encounter real experts, they’ll be competing with their real power, not fame,” said Long Chen.

The competition continued. According to the rules, they had to finish their fight within one incense stick’s worth of time, or both of them were eliminated.

That was a short time. True experts that were evenly matched had difficulty deciding a winner in that short time. Some people even felt that their chances of winning in that short time were too low, or that paying a huge price to win wasn’t worth it, so they admitted defeat.

Hence, the competition progressed quickly. Over ten fights ended in less than an hour. But the next clash caused an uproar.

There was a shameless fellow who was clearly a level weaker than his opponent, but because he was an earth element expert who countered his opponent, he managed to stall him for a long time. Midway through the fight, he actually demanded some profit for him to admit defeat, or they would both be eliminated.

In the end, his opponent gave him thirty thousand immortal crystals and two top grade Spirit items before that person was satisfied and admitted defeat.

“As expected, there are all kinds of people. Even a grand Primal can be so shameless?” Luo Ning shook her head. Her eyes had been opened to the world.

The main thing was that both of them were truly shameless. One was willing to be bought, and one was willing to buy. Neither was better than the other.

However, there was no rule against this. It could be said that the two of them had grasped a loophole. Although they were looked down upon, they were still willing.

“Quick, look! It’s young master Wuji!” exclaimed Lu Mingxuan.

“That bastard, he actually managed to make it here.” Luo Bing and the others greatly detested this person. They hadn’t expected him to get into the top five hundred.

As for his opponent, it was a woman with a sword on her back. Young master Wuji smiled sinisterly when he saw his opponent.

“Young lady, you’re not a match for me. You should just give up and dual cultivate with me. We can rise through the immortal realm and reach the realm of perfection together.” Young master Wuji smiled, a perverted look in his eyes.

“Die!” His opponent was enraged, and her manifestation appeared behind her. She instantly activated her primal bloodline and slashed her sword at him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She was shockingly fast. As a result, Young master Wuji was unable to dodge in time and was cut in two, stunning everyone.

“A puppet art.” Long Chen curled his lips. Just as he said this, Luo Bing and the others realized that this woman had slain a puppet, not young master Wuji.

The puppet exploded, and a burst of fragrance filled the stage, causing his opponent’s expression to change. She hastily fell back, but just as she moved, she found that her body was stiff. A hand then caught the back of her neck.

“Young lady, you’re too naive. You fell for it so easily. Shouldn’t you beg this young master for mercy now? As long as you agree to be my slave, this young master will treat you properly, hahaha!” Zhao Wuji was surrounded by mist, hidden in it. At this moment, runes flowed down his hand, covering her body.

Those runes were like vipers coiling around her body. Young master Wuji was extremely sinister. Those runes were squeezing her body, forcibly exposing her curves. It was a clear humiliation.

She wanted to struggle, but her gaze became sluggish. The puppet that she had slain contained poison, and she had fallen for it. Hence, she felt a mix of panic and anger.

“Keep struggling. I like seeing such pure women struggling. The more you struggle, the more excited I get…” Young master Wuji smiled lecherously and even kissed her cheek.

“Bastard!”

“Shameless!”

“I’ll kill him right now!”

Seeing him act like this and humiliate a Primal, countless people were enraged.

“Promise to dual cultivate with me, and I’ll spare your life. Otherwise, hehe…” Young master Wuji ignored those curses, seemingly fearless.

“Die…”

The woman suddenly choked out a furious cry, and a rune lit up on her forehead. Seeing this, Young master Wuji’s expression completely changed, and he hastily pushed her away.

BOOM!

Her body then exploded, and it filled the stage with blood mist. She had chosen to self-detonate.
