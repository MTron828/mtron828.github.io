Chapter 2822 Who Is More Ruthless?

It was a giant flying boat. Due to a mountain blocking their vision and its extreme speed, there was no time to react before it crashed into them.

If it weren’t for Long Chen, they would have been struck along with the immortal beast. Although it wouldn’t be so serious that they would die from the impact, it would be difficult to avoid injury.

At this moment, Long Chen’s expression darkened, and killing intent appeared in his eyes. The angle that this flying boat had come out of was off; it had clearly been trying to hit them.

Without the flying immortal beast, the two of them fell from the sky. Since they hadn’t ignited their divine flames, there was no way for them to float in midair.

Just at that moment, another flying beast flew over and caught them. It was Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu who just so happened to be the closest to them.

The flying beast wasn’t large enough to carry all four of them, but it was at least strong enough that it didn’t plummet even with the additional weight.

“How hateful! That is their hunting flying boat! Also, this is not one of the official paths for flying boats! They were trying to hit us!” Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu were filled with fury. Mu Qingyun also stared at the flying boat darkly. Seeing it, she knew which bastards were behind this.

The flying boat slowed down after hitting them. It then slowly advanced as if trying to show off its martial might.

“Do you have any heavy weapons?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“What? I have a heavy rod,” Mu Qingyun answered in surprise.

“Give it to me.”

“But the flying beast can’t endure it…”

If they took out such a heavy weapon on the immortal beast, it would instantly plummet with them on it.

“It’s fine. Toss it over,” said Long Chen.

Mu Qingyun didn’t know what Long Chen wanted to do. However, she still formed hand seals and summoned a bronze rod. As soon as it appeared, Long Chen tossed it into the primal chaos space.

He was extremely fast, putting it away before it affected the immortal beast.

“Chase them,” said Long Chen to Zhong Ling.

“We can’t catch up to them. Also…” Zhong Ling hesitated. What could they do even if they chased? They would be inviting trouble to themselves.

“Listen to me. If I don’t make them bleed a bit today, they won’t know that I’m not to be provoked,” said Long Chen darkly.

There were truly many people who wanted to die. If he didn’t make them reserve themselves a bit, he would have to constantly deal with them in the academy. When would he have time to raise his own power then?

“Alright.” Zhong Ling seemed to trust Long Chen and sent the immortal beast flying over. The flying boat slowed down, allowing it to catch up. It was as if they were taunting Long Chen and the others, which further proved that they had struck them intentionally.

“Third brother, it’s no good. A flying boat is ten times faster than us. We can’t catch up.” After a while, they ended up maintaining a certain distance from each other. The flying boat occasionally sped up and slowed down, toying with them.

“It’s fine. Just keep chasing. Leave the rest to me,” said Long Chen. A sword then appeared in his hand.

Long Chen snapped the sword. After that, he held a six-inch fragment of it and slowly stood. Bending down, he was like a leopard eyeing its prey for an opening.

That single-minded concentration and sharp gaze shook Mu Qingyun and the others’ hearts. The current Long Chen seemed to have returned to his cold and frightening state.

“Now!”

When the flying boat once more slowed down to taunt them and the distance between them closed, Long Chen suddenly stamped down.

The immortal beast dropped hundreds of meters, causing Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu to cry out. Long Chen shot out.

Long Chen then tossed the fragment of the sword into the air as he jumped, and while it was midair, his foot stepped down on it. Using it as another step, he jumped further. While the fragment of the sword smashed into the ground like a meteor, Long Chen gracefully soared into the sky.

Long Chen then reached the flying boat. At that moment, Mu Qingyun’s bronze rod appeared.

With a thunderous roar, Long Chen smashed the rod into the rear of the flying boat. There was a giant vent there with flickering runes, and it was the central hub that gave the flying boat propulsion.

As a result, with an explosive sound, the rear of the flying boat exploded and Long Chen was bloodied by the impact. With the support of his spiritual yuan, the backlash sent him flying back.

Just at that moment, Zhong Ling caught him as he fell, having controlled the immortal beast to fly over.

Long Chen then grabbed her hand and stabilized himself on the immortal beast’s back. Their cooperation was excellent.

The flying boat’s formations were seemingly out of control. It then spun through the air until it smashed toward a mountain.

“Heavens, no way!” Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu covered their eyes.

BOOM!

The flying boat smashed into the mountain, sending bits and pieces flying in every direction. It was unknown if the people inside were alive or dead. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

At this moment, Mu Qingyun’s expression changed slightly. Long Chen was truly vicious. That flying boat contained a hunting squad, and there were thousands of disciples on it. If they died just like this, Long Chen would have brought a giant calamity onto himself.

However, when she looked at him, she saw that his expression was completely at ease as if this was a completely insignificant matter.

“Let’s go. I’m getting hungry. We had to use quite a bit of energy just now, so we’ll need to eat a bit more to make up for it.”

Long Chen’s heart was beating a bit too fast. Without the support of his spiritual yuan, he had used up too much power just now. Immortal qi had poured into his body, overloading it. This was because his mortal qi was still too dense. He had to think of some way to hurry and expel it, or this feeling of not being able to use his power would drive him mad. How would he fight others like this?

“Should we go take a look?” asked Mu Qingyun uneasily. If there were gravely wounded people, they would still be able to save them if they went now. If many people died, it would be troublesome.

“There’s nothing to see. Their luck was not bad. That mountain was severely eroded by the wind. The mountain might have collapsed, but it just served as a cushion. They won’t die. At most, they’ll have some broken bones. Damn, if they had run into the neighboring cliff, then all their bones would have been torn apart. How regretful.” Long Chen shook his head.

Hearing his words, Mu Qingyun felt a chill. This viciousness shook her. Long Chen actually wanted all of them to die? He had guts.

However, his words also made her relax. She recalled the exact scene of the flying boat crashing into the mountain, and it seemed that he was right. This mountain wasn’t very tough, so it shouldn’t be too bad for the people inside.

She then led everyone on their original path. This matter made the worship in Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu’s eyes grow. The way that Long Chen had used the broken sword to reach the flying boat in particular amazed them, and they truly wanted to learn from him.

Just as these two sisters were talking, the immortal beasts descended on their destination. As for the missing immortal beast, she reported it to the guards there. Moreover, this matter definitely wouldn’t end here. They would definitely have to face the court again, but she was already used to such a thing.

Mu Qingyun then led the way to an ancient, tall building. As soon as they entered, waves of fragrance washed over them, and Long Chen’s stomach instantly started grumbling, causing the sisters to laugh.

“Brother Long’s stomach is hungry. Let’s hurry.” Mu Qingyun smiled. Although she wasn’t too familiar with Long Chen, his normal frank character made others very comfortable. They didn’t need to restrain themselves when with him.

Long Chen had only just stepped onto the second floor when a sneer rang out. “How disappointing. Does the Precious Delicacy Pavilion allow just anyone to enter?”

Long Chen was startled as that voice was a bit familiar. He then looked around and was surprised. How did this fellow end up appearing here?
