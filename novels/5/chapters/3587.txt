Chapter 3576

“Stop! Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen is one of us! You better stop before going too far!” shouted Tu Hu furiously.

The disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College were split into factions. Originally, there were three heavenly geniuses in the college, each with their own faction.

Later on, Guo Ran joined and they discovered that he had astonishing forging talent. He forcibly broke the solid structure of the college, becoming the fourth peak heavenly geniuses of the college and turning the Three Heavenly Dragon Heroes into four.

However, his growth was very difficult. The other three factions all applied pressure on him. For him to climb one step at a time in this environment, it was unknown just how much torment he had to struggle through.

Originally, a person like Guo Ran with no foundation and no background should have long since been crushed to death under their pressure. However, his luck was very good. During a Dao discussion, his words were heard by the dean of the college.

The dean personally gave Guo Ran some praise, and after that, his position soared. With even the dean speaking up for him, others no longer dared to crush Guo Ran.

However, while they didn’t dare to want his life, the pressure that they applied in other areas never diminished. That was especially true when Guo Ran’s worshippers formed the fourth faction. They were like water and fire with the other three factions. Although it wasn’t to the point of life and death, there were endless squabbles between them. Every time the other side had a chance, they would do their best to humiliate Guo Ran’s side.

Although Guo Ran was constantly suppressed by all the other three factions, he still had countless worshippers fully loyal to him. That was because Guo Ran sincerely helped them, teaching them. People followed Guo Ran due to his character.

However, Guo Ran’s faction was still the weakest of the four factions and was often the target of bullying. As for the higher-ups, they seemed to not bother with those things. Even if you reported it, it was meaningless.

That was another reason why that disciple would sigh so dispiritedly on the battleship. They felt that the higher-ups were worthless.

With the current crisis, rather than trying to unite everyone against their common enemies, they continued to allow this kind of internal squabbling. It was truly difficult to endure.

Originally, Guo Ran’s faction should have been the one guarding this entrance around this time. But some change must have occurred. There was a last-minute shift change. That was why Tu Hu’s heart thudded when he saw those people.

“Silence! Let yourselves be captured and don’t resist, or you will be executed!” sneered their leader.

Clearly, they didn’t care if Long Chen was a spy or not. All they wanted was an open reason to attack Tu Hu and the others.

Hundreds of guards in armor surrounded them, pointing their weapons at them. They didn’t give Tu Hu and the others any chance to summon their armor. Tu Hu quivered from rage.

“Zhao Qing, do you know who he is?! If you block us, senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran won’t let you off!” roared Tu Hu.

That person called Zhao Qing suddenly had his helmet open, revealing his face. He cast a glance at Long Chen and disdainfully said, “Who does he think he is? Even if he personally came with Guo Ran, so what? I’ll give you your warning right now, get on the ground with your hands behind your back, or you’ll be executed. I’ll give you to the count of three. Don’t force me to kill anyone! Three… two…”

Crack.

Suddenly, a hand caught his throat. That metallic armor was as weak as mud in front of that hand. It was instantly crushed.

Long Chen had Zhao Qing’s throat in his hand, and he raised him up like a chicken.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!” Tu Hu and the others cried out in alarm.

Just then, over ten people attacked Long Chen at once, their weapons piercing toward him.

Suddenly, an explosive sound rang out. It was the sound of metal shattering mixed with the sound of bodies exploding. People didn’t even clearly see what had happened before those people exploded along with their armor. They were all killed.

Tu Hu and the others were stunned. Long Chen had actually killed people here? Now, they were horrified. It was completely forbidden to kill people here.

“You asked me who I thought I was? Why don’t you tell me who you think I am?”

Long Chen coldly looked at Zhao Qing. Then, applying a bit more force with his hand, Zhao Qing’s body exploded, transforming into blood mist.

Just then, the grand formation rumbled as someone had activated it. Tu Hu and the others’ hair then stood on end. They were locked down by the grand formation.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a figure flew out and slashed the grand formation, piercing a hole through it with a sword. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“What?!”

Everyone jumped in shock. At some point, a beautiful maiden with a flame sword, wearing a black and red dress, appeared by Long Chen’s side. She had pierced the barrier with a single stroke of her sword. The energy that the formation was gathering instantly dissipated.

This was naturally Huo Linger. The moment they arrived in Clear Rain City, she had already awakened. It was because she had awakened that Long Chen dared to directly attack those devil beasts.

After all, he had only been testing his dragon might back then. If it failed, he would have needed Huo Linger’s assistance.

The current Huo Linger had finished devouring the Yan Xu Flame. The only regretful thing was that ultimately, she was unable to control the Yan Xu Flame’s runes. That was because there were no core flames within the Yan Xu Flames that she had devoured.

Despite that, having devoured so many Yan Xu Flames allowed her to control a trace of the Yan Xu Flame’s power.

Although she was unable to do the same as with the Ice Soul and condense a rune for a big move, just a trace of the Yan Xu Flame’s power was already incomparably powerful. It possessed terrifying destructive power toward formation barriers in particular.

Thus, Huo Linger who wielded the True Fire Sword instantly pierced the barrier. The attack brewing by the formation was instantly interrupted.

However, now that a hole was pierced into the barrier, an ear-splitting alarm rang out.

Long Chen looked back at Hu Tu and the others. “Sorry, I came to the Alldevil Star-Field to save someone, not to be bullied. My time is very precious. Someone who maliciously wastes my time is harming my life. That is my enemy. And against my enemies, I have never had any mercy. Since they didn’t want to let me in, I could only kill my way in.”

Just like that, Long Chen stepped through the hole in the barrier and walked toward the city. Huo Linger walked behind him with the True Fire Sword, flames burning around her.

Wherever Huo Linger went was incinerated by flames. The void collapsed, and heaven and earth twisted. The entire world was about to be ignited by her. That terrifying pressure scared others witless.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we can talk properly…!”

Hu Tu hastily chased after Long Chen. His appearance was truly like he was about to massacre all the inhabitants here. If that happened, all of them would become villains.

“Who dares to come to my Heavenly Dragon City…”

Just then, the sky rumbled and countless armored experts appeared. The person at the front shouted, but that shout was cut off midway. When he saw that black figure, he was dumbstruck.

“Is there anywhere beneath the heavens that I don’t dare to go to?” Long Chen looked at that figure with a faint smile. Long Chen couldn’t see his face, but he would forever remember that voice.

“Boss…!”

Guo Ran’s armor vanished. He then threw himself in front of Long Chen and knelt on the ground, hugging Long Chen’s leg and weeping.
