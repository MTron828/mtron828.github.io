Chapter 4229 Secrets of the Shadows

When Long Chen looked in a certain direction, through the endless sea of dark creatures, people saw some vague shadowy figures.

There was no shade, no buildings to cast shadows, but these lifeforms were strangely within shadows.

They were few in numbers and separated from all the other lifeforms around them. Strangely, the dark creatures neither drew near to them nor initiated an attack. It was unknown if they couldn’t see these shadows or didn’t dare to attack them.

They were the Shadow race. In terms of appearance, they were quite similar to the human race, but they were skinnier, looking delicate and fragile. It was hard to imagine that such frail-looking lifeforms were the infamous Shadow Assassins.

The Shadow race was originally part of the Elf race, a branch of the Spirit race. Their history could be traced all the way back to the primal chaos era; they were an extremely ancient species.

The Shadow race was part of the Shadow Elf race, but in the immemorial era, the Shadow race was enticed by evil. As a result, a portion of the Shadow Elves were drawn into the darkness, leaving the Elf race and becoming a race of slaughter. The rest of the Shadow Elf race were almost annihilated by them.

Afterward, the entire Spirit race banded together to attack the Shadow race, dealing them a serious blow. However, the Shadow race was specialized in concealing themselves. Unable to win, they simply hid themselves, making it impossible for even the Spirit race to find them.

Over countless years, the Shadow Assassins took the position of overlord of the shadows. They had abandoned their identity as part of the Elf race, instead calling themselves the Shadow race.

The Shadow Elf race was originally very powerful and innately kind. Their powerful bloodline gave them immense killing power and healing abilities.

However, when the Shadow race left the Shadow Elf race, they abandoned their healing ability, focusing entirely on raising their killing power.

After all this time, the current Shadow race had essentially lost any healing abilities, but their killing power grew increasingly terrifying.

The Spirit race had tried to remove this scourge from the world countless times, but the Shadow race was just too skilled at concealing themselves. Thus, the Spirit race had no way of wiping them out.

It was in the most recent million years that the Shadow race truly returned to the nine heavens. However, by that point, they were no longer the old Shadow race. Their numbers had grown to the point that even the Spirit race didn’t dare to declare war on them lightly.

After all, the Spirit race’s branches were scattered throughout the world, and only a few major races within them could deal with the Shadow race alone. Furthermore, if they were to attack, the Shadow race would simply flee and unleash a bloody retribution.

They would then attack the weaker branches of the Spirit race, and then the Spirit race would be in a constant state of worry. Thus, the Spirit race also felt some fear toward the Shadow race.

Today, the Shadow race openly appeared on the martial stage. But even the Shadow Elf race, with all their hatred of the Shadow race, could not declare war on them.

The Shadow race had carved out their own territory here, ignoring all others. They were quite conspicuous, so people easily noticed them when Long Chen turned their way. They numbered only a few hundred thousand, but the pressure that they gave off was shocking.

Despite clearly being right there, there seemed to be shadows around them. They were in a state between illusory and reality, as if they might vanish at any moment.

When everyone’s gaze fell on them, one of them in particular drew their attention.

It was a woman who was slightly shorter than an average human woman, but quite a bit taller than the rest of the Shadow race’s experts. She quite literally stood out amongst them.

However, what drew everyone’s attention was not her larger statue, but the fluctuations coming from behind her. It was like a gate of darkness. If this gate was opened, this world would descend into endless darkness.

Black ripples could be seen in her eyes that looked like the eyes of a fiend. Just staring into them would make a person feel like their soul was being stolen.

She was now staring at Long Chen. However, she didn’t seem to mind about the deaths of dozens of Shadow Assassins. Furthermore, she didn’t even seem angry at Long Chen’s provocation. The next moment, her lips opened ever so slightly, and an icy voice rang out.

“A probing test is a must. After all, this princess does not kill nameless weaklings. My adversary must reach the necessary level before they can be called an adversary.”

This woman spoke, calling herself a princess. It was no wonder the rest of the Shadow race’s experts were following her.

“You truly must have some qualifications. I’ve already decided to take your head. Don’t disturb Big Brother Long Chen. You won’t just be wasting your own energy; you might even forfeit your life. Your opponent is me!” Before Long Chen could respond, an equally icy voice rang out. It was Dong Mingyu.

Dong Mingyu was standing with the Undying Willow race’s experts. But in front of the endless tide of dark creatures, she didn’t feel the slightest pressure. There was no need for her to even join in. After all, only a portion of the Undying race’s experts were required to stop the dark creatures.

Dong Mingyu stared at the Shadow race’s princess coldly, and a certain hostility ignited within her eyes. For some reason, when she noticed this woman, she felt some kind of energy inside of her body quietly awakening.

The Shadow race’s princess snorted. Just as she was about to reply, her pupils shrank, and she stared more intently at Dong Mingyu.

“You possess the Shadow Elves’ divine abilities?”

“What are you talking about?” Dong Mingyu was surprised and confused by this question. Shadow race? Shadow Elves? Were they related to Ye Wusheng, the Silence of the Night?

“I don’t need to say anything else. You just need to know that I will personally cut off your head,” the Shadow race's princess declared with a solemn expression. Her eyes blazed with frigid killing intent, looking at Dong Mingyu like she was the murderer of her father.

Dong Mingyu was still befuddled, but she felt that this matter was not so simple. Was her master related to the Shadow Elf race?

Well, at this moment, none of that mattered to her. Dong Mingyu didn’t care. In any case, this princess had entered her list of assassination targets.

Dong Mingyu and the Shadow race’s princess’s conversation startled everyone. After that, they suddenly thought of something. Was the Shadow Sect related to the Shadow Elves?

Some senior members had heard of Ye Wusheng. It was said that she was very slender and delicate. In particular, her legs were much longer than that of an average human. Wasn’t that characteristic more similar to that of the Spirit race?𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

BOOM!

Just as everyone was guessing the possible connection between Ye Wusheng and the Shadow Elves, an explosive sound shook the martial stage. The nine dragon barrier at the heart of the martial stage had ruptured.

Upon seeing this, countless people’s expressions changed. With that barrier gone, the karmic luck bead was exposed, causing everyone to go into a frenzy. As if they couldn’t see the endless flood of dark creatures, they charged toward the karmic luck bead.
