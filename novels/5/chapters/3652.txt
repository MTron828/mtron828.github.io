Chapter 3641 Twisted Story

“Boss!”

Guo Ran clenched his fists. “This is impossible! Xia Chen is definitely being framed!”

Guo Ran’s blazing killing intent caused that person to jump. He had felt Guo Ran to be weak and not a threat, which was precisely why he had targeted Guo Ran. He had even thought Guo Ran was some young master who had come out to enjoy the world.

Guo Ran’s killing intent erupted when he heard about the warrant for Xia Chen. He refused to believe that Xia Chen would do something like betraying his sect and master.

“Continue.” Long Chen’s expression was also gloomy. He understood Xia Chen’s character. He wasn’t such a person. There must be some secrets within this matter.

Through that person’s explanation, Long Chen learned that Xia Chen had only been a worker in the Spirit Rune Pavilion at the start. He had been waiting on the Talisman Apprentices.

Later on, he had an opportunity. An instructor discovered his immense talent and accepted him as a disciple. In just half a year, he passed the trials and became a Talisman Master. Based on his age, he was one of the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s ten youngest Talisman Masters in all of history.

It could be said that Xia Chen had shaken the entire Spirit Rune Pavilion at that time. If it weren’t for his unmistakably low Spiritual Strength, people would even suspect that he was a reincarnation of an old monster.

After becoming a Talisman Master, he worked hard on mastering the various talisman arts. With his immense talent, he mastered the various kinds of talismans and runes.

In just a year, he started the trial to be promoted to a Talisman Grandmaster.

That news shook the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. It had to be known that a Talisman Master in their twenties was already an existence that deserved to have their own page in the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field’s history.

Regretfully, at that time, Xia Chen failed the trial. While his soul energy’s purity did reach the level of a Talisman Grandmaster, it wasn’t strong enough. There were seven talismans that he had to make in the trial, and after making six, he severely overdrafted his soul energy, causing him to fail on the seventh.

Despite that, it caused quite a ruckus. That was because his first six talismans had all passed the mark.

It had to be known that the trial for becoming a Talisman Grandmaster was extremely stringent. The difficulty to make those six talismans was unimaginable. But Xia Chen had passed all of them. His talent was something countless people admire, but also envied.

To sum it up, at that time, Xia Chen’s name became known throughout the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. This talent made him a monster.

Some people guessed that he would pass the trial within three years and become a Talisman Grandmaster. Even if he took three years to pass, he would still be history’s youngest Talisman Grandmaster.

What he was lacking was not talent or comprehension, nor was it experience. It was simply his soul energy. His soul energy would only grow stronger over time as his cultivation base increased.

Although he hadn’t passed that trial, he was already viewed as a Talisman Grandmaster. There was no suspense about him joining their ranks. The only question was how long would he need to pass the trial. One year? Two years? Or three years?

As the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s brightest heavenly genius, he made all others appear dull and drab. None of them could compare to him.

Xia Chen even ended up in a marriage agreement with the granddaughter of the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s master. The pavilion master, Gongsun Xuan, supported the marriage. His granddaughter, Gongsun Ziyi, was also very talented. The two of them were viewed as a perfect couple, the envy of countless people.

For the Spirit Rune Pavilion to end up with two peak heavenly geniuses like Xia Chen and Gongsun Ziyi at the same time made countless people say that the Spirit Rune Pavilion would return to its former glory at their hands.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Furthermore, just over a month ago, a matter shook the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. The number of their Heavenly Talisman Masters had gone from five to six.

The sixth was precisely the master of the Spirit Rune Pavilion, Gongsun Xuan. A Heavenly Talisman Master was an existence that made countless people prostrate themselves in worship. The entire star-field was shaken by it at the time.

The pavilion master had become a Heavenly Talisman Master, and he had two people with limitless potential to carry on his inheritance. Just like that, the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s rise was definitely set in stone. Countless sects sent congratulatory gifts, wanting to form a good relationship with them.

However, the waves of Gongsun Xuan’s promotion had yet to even settle before a bomb exploded. Xia Chen actually snuck into the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s sacred land, opening the Heavenly Talisman Gate and taking the priceless treasure of the Spirit Rune Pavilion.

After being discovered, he grabbed his fiancée as a hostage. But due to how major the implications were, even Gongsun Ziyi’s capture didn’t dissuade others.

When Xia Chen was driven into a corner, he actually used a spiritual art to control the root of Gongsun Ziyi’s soul energy, placing a talisman there. It was an insidious talisman that would devour her Spirit Root, resulting in her never being able to cultivate again in this lifetime.

Everyone was shocked and enraged by Xia Chen’s actions, and due to this, they opened a path for Xia Chen to leave. Using Gongsun Ziyi as a shield, just as he was about to escape, Gongsun Xuan appeared, saving Gongsun Ziyi. But Xia Chen still fled.

Just as he fled, he was struck by Gongsun Xuan’s talisman. The void was shattered at that time, leaving a giant hole that had yet to heal even until now.

Everyone saw Xia Chen transform into a streak of light and escape. Most likely, he had managed to block Gongsun Xuan’s attack. However, that attack was Gongsun Xuan’s strongest Heaven Shaking Talisman. Let alone a little Divine Lord like Xia Chen, even a half-step Divine Venerate would lose half their life if struck by such a talisman.

Afterward, Xia Chen vanished. Some people estimated that he was already dead. After all, that was the Heaven Shaking Talisman, Gongsun Xuan’s strongest talisman and his strongest trump card. Countless experts had lost their lives to it. Thus, people thought that Xia Chen was definitely dead.

However, some people did not agree. The Heaven Shaking Talisman was a Yang talisman. At that time, people had seen Xia Chen being covered in tens of thousands of black talismans.

In the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field, there were countless talismans. However, in general, they could be classified as Yin talismans, Yang talismans, and Yin Yang talismans.

Yang talismans were made with white paper, Yin talismans were made with black paper, and Yin Yang talismans were made with colors other than black and white based on their character.

The Heaven Shaking Divine Talisman was a supreme Yang talisman. However, Xia Chen had summoned tens of thousands of Yin talismans and detonated them at the same time. With the Yin and Yang forces pulling on each other, he had most likely managed to block a portion of the attack, while also unleashing a portion of its power into the void. At most, he had only endured a third of its power himself.

Even though just a third of that talisman’s power should be enough to kill any World King, people refused to believe that Xia Chen didn’t have other trump cards. Thus, some people felt that he was very likely still alive.

Xia Chen had actually done such a disgraceful thing, trespassing on their holy land. That was practically as bad as killing his own master. Gongsun Xuan was enraged and made a warrant for him. No matter where he was, he had to be found. If he was living, they wanted to capture him. If he was dead, they wanted to see his corpse.

This matter didn’t just shake the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field, but it also caused outsiders to come. The reward that the Spirit Rune Pavilion was offering was just that alluring.

Thus, when Long Chen and Guo Ran asked about Xia Chen, this person’s first thought was that they also came for the reward.

When this person was done with his story, Long Chen nodded. He directly tossed out ten thousand immortal king crystals and turned to leave.

Just then, that person suddenly said, “It seems that the two of you are Xia Chen’s friends. Then I’ll add an additional piece of information. It is said that the Bloodkill Hall dispatched some terrifying experts because the Spirit Rune Pavilion requested their aid in hunting down Xia Chen. Be careful.”

Bloodkill Hall? Terrifying experts? Long Chen narrowed his eyes.
