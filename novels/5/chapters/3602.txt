Chapter 3591

The Heaven Howling Battle Armor’s runes flowed, and a rumbling sound rang out as if the Heavenly Daos were roaring. When Heavenly Dao energy poured into the armor, the entire battle armor seemed to merge with the Heavenly Daos.

Long Chen was secretly astonished. The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s inheritance was truly terrifying. Could a battle armor really replace cultivation?

The battle armor was merged with heaven and earth. That was just like a normal cultivator’s manifestation, no? They had the same result but through different processes.

It was no wonder that the Alldevil Star-Field’s cultivators didn’t care so much about cultivation. A single battle armor could completely make up for what they were lacking.

At this moment, the Heaven Howling Battle Armor’s runes circulated on top of it. Long Chen suddenly realized that this Heaven Howling Battle Armor had Wang Zixu’s manifestation carved into it. He was using the battle armor as a vector, turning his manifestation from illusory to solid.

“The creator of this armor was definitely an incomparable genius.”

Thinking of this, Long Chen couldn’t help prostrating himself in admiration toward the person who came up with this. The path of cultivation was truly endless. Countless geniuses constantly appeared, and any kind of cultivation when taken to the pinnacle could be a Major Dao.

Wang Zixu’s aura soared after summoning the Heaven Howling Battle Armor. The space around him constantly twisted. It was like a volcano was about to erupt with power that could destroy heaven and earth.

Seeing Wang Zixu’s unrivaled aura, those Assembly Elders smiled.

“Zixu is already capable of activating half of the Heaven Howling Battle Armor’s runes in the Divine Lord realm. Once he advances to become a World King, he will be able to control the second generation Heaven Howling Battle Armor and match a Divine Venerate devil beast. Then will a little Alldevil race be anything to be afraid of?” said one Assembly Elder proudly, twirling his beard.

This Assembly Elder was an expert from the Wang family. As Wang Zixu’s power was their Wang family’s power, in his opinion, the dean’s position would sooner or later be Wang Zixu’s.

“Hmph, our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College has Wang Zixu, Xie Liuer, and Leng Hui. There are three peerless heavenly geniuses, all in the late Divine Lord realm. They will quickly reach the Immortal King realm. With the support of their battle armors, they can sweep through all the devil beasts within the World King realm then. There’s no need for us to save the other powers. In a few years or decades, once all of them are ground down and weakened, our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College will be unrivaled. We will be the ones to right this chaos, saving the Alldevil Star-Field from its crisis. Then won’t the entire star-field belong to us? Some people are too soft-hearted and don’t have a vision that can see far enough,” snorted another Assembly Elder.

Naturally, one of the people he referred to was the dean, Xue Yifan. The assembly felt that there was no need to worry about other powers. After all, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College could defend against any dangers. The Alldevil race definitely wouldn’t dare to attack their college first.

While the other powers were ground down by the Alldevil race, their Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College would lie in wait. Once they were wounded, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College would dominate. In the end, they would be the saviors of this world. Wasn’t that the better decision?

As for the other powers, if they were grateful, then good. If they were resentful, who cared? History was written by the victors. At that time, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College would reign supreme. Others had to follow them or die opposing them. Who would dare to do anything to them?

However, the dean stood his ground regardless of the assembly’s opinion, forcing them to help the other powers. As a result, their Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was paying quite the price. The advantage of their natural stronghold was lost, and the Assembly Elders were very dissatisfied with that.

Seeing how powerful and shocking Wang Zixu’s potential was, they were even more sure that their plan was the wisest and most far-sighted one.

Those Elders then casually glanced at Xue Yifan. They found that he was acting like he hadn’t heard them and just quietly watched the martial stage.

On top of the martial stage, Guo Ran looked at Wang Zixu whose aura was like the sea. After that, he nodded.

“Not bad. You do have some smarts to summon your Heaven Howling Battle Armor first. Otherwise, you wouldn’t even have a chance to summon it.”

“Ignorant fool, hurry up and summon your Martial Heaven Battle Armor. Let me see if you’ve made any improvements in the garbage armor that you’ve modified countless times,” snorted Wang Zixu.

Guo Ran’s Martial Heaven Battle Armor was also very famous. That was because the Martial Heaven Battle Armor was completely unique. It was not one of the tens of millions of battle armors from the college’s blueprints. It was Guo Ran’s self-invented battle armor.

It had to be known that the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s battle armors were all created by the most talented seniors. The runes, usage, and specifications were all very strict. Nothing could be the slightest bit off, or it would affect the final quality of the armor.

As for Guo Ran, he stubbornly clung to his own path, creating a battle armor that belonged to him alone. In truth, his battle armor was first invented on the Martial Heaven Continent. Through constant improvements, it had become his current Martial Heaven Battle Armor. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When Guo Ran first arrived at the college, he said that he would create his own armor and countless people mocked him.

After all, the first sets of armor that Guo Ran made were truly a joke. They were blasted away by a single punch from others.

However, Guo Ran was not discouraged and he persevered with his own style. He had constant failures and constant improvements. But despite countless failures, his determination was never shaken.

Guo Ran’s willpower was the weakest except when it came to forging items. In that regard, he had astonishing perseverance. Furthermore, he was very confident in himself.

His Martial Heaven Battle Armor continuously grew stronger and more perfect. He rose step by step through people’s mockery and jeering.

Relying on this battle armor, he won the dean’s praise and became one of the four heroes of the college.

Furthermore, every little while, Guo Ran’s armor would improve as if there was no limit to it. Guo Ran’s potential was truly shocking. Hence, people very much wanted to know just how much Guo Ran had improved his Martial Heaven Battle Armor.

However, when people looked at Guo Ran, he simply shook his head. “Idiot, do you think that the Martial Heaven Battle Armor is all I have? You are wrong, very wrong. The Martial Heaven Battle Armor is just something I used to draw your attention. Do you know how hard I studied in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College? If I didn’t stand out, I wouldn’t gain any support. But if I stood out too dazzlingly, I’d be killed by some old fellows who don’t care about their faces. In the last few months, four late stage World King bastards have sneak attacked me, trying to kill me and probe my bottom line. You all thought that my Martial Heaven Battle Armor was my ultimate battle armor. Today, I will show you my strongest state.”

Guo Ran was clenching his teeth by the end. Endless fury erupted from within his heart. After that, he extended a hand.

The next moment, black scales appeared, slowly covering his body. Moreover, every scale possessed its own independent rune. When every rune linked up, a terrifying pressure crashed out of the armor. This wave of wild devil qi gave people chills.

“This is a battle armor made from devil dragon black crystals! Where… where did he get devil dragon black crystals?!” exclaimed an Assembly Elder.

A devil dragon black crystal was one of the apex divine materials of the Alldevil Star-Field. It could be refined into devil dragon tungsten steel and was so hard that it was almost unbreakable. Even a tiny bit was worth an enormous amount of money. In the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, there were only three battle armors on this level. They had been sealed for millions of years and had never been touched in all that time.

Furthermore, this black battle armor on Guo Ran’s body was clearly newly made. The runes were still not fully carved, which meant that this armor was only half complete.

Suddenly, a black saber appeared in Guo Ran’s hand. When Long Chen saw the form of that saber, his heart pounded wildly.
