Chapter 76 The Terrifying Marquis Ying

Translator: BornToBe

Marquis Ying coldly smiled both mockingly and disdainfully. His hand, which was now covered with bulging veins, brandished his sword, causing it to slice through space.

BOOM! Terrifying waves of qi surged out violently, causing the entire mountain valley to tremble.

Long Chen felt as if he had been smashed by a huge mountain. He was sent tumbling through the air, vomiting out blood.

He rolled dozens of meters and spat out another mouthful of blood. His insides felt as if they were on fire. Long Chen’s face was covered with shock and terror.

Marquis Ying’s words from before had not just been to frighten him. They had been the truth. When qi and physical power superimposed, the strength that could be unleashed was truly enough to cause a person to despair.

“Bastard!”

Wilde let out an angry roar. His ax smashed down right after Long Chen was sent flying. But Marquis Ying’s sword was as quick as lightning, quickly striking against Wilde’s battle-ax.

Wilde was sent flying back like a skipping stone, tumbling through the air several times before heavily landing on the ground.

But while Wilde was sent back flying further than Long Chen, he didn’t spit out any blood. That surprised Marquis Ying.

“Now you two should be convinced. In front of true strength, all your struggles are futile. Give up.” Marquis Ying didn’t chase after them to attack. He stood in his original position like an emperor, coldly looking down on them.

Supporting himself with the broadsword to struggle back up, Long Chen shook his head, blood staining his mouth. “Giving up midway isn’t my style. I still haven’t chopped off your head yet either.”

Marquis Ying coldly looked back at Long Chen. His anger suddenly turned into laughter. “Haha, you truly are Long Tianxiao’s son. I admire that toughness. I hope once I crush every single bone in your body you can still stay as tough. Kid, go repent in the underworld.”

After speaking, his body suddenly moved. Long Chen was shocked to realize that he was looking at an afterimage. Marquis Ying’s speed was inconceivable, and he arrived in front of Long Chen in an instant, slashing with his sword.

Seeing Marquis Ying’s attack, Long Chen once again didn’t bother with defending, instead also sending a slash out at Marquis Ying.

This method of giving up defense to take one’s enemy down as well wasn’t really a method. It was a technique that could only be used when all else was useless.

In terms of speed, Long Chen was unable to compare to Marquis Ying. And in terms of power, he was also not his match.

All he could rely on was the length of his broadsword. He could only use his courage and boldness to fight against him. Although such a technique was extremely dangerous, it would at least allow him to buy some time.

As expected, Marquis Ying was incapable of accepting such an exchange where he would also be heavily injured just to kill him. He recalled his sword to defend, looking for another opportunity to attack.

At this time, Wilde also charged over, hacking down with his ax. It seemed that the previous blow hadn’t harmed him at all. His physical body truly was so frighteningly sturdy.

Long Chen was gratified to see that Wilde seemed to suddenly become smart. He had learned from Long Chen to ignore Marquis Ying’s sword and attack with his life on the line.

Consecutive blows echoed throughout the valley. The very land trembled with each exchange.

With Long Chen and Wilde working together and gambling their lives, Marquis Ying was actually unable to display his abilities and was forcibly blocked by the two of them.

He had a definite superiority over them in terms of both power and speed. But Long Chen and Wilde’s attacks were absolutely insane, risking their lives over and over again. They didn’t care about any of his blows striking them, only using their bodies to receive his attacks. However, they risked their lives to strike fatal blows on him.

Marquis Ying’s face turned green from anger. There were several times when he felt an urge to continue his attack while disregarding their blows in order to kill them, but he still continued to patiently endure.

Firstly, Long Chen and Wilde’s strength were too great. If he were to take a direct hit from them, that could be a fatal blow. A slight miscalculation or accident and it wouldn’t be just exchanging blows but exchanging lives.

Secondly, he possessed the absolute advantage. Handling Long Chen and Wilde was just a matter of time. There was no need for him to take any reckless risks.

And it was precisely because Long Chen had seen through Marquis Ying’s thinking that he dared to do as he did. After all, this kind of exchange was an absolute last resort. If he didn’t risk his life fighting back, he would just die immediately.

Weapons clashed and flew. An hour passed in just the blink of an eye. Long Chen was alarmed to realize that his physical strength was starting to fade. The broadsword in his hands began to feel heavier and heavier.

And Wilde wasn’t much better off. His ax was no longer as quick and violent as before. He had obviously also reached his limit.

Seeing an icy smile appeared on Marquis Ying’s face, Long Chen’s heart grew cold. Marquis Ying was doing this to capture them alive. He would continue to completely exhaust them so that he could torture them as much as he liked later.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. If you want my life, then we’ll have to see if you have the qualifications or not!

Marquis Ying smiled inside when he saw that Long Chen and Wilde’s power were weakening and their attacks becoming slower.

Suddenly, Long Chen swung his broadsword too hard. Due to a lack of energy, he stumbled forward a step along with the sword. That one step immediately revealed a huge opening.

Almost by reflex, Marquis Ying didn’t even think. Dodging Wilde’s ax, his sword directly slashed towards Long Chen’s waist. Obviously, Long Chen’s guess was right; Marquis Ying was planning on keeping them barely alive. Otherwise, that sword would be going straight for his heart.

A cold glimmer shined in Long Chen’s eyes. Suddenly, his FengFu Star was activated to its full power. All his power flowed straight into his Dantian.

The twelve cyclones that were already three hundred meters wide immediately grew to ten times the size. They quickly revolved, and the spiritual qi within fifty kilometers was immediately sucked dry.

“Whether I can succeed or not, I have to try!”

Long Chen prayed inside. His twelve cyclones all revolved, causing all that spiritual qi to condense into a cord that flowed through the LiYao point, merged into the HuiMing Point, and at the end rushed through the QuChi point to enter the LaoGong point.

When his spiritual qi flowed into the first point, that acupuncture point acted like a flood gate that was forced open. After his spiritual qi went through that gate, it somehow began to flow faster, rushing into the next point with an even greater force.

Once the spiritual qi had finished through all the layers of superposition and entered the final LaoGong point in his hand, Long Chen suddenly felt intense pain coming from that acupuncture point.

“Crap, my meridians can’t handle this.”

As soon as he felt that pain around his LaoGong point, he realized the surrounding meridians were also starting to shudder, unable to handle the rushing of the spiritual qi.

“HOLD FOR ME!” Long Chen angrily roared. He could no longer care too much about that. He controlled it so only a strand of that energy flowed out of the LaoGong point.

Without even thinking about it, he injected that strand of energy into his broadsword. The broadsword immediately began to shake and rumble.

Just as Marquis Ying’s sword was about to pierce into Long Chen’s waist, he suddenly felt his heart jump and all his hair stood on end. Relying on his many years of battle experience, he instinctively gave up on his attack and hastily retreated.

But even as he began to retreat, the broadsword in Long Chen’s hand was already raised. The seven-foot-long broadsword emitted a strange light and seemed to possess an aura of endless death as it descended upon Marquis Ying.

“Split the Heavens!”

Marquis Ying was completely terrified as he looked up at that sword. That sword had somehow managed to lock him in place.

A small Qi Condensation beginner was actually able to use his qi to lock a Tendon Transformation expert two realms above him in place. That was absolutely crazy!

Normally, such a lock could only occur when the stronger expert attacked the weaker one. If two opponents were on the same level, it was extremely difficult for one to lock the other in place. For an insignificant Qi Condensation newbie to lock down a Tendon Transformation expert was a joke!

However, such a thing actually now happened to Marquis Ying. But Marquis Ying quickly recovered from his shock, sensing the scent of death drawing near him.

The sword in Long Chen’s hand held a strange shine. It was just like a divinity’s blade, mercilessly slashing down.

“Wave Breaking Slash!” Seeing that sword slash down, Marquis Ying shouted. Now was not the time to be shocked by Long Chen’s lock. All the green veins on his body sharply grew until it was like vines which were wriggling right under his skin. His aura once more grew to a new level as he also slashed out.

Qi waves surged out dozens of meters. This Wave Breaking Slash was one of Marquis Ying’s ultimate techniques, and it was an Earth class Battle Skill.

BOOM!

The moment Long Chen’s broadsword met Marquis Ying’s sword, heaven and earth both turned still for a moment. Only then did an enormous explosion ring out.

Three figures were sent flying at the same time. The terrifying energy completely destroyed their original battlefield. A huge crater almost thirty meters wide appeared where they had collided.

Long Chen felt as if his entire body were about to fall apart from exhaustion. His right hand was hurting in particular. According to common sense, with his current meridian widths, he was still unable to display Split the Heavens.

But despite that, he had forcibly used it just now. This had completely broken down his meridians surrounding the LaoGong point. But he had also finally learned just how terrifying Split the Heavens was.

He had actually been lucky at that final moment, as he had only used a strand of Split the Heaven’s energy. He hadn’t dared to use the rest of that energy.

If he had used the full force of that Battle Skill, perhaps all his meridians would have completely been blown apart and he would truly become a cripple. But despite using just a strand of that energy, his hand’s meridians were completely ravaged.

Other than a lingering fear, Long Chen also felt a burst of excitement. It was already so powerful despite that he had only used just a strand of its power. Just what class of Battle Skill had Split the Heavens reached?

“You really are worthy of being Long Tianxiao’s son. Good, very good, hahahaha!”

A burst of laughter rang out. The dust slowly scattered and Marquis Ying appeared from within.

But the current Marquis Ying appeared extremely miserable. His clean and tidy clothes had become unbearably tattered. There was a large wound in the middle of his stomach from which blood slowly flowed out.

Of the sword in his hand, only the hilt remained now. That exchange just now had completely destroyed the blade.

Long Chen’s pupils shrunk. Although Marquis Ying was extremely destitute now, his aura hadn’t dropped much at all. That meant Marquis Ying combat ability hadn’t dropped either.

Using one hand, he tore off his tattered clothes, revealing his wound and also a soft armor.

That armor was golden in color. It appeared extremely flexible and strong, however, a large hole had been split open on it due to Long Chen’s broadsword.

“What a powerful Battle Skill. If I hadn’t had this golden silk armor, I really would have died.” Looking down at his wound, Marquis Ying icily said, “I’ll give you a chance. If you hand over that Battle Skill, I’ll give you two a quick death.”

Long Chen switched the broadsword into his left hand. His right hand was already half-crippled and was unable to hold it anymore. He forced himself up and coldly laughed, “And what if I say no?”

“Long Chen, you better think this through. Death isn’t scary. Living a life worse than death is the most painful. And I just happen to have some skill in that area. I’d advise you not to regret anything,” said Marquis Ying icily.

“I, Long Chen, have never done anything I’ve regretted.” Long Chen glanced at him and then stealthily cast a meaningful glance at Wilde.

Long Chen didn’t dare be too obvious. After glancing at Wilde, Long Chen slowly raised his sword and sneered, “Ying Zhao, that move just now was just a testing blow. Now that I’ve tested it… I’ll take your dogsheet life!”

After saying that, he stabbed the sword into the ground. At the same time, waves of qi exploded out and raised up all the dust into the air. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hmph, just let me see how capable you are,” Marquis Ying grimly laughed. Rubbing his ring, another sword appeared in his hand, and he raised it in front of him.

But when the dust settled, the guarded Marquis Ying realized that Long Chen had already disappeared, only leaving behind the foolish Wilde standing there.

Marquis Ying’s expression changed. He hastily looked up to see that Long Chen had already fled several hundred meters into the mountains.
