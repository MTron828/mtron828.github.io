Chapter 1111 Acting Tyrannical

Translator: BornToBe

“Fuck, if you want to fight, then let’s fight!”

Seeing the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples take on fighting postures, Long Chen also began to circulate his spiritual yuan. His 108,000 original runes activated.

“Long Chen, don’t be rude! How can you attack someone here? You are hereby punished to face the wall for two hours.” A cold shout from the Xuan Master suddenly rang out.

“Hey, wait a sec-” Long Chen was startled. Wasn’t the Xuan Master the one who had asked him to do this?

Long Chen vanished. Spatial energy surrounded him, and he suddenly appeared in the Xuan Master’s room.

“Well done.” The Xuan Master patted his shoulder with praise. Clearly, handing this kind of matter to Long Chen was the wisest choice.

“Xuan Master, is the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect our enemy?” asked Long Chen.

“They don’t count as enemies, but they don’t count as friends either. Originally, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, the Xuantian Dao Sect, and the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect were established around the same time, and the founders were once best friends. The three sects were around the same in power at that time, but if you had to say who was weaker or stronger, then the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect was the strongest, the Xuantian Dao Sect was second, and the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect was last.

“But later, an unforeseen event occurred. All sects beneath the heavens took heavy losses. The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s last three forms of Split the Heavens were lost, while the Xuantian Dao Sect was the same. Although the Xuantian Catalog is still complete, the extremely important original interpretation was destroyed. That interpretation was personally made by the founder. It recorded the essence of all the Daos in the Xuantian Catalog, but it was ruined in the battle back then.

“Now, what the ordinary disciples are given to comprehend is just a small portion of the original interpretation, while the rest was patched up and fixed later. But the total amount of information within is less than a hundredth of the original Xuantian Catalog.”

The Xuan Master sighed for a long time before continuing, “However, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect was very smart. In that battle, although they also took huge losses, they managed to keep their inheritance intact.”

Long Chen interjected, “By smart, you mean they were cowards and didn’t bring out their full power? Others put everything on the line, but they were secretly holding back?”

The Xuan Master smiled slightly. “As expected, there’s no need to beat around the bush with you. You’re not off by much. As for that battle, don’t ask, as you cannot know about it. But as a result of that battle, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect became the strongest of the three sects, and they’re becoming more and more arrogant.

“They don’t dare to be cocky in front of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect because their disciples are all battle madmen due to their cultivation technique. They’ll explode with just the slightest instigation, which is pretty similar to you. Perhaps your temper is related to Split the Heavens.

“That’s why the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect has set its target on my Xuantian Dao Sect. They want to suppress us, perhaps to give themselves a sense of achievement. The previous generation Xuan Master, my master, always accommodated them, causing them to make a habit of doing this. That’s why this time, I want to give them a slap in the face. But I need your help. Are you interested?”

“All you have to do is give me the word.” Long Chen patted his chest confidently. It was rare to run into someone who truly supported him like this. He naturally had to repay him.

“Good, then rest here for two hours. I’ll go see what Ma Xingkong is plotting.” After saying this, the Xuan Master vanished from Long Chen’s sight.

Long Chen sat on his butt in front of the tea table. He didn’t stand on courtesy, directly pouring himself a cup. Seeing some refreshments, he randomly ate a few. Suddenly, the wall in front of him lit up, revealing a scene. The Xuan Master was currently looking at the middle-aged man in the palace.

The Xuan Master smiled and said, “I’m so sorry, I was in seclusion and had to clean up before going out. Please forgive me. Sit!”

The Magic Master was another name for the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s leader. But in truth, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had two Magic Masters, and this one was just the vice sect leader.

As for the Xuan Master, he was the true leader of the Xuantian Dao Sect. According to reason, there was a certain difference in status between them, but it seemed Ma Xingkong didn’t feel that way.

“The Xuan Master is as refined and courteous as ever. But it seems your disciples are barely passable. I won’t talk about how rude and vile they are,” said Ma Xingkong as he sat.

“It’s normal for children to be ignorant. After all, they’re still so young. If he didn’t advance at all after living a few centuries, I’d slap him to death myself. After living to such an age, if he still didn’t understand manners, wouldn’t all his years have been wasted on a dog life? What do you think, Ma Xingkong?” The Xuan Master smiled.

Ma Xingkong’s expression twitched. The Xuan Master was clearly cursing him for having lived for nothing. What was the point of quibbling with a child?

But the Xuan Master hadn’t said it directly, so Ma Xingkong could only act like he hadn’t understood his meaning. He changed the subject by saying, “Brother Li, these are the disciples of my Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s new generation. What do you think about them?”

“These precious guests are truly amazing. There’s actually four rank six Celestials and even an innate rank seven Celestial! How amazing to be able to control two elements, earth and metal, at the same time,” said the Xuan Master as his gaze swept over these disciples. His gaze lingered over one of them who was wearing a conical hat blocking his face.

He had no choice but to sigh. Ma Xingkong had brought fifty disciples, and they were all at least rank five Celestials.

Although only half of them were innate rank five Celestials, that was shocking enough. Compared to the Xuantian Dao Sect, the difference was immense.

Of the four rank six Celestials, only one of them was innate. But even if it was just an acquired rank six Celestial, no one had reached that level in the Xuantian Dao Sect’s new generation.

For a rank five Celestial to advance to become a rank six Celestial didn’t just require the Xuantian Tower’s Heavenly Dao blessing. It also required enough comprehension of the Heavenly Daos for there to be even a chance.

None of the new disciples had reached that requirement yet. If they forced it, the blessing would very likely fail, and a failure would be a heavy blow to any disciple. So the Xuantian Dao Sect didn’t try it.

The most shocking thing was the rank seven Celestial. His metal and earth energy were condensed to a monstrous point. He was definitely an extremely terrifying genius.

Despite knowing that Ma Xingkong was just trying to intentionally dazzle him, he had to admit that Ma Xingkong had succeeded. The Xuan Master was truly shocked.

Although the Xuan Master was sure this group was the fifty strongest members of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, when compared to the top fifty people of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s new generation, the difference was too great.

“I wonder, how are the disciples you recruited this time? Just now, I didn’t see any remarkable disciples,” said Ma Xingkong curiously.

This was a sinister question that he thought the Xuan Master would have no reply for. But the Xuan Master smiled. “Actually, you ran into the most remarkable disciple in my Xuantian Dao Sect’s new generation on your way here.”

“Oh? I don’t recall seeing any presentable people.” Ma Xingkong frowned.

“I’m sure you have quite the impression of him. It’s that coarse and violent fellow who blocked you on the way in,” said the Xuan Master.

“Him? Are you joking?” Ma Xingkong grew displeased, thinking the Xuan Master was just playing around.

“His name is Long Chen. You can have your disciples go into the Dao Sect and ask around. Everyone knows his great name,” said the Xuan Master with a self-mocking smile. Perhaps there would be people in the Xuantian Dao Sect who didn’t know him, but there was no one who didn’t know Long Chen.

This was definitely a record in the Xuantian Dao Sect for the most famous disciple. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hmph, if he’s the top disciple of your Xuantian Dao Sect, I can exterminate all of them with a wave of my hand. Looks like I came for nothing,” snorted a rank six Celestial.

“Shut up! How can you be so rude? Is this somewhere you can interject?” chided Ma Xingkong. To the Xuan Master, he said, “Apologies, I didn’t discipline my disciples enough. Please don’t take offense.”

Although what came out of his mouth was chiding, it wasn’t the slightest bit sincere. He was clearly trying to embarrass the Xuan Master.

“That’s fine. I wouldn’t bother quibbling with a child, or it would be a loss of my status,” said the Xuan Master with a magnanimous smile.

Ma Xingkong also smiled, but he was infuriated inside. This was clearly referring to how he had been infuriated by Long Chen and roared furiously.

But he also couldn’t display his fury, or it would be even more embarrassing. And worst of all, it would be in front of his own disciples.

Ma Xingkong chatted for a while with the Xuan Master before saying, “Originally, I brought my disciples to the Xuantian Dao Sect so they could exchange some pointers with the Dao Sect’s disciples, raising both sides powers and allowing our disciples to gain experience. But now that I see the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples...”

Ma Xingkong suddenly paused and shook his head, sighing. His meaning was clear. The Xuantian Dao Sect was too weak.

The Xuan Master indifferently said, “True, this new generation of disciples in my Dao Sect is far weaker than your Magic Sect’s.”

Ma Xingkong had put out his bait, but the Xuan Master didn’t take it, leaving him dumbfounded. The Xuantian Dao Sect was actually this cowardly? If this continued, then they really would have come for nothing.

“Although there’s a definite power difference, having an exchange and comparing notes is necessary. After all, it’s beneficial to the disciples from both sides.” Ma Xingkong switched tones upon seeing the Xuan Master refusal.

“I don’t feel like there’s any need for that. After all, when the difference between two sides is too great, such an exchange has no meaning.” The Xuan Master shook his head.

One of the disciples sneered and was just about to open his mouth when Ma Xingkong glared at him. The Xuan Master smiled inside. Was it interesting using this same pattern every time? Could they not switch their methods? The Xuan Master simply put on a calm, indifferent appearance, letting them continue with their play.

“Xuan Master, you’re too modest. In truth, there are quite a few outstanding people amongst the Dao Sect’s disciples,” said Ma Xingkong.
