Chapter 2603 Emissary of the Divine Families

In the High Priest’s home, Long Chen saw a person seated with the High Priest, and he was extremely surprised to see that person.

“Pill Doyen.”

Long Chen hadn’t expected that the old fellow that Tu Qianshang had mentioned was actually the divine families’ Pill Doyen.

The Pill Doyen smiled. “Are you surprised?”

Long Chen nodded. “It truly is surprising.”

“Come, sit.” The High Priest waved at Long Chen to come over.

Long Chen then bowed slightly and sat. The High Priest and the Pill Doyen represented the Martial Heaven Continent and the divine families, so Long Chen felt a bit uncomfortable.

“No need to feel restrained. I came over this time with my own mission. But whether or not it is successful has nothing to do with me. I merely need to pass on a few words,” said the Pill Doyen.

Long Chen nodded. “Pill Doyen, I feel great respect for you. But when it comes to the divine families, I really feel bad talking bad about them in front of you two seniors.”

“Hahaha…!”

The High Priest and the Pill Doyen laughed together. This character of Long Chen’s was truly direct. Although he hadn’t cursed the divine families, it was no different from if he had cursed them.

Not at all angry, the Pill Doyen said, “Do you know? Because of you, the divine families almost went to war. The Long family almost started fighting the Ye and Zhao families. Not even the Jiang family and Lord Venerate were able to mediate things. In the end, they ended up waking up the Lord Saint who has been in seclusion for countless years.”

“Oh? There was such a thing?” Long Chen was interested.

The Pill Doyen explained things from the start. The very day that the divine families retreated, the Ye and Zhao families began to gather their forces.

Although the Lord Venerate said that things were to end there, the two families were unwilling to accept it. They said that they would rather be punished than let Long Chen off.

However, it was understandable. The Zhao family’s Sovereign sprout, Zhao Ritian, had been killed, and the Ye family’s divine item had been smashed apart. Both families had suffered unprecedented humiliation at the hands of Long Chen

The Ye and Zhao families had even struck the great bell of the divine families and cast a vote on how to handle Long Chen. If the vote passed, the divine families would have to mobilize their full power to slay Long Chen. Based on the divine families’ laws, not even the Lord Venerate would be able to stop such a thing.

The Long family went all-out resisting this, but the Ye and Zhao families fought just as hard to push it forward. As for the Jiang family, around half of them were supporting the vote.

After all, Long Chen had disgraced the divine families in front of the people of the divine families and the Martial Heaven Continent. For them, killing Zhao Ritian was not just an insult but also a public provocation of war against the divine families.

At that moment, everyone from the divine families had been forced to return to their world when the great bell was struck. It was a summon that included the armies guarding the Yin Yang World and Devil Spirit Mountain. Hence, all the squads stationed at various locations had to return to the divine families.

After that, all the warriors entered combat-ready state. The four families’ core forces were all ready to fight.

There were a total of five hundred and seventeen people between the four families who were qualified to vote. The final result was that seventy percent supported the vote, and thirty percent were against it. The entire Long family had voted no, while everyone from the Zhao and Ye families had voted yes.

As for the Jiang family, they were originally supporting it, but when Feng Fei voted no, it startled quite a few of their voters. They looked between Feng Fei and Jiang Wuchen.

Feng Fei had declared that although she detested Long Chen, the truth was the truth. Long Chen might have been wrong, but Zhao Ritian had also been wrong.

On the martial path, life and death were up to fate, and the weak would be washed away by the strong. To put it simply, a person had to be willing to gamble with their life. If someone wanted to kill, they had to be prepared to be killed as well. For Feng Fei, complaining about the results of such a battle was a disgrace to the divine families’ dignity.

After saying that, Feng Fei left, but her words caused quite a few people from the Jiang family to change their minds and also vote no.

However, the final result was still a seventy percent approval, so it didn’t matter. According to the divine families’ laws, the Lord Venerate would have to lead the divine families’ forces to slaughter Long Chen, even if the divine families had to declare war against the Martial Heaven Continent.

At that moment, a voice rang out. “All things have to have the big picture taken into consideration.”

The arrival of that voice caused the Ye and Zhao families’ expressions to change. This matter had actually woken the Lord Saint, and he immediately invalidated the result of their vote.

Although he had not said that he was directly against it, his meaning was clear. With the current state of the Martial Heaven Continent, with invaders on the verge of attacking, the big picture was what mattered. Hence, with just a word, the Ye and Zhao families’ people were suppressed. They didn’t dare to go against the Lord Saint’s order.

On the other hand, the Long family’s people were filled with smiles. In this battle, the Long family had come out ahead.

However, things were now in an awkward position. Due to the striking of the great bell, the divine families’ disciples had all been called back. The problem was whether or not they were supposed to send back their warriors. Some places were easy to do so, but it would be awkward with the Yin Yang World and Devil Spirit Mountain.

The divine families’ warriors had silently left, so the Martial Heaven Continent viewed this as a betrayal. Could the divine families’ army really go back? They would have to discuss this first.

If they wanted to fight off the experts of the other worlds, the divine families alone could not do it, nor could the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. They had to work together.

However, splitting apart was easy, but coming back together was hard. Considering that they had been defending such a core area and had left without a word, who would trust them again?

The divine families were caught in an awkward position. As a matter of fact, the Lord Venerate had furiously declared that whoever had caused this disaster should fix it themselves.

He was naturally infuriated. He had declared that this matter was over, but the Zhao and Ye families refused to let things go. Hence, he no longer cared.

However, how could the Zhao and Ye families actually lower their face to apologize to the Martial Heaven Continent? It was impossible.

They hadn’t made any moves. Clearly, both families were furious and embarrassed.

The Zhao family’s Sovereign sprout had been killed, and the Ye family’s precious divine item had been broken, but they didn’t win anything back. And now they needed to apologize to others? Even if they were tortured, they wouldn’t do it. As a result, this matter continued all the way until now. In the end, even the Lord Venerate hadn’t been able to keep watching. He couldn’t force them too far. After all, they were also victims.

Without any other choice, the Lord Venerate had thickened his face and gone to request aid from the Pill Doyen, asking him to come here. And so, he was here.

“Let me first state my position clearly. I’m only in charge of passing on words. Whatever feelings you have, whatever complaints you have, don’t vent them on me. I’m innocent.” The Pill Doyen raised his hand and laughed.

It was only after hearing all this that Long Chen understood just what had gone on with the divine families. But just who was the Lord Saint? Was he really such a terrifying expert? The divine families’ rankings were a bit unclear.

However, since the Pill Doyen had said all this, Long Chen felt a bit bad. He couldn’t blame the Pill Doyen. But whenever the divine families were mentioned, he was truly pissed off.

“Pill Doyen, I don’t feel the slightest negativity when it comes to you,” said Long Chen awkwardly. The Pill Doyen had truly given him a good feeling. He was an elder worthy of respect. Without the Heavenly Flame Orb, Huo Linger wouldn’t have transformed. Hence, Long Chen believed that the Pill Doyen was completely different from the rest of the divine families.

“Pill Doyen, are you here to say that the divine families wish to join forces with the Martial Heaven Continent against the invaders?”

“No. I’m only in charge of passing on words. The details will have to be discussed by you guys,” said the Pill Doyen.

“Discussed by us? As in me and the divine families? No. Although my guts aren’t small, I’m not going to run to the divine families and get myself killed,” said Long Chen.

Seventy percent of the people with authority in the divine families wanted to kill him, so going there was suicide. He wasn’t so foolish.

The High Priest said, “That is why the divine families sent over the Pill Doyen.”

“You mean that with the Pill Doyen present, the divine families won’t dare to touch me?” asked Long Chen.

“As long as you don’t randomly kill people, it will be no problem,” promised the Pill Doyen.

Now Long Chen understood. The divine families were seeking a way out of their awkward position, and it was to look for the Pill Doyen who had a certain relationship with the High Priest. Perhaps he was the only one in the divine families that the High Priest trusted.

Due to this, the High Priest believed that with the Pill Doyen, Long Chen could return to the divine families safely.

Theoretically, both sides would be discussing matters equally, and so they should choose a neutral place to discuss things. But by making Long Chen go to the divine families, it made it appear as if he was the weaker party asking for help, giving the divine families face. This was what the divine families wanted.

The divine families wanted a way out without losing face, and by going to the divine families, Long Chen would allow outsiders to view this as giving the divine families’ face.

After all, Long Chen had killed Zhao Ritian in front of everyone, and the divine families could not accept this humiliation. By going to the divine families himself, he could resolve this conflict.

Long Chen actually didn’t want to go. However, it seemed that even the High Priest supported this. Was that to say that the High Priest also wished to cooperate with the divine families?

The High Priest looked at Long Chen, but he only laughed. “You are the one in charge of the Martial Heaven Continent. Everything is up to you. No matter what decision you make, these old bones of mine will support you.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Pill Doyen suddenly stood. “I’ll go take a look at the High Priest’s peach blossom forest. That’s the only place I haven’t gone to in the Wine God Palace. You two can chat.”

The Pill Doyen left, leaving only Long Chen and the High Priest talking.

“High Priest, to tell the truth, I really detest the divine families. I don’t really want to work with them. They aren’t reliable,” said Long Chen.

“But deep in your soul, you feel something drawing you to them. Isn’t that very contradictory?” said the High Priest profoundly.

“You…”

“You have to face what you have to face. Are you getting afraid now that you’re on the verge of unraveling this mystery?” said the High Priest.

“High Priest… how did you know?” asked Long Chen, stunned.
