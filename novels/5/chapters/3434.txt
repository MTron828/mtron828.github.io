Chapter 3423 Trusted by the Core of the Star-Field

“I am the core of this star-field. You shouldn’t feel unfamiliar. I can sense the mark of another star-field’s core on you,” replied that gentle voice. The voice was like a spring breeze flowing through him, like the call of the dome of the heavens, like the murmuring of the plains, mountains, and rivers. This voice could make a person forget all their vexations.

“The core of the star-field?”

Long Chen’s heart pounded and he instantly thought of the Martial Heaven Continent. Its mother core had entrusted the fate of the entire world to him.

However, that was the greatest shame of his life. He had failed to live up to her trust, unable to protect the Martial Heaven Continent or the Martial Heaven Continent’s people. If it hadn’t been for the dragon expert interfering, he and everyone else would have died.

Suddenly, Long Chen noticed that everything around him was frozen in place. Time had stopped. Lei Yuner still had her infuriated expression, and the people inside the barrier were still sneering at them as if they had won. Even the flowing runes on top of the barrier were frozen.

Long Chen looked at the divine light flowing out from within. Like strips of cloth, they condensed into the form of a green-robed woman.

She had a pretty face. Although she wouldn’t be called a supreme beauty, she gave off a very naturally familiar feeling, as if she was family. Anyone would instantly trust her without reservation.

Time and space were frozen. Only Long Chen and this woman could move. The woman then walked up to Long Chen. “Can I ask something of you?”

“Go ahead,” said Long Chen directly.

Long Chen instantly thought of the Martial Heaven Continent when he saw her. She possessed the same kind of aura that was willing to sacrifice everything for others. Long Chen could fully trust her.

He had failed to live up to the Martial Heaven Continent’s trust. So, Long Chen had a feeling like he was willing to walk through fire and water for this woman’s request, as if he would be willing to die ten thousand times just to accomplish what she asked of him.

“I want you to destroy this Divine Lord Immortal Realm. Don’t let it continue harming people.”

“Harming people?”

The woman nodded. “Yes. This place was made artificially to excessively extract the spiritual qi of the entire star-field. It is overdrafting the potential of the star-field. In the future, there will not be enough spiritual qi to replenish the spiritual qi they are extracting. It won’t even take a few thousand years for this place to become a wasteland. Lately, they have gone even farther, extracting the energy of my core in order to brand themselves with my mark. They think that this mark can allow them to obtain the support of the Heavenly Daos. However, forcibly extracting my energy will rapidly age the star-field and also infect them with karma. Although they’ll get some benefits, they will harm all their descendants and all the inhabitants of this star-field. Moreover, those who forcibly obtain the mark of the Heavenly Daos from me will be rejected by other star-fields. Within the cycle of karma, their entire races might be destroyed.”

Only now did Long Chen learn that undergoing tribulation in the core of this star-field was like drinking poison to quench thirst.

The woman continued, “As the protector spirit of the Integral Heaven Star-Field, I love everyone in this land. I don’t want them to destroy themselves. I hope you can help me destroy the core of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. Don’t let them walk further on this path and destroy themselves.”

She looked at Long Chen pleadingly. Long Chen had seen the same desire in the spirit of the Martial Heaven Continent. He couldn’t help but demand, “Why are you going to treat them so well when they harm you like this?!”

“This is my nature. I cannot hate them no matter what they do to me. I simply hope that they can live in peace.” The woman shook her head and sighed.

“Can you tell me what’s going on here? What was it like before? How long has it been since the Divine Lord Immortal realm was built?” asked Long Chen. Long Chen instantly rattled off many of his questions because he felt that this place was built to be a trap.

After that, she explained that the Integral Heaven Star-Field used to belong to the human race. Later on, devils attacked, slaughtering the human race. But curiously, they directly left after killing the humans.

Thereafter, the Sacred Pill Hall came and announced that this place was reclaimed by Lord Brahma. They even set up a divine stele as proof of his contributions.

As the Integral Heaven Star-Field had become a peaceful place, quite a few humans returned. But many of those humans had their own faiths and were unwilling to worship Lord Brahma.

Afterward, the Bloodkill Hall appeared and secretly assassinated the people unwilling to worship Lord Brahma, using this method to unify this region.

However, after another few thousand years, they found that this was no solution. The human race had many faiths. Moreover, a large batch of demonic beast races had come and found a new home here.

Seeing this, the Sacred Pill Hall switched methods. As the overlord of the Integral Heaven Star-Field, they only sold medicinal pills to the demonic beast race and encouraged them to mate with the human race, resulting in the current state of the star-field.

As for the Divine Lord Immortal realm, it was created specially for the demonic beast race. The stronger someone’s physical body, the greater the benefits of undergoing tribulation here.

This was how this human territory had become the territory of demonic beasts. Everything was done secretly by the Sacred Pill Hall. But as for their goal, even the protector spirit was unaware of it.

“I just knew these bastards were cooking up a scheme,” cursed Long Chen hatefully. The Sacred Pill Hall was overdrafting the energy of this entire world just to draw others over and promote mating between the human and the demonic beast race. This was definitely a scheme.

It was very possible that they were using this method to spread an epidemic. After all, the humans and demonic beasts didn’t know the truth and thought of the Sacred Pill Hall as an existence with overwhelming capabilities. They thought that the latter could help them produce many great experts.

On the surface, the Sacred Pill Hall didn’t ask for anything. They simply acted like good people who didn’t expect anything in return, tricking experts from other domains by welcoming them. The experts might even be welcomed with wide-open arms so that they could create more worlds like the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If that happened, then the immortal world was truly doomed. Furthermore, the protector spirit had said that after the devils attacked the Integral Heaven Star-Field, they immediately retreated and the Sacred Pill Hall directly took over. Not even a ghost would believe that they hadn’t discussed it beforehand.

The protector spirit saw everything clearly, but she had no method to stop things. That was why she asked Long Chen for help. Long Chen also had the mark of the Martial Heaven Continent’s spirit, so she trusted him over others.

Although Long Chen wasn’t sure what Lord Brahma’s ultimate goal was, he knew that it definitely wasn’t anything good.

“Alright, I will help you. But I’ll also need your help with one thing,” said Long Chen.
