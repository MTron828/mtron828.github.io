Chapter 2819 Don’t Provoke Me

Just as everyone thought that things were over, Zhong Changsheng was slapped in the face by Long Chen due to him staring too much.

After ascending to the immortal world, all of Long Chen’s abilities were suppressed, and only his divine face-slapping art was still as precise and refined as ever. He had a one hundred percent hit rate here in the immortal world.

Zhong Changsheng was caught off-guard and was thrown to the ground by the slap. Stars spun in his vision.

The people beside him were shocked. Long Chen was truly arrogant. Not even looking at him was alright for him. They then took out their weapons. But even once their weapons were out, they didn’t dare to attack. That was because Long Chen’s sword was already pointed at Zhong Changsheng’s head.

They didn’t even see Long Chen’s movements clearly as it was too fast. His sword was already pointed at Zhong Changsheng before any of them could do anything.

“What do you want?!” Zhong Changsheng was startled and enraged. He had never expected to provoke such a vicious character this time.

He had thought that he was picking up a cat, only for that cat to become a mighty tiger in an instant, and it was definitely a murderous tiger.

“I don’t want anything. I’m just warning you not to provoke me. In the lower world, I killed countless people. My path was covered in mountains of corpses and seas of blood. I didn’t ascend to the immortal world to waste time with idiots like you. My time is very precious. By wasting my time, you are harming me. Anyone who harms me is my enemy, and my enemies don’t have good endings, let alone long lives.” Long Chen patted Zhong Changsheng with the flat side of his sword. “I hope that you’ll remember the words I’m saying today. If you do, it might save your life.”

After saying that, Long Chen put away his sword. Zhong Changsheng then finally stood up, and he glared at Long Chen, sharp light in his eyes. His divine energy fluctuations slowly rose.

The current Long Chen was standing right in front of him, and his sword was already pulled back. He was no threat. Now was the best time to attack him.

As for Long Chen’s sword, it was nothing more than mortal metal. Other than if it struck the eyes or the glabella, it wouldn’t be able to harm the body fatally.

He was still hesitating about whether or not he should attack and take Long Chen’s life. After all, Long Chen had attacked him first. Even if he killed Long Chen, he would have justification.

Long Chen stared at Zhong Changsheng indifferently. Ignoring his divine energy fluctuations, Long Chen said, “Of course, you can view what I just said as bragging. If you don’t believe me, you can try it. But I will just warn you that you shouldn’t. If you do, that’s the end of everything.”

Zhong Changsheng stared at Long Chen gloomily, filled with hesitation. Long Chen was clearly someone with extremely dense mortal qi within him. Such a person was barely acceptable by the High Firmament Academy’s standards.

Normally, he would be able to kill a mass of such people with a single palm. But facing Long Chen, he was completely shaken and didn’t dare to attack.

“We’ll see what happens in the future.” Zhong Changsheng then clenched his teeth and left with his people, deciding not to attack in the end.

“Wow. You look pretty weak, but you’re actually amazing,” said the woman beside Mu Qingyun.

“Zhong Ling, don’t be rude.” Mu Qingyun frowned.

That Zhong Ling stuck out her tongue but apologized. “Sorry, I’m just happy to see Zhong Changsheng look like he ate dog poop. Long Chen, don’t mind me.”

When Mu Qingyun had introduced herself and asked Long Chen for his name, that had just been a polite formality. They had all known Long Chen’s name before because it was written in the registration for the exam.

Long Chen looked at this woman. Her smiling face looked truly innocent, and everything she thought was written on her face. He smiled. “Of course. I should be thanking you.”

“Brother Long is too courteous. I’m ashamed to say it, but we were only forced to fight back because the other side forced us to the point of no return. It just so happened that your matter made this fight much more straightforward. We didn’t really help you,” said Mu Qingyun.

“I’m still grateful. As an ascender, I have no friends or family in the immortal world. I appreciate your care.” Long Chen cupped his fists to them. Although they hadn’t managed to help him with anything, just the intention was enough.

“Big brother Long Chen, you’re too polite! You have the Seven Star Elder as a backer. Although it might not be enough to say that you can run rampant in the academy, there are definitely only a few people who would dare to offend you,” said the other woman beside Mu Qingyun.

The others also looked at him admiringly. It was no wonder Long Chen dared to act like this when he had the support of the Seven Star Elder.

“Let me introduce you. These two are my sisters, Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu,” said Mu Qingyun.

“What pretty names,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“Hehe, big brother Long Chen really knows how to talk.” Zhong Ling laughed. Her happiness was written clearly on her face. There wasn’t the slightest plot or scheme behind her face, not even the reserved veil of a woman.

“They have the same parents, but they grew up looking quite different,” said Mu Qingyun, growing more comfortable with Long Chen. He seemed like a different person now, and the atmosphere became friendly.

Long Chen was surprised to hear that. The two of them didn’t look alike at all. However, he didn’t express it.

“Big brother Long…” started Zhong Ling.

“If you want to call me big brother, you can call me third brother. Back where I came from, I was used to being called third brother Long San,” said Long Chen.

“Haha, okay, third brother, you really are amazing. Your cultivation base is so weak- hehe, sorry, I’m used to being straightforward. But you really are amazing! Teach me how to fight! If I can get half as amazing as you, that vile Zhong Changsheng won’t be able to bully us any longer,” said Zhong Ling expectantly. Her eyes shone with worship.

In her understanding of the world, to defeat a powerful opponent required a higher cultivation base that suppressed the opponent.

However, Long Chen had such a weak cultivation base but was so terrifying, crushing experts of the divine rankings and even slapping the discipline elder in the Divine Flame realm. That toppled her understanding of cultivation. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“That’s right, you’ll be an instructor in the future, so we can attend your classes. We’ll definitely study hard!” said Zhong Xiu as well.

“Third brother Long, you seem much more skilled than the other instructors. They just teach us some theories that aren’t really useful in real battle.” The other disciples beside Mu Qingyun were also excited. It seemed that they wanted to attend Long Chen’s class right away.

However, according to the academy’s rules, they could only attend lessons from official teachers, and Long Chen was not officially given that position yet.

“Who is Long Chen?”

Just at this moment, a thunderous voice rang out and a group of people walked in. When they saw the person at the front, Mu Qingyun and the others jumped in shock and then hastily bowed.

“Greetings, Divine Lightning Elder!”
