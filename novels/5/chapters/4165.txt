Chapter 4154: Slaughter You to the Last

“Brazen creature-!”

The Eighth Elder roared furiously and reached toward Long Chen to teach him a lesson.

In response, Long Chen’s hand swung through the air, smoothly striking him in the face. At this close distance, even if the Eighth Elder was twice as strong, he wouldn’t be able to dodge this move. The Eighth Elder wasn’t even able to finish cursing before being sent flying.

Feng Fei and the elder of the Jiang clan hastily stepped to the side. The Eighth Elder flew past them.

BOOM!

The Eighth Elder stamped on the ground, stabilizing himself. However, there was a deep handprint on his face.

“Sigh, even after living for so many years, you still act as immature as youngsters.” The Jiang clan’s elder sighed and shook his head.

The Eighth Elder was enraged, his killing intent exploding out of him. The disciples that had come with him were also infuriated and took out their weapons.

“Long Chen, you dare to be rude to the Protector Elder?! You won’t leave the Sage King Prefecture alive!” roared one of the disciples.

“If you don’t keep your mouth clean, you won’t leave this camp alive,” said Long Chen darkly.

The Long clan was an Eternal clan, but the ones they sent to speak to him were actually these idiots. They had no intention of properly speaking to him and only wanted to take his treasures.

However, when had Long Chen ever endured that kind of insult? He was thoroughly disappointed with the Long clan, fury blazing in his chest. Even as powerful as he was, the Long clan still looked down on him. Then his father would definitely be suffering.

Thinking of that, Long Chen’s killing intent erupted, and black runes appeared deep within his eyes. His wild killing intent caused heaven and earth to change color.

The instant Long Chen’s killing intent was unleashed, the countenance of the Jiang clan’s elder changed. This killing intent was so dense it had taken physical form. It was practically a mental domain that could even affect an expert on his level.

“Who do you think you are to spout such big words?! As long as the Long clan gives the order, without even needing our full force, just four of our Protector Elders would be enough to completely destroy this place and slaughter you all!” shouted the Eighth Elder.

The Eighth Elder had just declared that he could slaughter them all when a bone spear silently appeared. He couldn’t react until it had already pierced his chest.

Even the Jiang clan’s elder and Feng Fei were startled. Only after the bone spear had pierced through did they notice that a silver moon had appeared in the sky. This area was covered by its silver light.

Xu Jianxiong’s figure slowly appeared. He then slowly lifted the Eighth Elder’s body, his gaze icy-cold. “Destroy this place? Slaughter us all? Do you think an idiot like you is capable of such a thing? Even if a hundred idiots like you came, what could you do?”

Even Long Chen was taken aback when Xu Jianxiong made his move. It was only at that moment that he fully comprehended the extent of Xu Jianxiong's terrifying power.

Under his silver moon manifestation, everyone, including Long Chen, lost track of him. As the master of this silver moon world, even the Eighth Elder could not dodge his attack.

Now, the Eighth Elder’s life was entirely within Xu Jianxiong’s hands. His life and death could be decided by a single thought from him.

The Eighth Elder and the other disciples of the Long clan were stunned. They hadn’t thought that a battle between innate Heaven Venerates could be decided in an instant. Was the difference between them really so great?

Originally, they had thought that as long as the Eighth Elder could tie down Xu Jianxiong, a few of them could join forces to subdue Long Chen. They had been full of confidence at the start, viewing Long Chen and the others with disdain.

However, now, one of them had been turned into a meat pancake by Long Chen and was lying there motionlessly. As for their innate Heaven Venerate, he was pierced through the chest, his life in the opponent’s hands. Hence, these youngsters panicked, not knowing what to do.

The Eighth Elder furiously roared, “I refuse to believe that you’ll kill me! If you kill me, the Long clan will-”

“Give it up. You cannot represent the Long clan. If my guess is correct, you coming here was not the Long clan’s decision but your personal choice!” interjected the Jiang clan’s elder. To Xu Jianxiong, he said, “Race leader, please calm your anger. This fellow does not represent the Long clan, so a lesson should be enough. After all, Long Chen is also a member of the Long clan, and it is not our place to deal with family disputes. Long Chen should probably deal with them himself, at least, when it comes to these matters.”

Xu Jianxiong nodded. “Alright, then I’ll give the Jiang clan some face. Eighth Elder, remember this favor. If it weren’t for the Jiang clan, although I might not kill you, I would definitely cripple you. The Fullmoon race is no longer the old passive race. We fear no one and will not submit to any threat. Hopefully, you can remember this lesson. If there is a next time, I guarantee that even if a Heavenly Divinity descends, they won’t be able to protect your life.”

As Xu Jianxiong pulled out his spear, the silver moon in the sky slowly faded. The world then returned to its original color.

The Eighth Elder clenched his teeth furiously. He had never suffered such humiliation in his life. However, Xu Jianxiong’s silver moon world could appear with no warning at all, making it impossible for him to defend against it. Now, he knew that the power disparity between the two of them was not small. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

If he were to fight here, he would only be humiliating himself. As a result, he could only swallow his anger and coldly say, “To dare to interfere in my Long clan’s affairs, I hope you don’t regret it when the time comes.”

“Hahahaha!” Xu Jianxiong raised his head to the heavens and laughed. “I have never regretted anything that I’ve done in this life. If your Long clan could make me feel regret, I’d say that you really have skill.”

Xu Jianxiong could be described as an individual who had weathered countless storms. On the other hand, someone like the Eighth Elder, who consistently failed to realize just how perilously close he came to death, was encountering someone like Xu Jianxiong for the first time. His idiocy knew no bounds.

An ordinary person, after narrowly escaping death, definitely wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant. But this fellow still acted tough. He was quite the marvel.

Long Chen’s killing intent had originally started settling down after hearing the Jiang clan’s elder speak. If the Eighth Elder was really acting by himself to get the Heaven Earth Cauldron and not representing the Long clan’s attitude, then there was still room to talk.

After all, his father was in the Long clan. Before saving his father, he couldn’t become complete enemies with the Long clan.

“Scram. I, Long Chen, am no soft persimmon. Not just anyone can crush me,” said Long Chen coldly.

The Eighth Elder’s expression was dark, so he must be thinking about something unsavory. But Long Chen, aware of the Eighth Elder's idiocy, had no patience to waste words with him.

“Just you wait!”

The Eighth Elder clenched his teeth and brought his disciples away, one of whom had to be dragged along due to his inability to walk. They had come ferociously but left wretchedly, looking rather amusing.
