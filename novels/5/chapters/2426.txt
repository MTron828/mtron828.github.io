Chapter 2416 Collecting the Karmic Hell Flames

Translator: BornToBe

“Why does your tone suck so much? What do you mean, steal? We’re not stealing, we’re taking. Understand?” Long Chen lazily smiled at the furious Hong Yaoyang.

With his connection to Mo Nian, he was able to sense that Mo Nian had finished absorbing the energy of the sword and had moved on to the mortal husk.

However, Long Chen had told him to wait for a moment. The reason he had taken the risk to attack Hong Yaoyang again was to force him off his throne.

Based on Long Chen’s understanding of Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, he knew that the throne was the foundation of their power. If he didn’t kick Hong Yaoyang off the throne, then perhaps it would have been possible for him to stop Mo Nian from taking his mortal husk.

After seeing how infuriated Hong Yaoyang was, Long Chen guessed that he had been correct.

The blood pool and divine sword had lost most of their connection to him before this, but his mortal husk was different. It was his past life. Although he had buried it, it wasn’t completely severed. So he had sensed it when Mo Nian began to touch it.

Unfortunately for him, the karmic hell flames were crazily assaulting his palace. Long Chen’s ability at causing trouble had brought a calamity upon him, while Long Chen was hiding inside the Demon Moon Furnace. Since he didn’t attack them further, the karmic hell flames were focused on Hong Yaoyang.

The karmic hell flames had been provoked by Long Chen at the beginning due to him using the Nirvana Scripture to control all flames. They didn’t want to listen to his orders due to how weak he was. Even with the Nirvana Scripture, they were unwilling, so they fought.

Now that Long Chen was simply hiding and not further antagonizing them, the karmic hell flames lost a great deal of their hostility toward him. Their attacks were concentrated on Hong Yaoyang.

“These karmic hell flames are terrifying, but they aren’t united. If used properly, then even a god could be incinerated in an instant.” Long Chen sighed emotionally as he watched the karmic hell flames attack the palace.

At this moment, Hong Yaoyang focused entirely on blocking the assault of the karmic hell flames. He had no time to bother with his mortal husk. That was precisely the result that Long Chen had been looking for.

The Demon Moon Furnace slowly floated above the sea of flames. Long Chen poked his head out. The flames protecting him dissipated.

When he stopped using the Nirvana Scripture, the karmic hell flames no longer felt that he was trying to control them, and they stopped targeting him. Now he even dissipated the other flames to express his sincerity. Showing that he posed no threat to them, the karmic hell flames didn’t bother him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hong Yaoyang, work hard. I look favorably upon you,” encouraged Long Chen.

Hong Yaoyang almost died from rage. His palace was surrounded by karmic hell flames, and he was only able to bitterly hold on. He couldn’t even stop his mortal husk from being stolen.

Normally, a single strand of his divine power sent to his mortal husk could wipe out Mo Nian, but now he had to focus entirely on the karmic hell flames. He didn’t dare to get distracted. If his palace was incinerated, then his throne would be vulnerable. His throne was the foundation of his power. If it was damaged, he would lose his power.

If his throne was damaged, his divine energy would fade away. Tens of thousands of years of cultivation would be gone in an instant.

He should be able to wipe out Long Chen with a smack, but he didn’t dare to at this moment. Seeing him standing there so carelessly, Hong Yaoyang felt like he might explode.

All he could do was focus all his power on blocking the karmic hell flames. Once they used up all their energy, they would return to Purgatory, and then he could wipe out Long Chen and Mo Nian.

He was in a race against time. It would just be up to who could achieve their goal first.

Hong Yaoyang was a bit regretful that he had been too careless. He had provoked the karmic hell flames. How had that landed him in this plight?

“Mo Nian, hurry up. This fellow has seen through our goal,” messaged Long Chen.

“Don’t worry, I’m almost done,” replied Mo Nian.

Hearing that, Long Chen relaxed. Looking around, he asked Ling-er, “When you absorb the karmic hell flames, can you help me absorb a bit for myself as well? Not much, just a tiny bit.”

Long Chen returned to within the Demon Moon Furnace. Huo Long was currently in slumber within the Heavenly Flame Orb. He wanted a bit of the karmic hell flames for it to absorb in the future.

With Huo Long’s constant growth, he felt that it would be possible for Huo Long to gain the power of the karmic hell flames if it devoured some of them. If Huo Long could transform its flames into karmic hell flames, just how terrifying would that be?

Ling-er assented and a ball of dark red liquid slowly condensed within one of her runes.

“Amazing,” praised Long Chen. The Demon Moon Furnace was actually able to draw in some of the karmic hell flames so easily. Furthermore, its innate will had weakened.

The Demon Moon Furnace was truly a supreme treasure. Long Chen formed a hand seal, and a translucent flame wrapped around the karmic hell flames.

The karmic hell flames actually ignited the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame.

“Huo Long is still in slumber, so the flame energy I can control is much weaker.” Long Chen shook his head. With his current flame energy, it seemed that it would be very difficult to subdue even a single drop of the karmic hell flames.

“Time to risk it all.” Long Chen clenched his teeth and directly sent the karmic hell flames into Mo Nian’s astral space.

BOOM!

Mo Nian’s astral space was instantly set ablaze.

“What are you doing!? Are you trying to incinerate my astral space?!” Mo Nian’s voice rang out from the other side.

The drop of karmic hell flames vanished in the next moment. The Heaven Flipping Seal had sent it into the primal chaos space. It had only been in Mo Nian’s astral space for the blink of an eye.

However, in that blink of an eye, Mo Nian’s giant astral space became a barren land. Black space twisted just from its passing.

Long Chen hadn’t even alerted Mo Nian in advance, making him jump. If his astral space was destroyed, he would be doomed.

Ignoring Mo Nian, Long Chen waited for Evilmoon’s reply. Very quickly, it replied that the karmic hell flames had been suppressed.

“Nice. The primal chaos bead has never disappointed me.” Long Chen clapped his leg excitedly. The primal chaos bead was truly amazing. “Ling-er, help me absorb some more, but do your best not to disturb them too much to avoid them targeting us.”

One drop after another of the karmic hell flames passed through Mo Nian’s astral space, making Mo Nian cry out. He demanded an answer. Long Chen replied that he had to focus on his own work and absorb the mortal husk. Nothing else was worth his attention.

Using Mo Nian’s astral space as a conduit, he sent more and more of the karmic hell flames into the primal chaos space.

As he moved more and more of them, he found that as long as he was fast enough, the damage to Mo Nian’s astral space was almost negligible. Furthermore, any damage slowly recovered in time. It wouldn’t affect his combat power.

“Big brother Long Chen, I’m finished. I’ve completely removed all the impurities in my body,” said Ling-er excitedly.

“Hehe, excellent. Then help me absorb more of the karmic hell flames. This is very useful to me.”

“Alright.” Ling-er began to help Long Chen absorb more and more of the karmic hell flames. They gushed out of her runes and condensed into a foot-long ball.

“Nice!” Long Chen’s heart pounded excitedly. If such a large amount of karmic hell flames were not controlled properly, then they would blow up Mo Nian’s astral space. If that happened, Mo Nian might just come for his life.

He pushed his Spiritual Strength to the max to maintain the stability of that sphere. He passed it through Mo Nian’s astral space as fast as possible.

The flame sphere didn’t even land on the ground, but it left a mass of violently twisting black space within Mo Nian’s astral space. However, it didn’t damage his astral space.

Seeing that, Long Chen was at ease. He began to absorb more and more. Last time, he hadn’t had a chance to gather any of them. Just thinking about how he had missed that chance filled him with regret.

This time, he wasn’t going to miss this opportunity. Fortunately, there were so many karmic hell flames outside that they didn’t seem to feel any sense of alarm with him stealing a bit.

An incense stick’s worth of time later, Long Chen suddenly sensed that the power of the karmic hell flames was starting to decline.

“Mo Nian, are you done yet?! There’s not much time left!”

Previously, Hong Yaoyang had said that it would take four hours for the karmic hell flames to retreat. However, it had not even been two hours, and they were already showing signs of declining. It was unknown what trick Hong Yaoyang had played.

“Haha, I just finished. Now what? Should we find a place to meet up?” asked Mo Nian.

“No need. I’ll send the Demon Moon Furnace into your spiritual space. You summon her and enter, and then the Heaven Flipping Seal can send you to my side.”

Long Chen covered himself in his flame protection. He left the Demon Moon Furnace’s protection and sent it into Mo Nian’s spiritual space.

Within the sea of karmic hell flames, Long Chen felt like he was going to be incinerated. He estimated that he would be dead within three breaths’ time.

Fortunately, Mo Nian was quick. Long Chen summoned the Demon Moon Furnace again and immediately entered.

“Damn, you did all this?” When Mo Nian arrived, he stared in amazement at the scene before him.
