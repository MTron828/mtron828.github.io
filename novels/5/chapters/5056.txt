Chapter 5045 Blind People

What enraged Long Chen was that a giant battleship actually charged straight toward him as if his flying boat was invisible.

Although some snobs had shot past Long Chen’s flying boat and intentionally caused powerful currents to strike his boat, Long Chen had managed to endure it as he didn’t want to expose himself.

However, this one was different—they aimed directly at his flying boat, clearly intent on killing him. Just like that, Long Chen snapped.

Long Chen came out of his flying boat, with a seven-color cross on his palm. When the giant battleship crashed into his flying boat, Long Chen’s palm landed solidly on the battleship.

“Blood Ocean - God Slaying Cross!”

BOOM!

In his fury, Long Chen didn’t hold back and pierced through the battleship’s formation instantly, breaking the battleship apart.

Long Chen was like a boulder in the air, causing the battleship to split around him. Its momentum carried it forward, and it scattered like a firework.

The next moment, startled cries echoed as blood rained down, and the smell of blood mixed with devil qi filled the air.

This battleship had been carrying tens of thousands of devil experts. Innately tyrannical by nature, the devil race routinely acted with extreme arrogance, so being easily passed by a Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix moments earlier had irked them. When they saw a tiny flying boat rocking in front of them, they instantly took out their anger on it.

However, they hadn’t expected the tiny flying boat to contain a death god. Countless devil experts instantly met their end when their battleship was destroyed.

Only over ten heaven vein experts and eight Heavenly Chosens survived. Seeing their battleship obliterated and their disciples slaughtered, the survivors were both shocked and incensed.

This moment embodied the devil race’s nature. Without a word, they directly took out their weapons and attacked Long Chen.

In response, Evilmoon swung out and crushed a group of Heavenly Chosens and heaven vein experts with their weapons. Their so-called divine weapons might as well be carrots in front of Evilmoon.

In the previous battle, Evilmoon had devoured a huge amount of blood soul energy, so countless runes were awakening within its blade, and it was now blacker, with black qi swirling around it. In contrast, when the Earth Cauldron’s runes awakened, it slowly grew brighter.

With its newfound power, Evilmoon shattered Heaven Saint divine weapons and sent limbs flying through the air.

Even Long Chen jumped in shock when he saw Evilmoon’s sharpness. Compared to what it had been in the Long clan, it was vastly more powerful. With it in his hands, Long Chen was like a tiger with wings. He didn’t even need to use Split the Heavens.

“Run!” a two-vein Heaven Saint roared, charging at Long Chen to buy time for the other survivors to escape.

However, he overestimated his power. Along with his weapon, he was cut in two with a single slash.

Long Chen moved like a phantom, catching up to the stragglers and slaying them all. They didn’t have the slightest ability to resist in front of him.

“Worthless trash. What happened to your courage?” mocked Long Chen. Only now did his anger settle.

Long Chen didn’t know what branch these devil experts were from, but their power was a far cry from the four divine clans. Yet, they still had the courage to challenge him.

“This is no good. I can’t be so low-key, or I’ll constantly have to deal with people trying to trample me. I can kill them now, but once I’m in the Glacial Heaven Domain, I won’t be able to do it so casually. Otherwise, the Brahma Pill Valley will notice. I need a disguise,” muttered Long Chen.

In the cultivation world, staying low-key wasn’t always an option. Otherwise, certain people would always try to trample you. Many people delighted in bullying the weak and indulging in slaughter.

“Big Brother Long Chen, why not disguise yourself as a flame cultivator? I can have you wear the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress. Your air will instantly change, and even people familiar with you won’t recognize you,” proposed Huo Linger.

“Wear the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress?”

Hearing Huo Linger’s suggestion, Long Chen couldn’t help but shiver. Have him, a man, wear a woman’s dress? More like those familiar with him would pretend not to recognize him. Feeling speechless, Long Chen declined her idea.

“Big Brother Long Chen, you can disguise yourself as a lightning cultivator. I can use my power to cover up your aura and appearance,” proposed Lei Linger.

“No, your thunderforce contains the power of heavenly tribulation. There aren’t lightning cultivators with that kind of aura. It’s too conspicuous. Plus, that Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix just flew by. Did you sense it? Don’t you have a certain thought?” asked Long Chen.

“I... hehe, of course.”

Lei Linger didn’t know the Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix’s origins but sensed a terrifying pressure from it. That was an extraordinary existence.

Having followed Long Chen for so long, Lei Linger naturally knew what Long Chen was thinking. However, Lei Linger was much more reserved than Huo Linger, who would directly voice her thoughts.

Long Chen chuckled. “That’s why I can’t use your power as a disguise. If we encounter him, he will definitely want to devour your power. Then I’ll have no choice but to fight him. Although I don’t know how strong he is, I sensed a powerful pressure from him. All I know is he’s much stronger than Zhao Qingtian and may be on the same level as Long Tianrui. I’m not afraid to fight him in other places, but I don’t want my identity exposed here. So, it’s best to be a bit more low-key before entering the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain. Hmm, but I can’t be too low-key, or too many blind people will disturb me.”

Hearing this, Lei Linger was so moved to know that Long Chen was thinking about her. After going through the divine pool’s baptism, she could cultivate on her own, not only in the primal chaos space but even in the outside world. After all, she was already a Heavenly Chosen. After becoming a Heavenly Chosen, she realized her greatest shortcoming was her lack of powerful divine abilities.

This was something Long Chen had long since taken note of. But due to having no way to solve it, he hadn’t said anything. However, after encountering the Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix, Long Chen had the thought to get some treasures from it.

After pondering for a bit, Long Chen disguised himself as a flame cultivator, and the flame he chose was the Sun Flame. As its pressure was the strongest, it would scare off some people, and most experts wouldn’t dare to provoke him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Following that, he summoned a pair of flame wings on his back and conjured a flame mask on his face. Stepping on a flying flame sword, he flew off.
