Chapter 4685 Death Substitute Art

When Ying Tian was out of the void, he was shocked to realize that he had fallen into a trap.

Long Chen’s previous random strikes on the void were all to make him think that Long Chen couldn’t find where he was. However, those random attacks were just bait.

When the moment was right, Long Chen launched his trap, forcing him out of the void, and as soon as Ying Tian was out, he was struck by the whale spine.

This looked like a coincidence, but in reality, it was all perfectly calculated by Long Chen. Ying Tian’s skill in concealing himself was unparalleled, but the moment Long Chen’s blood stained his sword, he could no longer escape Long Chen’s senses.

Furthermore, Lei Linger had been guiding the attack of the Warrior of the Starry Sky, or it wouldn’t have so accurately struck that place. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

By the time Ying Tian reacted, the whale spine was already right in front of him. With his face twisted in fury, he swiftly formed hand seals.

“Lifehunter Death Substitute Art!”

Nine figures identical to Ying Tian appeared and exploded at the same time, transforming into blood runes resembling giant nets covering the sky.

BOOM!

The impact crushed the void and sent Ying Tian flying. While he had miraculously survived, his body was covered in cracks as if he was on the verge of exploding.

“Long Chen, I swear you will pay for this!” Ying Tian roared, clenching his teeth with fury, his voice dripping with bloodthirst.

Just now, he had used a life-saving technique of the Lifehunter race—a substitution technique unlike any other substitution technique in the cultivation world.

This technique created substitute bodies out of their own life fate, and it was the only secret technique that the Lifehunter race never transmitted. Its most terrifying aspect lay in its ability to manifest substitute bodies that would absorb and endure the full force of any lethal blow, along with its karma.

Back then, Long Chen had set up a huge trap for Ying Tian, but it hadn’t reached the point of forcing Ying Tian to use his substitute bodies. After all, creating a single substitute body required an enormous amount of resources: his essence, qi, and spirit, as well as an extraordinary amount of time.

His substitute bodies were equivalent to extra lives for him. In other words, no matter what kind of terrifying enemies he encountered, he had nine lives to use against them. Even if he couldn’t beat them, he would be able to easily flee from their grasp.

With Ying Tian’s power, he had never been forced to sacrifice any of his substitute bodies... until now.

Normally, a substitute body was equivalent to a new life. Yet, Ying Tian instinctively summoned all of his substitute bodies this time, and they were all slain in one blow. It was only through this sacrifice that he narrowly managed to cling to life.

In other words, the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s attack was enough to kill him nine and a half times. Having lost all nine substitute bodies at once, Ying Tian was brimming with hatred. He had never dreamed that his nine incomparably precious substitute bodies would perish all at once.

Meanwhile, Long Chen was shocked to see Ying Tian survive. He knew he wouldn’t have survived if he were in Ying Tian’s position.

Indeed, the Lifehunter race’s trump cards were immensely powerful. It was no wonder they dared to challenge the violet blood race.

“Big Brother Long Chen, just stay steady! Give me a bit more time and I should be able to control him!” Lei Linger sent Long Chen a message at this time.

Her voice contained a hint of excitement as she found that the Warrior of the Starry Sky seemed to have weakened a great deal. She was gradually gaining control over him.

This discovery gave them hope. If she could control the Warrior of the Starry Sky, then by joining forces with Long Chen, none of their enemies would be able to escape.

Long Chen had been thinking of how to eliminate Ying Tian because he was the greatest threat. However, after hearing Lei Linger say this, Long Chen immediately stopped chasing.

Just as Lei Linger said, as long as he could stay steady, he would pass the tribulation successfully. There was no need for him to fight Ying Tian head-on.

After all, the hole in Long Chen’s chest had yet to heal. The destructive will of the Heavenly Daos lingered on it, obstructing the healing process, and after all the fights and injuries, the primal chaos space’s restorative powers had begun to wane.

In the outside world, the Dragonblood warriors immediately cheered upon seeing Long Chen land such a devastating blow to Ying Tian. Now, Yue Zifeng no longer needed to take the risk of charging into the heavenly tribulation.

The Warrior of the Starry Sky was still attacking Long Chen with his mighty whale spine, but his attacks were much weaker now. Long Chen could now dodge them all with ease.

At first, people thought that Long Chen had managed to grasp the rhythm and trajectory of the warrior’s attacks. However, they soon realized that it was not the case. Long Chen was just standing there, and the whale spine was just flying past him over and over. They couldn’t understand what was happening.

“The Warrior of the Starry Sky is rapidly weakening. Is the heavenly tribulation over?”

The people within the tribulation were startled to sense this.

“Is it everyone’s best time to attack?” asked someone eagerly. Quite a few people looked at Luo Changsheng.

It was as if Luo Changsheng had become their tactician, and everyone wanted to know what he thought. However, Luo Changsheng’s expression was still indecisive.

“Have you noticed that while the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s aura is falling, something even more terrifying is rising?” said Luo Changsheng.

“Now that you mention it...”

The experts were swiftly jolted by a growing sense of unease. While they had initially sensed that something was off, this reminder served as a piercing alarm in their minds.

“Is the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s power being absorbed by something?!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the heavens shook, and a giant bronze fragment appeared before Long Chen. Seeing it, Long Chen instantly had a bad feeling.

At this moment, Lei Linger had taken full control over the Warrior of the Starry Sky, so she sent the whale spine smashing toward the bronze fragment.

Even so, that fragment simply stood like an iron wall in front of Long Chen, not budging in the slightest.

“Bye!” Long Chen instantly had a bad feeling and shot away.

After that, one giant bronze fragment after another appeared, fully sealing Long Chen within them.

As hundreds of fragments appeared, they suddenly merged to form a giant bronze cauldron.

“The Heaven Earth Cauldron!”

The eyes of Luo Changsheng and the others almost popped out of their heads.
