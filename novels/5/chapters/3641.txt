Chapter 3630

At the rear of the Alldevil race, a blood-colored sphere of light appeared, sucking in the blood on the ground. At this moment, intense spatial fluctuations began to come from it.

When everyone saw that spatial channel, their expressions changed. No one knew where that channel led to, but they all knew that it definitely wasn’t something good.

They were already struggling to deal with the devil beasts and Alldevil experts before them. If they still had to deal with the reinforcements from the Alldevil race, the human race would be doomed.

“Kill our way over! We cannot allow them to succeed!” shouted Guo Ran. At this time, they had rested for an hour and had recovered about eighty percent of their energy. Their battle armors were also repaired.

Just as Guo Ran shouted, the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, Xue Yifan, and the others abandoned the defensive line. Like a sharp blade, they pierced toward that blood-colored sphere.

Originally, the nine of them had been fully blocking the Alldevil race’s attacks. But now, they became a furious arrow blasting through their midst, reaching that sphere in just a few breaths’ time.

Guo Ran and the others cheered. This was the power of their seniors. Although the youngsters had plenty of Blood Qi, the runes on their battle armors relied on their comprehension of the Heavenly Daos to activate. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Without a high enough mental realm, there were many runes that they couldn’t activate. After all, their battle armors were supported by their physical bodies and mental realms. Their armor was the bridge connecting the power of the Heavenly Daos and their own power.

When nine half-step Divine Venerates joined forces, they were unstoppable. They pierced right through the battlefield, invigorating the human race’s side.

“You want to create a transportation formation here? Keep dreaming!” The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch shouted. He was the first to reach this formation. At this moment, his divine weapon slashed into the sphere.

BOOM!

The spatial gate crumbled. Seeing that, heaven-shaking cheers rang out.

However, those cheers quickly turned into shocked cries. The spatial gate’s runes were blasted apart and then gathered once more.

“What?!”

The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch was shocked and attacked once more. But this attack was even weaker than the last. The spatial gate merely quivered and didn’t crumble.

“How can this be?!” Everyone was stunned.

“Attack it together!” shouted the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch.

BOOM!

The nine of them attacked with all their power. Nine rays of divine light converged, forming a blade of death that struck the spatial gate.

The spatial gate crumbled once more. This time, it wasn’t just the spatial gate that crumbled. Even the earth was torn apart and the void collapsed. This attack had broken the laws of space.

“Hahaha, children, do you see? We old-timers still have a use,” laughed the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch.

However, when they heard that laughter, everyone’s heart quivered. His voice might still be loud, but it was lacking power. His voice was already a bit hoarse.

“Patriarch…”

The Celestial Essence Sect’s disciples were all aggrieved. After fighting all-out for an hour, the nine of them had managed to stall the devil army, but they had also exhausted a great deal of their longevity. After launching an all-out attack to destroy the spatial gate, their patriarch was like a lamp that had run out of oil.

If the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch had reached that point, then the others were definitely no better. Looking at their figures, people called out, ”Seniors, come back! Leave the rest to us.”

They didn’t want these seniors who were past their prime to continue throwing their lives away. The youngsters would use their power to protect them.

Just at that moment, a shocking and horrifying sight appeared. That crumbled spatial gate converged once more.

“How can this be?!” Seeing that, people felt despair. It was actually impossible to destroy the spatial gate.

“I understand. This is the Devil Blood Gate. It is condensed by the blood and soul energy of the Alldevil race and the devil beasts. No matter how many times we destroy it, it will reform. Unless we can exhaust all the blood soul energy inside, it will reform. But clearly, that is impossible.” Xue Yifan sighed.

Everyone looked at the battlefield. The world was already soaked in blood, and the heavy resentment in the air was the lingering soul energy of the dead.

There was an endless supply of blood soul energy for this spatial gate to repeatedly reform. It would be the same no matter how many times they broke it.

“Perhaps only boss can destroy this spatial gate. But…”

Guo Ran panicked. This spatial gate wasn’t something that they had the power to destroy. He knew that Long Chen could, but Long Chen was fighting with Alldevil Tianye in the distance. He couldn’t help them all the way over here.

“What to do? What can we do?!”

Xie Liuer and the others were all anxious. But they couldn’t think of any solutions.

“Hahaha!”

Suddenly, the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch raised his head and laughed. “Children, don’t worry. Victory will definitely be ours. Leave this spatial gate to us.”

When the patriarch said this, for some reason, everyone had a bad premonition.

Xue Yifan and the others exchanged a look, and they all suddenly laughed. It was a laugh of delight and familiarity.

“We’ve fought against each other for a lifetime, scheming here and there. Now that the end comes, it really is a huge joke,” laughed a half-step Divine Venerate.

“You’re right, it really is a huge joke. I normally felt myself to be a wise martial god, only making my move when victory was already in my hold. Now, it seems so foolish and laughable,” agreed another half-step Divine Veneratte.

“I’m the most foolish of all of us. I always felt pride in my decisions. Now, I find that I’ve made many wrong decisions in this lifetime. But at least, I made two correct decisions. One was to follow senior Xia Guhong back in the day, and the other was to fight alongside dean Long Chen. Hehe, I bore witness to two peerless heroes in this lifetime. That’s enough.” The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch looked at the distant battlefield of Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye. He had a very pleased laugh.

“It seems that it’s dean Yifan who is the wisest with the greatest vision. Regretfully, we don’t have a chance to learn from you,” sighed another half-step Divine Venerate.

“It is a shame that we won’t get to see the children grow up and unify the Alldevil Star-Field. We won’t get to see the glory of their forging arts,” said another elder. He looked at the human race’s warriors in the distance. A sad light filled his eyes.

“It doesn’t matter if we can see it or not. What’s important is that they will all grow up and unify the Alldevil Star-Field. As for us, we have to do what only we can do,” laughed Xue Yifan.

“Right, you are absolutely right. Let’s start!” said the other elder.

“Wait. We can go, but we can’t bring some things.” Xue Yifan took out a case. He placed his battle armor, divine weapon, and other things inside before flinging it toward Guo Ran in the distance.

The other elders followed suit, passing down their own things. The nine of them laughed. Taking each other’s hands, they walked toward the spatial gate.

“Dean…!”

“Patriarch…!”

“Don’t!”

At this moment, everyone knew what was happening. They all cried out in horror, and countless people wept, crying for them to return.

“Children, this world belongs to you. This is the final thing that we can do for you.”

The nine of them walked into the spatial gate. Suddenly, their blood soul energy erupted, and the nine of them self-detonated at the same time.

“NO!” Everyone from the human race screamed in anguish.
