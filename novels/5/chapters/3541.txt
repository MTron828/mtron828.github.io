Chapter 3530

The Heavenly Flame World was open, so countless experts charged through the current, rushing toward that spatial gate as fast as possible.

The various protectors of the major forces also charged in. All of them could enter the Heavenly Flame World. The question was whether or not they could endure the roasting of the Heavenly Flames.

At this moment, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan exchanged a glance. Yu Qingxuan said, “Let’s go together.”

Long Chen nodded. Along with Yu Qingxuan and her two guards, they entered through the gates. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Clearly, Yu Qingxuan was doing this out of the kindness of her heart. She was afraid that other World Kings would suddenly attack Long Chen at this time. With the two of them together, the others would be restrained by her status. At the very least, they wouldn’t attack him here.

Yu Qingxuan was most worried about this aspect. There were far too many terrifying existences hidden here. Who knew whether or not the Soaring Dragon Company had sent some terrifying World Kings as well?

Long Chen was grateful for Yu Qingxuan’s invitation. She was acting carefully, showing consideration for his face.

The four of them then charged through and quickly approached the core of the gates. After that, a huge whirlpool appeared.

Once they entered the whirlpool, that would be the true Heavenly Flame World. However, after entering this whirlpool, space became chaotic, and people would be sent to different locations.

If they wanted to stay together, they needed to be close and form a powerful force field. That way, the four of them would be guaranteed to land in the same place.

Those two fourth Heavenstage World Kings were already forming hand seals. Layers of divine light enveloped the four of them. However, Long Chen suddenly stepped outside of this light.

“Long Chen, you…!” Yu Qingxuan was shocked.

“Qingxuan. Thank you for your kindness, but let us part here. This world has many ugly things that I don’t want you to see.” Long Chen smiled at her and waved his hand. His figure then vanished within the whirlpool.

Yu Qingxuan stared blankly at the spot where Long Chen had vanished. She didn’t quite understand his words.

“He doesn’t want you to see a bloody scene. This person is a true expert, a warrior that crawled out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood. You cannot imagine what he has experienced. It’s because not everyone in this world is as fortunate as you. This world’s cruelty is not something you can fathom,” said one of her elders.

These two elders had watched Yu Qingxuan grow up and were more familiar with her character than anyone else. They helped explain Long Chen’s motive when they saw that she didn’t quite understand.

At first, they had been vigilant toward Long Chen. This youngster was too dangerous. In the Fallen Immortal Pavilion, when Zhao Mingxuan provoked him, his heaven-shaking killing intent even made their hearts pound. It was at that moment that they realized they had misjudged them, and that he was actually an extremely terrifying existence.

Just before this, they had seen the killing intent of countless experts from countless races when Long Chen appeared.

Based on their knowledge and these experts’ spiritual fluctuations, the two elders could tell that these lifeforms all came from different worlds. For them all to form killing intent toward Long Chen on sight meant that Long Chen had killed far too many people of their races. This enmity was something that had sunk into their souls.

At first, they were unable to understand why the oldest academy in the world would make a youngster a dean. Even if it was just the dean of a branch, that was playing around too much. But now they found that this youngster called Long Chen was definitely not simple.

These two elders also entered the spatial whirlpool with Yu Qingxuan. As a result, they had only come out of the other side when they saw a giant heavenly saber slash down, bringing with it a rain of blood.

“It’s Long Chen!”

Yu Qingxuan cried out. After that saber-light, Long Chen transformed into a bolt of lightning that vanished from everyone’s sight.

Up in the sky, there were dozens of World Kings covered in blood, fear in their eyes.

“It’s the Soaring Dragon Company’s people,” said one of the elders beside Yu Qingxuan, frowning.

“Interesting. They really are stingy. Although they announced that huge bounty, they want to save the money for themselves. It’s too bad that rather than eating the meat, they broke their teeth instead.” The other elder shook his head.

Clearly, these people had come prepared, first entering the Heavenly Flame World to catch Long Chen off-guard. That way, they would keep the one billion immortal king crystal reward.

Regretfully, their plans went awry, and their trap couldn’t stop Long Chen. Looking at the charred corpses on the ground, it seemed that they had lost quite a few experts.

Some experts, who happened to see this scene, jumped in shock. This Long Chen was actually terrifying.

But after breaking through their blockade, Long Chen immediately fled. Hence, many World Kings with more powerful auras wanted to attack but had no chance.

“Ignore them. Let’s go.”

The two elders only glanced for a moment before bringing Yu Qingxuan away.

This place was a channel, and the other side of the channel was the true Heavenly Flame World.

Their field of view rapidly widened as they passed through. They then saw a fiery world.

This was a scarlet world composed of ragged stone piles. Wild flames gushed through this world, weaving between heaven and earth. Occasionally, flaming meteorites would descend and smash into the ground.

The ground here was made of tough stone, and the air was filled with the scent of fire. If a non-flame cultivator were to come here, they probably wouldn’t be able to last even a few breaths.

After progressing through the Heavenly Flame World for an incense stick’s worth of time, the World Kings all came to a pause. There was a barrier up ahead that they couldn’t cross.

If they forcibly tried to, the flame energy would multiply on top of them. Even World Kings couldn’t endure it. They could only send their disciples to this point.

“Be careful. Other than yourself, don’t trust anyone,” implored one of Yu Qingxuan’s elders.

“That Long Chen isn’t bad,” complimented the other elder. However, the other one glared at him.

Yu Qingxuan’s face reddened slightly. The two of them had seen through Long Chen’s feelings toward her. She then hastily agreed and rushed off deeper into the Heavenly Flame World.

Once Yu Qingxuan entered the depths of the Heavenly Flame World, the two of them found a place for themselves to sit by the barrier. They patiently waited.

It wasn’t just them. The other World Kings were doing the same.

However, what people found unexpected was that the Soaring Dragon Company’s people also came. Their spiritual fluctuations were active, and they seemed to be discussing something.

“It seems that they’re still worried that Long Chen won’t die. They’re going to make sure that he’s a tortoise caught in a jar,” said one elder.

“I keep feeling like this matter isn’t so simple. Look!”

The other suddenly pointed into the distance. They saw a lifeform pass through the spatial wall, merge into heaven and earth, and vanish without a trace.

As a result, both of their expressions grew solemn. They were bewildered.

“This time, something unimaginable is probably going to appear within the Heavenly Flame World. Qingxuan is in danger. We must tell her to be careful. No, we have to report this to the sect master!”
