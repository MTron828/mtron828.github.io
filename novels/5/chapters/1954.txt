Chapter 1944: 1944

Guo Ran flew over, clutching a golden stone .

“Would this little fellow be trying to con me?” Even Long Chen was startled . His kick had actually just been for Guo Ran to remember not to get arrogant, or he might lose his life .

“Boss, look! This is Scarlet Blood Essence Gold! It’s a divine ore that can be used in forging divine items!” Guo Ran’s eyes were blazing . Even his voice shuddered with excitement .

Everyone couldn’t help but jump . It really was a treasure . The ore that Guo Ran was clutching was like gold with blood veins running through it . There was a faint divine energy coursing through it that was a bit similar to divine items .

“Yes, it’s definitely Scarlet Blood Essence Gold, and this ore is extremely pure . You could probably refine nine-tenths of a tael of the Scarlet Blood Essence Gold from a three-feet square block of this ore . Is there more below?” asked Yue Xiaoqian .

“Yes, it’s a huge ore deposit! I just grabbed a piece and immediately came to report it!” said Guo Ran . “Boss, I can create divine items with this ore!”

“You can actually forge divine items?” Long Chen was startled .

“Hehe, just a bit . ” Guo Ran was smiling brightly, but he actually acted low-key . That appearance made others want to kick him .

Long Chen was truly shocked . It seemed that the Ethereal Crafting Secret Record Guo Ran had obtained in the Jiuli secret realm had truly shocking origins . It even included divine items .

Although Long Chen was extremely disappointed in Guo Ran when it came to cultivation, when it came to forging, he was only filled with admiration .

If Guo Ran was acting like this, then he was definitely confident in creating divine items . Even Long Chen was getting excited .

The Dragonblood warriors had already advanced to Life Star, but only a portion of them had divine items . Moreover, most of those divine items also weren’t weapons that they were suited to .

In the Yin Yang World, many divine items had been destroyed in combat, while the survivors had mostly fled . They hadn’t gained very many .

If Guo Ran could create a matching armor and weapon that was on the level of divine items for each Dragonblood warrior, wouldn’t they be able to flip the heavens?

More and more Dragonblood warriors arrived from the transportation formation . It was only a moment later that they were all gathered .

“It seems we’ve really struck gold this time . Guo Ran, well done . ” Long Chen patted Guo Ran’s shoulder . Now, Long Chen believed that Guo Ran’s luck was truly monstrous .

“Hehe, it’s all thanks to boss’s nurturing . ” Guo Ran said humble words with the least humble expression .

“Everyone, move out . Form up ten-man groups led by squad leaders, and eliminate the Magical Beasts in the surroundings . But be careful . These Magical Beasts have advanced to the twelfth rank thanks to this lake . Some of them possess strange divine abilities, so don’t be careless,” ordered Long Chen .

“Yes!” The Dragonblood warriors’ eyes lit up . Their power had grown so much that they were itching for some powerful opponents to test it against .

They spread out along the lake . Very quickly, roars began to ring out . As expected, many twelfth rank Magical Beasts were hiding in the vicinity .

“Long Chen, isn’t it a bit dangerous for them to split into ten-man groups?” whispered Yue Xiaoqian .

“It’s fine . Ten people is already very safe . These Magical Beasts were originally only at the eleventh rank, and they relied on this lakewater to break through to the twelfth rank . However, their bloodlines aren’t very good, and their divine abilities aren’t very strong as a result . They’re a level below twelfth rank Magical Beasts that advance to that level thanks to their bloodline and talent . Even in a one against one, I believe the Dragonblood warriors would be able to challenge them . As long as they aren’t as careless as Guo Ran, there will be no problem . And there’s no one as careless about their life as Guo Ran in the Dragonblood Legion,” said Long Chen .

“Boss, I was wrong . ” Guo Ran raised his hands in surrender . He knew that Long Chen was still angry about his previous display .

Seeing this, Long Chen hoped that he would finally remember this lesson .

The Dragonblood Legion was rapidly spreading throughout the surroundings, and rumbling rang out in the distance . Their fights were extremely intense .

“Boss, should we go help?” probed Gu Yang .

“Can you grow up a bit? Are the captains really interested in fighting over other people’s prey?” scolded Long Chen with a smile .

“It’s not fighting over prey . Seeing them fight just makes my hands itchy . ” Gu Yang scratched his head .

The others laughed . Gu Yang was saying what they were all thinking . Having advanced to the Life Star realm, they all wanted to know just how strong they were .

However, Long Chen’s meaning was clear . These weren’t very powerful twelfth rank Magical Beasts, and they would be left to the ordinary Dragonblood warriors as training targets . They weren’t for the captains . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Xiaoqian, does the original devil race have the ability to refine ores?” asked Long Chen .

“Yes, we do, but that’s limited to ores on the level of Ancestral items . We also have the tools to refine material on the divine item level, but they’ve been wasting away for countless years . I don’t know if anyone is still capable of using them,” said Yue Xiaoqian .

The original devil race had declined from their peak, and they had barely been able to scrape by . Furthermore, what were they supposed to refine while they had been blocked from the Martial Heaven Continent? Whatever they refined couldn’t be sold . As a result, the original devil race had been stuck in a vicious negative-feedback loop . Many of their old inheritances had been lost .

Refining ores was expensive and required investment . Even the current original devil race that was recovering couldn’t quite refine this ore .

“Hehe, as long as you have the ability, it’s fine . I’ll think of something,” said Long Chen .

More and more Magical Beasts were startled awake . The Dragonblood warriors were slaying them one by one .

These Magical Beasts were quite a bit weaker than twelfth rank Magical Beasts that had advanced thanks to their powerful bloodlines . Hence, the Dragonblood warriors were able to kill them in just a few exchanges . In the ten-man squads, some of the members didn’t even get a chance to fight before the target was slain .

Two hours later, twenty-three hundred twelfth rank Magical Beasts had been slain . The battle spoils went to Long Chen’s primal chaos space .

The immense life energy had made the World Trees flourish once more, and the Yin Yang Immortal Grass on the edge of the black soil had grown larger . It was filled with life and death energy .

However, for some reason, the Yin Yang Immortal Grass didn’t possess the slightest spirituality . There were no signs of it growing a consciousness like the Yin Yang Immortal Grass in the Yin Yang World .

It seemed that raising a Yin Yang Immortal Grass like that one wasn’t possible . However, it could still help him out .

After the surrounding Magical Beasts were killed, Long Chen ordered the few water elemental warriors of the Dragonblood Legion to suck away the lakewater with their magical arts .

As the water level dropped, it revealed a giant mountain at the bottom . That mountain looked like it had been made of gold .

Guo Ran hadn’t lied . There was a giant mineral deposit here thousands of miles wide .

There were also dozens of Magical Beasts that had been hiding in the water, but they were slain as soon as they were exposed . Once the silt at the bottom of the lake was cleaned up, they were looking at an impressive golden mountain .

“We’re rich . This ore deposit is huge, and this is just the tip of the iceberg . Based on the terrain, at most, the part that’s exposed aboveground is just half of the total deposit,” said Yue Xiaoqian excitedly . Once this news was sent back to the original devil race, her people would definitely be overjoyed about it .

Just the value of this one mineral deposit far surpassed the price of establishing the spatial channel and the grand formations . Even if they didn’t gain anything else, they had profited .

“Xiaoqian, alert the seniors of the original devil race . It would be best if they established a transportation formation right here . Don’t worry about saving money . Our time is more precious,” said Long Chen .

“Alright . ” Yue Xiaoqian sent a message through the original devil race . Some Elders should quickly be rushing over .

“Guo Ran, you stay behind . Work together on excavating and refining this ore . Give me an estimate on how long and how expensive it will be . You’re an expert in this regard, so I trust you,” said Long Chen .

As expected, this bit of praise revitalized Guo Ran . He solemnly said, “Boss, go in peace . I’ll handle things here . ”

“Are you cursing me to die?” Long Chen glanced at Guo Ran .

“Ah, I misspoke . I definitely didn’t have that intention,” Guo Ran apologized .

“Fine then . Everyone else, continue with the previous arrangement . Stay in your ten-man squads and spread out . You have compasses that are locked onto the spatial channel, so you won’t get lost . If there’s anything suspicious, mark it down and alert the higher-ups . Make sure to be careful,” said Long Chen .

The Dragonblood warriors hastily flew off, spreading in every direction like a flood . Long Chen didn’t give them any direction to go, so they could run wherever they wanted .

No one knew where Wilde had run off to . Whether or not they could find him was up to luck .

“We should go as well . Each one of us will go in one direction . Hopefully, we can find Wilde . ”

Long Chen picked a direction . Lightning wings appeared on his back, and he shot away .

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others also chose their directions, and flew away .
