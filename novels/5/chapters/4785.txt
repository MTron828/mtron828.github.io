Chapter 4774 Sinister Yue Wuxu

Step.10

Step.7

Step.18

Long Chen’s footsteps echoed softly, yet each one seemed to tread upon the hearts of the onlookers. His aura of killing intent was so thick that it stifled the breath of those watching.0

With a cold demeanor, Long Chen said, “I’ve killed my way from the mortal world to the immortal. From the moment I set foot onto the path of cultivation, I have always been in a bloodbath or on my way to another bloodbath. I’ve traversed mountains of corpses and seas of blood, each composed of countless peak heavenly geniuses. I have also experienced the pain of losing my brothers and beloved. The pain made me grow, and the blood let me see the true face of this world.19

“All those who block my way are trying to harm me, slowing down my growth. If I am not strong enough, it will only cause history to replay itself. Those painful experiences… it is enough to only experience them once in this lifetime. If someone wants me to experience such a thing again, I will definitely kill them. Their souls will sink into hell for eternity, never to reincarnate.”2

Long Chen’s voice resounded throughout heaven and earth like the edict of a god or the curse of a devil. Toward the end, the world shook because of his voice.2

As his voice seemed to drip with bloodthirst, the Dragonblood warriors clenched their weapons. They thought back to the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, recalling their brothers who fell back then. Long Chen’s words dug out those painful memories, as well as firmed their determination to continue advancing.0

This kind of pain was something even the powerful Dragonblood warriors couldn’t endure once again. If they didn’t want history to repeat again, they had to keep getting stronger.1

All blockades in their way were enemies trying to stop their growth. They had to be mercilessly removed; otherwise, history would repeat itself. 0

Within the crowd, Yu Qingxuan had turned pale and was holding her head, so Bai Shishi went to support her. “Big Sister, what’s wrong?”0

“I’m fine. I feel like I’m remembering something, but I… can’t seem to grasp it.” Yu Qingxuan shook her head. When she looked at Long Chen, her soul pounded, causing vague images to somehow appear in her mind.10

She tried to see them, but those images remained vague, and all her efforts only caused her soul to shake.0

Looking at Long Chen’s back, Yu Qingxuan could sense the pain he normally kept hidden deep within his heart, along with a raging fire that could incinerate heaven and earth.0

He was like a volcano that had been suppressed for millions of years and was finally erupting. As Long Chen stepped toward Yue Wuxu, he didn’t unleash any aura, but his will alone was enough to cover the heavens.0

“What dense resentment! What killing intent!”0

“His killing intent is absolutely terrifying. I feel like my own blood is about to freeze.”0

“Heavens, how many people has he killed for his killing intent to condense into such a terrifying force field? It’s practically its own domain!”0

Whether it was the senior Sage Kings or the new generation of Divine Venerate disciples, they were all shocked by Long Chen’s killing intent.0

Yue Wuxu’s expression finally changed as Long Chen’s will locked him down. It was his first time having a lock placed on him in this manner.0

In this situation, there was no running; he could only advance. If he were to take the slightest step back, his Dao-heart would instantly crumble, and a heart-devil would be born in him. When he reached his Eternal tribulation, this heart-devil would definitely take the form of Long Chen and slay him.3

Yue Wuxu had never imagined that Long Chen would be so vicious. For him to unleash this kind of killing intent meant that in this battle, only one could leave alive. This was Long Chen’s grand gamble.5

Hovering steadily in the air, Yue Wuxu pointed his sword at Long Chen. “You are an ascender from a lower world, and you dare to say such big words? You might have reached the peak of your path, but others are born far above your peak. An inferior creature like yourself is only fit to grovel beneath the feet of the mighty, relying on their benevolence for survival. Even a toad like you wants to soar into the sky? What a joke.”1

Unfazed by Yue Wuxu's taunts, Long Chen responded evenly, “I’ve seen many people like you who rely on schemes, and I don’t even remember how many of them I’ve killed. You don’t need to try to anger me; my anger already simmers. Suppressing anger for too long isn’t good for the body. Today marks the Dragonblood Legion’s first step into the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, and your head will serve as a warning to all who dare to provoke us.”0

In response, Yue Wuxu laughed and answered, “Hahaha, I, Yue Wuxu, have killed countless experts in my life. But it’s my first time encountering someone who brags so naturally. Fine, today I’ll let you see the true power of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s experts!”0

BOOM!1

Suddenly, the void beneath Yue Wuxu’s feet exploded. When his giant sword sliced the void, a crescent moon flew out of it, accompanied by an ear-piercing sound. This crescent moon was only three meters long at first, but it quickly grew until it became a giant heavenly blade. 0

This was the same move he had unleashed back in the passageway. However, back then, he hadn’t wielded this sword. Now, the identical attack carried a pressure hundreds, if not thousands, of times greater.0

In the hidden space, the Sage King that supported Long Chen cried out, “He’s using his trump card right at the start? What a treacherous fellow!”0

“He truly is sinister. He has long since stealthily sent his bloodline power into his sword and then instantly unleashed his full power without any warning,” said the Heaven Overseer.1

The Sage King supporting Long Chen was worried now. Yue Wuxu was a native expert and familiar with all the laws here. 1

On the other hand, Long Chen had just set foot into the Sovereign Emperor Heaven and hadn’t had any time to get accustomed to the laws of this world. As a result, his magical arts and divine abilities would be restricted. This battle was extremely unfair to Long Chen.0Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Even with this immense advantage, Yue Wuxu still launched a sneak attack out of nowhere. This was clearly an attack to decide victory or defeat, and he wasn’t giving Long Chen any chance to retaliate.0

Everyone had thought that their battle would be a step-by-step progression. After all, the two of them had never fought before, so neither of them was familiar with the other side’s trump cards. However, Yue Wuxu’s full-power attack was already right in front of Long Chen.0

These experts were all stunned. If this attack was aimed at them instead, they wouldn’t have any chance to counterattack. It was simply too fast.0

BOOM!1

Yue Wuxu's attack crashed into Long Chen with tremendous force. Mountains quivered, and ripples pulsed throughout the heavens and earth. Astral winds swept over the bystanders, cutting like sharp blades against their faces.1

“Is it over?” Everyone looked to where Long Chen was.0

“What?!”2

When the air cleared and they saw Long Chen, their eyes nearly bulged from their sockets in astonishment.2
