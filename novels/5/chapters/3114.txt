Chapter 3103 Overestimating Oneself

Long Chen’s divine ring slowly spun. His expression was calm as he met his enemy with a single hand, and yet that hand seemed to cover the entire world’s power.

Even as runes activated all over Chu Gan and his fist shook the stage, he was completely suppressed by Long Chen’s hand.

The martial stage cracked, and those cracks continued to spread further and further. The martial stage suddenly grew. It was its own world, and based on the power of the fighters on it, it could grow or shrink.

There had already been a few battles during which the martial stage had grown to accommodate the experts fighting. However, it had grown slowly. Due to the power erupting from the fighters, the martial stage would constantly change.

However, with this one palm, the martial stage instantly widened many times. This had yet to occur during this Nine Prefecture Convention.

The size of the martial stage was related to the power of the fighters on it. There was one thing that could be sure. The greater the martial stage grew, the more pressure it had to be under. This was a very simple way to measure a person’s power.

“You are trying to defeat me in my strongest area by making me laugh to death with this pitiful power? I can’t believe you were so shameless as to come out and embarrass yourself.” Long Chen looked at Chu Gan oddly.

During this time, he had been constantly increasing his realm. As his cultivation base grew, his physical body also rapidly strengthened. However, it had been a long time since he last used this power.

Long Chen had always been dissatisfied with his physical power. No matter how it increased, it was unable to endure the power of the divine flame power of his 108,000 stars.

Even Long Chen himself didn’t know just how much stronger his physical body was compared to when he was in the Jialin Immortal Land.

Just now, when Chu Gan had come at him so arrogantly, he had really thought that Chu Gan was very powerful. But this attack of his wasn’t worth crap. Long Chen didn’t know if Chu Gan was deliberately holding back or if he was really this weak.

On the other hand, Chu Gan was shocked. He was born with immense divine power. In terms of pure physical power, amongst the Chu family’s disciples, he could definitely be rated number one.

The number of Titan blood runes that he condensed broke the record for the Chu family’s disciples, and this feat made him one of the Chu family’s most important successors.

This fist, which he had originally thought would be enough to blow Long Chen wretchedly, was like a dragonfly trying to shake a pillar. It appeared incredibly weak.

“That was just a probing blow. Don’t get too pleased so early!”

Chu Gan held his right shoulder with his left hand, and his runes erupted with power, seemingly ablaze. His Blood Qi soared.

As he unleashed his power, the martial stage began to crumble. The next moment, a giant hole appeared and flying rubble filled the martial stage.

Everyone paying attention to this side was stunned. How could a person’s power rise to such a level?

It had to be known that whether it was Long Chen or Chu Gan, they were purely competing with physical power. They weren’t using magical arts or divine abilities, yet were able to unleash such immense power. This was something that many people had never seen before.

Chu Gan then roared and a giant vortex of rubble began to fly. At the same time, the martial stage continuously expanded and the rubble whistled loudly. Seeing this, the people outside the arena grew nervous, afraid that the formation would break and the rubble would pierce through them.

“We’re finally seeing real experts! Spending that fortune on this ticket was definitely worth it!”

“Who knows how many people will never get to see a battle on this level in their lifetime? It was definitely worth it.”

“Everyone was holding back before, so watching them wasn’t the slightest bit satisfactory. But now, hehe, the fights will only grow more intense.”

Countless disciples watching felt their blood heating up. They had precisely come to watch the battles between real experts. Long Chen and Chu Gan’s battle was just what they wanted.

“Heavens, the martial stage is still expanding!” The martial stage quickly doubled in size after their first clash. It seemed as if Chu Gan’s power was limitless.

However, even as they were shocked by Chu Gan’s power, they realized that something was off. When the flying rubble slowly settled, they once more saw the two of them in their original posture.

Long Chen was still holding Chu Gan back with a single palm, and no matter what Chu Gan did, he was unable to shake Long Chen in the slightest. At the same time, the martial stage beneath Chu Gan’s feet was constantly breaking and repairing, breaking and repairing.

The martial stage would repair itself after being damaged, and the rate of repair would also increase with the intensity of the battle.

Moreover, for the waves of flying rubble to have been reduced meant that the martial stage was strengthening itself. The martial stage had now strengthened itself to the level of being able to endure Chu Gan’s power. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Heavens, what kind of monster is Long Chen?!”

Everyone’s jaw dropped. If they didn’t know that Long Chen was the Chu family’s mortal enemy, they would think that Chu Gan was cooperating with Long Chen to put on an exaggerated show. His current display was incredible. It was like an adult was bullying a baby.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen is mighty!”

The High Firmament Academy’s disciples cheered loudly, to the point that even their voices were hoarse. Although they knew that he couldn’t hear them, this was the only way for them to unleash the emotions inside them.

How many years had it been since the High Firmament Academy started to be bullied and turned into a joke by other powers? They called the academy a rotten boat that had lost all the splendor of its former years. Moreover, when the High Firmament Academy’s disciples arrived here, they clearly felt disdainful gazes from others.

Today, they were finally showing their true power. Seeing those people’s shocked gazes, they felt it to be indescribably cathartic.

Long Chen still stood there with one hand behind his back, facing Chu Gan expressionlessly. On the other hand, Chu Gan’s face had already turned purple.

Even as he did everything he could to push Long Chen back, he couldn’t. It was like he was rooted into the stage.

“Are you constipated? I wouldn’t relieve myself here,” said Long Chen kindly.

Just like that, Chu Gan coughed up blood, and his overwhelming power was thrown into chaos.

The next moment, Long Chen’s leg struck like lightning, hitting him in his abdomen. Chu Gan was sent flying.

He then smashed into the ground, tumbling back and leaving large holes in the ground before smashing into the barrier and bouncing back.

With such a blow, he had to have at least lost half his life. However, unexpectedly, he crawled back up. When people saw a certain object on his body, they became dumbfounded.

“What is that?”
