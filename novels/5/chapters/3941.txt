Chapter 3930 Unable to See the Light of Day

“Are you crazy?” was the dragon expert’s response.

“What? Can’t the bronze cauldron deal with them?”

“You can’t even control the cauldron. Without activating a single rune, you can’t even unleash a single trace of its power. Moreover, these fellows are Triple Supremes that have condensed the Three Flowers Heavenly Merger Manifestation, your human race’s so-called Three Flowers Condense the Pinnacle. Even in the immemorial era, such figures could be considered top experts. You, a little fellow who has just entered the Immortal King realm, wish to compete with them? You can’t compare them to those old fellows in the three thousand worlds. Did you think a tiny pool could raise any whales?” asked the dragon expert.

“I suppose not.” Long Chen understood now. There was still a gap between him and these old monsters. He was able to sweep through his enemies in the three thousand worlds, but he couldn’t do the same to these old fellows.

Because of this, he was a bit displeased. He felt like he had just reached the pinnacle, but he just had to run into these fellows. He hadn’t gotten enough of the previous feeling.

“Even if you could con one of them to their death, what would be the point? Let me tell you, that bronze cauldron’s origins are shocking. You cannot take it out so lightly. There are many old fellows here. If one of them recognizes the origin of this bronze cauldron, let me tell you, every single lifeform within the nine heavens and ten lands will hunt you down. Whether it is fellow heavenly geniuses or old monsters that have been sealed for tens of millions of years, they will all come out in full force. This is no joke. Conserve yourself, lest you let your head get hot and ruin everything,” warned the dragon expert sternly.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Long Chen’s heart shook. Although he knew that this cauldron’s origins were extraordinary, he hadn’t expected it to reach this extent. Considering that it was able to resist the attack of the black dagger, it had to be something on the same level. But it seemed that he was still underestimating it.

Long Chen was originally planning on conning Weng Taibei in the same way that he had done in Long Aotian. After that, Weng Taibei would at least be seriously injured, and Long Chen could deal him the killing blow. But it seemed that this actually wasn’t worth it in the dragon expert’s eyes.

Xia Guhong unleashed three slashes with his saber, causing heaven and earth to quiver.

“So the three flowers represent the essence, qi, and spirit, also representing the Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone. When all three merge into one, you become one with the heavens. Thus, there are immense differences even between fellow Divine Venerates,” realized Long Chen.

With every movement, these experts caused the ten thousand Daos to rumble. They controlled the laws of heaven and earth. Having reached the point of turning something complex into something simple, their power was concentrated. While on the surface it appeared as if their might was inferior to Long Chen’s in the battle of the three thousand worlds, in truth, it was the opposite. Every technique was perfectly polished. There were no huge explosions or mass collapses in the world because their control had reached a pinnacle. They didn’t waste a trace of their power.

An example was Enpuda’s attacks that had come silently and without any pressure, but they made Long Chen sweat and had almost taken his life.

“Your human race’s Divine Venerate realm is split into Heaven, Earth, and Mortal realms. They are Mortal Venerates, Earth Venerates, and Heaven Venerates,” said the dragon expert.

“Then are they all Heaven Venerates?” asked Long Chen. He had never heard of this.

“No, they are all Earth Venerates. Although they have merged their Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, as well as condensing the three flowers, they are one step away from Heaven Venerate realm as they have not fully merged all three flowers. If all three became one, the three flowers would become one three-colored Grand Dao Flower. It would condense above their heads, and that would be the true Three Flowers Condense the Pinnacle. They can only count as half-step Heaven Venerates. But that final half-step is incredibly difficult. It is like a heavenly chasm that countless people will never cross in their lifetime.”

Upon hearing about it, Long Chen was shaken. So the Divine Venerate realm was actually so complicated. It seemed that the ones that he had encountered in the three thousand worlds were all Mortal Venerates.

Based on the dragon race’s explanation, an Earth Venerate had to at least be a Double Supreme and would have condensed two Grand Dao Flowers.

When his thinking reached this point, Long Chen realized that he was wrong. The Divine Venerates in the three thousand worlds had not condensed a single Grand Dao Flower. They weren’t even Earth Venerates.

When Long Chen thought of this, he felt a chill. The Divine Venerate realm was like a pool of deep water. When he came out of the three thousand worlds, he thought that he would be able to sweep through the Divine Venerate realm. Perhaps he could even cause some trouble for Lord Brahma.

Now, he realized that he was thinking too naively. Lord Brahma had lived for countless years and had definitely become a Heaven Venerate. If Long Chen were to look for him, it would be no different than sending himself to his death.

At this moment, astral winds erupted. The Kunpeng ancestor, Weng Taibei, Enpuda, Liao Bencang, and the Alldevil race’s elders started attacking Xia Guhong sharply.

It seemed that everything before had just been probing blows. Now, they were truly unleashing their divine might. As the three flowers behind them spun, their auras mixed with heaven and earth.

BOOM!

The Kunpeng ancestor’s sharp claws tore through the void, covering the entire Violet Flame Heaven Capital. It was as if even the stars in the sky were pressed down by it.

“Are you really planning on having a decisive battle now?” Xia Guhong’s gaze instantly turned cold.

“Long Chen cut off my Kunpeng race’s wings! That is the greatest blasphemy to my race! Hand over the wings, and I can spare his life!” roared the Kunpeng ancestor.

“The victor is king. Since you lost, you should have lost your life. But now you want to take back the spoils of victory? What happened to your Kunpeng race’s pride?” retorted Xia Guhong frostily.

“If that’s your response, then let’s not argue any longer! We can decide things with our actual ability!” The Kunpeng ancestor sneered, showing no mercy.

BOOM!

Xia Guhong’s saber slashed down furiously. The body of the saber was shining as the power of the three flowers flowed into it.

With a heaven-shaking explosion, the immense power tore through heaven and earth, shattering the enormous Violet Flame Heaven Capital. It then began to sink along with the surrounding terrain.

Long Chen coughed up blood. Previously, Xia Guhong had been protecting him in his domain, so he hadn’t felt anything. But when Xia Guhong received the Kunpeng ancestor’s attack, he no longer had the power to protect Long Chen from the shockwaves.

Hence, when Long Chen felt their shockwaves, he realized just how terrifying their seemingly ordinary attacks were.

“Die!”

With Xia Guhong being tied down by the Kunpeng patriarch, Long Chen was exposed. Seeing this chance, Liao Bencang moved to attack Long Chen. In an instant, vast faith energy locked onto Long Chen. He couldn’t move within this frozen space.

“Double Dragon Destruction!”

He barely managed to form hand seals, summoning an attack that burst forth in the form of a twisting lightning and flame dragon.

BOOM!

The two dragons smashed into Liao Bencang, leaving him hacking up blood and in a miserable state. He was almost blown apart by that explosion.

“Brat of the human race, you won’t get a chance to grow up. You can die now!”

At this moment, the claw of a devil god crashed down toward Long Chen.

“I don’t care anymore! I’m going to use the bronze cauldron!” Long Chen roared to the dragon expert. He had used up the power of his dragon blood, and all his Spiritual Strength had been given to Lei Linger and Huo Linger. If he still didn’t use the cauldron, he would die.

However, before he could even summon the bronze cauldron, a resplendent cry rang out, sounding like a phoenix cry yet also like a dragon cry. It then caused the ten thousand Daos to submit as a supreme divine might descended.

After that, a flash of saber-light cut through the air and blasted apart that devil elder.

“Since you want to have a real fight, I, Xia Guhong, will give you what you want.”

Xia Guhong stood in front of Long Chen with a dragon sparrow manifestation behind him, pointing his saber at his opponents while exuding chilling killing intent that made them quiver.
