Chapter 3789 Slapped to Death

“Long Chen is here! Are there any friends or enemies who wish to meet me?!”

Long Chen entered the city and shouted, backing it with his spiritual yuan to spread it throughout every corner of the city.

This shout irritated countless people. This human city had human rules. It was not permitted to make such a ruckus in the city, or the offender would be disrespecting the city lord.

Even the Divine Venerates from the other races wouldn’t be so rude when they came here. Shouting like that would cause a fight all too easily.

“Who dares to shout in my city?! Are you not placing my Qingyun City in your eyes? Do you think a bit of ability is enough to not give face to anyone?!”

Multiple human Divine Venerates were drawn out by Long Chen’s shout. There were also other Divine Venerates who turned their heads to watch.

Just like other human settlements, Qingyun City had several experts from other races present. They liked watching the human race’s liveliness.

“Face? It’s not that I’m not giving you face. But if I give too much face, dogs will think of themselves as lions,” said Long Chen coldly.

“You… you’re courting death!” shouted one of the Divine Venerates furiously.

“In front of other races, you’re like beaten dogs with tails tucked between your legs. Against your own race though, you’re snarling dogs abusing your power. If you don’t want to die, then shut your mouths!” said Long Chen icily.

“Hahaha, how interesting. Dogs biting dogs. Don’t you get fur in your mouth? Well, just keep biting.” Within a restaurant, a large man drinking wine looked down on them and sneered.

This person’s Blood Qi was astonishing. He was clearly a demonic beast. Also, there were two Divine Venerates with him, so this person’s position was clearly not low.

Suddenly, Long Chen moved. He appeared in front of that expert in almost an instant and smashed a fist at him.

“Even an inferior human dares to be arrogant?!”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

That man was conceited, so he indifferently flew out and unleashed a punch as well. His fist transformed as he punched until it looked to be an elephant’s leg yet also a python. Because of them, the entire city quivered.

“Stop!”

The human Divine Venerates shouted. Perhaps the entire city would be ruined if this attack were to land.

However, what shocked people was that despite the overwhelming power and powerful Blood Qi, when Long Chen’s fist struck him, he simply exploded into blood mist.

In front of Long Chen’s fist, he was like a chicken egg. Everyone was stunned. They had all thought that a fierce battle was about to ravage the city. But things were over before they even started.

That person was just killed when the two Divine Venerates roared and pounced on Long Chen. At this moment, the terrifying might of a Divine Venerate erupted, causing countless people’s souls to quiver.

The two of them were like lightning, pincering Long Chen from the front and behind. Each of them landed a punch on him, one on the chest and one on his back. Terrifying ripples spread.

“What?!”

However, people were shocked to find that the attacks of these two Divine Venerates didn’t affect Long Chen at all. It was like he didn’t even feel it. He just looked at the Divine Venerate in front of him.

“You…” Terror rose within that Divine Venerate’s eyes.

Long Chen slapped him in the face, and his head directly exploded along with his Yuan Spirit.

Seeing his comrade be killed by a single slap in the face, the Divine Venerate behind Long Chen didn’t even think about vengeance. He turned and fled for his life.

Long Chen then raised his right hand. A lightning sword shot out, piercing this Divine Venerate’s body. He looked down at his chest in disbelief and saw the lightning sword reveal a sharp sword-light. When lightning flickered, his fresh blood was incinerated.

“Lei Linger, you really are amazing.”

This was all thanks to Lei Linger. The lightning sword was the same shape as the Wild Blade. Now, Lei Linger was clearly capable of fully controlling it and could even use its divine abilities.

“Explode.”

The lightning sword detonated with a shout from Long Chen, devouring that demonic beast Divine Venerate.

“This is the difference.”

Long Chen couldn’t help sighing inside as he watched the blood mist scatter. To challenge a Divine Venerate as a Divine Lord required immense courage.

But now, after he became an Immortal King, these ordinary Divine Venerates could be killed with a wave of his hand. The difference in realms was truly immense.

Long Chen had killed two Divine Venerates in just a few blinks of an eye. Seeing this scene, everyone within the city was horrified. They had all misjudged. This black-robed man with an ordinary aura was actually a supremely terrifying expert.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei’s auras were both simply ordinary. Their meridians were so wide now that their Blood Qi only occupied a small portion of them. That resulted in those who judged based on Blood Qi aura to severely misjudge their power.

Those human Divine Venerates were pale. They thanked their fortunes that they hadn’t interfered, or they would be the ones dead.

“Boss, Jiang Lei! Is it really you?”

Just then, three people walked out of a building. When they all saw each other, Long Chen and Jiang Lei were delighted. They had really run into Dragonblood warriors!

“Huo Qing, Yao Meng, Xue Ziyu!”

Long Chen’s eyes reddened. He knew the name of every Dragonblood warrior. It felt like it had been a lifetime since he had seen them.

The three of them openly wept upon seeing Long Chen. After the battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, they were all separated. Now that they were reunited, it felt like they were dreaming.

“Good thing we came out of seclusion, or we’d have missed you,” said Yao Meng, rejoiceful.

Only then did Long Chen think of something. He turned to the city lord. “Call out everyone in seclusion. Say that I, Long Chen, have come.”

That city lord who had previously shouted at Long Chen now acted like a junior, hastily ordering people to open up all the seclusion lands in the city. The people in seclusion would not be happy at being disturbed, but it didn’t matter. His life was more important.

As a result, there was a pleasant surprise. Two more Dragonblood warriors were found within the city. They were all incredibly excited at being reunited.

Suddenly, Long Chen looked at the sky with a mocking expression. “Sacred Pill Hall, you really refuse to give up. Today, my mood is good, so I’ll let you off. Brothers, let’s go find a good place for a feast.”

Long Chen and the others stepped onto a transportation formation and directly left. Just after they did so, countless figures appeared in the sky. These people wore the robes of the Sacred Pill Hall. Regretfully, they were one step too late.
