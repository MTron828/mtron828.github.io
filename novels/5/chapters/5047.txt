Chapter 5036 Blood Dyes the World

Long Qihua was shocked at being caught by Huo Linger’s Blaze Dragon Bone Whip. With a roar, two dragon figures condensed in front of his chest—his two heaven vein dragon qi, the very condensation of his life’s power. He used it to block Long Chen’s palm.

However, the moment these two dragon figures touched Long Chen’s Cross Blood Rune, they exploded. Long Chen’s palm struck with unstoppable force, shattering Long Qihua’s body into two parts.

“What?!”

This scene made the surrounding experts jump in fright. Long Qihua was the Long clan’s number one Heaven Saint, possessing two heaven veins. Even amongst the four divine clans, he would be considered a peak existence.

His all-out defense couldn’t block Long Chen’s attack. Struck in the chest, everything below Long Qihua’s head and above his waist was obliterated.

Terror swarmed Long Qihua’s face. Just as his head tried to escape, Long Chen grabbed it.

“Don’t!” Long Qihua cried out, but Long Chen savagely clenched his fingers. crushing Long Qihua’s head.

As Long Chen did so, a sharp sword stabbed his back. Long Yaoting had launched a sneak attack, almost crying out in excitement as he saw his attack succeed.

However, just as he cried out, a lightning spear pierced his chest. Lei Linger appeared.

After that, the battlefield grew chaotic. Huo Linger and Lei Linger appeared briefly before being surrounded. At this moment, a spear thrust toward Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t dodge and directly used his body to block the spear while he stabbed Evilmoon forward, still seeming as suicidal as ever.

Since the spear was longer than Evilmoon, the attacker ignored Long Chen’s attack with a snort. However, just as his spear pierced Long Chen’s chest, Evilmoon stabbed the attacker’s chest as well.

Evilmoon had left Long Chen’s hand to strike faster. Long Chen charged forward, letting the spear pass through him. He then grabbed Evilmoon and pulled it out of the dead attacker’s body.

When Evilmoon pierced the attacker, his fate was sealed by it. After taking out Evilmoon, Long Chen smashed its hilt into his own chest. The spear in his chest shot out like lightning, striking an expert near Huo Linger in the shoulder. Seizing the opportunity, Huo Linger obliterated his head with her whip.

“Come, let me see how many lives you’re willing to throw away!” roared Long Chen. He seemed possessed by a killing god. He was covered in blood, but it seemed like he didn’t feel pain. In his eyes, all he saw was slaughter.

Brandishing Evilmoon, Long Chen fought with reckless abandon against dozens of heaven vein experts. In moments, numerous wounds marred his body, but he managed to slay seven enemies. Among them was a two-vein Heaven Saint, akin to Long Qihua. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Long Chen was drenched in blood, striking terror into his opponents. Suddenly, he turned toward the Zhao clan leader. The latter’s heart instantly quivered, and he fled for his life without hesitation.

Suddenly, a whirlpool appeared in Long Chen’s eye and behind the Zhao clan leader. Unaware of it, the leader retreated straight into its grasp, despite his clansmen’s frantic warning.

He emerged from the whirlpool and inexplicably found himself beside Long Chen, who had already raised Evilmoon in wait.

“You dare to use my brothers to threaten me? Die!” Long Chen’s voice thundered as Evilmoon descended.

The pitiful Zhao clan leader hadn’t even grasped what had happened before Evilmoon cleaved him in half. His formidable power and cultivation base were of no use against Long Chen’s swift and decisive strike.

In reality, the four clan leaders were two-vein Heaven Saints, but years of administrative duties had dulled their combat prowess. Since they knew this, they had simply locked down the space around Long Chen to pressure him and create opportunities for others.

However, because of this, when danger struck, the Zhao clan leader instantly panicked, prioritizing flight over defense. This lapse of judgment led to his swift demise in a single blow.

After killing the Zhao clan leader, Long Chen was struck by a sword that slashed his shoulder, shattering his scales down to the bone. In response, he swiftly counterattacked with his saber, crushing half of his attacker’s head.

“Kill!” Long Chen’s roar reverberated, his overwhelming killing intent sending chills through the crowd.

“Don’t fight him alone!” shouted the Ye clan leader.

The Ye clan leader was astonished to see Long Chen withstand full-powered attacks from two-vein Heaven Saints. This indicated he was at least on par with them.

What truly terrified the Ye clan leader was realizing that their collective combat experience was no match for Long Chen. If this continued, they would be picked off one by one.

When Long Chen heard the Ye clan leader’s words, he suddenly shot over like an arrow released from a bowstring.

“Protect the clan leader!”

The Ye clan’s experts rushed forward urgently. With the Zhao clan leader already slain, they were determined not to let the same thing happen to their clan leader.

Reacting swiftly, the Ye clan’s experts withdrew to protect their leader, causing their encirclement around Long Chen to falter. When the Long clan leader saw this scene, he shouted, realizing if Long Chen wanted to run at this moment, no one could stop him.

But then, Long Qihua and Long Yaoting had fallen to Long Chen’s hand, so among the Long clan’s experts, only Long Qianxue could hold Long Chen back. However, Long Qianxue’s attacks were merely token gestures, as Long Chen’s terrifying bloodthirst had thoroughly intimidated her.

The retreat of the Ye clan’s experts disrupted their formation. Similarly, the Zhao clan’s forces were in disarray following the death of their leader, while the Long clan’s experts cowered in fear. Observing the chaos, the Jiang clan’s members also withdrew.

At this moment, they could no longer bother with their plans. Seeing Long Chen fighting like a devil on a rampage and their ranks dwindling by half, they were finally gripped by fear.

“Come! You wanted to kill me, didn’t you?! Keep going!” roared Long Chen. Long Chen was drenched in blood, a mixture of his own and that of his fallen enemies. Evilmoon’s black blade was also stained red.

The scent of fresh blood hung heavy in the air, sending shivers down people’s spines as they watched in horror. It felt as though they were trapped in a nightmare.

This was supposed to be the elite competition. How had it become a massacre feast? In the blink of an eye, the impartial umpire had become a devil. Staring at the lifeless bodies strewn across the ground, disciples from the four divine clans stood in stunned disbelief.

With just one man and one saber, Long Chen had decimated the forces of the four divine clans, forcing them into a panicked retreat. Though they still encircled him, no one dared to get close.

Long Chen scanned the crowd and in the distance, he spotted a woman waving to him.

She was Feng Fei, her face as pale as paper from the injury inflicted by Long Qihua’s sword. While not fatal, it had temporarily incapacitated her from combat.

Although she was pale, she squeezed out a smile for Long Chen.

Nodding to Feng Fei, Long Chen said, “If something happened to you, I would make the entire Heavenly Desolation Domain pay for it.”

BOOM!

Just as he said this, the entire domain quivered, and pillars of divine light erupted into the sky, surrounding everyone present.

“Big words. Can you even leave this place alive today?” An aged voice cut through the air, and countless figures appeared in the surroundings.
