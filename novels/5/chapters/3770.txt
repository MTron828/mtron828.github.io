Chapter 3759: The Increasingly Powerful Minghong Saber

“Devil Slash!”

Just as Long Chen’s saber fell, that Supreme devil expert also shouted. He reacted quickly and also unleashed his attack. Clearly, he was also an expert.

BANG!

Two divine weapons clashed. As a result, the ground beneath the devil expert collapsed, and a violet qi wave tore through the army of devil experts, blasting them back.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

Long Chen once more shouted and slashed the Minghong Saber. His attacks were unleashed in no more than the blink of an eye, not giving his enemy a chance to breathe.

That devil expert was startled. He hadn’t expected to draw out an expert of the human race. He once more raised his saber. This time, the Minghong Saber severed his saber and landed on his head. Thus, his body exploded.

Long Chen then raised his left hand, and a lightning arrow shot out, piercing a translucent figure.

“AH!”

That devil expert let out an unwilling cry. That translucent figure was his Yuan Spirit. He was actually extremely powerful, to the point where Long Chen’s saber attack didn’t end up shattering his Yuan Spirit. Regretfully, he was not strong enough to escape death.

“Minghong, you really are my good helper.” Long Chen looked at the Minghong Saber with delight. It was growing stronger and stronger. It was now even able to sever a World Domain divine item.

Long Chen’s first attack had left a rice-sized nick in his weapon. The second attack was accurately targeting that nick, destroying it.

After it was destroyed, its runes were absorbed by the Minghong Saber. The Minghong Saber seemed to be excited by Long Chen’s praise, and its runes lit up. Killing intent soared out of it.

“Kill!”

Long Chen responded with a thunderous roar. He then shot toward another Supreme expert of the devil race.

BOOM!

That devil expert blocked with a shield, only for the shield to be pierced through by the Minghong Saber. Half his body was destroyed.

After that, stars flowed on top of the Minghong Saber. As violet qi wrapped around it, a saber cry shook the nine heavens. It unleashed an aura that made gods and devils flee from it.

This was a divine weapon capable of advancing. Through devouring endless blood soul energy, through shattering countless divine weapons, it was growing stronger and stronger. Ordinary World Domain divine items had difficulty blocking its attacks.

“Retreat!”

The devil army saw that the situation had taken a drastic turn for the worse, so another Supreme expert immediately gave orders.

They had over three hundred thousand experts and a total of seven Supreme experts. However, Long Chen killed two, and Jiang Lei also killed one. So, they were now terrified and immediately fell back.

“You want to run? Leave your lives behind first!”

Jiang Lei stayed at their rear to cut them off. Seeing them rushing toward him, he put away his lightning sword. A lightning sphere appeared in his right hand.

“World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

Lightning concentrated in his hand. The lightning sphere then explosively grew, instantly devouring the devil army.

BOOM!

Lightning ravaged the battlefield, and the devil race’s experts were blasted apart by this lightning. Other than the four Supreme experts, the rest were all slain.

Jiang Lei coughed up blood. Even he was injured by the lightning explosion. Many of his bones were exposed to the air, and he tumbled into the distance.

“Kill!”

The four Supreme experts were also left black and bloody. They received significant injuries but not fatal ones. Seeing Jiang Lei wounded, they charged at him.

But all of a sudden, a golden vine shot out of the ground and wrapped around Jiang Lei. His body instantly vanished into the forest.

The four of their attacks landed on nothing. But rather than pausing at this, they continued to flee.

The next moment, lightning flashed and the Minghong Saber swung through their bodies like cutting apart melons. They were blown apart along with their weapons.

In front of the Lightning Falcon race’s secret arts, fleeing was the most foolish choice. They were already injured, and their bodies were somewhat numb. As a result, their spiritual perception was only around half of its peak. By fleeing with their backs facing Long Chen, they had decided their fates.

Long Chen sheathed the Minghong Saber. Its runes were still flashing. It was like it was still reveling in the aftertaste of this excitement.

After that, Long Chen went deeper into the forest. He saw the two girls in vine form helping Jiang Lei heal.

“Boss, this World Extermination Lightning Radiance really is badass… aiya!” Jiang Lei laughed, only to be kicked by Long Chen, causing him to shout in pain.

“What do you think you’re doing?! He’s already injured! His wounds have opened again!” scolded one of the girls angrily.

“If I don’t hurt him, he won’t learn his lesson. What did I tell you? The World Extermination Lightning Radiance isn’t suitable for you to use right now. Did you treat my words as wind blowing through your ears?” demanded Long Chen.

Long Chen had been hesitant to teach Jiang Lei the World Extermination Lightning Radiance from the start, afraid of him using it improperly. However, thinking of how Jiang Lei had survived on his own and had plenty of experience, Long Chen ended up deciding that Jiang Lei would know his own limits.

Long Chen had clearly warned him to only use this technique after becoming an Immortal King. That was because Jiang Lei’s body now had Lei Linger’s power. That was heavenly tribulation power. Jiang Lei had to at least go through a heavenly tribulation with this power in him before he could control a trace of it.

However, he ended up using it right now and even had the guts to call it badass. If Long Chen didn’t put him in his place, he wouldn’t learn his lesson.

“Wasn’t I just testing the effect? I also held back thirty percent!” quibbled Jiang Lei.

“If you hadn’t held back thirty percent, you wouldn’t even have a corpse left,” said Long Chen angrily. He then tossed him a medicinal pill.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After consuming the medicinal pill, Jiang Lei’s condition improved greatly. After all, he was only harmed by his own power. His recovery was fast.

At this time, the Spirit race’s people came out of the forest. They all thanked Long Chen. Long Chen looked at them and found that they weren’t bodies of flesh and blood. They were spirit vegetation.

Long Chen then understood that the devil experts had attacked them to take their life essence. The devil experts wanted to solidify their realms again before breaking through to the Immortal King realm. That was the perfect preparation for their tribulation.

“Little girls, bring me somewhere else. When I killed them, I checked their memories. It won’t end with just this one wave. Let’s go kill their next one,” said Long Chen.

“Big brother, you really are great! I’ll bring you over right now!” The two of them once more transformed into golden vines. But this time, Long Chen took the initiative to tell them not to wrap around his head. That was too ugly.

As a result, those two little girls ended up wrapped around Long Chen’s wrists. Long Chen and Jiang Lei then used their lightning movement art to rush deep into the forest.
