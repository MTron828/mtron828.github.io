Chapter 3864 Combined Attack

Long Chen had just stepped in when a murderous aura made him feel like he had fallen into an icehouse. Goosebumps covered his skin.

He saw endless corpses. They were like a vast sea, like surging mountains, and they stretched beyond the horizon.

These corpses were terrifying greater demons, Supreme World Kings. Also, the ancient runes on their bodies emitted a desolate qi that was very similar to the corpses in the heavenly tomb. In other words, these were species from that ancient era.

The monsters from back then were many times stronger than the ones now. But so many had died here.

The majority of these corpses were mangled. Some had even been cut in two by a sharp blade.

Those corpses still had violet light on their wounds. From this mark, Long Chen knew that they were killed by Luo Zichuan.

Furthermore, Luo Zichuan’s actions were clean. Looking at those wounds, Long Chen could practically see how he had cut through their monstrous bodies like melons.

When Long Chen had gone to the Luo family for the first time, he had been completely suppressed by Luo Zichuan. In their fight, he had been unable to even retaliate. At that time, Long Chen thought that Luo Zichuan had relied on his realm to suppress him.

However, even now that he was also an Immortal King, Long Chen felt that Luo Zichuan was an absolutely terrifying existence. Looking at those wounds that were as sleek as glass, he knew that Luo Zichuan’s power was highly concentrated. This kind of phenomenon would only occur when none of his power leaked out.

Concentrating all one’s power wasn’t difficult for experts like them. What was impossible though was for this power to not leak out at all even after striking the core runes and powerful defenses of these immemorial creatures.

Even with Long Chen’s immense power and profound control, this was something impossible. This level of minute control required perfect mastery over one’s power and spiritual fluctuations.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was no longer a matter of talent. It was something that could be honed through endless time experiencing intense battles. This control was practically the pinnacle of the Dao, something untouchable.

Long Chen was first shocked by these corpses, but his eyes quickly lit up. He directly reached out and grabbed all of them.

At this time, the single corpse on the black soil had only been half-decomposed. It was too slow. In other words, a corpse on this level was so powerful that even the black soil’s devouring power was less effective.

However, when he tossed these new corpses into it, the black soil quickly devoured them. Although they weren’t as powerful as the corpses from the heavenly tomb, they were worth something. Furthermore, with their numbers, the amount of life energy being unleashed now was even greater than what came from that single corpse.

As these corpses were thrown in, the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees rapidly grew. Even the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree at the core of this land began to grow. Its rainbow radiance grew even more mysterious.

“What do you want those corpses for?” Luo Zichuan couldn’t help asking when he saw Long Chen gathering them like they were treasures.

“Fertilizer. These corpses are very important to me,” said Long Chen with a chortle. In just a moment, the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees already grew to thirty meters.

The flames on their bodies also grew denser, their flame fluctuations becoming more intense. Also, Huo Linger had already recovered, but as the trees grew stronger, she almost went crazy with joy and began absorbing their flame energy again.

She was like a landlord demanding payment from her farmers. She was constantly gathering their fruit.

Fortunately, Huo Linger was smart and only absorbed a tiny bite from each tree so as to not affect their growth.

As she absorbed the Sun Flames and the Moon Flames, her aura grew stronger. With them as fertilizer, she nourished her Ice Soul source. This source energy then grew stronger and stronger, to a shocking level.

The full one billion corpses were thrown into the primal chaos space, piling into a giant mountain at the core of the primal chaos space. Even with the black soil’s terrifying devouring speed, it would require some time to digest them all.

An enormous gate quickly appeared ahead of them as they advanced through this world. This gate had a circular seal on it.

Long Chen could see eighteen ancient beast totems carved into the seal. Moreover, those totems seemed alive. When Long Chen approached them, a terrifying killing intent locked onto him.

“This is the God Sealing Seal. There are eighteen ancient beast corpse devils sealed inside, and they are different from the other lifeforms here. First, they emit endless devil qi. And second, they are Double Supremes that are a merger of devil root and demonic blood, and they are all in the Divine Venerate realm. I tried to kill them three times and failed every time. The first time, I was almost killed. Do not be careless. Once we start, you must immediately use your full power,” warned Luo Zichuan gravely.

“Family head, at your realm, isn’t fighting them directly too disadvantageous?” asked Long Chen.

Luo Zichuan said, “That’s how it’s set up. If you want to activate this seal, your cultivation base must be in the Immortal King realm. If it weren’t for that restriction, I wouldn’t have suppressed my cultivation base. Back then, I was planning to do this with Ningshuang…”

Luo Zichuan shut his mouth, but Long Chen already understood. Luo Zichuan’s original plan was for Luo Ningshuang and her future child to join forces with him to open this seal.

Unfortunately, his mother fled to the lower plane and married Long Zhantian, resulting in Long Chen being born. Because of this, the plans that Luo Zichuan had spent countless years preparing were ruined.

For him to shut his mouth suddenly, it was to avoid Long Chen feeling guilty. He then continued, “These eighteen corpse devils are incomparably ferocious. But after three tries, I’ve figured out the rules behind them. Together, they are in a set formation, and their Blood Qis are linked. This means that the combined power of all eighteen of them can be instantly unleashed in one go. The first time I fought them, I almost died because of that move.”

“Eighteen Double Supreme Divine Venerates that know a combination technique?!” Long Chen jumped in shock. If the power of all eighteen of them was concentrated together, just who could resist? But Luo Zichuan had actually survived!

“In a bit, I will activate it. Using a secret art, I’ll drag away seventeen of them. As for you, your mission is to immediately kill the last one in a single blow. As long as you can kill a single one, their formation will be ruined. After that, we can easily cut them down one by one,” said Luo Zichuan.

“Family head, are you sure?” Long Chen was startled. Luo Zichuan wanted to handle seventeen of them himself?

Luo Zichuan smiled slightly and patted Long Chen’s shoulder.

“Let’s start.”

Luo Zichuan raised the Violet Fern divine saber. Violet qi then erupted like the tide and rushed toward the seal.
