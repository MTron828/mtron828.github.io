Chapter 928 The Change in the Sect

Translator: BornToBe

“Lord Heaveneye has returned!” Just as everyone was about to activate their jade plates and leave, a shout rang out.

Long Chen hastily stopped everyone. A path opened within the crowd, leading to the transportation formation. Lord Heaveneye had finally appeared.

“Lord Heaveneye.” Long Chen quickly cupped his fists toward him. Long Chen was still grateful to him. If it hadn’t been for the identity plate he had given him, he and Yue Xiaoqian would have been killed back then.

It was also because of lord Heaveneye’s guidance that the aboriginals had formed such a strong relationship with him.

Long Chen was extremely moved by the aboriginals. They were simple and honest. Compared to the Righteous path which was filled with deception and internal conflict, Long Chen would prefer a place like this.

“I suppose I made it on time. Here, take this!” Lord Heaveneye looked weary from travel, but he tossed Long Chen a black jar, which had an ancient seal on it. It appeared to have been sealed for countless years.

“Ten Thousand Spirit Blood? This fellow knows how to spend wealth! Long Chen, what he’s giving you is a priceless treasure. This Ten Thousand Spirit Blood is an artificial Spirit Blood made during the immortal era. Although it’s not on the same level as a true Spirit Blood, as long as a rank four Celestial absorbs it, it will evolve into Spirit Blood that matches their elemental attribute, benefiting them for the rest of their life,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

Long Chen only heard the Eastern Wasteland Bell’s voice after receiving the jar. When he did, he couldn’t help but feel that it was incredibly heavy. Looking at lord Heaveneye’s weary appearance, he didn’t know what to say.

“Senior... did you leave in order to get this?” A sour feeling welled up within Long Chen’s heart. If lord Heaveneye hadn’t left, then with his intelligence, he definitely would have seen through Ji Changkong’s scheme. Then the hundreds of thousands of warriors from the aboriginals wouldn’t have been sacrificed.

“Child, don’t overthink things. As an unrivaled heavenly genius, it is fated for you to rise like a shooting star. Considering the cycle of karma, everything that I’ve done is for us. Go. The dragon swims through the sea, the Peng flies through the clouds. We will definitely meet again one day.” Lord Heaveneye patted Long Chen on the shoulder like a kind elder comforting a child that was about to go on a long journey.

Long Chen took a deep breath and put the black jar into the primal chaos space. He bowed deeply toward lord Heaveneye. Following him, Meng Qi and the others also bowed.

“This kindness is something I, Long Chen, will remember. I’m confident as well that we will meet again!”

Xiao Fei and the others waved goodbye as fiercely as they could. Long Chen’s unrivaled appearance during that shocking battle had made him the idol of every youngster. Now that their idol was leaving, they were full of unwillingness.

Long Chen swept his gaze over their reluctant eyes. After that, he finally steeled himself and crushed his jade plate. A rune erupted out of it and enveloped him. He instantly disappeared from their sight.

One after another, they disappeared. They couldn’t help but feel disappointed and frustrated.

“Don’t sigh. The current Immemorial Path is not the old Immemorial Path. Because Long Chen tore apart the dome of the heavens, he has released the aura of the outside world. The energy and laws that the Immemorial Path was lacking have been made up for. In other words, our cultivation bases will no longer be suppressed to the Foundation Forging realm. Work hard on cultivating and stepping into higher realms. Long Chen might need us one day!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Lord Heaveneye looked up at the sky, a faint smile on his face.

...

Long Chen felt his feet hit the ground. He was standing in the midst of the original entrance. When he had entered, there had been a sea of people. But now that he was coming out, there were pitifully few people present.

The occasional people that were present all looked at Long Chen like he was a demon and instantly fled.

People appeared one by one. However, Feng Geyin didn’t appear as he didn’t come from this entrance. Of the people that had helped Long Chen, only five had come from this side. After exiting, they waved goodbye to Long Chen.

“Boss, something’s wrong,” said Guo Ran as he looked around.

“Yes, I agree. Why didn’t the various sects send experts to receive us? Did something happen?” Long Chen nodded in agreement.

The fact that Ji Changkong and the others weren’t present was very normal. They had most likely immediately rushed out of the Immemorial Path and fled.

Long Chen had thought that Ji Changkong would ally himself with the various sects’ experts to surround him and attack. But this was out of his expectations.

But the Righteous sects hadn’t sent anyone to receive their disciples. Even Ouyang Qiuyu wasn’t present. That was curious.

“Let’s go. We can ask around once we return to the Xuantian Dao Sect.”

Meng Qi summoned the Redeye Sacred Blood Phoenix. Under her constant care during this time, the Blood Phoenix had broken through to reach the eighth rank.

The eighth rank Blood Phoenix was even larger and faster than before. The three spatial storms they met were easily pierced through.

In just a day, they reached the Xuantian Dao Sect’s territory.

But as soon as they arrived, a loud alert rang out. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s grand protective formation activated, shocking everyone. What was going on?

“Who dares to attack the Xuantian Dao Sect?!” An icy shout rang out from within the formation. A white-robed elder stood within it, staring vigilantly at the Redeye Sacred Blood Phoenix. Although he didn’t recognize it, he could sense how terrifying it was.

Long Chen jumped off and looked inside the formation. There were only six Sea Expansion experts inside that he could see. He frowned. Why were there so few people inside the sect?

Furthermore, he saw that many places showed signs of damage and were in the midst of being repaired. It was like an immense battle had been fought here.

“I am Long Chen. Release the grand formation,” shouted Long Chen. He recognized that person. He was from the Shui family and was at the peak of Sea Expansion. He had once been in the running for the Shui family’s future head.

But this person had repeatedly targeted Shui Wuhen, and in her fury, she had left the Shui family to go to the thirty-sixth supermonastery.

“You... you are Long Chen? Who knows whether or not you’re a fake? This is an extremely tense time, so you can’t enter the sect for now!” he shouted. But he was clearly a bit panicked.

“Courting death!” Long Chen snorted and flew forward. He smashed a single fist onto the grand protective formation, and it shattered.

“Long Chen, are you rebelling-”

Pow!

His reply was a slap in the face. He vomited blood and all his teeth shot out. He fainted.

This was after Long Chen had held back. If he had increased his power just a bit, that old man’s head would have exploded.

“Speak, what happened?” Long Chen turned to look at the other five Sea Expansion experts.

Seeing Long Chen shatter the grand protective formation with a single punch, they were all horrified. One of them hastily said, “A month ago, the Corrupt path gathered all their power and...”

The truth was that a month ago, the Corrupt path had suddenly launched a sneak attack on the thirty-six supermonasteries as well as the Xuantian Dao Sect. This sneak attack was of an unprecedented scale. All the Corrupt path’s elites had moved out.

They had caused heavy casualties to the Xuantian Dao Sect, and the entire Righteous path entered a state of battle. No one knew who would be the next target.

Fortunately, the majority of the thirty-six supermonasteries’ elites had been gathered at the Xuantian Dao Sect. That was a joint agreement between the monastery heads, as they were part of a welcoming ceremony for the sect master.

Ouyang Qiuyu had left for a trip to the Central Plains after sending Long Chen and the others into the Immemorial Path. This was an official meeting that happened once every four years.

The various sect masters would report what had happened during this time, and after that, the head sect would give them various material benefits. That was something very much worthy of celebration to their branch sect.

In past years, there had never been a problem. Only this time did the Corrupt path suddenly launch a berserk attack that caused the thirty-six supermonasteries to suffer tragic losses.

As for the Xuantian Dao Sect, the attack on it had been so fierce that the grand protective formation had been destroyed. Their enemies’ cultivation bases had just been too high.

The vice sect master and Shui Wuhen who had just advanced to Foundation Forging had gone all-out, and only then had they managed to make sure the Xuantian Dao Sect wasn’t completely destroyed.

But the sect had suffered unprecedented damage. The vice sect master had died, and Shui Wuhen had taken heavy injuries under the attack of two Foundation Forging experts.

In that incredibly critical moment, Ouyang Qiuyu had actually returned a day early. When she saw her home was under siege, she had furiously slaughtered her enemies.

The Corrupt path had immediately retreated when Ouyang Qiuyu had arrived. But Ouyang Qiuyu had still managed to slaughter a huge mass of their experts.

Seeing the half-destroyed Xuantian Dao Sect, learning the vice sect master had died, and finding that Shui Wuhen’s soul had been injured and she had descended into slumber, Ouyang Qiuyu had exploded in fury.

She had immediately sent out a call to summon all the Righteous path’s experts to launch a counterattack. But what infuriated her even more was that all the various large sects found convenient excuses not to help her.

She realized these opportunists had decided that the Xuantian Dao Sect’s core had been too heavily damaged by this attack and would quickly collapse. So they didn’t want to get too close to the Xuantian Dao Sect. Even amongst those smaller sects under the Xuantian Dao Sect’s protection, only a few of them supported them with their full power.

Furious, just like that, Ouyang Qiuyu led the Xuantian Dao Sect’s surviving elites and a pitiful number of experts to slaughter a path into the Corrupt path’s territory.

Apparently, Ouyang Qiuyu had attacked three of the Corrupt path’s smaller strongholds, and in the midst of conquering the fourth stronghold, she had encountered a large-scale counterattack by the Corrupt path. Both sides were in a deadlock.

Hearing that Shui Wuhen had been injured, Long Chen immediately rushed to her side. Shui Wuhen was pale and withered, with Death Qi over her forehead. She was pitifully haggard.

When Long Chen arrived, a maid was in the midst of feeding Shui Wuhen medicine with a small spoon. She couldn’t swallow, so she could only allow the medicinal liquid to enter bit by bit.

Long Chen suddenly grabbed the bowl of medicine. He looked at it with a bewildered expression of disbelief. Sniffing it, he shouted, “Who prepared this medicine?!”
