Chapter 3941 Crown Prince

Long Chen truly jumped in shock. Because Yu Qingxuan possessed a top ten Heavenly Flame, the ninth rank Heavenly Rainbow Flame, she was incredibly powerful. With it, even against the likes of Shi Yang, Ji Wuming, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and others, she could hold her ground.

However, in the Vermilion Bird Empire–no, not even within the entire Vermilion Bird Empire, but merely among the princes and princesses, she only ranked ninth. This revelation was truly astonishing.

As if enjoying Long Chen’s expression, Xiao Yong laughed. “Are you shocked?”

“I truly am. I have a great understanding of Princess Qingxuan’s power. As I am not even a match for her, it seems I can only look up to those top nine ranks,” said Long Chen humbly.

This humbleness actually made Xiao Yong feel a bit bad. He thought that Long Chen had received a blow to his confidence, so he hastily said, “Brother Long San, don’t undervalue yourself. For you to be able to challenge an entire city’s experts on your own and make the seventeenth prince of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire beg for mercy, you are definitely a dragon amongst men, a one in ten thousand existence.”

However, when it came to the top nine and what powerful abilities they had, Xiao Yong didn’t say a word. It seemed that he still had some misgivings toward Long Chen.

After chatting a bit more, Long Chen got up and Xiao Yong personally sent him off. He even gave Long Chen a travel permit jade token as his ticket in. In the future, Long Chen wouldn’t have to deal with so many questions at the city gate.

Once Long Chen left, Xiao Yong immediately summoned his personal assistant and gave him orders to report Long Chen’s image to the higher-ups. After all, he needed to alert the higher-ups when a strong expert entered the empire.

If Long Chen had bad intentions, then he would have to take the consequences for letting him through. But by reporting it, he wouldn’t take all the blame.

As Long Chen left the city, he looked at the jade token in his hand with a smile. “This Xiao Yong really is interesting. This jade has a tracking rune inside of it. Is he looking down on me?”

Long Chen directly tossed the jade token away. Although there was nothing wrong with Xiao Yong’s actions, it did make Long Chen feel unpleasant.

As a result, Long Chen didn’t even consider using the transportation formation. He directly summoned his Kunpeng wings and shot away.

As Long Chen soared through the air with monstrous speed, the twisting and warping void created a sensation as if he was using a spacetime channel. Also, long periods of continuous flight had let him become accustomed to this new speed of his.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Over time, the rumbling of his wings and the astral winds they generated gradually subsided. As the resistance lessened, Long Chen's speed steadily increased, allowing him to propel forward with even greater velocity.

It was precisely because Long Chen had been focused on gaining greater control over his wings that the distraction caused him to charge into the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire by accident.

Long Chen was now flying steadily and quickly, no longer subjected to the harsh astral winds that once lashed against his face, making it impossible for him to even open his eyes. Also, he no longer needed to use his dragon blood to protect his body anymore. In the beginning, he had been so unused to his speed, resulting in him crashing into several mountains. Such a high-speed impact wasn’t something that he could endure without the protection of his dragon blood.

As he was accustomed to his speed, his divine sense could now be spread around him, allowing him to see everything in his surroundings. He was no longer flying blind.

“This is just the basic speed of the Kunpeng Void Breaker, still quite a distance away from passing through the void silently. The Kunpeng race’s divine abilities truly are amazing.” Looking at the twisting space as his body rapidly passed through, Long Chen couldn’t help praising the Kunpeng race.

Long Chen quickly arrived at a city. Originally, he had not been planning on stopping, but when his divine sense swept through, he sensed a Huayun auction house inside the city. Hence, he immediately took a break there.

When he revealed his status plate in the auction house, he was immediately given a warm welcome. Long Chen then asked the Huayun Trading Company about the Vermilion Bird Empire’s current situation.

After listening for a bit, he learned that the Vermilion Bird Empire was shockingly powerful. The emperor and his two empresses were actually Earth Venerates that had condensed three flowers.

Also, the Vermilion Bird Empire’s populace was thriving, with countless experts rising each year. The royal family alone had eighteen Double Supreme heavenly geniuses, and every single one of them was a terrifying monster.

This time, when various treasure lands opened throughout the nine heavens, each royal descendant of the Vermilion Bird Empire took charge of leading a group of disciples into the secret realms. Among them, the Pill Fairy led her group into the three thousand worlds. However, as she was not a Double Supreme, the group that she led was comparatively a bit weaker.

It was said that this time, every group had profited immensely from the treasure lands. The royal descendants, in particular, had not only managed to merge the powers of both Supremes but also acquired plenty of priceless treasures. After undergoing a great transformation, these heavenly geniuses skyrocketed in power.

Although Yu Qingxuan was ranked ninth among the royal princes and princesses, the ranking was determined before the treasure lands opened. Also, it was rumored that when the princes and princesses exchanged pointers, the emperor showed favoritism toward Yu Qingxuan. Otherwise, with Yu Qingxuan’s power, it would have been very difficult for her to secure a spot within the top ten.

Yu Qingxuan had been separated from her father and mother since her birth, and the circumstances surrounding their separation remained shrouded in mystery. But upon her return, she was very obedient and didn’t even blame her parents at all, which actually made them feel even guiltier. Thus, they intentionally gave her favorable treatment, allowing her to secure a place within the top ten with relative ease.

Even so, while Yu Qingxuan’s power wasn’t great amongst the royal descendants, they had tested her blood and found that she possessed the purest Jiuli bloodline among them. From this, they knew that her potential was limitless.

Within the Vermilion Bird Empire, the competition between the princes and princesses was extremely intense. They had to constantly display their power and intelligence to prove that they deserved the position of emperor.

On the other hand, Yu Qingxuan had no interest in acquiring this position and preferred a peaceful life. But because she was favored, quite a few princes and princesses were wary of her. In fact, none of the princes and princesses had a good relationship with her.

After hearing that, Long Chen sneered disdainfully, “As expected, royal families are always emotionless. They birth a group of children and then raise them like poison insects, having them fight each other until only one king remains.”

Long Chen very much detested this style of education. Whether it was the Phoenix Cry Empire, the Grand Xia Nation, or even after ascending to the immortal world, all the royal families that he had encountered were the same. There were no familial ties to speak of.

“I have to bring Qingxuan away. Leaving her in this broken family won’t let her feel any warmth,” decided Long Chen firmly. Thinking of how obedient and reserved Yu Qingxuan was, she was definitely being bullied in this place.

After coming to this conclusion, Long Chen directly said goodbye to the Huayun Trading Company’s people. But before leaving, he received a status plate from the Huayun Trading Company. With it, he could freely use the empire’s transportation formations.

Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to ask any more questions after learning about this. After all, he didn’t care about the Vermilion Bird Empire and only wanted to bring Yu Qingxuan away from this quarrelsome place.

With the Huayun Trading Company’s status plate, everything was easier. The Huayun Trading Company had a high status in the Vermilion Bird Empire, so no one questioned Long Chen. He didn’t even have to line up for the transportation formation and was allowed priority usage.

As the transportation formation lit up, Long Chen appeared right outside the capital, Vermilion Bird City. However, he barely had a chance to take in the sight of the majestic ancient city before an irritating noise reached his ears, interrupting his momentary peace.

“The crown prince is coming! Idlers, get out of the way!”

Following that, someone rudely pushed Long Chen back, causing him to frown. However, as he didn’t want to cause trouble, he retreated to avoid that person’s hand.

“Scram further!”

Long Chen swiftly dodged his hand, but it seemed that this person didn’t feel like Long Chen had retreated far enough. Without hesitation, he extended his hand once again, making another forceful attempt to push Long Chen.

Upon seeing this, Long Chen’s anger instantly flared, and he slapped that person in the face.
