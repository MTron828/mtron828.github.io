Chapter 4026 An Immense Battle Starts

Following Long Chen’s shout, that giant Silver Wing Blood Falcon emitted golden light, so bright that it even covered up its silver hue.

After that, people were shocked to see its body starting to inflate, growing larger and larger. The Silver Wing Blood Falcon also seemed to have a bad feeling and opened its mouth wide, as if trying to spit Long Chen out.

BOOM!

However, it was already too late. In a dramatic way, the falcon’s body exploded, unleashing a torrent of astral winds that swept through the surroundings. The ensuing explosion was so powerful that golden light illuminated the entire world.

“Summon the defensive formation!” shouted Zhu Yunwen hastily.

In an instant, the imperial disciples formed hand seals. Although they had been spread throughout the battlefield, they immediately gathered together. After that, the Vermilion Bird barrier enveloped them.

BOOM!

Terrifying essence blood power struck them, and the impact was like a star exploding, blowing their surroundings apart. As for their opponents, they were blown out of existence.

Just like that, an entire capital vanished, along with millions of their experts. The detonation of an immemorial beast was really terrifying.

As the golden light slowly dimmed, Long Chen’s figure appeared.

“How foolish. Did you think that you could touch my dragon king essence blood?”

These words weren’t Long Chen’s, but the dragon expert’s. Clearly, the Silver Wing Blood Falcon’s desire to devour true dragon essence blood was a daydream.

“Little fellow, what do you think? You’re finally seeing the true power of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art!” The dragon expert’s voice contained a touch of pride.

Even Long Chen himself was shocked. He had never imagined that he would one day control such power.

In the Vermilion Bird space, he had no references, so he didn’t know just how high his power was rising. Now, he finally witnessed the difference between the current him and his old self.

“The power is terrifying, but the exhaustion is also shocking. That single attack took thirty percent of my energy.” Long Chen couldn’t help bitterly smiling.

A single eruption of power where he immediately reigned in his aura actually cost him thirty percent of his energy. Based on that, he would probably only be able to maintain his strongest state for a few breaths’ time.

“Your control is too lacking, so the majority of your energy is just canceling itself out. Furthermore, your human race’s bodies aren’t as powerful as the dragon race. The amount of power that you can store is also limited. For you to have reached this extent is already far beyond my original expectations. So, just take it easy. As your cultivation base grows, your physical body will be able to hold more power, and your control will also increase. The strength and time limit will then grow as well,” consoled the dragon expert.

There was no way around it. After all, a human couldn’t grow to nine feet. As for the true dragon race, after becoming dragon kings, they could easily reach a length of thousands of miles. There was no comparison between the two. Even so, Long Chen’s current power was already far beyond the dragon expert’s original expectation.

Suddenly, blood splashed through the air as two swords swiftly swung through the sky. In a seamless and coordinated attack, both Yu Qianxue and Zhu Yunwen struck simultaneously, causing two heads to be sent soaring into the sky.

“Excellent. Three three-flower Earth Venerate heads, two of them being Empire Lords. That’s enough to raise our side’s morale.” Zhu Yunwen smiled excitedly as he held Qin Yu’s head.

However, he quickly saw Long Chen looking at the head in his hand hesitatingly, so his heart sank.

“Brother Long, did I say something wrong?”

“You shouldn’t have wiped out his soul. I was planning on finding out some information.” Long Chen bitterly smiled.

Long Chen felt Weng Taibei to be quite sinister. Perhaps this sinister plot was something only the Empire Lords were somewhat aware of.

When he had slain Lan Tianba, he hadn’t had time to leave him alive. As for Yu Qianxue and Zhu Yunwen, they had attacked too quickly for Long Chen to stop them.

“Ah… Sorry, brother Long. I was too brash,” said Zhu Yunwen awkwardly.

“It’s fine. If he’s dead, he’s dead. They are only following the orders of the Violet Thunderclap Empire, so they might not even be aware of their top secrets. Let’s clean up the battlefield and return to the Vermilion Bird Empire,” said Long Chen.

“Big brother, we were quite fast this time and no one escaped. Perhaps we can do another sneak attack?” proposed Zhu Yunwen.

The others looked at Long Chen with anticipation. They had annihilated two imperial capitals in such a short time, having accomplished something unprecedented in history.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

If they could attack another empire on top of it, their names would go down in history, and it would alleviate the pressure on the Vermilion Bird Empire.

“If we keep launching sneak attacks, the eight empires will definitely fall into disarray. They’ll be afraid of being the next target and be forced to defend. Even if we stop attacking, it will still apply a great deal of pressure on them,” said Yu Qianxue.

In their opinion, as long as the other side wasn’t prepared, even if they couldn’t beat their enemies, they could always run. The fact that they had repeatedly fought three-flower experts had given them a boost of confidence.

Long Chen shook his head. “There will be no other chance. The success of this sneak attack was mostly luck, and news of the Blue Flame Empire should have already spread. Moreover, the eight empires will not be withdrawing to their capitals to defend, as they don’t know our next target. Rather than letting themselves be run wild by us, they will instead launch an all-out assault on the Vermilion Bird Empire. Then we’ll be the ones forced to defend passively. Furthermore, if they are able to somehow calculate where we’re going and ambush us midway, they won’t need much to annihilate us. Just five three-flower Earth Venerates are enough to wipe us out. Further risks now are not worth it when compared to the gains. In order to avoid huge casualties on the side of the Vermilion Bird Empire, we have to immediately return before the eight empires launch their assault.”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s hearts shook. It seemed that they had been thinking too simply.

“There’s another important point. Weng Taibei and Weng Tianyao’s master mentioned something but didn’t explain it in detail. You have to know that enemies you can see aren’t that frightening, but the ones you don’t see coming? That’s the true terror. If we can’t find any clues, we have to prepare ourselves in advance,” said Long Chen.

Everyone nodded. They then cleaned up the battlefield and returned to the Vermilion Bird Empire on their battleships.

In order to avoid them from being blocked by others, Long Chen intentionally took them on a detour. When they reached the border of the Vermilion Bird Empire and saw the destroyed city along with endless corpses, Zhu Yunwen and the others’ eyes instantly turned scarlet.
