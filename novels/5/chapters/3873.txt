Chapter 3862 Unbelievable

“Senior, do you know what called me?” asked Long Chen as he flew.

“I know,” answered the dragon expert lightly.

“Can you tell me?” probed Long Chen.

“If I told you, you’d think that I set it up and accuse me of being bothersome. You might even be such a stubborn donkey that you’d intentionally go against me,” said the dragon expert irritably.

Long Chen was embarrassed but not angered. He knew that this dragon expert’s origins were shocking. Who knew just how powerful it was?

The dragon race was innately prideful. For it to give Long Chen guidance and then get ignored was just too much for it. It was naturally displeased.

“Senior is joking. I actually like to listen to other people’s advice. Listening to others can fill your stomach,” said Long Chen awkwardly.

“Give it up. I understand now. Once you get the bit in your mouth, no one can drag it out. This temper of yours… Although it’s annoying, I like it. Once you decide on something, you aren’t easily swayed. It is a clear and decisive character. Even though you are so foolish that you make my teeth hurt sometimes, most of the time, you are very satisfactory,” said the dragon expert.

“Hehe, this is just me. Mountains and rivers change, but people don’t. Don’t lower yourself to my level,” said Long Chen with a laugh when he heard this. It seemed that the dragon expert wasn’t truly angry.

“Lower myself to your level? Do I seem so petty?” said the dragon expert disdainfully. “I have seen some things, but I don’t want to speak of them. I am disgusted with the human race, but I also don’t understand the human race. Through you, I want to learn why the human race is called this world’s most complicated lifeform, why they possess the power to destroy this entire world. But you, little fellow, you really are a marvel. You can be deathly smart and deathly stupid at the same time. I really can’t understand your human race.”

Long Chen was instantly embarrassed, not knowing if he was being praised or scolded. Thus, he didn’t know how to reply.

Not knowing what to say, Long Chen simply continued flying. His mind then sank into the primal chaos space.

The primal chaos space was thriving. The Moon Trees and Fusang Trees were already three feet tall. Seeing this, Long Chen carefully took out his dagger and cut the sprout of a Moon Tree in the middle, planting its upper half in the soil again.

He found that this half quickly spread roots. The primal chaos space was truly marvelous. Even this worked.

With this, he began to cut the Moon Trees and plant even more of them.

The primal chaos space was filled with life energy, to the point that even legendary trees like the Moon Tree and Fusang Tree were growing at a visible speed.

As for that one corpse he had tossed into the black soil, it still hadn’t changed at all. It was still unleashing an enormous amount of life energy. It was astonishing.

It was also releasing a large amount of primal chaos qi, but this primal chaos qi was absorbed by the primal chaos space itself. It seemed to be undergoing its own silent transformation, but Long Chen was unable to sense what exactly was changing.

The inside of the primal chaos space was growing crazily. The Moon Trees and Fusang Trees were constantly growing, and he continued to plant more of them.

However, after planting more and more of them, he suddenly found that the new sprouts he planted didn’t survive. When he planted one, it rotted and vanished into nothingness.

“What…?”

Long Chen was bewildered. He had never seen such a thing before in the primal chaos space.

“Whether it is the Moon Trees or the Sun Trees, a single world can only have three thousand of each, not one more. This is an inescapable part of the laws of the Grand Dao,” transmitted the dragon expert.

“The laws of the Grand Dao? Three thousand Major Daos? The three thousand worlds? Is there some connection between them?” asked Long Chen, feeling shocked.

“You should slowly research this kind of thing yourself. In this world, many numbers are filled with profundities. Also, the Grand Dao is not something that can simply be spoken of. You should rely on your own comprehension,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded. It seemed that this might touch upon the secrets of the world. The dragon expert also couldn’t explain it too clearly.

Long Chen counted. Just as the dragon expert said, there were exactly three thousand Moon Trees and three thousand Fusang Trees. When he planted another one, it could not grow.

He sighed inside. This world was truly full of secrets. It was like a giant sea, and he was nothing more than a tiny boat on top of it. All of his understanding was nothing more than a speck of water in this great sea. This unknown world was truly mysterious.

The primal chaos space now had three thousand Fusang Trees and three thousand Moon Trees. As they crazily absorbed life energy, they reached a height of three meters.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

They were covered in golden and black flames. Those were the Sun Flame and the Moon Flame. At this moment, Huo Linger had taken the form of a flame dragon and was almost transparent. Clearly, that final attack of hers had exhausted almost all of her energy, and she was in a weak state.

Huo Linger was currently drooling over the Moon Trees and the Fusang Trees.

“Alright, that’s about enough. You can slowly absorb their flame energy to recover. However, you can only absorb a tiny bite from each one. Alternate the ones you absorb so as to not affect their growth. After all, if you leave them healthy, you’ll always have more,” said Long Chen.

Hearing this, Huo Linger was instantly revitalized. She then charged toward one of the Moon Trees and took a bite. As a result, those flames on it instantly dimmed, but Huo Linger’s body actually solidified with that one bite. It could be seen just how beneficial this one bite was.

The Moon Flame was truly powerful. Even in this tiny weak state, it was a fat piece of meat to Huo Linger.

Huo Linger quickly recovered as she started taking bites of the flames. It seemed that after two rounds of all the trees, she would be fully recovered.

The Moon Trees and Fusang Trees were truly amazing. Just their companion flames were already priceless treasures. Even without the mature trees, Long Chen was already profiting from them. This trip to the heavenly tomb had benefited Long Chen immensely.

Thinking of his gains, Long Chen thought of the bronze cauldron. His mind then left the primal chaos space and into his spiritual space.

Within his spiritual sea, the bronze cauldron silently floated before the Divine Gate. It hadn’t changed in the slightest and didn’t give off a single ripple. Long Chen couldn’t even sense any fluctuations from it.

“Curious. Didn’t you accept me as master? Why can’t I sense you at all?” Long Chen looked at the cauldron questioningly. He was trying to commune with it with his soul.

“It’s useless. It is in slumber. The master acknowledgment ceremony was done completely based on instinct. Also, with your current Spiritual Strength, you cannot awaken it. Little fellow, this was your greatest gain this time. Hehe, just wait. It will give you endless pleasant surprises,” said the dragon expert with a laugh.

Suddenly, he heard rumbling ahead, so his mind left his spiritual space. This land was a wasteland, and there were long cracks in the sky like scars from a terrible battle.

Those cracks were filled with tumbling spatial blades. There was also lightning flashing, like the devil’s maw baring its fangs at Long Chen.

“I’ve arrived.”

Looking at these cracks, Long Chen took a deep breath. He then walked into one of those spatial cracks just like that.

“Long Chen!”

The instant Long Chen stepped into this spatial crack, a startled cry rang out. Long Chen then looked toward that voice and quivered. He couldn’t believe his eyes.

“Family head!”
