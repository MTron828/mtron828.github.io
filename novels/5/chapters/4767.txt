Chapter 4756 Meeting Feng You Again

The Dragonblood warriors also looked over and saw a large figure—a beautiful woman a full head taller than them.

“Feng You!”

Long Chen hadn’t expected the excited cry to come from the heroine of the mixed beast race, Feng You.

Feng You was staring at him in disbelief and delight. With flames swirling around her and her phoenix spear in hand, she was leading the mixed beast race’s experts against these devil creatures. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Boss San!”

The mixed beast race’s experts unleashed a heaven-shaking cheer when they saw Long Chen. Despite their short time together, they worshiped him as an idol. It was during their short time together that they came to recognize what a true expert was.

During their time with Long Chen, they had all benefited, and since parting ways, they had missed him.

“We’re going over there!” Long Chen quickly led his group over. The two groups weren’t that far from each other, and with both sides moving closer, they quickly met in the middle.

“Amazing, when did the mixed beast race grow to this level?” Long Chen was shocked to see the mixed beast race now numbered in the tens of millions. He had no idea where they had amassed so many experts.

“The mixed beast race was once fragmented to ensure the survival of some seeds for the future. But now, with the opening of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s gate, we heeded the call of our ancestors from within, and so we have all gathered,” explained Feng You, placing her spear on her back as she spoke, her eyes shining with excitement.

At this time, Bai Shishi came over, dragging Yu Qingxuan with her. Looking at this large beauty, she regarded Feng You with a mix of casualness and vigilance. “And who might she be?”

“Oh, let me introduce you. She is a friend I met on the pathway to the ninth heaven. Feng You possesses the ancient phoenix’s bloodline and is the junior race leader of the mixed beast race.” Long Chen quickly introduced them all. “These are my brothers, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Bai Xiaole, the first captain of the Dragonblood Legion Gu Yang, the second captain Li Qi, the third captain Song Mingyuan, and the fourth captain Yue Zifeng. The brothers behind me are all members of the Dragonblood Legion. Every single one of them is a true warrior whom I can entrust my life with.”

Feng You cupped her fists and bowed toward them, acting very courteous and direct.

“This is Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi. They are my... future wives.” Long Chen suddenly smiled naughtily when he introduced the two of them.

Hearing Long Chen’s way of speaking, Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan instantly went beet red. Though it was the truth, they felt extremely bashful. Yu Qingxuan, in particular, turned as red as an apple. Bai Shishi, while embarrassed, couldn't help but show a gratified smile.

Seeing that expression, Long Chen sighed inside. Bai Shishi was a jealous woman like Tang Wan-er, so it seemed that his way of introducing them satisfied her. If he had introduced her ambiguously, he’d probably have a tough few days ahead.

“How shameless. Marriage is something that requires the approval of the father and mother! How can a marriage be decided by—aiya!” As Bai Zhantang hastily spoke up, he felt a sharp pain on his waist. Bai Shishi had pinched him.

“This is...?” asked Feng You.

“Nothing more than an unskilled worker. You can ignore him,” replied Long Chen immediately.

Feng You stared at him in doubt for a moment before hastily bowing to Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi. “So you are his fiancees! As expected, only two extraordinary fairies like both of you can match an unrivaled hero like Big Brother Long Chen.”

Although she had concealed it very well, a trace of disappointment had flickered in her eyes when Long Chen introduced them. While she could conceal it from Long Chen, it couldn’t escape Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan’s observation.

“Junior Race Leader Feng You, you are an unrivaled hero yourself, one that all women can take pride in. I hope we’ll have a chance to get closer in the future. Perhaps together, we can alleviate some of Long Chen's burdens,” replied Yu Qingxuan with a smile.

“Big Sister, you’re too courteous! I’m still young and immature. I hope to receive your guidance in the future,” Feng You responded with a bright smile, bowing once more to Yu Qingxuan.

Returning the smile, Yu Qingxuan gestured for Feng You to catch up with Long Chen. She then pulled Bai Shishi aside, and Bai Shishi discreetly transmitted, “Big sister, are you not afraid of her shaking your position?”

Feng You’s appearance made Bai Shishi vigilant, triggering her jealousy.

“Foolish little sister, you don’t understand Long Chen enough. When he looks at her, there’s no male-female affection in his eyes. But by showing your hostility so obviously, it will only embarrass him. Also, there’s another issue. What if she does one day become one of us sisters? Wouldn’t your attitude today become a problem?” answered Yu Qingxuan.

Bai Shishi was startled. She suddenly recalled that when she had fallen for Long Chen, Long Chen already had multiple women in his life. However, all of them had been friendly to her when they first met, making her feel welcomed and accepted.

If they had treated her the way she had just treated Feng You, it would have been unacceptable to someone as prideful as her. Thinking of that, she was instantly filled with shame.

“Big Sister, should I apologize?” asked Bai Shishi as she felt conflicted.

“If you were to apologize, wouldn’t it only make things more awkward? Long Chen only views her as a comrade. Don’t worry. There is no problem, so don’t make one,” consoled Yu Qingxuan.

While Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan secretly communicated, Long Chen introduced Feng You to Guo Ran, explaining in detail Guo Ran’s status as a grandmaster forger. Guo Ran was practically preening, standing so straight that he suddenly seemed upright and tall as well.

Feng You looked at Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others worshipfully. Only now did she learn that Long Chen had so many talented subordinates. They were truly a group of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Moreover, when Long Chen mentioned them, his face lit up with pride.

Feng You also introduced him several experts of the mixed beast race. Their ranks had swelled, evident from the array of new faces. They were not short of formidable individuals either.

However, as Feng You started introducing them, a loud sound drew their attention. Lightning erupted from one of the spatial channels, and shortly after, a figure was hurled out, pursued by crackling bolts of lightning.
