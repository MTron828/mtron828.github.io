Chapter 4450 Seven Star Battle Armor vs. Heavenly Doyen Manifestation

CRACK!

The canopy of heaven and earth shattered like thin ice, and its cracks instantly spread, leaving people with no time to react. It happened so quickly that the moment they thought of retreating, a terrifying wave of broken Grand Dao runes had reached them. Those fragments were like sharp blades piercing them, creating a rain of blood and turning some unlucky bastards into sieves.

The Jiang clan’s people were outside the range of effect. Witnessing those experts being torn apart like this, they couldn’t help but gasp.

Fortunately, they had retreated quickly, or they would have faced the same fate. Even Eternal experts were fleeing wretchedly, riddled with bloody holes. Some of them glared at the Jiang clan’s people as the latter had fled without informing anyone else. Observing them smiling in safety, the injured group of experts was incensed.

However, the Jiang clan’s people ignored them and thanked Feng Fei’s vision in their hearts. As for the idiot budding Doyen, he didn’t dare to make a sound.

The distant battlefield was shrouded in clouds, obstructing the view for everyone. However, the surrounding experts refrained from probing with their Spiritual Strength, well aware that such an act was no different from courting death.

Even Eternal experts struggled to discern anything from the battlefield, and only budding Doyens were able to see clearly, owing their great sight to their Doyen aura. With it, they were capable of watching using the vision of the heavens.

Hindered by the lack of clarity, certain Eternal experts sought assistance from these budding Doyens to share their vision. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to see anything.

On the Dragonblood Legion’s side, Xia Chen had long since set up a formation, so they were able to watch the unfolding events.

As Xia Chen's extraordinary formation granted a clear view of the entire battlefield, it felt as if they were physically present at its center. This was a great thing, as Long Chen’s battle served as an exemplary model for the Dragonblood Legion. Although Long Chen never really taught them directly, their fighting style had Long Chen’s shadow within it.

Every single one of them used their advantages to their fullest and absorbed what they needed from Long Chen. Other than Yue Zifeng, everyone’s fighting style bore a seventy to eighty percent resemblance to Long Chen’s.

Therefore, each battle Long Chen engaged in provided the Dragonblood Legion with an opportunity to further develop and refine their skills.

Looking at the battlefield, they saw Long Chen hovering in midair, still in his punching posture with his fist firmly linked to Netherdragon Tianzhao’s. Both combatants mirrored each other’s posture, and their powers intensified rapidly.

Endless ripples emanated from their tightly clenched fists, creating an expanding sphere of brilliant light. When that sphere seemed like it reached its limit, it exploded, causing Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao to retreat.

After retreating, Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, “The heavens follow me! All manifestations support me!”

BOOM!

The giant vortex above Netherdragon Tianzhao trembled, unveiling an array of infinite manifestations—wind, rain, lightning, electricity, spring, summer, autumn, winter. Countless scenes materialized, portraying a spectacle that seemed to encapsulate all the transformations of the world. Netherdragon Tianzhao seemed like a god in control of this world’s laws. If he wanted wind, there was wind. If he wanted rain, there was rain. A single thought from him could summon every manifestation of the world.

His aura skyrocketed exponentially, leaving onlookers in awe. He was already so powerful but was still capable of getting stronger. Now, he possessed enough power to destroy the world.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!” With a roar, seven stars lit up inside his divine ring, blazing like seven suns. A majestic energy then soared into the heavens, enveloping him in a stellar aura as if he were the battle god of the starry sky.

“Monsters!” Startled cries echoed as the observers shook in panic.

The two of them engaged in a furious exchange of blows. With each collision of their fists, the world quivered, and the stars swayed in response. Wild qi waves rippled in all directions, carrying an aura of impending destruction. In just a matter of seconds, the air became saturated with the ominous presence of death and annihilation.

“Heavens! The Heavenly Fiend Prefecture is sinking!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Horror gripped the onlookers as they witnessed the shattering of the laws governing the region, which caused the entire prefecture to sink. Obviously, the impact was so immense that even the surrounding prefectures felt the fluctuations.

“What kind of power is this?!” gasped the horrified crowd. Was this the unimaginable might wielded by a true Heavenly Doyen?

Even the budding Doyens found themselves questioning the meaning of life. If they became a Doyen, would they truly wield such unfathomable power? For them, the power to sink an entire prefecture seemed like an otherworldly concept, leaving them in a state of disbelief.

Meanwhile, the shock reverberated even more profoundly among the new Eternal experts. Standing at the peak of the world, they wielded unparalleled strength, second only to Saints. While they knew that this era wasn’t theirs, they had thought that they still had some time to revel in their superiority. Yet, in this battle, the harsh truth dawned upon them—they were swiftly and entirely surpassed before they could act like some big shots.

The Eternal Experts felt as though this era had callously abandoned them. How could they not? The might emanating from Long Chen and Netherdragon was enough to wipe out entire swaths of them, leaving the once-proud Eternal experts in shock, disappointment, and a sense of profound loss.

“Kill!”

“Die!”

As the two of them roared, their Doyen power and astral energy continued to clash, slowly transforming the battlefield into a no-man’s land.

Unable to withstand it anymore, the Heavenly Daos disintegrated and the very fabric of the world shuddered. Just like that, the Heavenly Fiend Prefecture crumbled into oblivion, leaving behind a bottomless void.

The battle between Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao also reached its climax. One stood as the master of the heavens, while the other held the title of Sage King in command of astral energy.

“Netherdragon Tianzhao is a worthy opponent. In all my years, I’ve never seen someone who can push our boss this far,” Yue Zifeng remarked, his fists clenched as his fighting spirit ignited.

The strength displayed by Netherdragon Tianzhao was undeniable, forcing Long Chen to go all-out. However, neither side was able to suppress the other. This sight was a first for the Dragonblood warriors.

Also, they were fighting head-on, which happened to be Long Chen’s forte. This emphasized the terrifying ability of Netherdragon Tianzhao.

BOOM!

The ensuing explosion surpassed all previous impacts, causing even the Dragonblood warriors to feel as if their insides were being crushed by an invisible force.

“Victory is about to be decided!” declared Yue Zifeng, and the hearts of everyone present tightened in anticipation.
