Chapter 4263: Unmatched Wilde

With a single strike of Wilde’s club, the peak expert of the Six Horn Barbarian Bull race had its head destroyed. This scene stunned countless people. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

That was a peak expert within the demonic beast race, but even such an existence was killed in one blow? Most inconceivable of all, when that club smashed toward it, that expert seemed to have become stupid. It didn’t dodge or defend, simply allowing that club to crush its head.

Wilde suddenly grabbed one of its legs and yanked it, forcibly tearing off a leg and biting it. A large chunk of that bloody leg instantly entered his stomach.

“Yes, bull meat is really good!”

Wilde mumbled as he chewed. After a few more bites, the leg was gone, and he didn’t even leave any bones.

The bones of the Six Horn Barbarian Bull race had runes carved into them, making them incredibly tough, but Wilde’s teeth simply crushed them. That crunching sound was like he was eating deep-fried fish.

After eating the leg, Wilde hung the rest of the corpse on his waist where a leather belt could be seen.

Upon seeing that belt, countless people quivered. It was not a mere belt but rather a dragon's corpse.

Wilde had been slumbering before, so no one had noticed it. But now that he was in his giant form, they saw that a dragon corpse was wrapped around his waist. Furthermore, based on its aura, it was on the level of an innate Heaven Venerate, and it didn’t seem to have died that long ago. Its skin was peeled, turning it into a belt.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

The Heavenly River Blood Crocodile, Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth, and Six Horn Barbarian Bull experts had all turned and fled after Wilde killed that peak expert.

BOOM!

Wilde smashed his bone club down on the Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth expert. This peak expert had charged the furthest in, only to now be fleeing.

Wilde's bone club rapidly closed the gap between them, and the Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth's body quivered. Terror filled its eyes, causing it to lose control over its body.

It felt like some kind of energy had locked onto it, making its blood freeze inside of it.

“No!”

It could only let out a terrified scream, but no one went to help it. Wilde’s bone club smashed down without hesitation.

Just like that, another peak expert was slain. Its head caved in, its golden tusks exploding, while its body twitched a bit before it stopped moving.

Wilde then reached out and grabbed its corpse by the nose, placing it on his waist. Now, he had the corpses of two peak experts on his waist.

Originally, Wilde’s body was about the same size as these corpses. But once Wilde killed them, their bodies shrank until they hung on his waist like rabbits on a normal person’s body.

“What is going on?!” The way Wilde killed two peak experts stunned everyone inside and outside the martial stage.

Killing the Six Horn Barbarian Bull might be attributed to catching it off guard, but slaying the Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth, which was already fleeing for its life, with a single blow was just unbelievable.

People had no idea what was going on. After all, every peak expert had to have some skill. Just what kind of existence was this giant of the Barbarian race?

BOOM!

With a few steps, Wilde crossed thousands of miles, chasing after the Heavenly River Blood Crocodile expert. This expert instantly fled as soon as it saw Wilde. However, when Wilde started chasing it, its body quivered, and its speed plummeted.

“What?!” When everyone saw that, they were shocked.

Wilde’s club fell once more. Just like before, the Heavenly River Blood Crocodile’s protective divine light shattered, and its head exploded.

Another peak expert was slain, and it didn’t have the slightest ability to resist. These three races were instantly crushed by the deaths of their leaders.

Wilde grabbed the Heavenly River Blood Crocodile’s tail and hung it on his waist as well. In the blink of an eye, three peak demonic beasts had been killed.

In an instant, the heavenly genius from Jiang Clan who had wanted to join in as well became dumbfounded. He was now thanking the heavens that he hadn’t done so.

“Demonic beasts, be careful! This fellow might very well be from the legendary descendants of the Barbarian King, the Blood Barbarian race! As soon as he sets his eyes on you, the pressure of the Barbarian King crashes down on you, and your Blood Qi will come to a stop. Also, your runes will lose effect, and you can’t even use divine abilities!” shouted an expert from the demonic beast race.

“Blood Barbarian race? Descendants of the Barbarian King? How is that possible? The Blood Barbarian race went extinct a long time ago. After the final Barbarian King died, there was never any remnant of the Blood Barbarian race!” exclaimed an elder outside of the martial stage.

When it came to these seniors, the majority had some knowledge of history. Moreover, the Barbarian race’s history was no great secret.

The Barbarian race had tens of thousands of branches, and they were one of the strongest races within the nine heavens and ten lands. Uniquely, the Barbarian race’s experts didn’t need to cultivate, and they possessed natural titanic strength. All they needed to do was eat, and their power would grow limitlessly.

The Barbarian race’s experts were natural warriors with unmatched power and defense. They were practically flawless.

As for the Blood Barbarian race, they were the emperor race of the Barbarian race. All branches of the Barbarian race accepted them as their leader and were fully loyal to them.

Unfortunately, in a great battle millions and millions of years ago, all the Blood Barbarian race’s experts fought to the death. Having lost their leader, the Barbarian race gradually declined.

The legends said that while the Barbarian race was powerful, their fatal weakness was their low intelligence. It was all too easy to scheme against them.

Furthermore, the demonic beast race, which had constantly been hunted as food by the Barbarian race, also launched a fierce attack on them. They weren’t a match for the Barbarian race in terms of power, but through scheming, they split up the Barbarian race, crushing them one at a time.

In the end, the Barbarian race’s experts were reduced to the point that they were in complete disarray. It was said that only a few of their branches still survived to this day. The rest had gone extinct.

As for those surviving branches, they went into hiding, not daring to walk in the outside world. However, for the Sage King Convention, they re-emerged, which was already astonishing. What was even more unbelievable was the reappearance of the long-extinct Blood Barbarian race. It left everyone in disbelief.

The Barbarian race didn’t know how to cultivate or use magical arts, so it was impossible for them to seal away any heavenly geniuses. Anyway, it was said that it was impossible to seal them because their physical bodies would wither away and they would die. Sealing them was no different from killing them.

“This is impossible!” exclaimed someone in disbelief.

“The Blood Barbarian race treats all beasts as food! Even the Kunpengs and true dragons are food to them! Anyone whose ancestors were eaten by Blood Barbarians will feel a terror deep in their souls as soon as they’re targeted by Blood Barbarians. This fear becomes a kind of lock when attacked by the Blood Barbarian, and it’s very similar to a bloodline suppression,” said a human expert.

After killing three peak experts in a row, WIlde suddenly spotted a giant black tortoise in the distance. In an instant, his eyes lit up, and he charged over with his bone club.
