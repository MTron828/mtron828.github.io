Chapter 2104 Fighting Shi Lingfeng

A humanoid giant charged through the air like a meteor, and its entire body was blazing with divine light. Shi Lingfeng was attacking.

Shi Lingfeng’s fist came straight toward Long Chen. Hence, people were startled that he would actually attack now. Did he have some kind of relationship with Zhao Wuji?

That didn’t sound very likely. The Stone race had been isolated from the rest of the world. As for the Mechanism Sect, they had also been hiding in their little corner. The location of their headquarters was a secret.

Theoretically, there should be no way for the two of them to have made contact before. Hence, Shi Lingfeng’s attack caught many people off guard.

The lumps on Shi Lingfeng’s body actually opened, revealing diamond-like crystals. When those crystals appeared, the Heavenly Daos rumbled and the earth quivered. A crushing aura rose.

Those crystals were like stars, and as they shone, Shi Lingfeng’s power ignited.

Long Chen felt a suffocating feeling as if some kind of power was crushing him from all directions. It seemed to be some kind of magical art or divine ability.

“Do you want us to take action?” Just at this moment, Beitang Rushuang sent him a message.

“No. Today’s my chance to establish my might. Otherwise, these blind fools will continue targeting me forever,” replied Long Chen.

With a cold snort, Long Chen swung Zhao Wuji into Shi Lingfeng’s fist.

BANG!

Shi Lingfeng’s fist smashed into Zhao Wuji. Zhao Wuji stiffened and then became covered by a layer of rock. He was instantly turned into a stone statue.

Long Chen’s heart suddenly shook, and he hastily pulled back his hand. The stone creeping across Zhao Wuji’s body was rapidly spreading.

Although Long Chen pulled back his hand quickly, he was still affected. A layer of rock was starting to grow on top of his palm. It almost instantly covered up to his elbow.

Long Chen shook his hand, causing the stone to explode. However, once it was gone, it revealed a bloody palm.

This stone was very strange. It had started to bore into his flesh. Without the dragon scales to block it, his arm would have entirely been turned to stone.

“Let’s see how arrogant you can be after I turn you into stone dust.” Shi Lingfeng snorted and swung Zhao Wuji behind him.

After not being in contact with Shi Lingfeng, the stone covering Zhao Wuji dissolved, returning him to his former state. He was actually entirely unharmed.

“Have a taste of my fist!” Shi Lingfeng sent another punch, and the same ancient runes appeared on his fist just like his last attack.

“This is the Stone race’s innate divine ability. Anything that comes into contact with it will turn to stone. It’s very difficult to deal with. Once your hands are turned to stone, you can’t form hand seals,” said someone, sighing.

The Heavenly Daos gave birth to all things, and sometimes they would give birth to some curious and bizarre existences. The Stone race was one such existence. They didn’t have bodies of flesh and blood but still had high intellect and immense combat power. Fortunately, their numbers were low, or the entire world might have been destroyed by them.

“Little pebble.” Long Chen sneered and waved his hand. A flame sphere appeared in his hand, facing Shi Lingfeng’s fist.

BOOM!

Shi Lingfeng let out a grunt as he was blown back. Flames lingered on his fist. It was the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame.

Long Chen didn’t feel any joy after forcing back Shi Lingfeng. Instead, he was shocked. That sphere in his hand had been Star Fall. He had condensed it at high speed, making it extremely berserk. However, it hadn’t destroyed Shi Lingfeng’s fist. It hadn’t even injured him.

At the very least though, the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame was worthy of being the number one Earth Flame. It had blocked Shi Lingfeng’s bizarre divine ability.

Since that was the case, Long Chen was at ease. He stepped forward, flames flowing from his body.

“I’ve heard that your Stone race has unparalleled power. You bragged about your close-range combat skills until the very heavens shook. It seems that all this fame is nonsense though,” mocked Long Chen as he suddenly stamped his foot down at Shi Lingfeng.

That was an extremely insulting attack. If Long Chen didn’t hate him to such an extent, he definitely wouldn’t use such a move.

“Die!” Shi Lingfeng was infuriated. He reached out a hand to grab Long Chen’s foot. As long as he grabbed it, he was confident in pummeling Long Chen to death.

Regretfully, this attack was a fake. Shi Lingfeng’s hand clasped around thin air, while Long Chen dodged him like a nimble fish. When Long Chen was behind him, his foot whipped out at Shi Lingfeng’s neck.

Long Chen’s foot struck his target. The entire world shook, and the immense power caused large spatial fluctuations.

Shockingly, Shi Lingfeng was completely uninjured.

“Bastard!” Shi Lingfeng felt a burst of dizziness from this kick. His body was extremely tough and almost impervious to punches and kicks. But this attack still infuriated him. His hands reached for Long Chen.

Evilmoon once more appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and he repeatedly slashed it at Shi Lingfeng. However, all that happened was that a few sparks flew, and a few marks appeared on his body. Those marks also quickly faded.

“Your broken saber is barely an itch,” sneered Shi Lingfeng, repeatedly attacking Long Chen with his fists.

Long Chen sneered inside. Evilmoon was still in slumber. Once it awoke, he would see if this idiot could still be so arrogant.

However, he was truly stunned by Shi Lingfeng’s body. It was hard and tough. That wasn’t a power that stone should possess.

Suddenly, Shi Lingfeng was slapped in the face. Long Chen cursed inside as he felt a biting pain on his palm from how hard his face was.

However, this slap was effective in fully provoking all of Shi Lingfeng’s rage. Blood runes swirled inside his eyes, and he suddenly clapped his hands together.

“Seal the Heavens, Lock the Earth, Stone Entraps All Life!”

The crystals on Shi Lingfeng’s body unleashed rays of divine light. The earth exploded, and one giant boulder after another came flying out.

Those boulders smashed into Long Chen and Shi Lingfeng. The void rumbled as more and more of them gathered. In just a moment, they had formed a giant sphere of stones trapping the two of them inside.

The giant sphere continued to compress and grow as more boulders flew into it. Everyone’s hearts shook at this terrifying move. All the stones within tens of thousands of miles had been called over.

They had long since heard that the Stone race had the ability to control all the stones beneath the heavens. As long as the earth was not destroyed, they possessed limitless power.

Furthermore, the speed at which Shi Lingfeng had completed this move was truly shocking. Before anyone could react, Long Chen and Shi Lingfeng had been trapped within that stone sphere.

The stone sphere was irregular at the start, but then runes appeared on top of it, and the surface became smooth and glossy.

Seeing that perfect sphere that was thousands of miles thick simply stunned people. It was like a star floating there.

Runic chains came shooting out of the bottom of it, extending all the way to the top and binding it.

When those chains finished binding the sphere, startled cries rang out. That giant sphere actually instantly shrank to just three hundred meters.

Ye Lingshan and the others’ hearts clenched. Could a physical body really endure that much pressure? For the sphere to compress so much in an instant, other than Shi Lingfeng, anyone else would be crushed.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the sphere exploded, revealing Long Chen wrapped in flames. Those flames formed the shape of a giant lotus around him. He was completely unharmed, but with his body covered in flames, it was hard to see his expression.

As for Shi Lingfeng, he had been forced back. He was shocked. Just as he had thought that he could kill Long Chen with this move, Long Chen suddenly erupted like a volcano. His flame energy had caused his divine energy to go into disarray. He didn’t have a chance to unleash the final killing move of it.

His body still wrapped in flames, Long Chen shot after Shi Lingfeng. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

BOOM!

Shi Lingfeng recovered from his shock and unleashed a powerful punch, while with his other hand, he slapped his own chest, causing all his crystals to light up.

“Have a taste of this attack!” shouted Shi Lingfeng.

“Have a taste of mine instead...”

A voice rang out beside Shi Lingfeng. A hand silently came from a strange angle, striking his eye.

As for the Long Chen that was wrapped in flames, he exploded from Shi Lingfeng’s punch. It was only now that Shi Lingfeng realized it was a fake. By that time, his eye had already been carved out by the real Long Chen.

“AHH!” Shi Lingfeng let out a heaven-shaking roar. He swung his arm behind him but missed. Long Chen was already floating in the sky, holding a glimmering gemstone.

“Long Chen, I’ll exterminate your whole race!” Having one of his eyes stolen, Shi Lingfeng howled furiously. His crystals actually split open, like every one of them was an eye. A kind of forbidden energy began to condense.

“Then I’ll just exterminate you first.” Long Chen formed hand seals. Thunder clapped and lightning raged behind him.

“The great era has come, but no Sovereign has appeared. If we fight amongst ourselves, all the lives of the continent will be in danger. Are the two of you trying to get the continent destroyed?”

Just at this moment, a calm voice rang out. Everyone hastily looked over to the source.
