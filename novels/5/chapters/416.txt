Chapter 417 Disturbance

Translator: BornToBe

As Long Chen began to refine Bone Tempering Pills, news of him killing Han Tianfeng spread throughout the entire Jiuli secret realm. T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

Han Tianfeng was the brother of the Xuantian Supermonastery‚Äôs number one expert Han Tianyu. He was also called a peak expert, someone who could be counted amongst the top ten of the entire Righteous path here.

Even in the Corrupt path, he was someone very well-known, and he was even listed on their must-kill list. However, he had ended up being killed by Long Chen.

If it wasn‚Äôt for that video of his head flying through the air, no one would have believed it. It was just too shocking.

At the same time, people were finally starting to care about Long Chen‚Äôs name. The only reason they had heard of Long Chen before was because Han Tianyu, in the name of the first monastery, had put out a warrant for him. At that time, most people had assumed Long Chen must have offended some powerful figure or had angered Han Tianyu by fighting over some treasure.

After so much time had passed without any further news of Long Chen, people had all assumed he had already died.

But after several months, Long Chen had reappeared. With an early Tendon Transformation cultivation base, he was able to fight two of the strongest experts here, Han Tianfeng and Yin Wushuang.

The two of them had both reached the Bone Forging realm and were incredibly powerful. But they had only been able to miserably block Long Chen‚Äôs attacks for a moment before being defeated. If Yin Wushuang hadn‚Äôt reacted quickly, she probably also would not have been able to escape death.

Originally, Long Chen‚Äôs name was only famous within the 108th monastery. But after killing Han Tianfeng, his name resounded so loudly that there were few within either the Righteous or Corrupt path who did not know of him.

There was no way around that, as Long Chen was just too domineering. In only the early Tendon Transformation realm, he had killed a top expert like Han Tianfeng that had reached Bone Forging. It was impossible to forget him even if you wanted to.

At the same time, quite a few people had come to realize the entire sequence of events that had led to this. It wasn‚Äôt hard to notice that Long Chen was being targeted by someone.

As soon as he entered the secret realm, there were people wanting to entrap him. As for now, Long Chen was finally no longer enduring it. He had used Han Tianfeng‚Äôs head as a declaration of war.

‚ÄúThis time it‚Äôll be much more lively.‚Äù

People couldn‚Äôt help sighing emotionally. Han Tianyu was the Xuantian Supermonastery‚Äôs number one genius, and within the same realm, he stood at the peak of the martial path. He had never once suffered a defeat in his life.

Now that someone had killed his little brother, no matter for what reason, it was impossible that he would let the killer off. And so now, Long Chen and Han Tianyu were truly mortal enemies.

‚ÄúThis Long Chen is truly looking to die. Just who does he think Han Tianyu is? Does he think just because he was stronger than Han Tianfeng, that he can defeat Han Tianyu as well? Han Tianyu is on a completely different level, and Long Chen will definitely not be able to escape death.‚Äù There were many people within the monasteries that sneered inside about Long Chen‚Äôs fate.

There was not a single person who looked favorably on Long Chen‚Äôs odds. That was the case despite the fact that he was able to fight against Han Tianfeng and Yin Wushuang at the same time.

Although people often grouped them together, calling them top or peak experts, there was still a huge power difference within the same level. For example, the power difference between various Favored was so great that people differentiated the stronger ones as Chosen. In truth, they were essentially the same.

The main difference was that in order to reach the level of a Chosen, most Favored needed to be groomed by their sects. Only by maintaining a perfect and undefeated battle record, and thus possessing a powerful will, would they reach that level. That will was something that allowed them to suppress their fellow Favored.

As for Han Tianyu, he could similarly suppress all those within his generation. There were none who could contend against him, and so in many people‚Äôs eyes, Long Chen‚Äôs death was inevitable.

Over the past few days, there were quite a few people who had gathered around Compass Mountain. They wanted to confirm whether or not the stories were true.

When the first portion of people arrived, they saw that there were two large tents set up on Compass Mountain. The ground was also a complete mess with bloodstains everywhere. That was enough proof that there had been an immense battle here.

It was identical to the photographic jades. As for a certain place, they saw a very eye-catching bloodstain. That was where Han Tianfeng‚Äôs head had been cut off.

However, now his corpse was no longer present. It was unknown whether it had been taken away by others or eaten by Magical Beasts.

Within one of the tents, Long Chen‚Äôs pill furnace was shaking intensely, and a dense medicinal fragrance floated out.

Once he completed the refinement, he revealed nine shining medicinal pills that had a halo of light around them.

‚ÄúBoss, you really are amazing. That‚Äôs another full furnace of high grade pills.‚Äù Both Guo Ran and Gu Yang were filled with praise.

A full furnace was a term for pill cultivators referring to a furnace containing the absolute limit of nine medicinal pills. But the odds of a full furnace was extremely, extremely low. Refining just five or six pills in one furnace was already very good. The rest was usually just pill dregs.

Furthermore amongst those five or six pills, their quality was not usually equal. Some tended to be trash pills or low grade pills. For an ordinary Pill Master, when they attempted to refine a high grade pill, it would be a great success if a single pill in that furnace managed to be high grade. The normal standard was one high grade pill, two middle grade pills, and the rest was either low grade or trash pills.

This was all common knowledge that even Guo Ran and Gu Yang knew. But Long Chen‚Äôs success rate when refining had completely toppled their understanding.

They had already watched him refine thirty-nine furnaces of pills, and each time it was a full furnace. There were only two times when a middle grade pill popped in. The rest were all high grade.

Even having personally seen it over thirty times, they were still filled with shock and were unable to believe it. They looked at Long Chen like he was a freak.

Long Chen just smiled slightly. These were not even his own accomplishments, but all thanks to his Pill God memories and the violet flame. It wasn‚Äôt something to be proud about.

The only regretful thing to him was that his current pill furnace was absolute garbage, and he didn‚Äôt dare use his full strength when refining. His pill furnace wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle the full power of his flame and would explode. Otherwise, he would be able to refine ringed high grade pills, which were the pinnacle of the high grade classification. The medicinal effect would multiply.

It had to be known that once a pill‚Äôs medicinal essence had reached the level of a high grade pill, each little further advancement in the pill‚Äôs quality was very difficult. But at the same time, each little advancement would make its effect multiply, and its price would soar by the dozens.

This was also a reason why Long Chen could let everyone undergo complete tempering.

After running into Bai Ling and learning about the Huayun Sect, his mood had become much more enlivened. He had such powerful alchemy arts, but he hadn‚Äôt been able to use them much. Now he was thinking of collaborating with the Huayun Sect. He could use his alchemy arts to exchange for even more cultivation resources in a mutually beneficial way. Both sides would profit greatly.

Furthermore, from Bai Ling‚Äôs gratefulness and worship of the Huayun Sect, he could tell that it was a pretty good existence. Although it seemed more like a business, they were very fair. Within the cultivation world, just how luxurious was fairness?

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just stare. They‚Äôve cooled down enough to be thrown into a bottle.‚Äù The two of them were still looking at the pills in the furnace with an intoxicated expression, so Long Chen prompted them.

Even as he said this, he was already preparing a second furnace to continue refining. He was refining while switching between two furnaces to give them time to cool down. If he repeatedly refined without that step, it was more likely to cause cracks in the furnace. There was no way around that, as his pill furnaces were really just absolute garbage.

For higher grade pill furnaces, their quality improved the more they refined pills. It was like a stir-frying food pan. The more you cooked with it, the more savory the stir-fry would become.

However, Long Chen didn‚Äôt have such a thing, and so he could only do his best to get the most out of his few pill furnaces. He had no way to get more here, and so each one that was ruined was permanent. If he ended up with excess ingredients but no usable pill furnace, he would be screwed.

‚ÄúBoss, there are quite a few people in the distance watching us sneakily. What should we do?‚Äù asked Guo Ran as he carefully placed the medicinal pills into a bottle.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to bother with them. If they dare try to provoke us, just directly kill them,‚Äù said Long Chen as he refined.

‚ÄúKill them just because of a provocation?‚Äù asked a stunned Guo Ran.

‚ÄúYes. Provoking us now is different from normal times. If they were to provoke us, they definitely have some goal, and they most likely were sent by our enemies. Just kill them all.

‚ÄúRight now, Meng Qi and the others are in the other tent, doing their best to absorb the energy from the Bone Tempering Pills. Although being disturbed won‚Äôt bring any danger, it will slow down their rhythm.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to waste on that. Each little bit of growth will give us a greater chance of survival in the upcoming battle.

‚ÄúSo if they provoke us, it‚Äôs no different from stabbing us with their blades. Whether they actually have any hostility against us or not, kill them all.‚Äù

Long Chen was currently rushing to increase everyone‚Äôs strength as much as possible. He wasn‚Äôt hoping that they would be able to help him with anything, but just that they would have a greater chance of surviving. The scene he dreaded seeing the most was each of them dying in front of him.

In truth, Long Chen was also a bit nervous. From his conversation with Mo Nian, Mo Nian had said that Han Tianyu was even more frightening than Yin Luo.

Although the two had not fought yet so there was no way to be sure, Mo Nian said that he felt a kind of terrifying threat from Han Tianyu. He had also heard that Han Tianyu had found some amazing treasure in the secret realm and was in seclusion, attempting to refine it. It was unknown just what that thing was.

That filled Long Chen with a sensation of crisis. If he was on his own, then if he couldn‚Äôt defeat Han Tianyu, he could at least flee. But what of the people by his side?

His enemies were all contemptible and shameless. Long Chen had already personally experienced their lack of morals. He needed everyone by his side to have the ability to defend themselves before he could fight with his heart at ease.

When it came to a one on one fight, although Han Tianyu seemed to have gained some treasure, Long Chen was not the slightest bit afraid of him. The greatest danger was being too afraid of an enemy to fight.

Only once everyone‚Äôs strength had risen could Long Chen dare to go all-out in a battle to kill as many as possible. He had the confidence to kill Han Tianyu.

‚ÄúAlright, then Gu Yang and I will go out to keep watch. Gu Yang, you‚Äôll be the obvious guard. Go protect the tent with the sister-in-laws. As for me, I‚Äôll be the hidden guard. However, the ground around here is all bare and there‚Äôs nowhere good to hide. I think I‚Äôll set up another tent and lie in wait there, hehe‚Ä¶‚Äù Guo Ran laughed, but his laugh contained an indescribable wretchedness.

‚ÄúDo whatever you like. Just remember not to disturb us.‚Äù

‚ÄúHehe‚Ä¶‚Äù

Guo Ran laughed mischievously. Since Long Chen didn‚Äôt warn him about anything, he left with Gu Yang. Seeing a few distant spies, he immediately hid himself. Boss really was right. Just from how sneaky they‚Äôre acting, they‚Äôre definitely not some good people. And since they‚Äôre not good people, it‚Äôll be easier to handle them.

Following Guo Ran‚Äôs plan, Gu Yang obediently sat in front of the tent that the four women were secluded in. They were busy absorbing the Bone Tempering Pills‚Äô energy, and had already begun the bone tempering process.

As for Guo Ran, he set himself up in a small tent. From the outside, the only thing that could be heard was some light ringing. It was unknown just what he was doing inside.

At the beginning, those spies didn‚Äôt do anything. But as time passed, more and more people arrived. There were now hundreds of people present, and there were even several Chosen.

‚ÄúLong Chen, you perverted traitor, get the fuck out here!‚Äù Suddenly, a loud shout shook all of Compass Mountain.
