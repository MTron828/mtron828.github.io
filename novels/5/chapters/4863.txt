Chapter 4852 Unable to Bear a Single Blow

“You damn trash, I definitely possess the essence blood of the Immemorial Blood Crocodile! Just die!” Cao Shaoqing gritted his teeth, his face contorted with fury as if he had gone insane. Long Chen’s words had dealt a devastating blow to him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He couldn’t accept that his most prized attribute—the Immemorial Blood Crocodile’s essence blood—was just a huge joke. Even an ordinary person would struggle to accept such a revelation, let alone a pampered heavenly genius like him.

BOOM!

Blood-colored divine radiance erupted from the giant head of Cao Shaoqing’s manifestation, and the flames around him grew explosively, covering the entire martial stage.

Even through the barrier, people could feel the terrifying heat scorching their skin. They couldn’t help but wonder. Was this really not the Immemorial Blood Crocodile’s might? If it wasn’t, how could its power be so great?

Cao Shaoqing landed on the martial stage, transforming into multiple figures as he shot toward Long Chen.

When Mo Nian saw this, he simply shook his head. “Idiot.”

“What is it?” asked Lu Ziqiong.

Cao Shaoqing was attacking Long Chen from eight different directions, with each clone having identical aura and spiritual fluctuation—an extremely high-level technique. However, Mo Nian simply scoffed at it, baffling Lu Ziqiong.

Most people, when faced with attacks from all eight directions, would instinctively focus on defense until they could identify the true body among the clones. However, Long Chen swiftly targeted one of the figures and unleashed a powerful kick.

With an explosive sound, the other seven figures vanished as the true Cao Shaoqing was accurately struck in the chest, causing him to bend nearly in half as he was sent flying backward, crashing into the martial stage’s barrier.

As Cao Shaoqing crashed into the barrier, the distinct sound of bones breaking echoed through the arena. He then rolled down, in so much pain that he was unable to utter a sound.

“What?”

The spectators were baffled. Was this person really the Iron Blood Gate’s Cao Shaoqing? It seemed that he wasn’t as strong as what the rumors said. How could he not retaliate at all against Long Chen?

“This idiot’s body-splitting technique would at most be able to trick novices. Trying to trick people like us who have been through a trial of blood and fire? What an idiot,” remarked Mo Nian, shaking his head.

Mo Nian had never expected Cao Shaoqing to bring out such a lousy technique. Even in his injured state, Mo Nian would be able to crush Cao Shaoqing with a single hand, let alone Long Chen.

Seeing Yu Tong, Yu Fei, and the Lu sisters staring at him in shock, Mo Nian was speechless. He finally realized that these people had spent their days too peacefully. While having immense power, they had no true killing prowess.

At first, Long Chen and Mo Nian had been full of expectations for this battle. However, the opponent was nothing more than a flashy exterior with no substance inside.

Long Chen walked toward Cao Shaoqing. With every step he took, the air of death in the surroundings grew; his steps were like the overture of death.

Cao Shaoqing rose to his feet, still completely shocked by Long Chen's power. Even wearing the Blood Soul Battle Armor hadn't spared him from injury.

Gao Jianli’s expression also changed. At this moment, he wasn’t even interested in mocking Cao Guofeng and instead felt uneasy.

The Yellow Spring Pavilion and Heaven Heart Hall’s leaders were also taken aback. Their surprise didn't stem solely from Long Chen's power, but rather from the fact that he had yet to reveal the slightest opening.

After all, they were different from Cao Shaoqing, having gone through their own share of bloodshed. In order to reach their position, they had crossed mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

What shocked them the most was how natural every single one of Long Chen’s movements appeared. Even they were unable to find any openings in his techniques. In contrast, Cao Shaoqing seemed to be riddled with openings despite wearing the Blood Soul Battle Armor, unable to fully utilize its defensive capabilities.

Most terrifying of all was Long Chen's uncanny ability to exploit Cao Shaoqing's openings. When Cao Shaoqing laughed, causing the battle armor to instinctively contract at the front, Long Chen seized the moment and struck his face with a slap. It seemed as if Long Chen could predict these reactions, timing his attacks perfectly.

Long Chen's precise control was evident in how he exploited the Blood Soul Battle Armor's defensive mechanism. When he kicked Cao Shaoqing, his foot targeted the area where it was most challenging for the battle armor to absorb the impact. The second kick was even more deceptive. It appeared as one attack but in reality delivered two powerful blows. The tip of Long Chen’s foot triggered the armor's defensive mechanism, but then his heel descended at precisely the moment when Cao Shaoqing's defenses were weakest, resulting in Cao Shaoqing coughing up blood.

This level of mastery was what distinguished novices from experts. The majority of the Divine Venerate disciples, including Lu Ziqiong, Lu Ziyu, Yu Tong, and Yu Fei, didn’t even understand what had just happened. Only the old fellows had seen through Long Chen’s techniques.

This was why Cao Guofeng stood tensely. Such fine control was beyond even an elder like Cao Guofeng, who had lived for countless years, yet Long Chen executed it effortlessly.

“It looks like Cao Shaoqing is done for,” said Gao Jianli as he saw Long Chen walking toward Cao Shaoqing. He should have been happy, but now he felt a cold chill on his back. He suddenly asked, “Did you send the report?”

“I sent it a long time ago,” answered his vice palace master, startled.

“Ah, fine. Once the wood has been turned into a boat, it can’t become a tree again. We can only leave it as is,” sighed Gao Jianli.

At this moment, Gao Jianli felt a bit regretful as he had severely underestimated Long Chen. Offending Long Chen was an unwise decision. If Long Chen died, it would be fine. However, if he didn’t, the Violet Palace Sect would never be able to rest easy ever again.

According to Gao Jianli’s estimation, Long Chen’s power should only be one level above Cao Shaoqing’s. Hence, even if he defeated Cao Shaoqing, he would need to unleash his full power. Unexpectedly, even without revealing his real skills, Long Chen had beaten Cao Shaoqing so badly; their power disparity was immense.

Although Long Chen had yet to reveal any shocking techniques, his fighting style alone revealed him as an expert who had walked out of a bloody battlefield. There was no comparing him to greenhouse flowers like Cao Shaoqing.

Even if both of them were evenly matched in terms of power, or even if Cao Shaoqing was one level stronger, Cao Shaoqing would still die at Long Chen’s hands.

Quite a few glances from the onlookers turned toward Cao Guofeng. They wondered if he would just watch as his own descendant was slain.

“You bastard, did you think you could defeat me, Cao Shaoqing?! You’re too naive!”

This furious roar drew their focus back to the martial stage. Cao Shaoqing was now holding a divine weapon and pointing it at Long Chen. When the onlookers saw that divine weapon, their pupils shrank.
