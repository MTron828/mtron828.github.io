Chapter 2717 Beat Out Your Bull Ball

The Central Plains Cauldron appeared above Mo Nian’s head and unleashed a ray of divine light that shattered the large hand.

That brief delay was all it took for the Dragonblood warriors and the Mo family’s disciples to flee back to the Martial Heaven Continent.

Mo Nian suddenly raised the Heaven Seizing Sun Hunting Bow. A ray of light shot out through the sky of Resentful Death City.

The light exploded above the city like a beautiful firework, illuminating the world.

“Bastard!”

Countless furious roars suddenly rang out from within Resentful Death City. Countless experts in seclusion were startled awake by this arrow. Mo Nian’s attack had caused the laws of this world to become chaotic, forcing these experts in seclusion to wake up from their cultivation state.

“The human race’s Mo Nian is here! Continue what you were doing! I’ll be back later!” Mo Nian’s voice resounded throughout Resentful Death City, but he himself was hiding within the Central Plains Cauldron and flying back to the Martial Heaven Continent.

“Perfect!”

Mo Nian and Gu Yang high-fived when he returned. The two of them laughed at the success of this sneak attack.

They stood guard outside of the entrance to the Corrupt God Cemetery. According to the High Priest, the worlds had not fully linked up, so old monsters from those worlds would be suppressed if they set foot onto the continent, resulting in them not daring to do so. Otherwise, if they were to face the High Priest or Daoist Heavenly Feather, they wouldn’t even have a chance to run.

“Bastard human race, none of you will be able to cultivate like this either!” shouted the Undying race’s experts.

“How laughable. You were the ones who wanted to play. We’re just accompanying you. What, you don’t like playing this way?” Mo Nian eyed those experts disdainfully.

“Stop spouting crap and fight!” Gu Yang was even more direct, pointing his spear right at them.

Resentful Death City was now fully linked to the Corrupt God Cemetery, so the Corrupt God Cemetery could already be considered the outer region of Resentful Death City. Furthermore, Resentful Death City was not the same as when Long Chen had seen it. It was now connected to several other worlds and was even larger.

However, no matter how large it grew, it was not fully merged with the Martial Heaven Continent. Those experts on the level of living fossils would be suppressed by the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent. As long as they didn’t come, Gu Yang and the others had nothing to be afraid of.

“Hmph, little rabbits, why don’t you try coming in again?” A dark-faced, almost skeletal elder appeared within the Corrupt God Cemetery. This was precisely the old monster that had previously fought Sovereign Zi Yang. He was an extremely terrifying existence.

“Old calf, why don’t you try coming to our side? Let’s see if I can beat some bull balls out of you!” cursed Mo Nian.

Bull balls? The elder was first confused, but he quickly realized what Mo Nian meant, and fury filled his eyes. However, he suddenly laughed, “Ignorant brat, the day that I set foot on the Martial Heaven Continent, you will regret coming to this world.”

“Who do you think you are? Come over right now and let’s exchange three hundred blows!” Mo Nian aimed his bow at the elder.

Of course, Mo Nian didn’t dare to challenge such a terrifying monster. That was an existence that had even fought against Sovereign Zi Yang.

The Sovereign Zi Yang of that time was not the Sovereign Zi Yang that had appeared in Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation. It was the true Sovereign Zi Yang that stood at the peak of the martial path. In terms of true strength, the current Mo Nian didn’t match a single pinkie from this old monster.

Even if the continent’s laws did suppress him when he came over, Mo Nian would still be forced to flee.

However, if he really did come, then the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the others would immediately sense him and take action to slay him.

“Three hundred rounds?” The elder laughed as if he had heard the biggest joke in the world. It had to be known that back then, he had fought Sovereign Zi Yang for three days and nights before he was defeated. Mo Nian was so unashamed as to say he would fight three hundred rounds with him?

“Do you not have confidence in lasting that long? Then how about ten exchanges? If you haven’t lost in ten exchanges, I’ll let you escape with your dog life. What, you don’t dare? Fine, I won’t use my hands or feet! I won’t use my soul! I won’t use magical arts! Do you dare?” provoked Mo Nian.

“No hands, feet, soul, or magical arts? Then what are you going to use to fight him?” asked Gu Yang.

Mo Nian chortled, “Just look at how terrified he is. I’ll take off my pants and use my life rod, and he’ll flee.”

“Die!”

Suddenly, the void exploded. That old monster was finally provoked and attacked.

However, the instant he entered the Martial Heaven Continent, Mo Nian and the others were shocked to find that the world was frozen. Some terrifying power froze time and twisted space.

Before Mo Nian could even understand what was happening or what kind of power this was, a withered claw reached toward his throat.

But just as the claw was about to reach him, the twisted void split open, and cold light slashed out, severing the elder’s hand.

The elder’s expression changed, and he waved his staff with his other hand. The three skulls on his staff glowed, forming a brown bridge above his head.

BOOM!

The bridge exploded and a sharp sword slashed down, striking his staff. A tempest containing the laws of multiple worlds erupted.

Mo Nian, Gu Yang, and the others were sent tumbling back by that tempest. Mo Nian was the closest and ended up hacking up blood, his body cracking.

Mo Nian was about to curse the Central Plains Cauldron for not protecting him just now, but then he saw the Central Plains Cauldron grow and block the entrance to the Corrupt God Cemetery. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

A sword slashed down from the heavens and cosmos. It seemed to contain countless stars.

“A sword cultivator?”

The elder’s expression changed once more, and he slammed his hand on the ground, which then wrapped around him like a blanket.

As for the three skulls on his staff, they changed color, shining golden light on the earth around him.

The earth instantly solidified, becoming a giant shield of immortal metal.

“What kind of technique is this?”

Mo Nian and the others were stunned. This was no illusion. He had really turned dirt into immortal metal? Was there really such a heaven-defying ability in this world?

At this moment, the sword slashed onto the giant shield. Shockingly, this immortal metal was like tofu in front of the sword and was cleanly cut in two. The sword-light then struck the elder.

The elder seemed to have been expecting this and was murmuring some kind of incantation. His staff then grew larger, blocking the sword.

BOOM! The elder coughed up blood, which instantly transformed into black qi.

After that, the elder snorted and waved his staff once more. A hole opened in the void, and he jumped in.

BOOM!

However, just at this moment, a giant cauldron came flying out of the hole that he made, knocking him out.

The elder had just flown out when a sword slashed down. The elder was slashed apart.
