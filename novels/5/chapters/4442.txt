Chapter 4431 Kill Him

To Long Chen’s surprise, three people in that group had the aura of a Heavenly Doyen. Two of them matched the strength of Netherdragon Tianye, while the one in the middle was a fair-skinned man with a subtle divine light trailing behind his head. Astonishingly, his aura surpassed that of Netherdragon Tianye by manyfold.

When he appeared, Long Chen and the others sensed a change in the Heavenly Daos. These three figures stood like towering trees, their crowns eclipsing the sunlight, emanating an overwhelming presence that cast immense pressure over the surroundings.

“Wenyu, let me introduce you. This is Long Chen, the person I mentioned earlier. Long Chen, meet Jiang Wenyu, our Jiang clan’s number one expert in the junior generation,” said Feng Fei.

“I’ve long since heard of your great name, Brother Long. Now that I’ve seen you in person, you really live up to your reputation.” Jiang Wenyu cupped his fists to Long Chen and smiled slightly.

Jiang Wenyu’s movements resonated with the heavens, and even a single greeting from him seemed to contain the essence of the Heavenly Daos.

“Brother Wenyu is too courteous. It seems that Brother Wenyu is going to become a Doyen at any moment. I’ll congratulate you in advance here.” Long Chen also cupped his fists toward him.

“These two are also my Jiang clan’s heavenly geniuses…” Feng Fei was about to introduce the other two, but the two of them simply cupped their fists to Long Chen and walked away, embarrassing Feng Fei.

Seeing the flames of anger start to appear in her eyes, Long Chen smiled and congratulated her. “The Jiang clan has produced some real talent this time. Congratulations.”

“Brother Long, I pray for your victory today. I won’t disturb your preparation any longer.” Jiang Wenyu cupped his fists to Long Chen again and left.

The rest of the Jiang clan left with him. Although Jiang Wenyu had said his greetings, his gesture clearly lacked sincerity. For him, this was simply a formality.

“I’m sorry. I was…” Watching as they left, Feng Fei let out a long sigh.

“Are you tired?” asked Long Chen.

Feng Fei was startled and looked at Long Chen. Looking into his eyes, she found that the person who understood her best was actually him.

“I’m tired. But what can I do about it?” Feng Fei smiled bitterly.

She was truly exhausted. No one had ever acknowledged her efforts, leaving him feeling like she was very pitiful sometimes.

However, she couldn’t do anything about it. She was a member of the Jiang clan and had to work for their glory. Hence, she was doing her best to create a good relationship between the Jiang clan and Long Chen, but there were just too many people in the clan who despised her.

Amongst the junior generation, many youngsters felt her to be too soft and not fit to be a leader. Hence, when Jiang Wenyu and the other two geniuses emerged, her position plummeted.

If it weren’t for the support of the Jiang clan’s patriarch, perhaps no one would even pay her any attention. She felt very bitter inside.

However, with a single question, Long Chen almost made Feng Fei tear up. Only Long Chen understood her pain.

“Do you still not understand? No matter how strong a person is, they can only look after themselves, and you can only help those who trust you. A clan has its own destiny, and if it is fated to decline, it’s going to be very difficult for you to stop it yourself,” explained Long Chen.

“Difficult doesn’t mean impossible. Some things only have meaning because of their difficulty. Since I am a daughter of the Jiang clan, and the Jiang clan has given me so much that I cannot repay them, I have to protect the Jiang clan even at the cost of my life. I’m sorry for today’s embarrassment. I hope you won’t mind.” Feng Fei forced out a smile, barely concealing the tears on the verge of falling from her eyes. She then bid her farewell and departed.

Watching her leave, Yu Qingxuan said, “She has a long vision, and she’s also stubborn.”

“Sometimes long vision isn’t a good thing. If you can see the result but are powerless to change it, it’s a terrible torture.” Long Chen shook his head.

In truth, Feng Fei had done her best to build a good relationship between the Jiang clan and Long Chen. Even if they weren’t friends, they shouldn’t be enemies.

Having seen Long Chen’s growth step by step, she had a kind of strange confidence in Long Chen. She felt like he would definitely reach the peak of this world.

She believed that anyone who dared to block his way would be crushed by him, and she didn’t want the Jiang clan to become one of those obstacles. Also, it seemed that only Long Chen could understand her.

Long Chen was someone who believed in reciprocating kindness and avenging enmity. Recognizing his principles, Feng Fei had made repeated appeals to the higher-ups to assist Long Chen. If they couldn’t make him owe them a favor, they should at least foster a good relationship with him. However, her pleas fell on deaf ears.

As for Long Chen himself, he had faced danger on numerous occasions and managed to survive each time. At times, the Jiang clan wouldn’t even need to take direct action. Just by showing up, they would be able to form a good relationship with him, but they refused to listen to Feng Fei’s plan.

Although Feng Fei had the patriarch’s support, the Jiang clan had many important decisions that required the council’s approval. If a proposal failed during the discussion, then Feng Fei would be powerless to change it.

This time, she had arranged for Jiang Wenyu to meet Long Chen to build a good relationship between the Jiang Clan and Long Chen. While Jiang Wenyu did give her some face, the other two intentionally disregarded her, leaving her extremely displeased.

This proved that the Jiang clan was an enormous existence, and its interior was extremely complicated. It seemed like no clan or sect could escape being entangled in such complex political dynamics.

“Long Chen, why did you come so early? Have you come to check the terrain and prepare yourself? Do you not have the confidence to win?” At this time, a sinister voice rang out in the distance.

Hearing this, the Dragonblood warriors were incensed. However, their anger wasn't directed at the person’s words but rather at his status.

This person was a human. While they didn’t know what faction he was from, his potent aura marked him as a budding Heavenly Doyen, so he couldn’t be a nameless figure.

However, despite being from the same race, this person was trying to disturb Long Chen. He was quite malicious.

Guo Ran was about to curse back when Long Chen stopped him, shaking his head. “He can lack a brain, but you can’t. If you start cursing him, it will only make the world laugh at you.”

First of all, ignoring whether or not Guo Ran could beat this person in a cursing competition, even if he did win, he would still be a laughingstock. The experts from other worlds would simply see it as dogs biting each other.

Guo Ran clearly hadn’t thought that far, which enraged him even more. Being cursed at without retaliating was something he couldn't tolerate.

Just like that, Long Chen and his companions ignored that guy, but he didn’t stop. “What? Cat got your tongue? The youngest Dean of the High Firmament Academy, the Sage King of the Sage King Convention, are those titles just for show? How about I see whether or not you really have the qualifications to represent the human race? If you can’t even beat me, then you should just scram. Otherwise, you’ll bring shame to the entire human race.”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This person went even further this time. He wanted to fight Long Chen? Just what was he thinking?

“Courting death!” exclaimed Guo Ran, his temper flaring alongside the rest of Long Chen's companions. This person really liked to play with fire.

“Either don’t attack or go for the kill,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Hearing that, Guo Ran and the others directly smiled. Bai Xiaole swiftly formed hand seals, and three flowers swirled in his eyes.

“What? You don’t dare to, is that it? Then- courting death!”

Seeing Long Chen’s lack of response, this person was about to keep provoking him when the space around him twisted. He was sucked into a spatial vortex.

BOOM!

People heard a furious shout from that guy as the spatial vortex shattered. To his surprise, he was no longer in his original location and had been transported right in front of the Dragonblood Legion.

“Kill him!”
