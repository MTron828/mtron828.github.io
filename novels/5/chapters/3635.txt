Chapter 3624

The Alldevil Star-Field’s situation was growing increasingly tense, so everyone was wearing their battle armors at all times. Even some elders with one foot in the grave had taken out the old battle armors they had used back in the day. They already prepared themselves for another battle.

Also, the various powers had taken out all their battleships. No one dared to hold back in the slightest at this time. They had a total of eight hundred thousand battleships, which had been distributed into proper ranks.

Three hundred million warriors were gathered. Originally, Xue Yifan wanted Long Chen to give them some simple training so that they could cooperate in battle. After all, there were so many of them that it was all too easy for them to end up fighting chaotically.

Surprisingly though, Long Chen refused. He said that he wanted to focus all of his energy on training the starry river warriors. They would be the main force in this battle.

Almost five hundred and fifty thousand people had awakened the starry river manifestation, and those capable of drawing in astral energy into their bodies numbered three hundred and sixty thousand.

Long Chen ordered Guo Ran and the others to help those disciples forge their own Starry River Battle Armors. He also told the starry river warriors that they were the main force in this battle, and they had to be mentally prepared.

The only gratifying thing was that the battleships that they had stolen from the Luo clan could mostly be directly used. The Qingying Battleships in particular were only lightly damaged. With just minor repairs, they could be used. Now, the Qingying Battleships became one of their strongest weapons.

“Everything is going too quickly. If we were given just another year, or even half a year, we wouldn’t fear anyone.” The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, as well as the other elders, were with Long Chen. Watching as everyone worked hard, the patriarch sighed.

“And why would we have to fear anyone now though?” Long Chen smiled.

“Dean Long Chen, are you really so confident?” asked a half-step Divine Venerate.

“Of course I am confident. Remember, when the human race’s hearts are united, there is nothing that they can’t do. The history that big brother Xia Guhong went through last time will not replay. This is what it means when the waves wash away the sand, leaving behind only the gold. Battle is like a magic mirror that reveals all the ghosts and monsters. Unrivaled heroes are born through destiny, rising like clouds above the world. As the times change, the only ones capable of leading an era are heroes. Those that can spill their blood and sacrifice their lives to protect the people, those that can forget death on the battlefield and slaughter their enemies, are all heroes. We have so many heroes on our side. We will definitely win this battle,” said Long Chen with utmost confidence.

“When it comes to heroes, dean Long Chen is the real unrivaled hero. You and Xia Guhong are both heroes of our Alldevil Star-Field,” praised the patriarch of the Celestial Essence Sect.

The patriarch felt utmost reverence for Xia Guhong, and Long Chen’s display made him feel like he was seeing Xia Guhong from all those years ago.

Long Chen shook his head. “Those that can fight together on the battlefield are all called heroes. Only I don’t count.”

“Why is that?”

Long Chen smiled. “Because other people set foot onto the battlefield knowing that they will die but are still fearless. That’s a hero. But I don’t believe that there’s anyone capable of killing me on this battlefield.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

His tone was very flat, but it was overflowing with a heroic and arrogant feeling. Even so, this arrogance was actually very heartening to everyone. This was the confidence of a supreme expert.

In the past few days, Long Chen had stopped training. Instead, he focused on maintaining a calm heart and watched as Guo Ran trained the starry river warriors.

“Report!”

“The Alldevil race’s army has appeared! They have not gone to the Celestial Essence Domain or the Heavenly Dragon Domain. Instead, they are coming directly for the Magnificent Heaven Domain. It is estimated that they will arrive here in just six hours.”

A scout came to give a report. Their enemies had already reached their surveillance area.

Six hours… Hearing this, the entire people in the city tensed up and they turned a bit pale. This battle would decide all of their lives. Naturally, they were nervous.

“The whole city will enter the highest level of alert, and the formation is also to be activated. Battleships, get in line! Prepare for battle!” shouted a half-step Divine Venerate. After that, an alarm blared. Everyone once more checked over their equipment and got into position.

The three hundred and sixty thousand starry river warriors quickly got into position as well. Their movements were clearly a bit messy, and some people even took the wrong place in their nervousness. They blushed, wishing to find a hole to bury themselves in.

Upon seeing this, Guo Ran’s expression wasn’t very good. He was about to chide them when Long Chen stopped him. Long Chen smiled and said, “This isn’t something to feel bad or embarrassed about. Seeing you, it feels like I’m looking at my brothers back in the day. I remember when I started training, I also cried for my father and mother. Don’t think that Guo Ran looks so illustrious now. Let me tell you, back then, he was the one crying the worst.”

“Boss, can you give me some face?!” cried Guo Ran.

The starry river warriors laughed. They couldn’t imagine someone as powerful as Guo Ran having such a side, so they instantly felt much better inside.

“Experts are all weaklings who grow stronger step by step. No one is born strong. To tell the truth, this battle is coming too quickly, and it’s not giving you time to grow. Every single one of you still has immense potential to grow. However, this is nothing to complain about. You’ll find that this world will never give you enough time. If this world gives you time, you’ll slack off and won’t have a sense of urgency. You’ll be satisfied with just getting by. Think carefully. Weren’t you slacking off back then? Did you feel like your days were very relaxed? Do you now regret wasting so much time and energy? If you were working this hard back then, then even if you didn’t reach the level of Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others, you wouldn’t be that far from them, right? If you had known that the Alldevil race’s army would come for you sooner, would you have cultivated like you had before? Unfortunately, this world doesn’t have so many ifs. Thus, I can tell you that experts are existences that are forced to appear. Growth is accompanied by pain and injury, life and death. An expert must walk the path of tempering through fire and blood, of struggling through endless pain. Right now, all of you are walking the path of experts. Furthermore, experts have no room to retreat. They can only advance forward…”

Just then, the world shook and the devil qi gushed toward them from the distance like a tide. The Alldevil race’s army had yet to even arrive, but their devil qi was already reaching these experts, covering the sky.

“The path of an expert has no shortcuts! Don’t be afraid on the battlefield because you will see me right at the front!”

Long Chen was already walking out of the city. He appeared outside the defensive formation.

“Starry river warriors, assemble! Today, we will kill them until the world flips. We’ll use the fresh blood of the Alldevil race to dye our land!” shouted Guo Ran.

“Kill!”

Three hundred and sixty thousand starry river warriors roared along with him and charged out of the formation. Following that, the battleships rumbled behind them. Millions and millions of warriors came out of the barrier.

Just then, an endless army of devil beasts appeared. They were like millions and millions of roaring mountains.

Long Chen instantly spotted the Alldevil Tianye at the front. He suddenly stamped on the air, shooting out like a bolt of lightning. Traversing a space of tens of thousands of miles in an instant, all on his own, he charged into the Alldevil army.
