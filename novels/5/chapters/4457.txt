Chapter 4446 Crazy Bloody Battle

“What?!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

People were horrified. Had the two of them gone insane? To fight inside that black hole, were they not afraid of being torn apart?

Even if those terrifying spatial blades couldn’t kill both of them, once they were sucked into the depths of the black hole, they would never be able to leave.

In front of their disbelieving gazes, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao charged into the black hole, continuing their frenzied battle. In an instant, countless spatial blades cut them. However, the two continued to fight fiercely, their techniques sharp and bloody. With all the dust and rubble in this world being drawn into the black hole, the battlefield was cleared, making it easy for the onlookers to see everything.

They could see every single one of Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s moves, along with the spatial blades cutting across them. The splashes of blood they caused were also visible in vivid detail.

“You’re only a little human! Having absorbed a tiny bit of dragon blood, do you really think you are part of the dragon race? Today, you are definitely dead! No one can act arrogant in front of the nether dragon race!”Netherdragon Tianzhao unleashed over thirty consecutive attacks as he spoke.

“True, I only have a trace of true dragon essence blood, but even that is superior to the diluted garbage blood of a mixed breed. Is it fun to slap your own face like this?” retorted Long Chen.

While fighting each other, they dodged the spatial blades and also dealt with the black hole’s suction force.

To still be able to fight so intensely in such circumstances showed that they were true experts. Here, they couldn’t pull any cheap tricks.

Long Chen’s words were like poison arrows piercing Netherdragon Tianzhao’s heart. Every time he cursed Long Chen, he ended up at a disadvantage. However, if he didn’t say anything at all, he felt like he would explode.

Humans had consistently been regarded as low-tier lifeforms in the eyes of the nether dragon race. However, the humans they had always looked down upon were still alive after engaging in prolonged combat with their heavenly genius.

The two of them continued to roar and fight inside the black hole. Their dragon claws were like blades tearing through their flesh, as they seemed to be fighting without regard to their own safety. While covered in blood, they still continued this crazy battle.

They looked like they could die at any moment, whether at the hands of their opponent, the cutting spatial blades, or the eternal pull of the black hole.

When everyone had distanced themselves far enough to escape the influence of the black hole's suction, they turned back to watch in horror. These two combatants were not only powerful but also displayed ruthless determination. In such a situation, an ordinary person’s mental state would have likely crumbled long ago.

The Jiang clan’s experts watched the battle while occasionally glancing at Feng Fei. Now, they understood how right she was.

The two budding Doyens who had snubbed Long Chen before didn’t even dare to make a peep now. They dared to look down on Long Chen? Now, they understood how laughably childish their actions were.

Jiang Wenyu was shocked and overwhelmed with regret as Long Chen's strength far surpassed his expectations. Even if he managed to achieve the status of a true Doyen, he realized he wouldn't be qualified to look down on Long Chen

If he had simply listened to Feng Fei and lowered his attitude enough to express his goodwill, while the two might not have become true friends, their relationship would not have been bad either.

Alas, he had only given Long Chen a simple greeting that lacked any warmth, so it went without saying that in the future, Long Chen would not care about him at all. At most, Long Chen would treat him with the same indifference.

Back then, the Jiang clan’s patriarch had solemnly told Jiang Wenyu that the future clan head would be chosen based on vision rather than just power, cautioning that this quality held greater significance.

Feng Fei’s recent actions showed just how sharp her vision was. Regrettably, the others, including Jiang Wenyu, failed to comprehend this and even engaged in arguments with her.

“Sorry.”

Jiang Wenyu looked at Feng Fei and spoke up rather helplessly.

Hearing this sudden apology, Feng Fei was startled, but she quickly understood what he meant.

“Perhaps many things are like what Long Chen said. At most, I can only change my own fate, not other people’s.”

Feng Fei always had a good understanding of Long Chen. As she knew his character, she always wanted to develop a good relationship between Long Chen and the Jiang clan.

Nevertheless, wanting to form a close relationship with Long Chen was not so easy. Supporting him with something useless? He would look down on such a thing.

Yet, a cautious clan like the Jiang clan would never go to Long Chen’s aid when he needed it most. They were not inclined to take uncalculated risks. Thus, despite Feng Fei doing her best, Long Chen’s relationship with the Jiang clan remained awkward—not quite enemies, yet far from friends.

The Jiang clan’s Eternal experts let out a sigh as well. Feng Fei’s vision was really beyond some people in the clan. However, her word didn’t truly matter yet.

“Race leader, Tianzhao, he…”

The nether dragon race’s experts also grew anxious as the battle progressed to this point.

“Don’t worry. Tianzhao won’t lose. In fact, the stronger Long Chen is, the happier we should be,” said the race leader confidently.

He had absolute confidence in Netherdragon Tianzhao. Others were worrying for his son, but he was filled with excitement.

Netherdragon Tianzhao's inability to subdue the small trace of dragon blood in Long Chen's body served as additional confirmation of the race leader's hypothesis.

The battle raged on within the black hole for the duration of an incense stick burning. Gradually, the black hole started to contract, intensifying the suction force at its center and causing the spatial blades to become even more chaotic.

Covered in bloody cuts, the two continued their relentless assault on each other, displaying astonishing stamina. Netherdragon Tianzhao and Long Chen were undeniably genuine experts, with the former being the first awakened Doyen and the latter hailed as the Sage King of the human race. These achievements were not mere coincidence; they were the results of genuine hard work and perseverance.

There were many potential Doyens here. However, in all their lives, they had never experienced such a dangerous battle before.

As the hopes of their families and sects, from the moment they were born, they were protected. Hence, even their so-called “risky adventures” were still within a certain limit of safety.

For many of them, they had never experienced what it meant for their life to be in danger. After all, the elders behind them did not dare to let them truly have a life-and-death trial.

Watching Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao fight fearlessly, they fully understood the difference between them and true experts.

“The hole’s about to close! Are they still not coming out?!”

Finally, a person couldn’t help but shout. At this point, the hole was only a few miles wide.
