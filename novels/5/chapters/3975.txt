Chapter 3964 An Ant Calling Itself an Elephant

“Walk over my corpse? Hahaha! That’s the funniest joke I’ve ever heard! You really think that you can do that?” The red-haired man laughed, his voice full of disdain. “You don’t even have a Supreme aura, so what could you possibly do? Hmph, I’ll see if you have the ability to receive the princess’s favor.”

“Some people are so foolish because they don’t know just how much power they have. How can an ant appraise the power of a dragon? Should a greenhouse flower that hasn’t even set foot on a true battlefield be so arrogant? If you were just arrogant, then I wouldn’t care. But why must you try to humiliate me? You have no respect in your heart. Is it because I’ve been too nice lately? Remember my words: it is better to bully arrogant people than to offend nice people, because once nice people are angered, they won’t even give you a chance to kneel and beg for mercy,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen had slaughtered too many lifeforms in the three thousand worlds, so he knew that his dark energy was starting to get riled up again. It was growing even faster than he had expected.

As this dark energy severely affected his emotions, he wanted to retain his rationality and calm at all times, not letting that tyrannical qi affect him. Otherwise, his temper would get more violent, and he would be easier to anger. Also, the more he got angry, the more it nourished his dark energy. Sooner or later, he would be consumed by his other self.

Thus, Long Chen had been planning on peacefully accompanying Yu Qingxuan in the Vermilion Bird Empire this time. He wanted to distance himself from killing and fighting, letting his heart settle down for a bit.

However, when he arrived in the Vermilion Bird Empire, he faced all kinds of provocation that he was fed up with. This person even went further, instantly causing Long Chen’s killing intent to explode.

“A dragon? Hahaha! What ignorant arrogance! Just try to receive this attack!”

With a hearty laughter, the red-haired man's manifestation burst into existence, radiating an untamed aura that surged with unparalleled power. In an instant, the might of a Supreme Bone and Supreme Blood exuded from him.

His aura was instantly unleashed to his peak, causing a powerful pressure to crash down upon Long Chen. When this happened, the surrounding buildings unleashed a light barrier around this place. Clearly, this place was set up for fights.

“You have Supreme Blood and a Supreme Bone, but there are no signs of them merging. Your confidence is misguided.” Long Chen instantly saw through this person’s power.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This person’s aura was ancient, so he was most likely a sealed expert. But curiously, the aura of his Supreme Bone and Supreme Blood was stiff, which meant that either he had been sealed for too long, or there was a problem with his seal. Although he had gone through the nourishment of primal chaos qi, he still couldn’t merge them.

In other words, he would be stuck like this for the rest of his life, as he had lost any chance of merging his Supremes.

“Bullshit!” After the red-haired man roared, two streams of energy poured into his spear. Before this, he had been holding back a bit, but now he fully unleashed his power as he had already decided to kill Long Chen.

“Don’t!”

Over ten experts appeared in the surroundings at once. They had just been in hiding to watch the fun, but seeing the red-haired man actually intending on killing Long Chen, they were shocked out of hiding.

They were all Yu Qianxue’s guards, powerful experts in their own rights. As experts, they had their own pride.

Hence, when they learned that Yu Qianxue had actually wagered herself against Long Chen and been rejected, they were all shocked. At the same time, they were also envious.

Moreover, Yu Qianxue had even used a scheme to con Long Chen into becoming her subordinate, so these guards were immediately interested and wanted to embarrass him to prove that he was nothing special.

Also, they had discussed the plan already. They were only going to show Long Chen that he was nothing special, not actually harm his life. Otherwise, the princess would punish them severely.

However, the red-haired man was too jealous and was rather eccentric. Also, due to losing his chance to merge his two Supremes, his temper had not been good lately. Thus, when Long Chen’s words antagonized him, he just wanted Long Chen dead. Sensing the serious exchange, those people immediately came out. None of them would be able to escape responsibility if Long Chen was really slain.

However, it was too late. The red-haired man’s spear had reached Long Chen.

Just as everyone thought that Long Chen would be severely injured, Long Chen’s hand lightly wrapped around the spear, catching it just like that.

After that, the ground quivered slightly and a qi wave blasted out in every direction. Long Chen’s hand was wrapped around the spear head, and he wasn’t moved in the slightest. In fact, it didn’t seem that a single hair on his head was moved out of place.

“What?!”

Seeing this scene, all the experts present were stunned. Although this red-haired man wasn’t the strongest out of all of them, he was definitely not bad. How could his full-power attack be caught so easily? Barehanded? They couldn’t believe this.

Just like them, the red-haired man was also shocked. His aura then raged as he tried to pull back his spear. But no matter what he did, he was unable to move his spear. It was like it had stuck to Long Chen’s hand.

“Have you considered my words?”

Long Chen looked at the red-haired man emotionlessly, akin to a god looking at an ant with clear disdain.

Upon being underestimated like this, the red-haired man’s face twisted with fury. The next moment, his body suddenly lit up as flames burst out of him.

“Hu Ming, have you gone crazy?!” Those guards all cried out in shock.

To their surprise, Hu Ming was igniting his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone to increase his power.

This had been nothing more than a test to put Long Chen in his place. How had it become like this? Now, everything was out of control.

However, no matter how the red-haired man’s power rose, he was still unable to pull his spear out of Long Chen’s hold.

Suddenly, the spear moved, but it wasn’t because the red-haired man had succeeded in pulling it out. It was Long Chen shoving it forward.

As a result, the base of the spear pierced the red-haired man’s chest, causing his aura to plummet. The sharp pain woke him up, and now, there was no longer any fury in his eyes, only fear.

“I admit defeat…” said the red-haired man.

“I told you not to provoke nice people, or they wouldn’t even give you a chance to kneel and beg for mercy.”

Long Chen raised the spear, lifting the red-haired man’s body into the air. His voice was icy without the slightest emotion.

“You’ve already won! Stop!”

The guards immediately rushed over to stop him, with some attacking him while some moving to pull the red-haired man away.

“Scram!”

With a roar, a vague dragon cry reverberated throughout the world, accompanied by the eruption of a sacred energy. They all saw a soundwave spread.

After that, all of them felt like a hammer had struck them. Blood sprayed out of their mouths, and even the formation shielding this area shattered, transforming into millions of runes that dissipated back into heaven and earth.
