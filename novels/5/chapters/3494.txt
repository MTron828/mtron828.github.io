Chapter 3483

Long Chen stared at the ferocious sea demons and found that these sea demons had some differences compared to the sea demons he had encountered before.

Within the same realm, they were definitely stronger than the sea demons he had encountered in the seventh branch academy. They had runes flickering over their bodies and were capable of unleashing various divine abilities.

The sea demons back then mostly used their bodies to fight. But these sea demons could use special attacks.

Water arrows and divine light mixed, whistling toward the boat. Their power could not be underestimated. Furthermore, the runes on the sea demon’s bodies would flash, growing dark and then bright, which surprised Long Chen.

“They’re capable of absorbing the energy of heaven and earth to fight?”

It had to be known that the sea demons he had encountered would need to go back to the deep sea to replenish their energy once they had used up the energy in their bodies.

However, these sea demons actually knew how to absorb the energy of heaven and earth. That was somewhat similar to human cultivators. It seemed that the sea demons in different domains had different cultivation styles.

Within the boat, everyone was hiding in fear. Only Long Chen was standing at the front, staring calmly at those sea demons.

When they got closer, they unleashed huge waves as they charged at the boat. Their gazes were cold and emotionless. They were eyeing the people on the boat like sharks that had smelled blood.

Many sea demons ate humans, not due to the little bit of flesh on their bodies. It was for their essence, qi, and spirits.

If demonic cores were treasures to the human race, then the human race’s people were like spirit pills to demonic beasts. Consuming humans would bring great benefits to them. The stronger the person that they consumed, the more beneficial it was.

The experts could not see the end of these sea demons within the dark night. In the sky, in the water, all they saw were sea demons. They roared as they charged at the boat.

BOOM!

Countless runes lit up on the boat, making it blaze as brightly as the sun. It illuminated the night sky. In that instant, everyone despaired, as the light revealed sea demons as far as the eye could see. The entire space around them was packed.

“Brazen sea demons, you dare to block the boat of my Soaring Dragon Company?! Be slaughtered!” An ancient voice snorted coldly.

The boat shuddered and countless rays of sword-light shot out, piercing through the sea demons. Following that, brown runes appeared on their bodies. It was like they were covered in dust. After being pierced, those sea demons were quickly killed.

“Earth subdues water. The Soaring Dragon Company has plenty of experience against them.” Long Chen didn’t have deep knowledge of formations, but he could see that the boat’s attacks contained earth element runes. As for these sea demons, ninety-nine percent had water attributes. So, with the elemental suppression, these runes were no different than poison to them.

After that, the slain demonic beasts’ cores were affected by some kind of power and flew out of the corpses, landing within the boat.

This boat actually had a hunting ability. Other than gathering fees for carrying people, they could also conveniently do some hunting, making more money.

Long Chen saw that while these sea demons were numerous, there were no true experts amongst them. A few of the strongest ones were only half-step World Kings. They couldn’t threaten the boat.

At this point in time, Immortal King corpses were no longer very useful to Long Chen. His primal chaos space was already packed with demonic beast corpses of this level or more.

That was the result of the last battle. The majority were half-step World King existences. Just half a month ago, the Wood Foundation Divine Trees had reached their limit.

As for the Devil Eye Water Lilies, he was raising ten thousand of them, and they had all reached the third tier. Not only did they give him the seeds that he needed, but their life energy also couldn’t be underestimated. These ten thousand Devil Eye Water Lilies gave him just as much life energy as half of the Wood Foundation Divine Trees.

Long Chen had a stockpile of corpses just in case he ended up exhausting a huge amount of life energy in battle. Then these corpses could save his life.

Long Chen was originally hoping to gather some corpses when the sea demons appeared. After all, the boat was discarding the corpses after taking the demonic cores.

However, these sea demons were too low level. They were useless to the current Long Chen. After advancing to the Divine Lord realm, the primal chaos space had once more grown, and so had his appetite. The life energy of an Immortal King corpse was nothing to him now. Thus, Long Chen wasn’t interested in these corpses.

Seeing that the Soaring Dragon Company’s people were very calm despite the barrage of sea demons, everyone gradually relaxed. They came forward and also began to examine the sea demons.

After all, this was the devil sea, and the sea demons here possessed a fierce devil qi. Just getting close to them could count as tempering their wills.

Now, the deck was packed with people. Long Chen had been watching for a while and didn’t see any powerful sea demons appear. Feeling bored, he retreated to rest.

On the other hand, Bai Fang and Bai Rui knew that this was a rare opportunity, so they continued to closely examine the sea demons on the deck.

Long Chen was originally going to tell them to stay beside him, but after thinking about it, it wasn’t as if he could look after them for a lifetime. They also needed to get stronger.

The flying boat continued moving and killing for three days. The killing was done entirely by the boat’s formation. They forcibly slaughtered a path through the sea demons. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although it cost a great deal, the gains were immense as well. Long Chen estimated that the Soaring Dragon Company had made an astonishing sum in these three days.

Furthermore, they were businessmen and they knew how to use money properly. They would turn this money into even more money.

On the third day, Long Chen noticed that Bai Fang’s expression was strange. He asked, “What is it?”

“Nothing. I just feel a bit lost. These sea demons are already so terrifying. Once we reach the Violet Flame Heaven, the competition will probably be even fiercer than before.” Bai Fang forced out a slight smile with a complicated expression.

“There’s no need to be so pessimistic. There are good people and bad people. The important thing is how to differentiate them. Once we get to the Violet Flame Heaven, I’ll see if I can use some connections to get you a place to rest,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Long Chen was planning on leaving this brother and sister to the Huayun Trading Company. Both of them were kindhearted, and he trusted that the Huayun Trading Company wouldn’t reject them.

Bai Fang hastily thanked him. However, Long Chen still felt like there was something strange in Bai Fang’s gaze. But he didn’t ask.

Three days later, the water became pitch-black. Most importantly, it was no longer still. Long Chen could feel it slowly moving as if there was a black pond flowing within the sea, separating two worlds.

Suddenly, Long Chen felt a sense of danger. He hastily walked out of the hold of the boat and concentrated his gaze. He then saw a shocking sight. Far in the distance, there was a giant whirlpool that was like a gaping maw devouring the world. This giant boat was as tiny as a speck of sand compared to it.

Upon seeing that giant whirlpool, Long Chen felt a chill. An intense sensation of danger welled up within him.

Long Chen was about to warn the Soaring Dragon Company’s people about that whirlpool when he suddenly saw a pair of eyes staring at him. That was the elder of the boat. He currently had a sinister smile on his face.

“Not good!”

Long Chen was startled. Suddenly, the middle and low levels’ runes lit up. Long Chen was involuntarily transported out. Furthermore, the direction he was transported out to was the heart of that whirlpool.
