Chapter 2655 Gate of the Heavens

Ye Ming didn’t even look at Jiang Wuchen. “Someone who had his leg cut off isn’t qualified to speak to me.”

Jiang Wuchen’s expression sank. The humiliation of having the Alldevil Heavenwalker cut off his leg was his life’s greatest humiliation. Even Ye Ming was insulting him.

“Don’t be brash. Save your energy. When the final wave of the tribulation comes, we’ll have to go all-out.” Feng Fei pressed a hand against Jiang Wuchen who was about to explode.

Only then did Jiang Wuchen snort and shut his mouth. Feng Fei turned to Long Chen.

“At this time, we should be united.”

Long Chen looked at Feng Fei. “Is that earnest?”

Feng Fei nodded. “Yes.”

Long Chen also nodded and turned away. However, he sent a secret spiritual message back to her. “In a bit, when I tell you to leave, make sure to leave the core of the tribulation. Otherwise, don’t blame me if you die.”

Feng Fei was startled. However, she didn’t express any shock outside.

Long Chen then turned to the Pill Fairy, who hadn’t just come by herself. She had also brought Wan Qing.

It had been a long time since he had seen Wan Qing. She was even more beautiful than before, but her face was a bit pale. When she saw Long Chen, her eyes reddened. She wanted to cry, but she endured it.

Long Chen coldly said to the Pill Fairy, “You shouldn’t have brought her.”

“Why not?” said the Pill Fairy indifferently.

“Because she will see something that she doesn’t want to see,” said Long Chen gloomily. His disappointment in the Pill Fairy was growing greater and greater. He even found her contemptible now.

The Pill Fairy eyed Long Chen. “Oh? Perhaps you’re overthinking it. I don’t need to use my little sister to kill you. I might be a divine daughter, but I still have affection. I won’t harm those that I love. I brought her here to gain a touch of the Martial Heaven Continent’s karmic luck. If I die, she will be able to stand on her own two feet. No one will be able to bully her.”

“Big sister…” Wan Qing choked down a sob. The sight that she didn’t wish to see the most was appearing. She didn’t want to see Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan fighting each other. That was the cruelest thing in the world to her.

The Pill Fairy patted her gently and then returned to Long Chen. “Go ahead with your tribulation in peace. I won’t kill you in front of Wan Qing. But if you are killed by others, I will personally take the karmic luck pearl. If you don’t want Wan Qing to see you die, work hard on surviving instead of shouting at me.”

The Pill Fairy brought Wan Qing to the edge of the core region, expressing her position.

“What an arrogant woman. I like it…” The Nine-Headed Lion’s gaze lit up. He stared at the Pill Fairy.

“Scram!”

The Pill Fairy frowned and suddenly extended a hand. White flames condensed into a bolt of light.

BOOM!

The Nine-Headed Lion sneered and slammed a palm on that white bolt. Flames exploded. At that moment, his expression suddenly changed. He roared and struck his own chest.

He coughed up a mouthful of blood that instantly evaporated, transforming into nothingness. Vague white lotuses could be seen amongst the blood as they faded.

“What kind of flame is that?” Long Chen’s heart shook. That white flame was clearly the Pill Fairy’s core flame. But it also contained a terrifying divine energy. “Is it a divine flame?”

Long Chen suddenly thought of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight. That aura was extremely similar.

This white flame was extremely bizarre. The Nine-Headed Lion had clearly blocked it, but it still invaded his body. If he hadn’t sensed it fast enough, he might already be seriously injured. Even his life might be in danger.

The Nine-Headed Lion was shocked and infuriated. His golden fur blazed with light. Even as his aura grew increasingly frightening, the Pill Fairy didn’t even look at him.

“I, Yu Qingxuan, came here to watch the battle. I don’t represent the Martial Heaven Continent or Pill Valley. I only represent myself. Due to this, I will not be helping any side. But if anyone provokes me, don’t blame me for replying viciously.”

Her words startled everyone. Was Pill Valley not part of the Martial Heaven Continent? How could she choose to be neutral at this time? Even now, she refused to put down her selfish desires?

Everyone was dumbfounded. What did the Pill Fairy mean when she said that she didn’t represent the Martial Heaven Continent or Pill Valley? Was that to say that she was using her status as divine daughter to watch?

The core of the heavenly tribulation began to grow as more people entered it. Its aura also changed.

However, Yun Tian’s words made it so that Hu Feng, Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, Ximen Tianxiong, and the other experts didn’t enter it.

Hu Feng and the others trusted Yun Tian. He was a Sovereign’s son, so he had to know more than them. Since they trusted him, they also chose to stand and watch what was unfolding.

“Be careful. If you get close to me, the heavenly tribulation will grow stronger,” said Yun Tian, looking up into the sky.

Hu Feng and the others were startled. Just as they were drawing close to Yun Tian, the world rumbled. The sky split apart and a giant gate appeared. It was as if the gate to the heavens had been opened.

Endless lifeforms came flying out of the heavenly gate. Looking at it, Nangong Zuiyue and the others’ hearts shook.

Those lifeforms were extremely varied. There were some giant beasts, sinister fiends, armies wearing ancient armor, and other nameless lifeforms with soaring Blood Qi. In that instant, it became hell on earth.

Those terrifying lifeforms charged over to Long Chen. Like an hourglass that had been breached and all the sand was pouring out, those lifeforms quickly filled the world.

Long Chen and the others were instantly submerged by them. Even Yun Tian’s side was also affected. Hence, Yun Tian formed hand seals, summoning a barrier of divine light that protected them. The others also attacked the lifeforms, trying to kill them.

They were shocked to find that these lifeforms were incredibly powerful. Their realms had reached the early Heaven Merging realm.

These lifeforms were terrifying experts that had been branded into the heavens. In terms of true power, they would not lose out to ordinary mid Heaven Merging experts.

This was a truly apocalyptical tribulation. The only thing that comforted them was Yun Tian’s barrier, which weakened these lifeforms, causing their lightning runes to dim.

Despite that, one human-shaped lifeform wearing ancient robes still managed to break Ximen Tianxiong’s shoulder with a sword. If Hu Feng hadn’t intervened, Ximen Tianxiong might have been killed by another lifeform.

Everyone was stunned. They were only watching from the very edge, so the pressure that Long Chen’s group was under had to be at least ten times greater. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

BOOM!

When they looked toward the center, the void there suddenly exploded. Within a sea of lightning, Long Chen’s foot was firmly embedded into the Nine-Headed Lion’s face. Dragon scales covered his body, and a dragon roar resounded through the sky.
