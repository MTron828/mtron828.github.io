Chapter 4908: Enraged

Huo Qianwu was shocked to see Long Chen actually dare to grab the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip barehanded. Although she didn’t know Long Chen’s exact condition, based on her combat experience, she knew that he didn’t have much dragon blood power left.

For Long Chen to grab it at this time, it was no different than courting death. However, just as he grabbed it, the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip quivered, and Huo Qianwu was shocked to sense the change in its fluctuations.

All of a sudden, Huo Qianwu’s control over the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip plummeted. In her shocked state, her Spiritual Strength erupted to control its item-spirit.

However, the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip seemed to have turned into a rebellious general, refusing to listen to the queen’s orders. It hesitated, as if making a difficult decision.

“Bastard, what did you do?!” roared Huo Qianwu.

“A great general chooses their master. What could I possibly do? I only used my power to show it that following me will give it a better future,” replied Long Chen, a sinister smile gracing his lips.

As Long Chen gripped the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, he could sense the spiritual seal from Huo Linger, which meant that the three phoenix feathers had started their instigation.

Thus, the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip directly started struggling when Long Chen caught it. Furthermore, Long Chen immediately launched some of his own schemes, showing it the forest of Fusang Trees and Moon Trees. When it saw the Moon Flames and Sun Flames, it immediately fell into his grasp.

Suddenly, the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip quivered intensely, and Huo Qianwu felt a sharp pain in her hand as it actually escaped her control.

“You dare to betray your master?! Die!” Huo Qianwu roared. She didn’t know why the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip would betray her and throw itself into Long Chen’s embrace, but this betrayal completely enraged her.

Forming hand seals, Huo Qianwu spat out a mouthful of blood onto her seal, causing the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip’s runes to light up ferociously. In her anger, she chose to directly detonate it.

Although the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip was a top-grade Heaven Saint divine weapon, it was still a weapon under its master’s control to prevent it from rebelling. Seeing that she was about to lose the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, Huo Qianwu furiously activated the runes to destroy it. Even if she couldn’t detonate it, at the very least, she would destroy its divine runes and turn it into a piece of trash.

The Blaze Dragon Bone Whip fought back, unleashing flames to resist her control. Seeing this scene, Long Chen laughed and said, “There’s no need. If you want to follow me, how can I let you suffer?”

The Blaze Dragon Bone Whip vanished as Long Chen sent it into the primal chaos space, causing Huo Qianwu to lose her connection to it. Her face twisted with rage, and in an instant, a peerless heavenly genius transformed into an angry vixen. The Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress blazed with light, and her fingers extended like claws, reaching for Long Chen.

Losing the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip drove her crazy. She had never suffered such indignation in her life before.

Her fingernails, adorned with a thousand phoenixes flowing on top of them, sliced through the void, unleashing ear-piercing sounds. Even without her Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, she could still unleash terrifying divine abilities.

However, in her immense rage, her technique was a mess. She had clearly gone crazy.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Long Chen grabbed Huo Qianwu’s claws with his hands. However, due to his dragon blood power withering away, Huo Qianwu’s nails dug deep into his flesh. She then pulled her hand fiercely and shot forward, wanting to bite Long Chen’s neck. She had gone fully insane and no longer cared about her dignity.

In front of her crazy attack, Long Chen snorted and grabbed hold of the sleeves of the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress. All of a sudden, it blazed with light and contracted, causing Huo Qianwu to stiffen. She was bound by the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress.

“What is going on?!” The shock snapped Huo Qianwu out of her crazed state, and she stared in disbelief at her Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress.

“Hand it over!” Long Chen demanded, pulling at her dress.

To everyone’s surprise, the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress was actually ripped from Huo Qianwu. The priceless treasure that countless experts would go crazy for was stripped off just like this.

“Damn, what ruthlessness!” Mo Nian was in the midst of fighting the devil expert, but most of his attention was actually on Long Chen’s side. He cheered when Long Chen ripped off Huo Qianwu’s clothes, but then let out a disappointed cry. “A scam! What a scam! Your entire body is a scam!”

At this moment, Huo Qianwu was reduced to just her underclothes. In her exposed state, her true form was revealed, her figure resembling a stick. Huo Qianwu was stunned for a moment after being stripped. However, upon hearing Mo Nian’s cry, she let out an ear-piercing shriek, and flames quickly condensed into fine cloth, covering her.

“I’ll kill you!” Huo Qianwu let out a heart-rending roar, slamming her hands together, her eyes scarlet with fury.

Long Chen and Mo Nian didn’t know what she was doing, but that devil expert actually fled.

Mo Nian quickly realized what she was doing. “She’s self-detonating!”

“Qianwu, don’t be foolish!”

Just then, a shout rang out, and a rune lit up on Huo Qianwu, holding back her detonation. It was the voice of the vice hall master.

The vice hall master had left his spiritual mark on her. Although he couldn’t enter Heaven Screen Mountain, this spiritual mark was able to enter with her. Unfortunately, this spiritual mark was extremely weak. Otherwise, the Heaven Screen Mountain’s laws would have sensed it and prevented it from entering.

“Long Chen has gone too far! I no longer have the face to keep living. I’m going to drag him down with me!” roared Huo Qianwu.

“Come on, you don’t have any face left? Your butt is in the same condition. In any case, your Flame Divine Hall has always been spouting crap. You’ll get used to not having any face,” said Mo Nian, rubbing his own salt and spices into Huo Qianwu’s wounds.

“AH! DIE!”

Mo Nian’s instigation caused Huo Qianwu to go apeshit once more. She ignored the vice hall master as the Heavenly Fate Disc behind him contracted, causing heaven and earth to change color.

“It seems that this kind of detonation will be quite strong. Come, let me see if your detonation can harm me,” said Long Chen with no fear. He wondered whether or not a Heavenly Chosen Fruit would appear on the Heavenly Dao Tree once she died.

BOOM!
