Chapter 4273 Lightning Flame World Extermination

“Long Aotian!”

When people saw the figure that Long Chen was flying toward, they were shocked. Long Aotian lay on the ground, covered in wounds, some of which were so deep that they revealed bone. His aura was listless, and it was evident that the last attack had exhausted too much of his power.

Upon seeing Long Chen coming at him, Long Aotian’s face twisted. He then shot off the ground and smashed a fist at Long Chen. Three-colored marks manifested on it, while heaven and earth trembled in response. Even on his last legs, Long Aotian was still terrifying.

As for Long Chen’s fist, seven stars lit up on it as he unleashed a simple punch.

BOOM!

Long Aotian’s shriek rang out upon the explosive collision. His arm was blown apart.

"Long Aotian has been defeated!" Gasps of disbelief swept through the crowd.

“Someone as strong as Long Aotian, who had unlocked the three-flower heavenly merger manifestation and harbored the potential to ascend as a Human Emperor, was actually defeated?"

“Just what kind of monster is Long Chen?”

Long Aotian’s power had exceeded everyone’s expectations, but he still lost to Long Chen. Furthermore, it was a complete and total defeat without any room for excuses.

After that immense clash, both of their auras had dropped, but Long Chen still had more energy than Long Aotian. Who won and who lost was all too clear. In other words, Long Chen’s power was not just slightly greater than that of Long Aotian.

After destroying Long Aotian’s arm, Long Chen turned and shot after Long Aotian once more, reaching a claw toward Long Aotian’s throat.

However, space suddenly quivered, and a spear appeared out of nowhere, piercing toward Long Chen’s back. That frightening void-piercing sound told him that an innate Heaven Venerate was attacking him.

Furthermore, this person had grasped the timing very well. If Long Chen wanted to avoid this attack, he would have to give up on pursuing Long Aotian.

BANG!

Long Chen’s hand swung around and firmly caught the spear tip.

Upon looking back, Long Chen’s gaze grew even colder. The one attacking him was the arrogant Eighth Elder of the Long clan.

Seeing Long Chen turn his attention to him, the Eighth Elder’s hair suddenly stood on end.

BANG!

He crushed a jade talisman, causing spatial energy to wrap around him.

Clearly, the Eighth Elder was crafty and had prepared his way out from the start. Knowing that he wasn’t a match for Long Chen, he directly used a talisman to escape.

As spatial energy wrapped around the Eighth Elder, Long Chen shoved the spear back at him. The immense power propelled it through his body, piercing him straight through.

However, just as Long Chen was about to kill him, the spatial energy activated and sent him away.

Still, Long Chen’s blow was devastating. Even though the Eighth Elder wasn’t blasted apart right there and then, the chances of him surviving were not high.

Just as the Eighth Elder vanished, Long Chen tossed the spear in his hand at Long Aotian. At that moment, a jade talisman appeared in his left hand.

However, before he could crush it, the spear blew apart the talisman and his remaining hand. Long Aotian then screamed and ran for his life.

“Grand Elder, save me!”

Long Aotian cried out in terror, devoid of any air of an expert. Instead, he seemed more like a wild dog.

Observing this sequence of events, countless experts sighed inwardly. Long Aotian was now utterly defeated. The battle had shattered his confidence and entrenched his inner demons. All his extraordinary talent would go to waste, and his future achievements would be severely limited.

It was clear that, at this point, Long Aotian would have considerable difficulty even attaining the status of a Heaven Venerate, let alone aspiring to become a Human Emperor. This talent was completely wasted, all thanks to Long Chen.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s expression changed. He saw countless experts from the devil race, Blood race, demonic beast race, Undying race, Shadow race, Netherworld race, and countless others flooding toward the Dragonblood Legion.

In an instant, Long Chen understood their intentions. Their goal was to kill the experts who had managed to absorb the karmic luck runes.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

These experts might not be able to use those runes now, but once they grew up, they would be a serious threat to the other races. In the future, perhaps all the other races would be suppressed by the human race.

Just as Long Chen was pursuing Long Aotian, an immense chaotic battle also erupted on that side. The High Firmament Academy, Starry River Sect, and Battle God Palace’s experts had all joined in the fray.

However, there were too many enemies flooding toward them from all sides. They clearly wanted to take advantage of the chaos to kill them all, not giving them any chance to grow.

Long Chen looked at the fleeing Long Aotian and then his surrounded comrades. He had a difficult decision to make. If he pursued Long Aotian, perhaps the Dragonblood Legion would be able to protect itself, but as for the others, they would all be slain.

However, if he gave up on chasing Long Aotian, such a good opportunity would probably never present itself again. Long Chen had always been decisive, but now he didn’t know what to do.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, go! Kill that ingrate Long Aotian! We’ll be fine!” Seeing Long Chen pause, some people saw the clues and shouted at him. They were the ones who had come to assist Long Chen. After learning about Long Chen’s tragic experience, their hearts brimmed with fury on his behalf. If only they possessed the strength, they would have been the ones charging out to tear Long Aotian apart.

“Fine, I’ll let you live a bit longer.”

Long Chen clenched his teeth and suddenly turned back, spreading his Kunpeng wings as he rushed back to the Dragonblood Legion.

With lightning in his left hand and flames in his right, he summoned rolling thunder that surged above the nine heavens and chanted a flame sutra that resounded throughout heaven and earth.

“Lightning Flame World Extermination!”

As Long Chen brought his hands together, a lotus of annihilation created of fused lightning and flames smashed toward the experts below.

BOOM!

Explosions of lightning and flames directly devoured and turned innumerable experts to dust. Not even innate Heaven Venerates were able to endure the onslaught.

“Kill him! This person cannot be left alive!”

Countless experts howled and turned on Long Chen. Although this attack from Long Chen was terrifying, it no longer had the power of his final blow against Long Aotian. Thus, it was evident that Long Chen’s power had started dropping.

Once a person’s power started to drop, it would continue to diminish. This was their best chance to kill Long Chen.

After the lightning and flames devastated the battlefield, they transformed into two enormous dragons. Now, Lei Linger and Huo Linger were free to attack the enemies themselves.

Both dragons unleashed a wave of dragon breath, causing lightning and flames to weave together once more, slaying countless experts. Afterward, Lei Linger shot toward the Heavenly Lightning Violet Salamander race and began a slaughter.

On the other hand, with flames swirling around her, Huo Linger shot toward the experts blocking Long Chen’s way. With both sisters unleashing their full might, they transformed the battlefield into a scene of absolute carnage.

BOOM!

Long Chen broke through their encirclement and returned to the ranks of the Dragonblood Legion.
