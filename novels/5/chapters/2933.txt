Chapter 2922 World Extermination Flame Lotus Shocks

Chu Kuang concentrated all his manifestation’s power into a single fist. Space began to twist around it furiously.

Long Chen snorted and extended a hand. A lotus mark appeared on his palm. The lotus had nine petals, and nine stars appeared on every petal. When this flame lotus appeared, the entire world changed color.

Just now, the sun had been high and bright in the sky. Now, countless rainbow clouds covered the sky, shocking everyone.

“A manifestation of the Heavenly Daos, seven-color auspicious clouds! Could it be that the magical art in Long Chen’s hand was made by himself? It has been acknowledged by heaven and earth?!”

The experts present were stunned. Legend was that when powerful divine arts appeared in this world, they would be acknowledged by the Heavenly Daos, and the seven-color auspicious cloud manifestation would descend.

Divine arts that could be acknowledged by the immortal world were all exceedingly terrifying. Those were techniques that an entire sect could be founded upon. A lower world ascender like Long Chen could create such a technique at such a young age?

Those who had managed to create their own divine arts that were recognized by the immortal world’s Heavenly Daos were essentially all famous figures within the immortal world’s history. As for Long Chen… For a moment, everyone could only stare at him in disbelief.

A small flame dragon coiled around Long Chen’s arm. Its body began to dim, but the lotus instantly began radiating brilliant light.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen smashed his palm at Chu Kuang’s fist. Victory or defeat would be decided here.

BOOM!

In front of countless shocked gazes, one palm and one fist collided. The entire plaza shuddered, and the barrier around the battlefield collapsed.

Gusts of wind blew past these experts, feeling like knives on their skin. Fortunately, the head of the Immortal Institute still had his defense up, so no one was injured.

The terrain within the battlefield had completely changed. The original tall mountain range where Long Chen and Chu Kuang had been fighting was now a plain of ruins.

At the center, one of Long Chen’s arms was bare. In the end, he was unable to protect that sleeve. His aura was starting to grow chaotic. That attack had almost exhausted all of his energy.

What Long Chen hadn’t expected was that the World Extermination Flame Lotus would have even greater power in the immortal world. When it appeared, so much flame energy had automatically flowed towards it that he hadn’t even needed to guide it.

As long as time permitted it, the World Extermination Flame Lotus could have continued growing stronger limitlessly, but then Long Chen wouldn’t be able to control it.

In fact, his right hand was currently a bloody mess from using it. But he ignored it. He walked over to where Chu Kuang was laying.

Half of Chu Kuang’s body was gone. He no longer appeared as arrogant and indomitable as before. Instead, he looked like a half-dead dog, curled up with his body twitching.

When he saw Long Chen coming towards him, he was filled with terror. He had lost. He wasn’t a match for Long Chen.

“Uncle, save me!”

Chu Kuang suddenly shouted with all his power. The void shattered, and a figure came flying out of that space.

That figure was fast, but Long Chen was even faster. He immediately appeared in front of Chu Kuang and grabbed his head, lifting him up like a chicken.

The one who had come was Chu Huairen. He had immediately rushed over, but he was too late.

The other magistrate also appeared. Just as they entered, Long Chen sensed an aura behind him. The head judge had come as well.

“Long Chen, we admit defeat. Release Chu Kuang. You can set any conditions that you wish,” said Chu Huairen.

He had never dreamed that Chu Kuang would be defeated, especially not to some lower world ascender with no foundation or background.

His reactions were just a bit too slow to save Chu Kuang. Now his life was in Long Chen’s hands. Chu Huairen wanted to attack and kill Long Chen, snuffing out this terrifying existence while he could. But he couldn’t.

“Big word. I don’t want anything. I just want his life. Otherwise, I won’t be able to face those brothers that died in battle here,” said Long Chen with a cold smile. Did he really think that anyone could be bought with money?

“Long Chen, do you know which god that the Chu family worships?” shouted the other magistrate.

“Does it have anything to do with me?” Long Chen was well aware, but he acted like a fool.

“I’m not afraid of telling you that it is the mighty Divine Venerate Brahma who controls almost half the powers within the hundred domains and thousand prefectures! If you kill Chu Kuang, you will also be killed. Not even the dean would be able to protect you!” declared the magistrate.

The other experts’ expressions changed. No one had known that the Chu family had actually become one of Divine Venerate Brahma’s subordinates.

“The name of Divine Venerate Brahma is supreme. Would he lie about this?”

“The Chu family was defeated by the Luo family and almost wiped out. For them to suddenly rise again must be because of Divine Venerate Brahma.”

“Heavens, if that’s true, then their backer is truly huge! The Luo family is doomed…”

“What a lack of justice. This trash Chu Kuang actually has such a background. No one can touch him…”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning shivered. This huge secret was actually exposed today. It was the worst news to the Luo family.

The Chu family had Divine Venerate Brahma’s support? Then how would the Luo family fight them? How could they avoid being wiped out?

“Divine Venerate Brahma? What crap is that? How come I’ve never heard of such a thing? And so what? Do you think I’m afraid?” sneered Long Chen.

Brahma? Tch, even if Brahma didn’t come for him, Long Chen would be the one finding him. Just wait. He might not be able to beat him now, but who said he couldn’t beat his followers?

“How brazen! You dare to blaspheme Divine Venerate Brahma?! You are courting death!” raged the magistrate.

Long Chen slapped Chu Kuang’s face, causing more blood to spray out of him. Chu Kuang screamed.

“Old ghost, do you want to try cursing me again? Let’s see just which one of us is tougher. If you have the guts, don’t stop.” Long Chen shook Chu Kuang in front of him. That appearance of his was incredibly infuriating.
