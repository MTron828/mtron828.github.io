Chapter 3108 Terrifying Fatty

Today’s spectator stands had changed again. Originally, there was a formation blocking off those spectators. But today, that formation was removed, and everyone was able to see everything clearly. It was precisely due to this that Long Chen’s arrival resulted in countless gazes.

The fight between Long Chen and Chu Gan was the most marvelous one during this Nine Prefecture Convention. Hence, Long Chen’s fame had spread far and wide. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yesterday’s battle also showed that Long Chen was different from the past instructors that had participated in the Dao discussion convention. He was not someone who only knew battle strategies on paper but also possessed the necessary power.

Because of it, Long Chen’s arrival caused a large stir. Countless people waved and cheered for him. Amongst them were many women.

However, what drew Long Chen’s attention the most wasn’t those cheers but those sharp gazes full of hostility.

In particular, Long Chen saw four people. Hehe, they were precisely the Chu family’s four heroes, Chu Gan, Chu Ren, Chu Zhen, and Chu Shuang.

Chu Gan’s arms had been restored, but his face was still pale white. Clearly, healing from his wounds wasn’t so simple. Long Chen had given him wounds that would probably require a longer time to heal.

Anger ignited in their eyes as soon as they saw Long Chen. Their killing intent was not hidden in the slightest.

“Do those four idiots not know that their deaths are at hand?” sneered Qin Feng.

“They’re doing it on purpose to show just how stupid they are. That way, it covers up their sinister schemes. It makes us overlook what they’re doing behind the scenes,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Then they really are naive,” said Qin Feng.

“How smart do you think that they are? They’re still praying that I won’t notice their plan. They must be feeling uneasy since miss Luo Qing abandoned her match yesterday. However, they still think that their movements are flawless and shouldn’t have been seen through. So they have to keep up this show. That’s why I said that they’re shameless clowns. Being put in their place is only a matter of time. Just let them act arrogant for a while,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen then looked around and saw quite a few unfriendly faces. In one distant corner, Long Chen saw a cloaked figure, and he slowly smiled.

Just as he saw this person, that person sensed it and looked back. Long Chen was a bit surprised that this person wasn’t wearing a mask.

Furthermore, he was different from the ordinary assassins of the Bloodkill Hall. Most of those assassins were rather lean, but this person was a bit fat, and his eyes were small. Just from his exterior, he seemed like a harmless fatty that wouldn’t harm a fly.

If Long Chen couldn’t sense the specific aura of the Bloodkill Hall from his body, he really wouldn’t have been able to tell that this unremarkable fatty was that final disciple of the Killing God, Enpuda. He was Gui Yun whose name struck others with terror.

Gui Yun narrowed his eyes slightly when he looked at Long Chen. His already small eyes instantly became slits.

Just then, Long Chen felt a slight change in the space around him. It was as if countless eyes were looking at him from different angles, as if all his secrets were being exposed. It was a very uncomfortable feeling.

“Interesting. As expected of Enpuda’s disciple, his visual piercing arts have reached a perfect level.” Long Chen nodded. This Gui Yun had not disappointed him.

Just then, Luo Bing and the others’ expressions changed. “Long Chen…”

“It’s fine. It would be strange if Enpuda’s disciple didn’t have this little bit of ability.”

“But…” said Luo Ning hastily.

Long Chen interrupted her, “I said it’s fine. Even if he could look through your memories, there wouldn’t be any need to be so nervous.”

He knew that their expressions had changed because just now, it felt like they had gone through a soulsearch. It was as if all their secrets had been looked through.

They finally sensed just how terrifying this seemingly ordinary fatty was. Just a single gaze from him could expose all their secrets. They couldn’t even muster up the courage to attack.

Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, and the others were pale. The feeling of having their soul searched was truly unbearable.

“Your inner hearts aren’t tough enough. Assassins like to play games the most. Even if he could look through your souls, do you know just how much he saw? How do you know he was not intentionally trying to scare you? If you meet someone on par with you but a single gaze from him causes you to overthink everything, you will be easily killed. No matter what time it is, you must maintain a steady heart. Even in the face of death, you must have absolute calm in front of it. Fear and panic will only cause you to lose your last chance of surviving,” said Long Chen.

“Don’t give off a weak display. Let him see us laughing and joking. With boss present, there’s nothing to fear,” said Qin Feng.

Although Qin Feng also felt as if his soul had been looked through, he didn’t rest his mind on it. With Long Chen present, there was nothing for him to worry about.

In any case, it had to be said that Gui Yun was truly terrifying. A single gaze from him could terrify others. Furthermore, Long Chen also hadn’t expected Gui Yun’s ability to see through others to have reached such a level.

Although Gui Yun wasn’t able to see through his secrets; the power of his physical body, his blood, and his bones couldn’t possibly have escaped this examination. Gui Yun had definitely managed to get a rough estimate of Long Chen’s overall power. This was a fundamental technique for an assassin, but for Gui Yun to have reached such a perfect level in this technique was truly shocking.

Compared to Luo Bing and the others, Bai Shishi, young master Changchuan, Luo Xue, and Bai Xiaole were a bit better off. Although they also felt like they had been scanned, they didn’t feel that kind of intense danger. They all had confidence that others couldn’t see through their secrets.

As for Bai Xiaole, he was so simple-minded that he wasn’t afraid of others peering through his secrets. They could look for all he cared. He had such absolute confidence in his Three Flower Pupils that he was thinking the same thing as Qin Feng. As long as he was with Long Chen, he didn’t care about the rest.

“Long Chen, look at that person. That is the Ku Wuya of the Corpse Devil Dao. He’s also looking at us,” whispered Bai Shishi.

Long Chen followed her gaze and quickly noticed a large figure.

“What a terrifying physical body.”
