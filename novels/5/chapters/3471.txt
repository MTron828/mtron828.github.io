Chapter 3460 Heaven-Shaking Attack

Bai Shishi and the others received the order and didn’t hesitate. They all activated their tablets and were instantly brought back into the academy.

Before anyone could understand what was happening, a pillar of divine light exploded in the distance. It was like a sun was attacking. The terrifying pressure shattered the surrounding mountains.

At that moment, the wind and clouds changed color, while heaven and earth shuddered. It was like the apocalypse had come. Everyone was horrified. This power was smashing directly toward the High Firmament Academy.

Just then, the High Firmament Academy’s grand formations rumbled and countless ripples appeared. After that, every building within the academy began to shine brightly. As runes blazed with light, an outline of the entire academy appeared on top of the barrier.

The truth was that every building in the academy was its own independent grand formation. That was why when Long Chen said to activate all of them, Heaven Master Yun Yang couldn’t believe his ears. That price was astonishing.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, Long Chen’s sense of danger was truly sharp. Heaven Master Yun Yang had just activated all the formations when the attack came.

Everyone stared in horror as a giant blood-colored sun smashed into the academy.

“That damn fatty, as expected. He was letting us kill the devils to gather their devil qi. Then he would launch an attack to wipe us out. Fuck, good thing it was sensed early.” Long Chen felt some cold sweat on his back.

This star contained an enormous amount of devil qi. It was a star made from an extreme compression of devil qi.

BOOM!

The star then struck the formation, and the immense power caused the world to shake. Even Long Chen was unable to stand steady in the face of that impact. His Blood Qi flipped inside of him, and his ears were ringing. He couldn’t hear anything.

As for the other disciples, they coughed up blood. The majority fainted, while the others were left with their heads buzzing. They temporarily lost most of their senses.

Bai Zhantang and the others were also shaken and took a while to recover. They were shocked and infuriated. The power of that one attack was enough to annihilate all of them.

Fortunately, while countless cracks and holes appeared in the grand formations, they still managed to hold on.

“Three million immortal king crystals…”

Heaven Master Yun Yang was aggrieved. Just to block this attack, three million immortal king crystals were turned into nothing. That was the price of increasing the formations to their maximum power at once.

However, these three million immortal king crystals were all worth it to block this attack. Seeing the riddled formation, Long Chen felt a burst of fear. They had almost been doomed just now.

Just then, countless experts appeared from all sides. It wasn’t just the deep sea fiend devils and the lifeforms from the devil world. The Devil Eye Water Lily race’s experts also showed up.

This time, even the weakest of the devil world and devil sea’s lifeforms were half-step World Kings. These experts had clearly been waiting for this moment.

The grand formations were riddled with holes. If they were to launch another powerful attack at this time, it would be all too easy to break the academy entirely.

Although the formations were also rapidly repairing themselves, that would take a certain amount of time. The enemy wouldn’t give them that chance.

“Kill!”

Long Chen roared and was the first to charge out. He was like a bolt of lightning charging at the distant Devil Eye Water Lily race. Although their experts were mostly in the Immortal King realm, in terms of actual power, they were even more terrifying than the World Kings.

They definitely couldn’t be allowed to approach the barrier. Otherwise, with their power, the formations would crumble.

As soon as Long Chen charged out, some spiritual fluctuations locked onto him. Long Chen narrowed his eyes. These fluctuations belonged to that Devil Eye Water Lily whose seed pod he had taken.

After that, overwhelming killing intent erupted and giant leaves covered the heavens. A giant lily appeared.

As the lily’s runes glowed, they transformed into a long-haired man with a five-colored sword, and he charged at Long Chen. He actually used his true body as his manifestation.

“Damnable human, you dared to ruin my path to advancing! I will tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces!” shouted that man furiously.

At that time, he had made his preparations to advance to the World King realm. But Long Chen cut off his seed pod, severing his path to advancing.

He had tried to take back his seed pod, but without it, he was like a human that had lost his Dantian. His power plummeted and he couldn’t even unleash a tenth of his power. In the end, he could only watch as Long Chen took it away.

He then returned to the Undying World and condensed a new seed pod. Now that he was seeing Long Chen again, he was raging with killing intent.

The manifestation behind the Devil Eye Water Lily man raged. The lily leaves, flowers, and seeds shone brightly, and divine light flowed out and filled him. After that, the five-colored sword in his hand blazed with light as well. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth--all five elements twined together. The power of his attack was comparable to an attack from a World King.

“You’re a lifeform from the Undying World, but instead of cultivating in the Undying World, you ran over to my immortal world, occupying the land of my academy. Since you were willing to be used by others, you definitely deserve to die. I can’t be bothered to waste words with you. Is the Devil Eye Water Lily race so amazing? Then today, I’ll show you that the human race is the king of the immortal world. Divine ring, battle armor!”

Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, his stars shining brightly. After that, golden dragon scales covered his body, and a dragon cry rang out, exuding a golden ripple with him in the center. The Devil Eye Water Lily man was actually sent back staggering by that ripple.

“Die!”

Long Chen’s roar was like spring thunder. His blood-red saber came out of its sheath, absorbing all the murderous aura of the world without leaving a drop. It then slashed mercilessly at the Devil Eye Water Lily man.

BOOM!

As a result, five-colored light exploded. That man from the Devil Eye Water Lily race was blasted to bits along with his sword.

When Long Chen let out a roar, his saber also roared. Overflowing battle intent then came raging out.

“All of you have committed crimes against my academy. You can all die miserable deaths now!”

Long Chen’s long hair flailed in the air. Like an unstoppable god of war, he charged at the Devil Eye Water Lily race’s experts. His 108,000 stars unleashed all their power.

Long Chen didn’t hold back and started off at full power. Due to it, these Devil Eye Water Lily experts collapsed, not one capable of stopping him.

BOOM!

At this moment, a half-step World King expert of the Devil Eye Water Lily race appeared. His five-colored divine sword was finally capable of stopping Long Chen.

However, he had just stopped Long Chen’s saber when a lotus mark appeared on Long Chen’s left hand. He then slammed it into his enemy’s head, and the latter exploded. That half-step World King’s power was truly terrifying, but he wasn’t able to attack as fast as Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t tarry. He killed as many as he could to buy time for the grand formations to repair themselves.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted. At the same time, he heard Bai Zhantang’s furious roar.

“Jia Luo, this time, only one of us will live to see tomorrow’s sun!”
