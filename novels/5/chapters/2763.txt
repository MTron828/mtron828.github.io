Chapter 2752 The Eastern Wasteland Bell Chooses a Master

The Eastern Wasteland Bell didn’t give Long Chen any chance to refuse. It directly appeared above Long Chen’s head, and divine light enveloped Long Chen.

Some of the immortal corpses charging over had their runes directly corrode when they were touched by that light. They quickly began to rot.

The sound of an ancient bell rang throughout the world, and golden light filled the air. The Eastern Wasteland Bell brought Long Chen flying away.

“It’s the Eastern Wasteland Bell!”

The divine families’ experts recognized the Eastern Wasteland Bell, the leader of the five supreme divine items of the Martial Heaven Continent. However, they didn’t know why it would appear here. Only those on the level of Saints were aware of the secret involving the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

At this moment, the void was torn apart. The Eastern Wasteland Bell didn’t take a spatial channel. It directly barged through the spatial wall to return to the Martial Heaven Continent.

When Long Chen appeared on the Martial Heaven Continent, his expression completely changed. There was a berserk energy hanging within the air, like a volcano that had been accumulating for millions of years and was on the verge of erupting. This power was enough to destroy the entire world.

As the Eastern Wasteland Bell quivered, Long Chen’s vision changed and he appeared in front of the Corrupt God Cemetery. There were countless experts of the Undying race here, surrounding an altar that was emitting a pillar of Blood Qi into the sky. It seemed as if millions and millions of lifeforms had been sacrificed. Even from a great distance, it was possible to sense an immense resentful air.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors guarding this place cried out when they saw Long Chen. Meng Qi and the others cried. Long Chen really had returned. They had been extremely worried this entire time but hadn’t dared to tell anyone else about it. The other worlds’ experts had been constantly spreading the news that Long Chen had been captured, to the point that even the Dragonblood warriors had started to sense that something was wrong.

However, they kept those suspicions inside. Even if they could tell that Long Chen’s clone was not his true body, they didn’t say anything.

Now that he was back, they were all ecstatic. All their worries vanished like clouds in a wind, and their blood began to heat up. With Long Chen here, they didn’t fear any battle.

Long Chen looked at the Dragonblood Legion and couldn’t help being moved. Meng Qi and the others had truly worked hard during this time. The unending supply of medicinal pills had allowed every single Dragonblood warrior to advance to the ninth Heavenstage.

Moreover, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Yue Zifeng, Gu Yang, and the others had all advanced to the tenth Heavenstage to become Venerates. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

What Long Chen hadn’t expected was that there would also be two Saints. Furthermore, the most unexpected thing was that one was Mo Nian, while the other was Ye Zhiqiu.

However, after a moment of thought, he supposed that it was due to the two supreme divine items in their hands. Other than them, Wilde, who was also in possession of a supreme divine item, was practically exploding with Blood Qi. His body was covered in golden runes and looked as if it had been made of gold. His realm could not be evaluated based on the Martial Heaven Continent’s cultivation standards.

As for the Western Desert Ax on Wilde’s back, all of its rust had long since fallen off. It shone with an unprecedented divine light and contained a powerful murderous aura around it.

As soon as Long Chen returned, he sensed the Eastern Wasteland Bell saying something to the Western Desert Ax, the Northern Source Sword, and the Central Plains Cauldron.

“You’re finally back. If you still didn’t return, you wouldn’t be able to blame me when I take the place of the main character.” Mo Nian laughed and hugged Long Chen warmly.

Mo Nian and Guo Ran were the only ones who hadn’t been worried about Long Chen, because they had almost blind faith in him. In Guo Ran’s opinion, his boss was unbeatable and nothing could stop him. As for Mo Nian, he thought that Long Chen was a bad person, and bad people never had short lives. This scourge would definitely live a long life.

“What’s the situation?” asked Long Chen.

“We don’t know. These meatless fellows suddenly dragged out this altar, and then the aura of the entire world changed. We were in the midst of deciding whether or not we should launch a direct attack on them.” Mo Nian shrugged. He was also befuddled by what the Undying race was doing.

“They’re offering flesh and blood to the Heaven Devastating Bracelet so that it awakens. Prepare yourself. The battle is about to start,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell suddenly.

“What?” Mo Nian and the others were startled. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet was on the verge of awakening? But the master of the Southern Sea Zither was under the enemies’ control, and they had yet to gather all five supreme divine items. What were they to do?

Suddenly, the land began to shake. The laws of heaven and earth were thrown into chaos. It was as if a heaven-swallowing beast at the bottom of the world was about to come out.

Mountains collapsed and lava exploded. The very shape of the world was distorted. It was as if the apocalypse had come.

“The Heaven Devastating Bracelet is starting to move. It’s contracting, trying to squeeze out the core of the Martial Heaven Continent. If it does, this world will collapse. We don’t have that much time,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell. “I need a master to unleash my full power. Who is willing to join forces with me to protect the Martial Heaven Continent, to live and die for the continent?”

“Senior, why not me?” asked Long Chen.

“You are the gamebreaker. The game can only be broken from outside of the game. You cannot be my master,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

“Senior, this junior is Gu Yang. I am willing to fight alongside you. Even if my bones are ground to dust, I will not hesitate,” said Gu Yang.

It wasn’t just Gu Yang. The rest of the Dragonblood warriors also stepped forward. Despite knowing that if they did this, their life would no longer belong to just them, not one person retreated.

The Eastern Wasteland Bell cast its divine light onto Gu Yang. It said, “Although your aptitude is a bit lacking, it’s still acceptable. Then-”

“One moment.”

Suddenly, a voice rang out. Everyone turned to see a white-robed Yun Tian appear like a celestial king.

“Senior, please see if this junior is acceptable.” Yun Tian bowed to the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

The Eastern Wasteland Bell scanned him with its divine light, as if appraising him. After a long time, it sighed. “This father-and-son pair… The Martial Heaven Continent owes you far too much.”

Yun Tian shook his head. “Senior, where did those words come from? People are born from heaven and earth. Without this world, where would I be? If my father could do it, then I can also do it.”

The Eastern Wasteland Bell sighed, “Fine, fine. Everything will be up to fate.”

The Eastern Wasteland Bell glowed and Yun Tian’s aura shuddered. Only now did they realize that Yun Tian’s cultivation base had reached the peak of the Saint realm. It was even higher than Mo Nian and the others.

A bell-shaped rune then appeared on Yun Tian’s forehead. The Eastern Wasteland Bell vanished, merging with Yun Tian. This process of acknowledging a master was very simple.

“Brother Long Chen, I will work with senior to stop the Heaven Devastating Bracelet from destroying the Martial Heaven Continent. But all we can do is stall it to win more time for you. Whether or not this board can be broken will ultimately be up to you. Good luck.” Yun Tian patted Long Chen’s shoulder. He then turned around and vanished.

Yun Tian had just left when a commotion appeared amongst the Undying race’s side. Their army parted, and a certain person walked out from within the Corrupt God Cemetery.

“How can this be?!”

Upon seeing him, Mo Nian and the others’ expressions changed. They couldn’t believe it.
