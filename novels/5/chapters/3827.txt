Chapter 3816 Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros

“Boss, what do you mean? Me? With my status, how could I be worthy to carry senior?” Guo Ran almost pissed himself in fright.

This senior might not look like a bad person, but he was already a corpse. Even though just a corpse wouldn’t frighten Guo Ran, those eyes were so terrifying.

To carry someone whose eyes could destroy the world, Guo Ran shuddered at the thought.

“If you don’t want to carry him, that’s alright too. I’ll carry him. If we encounter any danger up ahead, you’ll be the one dealing with it,” said Long Chen lightly.

“Ah, nevermind, let me!” Guo Ran clenched his teeth. With goosebumps, he picked up the elder and carried him on his back. The elder’s body was stiff, so Guo Ran couldn’t carry him like a normal person. He had to bind the elder to his body.

Guo Ran knew that if Long Chen carried this elder, if they encountered any danger up ahead, it would affect Long Chen’s reactions. Hence, it would be better for Guo Ran to carry it instead.

In order to feel a bit better, Guo Ran summoned his battle armor and wrapped it around himself. That gave him a sense of safety.

“Little hero, this is the keepsake of my wife. Take it. It can bring you to her,” said the elder, extending his left hand.

However, the elder’s fist was still tightly clenched. He couldn’t let go. Long Chen stared blankly at him.

The elder said, “I can’t open my hand. I’ll trouble you to pry it apart.”

“Then my apologies.”

Looking at the withered fist, Long Chen apologized and grabbed his finger.

Crack.

The finger snapped off. Through this crack in the elder’s fist, Long Chen withdrew a silver hairpin.

It was small, perhaps only two inches long. But it was very elaborate and covered in delicate lines. It also gave off the aura of primal chaos.

A tiny little hairpin actually possessed the ancient primal chaos qi. That shocked everyone. This was probably an amazing divine item.

The hairpin was in the shape of an elaborate flower. The flower’s petals were all different colors, and it was a flower that they had never seen before. At the center was a crystal with a tiny needle that was constantly quivering, pointing in one direction.

“It’s pointing toward the depths of the heavenly tomb. That’s where we’re going too.” Mo Nian eyed the needle and then checked the map.

After entrusting the hairpin to Long Chen, the elder handed his staff to Guo Ran.

“This is my weapon. Help me take it!”

Guo Ran overjoyed, thinking that the elder was giving him his weapon. He was about to thank the elder when the elder disappointed him.

“This weapon can only be used with pupil arts. It will disappoint you.”

“Ah… what are you talking about? What disappointment? Carrying you is my life’s honor.” Although Guo Ran was disappointed, he didn’t express it.

When Guo Ran received the staff, he found that this seemingly heavy staff seemed to have no weight at all. It was extremely strange.

After passing the staff to Guo Ran, the elder’s eyes began to grow dim. His entire aura vanished as if he had truly died.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, Long Chen refused to believe that this elder that had lived all the way from the immemorial era would die so easily. They then continued onward.

“Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros!”

They hadn’t gotten far when Yue Xiaoqian saw a giant skeleton and cried out in shock.

“Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros? The immemorial species? The one whose horn can easily break space like cutting paper?” Mo Nian was also startled. He had heard of this legendary existence. They had long since gone extinct.

“I’m not too sure, but we’ll know if we look at its horn.” Yue Xiaoqian quickly rushed over to the skeleton and pulled it out of the mud.

Its body wasn’t particularly huge. It was only thirty meters tall, and its head was buried. Although its body had withered, it still gave off an astonishing aura.

A three-foot-long rhinoceros horn quickly entered their eyes. They all gasped.

It was like jade and had countless veins within it. It was like a beautiful ornament. They could vaguely see energy fluctuations inside of it.

“Treasure!”

Mo Nian gulped down his saliva. As someone with great vision, he could tell that it was definitely a treasure.

Yue Xiaoqian carefully touched it. She noticed the tiniest of cracks located three inches below its nasal bone.

Long Chen then took out the black dagger, but Yue Xiaoqian shook his head. “The Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros is a spirit beast of heaven and earth. Its horn is also a spiritual item. It cannot be touched by tools of slaughter, or it will lose its spirituality. After so many years have passed, this horn’s spirituality has mostly faded. If you use your dagger on it, it will probably be destroyed.”

“You really know this much about it? Good thing you came, or this treasure would have been destroyed by our hands,” said Mo Nian gratefully.

Although Mo Nian and Long Chen had both heard of the Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros and also knew that its horn was an absolute treasure, they hadn’t known this taboo when it came to taking it. If it weren’t for Yue Xiaoqian, even if they had noticed the Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros, they would have destroyed this treasure.

As for Guo Ran and Xia Chen, they had never heard of this legendary race, so they were just watching like fools. Compared to the three of them, it seemed that they were fools who knew nothing other than their own profession.

They saw Yue Xiaoqian take out a comb. It looked as if it had been carved out of the finest jade, and it was extremely refined.

Using the teeth of this comb, she used it like a saw to lightly cut at the base of the horn. Curiously, as the comb moved according to a certain rhythm, the horn slowly loosened. Long Chen and Mo Nian were both dumbfounded.

“This is another gap in my learning. As expected, if a person wants to live long, they have to continue learning until they’re old,” praised Mo Nian. Yue Xiaoqian’s methods were so profound that he couldn’t even tell what principle she was basing this on.

The crack slowly grew. The horn looked like it was naturally falling. Ultimately, it landed in Yue Xiaoqian’s hand. The part it had fallen from was glossy and clean, without the slightest damage. It made them click their tongues in wonder.

Yue Xiaoqian lightly swung the horn through the air, and the tip cut a thin line in the void. It was like the void had been cleanly cut apart.

Seeing this, everyone cried out. So the legends were true. The Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros’s horn was capable of easily cutting through space.

“This is a life-saving divine item. I wonder if there’s a method to nourish it? Looking at it now, it seems that it can’t be used much before its spirituality runs out. If it was simply turned into trash, that would be far too wasteful,” said Mo Nian.

“As long as it is nourished by someone’s soul and isn’t used too frequently, its energy will naturally recover. After all, even though this Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros died countless years ago, its horn is still intact. That means that it was incredibly powerful when it was alive,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

After saying that, Yue Xiaoqian handed the horn to Long Chen with a smile.

“I’ll give it to you.”
