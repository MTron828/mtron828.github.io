Chapter 4457 Nether Emperor Son?

Netherdragon Tianzhao didn’t immediately flee after being saved by the nether dragon race’s experts. He simply focused on recovering, as he still wanted to beat Long Chen.

He knew that he had lost. However, as long as he could kill Long Chen, it wouldn’t count as a complete defeat. After all, the real goal extended beyond mere victory or defeat; it was about survival.

Hence, Netherdragon Tianzhao hoped that everyone could block Long Chen until he recovered. Being a Heavenly Doyen, he wouldn’t need that long to recover most of his energy.

As long as he recovered to sixty or seventy percent, adding on everyone else’s support, he could easily launch a sneak attack, and they could slay Long Chen together.

However, Netherdragon Tianzhao had never dreamed that Long Chen’s recovery would be almost instantaneous, facilitated by a single medicinal pill that swiftly restored him to peak condition.

The lifeless bodies of his many bodyguards now lay scattered on the ground, facing annihilation at the hands of Long Chen, and most of his race’s people had been slain. The moment Long Chen set his gaze on Netherdragon Tianzhao, an overwhelming sense of dread enveloped the latter, as though a harbinger of death itself were casting its gaze upon him.

Following that, Long Chen transformed into a bolt of lightning shooting at Netherdragon Tianzhao. The nether dragon race’s experts were powerless to stop Long Chen, and his father was still trapped by Ye Ling. In this dire situation, there was no one left to save Netherdragon Tianzhao.

A merciless glint appeared in Netherdragon Tianzhao’s eyes. Suddenly, he thrust his own forehead with his weapon.

The unexpected sight of Netherdragon Tianzhao mutilating himself left everyone in shock. He created a bloody hole in his forehead, and as his essence blood spilled out, Netherdragon Tianzhao abruptly slammed his hands together, chanting an incantation. A shroud of black qi then enveloped him.

“Long Chen, watch out! That’s the Nether Emperor’s aura! He’s a son of the Nether Emperor!” shouted Yu Qingxuan in terror.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist struck Netherdragon Tianzhao. However, to everyone’s shock, Long Chen’s full-power attack was unable to penetrate that black qi. Instead, he was forced back.

Long Chen was startled; this was not his first time encountering this black aura. He already saw it when he saved Yu Qingxuan.

“He’s a son of the Nether Emperor? Has he offered himself to the Nether Emperor?!”

Hearing that Netherdragon Tianzhao was a son of the Nether Emperor, countless people were shocked. The so-called sons and daughters of the Nether Emperor were the seeds that the Nether Emperor had left in the world.

When those seeds grew to a certain level, they would be recalled by the Nether Emperor. Nevertheless, some of these seeds would spontaneously emerge, while at other times, individuals could proactively seek and acquire them.

Some people would even offer their own children to be adopted by the Nether Emperor, yearning for the Nether Emperor’s karmic luck to bestow blessings upon them and alter their destinies.

These devoted individuals were all fervent followers of the Nether Emperor, and the Nether Emperor wouldn’t take the initiative to recall those seeds.

However, by actively seeking the Nether Emperor’s aid, Netherdragon Tianzhao surrendered himself, willingly consigning his fate to the Emperor’s influence.

“Damn you, Long Chen! Just you wait, I will return! When I come back, I will use the Nether Emperor’s power to slaughter you and your whole family!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao glared at Long Chen like he wanted to tear Long Chen into pieces. His voice underwent a transformation, taking on the sinister resonance of an evil fiend, saturated with curse power and resentment.

Within that black qi, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s aura completely changed, deepening significantly. An ancient power surged through him, instilling an instinctive terror in the depths of people’s souls. The experts present quivered in response to this overwhelming force.

The Nether Emperor, ruler of the Netherworld in the primal chaos era, held dominion over the rules of that realm—a supreme existence in this world. Hence, no one dared to fight him.

By sacrificing himself, Netherdragon Tianzhao obtained the protection of the Nether Emperor. Now, let alone Long Chen, even a Saint wouldn’t dare to touch him.

However, Netherdragon Tianzhao was slowly fading away. By offering himself as a sacrifice, he would vanish, and no one knew whether he would live or die.

Netherdragaon Tianzhao was filled with rancor. After all, he was different from Yu Qingxuan. If he reached the Eternal realm, he could have inherited the Nether Emperor’s ancestral tablet, becoming one of his followers.

However, the prerequisite was to reach the Eternal realm, yet before he could do so, in order to obtain the Nether Emperor’s protection, he sacrificed himself.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

If the Nether Emperor took a liking to his potential, Netherdragon Tianzhao would still have a chance to become one of his followers. However, if the Nether Emperor felt that he was too weak, he would likely be directly absorbed, fully gone from the world.

As a result, he harbored intense resentment toward Long Chen, the one who had ruined his bright future. While Netherdragon Tianzhao said that he would come back, he wasn’t sure of his survival chance.

Right now, he could only cast his hopes on the nether dragon race. If they could contribute significantly to the Netherworld, accomplishing meritorious deeds, then perhaps the Nether Emperor would give him a chance.

The Nether Emperors aura instilled such terror in the surrounding people that they were rendered immobile. Even Ye Ling and the trapped nether dragon race leader came to a halt in response to the overwhelming presence.

“The Nether Emperor? Is he so amazing?! If I want to kill someone, not even the Nether Emperor can stop me!” Long Chen suddenly roared and charged back at Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Long Chen, don’t!” Yu Qingxuan cried out. She had once been a daughter of the Nether Emperor, so she knew how terrifying the power covering Netherdragon Tianzhao was. It could even kill a Saint.

“Hahaha, foolish human, I’m right here! Come and kill me if you can!” Netherdragon Tianzhao hadn’t expected Long Chen to dare to attack him in this state. Delighted by the prospect, he deliberately provoked Long Chen.

As long as Long Chen dared to come over, he wouldn’t merely be sent flying. The Nether Emperor’s energy was intensifying, and any subsequent attack by Long Chen would likely kill him.

This energy didn't belong to Netherdragon Tianzhao; he was merely the sacrifice and couldn’t harness this power himself. However, he yearned to witness Long Chen be slain by this potent force.

Seeing Long Chen recklessly flying like a moth attracted to a flame, the Dragonblood warriors felt a tightness in their hearts.

However, they refrained from shouting at him. They understood that shouting would be futile—once Long Chen made a decision, no one could deter him. Any attempt at shouting would only serve as a distraction.

Yu Qingxuan covered her mouth, tears streaming down her face. She was fraught with worry, but she couldn’t stop Long Chen.

Everyone else was stunned to see this scene. Long Chen’s guts were truly terrifying. Challenging a supreme being from the primal chaos era went beyond mere courage—it bordered on sheer audacity.

When Long Chen appeared in front of Netherdragon Tianzhao, a golden lotus seed appeared above his head, and its golden divine radiance enveloped him.

Following that, a shocking scene occurred. Wreathed in that golden light, Long Chen’s arm passed through the black qi and grabbed Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“What?!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.
