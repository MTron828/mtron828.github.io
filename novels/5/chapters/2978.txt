Chapter 2967 Advancements

Luo Ning curled her lip, feeling unconvinced. But inside, she knew that Long Chen wouldn’t lie about such a thing. It was just that such a statement was extremely hard to accept.

“A strong general doesn’t lead weak soldiers. Brother San is so powerful, so the people under him definitely can’t be lacking,” said Mu Qingyun with a smile to get rid of the awkward atmosphere. “In any case, I really admire brother San. I’m going to work hard. I’m sure that under his guidance, I will get stronger. I’ll do whatever brother San says.”

“Suck up,” snorted Luo Ning quietly.

“Ning-er!” Luo Bing’s expression changed. She sternly said, “Quickly apologize to sister Qingyun.”

Mu Qingyun waved it off. “It’s fine. As he is my brother, it’s natural for me to suck up.”

Seeing that she wasn’t angry, Luo Bing felt a bit better. Ultimately, Luo Ning also apologized for saying such a thing. But she still refused to believe Long Chen. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The battlefield was quickly cleaned up, and over a hundred special devil cores were given to Long Chen. Those were the ones left behind by the elite devil creatures. It was also proof that they had really drawn over those terrifying existences.

Without Long Chen present, those elites would have at least caused hideous casualties, if not wiped them out entirely.

However, without Long Chen, they also wouldn’t have gone so deep into the battlefield and encountered such terrifying existences.

“Long Chen, that technique that you unleashed at the end was incredible. I still can’t believe that you wiped out all those devil creatures,” said Luo Ning. She was still puzzled. Although that technique was truly amazing, it didn’t make sense for that singular attack to wipe out all the powerful devil creatures in an instant.

Long Chen said, “I’ve encountered these devil creatures in the lower world. They are actually called power devils, and they possess strong physical bodies but very weak Spiritual Strength. Since I know their weakness, the power of my attack didn’t lie in the flame energy but in the Spiritual Strength within. This offensive Spiritual Strength then invaded their souls with the flames, killing them. Since I dared to bring you all here, I have absolute confidence in being able to bring you away as well.”

The reason why Long Chen had chosen this particular location and been so brazen as to draw so many of the devil creatures here was because he had checked the devil creatures and their weaknesses.

“A spiritual attack? Long Chen, you’re also a soul cultivator?” Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the others were shocked.

Long Chen was a pill cultivator, a flame cultivator, an Immortal cultivator, a lightning cultivator, and even his archery was so terrifying. Now, he had spiritual attacks as well? What else did he have up his sleeve?

Long Chen shook his head. “It’s just superficial tricks.”

Mu Qingyun was speechless. When Long Chen had first taught her sword arts, he had also said that they were just some superficial tricks. At that time, she had been vexed.

However, the superficial tricks as he called them could not be treated that way. The longer she knew him, the more unfathomable she found him to be.

“No need to be curious. I often had to fight the devil race in my world, so I have some experience against them. Let’s go back to the academy,” said Long Chen.

“We’re going back already?” Luo Bing and the others were surprised. They were leaving after just two fights? They should fight a bit more, no?

“Yes, after overdrafting your power like this, it would be best to rest a few days. Of course, it’s possible to rest here, but we also have other things to do, so let’s not waste time. Don’t worry about the transportation fee. It would be best not to skimp on money when it comes to certain things,” said Long Chen.

Every time you entered the devil battlefield, the transportation fee was not small, so most guilds would enter and not leave for ten days.

However, since Long Chen had put it that way, Luo Bing didn’t ask further questions. Once everyone was awake, they returned to the inner academy.

After returning, Long Chen had Luo Bing and Mu Qingyun take charge of recruiting. Both of their guilds were lacking powerful healers and archers. Without those two forces, Long Chen didn’t dare to bring them to stronger battlefields.

According to guild standards, they could recruit at most two thousand people. Then in Long Chen’s opinion, they would need at least fifty archers and fifty healers.

With such explosive growth, the Unfettered Alliance and the Luo Gate had drawn quite a bit of attention. Choosing a good guild was of paramount importance to a disciple. Before this, few people had bothered with these two alliances since their power was still unknown. But now that their ranking had instantly soared, many people would be clamoring to join. The two alliances could then pick the best of the best.

Many people were gossiping amongst themselves that such a sudden rise indicated that they would have no problem getting into the top hundred. Thus, even before the recruitment began, some people were ready to charge over.

The matter of the recruitment was left to Luo Bing, Mu Qingyun, and the others, so Long Chen brought everyone else to the Divine God Scripture to learn various techniques.

The money was paid by the disciples. After reading a technique once, Long Chen comprehended it and taught them. First were the archers. These people still didn’t meet the requirements to train in the Piercing Cloud Arrow, so he needed them to build a solid foundation first.

Those archers were dumbfounded. Long Chen didn’t seem to forget anything he read. He memorized any technique with one read and began to explain it to them.

For them to learn such a technique would require several reads to comprehend. But now with just paying once, they could all learn it. It saved a large amount of time and money. Long Chen’s way of explaining the techniques was also very brilliant. As a result, they were able to master the basics in a short time.

After learning over ten archery techniques, Long Chen called a stop to it. These fellows seemed to want to learn every single archery technique here, but Long Chen didn’t have so much time to waste.

Ten archery techniques were enough to build up a good foundation as preparation for the Piercing Cloud Arrow. After that, Long Chen sent the archers away to digest what they had learned.

Next was the healing arts of the wood and water cultivators. However, Long Chen didn’t have much experience with these techniques. He had no experience with wood and water cultivation techniques, nor did he want to research them and end up affecting his own cultivation path. Thus, they had to learn the techniques themselves.

As for the combat-related magical arts and divine abilities, Long Chen learned many of them. The disciples had pooled resources for Long Chen to learn and then teach them the techniques. The price wasn’t that bad when it was pooled together.

As a result, just like the archers, they wanted to learn every technique here. However, Long Chen only picked out ten rather practical fighting magical arts for them before shooing them off.

Long Chen remained here on his own, and he still had over ten million immortal crystals. Those were the Luo Gate and Unfettered Alliance’s disciples’ payments for medicinal pills.

With this much money, Long Chen went to the flame element region. Huo Long had grown much stronger, and now he needed some more flame magical arts.

Long Chen had only just arrived when he felt a venomous gaze. He turned over and sneered. “What, does your face not hurt?”
