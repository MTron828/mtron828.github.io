Chapter 2087 Surrounded by Beautiful Flowers

A woman slowly walked into the room. Her face was like a painting. Her robes were snow-white, while her black hair fell naturally past her shoulders, creating a stark contrast. She was like a transcendent immortal walking amongst the mortal world, but this beautiful fairy was too cold, so cold that her face was like ten-thousand-year-old ice that would never melt. Ice crystals revolved around her. Her eyes were like gems, but they contained endless iciness. One look from her felt like it could freeze a person’s soul.

This person was the Ice Fairy Ye Zhiqiu. Her icy glare made Xie Tianzi’s heart shiver. He slowly retracted his mental energy.

“You’re in my way,” said Ye Zhiqiu coldly.

Ye Zhiqiu’s arrival delighted Long Chen. So she had also been invited.

Xie Tianzi smiled slightly and didn’t continue. He walked to his seat.

Ye Zhiqiu gracefully walked over to Long Chen, but Long Chen had already gone over to welcome her.

“You’ve finally come out of seclusion.” Long Chen held Ye Zhiqiu’s hand, emotional. Her return signified that she would no longer have to go back to the Divine Ice Palace. She would be together with them once more.

A trace of warmth appeared in Ye Zhiqiu’s icy eyes. She nodded, tightening her grip on Long Chen’s hand. A faint rosiness appeared on her cheeks.

“Here, let me introduce you...” Long Chen hastily introduced Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang to Ye Zhiqiu. Ye Zhiqiu nodded. She was born icy, and as she cultivated, that icy nature only grew. She rarely ever spoke to others.

Ye Lingshan was an old acquaintance who knew that Ye Zhiqiu’s character was just like this. As for Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang, they could understand this iciness. Most ice cultivators were just like this.

Long Chen had the attendant add another seat. He and Ye Zhiqiu sat together, holding hands. Even in front of Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang, they were not acting bashful. Ye Zhiqiu blushed slightly, but she didn’t pull her hand back.

With Ye Zhiqiu present, Long Chen acted much less like a scoundrel. Beitang Rushuang was startled, not knowing how she felt about that.

With Ye Zhiqiu’s newfound control over her ice energy, it was no longer a struggle just to hold her hand. Last time, Long Chen had almost been frozen. Now, although he still felt a bone-chilling cold, it was endurable. He didn’t need to circulate his power to block it.

Long Chen had a stomach full of questions he wanted to ask Ye Zhiqiu, but now wasn’t the time.

Long Chen particularly cherished Ye Zhiqiu because back in the Jiuli secret realm, she had died in his arms. That scene was something he would never be able to forget in this lifetime.

Ye Zhiqiu’s addition to their seats drew quite a bit of attention. Most people were sitting by themselves. Only Long Chen’s side was filled with beautiful flowers who were also peerless geniuses. People were naturally envious.

When Zhao Wuji walked in and saw Long Chen holding Ye Zhiqiu’s hand, quietly whispering to her, while Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, and Ye Lingshan talked and laughed amongst themselves, flames of rage filled Zhao Wuji’s heart.

This was too exaggerated. Just how was it that Long Chen was surrounded by so many beautiful women, when every other person present was someone who had dominated their generation?

During their lives, wherever they went, others would follow. They were the brightest stars in the sky. However, at this gathering of past and present heroes, they found themselves ordinary.

As these top geniuses gathered, they were all lonely figures, maintaining an air of mystery and arrogance around them. But Long Chen actually pulled in a group of the greatest geniuses throughout history. Two of those were even from the everlasting families.

The geniuses had egos corresponding to how strong they were. The men who could be invited here were the main characters of their times. Today, they found themselves being reduced to supporting characters.

“Enjoy your final days. Once you die, there will naturally be someone to look after your women,” muttered Zhao Wuji.

Although he spoke as if muttering to himself, his voice was not quiet. It was loud enough for the entire auction room to hear.

Everyone turned to look at Long Chen. This was a provocation, and an extremely humiliating one at that.

Long Chen’s figure had already vanished from his original spot by the time they looked. He reappeared in front of Zhao Wuji and immediately kicked him.

Everyone jumped because of this sudden attack. Zhao Wuji was also started, not expecting Long Chen to really dare to attack him here.

BOOM!

Zhao Wuji was sent flying by Long Chen’s kick. He had been unable to properly use any force in his seat.

Although Zhao Wuji’s scale armor had appeared on his arms, blocking Long Chen’s kick, it was unable to stop Long Chen’s power from blowing him away. He crashed through one sturdy wall after another, breaking buildings and even some fake mountains.

Long Chen came flying through the hole he made, sending a powerful punch at Zhao Wuji’s face.

“Courting death!” Zhao Wuji roared furiously. He had been caught off guard before. Now his armor transformed, becoming covered in sinister blood-colored barbs.

“Stop!”

Just at this moment, the space between Long Chen and Zhao Wuji twisted. They were originally on track to striking each other, but somehow their positions shifted subtly just enough for them to miss.

Long Chen was startled. This was spatial power. It had resolved both their attacks without any fuss. This power was truly powerful.

“Brother Long, brother Zhao, are you trying to tear down my Dongfang family’s ancient city?”

A white-robed Dongfang Yuyang appeared, looking displeased. The other experts inside the room also came walking out, wanting to see how Dongfang Yuyang would resolve the current predicament.

Long Chen had struck the first blow in the room. That was clearly disrespectful to the Dongfang family. It could even be called a kind of provocation.

“Long Chen goes too far! He attacked me first!” roared Zhao Wuji.

“It was Zhao Wuji’s wretched mouth that went too far,” said Beitang Rushuang coldly. She was clearly standing on Long Chen’s side.

Just now, even Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue had been shocked. Long Chen had suddenly seemed to transform into a death god, becoming a demon who would slaughter devils and immortals. That fierce aura of his had made them jump.

The normally joking scoundrel had become a completely different person just now.

“Zhao Wuji, if you’re in a rush to reincarnate, I’ll help you out today. There’s no need for our fight to wait until after this gathering. We can start right now,” said Long Chen, his gaze as sharp as a sword.

“Long Chen has truly become infuriated. His greatest taboo is for others to threaten him, especially those closest to him. This Zhao Wuji has touched his reverse scale,” transmitted Ye Lingshan to Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue.

Ye Lingshan had a greater understanding of Long Chen. He could wave off other people’s threats toward him with a laugh, but if someone insulted his family? He would instantly explode.

The current Long Chen left a deep impression on Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang. Floating in the sky, his black robes and hair were whipping around him. He finally met the standards of how an expert should act.

Nangong Zuiyue’s eyes began to sparkle and unleash a few imperceptible ripples. She gradually smiled.

From Long Chen, she had comprehended a kind of Dao. A Dao of freedom, of being unrestricted, of transcending all bindings, a Dao that did not care what other people thought.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you? Pick any time and place! If I don’t kill you, I won’t be Zhao Wuji!”

Last time, Long Chen had slapped him in the face and used some pill toxin to turn his face black. Although he had managed to recover later, that enmity had not been forgotten. Zhao Wuji had never been humiliated in his life.

The countless strange gazes of the experts in that room as he had been kicked out infuriated him the most. Zhao Wuji was not actually acknowledged as deserving the same level of respect as the other supreme geniuses present. He was able to match them due to his viciousness and despicable means, but he didn’t have their high prestige. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, even those supreme geniuses didn’t want to provoke him. It was mostly due to his infamous reputation for his fearsome means.

To put it frankly, he had come to this gathering to shake the world and show everyone just how powerful he was, to make the name of the Mechanism Sect resound throughout the continent once more.

However, ever since he had encountered Long Chen, he had faced setback after setback and lost his face. That was completely different from his expectations. He now wanted to have a fight against Long Chen not just for vengeance, but also to prove how strong he was.

“Then come! Let’s fight outside the city!”

Long Chen stepped away, but just at that moment, a figure blocked his path. Long Chen was stunned, and all the other experts’ hearts involuntarily shook.
