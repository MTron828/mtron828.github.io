Chapter 2979 Nine Prefecture Convention

Long Chen arrived at Heaven Master Yun Yang’s immortal cave. He found that other than himself, nothing else was there. It was a barren place that looked lonely and cold. The only decoration was a worn-down grass prayer mat.

Long Chen was surprised by how simple his residence was. “Heaven Master Yun Yang, you were looking for me?”

“Sit.”

Heaven Master Yun Yang indicated the worn-down prayer mat. Seeing Heaven Master Yun Yang sitting on the bare ground, how could Long Chen possibly sit on the prayer mat? Hence, he also sat on the ground.

Heaven Master Yun Yang smiled. “A youngster who has reached the peak of fame who is proud, but not arrogant, is truly rare.”

Long Chen chortled. “Well, my temper depends on who it is. Furthermore, this little one’s abilities simply aren’t enough to be arrogant about even if I wanted to when compared to you.”

“The Heavenly Daos are like a sea. There is limitless knowledge to learn. For you to have a respectful heart indicates that you can walk even further on the martial path. This is a blessing for the academy, and a blessing for the human race…”

At this point, Heaven Master shook his head. “When a person gets old, they forget the point. I called you over because I wish to discuss a certain matter with you. I heard that you went to the Divine Scripture Pavilion and the Immortal Scripture Pavilion and learned quite a few magical arts?”

Long Chen’s heart shook. Had he been reported for helping the disciples learn techniques? He first learned the techniques, then taught them to the disciples of the two guilds. That had reduced the academy’s profits. Could it be…?

Heaven Master Yun Yang smiled and shook his head. “The academy’s rules are the rules. Don’t think the academy is so sinister. The academy’s rules are to allow for it to function. It’s not to squeeze money out of our disciples.”

“Hehe, yes, I helped the disciples of two guilds learn some magical arts. After all, I’m an instructor, and since I’m lacking money, I could only collaborate with the disciples. This was mutually beneficial. That’s not against the rules, right?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course it doesn’t count as breaking the rules. I’m simply amazed by your comprehension ability and your powerful soul. You could learn all those techniques without any effort. If I could give you a chance to read every book within the Divine Scripture Pavilion for free, how long do you think it would take you to learn everything?” asked Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“You… Really?” Long Chen was shocked.

“First tell me how confident you are.”

“One month, at most one month!” Long Chen was moved. He felt like an immense, wonderful thing was in the process of descending upon him.

“One month? Are you sure?” Heaven Master Yun Yang was shocked.

“I won’t rest or sleep. In one month, I can learn everything in the inner academy,” said Long Chen confidently.

After entering the Divine Flame realm, his Spiritual Strength hadn’t changed much. But his 108,000 stars had ignited their divine flames. It was like he had 108,000 soul receptors, so he could read as much as he wanted.

His 108,000 stars had gone through an inconceivable change, and he hadn’t even had a chance to test their new power. But memorizing books? That was definitely no problem.

“If that’s the case, then the matter I’m worried about should be resolved,” sighed Heaven Master Yun Yang in relief.

“Heaven Master, what good thing do you have for this little one?” asked Long Chen. Just the thought of reading everything within the Divine Scripture Pavilion for free was making his heart itch. He couldn’t wait.

When Heaven Master Yun Yang explained the situation to Long Chen, he almost didn’t believe it. Heaven Master Yun Yang actually wanted to break the rules and let him take the exam for the position of Heaven Master.

The High Firmament Academy was located in the Heavenly Swell Domain. It was also known as the Heavenly Swell Star-field. It was one of the ‘hundred domains’.

The immortal world had a hundred domains and a thousand prefectures. The domains were larger than the prefectures, but it wasn’t the case that every domain had prefectures within it. Only places that had the human race in them were called prefectures.

Some domains didn’t have humans. For example, the devil domain, the blood domain, the flame domain, the nether domain, etc. They were occupied by other lifeforms and were places that the human race couldn’t set foot into.

There were also some star-fields where the human race cohabited with other races peacefully, and other star-fields where they were in constant battle with other races.

The Heavenly Swell Domain had nine prefectures. The Ying Prefecture and the Sheng Prefecture were both located within it. As for the High Firmament Academy, it was located in the Martial Heaven Prefecture. Its name was the same as the Martial Heaven Continent. Long Chen still didn’t know if it was a coincidence.

The High Firmament Academy was the Martial Heaven Prefecture’s strongest sect, so the majority of this prefecture’s cultivators chose to join it.

However, disciples from other prefectures were also drawn over by its name. For example, the Luo family and the Chu family. Their disciples came from other prefectures, mostly due to the ancient tomes contained within the High Firmament Academy.

The High Firmament Academy was an exceedingly old existence. Hence, there were countless historical records inside it. It had built up an incredibly deep foundation. This was what the High Firmament Academy was famed for.

However, while it was rank one in the Martial Heaven Prefecture, in the Nine Prefecture Convention, its ranking was not ideal. It actually wasn’t even in the top ten.

The Nine Prefecture Convention was a grand competition held once every ten years. It was the strongest competition of the Heavenly Swell Domain, and there was still half a year until the next convention.

“Senior, you wish for me to participate in the Nine Prefecture Convention?” Long Chen was still confused. The inner academy had countless experts with monsters like Bai Shishi and Xu Changchuan. Why would the Heaven Master come looking for him?

“The Nine Prefecture Convention’s battle portion is for the Battle God Palace to worry about. But other than that competition, there is also the Nine Prefecture Dao Discussion. I hope for you to represent our academy’s instructors to discuss the Dao there,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“Discuss the Dao?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Long Chen was startled. When it came to talking big, he was alright. But to have him discuss the Dao in front of all the heavenly geniuses of the nine prefectures? Wouldn’t he be laughed at?

“Yes, go discuss the Dao as a representative of the academy. I was the representative in the last few conventions, but while the academy’s foundation is thick, it is hidebound by convention. In the current cultivation world, countless new marvels are born every day. The Heavenly Daos turn, and we can no longer keep up with the times. In the last discussion, someone posed some questions to me, and I was actually unable to respond appropriately. The era has changed. We old timers will naturally be replaced by a new generation of disciples. As for you, while you lack experience and knowledge, you have advantages that we old timers don’t have. You are not bound by our conventions. Thus, we are planning on taking the risk and having a young instructor participate this time, and you are the most suitable choice.”

“My mouth has no gatekeeper. I might say something that loses the academy’s face,” pointed out Long Chen.

“The academy doesn’t care about face, nor do we particularly care about competing with others. We only wish for you to participate in hope that you can come up with some new brazen ideas, instead of being stuck in the past like us. I suggested this to the institute head, and the institute head has reported it to the dean. Even the dean has said that it’s up to you. If you agree to represent the High Firmament Academy’s instructors in the Nine Prefecture Convention, we will give you the authority to read through every book in the inner academy. What do you think?” asked Heaven Master Yun Yang.

Long Chen had never expected such an opportunity. He hesitated and asked, “If I attend as an instructor, will I also have a chance to compete in the Nine Prefecture Competition? To tell the truth, I wish to get famous.”

The Nine Prefecture Convention was a gathering of heavenly geniuses. If he wanted to spread his name, this was the best option. The name of Boss Long San would spread far and wide. Perhaps he would be able to encounter the others as well. Thinking of that, a fire ignited in his heart.
