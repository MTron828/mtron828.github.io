Chapter 4182: Triple Supreme Heaven Dao Fruit

“Boss, what did you do? Those two cauldrons…?”

Xia Chen had secretly taken over the grand formation of the Soaring Dragon Company, transforming its sealing power into spatial transportation power. With it, they were instantly transported away.

Now, they were on the edge of the Sage King Prefecture and were sitting in a flying boat, going back to the High Firmament Academy’s ruins.

It was only now that Guo Ran had a chance to ask Long Chen about this matter. Both he and Xia Chen had been worried for a long time.

“Hehe, it was thanks to the Earth Cauldron’s help. How could we have known that the Earth Cauldron’s runes were so different from the Heaven Cauldron?” Long Chen chortled.

Hearing that, Xia Chen and Guo Ran finally understood. However, these words were spoken spiritually.

When it came to the Heaven Earth Cauldron, the fewer people that knew about it, the better. It wasn’t that Long Chen didn’t trust Mu Qingyun and the others, but the implication of this matter was too great. It was best not to inflict them with bad karma.

“Scamming people for money and then leaving really is the best feeling!” Guo Ran laughed excitedly.

Thinking of how so many people had been scammed by them, especially so many innate Heaven Venerates, he felt a strong sense of accomplishment.

“Sigh, I wonder how the Soaring Dragon Company is faring? I am really worried about them,” sighed Xia Chen.

“Hahaha!”

Everyone burst into laughter, delighting in their misfortune. After all, the matter of the Soaring Dragon Company secretly sacrificing people to the fiend eye was abominable. The sooner such a faction was destroyed, the better.

“We were lucky this time. After scamming the first one, we still had time for the second.” Long Chen smiled. It was his first time being able to scam people twice like this.

“Let’s divide the loot. You can have the Eternal divine weapons, and I’ll take the Eternal corpses.” Long Chen took out both world stones, putting the divine weapons in one and the corpses in the other.

When Xia Chen and Guo Ran took that world stone and saw the Eternal divine weapons inside, they almost cried out in excitement.

These things were priceless treasures to them, including the six weapons of the Ghost Dao. Even if they couldn’t use them, they could always study, research, and compare them.

Additionally, among the seven Eternal divine weapons from the second auction, three were crafted by the human race, while the remainder originated from the demonic beast race. Despite their item-spirits having long since perished, leaving them as nothing more than hollow shells, they were still incredibly powerful.

Not daring to take them out here, Guo Ran and Xia Chen could only wait until they were back and in a secret room.

Long Chen was also excited as he sent the corpses into the primal chaos space’s black soil. When these Eternal corpses appeared, the black soil seemed to grow extremely active, crazily devouring them.

It was like a gluttonous beast that was finally tasting good meat. Now, it was no longer willing to eat grass.

However, these corpses were enormous, and the black soil could only devour five at a time. Upon seeing this, Long Chen realized that the majority of these corpses belonged to the demonic beast race, and only a few were from the devil race.

As these corpses decomposed, the primal chaos space was filled with endless primal chaos qi. The Moon Trees and Fusang Trees crazily absorbed their life energy and grew rapidly.

Seeing this scene, Huo Linger cried out in excitement like a child being given endless snacks. The Sun Flames and Moon Flames had become so strong and robust.

The Heaven Merging Blood Lotus was rapidly reproducing as well. Its growth was even faster, and the lotus seeds would automatically fall and grow into a new lotus every time it matured. There was no need for Long Chen to do anything.

There was now a giant blood pool in the primal chaos space, filled with hundreds of Heaven Merging Blood Lotuses that were thrumming with life.

“It’s too bad that the crystal cores of these corpses have been turned to trash. Who knows how much energy would be in them? But if the crystal cores weren’t ruined, they wouldn’t sell them. Those pricks would definitely turn them into puppets or use faith energy to revive them,” sighed Long Chen.

At the same time, Long Chen had a brazen thought. An Eternal expert who had died countless years ago and whose crystal core was ruined could still release such an incredible amount of energy. What if it was a freshly slain Eternal expert? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As the Eternal corpses were devoured, Long Chen noticed the Heavenly Dao Tree and the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree changing.

The transformation was subtle, yet new runes had emerged on their leaves, accompanied by a divine radiance that enveloped them. One possessed a Yin essence, while the other exuded a Yang essence, creating a perfect and harmonious contrast.

“Damn, how did I forget about this?!”

Long Chen suddenly noticed several three-colored fruits at the top of the Heavenly Dao Tree.

“Triple Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruit!”

The Heavenly Dao was as amazing as ever. Within a certain range, the energy of any dying Triple Supremes was secretly absorbed, and this included all innate Heaven Venerates.

“Hehe, my Dragonblood Legion will eventually become a True Supreme Legion.” Long Chen grabbed those fruits excitedly.

As the corpses were devoured, the laws of the primal chaos space seemed to silently transform. With all kinds of energy being unleashed, the primal chaos space seemed to be using them to perfect itself.

When Long Chen checked on the Earth Cauldron in his spiritual space, he suddenly found that it was gone, leaving him in a cold sweat.

However, when he looked into the primal chaos space again, he was relieved to see that the Earth Cauldron had run over here, floating in the sky with the golden lotus seed.

Long Chen sighed with relief. “It seems that the Earth Cauldron wants payment for helping me scam those people.”

Although Long Chen didn’t know what the Earth Cauldron was doing, he knew that there must be something that it needed here.

Long Chen found that no further rust fell off of the Earth Cauldron. Instead, the rust was starting to melt and then slowly be absorbed by it.

When it came to the Earth Cauldron, Long Chen knew far too little about it. But there was one thing that he was sure of. Those corpses had to be beneficial to the Earth Cauldron, or it wouldn’t have run over to the primal chaos space.

At this moment, Xia Chen’s flying boat sped through the air and quickly approached the heart of the Sage King Prefecture. Because the grand formation belonged to the Soaring Dragon Company, Xia Chen had only managed to harness a portion of its power. As a result, he couldn't exercise perfect control over their direction and distance during transportation.

Fortunately, they hadn’t gone too far, and the direction was only a bit off. Now, they had to enter from the devil race’s territory. However, Long Chen and the others didn’t dare to just swagger through the devil race’s territory.

It had to be known that Long Chen had killed so many devil experts, accumulating the resentment of countless devils on him. Hence, upon spotting him, devil experts could sense how many of their people he had slain and would instantly attack him.

Also, in comparison to the demonic beast race, the devil race was more united. Long Chen might be able to cross through the demonic beast race’s territory, but he didn’t dare to pass straight through the devil race’s territory.

Therefore, they went around until they reached the human race’s territory. Once there, they prepared to take a shortcut to the High Firmament Academy’s ruins.

“Long Chen, face your death!”

The void quivered, and an overwhelming surge of death qi burst forth. The Ghost Dao expert then materialized, with black qi swirling around him.
