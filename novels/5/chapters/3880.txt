“Long Qinian?”

Long Chen hadn’t expected to run into this guy who was from the same generation as Xia Guhong.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Back in the Violet Flame Heaven Capital, Long Chen had slapped him in the face. But after that, Yu Qingxuan came, so Long Chen simply ignored him.

Later on, Long Qinian lost his patience and furiously attacked him. Long Chen then ended up guiding his attack toward that irritating Eunuch Wei, causing the latter to be injured.

Although the two had yet to truly exchange blows, Long Qinian possessed dragon blood power and was shockingly powerful. In his era, other than Xia Guhong, he had never had anyone else be a match for him.

Long Chen hadn’t expected to run into him here. Seeing his murderous gaze, Long Chen disdainfully said, “I, Long Chen, have been arrogant for a long time. What does it have to do with big brother Xia Guhong? But as for you, are you okay? Does your face not hurt?”

Long Qinian was enraged. The instant he thought of how he had been slapped in the face by Long Chen, his killing intent exploded like a volcano. He shouted, “Long Chen, come and face your death!”

“Little child, it seems that you’ve forgotten your lesson now that the pain has faded. Today, if I don’t beat the crap out of you, you can count your ass tough!” Long Chen had long since grown to hate Long Qinian. Long Qinian had despicably used Luo Qingying’s death to antagonize Xia Guhong. Due to this, Long Chen had been longing to beat him for a long time. Now, his chance had come.

Long Qinian pointed his spear at Long Chen, arrogantly saying, “Let’s cut the crap. Come and fight.”

“Ignore him. You have more important matters. Go around him,” said the dragon expert just as Long Chen was about to charge over.

“Ah? Isn’t our target this golden dragon?” Long Chen was startled.

“Ah??? This isn’t a sacred dragon. Furthermore, I’m not dead. How could I leave behind a corpse? Did your brain break in the last battle?” cursed the dragon expert.

“Oh, oh.” Long Chen clapped his forehead. He had been too shaken by this giant dragon’s aura, so he had thought that this was the molting of this dragon expert.

“Little child, just wait. I’ll put you in your place on my way back.” Long Chen obediently ignored Long Qinian and went around him.

“Gutless coward, you’re running?!” raged Long Qinian.

“Fool, if you have guts, then come fight me!” sneered Long Chen. He was no fool. He knew that this fellow was absorbing this dragon’s energy.

Most likely, he was in a special state and could not leave the dragon’s body. That was why he kept demanding Long Chen to come to him.

“You are just a gutless coward! You’re as gutless as your big brother Xia Guhong!” shouted Long Qinian.

“Shouting like a fishwife? I can’t be bothered to even pay you any attention.” Long Chen disdainfully ignored him. All of a sudden, he noticed another giant dragon in the distance. He instantly guessed that the reason this fellow wanted him to stay behind was to prevent him from touching those other dragon corpses. Long Qinian was quite greedy.

“Xia Guhong is trash, and you’re trash too! Xia Guhong’s beloved was killed, and you’re definitely not going to have a better end!” Long Qinian continued hurling abuse.

Long Chen’s expression instantly changed. His body froze in the air, and he looked back at Long Qinian. His killing intent instantly erupted. These words had touched upon his reverse scale.

“This fellow has obtained the inheritance of the ghost fox evil dragon. He’s crafty. He has set up a trap with that dragon corpse and is waiting for you to send yourself to your death. So keep ignoring him and hurry to my dragon scale. You can deal with him later,” urged the dragon expert.

Long Chen clenched his teeth furiously. “Your mouth really is slutty. Next time, I’ll tear it off!”

Long Chen directly shut off his senses to avoid being further antagonized. He was really close to losing his patience and charging over. But even if he killed Long Qinian, it wouldn’t be worth it.

Long Chen continued onward and saw another giant dragon corpse. This was also a dragon king’s corpse. Although it had been dead for so many years, its Blood Qi wasn’t withered at all. Its dragon might had yet to dissipate.

“There are three?!”

Just then, he spotted another giant dragon body. Long Chen was shocked.

“There are a total of eighteen immemorial dragon kings. They are in a circle. Just hurry up to the core,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen’s heart shook. There were actually eighteen immemorial dragon kings here? He instantly thought of the warriors of the Dragonblood Legion.

“Don’t be in a rush. Once you place a spiritual mark on my dragon scale, you can summon them. Otherwise, considering the distances involved, any other messages will fail to reach them.” The dragon expert seemed to see through Long Chen’s thoughts.

With Long Chen flying in the direction that the dragon expert indicated, it wasn’t long before he saw a blazing sun. That golden light illuminated the world, its light stabbing into the dome of the heavens.

“This is…”

Although Long Chen knew that this dragon expert’s reverse scale would definitely be a shocking existence, he still hadn’t expected this.

It was a giant reverse scale thousands of miles long. It was floating in the air, and the primal chaos qi was swirling around it like a protective barrier.

Furthermore, that terrifying divine might gradually appeared when he got closer. There was no dragon cry or berserk fluctuations. Instead, there was only silence. It was this silence that hid the power to destroy entire worlds.

It seemed to be in slumber. Once it was roused though, who knew what would happen?

A stabbing pain struck Long Chen’s physical body once he was closer. His Blood Qi then surged and oozed out of his flesh. Golden blood came out of his skin.

“What is going on?” exclaimed Long Chen.

“Don’t worry. Your dragon king essence blood is from the bloodline of my descendant. Although it's weaker, it's from the same source. Anyway, our dragon race’s bloodline grades are very strict. After seeing my true dragon blood, my descendant’s blood naturally retreats.”

Golden dragon blood oozed out of Long Chen’s body, forming golden chains that were like golden dragons wriggling toward that dragon scale.

The dragon expert continued, “When I told you to get that dragon scale, it was preparation for today. This dragon blood is the bridge that will awaken my dragon scale.”

As Long Chen’s dragon blood continuously flowed out of his body, he quickly started to get dizzy. He felt weak as his dragon blood was sucked dry.

Eight chains now flowed out of his body and toward the dragon scale. Just when Long Chen felt like he would faint, those chains finally pierced the barrier of primal chaos qi and struck the dragon scale.

The eight blood chains instantly ignited. Long Chen could only grunt in pain, and veins throbbed on his forehead. At the same time as his essence blood was ignited, his soul was burning as well.

However, he knew that this was the only way to awaken the dragon scale. He could only endure.

Suddenly, the silent dragon scale quivered ever so slightly. Following that, countless runes lit up on it, and the space around the dragon scale fractured.

“Quick, place a spiritual mark. Don’t shatter this barrier of primal chaos qi, or everyone in the three thousand worlds will be drawn over!” ordered the dragon expert.

The half-unconscious Long Chen was instantly startled awake. After forming hand seals, his Spiritual Strength gushed toward the dragon scale.
