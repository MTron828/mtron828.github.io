When Long Chen arrived before the transportation formation he had come to years ago, he was stunned by the sea of people he saw.

These experts were all at the Life Star realm. Every one of them was a terrifying Empyrean. He guessed that there were no less than a million of them.

“How is this fucking possible?” Long Chen couldn’t believe his eyes. Had he gone crazy, or had the world gone crazy? Just where had these people come from?

The ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, the ancient family alliance, they had all sent tens of thousands of experts each. Hence, many of those experts were foreign faces to him.

However, he quickly saw some clues. The closest group of people to him were from the ancient races, and he saw many familiar faces in that group. Those people had once fought against the Dragonblood Legion.

About a tenth of those people were the ones he recognized, but the rest didn’t look familiar to him.

“I get it!” Long Chen suddenly realized what was going on. He had heard from Qu Jianying that the other powers of the continent were not completely united. Only a portion of their forces were controlled by their leaders.

Taking the ancient races as an example, although Long Juncang was the leader of the ancient races, he only controlled a portion of them. Many ancient races wouldn’t participate in any fights even if he tried to order them.

Originally, he had thought those races that didn’t listen to his orders were only a small fraction. But in truth, the ancient races were numerous. They weren’t actually as united as they appeared to be on the surface, and so they also had some internal battles. Some races were also very low-key, afraid of being viewed as threats too early, so they had quietly grown stronger.

Although the Long Juncang led the ancient races, several extremely terrifying figures within the ancient races were secretly raising their own forces. They might even be waiting for a suitable opportunity to overthrow Long Juncang and take his position. As for Long Juncang, one reason he wished to become one with the Xuan Beasts was not just for the feeling of returning to his ancestors but also to consolidate his own position amongst the ancient races.

Those races and powers had been secretly accumulating power, but with Pill Valley sharing their god inheritance with everyone, they were unable to continue hiding. They began to appear one by one.

In truth, it wasn’t just Long Chen who was stunned. Even the ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, and the other powers of the continent were stunned. They didn’t know that they possessed so many geniuses.

As for the geniuses of the neutral powers, they were present in even greater numbers. That was because many of the Righteous path’s sects had actually switched to become neutral powers and reduce the possible risk.

There were also some Righteous sects that directly joined Pill Valley’s side while still flying the banner of the Righteous path. They simply said that they could not exist under the Martial Heaven Alliance led by Qu Jianying. They wished to topple the Martial Heaven Alliance and rebuild the Righteous path.

Those Righteous sects had become Pill Valley’s subordinates. They would do whatever Pill Valley wanted them to do, and they were even more obedient than dogs. The people from the Corrupt path, the ancient races, and the other powers all looked down on them.

Although they were looked down upon, they had a direct connection to Pill valley, and so they would get some special treatment when the Brahma secret realm opened.

It was said that the powers that had allied themselves with Pill Valley were given special tablets for the Brahma secret realm. Those tablets were supposed to allow them to enter special areas inside, but Pill Valley hadn’t been too clear on the exact details.

In any case, Pill Valley’s meaning was clear. If you followed them, they wouldn’t let you suffer. If you didn’t follow them, then don’t follow the Martial Heaven Alliance either, and they would allow you to enter the Braha secret realm. But as for the best stuff inside? Sorry, but that was only for their people.

When Long Chen arrived, countless cold gazes turned toward him. Many of those gazes were filled with hostility. Some people even probed him with Spiritual Strength, which was a naked provocation.

As expected, this was one of the iron laws of the cultivation world. No matter what appearance he took, he wasn’t an exception.

Long Chen suddenly went crazy, smashing one horned man of the ancient races with his rod.

“What, you have a problem with me? I’ll beat the crap out of you!” shouted Long Chen. This person had tried to use Spiritual Strength to investigate him. Even the real Man Batian wouldn’t be able to endure such a thing.

The surrounding experts jumped in shock. This Man Batian was truly violent to start a fight here.

That ancient race expert hadn’t expected Long Chen to suddenly strike, and so he was sent flying, hacking up blood.

“Man Batian, you are courting death!”

All the ancient race experts were infuriated. They didn’t know what that horned man had done to draw his ire, and they thought that Man Batian was simply provoking them. Over a hundred thousand experts of the ancient races took out their weapons.

“Hahaha, do you think a little brat like him can probe me with their soul? Not killing that idiot was already giving face to the ancient races. If you want to fight because of it, then I’ll accompany you!” Long Chen raised his rod, unafraid of the surrounding experts.

“It is not permitted to raise weapons in front of the gates to Pill Valley. Don’t blame my Pill Valley for being merciless and expelling you if you break this rule.”

A cold shout rang out. Some of Pill Valley’s experts were startled by this disturbance and came out to stop him. After all, this was Pill Valley’s territory, and the Brahma secret realm also belonged to Pill Valley. If others wanted to enter, they had to be obedient. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Through Pill Valley’s investigation, upon hearing that this expert had used his Spiritual Strength to probe others, those ancient race experts could only snort and put away their weapons. Using Spiritual Strength to probe others was definitely a provocation. It was like looking through a person’s clothes. Even if the other side wasn’t a woman, it wasn’t possible to accept such an insult. Even if the victim wasn’t someone as violent as Man Batian, they wouldn’t be able to endure it. But while the experts of the ancient races put down their weapons, they still glared at Man Batian with hostility.

It didn’t matter who was wrong or right. As long as someone attacked the ancient races, it would be viewed as disrespectful to all the ancient races. This enmity would be remembered.

Compared to the human race, the ancient races were definitely more united. Even if they had some internal battles, at least no one looked at the unfortunate fellow with delight at his misfortune or hit him while he was down. Just this one point of theirs was far superior to the human race.

In the face of the ancient races’ hostility, Long Chen merely sneered. Holding his rod, he walked over to the neutral camp.

“Fuck, so even I ended up standing in the neutral camp?” Long Chen sighed.

There were over a hundred thousand experts in the neutral camp, but Long Chen didn’t get any greeting. The majority of them treated him warily, with some even looking at him with disgust. However, that suited him. He sat down in an empty space.

Looking around, he sighed inside, “The human race is actually so large, but we’re fractured, allowing even the ancient races and the Xuan Beasts to look down on us.”

The neutral camp’s experts, the ancient family alliance’s experts, and the traitors of the Martial Heaven Alliance were all humans. At the very least, they numbered over five hundred thousand. If all that power was added onto the Martial Heaven Alliance, who would dare to fight them?

However, humans were truly curious beings. They always liked to fight amongst themselves, wanting to be one step above the others.

There were over a million experts gathered here. If they joined forces and attacked the Martial Heaven Alliance, that would be an unprecedented tribulation. There would be no way to stop them.

Even if Yu Xiaoyun only managed to control half of them, it would be enough to flatten the Martial Heaven Alliance. Long Chen sighed. Yu Xiaoyun’s schemes were truly amazing. Even as his enemy, Long Chen had to feel some admiration.

“I’ll have to think of some way to ruin his plans. Otherwise, if the Martial Heaven Alliance falls, my Dragonblood Legion might not be able to stay standing.”

Long Chen found that quite a few people amongst these experts gave him a fair bit of pressure. The Martial Heaven Continent was filled with hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Many figures amongst these experts were on True Immortal Jiaoqi’s level.

If Long Chen exposed his identity, he would probably have difficulty leaving alive. All the monsters of the continent had gathered here.

This was all outside of Long Chen’s expectations. Who would have thought that the Martial Heaven Continent had been hiding so many geniuses?

Long Chen had just sat down when he saw Xiong Tianba walk in and join the Xuan Beasts. He cast a hateful glance at Long Chen, looking like he wanted to tear him to pieces.

Following Xiong Tianba’s arrival, a large group of experts also arrived. Those were the spectators of the battle, and once they began to spread out and spread news of Man Batian’s battle against Xiong Tianba, countless gazes turned toward Long Chen.

With them communicating through divine sense, this news quickly spread throughout everyone present.

Following them, Long Chen saw Lu Zichuan, as well as his old acquaintance, Di Feng. Di Feng still appeared as majestic as ever. He was currently greeting people within the ancient family alliance.

He also saw Xie Luo and Yan Wei. They were the only ones remaining of the peak experts that had once attacked him. Their auras were even stronger than when they had fought him. Most likely, they had advanced further into the Life Star realm, while Long Chen was still stuck in his original spot.

After six hours of waiting, one of Pill Valley’s elders walked up. “Everyone, the time has come. Please follow me into Pill Valley.”

Finally, it was time to enter Pill Valley. The experts present couldn’t help feeling excited. They had great expectations for the Brahma secret realm.
