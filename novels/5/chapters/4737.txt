Chapter 4726 Conceited Genius

When the two elders walked onto the platform, even the Enforcement Elder looked very solemn.

“The one guiding the way is our hall master, and the one beside him is the emissary from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven,” transmitted Qian Feng.

Idiot!

Long Chen immediately cursed him inside. As expected, the two big shots immediately turned to stare in their direction, causing Qian Feng’s heart to stop beating for a moment.

Why would he try to send secret messages in front of powerful Sage Kings? Was he trying to get himself killed?

Fortunately, he hadn’t exposed any particular secret; otherwise, Long Chen would have killed him himself. Thankfully, the hall master seemed reluctant to cause a scene in front of the emissary, so after shooting over a warning look, he didn’t do anything else.

The hall master of the Soul Assassination Hall was a middle-aged man with a slender build, yet his gaze possessed a menacing intensity, deceitfully sharp like an unsheathed blade.

Long Chen could sense that this individual was a formidable Sage King from his powerful fluctuations.

Just then, the hall master’s voice reverberated through the space as he announced, “Today marks a crucial gathering of the Soul Assassination and Blood Assassination Halls. We have the honor of hosting the divine emissary from Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s Human Palace, who will explain the state of the world to us and outline our future strategies.”

After delivering the announcement, the hall master retreated, his expression not looking very good as he left the proceedings to another elder, also a Sage King.

While this elder’s power was inferior to the hall master’s, his demeanor exuded such arrogance that suggested he didn’t even place the hall master in his eyes.

As the divine emissary took the stage, he cleared his throat and cast a cold gaze over the assembled crowd. He coldly started, “Before this meeting begins, I need to state a fact for you all. With your strength now, all of you would be nothing more than cannon fodder in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.”

The blatant disrespect elicited quite a few twitches from the crowd. After all, all of them were the elites of the Lifehunter race, and many of them had gotten important positions from a very young age.

However, this divine emissary viewed them as nothing, and they couldn’t express their discontent here. Seeing their reactions, the divine emissary curled his lips. “I see mediocre people here, lax and lazy. Some of you even dare to transmit messages before this divine emissary. You are so foolish that there is no cure.”

Qian Feng’s complexion instantly paled. If he left a bad impression on this divine emissary, he would be doomed.

“I know what you guys are thinking, but do you know how experts are born? You brat, the one with legs above your head, answer me!”

The divine emissary's sudden roar thundered through the plaza, causing everyone to jump in surprise. All eyes turned toward Long Chen, who was lounging nonchalantly with his legs still propped up on the chair in front of him.

“Long San, put down your feet!” advised Qian Feng hastily. He was sweating.

However, Long Chen ignored his warning. Facing the divine emissary’s furious glare, he casually said, “The most important thing for experts is to grasp every opportunity to get stronger. You can’t allow any chance to slip by. If there are no opportunities, you have to find a way to make them. Experts are the results of countless opportunities piled on top of each other.”

The divine emissary was startled to hear such a refined answer.

Seeing his reaction, Long Chen sneered inside. The little play happening before him was extremely simple; only an idiot wouldn’t be able to see through it.

“That is right. Experts are seizers and creators of opportunities. Then do all of you realize that this meeting today will decide your future? It might even decide whether you live or die.”

The divine emissary’s words startled everyone. They had thought it was nothing more than an ordinary meeting, but when they understood its importance, they instantly sat up straight and listened intently.

“It is your attitude that will ultimately dictate your fate. Without a good attitude, how do you expect to face the challenges posed by the Sovereign Emperor Heaven? You won’t even be able to protect yourselves, let alone wipe out the violet blood race and dispel our ancient disgrace!” shouted the elder.

“Your words are lacking!” exclaimed Long Chen as he shook his head.

Qian Feng almost pissed himself. He shouted countless times inside. Brother Long San, Boss Long San, Grandpa Long San, I beg you, stop messing around, or your brother will be implicated as well!

“Oh? How exactly are they lacking? If you don’t give me a reasonable answer, your head will fall today,” snorted the emissary, his patience wearing thin. His urge to kill this troublemaker just doubled.

Meanwhile, the hall master regarded Long Chen with a hint of suspicion, sensing that something was amiss.

In front of the divine emissary’s murderous glare, Long Chen remained unfazed as he spoke. “You claimed that true strength lies in seizing opportunities and that attitude determines everything. You accused me of appearing sloppy and lazy. But in truth... you are entirely correct. I am indeed sloppy and lazy.”

“You...!”

Just as the divine emissary was about to kill him, Long Chen raised his hand. “Did you ever think why amongst these hundreds of thousands of people, only I dare to act sloppy and lazy?”

The divine emissary was baffled, but he still took the bait. “Why?”

“Because I want to make myself stand out. Look, other than the hall master, the person who gives you the strongest impression here is me, correct?” Long Chen shrugged.

“Are you intentionally drawing my attention?” asked the divine emissary with narrowed eyes.

“Of course. Using this method to draw other people’s attention is childish, but as long as I can achieve my goal, then anything goes. I know I’ve given you a bad impression, but that’s fine. Just leaving an impression is enough because in a bit, you will see what is so special about me,” replied Long Chen.

The divine emissary calmly nodded and stated, “Another conceited genius? Good, I like that kind of character. If you really have some talent, I don’t mind breaking the rules to promote you. I can even accept you as a disciple. However, if you’re actually a piece of trash, don’t blame me for being vicious.”

Long Chen rolled his eyes inside. Idiot. Even if you were to kneel on the ground and beg me, I wouldn’t take you as a disciple.

As Long still wanted to hear the contents of this meeting, he didn’t respond to the divine emissary’s statement. The divine emissary also stopped paying him any attention as he continued, “Today, let this meeting start with one arm!”

A sword materialized in the divine emissary’s hand. With a swift stroke of the blade, an arm on the platform was severed, flying into the air. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hall master!”

Other than Long Chen, everyone else let out startled cries. The divine emissary had actually cut the hall master’s arm off.
