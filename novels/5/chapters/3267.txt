Chapter 3256 Yin Soldiers Through the Dao

“Don’t move!”

Long Chen sent a message to everyone and then silently looked at those corpses. After looking around, the corpses returned to their original immobile state.

Once they were no longer moving, Bai Xiaole and the others sighed with relief. Although Qin Feng and Qi Yu had followed Long Chen the longest and were unafraid of death, they were also covered in cold sweat at this moment.

“Boss, what are these things?” whispered Qi Yu.

“Based on your understanding, they should be called death spirits. You ran into some on the Martial Heaven Continent. However, these death spirits seem to lack spirituality. They really are like corpses, but the flame of their souls has yet to fully extinguish. Amongst death spirits, there are also great differences. There’s a line of text in an ancient book of the academy, Yin Soldiers Through the Dao. They seem quite similar to that record,” said Long Chen.

“Yin Soldiers?”

Bai Shishi’s expression changed. “That’s one of the six Daos, the Ghost Dao. It shouldn’t exist in the same world as us. How can we see them?”

“Humans and ghosts are on different planes. They should not be able to cross, just like how day and night cannot appear at the same time. However, Yin Soldiers Through the Dao refers to activities of the night appearing in the day. That is why it is called Through the Dao. Such a thing only exists in legends. I didn’t expect to run into it here,” said Long Chen.

“We’re seeing something that we shouldn’t see. That invokes a huge amount of karma. We should hurry up and leave,” said Bai Shishi, her face growing increasingly pale.

“You’re being foolish. What are you so afraid of? What’s so wrong with invoking karma? Without planting a seed, how will you harvest anything? Without harvesting it, how will you know whether the result is good or not? Since we don’t know the future, we can’t know if this is good or bad. Moreover, since we’re already here, we can’t leave just like this,” said Long Chen.

“Then what do you want to do?” asked Bai Shishi, her voice quivering.

Long Chen hadn’t expected someone as powerful as Bai Shishi to be so afraid of these death spirits. It was very unexpected to him.

However, it seemed that amongst everyone here, he was the only one who wasn’t afraid of the death spirits. That was because he had thunderforce that restricted them. But Bai Shishi’s metal energy seemed to be a poor match for death spirits. Furthermore, no matter how strong she was, she was still afraid of the unknown within the domain of death. This was simply natural.

Long Chen eyed these lifeforms. Based on his estimation, when they were alive, they were definitely at the Immortal King realm or perhaps even higher.

There were tens of thousands of them. However, as he looked around, all he saw were more corpses. He didn’t see any treasures.

Long Chen looked at the mast, sail, and ropes. They were all treasures, but after the passing of so many years, they were no longer useful.

Seeing Long Chen’s gaze roving around, Bai Shishi was speechless. This fellow was crazy, no? He wanted to steal something from this place?

Even after looking for a long while, he didn’t see anything valuable. However, just then, he spotted a sword in the embrace of a corpse.

The sword was covered in dust, so he couldn’t see what its original appearance was. However, when he used his soul to investigate it, his hair stood on end. That sword gave him an extremely dangerous sensation.

“A treasure!”

With Long Chen’s years of experience snatching treasures, he was sure that this sword was extraordinary. He looked around again and didn’t see any other treasures on the Ghost Ship. The other lifeforms didn’t have anything on their bodies.

“All of you stay here. I’m going in.”

Long Chen waved to them and climbed over the railing. He rushed over. When Bai Shishi saw Long Chen’s actions, she turned ice-cold. Just how big were this fellow’s guts?

Once Long Chen jumped up, those lifeforms turned to look at him. Bai Shishi almost screamed.

However, curiously, those lifeforms only looked at him and didn’t attack. It was as if their heads were spoiled and they were unable to even think.

Long Chen rushed over to the lifeform with the sword. He grabbed it, but that lifeform was holding onto it so tightly that he couldn’t take it.

“Hey, don’t be so stingy. You’re already dead. Don’t hog the toilet if you’re not going to poop.” Long Chen pulled harder.

The sword was finally wrestled free from that lifeform’s grasp. The sword was covered in dust, but as soon as it was in his hand, the dust fell, revealing golden patterns. After that, light flowed on top of it, filling the ship.

“What a good sword!”

Even after all this time, the scabbard’s divine runes had yet to fade. This was definitely a divine weapon.

Before he could examine it closely, the lifeform that had been holding the sword suddenly opened its eyes. Its eyes actually hadn’t withered. When it opened its eyes, Long Chen’s soul almost exploded.

“Fuck!”

Without a second thought, Long Chen transformed into a bolt of lightning, fleeing. He shouted at everyone.

“I’ve got the treasure! Let’s go!”

Bai Xiaole and the others immediately rushed down the Ghost Ship. After Bai Xiaole summoned the Deep Sea Devil Shark, they prepared to flee.

BOOM!

Just then, lightning exploded and Long Chen shot out like a cannonball, smashing into the flying boat.

Bai Xiaole immediately ordered the shark to rush away.

“Boss, you’re injured!”

Qin Feng cried out. A bloody hole had appeared in Long Chen’s shoulder. Moreover, fresh blood soaked his upper body.

“Don’t look back!”

Bai Shishi and the others were turning back to look at the Ghost Ship when Long Chen shouted. Hearing this command, they immediately fixed their heads in the opposite direction.

Long Chen himself turned back to see the master of the sword standing at the prow of the Ghost Ship. His eyes were cold and emotionless. It was as if they could see through a person’s soul.

The reason why Long Chen didn’t want Bai Shishi and the others to look back was because he was afraid that if they saw those eyes, they would see them in their nightmares. Those eyes would then turn into a heart-devil that they couldn’t forget.

However, just as he expected, that lifeform was unable to leave the Ghost Ship. The Ghost Ship sailed away until it was nothing more than a black speck in the distance. After that, the sky brightened once more.

With the sky brightening up, it was as if nothing had happened at all. It was like all that was a nightmare that they had woken up from. It made them question whether or not it was real.

If they didn’t see that Long Chen was covered in blood, they really would feel like it had been nothing more than a dream.

“Boss, how is your wound?”

Qin Feng saw black liquid dripping out of his wound. It was starting to rot. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Long Chen still felt some lingering fear. “Damn, things almost collapsed just now. That fellow was very likely a World King! Take note of the surroundings, I’m going to heal.”

Long Chen then took out his bone saber and began to cut off his rotting flesh.
