Chapter 1927: 1927

Huo Lieyun’s manifestation shook . The two statues within it seemed to possess their own life now .

“His manifestation is just one step from being fully awakened!”

The Netherpassage experts let out startled cries . The current Huo Lieyun was truly like a god of fire .

There was one extremely strict requirement for fully awakening one’s manifestation, and that was to at least have reached the Life Star realm . After breaking through, Huo Lieyun’s manifestation had increased in power, and the divine might coming out of it even affected these Netherpassage experts .

“Not good . This bastard’s manifestation is completely crushing what Heavenly Dao energy we can absorb,” said Mo Nian gravely .

Now there wasn’t just a cultivation base difference . Even in terms of manifestation, they were completely crushed .

“Hmph, one toad after another at the bottom of a well . In front of me, you’re just ants . Just by myself, I can crush all of you!” declared Huo Lieyun . His flame spear exploded with light and pierced down toward them .

Ye Zhiqiu’s ice sword unleashed a sky of ice and snow to block this fiery attack . However, the ice and snow instantly vanished in front of Huo Lieyun’s flames . Ye Zhiqiu was then forced back nine consecutive steps, her body covered in dense steam .

“Hmph, do you think this is still the Yin Yang World? My flame domain can melt all things . Your ice domain can’t bear a single blow from me!” shouted Huo Lieyun . The two statues behind him suddenly formed hand seals, and flame energy enveloped this space .

Yue Zifeng suddenly attacked . There was no pressure from his attack, but his Sword Qi contained the will of the sword . It tore through the sky, even splitting Huo Lieyun’s flame domain .

“Oh?” Huo Lieyun was startled . He hadn’t thought that anyone’s attack would be able to break his manifestation . He raised his spear .

BOOM!

The Sword Qi shattered, but a line of blood flowed out of the corner of Huo Lieyun’s mouth . He was actually injured .

“Die!” Huo Lieyun was startled and infuriated . Yue Zifeng’s attack was too bizarre and was actually able to ignore the power of his domain . With a howl, a giant spear-image shot toward Yue Zifeng .

A giant arrow smashed into the spear-image . However, it exploded upon contact, and the spear-image didn’t even slow down .

“What?” Mo Nian was shocked . His full-strength attack was actually unable to shake Huo Lieyun’s attack . The difference was too great . Huo Lieyun’s anger had provoked him into using his full power .

“Everyone, watch out! Huo Lieyun’s manifestation has greatly reduced the effect of our manifestations . We don’t even have seventy percent of our normal attack power!” Meng Qi sent a hasty spiritual message to everyone .

Huo Lieyun’s attack was about to strike Yue Zifeng, and considering that Yue Zifeng’s defense was weak, there was no way that he could receive it . A black light sword shot out as Cloud tried to receive the attack .

At the same time, willow branches appeared in front of Yue Zifeng, forming a giant shield .

BOOM!

Cloud’s attack crumbled, and Liu Ruyan’s shield exploded . Yue Zifeng slashed his sword, and after going through Mo Nian, Cloud, Liu Ruyan, and Yue Zifeng’s attacks, Huo Lieyun’s attack finally exploded .

However, Yue Zifeng also coughed up blood from the impact, which made the Dragonblood warriors’ hearts sink .

If others were injured, they could use Heavenly Dao energy to heal . But Yue Zifeng wasn’t an Empyrean or a Celestial and couldn’t heal . Being injured could be fatal for him .

“A group of trash . Come at me together, and I’ll show you that the world’s number one legion is just a rabble of ants!”

Huo Lieyun attacked once more . All the surrounding flame energy was absorbed in an instant by this attack .

In the face of this terrifying attack, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Gu Yang, and the others were all forced to take action, but they were all sent flying .

“Do you see? This is the power of a Life Star expert, world energy that controls the Heavenly Daos . Do you know the difference between us now?” Huo Lieyun laughed mockingly .

“Bastard, if I also advanced to Life Star, I’d kill you with a fart!” cursed Mo Nian as he flew back, but he also coughed up a mouthful of blood .

Suddenly, all the Dragonblood warriors began to shine . They summoned their Dragon Blood Battle Armor, and Guo Ran roared .

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

However, this terrifying attack containing all their power was shattered by a single swing of Huo Lieyun’s spear . All the Dragonblood warriors turned pale as paper . Some of them were even tottering on the verge of collapse . All their energy was actually unable to contend with Huo Lieyun .

Suddenly, one spear-image after another shot out at Mo Nian, Yue Zifeng, and the others, once more sending them flying .

“Heavenly Dragon Flame Net!”

Huo Lieyun raised a hand, and a net made of weaving flames captured Ye Zhiqiu, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er .

“As long as I capture Long Chen’s women, I’m not worried about him showing himself . If he doesn’t show himself, I don’t mind sending him a few green hats, hahaha...”

Huo Lieyun had actually condensed the surrounding flame energy into a giant net . He pulled it toward him . The four of them struggled, but it was useless . Ye Zhiqiu was surrounded by steam as she summoned her ice energy, but she was completely suppressed .

“Bastard, release my sisters!” Liu Ruyan and the Dragonblood warriors roared, but their attacks landed on a giant flame wall that forced them back .

Suddenly, sword-light appeared, creating an opening in the barrier . The bloodstained Yue Zifeng was flying back, his expression icy .

Of them all, only Yue Zifeng wasn’t suppressed by Huo Lieyun’s manifestation, and he was the only one who could possibly threaten him . Regretfully, he was still too weak .

“I didn’t expect Long Chen to have such a loyal dog . Alright, then I’ll use your blood as a challenge to Long Chen!”

Huo Lieyun pulled the net with one hand, while he threw his flame spear with his other hand .

A trail of flame runes followed the flame spear as it flew through the air, igniting the space it passed . Let alone a physical body, even a star could be pierced by this spear .

“Zifeng!” Everyone let our heart-rending roars . If this attack struck, Yue Zifeng would definitely die . Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, the rapidly flying flame spear suddenly stopped in midair, and the Netherpassage experts guarding this region jumped in shock . Their barrier had actually been broken by somebody .

Flames exploded and space twisted . The flame spear was actually unable to advance any further because a large hand had caught its tip .

A blood-soaked figure appeared in front of everyone’s eyes . That figure looked like a devil god that had crawled out of hell .

“Boss!” The Dragonblood warriors cheered . Although the flames blocked their vision, they could sense that familiar aura .

“Long Chen!” Those Netherpassage experts were dumbfounded . Long Chen had actually returned, charging through their barrier .

Long Chen’s hand tightly gripped the spear . It trembled intensely, erupting with flames, seeming to try to escape his grasp . However, it couldn’t .

Although Long Chen’s body looked like it was covered in blood, in truth, that blood wasn’t flowing outside his body, instead, it was flowing within . His blood was flowing through him like tiny dragons swimming . The power of his Blood Qi caused the void to rumble .

“What terrifying essence blood!” exclaimed one of the Netherpassage experts . He was from the Xuan Beasts, and Long Chen’s current Blood Qi terrified him . He couldn’t help but tremble and have an urge to flee for his life .

As Long Chen’s blood flowed within his body, his skin was constantly being torn apart and healing . It was a frightening sight, but it was like his Blood Qi would explode at any moment and destroy the world .

The azure dragon essence blood had rebuilt his body, but it still needed to fully merge with his blood . However, Long Chen couldn’t wait any longer, and he had rushed over immediately . Because his body hadn’t fully merged with the dragon blood before moving, it was tearing his body apart .

Long Chen’s arrival also shocked Huo Lieyun . What was more shocking though was that his divine item was actually completely terrified and wanting him to save it .

Suddenly, Long Chen’s other hand reached out and grabbed the spear . Then, shockingly, he slammed the spear across his knee .

Flames exploded, and a mournful wail resounded through heaven and earth . That terrifying blood-colored spear was actually forcibly broken by Long Chen .

Huo Lieyun suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood . As the spear’s item-spirit was linked to his soul, the spear’s destruction caused a backlash .

Affected by this backlash, the flame net that he had condensed dissipated . Ye Zhiqiu, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er regained their freedom . Ye Zhiqiu’s sword flashed as she prepared an attack .

“Let me do it . ”

Long Chen’s figure flashed, and he appeared in front of Huo Lieyun, raising a hand and launching a slap .
