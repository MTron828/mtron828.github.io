Chapter 3298 Jia Luo

“Brother Jia Luo, you personally came to ask me about such a minor thing? What, is this the will of the Divine Venerate?” asked Enpuda, laughing.

This young man before him was Lord Brahma’s direct disciple, Jia Luo. His fame in the immortal world was not at all inferior to Enpuda’s.

Although he looked young, his reputation preceded him. He had once caused a storm of blood to fall across the immortal world.

Jia Luo shook his head. “Master has been in seclusion all these years. He doesn’t have the time to deal with such matters. I simply feel that the High Firmament Academy is no longer being obedient. It seems that their restraint has reached their limit. They seem to wish to restore their past glory, a comeback on the verge of death. Before going into seclusion, master told me to keep an eye on the High Firmament Academy. I have no choice but to be careful about them.”

Enpuda smiled. “Brother Jia Luo, you really are meticulous. You are the most outstanding of the Divine Venerate’s disciples. Perhaps you will be the one to take up the Divine Venerate’s mantle in the future.”

Enpuda called this man brother. The two of them were clearly quite close.

“Brother, you’re joking. I came to ask you about what you think of the High Firmament Academy’s latest movements. Master told me to ask you for guidance if things are unclear. So I came,” said Jia Luo.

Enpuda’s smile widened. His plump face bounced as he laughed. “The Divine Venerate praises me too much. For you to have received the Divine Venerate’s favor, it’s proof that your aptitude is definitely one in a billion. I only have a few years on you and only a bit more experience, so I wouldn't call it guidance. But the Divine Venerate also told me to keep an eye on the High Firmament Academy in secret. I am aware of all their movements. 

“However, in order to test them, I deliberately accepted a new disciple and put a ring of light around him, just to test the High Firmament Academy’s bottom line. Through Gui Yun, I found that the High Firmament Academy has been pushed to the edge of a cliff and can no longer retreat. That fellow Long Chen seems to be the High Firmament Academy’s pawn. He really is a bit strange. Everyone says that he is an ascender from the lower plane. But I feel like this isn’t too likely. 

“Almost everywhere in the lower plane is under our gaze. Such a figure would definitely be the top heavenly genius of a mortal world, so we can’t possibly not know him. I feel that it’s very likely that Long Chen is a special chess piece that the High Firmament Academy raised in secret. His identity as an ascender is nothing more than a disguise the High Firmament Academy came up with to trick us.”

“But if that really was the case, why wouldn’t they keep him secret until the end? To expose him at such a time isn’t wise,” said Jia Luo.

“Brother, you don’t know just how many secret geniuses the High Firmament Academy has raised. They have always been hiding their power. They tossed out a single Long Chen just to draw out attention, similar to how I raised Gui Yun. I even announced that he was my most cherished disciple just as a foundation for this plot. I suspect that they tossed out Long Chen so that our attention is focused on him while they prepare other moves in secret,” said Enpuda.

“You mean that…”

“It’s only a guess. We’ll need more proof to see if I’m right.”

Just then, a ring on Enpuda’s finger lit up. He smiled. “There’s already news from the Vile Dragon Domain. Take a look!”

Enpuda handed Jia Luo a jade tablet, and Jia Luo scanned it with his divine sense. He was surprised by the contents. “Long Chen really went to the ruins of the seventh branch academy? He even cut off the seed pod of the Devil Eye Water Lily? Is this news confirmed?”

Enpuda confidently said, “It is definitely true. The Bloodkill Hall has a set of eyes there. One of my followers followed him, but it was just to fool others. That person is actually my devoted follower. There’s definitely no doubt. However, it really is surprising that Long Chen could cut off the Devil Eye Water Lily’s seed pod. That is the emperor amongst the devil flowers. When the nine colors of reincarnation are unleashed, any Immortal King would be killed. But Long Chen actually cut off its seed pod. After it lost its seed pod, it didn’t even have a tenth of its original power. It’s not too surprising that Long Chen could escape.”

The follower that Enpuda was talking about was Zhao Qinglong. If Bai Shishi, Jiang Yuhe, and the others were present, they would definitely be shocked. They had all been tricked by Zhao Qinglong. He truly hid himself deeply.

A scene appeared in front of them. That scene was of Long Chen and the others circling a fire. They solemnly ‘offered sacrifice’, with Long Chen murmuring something that none of them could understand.

Afterward, Long Chen and the others set foot on their flying boat. Even after activating the flying boat’s formation, the scene didn’t end. Every single one of their movements was recorded.

“My guess really is right. Amongst all of them, only Long Chen understands his true mission. Even Bai Letian’s grandchildren are unaware,” sneered Enpuda.

“Is he a fool? What kind of altar is this? Does he take us for fools? If he really wanted to fool us, at the very least, he should construct a decent altar and send more forces.” Jia Luo couldn’t hold back his scorn.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

How was this an altar? It was no more than a stove. Using devil beast bones as an offering? Just burning them black and the ceremony was complete? Would they fool a single person with this nonsense?

“What is fake is real, what is real is fake. This little demon is quite crafty. For the High Firmament Academy to send him out and even let him know their true goal, he must not be ordinary,” said Enpuda.

“Then what should we do now?” asked Jia Luo.

“We will continue watching Long Chen. But this isn’t the important part. The important thing is to keep watch over the ruins of the other branch academies. Long Chen cut off the Devil Eye Water Lily’s seed pod. Hence, it is definitely enraged and will demand reinforcements from the Undying World. Once it recovers, it might even directly launch an attack on the High Firmament Academy. It was at great lengths that we buried that ancient devil corpse there to draw the Undying World’s attention. It was just so that they would guard that place for us. We originally needed to pay a bit more attention there, but now there is absolutely no need. The Devil Eye Water Lily will definitely not take this lightly, so this matter won’t end like this. The Vile Dragon Domain is now the least likely area for the High Firmament Academy to reclaim. The price for them to even attempt such a thing is unbearable for them. But there’s no need for you to worry. We already have our eyes where the large ruins are. Not even the slightest breeze escapes us. Furthermore, taking back those ruins is a process that requires a great deal of time. We’ve been setting things up for thousands and thousands of years. Does the High Firmament Academy really think that they can flip the board? Hehe, would we give them that chance?” Enpuda laughed.

“Your plans really are awesome, brother. If that’s the case, then why don’t I go kill Long Chen for you?” A sinister killing intent appeared on Jia Luo’s face. He vaguely felt that Long Chen was very dangerous. He couldn’t be left alive.
