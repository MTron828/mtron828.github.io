Chapter 3887 Unrivaled Sword Cultivator

Yue Zifeng’s arrival instantly revitalized the Dragonblood Legion. He was a peerless sword cultivator. Even Long Chen had personally admitted that in terms of pure attack power, Yue Zifeng was number one in their legion.

At this time, Yue Zifeng’s robes fluttered gently along with his black hair. With a sword in his hand, he was walking gracefully through the air. He appeared the same as back then.

However, his aura had changed. It was sharper and fiercer, no longer reserved, just like an unsheathed sword. Even the ten thousand Daos would be cut apart by his sharpness.

When his sword fell, there were no ripples in the void, no awe-inspiring explosions. It looked just like a simple sword, but it cut apart the laws of the cosmos and shattered the boundaries of spacetime. People's perception itself even seemed to falter, as if heaven and earth had been cut apart, leaving their senses disoriented.

That expert before him cried out in shock. “Sword cultivator!”

Every expert wished to avoid facing sword cultivators the most. They were the most unfathomable existences with unmatched power. As the world’s most illogical existence, their killing power couldn’t be judged by cultivation base and realm.

Furthermore, there were huge differences between sword cultivators. An ordinary sword cultivator might only count as above average amongst others in the same realm. In a clash in the same realm, that sword cultivator would only have a higher chance of victory.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, there were also some absolutely terrifying existences amongst sword cultivators. They were able to disregard cultivation bases, disregard realm differences, and disregard the very boundaries of the Heavenly Daos. They were beyond the suppression of the laws, beyond all limitations.

When that first expert was slain, his very technique was sliced along with him, leaving countless people horrified. Hence, the next target hesitated for but a single moment, pondering whether to block or flee, when Yue Zifeng’s sword mercilessly fell.

That expert took out a giant shield at this critical moment. However, his shield had just appeared when his body trembled uncontrollably. The shield was untouched, but he was already cut in two.

“What?!”

Countless people were shocked now. That person’s shield had clearly appeared in front of him, so why was he killed while the shield was undamaged? Could Sword Qi kill people through shields?

“No, that’s the power to sever the laws of spacetime!”

A frightened cry suddenly rang out. Yue Zifeng had indeed not struck that person through the shield. He had first struck that person, and only then did the latter manage to raise this shield.

In other words, Yue Zifeng’s sword had transcended the limits of spacetime. When they saw Yue Zifeng’s movements, it was already after he moved. His sword was above the laws.

“How can there be such a terrifying sword cultivator?!” People quivered with fear. Even the city lord-level experts were afraid.

For him to have transcended laws meant that by the time they saw him raise his sword, they would already be cut in half.

Yue Zifeng suddenly took a single step, crossing the gap to strike another expert. Even though this expert was already fleeing, when Yue Zifeng’s sword fell, this expert’s body was still cut in two far in the distance.

The trajectory and angle of Yue Zifeng’s attack defied common sense, deviating entirely from his physical position. It was like whenever Yue Zifeng moved his arm, an invisible sword would just fly out and kill his opponent. That strange scene terrified countless people.

Sword cultivators were unreasonable, completely illogical. They could not be judged according to the standards of the cultivation world.

Yue Zifeng unleashed three blows, killing three people who were Double Supreme Divine Venerates. Moreover, they didn’t even have the power to retaliate in front of him. Seeing this scene, the Dragonblood warriors cheered excitedly.

These experts were finally afraid and switched to retreat, fleeing like they were avoiding the plague.

A man with one sword scared off dozens of Double Supreme Divine Venerates. That scene was truly astonishing.

“Use numbers to crush him! Sword cultivators are completely focused on offense! Defense is his fatal weakness, so even an ordinary person’s attack can kill him! Attack!” shouted one of them, directing his army of hundreds of thousands.

Sword cultivators were indeed terrifying. This was known to all. However, their weakness was also not a secret. Everyone knew that sword cultivators could only attack, not defend.

The more terrifying the sword cultivator, the more their focus was on offense. That was what made their attacks like an unblockable heavenly blade.

However, the Heavenly Daos were fair. Such terrifying attack power resulted in a giant hole in their defenses because they sacrificed their defenses for an absolute offense. If they were struck by an attack, they could easily be slain.

Hence, in a chaotic battle, if someone could grasp an opening, they could instantly launch a fatal blow.

“Kill that human brat!”

“All of you, charge! If anyone dares to hold back, I’ll kill you myself!”

“Attack!”

The others also gave frantic orders, sending their disciples charging at the terrifying sword cultivator.

Following that, those experts clenched their teeth and poured toward Yue Zifeng, crashing toward him like the tide.

“Ten Thousand Swords Execute Immortals!”

Yue Zifeng let out a resounding shout. In that instant, he swiftly formed a seal with his left hand, while simultaneously lifting his right hand with the sword raised high. Like a blooming flower, countless sword-images sprang forth, filling the air. After that, millions of sword-images quivered before descending like the rain.

The sword-images instantly enveloped those attackers, tearing through weapons and armor. Nothing could stop them.

After this one attack, countless lifeforms fell from the sky. Their bodies had bloody holes in them that didn’t look too big, but the fires of their souls were extinguished. The moment they were struck, the will of the Sword Dao crushed their souls.

The human wave tactic failed, leaving the Divine Venerates in a state of shock and fury as their people died. This was definitely the most terrifying expert that they had ever seen.

“He can sever the laws of spacetime, and the will of his Sword Dao is invincible. Who can stop him?!” demanded one of them with a mixture of fury and helplessness.

“Unless the merge of your bone and blood is complete, the only way to stop him is using a true Heavenly Dao Crown, which allows you to merge into the Heavenly Daos. Only then can you face the ability to sever the laws of spacetime,” said one of them.

However, they were all Divine Venerates. Although they possessed both Supreme Blood and Supreme Bones, at their realm, fully merging them required an enormous amount of primal chaos qi. Since that was the case, compared to these heavenly geniuses in the Immortal King realm, they had little chance of actually accomplishing it.

“A sword cultivator? I want to see if you really are as amazing as the legends say you are.”

Just then, an arrogant voice rang out.
