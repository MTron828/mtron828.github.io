Chapter 3394 Sacred Pill Hall

Ying Bokong finally admitted defeat, and only then did Long Chen stop. Ying Bokong had been badly beaten. It was unknown just how many times his bones had been broken. Now, his body was completely deformed.

Long Chen didn’t kill him. He only condensed a spiritual seal and placed it on the latter’s head. Ying Bokong’s body then quivered. Just like that, a spiritual mark was placed on his soul.

After that, Ying Bokong returned to human form. His face was black and blue from the beating, and his aura was also in disarray. Long Chen had almost crippled him.

“The spiritual mark I gave you isn’t a slave seal. It will vanish in ten days. During these ten days, you have to listen to my orders. After ten days, you can scram,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Ying Bokong had long since lost his previous arrogance. After being violently beaten, the arrogant flames within him were extinguished.

Originally, he had thought that he would become a slave. But he was stirred when he heard Long Chen say this.

“Really?” asked Ying Bokong, pleasantly surprised.

“Of course. With your talent and power, do you think you’re even qualified to follow Boss Long San?” snorted Long Chen. “If I didn’t have some use for you, I’d have killed you with a slap.”

Ying Bokong went from dispirited to invigorated in an instant. He had just fallen to hell and was dragged back out. He only needed to listen to Long Chen’s orders for ten days? That was the greatest blessing of his life.

“Many thanks, master!”

Ying Bokong’s mood truly changed quickly, and he directly called Long Chen master. It seemed that compared to the human race, the thinking of demonic beasts was far simpler.

“Tell me, what did you come to this place for? What’s going on in the Ancient Orchid Domain’s Auspicious Cloud Prefecture?”

Long Chen had done a soulsearch, but it wasn’t a brute force soulsearch. He only got some fragmentary information.

“Master… we… pfft!” Ying Bokong suddenly coughed up blood. His aura then fell rapidly.

In his excitement at not being forever enslaved, he forgot to suppress his injuries. The beating that Long Chen had given him was quite severe, so his wounds flared.

Seeing this, Long Chen took out a medicinal pill and gave it to him. As the medicinal energy spread throughout Ying Bokong’s body, he seemed to go from almost dead to bursting with life in just a short moment. His wounds mostly recovered, and he was shocked.

“Many thanks, master! This medicinal pill of yours is marvelous. I feel like it’s not at all inferior to the medicinal pills of the Sacred Pill Hall, or perhaps even greater!”

“The Sacred Pill Hall? You speak of one of Lord Brahma’s four halls?” asked Long Chen in surprise.

Lord Brahma had four halls beneath him, the Nine Underworld Hall, the Bloodkill Hall, the Sacred Pill Hall, and the Martial God Hall.

Long Chen had already encountered the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall. But the Sacred Pill Hall and the Martial God Hall didn’t exist in the Heavenly Swell Domain. So, he hadn’t expected to run into them here.

“Yes, the Sacred Pill Hall is the strongest force in the Integral Heaven Star-Field. It possesses absolute authority here. The cultivators of this domain can essentially be split into four tiers. The lowest tier is… the human race. The middle tier is the half-beasts, half-demons. The high tier is the demonic beast race. Above the demonic beast race are the alchemists of the Sacred Pill Hall. Their statuses are such that even my demonic beast race must bow in greeting toward them. I was once badly wounded and spent a great deal of money to buy a healing pill from the Sacred Pill Hall. It was truly effective, comparable to master’s divine pill,” said Ying Bokong.

It had to be known that the Sacred Pill Hall’s medicinal pills were very expensive. To demonic beasts, ordinary medicinal pills were of limited effect. Thus, when they were injured, they would normally rely on themselves to recuperate rather than buy pills.

However, a random pill that Long Chen tossed out almost fully healed Ying Bokong, so he was filled with shock. He began to wonder about Long Chen’s status. He vaguely felt like he had run into a supremely terrifying figure.

The disciples of the Falling Star Gate didn’t know what to do. Their rank nine heavenly genius had actually become someone else’s battle pet. If that spread, how could the Falling Star Gate’s disciples face the world?

However, even Ying Bokong had been beaten into submission, so the rest of them didn’t even have the courage to fight. They only stealthily sent transmissions to Ying Bokong.

Ying Bokong pretended that he couldn’t even hear them. Considering that he now had Long Chen’s spiritual seal on him, these messages were no different than harming him.

“We’re going.”

Long Chen didn’t want to be stared at by these people, so he brought Ying Bokong away. In order to suck up to Long Chen, Ying Bokong directly summoned his true form to fly away with Long Chen on his body.

However, just as he did, he realized that he didn’t have a single feather on his body. It was exceptionally ugly. He hastily put away his true form and silently followed behind Long Chen.

They then found a secluded place where Long Chen asked him about the situation in the Integral Heaven Star-Field. Ying Bokong clearly knew more.

According to his story, the Ancient Orchid Domain was the most prosperous domain in this star-field. As for the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture, it was the core of the star-field.

There were several World Kings standing guard over this place. Actually, the master of his Falling Star Gate was a half-step World King, a terrifying greater demon.

Almost all the powers within the Integral Heaven Star-Field were created by demonic beasts. As for the human race, they were just subordinates.

The Sacred Pill Hall was the highest level ruler of this place. The medicinal pills that they refined were mostly for demonic beasts. Thus, they ruled this star-field of demonic beasts.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, the Sacred Pill Hall also showed great consideration for the human race. They did not permit the demonic beast race to fully suppress the human race. In this domain, the two could coexist peacefully.

That was what resulted in there being particularly many mixed-blood descendants of the beast race and the human race. But the human race here was in the habit of hugging the legs of the powerful demonic beasts because their bloodlines could be directly transmitted to the next generation. At the very least, their physical bodies would be dozens of times stronger than pure human experts.

“The Sacred Pill Hall actually did such a thing?”

Long Chen was surprised, but he then shook his head. One of Lord Brahma’s subordinates definitely wouldn’t do something so good for no benefit. They definitely had some scheme.

The Integral Heaven Star-Field was prospering. It had been in an era of peace for countless years, and no large battles had erupted within. Thus, whether they were humans or demonic beasts, they all viewed this place as a wonderful home. Even if the human race’s position was lower, countless experts of the human race were still willing to cross domains and come here.

The most surprising thing to Long Chen was that this star-field didn’t have the Huayun Trading Company. Such a large place that was flourishing actually didn’t have the Huayun Trading Company in it? That implied quite a few problems. Could it be that the Sacred Pill Hall refused to permit it?

Long Chen suddenly recalled that he had gone to many domains that had the Huayun Trading Company but no Sacred Pill Hall. Could it be that the two could not coexist within the same place?

“That’s right, you’re all at the peak of the Four Peak realm? What is going on?” asked Long Chen. All the experts from the Falling Star Gate were at the same realm. That was very curious.

“We came to participate in the Divine Lord Immortal Realm that opens only once every ten years. We are going to break through to the Divine Lord realm inside of it. Did you not come here for that purpose as well?” asked Ying Bokong in confusion.

“The Divine Lord Immortal Realm? Break through to the Divine Lord realm?”

Long Chen’s heart leaped. Wasn’t that precisely what he needed? Was that a coincidence? Or had Wu Tian intentionally set it up for him? Now, it was interesting.
