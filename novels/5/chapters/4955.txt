CThe source of the low roar was surprisingly close, causing them to jump. According to Fang Liude’s informant, there should be no demonic beasts in the vicinity. Was the information wrong?

“Little Qi, give everyone some aura-concealing talismans. We’ll take a look. Long Chen, don’t be nervous. Just go with Brother Song and Sister Ying.” Fang Liude quickly gave orders, not forgetting to look after Long Chen.

Long Chen almost laughed. What did he have to be nervous about? However, it was rare indeed for people to trust someone so quickly in this kind of world, especially if they hadn’t known each other for long.

These people lived on the bottom rung of society, where life was extremely tough and dangerous. Not only were the real experts squeezing them out of the best places, but they also had to compete with countless peers. In a world of constant danger, kindness was the most worthless thing.

Yet, these people trusted Long Chen quickly and looked after him, showing their kindness. Kind people indeed attracted each other; it was often said that like attracts like.

When everyone received an aura-concealing talisman, Long Chen noticed that the talisman master was actually quite skilled. Although he couldn't compare to Xia Chen, his craftsmanship was impressive. Unfortunately, the paper used for these talismans was rather cheap, and the ink and pen were also of low quality.

The mercenary group placed Long Chen at the center to avoid any mishaps and to prevent him from making any novice mistakes.

They continued onward carefully, passing a barren stone mountain. Using stone-colored camouflage, they snuck their way forward.

When they saw the scene before them, they were overjoyed. A giant sea serpent was coiled there, with an egg bigger than a house by its side.

“Six Horn Sea Serpent!”

Long Chen was surprised to see this immemorial species once more. He had fought against the Six Horn Sea Serpent race in the mortal world. However, as the Martial Heaven Continent was part of a lower plane, its species’ bloodline was not that pure.

On the other hand, this Six Horn Sea Serpent was a purebred. Its horns were dark gold, and its scales were pitch-black with a metallic luster. Each scale bore six dark gold runes.

This was a powerful Heaven Saint sea demon. Each scale could be used as a shield comparable to an Eternal divine weapon, and in fact, those scales were superior to the shields of the two warriors in Long Chen’s group.

If they could skin this Six Horn Sea Serpent, they could create a shockingly powerful set of leather armor.

Its skin and bones could be refined into low-grade Heaven Saint divine weapons. As for its horns, flesh, and innards, they were all priceless treasures. When Fang Liude and the others saw this creature, their eyes turned red. Long Chen could hear their hearts pounding hard in their chests.

“Heavens, if we kill it, we won’t need to do any missions for thirty years,” muttered Yu Ying as she covered her mouth, staring in excitement.

Fang Liude took a deep breath and solemnly said, “Everyone, calm down. This is a Six Horn Sea Serpent, an extremely powerful immemorial species. Although it is weakened after laying an egg, it’s not something we can deal with. We’ll carry out our third plan in a bit.”

“Ah? We’re just stealing its egg?” Yu Ying’s disappointment was echoed by the others.

After all, The Six Horn Sea Serpent was incredibly valuable. While its egg was precious, incubating it would require resources and time they simply didn't have. Raising it was beyond their capabilities.

In comparison to the corpse of the adult Six Horn Sea Serpent, its egg wasn’t as valuable. Thus, they couldn’t help being disappointed. However, as Fang Liude was their leader, they had to listen to him at all times.

Long Chen nodded at Fang Liude’s decision. Long Chen had underestimated Fang Liude before, not expecting him to keep his cool in front of such bait. It was impressive that Fang Liude could calmly weigh the pros and cons.

After all, Long Chen didn’t have such a cool head. Any treasures he saw had to be taken, even if he had to risk his life.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Although everyone was disappointed, they knew that if it were possible to kill the serpent, Fang Liude wouldn’t give up. He was definitely the most reluctant out of all of them. He made this decision because he didn’t want greed to lead to huge casualties.

The leader always bore the greatest responsibility, with the group's safety as their top priority. No matter how strong an individual was, without leadership abilities, the capacity to unite people, and the ability to make calm decisions under pressure, they wouldn’t be qualified to lead.

Furthermore, for a true leader, the death of their members was a personal disgrace. Some leaders would rather die than sacrifice their comrades. It was this point that gave the entire mercenary group more cohesiveness.

Long Chen suddenly thought of the Muxue Mercenary Unit[1] he had encountered all that time ago. The image of a valiant and capable woman emerged in his mind.

However, the Muxue Mercenary Unit had been more of a group of adventurers, exploring and searching for treasures together. Furthermore, they weren’t under as much pressure as Fang Liude and the others.

One was in the immortal world, while the other was in the mortal world. However, the one in the immortal world was living a more wretched life. Long Chen wondered what those people who dreamed of immortality and godhood would think if they knew this.

Watching them spread out and prepare to strike, Long Chen suddenly said, “When the Six Horn Sea Serpent is in drake form, it has a fatal weakness. After laying its egg, it will enter a dizzy state for several breaths. During this time, its Neidan and the energy in its six horns reverse into its body. Its scales will flash seven times, after which it will instantly recover eighty percent of its energy. This flashing period is its weakest moment. Though it’s a short time, if you time it right, you can easily kill it.”

“Really?”

Everyone was surprised to hear that and then looked at Fang Liude. Fang Liude was shocked. He actually knew the first part of what Long Chen said, but it was his first time hearing about the scales flashing seven times.

Since Long Chen was right about the first part, perhaps the rest was also true. Furthermore, Long Chen had no reason to trick them.

“Are you sure?” asked Fang Liude solemnly.

Long Chen nodded. “I’m very sure.”

“Then shall we gamble on it?” Fang Liude looked at everyone.

Everyone clenched their teeth. “Let’s do it!”

“Alright, then prepare for the first plan!”

They instantly scattered, readying themselves. They quickly occupied favorable terrain, a sign that they were well-trained. At this moment, they could no longer look after Long Chen as they were focused on the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent laid three more giant eggs before suddenly quivering. Its aura grew unstable, and its scales flashed.

“Now!” Fang Liude shouted, leading the charge.
