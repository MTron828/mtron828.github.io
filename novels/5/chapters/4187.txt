Chapter 4176 Appraisal

“What is this?! What is Long Chen doing?!”

The Soaring Dragon Company’s experts came running out. On the other hand, the innate Heaven Venerate, whom Long Chen had slapped, was practically hysterical.

“What do you think I’m doing? Your Soaring Dragon Company’s manners are too lacking. Everyone is here for my bronze cauldron, but you’re actually making them wait until the end? How long are you planning on making everyone wait? Who does this? We’re all cultivators, and our time is precious. Furthermore, the Sage King Convention is about to start. Who has the time to watch your rotten auction?”

After saying that, Long Chen turned back to the audience. “Everyone, I, Long Chen, sincerely wish to sell the bronze cauldron in my hands. I have no time to waste. That is why I want to ask everyone’s opinion. I want the first auction item to be the bronze cauldron. Does everyone agree?”

“Agreed!”

The majority of the audience instantly shouted their assent. Just as Long Chen had stated, they had come solely for the Heaven Earth Cauldron, and no one wanted to spend too much time in this venue. However, they were all aware of the unwritten rule: auctions always reserved the most valuable item for the grand finale. This was a rule that they couldn't disregard.

Since that was the case, Long Chen’s proposal was accepted by these people. They wanted to see if this bronze cauldron of his was the real deal or not.

“Bastard, are you trying to con the Soaring Dragon Company?! Do you know how much money you’re making us lose?!” roared an expert of the Soaring Dragon Company.

“What does that have to do with me? It wasn’t as if we had an agreement for my item to be the last one. So I’m going first. Once I’m done, you can keep going,” said Long Chen.

“You…!” That elder almost coughed up blood. Once the bronze cauldron was sold, would anyone bother with the remaining items?

It was as if someone had revealed the answer to a riddle before even posing the question. Who would play such a game?

If it was possible, this elder would kill Long Chen right here and now. The entire situation was already out of their control.

“Hurry up and start! We can skip the tricks!”

“Starting with the cauldron is good! No one is interested in the other trash. Long Chen, you can start!”

“Hurry, our time is very precious! The Soaring Dragon Company is too dirty. Long Chen, take out that Heaven Earth Cauldron.”

Even the experts in the private rooms began to shout their agreement. They were essentially all innate Heaven Venerates, representatives of their own factions. They were not existences that the Soaring Dragon Company could provoke.

Hearing this, the Soaring Dragon Company’s people were paralyzed with fury. But now that everyone in the crowd was agreeing with it, they couldn’t stop it anymore.

They were like ants on a hot plate, trying to think of what to do. However, when divine light appeared on the stage, they knew that they were done for.

“Everyone, please take a look. This is the bronze cauldron that I obtained from the three thousand worlds.”

Long Chen directly took out the cauldron. Yet, to his astonishment, as he withdrew the imitation from the primal chaos space, within his mind-sea, the Earth Cauldron quivered slightly. Following that, the fake cauldron actually began to shine with a mystical divine light.

Long Chen was shocked by this. Up until now, other than using the Earth Cauldron to refine pills, he was unable to use it for anything.

However, this time, it had actually taken the initiative to imbue a trace of its divine radiance into the imitation. Now, this fake cauldron possessed a trace of its divine might, so it was clearly helping Long Chen pull off this scam.

Long Chen was overjoyed by this. With the aid of the true Earth Cauldron, this fake would be even more realistic.

He then tried to communicate with the Earth Cauldron, but it appeared to be ignoring him. It seemed that this item from the primal chaos era was quite lofty.

Primal chaos qi swirled around the bronze cauldron, its runes quivering as if it were a living object.

Within those runes, they could discern soaring birds, roaming beasts, towering mountains, expansive plains, meandering rivers, and the ceaseless movement of the sun, moon, and stars. Through it, people felt as though they could see the world of the primal chaos era. Its majestic aura made them feel miniscule.

“This is…!”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When Guo Ran and Xia Chen saw it, they both jumped in shock. “Did boss take out the real thing by accident?!”

The fake that the two of them had crafted might appear similar on the outside, with even its runes being identical, but what they had created was ultimately a lifeless object. In contrast, this thing was imbued with life.

Countless experts stared at the bronze cauldron, and the experts in the private rooms could not remain seated. They ran as close as they could and used their divine sense to examine this bronze cauldron.

“Hey, hey! No jumping onto the stage! You shameless things, are you trying to steal it?!” Long Chen pointed at the closest Heaven Venerate.

That expert was instinctively drawn to the Heaven Earth Cauldron and only woke up from his stupor with that warning. Long Chen had one hand on the Heaven Earth Cauldron, looking like he would put it away at any moment.

“Sorry, I couldn’t help myself from getting a closer look.” The expert paused and retreated.

“Everyone, just looking at it is meaningless. Such a specialized object requires an appraisal. Didn’t the Soaring Dragon Company say that they had prepared eight grandmaster appraisers? Where are they? Is everyone from the Soaring Dragon Company dead already?” announced Long Chen.

Following that, eight elders walked onto the stage, wearing furious expressions. Their plans for this auction had been thrown into chaos by Long Chen.

However, now that things had reached this point, there was no going back. They could only thicken their faces and take out a number of appraisal tools. After wearing their gloves, they began to inspect the cauldron.

Yet, the eight of them didn’t dare to get too close to it. One reason was because Long Chen had said that no one was allowed to get within thirty meters of the bronze cauldron for fear of them trying to steal it.

The other reason was that while these eight elders were very experienced appraisers, their actual power was only in the Mortal Venerate realm. They couldn’t actually endure its divine might.

The eight elders busily examined it, while countless streams of divine sense swept over the cauldron. Upon sensing the majestic primal chaos qi on it, even their breathings grew haggard.

These experts were all experienced and could tell whether something was a treasure or not with just a glance. These powerful fluctuations and ancient aura could not be faked.

This was very likely the legendary Heaven Earth Cauldron, and as a result, some individuals were already starting to get some dangerous ideas. The entire auction hall was practically boiling with various emotions before slowly descending into a stifling, deathly silence. The tension in the air was unbearable.

The eight appraisers spent almost an hour examining the cauldron. In the end, they exchanged a look and nodded before turning to an elder in the distance.

Long Chen saw it all and coldly said, “What's this? Do you need to consult with your master after the appraisal? Is the authenticity of this thing up to your master instead of you eight?”

“What is the Soaring Dragon Company planning?! If the appraisal is complete, announce the results! What’s with the delay? Do you have to discuss it amongst yourselves first?!”

Furious roars directly burst out of the crowd. Everyone’s gaze locked onto the Soaring Dragon Company’s people.

“Speak. Is it real or fake?” demanded Long Chen coldly. Everyone turned silent again.
