Chapter 3932 Marriage Proposal, Betrothal Gift

Long Chen had long since found Eunuch Wei displeasing, but he had held himself back to give face to Yu Qingxuan.

Yet, this damn eunuch just had to appear in front of him this way, pushing Long Chen’s tolerance to its limit. As a result, Long Chen directly slapped him, crushing half of his face. Like a beaten persimmon, Eunuch Wei flipped through the air and collapsed on the ground like a dead toad. His body just lay there twitching as he was no longer conscious.

The current Long Chen had absorbed ancestral dragon essence blood, so his physical body had reached a level that even he himself couldn’t imagine. If he didn’t have mercy, then even if Eunuch Wei specialized in a special soft and defensive cultivation technique, this slap would still have blown him to pieces.

The people who had come with Eunuch Wei cried out in shock and hastily checked his wounds. With their help, Eunuch Wei slowly regained consciousness.

“Old fogey, if you dare to blindly shout in front of me again, I’ll make sure you don’t see tomorrow’s sun,” said Long Chen coldly, pointing at Eunuch Wei.

This person truly drew his ire. If it weren’t for Yu Qingxuan, Long Chen would definitely teach him how to behave.

“Long Chen…” Seeing Long Chen’s dark expression, Yu Qingxuan was afraid that he really might kill Eunuch Wei. Although she also disliked this servant, in the end, Eunuch Wei still belonged to the Vermilion Bird Empire’s imperial household. It would not be good for Long Chen to kill him.

Yu Qingxuan then pulled Long Chen back, having him calm himself down. Long Chen often had a smiling, practically rascal-like expression, but once he was enraged, he was capable of doing unspeakable things.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This time, in the three thousand worlds, Long Chen had slain more lifeforms than Yu Qingxuan had ever seen in her lifetime. Hence, she really was worried about Long Chen’s anger.

“Fine! Just you wait!” Eunuch Wei held his face, his eyes full of rancor. But he knew that if he were to fight Long Chen now, he would definitely die.

Actually, Eunuch Wei could also be considered a peak expert. His soft and flexible energy was incredibly powerful, and he also possessed sharp senses. For his cultivation, he had even severed his life rod.

Due to this confidence in himself, before the three thousand worlds’ opening, although he had felt Long Chen to be strong, he hadn’t been afraid of him.

However, just now, Long Chen’s slap had directly knocked him unconscious, making him realize that the current Long Chen was on an entirely different level. His senses had actually failed to realize it beforehand. Although he couldn’t be considered a wise man, he knew better than to fight when the odds were against him, so he naturally didn’t dare to mess around again.

“Go ahead and wait. Once I finish up my matters, I will go to the Vermilion Bird Empire and propose to your imperial princess. If you have guts, just try and stop me. Then you can see whether or not I can kill you,” said Long Chen coldly.

“Long Chen…!”

Long Chen actually said such a thing in front of everyone, making Yu Qingxuan instantly blush at how direct he was.

“Give me some time to prepare a betrothal gift. Since Meng Qi has told me to marry you openly and grandly, no one in this world can stop me from marrying you,” said Long Chen heroically.

“Who is Meng Qi?! Bird words!” snorted Eunuch Wei.

In an instant, his vision darkened as Long Chen slapped the other side of his face, sending him flying again. After coughing up blood, he fainted.

“Brazen scum! You dare to blaspheme a fairy? Is the name Meng Qi something that you can say?” sneered Long Chen disdainfully.

His tone was perfectly identical to Eunuch Wei’s just now, causing Yu Qingxuan to bitterly hold back her laughter. She then rebuked him, “Stop messing around. My Vermilion Bird Empire cannot possibly accept you if you have such a temper. My imperial father isn’t someone easy to talk to either.”

“That’s no problem. He’s still my father-in-law. As fellow men, I’m sure we’ll communicate easier. And what about my mother-in-law? Are there any taboos I should be aware of?” Long Chen smiled at Yu Qingxuan.

Hearing this question, Yu Qingxuan blushed all the way to her ears. How was she supposed to respond to such a thing in front of so many people? With a somewhat pissed expression, she said, “Since you’re so confident in your abilities, you can just come directly. What’s the point of preparing beforehand? I’m sure a peerless hero like you, someone who annihilated millions and millions of experts in the three thousand worlds with a single roar, is capable of anything.”

After saying that, she turned to leave, but Long Chen directly grabbed her hand. Just before, he had a completely fearless, unrestrained appearance. But all of a sudden, he was showing a pitiful appearance, holding Yu Qingxuan’s sleeve with both hands like a rogue who had turned over a new leaf. “Fairy, I was wrong. I was just bragging just now, please don’t take it to heart. I was only bragging to give myself the courage to do so. You also know just how small my guts are. If I don’t do this, how will I propose to the great princess of the Vermilion Bird Empire? A noble woman like you is naturally noble and mature. Don’t lower yourself to the level of a little child who lost their way in this world like me. Please, give me your guidance so I can walk a bright path, and illuminate the lantern that guides my way. From now on, I renounce my old self. I will no longer be a lost sheep…”

Despite knowing that Long Chen was just teasing her, that pitiful appearance and sincere words still made Yu Qingxuan laugh.

In truth, she was not angry. She was just worried that if Long Chen came to the Vermilion Bird Empire like this, he would suffer quite a bit.

Looking at Long Chen’s still pious begging appearance, Yu Qingxuan didn’t know what to say to him. He was like a child who realized that he had done something wrong and was sincerely apologizing.

“That’s enough. Don’t mess around like before, or you’ll sound boastful. I have to return to the Vermilion Bird Empire so that my imperial father and mother don’t worry.” After saying that, she blushed even more. In a voice that only the two of them could hear, she said, “You… come soon.”

After saying that, Yu Qingxuan didn’t even dare to look at Long Chen again and directly left with the disciples of the Vermilion Bird Empire.

The Vermilion Bird Empire’s disciples had long since been told by Yu Qingxuan not to participate in any large battles. In the three thousand worlds, they were within a treasure land that Yu Qingxuan had sealed for them. Thus, all the Vermilion Bird Empire’s disciples returned alive.

Quite a few of them stealthily waved goodbye to Long Chen, hoping for him to come. Some pretty female disciples even winked at him as if warning him that marrying their princess was not so easy, and that he should be mentally prepared.

When Yu Qingxuan left, Long Chen felt like his soul had departed with her. After that, the Butterfly Spirit race, the Stone Spirit race, and some other races that had friendly relationships with the human race bade him farewell as well. Long Chen seemed to greet them warmly, but in truth, he wasn’t even aware of what he was saying. He had just reunited with everyone when they suddenly had to part again. As a result, he was feeling a great sense of loss.

“Alright, let’s return to the Wine God Palace.”

Once everyone said their farewells, Xia Guhong brought Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran away as well.
