Chapter 4418 Long Clan Submits

Long Chen’s shout reverberated like rolling thunder, echoing throughout heaven and earth. Countless newly constructed buildings crumbled directly under the pressure of this sound wave.

Long Chen hadn’t expected Ye Xue to be trapped in the territory of the Heavenly Divinity race, the Eternal Long clan. Thoughts of the Long clan stirred memories of the trials his father had faced, and Long Chen's fury erupted instantly.

The Long clan had just completed the repair of buildings that had been destroyed last time, so everything was brand new.

Whether it was due to their recent construction or a lack of time to set up formations, Long Chen’s kick toward the gate didn’t activate the grand formation, and his roar directly crushed countless buildings.

Long Chen’s fury intensified. If his father hadn’t intervened last time, he would have destroyed the Long clan.

“Courting death!”

Countless powerful auras erupted. Astonishingly, hundreds of Eternal experts suddenly emerged from beneath the ground, their killing intent erupting.

Witnessing their sudden appearance, Long Chen jumped in fright. At the same time, Ye Ling sensed an unusual power beneath the surface of the earth, and it sent shivers down her spine.

“Long Chen, I can no longer sense Ye Xue’s aura. I’m only sure that she’s within this region, but not where exactly,” Ye Ling conveyed as she saw the Long clan’s terrifying foundation.

Concerned that her perceptions might be mistaken, Ye Ling hesitated. She was aware that wrongly accusing such a powerful entity would lead to dire consequences.

“As long as she vanishes within this region, I’ll kill them if they don’t hand her over,” declared Long Chen, his teeth gnashing in determination.

Long Chen hated the Long clan to the bone. Only due to his father's intervention had he refrained from seeking revenge on them. Yet, if Ye Xue's aura vanished in this area, it had to be connected to the Long clan. Even if the Long clan didn’t personally do it, this entire prefecture was under their command, so they definitely knew who did it. Long Chen was confident that his judgment was right.

“Long Chen! You goddamn bastard, how dare you come back here?!” A furious roar resounded, and the patriarch of the Long clan appeared, his anger evident.

Right now, the patriarch was already an Eternal expert with an extremely condensed aura. It appeared that Long Chen had underestimated the foundation of the Heavenly Divinity race.

It seemed that the Heavenly Divinity race had been in a hibernating state all this time, waiting for a chance to suddenly soar. All of a sudden, hundreds of their Eternal experts appeared, showcasing their shocking power.

As these old enemies met once more, both Long Chen and the patriarch’s gazes were full of surging killing intent, looking like they wanted to tear each other apart.

“Hand over the Earth Spirit race’s Ye Xue. Otherwise, the Long clan will disappear from the nine heavens and ten lands,” shouted Long Chen.

The Long clan’s experts were enraged, especially their Eternal experts. While some of them hadn’t seen Long Chen personally before, his reputation as a mortal enemy of the Long clan was well-known among them.

“There was a path to the heavens, but you dove into hell instead! Don’t even think about leaving now that you’ve come here!” declared one of the Eternal experts before launching a direct attack.

“No!”

The patriarch tried to prevent him, but it was too late.

With a single explosive sound, Long Chen unleashed a fist covered in astral light, blasting apart that Eternal expert through space. He didn’t give the other side any chance to use his Eternal energy.

Long Chen couldn’t be compared to his old self. Now, his astral energy flowed naturally with a single thought. Even without the support of his manifestation, a single fist from him could instantly unleash the equivalent of seventy percent of his peak power.

This seventy percent wasn’t something an ordinary Eternal expert could possibly withstand, especially for one launching a sudden attack without the opportunity to mobilize his full defensive power. Long Chen effortlessly killed him without even having to touch him.

This attack stunned the Eternal experts of the Long clan, including the patriarch. Despite knowing that Long Chen was a terrifying existence, the patriarch hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so terrifying that he could kill this Eternal expert with a wave of his hand.

“I’ll say it again. Hand over the Earth Spirit race’s Ye Xue. Otherwise, the Long clan will disappear today!” proclaimed Long Chen.

“Bastard, our Long clan has no enmity with the Earth Spirit race! We don’t know anyone called Ye Xue! You’re simply slandering people, or are you trying to make an excuse to attack us?!” raged the patriarch.

“Long Chen, give me a bit of time. I’ll try to sense her again…” said Ye Ling anxiously.

“I can’t be bothered to waste words with you. Fine, I want to destroy the Long clan anyway. Last time, I let you off because of my father, but that doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten our grudges. Now that you’ve given me a reason, I wouldn’t be called Long Chen if I didn’t grasp it. I’ll count to three, and if you don’t bring Ye Xue out, I promise that no one from the Long clan will leave here alive!”

“One!”

“You’re doing this on purpose!” shouted the patriarch.

“Two!” Long Chen counted without hesitation. He couldn't care less about their excuses.

At this moment, his divine ring manifested, accompanied by his starry sea. As his seven stars pulsed, a pillar of light surged forth, making the stars in the sky tremble.

A boundless killing intent then enshrouded the Long clan, causing the soul of every individual within it to quiver. Long Chen's killing intent instantly locked onto each person in the Long clan.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

They were horrified to realize that Long Chen wasn’t joking; he really did want to kill every single one of them as vengeance for his father.

These Eternal experts were shocked to find that the power they had been so proud of was incredibly minuscule in front of Long Chen. If Long Chen chose to attack, not one of them would survive.

Long Chen snorted and was about to speak again when the patriarch shouted, “Fine, you win! Call over junior sister Ye Xue.”

Hearing this, Ye Ling was both shocked and delighted. Unexpectedly, Ye Xue really was in the Long clan, and they had arrived in time.

On the other hand, Long Chen felt disappointed. The pain and suffering his father had gone through were etched deeply in his mind, and Long Chen wasn’t such a magnanimous person to wave off grievances.

However, Long Zhantian had ordered him not to take action back then, so he could only endure it. Ever since then, Long Chen had been waiting for his chance. Now that chance had come, the other side was capitulating, leaving him unable to strike. After all, if Long Chen were to attack the Long clan without a reason, he would be disobeying his father’s orders.

“If junior sister Ye Xue is missing a single strand of hair, I will kill an Eternal expert for each hair. If she is injured, I will kill all of them,” declared Long Chen.

The patriarch's expression changed, and he roared, “We only coincidentally ran into her! She was already injured before we met her, and we saved her! How can you repay kindness with enmity?!”

“Shut up! I don’t believe a single word you say! If she really was injured before encountering you…” Long Chen suddenly smiled, but that smile was rather frightening.

“Then what?” asked the patriarch.

“Then you can only blame yourselves for being unlucky. Even the heavens are giving me an excuse to kill you,” said Long Chen with a wide smile.

“You… you’re completely unreasonable!” shouted the patriarch.

“Why be reasonable with unreasonable people? I’ve said what I have to say. The Long clan’s survival depends on your display,” said Long Chen coldly.

Seeing Long Chen push the Long clan to this extent, Ye Ling was worried. She was afraid that the Long clan would go for broke and just harm Ye Xue.

However, it wasn’t long before the Long clan’s experts walked out with a beautiful young maiden.

“Ye Xue!” Ye Ling cried out in delight and rushed over.
