Chapter 3092 Bloodkill Expert

Long Chen entered the martial stage. But this time, he didn’t directly attack. That was because there was a barrier splitting the stage in two to prevent people from doing a preemptive attack.

He was facing a black-robed man. The latter’s clothes were skin tight, and his cloak covered his face, leaving only his eyes uncovered.

When they saw his opponent, Luo Bing and the others cried out in shock.

“An expert from the Bloodkill Hall!”

They knew that they might encounter the Bloodkill Hall’s experts here. After all, the Bloodkill Hall participated in every Martial Dao convention. They had branches here and would always obtain some rewards.

Based on everyone’s guess, the Bloodkill Hall was also one of the ones profiting from the Nine Prefecture Convention. Hence, they definitely hated Long Chen, but he didn’t expect to encounter them so early.

“In a one-against-one, Long Chen might be at a disadvantage,” said Luo Xue a bit worriedly.

This martial stage had a formation that contained every essence of heaven and earth so that everyone could unleash their full capabilities. But an assassin was most skilled at hiding and hunting prey. As soon as he hid himself, he could appear anywhere on the stage.

“Don’t worry, a clown from the Bloodkill Hall won’t trouble boss,” said Qin Feng. He had absolute confidence in Long Chen, and he was full of expectations.

“It’s too bad that the opponent is too weak.” Qin Feng even sighed, as he had been hoping to see his boss fighting all out for the first time after ascending to the immortal world.

Unfortunately, Long Chen’s opponent was just someone from the Bloodkill Hall. Qin Feng was a bit disappointed.

That expression of his left the others speechless. This fellow was a bit too arrogant, but he was truly qualified to be arrogant.

“Long Chen, if you have any final words, you should say them now. Your Martial Dao convention ends here along with your life,” said his enemy. Even though his mouth was covered, his voice still came through very clearly.

Long Chen looked at him and shook his head in disgust. “Someone wearing a diaper on their head shouldn’t talk. I’m afraid that crap will come out.”

“You…”

That person was enraged. The Bloodkill Hall’s experts rarely revealed their faces to others. They were almost always masked.

They were the reaper of the night. After being masked for so long, revealing their true face would make them feel uneasy, so they always preferred to cover up.

After a long time of this convention, they started to view this as an extremely holy conduct. But Long Chen was actually provoking him with their holy custom, enraging him.

“Ignorant trash, you dare to blaspheme the Killing God. The Killing God will punish you. Even in death, your soul will be tossed into a bottomless hell for eternity!”

Bai Shishi and the others were startled. They glanced at each other questioningly.

“Is he really one of those terrifying assassins of the Bloodkill Hall?” wondered Luo Ning.

Assassins all had to be cool and collected, viewing life as nothing more than stalks of grass. They held no regard for other people’s lives but also no regard for their own life. Other than killing, there was nothing worth their pursuit.

Thus, assassins were cold and numb butchers. Someone was actually able to make one of these assassins so enraged? This was unbelievable.

“The Bloodkill Hall’s assassins all have utmost faith in their Killing God. Only the most loyal assassins get better training. Thus, the stronger they are, the more devout they are to the Killing God. By mocking his adornment, boss is looking down on the Killing God, resulting in his anger. With his heart in chaos, let alone boss, even I could easily crush him. But I don’t have boss’s ability to enrage someone by stabbing them right in their weak point,” said Qin Feng.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, they had encountered the Bloodkill Hall quite a bit. Even their divine daughter became one of Long Chen’s women, so the Bloodkill Hall’s inside information was already revealed to them.

Suddenly, Bai Shishi sensed something behind her. She turned back. In the outer ring, she saw a small group of people waving and shouting.

Due to the distance, she couldn’t hear these people. But Bai Shishi saw some familiar faces.

“Our cheering squad has arrived.” Bai Shishi smiled. Luo Bing and the others also turned back. As expected, by straining their eyes, they were barely able to tell that it was Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the others.

This small cheering squad actually numbered in the tens of thousands. The High Firmament Academy had bought a ticket for everyone who met the conditions.

This particular convention had experts like Bai Shishi, Long Chen, and young master Changchuan. Hence, they were all full of anticipation. Even if it cost a fortune, they had to come watch so they could personally witness Long Chen and the others’ accomplishments.

Standing on the stage, Long Chen also sensed it. Seeing Luo Bing waving to him, he looked to where they were pointing and also saw Zhong Ling and the others. He then saw the tens of thousands of disciples wearing the robes of the High Firmament Academy.

He waved toward them. “You will personally witness as I take the champion throne.”

Those disciples’ cheering instantly grew to a new level. Long Chen could barely see them, but they were able to see Long Chen clearly. His voice was also very clear. It felt like all their cheering was worth it.

Even as he waved, he didn’t seem to pay attention to his stage. At this moment, the barrier vanished.

Just as it vanished, his opponent also followed.

“Long Chen, watch out!” Luo Bing couldn’t help crying out in shock. But only then did she recall that her voice couldn’t reach the stage.

Long Chen suddenly twisted his head. Just at that moment, a dagger appeared in the air and stabbed through the spot where his head had been. If he had dodged any later, his head would have been pierced.

Without looking back, Long Chen casually swung his hand behind him. As a result, the Bloodkill Hall’s assassin appeared and Long Chen’s palm struck him in the face.

He then smashed into the barrier, and the clothing covering his face exploded, revealing a completely ordinary face covered in shock.

“Damn, don’t you think this is too casual? Don’t you have other diapers? Hurry up and change yourself! If you don’t, I have my own underpants you can borrow. No, I think I’ll just give them to you,” said Long Chen kindly.

“Blasphemers of the Killing God must die!”

The assassin was incensed and formed one-handed seals. As a result, their block suddenly turned dark, and the entire scenery changed. Long Chen found himself in a gloomy jungle.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
