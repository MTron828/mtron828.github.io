Chapter 2072 Even More Domineering

Huang Feiyan’s words sounded like a threat, but they were clearly a show of force. Long Chen’s fury immediately soared.

What heavenly geniuses from the ancient era? What unrivaled heroes? That was pure nonsense. This so-called hero tried to force him to sell his treasure and then threatened him.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen suddenly laughed, his voice full of disdain. He icily told Huang Feiyan, “I’ve never accepted any threats in my life. I’ll welcome any challenge, even if you want to fight right now. Listen well. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is my ally, and if anyone touches a single one of their feathers, I will annihilate their whole race. You can treat my words as just bragging, but when my blade falls on you, don’t blame me for not warning you.”

Long Chen was truly enraged. She was actually treating him like some pushover with her naked threats. Did she want to play such a game with him?

Long Chen’s words had no pretense to them, so there was no need for Huang Feiyan to give him any face either. She laughed, “Hahaha, good, you really are arrogant. Since ancient times, no one has had the guts to say that they would exterminate the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race. Long Chen, you’re just a brat from a declined era. Do you think you can compare to us, the heavenly geniuses of the ancient era? Here, I will give Dongfang Yuyang face and not kill you. Hopefully, you can escape from Zhao Wuji because I want to personally cut off your head and then see if you can still talk so big.”

Huang Feiyan was also enraged. This was her first time having one of her requests denied, so her mood was bad.

There was also a deep enmity between the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race and the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race. For her to give a warning was already not bad. But her tone had been overbearing, and Long Chen never accepted threats.

Seeing sparks flying between Long Chen and Huang Feiyun, Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang were startled. Long Chen really was fiery enough. His temper came just like that without any warning.

The two of them didn’t know how to advise him about this. This enmity stemmed from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows, and since Long Chen was so protective of them, there was no way to resolve this. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, then I’ll await you. Remember, when you attack me, I’ll consider you my enemy, and I’m never soft hearted toward my enemies. That’s all I have to say,” said Long Chen. He took a deep breath, suppressing his anger. He had an urge to attack this woman right now.

“Hmph, do your best to enjoy your final moments in this world,” snorted Huang Feiyan before leaving.

“Long Chen, why bother? I already warned you that this girl is very prideful. Her temper also isn’t good because she’s from the Xuan Beasts. No one wants to provoke her, but you just had to.” Beitang Rushuang shook her head. If Long Chen had just been a bit more tactful, perhaps this matter could have passed without any threats.

Long Chen shook his head. “Miss Beitang, you grew up in a powerful family and have a powerful backer. If you endure it, the storm will pass. If you take half a step back, the sea and sky will open for you. Such a thing can only occur thanks to your background. If you take a step back, others will also take a step back. But if I take a step back, they’ll take three steps forward, forcing me to my death. If I sold her this pill, do you think she would let off the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race? No. So why should I sell it to her? Not selling it to her makes her immediately turn to hostile threats? Is that the style of a so-called unrivaled heavenly genius? I really look down on such people. This gathering of past and present heroes is garbage. Fortunately, I met the two of you, or this gathering would have lost all its luster for me.”

Long Chen sighed. In the end, it was Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue that had made the best impression on him of this entire gathering.

“Don’t think that praising me has any use. The Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva that I lent you won’t be paid off with just a few words,” warned Beitang Rushuang.

Through their observations, they had come to the conclusion that Long Chen was actually a very simple person. He said whatever he thought about without hiding anything. He was direct and coarse, but easy to get to know.

“Do you think that I’m a person who reneges on debts? However, I’ve heard that once a person dies, their debt vanishes. In other words, if I die, that Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva you lent me will be gone. So perhaps the two of you should consider... giving me some protection. Otherwise, you’ll suffer a loss,” Long Chen laughed.

“The fifty drops of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva might be precious, but it’s not precious enough for us to have to act that way. To tell the truth, if it was really so precious, I wouldn’t have lent it to you,” said Nangong Zuiyue with a smile, making Long Chen give up on that thought. The loss of what they had lent him wasn’t so grave.

“Hear that? The Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva might be huge to you, but it’s nothing to us. At the very least, it’s not worth me personally being a bodyguard for you,” snorted Beitang Rushuang.

“Alright, I won’t joke around anymore. Thank you for your help. I’ll definitely repay this favor,” said Long Chen, cupping his fists.

“Hmph, now you’re acting more like a normal person. You’ve obtained a great furnace and pill. It looked like Zhao Wuji was about to die from rage.” Beitang Rushuang laughed.

When she smiled, huge waves appeared on her chest, causing Long Chen’s throat to become dry. Her body was truly fiery, especially in that skintight black leather. Right now, he was close enough to touch those waves.

“What are you looking at?!” Beitang Rushuang’s laughter suddenly vanished.

“Cough, Beitang Rushuang’s heart is just so ‘generous’. You’re a perfect model for me,” said Long Chen, hastily retracting his gaze.

Hearing the double meaning behind his words, Beitang Rushuang blushed slightly. Long Chen was the first person who dared to tease her like this without being cut down by her.

Although he was teasing her and had a slippery tongue, she didn’t see any malice in his eyes. He couldn’t be lumped together with those perverts.

“Long Chen, can you show me that pill? To tell you the truth, this is my first time seeing a pill undergo tribulation. I’m very curious about it,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“Here.”

Long Chen handed over the pill. He pulled his hand back before touching her hand. Beitang Rushuang didn’t notice, but Nangong Zuiyue did. She smiled slightly. Long Chen acted like a scoundrel but was a gentleman inside, while the majority of people were the opposite.

“So beautiful!” praised Beitang Rushuang. The pill was still shining brightly, and there were lotus flower images that appeared and faded. Occasionally, rainbow light would begin to shine from it and then fade.

It was like the workings of heaven and earth were contained within it. It was also like the cycle of the sun, moon, and stars.

“If you agree to fight me, I’ll let you have a look too. How’s that?” Beitang Rushuang suddenly covered the pill with her hand and placed it behind her back, not letting Nangong Zuiyue get a good look.

Long Chen was speechless. How was it that Beitang Rushuang had such a mature body, but her head hadn’t matured with it?

Nangong Zuiyue brushed it off with a smile. “I’m not a match for you. Fighting with you would just be inviting humiliation to myself, so I won’t agree.”

Beitang Rushuang sighed and handed the pill to Nangong Zuiyue, as if she had just been playing around.

Nangong Zuiyue said a word of thanks as she received it. Looking closely at the pill, she murmured, “There are fluctuations of the Soul Drawing Lotus. That’s an ancient plant, one that soul cultivators would dream of possessing. After being nourished for countless years, this pill has even awakened its spirituality through pill lightning. Its value is inestimable.”

“Miss Nangong’s knowledge is amazing. This pill is called the Nine Lotus Soul Condensing Pill, with the Soul Drawing Lotus being one of its main ingredients. It is refined with nine lotuses as the core ingredients, with seventy-two secondary ingredients. The Soul Drawing Lotus is the most important of the nine lotuses and takes the main position. That’s why it has such a strong effect on the soul. This pill is not to be eaten, but to be kept beside you as you cultivate. It will purify and strengthen your Spiritual Strength. Eating it would be like killing the chicken to get the eggs. As for that woman from the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race, her soul is much weaker than her body. She is probably unable to lock down opponents on the same level with her divine abilities due to that spiritual weakness. That’s why she wants this pill, to make up for this weakness of the Xuan Beasts. How laughable, does she think that my treasures are to be used to strengthen my enemies?”

Long Chen sneered upon thinking of Huang Feiyan. The Xuan Beasts really didn’t have any brains. Just why would he sell it to her?

Nangong Zuiyue handed the Nine Lotus Soul Condensing Pill back after appreciating it. With no one else around, Beitang Rushuang took a deep breath.

“Long Chen, there’s something I want to ask you. I hope you can give me a serious response.”
