Chapter 4612 Seventh Volume of the Nirvana Scripture

The resonant chanting permeated the air, carrying a blend of gentleness, solemnity, and warmth from the woman’s voice, yet beneath it lay an undercurrent of power, pride, and unwavering determination.

“This is the first volume of the Nirvana Scripture. But why is it different from the one we learned?” wondered Yu Qingxuan.

Just like Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan had also learned the Nirvana Scripture. Despite their different paths in obtaining it, they had found their scriptures to be identical.

However, as they stood in the presence of the scripture before them, they were astounded to discover that it bore stark differences from what they had previously learned. The familiar verses had undergone countless changes and transformations, transcending mere solemnity and holiness. The scripture now exhibited a myriad of tones—sometimes resonant and powerful, at other times deep and weighty, occasionally majestic and imbued with strength, and yet other times gentle and warm. 

A single line of the scripture could go through a hundred changes, and sometimes, a single word would have unfathomable transformations.

Long Chen was puzzled at first, but he and Yu Qingxuan quickly focused on fully memorizing what they were hearing.

Suddenly, amidst the ethereal chanting and the transformative presence of the scripture, another figure appeared in the hall. It was Huo Linger.

Hearing the chanting, she flew out of the primal chaos space to join Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan.

“Huo Linger, as a flame spirit, the literal scripture may not be necessary for you. Instead, focus on discerning the changes in tone and the fluctuations in its flame energy. We can compare each other’s understanding later,” Long Chen transmitted to her, recognizing her unique affinity with fire.

Hearing the resounding verses of the scripture, Long Chen suddenly had a profound realization: what they had learned so far was merely an introduction to the Nirvana Scripture. It had been a monotonous rendition, unchanging from start to finish.

Now, Long Chen knew that every syllable of the Nirvana Scripture had countless transformations. The slightest change in tone and inflection could bring forth a different effect.

Though he couldn’t fully comprehend the profound principles behind these changes, he had to do his best to memorize them. He could just study them later when he had time.

Yu Qingxuan was thinking the same thing. The two of them were memorizing as much as they could, and they would verify their versions afterward.

With Huo Linger by their side, Long Chen’s confidence soared. While Huo Linger might not be able to comprehend the scripture itself, being a flame spirit endowed her with unparalleled sensitivity to the fluctuations of the flame energy of the world. Thanks to that, she could detect the fluctuations accompanying the shifts in the chanting tone. This was definitely an area Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan couldn’t match her in.

As the chanting resonated through the hall, it went through the first volume, second volume, third volume… Long Chen was like a parched land soaking in fresh rainwater, doing his best to absorb as much as he could.

Every syllable struck his mind like lightning, imprinting one mysterious rune after another. Following that, he saw an unprecedented world before him.

He had been a frog at the bottom of a well before, but when he heard this chanting, he saw a vast sky.

Every word and syllable seemed to embody the essence of the world’s flame element. At this moment, Long Chen fully understood how the white-robed man had delivered such a devastating blow with a mere projection clone.

Just as the Earth Cauldron said, the Nirvana Scripture Long Chen understood so far was only the tip of the iceberg. Long Chen was finally seeing it in its entirety.

When the fifth volume unfolded, Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan, and Huo Linger started to form hand seals in unison, spurred by the sound of the chanting.

Remarkably, their hand seals were completely different. Yu Qingxuan’s motions were extremely graceful and beautiful, resembling a blooming lotus. Flame runes danced elegantly in her palm, casting a radiant glow on her face. Her aura bore a resemblance to that of the divine statue.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huo Linger, on the other hand, executed her seals with deliberate slowness, as if she was clumsy and being careful. However, every time she completed a seal, a strange rune would appear in her palm, imbued with the essence of flowing lava. Each of these runes emanated a profound, majestic power capable of unleashing destruction upon the world.

Yu Qingxuan effortlessly completed seven or eight runes within a single breath, her movements fluid and precise. In contrast, Huo Linger crafted only one rune during the same interval. However, Long Chen’s hands moved with unparalleled speed, akin to lightning. His wrists contorted, fingers flickering like bolts of electricity as he formed over a thousand seals within the span of a breath.

He relinquished control over his own fingers as they danced. Countless runes quivered between his hands, forming a twisting space.

Within this vortex, flame runes arranged themselves into orderly chains of different colors, and each chain represented a different kind of flame.

As Long Chen’s hands continued their dance, these chains shattered and fused in a perpetual cycle of creation and dissolution.

Long Chen seemed to have entered an enlightened state, forgetting himself and the rest of the world. He couldn’t even focus on memorizing the scripture anymore.

As the scripture continued, Long Chen’s hand seals accelerated, the gap between his hands widening. Within this expanding space, an endless array of chains formed and shattered in an unceasing rhythm.

“Annihilation. Rebirth. Annihilation, rebirth. Order is made to be broken. From its shattered remnants, order is reconstructed. Thus, the cycle begins anew. Can the course of this cycle really be changed by a single person?”

The Earth Cauldron observed silently, emitting a sigh that resonated with a sense of helplessness yet tinged with a hint of anticipation.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the twisted gap between Long Chen’s hands exploded, and the sacred chanting resounding in the hall came to a stop.

“Long Chen, what happened?!”

Yu Qingxuan suddenly cried out and grabbed Long Chen, whose hands were a bloody pulp now. His eyes brimmed with chilling, primal killing intent, as if a fiend from the depths of hell had awoken within him. His violent will to destroy everything filled Yu Qingxuan with terror.

After Yu Qingxuan cried out, the violent will faded. Long Chen, in disbelief, gazed at his hands, only to realize that he could no longer recall what had just happened.

“What volume of the Nirvana Scripture did we get to?” asked Long Chen.

“The seventh,” answered Yu Qingxuan.

“Damn. I can’t remember anything after the fifth volume. Teach me later.” Long Chen smiled bitterly. He couldn’t understand how he had lost focus just now, his head blank.

Crack!

Startled, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan jerked their heads toward the statue, only to find cracks across its surface. The next moment, the entire hall shook ominously.

“This place is going to collapse!” exclaimed Yu Qingxuan.

Suddenly, a thunderous roar reverberated above the collapsing hall.

“You damn bastards! How dare you destroy the temple!? Get out here and face your death!”
