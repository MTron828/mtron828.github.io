Chapter 4779 Fighting an Earth Saint

Blood mist exploded through the air, representing the death of a peak heavenly genius and a waste of countless resources and efforts of a faction.

After all, no matter how great the genius was, without a large supply of resources, they would slowly become mediocre. Some factions might give birth to a supreme genius, but due to their lack of power, they couldn’t fully satisfy all the needs of this genius, even after bankrupting themselves.

Thus, Yue Wuxu’s death meant that all the resources that had gone into raising him had been wasted.

Based on the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s unspoken customs, even if there was an immense enmity between two sides, unless it had reached the point of no stopping until death, they would rarely kill the other side’s future pillar. Normally, such geniuses would be captured alive and used to force the other side to admit defeat. Then the winner would get some compensation.

When Long Chen captured Yue Wuxu, everyone assumed that Long Chen would use him as a hostage, making the Earth Saint afraid of attacking him. Long Chen would then gain a protective talisman for himself.

However, no one had expected Long Chen to completely disdain this protective talisman and directly destroy it.

“Sorry, what were you saying?” Long Chen swung Evilmoon and rested it back on his shoulder. He eyed the Celestial race’s Earth Saint.

“You goddamn bastard, I will tear you into pieces!” The face of the Earth Saint twisted as he raised his hand. The giant sword that Long Chen had sent flying now appeared in his hand.

BOOM!

His manifestation burst into existence behind him. It was a blurry, blood-colored world, and it was impossible to see what lay within.

When this manifestation emerged, the earth started shaking, and countless experts felt like they had just been struck by a hammer in the pit of their stomachs. Disciples with weaker cultivation bases directly hacked up blood and had to retreat. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“An Earth Saint manifestation.”

“Heavens, an Earth Saint is really going all-out against a Divine Venerate disciple?”

“Is the Celestial race really so shameless?” This person couldn’t help speaking up for Long Chen, but he was shushed by his seniors.

Previously, when the Mortal Saint attacked Long Chen, people were already cursing the Celestial race for being shameless, using seniors to bully juniors. They lacked any propriety.

However, now an Earth Saint had appeared and even summoned his manifestation to attack Long Chen. This meant that the Celestial race had thrown aside their dignity. They just wanted Long Chen dead.

Many people felt Long Chen to be incomparably amazing, especially among the experts of the same generation. Countless people were idolizing him. In this chaotic era, people would always worship strong experts. Hence, when they saw an Earth Saint unleash his full power, they were sweating for Long Chen.

“DIE!”

The Earth Saint roared, diving at Long Chen swiftly like a bird of prey. Clearly, he wanted to kill Long Chen quickly to prevent anyone from saving him.

“If an old bastard like you is still alive, why would I die?” retorted Long Chen, showing no intention of retreating nor the slightest fear. His back bent ever so slightly as he held Evilmoon with both hands. With a shout, six runes of Split the Heavens on Evilmoon lit up once more, and a black bolt of lightning hacked down.

BOOM!

Long Chen had to face this Earth Saint head-on. When these two divine weapons clashed again, a dragon cry shook the heavens. Facing this pressure, numerous experts felt like an invisible hand was clutching their hearts, and many of them almost passed out.

The void twisted and turned, revealing two flying figures.

“What?!”

Both Long Chen and the Earth Saint were sent flying back. From their speed, it seemed that they were evenly matched.

“Evenly matched?! How can that be?!”

Even the senior generation experts were stunned. A Divine Venerate was no different from an ant in front of an Earth Saint, but Long Chen had just toppled that iron law.

“This is an Earth Saint’s power? It’s not that great. At the very least, it’s not enough to be arrogant in front of me.”

Long Chen stabilized himself with three stamps on the ground. At the fourth stamp, the void beneath his feet exploded, and he shot back at the Earth Saint, producing countless afterimages.

When Long Chen appeared in front of the Earth Saint, Evilmoon was already raised high. Once more, he unleashed all six forms in one.

The Earth Saint had just stabilized himself when Long Chen’s saber fell. His hasty block resulted in him being blown away by Long Chen.

“Heavens, what kind of monster is he?”

The spectators felt like they had used up all the shock of their lifetime today. Seeing Long Chen send an Earth Saint flying, even though they were personally witnessing it, they still couldn’t believe it.

“It’s too bad. If we could merge the seventh form as well, even if it didn’t kill it, it’d take half his life,” sighed Evilmoon.

Long Chen quickly followed up after sending the Earth Saint flying. He was like a phantom, catching up to his opponent in an instant.

Long Chen’s technique was very simple, simply repeating the same slash. However, the angle of every slash was different, and it struck the most difficult spot to defend every time. As a result, every attack would throw his opponent off balance.

BOOM!

The Earth Saint was sent flying like a spinning top this time. Seeing this scene, people almost felt like laughing.

However, some sharp-eyed experts saw some clues. They realized that Long Chen had found this Earth Saint’s weak point, striking him at his weakest point.

All of these experts were shocked. Initially, neither Long Chen nor the Earth Saint had a clear understanding of the other's capabilities. Yet, with just two exchanges, Long Chen had swiftly gained the upper hand. All this Earth Saint’s power was stuck inside of him, and Long Chen didn’t give him a chance to unleash it.

Long Chen had trained the Star Cloud Steps to the pinnacle. As a result, his movements were a blur, leaving a trail of afterimages that filled the sky. It seemed as though an army of Long Chens was attacking simultaneously.

BOOM!

Suddenly, all those figures vanished as Long Chen was sent flying, leaving everyone in shock.

“A clone?”

“No, that’s another Earth Saint!”

At some point, another Earth Saint had appeared on the battlefield.
