Chapter 4319: The Humanless World’s Terrifying Heavenly Geniuses

The primal chaos eye was the humanless world’s sacred land. When it was still the Ten Thousand Spirit World, it was a land shared by all ten thousand races, but it was guarded by the human race.

The primal chaos eye was a spring, nestled within a ten-thousand-mile immortal pool, and this pool was formed of the purest primal chaos spirit water.

This spirit spring had immense power. No matter which lifeform, after going through its baptism, they would be completely transformed.

The reason the Ten Thousand Spirit World’s human race had been so powerful was because they were the ones who stood guard over the spirit spring. With that benefit, the human race grew stronger and stronger until it stood at the peak of the ten thousand races.

However, the spirit spring’s power was not limitless. Once its power was used up, it would become tranquil, and no lifeforms could undergo its baptism.

Hence, the Primal Chaos Eye would activate only once every century, during which ten slots would be available for the mightiest Immortal Kings to undergo this transformative baptism. The Immortal King realm was considered the ideal time for this process, and if the timing was too early or too late, the effects would not be maximal.

The current year marked the selection for these baptism spots, drawing experts from all the ten thousand races into fierce competition. The intensity rivaled that of the Sage King Convention, in which Long Chen had previously participated.

The selection this year took an unexpected turn. Through months of competitions, they ultimately whittled the candidates down to twenty peak experts.

According to tradition, these twenty contestants would engage in combat, and the victors would be eligible for the spirit spring's baptism. However, this year, one individual refused to accept defeat and, in a surprising move, chose to take their opponent down with them.

With this, they were down to nine people who qualified for the baptism, and they had no idea what to do. They had to discuss who to give the final spot to. After all, organizing another competition would be time-consuming, and the other contenders were unlikely to be willing to wait that long.

Coincidentally, just as they were discussing it, Long Chen barged through the gate and drew their attention.

When Long Chen was discovered, they immediately came up with the idea that whoever killed these three invaders would be given the final spot for the baptism.

As a result, other than the nine victors, everyone else went crazy searching for them. The nine final losers in particular were going crazy searching for them. Practically, all the lifeforms of the humanless world were frantically searching for Long Chen, all without realizing that he had secretly slipped his way over to the primal chaos eye.

To attract their attention, Xia Chen had detonated a few formation discs from a great distance away, making them think that Long Chen was over there. With that, they managed to travel through the humanless world quite peacefully.

“Not good. There are too many people here.”

Once they got close to the primal chaos eye, their hearts dropped as they saw countless experts gathering there. They seemed to be discussing something.

“Eternal experts. At least ten of them,” said Long Chen with a chill. “Xia Chen, can you check what’s below without disturbing them?”

“I’ll try.” Xia Chen gritted his teeth and took out a formation disc, as well as a few spirit stones. He carefully set up a peering formation.

“Hmph!”

Just as the formation was set up, they heard an icy snort through it.

“What trash. How many days has it been? Can’t they even kill three invaders? If they take another hundred years, are we supposed to wait a century?”

With Xia Chen’s formation set up, the three of them were able to see the situation by the primal chaos eye from a distance.

The speaker was an eagle-eyed youngster with a gloomy expression. His Blood Qi was truly astonishing. When Guo Ran looked at him, chills coursed through his body. This was an incredibly terrifying existence.

“The nine of us have gotten the qualifications for the baptism. Why not just let us do it first? How long are we supposed to wait?” demanded another one. This person had red flames burning all around him, and his face was covered. Seeing him, Long Chen jumped in shock.

This red flame was no fire but Blood Qi that had been compressed into the form of flames. This was an expert of Blood Qi, and he was so powerful that his Blood Qi formed a domain around him. Long Chen had never seen such an existence before.

“That’s right. Just waiting is no solution. Can’t they even deal with three dirty humans? The tenth spot can just be abolished.” The one speaking was a large two-headed lifeform with bulging muscles.

Both of his heads spoke simultaneously, producing an eerie echo that seemed to penetrate deep into people's souls, causing considerable discomfort.

Once again, Long Chen found himself taken aback. This individual had a terrifying physique, indicating astonishing physical strength. However, what caught Long Chen off guard was the fact that he also had formidable Spiritual Strength. In other words, this was a creature with immense power in both aspects, defying the common norms of the cultivation world and turning into a true anomaly.

“I also don’t want to wait. Everyone, how long are we going to wait?” asked another expert. This was surprisingly someone whose identity Long Chen recognized. It was another Kunpeng, and he also had golden wings on his back. However, his aura was countless times greater than the Kunpeng Long Chen had slain. The two were not even close to the same level.

Just then, all the other nine also stood up.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s expressions changed. These nine were unimaginably powerful.

In front of them, the likes of Long Aotian and Lian Wuying were nothing. Xia Chen and Guo Ran had never encountered such terrifying existences within the same realm.

Though the nine individuals hadn't yet released their auras or manifested their powers, Guo Ran and Xia Chen found themselves trembling involuntarily. It wasn't fear that overcame them, but rather an innate instinct warning them of the danger these beings represented. They knew they had to run.

“Boss, let’s leave. Not to mention those Eternal experts, even these monsters aren’t opponents that we can deal with,” said Guo Ran.

If it was a one-against-one, he would have confidence in Long Chen, but there were nine of them. No matter how confident they were in Long Chen, it didn’t matter.

“We can’t leave. They’re already so powerful but care so much about the primal chaos eye. We cannot miss this chance,” said Long Chen.

“But there’s no chance at all!” said Guo Ran.

The primal chaos eye was surrounded by tens of thousands of experts. Not even a fly would be able to get past them. Even if the three of them did manage to fly past them, they wouldn’t be able to leave.

“I’m telling you that the primal chaos pool has some strange laws within it. I think that if we get in, those Eternal experts will be unable to attack us,” said Long Chen, eyeing the water.

“But then how are we going to leave?” asked Xia Chen.

“I have a feeling that we can leave alive. Listen to me. Xia Chen, set up a fixed transportation node. You have to accurately send us to the heart of the spirit spring,” said Long Chen urgently upon seeing the nine of them grow impatient. Luckily, the elders were still discussing something, and it seemed that they were unable to decide.

Hearing Long Chen’s idea, Xia Chen and Guo Ran shivered, but they still followed his instructions. Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Suddenly, the transportation formation activated and the three of them vanished, reappearing at the center of the spirit pool. Their sudden appearance sent the experts discussing matters into a state of shock. They had never imagined that someone would dare intrude upon this sacred place.

The three of them then plunged into the pool, swimming downward until they vanished from view.

“Courting death!”

The nine young experts were particularly enraged and no longer bothered with the elders barring their way. They charged into the spirit pool as well.
