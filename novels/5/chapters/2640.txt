Chapter 2629 Taking Control

Long Chen and Dong Mingyu entered. However, those guards suddenly extended a hand to block Dong Mingyu. Long Chen coldly said, “Scram. What I have to report is related to her. Without her, what am I supposed to report?”

“Get in!”

Before the guard could reply, an angry voice came from within. Apparently, the one inside was not very patient. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The guards were scared off and allowed both of them to enter.

The inside of the cave was filled with a sinister aura. Devil qi swirled inside. It was similar to spiritual qi, so it was the foundation for the devil race’s cultivators. There was a devil qi gathering formation here just like the spirit gathering formations of the Martial Heaven Continent.

As for this Horned King, he was the son of a very large tribe in the devil race. His position was extremely high. As he could be considered the ruler of a nation, he was called his majesty Horned King.

His cave was extremely high level. Even if he hadn’t made the necessary contributions to qualify for it, he had special treatment.

As for the expert that Long Chen was disguised in, he was originally a meaningless member of the people in the Horned King’s kingdom. However, due to his skill in fawning and his vision, as well as being somewhat useful, he was viewed at least somewhat importantly by the Horned King.

However, while the Horned King thought of him highly, the others beside him looked down on him greatly, feeling like his power was lacking. He relied entirely on fawning, so they looked down on him.

The cave was very wide. There was a black pool with devil qi rising out of it, and an expert was seated there. Even seated, he was three meters tall. He was a large and sturdy expert.

Long Chen knew this Horned King’s temper, so he didn’t waste words. “Reporting to his majesty Horned King, your subordinate has two important pieces of news. One is good, and one is bad. The bad news is that our subordinate tribe leader, Ka Er Hu Na Xi was surrounded and killed by a group of Soul Awakening experts from the human race. His corpse was also taken.”

Based on the devil race’s language, the human race’s Netherpassage realm was the devil race’s Soul Awakening realm. Although they were called different things, the realm was the same.

“What?!”

As expected, the Horned King shot up, shouting, “Who killed him?!”

“Reporting to his majesty, it was the Dragonblood Legion of the Martial Heaven Continent. That Long Chen didn’t appear. It was done by his subordinates,” said Long Chen.

“Impossible! Other than lord Heavenwalker, who would have the ability to kill the mid Heaven Merging Ka Er Hu Na Xi while in the Soul Awakening realm?!” demanded the Horned King.

Long Chen was startled. So the Alldevil Heavenwalker was so powerful as to be able to kill a mid Heaven Merging expert on his own?

This was extremely shocking. The truth was that Ka Er Hu Na Xi was killed mostly thanks to luck. It was entirely because of Wilde coincidentally biting him to death, so he clearly hadn’t had a chance to unleash his full power. If he had, the Dragonblood Legion wouldn’t necessarily have been able to defeat him, and the price would have very likely included some sacrifices. This was also why Feng Fei was so shocked that they had accomplished this.

However, based on the Horned King’s tone, it seemed that the Alldevil Heavenwalker possessed that level of power.

Long Chen said, “Other than this bad news, there is some good news. My trusted subordinate snuck into the Martial Heaven Continent and brought back a treasure.” Long Chen suddenly turned to glare at Dong Mingyu. “What are you just staring for?! Hurry and hand over the treasure to his majesty! As long as his majesty is happy, you definitely won’t suffer a loss!”

Dong Mingyu trembled and took out a rolled-up ball of cloth from her chest. Unrolling it, she revealed a sharp dagger. Immediately, intense killing intent filled the entire cave.

“An inherited divine item… This really is something good.”

Just as the Horned King was staring in amazement at the Bloodkill Hall’s inherited divine item, Dong Mingyu stabbed his solar plexus with it. The Horned King really was a fool. He had actually been reaching out to touch it when he saw how terrifying it was. This was a true killing tool that had killed countless powerful experts.

His body instantly stiffened. The dagger’s runes circulated, and his body became locked in runes.

Long Chen then slammed a hand on the back of his head, causing him to faint.

“Hehe, it was so easy,” said Dong Mingyu.

“Giving him a big blow just as he was feeling shock and anger was too easy. His opening is too big.” Long Chen smiled mischievously. This body that he had taken over had firmly supported the Horned King, so he was confident in succeeding.

“Mingyu, keep an eye on the outside. I’ll take control.” Long Chen took out a small sphere of light and placed it on the space between the Horned King’s eyebrows.

Runes lit up on top of the sphere. They were like stars slowly entering the Horned King’s head. He simply lay there, not even twitching. Seeing this, Long Chen couldn’t help sighing in amazement.

“Meng Qi’s soul arts are something I’ll never be able to imitate in this lifetime.”

This sphere was given to him by Meng Qi. She knew that Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was powerful, but he didn’t know how to use it properly. When he did his soulsearches, he used brute power. However, its odds of failure were very high, and even if he succeeded, he only managed to obtain some fragmentary memories that weren’t very useful.

However, Meng Qi’s soulsearch technique was extremely marvelous. She drew her target into an illusion, and their inner secrets were brought out within that illusion. Their memories were then slowly excavated. Therefore, unless she encountered a powerful spiritual seal, all secrets would be exposed by her.

“Damn, so the devil world has this many experts.”

After an hour, Long Chen finished the soulsearch and was amazed. Based on the Horned King’s memories, the devil race had brought millions and millions of tribes.

The small tribes were led by a Heaven Merging expert, while middling tribes had at least a mid Heaven Merging expert. The one that Wilde had bitten to death was from a middle-sized tribe.

As for the Horned King’s father, he was the head of a large tribe, a terrifying existence in the late Heaven Merging realm. Furthermore, his tribe had three late Heaven Merging experts and hundreds of mid Heaven Merging experts.

Moreover, Ka Er Hu Na Xi’s middle-sized tribe was one of their direct subordinates, so his death infuriated the Horned King.

According to his memories, there were hundreds of large tribes already gathered, along with hundreds of thousands of middle-sized tribes. This was truly a world-destroying army. Even Long Chen shivered at the thought of having to fight them.

Just at this moment, the Horned King woke up. However, when he did, a mysterious rune was present in his pupils. That rune slowly faded.

After he woke up, Long Chen slapped him in the face.
