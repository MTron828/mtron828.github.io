Chapter 2148 Heavens’ Soul Manifestation

Long Chen had just vanished when two figures materialized. Both of them wore gray robes and masks, and their hair was already white with age.

The two of them were Netherpassage experts. They held a gourd, but based on the bulging veins on their hands, it was extremely heavy. After bringing that gourd to the entrance to the Yin Yang World, they placed it there and made some hand seals. Then, the runes on the gourd lit up. A torrent of blood burst out of the gourd and struck the Sovereign seal.

The blood instantly transformed into blood mist upon contact with the Sovereign seal. That mist then slowly invaded the Sovereign seal.

After doing that, the two of them took the gourd and left. They didn’t say a word from the start to the end.

Long Chen slowly walked out from behind a boulder. Looking at the Sovereign seal, Long Chen could feel killing intent creep into his eyes.

That blood they had just poured out was composed of the essence blood from billions of different entities. Merging it into the Sovereign seal would dilute the Sovereign’s blood seal, weakening it.

“It really is those bastards from Pill Valley.” Although the two of them had concealed their auras, as a fellow alchemist, he could sense the air of alchemists around them.

“They intentionally drew the qi flow eruption here and are damaging the Sovereign seal. Are they colluding with the Blood race?” Long Chen’s expression was dark.

If that was the case, Pill Valley might be traitors of the human race. But that also felt wrong. Pill Valley had the inheritance of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight. Why would they collude with other races? Wouldn’t that be betraying their gods?

“It doesn’t matter. What matters is power. Don’t you want to take advantage of the qi flow eruption? Let’s see if you can.” Long Chen slowly vanished.

Not long after Long Chen vanished, three more figures appeared. Their leader was the valley master, Yu Xiaoyun.

The other two were incredibly old, doddering elders. Their faces were covered in wrinkles.

These two elders lacked any aura. It was like they were already dead. Their eyes were murky. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You said there were suspicious fluctuations here?” asked Yu Xiaoyun.

The two elders nodded. It seemed that they were so old that they didn’t have the energy to speak.

Yu Xiaoyun pointed and space twisted. Scenes began to appear. They saw a strange figure that was very indistinct. After that, they could see the two masked elders who had appeared with the gourd. The two of them were very clear in comparison.

“It’s Long Chen!” Seeing that indistinct figure, Yu Xiaoyun was surprised. It wasn’t that he had recognized Long Chen, but that the Brahma Divine Diagram had sensed his aura. A sense of unease rose in his heart. “Why would he appear here?”

One of the elders made a throat-cutting gesture. It seemed that he wanted to kill Long Chen to keep him quiet.

“He’s too slippery. Without absolute assurance, we can’t make a move. If he catches hold of any evidence to use against us, it will be troublesome. Moreover, the formation set up here isn’t one from the Martial Heaven Continent. No one would be able to suspect us. If we did react to this, it would be equivalent to admitting that it was us. Let’s just observe for two days before doing anything. If there is no news from the Martial Heaven Alliance during those two days, it means that Long Chen isn’t planning on sharing this secret with anyone else. We can think of something to eliminate him then.”

Yu Xiaoyun left with the two elders. The Sovereign seal faintly appeared within the entrance to the Yin Yang World, seeming to be an indifferent bystander.

...

Long Chen wasn’t able to stay calm as he left the entrance to the Yin Yang World. Just what was Pill Valley’s goal in doing this? Just how did this benefit them?

If he could obtain proof, he could completely destroy Pill Valley and turn them into the continent’s enemy.

However, Pill Valley had come prepared. There was no evidence for him to use against them.

Whether it was the extraction of people’s essence blood in the Brahma secret realm or their arrangements in front of the Yin Yang World, there was no substantial evidence that would point out that this was done by Pill Valley.

The essence blood extraction in the Brahma secret realm had been extremely stealthy. Even Long Chen had barely sensed it, let alone others.

As for what was happening in front of the Yin Yang World, saying it was done by Pill Valley would just be empty words. Pill Valley wouldn’t admit to it.

Long Chen stealthily returned to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory. He then saw that the Dragonblood warriors had managed to awaken their manifestations. Every one of them looked eager for a fight.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors immediately ran over to Long Chen excitedly.

“What, are you thinking of exchanging a few blows with me?” Long Chen smiled as he looked at these brothers of his.

“How could we dare? Boss, I heard the brothers on that side are busy with work every day. Don’t you think it’s wrong for us to be lazing over here? We feel bad for them!” said one of the squad leaders.

“Give it up. You’re more interested in the daily battles they get to have, right?” said Long Chen, laughing. Feeling bad for them? It was clearly jealousy.

“Don’t be impatient. You will also have a chance to go. We’ll rotate through people so that everyone gets a chance,” said Long Chen.

The current Wild World was a treasury for Long Chen and also a training ground. Not only were there Magical Beasts, but there was also the devil race.

Good stuff like that naturally had to be shared with everyone. To avoid drawing other people’s attention, Long Chen had asked Xia Chen to establish a transportation formation capable of crossing worlds.

Naturally, it was expensive to construct a world-crossing transportation formation. When the Xuantian Dao Sect had been reconstructed, Long Chen had added a world-crossing transportation formation to the Spirit World. In truth, the only reason such a formation could be created was because the leader of the Spirit race had given him one of the Life God Tree’s leaves that allowed him to connect with the Spirit World.

The Spirit race’s leader had to use the energy of the Life God Tree to create an opening through the barrier between worlds. Long Chen had set up a one-way transportation formation to the Spirit World in case the Xuantian Dao Sect met enemies that it could not resist. Later on, when Xia Chen joined, he had modified the formation to be two-way.

This formation had never been used up to now. That was because activating it cost an immense price. However, to the current Long Chen, this price was now bearable. Soon, he would start building a transportation formation from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory directly to the Wild World. Although the price was exorbitant, it would allow them to avoid going through the Skyscraping World, reducing the chances of the original devil race being exposed.

Hearing that they could go to the Wild World later, the Dragonblood warriors cheered. Thereafter, Long Chen went into the seclusion area.

“Long Chen!”

Long Chen had just arrived when Meng Qi jumped into his embrace. Long Chen spun her around a few times happily. “Meng Qi, you... have you awakened your manifestation?”

“Yes, it counts as awakened,” said Meng Qi, still holding onto Long Chen with an enchanting smile.

“Counts as awakened? What does that mean?” asked Long Chen.

“I can summon my manifestation, but the name of my manifestation has yet to appear in my mind!” said Meng Qi.

“Heavens!” Long Chen’s jaw dropped. “Are you saying that your manifestation is... one of those legendary heavens’ soul manifestations?”

When a manifestation was fully awakened, its name would automatically appear in the cultivator’s mind. However, there was a kind of manifestation that required a second awakening. It was called a heavens’ soul manifestation. It was said that these manifestations were condensed from the very soul of the Heavenly Daos, making them the strongest of all manifestations.

He had even heard that these legendary manifestations had rankings. Only the top hundred manifestations were heavens’ soul manifestations. Legend had it that people with these manifestations could ascend to become gods or immortals in the future.

Long Chen had never imagined that Meng Qi would have such a chance. He fiercely kissed her and praised, “Meng Qi, you really are my good wife! You’re amazing!”

Meng Qi blushed but was also proud. This manifestation would become a powerful support for her.

Meng Qi said that although her manifestation had not gone through its second awakening, her Spiritual Strength had completely transformed. It was said that those who completed the second awakening of a heavens’ soul manifestation would comprehend their own unique Heavenly Dao divine arts.

Those divine arts were capable of shaking heaven and earth, making ghosts and gods weep. But no one knew any details about it because there were very few historical records of anyone possessing a heavens’ soul manifestation.

“What about Chu Yao, Wan-er, and Zhiqiu? Have they awakened?” asked Long Chen.

“Not yet. For them to still not have awakened, it’s very likely that they also have heavens’ soul manifestations. Hehe, are you happy?” chortled Meng Qi.

“I’m happy, very happy.” Long Chen laughed. This was the best news.

“You’ll have to be more obedient in the future, or Wan-er will put you in your place and we won’t help you,” teased Meng Qi.

Long Chen laughed. Once Tang Wan-er became stronger, he would have to behave better around her.

Long Chen checked on Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and Ye Zhiqiu. He only looked at them from a distance to avoid disturbing them. They were surrounded by primal chaos; light from the heavens blessed them.

Long Chen was full of expectations for them. On the seventh day after he returned, the Wild World’s transportation formation was set up, and Long Chen was just about to have Meng Qi and the other Dragonblood warriors enter when a sudden challenge came.
