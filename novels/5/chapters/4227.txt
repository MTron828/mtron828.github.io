Chapter 4216 Karmic Luck Divine Bead

With a heaven-shaking explosion, that pillar of divine light smashed into the core of the martial stage, its outer edge devoured Xu Yifeng.

BOOM!

The next moment, the incomparably tough barrier at the heart of the martial stage shattered. Only then did people realize that while Long Chen and Xu Yifeng had been fighting, the formation had been gathering power.

And just as Xu Yifeng smashed apart the people of his Xu family, the formation’s power seemed to have reached a peak, causing it to unleash this devastating attack.

Long Chen had immediately fled, but Xu Yifeng reacted too slowly and was caught in that attack. Although he was only brushed against its outer edge, he still screamed as half of his body instantly vanished.

Even with his power, he didn’t have the slightest ability to resist. If he had fled any slower, he wouldn’t have survived.

As the barrier at the center of the martial stage exploded, creating a path, countless experts crazily flooded toward it.

“Damnable human race, scram!”

The experts of the various races poured toward that channel. Thus, even with that enormous opening, it was overcrowded. When everyone got too close, threats and fights broke out. Then the devil race’s experts launched the first attack.

“Damnable devil race, face your deaths!”

The human race refused to appear weaker. In this state, retreat would cause them to lose out on their chance to win the Sage King Convention. If they didn’t go all-out now, when would they?

As a result, a giant flood of experts from every race crashed into the passageway.

“Kill!”

Countless lifeforms roared. Everyone was in a crazy state as it was either kill or die. Unless you wished to give up the position of Sage King, you had to go all-out.

“Boss!”

Guo Ran looked at Long Chen. Since everyone else was already charging forward, Guo Ran was asking permission to do the same.

“No rush.”

Long Chen had been fighting Xu Yifeng. But now, he had lost track of him.

After all, Xu Yifeng had been near the core. Although he had taken a serious blow, due to being so close, he was the first to charge in.

As the experts of the ten thousand races were pouring through, finding Xu Yifeng in their midst would be like searching for a needle in the ocean. Anyway, Long Chen was in no rush to charge through, so he chose to watch first.

Long Chen kept feeling like this martial stage was strange, so he refused to fight for the front of the pack in this state. Anyway, the Sage King Convention was a fight for power. Fighting for a spot at the front? That was the pinnacle of foolishness.

Long Chen wasn’t the only one thinking like this. Quite a few experts were calmly watching as well.

In truth, those lifeforms who were charging forward weren’t fools. They were just triggered after seeing Xu Yifeng charge in right at the start.

After all, Xu Yifeng was a heavenly genius of the Violet Blood race. Since he had gone in, others were unable to wait and just charged in without hesitation.

With such a chain reaction, more and more people were unable to sit still. After a while, the fighting got extremely intense, sending a torrent of blood around the place. It was unknown just how many lifeforms were dying in the chaos.

As they died, they didn’t even know who killed them, as it was far too chaotic. Even within this indiscriminate bloodshed, people continued to charge in.

“Something’s off! There’s a strange fluctuation affecting people’s minds! Everyone, be careful!” exclaimed Meng Qi suddenly.

“Everyone, fall back. Don’t be affected by the blood.” Long Chen also sensed something off.

Hearing this, their hearts shook. They had just felt an intense desire to charge in. Seeing their fellow humans be killed, their anger surged. Fortunately, this warning made them realize that this intense killing intent seemed to have been drawn out of them by some mysterious power.

If they really were to charge into that mess, there was no way they would survive. Now that they had calmed down, they became covered in cold sweat.

Once they fell back, their minds grew clearer. So, upon seeing countless experts still charging in, they shivered.

The weaker disciples, who had come perilously close to death on the staircase, looked at Long Chen and his companions with a mix of reverence and gratitude. If it weren’t for Long Chen, they would have died twice. Furthermore, Long Chen had even fought against Xu Yifeng to protect them. Their gratitude toward him was beyond words now.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Only when everyone was near death could they comprehend the essence of life. Although they might not necessarily comprehend it, they would at least realize just how precious life was.

Suddenly, cracks spread across the martial stage.

“The martial stage is about to explode!” shouted Li Qi.

BOOM!

The next moment, the martial stage exploded and everyone fell down.

The collapsed martial stage then transformed into motes of light falling through the air, following everyone down.

With this martial stage gone, everyone let out startled cries. There was actually another martial stage beneath this one.

It looked similar to the one above, but it was much smaller, less than one-hundredth of its size. Furthermore, at the core of this martial stage was another barrier.

Within it, there were nine golden dragons, their heads pointed inward and their tails extending outward. Their mouths were open as if they were roaring.

Where the nine dragon mouths converged, a golden bead that gave off mystical fluctuations could be seen. Upon witnessing these fluctuations, the pupils of everyone in the vicinity, Long Chen included, constricted in awe.

“Karmic luck bead!”

Long Chen had encountered karmic luck beads in the mortal world before. After the Devil Slaughter Rankings, Long Chen gave that karmic luck bead to Guo Ran, thinking that it wouldn’t be able to change his fate.

When Guo Ran gained this bead, he was blessed with fortune, having fortuitous encounters wherever he went. Even after ascending to the immortal world and ending up in a dangerous place like the Alldevil Star-Field, he miraculously survived the relentless pursuit of his enemy. This fact vividly highlighted the importance of karmic luck.

As a result, the appearance of this karmic luck bead sent Long Chen and Guo Ran into a frenzy. After all, the power of this karmic luck bead was millions of times stronger than the one Guo Ran had absorbed. The difference was like a drop of water next to the vast sea.

“Boss…!”

Guo Ran went crazy upon seeing it. Ever since Long Chen had gifted him a karmic luck bead, he had come to understand the profound significance of karmic luck in a person's life.

In fact, he sometimes regretted taking it for himself. If he had given it to his boss instead, his boss’s accomplishments would definitely be even greater.

Now, seeing this karmic luck bead, Guo Ran swore to obtain it for his boss no matter what.

“We’re going!”

Finally, Long Chen couldn’t sit still any longer and shot toward the core.

However, just as he moved, he sensed an abrupt shift in the surroundings. Mysterious channels had materialized on the martial stage, channeling the fresh blood from the slain experts into the barrier. With the nourishment of that fresh blood, the nine dragons suddenly opened their eyes.
