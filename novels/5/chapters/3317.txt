Chapter 3306 The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy

The plaza was filled with rainbow divine light. The huge statue was glorious and splendid. 

She wore a rainbow dress, and her black hair fell to her waist. Moreover, divine light flickered in her eyes. Those eyes were made of the finest gemstones.

This was the peerless Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, the transformation of a matured Heavenly Rainbow Flame that had cultivated to maturity on its own. Although it was only ranked ninth, her name was something that had left an even deeper impression than other Heavenly Flames.

Long Chen and the others were holding fresh flowers and were in a line to offer them to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

The flowers didn’t need to be bought with money. As long as someone sincerely wished to offer their respects, they would be given these flowers. The ones providing them were very courteous and didn’t even look at a person’s status, position, or cultivation base. As long as they came sincerely, they were allowed to line up.

There were too many people wishing to offer their respects here. Hence, Long Chen and the others could only line up, and it took half a day for them to reach their current spot in line. Some people were already getting impatient.

Other than those from outside the domain, the original inhabitants of the domain had also come to offer worship. It was to express that they had not forgotten the sacrifices that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had made for the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

As for the huge surge of experts from outside the domain who had come in the past few days, almost every single one of them came to pay respects to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. It wasn’t because they had such reverence for the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, but because the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was said to be connected to her heroic spirit. Perhaps offering their respects would increase their odds of obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

Even if they were getting impatient, they had no choice but to endure. They couldn’t express any dissatisfaction because any disrespect to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy would cause the entire Heavenly Rainbow Domain to hunt them down. If that happened, it didn’t matter how strong that person was, they would have no chance of leaving the Heavenly Rainbow Domain alive.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy saved the Heavenly Rainbow Domain by sacrificing herself. All people in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain must be grateful to her. They must understand that everything that they have is thanks to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s sacrifice. There aren’t many people who could do such a thing. Just think about our own Heavenly Swell Domain. Dean Tianlian also sacrificed his own life for the Heavenly Swell Domain’s peace, but people always forget about the past. They no longer remember those people that lost their lives to protect them. They even want to overthrow the name of the Heavenly Swell Domain, changing it back to the Dao Dawn Domain. Just thinking about it makes my heart turn cold.” Bai Shishi sighed as she saw the endless line of people wanting to worship the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. There were countless flowers and people constantly kowtowing toward the statue.

Long Chen shook his head. “People are forgetful, so they need reminders. Sometimes, we shouldn’t blame the Heavenly Swell Domain’s people. It’s our academy that didn’t give any guidance. But as our academy declines, even if they try to guide the people, it would be useless because they no longer believe that the High Firmament Academy has that power. People always believe only in what they can see in front of them. They will always doubt what they haven’t seen. Dismantling history books is what humans like to do the most. In our case, there are even people pushing the waves from behind to twist reality, so naturally people don’t know who to believe. Not everyone has the ability to discern the truth from lies.”

“You sound so at ease. The High Firmament Academy has done so much for the Heavenly Swell Domain, but all we get in return is humiliation,” said Bai Shishi a bit angrily.

Long Chen couldn’t help smiling. “If I’m not going to be at ease, then what am I supposed to do? Kill all the people who can’t see the truth? Would Dean Tianlian want that?”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Then what do you think should be done about it?” demanded Bai Shishi.

Seeing how grateful the people of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain were, it was practically the complete opposite of the Heavenly Swell Domain. They were like a pack of wolves that bite the hand that feeds them. All over, they made things difficult for the High Firmament Academy. 

“Foolish girl, you are only one disciple of the High Firmament Academy. Why bother considering things like this? This should be a problem for the dean. With the dean’s wisdom, do you think he doesn’t understand these things? He simply doesn’t say anything. Just remember, deep water flows slowly. The more words a person says, the less ability that they have. Many times, talking is an instinct and not talking is wisdom.

“If you can’t understand it, then just slowly try to imitate it. Perhaps you will understand by the time you reach the dean’s age,” said Long Chen, smiling. 

Long Chen also didn’t quite know why the Heavenly Swell Domain would end up like this. But he vaguely knew that this matter was not as simple as it appeared. 

Perhaps there were many things hidden behind this that weren’t for others to know. Such a thing should be related to the silent war between the academy and its opponents. The academy naturally wouldn’t expose such a thing to a disciple like Bai Shishi.

Long Chen also didn’t know, but he understood that the higher-ups of the academy were definitely wily old foxes. Some things simply shouldn’t be asked. Even if he asked, it would be meaningless.

Furthermore, he vaguely felt that the various karma he had encountered in the lower plane were off-shoots of some scheme in the immortal world. Now he was following them back up to the source. Perhaps he was gradually getting closer to the answer of this tangled and complicated mystery. Then he would be able to see the true face of the nine heavens and ten lands.

The reason he still couldn’t see them clearly was because his power wasn’t strong enough. Without enough power, he couldn’t stand tall enough to see further. Otherwise, if he tried to stand up high, the winds of the sky would buffet him and tear him apart. He knew what his path was. It was a bloody path of no return. Either he reached the peak, or he died on the way. There was no third option.

Right now, while his status as a nine star heir was not yet exposed, he should grow as fast as he could. He had to accumulate trump cards and find a chance to soar through the layers of mist. He would then see this world clearly.

Sometimes, Long Chen felt very lonely. He knew many things, but he had no one to share those things with. His burdens were his own to carry. However, this pressure only stimulated him. It was what drove him toward the unknown future.

“You talk as if you’re so much older than me,” said Bai Shishi unhappily.

“You should be a bit bigger,” said Long Chen. Bai Shishi really was a year older than him. But he also couldn’t help sneaking a glance at Bai Shishi’s chest when he said this.

This phrase instantly became ambiguous. Bai Shishi reddened. The two of them were whispering, so fortunately others didn’t hear. Bai Shishi then furiously reached out and viciously pinched Long Chen’s waist. Long Chen clenched his teeth in pain but didn’t make a sound. It wouldn’t be good if others were to think that he was flirting with someone here.

Seeing that he didn’t dare to make a sound, Bai Shishi smiled, feeling very pleased. It could count as a win.

“Brat, are you Long Chen? What qualifications do you have to offer sacrifice to the great Heavenly Rainbow Fairy?”

Just as Long Chen and Bai Shishi were talking, someone walked in front of Long Chen, glaring at him coldly.

This person was half a head taller than Long Chen and very well-built. His Blood Qi might be meticulously concealed, but he still gave off a heavy pressure. He was definitely a very powerful existence. His cultivation base had reached the seventh Heavenstage of the Four Peak realm, and he came up to Long Chen with plenty of hostility.

Long Chen immediately slapped him. Ah, it was refreshing to unleash the irritation at being pinched by Bai Shishi.

“Bastard, you dare to blaspheme the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy?! I’ll go all-out against you!”

Long Chen suddenly grabbed that person’s hair and slammed the head into his knee. Bai Shishi jumped in shock, not expecting Long Chen to dare to attack someone here.
