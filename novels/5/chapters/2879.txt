Chapter 2868 Allowed to Kill

Luo Ning stuck her tongue out at Luo Bing, but she was grateful. The Luo family’s familial teachings were very strict. She had almost committed a grave crime.

“Long Chen, I apologize, but the Luo family’s matters really can’t be exposed to outsiders. Please forgive us,” said Luo Bing.

“It’s fine. That’s completely understandable. In any case, we’re now firm allies. We can face the Chu family together,” said Long Chen.

He knew that he couldn’t rush the matter with his mother. Luo Bing and Luo Ning couldn’t just trust him to the point of telling him such things.

If his mother really was the Luo family head’s daughter, then she should at least be safe. It was his father’s fate that was more worrisome. But there was nothing he could do about it in his current state.

“Since we’re allies, I have to warn you. Chu Kuang is not easy to deal with. It’s not just him. Many parts of the academy have the Chu family’s influence soaked into them. The God Institute’s higher-ups in particular have the Chu family’s people,” said Luo Bing.

“Really? The High Firmament Academy simply allows the Chu family to stretch their claws into their management?” Long Chen couldn’t help frowning. Was the dean of the academy an idiot?

“The waters of the High Firmament Academy run very deep. No one is actually clear on its true power. As for the dean, he hasn’t revealed his face in thousands of years. He has always been an unfathomable existence. Furthermore, the interior of the academy seems to be in disorder. No one knows what the higher-ups are thinking by not dealing with it. In any case, the Chu family’s influence in the academy is very strong. But even we are unsure just how far their claws stretch,” said Luo Bing.

If the Chu family is so powerful here, aren’t you at a great disadvantage fighting him in the academy?” asked Long Chen.

“The Luo family are mortal enemies with the Chu family. Wherever the Chu family’s disciples appear, the Luo family’s people will appear as well. This is an enmity with no rest. Within the academy, everything must be done according to the rules, so even the Chu family doesn’t dare to break them. If they are caught, there will only be trouble for them. Anyway, the Luo family also has some power within the academy, so it’s not a one-sided battle. We play this game according to the rules. Once an opportunity is grasped, one side will devour the other side’s pieces. Just now, the two of us were almost devoured due to our carelessness,” sighed Luo Bing. This time had truly been dangerous. They had been too careless.

Chu Kuang had truly concealed himself well, acting brainlessly arrogant just to make them underestimate him. He was like a viper waiting for a moment to strike and kill his prey.

Long Chen nodded. The Luo and Chu families’ enmity had already reached the point that it was part of their blood and soul. There was no rest until death. If the Luo family retreated from the academy, it would be like admitting defeat. It was due to this that the Luo family continued to lie in wait in the High Firmament Academy for an opportunity to strike back despite their inferior position here.

“You were all tricked by Chu Kuang. With your power, there is a huge gap compared to him. He has always been disguising himself as a pig to eat the tiger,” said Long Chen.

Luo Bing nodded. “It’s true. No one had thought that Chu Kuang would be so powerful when he went all-out. The two of us would probably be unable to last even ten moves against him.”

“No, you’re wrong. He did not reveal his full power today,” said Long Chen.

“What?!”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning were both startled. Even with that much power, it wasn’t all of Chu Kuang’s power?

“Today, Chu Kuang revealed at most seventy percent of his full power. It might even be less than that. Although I really look down on him, I must admit that he’s strong. He’s also crafty. I even intentionally used the Heavenly Flame seed to provoke him into revealing his full power, but he still refused,” said Long Chen.

Just how great was Long Chen’s battle experience? He had been keeping track of just how much Chu Kuang had been holding back. This fellow truly knew how to endure. He was not a wild idiot like he appeared to be normally.

“If he really held back that much, then only ninety percent of his power would have been enough to suppress the Heavenly Flame seed. He might even be able to capture it. Why did he run?” asked Luo Ning.

Long Chen smiled and didn’t say anything. Inside, he thought that if Chu Kuang really dared to use ninety percent of his power, then he might not be able to escape afterward with his remaining energy.

“He truly is powerful. Shouldn’t we inform the family that we need reinforcements?” Luo Ning looked at Luo Bing.

Luo Bing shook her head. “This generation’s registration has already ended. The academy’s rules are set in stone, so they won’t be accepting more disciples until the next generation. If we asked to use other channels to get the geniuses of the family in, the family head would definitely reject it. He will not permit something that will tarnish the family’s face.”

Long Chen couldn’t help curling his mouth. The Luo family clearly didn’t want to use a backchannel. For example, something like what he had done, becoming a worker just to become a disciple. They would consider that embarrassing.

“Long Chen, don’t misunderstand…” Luo Bing instantly realized what Long Chen was thinking. He had been in a rush and had used an unorthodox method to enter the academy.

“It’s fine. I’ve never cared about something like status. There are no shortcuts to the path of cultivation, and there is no higher or lower path. As for me, I don’t do things like slapping my own face to make it look bigger.” Long Chen shook his head.

Long Chen did not fully approve of the Luo family head’s methods. Arrogance was not something to show to others; it was something to keep within you. Those who assumed an air of arrogance were always viewed by Long Chen to be concealing their own feelings of inferiority.

“Then what do we do? We can’t beat him ourselves!” exclaimed Luo Ning worriedly.

“We can only temporarily endure. Once we enter the inner academy, we’ll link up with the other experts of the family. Then we can come up with a plan,” said Luo Bing after a moment’s thought.

“Ah, that’s right. Long Chen, don’t fight Chu Kuang head-on in the future. Don’t give him a chance to kill you,” warned Luo Bing suddenly.

“Kill me?” Long Chen was first confused, but he then smiled. “It’s fine. He can’t kill me.”

Luo Bing’s expression turned serious. “Long Chen, I know that you’re very powerful. However, you can’t possibly know just how immense the Chu family’s power is. Chu Kuang is so powerful right now. Once he enters the Divine Flame realm, he will be unrivaled in his realm and can easily fight across realms. You cannot be careless. A genius like Chu Kuang must have countless resources invested in him. Who knows how many trump cards he has? You will be at a disadvantage in a head-on fight.”

Long Chen’s power was something that Luo Bing had just witnessed. But during the fight, Long Chen hadn’t dared to face Chu Kuang head-on and only dodged. Since that was the case, Luo Bing felt that Long Chen was one level weaker than Chu Kuang and might die to his hands just for face.

“Are you able to kill people during the divine competition?” Long Chen didn’t reply, instead asking his own question.

“If the opponent shouts that they concede, you must immediately stop. But if they don’t say anything, killing them will only result in a light punishment. So I’m worried that he…” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Ah, then I’m at ease.” Long Chen nodded and smiled.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning sighed with relief, mistaking that smile’s meaning. They still didn’t understand the character of Boss Long San.
