Chapter 2563 Leaving Things Like This

Just as everyone was still stunned by the High Priest’s arrival, a fist smashed into the giant bell. The sound of the bell made everyone jump.

They looked over to see Long Chen punch the bell. The bell’s divine light was rapidly fading.

Long Chen was holding the bronze fragment in his fist. That was a fragment of the real Eastern Wasteland Bell, and it had its own consciousness. It had wanted to come out as soon as the fake bell had appeared, but the primal chaos space had suppressed it.

When the High Priest appeared and showed his power, Long Chen immediately grew gutsy again. He punched the bell, pressing the fragment against it. In that instant, the fragment unleashed a terrifying suction force, absorbing the energy of the fake bell.

“This bell was made with the Eastern Wasteland Bell’s source energy, but it lacks the item-spirit. Now I can take its source energy.”

Long Chen was delighted to see this. He then repeatedly punched the bell, holding the bronze fragment where people couldn’t see it.

The sound of a bell tolling resounded through heaven and earth. Ripples spread in every direction. At this moment, the stars shook, looking like they might explode.

All the experts clenched their heads in pain, feeling like the world was flipping around them.

“What is boss doing?” Guo Ran clenched his head, feeling like it might explode. But even his own shout was drowned out by the bell, and he couldn’t hear himself.

Looking at this scene, the Ye family head was startled, so he hastily formed hand seals, trying to pull the bell back. However, he found that the bell was now separated from his soul.

A final explosion rang out, followed by a cracking sound. The giant bell suddenly shrank until it was only three meters tall, and there was now a bowl-sized hole at its top.

“Ah?”

Everyone’s jaws dropped, and their eyes almost popped out. Long Chen had smashed a hole into such a terrifying divine item with his fist? They couldn’t believe their eyes.

Although Daoist Heavenly Feather had said that it was a counterfeit, they had clearly seen its power just now. It was able to match the Northern Source Sword, so that power had terrified all of them.

However, this bell was now broken by Long Chen’s fist? If Long Chen really had that ability, how could he have been forced to this point?

“My source energy! You damn bastard!” The Ye family head finally pulled back the bell. When he saw the hole and sensed the Source Qi flowing away, he turned green.

He formed hand seals again, and divine light plugged the hole, preventing more Source Qi from escaping.

However, he was unable to stop the leak. No matter how he tried, in just a few breaths of time, all the Source Qi faded away.

This terrifying counterfeit of the Eastern Wasteland Bell turned into a pile of rubbish just like that. Hence, the Ye family head suddenly turned toward Long Chen furiously. His face was twisted like that of a ghoul.

“What are you looking at me for? For you to replicate the Eastern Wasteland Bell is a blasphemy to the real Eastern Wasteland Bell. I broke it. So what? If you don’t like it, why don’t you try attacking me? Let’s see if the High Priest can slap you to death in one blow.” Long Chen clasped his hands behind him, looking down arrogantly on the Ye family head. That posture definitely made him look like he needed a spanking.

If only he had known before that the High Priest was so terrifying, why would he have to act conservatively? He could have gone all-out right from the start. Perhaps he could have even eliminated Jiang Wuchen or Ye Liangchen.

Long Chen was vexed inside, but he didn’t show it. He wanted to show that he was in complete control of everything.

He had the support of Daoist Heavenly Feather with her Northern Source Sword, and there was also the High Priest hiding in the back. With these backings, even the supreme experts of the divine families wouldn’t dare to act rashly.

Suddenly, the Zhao family head saw someone standing in the distance. That person was the white-robed Yun Tian.

Yun Tian had been standing in the distance the entire time. He had not participated in the battle, but he was also not standing amongst the neutral faction. He had just been quietly watching the entire time, seemingly pondering something. Many people had failed to sense his existence.

“Big brother Yun Tian, watch out!” shouted Long Chen.

The Zhao family head needed to vent her anger somewhere, and unable to touch Long Chen, she had suddenly switched targets. One of her claws reached out for Yun Tian’s throat.

They were too far for Long Chen to get there in time. More importantly, even if he could, his cultivation base was too low to stop her. Long Chen was infuriated. The divine families were truly shameless, without any of the mannerisms of experts. This old woman was repeatedly attacking her juniors.

In the face of this terrifying Heaven Merging expert, Yun Tian didn’t panic in the slightest. A rune lit up on his forehead, unleashing ripples of light that formed a domain around her.

That rune was an immortal character for Sovereign.

“A Sovereign’s aura! That person is…”

Everyone’s hearts pounded wildly. The boundless might of a Sovereign was calm and gentle. It didn’t give them a threatening feeling. Instead, it made them feel a profound reverence.

Yun Tian calmly slashed his sword. In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, the Zhao family head’s hands left her body.

“What?!”

Including Long Chen, everyone’s jaws dropped. The Zhao family head’s hands were covered in scales and were extremely terrifying. But they were still cut off by Yun Tian.

That swing of his sword had appeared simple. It was like he was chopping a radish, but rather than a radish, he had cut off the hands of a terrifying Heaven Merging expert.

Yun Tian casually swung his sword again, slashing her neck. However, she had rapidly retreated, causing his sword to only slice across her neck but not cut her head off. Blood splashed, but the cut was not to the bone.

She rapidly retreated out of his domain. Once she was out, the Sovereign character faded away along with the Sovereign might.

“What was that?” Everyone felt like they were dreaming. This world had gone crazy. They were seeing things that repeatedly toppled their understanding of the world.

Long Chen had broken a terrifying divine item with his fist. This mysterious white-robed man had cut off the arms of a Heaven Merging expert, almost cutting off her head. Everyone felt like their head was too slow to function.

“Why don’t we leave today’s matter as is?” Just at this moment, a powerful voice resounded from a distance. There was only the sound, but no one revealed themself.

The voice was extremely old but possessed unquestionable dignity. Even the laws of heaven and earth quivered in its presence.

“Since the Lord Venerate is giving us face, how could I take advantage? This is just a misunderstanding anyway. It would be best if things ended here.” The High Priest’s voice also rang out.

After just speaking once, both voices faded away. The Ye family head then clenched his teeth. With one last snort, his figure vanished.

The Zhao family head’s face was twisted in fury. It looked exceptionally frightening like this, almost like a demon.

Although her arms had grown back out and the wound on her neck was healed, she was still covered in blood as a record of her disgrace.

Zhao Ritian had died, and she had failed to avenge him. She had tried to kill Yun Tian, only to almost be killed by him. This was the greatest humiliation in the Zhao family’s history.

“Just wait. I’ll make you regret being born in this world,” cursed the Zhao family head before also leaving.

“Long Chen, once I activate my Spirit Bone, I’ll take your head,” said Jiang Wuchen before stepping into his war chariot with Feng Fei and leaving.

“Long Chen, count yourself lucky this time. No one can live off luck for a lifetime, next time, you will definitely die to my sword.” Ye Liangchen also said some parting words. He was extremely irritated at having his manifestation interrupted and not being able to show his full power.

Today, the Martial Heaven Alliance had people to support it, and even the Lord Venerate had given his orders. Today’s matter ended here, so Ye Liangchen could only leave.

Long Aotian eyed Long Chen. He wanted to say something, but after thinking about it, he decided to leave without saying it.

The divine families’ people all left. The Pill Fairy brought Pill Valley’s people away, and Di Long brought the ancient family alliance’s people with him. As for the Corrupt path, Ye Ming never revealed himself again.

The few remaining disciples of the Corrupt path were brought away by Xie Wentian. Looking at this, Long Chen glanced at the old man questioningly. Could they not eliminate the Corrupt path and the sea demon race right here?

However, the old man silently shook his head. Although Long Chen didn’t know why, he accepted it.

The neutral faction’s experts came forward to congratulate Long Chen, but he ignored them. Instead, he went to greet the elders of the Nangong family, Beitang family, and Mo family.

Long Chen was filled with disdain for the neutral experts. Even now, they were still remaining neutral. Did they think just watching the entire time would make them safe?

When the storm came, no one could just stand to the side. The battle of the dark era was imminent. Even now, they were unable to think of the Martial Heaven Continent and were only thinking about themselves. Such people were the most contemptuous.

After some brief exchanges, Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue said goodbye to Long Chen, bringing their disciples away.

“Long Chen, let me introduce you. This is the Music Master of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, our leader. Even the palace masters are her apprentices.”

At this moment, Zi Yan brought the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s disciples over, and she held the hand of a middle-aged woman.

This middle-aged woman looked gentle and refined, giving off an air of nobility. It was like she was a kind elder.

“Junior Long Chen greets senior.” Long Chen bowed.

“As expected of an unrivaled hero, Zi Yan has not misjudged you.” The old woman smiled at Long Chen.

The other female disciples of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace giggled behind her, causing Zi Yan to blush. She had not thought that the Music Master would speak so directly.

“Music Master, why did you not take action just now? Have you forgotten the status of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace?”

Just at this moment, an icy voice rang out that made everyone shiver.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
