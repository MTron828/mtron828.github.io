That troublemaker was Qi Hua. Despite his weak power, he couldn’t be underestimated as his ability to adjust to situations was amazing. The instant he saw things turning against him, he fled.

However, this time, Long Chen had his eye on him. The moment he moved, Long Chen gave the Long clan expert an order.

The expert, overjoyed to receive an order from Long Chen, disappeared without a word. With a gust of wind, he reappeared, holding Qi Hua.

The Long clan expert immediately tossed Qi Hua to the ground and said, “Senior apprentice-brother—no, master, I’ve caught this fellow for you. As long as you give the word, I’ll tear off his skin and grind his bones to dust. Yes, I recall now! He was the one who said this hateful sentence!”

The Long clan expert actually called Long Chen master, acting like a complete junior. Most importantly, he did it completely happily, as if he was profiting from doing so.

“It wasn’t me!” cried out Qi Hua.

The Long clan expert directly slapped him, and he fell silent.

“How dare you lie at this time?!” the Long clan expert shouted. Having found a scapegoat, how could he let Qi Hua argue back?

Suddenly, Long Chen shouted, “Who dares to leave?!”

Some people started to have bad feelings and wanted to slip away, but with one shout from Long Chen, they were terrified out of their minds and stopped moving.

Those who wanted to run were Qi Hua’s mercenaries. As for the Long clan’s disciples, they were too baffled to do anything. Should they stay or should they run?

“Big Brother Fang, Big Sister Yu, why don’t you tell me how we should deal with these people? Their life and death is up to you,” said Long Chen.

Fang Liude and the others were stunned. They were never skilled with words and had no idea how to respond.

Before this, when Long Chen had called them big brother and big sister, they hadn’t thought much of it. However, now they felt a crushing pressure.

They all looked at each other nervously, none of them knowing what to say. In the end, Yu Ying asked, “How don’t you decide?”

Their indecision was understandable. After all, their circumstances had prevented them from seeing the greater world. Usually, even ordinary outer disciples of the Long clan were people they had to be courteous toward. Hence, seeing a nine-star Doyen of the Long clan willing to accept Long Chen as master, they were stunned speechless.

“Alright. What’s your name?” asked Long Chen while looking at the expert with the crooked head.

“This little one is Gui Jiu. I’m from the Two-Head Black Tortoise race,” he answered immediately.

Long Chen looked at him speechlessly. So, he had turned this Two-Head Black Tortoise into a One-Head Black Tortoise.

“Eliminate that trash,” ordered Long Chen.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Gui Jiu immediately kicked Qi Hua, killing the latter without hesitation.

“The ones who attacked our hunting party, you can just kill yourselves,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“No!”

Those who had come with Huanghui all turned pale.

Before Long Chen said anything, Gui Jiu directly killed those outer disciples.

“Tch, you could have kept your corpses intact, but you just had to throw away that chance,” snorted Gui Jiu.

Long Chen was surprised, not expecting Gui Jiu to have this daring. They were clearly disciples of the Long clan, but Gui Jiu didn’t hesitate to kill them.

The other Long clan disciples were also shocked. They didn’t know who Long Chen was for Gui Jiu to instantly turn against them. If Long Chen wanted Gui Jiu to attack them, what could they do?

They turned pale. This calamity came too suddenly, with no warning at all. They couldn’t even run.

Fortunately, Long Chen didn’t target them. Instead, he turned to the mercenaries with a sneer. “Everyone is living at the lowest level of the Heavenly Desolation Domain. Against the strong, you bend your knee and fawn. But against your peers, you scheme and drag each other down. You act like sheep against experts but become monstrous beasts against weaklings. In fact, you are even more brutal and bloodthirsty than beasts.”

Those mercenaries could only look at Long Chen fearfully. Suddenly, one of them knelt, and the others immediately followed suit.

“Long Chen, why not just…” Yu Ying was a bit unwilling, but Fang Liude immediately pulled her back and shook his head. Since she had told Long Chen to decide, she shouldn’t be asking him to change his mind now.

Long Chen shook his head. “You pity them now. But when they thought they got you, they happily watched you suffer. Did they pity you back then?”

Hearing this, Yu Ying gritted her teeth and didn’t reply. When she recalled their bloodthirsty look, her pity mostly faded.

Long Chen turned back to the mercenaries and said, “Don’t act pitiful now. I tossed aside that worthless pity when I was a teenager. My kindness is only reserved for kind people, not for you. When Huanghui said he marked the Six Horn Sea Serpent, didn’t you all say that you saw the mark? If you were so willing to lie about what you saw, your eyes must be worthless. Dig out your own eyes.”

“No!”

Someone begged for mercy. After all, injuries to the eyes were much more difficult to heal compared to a lost arm or leg.

Even for talented experts with a thick foundation, healing such a wound would require them to use a large number of medicinal pills. These mercenaries didn’t have that much money. With their financial straits, if they dug out their eyes, they really would have no eyes. Although cultivators could rely on divine sense instead, that ugly appearance would stay with them for a lifetime.

The one to shout was directly killed by Gui Jiu. He sneered, “You really don’t know how to recognize kindness. You wanted your lives to be spared, and now the price is only a pair of eyes. If it was me, not one of you would be leaving alive.”

As they saw how ferocious Gui Jiu was, screams of pain quickly echoed through the air.

“You can scram now!” Gui Jiu snorted and kicked those people away. After that, he came to Long Chen’s side.

“Aren’t you letting them off too easily? These people know how to hold a grudge, and they won’t thank you for sparing them. It would be better to rip them out by the roots instead… Why are you looking at me like that? Did I misspeak?” asked Gui Jiu, growing nervous at being stared at.

“You don’t seem stupid. How did you end up getting conned by the Celestial race back then?” asked Long Chen.

Embarrassed, Gui Jiu scratched his head. “I thought I was really badass back then. People always have to pay a price for their dumb arrogance.”

Suddenly, a mighty demonic qi filled the air as two giant golden bulls emerged, dragging another war chariot over. This chariot was emblazoned with a large dragon on it.

Upon seeing that chariot, Gui Jiu was shocked. “A ranked chariot! The rank ten Long Ziwei of the Heaven Rankings has come.”
