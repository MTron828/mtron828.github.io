Chapter 4574 Cemetery of Dragons

From Long Chen’s hidden location, he saw hundreds of thousands of experts within the core hall of this nest.

Tens of thousands of them belonged to the white dragon race, distinguishable by the pristine white robes and the powerful yet serene Blood Qi that surrounded them.

If the Blood Qi of other branches of the dragon race were like explosive mountain floods, then the white dragon race’s Blood Qi was like a calm lake.

In contrast, the Netherdragon race stood opposite them, clad in all black, outnumbering the white dragon race by tenfold. Long Chen didn’t recognize a single one of them.

“It seems that the Netherdragon race still has many branches. Hmm, their leader this time has some ability.” Long Chen’s gaze instantly focused on the leader of the Netherdragon race. This person’s aura was on par with Feng You, but Long Chen sensed that he was slightly weaker than her.

When Long Chen turned to the white dragon race’s side, he saw a beautiful woman with white ribbons on her dress, looking like a beautiful fairy. Her skin was as pure as snow, and her long hair cascaded like a waterfall down her back. The striking contrast of her black hair against the pristine white of her dress left Long Chen captivated by her beauty.

With her eyebrows locked in a tight frown, she coldly said, “Even sheep have horns that can deal a deathblow to tigers and wolves.”

“Hahaha, a deathblow? That chance is far too low, isn’t it? I’ve seen tigers eat sheep, but never sheep eating tigers. Your horns are only ornamental,” sneered the lean man.

This person was so lean that he didn’t look like he had any flesh on his cheeks. This smile of his was like scrunching leather, and the folds on his skin were so tight they could crush a mosquito. It was a really bizarre sight.

“How dare you be so rude to Our Highness?” Another expert beside the woman raised his sword at the lean man.

“What? Do you think that you can challenge me? Give up. Your sheep horn can’t harm me,” sneered the lean man disdainfully.

“You...!” Being looked down upon this much, that expert was enraged. After all, those who had reached this place were all experts amongst experts. Being insulted like this, the young expert was going to attack immediately.

“Hold it!” The white-robed woman raised her hand to stop him. She then turned toward the Netherdragon race’s leader. “Are you blocking us because you want to fight? If that’s the case, I, Yingxue, will be your opponent.”

She faced that man without the slightest fear, her aura calm but exuding an immeasurable depth.

Hidden at the back, Long Chen couldn’t gauge her power either. Despite his keen observation, her aura proved mysterious and difficult to discern.

Nevertheless, drawing from his experience, Long Chen didn’t think that the skinny little bastard would stand a chance against her.

“Hahaha, you misunderstood. We’re simply passing through. When I heard the white dragon race boasting such grandiose claims, I couldn’t resist correcting your misguided thought. Although I’ve never had the pleasure of meeting the white dragon princess, I've certainly heard your esteemed reputation. I couldn’t bear the white dragon race taking the wrong step in life,” the lean man laughed.

“Oh? What wrong step?” asked the woman.

“This time, the opening of the dragon domain’s gate is on an unprecedented scale. Countless elites of the dragon race have entered the Fantasy Spirit World, and even monsters that sealed themselves away have awakened. For so many peak experts to flood the cemetery of dragons, not only will they sweep through all these treasures, but they’ll also aim for the divine altar at the center. Your white dragon race didn’t have the power to claim your ancestral scale, so naturally someone else will take it. If you were to try to stop them, you would only be seeking death,” replied the lean man indifferently.

“My white dragon race doesn’t need you to worry about the matter of our ancestral scale!” said the white-robed woman.

“I’m just warning you out of the kindness in my heart. Your white dragon race will definitely be at a disadvantage between the clash of the dragon races. However, I have a proposal. I can guarantee your race’s safety and can even peacefully help you take your ancestral scale.”

Before the woman could even reply, the man beside her sneered, “We don’t believe the Netherdragon race would be so kind.”

“That’s true, we don’t do this out of kindness. If we are to help you, we must obtain something as well!” chortled the lean man.

“And what is that?” demanded the man of the white dragon race.

“Oh, it would be your princess!” declared the lean man, his finger pointing at the white-robed woman.

The moment these words left his lips, the air crackled with intense killing intent from the white dragon race’s side; this insolent man had dared to insult their princess. They all took out their weapons.

At the same time, the Netherdragon race’s side also brandished their weapons. A battle seemed to be on the verge of erupting.

“Hey, what are you doing? Put away your weapons. Do you think you can offend the princess? Do you not want your lives anymore?” the lean man shouted at his subordinates, baffling them. They didn’t know what he was planning. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The lean man turned back to the woman, a smile gracing his lips. “You see, our family’s young master is the future leader of the entire Netherdragon race. He has long admired your beauty and intellect and wants to get closer to you. You see—”

“Scram!” The woman finally lost her cool. The Netherdragon race had clearly infuriated her.

In general, the dragon race was very proud and would rather die standing than live kneeling, not to mention the white dragon race. While they weren’t the strongest out of all dragons, they cared the most about honor.

Despite their kindness, they refused to tolerate bullying. Furthermore, marriage alliances had never existed in the history of the white dragon race. Hence, the proposition to marry off their princess in such a manner was an unacceptable insult.

That was why the lean man’s words were exceptionally enraging to them, bordering on blasphemy.

“Don’t be like this. Let me tell you, our young master is the leader of the Netherdragon race’s eight hundred and seventy-two branches. He will have the greatest authority in the Netherdragon race in the future. As for his power, it is simply unimaginable. The likes of us are nothing compared to him. Are you really not even going to consider it?” asked the lean man.

The woman didn’t reply and slowly reached for the sword at her waist. Seeing this scene, the lean man hastily retreated. “Don’t get emotional! There’s no rush! You should consider it slowly. I should tell you, our young master is Netherdragon Tianzhao. If you do think it through, you can marry our young master at any time, hahaha!”

He laughed as he retreated, seemingly very pleased with the white dragon race’s fury. Just as he was about to lead his people away, a disdainful voice rang out.

“Who does Netherdragon Tianzhao think he is? Last time I knocked out all his teeth and he didn’t learn his lesson yet?”
