Chapter 4433 No Rest Until Death!

In the blink of an eye, everything—be it the divine light filling the sky, the very fabric of heaven and earth, or the half-step Doyen—was sliced apart. A hidden figure slowly materialized, revealing its form in the aftermath.

“What?”

The onlookers gazed in dumbfounded shock as the half-step Doyen hovered in midair, motionless. His eyes slowly looked down, and his sword started to split apart.

“You aren’t fit to use a sword.”

An icy snort echoed, accompanied by the distinct sound of a sword being sheathed, its resonance penetrating deep into the hearts of the spectators.

The half-step Doyen’s gaze abruptly dimmed, and the fire in his soul extinguished along with the sheathing of the sword.

Following that, the bisected corpse plummeted to the ground, the impact echoing like a hammer striking at the hearts of those who witnessed it.

As their gazes lifted up from the corpse, they saw a white-robed man with a sword strapped to his back. In an instant, their expressions changed simultaneously.

They did not recognize Yue Zifeng. Despite his name gaining recognition during Long Chen’s triumph at the Sage King Convention, the limelight had been squarely on Long Chen. As a result, figures like Guo Ran, Yue Zifeng, and others were simply viewed as Long Chen’s subordinates, drawing little attention.

Now though, Guo Ran had defeated a half-step Doyen, and Yue Zifeng was even more amazing, killing that idiot in one move. Just how terrifying was that?

At this juncture, not a single person could be called a true Heavenly Doyen yet. Even the Jiang clan’s heavenly genius, Jiang Wenyu, was a step shy from being one. Despite the seemingly minor gap, it proved to be an uncrossable gulch for many experts.

Even someone as powerful as Jiang Wenyu could only be considered a budding Doyen. Witnessing someone of his caliber fall in battle left him profoundly shaken.

“You… you… you dared to kill my family’s young master?! Our Heaven’s Gate will have no rest until we avenge him!”

When that half-step Doyen was slain, the dozens of Eternal experts accompanying him were both shocked and enraged. They had never dreamed that their young master would meet his end here.

Furthermore, the killer gave them no chance to save their young master. By the time they reacted, he was already deader than dead. Seeing the corpse of their young master, they felt like they were trapped in a nightmare.

“No rest until you avenge him? Fine, then let there be no rest until death!” Long Chen eyed them coldly.

Suddenly, the whole Dragonblood Legion vanished. When they reappeared, they were already surrounding those Eternal experts and hundreds of others wearing the same robes as the slain half-step Doyen.

Just like that, blood flew through the air, and Sword Qi tore through the world.

In less than a single breath, the Dragonblood Legion was back in their original location. The onlookers were astonished to find that the Eternal experts had vanished from where they stood, leaving behind only bloodstains on the ground. Not even a trace of their corpses remained.

“Since there’s no rest until death, there’s nothing more to say. Despite being humans, you only know how to bully your fellow humans, while submitting to others. I detest such people the most. Who else wants to have no rest until death with us? Step forward. As the commander of the Dragonblood Legion, I will accomplish your wish,” announced Guo Ran.

The Dragonblood Legion’s sudden assault scared everyone. In an instant, dozens of Eternal experts and hundreds of heavenly geniuses were instantly wiped out, not having a chance to even scream.

The Dragonblood Legion was so powerful that the battle ended in the blink of an eye. Their terrifying killing power gave others goosebumps.

Originally, many experts here wanted to sneer at Long Chen and test him. Now, they were too scared to try.

As for the Jiang clan’s experts, especially the two budding Doyens, they were fully stupefied. Just now, they hadn’t even bothered to greet Long Chen or look at his subordinates.

However, the ants they had looked down upon now displayed a power that sent shivers down their spines. They couldn’t stop their hearts from pounding crazily.

The most terrifying thing was how everyone from the Dragonblood Legion, from top to bottom, showed indifferent expressions, as if nothing significant had just occurred.

Even the most ordinary Dragonblood warrior showed no emotion after slaying those Eternal experts. It was as if they had just done something trivial.

Such calmness, coupled with an unyielding ruthlessness, sent shivers down the spines of even the battle-hardened warriors. The Dragonblood warriors were like reapers from hell, their gazes piercingly cold and merciless.

“Hmph! No wonder he brings so many people even though the occasion later is a solo fight. He’s using his strong subordinates as a powerful backing,” said one of the Jiang clan’s budding Doyens.

“Even if you don’t constantly talk, people won’t assume that you’re a mute!” Feng Fei finally couldn’t endure it any longer. “If Long Chen didn’t have absolute power, who would be willing to follow him? Have you seen a little brother willingly call himself little when he’s stronger than his boss? Do you think everyone is as brainless as you?”

“You…!”

“What you? Why don’t you go challenge Long Chen right now if you feel so confident!? Don’t worry, I can ask Long Chen not to kill you! Of course, you’ll need to have the guts to try it,” said Feng Fei, her tone so cold it could freeze the flame.

“You…” The budding Doyen was enraged, but he truly didn’t dare to challenge Long Chen. After all, he wasn’t tired of living yet.

He had only said that idiotic sentence because he was jealous. He didn’t want to admit that Long Chen was powerful.

Now, with a few words, Feng Fei completely exposed him. Fuming with anger, he could only shoot her a glare. If it weren’t for her having the support of the patriarch, he’d have long since taught her a lesson.

“That’s enough. Let it be, or others will laugh at us. However, Shaoyun, your words really are a bit naive. Don’t say things like that in the future, or others will look down on you,” commanded Jiang Wenyu.

Although Shaoyun had a good relationship with Jiang Wenyu, he often spoke without thinking. In the end, Jiang Wenyu also couldn’t save him from his foolishness.

The actions of the Dragonblood Legion had served as a stark warning, forcing Jiang Wenyu to abandon any notion of underestimating them. Feng Fei was correct—the strength of the soldiers was a reflection of the general. If the soldiers displayed such formidable might, it left no doubt that the general, Long Chen, had to be even more formidable.

Now, Jiang Wenyu knew why the first Heavenly Doyen in the nine heavens and ten lands would challenge Long Chen to a duel.

“It’s time. Why isn’t Netherdragon Tianzhao here yet?”

The set time had arrived, but Netherdragon Tianzhao had not shown himself.

“It couldn’t be that he doesn’t dare to come, right?”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Just then, a thunderous rumble rang out, and the void shattered, revealing an enormous figure in front of everyone. At the same time, a dense black qi filled the sky.
