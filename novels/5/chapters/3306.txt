Chapter 3295 Pursuit

Long Chen had fled, while the Devil Eye Water Lily was still crazily emitting that black qi, seemingly expelling the black soil’s energy from within it.

Based on Long Chen’s guess, the only reason the black soil had such an immense effect on it was because it had swallowed Long Chen into its core. That was where it was strongest, but it was also where it was weakest. 

Now, it was powerless to chase. As for the devil dragons, they refused to let Long Chen off. They covered the sun with their black wings as they chased.

“No need to worry. They won’t catch up,” said Long Chen, not at all worried.

That was because Bai Xiaole had always been in control of this black dragon. The other black dragons were already filled with holes as a result of the Devil Eye Water Lily. 

As expected, the black dragons were thrown further and further into the distance. Seeing this, Jiang Yuhe and the others almost wept with relief.

They were also ruthless characters born of blood and fire, but they had never come to such a terrifying place before. The feeling of gradually leaving the danger was relieving.

They flew past the dark forest and up ahead was the Vile Dragon Valley. The vile dragons simply knelt down, too scared to move in front of the black dragon.

“Should we go steal some more dragon eggs? It won’t take long. Just a few breaths’ time would be enough,” said Jiang Yuhe, a bit moved as she looked back and saw that the black dragons were thrown far into the distance.

If they were on their own, they wouldn’t dare to come back to Vile Dragon Valley. Hence, such an opportunity only came once in a lifetime.

Jiang Yuhe’s suggestion aroused the desire of the other three as well. Those black dragons behind them were injured and slow. Even if they had to waste a few seconds, it wouldn’t be fatal.

Long Chen shook his head. “Do you really think that we’ve escaped the danger? You should keep praying. Pray that we can get back to Zhaoming Ancient City. If that terrifying lily recovers, we’ll be dead.”

“Ah?” The four of them were dumbfounded. They had thought that everything was over. But now, their hearts clenched once more.

“Can that lily leave its territory?” asked Jiang Yuhe.

Long Chen looked outside and didn’t reply. Seeing this, Jiang Yuhe was embarrassed and didn’t keep asking questions. The four of them once more became apprehensive.

“Long Chen, just what kind of lifeform is that? How is it so terrifying? I’ve never heard of such a thing,” asked Bai Shishi.

Just a glance at the inside of the lily had almost caused her to lose her mind. She was very curious about it.

“It’s a lifeform that has continued down from the desolate era. It is a Devil Eye Water Lily from the Undying World. It is rumored to be a branch of a species from the primal chaos era. It is very well known. There is a saying that when its devil eye opens, all life must submit. Its devil eye can be considered a bit similar to Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils, but it is also not that similar. Its devil eye unleashes spiritual attacks and physical attacks. I myself almost died to it,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen hadn’t expected that its devil eye would also possess physical attacks. He had only risked it because he thought that his Spiritual Strength and will would be strong enough to resist its spiritual attacks.

The moment he was captured by it, if he hadn’t suddenly thought of unleashing the black soil within the primal chaos space, he would probably have died here.

“A species from the primal chaos era?!” Everyone was horrified. It had to be known that this was an era that the human race had almost no understanding of.

“If it’s so terrifying, why did you take this risk?” demanded Bai Shishi, her voice quivering a bit.

“Let’s not talk about it. I’m injured and need to adjust my condition. There might be another fight in a bit. Xiaole, make sure the devil dragon keeps flying at full speed,” said Long Chen. He closed his eyes and meditated.

In truth, he wasn’t injured, as any injuries had long since healed. He just didn’t want to keep discussing this matter. After all, there were outsiders amongst them.

Hearing that there might be another big battle coming up, their hearts clenched. The black dragon was flying extremely quickly. With Bai Xiaole urging it on, it was flying without a care for its own life. It was igniting its essence blood just to increase its speed.

An incense stick’s worth of time later, they passed through Vile Dragon Valley. The scenery in front of them grew familiar, and Jiang Yuhe and the others relaxed slightly. They would quickly reach Zhaoming Ancient City.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded. In the distance, space twisted and the giant Devil Eye Water Lily appeared, filling heaven and earth. It was right behind them.

“It has caught up!”

Everyone cried out in shock. The Devil Eye Water Lily was erupting with black qi, and it was so large that it blasted apart the clouds in the sky. After that, a terrifying pressure appeared and made it impossible for them to even breathe.

The Devil Eye Water Lily had expelled all the black soil. Furthermore, its pressure was even more terrifying than before. As soon as it appeared, it unleashed a huge shockwave that came crashing toward their black dragon.

“Cut off your connection to the dragon!” shouted Long Chen to Bai Xiaole.

BOOM!

The huge black dragon was directly blasted apart. In their flying boat, they were sent tumbling through a chaotic mass of ground meat. 

The flying boat smashed through the peak of a mountain and tumbled to the ground. It then fell apart as it bounced across the ground.

Long Chen was holding Bai Xiaole and Bai Shishi. He endured most of the impact for the two of them.

The two of them didn’t possess powerful physical bodies, especially Bai Xiaole. He might have been directly blasted apart from that impact.

As they came tumbling out of the broken boat, they were all wretched. Jiang Yuhe and the others coughed up blood, their bodies on the verge of collapse. Although they were Immortal Kings, their physical bodies weren’t any stronger than Qi Yu and the others.

“Xiaole, use your teleportation technique!” shouted Long Chen just as he stabilized himself.

Just then, the black qi condensed into a giant heavenly sword slashed toward Long Chen and the others. Fortunately, Bai Xiaole had activated his spatial art, and they all vanished. The sword landed only on the ground, creating a giant earth wave. But it didn’t affect Long Chen and the others.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

BOOM!

Suddenly, a lily pierced through the void. Long Chen and the others fell from the sky.

“It can track and break my transportation orbit!” shouted Bai Xiaole. His spatial art was actually interrupted.

Long Chen coughed up blood. When the spatial art was broken, it caused an immense spatial tearing force. However, in order to protect everyone, he endured that impact on his own. His body almost shattered.

It was simply because Bai Xiaole’s physical body was too weak. The slightest bit of that tearing power could have taken his life. So, Long Chen had no choice but to take it all in.

Seeing Long Chen in this state, Bai Shishi cried out. She had been curious why she wasn’t injured at all.

“Run toward the city!”

Long Chen shouted at the others, while he picked up his bone saber and charged at the Devi Eye Water Lily.
