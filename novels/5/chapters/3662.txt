Chapter 3651

When Ji Wuying’s figure vanished, Guo Ran suddenly shot into motion. His right hand then smashed into the void, causing a huge hole to appear in the void.

The moment the void was destroyed, Ji Wuying’s figure came tumbling out like a shooting star. He smashed into a building, blowing it apart.

“What?!” Everyone was startled by this sudden turn of events. It was so fast that they couldn’t even react.

Ji Wuying said that he wanted to kill Long Chen, but in truth, his target was Guo Ran. However, he hadn’t expected that even before his sneak attack landed, he would be sent flying by a punch from Guo Ran.

“Fuck, do you think that I’m a weakling? Your little bit of spatial energy is child’s play in front of me. Idiot, have a taste of your grandpa Guo Ran’s wrath!”

Guo Ran stamped on the air, shooting after Ji Wuying. But all of a sudden, Guo Ran’s body twisted. He actually switched direction and punched the void once more.

BOOM!

Cracks spread throughout the void. After that, Ji Wuying’s figure appeared from it, and he was blown back by Guo Ran once again.

Everyone was shocked. Ji Wuying’s movement art made him seem like a phantom, but Guo Ran was able to find his location like a prophet.

“How is he doing this?” Even Xia Chen was surprised.

When Xia Chen was hunted by Ji Wuying, he experienced just how terrifying Ji Wuying’s spatial energy was. There were countless times where he had almost died to Ji Wuying’s sword.

“Guo Ran’s Supreme Bone comes from an expert of the Alldevil race, and their Supreme Bones might have formed a resonance. Also, just in terms of the auras of their Supreme Bones, Guo Ran’s Supreme Bone far surpasses Ji Wuying’s. Most likely, Ji Wuying’s Supreme Bone is still in a state of slumber. Although his spatial energy is mysterious, he can only use it to move in a straight line, and he relies on supplementary movement arts to be nimble. But as soon as he does, Guo Ran can accurately sense where he is coming from,” said Long Chen.

Guo Ran repeatedly swung his arm, blocking Ji Wuying’s sharp blade just like that. Every clash unleashed a metallic ringing that shook people’s ears.

It had to be known that this bone from Alldevil Tianye was unbreakable. Even the Minghong Saber was unable to damage it, so it could be seen just how shockingly hard it was. Guo Ran directly blocked Ji Wuying’s attack with it.

Others were unaware that Guo Ran’s arm was a Supreme Bone; they were dumbfounded. Ji Wuying was wielding a World Domain divine item, but Guo Ran was capable of blocking it barehanded? Upon seeing this, their jaws dropped.

Guo Ran had only mobilized his right hand, and his left hand was still behind his back. He sneered. “If I used two hands, it would be bullying you. My left hand’s power is ten times greater than my right hand’s. If you can force me to use my left hand, I’ll count it as your victory.”

This fellow’s bragging was always unreliable. If he dared to stick out his left hand, it would instantly be cut off.

However, Guo Ran truly appeared unrivaled at this moment. With a single punch, even the Heavenly Daos quivered. No one dared to question his words.

Most importantly, in people’s hearts, true experts wouldn’t just brag. Regretfully, the one they encountered today was a shameless fellow.

When Guo Ran bragged that his left hand was even stronger, it resulted in quite a few people believing it.

“Bullshit!” Ji Wuying furiously cursed him. With just a few probing blows, he found that this seemingly weak fellow actually possessed a Supreme Bone.

He clearly remembered that last time, this fellow had sneak attacked him and relied entirely on his battle armor to fight. How did he suddenly become a Supreme expert today?

If Guo Ran were to say that he had been hiding his power, Ji Wuying wouldn’t believe it. If Guo Ran had used the Supreme Bone’s power in that sneak attack, he would have definitely seriously wounded Ji Wuying. The latter might not have been able to escape.

However, he would never have dreamt that this Supreme genius was actually made artificially. Guo Ran’s bragging shocked and infuriated him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

No matter what movement art Ji Wuying used, Guo Ran always found him. He was somehow able to accurately pinpoint Ji Wuying’s location.

Ji Wuying’s ephemeral spatial arts were dull in front of Guo Ran, and that infuriated him. As an assassin, he needed to rely on assassination arts to slay his opponents. It was the most profound, effortless way to kill someone.

This was an assassin’s creed and the standard practice for an assassin. They didn’t face their opponents directly. If they didn’t succeed in their sneak attack, they would distance themselves, vanishing until the opponent’s guard was lowered or another opening appeared to kill them in one blow.

When assassins killed people, they needed precise control over the environment, weather, skill, fluctuations of the human heart, and many other areas. They would only attack when they had an opportunity, and if they didn’t have that opportunity, they would create it.

Assassins needed absolute cool, but when Long Chen saw Ji Wuying furiously cursing, he was surprised. This was the Bloodkill Hall’s number one heavenly genius? He immediately started having suspicions.

He didn’t know much about Ji Wuying, but he did understand Enpuda. Would he really raise such an idiot disciple?

A huge explosion then caused the world to change color, and the entire formation quivered. This was a frontal clash of pure power without any tricks. As a result, powerful astral winds buffeted the Spirit Rune Pavilion.

Even with the formations protecting them, countless buildings seemed to be on the verge of crumbling. Because of it, the expressions of the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s experts changed.

“A direct clash already?” Long Chen frowned even harder.

Suddenly, a world appeared behind Ji Wuying. That world contained a giant hand that covered the heavens, and it reached out while emitting endless spatial energy. After that, sacred light descended from atop the nine heavens, illuminating Ji Wuying’s body. He seemed to have become the son of heaven and earth, the one blessed with all the world’s favor.

The next moment, the hand holding his sword became as white as jade, and Grand Dao runes appeared on top of it.

“Supreme Bone!”

Startled cries rang out. Ji Wuying was starting to utilize the Supreme Bone’s full power, so they finally sensed its aura. Even for the old monsters present, this was their first time seeing Supreme Bone.

The appearance of a Supreme Bone caused the world to change color and the ten thousand Daos to roar. It was a terrifying sight.

However, Guo Ran was delighted to see Ji Wuying do this. The most fearful aspect of Ji Wuying was his assassination arts. But after being beaten back several times, this fellow actually forgot about his status as an assassin, wanting to rely on brute force. That was basically helping Guo Ran.

Even so, Guo Ran kept his expression neutral. He still had one hand behind his back even as Ji Wuying’s power crazily soared.

“Keep working hard. Bring out your full power. As for myself, I still won’t use my left hand,” said Guo Ran calmly.

His arm quivered and explosive power burst out as if an ancient beast was awakening.

Suddenly, Ji Wuying and Guo Ran shouted at the same time. In front of countless horrified gazes, they smashed into each other like two shooting stars. Both of their powers erupted to their peaks. It was a simple and explosive clash.
