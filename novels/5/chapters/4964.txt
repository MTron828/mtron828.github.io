A saber containing the will to split the heavens descended mercilessly, slicing through the limitations of spacetime and rending the very fabric of the world. Long Ziwei found himself completely suppressed by this will, unable to move.

From the day Long Ziwei started cultivating, he had never experienced such a terrifying will that could suppress his body and soul. Even his thoughts froze.

BOOM!

The saber moved as swiftly as lightning, slicing past Long Ziwei’s cheek and leaving a deep cut in the earth. His hair was blown back, and the astral winds cut into his cheek, showing that Long Chen had intentionally missed his mark.

Long Ziwei realized the attack was so fast that he couldn’t even react. If Long Chen had truly intended to kill him, he wouldn’t have had a chance to defend himself.

“How was that?” asked Long Chen as he rested Evilmoon on his shoulder lazily.

Long Ziwei recovered from his shock and calmly replied, “Just that? I admit that it was the fastest attack I’ve seen. However, I would be able to withstand it with my Heavenly Fate Ring.”

“Senior apprentice-brother… look… behind you…”

Just then, the women’s shuddering voices rang out. Their eyes were still filled with fear.

Long Ziwei looked back and directly froze.

Long Chen’s saber had cut through the earth all the way to the devil sea, even severing the seawater. Now, it looked like two connecting waterfalls, and the phenomenon continued to the horizon.

For a saber to cut the earth wasn’t anything special. However, for it to cleave through the devil sea, creating a split that extended beyond sight, defied the normal laws. It represented a fundamental disruption of the natural order.

However, the most terrifying thing was that the cut in the earth between Long Chen and Long Ziwei was extremely thin. This led Long Ziwei to initially believe that Long Chen had focused solely on speed, sacrificing power.Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Now, Long Ziwei realized the true extent of Long Chen’s control. The saber’s power had been unleashed behind Long Ziwei, cutting apart the earth and the devil sea. Such precise control over immense power was truly frightening.

It also implied that this attack was not Long Chen’s full strength. If it were, he couldn't have maintained such precision.

Fang Liude and the others didn’t understand these points, but seeing Long Chen cut apart the devil sea left them utterly dumbfounded. This level of power pushed the boundaries of their imagination.

Just then, Evilmoon’s laughter rang out in Long Chen’s mind. “Hehe, how was that? Wasn’t that badass?”

“Isn’t this excessive?” Long Chen grumbled a bit. Long Chen had only wanted to scare Long Ziwei, but this attack had even startled himself.

He had merely activated the six forms in one and restrained it to the limit. However, Evilmoon had added something extra, causing the power of the attack to multiply.

“Tch, how is this excessive? Do you think I’m still the old Evilmoon? Did you think those Heaven Saints were killed for nothing last time? Now, I can finally control a bit of my power, and I don’t need to rely on you for everything. Hehe, how was it? Are you satisfied with it?” Evilmoon chortled happily, very pleased with itself.

“How many times can you unleash a blow of this magnitude?” asked Long Chen.

“At least ten times. Of course, I could also unleash my power all at once. Hehe, but it would be a bit hard to control,” answered Evilmoon.

Long Chen was pleasantly surprised to hear that it could unleash this level of power ten times in a row. If Long Chen unleashed it all at once, his power might be able to rival that of a Heaven Saint’s.

Suddenly, Long Ziwei tossed aside his broken saber, and in front of everyone’s shocked gazes, he knelt on the ground with his palms up, prostrating himself toward Long Chen.

“Big Brother, please accept your junior brother’s kowtow. From today onward, I will be your errand boy. I will walk through fire and water for you.”

“…?”

Long Chen was stunned by this sudden change. Just what was going on? If Long Ziwei couldn’t win, he could just accept defeat. Why was he acting like this?

“What are you doing? Is there a need to do this?” asked Long Chen.

Even Long Ziwei’s women were baffled. Was this really the prideful and unbending Long Ziwei they knew? The rank ten heavenly genius of the Long clan? Why did he kowtow to someone else as their little brother? Had the world gone mad?

“My respected big brother, to tell the truth, there are only two people within the entire Long clan whom I fully respect. One is you, and the other is your father, Saint Emperor Zhantian. When he first arrived in the Long clan, wielding a single sword, he slaughtered his way into the ranks of the four Heavenly Saints. The higher-ups were enraged, but they still didn’t dare to do anything to him. In our Long clan’s history, the only one who could enrage the entire Long clan while rendering them speechless would be him. I saw everything back then. The worship I feel for him could fill the entire devil sea…”

Even while prostrating himself, Long Ziwei gestured, and his speech became more impassioned. “With a single sword, he cut down the experts of the Long clan. When the number one Heavenly Saint wanted to fight him, the patriarch actually stopped them! What does that mean? It means that Long Zhantian possesses a power that rivals the first Heavenly Saint! The patriarch was worried about them killing each other. The first Heavenly Saint has not had to fight in countless years. After all, he started condensing his second heaven vein three thousand years ago. Although I don’t know if he succeeded, even if he didn’t, a single heaven vein is enough to make him unmatched amongst most Heaven Saints.”

Long Chen was surprised by this story. His gentle and refined father was so violent that he directly ran amok in the Long clan? Did he also take his position as one of the four Heavenly Saints through violence?

“When I witnessed that scene, I finally understood what it means to be an unmatched hero. I vowed to follow such an expert. Unfortunately, even though Saint Emperor Zhantian ascended to the ranks of the four Heavenly Saints, he had no intention of forming his own faction. He didn’t even care about his newfound authority. Instead, he merely altered a single law within the Heavenly Desolation Domain, granting even the lowliest of mercenaries a degree of freedom and rights. After securing some benefits for them, he didn’t linger in the Long clan for long before vanishing. I couldn’t follow him even if I wanted to. When I heard of your arrival in the Heavenly Desolation, I rushed to see you. I wanted to confirm if you were truly the real deal. Of course, I also harbored doubts about my inferiority to you, but now I am fully convinced. Big Brother Long Chen, please accept me as your little brother!”

As Long Ziwei spoke of Long Zhantian, his eyes brimmed with worship, reflecting the profound impact Long Zhantian had on him upon his arrival in the Long clan. It was evident that Long Zhantian had completely reshaped Long Ziwei’s worldview.

“Get up first. Tell me about the Long clan.”

Seeing how worshipful Long Ziwei was toward his father, Long Chen’s wariness toward Long Ziwei also dropped.

Long Ziwei was delighted and immediately rose, explaining everything he knew about Long Zhantian’s situation.
