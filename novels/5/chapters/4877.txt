Chapter 4866 Divine Sunflower Propagation Heavenly Pill

Long Chen nodded. “If it really is as you say, then I have a solution.”

“What solution? Can you tell me?” asked Xing Wujiang, his voice quivering with emotion.

Xing Wujiang was not afraid of dying. However, there was one matter that pained and even scared him—having no descendants.

As the last member of the Xing family’s main bloodline, if he were to die with no heirs, it would make him a sinner to the Xing family. Even if he were to sacrifice himself to stop the devil from reviving, he wouldn’t have the face to meet his ancestors.

That was why he couldn’t suppress his excitement when he heard that Long Chen had a solution.

Long Chen said, “Big Brother’s Blood Qi is still vigorous, and there are no problems with your essence. If you cannot have a child, it must be due to being cursed.”

“Cursed?”

Mo Nian and Xing Wujiang were both startled. Mo Nian inquired, “Brother, have you misjudged? I’ve dealt with curses for many years. Why can’t I sense any curse from Big Brother’s body?”

Long Chen shook his head as he explained, “This kind of curse is different from the ones you deal with. You are directly cursed, but Big Brother isn’t. The Square Heaven Seal is the Xing family’s legacy divine item, correct? During its forging, the Xing ancestors definitely carved some runes to prevent it from devouring its master, so the Square Heaven Seal cannot directly curse Big Brother Wujiang. In that case, the one cursing him must be the devil head. The devil head placed the curse on the Square Heaven Seal, or perhaps it should be said that the Square Heaven Seal let itself be cursed. Big Brother Wujiang, as the one in control of the Square Heaven Seal, you are affected the most. But my guess is that the other controllers of the Square Heaven Seal are also affected, just not as bad as you.”

“Yes, you’re right!” exclaimed Xing Wujiang, slapping his leg. The other four noble families were just like the Xing family. Although their branch bloodlines didn’t seem too affected, their main bloodline’s reproductive rate had dropped.

The best example was Cao Shaoqing. By his generation, the main bloodline was down to seven people, while major families like them would normally have thousands of children per generation.

This was also why Cao Shaoqing was an idiot, not knowing how to fight back against Long Chen despite his immense talent. Due to the lack of successors, their elders didn’t let those of the main bloodline take any risks. This was also why Cao Guofeng was so enraged when Long Chen killed his grandson.

Furthermore, this curse was also affecting the Violet Palace Sect, Yellow Spring Pavilion, and Heaven Heart Hall. However, they all thought it was related to the cultivation technique they trained in, never suspecting the Square Heaven Seal.

Xing Wujiang had not fully believed Long Chen’s words at first, but now he was confident in them. Long Chen’s words were too accurate.

“This Square Heaven Seal is quite vicious!” exclaimed Mo Nian.

“It’s normal. If you think about it, if you were always under someone’s control and gained nothing from it, would you endure it?” asked Long Chen.

“I suppose... The way you view things is always novel.” Mo Nian shrugged.

“Are you saying that I must sever my connection with the Square Heaven Seal?” asked Xing Wujiang, his expression suddenly darkening.

If he did so, the other four noble families would be unable to control it, and the Square Heaven Seal would instantly be freed.

Long Chen shook his head. “That would indeed free you from this curse. But why would I suggest such a stupid idea?”

Xing Wujiang sighed with relief. Long Chen then continued, “Before entering the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, I obtained a divine medicine called the Great Sun Sunflower...”

Hearing this, Mo Nian and Xing Wujiang were both shocked. They were familiar with the legend of the Great Sun Sunflower, and Xing Wujiang was instantly filled with joy.

After so many years without an heir, Xing Wujiang had scoured the whole world for this legendary divine medicine. However, the Great Sun Sunflower had gone extinct in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, and even Brahma Pill Valley didn’t possess it.

Xing Wujiang had invested considerable resources and effort into searching for various medicines to aid him, all to no avail. They hadn’t even found the shadow of the Great Sun Sunflower. So, for Long Chen to mention it now, Xing Wujiang was beyond delighted.

It was a legendary divine medicine. Initially, Long Chen hadn't regarded it as particularly miraculous, assuming that the most potent divine medicines would grow in the highest realms. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, after arriving in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, Long Chen found that some divine medicines simply didn’t exist in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Due to it lacking the laws of the other eight heavens, it lacked the necessary energy to grow some plants. It was then that Long Chen realized the uniqueness of the Great Sun Sunflower he had encountered in this realm.

Long Chen took out an elegant case and handed it to Xing Wujiang. “Big Brother Wujiang, this is the Divine Sunflower Propagation Heavenly Pill I refined. You can try one...”

“Brother, I cannot thank you enough!” exclaimed Xing Wujiang. Before Long Chen could even finish speaking, Xing Wujiang already took the pill and bolted out. “Excuse me!”

With that, Xing Wujiang abruptly departed, leaving Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanging a speechless glance.

Mo Nian couldn’t help but say, “Isn’t he a bit too impatient?”

“Maybe it’s because we haven’t reached that age, or maybe it’s particularly precious when you lose something and then regain it,” replied Long Chen as he shrugged.

“Hehe, in any case, helping Big Brother Wujiang is helping ourselves. This time, I’m going to show off all my abilities!” declared Mo Nian heroically.

“You won’t fail a second time, will you?” asked Long Chen solemnly. After all, Mo Nian’s injuries last time had been absolutely terrifying.

“How could I? I won’t make the same mistake twice. Well, since there’s no one else here, I’m going to explain the layout. Heaven Screen Mountain has two treasure lands, but I only had time to see one. Due to time constraints, I must head straight to the devil corpse and arrow. So, you have to go to the other treasure land. I’ll draw you a map. It’s not too detailed, but you can consult it...” Mo Nian started drawing as he explained certain things to Long Chen.

“Damn, this is too complicated. I’m not going to remember it all. Why don’t I just wait for you to finish and then we go there together?” Long Chen hadn’t expected the place that Mo Nian wanted him to go to be a giant tomb. He had no experience in this regard, nor did he like searching for treasures this way. With his bad luck, rather than finding any treasures, he’d end up in a death trap.

Mo Nian said, “I’m worried about us not having enough time. For Big Brother Wujiang’s sake, I have to make a beeline for the devil corpse. That will take a long time. If you want, you can just look around and grab whatever treasures you see. In any case, other people will be present inside as well. If you can’t find any treasures, you can always take them from others. When I’m done, I’ll come to find you.”

“What if I help you with your corpse?” asked Long Chen.

“Hey, what are you implying?” demanded Mo Nian.

“Whoops. I meant that I could put away your corpse for you. Hmm, that doesn’t sound right either. But you get it,” replied Long Chen with a helpless tone.

Mo Nian shook his head. “No need. Heaven Screen Mountain is filled with treasures as it was an ancient battlefield. Who knows what lies buried within? If you accompany me and I end up being the only one to benefit from the treasures, wouldn’t that be awkward? I could share them with you, but that might bother me. On the other hand, if I don’t share them, it could cause more headaches.”

“Fine, we’ll do as you say,” Long Chen replied, feeling too weary to argue further. If Mo Nian was so confident, he could go alone.

With their plan settled, the two of them left the city lord manor. As soon as they did so, they were greeted by the Feather Spirit race’s four Protector Elders, a sight that both moved and slightly embarrassed them. They followed the elders back to the Feather Spirit race’s territory to rest.

Three days later, Xing Wujiang came over to the territory of the Feather Spirit race. As soon as he saw Mo Nian and Long Chen, he couldn’t hold back his excitement and shouted, “It’s done!”
