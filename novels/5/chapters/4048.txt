Chapter 4037 What if You Add Me?

“Long Chen, get back! Dongfang Zichu is mine!”

Yu Xiaoyun roared, about to grab Long Chen. He could tell that Long Chen had just fought an exhausting battle. He might not have seen how Long Chen had killed Liao Bencang, but he knew that doing so had to have come at an immense price. If Long Chen were to fight Dongfang Zichu in this state, he would probably be killed in just a few moves. After all, Yu Xiaoyun was well aware of just how terrifying Dongfang Zichu was.

Yu Xiaoyun had never liked Long Chen. One reason was that he disliked Long Chen’s character. But the other reason was that based on their calculations, Yu Qingxuan’s Nether Emperor seal would soon erupt. They were hoping to accompany her for her final moments.

That was why amongst all the princes and princesses, Yu Qingxuan alone had free reign to stay in the imperial palace at all times. Yu Xiaoyun and Jiang Huixin only hoped to spend a bit more time with her in her final days.

For Long Chen to come at this time to take Yu Qingxuan, it revealed that a father’s love was selfish and a mother’s love was giving.

Yu Xiaoyun didn’t want anyone to take Yu Qingxuan from him. But Jiang Huixin was of the opposite opinion. Even if that meant that they wouldn’t have much time together as a family, she still hoped for her daughter to experience true love.

But now, things had progressed to this point. Because of his feelings for Yu Qingxuan, Long Chen was willing to risk his life for her family’s empire. Furthermore, even in front of the likes of Dongfang Zichu, Enpuda, Weng Taibei, and countless powerful experts, Long Chen still didn’t retreat. His unyielding determination and the killing intent he exuded served as undeniable proof of his deep affection for Yu Qingxuan.

Thus, when Long Chen wanted to fight Dongfang Zichu, Yu Xiaoyun immediately stepped forward. At this moment, he had clearly accepted Long Chen as his son-in-law.

“You are all too naive. You don’t even realize that you are tortoises caught in a jar. Yu Xiaoyun, we once called each other brother. So, I’d advise you not to struggle. Struggling will only bring you more pain.” Dongfang Zichu suddenly flicked his finger, and flames shot toward the Yan Xu Gate.

As a result, the Yan Xu Gate quivered and countless black runes lit up on it.

“AH!” When those black runes lit up, Yu Qingxuan turned as pale as paper, her body quivering. Somehow, her flame energy rapidly flowed out of her, and even her core flame wanted to leave her body.

“Summon the Vermilion Bird Heaven Screening Barrier!”

As Yu Xiaoyun roared, the imperial city’s grand formation covered them, and a giant Vermilion Bird soared into the air above the capital, enveloping the entire capital with sacred aura.

However, the black runes on the Yan Xu Gate spread like tentacles, pressing on the barrier. The two sides began to clash.

What shocked Yu Xiaoyun and the others was that the barrier was slowly caving in. It seemed that it could not stop the invasion of those black flames.

“It is useless. These flames are connected to the Yan Xu World. They possess the specific laws of the Yan Xu World, so they cannot be absorbed or stopped. You can only accept it,” said Dongfang Zichu indifferently.

All of a sudden, Yu Xiaoyun formed some mystical hand seals, causing the Vermilion Bird’s divine seal to light up on his forehead. As he channeled his inner power, a surge of blood-red flames erupted from his body, infusing the barrier with even greater strength and intensity.

“Imperial father, don’t!” When Yu Qingxuan saw this, she couldn’t help crying out. Yu Xiaoyun was actually igniting his essence blood.

When Jiang Huixin, Xu Lanxin, and the other senior experts saw this, they also followed his lead. Then Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Yifeng, Yu Qianxue, the other princes and princesses, and all the people of the imperial family began to ignite their essence blood to support the barrier.

With everyone’s support, the Vermilion Bird barrier lit up with divine light, forcing back those black tentacles that had been about to reach Yu Qingxuan.

“No! Don’t do this for me…!” Yu Qingxuan was sobbing. So many people were burning their essence blood for her, causing her to feel moved but also terrible.

“Qingxuan, your father and mother have let you down. We trusted the wrong person and couldn’t see you grow up. But don’t worry, even if we have to throw our lives away, we will protect you.” Yu Xiaoyun looked back at her with love.

“Dad…”

Perhaps in this world, calling a father ‘dad’ was the most common thing. But it was Yu Xiaoyun’s first time hearing it. Compared to imperial father, he preferred it better, so a gratified smile appeared on his face.

Just as the Yan Xu Gate’s runes lit up and Long Chen was wondering if he should attack the Yan Xu Gate or Dongfang Zichu first, Huo Linger said something to him. He was disappointed to find that the Yan Xu Flame here was not a true flame but was closer to a law, so she could not absorb it.

With everyone igniting their essence blood, Yu Qingxuan was temporarily protected. Long Chen then took a deep breath and stopped hesitating. With a single step, his saber came out of its sheath and attacked Dongfang Zichu.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, Long Chen was blown back wretchedly, coughing up blood.

“Despicable!” Yu Xiaoyun thundered with indignation. Just as Long Chen attacked, Dongfang Zichu, Enpuda, Weng Taibei, and dozens of other experts converged on him at the same time. Thus, Long Chen had essentially fought all of them at once.

So many three-flower experts joined forces against a single Immortal King at once. That was practically the pinnacle of shamelessness.

“A man of character fights with wits, not power. In this world, it is the victor who is respected. As for shamelessness, it means nothing in front of victory. So what if we are despicable? So what if we are shameless? A group of dead people can’t say anything,” sneered Dongfang Zichu.

When it came to using everyone’s power to attack Long Chen, he didn’t seem the slightest bit ashamed. Instead, he simply put on a contemptuous expression.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Long Chen, don’t fight them! Return to the barrier. We have the protection of the immemorial heroic spirit here. At least temporarily, they cannot touch us. Don’t be brash!” shouted Yu Xiaoyun.

Even the always brash Yu Xiaoyun could see that Dongfang Zichu and Enpuda’s trap was meticulously planned, with every step leading to the next. They simply used the Yan Xu Gate to deal with all of them, while they dealt with Long Chen.

If Long Chen and the others allowed things to go according to their rhythm, they would have no chance to retaliate. So, they had to think of a way to break free of the trap first.

Long Chen felt his Blood Qi churn violently within him, still reeling from the impact of the last blow. At this moment, his fury and killing intent were out of control. He knew just how terrifying of a schemer Enpuda was, so thinking of a way out was meaningless at this time. He realized that brute force was his only option.

Long Chen wiped some blood off the corner of his mouth and took a deep breath. With no time for probing blows and no exploitable weaknesses to capitalize on, Long Chen realized that what he needed was now absolute sheer power.

After slowly sheathing the Minghong Saber, in an instant, the world lost all sound. Within this deathly silence, horrifying killing intent began to condense.

Everyone could tell that Long Chen was accumulating power. His next attack would be thunderous, a truly suicidal attack where life and death hung by a single thread.

Seeing this scene, the silent Enpuda smiled and finally spoke. “Do you feel like you can deal with all of us on your own?”

“Then what if you add me?”

Just then, an icy voice rang out, and a dainty figure slowly appeared within a twisted space.

“There’s also us!”

In the distance, space collapsed and a group of figures appeared with overwhelming battle intent, their sharp blades unsheathed.
