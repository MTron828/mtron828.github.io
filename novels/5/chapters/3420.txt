Chapter 3409 Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill

There were countless people within the Auspicious Cloud Trading Company. It was like Long Chen had entered an ant’s nest. Even in this gigantic palace, they were squeezed together.

Although everyone was intentionally being quiet, the number of people made a huge racket inside the palace. It sounded like the entire palace was rumbling.

There were three levels. The first level had the most people, the second floor had a few, and the third floor had the fewest.

Lei Yuner directly brought Long Chen to the third floor, and Ying Bokong obediently followed behind them. On the third floor, someone checked their identity plates. Without a certain status, a person was not qualified to enter the third level.

The likes of Long Chen and Ying Bokong were actually not qualified to enter the third level, so they only benefited from Lei Yuner’s status.

This floor was simply a straight path with all kinds of extravagant goods displayed on the sides. These were all treasures.

“How about I buy you a weapon?”

Lei Yuner knew that Long Chen didn’t have a weapon, so she pulled him over to one of the display counters. This was a giant display that took up almost half of the path. There were all kinds of weapons on it, all King items. There were war chariots, flying boats, and other large tools as well.

However, when Long Chen saw the prices, he shook his head. Even the cheapest was thousands of immortal king crystals. The more expensive ones were over ten thousand. Although these King items were of excellent quality, he still felt that the price was excessive.

He was the dean of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch academy. The main academy had sent over several King items to be placed in the branch academy’s storage to be exchanged for points.

Although they required points as a price, Long Chen did have a general understanding of a King item’s price. Thus, he was able to tell that the prices of these King items were slightly high.

“What kind of weapon do you like? I’ll buy it for you. You must pick one! I have over thirty thousand immortal king crystals here,” said Lei Yuner. Although Long Chen couldn’t have children with her, she wanted to lock him in first for now. It was like accepting her gift would make him her person.

“Don’t you need the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill? Why don’t we first go to take a look at the medicinal pills?” said Long Chen. He felt that the King items were too expensive and he didn’t want to get ripped off. It didn’t matter whose money he was spending, the feeling of being ripped off wasn’t a good one.

“Alright, I need to buy a thousand Lightning Spirit Blood Pills as a foundation for advancing to Divine Lord. I’ll see how much I have left after buying them to see what I can buy for you,” said Lei Yuner with a bright smile.

That smile vanished when she saw the medicinal pill counter. She saw that the price of the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill was thirty immortal king crystals for just one.

“Damn, this is a huge rip-off! Why not just steal from people directly?!” Long Chen almost started to curse people for the price of this pill.

The Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill was a medicinal pill for demonic beasts, specifically for lightning attribute demonic beasts to increase their blood soul power. The pill formula was a secret, and the main ingredient was the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass. It was a very rare ingredient.

However, no matter how rare it was, it was still possible to buy it. What they were selling was simply a tier four high grade medicinal pill. Even for a top grade pill, demanding a price of one immortal king crystal was already extremely expensive.

For the Sacred Pill Hall to dare to demand thirty immortal king crystals for one pill was an utter rip-off of the highest degree. It was no wonder that this place didn’t have the Huayun Trading Company. If the Huayun Trading Company came with their prices, this place would have to instantly close down.

“What’s going on? Wasn’t it sixteen immortal king crystals for one Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill? Why has the price inflated so much suddenly?!” raged Lei Yuner.

The one in charge of attending them was a cold-faced elder. He had a violet pill furnace embroidered on his chest. It was unknown what status that meant in the Sacred Pill Hall.

The elder indifferently said, “You said it yourself, that was the price before the Divine Lord Immortal Realm opened. Three years ago, our Sacred Pill Hall’s medicinal field met a natural disaster in the Odd Peak Domain, resulting in the majority of the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass dying. The surviving grass was affected by the waves of the Heavenly Daos from the natural disaster, which was a major hindrance in refining the pill. Because of it, the odds of the pill forming dropped to less than a third of the normal rate. It can be said that thirty immortal king crystals is already an excellent price we only offer due to our conscience.”

“What nonsense! The Odd Peak Domain is right beside our territory! How come we never heard of any natural disaster?!” raged Lei Yuner. She knew that region and had not heard of anything happening there. She felt that this elder was lying to her.

The elder’s expression sank. He coldly said, “Do the matters of our Sacred Pill Hall need to be reported to your demonic beast race? I told you, the natural disaster resulted in the price increasing. Buy it or not, it doesn’t matter. If you’re not buying, scram.”

Long Chen shook his head. This fellow probably just spouted out a random lie, only for the place that he mentioned to actually be near Lei Yuner’s home. Now that he was exposed, he immediately turned hostile.

Clearly, this elder didn’t know Lei Yuner’s origins, or he wouldn’t have said something that got him instantly exposed. But even if he was exposed, he refused to admit it.

“Who are you telling to scram?! Do you think the name of the Sacred Pill Hall allows you to bully my Lightning Falcon race?!” Killing intent erupted out of Lei Yuner. She was shaking with fury.

Hearing that she was from the Lightning Falcon race, the elder’s expression instantly changed. But he forcibly remained calm and said, “So what if you’re from the Lightning Falcon race? What I’m saying is a fact. But due to my age, I might have misremembered where the medicinal field was. Do you dare to do anything to this old man due to this matter?”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You… shameless!” Lei Yuner clenched her teeth furiously. This person was far too shameless. He was clearly the one ripping others off, but if he said that he had misremembered, there was nothing she could do.

“I’ve been courteous enough to you. I’d ask you to take note of your words. You should know whose word counts in this star-field. Furthermore, the price of the pill was decided by the higher-ups. Even if the price goes up, it doesn’t enter this old man’s pocket. Why make things hard on me?” said the elder coldly.

The elder’s words were tough yet also not directly opposing her. His meaning was that since he didn’t set the price, it wasn’t him that went against her. They could both take a step back and let this matter rest. Continuing to fight over it wouldn’t benefit anyone. After all, in the entire Integral Heaven Star-Field, only the Sacred Pill Hall sold medicinal pills.

Lei Yuner was ashen with rage, but she was helpless. No matter what price the Sacred Pill Hall set, people still had to buy their pills.

Long Chen shook his head. This was the result of a monopoly on the market. They could increase the price just by saying it, and there was nothing you could do. Compared to the Huayun Trading Company, this Sacred Pill Hall was trash.

“Oh, the princess of the great Lightning Falcon race actually has such an ugly expression? Could it be that the Lightning Falcon race has declined and can no longer afford to buy those medicinal pills?” A treacherous voice rang out.
