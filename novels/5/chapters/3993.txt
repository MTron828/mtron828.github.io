Chapter 3982 Taking Advantage of Weakness

The banquet hall was located in a side palace. But although it was just a side palace, it was still extravagant and glorious.

A line of beautiful imperial attendants was in charge of receiving guests and bringing them to their seats. Long Chen saw many figures wearing different kinds of robes at the gate.

“There are this many foreign diplomats today?! Heavenly Ruler Seal, Violet Lightning, Eastern Brilliance, Feather Cry… These are all enemy nations! All of them have been hostile toward us lately!” Yu Qianxue’s expression changed when she saw all these people.

Long Chen had heard of the Heavenly Ruler Seal and Violet Lightning Empires, but not the rest.

According to the empire’s customs, it was the diplomatic emissaries that were first let in. In other words, the guests were seated before the host.

Yu Qianxue then counted. There were eight diplomatic emissaries from unfriendly nations, so this banquet was not going to be fun.

When the time came, Long Chen spotted the crown prince, Zhu Yunwen, as well. The latter merely glanced coldly at Long Chen for a moment before turning away. He didn’t say anything, but Long Chen saw the hint of fear he concealed.

Clearly, the matter of him possessing five hundred and thirty-seven dragon power had reached Zhu Yunwen’s ears. As a result, none of the princes dared to underestimate Long Chen any longer.

It was unknown if it was because of Long Chen, but quite a few imperial disciples somehow chose to strike up a conversation with Yu Qianxue at this time. Although they weren’t qualified to actually enter the banquet hall, they did have seats just outside the hall.

When it came time for the princes and princesses to enter, Long Chen followed Yu Qianxue inside. To his surprise, Yu Xiaoyun, the empresses, and a few imperial concubines had arrived in advance.

When Long Chen entered, Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin smiled and nodded slightly at him. It could count as a greeting.

“Long Chen…!”

Long Chen had just walked in when a furious voice rang out. Thus, Long Chen looked over to the source of the voice and exclaimed, “Wow, the benefactor of my wealth? You already gave me the Wild Blade and the lightning tower in the three thousand worlds. Brother, what gift have you brought me this time?”

This person was precisely the Violet Thunderclap Empire’s Weng Tianyao. His lightning tower and Wild Blade were taken by Lei Linger, which was his life’s greatest humiliation. Thus, for Long Chen to immediately bring it up caused his expression to twist with fury.

“Hey, what’s with that look? This is a state banquet, so take note of your decorum! Just look at your face, it’s as wrinkled as the crotch of some pants. What? Are you constipated?” Long Chen directly threw more oil on the fire when he saw Weng Tianyao’s furious expression.

Weng Tianyao was about to explode in fury when an elder beside him stopped him. “Yao-er, don’t be rude.”

This elder was lean, and his face was covered in black spots, looking ordinary. However, there was lightning in his eyes when they opened and closed, and there seemed to be countless stars in the depths of his pupils.

As for the spots on his face, they were not ordinary spots from old age but countless runes that had condensed into spots. Although they looked dark and gloomy, they possessed immense power.

This was definitely a terrifying expert. Just from Weng Tianyao’s respectful appearance, it was clear that this elder’s status was not ordinary.

However, Long Chen didn’t care about his status because he already spotted Yu Qingxuan in the distance.

The banquet hall’s tables were all rectangular and around four feet in width, arranged to accommodate two individuals per table. At the very front of it was the table for the emperor and the imperial concubines, and next to them would be the tables for the princes and princesses.

As for Yu Qingxuan’s position, it was close to the concubines. Furthermore, she wasn’t together with the princes and princesses. For her to be seated with the imperial consorts, her position was clearly higher than the others of her generation.

Also, within this entire hall, there were only two tables set up for a single person. One was the emperor Yu Xiaoyun, while the other was for a stiff white-haired elder.

This elder possessed a sturdy and robust physique, contrasting with his razor-sharp tongue. However, his overall appearance was peculiar and bordering on comical, leaving a distinct impression on those who saw him.

When Long Chen saw Yu Qingxuan, his eyes brightened, and without a word, he started walking toward her.

“Hey, Long Chen, your seat is here!” Seeing Long Chen walk directly toward Yu Qingxuan, Yu Qianxue jumped, pale with fright. She tried to grab Long Chen but missed, thus, she began to sweat. Did this fellow really think that this was his home? He didn’t care about any rules!

“Excuse me, big sister, may I be so bold as to ask your beautiful and kind self if we could switch seats?” Long Chen smiled at the woman seated beside Yu Qingxuan.

This woman was also a princess and was here to accompany Yu Qingxuan. Seeing Long Chen walk over and ask such a thing, she was stunned, feeling so lost that she didn’t know what to say.

It had to be known that this was a state banquet, so the seats had been set up long in advance. With the seating arrangement made with the finest attention to detail, how could they just randomly switch seats? Furthermore, it was done right in front of the emperor. Was he crazy?

Yu Xiaoyun stared at Long Chen darkly, but he didn’t say anything. As for Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin, they exchanged a glance and shook their heads inside. This child’s head really wasn’t normal. Could he not see what situation he was in?

“I…” The woman looked at the emperor and then the two empresses. After that, she stood up. Seeing them not stop her, under Long Chen’s repeated thanks and gratitude, she switched seats with him and walked over to Yu Qianxue’s side.

“Hehe, success.” Seeing Yu Qingxuan’s red face, not knowing if it was from embarrassment or panic, Long Chen stuck out two fingers as an expression of victory.

“To wear casual dress and act so frivolously during an important event, it’s clear that the Vermilion Bird Empire’s dignity has been ruined by people like you,” said that stiff elder suddenly.

In front of the emperor, others didn’t dare to open their mouths. But this elder made such a blunt appraisal right in front of him, his gaze full of disdain.

“Old fellow, let me tell you, I am no longer the old me. It would be best if you didn’t speak to me, or don’t blame me for not giving you face,” warned Long Chen.

“Long Chen, he’s Philosopher Sun…” warned Yu Qingxuan hastily.

“He can call himself whatever he wants, it doesn’t matter to me. What law have I broken for wanting to sit with my wife?” Long Chen stuck his neck out at that elder.

“While you may not have violated any specific laws, your actions have shattered all notions of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor. Having disturbed the order of the ruler and his subjects, it just shows that you don’t understand how to respect your seniors, and you have no sense of honor or shame. What face do you have to even sit here and talk?” said the elder expressionlessly.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The elder’s words were sharp and merciless. He directly criticized Long Chen’s actions in front of the emperor, clearly intent on driving him out of here.

As for everyone else, the majority of the diplomatic emissaries, princes, and princesses all felt great anticipation of this, hoping for Philosopher Sun to teach a lesson to this little fellow who didn’t know how high the heavens were.

“You wish to take advantage of my weakness? I gave you too much face, didn’t I? You want to play? You shameless old fellow, I’ll play with you!” Long Chen sneered at the elder.

Seeing Long Chen dare to curse the Philosopher, everyone was stunned. But when they glanced at the emperor, they saw that he was expressionless, as if nothing was happening in front of him. It seemed that he had no intention of interfering.

“What… what is going on?”
