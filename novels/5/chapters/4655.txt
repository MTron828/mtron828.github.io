Chapter 4644 Born as Ants

“Stop fighting! He’s not playing anymore!” the Earth Cauldron shouted at Long Chen. This Sovereign clan expert was now shamelessly using power beyond the World King realm.

However, Long Chen didn’t reply and simply continued to charge toward the core. As a result, in just a few moves, the exchanges broke his bones and sent him flying once again.

Long Chen was covered in blood, his wounds horrifying. Seeing that, the Dragonblood warriors gritted their fists, but Long Chen repeatedly charged back to the Sovereign clan expert.

Seeing him fighting like this, every Dragonblood warrior was provoked as well. If their boss was fighting this hard, how could they slack off? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Work harder! I want to see what’s happening inside!” Guo Ran became extremely curious upon seeing Long Chen’s condition.

However, due to the magma currents being too wild in the core region, he was unable to get close.

Right now, Guo Ran had already merged with the hidden dragon’s dragon soul. The latter had helped him condense his triple-layer armor and then really went into hiding. It actually started to ignore Guo Ran.

It actually quit its job halfway through. Guo Ran was enraged and could only figure out the rest of his path himself.

However, the majority of his power had been concentrated into his triple-layer armor by the hidden dragon, leaving him only a small amount to play around with.

The hidden dragon seemed to feel like it had done its work and didn’t care about the rest. Now, Guo Ran was caught in a difficult spot. He would need to derive his Dragon Soul Body Forging Art to figure out where to use this last bit of energy.

However, his head was far too muddled at present to do so. As he had no idea where to even start, he could only furiously curse the hidden dragon’s dragon soul but received no reply.

Suddenly, Guo Ran said, “If you keep ignoring me, I’ll have my boss erase your dragon soul and start anew!”

No one knew if the hidden dragon’s will was awoken by Guo Ran, or if Long Chen’s name scared it. In any case, Guo Ran now instantly sensed the hidden dragon’s will.

When its will merged with his, Guo Ran instantly felt full of power. He directly understood that controlling the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art would require its cooperation.

However, this hidden dragon was even lazier than he was. He would probably have a headache in the future, but he had no time to worry about it. Unable to distribute his remaining energy, he relied on the hidden dragon’s power. When his scales lit up, he charged forward with brute force.

With the hidden dragon’s will merging with him, Guo Ran let out a shout. His armor radiated with boundless power as he charged straight through the terrifying currents with unwavering determination.

The feeling of being full of power made Guo Ran feel like he had been reborn. It was as if he were a bird soaring through the sky or a dragon diving through the sea. Immersed in the euphoria of this newfound strength, he pressed on.

BOOM!

Guo Ran charged through the magma and arrived at the core. After that, he saw the ancestral scale floating in the sky and sensed its power that could destroy heaven and earth. He also saw Long Chen fighting the expert of the Sovereign clan.

“Boss, don’t panic, Guo Ran is here!”

Filled with confidence, Guo Ran charged into their battle.

“I swept through the four seas-!”

BOOM!

Long Chen was then struck by a dragon tail and sent flying, coughing up blood.

At this exact moment, Guo Ran reached the Sovereign clan’s expert. When the Sovereign clan expert’s electric gaze locked onto Guo Ran, Guo Ran went stiff. His armor instantly vanished.

“You bastard, where are you running?! Kill him!” exclaimed Guo Ran, stunned. At this critical juncture, the hidden dragon’s will actually fled.

“What did you say just now? You swept through the four seas? Someone like you?” The Sovereign clan expert stared at Guo Ran coldly, his expression odd.

“I... I... aiya!”

Countless thoughts buzzed through his head in an instant. He was thinking about explaining when his body suddenly shrank. Without the support of the hidden dragon’s dragon soul, he couldn’t maintain the new Dragon Blood Battle Armor. Unable to stay in the air, he plummeted into the magma.

Once he was inside, he was horrified to find that the magma here was terrifyingly dense, its powerful currents almost tearing him apart.

Just then, Long Chen grabbed his opponent and threw him out of the magma, sending him flying back to the outer region.

Long Chen’s hair was a mess, and he was covered in blood and horrifying wounds. Even with the primal chaos space’s life energy, recovering these wounds would take a certain amount of time. To make things worse, the Sovereign clan expert’s attacks contained a destructive law that hindered their recovery.

“How foolish. A human achieving the Dao and actually trying to elevate a bunch of chickens and dogs with him. Your race really is laughable.” The Sovereign clan expert clasped his hands behind his back, gazing at Long Chen coldly like a king looking at a peasant.

“What do you know?! Your dragon race has always been a high and aloof existence at the top of the ten thousand races, but my race never had your natural advantages. Our human race was the one that climbed from the bottom of the food chain to the peak of the world! What did we rely on? On not admitting defeat, on not accepting fate! A chicken is fine, a dog is whatever, but in the end, fate is not set in stone. No one can stay as a king forever. If we are born to live as ants, we will still fight to fly like swans. If fate treats us unfavorably, we will defy fate. When my brothers stand at the peak of the immortal world and soar over the land, you will realize just how foolish your words today are,” said Long Chen, his words like a divine drum shaking this world.

The Dragonblood warriors heard his words, and their blood boiled with renewed determination. In the mortal world, they had been nothing more than ordinary individuals. Their aptitude, talent, and background were all unremarkable, being easily overlooked by others.

However, after following Long Chen, they defied their fate one step at a time, going from the mortal world all the way to the immortal world. They now stood shoulder to shoulder with the top heavenly geniuses of the world, a feat they wouldn't have dared to dream of in the past.

Fate was not set in stone. What truly mattered was the determination and courage to challenge the heavens. In the end, those people who had looked down on the Dragonblood Legion would be annihilated or treated as insignificant passersby.

Long Chen's words instilled boundless confidence in them all, especially in the face of this formidable expert. His unwavering belief in defying fate and reshaping destiny served as the greatest encouragement for the Dragonblood warriors.

“Charge!”

Gu Yang roared, his will merging with a wild power as he charged toward the core region like a madman, with only one thought in mind: to fight alongside his boss.

A powerful dragon cry echoed as Gu Yang surged forward, golden dragon runes appearing over his body.

“He has also merged with a dragon soul’s will!” Guo Ran’s jaw dropped in amazement.
