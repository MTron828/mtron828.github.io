Chapter 2446 Huo Long Awakens

Translator: BornToBe

The Star Field Divine World was a place that the divine families had stood guard over a long time. No one believed that they didn’t have a map of it. But the divine families did not share that map with the other powers.

Now, the main problem wasn’t that the divine families had a map, but that the Corrupt path and the ancient family alliance’s experts had strategically and accurately attacked the people of the Martial Heaven Alliance. There was definitely some kind of scheme present.

“Fuck, it’s definitely the divine families that gave them a map!” cursed one of the Dragonblood warriors. Considering Long Chen’s enmity with the Ye family, it was most likely them.

If that was the case, and the Ye family had given their enemies a map, why had the Long family not given Long Chen one as well?

“It’s too early to say that, nor is it the time to deliberate.” Long Chen took out several pieces of soul jade and passed them to the Dragonblood warriors leading their groups. “This is the map that I obtained. It’s the most complete map possible, but we still can’t be sure of what exactly is going on in many regions because we haven’t gone there personally. Based on the spots we came from, it does seem like a coincidence that the Corrupt path and the ancient family alliance’s disciples intersected with us. Take a look.”

Long Chen summoned an image of the map in the air. He had managed to look through quite a few soul fragments in the previous slaughter, and so he knew the path that the Corrupt path and ancient family alliance’s disciples had been traveling.

“They were going in a straight line, while we were randomly roving around and just so happened to run into them. That is why they chose to attack us.” Long Chen drew two paths on the map.

“Boss, you mean that they had a target?” asked one squad leader.

Long Chen nodded. “Look. We were wandering around searching for our own opportunities, but they were going in a straight line. According to their path, they were going toward…” Long Chen extrapolated their path, ending up in a certain spot.

“It’s there?”

Based on the map, that was a giant lake. It looked like a long and narrow eye. When he had first seen the lake, he had been quite shocked because it was truly just like an eye.

At the center of the eye was some kind of energy, but at that time, he had only managed to get a brief glimpse from the Life Spirit God.

“Then are we going there?”

“This was their target. The divine families definitely gave them some special treatment, so you should go take a look as well,” said Long Chen.

“What about you?”

“I’m going to look around in some other areas. I’ll also be looking for the other groups,” said Long Chen. As long as each group had the power to protect themselves, it would be better for them to split up so that they could have more lucky encounters.

“Alright then. We’re going to move out.” The Dragonblood warriors brought their groups over to that area. There were now two thousand Dragonblood warriors present. They were much more confident in their force.

Long Chen looked at the compass and saw four tiny spots of light indicating the groups that had just left.

He then looked in the other direction. There was another place with two light spots, indicating that two groups had joined together.

Searching further, he found a solitary light spot. He rushed over in that direction.

As he flew through the air, his body suddenly shuddered. Flames began to rage within the primal chaos space.

Huo Long had finally awoken after devouring the Heavenly Flame Orb. The intense flame energy made Long Chen jump. It seemed that Huo Long was unable to perfectly control its power that had suddenly soared. It looked like the entire forest inside the primal chaos space would be incinerated.

Long Chen hastily pulled Huo Long out of the primal chaos space. As a result, Huo Long let out a heaven-shaking roar. It was like a volcano exploding, with wild flames filling the surrounding space.

Anything touched by it, trees, stone, earth, was instantly incinerated.

A giant hole was left in the ground, and Long Chen even saw red liquid flowing at the bottom. That wasn’t lava but a mineral deposit that had been melted by Huo Long’s power. Even Long Chen was shocked.

After devouring the Heavenly Flame Orb, Huo Long had reached a level of power that even frightened Long Chen. Its power had undergone a qualitative change.

As Huo Long roared, Long Chen realized that this roar was one that contained pain. Startled, he tried to sense what was going on.

Huo Long’s body suddenly began to rapidly inflate. It grew larger and larger, and its aura was climbing so ferociously as if it was a cultivator that was breaking through a bottleneck.

BOOM! Huo Long’s body exploded.

“Huo Long!” Long Chen let out a startled cry. Had the advancement been a failure?”

“Big brother Long Chen, I’m fine…”

A young voice rang out from within the flames, dumbfounding Long Chen.

In the center of the explosion, countless flame runes were burning. As they burned, Long Chen sensed their power growing purer.

Those runes looked like colored glass. All their impurities were being burned away. Those runes slowly gathered, condensing into the form of a young lady. At first, the form was very indistinct, but as more of the runes condensed, her appearance grew clearer until she appeared to be a pretty maiden of about fifteen to sixteen years old.

She had long hair that reached her waist, and a fiery dress. Her eyes were like two rubies. After that, her delicate mouth curved into a beautiful smile, and she suddenly spread her arms and hugged Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen, I’ve finished my metamorphosis!” This girl with flames surrounding her excitedly cried out.

“Flames condensing a spirit? Heavens, this has to be the legendary divine flame spirit that automatically takes human form.”

Long Chen was shocked and delighted to see this. Within his Pill Sovereign memories, there were recollections of flames with spirits that were born from heaven and earth and could transform.

However, those transformations were always in the form of various beasts. As humans were the most spiritual of all lifeforms, flames were unable to condense into human form, unless that flame had a divine attribute.

For Huo Long to have transformed into human form indicated that it possessed the quality of a divine flame.

“Big brother Long Chen, are you happy?” asked the girl excitedly.

“I’m happy, of course I’m very happy,” said Long Chen, also excitedly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Having transformed, Huo Long now had more human feelings, and its intelligence had grown once more. That Heavenly Flame Orb was truly a priceless treasure.

“As a spirit of flames, I’ll call you Huo Linger then,” said Long Chen, giving Huo Long a new name in this form.

“Hehe, thank you, big brother Long Chen.” Huo Linger excitedly hugged Long Chen’s neck with a pure smile.

Suddenly, a pill furnace flew out. Ling-er was seated on top of the Demon Moon Furnace, giggling. “Little girl, let’s be good friends!”

Ling-er was unable to wait now that Huo Linger had awoken. Her immense flame energy filled her with anticipation. If they worked together to refine pills, it was unknown just how much stronger their pills would be.

“You’re small too. Why are you calling me little girl?” asked Huo Linger. Ling-er’s body was also like that of a girl.

“Who is small? Look again?” Ling-er’s body transformed, becoming an elegant, fully grown woman. Furthermore, everything about her had matured. Long Chen was dazzled.

“Look closely, who’s small?” Ling-er intentionally stuck out her chest proudly, along with an alluring voice that was not how she usually spoke.

“Ling-er, don’t mess around. Don’t corrupt this girl,” said Long Chen. He knew that this was most likely one of her past masters. That master had been extremely bewitching. Every look, every word could seduce a person.

“Hehe, don’t men like this kind of woman?” asked Ling-er, lightly nibbling on a finger.

“Ling-er!” Long Chen’s expression sank.

Only then did Ling-er return to her original form. To Huo Linger, she said, “In any case, I’m bigger than you. I’m Ling-er and you’re Huo Linger. You have three characters in your name, but I only have two, so I’m definitely bigger. So you have to listen to me.”

Huo Linger was confused by this logic, but she nodded obediently.

“Hehe, good. Let’s go refine some pills.” Ling-er opened the Demon Moon Furnace, bringing Huo Linger inside.

“Huo Linger can’t refine pills with you yet. She needs to help me refine something first,” said Long Chen.

“Can’t I help you with that? I don’t eat the pills afterward, so what’s the difference?” asked Ling-er.

“This is different. This pill isn’t something that you can refine.” Long Chen waved his hand, summoning the Moon and Star Refining Furnace.
