Chapter 3917 Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens, Ten Thousand Spirit Burial

This slap landed solidly on Kun Tu’s face, smashing his protective golden runes apart.

Kun Tu was then sent flying, smashing into the ground. As a result, a bottomless ditch appeared and continued beyond the horizon.

“So that’s the case. There has to be a rotation during the slap. This twist of the wrist causes the speed and power to rise greatly. Haha, I’ve learned it.” Mo Nian was watching intently. He understood Long Chen far too well and had long since been waiting for this attack, so he saw it clearly. Now, he was sure that he could master this technique.

“You know nothing about true power? Hahaha, that’s correct! Keep going! Beat him, beat them all! These feathered animals don’t know how high the heavens are!” exclaimed the dragon expert excitedly.

Its level of excitement was as though it was the one who had just slapped Kun Tu. Furthermore, Long Chen’s words were incredibly arrogant, incredibly domineering, but they were to the dragon expert’s liking. It seemed that when it came to showing off, the human race had an immense advantage over any other races. Even the dragon expert knew that he was incapable of such a thing.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Long Chen, hand over your life!”

Long Chen had just slapped away Kun Tu when black qi filled the sky, and violent devil qi crashed down upon everyone. Shi Yang had finally finished the Corpse Devil Sacrifice after breaking Yue Xiaoqian’s seal.

At this moment, countless runes were flowing on top of his body as he exuded an immemorial air. It was as if he was truly a devil god that had walked out of the immemorial era.

“I have finished the Corpse Devil Sacrifice. It is time to settle all accounts.” Shi Yang’s wings quivered. With the slightest pressure from his claw, it felt like the world was going to be crushed. His power had transcended everyone’s understanding.

“Settle all accounts? What are you going to use to settle those accounts? This corpse? Even if you’ve activated the runes, its body has already stiffened. You can’t unleash even a tenth of its power. Are you sure that you haven’t grown tired of living?” sneered Long Chen.

“Even if it’s just a tenth, it’s enough to kill you,” responded Shi Yang. He then attacked with his claw confidently.

“Is that so?” Long Chen unleashed a simple punch.

BOOM!

To their surprise, Long Chen wasn’t shaken in the slightest, but Shi Yang’s body was trembling. Both friend and foe were shocked by this spectacle. Shi Yang had sacrificed countless experts of the devil race for this overwhelming power, but he was unable to shake Long Chen at all.

Suddenly, Shi Yang’s wings swept through the air like lightning, slashing toward Long Chen’s neck with incomparable speed.

However, Long Chen ignored this attack. He simply raised his foot and unleashed a stamp at Shi Yang’s armpit, causing black blood to rain down.

Just like that, Shi Yang was sent flying with a miserable shriek. His arm was forcibly ripped out by Long Chen.

“Everyone, don’t hold back! Kill him now, and perhaps we can force out his dragon blood. Once he has fully refined it, there won’t be such a chance again!” shouted Ji Wuming. Forming hand seals, Enpuda’s figure appeared within his manifestation. This was no divine statue but Enpuda himself.

When Enpuda appeared, Ji Wuming’s faith energy instantly ignited, healing his wounds and returning his listless aura to his peak.

The Nine Underworld Luocha and Yin Changsheng also joined the fray after summoning their gods behind them. They had been holding back their strongest trump card this entire time.

Now everyone realized that these people were all crafty. Despite looking enraged to the point of losing their minds, they had actually been holding back a bit to compete for Long Chen’s dragon blood once he was slain.

However, as a result of scheming against each other, they ended up letting Long Chen finish absorbing the dragon blood. If they hadn’t been toying around like this, the Dragonblood Legion would not have been able to hold them back. Then Long Chen wouldn’t have had a chance to absorb the dragon scale.

Long Chen’s power had now exceeded all expectations. If they still thought about holding back, they would definitely be beaten by Long Chen. Then let alone obtaining the dragon blood, they might not even be able to protect their own lives.

While Ji Wuming, Yin Changsheng, and the Nine Underworld Luocha unleashed overwhelming faith energy, Long Aotian, Kun Tu, and the one-armed Shi Yang came flying back as well.

As for that crafty beast cultivator, he actually shot toward Meng Qi. With his lead, Weng Tianyao and some other powerful lifeforms also charged over with him.

They all knew that Meng Qi and the others had exhausted their power to protect Long Chen. So, killing them now would be simple and would distract Long Chen.

Countless experts were attacking, but some were growing restless in the distance, akin to vultures waiting for their chance to get a bite. Looking at such filth, Long Chen’s eyes instantly turned ice-cold.

“This is because you forced me, so don’t blame me.”

Long Chen turned to the Violet Eye Nine Tail Demon Fox that Bai Xiaole was sitting on. “I know that you have your trump cards. Can you protect my friends?”

Looking at Long Chen, it very clearly spat out two words: “Don’t worry.”

Its nine giant tails suddenly rose, each with different runes on it. They were like nine heavenly pillars that covered everyone.

Before people understood what was going on, Long Chen raised his arms, and an enormous dragon appeared within his manifestation. The next moment, the sacred might of the dragon radiated, blasting away the clouds. It was possible to see the stars in the sky shaking as if they were going to fall at any moment.

Long Chen’s manifestation was enormous, but even it was unable to contain this golden dragon. Through the manifestation, people could only see its scales. Not even its dragon claws could be contained.

They had never seen such an enormous lifeform before. It was like the manifestation was merely a window letting them see part of the dragon, causing people to fear it even more.

“Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens, Ten Thousand Spirit Burial!”

Long Chen’s voice shook the stars in the sky. It was as if every star in the sky was echoing his voice, which was akin to the imperial edict of a heavenly god. Not even the Heavenly Daos dared to defy him.

Following that, Long Chen raised his head and unleashed a brilliant roar that pierced through the Heavenly Daos, past the nine heavens. The stars then shook, alternating between going dark and blazing with light.

BOOM!

Following that roar, the ten thousand Daos collapsed and the earth vanished. A ripple of death then spread in every direction.

Long Aotian, Kun Tu, Yin Changsheng, Ji Wuming, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Shi Yang, Weng Tianyao, the beast cultivator, and all the others were blown away.

As for the others, when this ripple of death struck them, they instantly turned to dust, their souls wiped out of existence. Seeing this scene, the experts in the distance instantly turned and fled for their lives.

Regretfully, they weren’t fast enough. This death wave covered the entire battlefield. In an instant, this battlefield that was originally filled with countless experts emptied.
