Chapter 2945 Terrifying Archer

Long Chen was startled. He hadn’t expected this old ghost to be so vicious. The latter had actually unleashed such terrifying power.

In his fury, the elder had opened over seven hundred sluice gates. That essentially stopped all the other divine flame spirit pools, concentrating all their energy here.

Long Chen felt the sensation of death. Before he could even react, his star diagram appeared behind him, absorbing all this energy.

He had transformed over twenty thousand of his stars, but now the rate of transformation suddenly soared.

“Thirty thousand… forty thousand… fifty thousand…”

This world source energy was something that no one could endure. However, Long Chen’s astral energy could be considered to be from the same source. It then crazily consumed this energy, wrapping around Long Chen.

This vast energy rapidly transformed his stars, but at this moment, an ear-piercing alarm rang out. Clearly, that elder also knew that such a thing would occur and had hastily fled.

BOOM!

At this moment, the entire room shuddered, and the world source energy began to fade. The gushing water also slowly stopped.

“They’ve finally come. Hehe, but it’s fine. I’m done.”

Long Chen then quickly put away his star diagram and looked inside of his Dantian. All his stars had transformed. Long Chen truly didn’t have a way to properly express his gratitude toward that elder.

It had to be known that this energy was exceedingly precious. Just by himself, he had used up who knew how much.

If it weren’t for that elder trying to harm him, there would have been no way for him to obtain so much energy. Even if he became a Heaven Master, the academy wouldn’t spend so much on him. Hence, Long Chen had truly profited.

The door blew open. Several elders charged in, only to see Long Chen putting on his clothes.

“You… you… you’re still alive?!”

“I suppose. If I’m dead, then that would mean that you’re also dead. If you feel that you’re alive, then I should also be alive,” said Long Chen, smiling at these elders in a good mood.

These elders oversaw this place. When the alarm rang out, they found that all the sluice gates had been opened and were charging into one pool. Hence, they had immediately run over.

They had originally thought that whoever was inside would have long since lost their life, so they didn’t expect to see someone who was still alive and well. They were dumbfounded. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After a long pause, one of them finally asked, “What happened here?”

“You’re asking me? Shouldn’t I be asking you? Why did the water suddenly gush toward me? I almost drowned. Fortunately, I’m a good swimmer. Well, I’m done, so you can do your investigation. Maybe there’s a problem with the formation?” Long Chen walked out just like that.

As he left, he saw many people standing within the passageway. Those men and women were all confused. They had been in the process of their own tempering when the water suddenly vanished.

When Long Chen left, he didn’t see the person who had brought him in. That elder had probably dragged him away.

That elder was very crafty. By bringing that person away, he had covered himself with a protective talisman. Long Chen’s guess was that that person was probably already dead.

Under the excuse of committing a grave crime and killing himself in shame, they would have the perfect cover-up. A dead person couldn’t testify. Since the elder had dared to personally move against him, he had to be confident that he could wipe away all the evidence.

If Long Chen said something, it would be meaningless. He hadn’t been able to see outside, and just the voice alone was not enough to punish the elder.

Hence, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to waste any further thought on it. However, this attempt at his life did raise some alarm bells in his mind. He definitely couldn’t take these fellows lightly. They were capable of coming out of any hole at any moment.

Long Chen took a transportation formation back to his immortal cave. He was midway down the mountain when he suddenly sensed something and dodged to the right.

An arrow flew right by his ribs. The air around it spun, and it pierced into a boulder.

“Silent arrows!” Long Chen was shocked. Guo Ran had used such arrows before, and they had killed many experts. Guo Ran had even used them to kill experts that were stronger than himself.

After avoiding the first arrow, one after another shot out silently. Hence, Long Chen dodged left and right, and the arrows pierced into the mountain with large explosions.

“How fast…”

Long Chen relied entirely on his sense of danger to dodge these silent arrows and only narrowly managed to avoid them all. He didn’t even have a chance to find where the attacker was.

Long Chen could only repeatedly dodge as there was nowhere for him to hide. His assailant had clearly chosen this place to attack him.

His Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was extremely sensitive to any danger, including sudden sneak attacks. But it wasn’t a sure thing. Some experts had specialized assassination methods that concealed themselves from all senses. Some people would even use a self-hypnotizing skill to make themselves forget that they were about to assassinate their target. Only when their target set foot in their trap would that hypnotism fade. There were other similar methods to avoid being sensed.

The opponent was a terrifying archer whose attacks couldn’t be sensed. Furthermore, these arrows curved toward their target. This kind of arrow was the most frightening as it often tricked a person’s instincts, making them think that they had dodged only for the arrow to suddenly curve toward them.

Long Chen was infuriated. He was actually treated like a rabbit caught in the open, a live target for his opponent. Furthermore, his attacker was actually extremely far away, and he couldn’t reach them. He could only repeatedly dodge.

After dodging dozens of arrows, Long Chen finally arrived in front of the entrance to an immortal cave. He then smashed a fist into the door, blasting it open. After that, he charged in, finally escaping.

However, when he entered, he saw a man and woman looking at him in horror. Long Chen was also shocked. It seemed that he had interrupted something romantic.

The woman cried out, grabbed her clothes, and ran deeper inside. As for the man, he was about to angrily speak when Long Chen kicked him.

Another arrow passed right by that man’s cheek. If it weren’t for Long Chen’s kick, his head would have been pierced. He was so frightened that he knelt on the ground, not daring to move.

More arrows flew into the room, but they were now just random shots, and Long Chen didn’t even need to dodge. Long Chen then spread his Spiritual Strength outside.

As a result, his divine sense only grasped a weak spatial fluctuation before nothing else could be sensed. His opponent had come prepared.

“Big brother, many thanks.” The man stared in shock at Long Chen and thanked him.

“Brother, sorry for delaying your good thing. I’ll make it up to you if I have a chance.” Long Chen rushed out.

He quickly found a footprint on a mountain peak. This was a very secluded area.

“Even if you run, so what? Even if you mess up your aura, your spiritual fluctuations won’t immediately fade. I’ve remembered you.”

Long Chen’s expression was dark. This was his first time being used as a living target, and he didn’t even manage to find the shadow of his attacker. Flames of fury ignited within his heart.
