Chapter 4542 Fatal

The void twisted, revealing Long Chen and Feng You. Right now, Long Chen was covered in blood, but it was mostly Feng You’s.

Feng You had fallen unconscious again after blocking those arrows. Luckily, Long Chen had grasped that brief opening to carry out a spatial transportation and escape.

Having escaped that wasteland, they were now above a lake. There was mist curling around the surface of the lake, limiting their sight.

Long Chen immediately went still after arriving here. The surface of the water was frighteningly calm, so calm that there was very likely some terrifying existence down below. If he were to make any rash movements, he could draw out some monster.

If he were alone, he naturally wouldn’t be afraid. However, he had to carry an injured woman, so he had to be cautious.

Sitting in midair, Long Chen held Feng You as she lay on him, her face contorted with pain.

Long Chen knew that her condition was due to absorbing too many of those inheritance runes. They posed a heavy burden both to her body and soul.

After thinking about it, Long Chen searched through his stock of medicinal pills and picked out his gentlest healing pill.

As Feng You wasn’t human, Long Chen was worried about her body’s reaction to medicinal pills, so he didn’t dare to pick out just any random one.

Luckily, after he fed her this pill, her pale face quickly regained some color, and her condition stabilized, showing no signs of rejection. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Long Chen observed for a while before he fed her another pill. Soon after, her aura started to rapidly recover, and her Blood Qi fluctuations strengthened as well.

“Since she has never consumed any pills before, they’re many times more effective on her,” sighed Long Chen.

Constant consumption of medicinal pills could lead to the development of a powerful resistance, reducing the effectiveness of the pills. However, since Feng You had never consumed any pills before, there was no resistance to speak of, and the effects were remarkable. Long Chen observed as her breathing relaxed, and she gradually fell into a deep slumber. Her recovery rate was nothing short of astonishing.

Feng You slept in Long Chen’s embrace, her hair resembling strands of golden silk. Despite her sharp features exuding a heroic aura, they did not diminish her beauty.

Holding this sleeping beauty, Long Chen couldn’t help but feel his heartbeat quicken. After all, the curves of her body possessed a fatal attraction that would captivate any man.

Long Chen closed his eyes and took a deep breath, controlling his emotions and preventing any of those thoughts from appearing in his mind. In fact, the best way he found to calm himself down was to think of Ying Tian’s ugly face.

As soon as Long Chen thought of Ying Tian, he calmed down. Ying Tian was absolutely terrifying. Even now, Long Chen had not managed to find out his true depth.

With unfathomable power and the cunning of a fox, Ying Tian would flee at the first sign of danger. For Long Chen, an opponent with great strength wasn’t the most daunting existence; it was someone who wielded both great power and patience that truly instilled fear in him.

Suddenly, Feng You quivered and her body heated up. Following that, one rune after another appeared from beneath her skin and ignited, unleashing flames all around her.

“Damnit!”

Long Chen knew that the runes within her just started to awaken, igniting her core flame.

During normal times, it would not have been an issue. However, in her slumber, Feng You was unable to control the flames. Though they wouldn’t harm her, there was no way for her to protect her clothes.

“This really is fatal!” Long Chen exclaimed as Feng You’s clothes quickly incinerated, fluttering away in the wind like butterflies. Her pale skin was fully exposed, along with areas that were normally concealed.

Long Chen felt his head buzz instantly, his blood rushing to his head. He felt a nosebleed coming on.

“Fatal, absolutely fatal!” Long Chen cursed. In an instant, the image of intimacy with Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue appeared in his mind.

After tasting that flair, he knew he wouldn’t be able to forget it. In truth, there were several occasions when he couldn’t resist the temptation while he was with his women, but they all fled in embarrassment. They had agreed to wait until they were all together and married to him before sharing a room with Long Chen; otherwise, it would be unfair to the others.

Thus, up until now, even though he had many wives-to-be, the only ones to have done it with him were Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue.

Normally, he would suppress his desires and wouldn’t even dare to think about the two of them, because they would dredge up his most primitive desire.

However, it was super awkward now. He was holding a large, naked beauty, and he felt like his heart would leap out of his chest.

“Ying Tian, Ying Tian, Ying Tian... Come... Big brother likes you... ugh.” As Long Chen forced himself to think about Ying Tian instead... he almost vomited. However, he instantly felt much better.

If Ying Tian knew that someone was thinking about him—the number one assassin of the Heavenly Province, an existence that caused countless experts to quiver in fear—to disgust themselves, he would perhaps lose his mind.

With time, more and more runes appeared on Feng You, and the flames grew so intense that Long Chen had to summon his own flames to protect himself. If his own clothes were burned away, then his dry firewood would ignite again.

“Alright, I’ll give her some firepower.”

Long Chen took out another pill. However, as he didn’t even dare to look at her or use his divine sense, he blindly fed her. Fortunately, he didn’t feed the wrong spot.

This pill was a Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill. When Feng You consumed it, her aura erupted, projecting a terrifying pillar of flames into the sky.

As a result of this eruption, a sea of flames appeared over the lake, and a huge vortex formed in the water. At the same time, a frightening aura rose from below, indicating that there was something beneath the surface of the water.

Suddenly, the surface of the lake rose, revealing an enormous head emerging from the water. It was an enormous python, and Long Chen jumped in shock at the sight.

The python’s head was triangular, with two sides raised high, and its eyes were pitch-black. Long Chen couldn’t help but shiver when he saw it.

“A poison python.” Long Chen had seen many pythons in his life, but it was his first time seeing one of these. It was the most terrifying existence among pythons.

Holding Feng You, he directly flew away using his Kunpeng wings. Although the python was a Saint-level creature, its threat level to Long Chen was comparable to that of a Sage King.

As Long Chen made his move, the python opened its mouth, and a black mist instantly spewed out, causing the surrounding space to collapse. Long Chen and Feng You then found themselves enveloped in the black mist.

“Crap!” Long Chen exclaimed in alarm. He realized that the mist contained spatial laws. Just as he was about to act, a gentle hand reached out and grabbed him.

“Don’t worry. Leave it to me.”
