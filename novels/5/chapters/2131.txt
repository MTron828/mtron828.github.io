Chapter 2121 Unable to Give the Killing Blow

The old man was truly worthy of being someone from the senior generation. His sharp vision instantly noticed that the Mechanism Sect’s patriarch’s condition was off. He was bedeviled. His aura was chaotic, and even his Samsara power was messy.

That was why the old man hadn’t interfered this entire time. He had been watching to see how Long Chen handled him.

At this moment, the Mechanism Sect’s patriarch had chains gathering around him, divine energy flowing into his body. He was actually absorbing the underground divine elixir.

That was the root of the Mechanism Sect’s karmic luck. Once it was sucked dry, the Mechanism Sect would decline. They would run into constant misfortune and be very quickly destroyed.

Even if he just absorbed a portion of it, it would affect the Mechanism Sect’s karmic luck. They would be fated to run into trouble. With the great era going on, that was very dangerous.

The patriarch had been in the midst of attempting to break the barrier to the next level and had been in a critical juncture. He had long since sent out word that he could not be disturbed for anything.

The day that he went into seclusion was before the gathering of past and present heroes. So he didn’t even know what had happened.

As for the later attack on the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, that had been decided by the higher-ups and Zhao Wuji. They were essentially blindly following Zhao Wuji.

When Long Chen had stabbed Evilmoon into Zhao Wuji’s body, he had planted the spiritual imprint that Xia Chen had provided into Zhao Wuji’s body.

Even if Zhao Wuji had noticed it, he would have simply assumed it was some kind of hidden injury. It would take him a few days to wipe it away entirely. Xia Chen had used that spiritual imprint to find the entrance to the Mechanism Sect’s minor world.

Long Chen had immediately unleashed a powerful attack that broke the core of the Mechanism Sect’s formations upon entering. Just as their experts thought that they could bring him down with their numbers advantage, Long Chen had unleashed his World Extermination Flame Lotus. They hadn’t been willing to disturb their patriarch at the start, so Long Chen’s hadn’t stood on courtesy. He had disturbed him on his own.

The patriarch was startled awake in the middle of his meditation. A heart-devil had immediately invaded his Dao-heart, causing him to become bedeviled.

His soul was currently fighting his heart-devil, and he still had no idea what was happening in the outside world. In his current state, he had no intelligence. He was running entirely on instinct.

The majority of his power was focusing on resisting his heart-devil, so he had instinctively absorbed the energy of the sect’s divine elixir to power himself.

As the divine elixir flowed into his body, his armor began to transform. Two horns grew out of his head, and long thorns appeared on his back. He looked like an Earth Dragon crossed with a human.

“Kill, just kill them all! Since even the God Killing Armor has been activated, just kill all of them! In any case, the Mechanism Sect is no more!” Zhao Wuji roared crazily, his face twisted.

He knew that all the divine elixir underground had already been sucked dry by the patriarch. In other words, there would no longer be a Mechanism Sect in this world.

They could only close down and rebuild a new sect. Furthermore, this sect could not be called the Mechanism Sect, or the curse of karmic luck would make sure none of them had good deaths.

“Old man, I probably can’t keep going.” Long Chen felt a chill upon looking at the current state of the patriarch.

Having now taken this monstrous state, the patriarch was emitting a terrifying divine pressure that formed a restrictive domain. Even without being in this domain, a sensation of death filled Long Chen’s heart. He didn’t know what technique this crazed fellow had used, but that armor of his was horrifying.

At this moment, the patriarch’s armor quivered. A ray of divine light shot out of his forehead, shooting at Long Chen like a sword.

In that instant, time froze. Long Chen felt the flow of time around him change. By the time he wanted to dodge, it was too late.

The old man appeared in front of him, grabbing his arm and dragging him out of that strange spacetime.

A light sound rang out. The sword-light passed right by Long Chen’s body. A thin black crack appeared from the heavens to the earth. Ripples began to spread from the crack.

“The patriarch has destroyed the walls of this world! It’s going to collapse!” The Mechanism Sect’s disciples cried out in fear, trying to flee.

However, before they could reach the exit, a sharp attack slaughtered them.

“You only want to leave now? When my boss first arrived, he told you to run, but you didn’t. It’s too late to think about running now!”

Gu Yang, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others now appeared, blocking the exit.

“I’m begging you, let us go! We don’t even understand what’s going on! Please, we have children here!” Amongst the crowd, a woman holding a baby cried out.

The core of the Mechanism Sect was where the disciples gathered. The outer edges were where the wives and children were.

The core region had been destroyed, but the outer regions were still intact. Countless crying families were trying to run out, but the exit was blocked by the Dragonblood Legion. Seeing the crack in space slowly growing, they despaired.

“We...” Gu Yang didn’t know how to reply. Originally, they had planned on pulling this vile Mechanism Sect out by its roots, not leaving even a chicken or dog alive. But seeing these people...

“Open a path. Let them through.” Long Chen’s voice resounded through the air.

“But boss, if they leave...” Xia Chen was concerned.

“What? Is our Dragonblood Legion afraid of others looking for vengeance? We’re not as garbage as the Mechanism Sect. Are you really willing to kill these women and children?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“No. Fine, open a path.” Gu Yang shook his head with a bitter smile. He waved his hand.

Seeing that, those people rushed over. Some of the Mechanism Sect’s disciples also charged out, trying to slip in among the crowd.

Immediately, some of the Dragonblood warriors picked them off, slaying them. Gu Yang sneered, “Since boss says that he wants to give you a chance, we’ll give you that chance to live. But with the minor world in danger of collapsing, the women and children leave first, got it? If certain people try to slip in amongst them, don’t blame us for being merciless. If you want to get out earlier, then help send up the women and children. Furthermore, aren’t you all men? To survive, are you competing over spots with your women and children? Bah, I really look down on you lot.”

Those experts of the Mechanism Sect were unbearably ashamed. This minor world was being torn apart, and it no longer possessed the ability to heal. Its collapse was only a matter of time. The patriarch had gone crazy and absorbed the divine elixir. As a result, the Mechanism Sect would vanish from this world, and they could only run.

However, with the Dragonblood Legion in their way, rushing wouldn’t matter. They could only help to organize the families.

“Guo Ran, time is pressing. Let’s go strip the treasure houses,” said Xia Chen, flying out.

“You know where they are?” asked Guo Ran delightedly, following him.

“What a joke, what do you think we came for? If I couldn’t confirm the location of the treasure houses, why would boss bother making such a big move?” laughed Xia Chen.

As soon as he had entered, he had studied the structure and layout of this minor world. He was sure where the treasure houses were and had already passed that information to Long Chen to avoid having them destroyed.

“Zhao Wuji, what do you think you’re doing? Are you worried about your treasure houses? Worry about yourself first.”

Zhao Wuji had heard Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s conversation, and seeing which direction they went, his expression changed. He was about to make a move when Gu Yang attacked him with his spear.

Zhao Wuji blocked with his sickle blades, but he hadn’t had time to get a new set of armor. He was still wearing his old set, and it had been specialized for blowing up Long Chen. Now, it was only giving him a fraction of the support a good set of armor should, causing his combat power to sharply drop. He was forced back over and over by Gu Yang.

“Li Qi, Mingyuan, just hold the lines. I want to fight him myself!” shouted Gu Yang, stopping Li Qi and Song Mingyang from joining in.

Suddenly, the world shuddered. Li Qi and the others hastily looked toward the battlefield.

Another giant crack had appeared in the sky. That black crack was the black of death.

“Old man, kill him!” shouted Long Chen.

The old man had ignored Long Chen after pulling him out of danger. As a result, the second attack from the patriarch only narrowly missed Long Chen after he did his best to dodge. The sword-light blew right by his nose, causing a burning sensation that made him tear up.

“He’s gone crazy. Killing him would be unfair. His attacks possess Samsara energy, a power that can confine even the laws of the Heavenly Daos. If he was in his normal state, you’d have long since been killed. But since he’s gone crazy, his techniques are wild. This is a good chance for you to temper yourself. Having a chance to exchange blows with a fourth step Netherpassage expert is precious. Perhaps you can see a bit of the secret behind the Samsara realm. Even if you can’t, accumulating some experience is good too,” said the old man righteously.

Long Chen suddenly ducked hard. A blood-colored streak of sword-light flew right over him, and a mass of his hair was torn out.

“Damnit, that’s ridiculous!” shouted Long Chen.

He was stuck within the patriarch’s domain. He didn’t know what law this was, but time seemed to be flowing slow around him, causing his movements to be sluggish. His reaction speed was slowed down.

Long Chen suddenly jumped, even pulling up his legs. Another streak of sword-light shot past his feet.

Another crack appeared in space. The world rumbled intensely as its collapse was sped up. A giant black hole appeared in the middle of the cracks, looking like a gaping maw.

“Bastards, how did my Mechanism Sect turn into this state?!”

Suddenly, the patriarch’s body shuddered. A trace of clarity appeared in his scarlet eyes.

When he finally took in the desolation of the Mechanism Sect, he let out a heaven-shaking roar.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
