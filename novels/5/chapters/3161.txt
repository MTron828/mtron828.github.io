Chapter 3150 Long Chen’s Greatest Power

A withered fist that almost looked comical smashed toward Long Chen. Despite its frail appearance, it possessed the power of law. The world seemed to become illusory just because of it.

Long Chen blocked with his saber. With a huge explosion, the illusion was shattered. Both Long Chen and Ku Wuya in his ancient corpse were sent flying. They then smashed into the runic barrier.

Everyone was shocked to notice a thin white line appeared on the corpse’s fist. That was clearly left behind by Long Chen’s saber.

The junior generation was shocked that this ancient corpse would be able to block that heaven-shattering saber.

On the other hand, the Divine Lords stared in shock at Long Chen, unable to believe that he had resisted the Immortal King’s power without dying.

It had to be known that this Immortal King’s corpse was perfectly preserved. Its fist still had its runes from when it was alive. Based on its clothes, it was definitely from an ancient time, but for it to be perfectly preserved after so many years meant that its physical body was absolutely terrifying. Otherwise, Ku Wuya wouldn’t treat it as such a treasure.

After merging his blood and soul into this corpse, Ku Wuya was now capable of activating a portion of an Immortal King’s might. That kind of might was enough to wipe out all experts in the Four Peak realm. Even Divine Lords would flee. Was Long Chen really immune to this pressure?

Although Gui Yun had the pressure of a World King, it was just the slightest trace. But this Immortal King’s corpse still had the runes of an Immortal King preserved.

As for Long Chen, that one exchange had caused wounds to open up all over his body. Upon seeing this, Bai Shishi and the others’ hearts clenched.

Ku Wuya charged back at Long Chen like a bolt of lightning. His wolf tooth club reappeared in his hand. Long Chen then snorted and repeatedly slashed his saber, weaving a web of saber-images flying toward Ku Wuya.

Metallic ringing shook people’s ears. It felt as if their souls were being torn apart, but despite that, everyone watched closely. This was a clash of heavenly geniuses that they might never see again, so they didn’t want to miss a single detail. This was extremely beneficial to their future cultivation.

BOOM!

The two of them exchanged hundreds of blows before the two once more separated. Long Chen was covered in blood, and many wounds had opened all over his body. It was a horrifying appearance.

“Long Chen, where did that tough mouth of yours go, huh? You destroyed my physical body and ruined my future cultivation. I’ll make you live a life worse than death! Anyone who dares to interfere, I’ll kill them as well. I have nothing to lose.” Ku Wuya’s face was twisted with hatred, and his voice dripped with resentment.

This startled everyone. But thinking about it, they realized that with his soul merged into this corpse, he must be affected by the corpse’s runes. He would only be able to rely on this corpse to cultivate.

In other words, his original cultivation path was severed and he could only follow the path of this corpse. The only way he could break free from this corpse was to follow the corpse’s original cultivation path to its old peak and then make a further breakthrough. Then he would be able to find a new body for himself.

To walk someone else’s path and reach an even higher level than them was truly as difficult as ascending the heavens. It was almost impossible. Thus, by destroying his physical body, Long Chen truly had set Ku Wuya’s cultivation realm in stone. He would never rise to higher levels.

Perhaps if it was someone else, their ultimate goal would simply be the Divine Lord realm. However, for a genius like Ku Wuya, he definitely had his sights on higher realms. Now, he was limited to this quasi Immortal King realm. It was as if a person knew they were dying and that all their efforts were meaningless. This was unacceptable to such a peak heavenly genius.

Ku Wuya was also warning Gui Yun not to interfere. In any case, he had become like this, so he didn’t have any misgivings anymore. He didn’t mind killing Gui Yun as well.

In the distance, Gui Yun’s expression was ugly. He also wanted to kill Long Chen, but Ku Wuya had gone insane. Unless he could kill Ku Wuya and Long Chen together, the enmity from this slap would not be avenged by him.

The battle had taken several turns to end up like this. No one had expected such a thing to occur. A terrifying monster like Ku Wuya had actually lost his physical body and his future. The price of this battle was truly immense.

Seeing Ku Wuya roaring with resentment, Long Chen lazily rested his saber on his shoulder. He then closed his eyes and took a deep breath. After a while, he slowly opened his eyes and shook his head.

“Don’t you think it’s too early to say these things? Do you still not understand? I already said that I was worried that after killing one of you, the other would flee. Have you forgotten? Ah, well, that’s about enough. I’ve figured out the limit of my body. With my recovery speed, my body should be able to endure it. Let this senseless battle come to an end.”

Long Chen’s wild aura slowly faded until none of it was leaking at all. It felt as if he had simply given up on fighting.

“I loathe the way you talk so wildly with your expressionless face! Die!” Ku Wuya roared furiously and once more crossed the distance between them with a single step. Runes lit up all over his body, and he smashed his club at Long Chen again. This time, it seemed as if he was attempting to decide victory or defeat with one move.

In the face of this attack, Long Chen slowly raised his black saber. It was silent, with no aura. There was no manifestation. He only let out a simple slash.

BOOM!

Just as everyone thought that Long Chen was about to be killed, the black saber’s runes lit up. A heaven-shaking explosion stunned everyone. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After that, Ku Wuya’s body was sent flying and smashed into the runic net. As a result, the barrier deformed, and a large hole was made in it.

Furthermore, they were shocked to see that Ku Wuya’s Treasure item, the wolf tooth club, was broken. Only half of it remained in his hand. With a chill, everyone turned to stare at Long Chen.
