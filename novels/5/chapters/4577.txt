Chapter 4566 Lightning Storm

The young maiden in violet robes was Lei Linger, who looked like a lightning goddess descended from the very heavens. As the ruler of heavenly tribulation, her existence could shake the world, and the apocalyptic aura around her terrified all lifeforms.

The appearance of Lei Linger caused that crowned golden monkey’s pupils to contract. Her aura was so potent that it made even the monkey’s soul tremble. Regardless of their nature or form, all lifeforms harbored an inherent fear of heavenly tribulation. No one could forget the terror of struggling for survival amid the merciless trials of heavenly tribulation.

“Summoning helpers is useless! It’s your time to die!” the crowned monkey roared.

BOOM!

The monkey swung its immense staff at Lei Linger, and in response, Lei Linger expressionally brandished her lightning blade to intercept the attack. Just like that, golden divine radiance and violet lightning collided.

Lei Linger’s expression didn’t even twitch, but the monkey grunted and shot back like a shooting star. Even this powerful existence was unable to block a single attack from Lei Linger.

Shocked and enraged, the monkey’s Blood Qi churned within its body, nearly causing it to cough up blood in frustration.

“I refuse to believe that someone can control the power of heavenly tribulation!”

Its fur bristled suddenly, appearing to expand by a full level in an instant. Its Blood Qi surged, and its already fierce aura multiplied exponentially, enveloping it in a wild and overwhelming presence.

Feng You and the rest of the mixed beast race’s experts often experienced trouble from the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race’s branch. However, they had never seen one of the monkeys ignite their essence blood.

In truth, this wasn’t a technique that just any one of them could use. If their bloodline was not pure enough, although igniting their essence blood could temporarily boost their power, the price would be a permanent weakening of their bloodline.

However, the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race cared a great deal about the purity of their bloodline. If its purity fell, their position would also fall.

That wasn’t even the most important thing to them. The most unacceptable thing was that lowering the purity of their bloodline would result in them never awakening any divine abilities. Even if they did manage to awaken those divine abilities in the future, their power would be sharply discounted.

Hence, even though Feng You had fought the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race for many years, she had never seen any of them actually ignite their bloodline.

However, this particular crowned monkey was different. It was from their king branch, and its bloodline was extremely pure.

Even igniting its bloodline would not cause its bloodline to weaken, and it would only enter a weak state afterward. The recovery time would be quite brief as well.

Golden flames started to swirl around the monkey, a manifestation of its ignited life flame fueled by its bloodline. Its staff also erupted in flames as it launched another assault.

In front of this furious assault, Lei Linger snorted and raised her lightning blade. A sea of lightning then appeared in the sky, forming a vortex.

“Lightning Storm!”

The lightning clouds transformed into a giant storm, with the eye of the storm being right above the golden monkey.

Following Lei Linger’s display, the lightning clouds quivered ominously, parting to reveal a colossal heavenly lightning blade hurtling downward with unstoppable force.

BOOM!

The lightning blade pierced deep into the ground, like a knife through hot butter. Everything that it touched was wiped out of existence.

Seeing this scene, even Long Chen was stunned. Lei Linger’s power had surpassed his by a lot.

In the end, a wretched figure appeared in the distance. It was the golden monkey, and it was hacking up blood.

Just now, had it not retreated the moment this storm erupted, it would have been struck head-on.

Fortunately for the monkey, it had only brushed against the edge of the lightning blade. Despite that, the last attack had a locking component and caused a significant injury to the monkey.

“It’s only a lightning spirit? Is this the basis of your arrogance? I want to see just how strong this lightning spirit is!”

Just then, a cold snort rang out, coming from that bronze chariot. The white bone warhorse then let out a long neigh, and a snow-white horn appeared on the top of its head.

The horn lit up. Following that, the power of time appeared, and a ray of divine light shot at Lei Linger.

In response, Lei Linger summoned a lightning shield, accurately blocking that divine light.

BOOM!

With a resounding explosion, the lightning shield exploded. This seemingly light attack actually possessed supreme power, and Lei Linger was unable to fully block it.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Lei Linger was stronger than he was now, but she was unable to block this horse’s attack, which meant that its origins were definitely astonishing.

Just as the white bone horse attacked Lei Linger, the golden monkey also took this chance to go around her and attack Long Chen.

“Aren’t you the arrogant dragon race? You don’t even dare to fight me with the pure power of your bloodlines! Has the former emperor race fallen so far?!” shouted the monkey.

Long Chen was about to send Huo Linger out to fight as he shouldn’t show off all of his power, waiting for the final push to the gate.

However, he had no choice but to admit that this crowned monkey was truly frightening. If he wanted to use his own power to beat it, it would take quite some effort.

Long Chen was wary of revealing too much about himself, but the monkey’s taunts struck a nerve, causing his Blood Qi to surge uncontrollably.

Despite recognizing the taunt for what it was, Long Chen found himself unable to resist. As the monkey charged toward him, the sea of stars behind Long Chen suddenly ignited. Seven stars erupted like blazing suns. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

An enormous seven-star diagram materialized within his celestial sea, and a pillar of light surged from him, his power overflowing in a dazzling display.

“The dragon race’s true power isn’t something a monkey like you can speak of!” Long Chen’s roar echoed like the voice of a celestial god. Starlight flowed around him, pouring into his blood-colored saber. In an instant, the blade was covered in shimmering stars, emitting a thunderous resonance. A wild, uncontrollable power surged forth, threatening to burst at any moment. It seemed as though if this force was not unleashed, it would erupt in a cataclysmic explosion.

BOOM!

With unwavering determination, the blood-colored saber descended upon the crowned monkey with unstoppable force.
