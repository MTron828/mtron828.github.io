Chapter 3393 Beat You Until You’re Convinced

A claw tore through the air, bringing with it a whistling gust that tore up the earth. This attack’s power was quite heavy. Ying Bokong was clearly enraged.

“You can go wild if you wish. But don’t go past the limit that I permit!” shouted Ying Bokong as he attacked.

“A feathered bird also has a limit? If I tell you to endure it, then you have to endure it!” Long Chen snorted and unleashed a palm, just like that, without any flashy technique.

At the next moment, a metallic explosion boomed, qi waves erupted, and a crunching sound rang out.

Cheers rang out from the other experts. Just as they were about to say some fawning words over how Ying Bokong shattered Long Chen’s arm with one attack, they heard a scream. Blood then sprayed through the air.

After that, their figures parted. They saw Long Chen’s upper body was covered in blood, and he was clutching a bloody arm. And when they looked at Ying Bokong, they saw that he was pale. His arm had left his body.

They were dumbfounded. Ying Bokong’s arm had been ripped off? It had to be known that he had the body of a demonic beast. Their physical bodies were all very powerful, comparable to divine weapons. But his arm had simply been torn off just like that? Just what kind of terrifying power did that require?

“You have some skill! Good! You are qualified to make me use my full power!”

Ying Bokong’s expression was gloomy. At this moment, the space behind him rumbled and his manifestation appeared. It was a silver divine bird with two wings. After that, an ancient desolate air spread.

Ying Bokong’s Blood Qi grew explosively, and his entire body shone. Moreover, the arm that Long Chen had torn off actually grew out once more.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ying Bokong was bathed in the divine light of that divine bird. Right now, a halo of light surrounded him. The current him had finally unleashed his full power.

“Ying Bokong has finally gotten serious. This battle is over.”

“This fool, he has actually angered senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong. He’s definitely dead now.”

“Maybe not. Ying Bokong wants him as a battle pet. It’s just up to whether or not he has the fortune to make senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong show mercy.”

As Ying Bokong’s manifestation rumbled, everyone began to discuss this change. Of course, all this discussion was nothing more than flattery and fawning.

“The human race really is contemptible. If I don’t show you some power, you’ll never know what respect is. Today, I’ll show everyone what true power is, a power that a human like you could not achieve even after an entire lifetime of cultivation!”

Ying Bokong’s silver wings suddenly came out of the manifestation and shrouded the heavens. A pair of wings smashed down from the heavens like heavenly blades.

BOOM!

Just as everyone thought that the land would be torn apart, those silver wings stopped in midair. A hand caught them.

“What?!”

Everyone, including Ying Bokong, was completely shocked. This terrifying attack had been caught barehanded and without the slightest aura leaking out. In other words, Long Chen’s power far surpassed Ying Bokong’s. Otherwise, there was no way he could do this so effortlessly.

“Are you done bragging? Then it should be my turn now!”

BOOM!

Long Chen then tightened his grip, and those giant wings shattered in front of everyone’s stupefied gaze. These silver wings that were made of bloodline power and Heavenly Dao energy were crushed just like that.

Ying Bokong coughed up blood. That was a bloodline divine ability connected to his soul, so the destruction of the wings also injured him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth exploded with a stamp of Long Chen’s foot. He shot toward Ying Bokong, unleashing a punch to his abdomen. He was so fast that it was almost impossible to see him with the naked eye. By the time Ying Bokong reacted, he was already struck.

His body instantly curled up like a shrimp, and blood spurted out of his mouth. This one punch almost made his body explode.

Ying Bokong’s body smashed through several large mountains. Long Chen then stamped on the air and chased after him.

Suddenly, a giant silver eagle appeared. It spread its wings, filling heaven and earth. After that, a terrible aura erupted and terrified everyone.

“Senior apprentice-brother Ying Bokong has summoned his true body. That brat is done now!”

However, very quickly, something that they had never imagined before occurred. After summoning his true body and unleashing that frightening aura, Ying Bokong spread his wings and soared away. Rather than shooting at Long Chen, he flew in the opposite direction. He actually chose… to flee.

Those experts were left dumbfounded. It had to be known that a demonic beast was in their strongest state when they summoned their true bodies. Ying Bokong had actually summoned his true form to flee. They couldn’t believe it.

From the start, Long Chen had not revealed his aura. So, they were unable to tell just how powerful he was.

However, Ying Bokong was actually so terrified that he fled. They then realized that they were wrong. In his true form, Ying Bokong’s spiritual perception was also more perceptive, giving him a better sense of danger.

Just as he summoned his true body and prepared to go all-out against Long Chen, an intense sensation of danger filled him, as if Long Chen’s body concealed an ominous beast that would devour him in one gulp. Hence, he instinctively fled.

Unfortunately for him, just as he fled, Long Chen vanished from his original location. By the time he reappeared, he was already on Ying Bokong’s back. With a single kick, Ying Bokong tumbled to the ground, smashing a large hole in the ground. Countless feathers then flew off.

The place that Long Chen had kicked lost all its feathers. Those feathers were Ying Bokong’s defensive armor, and this one kick had essentially stripped him of his armor.

All this time, Long Chen had been in the Netherworld increasing his power, and the experts that he had encountered were all supremely powerful, so powerful that he was powerless to resist.

Now that he was back in the immortal world, he finally noticed that his body had completely transformed. He was like a completely different person from his old self.

His physical body was so powerful that he didn’t need any other power. He could entirely rely on just the ordinary power of his physical body to fight. He didn’t even need to circulate his Blood Qi. This was why those people were unable to sense his power and had continuously provoked him.

Ying Bokong continued to flee for his life, but Long Chen was faster than him. With every attack, he sent Ying Bokong flying, and a mass of his feathers fell.

In just a short amount of time, this silver eagle covered in feathers had become a bald chicken.

His wings were broken and his legs were made tame. Moreover, his neck was askew as he knelt on the ground, on his last breaths. Seeing Long Chen raising his foot at him again, Ying Bokong suddenly cried out.

“I admit defeat! Don’t kill me! I’m willing to be your battle pet!”
