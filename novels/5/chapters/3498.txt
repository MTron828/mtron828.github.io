Chapter 3487

Another World King was slain, so now only five of the World Kings remained. They were one step too late to save that World King.

BOOM!

The five of their attacks landed with an explosive sound. However, Long Chen’s saber sent the five of them flying back, coughing up blood.

It had taken the seven of them to fight evenly against Long Chen. Now that they had lost two, their guts shrank, and they were mentally suppressed. As a result, they were unable to stop a single blow from Long Chen.

“Split the Heavens 2!”

Long Chen once more roared and raised his saber. At some point, a faint layer of violet mist had appeared on top of the blood-red saber.

The five of them joined forces to defend, only for two of their physical bodies to be unable to endure the impact. They were blasted apart. Their Yuan Spirits had just fled when Long Chen’s palm slammed down, extinguishing their souls.

The people watching in the distance were completely stunned. The Soaring Dragon Company was one of the Violet Flame Heaven’s top trading companies, as equally famous as the Huayun Trading Company. Although their foundation couldn’t compare to the Huayun Trading Company and their history wasn’t as long as theirs, they were extremely powerful. No one dared to offend them.

Hence, these people couldn’t believe their eyes. Some youngster who could control a Ghost Ship had suddenly come for them. Furthermore, with a Divine Lord cultivation base, he slew World Kings across two major realms.

Although the Violet Flame Heaven was full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers, those who could fight across two major realms and one against seven were definitely legendary existences.

“Just who is he?! How can he control a Ghost Ship?!”

“What kind of enmity does he have with the Soaring Dragon Company? Why is his anger so overwhelming?”

“Fortunately, he warned us before attacking. Otherwise, if we were one step slower, all of us would have been turned to black dust.”

Seeing how ferocious Long Chen was, consecutively killing World Kings, all of those people were stunned and discussing it.

When they looked at the other experts of the Soaring Dragon Company, even if these people couldn’t read the future or sense that their longevity had been stripped away, they could at least see that those struck by the black ripple and survived were left with a black imprint on them. That was probably an omen of a calamity about to strike them.

Everyone said that those who got close to a Ghost Ship would have misfortune befall them. To put it frankly, they would have calamities befall them one after another. It seemed that the legends weren’t completely imaginary.

Some people with smaller guts had thought of the words of their elders when the Ghost Ship appeared, and they had immediately fled without even looking back. That was because their elders always said that this was the only way to keep themselves safe.

Some people with larger guts, aka those who felt themselves to be strong enough and didn’t put much stock in those legends, were curious enough to stay behind and keep watching.

It had to be known that an enormous existence like the Soaring Dragon Company had not been challenged by anyone for tens of thousands of years. But this ominous black-robed youngster suddenly appeared and did so. This was a huge affair. As witnesses to this event, they felt like if they fled, they would look down on themselves for the rest of their lives.

Now, only three World Kings remained. Seeing that the situation bode ill, they immediately turned and fled.

The instant two of them fled, a lightning spear and a flame spear pierced through their bodies. They instantly turned to ashes.

Qi Hong watched as all his allies were slain. He was pale with horror. Even his ruler was starting to shake, showing just how afraid he was.

“Now you know fear? Why didn’t you know fear when you offended even the heavens by causing the deaths of all those innocent cultivators?” Seeing Qi Hong’s terrified gaze only made Long Chen’s rage rise. His saber slashed down.

Qi Hong clenched his teeth and concentrated all his power on his ruler, pushing his power to his peak. As a result, his ruler was cut apart and his arms exploded. Blood gushed out of his seven orifices. After that, he smashed into a distant mountain peak, causing it to crumble.

Long Chen then walked toward Qi Hong. With every step, the world shook. Long Chen’s killing intent was still soaring. He was like a life-reaping devil king walking toward Qi Hong.

Now, Qi Hong’s arms were gone and his body was covered in cracks. He was completely horrified. All his bones were broken, but seeing Long Chen, his body could still twitch as he cowered back

“Are you afraid now? Do you finally cherish your own life? So why didn’t you cherish the lives of the innocent cultivators that you sacrificed to the Fiend Devil Eye? They were full of hope and anticipation for the future. They had spent their life’s savings, but you sent them into the open maw of the devil. Moreover, Bai Fang and Bai Rui were so pure and kind. Are you an animal? How could your conscience allow you to deceive them and make them kill themselves?” Long Chen’s eyes were scarlet. Every word he said was dripping with bloody hatred. He wanted to cut this person a thousand times and turn every part of him to dust.

Suddenly, the void shook and barriers of light appeared. World Kings appeared one by one. There were over thirty of them, and some of them were thrumming with powerful divine energy. Their auras were far stronger than Qi Hong and the others.

“It’s the Soaring Dragon Company's experts!” Startled cries rang out. Their reinforcements had come, and they were over thirty World Kings. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Counting carefully, there were thirty-six of them. Furthermore, every single one of them was carrying a golden bowl.

Those golden bowls had complicated lines carved into them. They were immediately pointed toward Long Chen.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, your death is at hand!” Seeing those reinforcements, the terrified Qi Hong instantly grew arrogant and laughed.

After that, thirty-six rays of divine light shot out of the thirty-six golden bowls. They were chains that bound Long Chen with incomparable speed. By the time Long Chen reacted, he was already tightly bound.

“This is the Soaring Dragon Company’s faith divine item, the Treasure Gathering Bowl?!” A shocked cry rang out, but they didn’t dare to be sure.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s Treasure Gathering Bowl was said to be the same as the Huayun Trading Company’s Major World Golden Coin. They were both faith divine items with boundless power. However, whether it was the Major World Golden Coin or the Treasure Gathering Bowl, people had only heard of them and never actually witnessed them. Both companies were trading companies and almost never fought with others. So people could only guess.

“Brazen interloper! You dare to challenge the Soaring Dragon Company? Although we focus on business, with the idea that amiability makes you rich, we will not allow others to provoke us!” Amongst the newcomers was a comparatively younger elder. Seeing that this port had been turned into a land of death, he was shocked and enraged.

“You focus on amiability makes you rich? Fuck your amiability makes you rich! Your Soaring Dragon Company clearly murders people for money!” cursed Long Chen.

Spiritual fluctuations came from Qi Hong. He was most likely communicating with that elder. Now, that elder’s expression changed, and he suddenly shouted, “It was clearly you who killed people to escape a calamity for yourself, but you blame my Soaring Dragon Company?! Capture him!”

The elder didn’t give Long Chen a chance to reply. Thirty-six people pulled in their chains at once.

“Long Chen, don’t worry, we won’t kill you. I have a method for gathering every treasure on your body. You really came at the right time.” Qi Hong looked at the bound Long Chen and sneered sinisterly.

“But I will kill you.”

Suddenly, a pitch-black dagger appeared in Long Chen’s hand. Those chains were cut through like they were tofu.

“You-!”

Qi Hong’s smile barely had a chance to transform into terror before that black dagger pierced through his head.
